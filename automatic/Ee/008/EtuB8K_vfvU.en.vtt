new vertical smoker and high def today
we're<00:00:06.210> going<00:00:06.299> to<00:00:06.390> be<00:00:06.450> working<00:00:06.660> on<00:00:06.870> the<00:00:07.020> inner

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
we're going to be working on the inner

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.650 
we're going to be working on the inner
frame<00:00:07.639> we've<00:00:08.639> already<00:00:08.820> put<00:00:09.120> up<00:00:09.240> the<00:00:09.420> Box

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
frame we've already put up the Box

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.780 
frame we've already put up the Box
Thresh<00:00:10.559> welded<00:00:10.980> the<00:00:11.070> box<00:00:11.280> we've<00:00:11.550> got<00:00:11.580> it

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
Thresh welded the box we've got it

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.180 
Thresh welded the box we've got it
squared<00:00:12.090> up<00:00:12.269> which<00:00:13.170> is<00:00:13.320> the<00:00:13.349> big<00:00:13.590> outer<00:00:13.860> frame

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
squared up which is the big outer frame

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.320 
squared up which is the big outer frame
now<00:00:14.490> we're<00:00:14.639> going<00:00:14.730> to<00:00:14.820> be<00:00:14.880> working<00:00:15.059> on<00:00:15.240> the

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
now we're going to be working on the

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.480 
now we're going to be working on the
inner<00:00:15.480> components<00:00:15.690> and<00:00:16.320> we're<00:00:17.220> going<00:00:17.340> to<00:00:17.400> get

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
inner components and we're going to get

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:18.830 
inner components and we're going to get
outside<00:00:17.789> and<00:00:17.940> get<00:00:18.029> to<00:00:18.150> welding<00:00:18.449> in<00:00:18.539> a<00:00:18.570> minute

we're just going to go over some of the

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.800 
we're just going to go over some of the
dimensions<00:00:20.279> here<00:00:20.760> and<00:00:20.910> some<00:00:21.449> of<00:00:21.570> what<00:00:21.660> we're

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
dimensions here and some of what we're

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.000 
dimensions here and some of what we're
going<00:00:21.930> to<00:00:22.020> do<00:00:22.199> so<00:00:22.529> if<00:00:22.590> you<00:00:22.680> want<00:00:22.830> to<00:00:22.890> come

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
around here take a look at the screen so

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.749 
around here take a look at the screen so
what<00:00:29.760> we<00:00:29.880> have<00:00:30.090> here<00:00:30.510> is<00:00:30.859> is<00:00:31.859> we've<00:00:32.160> Tad's<00:00:32.489> it

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
what we have here is is we've Tad's it

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.569 
what we have here is is we've Tad's it
out<00:00:32.910> our<00:00:33.210> frame<00:00:33.660> and<00:00:33.989> this<00:00:34.920> is<00:00:35.100> what<00:00:35.250> it<00:00:35.370> looks

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
out our frame and this is what it looks

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:41.479 
out our frame and this is what it looks
like<00:00:35.670> and<00:00:36.440> so<00:00:37.440> today<00:00:38.629> we'll<00:00:39.629> be<00:00:39.809> putting<00:00:40.489> these

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
like and so today we'll be putting these

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.119 
like and so today we'll be putting these
pieces<00:00:42.000> in<00:00:42.390> these<00:00:42.660> cross<00:00:42.960> members<00:00:43.129> these

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
pieces in these cross members these

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.520 
pieces in these cross members these
uprights<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:45.059> then<00:00:45.539> would<00:00:45.690> put<00:00:45.719> putting<00:00:46.379> in

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
uprights and then would put putting in

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.340 
uprights and then would put putting in
the<00:00:46.649> floor<00:00:46.920> and<00:00:47.250> then<00:00:47.850> some<00:00:48.030> more<00:00:48.059> uprights<00:00:48.690> to

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
the floor and then some more uprights to

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.950 
the floor and then some more uprights to
where<00:00:49.500> we're<00:00:49.649> building<00:00:49.800> an<00:00:50.100> inner<00:00:50.309> frame

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
where we're building an inner frame

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.389 
where we're building an inner frame
inside<00:00:51.960> of<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:52.289> box<00:00:52.559> that<00:00:52.770> we<00:00:52.920> already<00:00:53.100> have

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
inside of the box that we already have

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.869 
inside of the box that we already have
we'll<00:00:54.210> have<00:00:54.239> these<00:00:54.510> chimneys<00:00:54.890> fabricated<00:00:55.890> and

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
we'll have these chimneys fabricated and

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.779 
we'll have these chimneys fabricated and
then<00:00:57.180> we'll<00:00:57.629> have<00:00:57.840> a<00:00:57.870> wall<00:00:58.170> put<00:00:58.559> in<00:00:58.739> that<00:00:59.550> goes

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
then we'll have a wall put in that goes

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.299 
then we'll have a wall put in that goes
into<00:01:00.059> you<00:01:00.359> around<00:01:00.930> here<00:01:01.230> around<00:01:01.530> the<00:01:01.859> back<00:01:02.070> and

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
into you around here around the back and

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.850 
into you around here around the back and
that<00:01:02.699> makes<00:01:02.850> our<00:01:03.059> inner<00:01:03.270> wall<00:01:03.570> that<00:01:04.530> way<00:01:04.650> we'll

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
that makes our inner wall that way we'll

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.649 
that makes our inner wall that way we'll
be<00:01:04.979> able<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.250> insulate<00:01:05.549> outside<00:01:06.299> and<00:01:06.600> around

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
be able to insulate outside and around

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.870 
be able to insulate outside and around
it<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.170> then<00:01:07.680> we'll<00:01:07.890> put<00:01:08.070> an<00:01:08.159> outer<00:01:08.369> shell<00:01:08.670> on

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
it and then we'll put an outer shell on

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.060 
it and then we'll put an outer shell on
this<00:01:09.000> cooker<00:01:09.330> when<00:01:09.510> we're<00:01:09.659> done<00:01:09.810> so<00:01:10.590> that's

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
this cooker when we're done so that's

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.230 
this cooker when we're done so that's
what<00:01:11.220> we're<00:01:11.400> going<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.580> be<00:01:11.670> working<00:01:11.850> on<00:01:12.060> today

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
yeah that's fine yeah the back of the

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.300 
yeah that's fine yeah the back of the
stack<00:02:08.369> is<00:02:08.580> go<00:02:08.700> ahead<00:02:09.149> on<00:02:09.270> that<00:02:09.300> frame<00:02:09.950> so<00:02:10.950> stack

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
stack is go ahead on that frame so stack

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.610 
stack is go ahead on that frame so stack
of<00:02:11.489> Center<00:02:11.819> onto<00:02:12.090> that<00:02:12.239> and<00:02:12.690> then<00:02:13.200> and<00:02:13.440> then

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:49.910 
around the stacks okay and then we'll
have<00:02:45.890> the<00:02:46.890> other<00:02:47.069> wall<00:02:47.630> that<00:02:48.630> will<00:02:48.959> come<00:02:49.890> on

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
have the other wall that will come on

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.830 
have the other wall that will come on
the<00:02:50.160> inside<00:02:50.190> of<00:02:50.730> the<00:02:50.970> stacks<00:02:51.269> and<00:02:51.569> that'll<00:02:51.780> be

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
the inside of the stacks and that'll be

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:54.380 
the inside of the stacks and that'll be
a<00:02:51.870> you<00:02:52.200> and<00:02:52.530> it'll<00:02:52.650> be<00:02:52.829> about<00:02:53.070> two<00:02:54.030> three

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
a you and it'll be about two three

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.060 
a you and it'll be about two three
inches<00:02:54.690> shorter<00:02:54.750> and<00:02:55.290> that's<00:02:55.530> where<00:02:55.739> the<00:02:55.890> heat

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
inches shorter and that's where the heat

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.060 
inches shorter and that's where the heat
will<00:02:56.700> come<00:02:56.910> around<00:02:57.109> up<00:02:58.109> out<00:02:58.380> of<00:02:58.500> the<00:02:58.560> top<00:02:58.799> and

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
will come around up out of the top and

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:00.349 
will come around up out of the top and
then<00:02:59.190> we'll<00:02:59.310> get<00:02:59.400> the<00:02:59.549> heat<00:02:59.700> under<00:03:00.090> the<00:03:00.180> bottom

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:00.359 
then we'll get the heat under the bottom

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:09.830 
then we'll get the heat under the bottom
from<00:03:01.260> the<00:03:01.290> water<00:03:01.590> paper<00:03:08.359> yeah<00:03:09.359> so<00:03:09.600> we<00:03:09.720> just

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840 
from the water paper yeah so we just

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.240 
from the water paper yeah so we just
need<00:03:09.989> to<00:03:10.049> go<00:03:10.230> on<00:03:10.380> our<00:03:10.500> marks<00:03:10.829> there<00:03:11.040> on<00:03:11.160> the

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
need to go on our marks there on the

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.030 
need to go on our marks there on the
bottom<00:03:11.579> that<00:03:11.730> those<00:03:11.940> crossmembers<00:03:12.690> in<00:03:13.040> and

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
bottom that those crossmembers in and

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.620 
bottom that those crossmembers in and
then<00:03:14.730> we'll<00:03:14.880> come<00:03:15.060> up<00:03:15.090> with<00:03:15.510> our<00:03:16.410> other

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
then we'll come up with our other

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.259 
then we'll come up with our other
without<00:03:18.630> with<00:03:18.810> our<00:03:18.959> upward<00:03:19.519> our<00:03:20.519> vertical

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
without with our upward our vertical

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:39.679 
without with our upward our vertical
members

00:03:39.679 --> 00:03:39.689 

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:47.099 

so<00:03:43.230> catch<00:03:44.230> our<00:03:44.409> verticals<00:03:44.920> and<00:03:45.510> then<00:03:46.510> and<00:03:46.959> then

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:47.109 
so catch our verticals and then and then

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:57.869 
so catch our verticals and then and then
we'll<00:03:47.230> put<00:03:47.469> angle<00:03:56.310> put<00:03:57.310> the<00:03:57.430> angle<00:03:57.579> on<00:03:57.849> our

00:03:57.869 --> 00:03:57.879 
we'll put angle put the angle on our

00:03:57.879 --> 00:04:06.979 
we'll put angle put the angle on our
uprights<00:03:58.299> and<00:03:58.599> then<00:03:58.689> build<00:03:58.900> the<00:03:58.989> box
