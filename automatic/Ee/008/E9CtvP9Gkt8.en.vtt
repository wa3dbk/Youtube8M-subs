00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:32.810 
the first choice guys a bit of a run out

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.350 
the first choice guys a bit of a run out

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
as it is so I think what you'll see is

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:40.960 
as it is so I think what you'll see is
actually<00:01:39.650> pretty<00:01:40.250> much<00:01:40.430> first<00:01:40.700> choice

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:40.970 
actually pretty much first choice

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.660 
actually pretty much first choice

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.200 
got knocked out in the final qualifiers
for<00:02:50.960> this<00:02:51.080> competition<00:02:51.710> so<00:02:52.340> i<00:02:52.370> think<00:02:52.700> that

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:53.210 
for this competition so i think that

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:54.820 
for this competition so i think that
cost<00:02:53.420> we<00:02:53.630> can<00:02:53.840> may<00:02:53.990> score<00:02:54.320> in<00:02:54.470> making<00:02:54.770> a

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
cost we can may score in making a

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.850 
cost we can may score in making a
japanese<00:02:55.250> victory<00:02:55.730> a<00:02:55.970> 2-1<00:02:56.810> or<00:02:56.960> 31<00:02:57.380> but<00:02:57.410> I<00:02:57.590> think

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
japanese victory a 2-1 or 31 but I think

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.380 
japanese victory a 2-1 or 31 but I think
Costa<00:02:58.160> Rica<00:02:58.400> will<00:02:58.550> find<00:02:58.760> the<00:02:58.880> back<00:02:59.000> of<00:02:59.150> the<00:02:59.240> net

this to turn out as a fairly dull sort

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.500 
this to turn out as a fairly dull sort
of<00:03:19.370> draw<00:03:19.580> because<00:03:19.820> of<00:03:20.030> the<00:03:20.209> amount<00:03:20.390> of

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
of draw because of the amount of

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:21.880 
of draw because of the amount of
experimentation<00:03:21.230> there's<00:03:21.590> going<00:03:21.800> to<00:03:21.860> be

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
experimentation there's going to be

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:23.890 
experimentation there's going to be
particularly<00:03:22.610> in<00:03:22.700> the<00:03:22.760> second<00:03:23.060> half<00:03:23.270> you've

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
particularly in the second half you've

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.320 
particularly in the second half you've
got<00:03:24.050> a<00:03:24.290> situation<00:03:25.010> where<00:03:25.489> a<00:03:25.640> team<00:03:25.910> finishes

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:26.330 
got a situation where a team finishes

got a situation where a team finishes
the<00:03:26.480> game<00:03:26.600> would<00:03:26.750> practically<00:03:27.080> an<00:03:27.230> entirely

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
the game would practically an entirely

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.250 
the game would practically an entirely
different<00:03:28.160> 11<00:03:28.520> to<00:03:28.610> 15<00:03:28.970> they<00:03:29.480> started<00:03:29.930> out<00:03:30.050> with

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
different 11 to 15 they started out with

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.470 
different 11 to 15 they started out with
then<00:03:30.830> that<00:03:31.010> can<00:03:31.550> tend<00:03:31.910> to<00:03:32.030> suppress<00:03:32.360> the

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
then that can tend to suppress the

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.449 
then that can tend to suppress the
number<00:03:32.720> of<00:03:32.780> goals<00:03:32.989> scored<00:03:33.140> on<00:03:33.590> the<00:03:34.190> other<00:03:34.340> hand

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
number of goals scored on the other hand

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:36.190 
number of goals scored on the other hand
both<00:03:34.610> teams<00:03:35.090> are<00:03:35.150> doing<00:03:35.300> it<00:03:35.510> you<00:03:35.630> could<00:03:35.810> also

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:36.200 
both teams are doing it you could also

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.710 
both teams are doing it you could also
get<00:03:36.590> a<00:03:36.770> lot<00:03:37.040> of<00:03:37.070> girls<00:03:37.430> scored<00:03:37.820> so<00:03:38.450> from<00:03:38.690> that

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
get a lot of girls scored so from that

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.240 
get a lot of girls scored so from that
point<00:03:38.959> of<00:03:39.080> view<00:03:39.140> I<00:03:39.260> might<00:03:39.560> be<00:03:39.709> inclined<00:03:40.250> to

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
point of view I might be inclined to

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:41.979 
point of view I might be inclined to
take<00:03:40.520> that<00:03:40.670> price<00:03:40.880> on<00:03:41.150> being<00:03:41.510> over<00:03:41.660> two<00:03:41.810> and<00:03:41.930> a

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:41.989 
take that price on being over two and a

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:44.229 
take that price on being over two and a
half<00:03:42.110> goals<00:03:42.410> I<00:03:42.620> think<00:03:43.220> maybe<00:03:43.550> it<00:03:43.730> might<00:03:44.090> even

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239 
half goals I think maybe it might even

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:45.970 
half goals I think maybe it might even
be<00:03:44.330> over<00:03:44.600> three<00:03:44.810> and<00:03:44.840> a<00:03:44.959> half<00:03:44.989> of<00:03:45.260> my<00:03:45.380> co2<00:03:45.590> to

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
be over three and a half of my co2 to

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.670 
be over three and a half of my co2 to
hear<00:03:46.250> okay<00:03:47.060> so<00:03:47.540> we<00:03:47.780> like<00:03:47.959> the<00:03:48.110> value<00:03:48.380> here<00:03:48.410> in

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
hear okay so we like the value here in

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.220 
hear okay so we like the value here in
the<00:03:48.800> Japan<00:03:49.160> win<00:03:49.510> what<00:03:50.510> other<00:03:50.690> market<00:03:51.110> should

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
the Japan win what other market should

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.170 
the Japan win what other market should
we<00:03:51.320> consider<00:03:51.500> for<00:03:51.830> this<00:03:51.920> match<00:03:52.130> I<00:03:52.519> think<00:03:52.700> if

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
we consider for this match I think if

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.449 
we consider for this match I think if
you've<00:03:53.600> got<00:03:53.870> to<00:03:54.050> look<00:03:54.200> at<00:03:54.410> things<00:03:54.860> like<00:03:54.980> who's

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
you've got to look at things like who's

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:57.460 
you've got to look at things like who's
going<00:03:55.610> to<00:03:55.670> be<00:03:55.760> ahead<00:03:55.820> at<00:03:56.030> halftime<00:03:56.239> well<00:03:56.930> I<00:03:56.959> can

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
going to be ahead at halftime well I can

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:58.810 
going to be ahead at halftime well I can
easily<00:03:57.590> see<00:03:57.920> this<00:03:58.070> game<00:03:58.280> being<00:03:58.430> and<00:03:58.580> draw<00:03:58.790> a

00:03:58.810 --> 00:03:58.820 
easily see this game being and draw a

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.300 
easily see this game being and draw a
half<00:03:59.120> time<00:03:59.390> to<00:03:59.510> be<00:03:59.600> honest<00:03:59.900> that<00:04:00.100> trading<00:04:01.100> band

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:01.310 
half time to be honest that trading band

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.300 
half time to be honest that trading band
about<00:04:01.519> 3.25<00:04:02.209> last<00:04:02.810> time<00:04:03.019> I<00:04:03.050> looked<00:04:03.320> and<00:04:03.470> I

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
about 3.25 last time I looked and I

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.850 
about 3.25 last time I looked and I
think<00:04:04.550> yes<00:04:05.000> look<00:04:05.300> at<00:04:05.540> the<00:04:05.720> final<00:04:06.110> score<00:04:06.260> don't

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:06.860 
think yes look at the final score don't

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:08.380 
think yes look at the final score don't
be<00:04:07.010> afraid<00:04:07.280> to<00:04:07.310> bet<00:04:07.580> the<00:04:07.760> drawer<00:04:08.000> but<00:04:08.180> better

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:08.390 
be afraid to bet the drawer but better

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:10.060 
be afraid to bet the drawer but better
on<00:04:08.720> it<00:04:08.870> being<00:04:09.050> a<00:04:09.200> higher<00:04:09.380> drawer<00:04:09.680> to<00:04:09.830> get<00:04:09.950> the

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.070 
on it being a higher drawer to get the

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:12.490 
on it being a higher drawer to get the
values<00:04:10.400> so<00:04:10.670> bet<00:04:11.180> on<00:04:11.330> the<00:04:11.420> 22<00:04:11.870> which<00:04:12.170> would

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
values so bet on the 22 which would

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.490 
values so bet on the 22 which would
again<00:04:12.800> ran<00:04:13.100> about<00:04:13.220> 5.5<00:04:14.030> earlier<00:04:14.390> today<00:04:14.540> okay
