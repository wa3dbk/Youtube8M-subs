 m 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.270
 it's super well written theatrical enough 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.189
 actually because because jean him 

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.270
 from there I was hyper hyper 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.400
 impressed because indeed the 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.780
 text is very very very very well written 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.670
 but he put black mount he emit 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.540
 of absurd humor and all that gives a 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.540
 something that I liked 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.750
 they were quits if you tell us and we 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:00.300
 also had a dumb uncle uncle 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:03.089
 we were 12 at the table of the day at 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:07.200
 next day a dish of mushrooms me 

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:08.580
 left alone in the world alone because I had 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.440
 stole 10 francs in the cash drawer 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.320
 to buy sweets and my dad 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:16.350
 in progress or had cried out since you have 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.720
 stolen you will be deprived of mushrooms these 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.649
 deadly mushrooms 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.890
 it was the deaf mute who had 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:26.429
 welcomed and that night there were eleven 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:29.250
 corpses at home who did not see eleven 

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:32.130
 corpses at a time can not be done 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:37.409
 an idea of â€‹â€‹the number of corpses that it 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:38.819
 done there was everywhere else by the rest 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.380
 of my sorrow they have rather the truth 

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:42.240
 I was only 12 years old and we will agree 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.130
 that he was in excessive jeering for my to 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.380
 of the village's five o'clock in the evening was 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.509
 with us the father where are paralyzed 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.330
 for 20 years had been carried 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:53.280
 there and they blind dust others 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:57.149
 saying let me see let me 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.530
 to see I had been sent back from 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.450
 room and not knowing anymore measured I 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.460
 I was fearfully hidden under the 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.740
 cash drawer from there I heard all this 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.979
 who told himself everything that was whispering 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.350
 the first deaths had been announced no 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.920
 without some respect as well as it is 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.890
 rule 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:17.400
 but from the fourth death the ads 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.410
 brief and soon laconic vars 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.900
 another one 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.300
 and I perceived incredible dialogues and 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.240
 the grandmother not yet but that's the 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:30.260
 sphere of 20 minutes 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:34.020
 how much more than four 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:36.440
 the murderous uncle the mute deaf died on 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:39.270
 last in horrible suffering 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:43.200
 who is the one who screams like that? 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:46.470
 the and answer and I was alive 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.060
 because I flew from there to 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.200
 conclude that the others were dead 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.200
 because they were honest 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.280
 and
