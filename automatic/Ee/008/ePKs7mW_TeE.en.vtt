different kinds of traction pad some of

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.360 
different kinds of traction pad some of
them<00:00:47.840> are<00:00:47.989> all<00:00:48.170> one<00:00:48.410> piece<00:00:48.710> this<00:00:49.040> one<00:00:49.250> is

foot much closer to the back of the

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.110 
foot much closer to the back of the
board<00:01:08.320> so<00:01:08.590> make<00:01:08.770> sure<00:01:08.800> that<00:01:09.610> it's<00:01:09.729> about<00:01:09.850> an

plug is that's this little round guy
right<00:01:16.060> here<00:01:16.500> okay<00:01:17.500> so<00:01:17.560> the<00:01:17.770> first<00:01:17.920> thing

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.190 
right here okay so the first thing

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:19.740 
right here okay so the first thing
you're<00:01:18.310> going<00:01:18.400> to<00:01:18.460> do<00:01:18.729> is<00:01:19.000> make<00:01:19.300> sure<00:01:19.330> that<00:01:19.630> you

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
you're going to do is make sure that you

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.120 
you're going to do is make sure that you
have<00:01:19.930> the<00:01:20.050> right<00:01:20.229> placement<00:01:20.800> for<00:01:21.070> your

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
have the right placement for your

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.300 
have the right placement for your
traction<00:01:21.880> pad<00:01:22.060> so<00:01:22.930> two<00:01:23.560> ways<00:01:23.740> you<00:01:23.950> can<00:01:24.100> tell

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
traction pad so two ways you can tell

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.490 
traction pad so two ways you can tell
one<00:01:24.790> is<00:01:25.060> the<00:01:25.240> stringer<00:01:25.750> of<00:01:25.900> the<00:01:26.020> board<00:01:26.260> which

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
one is the stringer of the board which

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.440 
one is the stringer of the board which
is<00:01:26.680> the<00:01:26.710> midline<00:01:27.190> of<00:01:27.220> the<00:01:27.460> board<00:01:27.700> the<00:01:28.210> other<00:01:28.330> is

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
is the midline of the board the other is

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:29.940 
is the midline of the board the other is
the<00:01:28.660> rails<00:01:28.900> which<00:01:29.229> are<00:01:29.380> the<00:01:29.500> side<00:01:29.710> of<00:01:29.860> the

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:29.950 
the rails which are the side of the

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:31.859 
the rails which are the side of the
board<00:01:30.130> so<00:01:30.400> you<00:01:30.460> want<00:01:30.760> your<00:01:30.940> attraction<00:01:31.300> pad<00:01:31.660> to

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:31.869 
board so you want your attraction pad to

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:34.080 
board so you want your attraction pad to
be<00:01:31.990> evenly<00:01:32.500> placed<00:01:32.800> with<00:01:33.430> the<00:01:33.580> middle<00:01:33.850> of<00:01:33.940> it

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
be evenly placed with the middle of it

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.300 
be evenly placed with the middle of it
on<00:01:34.240> the<00:01:34.390> stringer<00:01:34.840> and<00:01:34.960> the<00:01:35.380> edges<00:01:35.800> evenly

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
on the stringer and the edges evenly

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.760 
on the stringer and the edges evenly
spaced<00:01:36.610> from<00:01:37.119> the<00:01:37.390> rails<00:01:37.570> of<00:01:37.750> the<00:01:37.810> board<00:01:38.080> so

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
spaced from the rails of the board so

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:43.260 
spaced from the rails of the board so
I'm<00:01:38.830> going<00:01:38.950> to<00:01:39.009> get<00:01:39.100> mine<00:01:39.250> lined<00:01:39.490> up

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.340 

now<00:01:43.810> looks<00:01:44.049> pretty<00:01:44.170> good

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
now looks pretty good

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.749 
now looks pretty good
I'm<00:01:46.770> going<00:01:46.920> to<00:01:47.010> go<00:01:47.100> ahead<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.490> take<00:01:47.700> it<00:01:47.850> apart

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 
I'm going to go ahead and take it apart

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:52.580 
I'm going to go ahead and take it apart
just<00:01:50.759> gently<00:01:51.210> pulling<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.689> science<00:01:52.110> and<00:01:52.320> then

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
just gently pulling the science and then

the first piece that we're going to

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.380 
the first piece that we're going to
place<00:01:54.900> is<00:01:55.290> the<00:01:56.040> middle<00:01:56.280> piece<00:01:56.490> that'll<00:01:57.180> help

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
place is the middle piece that'll help

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.480 
place is the middle piece that'll help
us<00:01:57.630> set<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.350> distance<00:01:58.770> for<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.040> other<00:01:59.220> two

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
us set the distance for the other two

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.719 
us set the distance for the other two
pieces<00:01:59.759> to<00:02:00.630> come<00:02:00.810> on<00:02:00.960> after<00:02:01.170> it<00:02:01.490> so<00:02:02.490> once

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:09.620 

and<00:03:07.189> then<00:03:07.340> you're<00:03:07.489> just<00:03:07.579> gonna<00:03:07.730> press<00:03:08.209> down

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
and then you're just gonna press down

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.880 
and then you're just gonna press down
especially<00:03:10.470> on<00:03:10.590> the<00:03:10.680> corners<00:03:11.100> and<00:03:11.340> the<00:03:11.460> edges

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
make sure you apply pressure like one

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.550 
make sure you apply pressure like one
millimeter<00:03:18.990> off<00:03:19.260> but<00:03:19.590> it'll<00:03:19.950> still<00:03:20.190> work<00:03:21.560> once

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
millimeter off but it'll still work once

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.050 
millimeter off but it'll still work once
you've<00:03:22.770> got<00:03:22.920> the<00:03:23.070> centerpiece<00:03:23.640> applied

you've got the centerpiece applied

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.820 
you've got the centerpiece applied
that'll<00:03:24.630> help<00:03:24.750> you<00:03:24.930> figure<00:03:25.110> out<00:03:25.290> where<00:03:25.560> to<00:03:25.590> put

that'll help you figure out where to put
the<00:03:25.950> side<00:03:26.160> pieces

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.800 

you<00:03:29.510> want<00:03:29.690> to<00:03:29.780> have<00:03:29.930> the<00:03:30.080> side<00:03:30.320> pieces<00:03:31.810> not

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:32.810 
you want to have the side pieces not

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:35.530 
you want to have the side pieces not
right<00:03:33.260> on<00:03:33.530> the<00:03:33.890> rail<00:03:34.220> of<00:03:34.430> the<00:03:34.460> board<00:03:34.760> so<00:03:35.300> have

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
right on the rail of the board so have

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:38.620 
right on the rail of the board so have
it<00:03:35.690> about<00:03:36.110> an<00:03:36.410> inch<00:03:36.680> in<00:03:37.180> from<00:03:38.180> the<00:03:38.300> rail<00:03:38.450> of<00:03:38.600> the

board and you want to have them close

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:42.130 
board and you want to have them close
enough<00:03:40.700> together<00:03:41.180> that<00:03:41.450> you're<00:03:41.720> not<00:03:41.930> going<00:03:42.080> to

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:42.140 
enough together that you're not going to

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.260 
enough together that you're not going to
have<00:03:42.350> a<00:03:42.380> big<00:03:42.680> blank<00:03:43.430> spot<00:03:43.730> where<00:03:43.910> your

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:44.270 
have a big blank spot where your

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:53.050 
have a big blank spot where your
slit

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:04:00.860 

that<00:03:53.510> looks<00:03:53.720> pretty<00:03:53.959> good

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:03.830 

once<00:04:01.470> again<00:04:01.650> placing<00:04:02.280> it<00:04:02.400> down<00:04:02.640> I<00:04:03.030> like<00:04:03.569> to<00:04:03.720> do

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
once again placing it down I like to do

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.860 
once again placing it down I like to do
the<00:04:03.989> back<00:04:04.200> end<00:04:04.470> first<00:04:04.920> and<00:04:05.340> then<00:04:06.300> work<00:04:06.450> all<00:04:06.690> the

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
the back end first and then work all the

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.190 
the back end first and then work all the
way<00:04:06.959> to<00:04:07.020> the<00:04:07.170> front<00:04:08.780> make<00:04:09.780> sure<00:04:09.810> you're

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
way to the front make sure you're

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:17.720 
way to the front make sure you're
pressing<00:04:10.380> down<00:04:10.620> on<00:04:10.920> the<00:04:11.010> corners

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:17.730 

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:20.270 

so<00:04:18.330> once<00:04:18.540> your<00:04:18.720> stomp<00:04:19.020> out<00:04:19.230> is<00:04:19.410> on<00:04:19.650> a<00:04:19.950> lot<00:04:20.160> of

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
so once your stomp out is on a lot of

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.460 
so once your stomp out is on a lot of
companies<00:04:20.670> say<00:04:20.700> wait<00:04:21.120> 24<00:04:21.720> hours<00:04:21.750> before<00:04:22.200> you

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
companies say wait 24 hours before you

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:24.020 
companies say wait 24 hours before you
go<00:04:22.590> in<00:04:22.740> the<00:04:22.830> water<00:04:22.950> to<00:04:23.310> make<00:04:23.490> sure<00:04:23.700> that<00:04:23.880> it's

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
go in the water to make sure that it's

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.210 
go in the water to make sure that it's
really<00:04:24.360> adhered<00:04:24.810> to<00:04:24.960> the<00:04:25.080> board<00:04:25.320> it's

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
really adhered to the board it's

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.190 
really adhered to the board it's
probably<00:04:26.640> a<00:04:26.670> good<00:04:26.850> idea<00:04:26.910> if<00:04:27.450> you're<00:04:28.020> super

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:28.200 
probably a good idea if you're super

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.690 
probably a good idea if you're super
stoked<00:04:28.590> and<00:04:28.830> you<00:04:28.920> just<00:04:29.100> want<00:04:29.310> to<00:04:29.370> get<00:04:29.490> in<00:04:29.610> the

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.700 
stoked and you just want to get in the

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.280 
stoked and you just want to get in the
