case<00:01:21.570> of<00:01:21.900> group<00:01:22.080> swinging<00:01:22.530> at<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.650> same<00:01:22.920> time

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
case of group swinging at the same time

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.460 
case of group swinging at the same time
as<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.369> fire<00:01:23.580> rate<00:01:23.880> a<00:01:24.229> something<00:01:25.229> after<00:01:25.439> you

this<00:03:18.269> isn't<00:03:18.540> an<00:03:18.660> emulator<00:03:21.019> apart<00:03:22.019> from

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:27.210 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:31.080 

ahem<00:03:28.240> say<00:03:28.840> spots<00:03:29.530> on<00:03:29.830> my<00:03:30.100> memory<00:03:30.459> card<00:03:30.700> to<00:03:30.910> do

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
ahem say spots on my memory card to do

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:32.670 
ahem say spots on my memory card to do
to<00:03:31.240> the<00:03:31.330> memory<00:03:31.600> card<00:03:31.630> being<00:03:32.080> largely<00:03:32.290> full

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:32.680 
to the memory card being largely full

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.540 
to the memory card being largely full
and<00:03:34.410> basically<00:03:35.410> this<00:03:35.680> woman<00:03:36.100> because<00:03:36.370> I<00:03:36.430> think

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:36.550 
and basically this woman because I think

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:40.559 
and basically this woman because I think
next<00:03:36.910> to<00:03:37.000> no<00:03:37.270> memory<00:03:37.780> whatsoever<00:03:38.940> I<00:03:39.940> think<00:03:40.510> it

00:03:40.559 --> 00:03:40.569 
next to no memory whatsoever I think it

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:45.000 
next to no memory whatsoever I think it
takes<00:03:40.750> two<00:03:41.080> slots<00:03:42.660> save<00:03:43.660> for<00:03:44.170> this<00:03:44.320> game<00:03:44.620> as

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
takes two slots save for this game as

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:46.680 
takes two slots save for this game as
well<00:03:45.190> which<00:03:45.370> doesn't<00:03:45.610> help<00:03:45.760> and<00:03:46.030> is<00:03:46.120> only<00:03:46.240> 15

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
well which doesn't help and is only 15

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.310 
well which doesn't help and is only 15
