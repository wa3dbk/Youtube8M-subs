a<00:01:53.220> load<00:01:53.490> off<00:01:53.550> man<00:01:54.060> that's<00:01:54.600> all<00:01:54.780> I'm<00:01:54.899> saying

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.050 

I<00:02:02.229> tie<00:02:03.229> my<00:02:03.259> friends<00:02:03.799> to<00:02:03.920> talk<00:02:04.100> about<00:02:04.310> Salvage

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
I tie my friends to talk about Salvage

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.849 
I tie my friends to talk about Salvage
which<00:02:05.299> of<00:02:05.570> the<00:02:05.750> three<00:02:06.020> brand<00:02:06.289> new<00:02:06.409> maps<00:02:06.649> is

00:02:06.849 --> 00:02:06.859 
which of the three brand new maps is

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:08.830 
which of the three brand new maps is
definitely<00:02:07.549> the<00:02:07.670> smallest<00:02:07.880> it<00:02:08.420> takes<00:02:08.660> place

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
definitely the smallest it takes place

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.559 
definitely the smallest it takes place
in<00:02:08.959> a<00:02:09.259> snow-covered<00:02:09.830> junkyard<00:02:10.489> the<00:02:11.239> one<00:02:11.390> thing

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
in a snow-covered junkyard the one thing

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:13.420 
in a snow-covered junkyard the one thing
when<00:02:11.780> I<00:02:11.840> first<00:02:12.050> jumped<00:02:12.410> into<00:02:12.530> this<00:02:12.709> map<00:02:12.950> what<00:02:13.400> I

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
when I first jumped into this map what I

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.369 
when I first jumped into this map what I
was<00:02:13.700> really<00:02:13.730> blown<00:02:14.060> away<00:02:14.150> by<00:02:14.390> was<00:02:14.900> was<00:02:15.230> the

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:15.379 
was really blown away by was was the

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:17.350 
was really blown away by was was the
atmosphere<00:02:15.500> just<00:02:16.160> the<00:02:16.340> grit<00:02:16.640> and<00:02:16.849> the<00:02:17.000> grime

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
atmosphere just the grit and the grime

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.320 
atmosphere just the grit and the grime
it's<00:02:18.140> really<00:02:18.470> kind<00:02:18.799> of<00:02:18.890> you<00:02:19.099> know<00:02:19.330> solidified

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
it's really kind of you know solidified

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:21.520 
it's really kind of you know solidified
everything<00:02:20.510> the<00:02:20.900> second<00:02:21.260> that<00:02:21.349> I<00:02:21.379> actually

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 
saw you know myself on this map actually

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:25.600 
saw you know myself on this map actually
starting<00:02:24.470> to<00:02:24.500> get<00:02:24.650> chilly<00:02:24.980> looking<00:02:25.340> at<00:02:25.459> it

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
starting to get chilly looking at it

look up there is no place to go this is

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.530 
look up there is no place to go this is
all<00:02:32.930> on<00:02:33.349> one<00:02:33.680> level<00:02:33.950> this<00:02:34.610> is<00:02:34.790> this<00:02:35.000> is<00:02:35.180> to<00:02:35.390> meet

all on one level this is this is to meet

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.259 
all on one level this is this is to meet
its<00:02:35.750> simplicity<00:02:36.230> bit<00:02:36.620> of<00:02:36.739> itself<00:02:37.069> and<00:02:37.340> not<00:02:38.150> in

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
its simplicity bit of itself and not in

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:40.030 
its simplicity bit of itself and not in
a<00:02:38.329> bad<00:02:38.510> way<00:02:38.540> I<00:02:38.870> mean<00:02:39.079> the<00:02:39.620> thing<00:02:39.799> the<00:02:39.890> high

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
a bad way I mean the thing the high

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.819 
a bad way I mean the thing the high
notice<00:02:40.430> is<00:02:40.640> that<00:02:41.209> all<00:02:41.959> these<00:02:42.230> little

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:42.829 
notice is that all these little

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:44.710 
notice is that all these little
alleyways<00:02:43.340> all<00:02:43.579> these<00:02:43.730> roads<00:02:44.030> have<00:02:44.269> a<00:02:44.329> very

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:44.720 
alleyways all these roads have a very

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.650 
alleyways all these roads have a very
very<00:02:45.260> narrow<00:02:45.650> focus<00:02:46.220> right<00:02:46.819> and<00:02:47.000> i<00:02:47.060> think<00:02:47.209> this

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
very narrow focus right and i think this

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:49.569 
very narrow focus right and i think this
for<00:02:48.110> modern<00:02:48.530> warfare<00:02:48.680> 2<00:02:49.010> it's<00:02:49.190> really<00:02:49.459> going

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:49.579 
for modern warfare 2 it's really going

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:52.150 
for modern warfare 2 it's really going
to<00:02:49.640> boil<00:02:49.879> it<00:02:50.120> down<00:02:50.150> to<00:02:50.480> skill<00:02:50.959> versus<00:02:51.829> you<00:02:52.129> know

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
to boil it down to skill versus you know

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:55.240 
to boil it down to skill versus you know
map<00:02:52.489> complexity<00:02:53.500> well<00:02:54.500> I<00:02:54.530> think<00:02:54.650> I<00:02:54.890> mean<00:02:55.040> to<00:02:55.160> me

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250 
map complexity well I think I mean to me

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.130 
map complexity well I think I mean to me
the<00:02:55.370> way<00:02:55.459> I<00:02:55.489> would<00:02:55.730> describe<00:02:55.760> this<00:02:56.180> map<00:02:56.390> in<00:02:56.629> in

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
the way I would describe this map in in

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.190 
the way I would describe this map in in
one<00:02:57.590> phrase<00:02:57.920> every<00:02:58.790> corner<00:02:59.569> is<00:02:59.750> going<00:03:00.019> to<00:03:00.079> be

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
one phrase every corner is going to be

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:07.839 
one phrase every corner is going to be
an<00:03:00.290> adventure

00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:07.849 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:10.429 

as<00:03:08.849> soon<00:03:09.030> as<00:03:09.120> we<00:03:09.239> jump<00:03:09.450> on<00:03:09.599> a<00:03:09.659> storm<00:03:09.989> the<00:03:10.230> first

00:03:10.429 --> 00:03:10.439 
as soon as we jump on a storm the first

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:11.839 
as soon as we jump on a storm the first
thing<00:03:10.620> that<00:03:10.739> pops<00:03:10.920> out<00:03:11.099> to<00:03:11.159> me<00:03:11.370> again<00:03:11.640> is<00:03:11.819> that

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:11.849 
thing that pops out to me again is that

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:13.789 
thing that pops out to me again is that
is<00:03:12.120> that<00:03:12.329> atmosphere<00:03:12.989> they<00:03:13.170> created<00:03:13.560> I<00:03:13.650> think

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:13.799 
is that atmosphere they created I think

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:16.459 
is that atmosphere they created I think
they<00:03:13.890> captured<00:03:14.310> it<00:03:14.400> again<00:03:14.640> in<00:03:15.450> storm<00:03:15.840> you<00:03:16.409> know

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:16.469 
they captured it again in storm you know

00:03:16.469 --> 00:03:17.720 
they captured it again in storm you know
it's<00:03:16.620> interesting<00:03:16.709> too<00:03:17.159> is<00:03:17.189> I<00:03:17.310> think<00:03:17.519> you<00:03:17.609> look

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
it's interesting too is I think you look

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:18.800 
it's interesting too is I think you look
at<00:03:17.849> this<00:03:17.969> and<00:03:18.120> it<00:03:18.209> does<00:03:18.329> have<00:03:18.359> these<00:03:18.689> really

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
at this and it does have these really

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.860 
at this and it does have these really
long<00:03:19.049> sight<00:03:19.379> lines<00:03:19.590> right<00:03:19.890> but<00:03:20.760> I<00:03:21.060> feel<00:03:21.599> like

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
long sight lines right but I feel like

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.899 
long sight lines right but I feel like
they've<00:03:22.079> done<00:03:22.319> a<00:03:22.349> good<00:03:22.680> job<00:03:22.739> of<00:03:23.159> allowing<00:03:23.640> you

00:03:23.899 --> 00:03:23.909 
they've done a good job of allowing you

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:26.809 
they've done a good job of allowing you
to<00:03:24.769> tactically<00:03:25.769> move<00:03:25.890> through<00:03:26.250> so<00:03:26.700> the

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:26.819 
to tactically move through so the

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:27.830 
to tactically move through so the
snipers<00:03:27.180> are<00:03:27.299> really<00:03:27.450> going<00:03:27.540> to<00:03:27.599> be<00:03:27.689> picking

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
snipers are really going to be picking

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.179 
snipers are really going to be picking
off<00:03:28.019> all<00:03:28.170> the<00:03:28.290> guys<00:03:28.439> that<00:03:28.650> are<00:03:28.709> kind<00:03:28.890> of<00:03:28.920> too

they're<00:03:36.900> going<00:03:37.049> to<00:03:37.109> get<00:03:37.170> tagged<00:03:37.469> at<00:03:37.680> a<00:03:37.709> really

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:37.889 
they're going to get tagged at a really

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:39.500 
they're going to get tagged at a really
long<00:03:38.069> distance<00:03:38.489> I<00:03:38.730> think<00:03:39.150> it's<00:03:39.239> going<00:03:39.299> to<00:03:39.389> be

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
long distance I think it's going to be

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:40.910 
long distance I think it's going to be
really<00:03:39.720> easy<00:03:39.840> to<00:03:40.139> pick<00:03:40.290> up<00:03:40.439> on<00:03:40.560> some<00:03:40.799> of<00:03:40.859> the

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
really easy to pick up on some of the

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.250 
really easy to pick up on some of the
landmarks<00:03:41.310> some<00:03:41.939> of<00:03:42.030> the<00:03:42.090> key<00:03:42.269> elements<00:03:42.510> of

far as the layout goes it is a fairly

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.360 
far as the layout goes it is a fairly
big<00:03:51.000> map<00:03:51.299> there<00:03:51.989> is<00:03:52.079> some<00:03:52.260> interior<00:03:52.590> but

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
big map there is some interior but

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.089

people like to say there is the big

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:04.940 
people like to say there is the big
warehouse<00:04:03.120> though<00:04:03.419> I<00:04:03.569> think<00:04:03.840> that's<00:04:03.989> there

warehouse though I think that's there

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.409 
warehouse though I think that's there
are<00:04:05.189> a<00:04:05.220> couple<00:04:05.400> of<00:04:05.579> outbuildings<00:04:05.939> that<00:04:06.299> you

00:04:06.409 --> 00:04:06.419 
are a couple of outbuildings that you

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:07.940 
are a couple of outbuildings that you
can<00:04:06.540> kind<00:04:06.720> of<00:04:06.780> get<00:04:06.930> into<00:04:07.200> their<00:04:07.379> small<00:04:07.680> kind<00:04:07.889> of

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:07.950 
can kind of get into their small kind of

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:10.909 
can kind of get into their small kind of
discrete<00:04:08.370> areas<00:04:08.810> but<00:04:09.810> the<00:04:10.019> main<00:04:10.319> interior

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:10.919 
discrete areas but the main interior

00:04:10.919 --> 00:04:13.280 
discrete areas but the main interior
area<00:04:11.189> is<00:04:11.370> this<00:04:11.519> enormous<00:04:12.060> warehouse<00:04:12.870> and<00:04:13.169> it's

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
very well be the focal point people

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.680 
very well be the focal point people
might<00:04:16.560> gravitate<00:04:16.859> towards<00:04:17.669> it<00:04:17.849> it's

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
might gravitate towards it it's

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.330 
might gravitate towards it it's
definitely<00:04:18.930> an<00:04:19.320> interesting<00:04:19.500> place<00:04:19.919> to<00:04:19.949> have

kind of a shootout just due to the

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:27.790 
kind of a shootout just due to the
