00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:20.420
 in 80 years the earth can be left without 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:22.880
 oxygen the scientists calculate that the 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.860
 phytoplankton main source of oxygen 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:27.730
 atmospheric can reach a state 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:30.050
 critical of shortage according to scientists 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.730
 Americans in a few dozen 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.710
 years humanity will face 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.300
 problem of lack of oxygen in the 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.399
 earth's atmosphere due to the 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.920
 decrease in tropical phytoplankton in 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:41.480
 the aquatic surface a team of 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.730
 scientists from the university of 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.800
 Michigan when investigating the surface of 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.780
 the world's oceans observed the 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.700
 effect of increasing the temperature of the 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.580
 water on the metabolism of plankton 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.590
 Scientists say in his essay that 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.570
 it is expected towards the end of this century a 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.340
 shortage of phytoplankton one of the 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.220
 main sources of oxygen 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:03.470
 atmospheric when examining about 130 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.089
 phytoplankton species especially 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.070
 the areas of its development in the area 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:09.229
 temperate climate and in the waters 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.240
 close to the polar circle the biologists 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:13.250
 concluded that phytoplankton should 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.770
 reproduce at lower temperatures 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.200
 that the average temperature of the year is 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.860
 say according to preliminary conclusions of 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.840
 the scientists 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.570
 tropical phytoplankton are more 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.700
 sensitive to global warming due 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.560
 to those processes of climate change and the 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.210
 increase in temperatures all the 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.310
 plankton of the tropical zone can 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:34.290
 get cornered at the poles where 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.020
 it also runs the risk of disappearing 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.420
 the michigan researchers arrived 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.400
 to a sad conclusion after a few 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.440
 eight decades the decline of oxygen 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.870
 will acquire a critical state which 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.970
 has negative implications not only in 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:51.890
 all marine fauna and flora but 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.890
 also in terrestrial life in total
