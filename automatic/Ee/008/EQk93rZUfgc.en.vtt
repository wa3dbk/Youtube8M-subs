Bush is elusive back as opposed to

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.299

winds of 112 miles per hour and what you
gotta<00:01:04.830> do<00:01:05.010> is<00:01:05.040> just<00:01:05.339> pretty<00:01:05.549> much<00:01:05.760> aim<00:01:06.380> the

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
gotta do is just pretty much aim the

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.530 
they have a new kicking mechanic where
it<00:01:11.130> kind<00:01:11.280> of<00:01:11.430> shows<00:01:11.700> you<00:01:11.880> where<00:01:12.030> it's<00:01:12.180> going

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
it kind of shows you where it's going

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.690 
it kind of shows you where it's going
even<00:01:12.960> with<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.350> wind<00:01:13.560> so<00:01:14.189> you<00:01:14.250> want<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:14.549> just

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
even with the wind so you want to just

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.210 
even with the wind so you want to just
point<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.570> green<00:01:15.869> arrow<00:01:16.259> in<00:01:16.560> the<00:01:16.710> middle<00:01:17.040> of

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
point the green arrow in the middle of

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.460 
point the green arrow in the middle of
the<00:01:17.310> uprights<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.299> just<00:01:18.810> do<00:01:18.930> a<00:01:18.960> full<00:01:19.229> power

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
the uprights and just do a full power

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.440 
the uprights and just do a full power
kick<00:01:19.890> and<00:01:20.130> your<00:01:20.700> field<00:01:21.060> goal<00:01:21.299> will<00:01:21.420> be

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
kick and your field goal will be

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.649 
kick and your field goal will be
perfectly<00:01:21.990> fine<00:01:22.380> so<00:01:23.130> the<00:01:23.759> gauntlet<00:01:24.180> also

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
perfectly fine so the gauntlet also

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.560 
perfectly fine so the gauntlet also
raises<00:01:25.320> the<00:01:25.500> level<00:01:25.530> of<00:01:26.009> difficulty<00:01:26.490> I<00:01:27.270> believe

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
raises the level of difficulty I believe

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.550 
raises the level of difficulty I believe
after<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.259> tenth<00:01:28.590> one<00:01:28.920> and<00:01:29.930> every<00:01:30.930> ten<00:01:31.350> it

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
after the tenth one and every ten it

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.469 
after the tenth one and every ten it
raises<00:01:31.950> it<00:01:32.040> up<00:01:32.130> again<00:01:32.549> I<00:01:32.880> believe<00:01:33.299> for<00:01:33.420> the

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
raises it up again I believe for the

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.510 
raises it up again I believe for the
first<00:01:33.689> ten<00:01:33.930> they<00:01:34.110> call<00:01:34.320> it<00:01:34.439> easy<00:01:34.710> then<00:01:35.250> it<00:01:35.369> goes

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
first ten they call it easy then it goes

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.380 
first ten they call it easy then it goes
to<00:01:35.549> medium<00:01:36.150> then<00:01:37.020> hard<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:38.009> then<00:01:38.390> after

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
to medium then hard and then after

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.649 
to medium then hard and then after
thirty<00:01:40.020> its<00:01:40.350> elite<00:01:40.950> and<00:01:41.280> all<00:01:42.210> you<00:01:42.329> gotta<00:01:42.509> do<00:01:42.630> is

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
thirty its elite and all you gotta do is

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.300 
thirty its elite and all you gotta do is
get<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:42.899> level<00:01:43.140> 25<00:01:43.560> so<00:01:43.920> you<00:01:43.979> don't<00:01:44.130> even<00:01:44.159> have

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
get the level 25 so you don't even have

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.929 
get the level 25 so you don't even have
to<00:01:44.430> worry<00:01:44.640> about<00:01:44.729> the<00:01:44.970> Elite<00:01:45.210> levels<00:01:45.530> but<00:01:46.939> all

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
to worry about the Elite levels but all

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.630 
to worry about the Elite levels but all
these<00:01:48.479> are<00:01:48.750> pretty<00:01:49.229> simple<00:01:49.860> I<00:01:50.009> mean<00:01:50.250> I<00:01:50.280> would

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
these are pretty simple I mean I would

these are pretty simple I mean I would
highly<00:01:51.090> suggest<00:01:51.119> doing<00:01:51.810> these<00:01:52.170> skills

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
highly suggest doing these skills

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.090 
highly suggest doing these skills
trainers<00:01:53.310> before<00:01:54.049> doing<00:01:55.049> any<00:01:55.799> of<00:01:55.890> the

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
trainers before doing any of the

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
little bit of an idea of what each of

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.219 
little bit of an idea of what each of
the<00:02:04.079> challenges<00:02:04.619> are<00:02:04.710> going<00:02:04.920> to<00:02:05.009> be<00:02:05.310> um

the challenges are going to be um

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:09.979 
the challenges are going to be um
whether<00:02:07.250> it<00:02:08.250> is<00:02:08.610> a<00:02:08.670> pass<00:02:09.119> protection<00:02:09.509> thing<00:02:09.840> so

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
whether it is a pass protection thing so

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.080 
whether it is a pass protection thing so
this<00:02:10.140> is<00:02:10.259> the<00:02:10.410> second<00:02:11.160> boss<00:02:11.489> it's<00:02:11.849> called

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
this is the second boss it's called

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.250 
this is the second boss it's called
entourage<00:02:12.690> so

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
entourage so

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.320 
entourage so
each<00:02:13.349> of<00:02:13.500> your<00:02:13.620> blockers<00:02:13.920> will<00:02:14.580> pancake<00:02:15.180> a

each of your blockers will pancake a

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.869 
each of your blockers will pancake a
defender<00:02:15.930> if<00:02:16.230> they<00:02:16.860> come<00:02:17.069> into<00:02:17.220> contact<00:02:17.280> with

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:17.879 
defender if they come into contact with

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:20.539 
defender if they come into contact with
them<00:02:18.239> so<00:02:18.629> you<00:02:19.470> just<00:02:19.650> gotta<00:02:19.860> follow<00:02:20.400> your

know<00:02:53.819> the<00:02:54.090> other<00:02:54.120> two<00:02:54.299> but<00:02:54.840> I<00:02:55.170> know<00:02:55.500> I<00:02:55.620> had<00:02:55.889> that

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
know the other two but I know I had that

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.649 
know the other two but I know I had that
once<00:02:56.400> and<00:02:56.760> if<00:02:56.849> I<00:02:56.970> wouldn't<00:02:57.269> have<00:02:57.359> had<00:02:57.510> the

once and if I wouldn't have had the

once and if I wouldn't have had the
skills<00:02:57.930> trainer<00:02:58.230> course<00:02:59.129> I<00:02:59.340> would<00:02:59.519> have<00:02:59.609> had

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
skills trainer course I would have had

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.910 
skills trainer course I would have had
no<00:02:59.760> idea<00:03:00.180> what<00:03:00.329> I<00:03:00.359> need<00:03:00.599> to<00:03:00.629> do<00:03:00.900> for<00:03:01.200> it<00:03:01.379> but

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
no idea what I need to do for it but

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.990 
no idea what I need to do for it but
most<00:03:02.220> of<00:03:02.459> them<00:03:02.549> are<00:03:02.760> just<00:03:02.959> passing<00:03:03.959> ones<00:03:04.500> and

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
most of them are just passing ones and

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.580 
most of them are just passing ones and
defense<00:03:06.000> ones<00:03:06.329> that<00:03:06.599> are<00:03:06.659> hardly<00:03:06.930> any<00:03:07.109> running

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
defense ones that are hardly any running

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:10.009 
defense ones that are hardly any running
ones<00:03:07.769> that<00:03:07.920> I<00:03:07.980> actually<00:03:08.159> ran<00:03:08.459> into<00:03:08.849> which<00:03:09.750> is

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
ones that I actually ran into which is

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:11.750 
ones that I actually ran into which is
good<00:03:10.319> thing<00:03:10.680> because<00:03:10.889> some<00:03:11.370> of<00:03:11.400> the<00:03:11.579> wrong

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
good thing because some of the wrong

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.080 
good thing because some of the wrong
running<00:03:12.269> ones<00:03:12.450> like<00:03:13.099> just<00:03:14.099> being<00:03:14.250> able<00:03:14.519> to<00:03:14.849> do

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
running ones like just being able to do

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.020 
running ones like just being able to do
some<00:03:15.840> of<00:03:15.959> the<00:03:16.019> moves<00:03:16.290> the<00:03:17.220> game<00:03:17.489> makes<00:03:17.730> a<00:03:17.819> lot

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
some of the moves the game makes a lot

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.330 
some of the moves the game makes a lot
more<00:03:18.060> difficult<00:03:18.720> than<00:03:18.780> it<00:03:18.840> needs<00:03:18.989> to<00:03:19.169> be<00:03:19.340> but

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
more difficult than it needs to be but

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.119 
more difficult than it needs to be but
here<00:03:20.760> is<00:03:20.879> level<00:03:21.209> 15<00:03:21.750> now<00:03:22.290> my<00:03:22.440> failed<00:03:22.709> at<00:03:22.859> this<00:03:22.980> I

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:23.129 
here is level 15 now my failed at this I

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:25.729 
here is level 15 now my failed at this I
think<00:03:23.190> twice<00:03:23.970> or<00:03:24.750> three<00:03:25.139> times<00:03:25.169> before<00:03:25.560> I

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
think twice or three times before I

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:27.349 
think twice or three times before I
actually<00:03:25.919> got<00:03:26.190> through<00:03:26.220> it<00:03:26.519> so<00:03:27.120> there<00:03:27.329> are

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:27.359 
actually got through it so there are

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:28.939 
actually got through it so there are
four<00:03:27.690> defenders<00:03:28.079> that<00:03:28.139> you<00:03:28.349> got<00:03:28.530> to<00:03:28.620> get<00:03:28.739> by

00:03:28.939 --> 00:03:28.949 
four defenders that you got to get by

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:30.619 
four defenders that you got to get by
and<00:03:29.340> like<00:03:29.489> I<00:03:29.639> said<00:03:29.699> you<00:03:30.120> got<00:03:30.239> to<00:03:30.269> be<00:03:30.449> a<00:03:30.480> little

00:03:30.619 --> 00:03:30.629 
and like I said you got to be a little

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:33.319 
and like I said you got to be a little
bit<00:03:30.750> of<00:03:30.900> elusive<00:03:31.410> and<00:03:31.650> be<00:03:32.609> able<00:03:32.669> to<00:03:32.849> do<00:03:33.030> pass

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.329 
bit of elusive and be able to do pass

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:35.210 
bit of elusive and be able to do pass
them<00:03:33.629> but<00:03:33.810> my<00:03:33.989> strategy<00:03:34.349> I<00:03:34.590> think<00:03:34.919> will<00:03:35.069> work

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
them but my strategy I think will work

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.490 
them but my strategy I think will work
for<00:03:35.459> this<00:03:35.489> one<00:03:35.760> is<00:03:36.060> you<00:03:36.510> can<00:03:36.720> run<00:03:37.049> straight

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500 
for this one is you can run straight

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.909 
for this one is you can run straight
past<00:03:37.769> the<00:03:37.980> first<00:03:38.190> guy<00:03:38.430> just<00:03:38.790> use<00:03:38.970> sprint<00:03:39.919> Juke

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:40.919 
past the first guy just use sprint Juke

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:43.460 
past the first guy just use sprint Juke
the<00:03:40.949> second<00:03:41.609> person<00:03:41.760> and<00:03:42.269> then<00:03:42.810> sort<00:03:43.139> of<00:03:43.290> just

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
the second person and then sort of just

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.009 
the second person and then sort of just

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
hang on the left side of the wall and

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:48.860 
hang on the left side of the wall and
then<00:03:46.829> right<00:03:47.370> when<00:03:48.120> you're<00:03:48.269> about<00:03:48.299> 10<00:03:48.720> yards

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
then right when you're about 10 yards

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.009 
then right when you're about 10 yards
away<00:03:49.109> from<00:03:49.199> the<00:03:49.530> third<00:03:49.739> defender<00:03:50.220> just<00:03:51.019> shut

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
away from the third defender just shut

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:54.259 
away from the third defender just shut
out<00:03:52.199> to<00:03:52.829> the<00:03:52.949> right<00:03:53.190> and<00:03:53.519> just<00:03:53.760> trying<00:03:54.060> to

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
out to the right and just trying to

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:57.649 
out to the right and just trying to
diagonal<00:03:55.049> diagonal<00:03:55.980> way<00:03:56.549> yourself<00:03:57.209> to<00:03:57.540> the

00:03:57.649 --> 00:03:57.659 
diagonal diagonal way yourself to the

00:03:57.659 --> 00:03:59.210 
diagonal diagonal way yourself to the
right<00:03:57.870> side<00:03:58.169> and<00:03:58.470> you'll<00:03:58.590> be<00:03:58.709> able<00:03:58.889> to<00:03:59.099> get

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
right side and you'll be able to get

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:00.710 
right side and you'll be able to get
past<00:03:59.430> the<00:03:59.669> defender<00:03:59.819> so<00:04:00.209> that's<00:04:00.329> my<00:04:00.510> third

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
past the defender so that's my third

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.890 
past the defender so that's my third
fail<00:04:00.989> on<00:04:01.169> it<00:04:01.319> but<00:04:01.919> like<00:04:01.949> I<00:04:02.220> said<00:04:02.280> run<00:04:03.000> sprint

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
fail on it but like I said run sprint

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.930 
fail on it but like I said run sprint
past<00:04:04.139> the<00:04:04.290> first<00:04:04.500> guy<00:04:04.709> jus<00:04:05.220> got<00:04:05.250> the<00:04:05.549> second

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
past the first guy jus got the second

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:07.520 
past the first guy jus got the second
guy<00:04:06.030> as<00:04:06.359> close<00:04:06.659> to<00:04:06.840> the<00:04:06.959> left<00:04:07.139> side<00:04:07.290> as<00:04:07.470> you

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
guy as close to the left side as you

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.250 
guy as close to the left side as you
possibly<00:04:08.010> can<00:04:08.280> stand<00:04:09.239> the<00:04:09.389> left<00:04:09.599> side<00:04:09.810> kind<00:04:10.169> of

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
possibly can stand the left side kind of

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.860 
possibly can stand the left side kind of
like<00:04:10.379> this<00:04:10.680> Juke<00:04:11.489> and<00:04:11.729> then<00:04:11.940> just<00:04:12.150> go<00:04:12.540> for<00:04:12.810> the

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:12.870 
like this Juke and then just go for the

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.960 
like this Juke and then just go for the
right<00:04:13.049> side<00:04:13.349> I<00:04:13.379> got<00:04:13.650> lucky<00:04:13.889> by<00:04:14.190> it<00:04:14.250> being<00:04:14.760> able

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970 
right side I got lucky by it being able

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:16.640 
right side I got lucky by it being able
to<00:04:15.120> get<00:04:15.209> out<00:04:15.329> of<00:04:15.359> that<00:04:15.419> tackle<00:04:15.900> but<00:04:16.229> that<00:04:16.409> last

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
to get out of that tackle but that last

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:18.020 
to get out of that tackle but that last
attempt<00:04:17.099> there<00:04:17.280> is<00:04:17.370> pretty<00:04:17.549> much<00:04:17.669> what<00:04:17.940> I'm

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
attempt there is pretty much what I'm

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:20.750 
attempt there is pretty much what I'm
talking<00:04:18.419> about<00:04:18.739> just<00:04:19.739> try<00:04:20.130> and<00:04:20.159> get<00:04:20.459> out<00:04:20.579> to

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:20.760 
talking about just try and get out to

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.339 
talking about just try and get out to
the<00:04:20.849> right<00:04:20.970> side<00:04:21.209> as<00:04:21.389> quickly<00:04:21.690> as<00:04:21.900> possible

00:04:22.339 --> 00:04:22.349 
the right side as quickly as possible

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:23.870 
the right side as quickly as possible
and<00:04:22.409> I<00:04:22.530> probably<00:04:22.800> waited<00:04:23.250> a<00:04:23.280> little<00:04:23.430> bit<00:04:23.639> too

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
and I probably waited a little bit too

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.990 
and I probably waited a little bit too
long<00:04:24.380> in<00:04:25.380> order<00:04:25.650> to<00:04:25.710> do

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.000 
long in order to do

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.090 
long in order to do
then<00:04:26.090> I<00:04:26.120> got<00:04:26.420> lucky<00:04:26.750> with<00:04:26.870> the<00:04:27.080> broken<00:04:27.560> tackle

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.100 
then I got lucky with the broken tackle

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.910 
then I got lucky with the broken tackle
but<00:04:28.520> the<00:04:28.610> first<00:04:28.790> guy<00:04:29.030> you<00:04:29.090> can<00:04:29.360> ignore<00:04:29.920> second

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:30.920 
but the first guy you can ignore second

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.130 
but the first guy you can ignore second
guy<00:04:31.010> you<00:04:31.070> got<00:04:31.310> a<00:04:31.340> juke<00:04:31.730> and<00:04:32.000> I<00:04:32.660> think<00:04:32.720> the<00:04:32.930> last

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:33.140 
guy you got a juke and I think the last

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:34.870 
guy you got a juke and I think the last
two<00:04:33.380> you<00:04:33.500> can<00:04:33.650> ignore<00:04:33.800> if<00:04:34.190> you<00:04:34.280> can<00:04:34.400> just<00:04:34.430> jut

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
two you can ignore if you can just jut

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:38.620 
two you can ignore if you can just jut
out<00:04:34.910> to<00:04:35.240> the<00:04:35.360> right<00:04:35.600> quick<00:04:36.140> enough<00:04:36.490> so<00:04:37.630> that's

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
out to the right quick enough so that's

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:40.480 
out to the right quick enough so that's
my<00:04:38.900> strategy<00:04:39.170> for<00:04:39.590> the<00:04:39.650> fifteenth<00:04:40.070> one<00:04:40.250> and

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:40.490 
my strategy for the fifteenth one and

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:42.880 
my strategy for the fifteenth one and
like<00:04:40.610> I<00:04:40.730> said<00:04:40.990> elusive<00:04:41.990> back<00:04:42.170> elusive<00:04:42.770> a

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:42.890 
like I said elusive back elusive a

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:45.490 
like I said elusive back elusive a
collusive<00:04:43.250> back<00:04:43.670> because<00:04:44.270> you<00:04:45.050> gotta<00:04:45.260> have<00:04:45.470> a

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:45.500 
collusive back because you gotta have a

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.530 
collusive back because you gotta have a
fast<00:04:45.770> guy<00:04:46.040> there<00:04:46.370> in<00:04:46.640> order<00:04:47.030> to<00:04:47.180> get<00:04:47.300> past

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:47.540 
fast guy there in order to get past

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:52.140 
fast guy there in order to get past
those<00:04:47.810> defenders<00:04:48.730> at<00:04:49.730> the<00:04:49.820> back<00:04:50.150> end<00:04:50.480> but

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:52.150 
those defenders at the back end but

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:55.210 
those defenders at the back end but
defense<00:04:53.150> is<00:04:53.300> pretty<00:04:53.450> easy<00:04:53.780> uh<00:04:54.200> your<00:04:55.100> other

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:57.260 
defenders can help you out and you don't

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.760 
defenders can help you out and you don't
necessarily<00:04:57.380> have<00:04:57.920> to<00:04:58.270> get<00:04:59.270> a<00:04:59.300> sack<00:04:59.660> or<00:05:00.169> tackle

the guy yourself Oh in those team
defensive<00:05:04.850> ones<00:05:05.090> you<00:05:05.360> can<00:05:05.540> let<00:05:06.350> your

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:06.500 
defensive ones you can let your

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:09.140 
defensive teammates help you out some of

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.909 
defensive teammates help you out some of
them<00:05:09.230> are<00:05:09.350> a<00:05:09.380> little<00:05:09.410> bit<00:05:09.620> more<00:05:09.740> difficult

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:09.919 
them are a little bit more difficult

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:12.400 
them are a little bit more difficult
like<00:05:10.370> that<00:05:10.550> when<00:05:10.790> you<00:05:10.880> have<00:05:11.060> to<00:05:11.410> sometimes

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:12.410 
like that when you have to sometimes

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:13.960 
like that when you have to sometimes
it'll<00:05:12.620> tell<00:05:12.860> you<00:05:12.980> whether<00:05:13.190> you<00:05:13.490> need<00:05:13.610> to<00:05:13.730> have

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:13.970 
it'll tell you whether you need to have

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:16.210 
it'll tell you whether you need to have
a<00:05:14.419> conservative<00:05:15.200> tackler<00:05:15.500> aggressive<00:05:15.890> tackle

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:16.220 
a conservative tackler aggressive tackle

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:19.210 
a conservative tackler aggressive tackle
so<00:05:16.340> this<00:05:16.460> is<00:05:16.610> the<00:05:17.050> 20th<00:05:18.050> level<00:05:18.380> boss<00:05:18.560> and<00:05:18.980> it's

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:19.220 
so this is the 20th level boss and it's

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.340 
so this is the 20th level boss and it's
a<00:05:19.340> passing<00:05:19.760> play<00:05:19.970> and<00:05:20.240> you<00:05:20.540> just<00:05:20.690> need<00:05:20.840> to<00:05:20.960> pass

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:21.350 
a passing play and you just need to pass

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:23.500 
a passing play and you just need to pass
and<00:05:21.680> throw<00:05:22.040> it<00:05:22.160> into<00:05:22.400> one<00:05:22.730> of<00:05:22.820> the<00:05:22.940> zones<00:05:23.180> and

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:23.510 
and throw it into one of the zones and

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:25.120 
and throw it into one of the zones and
they<00:05:23.630> have<00:05:23.750> to<00:05:23.870> make<00:05:23.990> the<00:05:24.110> catch<00:05:24.320> inside<00:05:24.890> that

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:25.130 
they have to make the catch inside that

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:27.700 
they have to make the catch inside that
zone<00:05:25.460> in<00:05:25.820> order<00:05:26.180> for<00:05:26.450> it<00:05:26.480> to<00:05:26.540> count<00:05:26.810> now<00:05:27.590> the

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:27.710 
zone in order for it to count now the

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:29.170 
zone in order for it to count now the
good<00:05:27.950> thing<00:05:28.010> about<00:05:28.190> that<00:05:28.640> one<00:05:28.880> is<00:05:29.030> that

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:29.180 
good thing about that one is that

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:30.880 
good thing about that one is that
there's<00:05:29.390> no<00:05:29.450> defenders<00:05:30.080> rushing<00:05:30.530> you<00:05:30.650> at<00:05:30.770> all

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:30.890 
there's no defenders rushing you at all

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:32.860 
there's no defenders rushing you at all
so<00:05:31.220> you<00:05:31.310> can<00:05:31.490> take<00:05:31.700> as<00:05:31.880> long<00:05:32.120> as<00:05:32.180> you<00:05:32.390> want<00:05:32.660> to

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:32.870 
so you can take as long as you want to

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:36.880 
so you can take as long as you want to
in<00:05:33.470> order<00:05:33.590> to<00:05:33.740> get<00:05:33.950> an<00:05:34.100> open<00:05:34.520> receiver<00:05:34.850> in<00:05:35.890> one

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:36.890 
in order to get an open receiver in one

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:40.840 
in order to get an open receiver in one
of<00:05:37.220> these<00:05:38.000> zones<00:05:38.540> so<00:05:39.080> you<00:05:39.169> can<00:05:39.440> take<00:05:39.650> a<00:05:39.890> minute

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:40.850 
of these zones so you can take a minute

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:42.940 
of these zones so you can take a minute
just<00:05:41.270> let<00:05:41.720> you<00:05:41.840> guys<00:05:42.020> run<00:05:42.050> around<00:05:42.650> and<00:05:42.830> then

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:42.950 
just let you guys run around and then

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:45.190 
just let you guys run around and then
find<00:05:43.310> somebody<00:05:43.640> that's<00:05:43.790> going<00:05:43.910> to<00:05:44.030> be<00:05:44.150> open<00:05:44.660> in

00:05:45.190 --> 00:05:45.200 
find somebody that's going to be open in

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:47.350 
find somebody that's going to be open in
one<00:05:45.770> of<00:05:45.800> the<00:05:45.979> zones<00:05:46.220> and<00:05:46.520> have<00:05:46.820> them<00:05:47.030> catch<00:05:47.210> in

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:47.360 
one of the zones and have them catch in

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.820 
one of the zones and have them catch in
the<00:05:47.479> zone<00:05:47.690> and<00:05:48.140> you<00:05:48.290> can<00:05:48.410> get<00:05:48.530> through<00:05:48.710> that

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:48.830 
the zone and you can get through that

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:52.600 
the zone and you can get through that
one<00:05:49.070> I<00:05:49.310> got<00:05:49.910> to<00:05:50.090> that<00:05:50.210> part<00:05:50.510> three<00:05:51.020> times<00:05:51.320> and<00:05:51.919> I

00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:52.610 
one I got to that part three times and I

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:53.950 
one I got to that part three times and I
pass<00:05:52.880> through<00:05:53.150> it<00:05:53.210> the<00:05:53.300> first<00:05:53.510> time<00:05:53.630> every

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:53.960 
pass through it the first time every

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:57.130 
pass through it the first time every
single<00:05:53.990> time<00:05:54.440> so<00:05:55.280> it's<00:05:55.669> pretty<00:05:56.450> easy<00:05:56.720> and<00:05:57.080> a

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:57.140 
single time so it's pretty easy and a

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:00.400 
single time so it's pretty easy and a
lot<00:05:58.070> of<00:05:58.220> these<00:05:58.310> scenarios<00:05:58.510> for<00:05:59.510> getting<00:06:00.290> a

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:00.410 
lot of these scenarios for getting a

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:02.890 
lot of these scenarios for getting a
certain<00:06:00.710> amount<00:06:00.860> of<00:06:00.979> yardage<00:06:01.430> I<00:06:01.729> have<00:06:02.450> certain

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:02.900 
certain amount of yardage I have certain

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:04.480 
certain amount of yardage I have certain
players<00:06:03.140> so<00:06:03.290> I<00:06:03.380> like<00:06:03.590> to<00:06:03.620> run<00:06:03.919> this<00:06:04.220> play

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:04.490 
players so I like to run this play

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:06.130 
players so I like to run this play
action<00:06:04.700> boot<00:06:05.090> play<00:06:05.360> where<00:06:05.630> you<00:06:05.720> get<00:06:05.840> you<00:06:05.960> two

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:06.140 
action boot play where you get you two

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:07.590 
action boot play where you get you two
tight<00:06:06.410> ends<00:06:06.620> rolling<00:06:06.979> out<00:06:07.100> to<00:06:07.130> the<00:06:07.280> right

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:07.600 
tight ends rolling out to the right

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.850 
tight ends rolling out to the right
usually<00:06:08.600> pretty<00:06:08.840> good<00:06:09.110> that<00:06:09.350> second<00:06:09.740> tight

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:09.860 
usually pretty good that second tight

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:12.360 
usually pretty good that second tight
ends<00:06:10.040> using<00:06:10.220> to<00:06:10.520> pass<00:06:10.729> that<00:06:11.060> first<00:06:11.720> down<00:06:11.930> line

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:12.370 
ends using to pass that first down line

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:17.500 
ends using to pass that first down line
so<00:06:13.370> the<00:06:13.880> level<00:06:14.180> 25<00:06:15.460> boss<00:06:16.460> I'll<00:06:16.910> just<00:06:17.120> described

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:17.510 
so the level 25 boss I'll just described

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:19.659 
so the level 25 boss I'll just described
to<00:06:17.660> you<00:06:17.750> now<00:06:17.900> it's<00:06:18.530> called<00:06:18.830> media<00:06:19.280> day<00:06:19.490> and

there's a bunch of media people on the

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:22.600 
there's a bunch of media people on the
field<00:06:21.320> and<00:06:21.500> some<00:06:21.890> of<00:06:22.010> your<00:06:22.070> teammates<00:06:22.400> your

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:22.610 
field and some of your teammates your

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:23.920 
field and some of your teammates your
teammates<00:06:23.030> aren't<00:06:23.210> gonna<00:06:23.330> help<00:06:23.479> you<00:06:23.660> out<00:06:23.690> at

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:23.930 
teammates aren't gonna help you out at

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:26.530 
teammates aren't gonna help you out at
all<00:06:23.990> in<00:06:24.229> fact<00:06:24.290> they<00:06:25.250> will<00:06:25.550> stop<00:06:26.150> you<00:06:26.360> from

00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:26.540 
all in fact they will stop you from

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:29.560 
all in fact they will stop you from
progressing<00:06:27.140> if<00:06:27.400> you<00:06:28.400> get<00:06:28.640> into<00:06:28.970> them<00:06:29.390> and<00:06:29.510> you

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:29.570 
progressing if you get into them and you

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:31.210 
progressing if you get into them and you
bump<00:06:29.780> into<00:06:29.990> them<00:06:30.200> that's<00:06:30.740> what<00:06:30.890> it<00:06:30.979> says<00:06:31.190> here

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:31.220 
bump into them that's what it says here

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:33.400 
bump into them that's what it says here
so<00:06:32.210> what<00:06:32.360> you<00:06:32.450> want<00:06:32.630> to<00:06:32.690> do<00:06:32.780> is<00:06:32.900> pretty<00:06:33.200> much

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:33.410 
so what you want to do is pretty much

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:36.159 
so what you want to do is pretty much
the<00:06:33.470> same<00:06:33.890> strategy<00:06:34.490> that<00:06:34.640> I<00:06:34.669> had<00:06:35.120> in<00:06:35.390> level<00:06:35.720> 15

00:06:36.159 --> 00:06:36.169 
the same strategy that I had in level 15

00:06:36.169 --> 00:06:38.350 
the same strategy that I had in level 15
get<00:06:36.860> to<00:06:36.979> the<00:06:37.070> left<00:06:37.280> side<00:06:37.460> as<00:06:37.640> far<00:06:37.880> as<00:06:38.060> much<00:06:38.240> as

00:06:38.350 --> 00:06:38.360 
get to the left side as far as much as

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:39.370 
get to the left side as far as much as
possible<00:06:38.539> then

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:39.380 
possible then

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:43.060 
possible then
to<00:06:39.650> the<00:06:39.770> right<00:06:39.950> and<00:06:40.780> evade<00:06:41.780> evade<00:06:42.050> evade<00:06:42.410> and

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:43.070 
to the right and evade evade evade and

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:45.670 
to the right and evade evade evade and
then<00:06:43.730> shut<00:06:44.270> out<00:06:44.390> to<00:06:44.630> the<00:06:44.720> right<00:06:44.900> side<00:06:45.230> and

00:06:45.670 --> 00:06:45.680 
then shut out to the right side and

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:47.350 
then shut out to the right side and
hopefully<00:06:46.220> you<00:06:46.340> can<00:06:46.490> outrun<00:06:46.820> everybody

00:06:47.350 --> 00:06:47.360 
hopefully you can outrun everybody

00:06:47.360 --> 00:06:49.390 
hopefully you can outrun everybody
especially<00:06:47.690> with<00:06:48.020> Reggie<00:06:48.200> Bush<00:06:48.500> it's<00:06:49.130> a<00:06:49.220> lot

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:49.400 
especially with Reggie Bush it's a lot

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:52.630 
especially with Reggie Bush it's a lot
easier<00:06:49.460> than<00:06:50.030> with<00:06:50.120> the<00:06:50.270> slower<00:06:50.540> guy<00:06:50.830> so<00:06:51.830> I<00:06:52.280> got

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:52.640 
easier than with the slower guy so I got

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:55.600 
easier than with the slower guy so I got
to<00:06:52.760> level<00:06:52.910> 33<00:06:53.540> before<00:06:54.200> I<00:06:54.230> failed<00:06:54.680> out<00:06:54.890> my<00:06:55.250> five

to level 33 before I failed out my five
attempts<00:06:56.090> you<00:06:56.150> have<00:06:56.300> five<00:06:56.570> attempts<00:06:57.170> in<00:06:57.770> order
