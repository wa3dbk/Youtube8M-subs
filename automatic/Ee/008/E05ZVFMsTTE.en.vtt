unavoidable<00:03:52.269> became<00:03:52.750> avoidable<00:03:53.500> like<00:03:54.130> this

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
unavoidable became avoidable like this

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.240 
unavoidable became avoidable like this
guy<00:03:55.019> actually<00:03:56.019> this<00:03:56.380> guy<00:03:56.530> was<00:03:56.859> avoidable

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
guy actually this guy was avoidable

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:59.690 
guy actually this guy was avoidable
before<00:03:57.639> it<00:03:57.760> was<00:03:57.819> just<00:03:58.030> a<00:03:58.090> lot<00:03:58.209> bigger<00:03:58.239> pain

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
before it was just a lot bigger pain

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
pointless I think that was originally

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.430 
pointless I think that was originally
some<00:04:34.010> sort<00:04:34.280> of<00:04:34.480> poison<00:04:35.480> here<00:04:35.840> or<00:04:35.990> something

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
some sort of poison here or something

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.090
