00:00:00.539 --> 00:00:03.370
 Hi, I'm Jurek from the driver training center 

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:05.460
 Euphoria 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.199
 Hit this season 

00:00:08.199 --> 00:00:11.279
 is A2 driving license training 

00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:13.999
 I wanted to point out that the rules apply to 

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.720
 this issue 

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:16.139
 normalized 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.119
 I mention that in this category 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:22.019
 is the largest group of students 

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:24.409
 because the minimum age is 

00:00:24.409 --> 00:00:26.269
 Eighteen years 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:28.869
 this includes a motorcycle about 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:30.179
 capacity 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.760
 above 400 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.170
 centimeters and restriction 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.990
 by virtue of 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.969
 up to 35 Kw 

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:39.030
 kilowatts 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.190
 Demonstrated model on which we conduct training 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.470
 A2 category in our school 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:47.280
 this is Honda NC700 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.420
 of a capacity 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.390
 capacity 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.890
 700 cm 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.319
 and power 

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:57.159
 35 Kw 

00:00:57.159 --> 00:00:58.859
 around 50 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.290
 horsepower. 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:03.760
 present 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.500
 you 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.480
 today, support for this motorcycle 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.620
 That's what we should know 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.030
 of these most important things 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.640
 during the state exam 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.590
 Before driving 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.810
 every motorcycle 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.640
 this in particular 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.600
 we have to check the drive system, 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.630
 or 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.100
 deflection of the chain 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.820
 deflection of the chain 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.590
 should 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:32.320
 include the 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.420
 up to 30 millimeters 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.590
 The instruction speaks about it 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:37.510
 this motorcycle 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.310
 be like here 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.920
 Here you are 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.290
 it is visible on the cover 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.340
 chain that up to 30 mm 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.500
 there is a deflection of the chain 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.430
 maximum 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.490
 the chain must be clean, 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:55.910
 greased 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:00.020
 and efficient, these are 3 parameters 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.369
 which must be met 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.120
 so that you can 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.250
 start riding a motorcycle 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.530
 After checking the drive system 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:08.829
 go 

00:02:08.829 --> 00:02:10.979
 to check 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.809
 and demonstration 

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:14.439
 For you lights 

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:16.649
 Ten motocykl motocyklowa od / Hondy / 

00:02:16.649 --> 00:02:19.540
 Yamaha XJ6 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.440
 in that all lights are demonstrated 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.930
 without necessity 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:26.090
 launch 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.279
 motorcycle. 

00:02:28.279 --> 00:02:30.799
 We turn the ignition, 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:33.249
 if we draw a positional light 

00:02:33.249 --> 00:02:35.799
 then we must distinguish them 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:36.370
 Because in a moment 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.419
 we have lit the light today 

00:02:39.419 --> 00:02:42.709
 passing and the position light has turned on 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:45.009
 If we get a position light 

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:47.069
 let's remember that a light bulb 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:49.239
 responsible for the position light 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:52.539
 located at the top of the lamp 

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:55.669
 If we look up from the bottom 

00:02:55.669 --> 00:02:57.519
 it is there 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:59.999
 position light bulb 

00:02:59.999 --> 00:03:02.429
 And with the position light, indicate it 

00:03:02.429 --> 00:03:03.309
 in front of 

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:05.569
 because it determines the position of the motorcycle at the front 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:08.839
 and it is white in the back 

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:09.839
 color 

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:12.409
 red, position light 

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:15.829
 and we must 

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:18.509
 also add that 

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:21.019
 the position light is responsible for 

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:21.760
 license plate backlight 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.950
 If under the license plate 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.030
 We'll look at ourselves 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:30.399
 we have a white light at the back that illuminates us 

00:03:30.399 --> 00:03:32.899
 license plate. 

00:03:32.899 --> 00:03:35.079
 And that is everything 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:36.579
 when it comes to the position light. 

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:38.589
 If we drew the lights 

00:03:38.589 --> 00:03:40.129
 passing 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:41.219
 go 

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:43.909
 back to the front of the motorcycle and we show that 

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:46.139
 light beam 

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:49.149
 it is only and exclusively 

00:03:49.149 --> 00:03:52.049
 This bulb at the front. 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:55.139
 The most common mistake of students is that they go and want to demonstrate 

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:57.949
 low beam at the rear. It is not possible 

00:03:57.949 --> 00:04:00.919
 It will be in the back 

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:01.940
 Yes Yes 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.060
 that is, they want to show that the passing is ahead and behind. 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.940
 Absolutely! Remember that the low beam 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:10.060
 it's only in the front. 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:13.290
 In the front we have the opportunity to change these lights. 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.459
 positional, passing 

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:17.749
 and a traffic light. 

00:04:17.749 --> 00:04:20.719
 The back should be marked 

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:23.199
 that there is a positional light all the time 

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:25.419
 If we draw light or pass 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:27.490
 as it is going to demonstrate at the moment 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.569
 This is the big light bulb 

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:31.849
 or traffic light, 

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:33.729
 let's remember that 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:36.990
 we only show the front. The backlight can be on the back 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.860
 possibly 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.370
 Now we will demonstrate the brake light 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:42.289
 Stop. 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:43.830
 So we're approaching from the right side of the motorcycle 

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:49.279
 We do not have to sit on it. 

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:52.210
 We activate the foot brake with the foot 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:53.659
 and we show 

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:54.710
 that 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:56.569
 it's shining right now 

00:04:56.569 --> 00:04:59.509
 stop light, run 

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:01.919
 from the foot brake. / you can do it again / 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:04.430
 We will demonstrate the Stop light 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:06.870
 We're pressing the right foot with the brake 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:08.080
 pedal 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.600
 The complex light turns on. Stop 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.279
 activated from the brake 

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:15.149
 foot, this is only 

00:05:15.149 --> 00:05:17.560
 half of the answers, because it also belongs 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.350
 indicate that the stop light 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:24.919
 it is activated by a lever on the right side 

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:27.599
 and the brake stop light is also ignited 

00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:29.580
 Czyli ... / you can do it from 2-3 times / 

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:32.490
 And the foot brake once, please 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:35.810
 we release the foot brake, 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:38.830
 and the handbrake is also responsible for the inflammation 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:42.340
 brake lights stop 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:44.680
 Stop 

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:45.770
 With lights 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:48.949
 we can draw on 

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:51.939
 the emergency lights will be turned on 

00:05:51.939 --> 00:05:52.960
 show 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:57.839
 Two at the front 

00:05:57.839 --> 00:06:01.800
 / Once, two front / 

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.729
 emergency light from the right of our side, left 

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:05.750
 we're going back 

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:07.389
 motorcycle 

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:09.409
 Emergency light 

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:11.469
 on the right side at the back 

00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:14.199
 Emergency light left side 

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:16.129
 from the back. We turn off 

00:06:16.129 --> 00:06:17.729
 emergency lights 

00:06:17.729 --> 00:06:20.779
 I will now demonstrate the indicators, 

00:06:20.779 --> 00:06:22.909
 right direction indicator, 

00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:25.919
 We have a responsible control 

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:27.069
 Here you are. 

00:06:27.069 --> 00:06:28.789
 In front of the motorcycle 

00:06:28.789 --> 00:06:31.270
 it is signaled by color 

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:33.789
 orange on the right side 

00:06:33.789 --> 00:06:36.629
 On the back of the motorcycle 

00:06:36.629 --> 00:06:38.909
 on the right side 

00:06:38.909 --> 00:06:41.580
 The direction indicator will be at this moment 

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:43.210
 left 

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:46.249
 Left from the back 

00:06:46.249 --> 00:06:47.419
 Left side 

00:06:47.419 --> 00:06:49.779
 Indicator responsible for the direction indicator 

00:06:49.779 --> 00:06:51.309
 left 

00:06:51.309 --> 00:06:52.990
 and a turn signal at the front 

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:56.899
 left 

00:06:56.899 --> 00:06:59.059
 Turn off the turn signal 

00:06:59.059 --> 00:07:00.729
 With lights 

00:07:00.729 --> 00:07:03.599
 we are still only left 

00:07:03.599 --> 00:07:06.080
 the sound signal that is 

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:08.159
 on the exam attached to the lights 

00:07:08.159 --> 00:07:09.750
 it is launched from the left side 

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:11.259
 through 

00:07:11.259 --> 00:07:13.349
 pressing the lever 

00:07:13.349 --> 00:07:16.110
 After discussing the lights 

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:17.569
 We can draw 

00:07:17.569 --> 00:07:19.020
 one of the fluids to handle
