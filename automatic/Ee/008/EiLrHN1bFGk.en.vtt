thing that will love to point out before

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.630 
thing that will love to point out before
we<00:03:16.260> go<00:03:16.470> into<00:03:16.620> these<00:03:16.800> tests<00:03:17.100> is<00:03:17.220> that<00:03:17.250> this

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
we go into these tests is that this

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.960 
we go into these tests is that this
device<00:03:17.940> right<00:03:18.120> now<00:03:18.180> is<00:03:18.510> not<00:03:18.840> on<00:03:19.020> Wi-Fi<00:03:19.820> as<00:03:20.820> you

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
device right now is not on Wi-Fi as you

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.850 
device right now is not on Wi-Fi as you
can<00:03:21.090> see<00:03:21.180> right<00:03:21.330> here<00:03:21.390> it<00:03:21.660> is<00:03:21.690> on<00:03:21.959> 4G<00:03:22.440> right<00:03:22.650> now

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
can see right here it is on 4G right now

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:24.770 
can see right here it is on 4G right now
so<00:03:23.190> that<00:03:23.550> will<00:03:23.670> give<00:03:23.850> us<00:03:24.000> you<00:03:24.150> know<00:03:24.209> correct

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
so that will give us you know correct

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.390 
so that will give us you know correct
readings<00:03:25.170> and<00:03:25.410> you<00:03:26.010> know<00:03:26.130> without<00:03:26.280> further

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
readings and you know without further

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.970 
readings and you know without further
this<00:03:26.880> let's<00:03:27.209> jump<00:03:27.420> right<00:03:27.570> in<00:03:27.750> and<00:03:27.959> let's<00:03:28.860> go

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
this let's jump right in and let's go

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.440 
this let's jump right in and let's go
ahead<00:03:29.130> and<00:03:29.370> get<00:03:29.489> started<00:03:29.580> so<00:03:29.880> first<00:03:30.150> thing<00:03:30.420> is

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
ahead and get started so first thing is

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:31.880 
ahead and get started so first thing is
let's<00:03:30.900> try<00:03:31.080> the<00:03:31.140> speed<00:03:31.500> test

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
let's try the speed test

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:33.830 
let's try the speed test
okay<00:03:32.130> here<00:03:32.430> we<00:03:32.519> go<00:03:32.580> and<00:03:33.239> then<00:03:33.510> we're<00:03:33.600> gonna<00:03:33.720> go

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
okay here we go and then we're gonna go

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.850 
okay here we go and then we're gonna go
ahead<00:03:33.870> and<00:03:34.050> do<00:03:34.290> a<00:03:34.320> speed<00:03:34.590> test<00:03:34.739> real<00:03:34.980> quick<00:03:36.860> ok

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
ahead and do a speed test real quick ok

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.650 
ahead and do a speed test real quick ok
great<00:03:38.130> so<00:03:38.280> that<00:03:38.580> right<00:03:38.790> there<00:03:38.850> pretty<00:03:39.450> much

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
great so that right there pretty much

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.080 
great so that right there pretty much
gave<00:03:39.900> us<00:03:40.050> you<00:03:40.200> know<00:03:40.320> a<00:03:40.350> reading<00:03:40.650> already<00:03:41.090> first

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
gave us you know a reading already first

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.370 
gave us you know a reading already first
as<00:03:42.330> you<00:03:42.390> can<00:03:42.510> see<00:03:42.720> you<00:03:42.959> know<00:03:43.080> we're<00:03:43.260> having

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
as you can see you know we're having

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.050 
as you can see you know we're having
some<00:03:43.680> you<00:03:43.800> know<00:03:43.890> pretty<00:03:44.190> solid<00:03:44.400> numbers<00:03:44.880> right

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
some you know pretty solid numbers right

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.640 
some you know pretty solid numbers right
there<00:03:45.090> our<00:03:45.720> download

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
there our download

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.940 
there our download
megabits<00:03:47.400> per<00:03:47.459> second<00:03:48.000> clocked<00:03:48.420> in<00:03:48.540> at<00:03:48.690> around

megabits per second clocked in at around

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.399 
megabits per second clocked in at around
16.8<00:03:49.950> I<00:03:50.670> do<00:03:51.239> understand<00:03:51.810> you<00:03:52.049> know<00:03:52.140> certain

00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:52.409 
16.8 I do understand you know certain

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:53.720 
16.8 I do understand you know certain
area<00:03:52.769> will<00:03:52.980> have<00:03:53.069> you<00:03:53.250> know<00:03:53.340> different

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
area will have you know different

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:54.979 
area will have you know different
readings<00:03:54.030> but<00:03:54.180> right<00:03:54.390> now<00:03:54.510> that's<00:03:54.690> a<00:03:54.810> very

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
readings but right now that's a very

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:57.170 
readings but right now that's a very
solid<00:03:55.379> number<00:03:55.709> I'll<00:03:56.250> blow<00:03:56.489> speed<00:03:56.849> is<00:03:57.000> almost

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
solid number I'll blow speed is almost

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.030 
solid number I'll blow speed is almost
the<00:03:57.420> same<00:03:57.540> as<00:03:57.690> sixteen<00:03:58.049> point<00:03:58.260> nine<00:03:58.379> megabits

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
the same as sixteen point nine megabits

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.119 
the same as sixteen point nine megabits
per<00:03:59.099> second<00:03:59.670> okay<00:04:00.120> so<00:04:00.900> what<00:04:01.140> I<00:04:01.230> said<00:04:01.500> you<00:04:02.010> know

00:04:02.119 --> 00:04:02.129 
per second okay so what I said you know

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:04.819 
per second okay so what I said you know
that<00:04:02.849> right<00:04:02.970> there<00:04:03.180> shows<00:04:03.329> you<00:04:03.390> 4G<00:04:04.230> speed

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:04.829 
that right there shows you 4G speed

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:07.039 
that right there shows you 4G speed
right<00:04:05.010> there<00:04:05.250> and<00:04:05.549> some<00:04:05.849> solid<00:04:06.180> numbers<00:04:06.510> okay

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049 
right there and some solid numbers okay

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:09.470 
right there and some solid numbers okay
and<00:04:07.500> next<00:04:08.459> let's<00:04:08.760> go<00:04:08.849> ahead<00:04:08.940> and<00:04:09.209> try<00:04:09.420> the

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
and next let's go ahead and try the

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:14.559 
and next let's go ahead and try the
benchmark<00:04:10.230> test<00:04:10.470> of<00:04:10.620> the<00:04:10.709> n22<00:04:11.340> right<00:04:11.549> here

00:04:14.559 --> 00:04:14.569 

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:16.969 

alright<00:04:15.569> so<00:04:15.840> what<00:04:15.989> the<00:04:16.109> test<00:04:16.350> just<00:04:16.620> finished

00:04:16.969 --> 00:04:16.979 
alright so what the test just finished

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:18.740 
alright so what the test just finished
we<00:04:17.340> could<00:04:17.489> go<00:04:17.579> ahead<00:04:17.729> and<00:04:17.850> take<00:04:18.150> a<00:04:18.180> look<00:04:18.660> at

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
we could go ahead and take a look at

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.240 
we could go ahead and take a look at
some<00:04:18.930> of<00:04:19.019> the<00:04:19.109> ranking<00:04:19.560> and<00:04:19.709> the<00:04:19.919> device
