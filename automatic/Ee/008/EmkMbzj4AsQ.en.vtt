00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:02.930
- [Karine] Rome, quite
possibly, has more beauty

00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:05.600
and history than any other place.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.640
It's a fascinating slice of the Old World,

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.293
with countless treasures
ready to be explored.

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:14.420
I decided to take in the city from

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.800
a different and local point of view,

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.793
enlisting my friend, Claudio,
and his trusty Vespa.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.180
With a cool breeze in our face,

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.733
Rome seemed to unfold before us.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:32.463
Meandering through this
Eternal City was delightful,

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.863
exploring its quiet back streets
and their sweet surprises.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.800
Why do you think people
love the Vespa so much?

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.580
- The people like because is a freedom.

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.443
In Italia, the freedom
is a first for the life.

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.165
- [Karine] Freedom, It really is the best

00:00:53.165 --> 00:00:55.353
word to describe the little Vespa.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.430
Combine that with its unique look,

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.550
and it's easy to understand why more than

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.940
18 million Vespas have been sold

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.453
since its introduction in 1946.

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.400
And why Italians say the Vespa is

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:12.103
not just a scooter, but a way of life.

00:01:13.028 --> 00:01:15.440
(engine revving)

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.887
- [Claudio] The Vespa, it's
a very beautiful design.

00:01:19.887 --> 00:01:23.020
- Well that's, of course,
what Italy is famous for,

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:28.020
great design, and the Vespa
hasn't really changed.

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.230
- No change because, (mumbles),
the design is perfect.

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:34.899
It's impossible to change.

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:37.050
(laughing)

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:39.100
- [Karine] Claudio wasn't kidding.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.900
The Italians won't change
a design that works.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.280
In fact, the Vespa is still so loved

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.673
there's even a museum
honoring its character.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.820
Brain-child of Piaggio, a retooled

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.220
World War II aircraft company,

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.400
the Vespa included clear
aeronautical influences,

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.140
and an intriguing design
that when first shown

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.747
to Enrico Piaggio,
caused him to burst out,

00:02:00.747 --> 00:02:02.367
"Sembra una vespa!

00:02:02.367 --> 00:02:03.937
"It looks like a wasp!"

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.670
Many think it sounds like a
wasp too, and so the name stuck

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.190
and the company cobbled together

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.853
a scooter utilizing everything at hand.

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.920
- The first tradition is only green,

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.850
because it's the mix for
the epoxy in the war.

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.980
They used the same paint.

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.710
- So, the Vespa was created to allow

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.540
Italians to get around their cities.

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.920
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
after the second war,

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.420
about whole family go in the Vespa.

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.648
Five people, together.
- On this size?

00:02:35.648 --> 00:02:37.070
- Yes, yes.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.130
- [Karine] The Vespa became
a hit, nimbly navigating

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.233
through Italy's war-ravaged
cities and countryside.

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.468
Then, with the 1953
movie, "Roman Holiday",

00:02:48.468 --> 00:02:52.630
Rome and the Vespa captured
everyone's imagination.

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.730
- It's a dream, you know?

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.838
You have the sound.

00:02:56.838 --> 00:02:58.250
(Claudio buzzing)

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:59.083
- Yeah, yes.

00:02:59.083 --> 00:03:00.740
- The high condition,
- Yeah.

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:02.700
- and the very beautiful city.

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.240
It's perfect.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.940
- When you are driving
around town on a Vespa,

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.249
what does it make you feel like?

00:03:09.249 --> 00:03:13.891
- It's incredible, the Vespa,
for me, is the first love.

00:03:13.891 --> 00:03:15.715
(laughing)

00:03:15.715 --> 00:03:19.720
- And you love your Vespa so much,

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.860
you're writing songs to it!

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.399
- I compose the opera for Vespa.

00:03:24.399 --> 00:03:25.232
- You're composing an opera

00:03:25.232 --> 00:03:27.083
for your Vespa?
- Yeah, yes.

00:03:27.083 --> 00:03:30.833
(Claudio singing in Italian)

00:03:32.482 --> 00:03:34.732
(humming)

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:42.010
- [Karine] Rome is a fascinating city

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:44.183
that will truly take your breath away.

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.883
And the Vespa is just one
way to explore its beauty.

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:54.500
(opera singer vocalizing)

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.570
This is a city awash in cultural

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:58.707
treasures and fascinating people.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.760
I hope you'll go out and
enjoy its many wonders.

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.665
(engine buzzing)
