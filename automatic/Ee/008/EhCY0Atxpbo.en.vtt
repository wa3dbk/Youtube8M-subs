00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.830
 who would say that in this urban street of 

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:06.870
 the capital there is a house with the 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.049
 vineyard of the largest grapes in the whole 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.049
 Department 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:18.400
 started 12 years ago that I planted a 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.500
 matta is amethyst was growing growing 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.619
 As you grow and would kill her 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.939
 growing up as I no longer have patio here in 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:27.250
 the house I did not find what to do with 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:29.469
 so much grape that was growing then what 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.570
 what happened to me was to do it up on 

00:00:29.469 --> 00:00:33.730
 roof of the house that is a 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:36.190
 vineyard in the middle of the capital city is all 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.140
 a novelty but that develops in the 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.090
 roof of the entire house leaves the 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.820
 curious people fascinated by this strange 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:47.230
 way to grow grapes are vd species 

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:49.540
 of Israelite origin this grape is a bit 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.790
 I work a little better than the other grape 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:54.130
 normal because this grape and Israelite's 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.570
 this grape is produced in the desert is 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:58.180
 that's why you can work like this 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.920
 different in the normal grape of equipment is 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:03.340
 necessary to be able after each 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:09.060
 harvest for later comes the fumigada 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:12.700
 for the insects and then you see the fertilizer 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:15.310
 and so that she returns to give her harvest 

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.920
 this is a fruit that usually in 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.480
 Nicaragua imports into the markets its 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.490
 price per pound is high 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:23.620
 but for do not know rosales this is 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:26.200
 practice to which he has devoted more than 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.070
 15 years leaves you in addition to a great 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.680
 satisfaction 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:32.110
 good economic returns began 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.330
 first with a one-year crop of a 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.520
 quintal then raised to three quintals 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.100
 then it went up to 10 quintals when 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:42.130
 went up to 10 quintals I was glad 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:44.980
 then already after 78 years of 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.630
 have the grape discover a secret and 

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:49.330
 when I discovered that secret that was 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.280
 the one that gave me the album as it says of 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:54.190
 produce from 10 quintals to 30 quintals 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.770
 and from one crop per year to 3 crops per 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.810
 year these grapes are used for 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.300
 preparation of juices that when combined 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.400
 with other medicinal species are not 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.440
 vis rosales recipes to their patients in 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.800
 a clinic that also administers in the 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.990
 capital is prepared in a juice in a juice 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.860
 special is the juice we already have a 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:16.330
 added value to that juice we make a 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.930
 component I call them bold home 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:22.360
 mullein we miss this anise 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.920
 we take chamomile and prepare a 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.959
 based drug 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.610
 grape juice this medicine is 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.709
 wonderful for those people who 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.300
 they have fatty liver for those who have 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:32.950
 if rossi raised cholesterol 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:36.010
 triglycerides renal failure 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.630
 obesity problems this case we 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.430
 shows that in the courtyard of our 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.040
 houses many times we waste 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.500
 great options to entertain us and 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.989
 especially making good money like
