to get him over aggressive right down to

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.870 
to get him over aggressive right down to
the<00:04:04.140> seconds<00:04:04.680> before<00:04:04.980> the<00:04:05.100> fight<00:04:05.280> and<00:04:05.489> during

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
the seconds before the fight and during

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.110 
the seconds before the fight and during
the<00:04:06.000> fight<00:04:06.209> he<00:04:06.660> is<00:04:06.930> very<00:04:07.350> good<00:04:07.530> he<00:04:08.250> is<00:04:08.760> for<00:04:09.090> real

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
the fight he is very good he is for real

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.150 
the fight he is very good he is for real
and<00:04:09.480> I<00:04:09.570> think<00:04:09.959> he<00:04:10.169> is<00:04:10.200> still<00:04:10.650> getting<00:04:10.829> better

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
and I think he is still getting better

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.069 
and I think he is still getting better
and<00:04:11.430> he<00:04:11.639> believes<00:04:12.060> man<00:04:12.480> he<00:04:12.660> thinks<00:04:12.840> it's

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:13.079 
and he believes man he thinks it's

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:14.600 
and he believes man he thinks it's
manifest<00:04:13.560> destiny<00:04:13.769> that<00:04:14.400> he

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
manifest destiny that he

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.580 
manifest destiny that he
just<00:04:14.760> gonna<00:04:14.880> march<00:04:15.210> in<00:04:15.420> here<00:04:15.480> own<00:04:16.019> the<00:04:16.410> title

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
just gonna march in here own the title

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.680 
just gonna march in here own the title
and<00:04:16.920> so<00:04:17.100> far<00:04:17.370> there's<00:04:17.609> no<00:04:17.880> real<00:04:18.180> reason<00:04:18.420> to

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
and so far there's no real reason to

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.050 
and so far there's no real reason to
doubt<00:04:18.930> him<00:04:19.140> and<00:04:19.350> to<00:04:19.560> me<00:04:19.680> it's<00:04:20.220> a<00:04:20.310> credit<00:04:20.700> to<00:04:20.910> the

Cruz<00:04:32.610> coming<00:04:33.060> back<00:04:33.240> that<00:04:33.570> was<00:04:33.690> a<00:04:33.720> real<00:04:34.110> test

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:34.440 
Cruz coming back that was a real test

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.440 
Cruz coming back that was a real test
against<00:04:34.950> Takeya<00:04:35.220> Mizugaki<00:04:35.310> and<00:04:36.030> sure<00:04:36.270> there

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:36.450 
against Takeya Mizugaki and sure there

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:38.990 
against Takeya Mizugaki and sure there
was<00:04:36.600> some<00:04:36.750> risk<00:04:36.990> also<00:04:37.470> a<00:04:37.890> lot<00:04:38.280> of<00:04:38.430> reward<00:04:38.790> to

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
was some risk also a lot of reward to

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.790 
was some risk also a lot of reward to
that<00:04:39.150> when<00:04:39.360> Conor<00:04:39.570> McGregor<00:04:39.990> beats<00:04:40.230> a<00:04:40.380> Dustin

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
that when Conor McGregor beats a Dustin

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.370 
that when Conor McGregor beats a Dustin
Poirier<00:04:41.130> it<00:04:41.580> really<00:04:41.970> does<00:04:42.120> legitimize<00:04:42.780> him<00:04:43.050> to

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:43.380 
Poirier it really does legitimize him to

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.500 
Poirier it really does legitimize him to
those<00:04:43.590> that<00:04:43.890> are<00:04:44.010> not<00:04:44.430> sold<00:04:44.790> on<00:04:45.000> the<00:04:45.150> guy<00:04:45.270> and<00:04:45.450> I

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.510 
those that are not sold on the guy and I

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:48.320 
those that are not sold on the guy and I
