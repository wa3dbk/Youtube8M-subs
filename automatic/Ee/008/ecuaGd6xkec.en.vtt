00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:42.670 
be a slightly different build than what

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.000 
be a slightly different build than what
I<00:00:42.699> did<00:00:42.820> in<00:00:42.999> the<00:00:43.300> regular<00:00:43.449> Mesa<00:00:44.170> set<00:00:44.710> up<00:00:44.829> where

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.010 
I did in the regular Mesa set up where

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.220 
I did in the regular Mesa set up where
you<00:00:45.100> can<00:00:45.280> run<00:00:45.429> that<00:00:45.609> solo<00:00:46.120> where<00:00:46.839> you<00:00:46.899> can<00:00:47.050> run

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:47.230 
you can run that solo where you can run

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.259 
you can run that solo where you can run
that<00:00:47.379> as<00:00:47.530> a<00:00:47.559> team<00:00:47.859> when<00:00:48.579> you're<00:00:48.730> utilizing

00:00:49.259 --> 00:00:49.269 
that as a team when you're utilizing

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:51.869 
that as a team when you're utilizing
this<00:00:49.390> mate<00:00:49.780> muzzle<00:00:50.379> flash<00:00:50.589> it's<00:00:51.280> purely<00:00:51.760> a

00:00:51.869 --> 00:00:51.879 
this mate muzzle flash it's purely a

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:54.660 
this mate muzzle flash it's purely a
team<00:00:52.300> setup<00:00:53.109> it<00:00:53.350> will<00:00:53.409> not<00:00:53.800> work<00:00:54.039> when<00:00:54.489> you're

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:54.670 
team setup it will not work when you're

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:56.910 
team setup it will not work when you're
by<00:00:54.819> yourself<00:00:54.850> so<00:00:55.749> just<00:00:55.809> keep<00:00:56.230> that<00:00:56.260> in<00:00:56.469> mind

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:56.920 
by yourself so just keep that in mind

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:02.880 
by yourself so just keep that in mind
okay<00:00:57.749> so<00:00:59.909> basically<00:01:01.379> before<00:01:02.379> switching<00:01:02.710> to

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:02.890 
okay so basically before switching to

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:04.380 
okay so basically before switching to
another<00:01:03.159> player<00:01:03.460> the<00:01:03.489> muzzle<00:01:03.969> flash<00:01:03.999> will

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:04.390 
another player the muzzle flash will

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:08.190 
another player the muzzle flash will
emit<00:01:04.750> a<00:01:05.409> blinding<00:01:06.220> flash<00:01:06.600> with<00:01:07.600> up<00:01:07.870> to<00:01:08.020> 8

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200

meters<00:01:08.620> and<00:01:08.890> up<00:01:09.460> to<00:01:09.610> 7<00:01:09.970> seconds<00:01:10.450> of<00:01:11.320> blinding

00:01:11.999 --> 00:01:12.009 
meters and up to 7 seconds of blinding

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:14.399 
meters and up to 7 seconds of blinding
us<00:01:12.189> basically<00:01:12.460> okay<00:01:13.240> so<00:01:13.299> this<00:01:13.509> is<00:01:13.689> it's<00:01:14.110> pretty

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:14.409 
us basically okay so this is it's pretty

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:16.649 
us basically okay so this is it's pretty

a CC setup where you can still take
everything<00:01:34.630> out<00:01:34.810> now<00:01:35.560> what<00:01:36.100> I've<00:01:36.219> done<00:01:36.280> is<00:01:36.490> as

everything out now what I've done is as

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:38.969 
everything out now what I've done is as
you<00:01:37.329> can<00:01:37.479> see<00:01:37.659> it's<00:01:37.990> only<00:01:38.109> about<00:01:38.289> 3<00:01:38.680> to<00:01:38.799> 4

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:38.979 
you can see it's only about 3 to 4

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:41.069 
you can see it's only about 3 to 4
seconds<00:01:39.430> in<00:01:39.609> between<00:01:39.729> each<00:01:40.180> player<00:01:40.509> in<00:01:40.840> this

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:41.079 
seconds in between each player in this

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:42.990 
seconds in between each player in this
video<00:01:41.320> and<00:01:41.799> we're<00:01:42.159> going<00:01:42.280> to<00:01:42.340> talk<00:01:42.520> about<00:01:42.549> that

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
video and we're going to talk about that

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.380 
video and we're going to talk about that
how<00:01:43.270> we<00:01:43.329> do<00:01:43.570> that<00:01:44.130> in<00:01:45.130> the<00:01:45.460> build<00:01:45.759> here<00:01:46.030> in<00:01:46.060> just

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
how we do that in the build here in just

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.179 
how we do that in the build here in just
one<00:01:46.600> second<00:01:47.049> and<00:01:47.200> it's<00:01:47.469> very<00:01:47.680> important

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:48.189 
one second and it's very important

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:50.910 
one second and it's very important
basically<00:01:48.820> to<00:01:49.000> kill<00:01:49.210> your<00:01:49.390> duration<00:01:49.750> in<00:01:50.140> no

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:50.920 
basically to kill your duration in no

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.919 
basically to kill your duration in no
other<00:01:51.100> way<00:01:51.219> of<00:01:51.340> putting<00:01:51.789> that<00:01:51.939> so<00:01:52.570> that<00:01:52.750> way

00:01:52.919 --> 00:01:52.929 
other way of putting that so that way

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:55.679 
other way of putting that so that way
you<00:01:52.990> can<00:01:53.619> get<00:01:53.979> the<00:01:54.219> most<00:01:54.429> out<00:01:54.729> of<00:01:54.820> this<00:01:55.060> mod<00:01:55.390> to

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:55.689 
you can get the most out of this mod to

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:57.510 
you can get the most out of this mod to
consistently<00:01:56.350> switch<00:01:56.649> between<00:01:56.890> each<00:01:57.219> player

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
consistently switch between each player

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.389 
consistently switch between each player
but<00:01:58.149> you<00:01:58.270> want<00:01:58.450> to<00:01:58.509> definitely<00:01:58.630> have

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
but you want to definitely have

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.499 
but you want to definitely have
efficiency<00:02:00.399> going<00:02:00.700> as<00:02:00.820> well<00:02:01.030> because<00:02:01.359> you're

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
efficiency going as well because you're

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:03.690 
efficiency going as well because you're
gonna<00:02:01.600> be<00:02:01.750> utilizing<00:02:02.380> this<00:02:02.530> multiple<00:02:03.399> times

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
gonna be utilizing this multiple times

focusing at all

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.360 
focusing at all
on<00:02:21.060> duration<00:02:21.390> I<00:02:21.629> do<00:02:21.870> not<00:02:22.049> want<00:02:22.290> duration<00:02:22.799> we

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
on duration I do not want duration we

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.280 
on duration I do not want duration we
want<00:02:23.640> the<00:02:23.760> muzzle<00:02:24.120> flash<00:02:24.150> to<00:02:24.599> be<00:02:24.689> put<00:02:24.930> to<00:02:25.110> its

want the muzzle flash to be put to its

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.679 
want the muzzle flash to be put to its
most<00:02:25.620> use<00:02:25.890> and<00:02:26.129> of<00:02:26.220> course<00:02:26.400> that<00:02:27.000> does<00:02:27.239> a<00:02:27.360> burst

00:02:27.679 --> 00:02:27.689 
most use and of course that does a burst

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:31.640 
most use and of course that does a burst
before<00:02:28.530> switching<00:02:28.980> between<00:02:29.310> players<00:02:30.650> within

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
blinds enemies for a few seconds okay so

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.009 
blinds enemies for a few seconds okay so
in<00:02:37.920> order<00:02:38.250> to<00:02:38.430> make<00:02:38.640> this<00:02:38.849> work<00:02:38.909> really<00:02:39.810> really

in order to make this work really really
good<00:02:40.230> we<00:02:40.799> have<00:02:40.950> to<00:02:41.040> kill<00:02:41.370> that<00:02:41.400> duration<00:02:42.120> and

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:42.329 
good we have to kill that duration and

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:44.210 
good we have to kill that duration and
as<00:02:42.629> you<00:02:42.870> probably<00:02:43.230> saw<00:02:43.409> in<00:02:43.650> the<00:02:43.769> video<00:02:44.010> footage

00:03:11.899 --> 00:03:11.909 
you're gonna constantly be popping that

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:14.330 
you're gonna constantly be popping that
blinding<00:03:12.450> flash<00:03:12.750> and<00:03:13.139> it's<00:03:13.799> gonna<00:03:13.920> stop<00:03:14.159> those

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
blinding flash and it's gonna stop those

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.640 
blinding flash and it's gonna stop those
enemies<00:03:14.700> but<00:03:14.940> at<00:03:15.540> least<00:03:15.840> when<00:03:16.260> somebody<00:03:16.530> gets

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
enemies but at least when somebody gets

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.440 
enemies but at least when somebody gets
into<00:03:16.950> a<00:03:16.980> situation<00:03:17.220> you're<00:03:17.819> there<00:03:18.090> it's<00:03:18.299> only

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
into a situation you're there it's only

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.059 
into a situation you're there it's only
three<00:03:18.720> four<00:03:18.900> seconds<00:03:19.290> in<00:03:19.379> between<00:03:19.650> each<00:03:19.799> other

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069 
three four seconds in between each other

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:23.720 
three four seconds in between each other
boom<00:03:20.700> it<00:03:21.000> hits<00:03:21.510> it<00:03:21.750> moves<00:03:22.049> on<00:03:22.260> boom<00:03:22.739> it<00:03:23.069> hits<00:03:23.220> on

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
boom it hits it moves on boom it hits on

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:25.759 
boom it hits it moves on boom it hits on
it's<00:03:23.909> kind<00:03:24.090> of<00:03:24.150> like<00:03:24.269> that<00:03:24.420> but<00:03:24.720> overall<00:03:25.500> we're

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
it's kind of like that but overall we're

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:28.970 
it's kind of like that but overall we're
gonna<00:03:25.859> keep<00:03:26.129> the<00:03:27.470> efficiency<00:03:28.470> of<00:03:28.620> course

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
gonna keep the efficiency of course

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.500 
gonna keep the efficiency of course
because<00:03:29.310> we<00:03:29.340> still<00:03:29.639> need<00:03:29.699> it<00:03:29.910> for<00:03:30.030> peacemaker

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
because we still need it for peacemaker

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.509 
because we still need it for peacemaker
we<00:03:30.690> want<00:03:30.900> the<00:03:31.019> efficiency<00:03:31.530> we<00:03:32.010> also<00:03:32.190> want<00:03:32.430> the

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
we want the efficiency we also want the

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:34.309 
we want the efficiency we also want the
efficiency<00:03:33.000> to<00:03:33.090> be<00:03:33.150> able<00:03:33.329> to<00:03:33.419> utilize<00:03:33.569> muzzle

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:34.319 
efficiency to be able to utilize muzzle

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:36.559 
efficiency to be able to utilize muzzle
flash<00:03:34.560> with<00:03:35.430> the<00:03:35.459> shooting<00:03:35.879> gallery<00:03:36.060> feature

00:03:36.559 --> 00:03:36.569 
flash with the shooting gallery feature

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:39.770 
flash with the shooting gallery feature
as<00:03:36.930> well<00:03:37.260> so<00:03:37.620> the<00:03:38.400> more<00:03:38.549> efficient<00:03:38.940> we<00:03:39.030> are<00:03:39.239> the

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
as well so the more efficient we are the

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.629 
as well so the more efficient we are the
more<00:03:40.049> we<00:03:40.109> can<00:03:40.470> utilize<00:03:40.889> this<00:03:41.040> because<00:03:41.370> we<00:03:41.489> will

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:41.639 
more we can utilize this because we will

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:43.430 
more we can utilize this because we will
use<00:03:41.669> it<00:03:42.120> a<00:03:42.150> lot<00:03:42.449> because<00:03:42.660> we<00:03:42.900> took<00:03:43.049> down<00:03:43.199> the

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
use it a lot because we took down the

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.280 
use it a lot because we took down the
duration<00:03:44.129> of<00:03:44.280> course<00:03:45.120> intensifies<00:03:45.780> stays<00:03:46.079> on

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
duration of course intensifies stays on

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:49.430 
duration of course intensifies stays on
for<00:03:46.319> power<00:03:46.709> strength<00:03:47.250> for<00:03:47.639> us<00:03:48.260> we're<00:03:49.260> gonna<00:03:49.319> go
