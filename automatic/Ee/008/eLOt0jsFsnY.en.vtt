00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
then you'll get this this square hole

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.160 
then you'll get this this square hole
covered<00:00:48.210> with<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.420> dirts<00:00:48.629> now<00:00:48.870> we<00:00:48.930> have<00:00:49.079> to

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
covered with the dirts now we have to

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.040 
covered with the dirts now we have to
power<00:00:49.410> up<00:00:49.789> so<00:00:50.789> we<00:00:50.910> need<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.090> put<00:00:51.270> redstone

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
power up so we need to put redstone

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.819 
power up so we need to put redstone
repeaters<00:00:52.620> there<00:00:53.030> redstone<00:00:54.030> repeaters<00:00:54.420> there

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:54.829 
repeaters there redstone repeaters there

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:59.569 
repeaters there redstone repeaters there
at<00:00:55.829> this<00:00:56.760> end<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:57.239> once<00:00:57.539> you<00:00:57.660> on<00:00:57.780> this<00:00:57.899> end<00:00:58.579> now

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
at this end and once you on this end now

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:00.709 
at this end and once you on this end now
these<00:00:59.760> ones<00:01:00.030> here<00:01:00.210> are<00:01:00.270> going<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.510> have<00:01:00.600> to<00:01:00.660> be

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
these ones here are going to have to be

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.490 
these ones here are going to have to be
set<00:01:00.930> to<00:01:00.960> full<00:01:01.469> delay<00:01:02.840> this<00:01:03.840> is<00:01:04.019> to<00:01:04.110> ensure<00:01:04.140> that

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
set to full delay this is to ensure that

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.980 
set to full delay this is to ensure that
these<00:01:05.100> bottom<00:01:05.640> Pistons<00:01:07.490> grab<00:01:08.490> on<00:01:08.729> to<00:01:09.450> these

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
these bottom Pistons grab on to these

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.870 
these bottom Pistons grab on to these
other<00:01:10.409> bottom<00:01:10.799> Pistons<00:01:11.159> when<00:01:11.340> they<00:01:11.460> push<00:01:11.670> out

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
other bottom Pistons when they push out

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.850 
other bottom Pistons when they push out
and<00:01:12.720> once<00:01:12.900> you've<00:01:13.020> done<00:01:13.080> that<00:01:13.140> you<00:01:13.530> just<00:01:13.740> need

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
and once you've done that you just need

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.350 
and once you've done that you just need
to<00:01:13.920> lay<00:01:14.070> your<00:01:14.250> redstone<00:01:14.520> circuit<00:01:14.850> around<00:01:15.180> the

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
to lay your redstone circuit around the
