better<00:04:08.500> bad

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:14.550 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:17.610 

think<00:04:15.550> one<00:04:15.760> great<00:04:16.060> advantage<00:04:16.630> of<00:04:17.019> post-rock

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
think one great advantage of post-rock

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:22.230 
think one great advantage of post-rock
is<00:04:17.830> it's<00:04:18.370> just<00:04:18.880> melody<00:04:19.060> a<00:04:19.620> lot<00:04:20.620> of<00:04:20.709> people<00:04:21.240> like

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
is it's just melody a lot of people like

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.090 
is it's just melody a lot of people like
positive<00:04:22.960> music<00:04:23.290> even<00:04:23.620> though<00:04:23.710> we<00:04:23.830> wouldn't

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.100 
positive music even though we wouldn't

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.910 
positive music even though we wouldn't
have<00:04:24.250> thought<00:04:24.700> so<00:04:24.760> so<00:04:25.500> even<00:04:26.500> if<00:04:26.740> they're

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:26.920 
have thought so so even if they're

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:30.240 
have thought so so even if they're
listening<00:04:27.100> to<00:04:27.420> either<00:04:28.420> metal<00:04:29.080> or<00:04:29.290> indie<00:04:29.890> stuff

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
listening to either metal or indie stuff

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:33.180 
listening to either metal or indie stuff
it's<00:04:30.840> some<00:04:31.840> kind<00:04:32.050> of<00:04:32.110> universal<00:04:32.380> it's<00:04:32.920> not

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
it's some kind of universal it's not

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.880 
it's some kind of universal it's not
that<00:04:33.940> you<00:04:34.060> have<00:04:34.090> the<00:04:34.390> screaming<00:04:35.020> which<00:04:35.260> many

that you have the screaming which many
people<00:04:36.220> don't<00:04:36.430> like<00:04:36.490> or<00:04:37.180> I<00:04:37.240> was<00:04:37.600> really

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
people don't like or I was really

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.360 
people don't like or I was really
surprised<00:04:38.260> when<00:04:38.500> when<00:04:38.860> I<00:04:38.890> saw<00:04:39.130> how<00:04:39.310> many

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:41.950 
people actually liked that kind of music

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.430 
people actually liked that kind of music
like<00:04:42.730> when<00:04:42.910> you<00:04:42.970> see<00:04:43.150> the<00:04:43.240> people<00:04:43.540> with<00:04:43.720> eyes

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:44.440 
like when you see the people with eyes

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:47.370 
like when you see the people with eyes

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:29.920 
something really different so that one
wouldn't<00:05:27.710> just<00:05:28.460> say<00:05:28.700> oh<00:05:28.730> it's<00:05:29.060> the<00:05:29.540> typical

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:29.930
