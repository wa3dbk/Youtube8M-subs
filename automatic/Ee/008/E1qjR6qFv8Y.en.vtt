can<00:00:43.050> be<00:00:43.079> safe<00:00:43.500> I<00:00:43.710> like<00:00:44.010> that<00:00:44.340> thought<00:00:44.670> this<00:00:44.940> is

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
can be safe I like that thought this is

don't<00:01:31.920> have<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.130> pricing<00:01:32.520> information<00:01:32.640> but<00:01:33.299> I

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
don't have the pricing information but I

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.069 
don't have the pricing information but I
think<00:01:34.020> they<00:01:34.439> said<00:01:34.680> it<00:01:34.799> has<00:01:34.979> two<00:01:35.479> Intel<00:01:36.479> SSDs

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
think they said it has two Intel SSDs

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.440 
think they said it has two Intel SSDs
inside<00:01:37.560> which<00:01:37.799> means<00:01:38.040> big<00:01:38.369> space<00:01:38.670> big<00:01:39.150> speed

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
inside which means big space big speed
