parts like you don't like skidding along
the<00:00:58.410> lip<00:00:58.640> then<00:00:59.640> you<00:00:59.999> can<00:01:00.179> start<00:01:00.480> off<00:01:00.690> on<00:01:00.929> like

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
the lip then you can start off on like

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.329 
the lip then you can start off on like
an<00:01:01.499> elbow<00:01:01.679> hip<00:01:03.350> because<00:01:04.350> it's<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.860> little<00:01:05.250> bit

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
an elbow hip because it's a little bit

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.070 
an elbow hip because it's a little bit
easier<00:01:05.460> because<00:01:05.909> their<00:01:06.300> angle<00:01:06.690> of<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.870> hip

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
easier because their angle of the hip

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.660 
easier because their angle of the hip
you're<00:01:07.380> already<00:01:07.560> kind<00:01:07.920> of<00:01:08.040> like<00:01:08.220> in<00:01:08.460> that

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
you're already kind of like in that

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.390 
you're already kind of like in that
position<00:01:08.909> you<00:01:09.720> want<00:01:09.870> a<00:01:09.930> roll<00:01:10.200> at<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.860> hip<00:01:11.100> I

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
position you want a roll at the hip I

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.970 
position you want a roll at the hip I
give<00:01:12.150> you<00:01:12.270> practice<00:01:12.780> jump<00:01:13.080> in<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.350> hip<00:01:13.560> like

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:13.980 
give you practice jump in the hip like

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:18.140 
give you practice jump in the hip like
just<00:01:14.610> maybe<00:01:15.570> by<00:01:15.930> like<00:01:16.230> a<00:01:16.260> foot<00:01:16.820> and<00:01:17.820> whatnot

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
just maybe by like a foot and whatnot

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.580 
just maybe by like a foot and whatnot
first<00:01:19.190> and<00:01:20.190> then<00:01:20.810> you<00:01:21.810> want<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.110> go<00:01:22.230> just<00:01:22.470> a

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
first and then you want to go just a

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.830 
first and then you want to go just a
tiny<00:01:22.860> bit<00:01:23.160> slower<00:01:23.370> than<00:01:23.730> that<00:01:23.760> as<00:01:24.090> you<00:01:24.480> roll<00:01:24.810> up

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
tiny bit slower than that as you roll up

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.640 
tiny bit slower than that as you roll up
to<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:26.280> corner<00:01:26.670> of<00:01:26.760> the<00:01:26.850> hip<00:01:27.230> so<00:01:28.230> let<00:01:28.500> your

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
to the corner of the hip so let your

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.760 
to the corner of the hip so let your
front<00:01:28.890> wheel<00:01:29.100> come<00:01:29.400> out<00:01:29.580> and<00:01:29.910> then<00:01:30.900> you<00:01:31.740> just

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
front wheel come out and then you just

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.040 
front wheel come out and then you just
basically<00:01:32.190> kind<00:01:32.880> of<00:01:32.940> just<00:01:33.180> let<00:01:33.630> your<00:01:33.840> back

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.050 
basically kind of just let your back

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.080 
basically kind of just let your back
wheel<00:01:34.290> like<00:01:34.320> slide<00:01:35.040> you<00:01:35.310> can<00:01:35.460> kind<00:01:35.670> of<00:01:35.730> pull<00:01:35.970> on

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
wheel like slide you can kind of pull on

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.870 
wheel like slide you can kind of pull on
the<00:01:36.210> handlebars<00:01:36.690> a<00:01:36.810> little<00:01:37.050> bit<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.560> just<00:01:38.430> let

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
the handlebars a little bit and just let

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.140 
the handlebars a little bit and just let
the<00:01:39.030> back<00:01:39.210> wheel<00:01:39.450> slide<00:01:39.990> over<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.680> coping

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150 
the back wheel slide over the coping

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.400 
the back wheel slide over the coping
obviously<00:01:42.150> not<00:01:42.330> pulling<00:01:42.660> too<00:01:42.870> much<00:01:42.900> because

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:43.410 
obviously not pulling too much because

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:45.830 
obviously not pulling too much because
when<00:01:43.560> you're<00:01:43.710> slip<00:01:43.980> out<00:01:44.190> and<00:01:44.580> then<00:01:45.390> really

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
when you're slip out and then really

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.540 
when you're slip out and then really
like<00:01:46.110> just<00:01:46.380> let<00:01:46.530> it<00:01:46.650> slide<00:01:46.920> for<00:01:46.980> a<00:01:47.250> bit<00:01:47.400> and

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:47.550 
like just let it slide for a bit and

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.420 
like just let it slide for a bit and
then<00:01:47.670> it<00:01:47.790> should<00:01:48.030> naturally<00:01:48.360> by<00:01:48.960> itself<00:01:49.350> -<00:01:49.740> you

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
then it should naturally by itself - you

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.970 
then it should naturally by itself - you
just<00:01:50.670> roll<00:01:50.940> it<00:01:51.180> you<00:01:51.510> know<00:01:51.660> like<00:01:51.930> you've<00:01:52.200> put<00:01:52.860> on

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:52.980 
just roll it you know like you've put on

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:54.170 
just roll it you know like you've put on
the<00:01:53.070> handlebars<00:01:53.520> a<00:01:53.640> bit<00:01:53.850> and

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
the handlebars a bit and

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.860 
the handlebars a bit and
as<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.930> back<00:01:55.080> ends<00:01:55.410> slide<00:01:55.710> you<00:01:55.980> saw<00:01:56.210> let<00:01:57.210> let

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:57.870 
as the back ends slide you saw let let

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:59.630 
as the back ends slide you saw let let
the<00:01:57.990> pressure<00:01:58.260> off<00:01:58.500> a<00:01:58.530> bit<00:01:58.860> and<00:01:59.070> then<00:01:59.490> your

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
the pressure off a bit and then your

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.250 
the pressure off a bit and then your
front<00:01:59.880> will<00:02:00.060> should<00:02:00.270> drop<00:02:00.480> in<00:02:00.720> the<00:02:00.900> back<00:02:01.080> will

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:01.260 
front will should drop in the back will

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.380 
front will should drop in the back will
just<00:02:01.530> kind<00:02:01.740> of<00:02:01.860> follow<00:02:02.670> you<00:02:02.910> into<00:02:03.090> the

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
just kind of follow you into the

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.540 
just kind of follow you into the
transition<00:02:04.050> when<00:02:04.560> you<00:02:04.740> step<00:02:05.070> up<00:02:05.220> to<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.460> core

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:05.550 
transition when you step up to the core

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:10.130 
transition when you step up to the core
pipe<00:02:06.800> the<00:02:07.800> only<00:02:08.070> real<00:02:08.460> difference<00:02:08.850> I<00:02:09.390> find<00:02:09.780> is

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
pipe the only real difference I find is

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.240 
pipe the only real difference I find is
that<00:02:11.270> your<00:02:12.270> your<00:02:12.959> angle<00:02:13.560> that<00:02:13.740> you<00:02:13.890> hit<00:02:14.130> the

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
that your your angle that you hit the

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.340 
that your your angle that you hit the
quarter<00:02:14.550> pipe<00:02:14.760> is<00:02:15.060> different<00:02:15.870> to<00:02:16.020> when<00:02:16.200> you

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
quarter pipe is different to when you

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:18.440 
quarter pipe is different to when you
hit<00:02:16.560> the<00:02:16.709> overhead<00:02:17.040> you<00:02:17.790> need<00:02:18.000> to<00:02:18.150> carve

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
hit the overhead you need to carve

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.449 
hit the overhead you need to carve
across<00:02:18.750> the<00:02:19.200> quarter<00:02:19.500> pipe<00:02:19.650> like<00:02:20.070> as<00:02:20.280> if

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
across the quarter pipe like as if

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:22.430 
across the quarter pipe like as if
you're<00:02:20.640> gonna<00:02:20.790> like<00:02:21.060> just<00:02:21.390> air<00:02:21.660> it<00:02:21.959> like<00:02:22.140> you

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
you're gonna like just air it like you

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.920 
you're gonna like just air it like you
know<00:02:22.560> a<00:02:22.590> couple<00:02:22.890> of<00:02:23.040> inches<00:02:23.190> out<00:02:23.550> on<00:02:24.480> a<00:02:24.540> quarter

know a couple of inches out on a quarter
pipe<00:02:25.110> you<00:02:25.290> pull<00:02:25.590> more<00:02:25.890> and<00:02:26.280> push<00:02:26.520> so<00:02:27.209> you<00:02:27.300> pull

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
pipe you pull more and push so you pull

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.900 
pipe you pull more and push so you pull
more<00:02:27.750> your<00:02:27.989> handlebars<00:02:28.440> and<00:02:29.130> push<00:02:29.400> from<00:02:29.550> all

the top of the core if you're having

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.350 
the top of the core if you're having
issues<00:02:34.800> where<00:02:35.310> you're<00:02:35.459> kind<00:02:35.640> of<00:02:35.760> man<00:02:36.030> you<00:02:36.180> lean

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
issues where you're kind of man you lean

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.990 
issues where you're kind of man you lean
a<00:02:36.600> bit<00:02:37.110> as<00:02:37.590> opposed<00:02:37.980> to<00:02:38.100> sliding<00:02:38.459> and<00:02:38.880> you're

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
a bit as opposed to sliding and you're

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.300 
a bit as opposed to sliding and you're
probably<00:02:39.270> going<00:02:39.690> a<00:02:39.840> bit<00:02:39.989> fast<00:02:40.290> you<00:02:41.160> know<00:02:41.280> I

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
probably going a bit fast you know I

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.370 
probably going a bit fast you know I
mean<00:02:41.610> because<00:02:43.790> essentially<00:02:44.790> I<00:02:45.090> mean<00:02:45.930> you<00:02:46.230> can

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
mean because essentially I mean you can

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.979 
mean because essentially I mean you can
do<00:02:46.530> those<00:02:47.060> sweet<00:02:48.060> ones<00:02:48.360> where<00:02:48.660> you're<00:02:48.780> almost

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
do those sweet ones where you're almost

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.229 
do those sweet ones where you're almost
like<00:02:49.320> tabled<00:02:49.920> you<00:02:50.100> know<00:02:50.250> like<00:02:50.610> and<00:02:50.850> that's

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
like tabled you know like and that's

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:52.970 
like tabled you know like and that's
obvious<00:02:51.540> here<00:02:51.690> again<00:02:52.080> a<00:02:52.110> bit<00:02:52.410> more<00:02:52.620> advanced

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
obvious here again a bit more advanced

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.530 
obvious here again a bit more advanced
but<00:02:54.650> when<00:02:55.650> you're<00:02:55.830> starting<00:02:56.190> out<00:02:56.540> essentially

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
but when you're starting out essentially

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.539 
but when you're starting out essentially
your<00:02:57.840> front<00:02:58.140> wheels<00:02:58.380> almost<00:02:58.620> lower<00:02:59.130> than<00:02:59.430> the

00:02:59.539 --> 00:02:59.549 
your front wheels almost lower than the

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:01.550 
your front wheels almost lower than the
coping<00:03:00.030> you<00:03:00.390> know<00:03:00.510> I<00:03:00.540> mean<00:03:00.870> like<00:03:01.110> you're<00:03:01.320> kind

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
coping you know I mean like you're kind

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.270 
coping you know I mean like you're kind
of<00:03:01.709> dragging<00:03:02.340> your<00:03:02.489> back<00:03:02.670> row<00:03:02.910> over<00:03:03.180> so<00:03:04.049> if<00:03:04.620> you

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
of dragging your back row over so if you

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.979 
of dragging your back row over so if you
if<00:03:05.640> you're<00:03:05.850> ending<00:03:06.030> up<00:03:06.239> in<00:03:06.360> a<00:03:06.450> manual<00:03:06.810> you're

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
if you're ending up in a manual you're

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:09.080 
if you're ending up in a manual you're
probably<00:03:07.200> going<00:03:07.470> too<00:03:07.680> fast<00:03:07.890> so<00:03:08.580> I<00:03:08.610> will<00:03:08.880> just

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
probably going too fast so I will just

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.080 
probably going too fast so I will just
slow<00:03:09.330> down<00:03:09.360> a<00:03:09.570> little<00:03:09.840> bit

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
slow down a little bit

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.090 
slow down a little bit
yeh
