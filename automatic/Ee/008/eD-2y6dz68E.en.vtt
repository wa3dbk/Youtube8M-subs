 holder in on the island and here the daniel 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:10.230
 and today we 're wondering where 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:12.420
 the girls gamers to the staff complaining 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.639
 some time ago that the wok beans 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.970
 gameplay was right I'll let the tokyo 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:20.070
 Nikkei background but it is not the view, not obvious 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:25.039
 we do not have cnet 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:28.019
 but it 's only for those who will follow Pedro good 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:30.269
 night a bag these days I see the people 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.130
 I was watching a bingo channel girl face 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:34.950
 who plays videogame and everything else 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:37.350
 is the channel of the Goiano goal 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:42.050
 which is quite interesting even and she made a 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.050
 question that I found very insightful 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:51.649
 very pertinent also what kind what is 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:55.230
 what would be the traits in the 

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:57.809
 characteristics of the perfect person a 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.660
 for example, the person can achieve 

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.539
 know and so I thought whoa I like 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.729
 gamer who is who never wanted to find 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.650
 a girl who plays videogame who has the 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:14.790
 same formal addictions 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:16.770
 I had only go to market that is the 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.130
 face that I for example taking the jÃºlia 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:23.040
 I know if I plus two is very kind 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.369
 so man this is very little do you know 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.369
 I think 

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:32.429
 33 like to throw trash like that on my 

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:35.789
 college face to room is 90% women 

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:38.909
 watch any channel why not 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:42.020
 Do you like video games and like those suckers? 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.020
 sting academies 

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:49.860
 that's for sure already crossed over 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.950
 everybody at times very new nista 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.689
 and gradually talk a little beyond the 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:59.310
 episode no one wants to follow the game 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:01.020
 Is Daddy me? Me too. 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.709
 the girls that there can be no game 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.840
 because he had an important agenda will be 

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:09.720
 important to play video games like this is 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.420
 seal complete your boyfriend dodi 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:19.349

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:21.829
 filling the bag or I do not know the gas does not play 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:21.829
 together 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:30.870
 what would be the characteristics of 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:33.329
 a possible pair for the meeting that 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.340
 Do you care more for a boy who likes 

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:43.019
 To play video games is a girl who likes to 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:45.989
 anime for example what is law and average 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:48.090
 The more detached the cefor ends 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:50.459
 making it harder for you to find a 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:53.190
 girl that's the way I do not have it any more 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:03:04.980
 boyfriend and girls who do not like 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:03:07.319
 this kind of thing, for example debt 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.840
 shock send a try try 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:12.840
 something is because besides being super 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.880
 fun with the super face rpg videogame 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:17.190
 playful you learn a lot doing everything 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.560
 This and whether or not you want a 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.200
 has 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.040
 the differential as this ends up being the 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.040
 sorry 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:28.209
 one level above the others is not 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:39.989
 But what would be the 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:39.989
 singers if you think it's cool to notice 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:45.970
 that seems to have something common 

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.920
 that things together, and play for 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.620
 For example, there is a friend of mine who 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.690
 girlfriend will play and he understood 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.000

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.769
 even playing never played that much 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.260
 smaller more beautiful 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:04:00.370
