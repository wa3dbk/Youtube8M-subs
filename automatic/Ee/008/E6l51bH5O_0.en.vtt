you<00:02:31.190> think<00:02:32.380> honestly<00:02:33.380> honestly<00:02:33.950> I<00:02:34.310> don't<00:02:34.400> know

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
you think honestly honestly I don't know

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.000 
you think honestly honestly I don't know
you<00:02:35.390> try<00:02:35.600> to<00:02:35.630> try<00:02:35.900> to<00:02:35.959> think<00:02:36.200> like<00:02:36.320> a<00:02:36.470> damn<00:02:36.800> but

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
you try to try to think like a damn but

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.530 
you try to try to think like a damn but
at<00:02:37.130> the<00:02:37.250> end<00:02:37.280> of<00:02:37.400> the<00:02:37.489> day<00:02:37.610> I<00:02:37.640> never<00:02:37.910> been<00:02:38.120> one

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
at the end of the day I never been one

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.430 
at the end of the day I never been one
so<00:02:39.290> you<00:02:40.010> know<00:02:40.130> that<00:02:40.310> it's<00:02:41.380> hopefully<00:02:42.380> they

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
so you know that it's hopefully they

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.229 
so you know that it's hopefully they
just<00:02:42.590> looking<00:02:42.769> for<00:02:42.890> a<00:02:42.950> player<00:02:43.160> who<00:02:43.550> contribute

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 
just looking for a player who contribute

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:47.229 
just looking for a player who contribute
and<00:02:44.860> nobody<00:02:45.860> knows<00:02:46.070> it's<00:02:46.340> a<00:02:46.489> it's<00:02:46.730> not<00:02:46.850> only

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
and nobody knows it's a it's not only

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:49.090 
and nobody knows it's a it's not only
basketball<00:02:47.750> too<00:02:47.900> as<00:02:48.019> a<00:02:48.050> business<00:02:48.530> side<00:02:48.709> to<00:02:48.950> the

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:49.100 
basketball too as a business side to the

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.220 
basketball too as a business side to the
whole<00:02:49.250> ordeal<00:02:49.670> so<00:02:50.000> it's<00:02:50.390> not<00:02:50.540> just<00:02:50.630> about<00:02:50.870> six

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
whole ordeal so it's not just about six

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.710 
whole ordeal so it's not just about six
or<00:02:51.320> seven<00:02:51.500> maybe<00:02:51.769> they<00:02:52.070> go<00:02:52.489> back<00:02:52.730> maybe<00:02:53.510> they

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
or seven maybe they go back maybe they

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.050 
or seven maybe they go back maybe they
trade<00:02:54.170> for<00:02:54.380> pick<00:02:54.590> nobody<00:02:54.739> knows<00:02:55.130> but<00:02:55.459> that's

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
trade for pick nobody knows but that's

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.400 
trade for pick nobody knows but that's
why<00:02:56.239> it's<00:02:56.390> important<00:02:56.750> to<00:02:56.840> just<00:02:57.019> come<00:02:57.230> in<00:02:57.380> and

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
why it's important to just come in and

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.530 
why it's important to just come in and
compete<00:02:57.620> and<00:02:58.100> because<00:02:58.970> you<00:02:59.060> never<00:02:59.209> know<00:02:59.329> how

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
compete and because you never know how

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.300 
compete and because you never know how
things<00:02:59.570> tend<00:03:00.170> to<00:03:00.200> work<00:03:00.260> out<00:03:00.590> you<00:03:00.829> know<00:03:01.010> they

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:01.310 
things tend to work out you know they

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:02.770 
things tend to work out you know they
could<00:03:01.489> be<00:03:01.610> six<00:03:01.850> one<00:03:02.090> day<00:03:02.269> and<00:03:02.390> then<00:03:02.540> end<00:03:02.690> up

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
could be six one day and then end up

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.960 
could be six one day and then end up
