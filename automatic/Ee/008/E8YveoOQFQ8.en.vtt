00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:10.220
 in this chapter we will give you some 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.630
 suggestions that will help you thread 

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:14.550
 your machine properly 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.250
 following the instructions that are in 

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:18.670
 your manual will see that it is very easy to thread 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.490
 the 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:23.610
 the coil of the machine is wound before 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:26.400
 to prepare the machine 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:29.460
 this process varies depending on the 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.470
 sewing machine model check the 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.850
 instructive of your machine to know 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.980
 what is the right process for her 

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.890
 however the following rules 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:42.050
 apply for all models when 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.000
 place the thread on the machine use the 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.250
 cover of the spool holder suitable for 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.070
 size of the thread spool that is 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.589
 using if your spool of thread has a 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:54.110
 slit on the shore make sure that the 

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:56.360
 Reel tip is on the right for 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:59.019
 that the thread does not get stuck while you're 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.019
 lifting up 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:07.160
 use only the coils recommended by your 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.760
 manufacturer does not replace them with styles 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:12.130
 different or your machine will not know 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:15.070
 correctly 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:17.590
 make sure that the winder shaft is 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:20.170
 completely to the left before 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.939
 of placing the coil be sure to 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.240
 place the coil in the machine 

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:27.909
 correctly according to your manual if 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:30.600
 bad coil placed not sewing machine 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:33.509
 adequately 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.439
 We recommend you to download the thread only in 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.439
 empty coils 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:45.140
 although the machines vary from one model 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.380
 to another there are certain aspects that are 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.820
 common in the threading of the machine 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.710
 follow the manual of your machine for the 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:54.850
 rest of the process of threading your 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.850
 specific model 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:07.540
 first of all be sure to upload the 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.850
 press lever fabrics before 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:12.580
 start threading this is very 

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:15.730
 important because if you do not do the thread 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.680
 you will not have the proper attention step 1 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.690
 to thread your machine will always be 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:23.270
 lift the press fabrics 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:26.240
 turn the steering wheel to raise the needle to 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:28.490
 its highest position when placing the 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.560
 Thread spool on the machine use the 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:32.720
 reel bra with measurements 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.450
 suitable for the spool of thread that 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.580
 is using if the spool of thread has 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:40.550
 a slit at the tip make sure 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:43.450
 the tip is on the right so it does not 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.450
 atorara alcocer 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.920
 if you are using a spool of thread in 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.959
 Cone shape is recommended to place the 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.599
 thread in the vertical spool holder 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:57.319
 located behind the machine to 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:03:00.980
 improve results 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:03.469
 90% of the work you will do will be 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:08.200
 with attention in auto mode or in 

00:03:03.469 --> 00:03:08.200
 automatic as indicated in its instructions 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.620
 The result of the sewing is 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:17.170
 generally the combination between 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.910
 operation and attention of both 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.640
 origins of threads 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:24.100
 for straight posture the attention is 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.310
 adequate when the points are secured 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:28.800
 to the center correctly 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:31.349
 If the seam appears irregular , 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.450
 you will have to adjust the attention only 

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:35.400
 do it when you are sure that you 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.260
 correctly placed the thread in the 

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.090
 sewing machine 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.819
 if the bobbin thread is opening 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:44.489
 in the upper seam or the fabric is 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:47.519
 being bent you will have to lower the level 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:49.860
 of tension if the thread is being seen in 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:53.360
 the bottom of the fabric will have to 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.360
 raise the level of tension 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:59.690
 these tension adjustments will have to 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:02.200
 always be done with the press fabrics 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:02.200
 down 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.540
 Thread builds up on the bottom of 

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:18.940
 the fabric will mean that the machine 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:21.579
 sewing has not been threaded in the way 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.920
 correct for more information about 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:26.560
 this topic can go to the chapter of 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:28.849
 maintenance and troubleshooting 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.639
 this dvd 

00:04:28.849 --> 00:04:33.919
 for zig zag or decorative stitches 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:36.919
 the attention must be less than in 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:38.899
 Straight stitching will achieve a better result 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:41.449
 if the lower thread appears in the 

00:04:38.899 --> 00:04:43.899
 ends of the points for this type of 

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:43.899
 seams 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:49.010
 the tension of the coil was adjusted 

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:52.419
 from the factory so it does not require 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:52.419
 that is adjusted by you 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:58.220
 when threading the machine lift the needle 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:00.349
 to its highest position by turning the 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:03.590
 steering wheel in the opposite direction to 

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:06.740
 clock hands place the needle in 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:09.080
 the central position always think about the 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:12.500
 needle from front to back and pull the 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:14.930
 Thread back approximately 15 to 18 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:17.539
 centimeters this will ensure that the 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:19.669
 machine does not sit down when it starts 

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:22.729
 to sew because the thread has 

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:25.219
 some machines were too short 

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:27.560
 they have the function of the ensartador 

00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:31.280
 automatic to help skewer the 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:34.250
 needle quickly and effortlessly to 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:36.530
 use the automatic ensartador press 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:38.780
 the skewer lever bringing the 

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:41.150
 skew mechanism to the position in 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:42.259
 that the hook will go directly into the 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:46.370
 needle hole 

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:50.050
 the thread for around the thread and 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:50.050
 after down the hook 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:56.370
 in some models this process is still 

00:05:55.229 --> 00:05:58.020
 faster 

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:01.409
 because they have this system of 

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:03.240
 Thread that will do it for you verify 

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:06.650
 the manual of your machine for more 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:06.650
 information about your model 

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:12.249
 the ensartador is automatic work 

00:06:09.819 --> 00:06:15.580
 better with needles of number 14 or more 

00:06:12.249 --> 00:06:19.120
 large for needles number 11 or more 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:21.520
 small as well as twin needle or needles 

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:24.659
 for hem it is recommended to string 

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.659
 the thread manually 

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:31.680
 taking out the thread from the coil 

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:34.800
 before you start sewing you need to take out 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:37.170
 the thread of the coil to achieve it with 

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:40.710
 your left hand stop the end of the 

00:06:37.170 --> 00:06:42.690
 and the flyer wants it to you or in 

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:45.840
 contrary to the hands of the 

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:47.130
 movement clock that will lower and raise the 

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:49.860
 needle 

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:53.250
 when turning the steering wheel pull 

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:55.530
 Gently thread the needle the thread 

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:59.010
 of the coil will come out through the 

00:06:55.530 --> 00:07:00.780
 Needle plate hole slide the 

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:03.810
 threads through the press slots 

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:06.540
 fabrics later with what both threads 

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:09.810
 down the press fabrics and pull them towards 

00:07:06.540 --> 00:07:12.690
 back some machines have a 

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:15.420
 system where the bobbin thread is 

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:18.270
 pulls automatically when you start sewing 

00:07:15.420 --> 00:07:20.910
 If your machine has this system of 

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:23.550
 Threading or spooling means no 

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:26.970
 it will be necessary to extract the thread from the 

00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:29.180
 coil before you start sewing the 

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:32.180
 machine make the thread by you 

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:32.180
 automatically
