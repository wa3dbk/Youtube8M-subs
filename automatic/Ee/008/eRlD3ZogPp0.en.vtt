like<00:02:53.390> the<00:02:53.420> fact<00:02:53.750> that<00:02:53.930> it<00:02:54.110> really<00:02:54.560> does<00:02:54.860> leave

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
like the fact that it really does leave

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.820 
like the fact that it really does leave
your<00:02:55.310> hair<00:02:55.489> feeling<00:02:55.519> very<00:02:56.030> clean<00:02:56.420> so<00:02:57.230> um<00:02:57.440> I

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
your hair feeling very clean so um I

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
naturally curly hair and I think it's

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.729 
naturally curly hair and I think it's
really<00:03:02.090> about<00:03:02.360> having<00:03:02.600> to<00:03:02.870> test<00:03:03.170> it<00:03:03.350> out<00:03:03.440> and

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
really about having to test it out and

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:06.670 
really about having to test it out and
see<00:03:03.980> what<00:03:04.310> method<00:03:04.850> works<00:03:05.060> best<00:03:05.390> for<00:03:05.510> what<00:03:05.840> your

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:06.680 
see what method works best for what your

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.729 
see what method works best for what your
hair<00:03:06.920> type<00:03:07.160> is<00:03:07.400> but<00:03:08.360> um<00:03:08.540> I<00:03:09.760> truly<00:03:10.760> believe<00:03:11.030> in

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
hair type is but um I truly believe in

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:14.560 
hair type is but um I truly believe in
twisting<00:03:12.739> the<00:03:12.860> hair<00:03:13.040> and<00:03:13.190> letting<00:03:13.340> it<00:03:13.489> dry<00:03:13.700> not

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:14.570 
twisting the hair and letting it dry not

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:16.390 
twisting the hair and letting it dry not
touching<00:03:14.989> the<00:03:15.110> hair<00:03:15.290> in<00:03:15.590> between<00:03:15.829> the<00:03:16.190> time

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400 
touching the hair in between the time

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.190 
touching the hair in between the time
that<00:03:16.430> you<00:03:16.790> put<00:03:17.000> the<00:03:17.090> product<00:03:17.450> in<00:03:17.540> and<00:03:17.870> it<00:03:17.959> dries

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
that you put the product in and it dries

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.890 
that you put the product in and it dries
at<00:03:18.350> least<00:03:18.530> 90%<00:03:19.180> I<00:03:20.180> don't<00:03:20.989> do<00:03:21.290> any<00:03:21.470> type<00:03:21.769> of<00:03:22.900> you

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900
