so<00:01:34.920> good<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.430> in<00:01:35.490> some<00:01:35.700> ways<00:01:35.850> it<00:01:36.090> was<00:01:36.439> not

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
so good and in some ways it was not

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.109 
so good and in some ways it was not
better<00:01:37.710> than<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.100> last<00:01:38.340> of<00:01:38.490> us<00:01:38.579> but<00:01:38.700> it<00:01:38.790> was<00:01:38.909> it

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
better than the last of us but it was it

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:40.310 
better than the last of us but it was it
was<00:01:39.240> great<00:01:39.390> because<00:01:39.600> it<00:01:39.720> was<00:01:39.900> just<00:01:40.140> such<00:01:40.290> a

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
was great because it was just such a

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.590 
was great because it was just such a
condensed<00:01:40.799> story<00:01:41.130> that<00:01:41.759> fit<00:01:42.090> in<00:01:42.210> perfectly

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
condensed story that fit in perfectly

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.969 
condensed story that fit in perfectly
with<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.869> rest<00:01:42.899> of<00:01:43.079> the<00:01:43.170> narrative<00:01:43.500> that<00:01:43.770> even

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
with the rest of the narrative that even

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.090 
with the rest of the narrative that even
if<00:01:44.040> you<00:01:44.159> hadn't<00:01:44.490> played<00:01:45.350> the<00:01:46.350> main<00:01:46.590> campaign

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
if you hadn't played the main campaign

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.010 
if you hadn't played the main campaign
and<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.369> main<00:01:47.520> story<00:01:47.850> then<00:01:48.570> you<00:01:48.600> could<00:01:48.840> jump

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
and the main story then you could jump

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.889 
and the main story then you could jump
into<00:01:49.170> there<00:01:49.439> and<00:01:49.649> would<00:01:49.740> make<00:01:49.890> you<00:01:50.149> it<00:01:51.149> made<00:01:51.720> to

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
into there and would make you it made to

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.560 
into there and would make you it made to
me<00:01:52.079> have<00:01:52.380> the<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:53.399> main<00:01:53.640> game<00:01:53.970> have<00:01:54.329> more

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
me have the the main game have more

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:55.819 
me have the the main game have more
weight<00:01:54.750> to<00:01:54.780> it<00:01:54.960> because<00:01:55.259> of<00:01:55.380> some<00:01:55.500> stuff<00:01:55.680> that

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
weight to it because of some stuff that

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.280 
weight to it because of some stuff that
plays<00:01:56.009> in<00:01:56.600> because<00:01:57.600> essentially<00:01:57.990> it's<00:01:58.229> a

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
plays in because essentially it's a

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.399 
plays in because essentially it's a
prequel<00:01:59.210> so<00:02:00.210> that<00:02:00.360> was<00:02:00.509> that<00:02:00.689> was<00:02:00.869> you<00:02:01.320> know

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
prequel so that was that was you know

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.060 
prequel so that was that was you know
two<00:02:01.850> fantastic<00:02:02.850> ways<00:02:03.180> to<00:02:03.299> start<00:02:03.540> off<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:03.750> year

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
two fantastic ways to start off the year

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.230 
two fantastic ways to start off the year
and<00:02:05.070> I<00:02:05.250> loved<00:02:05.520> playing<00:02:05.670> the<00:02:05.790> remastered

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
and I loved playing the remastered

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.529 
and I loved playing the remastered
version<00:02:06.270> to<00:02:06.719> see<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.950> last<00:02:08.129> of<00:02:08.340> us<00:02:08.429> being<00:02:08.729> you

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
know 60 frames 1080p whatever but it

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.490 
know 60 frames 1080p whatever but it
wasn't<00:02:12.780> just<00:02:12.840> this<00:02:13.020> cosmic

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
wasn't just this cosmic

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:14.850 
thing there was so much of that world

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.970 
thing there was so much of that world
and<00:02:15.180> so<00:02:15.240> much<00:02:15.360> other<00:02:15.480> experience<00:02:16.080> that<00:02:16.410> was

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
and so much other experience that was

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.950 
and so much other experience that was
made<00:02:17.220> up<00:02:17.370> of<00:02:17.520> the<00:02:17.670> environment<00:02:18.270> and<00:02:18.390> I<00:02:18.570> spent

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
made up of the environment and I spent

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.330 
made up of the environment and I spent
more<00:02:19.080> time<00:02:19.140> just<00:02:19.440> exploring<00:02:19.920> more<00:02:20.160> than<00:02:20.280> I

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
more time just exploring more than I

like<00:05:01.530> a<00:05:01.759> grayscale<00:05:02.759> model<00:05:03.150> but<00:05:03.569> we're

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:03.690 
like a grayscale model but we're

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:05.210 
like a grayscale model but we're
building<00:05:04.169> it<00:05:04.289> right<00:05:04.440> now<00:05:04.590> so<00:05:04.770> this<00:05:04.860> actually

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:05.220 
building it right now so this actually

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.760 
building it right now so this actually
exists<00:05:05.900> and<00:05:06.900> so<00:05:07.169> it's<00:05:07.380> like<00:05:07.470> Christmas

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:07.770

morning<00:05:07.800> every<00:05:08.130> time<00:05:08.280> I<00:05:08.340> get<00:05:08.400> a<00:05:08.520> game<00:05:08.729> because

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.030 
morning every time I get a game because

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.029

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:26.809 
idiot stroke of genius that they had was
actually<00:05:24.900> run<00:05:25.349> live<00:05:25.800> code<00:05:26.129> of<00:05:26.340> the<00:05:26.430> Nemesis
