00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
you're an IT guy you know you need to

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.940

remotely or your desktops and your
machines<00:00:16.800> i<00:00:17.220> think<00:00:17.250> is<00:00:17.699> SH<00:00:18.090> is<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:18.539> way<00:00:18.660> to<00:00:18.720> go

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
machines i think is SH is the way to go

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.490 
machines i think is SH is the way to go
I'm<00:00:19.289> not<00:00:19.890> getting<00:00:20.250> paid<00:00:20.430> to<00:00:20.880> advertise<00:00:21.500> for

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
I'm not getting paid to advertise for

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.710 
I'm not getting paid to advertise for
them<00:00:22.680> but<00:00:23.130> I'm<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:24.000> different<00:00:24.330> tools<00:00:24.480> I've

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
them but I'm the different tools I've

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.109 
them but I'm the different tools I've
tried<00:00:25.019> that<00:00:25.470> this<00:00:26.099> one<00:00:26.310> is<00:00:26.430> a<00:00:26.460> good<00:00:26.670> one<00:00:26.730> it

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
tried that this one is a good one it

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.659 
tried that this one is a good one it
works<00:00:27.599> on<00:00:27.750> both<00:00:27.890> iphone<00:00:28.890> and<00:00:29.269> ipad<00:00:30.619> and<00:00:31.669> it

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
works on both iphone and ipad and it

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.000 
works on both iphone and ipad and it
does<00:00:33.090> a<00:00:33.120> pretty<00:00:33.329> good<00:00:33.480> job<00:00:33.660> I've<00:00:34.620> seen<00:00:34.860> other

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
does a pretty good job I've seen other

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.979 
does a pretty good job I've seen other
ones<00:00:35.280> that<00:00:35.309> do<00:00:35.489> a<00:00:35.520> good<00:00:35.820> job<00:00:35.880> too<00:00:36.300> but<00:00:36.630> I<00:00:36.690> like

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
ones that do a good job too but I like

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.819 
ones that do a good job too but I like
the<00:00:37.230> fact<00:00:37.380> that<00:00:37.559> this<00:00:37.800> one<00:00:38.210> does<00:00:39.210> a<00:00:39.239> tunnel<00:00:39.899> SSH

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
the fact that this one does a tunnel SSH

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.549 
the fact that this one does a tunnel SSH
tunnel<00:00:40.860> then<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.850> VNC<00:00:42.149> so<00:00:42.989> you<00:00:43.050> don't<00:00:43.290> have<00:00:43.379> to

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
tunnel then the VNC so you don't have to

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.220 
tunnel then the VNC so you don't have to
create<00:00:43.829> a<00:00:43.890> connection<00:00:44.780> through<00:00:45.780> any<00:00:45.989> other

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
create a connection through any other

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.459 
create a connection through any other
tool<00:00:46.469> first<00:00:46.920> I<00:00:47.219> can<00:00:47.480> you<00:00:48.480> know<00:00:48.570> it<00:00:48.719> will<00:00:48.870> ss8

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
tool first I can you know it will ss8

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.889 
tool first I can you know it will ss8
jen<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:49.950> then<00:00:50.390> port<00:00:51.390> ford<00:00:52.730> 5900<00:00:53.730> or<00:00:53.940> 5901<00:00:54.539> or

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
jen and then port ford 5900 or 5901 or

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.619 
jen and then port ford 5900 or 5901 or
whatever<00:00:55.140> you're<00:00:55.379> using<00:00:56.329> to<00:00:57.329> make<00:00:57.449> your

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
whatever you're using to make your

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.650 
whatever you're using to make your
connection<00:00:58.170> so<00:00:58.770> I'm<00:00:58.949> going<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.660> already

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
connection so I'm going to already

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.139 
connection so I'm going to already
preset<00:01:00.930> my<00:01:01.710> passwords<00:01:02.489> and<00:01:02.609> everything's<00:01:02.940> for

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
preset my passwords and everything's for

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.539 
preset my passwords and everything's for
this<00:01:03.239> video<00:01:03.539> so<00:01:03.840> I'm<00:01:03.960> gonna<00:01:04.110> do<00:01:04.530> connect<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.430> my

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
this video so I'm gonna do connect to my

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:16.880 
this video so I'm gonna do connect to my
Mac<00:01:06.260> here<00:01:07.260> and<00:01:07.500> show<00:01:07.650> you<00:01:07.710> that<00:01:07.920> one

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.110 

so<00:01:17.490> there's<00:01:17.670> my<00:01:17.820> mac<00:01:18.440> desktop<00:01:19.440> I<00:01:19.770> can<00:01:20.729> zoom<00:01:20.940> it

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:21.120 
so there's my mac desktop I can zoom it

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.950 
so there's my mac desktop I can zoom it
down<00:01:21.950> so<00:01:22.950> you<00:01:23.040> can<00:01:23.159> see<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.460> whole<00:01:23.960> screen

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
down so you can see the whole screen

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.810 
down so you can see the whole screen
there<00:01:25.229> you<00:01:25.890> know<00:01:26.010> everything<00:01:26.369> shows<00:01:26.580> up

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
there you know everything shows up

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.590 
there you know everything shows up
pretty<00:01:27.090> nicely<00:01:27.390> um<00:01:29.360> drag<00:01:30.360> that<00:01:30.390> out<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.900> way

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
pretty nicely um drag that out the way

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:44.480 
pretty nicely um drag that out the way
yeah

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.510 

so<00:01:45.090> I<00:01:45.119> mean<00:01:45.299> it<00:01:45.450> is<00:01:45.810> a<00:01:45.840> little<00:01:46.229> tricky<00:01:46.680> because

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
so I mean it is a little tricky because

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.330 
so I mean it is a little tricky because
you're<00:01:47.970> using<00:01:48.210> a<00:01:48.390> touch<00:01:48.630> interface<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:50.189> do

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
you're using a touch interface to do

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.530 
you're using a touch interface to do
something<00:01:50.670> that<00:01:50.759> you<00:01:50.820> would<00:01:51.060> normally<00:01:51.180> do

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
something that you would normally do

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.410 
something that you would normally do
with<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.869> mouse<00:01:52.110> so<00:01:52.759> it<00:01:53.759> can<00:01:54.000> be<00:01:54.149> a<00:01:54.180> little

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
with the mouse so it can be a little

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.149 
with the mouse so it can be a little
difficult<00:01:54.600> and<00:01:55.140> there's<00:01:55.320> a<00:01:55.409> little<00:01:55.680> delay<00:01:55.860> in

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
difficult and there's a little delay in

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.370 
difficult and there's a little delay in
the<00:01:56.189> response<00:01:56.399> that<00:01:56.820> you<00:01:57.000> don't<00:01:57.180> know<00:01:57.330> what<00:01:58.229> it

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
the response that you don't know what it

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.740 
the response that you don't know what it
is<00:01:58.530> that<00:01:58.860> you<00:01:59.070> know<00:01:59.159> you've<00:01:59.460> typed<00:02:00.119> on<00:02:00.390> and

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
is that you know you've typed on and

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.929 
is that you know you've typed on and
largely<00:02:01.409> this<00:02:01.680> is<00:02:01.830> due<00:02:02.009> to<00:02:02.039> the<00:02:02.340> connection

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
largely this is due to the connection

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.719 
largely this is due to the connection
that<00:02:03.470> you<00:02:04.470> have<00:02:04.740> is<00:02:04.979> you<00:02:05.220> know<00:02:05.310> it's<00:02:05.429> not<00:02:05.549> going

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
that you have is you know it's not going

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.469 
that you have is you know it's not going
to<00:02:05.820> be<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.710> fastest<00:02:07.710> thing<00:02:08.369> if<00:02:08.610> you're<00:02:08.759> doing

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
to be the fastest thing if you're doing

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.630 
to be the fastest thing if you're doing
SSH<00:02:10.019> over<00:02:10.380> Wi-Fi<00:02:10.679> or<00:02:11.310> even<00:02:12.060> over<00:02:12.269> 3g<00:02:12.870> so<00:02:13.640> you

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
SSH over Wi-Fi or even over 3g so you

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.430 
SSH over Wi-Fi or even over 3g so you
know<00:02:14.730> but<00:02:15.000> you<00:02:15.150> can<00:02:15.420> do<00:02:15.870> what<00:02:15.959> you<00:02:15.989> need<00:02:16.170> to<00:02:16.260> do

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:16.440 
know but you can do what you need to do

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:22.400 
know but you can do what you need to do
I<00:02:16.650> prefer<00:02:17.280> to<00:02:17.790> use<00:02:18.569> the<00:02:20.269> you<00:02:21.269> know<00:02:21.360> SSH<00:02:22.019> and<00:02:22.290> do

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
I prefer to use the you know SSH and do

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.440 
I prefer to use the you know SSH and do
whatever<00:02:22.620> you<00:02:22.890> can<00:02:23.239> via<00:02:24.239> the<00:02:26.060> you<00:02:27.060> know<00:02:27.150> the

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
whatever you can via the you know the

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.050 
whatever you can via the you know the
shell<00:02:27.720> prompts<00:02:28.400> but<00:02:29.400> then<00:02:29.580> you<00:02:29.670> know<00:02:29.730> this<00:02:29.910> is

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
shell prompts but then you know this is

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.539 
shell prompts but then you know this is
a<00:02:30.090> tool<00:02:30.690> was<00:02:30.930> still<00:02:31.200> nice<00:02:31.380> to<00:02:31.410> have<00:02:31.799> if<00:02:32.069> there's

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:32.549 
a tool was still nice to have if there's

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:34.670 
a tool was still nice to have if there's
something<00:02:32.700> you<00:02:32.940> need<00:02:33.150> to<00:02:33.209> get<00:02:33.480> to<00:02:33.750> that<00:02:34.470> you

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
something you need to get to that you

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.229 
something you need to get to that you
can't<00:02:34.950> you<00:02:35.250> know<00:02:35.370> get<00:02:35.580> to<00:02:35.640> any<00:02:36.630> other<00:02:36.930> way<00:02:37.140> or

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
can't you know get to any other way or

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:42.670 
can't you know get to any other way or
you<00:02:39.239> know<00:02:39.680> i'm<00:02:40.680> going<00:02:40.920> to<00:02:41.040> show<00:02:41.310> you<00:02:41.340> one<00:02:41.580> more

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
you know i'm going to show you one more

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.380 
you know i'm going to show you one more
you<00:02:43.680> can<00:02:43.799> only<00:02:43.950> connect<00:02:44.280> to<00:02:44.370> one<00:02:44.610> VNC<00:02:45.180> at<00:02:45.330> a

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
you can only connect to one VNC at a

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.509 
you can only connect to one VNC at a
time<00:02:45.599> but<00:02:45.780> you<00:02:45.900> can<00:02:46.019> have<00:02:46.140> multiple<00:02:46.519> shell

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
time but you can have multiple shell

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:50.720 
time but you can have multiple shell
sessions<00:02:47.970> open<00:02:48.180> so<00:02:48.900> um<00:02:49.290> you<00:02:49.739> know<00:02:49.859> I<00:02:50.130> don't<00:02:50.640> see

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
sessions open so um you know I don't see

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.370 
sessions open so um you know I don't see
why<00:02:50.940> you<00:02:51.000> would<00:02:51.209> have<00:02:51.359> more<00:02:51.570> than<00:02:51.690> one<00:02:51.870> VNC

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
why you would have more than one VNC

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.500 
why you would have more than one VNC
open<00:02:53.130> at<00:02:53.400> a<00:02:53.430> time<00:02:53.700> plus<00:02:54.030> you<00:02:54.209> know<00:02:54.269> because<00:02:54.450> you

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
open at a time plus you know because you

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.180 
open at a time plus you know because you
can<00:02:54.660> always<00:02:54.780> just<00:02:55.079> auto<00:02:55.560> you<00:02:55.890> know<00:02:55.980> you<00:02:56.070> could

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
can always just auto you know you could

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.280 
can always just auto you know you could
just<00:02:56.280> reconnect<00:02:56.519> to<00:02:57.000> it<00:02:57.120> again<00:02:57.390> it's<00:02:58.049> not<00:02:58.140> like

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
just reconnect to it again it's not like

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.650 
just reconnect to it again it's not like
you're<00:02:58.500> logging<00:02:58.709> out<00:02:59.010> of<00:02:59.220> anything<00:03:02.450> and<00:03:03.450> I'll

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
you're logging out of anything and I'll

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.340 
you're logging out of anything and I'll
go<00:03:03.870> try<00:03:04.829> to<00:03:04.950> jump<00:03:05.370> to<00:03:05.489> another<00:03:05.579> one<00:03:05.970> here<00:03:06.350> and

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
go try to jump to another one here and

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:15.800 
go try to jump to another one here and
this<00:03:07.890> is<00:03:07.950> a<00:03:08.100> one<00:03:08.760> of<00:03:08.850> my<00:03:08.970> ubuntu<00:03:09.530> boxes<00:03:10.530> i<00:03:14.810> think

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
this is a one of my ubuntu boxes i think

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.090 
this is a one of my ubuntu boxes i think
this<00:03:15.900> one<00:03:15.959> is<00:03:16.140> a<00:03:16.260> little<00:03:16.319> slower<00:03:16.709> i<00:03:16.859> mean

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
this one is a little slower i mean

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.920 
this one is a little slower i mean
because<00:03:17.310> the<00:03:17.579> interface<00:03:17.940> on<00:03:18.120> the<00:03:18.209> bun<00:03:18.390> tube<00:03:18.600> is

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
because the interface on the bun tube is

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.270 
because the interface on the bun tube is
a<00:03:18.989> little<00:03:19.440> slower<00:03:19.910> also<00:03:21.920> this<00:03:22.920> is<00:03:23.100> my

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
a little slower also this is my

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.370 
a little slower also this is my
workhorse<00:03:23.519> so<00:03:23.850> I'm<00:03:24.090> sure<00:03:24.299> right<00:03:24.510> now<00:03:24.540> it's<00:03:25.019> got

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
workhorse so I'm sure right now it's got

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:31.970 
workhorse so I'm sure right now it's got
a<00:03:25.410> lot<00:03:25.709> of<00:03:25.769> other<00:03:25.950> stuff<00:03:26.359> going<00:03:27.650> on<00:03:30.200> but<00:03:31.200> now

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
a lot of other stuff going on but now

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.710 
a lot of other stuff going on but now
that<00:03:32.160> it's<00:03:32.430> repainting<00:03:32.910> the<00:03:33.000> screen<00:03:33.299> I<00:03:33.569> can

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
that it's repainting the screen I can

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.920 
that it's repainting the screen I can
zoom<00:03:34.139> in<00:03:34.350> on<00:03:34.590> it<00:03:34.620> and<00:03:34.980> now<00:03:35.730> you<00:03:36.030> can<00:03:36.359> see<00:03:36.540> it<00:03:36.750> you

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:36.930 
zoom in on it and now you can see it you

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.910 
zoom in on it and now you can see it you
know<00:03:37.049> and<00:03:37.639> I<00:03:38.959> can<00:03:39.959> pretty<00:03:40.200> much<00:03:40.290> navigate

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
know and I can pretty much navigate

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:48.059 
know and I can pretty much navigate
around<00:03:41.069> it<00:03:41.340> the<00:03:41.459> same<00:03:41.700> way<00:03:44.600> same

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:48.069 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:54.300 

you<00:03:48.819> know<00:03:52.079> not<00:03:53.079> that<00:03:53.109> I<00:03:53.349> encourage<00:03:53.769> you<00:03:54.099> know

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
you know not that I encourage you know

00:03:54.310 --> 00:04:00.559 
you know not that I encourage you know
playing<00:03:54.760> games<00:03:56.069> over<00:03:57.069> V&amp;C<00:03:57.489> but<00:03:58.209> I<00:03:58.389> mean<00:03:58.620> as<00:03:59.620> you

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:00.569 
playing games over V&amp;C but I mean as you

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:07.289 
playing games over V&amp;C but I mean as you
can<00:04:01.569> see<00:04:01.749> you<00:04:02.019> know<00:04:02.109> it<00:04:02.230> can<00:04:02.379> be<00:04:02.409> done<00:04:06.299> though

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:07.299 
can see you know it can be done though

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:10.440 
can see you know it can be done though
the<00:04:07.420> resolution<00:04:08.019> on<00:04:08.170> my<00:04:08.409> I<00:04:09.030> don't<00:04:10.030> have<00:04:10.180> x

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.289 
server running other than out outside of
VNC<00:04:13.359> so<00:04:13.810> obviously<00:04:14.379> I<00:04:14.469> can't<00:04:15.120> extend<00:04:16.120> the

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
VNC so obviously I can't extend the

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:19.259 
VNC so obviously I can't extend the
screen<00:04:16.599> so<00:04:17.560> far<00:04:17.859> because<00:04:18.280> it's<00:04:18.579> just<00:04:18.729> a<00:04:18.970> VNC

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:19.269 
screen so far because it's just a VNC

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:26.400 
screen so far because it's just a VNC
session<00:04:24.150> so<00:04:25.150> see<00:04:25.479> that<00:04:25.630> just<00:04:25.930> like<00:04:26.080> trying<00:04:26.380> to

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
session so see that just like trying to

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.969 
session so see that just like trying to
close<00:04:26.620> a<00:04:26.650> window<00:04:26.889> it's<00:04:27.550> a<00:04:27.639> little<00:04:27.880> tricky

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:28.979 
close a window it's a little tricky

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:36.499 
close a window it's a little tricky
sperry<00:04:29.979> just<00:04:30.250> use<00:04:30.430> menus<00:04:30.880> if<00:04:31.090> you<00:04:31.210> if<00:04:31.479> you<00:04:31.630> can

00:04:36.499 --> 00:04:36.509 

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:39.089 

or<00:04:37.509> you'll<00:04:37.870> get<00:04:38.020> frustrated<00:04:38.680> and<00:04:38.770> I'm<00:04:38.919> going

00:04:39.089 --> 00:04:39.099 
or you'll get frustrated and I'm going

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:45.900 
or you'll get frustrated and I'm going
to<00:04:39.130> use<00:04:39.190> a<00:04:39.280> keyboard<00:04:39.550> I<00:04:44.610> don't<00:04:45.610> even<00:04:45.699> know<00:04:45.880> if

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:45.910 
to use a keyboard I don't even know if

00:04:45.910 --> 00:05:16.380 
to use a keyboard I don't even know if
there's<00:04:46.150> Alt<00:04:46.449> key<00:04:50.520> OOP

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:16.390 

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:19.140 

and<00:05:17.140> I<00:05:17.290> finally<00:05:17.530> got<00:05:17.740> it<00:05:17.860> close<00:05:17.980> but<00:05:18.310> any<00:05:19.030> day

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:19.150

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:26.500 
drawbacks but I mean it gets the job

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.070 
drawbacks but I mean it gets the job

to connect remotely I've also had the
same<00:05:37.180> experience<00:05:37.690> with<00:05:37.990> some<00:05:38.200> remote<00:05:38.500> desktop

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:38.980 
same experience with some remote desktop

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:41.580 
same experience with some remote desktop
applications<00:05:39.730> so<00:05:39.910> I<00:05:39.970> mean<00:05:40.210> it's<00:05:40.960> not<00:05:41.080> not<00:05:41.560> a

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:52.150 
the crop when it comes to VNC apps for
