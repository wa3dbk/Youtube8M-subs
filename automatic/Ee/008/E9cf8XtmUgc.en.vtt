get I will go with the red ones but like

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:11.330 
get I will go with the red ones but like
I<00:05:09.990> said<00:05:10.140> a<00:05:10.200> lot<00:05:10.440> of<00:05:10.500> people<00:05:10.590> don't<00:05:10.860> like<00:05:11.010> red

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340 
I said a lot of people don't like red

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.160 
I said a lot of people don't like red
the<00:05:11.490> color<00:05:11.700> red<00:05:12.030> um<00:05:12.240> I<00:05:12.630> guess<00:05:12.690> because<00:05:12.960> it

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:13.170 
the color red um I guess because it

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:15.380 
the color red um I guess because it
attracts<00:05:13.500> too<00:05:13.770> much<00:05:13.800> attention<00:05:14.090> then<00:05:15.090> I<00:05:15.120> will

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:15.390 
attracts too much attention then I will

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:16.700 
attracts too much attention then I will
go<00:05:15.510> with<00:05:15.630> the<00:05:15.780> black<00:05:15.990> ones<00:05:16.230> but<00:05:16.440> the<00:05:16.560> white

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:16.710 
go with the black ones but the white

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:18.890 
go with the black ones but the white
ones<00:05:16.950> I<00:05:17.190> would<00:05:17.760> never<00:05:18.300> go<00:05:18.510> with<00:05:18.660> the<00:05:18.750> white
