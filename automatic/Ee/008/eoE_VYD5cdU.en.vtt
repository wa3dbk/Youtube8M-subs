00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:19.660
 welcome our pilot issue gave us 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.830
 understanding that the project 

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.440
 year of roads has the right to exist 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:26.140
 but most people do not even if 

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:29.390
 desire to take civil initiative 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.520
 don't know in the same way affect 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.800
 healthy situation 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.960
 today let's talk about this but for 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.780
 start a little funny stuff for 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.180
 for you though for Saratov this is more the rule 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.450
 than the exception and let's start with the fact that I 

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.380
 managed to shoot on the camera of his mobile 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:48.890
 a team of three people 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:51.620
 desperately slept with hot asphalt puddle 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:54.590
 at the intersection of 1 garden and Rakhov street 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.960
 I made a remark at the TNC filling station 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.360
 the workers asked where were they 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.300
 chief on what citizens workwear 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.850
 answered me something unintelligible supposedly 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:08.689
 they lost their boss and generally worth 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:10.009
 lag behind them for i'm stopping to work in 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:12.799
 in the end I had to 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:15.829
 point the hard worker to the futility of them 

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:18.709
 employment workers were frightened and left from 

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:20.840
 me besides pits in some places 

00:01:18.709 --> 00:01:23.149
 cities have become so huge that 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:26.950
 cars start to fall there 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:29.479
 here are some photos of this confirmation 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.729
 the holiday season is starting soon 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:35.420
 so now we will do the main 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:37.039
 focus on the road leading from the city to 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.319
 example street ust-kurdumskaya we 

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:42.380
 we will explain how to make 

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:44.599
 Complaint of an open pit or other 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:47.329
 violations first of all it is worth saying that 

00:01:44.599 --> 00:01:50.119
 in Zemstvo street is us understudy 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:52.039
 kurdji highway highway spring-summer 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.590
 period grows here several times 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:56.630
 highway in places with road violations 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:59.389
 coverage is still in more or 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.670
 less normal condition and street yushku 

00:01:59.389 --> 00:02:03.860
 Roman say this no longer 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.869
 all the pit we just could not slow down 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.989
 so how soft are most don't work 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:11.750
 and there is water on the road so we 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:15.140
 i fixed we now cost us 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:17.290

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:20.209
 your screens 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:23.300

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.750
 not only Saratov but also in all of Russia 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:50.480
 every day I encounter on the roads 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.340
 but not everyone manifests his 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:56.239
 civic responsibility hiding behind 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:59.390
 big employment and stuff if every 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:02.360
 of us will send a statement to local guides 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:05.780
 complaint to the pits, and other violations of the 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:08.120
 the situation will change the authorities do not 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:11.150
 roads are primarily due to the fact that not 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:13.780
 heard the voice of the people we will continue 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:17.239
