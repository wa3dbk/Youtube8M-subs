I'm losing more money in this casino

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.380 
I'm losing more money in this casino
than<00:03:07.590> either<00:03:07.920> one<00:03:08.099> of<00:03:08.250> these<00:03:08.489> is<00:03:08.819> making<00:03:09.209> me

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
than either one of these is making me

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:12.020 
than either one of these is making me
and<00:03:09.629> so<00:03:10.379> this<00:03:10.620> casino<00:03:11.099> is<00:03:11.310> obviously<00:03:11.700> a<00:03:11.819> big

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
and so this casino is obviously a big

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.000 
and so this casino is obviously a big
drain<00:03:12.239> on<00:03:12.269> my<00:03:12.450> recent<00:03:12.810> resources<00:03:13.650> it<00:03:13.769> would<00:03:13.860> be

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
drain on my recent resources it would be

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.850 
drain on my recent resources it would be
better<00:03:14.310> for<00:03:14.459> me<00:03:14.700> to<00:03:14.849> just<00:03:14.910> bulldoze<00:03:15.480> it<00:03:15.510> and

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
better for me to just bulldoze it and

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.289 
better for me to just bulldoze it and
this<00:03:16.860> is<00:03:17.040> where<00:03:17.250> we<00:03:17.400> get<00:03:17.519> into<00:03:17.700> the<00:03:17.790> tricky

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
this is where we get into the tricky

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:20.569 
this is where we get into the tricky
part<00:03:18.600> of<00:03:18.840> the<00:03:19.650> casinos<00:03:20.220> and<00:03:20.370> the<00:03:20.430> whole

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
part of the casinos and the whole

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:23.449 
part of the casinos and the whole
gambling<00:03:21.380> specialization<00:03:22.380> because<00:03:22.950> this<00:03:23.340> is

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
gambling specialization because this is

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:26.599 
gambling specialization because this is
the<00:03:23.579> only<00:03:23.730> city<00:03:24.209> in<00:03:24.510> this<00:03:24.750> region<00:03:25.319> it<00:03:26.220> can't

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:26.609 
the only city in this region it can't

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:28.910 
the only city in this region it can't
draw<00:03:27.120> tourists<00:03:27.870> from<00:03:28.019> nothingness<00:03:28.769> it

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
draw tourists from nothingness it

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:32.390 
draw tourists from nothingness it
requires<00:03:29.340> other<00:03:29.730> cities<00:03:30.269> so<00:03:31.049> the<00:03:31.650> tricky<00:03:32.160> part

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
requires other cities so the tricky part

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.979 
requires other cities so the tricky part
with<00:03:32.519> the<00:03:32.639> gambling<00:03:33.030> specialization

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
with the gambling specialization

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:35.990 
with the gambling specialization
therefore<00:03:34.410> is<00:03:34.530> if<00:03:34.680> you<00:03:34.829> use<00:03:35.160> it<00:03:35.370> in<00:03:35.519> your<00:03:35.700> very

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
therefore is if you use it in your very

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.599 
therefore is if you use it in your very
first<00:03:36.420> city<00:03:36.780> of<00:03:37.019> a<00:03:37.109> region<00:03:37.620> you<00:03:38.069> won't<00:03:38.220> see<00:03:38.489> the

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:38.609 
first city of a region you won't see the

00:03:38.609 --> 00:03:41.330 
first city of a region you won't see the
maximum<00:03:39.090> profit<00:03:39.299> potential<00:03:39.840> besides<00:03:40.829> even<00:03:41.160> if

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
maximum profit potential besides even if

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.539 
maximum profit potential besides even if
you<00:03:41.400> have<00:03:41.700> a<00:03:41.730> lot<00:03:42.060> of<00:03:42.269> say<00:03:43.099> normal<00:03:44.099> gambling
