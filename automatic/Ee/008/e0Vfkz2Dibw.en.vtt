00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:14.390
 Welcome to wiki 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.780
 give me yours 

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:19.170
 and take it 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.860
 the time to read more about cpl interior doors too 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.349
 experience 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:25.169
 and why she cares if she does 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:26.790
 Inexpensive interior doors up to a maximum of 400 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:29.669
 euro per element are interested 

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:31.399
 in my opinion, for cpm doors 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:34.940
 should decide 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:38.489
 many ask themselves what is actually, for example 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:40.489
 cpl is widely used and is coming 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.920
 many products for use 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:47.370
 cpl is the abbreviation for continues 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.829
 presley - the construction of the top layer 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.050
 consists of several papers by the 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.390
 to a combination of different 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.719
 decors and also structures achieved 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.120
 can be when you open them 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.670
 often want to buy 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:07.159
 many ask that for most customers 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:10.530
 I look after the budget answered 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:12.690
 reasonably priced solid wood doors exist 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.330
 it's like sand on the sea 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.460
 These are actually always 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:20.000
 industrially produced this brings 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.860
 differences in color and structure 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.710
 Imagine they have several 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.950
 doors next to each other and some of these 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:31.049
 Doors differ in the structure itself 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.479
 they hardly ever laugh at this topic 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.310
 put on the set 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.130
 first look that these 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:41.460
 structural differences not particularly 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:45.539
 but they are valuable here 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.399
 whole eleven points are cpl interior doors 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:50.250
 not only very resistant 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:53.609
 but also the same color and structure 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:56.420
 this is exactly the point on the cpl 

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:58.909
 Interior doors based on real wood 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.369
 industrially manufactured interior doors 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:05.579
 can convince 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:09.030
 advantage 2 you get what you see 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:11.190
 we offer you 20 different cpl 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.890
 decors from smooth to 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.200
 textured surfaces of the pattern 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.070
 corresponds to 100 percent of the door 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.500
 surface 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:22.890
 these receive and is therefore no 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:25.530
 good luck advantage three again 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.890
 as skill is another advantage 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:31.530
 the resilience cpl tools and 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.480
 but it is also easy to do 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:34.260
 clean 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.560
 opt for band 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.540
 technology in the pulse of the time 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.760
 high quality three-piece bender I can 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:45.050
 just recommend them as they are essential 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:48.270
 contribute to the longevity of your door 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:50.430
 Pay attention to these well- known ones 

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.230
 contribute significantly to your door 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.910
 not at every touch in 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.550
 affected 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:59.720
 sharp edges on the attack surfaces 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.920
 should not be present 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:05.670
 choose from different 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:08.160
 fairing widths 65 or 75 mm 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.920
 wide fairings depending on the health 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.989
 are selectable 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:14.880
 Finally, a tip from me 

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:17.519
 probably the most important point is 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.560
 they should not be the assembly 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:21.660
 many years of experience in one 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.390
 handicraft profession preferably 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:27.239
 collect carpenters assemble them 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.110
 No doors do not measure them 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:31.440
 doors themselves 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:33.480
 you carry the full risk and doors 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.480
 are much harder to assemble 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.799
 as this is very often described 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:40.500
 should you wish with finished goods 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:43.680
