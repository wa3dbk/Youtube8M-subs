00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:06.550 
meantime you just tap them on there if
you<00:02:03.950> blend<00:02:04.399> if<00:02:04.850> I<00:02:05.240> were<00:02:05.450> to<00:02:05.630> blend<00:02:05.899> these<00:02:06.170> I

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
you blend if I were to blend these I

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.490 
you blend if I were to blend these I
would<00:02:07.159> destroy<00:02:07.670> all<00:02:07.969> the<00:02:08.209> detail<00:02:08.720> of<00:02:09.050> that<00:02:09.229> so

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
would destroy all the detail of that so

and gently go across to remove any of
the<00:02:14.180> straight-up<00:02:14.989> brushstrokes<00:02:16.750> see<00:02:17.750> this

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
the straight-up brushstrokes see this

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:26.199 
the straight-up brushstrokes see this
just<00:02:19.310> like<00:02:19.519> that<00:02:20.680> got<00:02:21.680> it<00:02:22.360> into<00:02:23.360> play

clouds is a you can go back and create
different<00:02:47.270> planes<00:02:48.270> in<00:02:48.600> the<00:02:48.720> clouds<00:02:48.990> like<00:02:49.260> I've

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
different planes in the clouds like I've

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.410 
different planes in the clouds like I've
got<00:02:49.710> some<00:02:50.040> of<00:02:50.160> this<00:02:50.280> paint<00:02:50.700> on<00:02:50.940> there<00:02:51.180> that's

and let's just fluff these up just a
little<00:03:50.880> bit<00:03:51.140> same<00:03:52.140> there<00:03:52.580> go<00:03:53.580> over<00:03:53.610> them<00:03:54.120> just

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
little bit same there go over them just

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.250 
little bit same there go over them just
a<00:03:54.480> tad

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.720 

and<00:04:00.050> we<00:04:01.050> can<00:04:01.230> blend<00:04:01.530> this<00:04:01.769> one<00:04:02.010> down<00:04:02.220> a<00:04:02.549> little

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
and we can blend this one down a little

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:03.229 
and we can blend this one down a little
bit

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
bit

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:14.050 
bit
blend<00:04:04.230> it<00:04:04.409> into<00:04:04.620> the<00:04:04.799> sky<00:04:06.560> just<00:04:07.560> like<00:04:08.310> that

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:22.639 
and I think we got a nice-looking cloud

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:24.640 
and I think we got a nice-looking cloud
right<00:04:23.030> there<00:04:23.210> what<00:04:23.389> do<00:04:23.449> you<00:04:23.509> think<00:04:23.780> a<00:04:23.990> nice

right there what do you think a nice
little<00:04:25.009> group<00:04:25.219> of<00:04:25.370> clouds<00:04:25.699> as<00:04:26.449> if<00:04:26.689> we<00:04:26.870> can<00:04:27.050> kind

00:04:27.279 --> 00:04:27.289 
little group of clouds as if we can kind

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:32.279 
little group of clouds as if we can kind
of<00:04:27.499> zoom<00:04:28.060> in<00:04:29.060> on<00:04:29.240> those<00:04:29.449> and<00:04:29.870> see<00:04:30.169> if<00:04:30.229> we<00:04:30.379> can

00:04:32.279 --> 00:04:32.289 
of zoom in on those and see if we can

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:34.540 
of zoom in on those and see if we can
let<00:04:33.289> you<00:04:33.439> see<00:04:33.650> kind<00:04:33.919> of<00:04:34.009> what<00:04:34.219> they<00:04:34.340> look<00:04:34.520> like

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550 
let you see kind of what they look like

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:40.730 
let you see kind of what they look like
up<00:04:34.939> close<00:04:37.689> see<00:04:38.689> there

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
up close see there

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:42.890 
up close see there
it's<00:04:41.160> got<00:04:41.370> this<00:04:41.550> cloud<00:04:41.910> right<00:04:42.210> in<00:04:42.389> here<00:04:42.720> you

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:42.900 
it's got this cloud right in here you

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:47.330 
it's got this cloud right in here you
can<00:04:43.710> see<00:04:43.949> the<00:04:44.130> texture<00:04:44.669> on<00:04:44.699> it<00:04:45.030> and<00:04:45.270> it<00:04:46.340> the

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:47.340 
can see the texture on it and it the

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:49.430 
can see the texture on it and it the
distance<00:04:47.970> worthless<00:04:48.449> blues<00:04:48.780> light<00:04:49.110> in<00:04:49.350> the

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
distance worthless blues light in the

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.939 
distance worthless blues light in the
background<00:04:49.650> gives<00:04:50.310> that<00:04:50.520> distance<00:04:51.150> of<00:04:51.949> Delta

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:52.949 
background gives that distance of Delta

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:55.939 
background gives that distance of Delta
so<00:04:53.550> that<00:04:53.580> really<00:04:54.330> helps<00:04:54.720> out<00:04:54.870> a<00:04:54.900> lot<00:04:55.110> now<00:04:55.710> one

00:04:55.939 --> 00:04:55.949 
so that really helps out a lot now one

00:04:55.949 --> 00:04:58.370 
so that really helps out a lot now one
other<00:04:56.160> thing<00:04:56.310> that<00:04:56.520> I<00:04:56.759> mean<00:04:57.120> we<00:04:57.300> can<00:04:57.509> do<00:04:58.139> all

00:04:58.370 --> 00:04:58.380 
other thing that I mean we can do all

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:00.890 
other thing that I mean we can do all
kinds<00:04:58.889> of<00:04:58.949> things<00:04:59.220> with<00:04:59.490> this<00:04:59.669> but<00:05:00.060> one<00:05:00.690> other

00:05:27.379 --> 00:05:27.389 
shadows in the clouds so these will play

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:31.310 
shadows in the clouds so these will play
a<00:05:27.479> real<00:05:28.470> nice<00:05:28.770> role<00:05:29.190> in<00:05:29.690> giving<00:05:30.690> the<00:05:31.050> cloud<00:05:31.289> a

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:31.320 
a real nice role in giving the cloud a

a real nice role in giving the cloud a
lot<00:05:31.710> more<00:05:31.919> depth<00:05:32.250> than<00:05:32.550> it<00:05:32.639> has<00:05:32.789> right<00:05:33.120> now

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:33.330 
lot more depth than it has right now

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.210 
lot more depth than it has right now
which<00:05:33.660> it's<00:05:33.960> pretty<00:05:34.169> good<00:05:34.410> right<00:05:34.470> now<00:05:34.830> you<00:05:34.860> can

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:35.220 
which it's pretty good right now you can

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:38.029 
which it's pretty good right now you can
you<00:05:36.150> can<00:05:36.330> leave<00:05:36.599> it<00:05:36.840> the<00:05:36.960> way<00:05:36.990> it<00:05:37.110> is<00:05:37.289> but<00:05:37.740> let's

you can leave it the way it is but let's

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:40.909 
you can leave it the way it is but let's
take<00:05:38.250> it<00:05:38.400> a<00:05:38.490> step<00:05:38.759> farther<00:05:39.090> in<00:05:39.479> and<00:05:39.930> see<00:05:40.740> what

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:40.919 
take it a step farther in and see what

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:44.870 
take it a step farther in and see what
we<00:05:41.039> can<00:05:41.220> come<00:05:41.400> up<00:05:41.460> with<00:05:41.639> just<00:05:42.949> see<00:05:43.949> see<00:05:44.460> what<00:05:44.669> we

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:44.880 
we can come up with just see see what we

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.180 
we can come up with just see see what we
can<00:05:45.060> create
