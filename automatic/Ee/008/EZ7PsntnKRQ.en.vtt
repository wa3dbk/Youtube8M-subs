clearly after all the snowfall that we

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.019 
clearly after all the snowfall that we
have<00:00:21.930> seen<00:00:22.140> up<00:00:22.260> to<00:00:22.380> a<00:00:22.440> meter<00:00:22.619> in<00:00:22.740> places<00:00:23.190> I<00:00:23.340> feel

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
have seen up to a meter in places I feel

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.430 
have seen up to a meter in places I feel
we're<00:00:24.150> widespread<00:00:24.570> problem<00:00:24.930> but<00:00:25.050> it's<00:00:25.170> what's

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:25.440 
we're widespread problem but it's what's

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.380 
we're widespread problem but it's what's
going<00:00:25.680> to<00:00:25.770> change<00:00:26.100> I<00:00:26.310> think<00:00:26.340> that<00:00:26.670> will<00:00:26.820> make

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
going to change I think that will make

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.970 
going to change I think that will make
most<00:00:27.750> of<00:00:28.020> the<00:00:28.109> difference<00:00:28.500> through<00:00:28.740> the<00:00:28.830> night
