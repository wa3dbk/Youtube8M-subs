and<00:00:41.450> put<00:00:41.570> her<00:00:41.629> on<00:00:41.750> polar<00:00:41.989> plot<00:00:42.350> if<00:00:42.770> you<00:00:43.070> are

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:43.309 
and put her on polar plot if you are

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:46.360 
and put her on polar plot if you are
curious<00:00:43.790> why<00:00:44.030> I<00:00:44.059> like<00:00:44.300> polar<00:00:44.540> plot<00:00:45.070> over<00:00:46.070> the

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:46.370 
curious why I like polar plot over the

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.910 
curious why I like polar plot over the
sizing<00:00:46.879> for<00:00:47.270> analyzed<00:00:47.719> go<00:00:48.230> back<00:00:48.410> and<00:00:48.590> watch<00:00:48.710> my

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
sizing for analyzed go back and watch my

pennies<00:00:49.520> video<00:00:49.789> talk<00:00:50.629> a<00:00:50.660> little<00:00:50.870> bit<00:00:51.050> about

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:51.079 
pennies video talk a little bit about

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:54.540 
pennies video talk a little bit about
why<00:00:51.410> I<00:00:51.440> prefer<00:00:51.860> that<00:00:52.219> we<00:00:52.969> see<00:00:53.180> our<00:00:53.450> again<00:00:54.020> our

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:54.550 
why I prefer that we see our again our

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.310 
why I prefer that we see our again our
22.5<00:00:55.550> frequency<00:00:56.120> dominant<00:00:56.660> which<00:00:56.809> is

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
22.5 frequency dominant which is

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.639 
22.5 frequency dominant which is
indicating<00:00:57.980> the<00:00:58.100> nickel<00:00:58.480> that<00:00:59.480> we<00:01:00.230> see<00:01:00.410> in<00:01:00.530> all

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:00.649 
indicating the nickel that we see in all

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:06.899 
indicating the nickel that we see in all
these<00:01:00.829> so<00:01:02.949> there's<00:01:03.949> a<00:01:04.100> pin<00:01:04.489> point<00:01:04.789> for<00:01:05.119> you

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:06.909 
these so there's a pin point for you

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:11.219 
these so there's a pin point for you
alright<00:01:07.970> let's<00:01:08.930> take<00:01:09.049> a<00:01:09.080> look<00:01:09.320> at<00:01:09.439> the<00:01:09.640> 1943

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:11.229 
alright let's take a look at the 1943

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:14.080 
alright let's take a look at the 1943
Jefferson<00:01:12.229> nickel<00:01:12.560> now<00:01:12.710> this<00:01:12.920> has<00:01:13.130> 35<00:01:13.670> percent

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:14.090 
Jefferson nickel now this has 35 percent

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.240 
Jefferson nickel now this has 35 percent
silver<00:01:14.420> in<00:01:14.659> it<00:01:14.810> and<00:01:15.680> I<00:01:16.369> actually<00:01:17.090> when<00:01:17.360> I<00:01:17.390> first

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:18.250 
silver in it and I actually when I first

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.530 
silver in it and I actually when I first
ran<00:01:19.250> this<00:01:19.430> across<00:01:19.729> I<00:01:19.970> thought<00:01:20.150> that<00:01:20.390> maybe

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 
ran this across I thought that maybe

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.730 
ran this across I thought that maybe
we'd<00:01:20.810> see<00:01:20.990> a<00:01:21.020> little<00:01:21.200> bit<00:01:21.380> different<00:01:23.740> numbers

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
we'd see a little bit different numbers

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.590 
we'd see a little bit different numbers
but<00:01:24.979> it's<00:01:25.520> coming<00:01:25.790> off<00:01:25.880> the<00:01:26.000> same<00:01:26.210> pretty<00:01:26.509> much

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:26.600 
but it's coming off the same pretty much

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:27.910 
but it's coming off the same pretty much
for<00:01:26.900> all<00:01:26.930> these<00:01:27.259> nickels<00:01:27.470> we're<00:01:27.680> gonna<00:01:27.770> look

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
for all these nickels we're gonna look

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.920 
for all these nickels we're gonna look
at<00:01:28.100> they're<00:01:28.310> all<00:01:28.340> all<00:01:28.880> the<00:01:29.180> same<00:01:29.420> which<00:01:29.689> makes

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
at they're all all the same which makes

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:31.960 
at they're all all the same which makes
that<00:01:30.049> easy<00:01:30.259> nineteen<00:01:30.830> is<00:01:31.130> the<00:01:31.280> magic<00:01:31.610> number

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
that easy nineteen is the magic number

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.249 
that easy nineteen is the magic number
for<00:01:33.250> nickels<00:01:34.250> I<00:01:34.780> think<00:01:35.780> once<00:01:35.990> in<00:01:36.110> a<00:01:36.140> while

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:36.259
