 even today, his work is more for outdoors 

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:21.930
 This is a technique that Christian Apelt has practiced for years 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.810
 it's about the flow of driving 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.279

 or Trier have good socially critical statements 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000

 Attachment to therefore had to be especially often under 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.430
 the work is very appealing to see for the trip even to say 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.610
 The world knows that it has developed to work together 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:48.760
 probably something to pick 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.550

 Christian a-tec grew up here 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.710
 in berlin-lichtenberg 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.869
 in a family that did not come into contact with art 

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:14.119
 Good luck prevented with a youth culture 

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:17.319
 kicking your feet 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.849

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.200
 At the moment, at school, parents are learning 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.030
 that was no enrichment for me and has meanwhile completely 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.939
 is very different 

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:33.789

 Today, Christian Apelt works in a 120 square meter »run 

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:14.439
 what he has learned in his art studies 

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:18.469
 he associates with what we do in his "street art" time, day after day 

00:03:18.469 --> 00:03:21.469
 has trained

 What's wrong with a painting style in May? 

00:03:27.009 --> 00:03:32.329
 Painting and drawing and I come down from graffiti that fell a lot with me 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:34.970
