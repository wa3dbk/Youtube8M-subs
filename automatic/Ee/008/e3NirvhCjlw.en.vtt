00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:13.880
 gilles catoire and now advancing bat 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.470
 rarely but now I'm done curly 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.990
 which I 'm going to make a breach of 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.850
 true gap loops yes yes but 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.070
 it's the shaping it's like sorts of 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.170
 little curls you'll see it's 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.580
 really very pretty very cute like the 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.449
 loops it's gone go we start 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:33.059
 by the flour ok then used a 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.530
 hook for the exit ok but that 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.920
 that I do but it's important that they 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:40.020
 he alone 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:45.090
 yes I add vanilla sugar 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:47.520
 it remains optional ok then hop the 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.559
 yeast attention we try not to 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.219
 too much m but how are we going to mix of 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:55.649
 hold the contact with the yeast salt 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:57.890
 or sugar but if you are mixing South 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:03.870
 have no problem with emails and liquids 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:06.769
 eggs and talent and we start to 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.769
 knead gently 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.530
 for three four minutes ch to 4 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.640
 minutes and after we'll go 

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.350
 mans 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:18.100
 buddy now she is well mixed 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.840
 we will add the elastic butter 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.909
 is yes then it's normal that she is 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.040
 when lamard did not worry dead 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:27.040
 she worked on the output goal 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:30.840
 the gluten is there we will work a little 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.840
 more and a little stronger 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.770
 his evening amalgamate with the hatch 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:37.030
 butter and ointments at the exit 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.520
 of the refrigerator since at least one 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.030
 time again and we will incorporate them in 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.180
 dough 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:46.330
 go in four minutes 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:48.100
 impeccable good we see that she is 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.960
 that she is ready mahdia when 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.760
 kittens the butter is incorporated okay 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:55.540
 and then we still have that elasticity 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:57.910
 there we get a lot of questions from 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:00.760
 the dough and the settlers so that's all to 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:02.860
 does normal after she goes it's 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:05.590
 all this offers from europe this is going 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:10.360
 harden it will be handy worry 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:15.910
 if it is not all break the studio 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:18.070
 get rid of it you breed her more 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.560
 flower not even no but ok it's not the 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.660
 here and there we will film it at 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.180
 contact to put it flat and we 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.500
 will put it one hour in the freezer or 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.330
 3 hours in the refrigerator 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.530
 so according to your refrigerator she 

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.480
 can push slightly but you 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.310
 panic not consensus and and but you 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.830
 can even prepare it the day before the 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.230
 evening for the German of my voice but 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:40.030
 it's in the fridge only to ourselves 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.910
 freeze it's true it works very well 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:45.060
 past we had the plating her 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:47.950
 own little spanking there and it rolls 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:50.880
 then the dough and fresh cold 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:53.950
 and we'll go to our curly bun 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.810
 besides who says book is said swell 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.140
 girl the hobbit and did not follow 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:01.580
 sluggish recipes will not work 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.580
 this media that told me before agree 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:08.490
 so I put some flour and I 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:12.150
 go and spread my paw for his purposes ac yes 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:15.780
 yes yes we will say half a centimeter 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:18.510
 force and mm ok okay to go again 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:21.780
 cold should not hesitate a little to the 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:23.580
 warm up holds as long as there is more 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:27.060
 we go to work with the sees the 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:29.250
 gallantry not actually it's not 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.780
 really a muscle problem either 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:32.430
 must be very effective roll well 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:36.320
 flat like that you see we say downright 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:38.880
 that I know it's not that but simply 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:41.790
 important is good flora and also to 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:46.970
 How we verify that this is a 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.970
 very good go there after me I take 

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:53.430
 these girls must by force 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:55.950
 yes I take a circle way home yann 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:57.840
 carried away against so those who have 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:01.700
 tus finds me off and I'll 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:06.180
 cut ranks of tac agreement 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:09.120
 here and all the remains you go on 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:11.640
 reuse yes we did not make a match 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.650
 full cache anything so hold 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.840
 we will put aside while waiting for a 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:19.079
 grobool day humbly something else ok 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.820
 there is something else or to continue 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:25.470
 with the same aura but its drilling 

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:27.060
 ok so I take three simple ones and I 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.669
 overlap and I go for rides 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:32.790
 okay not all of whom are walking three there 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:34.470
 thomas cleric 3 to ego sageris again 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:37.260
 count on me these things he's going 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:37.979
 to do ok that's why you say that if 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:43.590
 it's missing 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:43.919
 we go to spread the paste ok there is time 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.880
 full 

00:04:43.919 --> 00:04:50.880
 yeah let 's leave waiting ok 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:51.889
 so I will show you for the 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.319
 first 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:58.870
 I'm going to take this one so there it 

00:04:54.319 --> 00:05:04.580
 without horses at home I'm going to ride ok 

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:09.349
 I will say where occupants here are two 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:12.379
 exterior to nantiat that and you unroll 

00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:14.900
 pretty tight pretty tight tac 

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:17.659
 I get it must not get rid 

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:21.020
 now you're not going after when they 

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:23.569
 are rolled I take a knife and I 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:27.050
 go cut in half the crabs of the mo 

00:05:23.569 --> 00:05:29.689
 to weld or it makes flowers 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:33.590
 Loop flowers is very pretty very very 

00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:36.830
 very heavy so that's take a look 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:39.139
 tobacco or flowers are the flowers 

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:41.509
 loop is looped 

00:05:39.139 --> 00:05:42.949
 so I take my mold would like 

00:05:41.509 --> 00:05:44.839
 buttered and I leave to pose at the bottom 

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:46.430
 that leaves a little bit of 

00:05:44.839 --> 00:05:49.990
 space under way yes a little bit 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:52.490
 that's all is clean chip cell mm 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:54.259
 otherwise the brioche I spent lying will be 

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:56.479
 not very numerous and that's it over 

00:05:54.259 --> 00:05:58.669
 Pignan is very cute like 

00:05:56.479 --> 00:06:00.500
 loops at 6 go we'll put a 

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:02.599
 rag on top yeah it's in a corner 

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:04.580
 of cooking at seven is here or so 

00:06:02.599 --> 00:06:05.870
 baked in an oven at 30 degrees you 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:06.169
 to let it grow requires that its double of 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:09.409
 volume 

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:13.550
 see you later on the squeegee 

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:15.889
 aulas evoked his magnificent very 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:17.990
 beautiful shoots it's really very very 

00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:19.669
 very good so we go a little bit of 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:21.319
 gilding a little petermann faced 

00:06:19.669 --> 00:06:23.659
 the double flats agrees and we 

00:06:21.319 --> 00:06:27.259
 sleeps slightly very slightly where we have 

00:06:23.659 --> 00:06:31.849
 afraid to preheat your oven to 180 Â° 

00:06:27.259 --> 00:06:33.469
 and we go the leather at 25 30 minutes are 

00:06:31.849 --> 00:06:35.479
 many times agree so that you 

00:06:33.469 --> 00:06:35.689
 it's really very visual hockey at all 

00:06:35.479 --> 00:06:38.629
 on time 

00:06:35.689 --> 00:06:40.909
 bun loops operation succeed 

00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:42.649
 she is beautiful is both firm on 

00:06:40.909 --> 00:06:45.259
 a little grid she's really at 

00:06:42.649 --> 00:06:47.270
 which I believe is really the 

00:06:45.259 --> 00:06:48.500
 brioche a little bit modeling the that is 

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:52.599
 really top trends let's 

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:52.599
 now serve ciao
