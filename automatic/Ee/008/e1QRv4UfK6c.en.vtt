too many Marines just played a little

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.900 
too many Marines just played a little
bit<00:00:25.019> too<00:00:25.230> safe<00:00:25.470> as<00:00:25.650> we<00:00:25.769> did<00:00:25.980> go<00:00:26.160> over<00:00:26.550> the<00:00:26.580> last

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
bit too safe as we did go over the last

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.790 
bit too safe as we did go over the last
game<00:00:27.180> will<00:00:27.390> see<00:00:27.510> exactly<00:00:27.779> what<00:00:28.230> he<00:00:28.380> ends<00:00:28.740> up

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
game will see exactly what he ends up

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.999 
game will see exactly what he ends up
doing<00:00:29.099> this<00:00:29.550> game<00:00:29.939> and<00:00:30.269> it<00:00:30.810> is<00:00:30.869> on<00:00:31.230> frigid<00:00:31.800> pass

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
doing this game and it is on frigid pass

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.530 
doing this game and it is on frigid pass
so<00:00:32.279> I'm<00:00:32.399> assuming<00:00:32.520> both<00:00:33.000> these<00:00:33.180> players<00:00:33.450> don't

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
so I'm assuming both these players don't

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.060 
so I'm assuming both these players don't
really<00:00:33.989> play<00:00:34.200> on<00:00:34.290> this<00:00:34.380> map<00:00:34.590> that<00:00:34.860> much

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
really play on this map that much

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.950 
really play on this map that much
because<00:00:35.219> I<00:00:35.399> don't<00:00:35.640> cast<00:00:35.880> this<00:00:36.090> mat<00:00:36.329> much<00:00:36.570> and

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
because I don't cast this mat much and

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.799 
because I don't cast this mat much and
this<00:00:37.559> is<00:00:37.739> not<00:00:37.890> in<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.460> latter<00:00:38.730> so<00:00:39.210> really

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
this is not in the latter so really

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.720 
this is not in the latter so really
curious<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.200> see<00:00:40.350> how<00:00:40.559> this<00:00:40.590> does<00:00:40.800> play<00:00:41.219> out<00:00:41.399> it

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
curious to see how this does play out it

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.220 
curious to see how this does play out it
looks<00:00:42.120> like<00:00:42.180> it's<00:00:42.390> a<00:00:42.450> four<00:00:42.719> player<00:00:42.930> map

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
looks like it's a four player map

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.869 
looks like it's a four player map
doesn't<00:00:43.500> look<00:00:43.710> like<00:00:43.860> any<00:00:44.040> positions

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
doesn't look like any positions

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.580 
doesn't look like any positions
earthforce<00:00:45.510> they<00:00:45.690> are<00:00:45.840> complete<00:00:46.289> cross

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
earthforce they are complete cross

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.340 
earthforce they are complete cross
positions<00:00:47.129> what<00:00:47.730> that<00:00:47.910> means<00:00:48.149> I<00:00:48.450> have<00:00:48.480> no<00:00:49.020> idea

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
positions what that means I have no idea

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.970 
positions what that means I have no idea
but<00:00:50.070> it<00:00:50.910> does<00:00:51.149> look<00:00:51.180> like<00:00:51.420> it<00:00:51.660> is<00:00:51.690> a<00:00:51.809> very<00:00:52.469> long

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
but it does look like it is a very long

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.029 
but it does look like it is a very long
scouting<00:00:53.820> distance<00:00:54.629> so<00:00:54.840> that<00:00:55.050> means<00:00:55.320> long

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
scouting distance so that means long

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.220 
scouting distance so that means long
rush<00:00:56.309> distance<00:00:56.730> which<00:00:57.030> means<00:00:57.329> it's<00:00:57.719> gonna<00:00:57.960> be

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
rush distance which means it's gonna be

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.380 
rush distance which means it's gonna be
a<00:00:58.440> long<00:00:58.829> macro<00:00:59.579> game<00:00:59.789> which<00:01:00.030> is<00:01:00.059> just

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
a long macro game which is just

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.540 
a long macro game which is just
absolutely<00:01:00.840> amazing<00:01:01.230> we<00:01:01.949> will<00:01:02.160> be<00:01:02.340> seeing

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
absolutely amazing we will be seeing

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.609 
absolutely amazing we will be seeing
kilo<00:01:02.969> go<00:01:03.210> for<00:01:03.480> that<00:01:03.629> hatch<00:01:03.870> first<00:01:04.199> like<00:01:04.500> he

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
kilo go for that hatch first like he

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:05.899 
kilo go for that hatch first like he
didn't<00:01:04.830> last<00:01:04.920> game<00:01:05.159> because<00:01:05.430> well<00:01:05.610> it<00:01:05.790> is<00:01:05.880> a

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
didn't last game because well it is a

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.719 
didn't last game because well it is a
zvt<00:01:06.360> an<00:01:06.600> all<00:01:06.840> jigs<00:01:07.200> do<00:01:07.470> that<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:08.130> question<00:01:08.580> is

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
zvt an all jigs do that the question is

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.600 
zvt an all jigs do that the question is
does<00:01:08.939> salvation<00:01:09.720> go<00:01:09.869> for<00:01:10.250> command<00:01:11.250> center

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
does salvation go for command center

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.160 
does salvation go for command center
first<00:01:11.850> wasn't<00:01:12.119> going<00:01:12.299> to<00:01:12.360> 12<00:01:12.600> racks<00:01:12.869> and<00:01:13.049> just

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
first wasn't going to 12 racks and just

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.410 
first wasn't going to 12 racks and just
play<00:01:13.380> it<00:01:13.409> relatively<00:01:14.100> standard<00:01:14.549> he<00:01:15.210> is<00:01:15.330> going

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
play it relatively standard he is going

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.210 
play it relatively standard he is going
to<00:01:15.540> be<00:01:15.600> going<00:01:15.689> for<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.229> 12<00:01:16.470> racks<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.920> command

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
to be going for the 12 racks the command

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.190 
to be going for the 12 racks the command
center<00:01:17.340> first<00:01:17.670> may<00:01:18.299> be<00:01:18.360> good<00:01:18.750> on<00:01:18.900> this<00:01:19.049> map

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
center first may be good on this map

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.200 
center first may be good on this map
just<00:01:19.500> because<00:01:19.740> again<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.189> distance<00:01:20.610> is<00:01:20.759> so

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
just because again the distance is so

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.080 
just because again the distance is so
long<00:01:21.780> that<00:01:22.110> uh<00:01:22.979> you<00:01:23.400> could<00:01:23.549> probably<00:01:23.820> get<00:01:24.060> away

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
long that uh you could probably get away

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.649 
long that uh you could probably get away
with<00:01:24.330> it<00:01:24.630> relatively<00:01:25.350> easily<00:01:25.830> and<00:01:26.659> helo

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
with it relatively easily and helo

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.600 
with it relatively easily and helo
actually<00:01:28.170> going<00:01:28.320> to<00:01:28.409> be<00:01:28.500> getting<00:01:28.680> a<00:01:28.979> gas<00:01:29.280> right

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
actually going to be getting a gas right

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:30.950 
actually going to be getting a gas right
now<00:01:29.640> so<00:01:29.880> he<00:01:29.970> is<00:01:30.030> not<00:01:30.210> going<00:01:30.360> to<00:01:30.420> be<00:01:30.509> going<00:01:30.630> for

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
now so he is not going to be going for

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.350 
now so he is not going to be going for
that<00:01:30.990> hatch<00:01:31.380> first<00:01:31.799> he<00:01:32.460> is<00:01:32.490> getting<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:33.090> pool

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
that hatch first he is getting a pool

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.030 
that hatch first he is getting a pool
and<00:01:33.509> he<00:01:33.659> will<00:01:33.869> be<00:01:34.049> doing<00:01:34.259> a<00:01:34.350> little<00:01:34.619> bit<00:01:34.829> of<00:01:34.860> the

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
and he will be doing a little bit of the

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.950 
and he will be doing a little bit of the
cheese<00:01:35.250> because<00:01:35.579> I<00:01:35.670> don't<00:01:35.820> know<00:01:35.880> of<00:01:36.060> any<00:01:36.299> zhuge

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
cheese because I don't know of any zhuge

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.649 
cheese because I don't know of any zhuge

build that involves a gas then pull into

build that involves a gas then pull into

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:42.200 
side so I foresters only to come this
I<00:06:40.140> maybe<00:06:40.890> place<00:06:41.160> one<00:06:41.490> of<00:06:41.520> the<00:06:41.640> bags<00:06:41.820> right<00:06:42.150> here

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:42.210 
I maybe place one of the bags right here

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:44.600 
I maybe place one of the bags right here
and<00:06:42.680> bunker<00:06:43.680> over<00:06:43.890> here<00:06:44.040> something<00:06:44.460> uh

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:44.610 
and bunker over here something uh

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:46.820 
and bunker over here something uh
another<00:06:45.330> supply<00:06:45.690> depot<00:06:46.020> over<00:06:46.350> here<00:06:46.530> did<00:06:46.770> he

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:46.830 
another supply depot over here did he

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:48.980 
another supply depot over here did he
place<00:06:47.010> one<00:06:47.160> back<00:06:47.310> in<00:06:47.490> know<00:06:47.700> so<00:06:48.060> I<00:06:48.300> want<00:06:48.900> to

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:48.990 
place one back in know so I want to

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:51.320 
place one back in know so I want to
reinforce<00:06:49.290> this<00:06:49.860> may<00:06:50.820> just<00:06:50.850> lace<00:06:51.090> the<00:06:51.210> bag

00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:51.330 
reinforce this may just lace the bag

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:53.750 
reinforce this may just lace the bag
right<00:06:51.840> there<00:06:51.870> that<00:06:52.200> may<00:06:52.500> be<00:06:52.560> good<00:06:52.830> enough<00:06:53.040> but

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:53.760 
right there that may be good enough but

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:55.670 
right there that may be good enough but
reinforce<00:06:54.210> this<00:06:54.420> side<00:06:54.660> so<00:06:54.690> I<00:06:54.870> forced<00:06:55.320> as<00:06:55.410> early

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:55.680 
reinforce this side so I forced as early

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:57.020 
reinforce this side so I forced as early
to<00:06:55.770> come<00:06:55.920> over<00:06:56.220> here<00:06:56.400> because<00:06:56.520> if<00:06:56.760> they<00:06:56.820> bust

00:06:57.020 --> 00:06:57.030 
to come over here because if they bust

00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:01.850 
to come over here because if they bust
down<00:06:57.180> this<00:06:57.480> they<00:06:58.140> can<00:06:58.290> bypass<00:06:58.500> my<00:06:59.190> Marines<00:07:00.860> so

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:01.860 
down this they can bypass my Marines so

00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:04.400 
down this they can bypass my Marines so
all<00:07:02.790> you<00:07:02.970> need<00:07:03.000> to<00:07:03.210> do<00:07:03.330> was<00:07:03.630> hold<00:07:03.870> it<00:07:04.050> did<00:07:04.290> it

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:04.410 
all you need to do was hold it did it

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:06.620 
all you need to do was hold it did it
need<00:07:04.560> to<00:07:04.590> secure<00:07:04.950> the<00:07:05.130> base<00:07:05.280> down<00:07:05.580> here<00:07:05.940> if<00:07:06.120> he

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:06.630 
need to secure the base down here if he

00:07:06.630 --> 00:07:08.210 
need to secure the base down here if he
held<00:07:06.840> it<00:07:06.960> he<00:07:07.080> was<00:07:07.230> winning<00:07:07.440> just<00:07:07.740> because<00:07:08.010> he

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:08.220 
held it he was winning just because he

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:15.060 
bunker is and take a base and win the

00:07:28.520 --> 00:07:28.530 
even the barracks and tech lab that

00:07:28.530 --> 00:07:29.630 
even the barracks and tech lab that
would<00:07:28.620> be<00:07:28.740> great<00:07:28.890> right<00:07:29.160> here<00:07:29.310> that<00:07:29.460> would<00:07:29.550> be
