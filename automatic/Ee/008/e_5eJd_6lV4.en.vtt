oh he's not big you know these rods look

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.560 
oh he's not big you know these rods look
at<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.800> bend<00:00:35.010> these<00:00:35.160> rods<00:00:35.460> have<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:36.180> rod<00:00:36.390> that

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
at the bend these rods have the rod that

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.290 
at the bend these rods have the rod that
I'm<00:00:36.720> using<00:00:36.960> is<00:00:37.260> five<00:00:37.559> feet<00:00:37.860> long<00:00:38.160> it's<00:00:38.790> rated

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
I'm using is five feet long it's rated

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.900 
I'm using is five feet long it's rated
for<00:00:39.540> two<00:00:39.780> to<00:00:39.900> four<00:00:40.110> pound<00:00:40.440> test<00:00:40.710> grants<00:00:41.699> using

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
for two to four pound test grants using

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.140 
for two to four pound test grants using
a<00:00:42.230> seven<00:00:43.230> and<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.410> half<00:00:43.440> foot<00:00:43.830> rod<00:00:44.070> rated<00:00:44.879> from

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:45.150 
a seven and a half foot rod rated from

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.720 
a seven and a half foot rod rated from
two<00:00:45.390> to<00:00:45.540> six<00:00:45.750> pound<00:00:46.080> test<00:00:46.350> so<00:00:47.220> these<00:00:47.400> would<00:00:47.670> be

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
two to six pound test so these would be

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.060 
two to six pound test so these would be
classic<00:00:48.540> ultralight<00:00:49.199> rods<00:00:49.500> even<00:00:49.920> though

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
classic ultralight rods even though

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.310 
classic ultralight rods even though
they're<00:00:50.280> long<00:00:50.489> like<00:00:51.330> grants<00:00:51.629> is<00:00:51.750> long<00:00:51.930> anyway

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
they're long like grants is long anyway

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.860 
they're long like grants is long anyway
mm-hmm<00:00:52.949> grant<00:00:53.699> you<00:00:53.850> asked<00:00:54.120> me<00:00:54.239> earlier<00:00:54.269> if<00:00:54.690> I

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
mm-hmm grant you asked me earlier if I

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.049 
mm-hmm grant you asked me earlier if I
ever<00:00:54.989> use<00:00:55.260> long<00:00:55.590> rods<00:00:55.890> yeah<00:00:56.340> you<00:00:56.610> know<00:00:56.730> for

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
ever use long rods yeah you know for

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.420 
ever use long rods yeah you know for
crappie<00:00:57.719> as<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:58.500> probably<00:00:58.739> know<00:00:59.160> in<00:00:59.340> the

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
crappie as you probably know in the

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.670 
crappie as you probably know in the
States<00:00:59.820> they<00:01:00.120> use<00:01:00.239> a<00:01:00.270> lot<00:01:00.540> of<00:01:00.690> poles<00:01:00.989> with<00:01:01.469> no

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
States they use a lot of poles with no

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.400 
States they use a lot of poles with no
reels<00:01:01.980> on<00:01:02.280> them<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:02.870> for<00:01:03.870> example<00:01:04.199> if<00:01:04.259> you're

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:04.410 
reels on them and for example if you're

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:06.260 
reels on them and for example if you're
fishing<00:01:04.830> here<00:01:04.979> instead<00:01:05.220> of<00:01:05.280> casting<00:01:05.580> like<00:01:06.060> we

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
fishing here instead of casting like we

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.060 
fishing here instead of casting like we
are<00:01:06.479> just<00:01:06.869> dump<00:01:07.110> all<00:01:07.259> you<00:01:07.410> would<00:01:07.590> do<00:01:07.710> is<00:01:07.740> dunk

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
are just dump all you would do is dunk

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.370 
are just dump all you would do is dunk
it<00:01:08.250> bring<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.789> fish<00:01:08.970> in<00:01:09.210> so<00:01:09.720> underneath<00:01:10.050> your

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
it bring the fish in so underneath your

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.190 
it bring the fish in so underneath your
pole<00:01:10.649> you'd<00:01:11.039> have<00:01:11.190> anywhere<00:01:11.700> from<00:01:12.330> about<00:01:12.509> six

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
pole you'd have anywhere from about six

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.650 
pole you'd have anywhere from about six
to<00:01:13.619> ten<00:01:13.649> feet<00:01:14.220> of<00:01:14.369> line<00:01:14.640> that's<00:01:15.119> attached<00:01:15.479> to

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:15.660 
to ten feet of line that's attached to

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:17.900 
to ten feet of line that's attached to
the<00:01:15.840> end<00:01:16.020> to<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.289> tip<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:17.280> because<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:17.729> tip

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:17.910 
the end to the tip and because the tip

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.139 
the end to the tip and because the tip
is<00:01:18.090> flexible<00:01:18.690> even<00:01:19.470> if<00:01:19.590> you<00:01:19.710> get<00:01:19.890> a<00:01:19.920> bass<00:01:20.250> on<00:01:20.610> or

00:01:21.139 --> 00:01:21.149 
is flexible even if you get a bass on or

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:23.540 
is flexible even if you get a bass on or
a<00:01:21.180> really<00:01:21.420> big<00:01:21.660> crappie<00:01:22.100> the<00:01:23.100> line<00:01:23.310> doesn't

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:23.550 
a really big crappie the line doesn't

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:38.690 
a really big crappie the line doesn't
break<00:01:23.850> because<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:25.020> rod<00:01:25.259> flexes<00:01:25.830> so<00:01:26.009> much

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.890 

you<00:01:39.700> know<00:01:39.820> when<00:01:39.940> it<00:01:40.030> comes<00:01:40.180> to<00:01:40.390> fishing<00:01:40.630> for

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:40.900 
you know when it comes to fishing for

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.290 
you know when it comes to fishing for
pan<00:01:41.140> fish<00:01:41.170> especially<00:01:41.620> crappie<00:01:42.400> one<00:01:43.120> of<00:01:43.240> the

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:43.300 
pan fish especially crappie one of the

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.930 
pan fish especially crappie one of the
best<00:01:43.510> rigs<00:01:43.780> to<00:01:43.990> use<00:01:44.200> is<00:01:44.470> called<00:01:44.560> a<00:01:44.890> slip<00:01:45.670> bobber

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:45.940 
best rigs to use is called a slip bobber

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:47.430 
best rigs to use is called a slip bobber
rig<00:01:46.300> and<00:01:46.480> that's<00:01:46.600> what<00:01:46.750> I've<00:01:46.840> got<00:01:46.870> here<00:01:47.320> you

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:47.440 
rig and that's what I've got here you

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.590 
rig and that's what I've got here you
can<00:01:47.560> see<00:01:47.710> that<00:01:47.890> the<00:01:48.010> float<00:01:48.280> has<00:01:49.150> the<00:01:49.420> line

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 
can see that the float has the line

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.180 
can see that the float has the line
going<00:01:49.930> through<00:01:50.230> it<00:01:50.380> and<00:01:50.530> it<00:01:50.620> slides<00:01:50.830> up<00:01:51.040> and

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190 
going through it and it slides up and

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.070 
going through it and it slides up and
down<00:01:51.310> now<00:01:51.970> what<00:01:52.120> I've<00:01:52.240> done<00:01:52.270> is<00:01:52.570> I've<00:01:52.720> added<00:01:52.900> a

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
down now what I've done is I've added a

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.620 
down now what I've done is I've added a
split<00:01:53.410> shot<00:01:53.680> to<00:01:54.190> the<00:01:54.310> line<00:01:54.550> just<00:01:55.210> to<00:01:55.300> get<00:01:55.480> the

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
split shot to the line just to get the

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.060 
split shot to the line just to get the
jig<00:01:55.840> to<00:01:55.870> sink<00:01:56.230> a<00:01:56.320> little<00:01:56.410> bit<00:01:56.650> quicker<00:01:56.860> because

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
jig to sink a little bit quicker because

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.930 
jig to sink a little bit quicker because
the<00:01:57.400> jig<00:01:57.670> is<00:01:57.700> a<00:01:58.380> 1/32<00:01:59.380> ounce<00:01:59.560> jig<00:01:59.950> head<00:02:00.190> you<00:02:00.790> can

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:00.940 
the jig is a 1/32 ounce jig head you can

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:02.850 
the jig is a 1/32 ounce jig head you can
see<00:02:00.970> it<00:02:01.180> right<00:02:01.330> there<00:02:01.360> it's<00:02:01.690> pretty<00:02:01.870> light<00:02:02.200> so

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
see it right there it's pretty light so

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.470 
see it right there it's pretty light so
it<00:02:02.920> would<00:02:03.040> take<00:02:03.160> a<00:02:03.190> long<00:02:03.430> time<00:02:03.700> to<00:02:03.910> sink<00:02:04.210> so

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:04.480 
it would take a long time to sink so

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:05.730 
it would take a long time to sink so
because<00:02:04.780> of<00:02:04.900> that<00:02:04.930> I've<00:02:05.080> added<00:02:05.230> that<00:02:05.350> split

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:05.740 
because of that I've added that split

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.500 
because of that I've added that split
shot<00:02:05.980> now<00:02:06.460> you'll<00:02:06.580> also<00:02:06.730> notice<00:02:07.060> that<00:02:07.180> what

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:07.510 
shot now you'll also notice that what

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:09.359 
shot now you'll also notice that what
stops<00:02:07.930> the<00:02:08.229> float<00:02:08.470> from<00:02:08.679> going<00:02:08.890> up<00:02:09.040> the<00:02:09.190> line

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
stops the float from going up the line

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:11.610 
stops the float from going up the line
is<00:02:09.670> something<00:02:10.300> called<00:02:10.540> a<00:02:10.660> bobber<00:02:10.899> stop<00:02:11.320> and

is something called a bobber stop and

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.430 
is something called a bobber stop and
I've<00:02:12.070> simply<00:02:12.520> taken<00:02:12.940> 20<00:02:13.360> pound<00:02:13.660> braided<00:02:14.080> line

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
I've simply taken 20 pound braided line

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.680 
I've simply taken 20 pound braided line
this<00:02:15.130> particular<00:02:15.610> line<00:02:15.760> is<00:02:15.880> called<00:02:16.120> Dacron

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:16.690 
this particular line is called Dacron

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.449 
this particular line is called Dacron
and<00:02:16.720> it's<00:02:17.020> the<00:02:17.110> same<00:02:17.320> line<00:02:17.500> used<00:02:17.800> for<00:02:18.010> backing

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
and it's the same line used for backing

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:21.270 
and it's the same line used for backing
on<00:02:18.900> for<00:02:19.900> example<00:02:19.990> fly<00:02:20.530> reels<00:02:20.800> here's<00:02:21.040> some

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
on for example fly reels here's some

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.820 
on for example fly reels here's some
spinning<00:02:21.610> reels<00:02:21.820> and<00:02:22.660> I've<00:02:22.900> tied<00:02:23.260> it<00:02:23.440> into<00:02:23.620> a

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
spinning reels and I've tied it into a

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.730 
spinning reels and I've tied it into a
uni<00:02:24.250> knot<00:02:24.400> and<00:02:24.730> then<00:02:24.880> tightened<00:02:25.360> it<00:02:25.510> so<00:02:26.230> it's

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:26.740 
uni knot and then tightened it so it's

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.380 
uni knot and then tightened it so it's
strong<00:02:27.100> enough<00:02:27.340> that<00:02:27.400> it<00:02:27.640> won't<00:02:27.790> slide<00:02:28.090> up<00:02:28.240> and

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
strong enough that it won't slide up and

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:29.699 
strong enough that it won't slide up and
down<00:02:28.450> the<00:02:28.690> line<00:02:28.870> but<00:02:29.050> if<00:02:29.200> I<00:02:29.320> need<00:02:29.470> to<00:02:29.590> I<00:02:29.620> can

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
down the line but if I need to I can

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:31.890 
down the line but if I need to I can
adjust<00:02:30.130> it<00:02:30.340> up<00:02:30.430> and<00:02:30.670> down<00:02:30.850> and<00:02:31.120> then<00:02:31.600> below

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
adjust it up and down and then below

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.840 
adjust it up and down and then below
that<00:02:32.110> uni<00:02:32.470> knot<00:02:32.650> what<00:02:33.220> I've<00:02:33.340> done<00:02:33.459> is<00:02:33.610> put<00:02:33.820> a

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
that uni knot what I've done is put a

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:35.340 
that uni knot what I've done is put a
little<00:02:34.090> bead<00:02:34.450> in<00:02:34.600> the<00:02:34.720> line<00:02:34.870> so<00:02:34.900> you<00:02:35.140> can<00:02:35.230> see

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
little bead in the line so you can see

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.020 
little bead in the line so you can see
the<00:02:35.560> beads<00:02:35.770> just<00:02:35.890> ahead<00:02:36.160> of<00:02:36.190> the<00:02:36.340> float<00:02:36.610> and

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
the beads just ahead of the float and

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:39.630 
the beads just ahead of the float and
I've<00:02:37.450> done<00:02:37.690> that<00:02:37.870> so<00:02:38.440> that<00:02:38.650> the<00:02:38.770> bead<00:02:39.010> stops

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
I've done that so that the bead stops

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.060 
I've done that so that the bead stops
where<00:02:40.150> the<00:02:40.270> bobber<00:02:40.510> stop<00:02:40.959> is<00:02:41.230> because

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.070 
where the bobber stop is because

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.640 
where the bobber stop is because
sometimes<00:02:42.489> the<00:02:43.209> knot<00:02:43.420> will<00:02:43.660> go<00:02:43.780> inside<00:02:44.290> the

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:44.650 
sometimes the knot will go inside the

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.560 
sometimes the knot will go inside the
float<00:02:45.040> depending<00:02:45.670> how<00:02:45.760> big<00:02:45.970> the<00:02:46.090> float<00:02:46.360> is

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
float depending how big the float is

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.630 
float depending how big the float is

have<00:03:20.410> a<00:03:20.440> little<00:03:20.739> grub<00:03:20.950> barb<00:03:21.250> that<00:03:21.489> you<00:03:21.580> can<00:03:21.730> see

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
have a little grub barb that you can see

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.570 
have a little grub barb that you can see
right<00:03:22.150> there<00:03:22.480> so<00:03:23.260> you<00:03:23.350> actually<00:03:23.500> put<00:03:23.800> the<00:03:24.190> tube

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.580 
right there so you actually put the tube

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:26.880 
right there so you actually put the tube
on<00:03:24.790> the<00:03:25.030> hook<00:03:25.209> and<00:03:25.450> then<00:03:25.750> you<00:03:25.959> slide<00:03:26.410> the<00:03:26.650> tube

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
on the hook and then you slide the tube

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.190 
on the hook and then you slide the tube
up<00:03:27.100> tight<00:03:27.370> to<00:03:27.550> the<00:03:27.670> jig<00:03:27.910> head<00:03:28.120> and<00:03:28.330> that<00:03:28.900> grub

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:29.200 
up tight to the jig head and that grub

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.410 
up tight to the jig head and that grub
barb<00:03:29.470> keeps<00:03:29.830> it<00:03:30.040> there<00:03:30.070> so<00:03:30.880> this<00:03:31.030> is<00:03:31.090> very

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
barb keeps it there so this is very

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.240 
barb keeps it there so this is very
popular<00:03:31.959> especially<00:03:32.050> in<00:03:32.440> the<00:03:32.560> US<00:03:32.920> when

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
plastic grubs you can also use some of

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.320 
plastic grubs you can also use some of
the<00:03:59.770> scent<00:04:00.040> impregnated<00:04:00.730> baits<00:04:00.940> so<00:04:01.120> what<00:04:01.209> I'm

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:01.330

the scent impregnated baits so what I'm
holding<00:04:01.450> up<00:04:01.720> here<00:04:02.020> little<00:04:02.290> jars<00:04:02.620> of<00:04:02.950> trigger<00:04:03.880> X

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
holding up here little jars of trigger X

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:06.809 
holding up here little jars of trigger X
so<00:04:04.840> you<00:04:05.410> can<00:04:05.560> see<00:04:05.680> the<00:04:05.830> front<00:04:06.069> it<00:04:06.280> describes

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:06.819 
so you can see the front it describes

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:08.760 
so you can see the front it describes
what<00:04:07.120> the<00:04:07.240> little<00:04:07.510> grubs<00:04:07.780> are<00:04:08.050> and<00:04:08.319> the<00:04:08.500> size

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:08.770 
what the little grubs are and the size

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:10.979 
what the little grubs are and the size
and<00:04:09.220> then<00:04:09.730> you<00:04:10.030> can<00:04:10.209> see<00:04:10.390> through<00:04:10.630> them<00:04:10.780> in<00:04:10.900> the

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:10.989 
and then you can see through them in the

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:13.440 
and then you can see through them in the
back<00:04:11.170> so<00:04:11.440> there's<00:04:11.620> yellow<00:04:12.100> these<00:04:12.700> are<00:04:12.910> orange

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 
back so there's yellow these are orange

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:14.880 
back so there's yellow these are orange
so<00:04:13.660> they<00:04:13.780> come<00:04:13.989> in<00:04:14.110> all<00:04:14.200> different<00:04:14.230> colors<00:04:14.560> now

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:14.890 
so they come in all different colors now

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:16.979 
so they come in all different colors now
the<00:04:15.130> way<00:04:15.280> you<00:04:15.340> can<00:04:15.580> fish<00:04:15.819> these<00:04:16.060> number<00:04:16.780> one

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
the way you can fish these number one

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:19.259 
the way you can fish these number one
you<00:04:17.139> can<00:04:17.290> put<00:04:17.470> them<00:04:17.709> and<00:04:18.190> tip<00:04:18.669> them<00:04:18.850> on<00:04:19.090> your

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:19.269 
you can put them and tip them on your

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:21.150 
you can put them and tip them on your
plastic<00:04:19.780> grubs<00:04:20.049> so<00:04:20.440> I<00:04:20.500> could<00:04:20.650> actually<00:04:20.739> take

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
plastic grubs so I could actually take

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.420 
plastic grubs so I could actually take
one<00:04:21.370> of<00:04:21.459> these<00:04:21.609> small<00:04:22.480> little<00:04:22.740> grubs<00:04:23.740> and<00:04:23.980> this

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
one of these small little grubs and this

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:25.560 
one of these small little grubs and this
is<00:04:24.550> the<00:04:24.610> way<00:04:24.700> they<00:04:24.820> come<00:04:25.030> by<00:04:25.150> the<00:04:25.210> way<00:04:25.390> they<00:04:25.480> all

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
is the way they come by the way they all

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:27.870 
is the way they come by the way they all
come<00:04:25.780> together<00:04:25.930> so<00:04:26.650> I<00:04:26.680> can<00:04:26.919> break<00:04:27.280> off<00:04:27.550> one

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
come together so I can break off one

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.790 
come together so I can break off one
small<00:04:28.330> one<00:04:28.540> this<00:04:28.930> would<00:04:29.140> be<00:04:29.260> like<00:04:29.410> a<00:04:29.440> small

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
small one this would be like a small

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.159 
small one this would be like a small
maggot<00:04:30.250> grub<00:04:30.460> and<00:04:30.730> I<00:04:31.210> can<00:04:31.419> put<00:04:31.630> it<00:04:31.750> right<00:04:31.960> on

00:04:32.159 --> 00:04:32.169 
maggot grub and I can put it right on

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:34.290 
maggot grub and I can put it right on
with<00:04:32.380> my<00:04:32.590> tube<00:04:32.890> and<00:04:33.190> let<00:04:33.610> it<00:04:33.760> hang<00:04:33.970> a<00:04:34.060> little

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
with my tube and let it hang a little

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.600 
with my tube and let it hang a little
bit<00:04:34.480> so<00:04:34.840> it's<00:04:35.020> sense<00:04:35.320> it<00:04:35.560> and<00:04:35.740> it's<00:04:36.460> like

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
bit so it's sense it and it's like

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.790 
bit so it's sense it and it's like
having<00:04:36.910> a<00:04:36.970> little<00:04:37.120> bit<00:04:37.300> of<00:04:37.360> bait<00:04:37.600> only<00:04:37.900> is<00:04:38.050> this

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
having a little bit of bait only is this

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.150 
having a little bit of bait only is this
pheromone<00:04:39.610> impregnated<00:04:40.510> okay<00:04:41.140> trigger<00:04:41.440> X<00:04:41.710> so

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160 
pheromone impregnated okay trigger X so

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.460 
pheromone impregnated okay trigger X so
that's<00:04:42.340> on<00:04:42.550> there<00:04:42.700> right<00:04:42.790> on<00:04:42.850> the<00:04:43.030> hook<00:04:43.240> or<00:04:43.990> if

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
that's on there right on the hook or if

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:46.380 
that's on there right on the hook or if
the<00:04:44.680> fish<00:04:44.860> are<00:04:45.010> really<00:04:45.220> finicky<00:04:45.460> and<00:04:45.940> the

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:46.390 
the fish are really finicky and the

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:48.570 
the fish are really finicky and the
water<00:04:46.600> is<00:04:46.750> clear<00:04:47.140> just<00:04:47.770> take<00:04:47.950> your<00:04:48.070> jig<00:04:48.340> head

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470 
like this one and then put one or two of

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:52.620 
like this one and then put one or two of
the<00:04:50.560> small<00:04:50.860> trigger<00:04:51.130> X<00:04:51.340> grubs<00:04:51.669> on<00:04:51.910> it<00:04:52.090> so

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:52.630 
the small trigger X grubs on it so

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:53.940 
the small trigger X grubs on it so
believe<00:04:52.900> it<00:04:53.020> or<00:04:53.110> not<00:04:53.200> that<00:04:53.470> going<00:04:53.680> in<00:04:53.889> the

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:53.950 
believe it or not that going in the

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:55.830 
believe it or not that going in the
water<00:04:54.190> gives<00:04:54.669> it<00:04:54.790> an<00:04:54.880> action<00:04:55.210> of<00:04:55.360> up<00:04:55.479> and<00:04:55.660> down

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
water gives it an action of up and down

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:57.480 
water gives it an action of up and down
when<00:04:56.200> they<00:04:56.350> get<00:04:56.470> close<00:04:56.680> to<00:04:56.710> it<00:04:56.890> they<00:04:57.040> smell<00:04:57.340> it

00:04:57.480 --> 00:04:57.490 
when they get close to it they smell it

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:59.400 
when they get close to it they smell it
and<00:04:57.610> then<00:04:57.729> they'll<00:04:57.910> grab<00:04:58.120> it<00:04:58.360> so<00:04:58.900> all<00:04:59.200> these
