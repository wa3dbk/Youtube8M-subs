00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
coverage for everyday use it's not a

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.110 
coverage for everyday use it's not a
full<00:00:46.800> coverage<00:00:46.980> foundation<00:00:47.100> but<00:00:47.879> it<00:00:48.000> is<00:00:48.090> a

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
hoola bronzer is 24 and I do definitely

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.370 
hoola bronzer is 24 and I do definitely
prefer<00:01:53.159> this<00:01:53.340> over<00:01:54.149> the<00:01:54.240> hoola<00:01:54.450> bronzer<00:01:54.570> it's

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
definitely recommend any single one of

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.570 
definitely recommend any single one of
these<00:03:21.959> palettes<00:03:22.380> they<00:03:22.530> are<00:03:22.620> all<00:03:22.769> amazing<00:03:23.250> they

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
these palettes they are all amazing they

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.850 
these palettes they are all amazing they
are<00:03:23.610> all<00:03:23.850> so<00:03:24.120> pigmented<00:03:24.510> and<00:03:24.989> you<00:03:25.380> get<00:03:25.560> a<00:03:25.590> lot

for your money

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.040 
for your money
I<00:03:26.430> think<00:03:26.610> these<00:03:26.820> palettes<00:03:27.300> are<00:03:27.480> about<00:03:27.750> four

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
I think these palettes are about four

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:29.720 
I think these palettes are about four
pounds<00:03:28.230> and<00:03:28.500> I<00:03:28.830> think<00:03:29.010> the<00:03:29.100> most<00:03:29.280> expensive

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
pounds and I think the most expensive

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.330 
pounds and I think the most expensive
palette<00:03:30.239> is<00:03:30.420> ten<00:03:31.200> pound<00:03:31.470> so<00:03:32.040> I<00:03:32.070> definitely

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 
palette is ten pound so I definitely

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:34.820 
palette is ten pound so I definitely
recommend<00:03:32.580> picking<00:03:33.390> one<00:03:33.690> up<00:03:33.840> and<00:03:34.019> these<00:03:34.769> are

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
recommend picking one up and these are

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.729 
recommend picking one up and these are
in<00:03:35.280> most<00:03:35.610> super<00:03:35.940> drugs<00:03:36.180> and<00:03:36.480> if<00:03:37.110> not<00:03:37.380> you<00:03:37.560> can

it's just as good it's just as
lengthening<00:04:57.970> and<00:04:58.240> it<00:04:58.660> is<00:04:58.750> just<00:04:58.990> it's

00:04:59.129 --> 00:04:59.139 
lengthening and it is just it's

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:01.770 
lengthening and it is just it's
separating<00:04:59.770> and<00:05:00.040> I<00:05:00.850> doesn't<00:05:01.330> recommend<00:05:01.540> this

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:01.780 
separating and I doesn't recommend this

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.560 
separating and I doesn't recommend this
this<00:05:01.930> is<00:05:02.110> only<00:05:02.290> 5<00:05:02.650> pound<00:05:02.979> and<00:05:03.400> you<00:05:04.210> can't<00:05:04.419> go

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:04.570 
this is only 5 pound and you can't go

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:06.270 
this is only 5 pound and you can't go
wrong<00:05:04.690> with<00:05:04.750> 5<00:05:05.020> pound<00:05:05.320> when<00:05:05.950> you're<00:05:06.070> getting<00:05:06.130> a

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:06.280 
wrong with 5 pound when you're getting a

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.960 
wrong with 5 pound when you're getting a
really<00:05:06.460> good<00:05:06.669> decent<00:05:06.880> mascara<00:05:07.479> so<00:05:08.669> yes

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:09.970 
really good decent mascara so yes

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:11.730 
really good decent mascara so yes
next<00:05:10.270> I<00:05:10.360> have<00:05:10.389> an<00:05:10.750> eyeliner<00:05:11.139> so<00:05:11.410> this<00:05:11.530> is<00:05:11.650> the

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:11.740 
next I have an eyeliner so this is the

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:14.280 
next I have an eyeliner so this is the
collection<00:05:12.160> extreme<00:05:12.729> 24-hour<00:05:13.479> felt<00:05:14.080> tip

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:14.290 
collection extreme 24-hour felt tip

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:17.010 
collection extreme 24-hour felt tip
liner<00:05:14.470> so<00:05:15.100> this<00:05:15.190> is<00:05:15.280> just<00:05:15.430> a<00:05:15.610> average<00:05:16.479> that's

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:17.020 
liner so this is just a average that's

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:18.540 
liner so this is just a average that's
it<00:05:17.200> liner<00:05:17.410> really<00:05:17.650> but<00:05:18.130> this<00:05:18.250> is<00:05:18.370> definitely

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:18.550 
it liner really but this is definitely

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:20.070 
it liner really but this is definitely
worth<00:05:18.880> all<00:05:19.180> the<00:05:19.300> money<00:05:19.330> that<00:05:19.600> you<00:05:19.690> pay<00:05:19.870> it<00:05:19.990> I

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:20.080 
worth all the money that you pay it I

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.469 
worth all the money that you pay it I
think<00:05:20.289> this<00:05:20.410> is<00:05:20.580> 299<00:05:21.580> so<00:05:21.820> basically<00:05:22.150> three

00:05:22.469 --> 00:05:22.479 
think this is 299 so basically three

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:24.510 
think this is 299 so basically three
pounds<00:05:22.840> and<00:05:22.990> you<00:05:23.620> get<00:05:23.770> a<00:05:23.800> lot<00:05:23.979> of<00:05:24.010> product<00:05:24.400> and

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:24.520 
pounds and you get a lot of product and

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:27.029 
pounds and you get a lot of product and
it<00:05:24.610> doesn't<00:05:24.910> last<00:05:25.000> ages<00:05:25.900> and<00:05:26.169> I'm<00:05:26.710> not<00:05:26.860> sure

00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:27.039 
it doesn't last ages and I'm not sure

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:28.890 
it doesn't last ages and I'm not sure
how<00:05:27.190> long<00:05:27.220> I've<00:05:27.460> had<00:05:27.580> this<00:05:27.760> book<00:05:28.060> it<00:05:28.780> is

00:06:13.589 --> 00:06:13.599 
this is like a lobster finish I am and

00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:15.300 
this is like a lobster finish I am and
it<00:06:13.720> has<00:06:13.870> got<00:06:14.050> a<00:06:14.289> little<00:06:14.470> bit<00:06:14.650> of<00:06:14.800> glitter<00:06:15.039> in<00:06:15.160> it

it has got a little bit of glitter in it

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:17.610 
it has got a little bit of glitter in it
however<00:06:16.000> this<00:06:16.120> is<00:06:16.300> a<00:06:16.330> beautiful<00:06:16.810> color<00:06:16.990> and<00:06:17.229> I

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:17.620 
however this is a beautiful color and I

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:19.620 
however this is a beautiful color and I
tend<00:06:18.250> to<00:06:18.280> wear<00:06:18.460> this<00:06:18.580> quite<00:06:18.820> a<00:06:18.849> lot<00:06:19.060> for<00:06:19.240> school

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:19.630 
tend to wear this quite a lot for school

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:22.320 
tend to wear this quite a lot for school
and<00:06:19.960> because<00:06:20.950> it's<00:06:21.070> quite<00:06:21.250> natural<00:06:21.430> so<00:06:22.090> I

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:22.330 
and because it's quite natural so I

00:06:22.330 --> 00:06:24.029 
and because it's quite natural so I
definitely<00:06:22.690> recommend<00:06:23.260> this<00:06:23.530> and<00:06:23.770> I<00:06:23.800> think

00:06:24.029 --> 00:06:24.039 
definitely recommend this and I think

00:06:24.039 --> 00:06:26.490 
definitely recommend this and I think
this<00:06:24.700> is<00:06:24.849> about<00:06:24.910> 7<00:06:25.389> pounds<00:06:25.840> so<00:06:26.080> it's<00:06:26.229> not<00:06:26.349> too

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:26.500 
this is about 7 pounds so it's not too

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:28.409 
this is about 7 pounds so it's not too
expensive<00:06:26.620> and<00:06:27.280> it<00:06:27.430> is<00:06:27.490> definitely<00:06:27.940> about

00:06:28.409 --> 00:06:28.419 
expensive and it is definitely about

00:06:28.419 --> 00:06:30.210 
expensive and it is definitely about
half<00:06:28.660> the<00:06:28.810> price<00:06:28.990> of<00:06:29.020> a<00:06:29.349> matte<00:06:29.530> lipstick<00:06:29.979> and

half the price of a matte lipstick and

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:33.690
