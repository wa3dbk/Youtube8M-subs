click here's how to wire it up fire goes

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.150 
click here's how to wire it up fire goes
to<00:00:40.710> fire<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:41.190> then<00:00:42.079> entity<00:00:43.079> goes<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:43.890> real

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
to fire and then entity goes to real

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.069 
to fire and then entity goes to real
target<00:00:44.640> and<00:00:44.850> that's<00:00:45.180> all<00:00:45.360> you<00:00:45.629> need<00:00:45.750> to<00:00:45.870> do<00:00:45.960> on

target and that's all you need to do on

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.650 
target and that's all you need to do on
that<00:00:46.230> side<00:00:46.440> now<00:00:46.649> this<00:00:47.070> thing's<00:00:47.280> target<00:00:47.789> goes

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
that side now this thing's target goes

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.580 
that side now this thing's target goes
to<00:00:49.020> the<00:00:49.469> target<00:00:49.920> from<00:00:50.129> inside<00:00:50.520> of<00:00:50.760> here<00:00:51.149> and

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:51.590 
to the target from inside of here and

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.619 
to the target from inside of here and
then<00:00:52.590> this<00:00:52.800> thing's<00:00:53.039> active<00:00:53.550> also<00:00:54.210> goes<00:00:54.449> to

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
then this thing's active also goes to

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.930 
then this thing's active also goes to
those<00:00:54.780> two<00:00:55.050> the<00:00:55.770> target<00:00:56.100> finder<00:00:56.250> is<00:00:56.460> one<00:00:56.670> and

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
those two the target finder is one and

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.060 
those two the target finder is one and
this<00:00:57.420> one's<00:00:57.690> active<00:00:58.079> also<00:00:58.350> goes<00:00:58.620> to<00:00:58.770> target

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
this one's active also goes to target

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.040 
this one's active also goes to target
finders<00:00:59.370> one<00:00:59.520> now<00:01:00.239> we<00:01:00.300> will<00:01:00.629> not<00:01:00.780> shoot<00:01:00.930> it

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
lower alright move it out couple notches

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.479 
lower alright move it out couple notches
now<00:02:24.090> I'm<00:02:24.150> just<00:02:24.330> going<00:02:24.450> to<00:02:24.510> walled<00:02:24.720> it<00:02:24.810> to<00:02:24.989> here

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489 
now I'm just going to walled it to here

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:27.940 
now I'm just going to walled it to here
and<00:02:26.489> then<00:02:26.610> hold<00:02:26.730> this<00:02:26.940> one<00:02:27.120> to<00:02:27.209> here<00:02:27.480> and<00:02:27.660> now

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
and then hold this one to here and now

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.780 
and then hold this one to here and now
the<00:02:28.950> target<00:02:29.280> finder<00:02:29.459> will<00:02:30.030> find<00:02:30.510> targets

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
the target finder will find targets

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.330 
the target finder will find targets
it<00:02:33.360> will<00:02:33.510> only<00:02:33.870> find<00:02:34.170> NPCs<00:02:34.680> though<00:02:34.890> which<00:02:35.190> is

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
it will only find NPCs though which is

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.119 
it will only find NPCs though which is
kind<00:02:35.610> of<00:02:35.640> a<00:02:35.730> good<00:02:35.849> thing<00:02:36.290> so<00:02:37.290> if<00:02:37.379> I<00:02:37.470> put<00:02:37.650> like<00:02:37.860> a

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:38.129 
kind of a good thing so if I put like a

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:40.070 
kind of a good thing so if I put like a
I'm<00:02:38.970> gonna<00:02:39.120> make<00:02:39.209> sure<00:02:39.299> he's<00:02:39.420> not<00:02:39.540> close<00:02:39.690> okay

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
I'm gonna make sure he's not close okay

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.530 
I'm gonna make sure he's not close okay
put<00:02:40.830> an<00:02:40.950> antlion<00:02:41.220> guard<00:02:41.340> down<00:02:41.670> here<00:02:42.470> just<00:02:44.540> okay

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:45.540 
put an antlion guard down here just okay

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.390 
put an antlion guard down here just okay
stay<00:02:46.049> there<00:02:46.769> good<00:02:47.489> boy<00:02:47.670> um<00:02:48.560> NPCs<00:02:49.560> disabled

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
stay there good boy um NPCs disabled

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.680 
stay there good boy um NPCs disabled
thinking<00:02:50.519> okay<00:02:51.030> so<00:02:51.360> now<00:02:52.579> um<00:02:53.579> but<00:02:54.000> these<00:02:54.360> things

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
thinking okay so now um but these things

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.050 
thinking okay so now um but these things
will<00:02:54.959> do<00:02:55.110> is<00:02:55.410> they<00:02:55.650> will<00:02:55.680> shoot<00:02:56.099> the<00:02:56.459> target<00:02:56.910> if

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
will do is they will shoot the target if

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.000 
will do is they will shoot the target if
they<00:02:57.360> have<00:02:57.540> energy<00:02:57.750> which<00:02:58.349> is<00:02:58.500> one<00:02:58.680> doing<00:02:58.950> I

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
they have energy which is one doing I

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:00.110 
they have energy which is one doing I
didn't<00:02:59.190> give<00:02:59.280> it<00:02:59.340> energy<00:02:59.459> purposefully

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
didn't give it energy purposefully

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.479 
didn't give it energy purposefully
because<00:03:00.299> that<00:03:00.569> way<00:03:00.720> won't<00:03:01.470> like<00:03:01.680> accidentally

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:02.489 
because that way won't like accidentally

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:09.229 
because that way won't like accidentally
destroy<00:03:03.239> anything<00:03:05.780> and<00:03:07.400> there<00:03:08.400> they<00:03:08.819> got<00:03:09.000> the

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
destroy anything and there they got the

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:12.080 
destroy anything and there they got the
antlion<00:03:09.510> guard<00:03:09.660> and<00:03:10.489> apparently<00:03:11.489> themselves

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
antlion guard and apparently themselves

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.559 
antlion guard and apparently themselves
nope<00:03:12.870> just<00:03:12.959> kidding<00:03:13.319> um<00:03:13.459> but<00:03:14.459> if<00:03:15.030> I<00:03:15.180> put<00:03:15.359> the

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:15.569 
nope just kidding um but if I put the

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:20.000 
nope just kidding um but if I put the
antlion<00:03:15.840> guard<00:03:15.930> over<00:03:16.200> here<00:03:17.900> only<00:03:18.900> they<00:03:19.769> both

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
antlion guard over here only they both

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.759 
antlion guard over here only they both
shoot<00:03:20.280> but<00:03:21.120> the<00:03:21.810> other<00:03:21.930> one<00:03:22.200> will<00:03:22.380> only<00:03:22.500> shoot

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
shoot but the other one will only shoot

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:27.280 
shoot but the other one will only shoot
and<00:03:23.040> the<00:03:23.400> other<00:03:23.519> one<00:03:23.639> will<00:03:23.760> not<00:03:24.709> should<00:03:25.709> not

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
and the other one will not should not

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.960 
and the other one will not should not
umm<00:03:28.290> but<00:03:29.190> pretty<00:03:29.370> much<00:03:29.430> that's<00:03:29.670> how<00:03:29.790> that

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
umm but pretty much that's how that

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.099 
umm but pretty much that's how that
system<00:03:30.120> works<00:03:30.269> it's<00:03:30.569> pretty<00:03:30.720> simple<00:03:30.930> to<00:03:31.019> get

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:31.109 
system works it's pretty simple to get

00:03:31.109 --> 00:03:35.259 
system works it's pretty simple to get
the<00:03:31.200> weapons<00:03:31.470> working<00:03:31.910> and<00:03:32.910> another<00:03:33.600> thing<00:03:33.959> is

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269 
the weapons working and another thing is

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:38.900 
the weapons working and another thing is
shields<00:03:36.269> very<00:03:37.049> important<00:03:37.440> so<00:03:38.190> I've<00:03:38.609> heard

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
shields very important so I've heard

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:40.430 
shields very important so I've heard
your<00:03:39.120> shield<00:03:39.299> cores<00:03:39.600> over<00:03:39.959> these<00:03:40.200> shield

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
your shield cores over these shield

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.590 
your shield cores over these shield
generators<00:03:40.889> because<00:03:41.310> they<00:03:41.670> offer<00:03:42.090> a<00:03:42.299> number

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600 
generators because they offer a number

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.650 
generators because they offer a number
of<00:03:42.750> advantages<00:03:43.730> mostly<00:03:44.730> that<00:03:45.000> they<00:03:45.180> could

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
of advantages mostly that they could

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.900 
of advantages mostly that they could
take<00:03:46.230> less<00:03:46.440> energy<00:03:46.560> to<00:03:47.010> use<00:03:47.250> because<00:03:47.639> less

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
take less energy to use because less

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.430 
take less energy to use because less
energy<00:03:48.239> is<00:03:48.420> good<00:03:50.269> because<00:03:51.269> the<00:03:51.630> formula

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
energy is good because the formula

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.740 
energy is good because the formula
involves<00:03:53.040> using<00:03:53.280> the<00:03:53.400> area<00:03:53.700> of<00:03:54.180> the<00:03:54.510> shield

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
involves using the area of the shield

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.069 
involves using the area of the shield
and<00:03:54.930> the<00:03:55.530> area<00:03:55.829> of<00:03:55.980> a<00:03:56.069> sphere<00:03:56.220> is<00:03:56.609> I<00:03:57.569> mean<00:03:57.930> it's

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079 
and the area of a sphere is I mean it's

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:01.160 
and the area of a sphere is I mean it's
not<00:03:58.170> greater<00:03:58.470> but<00:03:58.799> like<00:03:59.690> how<00:04:00.690> the<00:04:00.750> shield

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
not greater but like how the shield

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:02.360 
not greater but like how the shield
generator<00:04:01.500> works<00:04:01.650> like<00:04:01.829> you<00:04:01.980> you<00:04:02.190> usually

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
generator works like you you usually

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.879 
generator works like you you usually
don't<00:04:02.670> build<00:04:02.849> spherical<00:04:03.269> ships<00:04:03.480> so<00:04:04.380> it's<00:04:04.680> less

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:04.889 
don't build spherical ships so it's less

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:06.319 
don't build spherical ships so it's less
efficient<00:04:05.370> because<00:04:05.669> there's<00:04:05.819> so<00:04:05.940> much<00:04:06.030> empty

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:06.329 
efficient because there's so much empty

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:10.129 
efficient because there's so much empty
space<00:04:07.310> the<00:04:08.310> shield<00:04:08.579> core<00:04:08.880> however<00:04:09.329> is<00:04:09.540> much

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:10.139 
space the shield core however is much

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:12.470 
space the shield core however is much
better<00:04:10.380> for<00:04:11.280> reasons<00:04:11.669> I<00:04:11.760> will<00:04:11.819> detail<00:04:12.239> in<00:04:12.419> a

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
better for reasons I will detail in a

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.400 
better for reasons I will detail in a
couple<00:04:12.510> seconds<00:04:12.959> once<00:04:13.139> I<00:04:13.230> can<00:04:13.349> actually<00:04:13.470> see

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.410 
couple seconds once I can actually see

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:18.130 
couple seconds once I can actually see
okay<00:04:16.220> so<00:04:16.790> move<00:04:17.120> this<00:04:17.270> out<00:04:17.390> here<00:04:17.600> so<00:04:17.810> if<00:04:17.870> I<00:04:17.930> click

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:18.140 
okay so move this out here so if I click

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:20.860 
okay so move this out here so if I click
on<00:04:18.200> this<00:04:18.380> and<00:04:18.560> then<00:04:19.310> if<00:04:19.430> you<00:04:19.610> can<00:04:19.790> drag<00:04:20.209> these

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
on this and then if you can drag these

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.340 
on this and then if you can drag these
and<00:04:21.170> you<00:04:21.230> know<00:04:21.260> seal<00:04:21.770> gets<00:04:21.980> longer<00:04:22.460> and<00:04:23.350> wider

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.350 
and you know seal gets longer and wider

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:30.280 
and you know seal gets longer and wider
for<00:04:24.950> Colorado<00:04:25.460> and<00:04:27.220> wider<00:04:28.420> become<00:04:29.420> wider<00:04:29.630> okay

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:30.290 
for Colorado and wider become wider okay

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:33.850 
for Colorado and wider become wider okay
now<00:04:31.390> you<00:04:32.390> can<00:04:32.450> tell<00:04:32.870> that<00:04:33.110> the<00:04:33.260> ship<00:04:33.470> is<00:04:33.590> bigger

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
now you can tell that the ship is bigger

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:36.550 
now you can tell that the ship is bigger
I<00:04:34.130> mean<00:04:34.490> that<00:04:34.610> shield<00:04:34.910> is<00:04:35.120> more<00:04:35.960> more<00:04:36.290> or<00:04:36.440> less

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 
I mean that shield is more more or less

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.440 
I mean that shield is more more or less
fitted<00:04:36.950> to<00:04:37.070> the<00:04:37.190> ship<00:04:37.400> it's<00:04:37.580> not<00:04:37.730> like<00:04:37.940> exactly

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:38.450 
fitted to the ship it's not like exactly

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:41.770 
fitted to the ship it's not like exactly
or<00:04:38.600> anything<00:04:39.310> but<00:04:40.310> it<00:04:40.460> is<00:04:40.580> closer<00:04:40.910> which<00:04:41.630> is

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
or anything but it is closer which is

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.240 
or anything but it is closer which is
kind<00:04:41.990> of<00:04:42.050> the<00:04:42.200> point<00:04:42.350> it's<00:04:42.620> the<00:04:42.740> point<00:04:43.070> of<00:04:43.130> this

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250 
kind of the point it's the point of this

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:45.420 
kind of the point it's the point of this
is<00:04:43.400> just<00:04:43.430> make<00:04:43.730> it<00:04:43.850> as<00:04:43.970> efficient<00:04:44.480> as<00:04:44.600> possible

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
is just make it as efficient as possible

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.070 
is just make it as efficient as possible
or<00:04:46.430> at<00:04:47.060> least<00:04:47.210> more<00:04:47.390> efficient<00:04:47.690> than<00:04:47.780> using<00:04:47.810> a

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.080 
or at least more efficient than using a

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.810 
or at least more efficient than using a
sphere<00:04:48.410> because<00:04:48.530> with<00:04:48.740> a<00:04:48.770> sphere<00:04:49.190> it<00:04:49.490> would<00:04:49.610> be

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:49.820 
sphere because with a sphere it would be

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:53.110 
sphere because with a sphere it would be
many<00:04:50.510> times<00:04:50.930> larger<00:04:51.440> than<00:04:51.770> this<00:04:51.950> anyway<00:04:52.820> I<00:04:52.850> put

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:53.120 
many times larger than this anyway I put

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.400 
many times larger than this anyway I put
on<00:04:53.240> always<00:04:53.420> a<00:04:53.540> bubble<00:04:53.930> so<00:04:54.050> I<00:04:54.080> can<00:04:54.200> make<00:04:54.290> sure

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:54.410 
on always a bubble so I can make sure

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:57.700 
on always a bubble so I can make sure
it's<00:04:54.560> covering<00:04:54.770> the<00:04:54.860> entire<00:04:54.950> ship<00:04:55.430> and<00:04:56.560> it<00:04:57.560> is

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.710 
it's covering the entire ship and it is

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:01.060 
it's covering the entire ship and it is
so<00:04:58.840> now<00:04:59.840> this<00:05:00.020> is<00:05:00.080> a<00:05:00.230> lot<00:05:00.440> more<00:05:00.590> efficient<00:05:00.950> than

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:01.070 
so now this is a lot more efficient than

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:03.130 
so now this is a lot more efficient than
it<00:05:01.160> would<00:05:01.280> have<00:05:01.400> been<00:05:01.610> if<00:05:01.820> it<00:05:01.970> was<00:05:02.300> like<00:05:02.870> I

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:03.140 
it would have been if it was like I

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:05.650 
it would have been if it was like I
don't<00:05:03.530> know<00:05:03.650> something<00:05:04.040> else<00:05:04.330> like<00:05:05.330> one<00:05:05.540> of

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:05.660 
don't know something else like one of

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:08.140 
don't know something else like one of
those<00:05:05.720> spherical<00:05:06.230> ones<00:05:06.790> because<00:05:07.790> it<00:05:08.060> would

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.150 
those spherical ones because it would

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:10.900 
those spherical ones because it would
have<00:05:08.270> been<00:05:08.510> that<00:05:09.470> wide<00:05:09.830> and<00:05:10.160> that<00:05:10.370> tall<00:05:10.670> and

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:10.910 
have been that wide and that tall and

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:13.120 
have been that wide and that tall and
that<00:05:11.060> wild<00:05:11.600> and<00:05:11.870> I<00:05:12.080> mean<00:05:12.500> end<00:05:12.650> up<00:05:12.770> long<00:05:12.920> it

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:13.130 
that wild and I mean end up long it

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:17.140 
that wild and I mean end up long it
doesn't<00:05:13.400> need<00:05:13.550> to<00:05:13.730> be<00:05:14.830> so<00:05:15.830> good<00:05:16.220> things<00:05:16.490> now

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:17.150 
doesn't need to be so good things now

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:18.670 
doesn't need to be so good things now
you<00:05:17.210> want<00:05:17.600> to<00:05:17.660> put<00:05:17.780> to<00:05:17.870> strengthen<00:05:18.380> this<00:05:18.440> all

00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:18.680 
you want to put to strengthen this all

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.080 
you want to put to strengthen this all
the<00:05:18.800> way<00:05:18.920> up<00:05:19.130> because<00:05:19.430> even<00:05:19.850> though<00:05:19.940> it'll

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:20.090 
the way up because even though it'll

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:24.310 
the way up because even though it'll
take<00:05:20.300> a<00:05:20.330> lot<00:05:20.480> more<00:05:20.660> power<00:05:21.070> it<00:05:22.070> will<00:05:22.340> need<00:05:23.320> is

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:24.320 
take a lot more power it will need is

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.560 
take a lot more power it will need is
also<00:05:24.740> the<00:05:25.550> shield<00:05:25.820> these<00:05:26.120> shields<00:05:26.390> are<00:05:26.480> not

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:26.570 
also the shield these shields are not

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:28.720 
also the shield these shields are not
very<00:05:26.810> strong<00:05:27.170> so<00:05:27.800> you<00:05:28.160> may<00:05:28.280> want<00:05:28.520> to<00:05:28.550> be<00:05:28.640> as

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:28.730 
very strong so you may want to be as

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:30.850 
very strong so you may want to be as
strong<00:05:29.000> as<00:05:29.210> powerful<00:05:29.630> or<00:05:29.810> as<00:05:30.470> strong<00:05:30.710> as

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:30.860 
strong as powerful or as strong as

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.010 
strong as powerful or as strong as
possible<00:05:30.980> so<00:05:31.610> that's<00:05:32.270> actually<00:05:32.480> it<00:05:32.720> for<00:05:32.900> this

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:33.020 
possible so that's actually it for this

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:37.180 
possible so that's actually it for this
one<00:05:33.260> and<00:05:33.500> your<00:05:34.010> spaceship<00:05:34.430> is<00:05:35.980> pretty<00:05:36.980> much

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:37.190 
one and your spaceship is pretty much

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:39.340 
one and your spaceship is pretty much
complete<00:05:37.750> congratulations<00:05:38.750> you<00:05:39.110> finished

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:39.350 
complete congratulations you finished

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:41.080 
complete congratulations you finished
your<00:05:39.650> spaceship<00:05:40.010> um<00:05:40.250> there<00:05:40.790> might<00:05:40.910> be<00:05:40.970> a

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:41.090 
your spaceship um there might be a

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:43.240 
your spaceship um there might be a
couple<00:05:41.210> more<00:05:41.420> things<00:05:41.630> you<00:05:41.780> want<00:05:41.960> to<00:05:42.020> do<00:05:42.250> but

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:43.250 
couple more things you want to do but

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:44.530 
couple more things you want to do but
the<00:05:43.460> most<00:05:43.670> part<00:05:43.880> you<00:05:43.940> don't<00:05:44.120> actually<00:05:44.210> need<00:05:44.480> to

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:44.540 
the most part you don't actually need to

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:48.850 
the most part you don't actually need to
do<00:05:44.720> any<00:05:44.900> of<00:05:44.990> them<00:05:45.170> so<00:05:45.500> just<00:05:46.280> go<00:05:46.670> have<00:05:46.820> fun
