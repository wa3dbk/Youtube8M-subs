 p12 cammas 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.429
 but also 

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:23.429
 the notes that constitute the agreements 

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:28.099
 right here 

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:32.570
 I'm going to be interested in the chu foreman in uppercase red bridge that indicated 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.570
 degrees in other words the place of each note in a range 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.830
 first degree levin therefore concerns the tone of the range 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.280
 well ando i'm michy forum lightened the notes of the back range 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.370
 4 5 6 this 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.050
 a debrÃ© back 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:55.880
 promised 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.670
 twenty-five ground if this this city 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.820
 dorignies by it is not good 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:04.820
 q if those who vote this circle 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:08.380
 I'm going first to the radius of the range of re 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.900
 I immediately spot Cambrai 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.140
 there is a sharp sharp in the range of reindeer 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.070
 and I count 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:18.670
 it means form 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.620
 second degree 

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.930
 third degree fadi is therefore the first tier what appears one has the 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.000
 choice between weekends choose it to goddess because I know 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.160
 sanitized here you just said ma'am maintain credit s 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.220
 for the third 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.260
 4th degree ground 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:34.880
 5th degree 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.170
 sixth degree here it was a duration 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.430
 the choice between two odious alveoli it is second third 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.500
 to prepare in the same field remy fadi to that if do sharp emanates from the 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:46.210
 swim 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.610
 and pivoting like that on the 12 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.680
 the tone I want to find all the notes that constitutes major damage 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.900
 who says that a major also says of course major chords 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.280
 they are surrounded here
