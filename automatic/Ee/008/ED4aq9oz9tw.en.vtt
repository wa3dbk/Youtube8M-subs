whole because if they have the cells as
well<00:01:19.719> as<00:01:19.780> possible<00:01:20.409> on<00:01:20.619> their<00:01:21.130> bridge<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:22.479> try

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:22.630 
well as possible on their bridge to try

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:23.999 
well as possible on their bridge to try
and<00:01:22.750> lower<00:01:22.869> the<00:01:22.990> action<00:01:23.350> and<00:01:23.619> they<00:01:23.740> still

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:24.009 
and lower the action and they still

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:25.380 
and lower the action and they still
can't<00:01:24.280> get<00:01:24.369> low<00:01:24.549> enough<00:01:24.579> to<00:01:24.909> get<00:01:25.030> the<00:01:25.149> action

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
can't get low enough to get the action

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.810 
can't get low enough to get the action
they<00:01:25.539> want<00:01:25.780> they'll<00:01:26.500> need<00:01:26.740> to<00:01:26.950> raise<00:01:27.430> the<00:01:27.640> neck

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:27.820 
they want they'll need to raise the neck

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.999 
they want they'll need to raise the neck
so<00:01:28.240> then<00:01:28.420> the<00:01:28.600> saddles<00:01:29.350> don't<00:01:29.530> have<00:01:29.619> to<00:01:29.740> go<00:01:29.829> out

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:30.009 
so then the saddles don't have to go out

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:32.940 
so then the saddles don't have to go out
a<00:01:30.039> lot<00:01:30.929> now<00:01:31.929> these<00:01:32.079> are<00:01:32.229> the<00:01:32.259> main<00:01:32.469> reasons<00:01:32.500> why

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
a lot now these are the main reasons why

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.700 
a lot now these are the main reasons why
people<00:01:32.979> use<00:01:33.460> shims<00:01:33.729> and<00:01:34.060> I'll<00:01:34.840> go<00:01:35.049> into<00:01:35.439> it<00:01:35.679> a

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:35.710 
people use shims and I'll go into it a

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.919 
people use shims and I'll go into it a
bit<00:01:35.859> more<00:01:36.009> in<00:01:36.100> depth<00:01:36.369> when<00:01:36.670> I<00:01:36.789> when<00:01:37.539> I<00:01:37.630> start

00:01:37.919 --> 00:01:37.929 
bit more in depth when I when I start

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:42.419 
bit more in depth when I when I start
doing<00:01:38.079> my<00:01:38.469> strap<00:01:38.950> which<00:01:39.100> I'm<00:01:39.250> gonna<00:01:39.399> day<00:01:41.429> now

00:01:42.419 --> 00:01:42.429 
doing my strap which I'm gonna day now

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:43.770 
doing my strap which I'm gonna day now
there's<00:01:42.640> a<00:01:42.759> there's<00:01:43.090> a<00:01:43.149> big<00:01:43.329> debate<00:01:43.450> online

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
there's a there's a big debate online

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.529 
there's a there's a big debate online
and<00:01:44.740> there's<00:01:44.859> a<00:01:44.920> few<00:01:45.100> arguments<00:01:45.340> about<00:01:45.640> the

00:01:46.529 --> 00:01:46.539 
and there's a few arguments about the

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:49.380 
and there's a few arguments about the
possible<00:01:47.020> loss<00:01:47.289> in<00:01:47.619> tone<00:01:48.100> and<00:01:48.219> sustain<00:01:48.700> when

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
possible loss in tone and sustain when

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.709 
possible loss in tone and sustain when
using<00:01:49.630> the<00:01:49.810> ship<00:01:50.310> now<00:01:51.340> me<00:01:51.789> myself<00:01:51.969> optioned<00:01:52.600> a

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:52.719 
using the ship now me myself optioned a

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:55.080 
using the ship now me myself optioned a
few<00:01:52.929> guitars<00:01:53.259> and<00:01:53.679> I<00:01:53.799> haven't<00:01:54.579> seen<00:01:54.759> too<00:01:54.939> much

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
few guitars and I haven't seen too much

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.690 
few guitars and I haven't seen too much
of<00:01:55.149> a<00:01:55.359> difference<00:01:56.009> but<00:01:57.009> the<00:01:57.399> way<00:01:57.549> I<00:01:57.579> think

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
of a difference but the way I think

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.169 
of a difference but the way I think
about<00:01:58.090> it<00:01:58.270> is<00:01:59.069> it's<00:02:00.069> all<00:02:00.249> a<00:02:00.280> compromise<00:02:00.880> you

00:02:01.169 --> 00:02:01.179 
about it is it's all a compromise you

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:03.959 
about it is it's all a compromise you
know<00:02:01.299> I<00:02:01.539> mean<00:02:02.289> the<00:02:03.130> reason<00:02:03.310> why<00:02:03.579> most<00:02:03.759> people

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:03.969 
know I mean the reason why most people

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:05.819 
know I mean the reason why most people
shimmer<00:02:04.509> guitar<00:02:04.869> is<00:02:05.170> to<00:02:05.499> increase

shimmer guitar is to increase

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:09.029 
shimmer guitar is to increase
playability<00:02:06.310> and<00:02:06.810> ease<00:02:07.810> a<00:02:07.869> platinum<00:02:08.500> on<00:02:08.740> back

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:09.039 
playability and ease a platinum on back

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
at all I saw an out and setting it up

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:14.070 
at all I saw an out and setting it up
properly<00:02:11.740> to<00:02:11.950> how<00:02:12.100> they<00:02:12.280> want<00:02:12.480> now<00:02:13.480> if<00:02:13.810> that's

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
properly to how they want now if that's

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.570 
properly to how they want now if that's
your<00:02:14.319> goal<00:02:14.350> and<00:02:14.860> that's<00:02:15.190> a<00:02:15.280> bit<00:02:15.430> more

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:15.580 
your goal and that's a bit more

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.300 
your goal and that's a bit more
important<00:02:16.090> than<00:02:16.240> the<00:02:16.360> loss<00:02:16.510> of<00:02:16.740> tone<00:02:17.740> sustain

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
important than the loss of tone sustain

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.970 
important than the loss of tone sustain

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
now I'll say an earlier about changing

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.960 
now I'll say an earlier about changing
the<00:02:47.020> neck<00:02:47.200> ankle<00:02:47.650> to<00:02:47.860> do<00:02:48.070> with<00:02:48.340> the<00:02:48.670> intonation

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
the neck ankle to do with the intonation

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.200 
the neck ankle to do with the intonation
and<00:02:49.570> action<00:02:49.990> issues<00:02:50.350> now<00:02:51.220> see<00:02:51.430> if<00:02:51.700> you<00:02:51.730> can<00:02:51.880> see

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:52.210 
and action issues now see if you can see

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:55.170 
and action issues now see if you can see
moisture<00:02:52.390> up<00:02:52.780> close<00:02:53.260> up<00:02:53.880> you'll<00:02:54.880> see<00:02:54.970> that

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
moisture up close up you'll see that

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.500 
moisture up close up you'll see that
it's<00:02:55.540> got<00:02:56.190> quite<00:02:57.190> a<00:02:57.370> nice<00:02:57.670> maybe<00:02:58.060> a<00:02:58.210> bit<00:02:58.390> too

00:02:58.500 --> 00:02:58.510 
it's got quite a nice maybe a bit too

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.980 
it's got quite a nice maybe a bit too
high<00:02:58.720> action<00:02:59.190> towards<00:03:00.190> not<00:03:00.460> okay<00:03:00.850> I<00:03:01.060> mean<00:03:01.870> this

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:01.990 
high action towards not okay I mean this

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:03.750 
high action towards not okay I mean this
gradually<00:03:02.500> gets<00:03:02.680> taller<00:03:02.950> which<00:03:03.160> is<00:03:03.310> natural

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
gradually gets taller which is natural

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.940 
gradually gets taller which is natural
for<00:03:04.030> a<00:03:04.090> guitar<00:03:04.450> but<00:03:05.440> the<00:03:05.470> problem<00:03:05.800> I'm<00:03:05.920> having

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
for a guitar but the problem I'm having

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.740 
for a guitar but the problem I'm having
is<00:03:06.400> I<00:03:06.610> find<00:03:07.090> it<00:03:07.240> gets<00:03:07.390> a<00:03:07.510> bit<00:03:07.720> too<00:03:07.960> high<00:03:08.290> for<00:03:08.980> me

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
is I find it gets a bit too high for me

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.970 
is I find it gets a bit too high for me
towards<00:03:10.750> the<00:03:10.870> top<00:03:10.900> frets<00:03:11.350> and<00:03:11.620> this<00:03:11.830> is

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
towards the top frets and this is

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.700 
towards the top frets and this is
because<00:03:12.630> I've<00:03:13.630> found<00:03:13.900> that<00:03:14.080> with<00:03:14.230> a<00:03:14.290> lot<00:03:14.620> of

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:14.710 
because I've found that with a lot of

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:18.150 
because I've found that with a lot of
lower<00:03:14.920> budget<00:03:15.340> guitars<00:03:16.740> there<00:03:17.740> tends<00:03:17.980> to<00:03:18.100> be

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
lower budget guitars there tends to be

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.850 
lower budget guitars there tends to be
an<00:03:18.370> issue<00:03:18.520> of<00:03:19.020> when<00:03:20.020> they<00:03:20.140> bolt<00:03:20.380> on<00:03:20.560> the<00:03:20.650> neck

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
an issue of when they bolt on the neck

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:22.830 
an issue of when they bolt on the neck
sometimes<00:03:21.580> the<00:03:21.970> angles<00:03:22.270> are<00:03:22.390> bit<00:03:22.540> too<00:03:22.690> much

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:22.840 
sometimes the angles are bit too much

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:24.720 
sometimes the angles are bit too much
that<00:03:23.050> way<00:03:23.230> so<00:03:23.890> it<00:03:23.980> comes<00:03:24.160> away<00:03:24.430> from<00:03:24.459> the<00:03:24.640> body

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.730 
that way so it comes away from the body

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.510 
that way so it comes away from the body
a<00:03:24.970> bit<00:03:25.150> too<00:03:25.360> much<00:03:25.540> and<00:03:25.870> I<00:03:26.080> find<00:03:26.410> that<00:03:26.500> that<00:03:26.800> that

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:27.520 
a bit too much and I find that that that

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.130 
a bit too much and I find that that that
affects<00:03:27.940> the<00:03:28.090> string<00:03:28.330> quite<00:03:28.540> quite<00:03:28.840> a<00:03:28.870> lot

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.140 
affects the string quite quite a lot

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.080 
affects the string quite quite a lot
when<00:03:29.380> it<00:03:29.500> comes<00:03:29.709> to<00:03:29.830> the<00:03:29.920> higher<00:03:30.100> frets<00:03:30.400> no<00:03:31.060> I

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
when it comes to the higher frets no I

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.350 
when it comes to the higher frets no I
don't<00:03:31.360> personally<00:03:31.540> like<00:03:31.810> that<00:03:33.150> that's<00:03:34.150> what

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 
don't personally like that that's what

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.270 
don't personally like that that's what
I'm<00:03:34.450> going<00:03:34.630> to<00:03:34.720> do<00:03:34.870> today<00:03:35.050> I'm<00:03:35.800> going<00:03:35.980> to<00:03:36.100> shoot

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
I'm going to do today I'm going to shoot

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:38.520 
I'm going to do today I'm going to shoot
my<00:03:36.400> neck<00:03:36.580> to<00:03:36.790> try<00:03:37.060> and<00:03:37.209> balance<00:03:38.080> out<00:03:38.500> that

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
my neck to try and balance out that

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.310 
my neck to try and balance out that
angle<00:03:39.010> a<00:03:39.100> bit<00:03:39.280> more<00:03:39.490> and<00:03:39.700> and<00:03:40.480> dip<00:03:40.959> it<00:03:41.110> down<00:03:41.290> a

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.320 
angle a bit more and and dip it down a

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:41.760 
angle a bit more and and dip it down a
bit

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:41.770 
bit

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:44.910 
bit
there<00:03:42.700> for<00:03:42.910> the<00:03:43.000> bridges<00:03:43.420> so<00:03:44.020> I<00:03:44.050> decide<00:03:44.410> on<00:03:44.830> the

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
there for the bridges so I decide on the

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.810 
there for the bridges so I decide on the
bridge<00:03:45.130> won't<00:03:45.910> have<00:03:46.150> to<00:03:46.420> be<00:03:47.350> as<00:03:47.530> a<00:03:47.560> lot<00:03:47.830> to<00:03:48.640> sort

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:48.820 
bridge won't have to be as a lot to sort

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.910 
bridge won't have to be as a lot to sort
out<00:03:48.970> the<00:03:49.060> action<00:03:49.330> on<00:03:49.450> one<00:03:49.630> and<00:03:49.870> it<00:03:50.260> also<00:03:50.440> helps

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
out the action on one and it also helps

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.240 
out the action on one and it also helps
with<00:03:51.120> equal<00:03:52.120> amount<00:03:52.450> the<00:03:52.660> string<00:03:52.959> height<00:03:53.250> but

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
with equal amount the string height but

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.790 
with equal amount the string height but
gradually<00:03:54.670> increases<00:03:55.390> so<00:03:56.080> it's<00:03:56.290> less

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:56.800 
gradually increases so it's less

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:00.479 
gradually increases so it's less
exaggerated<00:03:57.430> which<00:03:58.090> is<00:03:58.269> what<00:03:58.420> I<00:03:58.450> want<00:03:58.950> now<00:03:59.950> the

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:00.489 
exaggerated which is what I want now the

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:03.180 
exaggerated which is what I want now the
way<00:04:00.940> to<00:04:00.970> do<00:04:01.180> this<00:04:01.360> is<00:04:01.660> sell<00:04:02.590> for<00:04:02.739> old<00:04:02.920> strings

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
way to do this is sell for old strings

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:04.470 
way to do this is sell for old strings
on<00:04:03.310> this<00:04:03.430> at<00:04:03.550> the<00:04:03.610> moment<00:04:03.970> I<00:04:04.060> would<00:04:04.330> always

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
on this at the moment I would always

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:06.150 
on this at the moment I would always
recommend<00:04:04.690> putting<00:04:05.290> new<00:04:05.440> strings<00:04:05.739> on<00:04:05.860> after

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
recommend putting new strings on after

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.759 
recommend putting new strings on after
you<00:04:06.250> do<00:04:06.340> anything<00:04:07.200> serious<00:04:08.200> to<00:04:08.350> your<00:04:08.470> guitar

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:08.769 
you do anything serious to your guitar

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:11.310 
you do anything serious to your guitar
just<00:04:09.700> so<00:04:09.820> then<00:04:09.970> you<00:04:10.090> have<00:04:10.209> a<00:04:10.239> good<00:04:10.480> valid<00:04:10.840> test

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:11.320 
just so then you have a good valid test

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.400 
just so then you have a good valid test
run<00:04:11.620> so<00:04:12.390> now<00:04:13.390> I'm<00:04:13.540> going<00:04:13.690> to<00:04:13.750> loosen<00:04:14.050> all<00:04:14.230> these

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
run so now I'm going to loosen all these

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.759 
run so now I'm going to loosen all these
strings<00:04:14.650> very<00:04:15.370> much<00:04:15.580> so<00:04:16.230> you<00:04:17.230> can<00:04:17.440> take<00:04:17.680> them

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:17.769 
strings very much so you can take them

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:20.009 
strings very much so you can take them
off<00:04:17.950> but<00:04:18.609> I'm<00:04:18.790> gonna<00:04:18.970> just<00:04:19.330> keep<00:04:19.480> them<00:04:19.660> on<00:04:19.810> so

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
off but I'm gonna just keep them on so

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.409 
off but I'm gonna just keep them on so
then<00:04:20.169> I<00:04:20.260> can<00:04:20.410> quickly<00:04:21.090> trim<00:04:22.090> them<00:04:22.240> off<00:04:22.270> again

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:22.419 
then I can quickly trim them off again

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:24.540 
then I can quickly trim them off again
to<00:04:22.780> see<00:04:22.990> to<00:04:23.320> see<00:04:23.500> how<00:04:23.710> it<00:04:23.830> is<00:04:23.950> like<00:04:23.980> he'll<00:04:24.370> play

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
to see to see how it is like he'll play

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:27.690 
to see to see how it is like he'll play

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700 
ball is now are the main tools you're

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:30.870 
ball is now are the main tools you're
going<00:04:27.729> to<00:04:27.910> need<00:04:27.970> to<00:04:29.040> self<00:04:30.040> C<00:04:30.220> remove<00:04:30.550> the<00:04:30.700> neck

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.630 
going to need to self C remove the neck
and<00:04:31.060> putting<00:04:31.240> of<00:04:31.450> shim<00:04:31.660> I<00:04:32.500> recommend<00:04:33.370> if

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:33.640 
and putting of shim I recommend if

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.250 
and putting of shim I recommend if
you're<00:04:33.790> doing<00:04:33.910> it<00:04:34.030> the<00:04:34.120> way<00:04:34.210> I<00:04:34.240> am<00:04:34.510> by<00:04:34.990> using

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.260 
you're doing it the way I am by using

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:36.120 
you're doing it the way I am by using
the<00:04:35.500> old<00:04:35.650> strings

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 
the old strings

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:37.860 
the old strings
I'd<00:04:36.729> recommend<00:04:37.090> obviously<00:04:37.479> having<00:04:37.630> a<00:04:37.660> string

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
I'd recommend obviously having a string

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.330 
I'd recommend obviously having a string
winder<00:04:38.020> cuz<00:04:38.260> it<00:04:38.350> just<00:04:38.380> decreases<00:04:38.650> the<00:04:39.100> time

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:39.340 
winder cuz it just decreases the time

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.450 
winder cuz it just decreases the time
very<00:04:40.210> much<00:04:40.360> so<00:04:40.600> I<00:04:40.840> would<00:04:41.500> also<00:04:41.650> have<00:04:41.890> a<00:04:42.130> proper

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:42.460 
very much so I would also have a proper

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:44.219 
very much so I would also have a proper
screwdriver<00:04:43.060> don't<00:04:43.450> use<00:04:43.600> a<00:04:43.630> stupid<00:04:44.050> little

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:44.229 
screwdriver don't use a stupid little

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:46.560 
screwdriver don't use a stupid little
Denny<00:04:44.410> thing<00:04:44.740> where<00:04:44.979> you're<00:04:45.100> gonna<00:04:45.220> ruin<00:04:45.570> the

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:46.570 
Denny thing where you're gonna ruin the

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.770 
Denny thing where you're gonna ruin the
fret<00:04:46.780> on<00:04:46.930> that<00:04:47.080> suppose<00:04:47.350> you<00:04:47.650> want<00:04:48.430> a<00:04:48.520> nice<00:04:48.780> big

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
fret on that suppose you want a nice big

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.820 
fret on that suppose you want a nice big
screwdriver<00:04:51.840> just<00:04:52.840> to<00:04:53.020> make<00:04:53.229> sure<00:04:53.260> that<00:04:53.650> it

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:53.830 
screwdriver just to make sure that it

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:55.650 
screwdriver just to make sure that it
grips<00:04:54.010> them<00:04:54.250> well<00:04:54.460> and<00:04:54.760> it's<00:04:55.120> going<00:04:55.270> to<00:04:55.330> do<00:04:55.539> the

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:55.660 
grips them well and it's going to do the

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.120 
grips them well and it's going to do the
job<00:04:55.870> right

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.130 
job right

00:04:57.130 --> 00:04:58.920

and then also you're going to want to

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.350 
and then also you're going to want to
share<00:04:59.110> now<00:04:59.800> as<00:05:00.130> I<00:05:00.220> said<00:05:00.370> before<00:05:00.550> you<00:05:01.150> can<00:05:01.180> use

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 
share now as I said before you can use

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:04.050

multiple<00:05:01.660> materials<00:05:02.760> and<00:05:03.760> I<00:05:03.880> was

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.060 
multiple materials and I was

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:05.850 
multiple materials and I was
contemplating<00:05:04.690> using<00:05:04.930> my<00:05:05.050> old<00:05:05.170> silly<00:05:05.530> Oyster

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:05.860 
contemplating using my old silly Oyster

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:11.520 
contemplating using my old silly Oyster
card<00:05:08.010> but<00:05:09.010> after<00:05:09.460> thinking<00:05:09.670> about<00:05:09.820> it<00:05:10.000> I'm<00:05:10.900> not

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:11.530 
card but after thinking about it I'm not

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:13.680 
card but after thinking about it I'm not
too<00:05:11.680> fond<00:05:11.920> on<00:05:12.040> using<00:05:12.340> plastic<00:05:12.760> really<00:05:13.270> because

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:13.690 
too fond on using plastic really because

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:16.590 
too fond on using plastic really because
I<00:05:14.940> don't<00:05:15.940> know<00:05:16.000> when<00:05:16.180> it's<00:05:16.360> when<00:05:16.570> it's

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:16.600 
I don't know when it's when it's

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:19.200 
I don't know when it's when it's
squashed<00:05:17.020> with<00:05:17.410> plastic<00:05:17.800> even<00:05:18.100> both<00:05:18.220> solid<00:05:18.640> it

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:19.210 
squashed with plastic even both solid it

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:21.180 
squashed with plastic even both solid it
doesn't<00:05:19.540> seem<00:05:19.720> to<00:05:19.930> compress<00:05:20.740> as<00:05:20.890> well<00:05:21.040> and

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:21.190 
doesn't seem to compress as well and

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:22.500 
doesn't seem to compress as well and
there<00:05:21.310> always<00:05:21.460> tends<00:05:21.760> to<00:05:21.880> be<00:05:22.000> little<00:05:22.300> gaps

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:22.510 
there always tends to be little gaps

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:25.380 
there always tends to be little gaps
here<00:05:23.350> and<00:05:23.500> there<00:05:23.650> and<00:05:23.890> I<00:05:24.250> don't<00:05:24.700> like<00:05:24.970> the<00:05:25.090> idea

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:25.390 
here and there and I don't like the idea

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:28.530 
here and there and I don't like the idea
of<00:05:25.420> that<00:05:26.010> not<00:05:27.010> being<00:05:27.280> a<00:05:27.400> not<00:05:27.880> being<00:05:28.060> a<00:05:28.180> solid

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:28.540 
of that not being a not being a solid

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:30.480 
of that not being a not being a solid

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:33.420 
structure for the net to be piled on top
of<00:05:30.870> purely<00:05:31.870> to<00:05:32.050> do<00:05:32.200> with<00:05:32.380> the<00:05:32.530> sonic<00:05:33.070> transfer

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:33.430 
of purely to do with the sonic transfer

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.200 
of purely to do with the sonic transfer
thing<00:05:33.670> and<00:05:33.820> stuff<00:05:34.030> so<00:05:34.960> I'm<00:05:35.080> gonna<00:05:35.260> use<00:05:35.470> some

thing and stuff so I'm gonna use some
quite<00:05:37.210> grainy<00:05:37.480> sandpaper<00:05:38.140> because<00:05:38.710> I<00:05:38.920> feel

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:39.190 
quite grainy sandpaper because I feel

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:41.070 
quite grainy sandpaper because I feel
good<00:05:39.340> that<00:05:39.400> compresses<00:05:39.880> quite<00:05:40.210> well<00:05:40.450> and<00:05:40.840> I

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:41.080 
good that compresses quite well and I

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:42.210 
good that compresses quite well and I
know<00:05:41.140> it's<00:05:41.350> going<00:05:41.470> to<00:05:41.560> grip<00:05:41.770> and<00:05:41.920> it's<00:05:42.070> never

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:42.220 
know it's going to grip and it's never

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:44.940 
know it's going to grip and it's never
gonna<00:05:42.400> slip<00:05:42.640> out<00:05:43.320> so<00:05:44.320> I've<00:05:44.560> got<00:05:44.710> my<00:05:44.800> sound

there you might want to be careful

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:23.920 
there you might want to be careful
because<00:07:22.190> you<00:07:22.370> don't<00:07:22.490> want<00:07:22.760> to<00:07:23.000> end<00:07:23.150> up<00:07:23.270> putting

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:23.930 
because you don't want to end up putting

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:25.810 
because you don't want to end up putting
pressure<00:07:24.350> on<00:07:24.530> it<00:07:24.590> so<00:07:24.860> then<00:07:25.340> that<00:07:25.490> goes<00:07:25.640> that

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:25.820 
pressure on it so then that goes that

00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:27.220 
pressure on it so then that goes that
way<00:07:25.940> because<00:07:26.090> I<00:07:26.210> could<00:07:26.390> really<00:07:26.570> damage<00:07:26.810> one<00:07:27.200> of

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:27.230 
way because I could really damage one of

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:29.650 
way because I could really damage one of
the<00:07:27.350> screw<00:07:27.560> holes<00:07:27.800> into<00:07:28.040> the<00:07:28.280> neck<00:07:28.460> itself<00:07:28.760> so

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:29.660 
the screw holes into the neck itself so

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:32.980 
the screw holes into the neck itself so
just<00:07:29.840> be<00:07:29.930> quite<00:07:30.169> general<00:07:30.620> have<00:07:30.770> it<00:07:30.890> level<00:07:31.990> but

00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:32.990 
just be quite general have it level but

00:07:32.990 --> 00:07:34.870 
just be quite general have it level but
on<00:07:33.140> like<00:07:33.260> a<00:07:33.320> flat<00:07:33.620> space<00:07:33.890> so<00:07:34.280> I'm<00:07:34.400> using<00:07:34.580> both

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:34.880 
on like a flat space so I'm using both

00:07:34.880 --> 00:07:39.460 
on like a flat space so I'm using both
of<00:07:35.180> my<00:07:35.540> legs<00:07:35.660> because<00:07:36.169> it's<00:07:36.410> quite<00:07:36.590> even
