some<00:00:46.559> things<00:00:46.829> to<00:00:46.950> say<00:00:47.600> first<00:00:48.600> of<00:00:48.719> all<00:00:48.870> as

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260

disabled people I think everyone wants

to be treated as normal as possible and

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.260 
to be treated as normal as possible and
I<00:00:55.079> think<00:00:55.379> that's<00:00:55.559> how<00:00:55.710> it<00:00:55.739> should<00:00:55.890> be<00:00:56.340> but<00:00:57.090> what

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
I think that's how it should be but what

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.569 
I think that's how it should be but what
we<00:00:57.390> cannot<00:00:57.660> do<00:00:57.899> is<00:00:57.930> disabled<00:00:58.530> people<00:00:58.920> is<00:00:59.129> get

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
we cannot do is disabled people is get

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.700 
we cannot do is disabled people is get
upset<00:01:00.000> when<00:01:00.480> we're<00:01:00.690> treated<00:01:01.079> like<00:01:01.260> everyone

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
upset when we're treated like everyone

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.729

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
else and it doesn't work out otherwise

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.560
