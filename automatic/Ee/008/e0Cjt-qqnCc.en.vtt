 given the step even big club a team that 

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:07.909
 and is that the former champion 

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:10.159
 this loose in the rest of 

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:15.699
 there's a lot for your unit and if you only have one team that's that magnitude 

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:19.029
 say that the most things did well or the is still doing well 

00:03:19.029 --> 00:03:21.729

 I have good that they played here with us when we played at second base 

00:03:30.839 --> 00:03:31.889
 and that already after 

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:34.949
 they followed him and with them the stage 

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:38.739
 and if it is not with a neighbor with a

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.809
 good people we get together very often for example football 

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:47.369

00:03:47.369 --> 00:03:51.059
 great people with the lucense to Las Vegas in December

 this very good 

00:03:58.059 --> 00:04:00.419
 I think 

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:03.579
 we are in a 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:05.519
 of transformation that 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:08.219
 It's costing us a little but 

00:04:08.219 --> 00:04:12.299
 I believe that there are working as we do every day when the 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:15.299
 Saturday to return the positive results do not 

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:18.489
 if the level is different 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:20.309
 obviously 

00:04:20.309 --> 00:04:22.419
 requirement also changes 

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:25.740
 it is not that it is greater or lesser but it changes because 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:30.219
 because the boys always bring much more desire and you take correlones that he 

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:33.110
 that a first division team 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.949
 it is more orderly and more 

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:38.960
 stronger more seasoned but 

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:43.290
 river is good I say are all ju teams with players that 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:45.569
 for example forecast and 

00:04:45.569 --> 00:04:48.889
 michel of torment the oldest teams or three players 

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:52.810

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:58.350

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:00.430

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.069
 precisely that they acquire Peru 

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:07.839

 with my buddies and quiet 

00:05:13.219 --> 00:05:16.219
 very well I think it's because it's an idea 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:19.960
 very good for you we for the coaches that 

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:24.479
 they give us this opportunity for our people to know us more as we are not 

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:28.490
 these same points on the court he sees 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:31.490
 concentration but rapier 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.289
 few more more intimate private 

00:05:36.289 --> 00:05:39.710
 and it's also important that people 

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:41.370
 that follows us then 

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:43.249
 know us if 

00:05:43.249 --> 00:05:46.669
 as we really are and not always behind an evil or not 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:52.389
 cooper if still chasing the ball oo you know 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.900
 something more intimate 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:56.680
