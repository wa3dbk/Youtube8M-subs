00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:53.120
 Hello 

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:58.039
 continues more precisely experience and today we 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:01:00.479
 in the sharpening was kizlyarsky knife baikal 2 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:02.729
 photos at the beginning of the video most likely 

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:06.899
 see how it was not jagged 

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:11.789
 after a test crash with 

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:12.659
 with its thicker fellow that is with 

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:16.039
 another knife 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:19.310
 as usual i try the knife cover well 

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:24.509
 I had to grind 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:28.229
 almost two millimeters of edge again 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:30.770
 to form a cutting edge she 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.280
 turned out to be wider but basically a knife for 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:37.159
 hard work 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:44.729
 night knife durable hard hard 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:49.909
 57 hrc probably in him so look there 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:53.700
 I really liked the handle rubber 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:56.780
 such a straight is very catchy I do not know how 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:00.030
 in the cold if she is not strong 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:03.179
 in a warm room just a pancake in hand 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:06.240
 sitting very comfortable even though 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:07.469
 my fingers are now clamped 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:13.700
 bends the end and 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:17.270
 leg pooh knife comfort just very 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:21.790
 great emphasis no true but 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.790
 it will not be very easy to slip your hand 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:29.930
 at 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:34.730
 he is under a big hand the stock is all done 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:38.060
 how would such a pen Slavic Slavic 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.200
 brush is not here Japanese is minimalism 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.230
 and miniatures 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:45.140
 give a very clear tubular rush 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:48.050
 feel like you turn it here 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:53.030
 such a profile under the little finger such 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:57.230
 dry good very comfortable knife in hand 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:03:01.870
 I immediately realized that here Iâ€™ve got a pen 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:01.870
 do u like lisa so aggressive 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:14.700
 lozenge here on the tip here too 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:16.019
 a little bit sharpened but filmed for . hitting 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:21.090
 to Bogdan 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:23.599
 emphasis of course in general, we all look at 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.599
 sharpening 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:29.360
 so surplus baikal 2 

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:46.790
 and traditionally my dirty fingers and 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:46.790
 hair so strictly on the night of us one more time 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
 cuckoo 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:05.860
 such a little along the skin such was 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:05.860
 services 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:52.550
 the cutting edge is not exactly a mirror 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:54.600
 polished because the knife is not 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:05:04.790
 exemplary no matter how 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:04.790
 meaning working knife on working sharpness
