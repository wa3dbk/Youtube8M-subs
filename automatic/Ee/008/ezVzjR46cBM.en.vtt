00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:13.629
 hello good today we are here a 

00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:15.610
 new video droid in this video will 

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:18.120
 to teach two very good applications 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:21.900
 for learning to play the piano 

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:25.620
 the options to use are called already 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.420
 no more than and hd pianist were worth the 

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:30.950
 two in the google play the version of 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:34.680
 test and another paid version you are already 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:37.050
 banished with the ideal touch 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.380
 let 's go let's start with understand 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.380
 the you 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.740
 this application is very good through 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.950
 the one I think seems to me at least 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:50.470
 simpler than the piano hd but the 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.840
 of the piano if you have other songs and more 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:54.970
 variety of songs regarding this 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.860
 for example ok we are this is the 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:59.230
 application ok we give you start the 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:04.690
 game and here we have all the songs 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:08.710
 we can learn to play we're going to 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:11.200
 give it to the fort propeller and asks us 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:15.250
 the versions that we can only listen to 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:18.010
 the apprentice beginner and expert well 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:21.210
 how to listen we will listen to you and we 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.210
 start playing him 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.310
 OK 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:30.590
 and if not then we can try it ourselves 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:34.990
 let's go out 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.990
 let's go apprentice let's see 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.070
 Y 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.560
 You see it's very easy and it's very entertaining 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.780
 the truth 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.780
 I have a lot of playing this 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.940
 to 

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:17.290
 I prefer good between January is much longer 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:20.020
 You see, it's very easy to learn good 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:22.390
 easy in quotes but it's very 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.459
 entertaining socially and so we can 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.990
 try any application that 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:29.060
 we want 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:32.830
 let's give this wonder for example 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.830
 there was not a kiss touching 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:49.950
 ah 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.950
 You see it is very easy so you know 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:56.000
 is called 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:57.080
 watching this is the full version too 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.910
 there is another version to which is that of 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:02.060
 try what has less songs and 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.950
 that we go with the following application in 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.400
 the next application is called piano 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.400
 hd 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:14.550
 this application has the advantage that 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:16.590
 you can put yourself twice as two things 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:19.860
 you can keep playing here and here 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:23.340
 It's worth it right here I have up 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:27.450
 selected we will be I do not know if not 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:29.220
 let's go see and load and here under 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.180
 also in skin because it was the 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.230
 guitar 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:37.780
 and here we can also choose the song 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:40.680
 we are here but let's see here that it puts 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:43.079
 are we select that 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:47.209
 and here we have you see more variety than 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:51.709
 her and so I chose for one of the 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:51.709
 rights and extra 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:09.510
 for me this application 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:12.520
 it seemed to me 

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:19.600
 it's not like the Turkish march 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:21.040
 I'm very bad at playing the piano and that's 78 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:25.740
 Sometimes I hope you like it you know 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:25.740
 piano master and you're asking for hd 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:32.950
 and you already know how to subscribe in the 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:36.720
 reality and that does not cost anything and then that 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:36.720
 we have in the next video then
