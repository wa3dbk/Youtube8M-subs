00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:08.359
 the 1st 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:20.820
 this car is my one 1964 fusca emc 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.560
 been with me for about 67 years 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.460
 this one on the side is a new model 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.960
 just released in 2013 and left 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.949
 to be called the cry to return to 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.289
 call fusca 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.820
 I'm going to take a walk in this from here to 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.620
 make a comparison of which are the 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.620
 differences from the old to the new 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:50.800
 friend in botton 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:53.949
 Do not need a key, I do not need anything. 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:57.190
 the first difference since my car 

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:59.620
 it has the four-speed gearbox e 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.480
 has clutch and I know I have the gear 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.250
 automatic gearbox does not 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.740
 I need a clutch I do not know if who 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.119
 think there is no automatic car male 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.060
 there is no march 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:14.979
 then let's take a little walk strip en 

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:16.540
 was on the drive was out of hand in a lot of 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:21.190
 button here that I have no idea of 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:23.229
 Why does the steering work? 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.250
 My car has no direction. 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:26.649
 hydraulic 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.720
 My car has a thousand and three hundred engine. 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:30.759
 An engine of this kind should be 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.020
 fully automatic injection 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:33.789
 electronics 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.229
 Actually, I 'm the driver of 

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:38.470
 first trip had never directed 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:42.460
 this car it has solar roof thing that 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:44.930
 mine has not I imagine that here opens 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:48.450
 sure april 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:51.630
 the dials are all digital in my 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:54.770
 I have nothing digital is because he is a 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:57.750
 car much softer than mine 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.760
 theoretically easier to drive but the 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.560
 design is similar on the outside with 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:10.770
 much more settled than as 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:13.200
 we turn the radio on and it's very 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.330
 different when you do not have 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.640
 car because his left foot he gets 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.350
 underneath completely useless, right? 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.240
 You do not have to change the gear the car. 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.100
 accelerates according to how much you tread 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:27.000
 with right when you will create too 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:28.800
 brake right and then you have to 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.410
 used that was not left there 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:34.050
 I want to have a lot of things, it becomes useless. 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.790
 This new fusca is everything round 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.440
 I think he's a bit more muscular 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.450
 which united itaÃº which is a category 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.350
 tour of the old wrist that I think 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:42.780
 what is a car 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:47.460
 despite being friendly a car plus the 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:49.709
 And this one here is too, but I still 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:53.550
 I think it's more like punishing the myth of 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:55.290
 the same old noggin difference 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:58.920
 from one car to another is almost 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.530
 40 years is my 1984 car and if here he 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.780
 was released this year but is a model 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:05.459
 2013, then there are 39 years of difference 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:09.590
 for each other 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:11.510
 I think it's a reference one 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.150
 the measure of how a car beats it 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:18.349
 now is being relaunched now with 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:19.940
 name is volks lag and it's a car 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:21.920
 to boot a smile on people 

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.840
 future like a lot of fuzz where I 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.959
 step on the street with I think not only by 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.790
 they are pink but simple and look for the 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:31.069
 people smile that I have a bad 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.180
 nostalgic relationship to your car for the 

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:34.940
 south 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:37.430
 I would not trade mine for this car. 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.410
 Because I grew up here has a price and the 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:42.500
 My price is not priceless. I have one. 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:44.260
 Sentimental value has a car is a 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:47.540
 collector who is virtually original 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:50.140
 but I would buy the 1 of this to have as 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:53.000
 the second second car to excite 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.920
 It's easy, it's very cute, it's very 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.260
 It 's very easy to drive. 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:04:00.970
 driving this car here is practically 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:04.099
 zero kilometer is marking 190 is here 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:07.720
 miles and mine obviously 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:11.890
 has 27 thousand kilometers rolled from 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.890
 1984 argued for sale 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.859
 I finished doing the test drive with a 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:23.300
 new and cute 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:25.370
 obviously it's a much better car 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:28.060
 comfortable an easier car to 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:31.250
 driving has light power steering 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:33.979
 but he does not have maggi that has a car 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:36.169
 a real classic then 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:38.120
 As I said before, I did not look for my 

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:41.270
 car for this but I would have easily 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:45.220
 a second car discount and now it will 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:45.220
 stay to my ne people kiss, bye
