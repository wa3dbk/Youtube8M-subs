00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:29.550 
there's no purpose so I'll just wait you
know<00:05:26.860> whatever<00:05:27.100> away<00:05:27.670> two<00:05:27.730> weeks<00:05:27.910> and<00:05:28.560> I'm

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:29.560 
know whatever away two weeks and I'm

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.740 
know whatever away two weeks and I'm
pretty<00:05:29.830> sure<00:05:29.920> they<00:05:30.190> got<00:05:30.400> a<00:05:30.640> few<00:05:30.970> people<00:05:31.300> to

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:31.750 
pretty sure they got a few people to

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:34.140 
pretty sure they got a few people to
break<00:05:31.990> and<00:05:32.290> actually<00:05:32.890> buy<00:05:33.100> the<00:05:33.160> xbox<00:05:33.580> one<00:05:34.000> and

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:34.150 
break and actually buy the xbox one and

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:36.660 
break and actually buy the xbox one and
then<00:05:35.110> I<00:05:35.140> guess<00:05:35.530> maybe<00:05:35.860> they<00:05:36.160> had<00:05:36.340> enough

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:36.670 
then I guess maybe they had enough

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:38.670 
then I guess maybe they had enough
people<00:05:37.030> do<00:05:37.210> that<00:05:37.390> to<00:05:37.660> where<00:05:37.840> they<00:05:38.020> decided<00:05:38.560> to

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:38.680 
people do that to where they decided to

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.590 
people do that to where they decided to
hold<00:05:38.860> it<00:05:39.010> back<00:05:39.130> again<00:05:39.550> until<00:05:40.120> the<00:05:40.240> April<00:05:40.510> the

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:40.600 
hold it back again until the April the

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.770 
hold it back again until the April the
eighth<00:05:40.750> and<00:05:41.700> hopefully<00:05:42.700> now<00:05:42.850> we<00:05:42.910> will<00:05:43.240> get<00:05:43.480> the

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:43.780 
eighth and hopefully now we will get the

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:47.460 
eighth and hopefully now we will get the
