welcome<00:00:00.390> back<00:00:00.539> to<00:00:00.690> educator<00:00:01.079> calm<00:00:01.500> this<00:00:02.159> is<00:00:02.220> a

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399 
welcome back to educator calm this is a

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.769 
welcome back to educator calm this is a
lesson<00:00:02.639> on<00:00:02.850> the<00:00:02.970> axial<00:00:03.449> skeleton<00:00:05.420> the<00:00:06.420> axial

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
lesson on the axial skeleton the axial

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:08.270 
lesson on the axial skeleton the axial
skeleton<00:00:07.350> is<00:00:07.620> the<00:00:07.770> part<00:00:07.950> of<00:00:07.980> the<00:00:08.069> skeleton

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
skeleton is the part of the skeleton

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.320 
skeleton is the part of the skeleton
that's<00:00:08.700> along<00:00:09.120> your<00:00:09.330> axis<00:00:09.900> so<00:00:10.559> 8x<00:00:11.099> is<00:00:11.340> just

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
that's along your axis so 8x is just

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.089 
that's along your axis so 8x is just
like<00:00:12.420> the<00:00:12.540> axis<00:00:12.809> of<00:00:12.900> the<00:00:12.960> earth<00:00:13.019> just<00:00:13.769> down<00:00:13.950> the

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
like the axis of the earth just down the

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.000 
like the axis of the earth just down the
middle<00:00:14.929> this<00:00:15.929> is<00:00:15.990> the<00:00:16.529> middle<00:00:16.710> of<00:00:16.800> your<00:00:16.920> body

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
middle this is the middle of your body

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.760 
middle this is the middle of your body
so<00:00:17.430> every<00:00:18.150> bone<00:00:18.390> that's<00:00:18.690> in<00:00:18.869> that<00:00:18.960> section<00:00:19.289> is

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
so every bone that's in that section is

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.439 
so every bone that's in that section is
considered<00:00:20.220> part<00:00:20.430> of<00:00:20.550> it<00:00:20.640> so<00:00:21.029> of<00:00:21.180> course<00:00:21.330> that

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
considered part of it so of course that

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.269 
considered part of it so of course that
includes<00:00:21.869> the<00:00:22.050> skull<00:00:22.410> all<00:00:22.740> the<00:00:23.070> bones

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
includes the skull all the bones

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.570 
includes the skull all the bones
involved<00:00:23.820> with<00:00:23.910> that<00:00:24.090> the<00:00:24.660> hyoid<00:00:24.869> bone<00:00:25.490> one<00:00:26.490> of

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
involved with that the hyoid bone one of

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:27.830 
involved with that the hyoid bone one of
the<00:00:26.640> ones<00:00:26.789> most<00:00:26.970> people<00:00:27.300> don't<00:00:27.390> know<00:00:27.689> about

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
the ones most people don't know about

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.290 
the ones most people don't know about
right<00:00:28.170> here<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:29.310> vertebral<00:00:29.670> column<00:00:29.699> also

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
right here the vertebral column also

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.659

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
gonna start with the skull at the most

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.720 
gonna start with the skull at the most
superior<00:00:38.910> portion<00:00:39.360> of<00:00:39.660> the<00:00:39.960> axial<00:00:40.590> skeleton

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 
superior portion of the axial skeleton

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.459 
superior portion of the axial skeleton
the<00:00:41.730> cranium<00:00:42.239> is<00:00:42.600> all<00:00:43.500> of<00:00:44.280> this<00:00:44.610> business

00:00:45.459 --> 00:00:45.469 
the cranium is all of this business

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:49.639 
the cranium is all of this business
right<00:00:46.469> in<00:00:46.500> here<00:00:46.980> and<00:00:48.140> that<00:00:49.140> includes<00:00:49.500> the

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
right in here and that includes the

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.200 
right in here and that includes the
frontal<00:00:50.039> bone<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.399> parietal<00:00:50.820> bones<00:00:51.000> the

temporal bones the occipital bone you
can<00:00:53.610> see<00:00:53.969> we<00:00:54.120> have<00:00:54.270> a<00:00:54.300> sagittal<00:00:54.930> cross-section

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
can see we have a sagittal cross-section

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.470 
can see we have a sagittal cross-section
straight<00:00:56.010> through<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.280> skull<00:00:56.550> here<00:00:56.879> there

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
straight through the skull here there

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.270 
straight through the skull here there
are<00:00:57.629> two<00:00:57.809> other<00:00:58.020> bones<00:00:58.260> that<00:00:58.559> are<00:00:58.770> associate

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
are two other bones that are associate

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.459 
are two other bones that are associate
with<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.430> cranium<00:00:59.670> they're<00:01:00.149> forgotten<00:01:00.809> often

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
with the cranium they're forgotten often

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:09.580 
with the cranium they're forgotten often
that's<00:01:02.399> the<00:01:02.609> sphenoid<00:01:05.270> which<00:01:06.270> is<00:01:06.540> right<00:01:07.760> here

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
that's the sphenoid which is right here

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:16.760 
that's the sphenoid which is right here
and<00:01:11.180> the<00:01:12.180> ethmoid<00:01:12.780> bone<00:01:15.080> which<00:01:16.080> makes<00:01:16.380> up<00:01:16.619> a

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
and the ethmoid bone which makes up a

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.130 
and the ethmoid bone which makes up a
lot<00:01:17.220> of<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.880> nasal<00:01:18.090> cavity<00:01:18.530> that's<00:01:19.530> in<00:01:20.189> here

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
lot of the nasal cavity that's in here

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.929 
lot of the nasal cavity that's in here
so<00:01:22.140> they<00:01:22.320> do<00:01:22.430> articulate<00:01:23.430> with<00:01:23.610> those<00:01:23.759> other

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
so they do articulate with those other

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.450 
so they do articulate with those other
cranial<00:01:24.270> bones<00:01:24.450> they<00:01:25.020> form<00:01:25.380> at<00:01:25.500> least<00:01:25.530> a<00:01:25.979> part

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
cranial bones they form at least a part

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.330 
cranial bones they form at least a part
of<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:27.049> cranial<00:01:28.049> cavity<00:01:28.380> so<00:01:29.250> they're

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
of the cranial cavity so they're

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.590 
of the cranial cavity so they're
considered<00:01:29.700> part<00:01:29.909> of<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.030> cranium<00:01:30.210> as<00:01:30.479> well

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
considered part of the cranium as well

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.649 
considered part of the cranium as well
the<00:01:33.600> frontal<00:01:33.960> bone<00:01:34.079> right<00:01:34.470> in<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.680> front

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 
the frontal bone right in the front

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:38.120 
the frontal bone right in the front
includes<00:01:36.659> two<00:01:37.020> major<00:01:37.200> parts<00:01:37.680> I<00:01:37.890> want<00:01:38.070> to

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
includes two major parts I want to

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.830 
includes two major parts I want to
mention<00:01:38.460> the<00:01:39.270> sinuses<00:01:40.759> sinuses<00:01:41.759> are<00:01:42.060> hollow

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
mention the sinuses sinuses are hollow

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.830 
mention the sinuses sinuses are hollow
cavities<00:01:43.380> within<00:01:43.560> bone<00:01:44.149> the<00:01:45.149> two<00:01:45.390> frontal

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
cavities within bone the two frontal

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.330 
cavities within bone the two frontal
sinuses<00:01:46.350> are<00:01:47.600> approximately<00:01:49.130> here<00:01:50.130> and

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
sinuses are approximately here and

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.270 
sinuses are approximately here and
sinuses<00:01:51.180> serve<00:01:51.420> a<00:01:51.689> couple<00:01:52.079> purposes<00:01:52.590> one<00:01:53.130> of

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
sinuses serve a couple purposes one of

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.730 
sinuses serve a couple purposes one of
them<00:01:53.399> is<00:01:53.700> these<00:01:54.180> hollow<00:01:54.540> portions<00:01:55.049> within<00:01:55.500> the

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
them is these hollow portions within the

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.100 
them is these hollow portions within the
bone<00:01:55.950> make<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.820> bone<00:01:57.030> weigh<00:01:57.390> less<00:01:57.689> it<00:01:58.020> has

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
bone make the bone weigh less it has

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.219 
bone make the bone weigh less it has
slightly<00:01:58.710> less<00:01:58.829> mass<00:01:59.340> if<00:01:59.729> all<00:02:00.509> of<00:02:00.719> the<00:02:00.840> sinuses

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
slightly less mass if all of the sinuses

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.770 
slightly less mass if all of the sinuses
the<00:02:01.439> eight<00:02:01.799> cavities<00:02:02.280> in<00:02:02.909> our<00:02:03.149> skull<00:02:03.570> were

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
the eight cavities in our skull were

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.840 
the eight cavities in our skull were
filled<00:02:04.170> in<00:02:04.290> with<00:02:04.380> bone<00:02:04.649> our<00:02:04.979> skull<00:02:05.310> would<00:02:05.490> be<00:02:05.640> a

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
filled in with bone our skull would be a

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.940 
filled in with bone our skull would be a
little<00:02:06.329> bit<00:02:06.450> heavier<00:02:06.780> and<00:02:07.110> if<00:02:07.590> that<00:02:07.710> was<00:02:07.860> the

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
little bit heavier and if that was the

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.160 
little bit heavier and if that was the
case<00:02:08.069> maybe<00:02:08.369> we'd<00:02:08.640> be<00:02:08.729> used<00:02:08.910> to<00:02:09.090> it<00:02:09.209> but<00:02:09.840> having

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
case maybe we'd be used to it but having

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.370 
case maybe we'd be used to it but having
that<00:02:10.670> slightly<00:02:11.670> hollow<00:02:12.030> area<00:02:12.510> does<00:02:12.780> reduce

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
that slightly hollow area does reduce

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.460 
that slightly hollow area does reduce
way<00:02:13.560> to<00:02:13.620> the<00:02:13.770> bone<00:02:13.980> and<00:02:14.310> also<00:02:15.090> you<00:02:15.870> you<00:02:16.200> within

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
way to the bone and also you you within

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.860 
way to the bone and also you you within
those<00:02:16.590> cavities<00:02:16.940> have<00:02:17.940> mucous<00:02:18.420> membranes

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
those cavities have mucous membranes

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:21.170 
those cavities have mucous membranes
that<00:02:19.050> can<00:02:19.440> create<00:02:19.650> secretions<00:02:20.310> for<00:02:20.790> the<00:02:20.910> sake

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
that can create secretions for the sake

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.930 
that can create secretions for the sake
of<00:02:21.290> catching<00:02:22.290> bacteria<00:02:22.860> and<00:02:23.100> viruses<00:02:23.550> before

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
of catching bacteria and viruses before

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:27.500 
of catching bacteria and viruses before
they<00:02:24.120> spread<00:02:24.450> deeper<00:02:25.350> into<00:02:25.970> more<00:02:26.970> vulnerable

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
they spread deeper into more vulnerable

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.140 
they spread deeper into more vulnerable
organs<00:02:27.870> within<00:02:28.140> the<00:02:28.230> body<00:02:28.670> so<00:02:29.670> actually<00:02:29.970> some

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
organs within the body so actually some

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.060 
organs within the body so actually some
of<00:02:30.210> the<00:02:30.420> cavities<00:02:31.020> or<00:02:31.290> sinuses<00:02:31.770> that<00:02:31.950> we're

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
of the cavities or sinuses that we're

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.320 
of the cavities or sinuses that we're
going<00:02:32.160> to<00:02:32.220> talk<00:02:32.400> about<00:02:32.610> in<00:02:32.850> this<00:02:32.970> skull

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
going to talk about in this skull

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.170 
going to talk about in this skull
section<00:02:33.780> of<00:02:33.870> the<00:02:33.930> lesson<00:02:34.260> they<00:02:35.100> do<00:02:35.160> connect<00:02:35.850> to

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
section of the lesson they do connect to

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:38.270 
section of the lesson they do connect to
the<00:02:36.390> nasal<00:02:36.570> cavity<00:02:37.200> in<00:02:37.380> terms<00:02:37.800> of<00:02:37.950> producing

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
the nasal cavity in terms of producing

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.730 
the nasal cavity in terms of producing
mucus<00:02:38.700> and<00:02:39.060> helping<00:02:39.600> to<00:02:39.690> clean<00:02:39.990> out<00:02:40.170> that<00:02:40.200> area

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
mucus and helping to clean out that area

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.520 
mucus and helping to clean out that area
so<00:02:41.640> if<00:02:41.700> you<00:02:41.790> ever<00:02:41.880> get<00:02:42.090> a<00:02:42.150> headache<00:02:42.960> that<00:02:43.320> you

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
so if you ever get a headache that you

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.710 
so if you ever get a headache that you
just<00:02:43.770> feel<00:02:43.980> right<00:02:44.220> here<00:02:44.760> it<00:02:45.060> could<00:02:45.480> be<00:02:45.540> because

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
just feel right here it could be because

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.170 
just feel right here it could be because
you<00:02:45.900> have<00:02:46.020> swelling<00:02:46.500> within<00:02:47.490> the<00:02:47.670> sinuses<00:02:48.120> of

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
you have swelling within the sinuses of

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.920 
you have swelling within the sinuses of
your<00:02:48.510> frontal<00:02:48.960> bone<00:02:49.760> sutures<00:02:50.760> sutures<00:02:51.570> are

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
your frontal bone sutures sutures are

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.830 
your frontal bone sutures sutures are
those<00:02:52.410> in<00:02:52.710> movable<00:02:53.370> joints<00:02:53.970> that<00:02:54.960> connect<00:02:55.500> a

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
those in movable joints that connect a

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.630 
those in movable joints that connect a
bone<00:02:57.840> to<00:02:58.050> another<00:02:58.110> bone<00:02:58.320> so<00:02:59.310> you<00:02:59.370> do<00:02:59.610> have

00:02:59.630 --> 00:02:59.640 
bone to another bone so you do have

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.470 
bone to another bone so you do have
sutures<00:03:00.570> that<00:03:01.170> connect<00:03:01.620> the<00:03:02.250> frontal<00:03:02.640> bone<00:03:02.790> to

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
sutures that connect the frontal bone to

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.810 
sutures that connect the frontal bone to
the<00:03:03.510> parietal<00:03:04.260> bones<00:03:04.650> on<00:03:04.800> the<00:03:04.890> sides<00:03:05.130> you<00:03:05.490> have

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
the parietal bones on the sides you have

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:12.110 
the parietal bones on the sides you have
sutures<00:03:06.600> right<00:03:07.140> here<00:03:10.310> that<00:03:11.310> connect<00:03:11.760> the

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
sutures right here that connect the

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.410 
sutures right here that connect the
frontal<00:03:12.600> bone<00:03:12.750> to<00:03:13.170> the<00:03:13.440> maxilla<00:03:14.310> the<00:03:15.120> nasal

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
frontal bone to the maxilla the nasal

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.000 
frontal bone to the maxilla the nasal
bones<00:03:15.600> which<00:03:15.720> we'll<00:03:15.840> get<00:03:15.960> to<00:03:16.020> later<00:03:16.140> and<00:03:16.650> so

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
bones which we'll get to later and so

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:20.150 
bones which we'll get to later and so
part<00:03:17.280> of<00:03:17.310> the<00:03:17.400> frontal<00:03:17.760> bone<00:03:17.910> does<00:03:18.750> form<00:03:19.320> part

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
part of the frontal bone does form part

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.860 
part of the frontal bone does form part
of<00:03:20.280> the<00:03:20.340> orbit<00:03:20.520> of<00:03:20.760> the<00:03:20.820> eye<00:03:20.910> the<00:03:21.540> orbit<00:03:21.780> of<00:03:21.810> the

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
of the orbit of the eye the orbit of the

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.140 
of the orbit of the eye the orbit of the
eye<00:03:21.930> would<00:03:22.230> be<00:03:22.380> the<00:03:22.860> giant<00:03:23.400> eye<00:03:23.610> holes<00:03:23.940> that

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:24.150 
eye would be the giant eye holes that

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.530 
eye would be the giant eye holes that
you<00:03:24.210> see<00:03:24.300> in<00:03:24.600> the<00:03:24.720> skull<00:03:25.940> that's<00:03:26.940> the<00:03:27.180> frontal

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
you see in the skull that's the frontal

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.450 
you see in the skull that's the frontal
bone<00:03:30.050> next<00:03:31.050> up<00:03:31.200> the<00:03:31.380> parietal<00:03:31.890> bones<00:03:32.100> and<00:03:32.400> you

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:32.460 
bone next up the parietal bones and you

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:35.630 
bone next up the parietal bones and you
can<00:03:32.610> see<00:03:33.080> there<00:03:34.080> is<00:03:34.230> a<00:03:34.260> major<00:03:34.710> suture<00:03:35.490> right

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:35.640 
can see there is a major suture right

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.120 
can see there is a major suture right
here<00:03:36.090> this<00:03:36.810> is<00:03:36.870> just<00:03:37.200> simply<00:03:37.650> called<00:03:37.950> the

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
here this is just simply called the

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:40.460 
here this is just simply called the
sagittal<00:03:38.730> suture<00:03:38.940> I'm<00:03:39.900> not<00:03:40.080> going<00:03:40.230> to<00:03:40.320> draw

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
sagittal suture I'm not going to draw

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.260 
sagittal suture I'm not going to draw
that<00:03:40.620> the<00:03:40.740> whole<00:03:40.890> way<00:03:41.010> down<00:03:41.190> but<00:03:41.430> that

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:42.270 
that the whole way down but that

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:44.390 
that the whole way down but that
connects<00:03:43.200> the<00:03:43.350> two<00:03:43.500> parietal<00:03:43.740> bones<00:03:44.070> to<00:03:44.310> each

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
connects the two parietal bones to each

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.330 
connects the two parietal bones to each
other<00:03:44.720> you<00:03:45.720> can<00:03:45.840> see<00:03:46.020> also<00:03:46.200> there<00:03:46.560> is<00:03:46.770> a<00:03:46.800> suture

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
other you can see also there is a suture

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.220
