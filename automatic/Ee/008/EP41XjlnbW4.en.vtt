what is kind of easy to move here on the
ball<00:01:06.360> downfield<00:01:06.600> in<00:01:06.840> your<00:01:06.930> first<00:01:07.110> dry<00:01:07.350> but

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
ball downfield in your first dry but

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.190 
ball downfield in your first dry but
after<00:01:07.740> that<00:01:08.010> you<00:01:08.549> know<00:01:08.780> usually<00:01:09.780> we<00:01:09.900> tighten

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
after that you know usually we tighten

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.510 
after that you know usually we tighten
up<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.350> defense<00:01:10.710> but<00:01:10.860> unfortunately<00:01:11.340> there

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
up the defense but unfortunately there

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.950 
up the defense but unfortunately there
would<00:01:11.700> give<00:01:11.850> up<00:01:11.909> a<00:01:11.970> touchdown<00:01:12.000> a<00:01:12.420> lot<00:01:12.689> of<00:01:12.780> times

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
would give up a touchdown a lot of times

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.960 
would give up a touchdown a lot of times
we<00:01:13.140> don't<00:01:13.200> even<00:01:13.439> give<00:01:13.680> up<00:01:13.799> touchdowns<00:01:14.280> with

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
we don't even give up touchdowns with

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.370 
we don't even give up touchdowns with
this<00:01:15.119> defense<00:01:15.540> here<00:01:15.720> like<00:01:15.900> I<00:01:15.990> said<00:01:16.170> we<00:01:16.229> got<00:01:16.320> a

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
this defense here like I said we got a

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.950

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:09.550 
him there just a big mess so now it's

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:10.920
