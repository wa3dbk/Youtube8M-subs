00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:18.260 
literally thought it was a scrub like I

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.620 
literally thought it was a scrub like I
read<00:01:18.560> a<00:01:18.590> couple<00:01:18.800> of<00:01:18.980> web<00:01:19.100> pages<00:01:19.130> saying<00:01:19.910> yeah

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
but it actually turns out that you just

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.920 
but it actually turns out that you just
need<00:01:27.650> a<00:01:27.680> gently<00:01:28.040> massage<00:01:28.340> it<00:01:28.550> because<00:01:29.240> what

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
and I washed it off lift on for probably

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.499 
and I washed it off lift on for probably
10<00:02:05.990> minutes<00:02:06.320> 5<00:02:07.190> to<00:02:07.310> 10<00:02:07.490> minutes<00:02:07.610> I<00:02:07.970> would<00:02:08.030> say<00:02:08.270> I

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
10 minutes 5 to 10 minutes I would say I

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.600 
10 minutes 5 to 10 minutes I would say I
washed<00:02:09.080> it<00:02:09.200> off<00:02:09.290> and<00:02:09.470> I<00:02:09.530> could<00:02:09.590> tell<00:02:09.920> that<00:02:10.340> my

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:12.940 
washed it off and I could tell that my
face<00:02:11.030> like<00:02:11.269> it<00:02:11.510> was<00:02:11.540> it<00:02:12.110> was<00:02:12.260> a<00:02:12.290> lot<00:02:12.410> softer<00:02:12.590> I

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:12.950 
face like it was it was a lot softer I

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.890

I<00:02:15.170> noticed<00:02:15.530> red<00:02:15.680> spot<00:02:15.890> and<00:02:16.450> I<00:02:17.450> decided<00:02:18.230> okay

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
I noticed red spot and I decided okay

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.560 
I noticed red spot and I decided okay
well<00:02:18.860> I<00:02:18.890> guess<00:02:19.040> it's<00:02:19.130> not<00:02:19.280> really<00:02:19.390> working<00:02:20.390> for

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
well I guess it's not really working for

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.500 
well I guess it's not really working for
me<00:02:20.780> so<00:02:21.310> I<00:02:22.310> look<00:02:22.610> to<00:02:22.730> my<00:02:22.760> face<00:02:23.030> it<00:02:23.330> was

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
me so I look to my face it was

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.630 
me so I look to my face it was
noticeably<00:02:24.110> dryer<00:02:24.350> and<00:02:24.650> I<00:02:24.739> was<00:02:24.920> thinking<00:02:25.100> what

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
noticeably dryer and I was thinking what

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.940 
noticeably dryer and I was thinking what
am<00:02:25.730> I<00:02:25.790> going<00:02:25.910> to<00:02:26.000> do<00:02:26.150> because<00:02:26.390> I<00:02:26.840> mean<00:02:27.650> it's

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
am I going to do because I mean it's

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.500 
am I going to do because I mean it's
working<00:02:28.459> for<00:02:28.610> every<00:02:28.850> home<00:02:28.970> prize<00:02:29.209> unit

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
working for every home prize unit

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.190 
working for every home prize unit
working<00:02:29.690> for<00:02:29.989> me<00:02:30.110> and<00:02:30.550> i<00:02:31.550> realized<00:02:32.030> that<00:02:32.209> i<00:02:32.600> did

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
working for me and i realized that i did

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.890 
working for me and i realized that i did
not<00:02:33.230> moisturize<00:02:33.890> my<00:02:34.040> face<00:02:34.070> afterwards<00:02:34.840> for<00:02:35.840> a

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
not moisturize my face afterwards for a

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.340 
not moisturize my face afterwards for a
good<00:02:36.200> week

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
good week

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.230 
good week
so<00:02:39.350> I<00:02:39.380> decided<00:02:39.890> okay<00:02:40.310> well<00:02:40.670> I'm<00:02:40.819> going<00:02:41.000> to<00:02:41.090> cut

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:41.240 
so I decided okay well I'm going to cut

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.660 
so I decided okay well I'm going to cut
back<00:02:41.420> on<00:02:41.660> Oh<00:02:41.900> wash<00:02:42.770> my<00:02:43.010> face<00:02:43.130> of<00:02:43.340> baking<00:02:43.640> soda

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
back on Oh wash my face of baking soda

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.620 
back on Oh wash my face of baking soda
and<00:02:43.910> look<00:02:44.150> up<00:02:44.300> another<00:02:44.660> solution<00:02:45.200> I<00:02:46.630> decided

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
and look up another solution I decided

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.620 
and look up another solution I decided
to<00:02:47.810> look<00:02:47.840> up<00:02:48.190> some<00:02:49.190> alternative<00:02:50.150> to<00:02:50.360> baking

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
to look up some alternative to baking

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.710 
to look up some alternative to baking
soda<00:02:50.900> because<00:02:51.140> as<00:02:51.940> great<00:02:52.940> as<00:02:53.120> it<00:02:53.150> worked<00:02:53.510> I

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
soda because as great as it worked I

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.760 
soda because as great as it worked I
just<00:02:54.530> I<00:02:54.739> thought<00:02:55.160> it<00:02:55.340> wasn't<00:02:55.550> a<00:02:56.440> car<00:02:57.440> maybe<00:02:57.650> I

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:57.770 
just I thought it wasn't a car maybe I

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.400 
just I thought it wasn't a car maybe I
can<00:02:57.950> try<00:02:58.160> it<00:02:58.220> again<00:02:58.340> later<00:02:58.670> but<00:02:59.209> I<00:02:59.569> just<00:03:00.050> I'm

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
can try it again later but I just I'm

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:05.620 
can try it again later but I just I'm
not<00:03:00.470> liking<00:03:00.890> it<00:03:01.130> and<00:03:03.280> I'd<00:03:04.280> say<00:03:04.550> if<00:03:04.819> you<00:03:04.850> really

work for me I didn't really like it that

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.960 
work for me I didn't really like it that
much<00:03:21.320> a<00:03:21.860> lot<00:03:22.130> of<00:03:22.160> other<00:03:22.340> people<00:03:22.489> might<00:03:22.760> like<00:03:22.940> it

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
much a lot of other people might like it

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.509 
much a lot of other people might like it
I<00:03:23.390> mean<00:03:23.810> I<00:03:24.140> probably<00:03:24.800> will<00:03:25.040> try<00:03:25.250> it<00:03:25.310> in<00:03:25.430> the

00:03:25.509 --> 00:03:25.519 
I mean I probably will try it in the

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:29.229 
I mean I probably will try it in the
future<00:03:25.880> but<00:03:26.420> I<00:03:27.250> will<00:03:28.250> have<00:03:28.459> to<00:03:28.700> try<00:03:29.180> another

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:29.239 
future but I will have to try another

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:31.330 
future but I will have to try another
alternative<00:03:29.870> first<00:03:30.350> to<00:03:30.680> see<00:03:30.860> which<00:03:31.040> I<00:03:31.160> like

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
alternative first to see which I like

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.990 
alternative first to see which I like
better<00:03:31.519> I<00:03:31.790> heard<00:03:32.690> about<00:03:32.750> cocoa<00:03:33.319> butter<00:03:33.500> and

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:35.000 
better I heard about cocoa butter and

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.150 
better I heard about cocoa butter and
it's<00:03:35.600> the<00:03:35.930> one-hundred-percent<00:03:36.410> cocoa

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
it's the one-hundred-percent cocoa

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.040 
it's the one-hundred-percent cocoa
butter<00:03:37.340> or<00:03:37.430> not<00:03:37.580> anything<00:03:38.360> else<00:03:38.510> and<00:03:38.840> thought

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:39.050 
butter or not anything else and thought

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:43.240 
butter or not anything else and thought
it<00:03:39.200> like<00:03:39.440> no<00:03:40.040> other<00:03:40.220> adage<00:03:40.880> green<00:03:41.210> so<00:03:41.870> I<00:03:42.250> really

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
it like no other adage green so I really

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.530 
it like no other adage green so I really
want<00:03:43.400> to<00:03:43.460> try<00:03:43.610> that<00:03:43.820> I'm<00:03:44.090> hoping<00:03:44.450> my<00:03:44.810> work<00:03:46.540> so
