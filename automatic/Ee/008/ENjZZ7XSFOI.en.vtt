00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.070
 in the mid 70's the golf gti 

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:27.090
 inaugurated a new style of car a 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.750
 new category 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:33.239
 the hot hatch basically a small car 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:35.280
 light and fun with plenty of steering wheel 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:38.129
 this essence of golf gti we have not been there 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.080
 some time on mk 2 but it only came to 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.760
 version arrives officially in Brazil in 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.950
 1994 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.660
 so today we will send and we will 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.449
 to do one we did a lot and a lot 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.300
 requested by readers by viewers 

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:54.680
 mk3 buffet in a very nice color the car 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.680
 this gives new there 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:32.530
 You have some pretty cool things for 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:34.510
 example is the only goal was sold with 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:38.830
 14-wheeler two-wheeled body 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:41.620
 inch rimmed wheels the airfoil to 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:44.500
 of course that differentiated the car and 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:46.240
 something very interesting is also this 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.150
 Optical front set at night stood 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.350
 that is, these side lights give a 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.000
 very cool effect 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.240
 specifically speaking this copy 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.010
 he is a copy 93 93 94 have the banks 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.610
 covered in leather was made at the time 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:02.470
 20 years ago and really just okay with 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.110
 natural wear of the weather very well 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:06.820
 a glance at the panel is also 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.790
 cool, I always really liked the panel 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:11.650
 golf mk3 it's a little bent it's a 

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:14.830
 The panel has a very good 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:17.380
 people there notice the commands by hand a 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:20.310
 really funchal four-spoke steering wheel 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.310
 what a season 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:35.920
 under the hood we have something interesting 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:37.420
 2-liter 114 horsepower engine with 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.910
 cool technology cross flow flow 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.310
 after defining a part of the 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:46.240
 escape remembering that in Europe this 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:48.010
 engine than the 2.0 16 valves and that the r6 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:50.670
 what an incredible version you do not see 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:50.670
 officially Brazil 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:10.319
 Also today personal recording here 

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:13.560
 with the car that marked the 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.610
 adolescence, many people including 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.840
 my 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:22.519
 he is a car that practically gave 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:25.650
 origin to the expression rod hatch 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:27.420
 it was released in the 1970s and 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:33.680
 quickly became a dream come true. 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:42.090
 consumption gather three things compact lightweight 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:45.930
 fast and agile three things that can 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:48.360
 to characterize a car a hot hatch 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:51.599
 we went after an exemplary copy 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:54.390
 brand new very well maintained 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:55.560
 curiously identical to what came out in the 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.200
 four- wheeled magazine in the 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.849
 Launch this very turquoise color 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:03.690
 pretty by the way 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:06.079
 between options are few options and this 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.079
 is one of them 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:20.220
 these 11 characteristic of volkswagen 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.550
 which is very nice, very nice 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.550
 hear 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:36.540
 a very nice car to ride and has 

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:36.540
 macpherson suspension at the front 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:42.700
 henry twist on the back 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:45.180
 he's watching the curves come out with enough 

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:45.180
 naturalness 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:06.110
 gt i remember a lot in the decade 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:08.640
 90 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:10.710
 it was released it was probably 15 

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:12.660
 years and 14 to 15 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:13.950
 and I remember it's a car that I'm 

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:16.350
 in a dream of consumption 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:17.700
 even in this same subject the magazine four 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:22.530
 wheels 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:24.150
 they talk about car success 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:26.750
 is not selling per day on 

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.750
 employees 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:36.620
 really good and point also attacked the 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:39.889
 its our test very good economics these 

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:44.349
 banks with tail the sides they give a 

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:49.729
 good support that the body car enough 

00:05:44.349 --> 00:05:51.110
 nice it to drive where brakes 

00:05:49.729 --> 00:05:52.430
 disc to the four wheels 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:56.509
 we also see something interesting 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:06:02.469
 he has the headlights on her and has even 

00:05:56.509 --> 00:06:02.469
 the monkey also in that of the monkey in the one 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:10.270
 triangle is also to give her the mark 

00:06:07.219 --> 00:06:10.270
 fantastic german 

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:18.780
 and curiously a car that I wanted 

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:23.700
 driving for a long time more precisely 

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:26.980
 Since I was 15 years old, it's been a while. 

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:32.880
 you can actually find a car 

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:32.880
 that marked his adolescence very nice 

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:41.480
 the project well done in the car with 20 years 

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:43.660
 having this balance all gives a taste of 

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:43.660
 walk 

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:55.450
 and soon there will be a golf gti vr6 eu 

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:57.830
 I'm going behind the r6 behind r 32 

00:06:55.450 --> 00:07:00.169
 we'll have nice things there 

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:03.820
 in front of us then we see 

00:07:00.169 --> 00:07:03.820
 next is more theatrical
