been wanting to do it for quite awhile I
made<00:00:05.009> one<00:00:05.220> of<00:00:05.339> these<00:00:05.400> jewel<00:00:05.879> thief's<00:00:06.330> and<00:00:06.720> I

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
made one of these jewel thief's and I

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:09.310 
made one of these jewel thief's and I
mean<00:00:07.950> want<00:00:08.099> to<00:00:08.250> do<00:00:08.340> this<00:00:08.460> for<00:00:08.639> a<00:00:08.700> long<00:00:08.820> time

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:09.320 
mean want to do this for a long time

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.879

it's very interesting it's very simple
really<00:01:25.530> easy<00:01:25.860> to<00:01:26.100> do<00:01:26.310> and<00:01:26.610> then<00:01:26.759> you<00:01:26.790> can

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
really easy to do and then you can

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.969 
really easy to do and then you can
modify<00:01:27.540> and<00:01:27.900> do<00:01:28.080> things<00:01:28.350> with<00:01:28.619> it

and<00:01:30.140> Kubik<00:01:31.140> up<00:01:31.350> I<00:01:31.710> believe<00:01:32.369> it's<00:01:32.520> how<00:01:32.729> it's

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
and Kubik up I believe it's how it's

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.330 
and Kubik up I believe it's how it's
pronounced<00:01:33.450> figure<00:01:34.229> out<00:01:34.350> a<00:01:34.409> way<00:01:34.619> to<00:01:34.650> take<00:01:35.100> this

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
pronounced figure out a way to take this

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.109 
pronounced figure out a way to take this
and<00:01:35.670> turn<00:01:35.820> it<00:01:35.850> into<00:01:36.090> a<00:01:36.210> charger<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:37.710> I<00:01:38.490> decided

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
and turn it into a charger and I decided

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.359 
and turn it into a charger and I decided
to<00:01:39.240> do<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.479> same<00:01:39.659> thing<00:01:39.990> so<00:01:40.590> I<00:01:40.619> made<00:01:40.829> a<00:01:40.860> charger

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
to do the same thing so I made a charger

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.139 
to do the same thing so I made a charger
circuit<00:01:41.790> out<00:01:41.939> of<00:01:42.090> it<00:01:42.240> and<00:01:42.950> what<00:01:43.950> I<00:01:43.979> did<00:01:44.399> it's

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
circuit out of it and what I did it's

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.969 
circuit out of it and what I did it's
basically<00:01:45.540> the<00:01:45.689> same<00:01:45.869> Bedini<00:01:46.350> kind<00:01:46.740> of<00:01:46.829> I<00:01:46.920> do

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
basically the same Bedini kind of I do

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.160 
basically the same Bedini kind of I do

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
and you go into a battery or a capacitor

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.679 
and you go into a battery or a capacitor
you<00:01:53.040> take<00:01:53.280> the<00:01:53.430> negative<00:01:53.909> side<00:01:54.119> of<00:01:54.149> it<00:01:54.479> you

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
you take the negative side of it you

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.480 
you take the negative side of it you
plug<00:01:54.990> that<00:01:55.020> right<00:01:55.380> back<00:01:55.619> into<00:01:55.860> the<00:01:56.009> positive

left<00:02:11.550> in<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:11.910> LEDs<00:02:12.480> here<00:02:12.810> too

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
left in the LEDs here too

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.110 
left in the LEDs here too
to<00:02:13.110> show<00:02:13.290> you<00:02:13.350> how<00:02:13.440> this<00:02:13.710> works<00:02:14.010> and<00:02:14.850> that's

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
to show you how this works and that's

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.050 
to show you how this works and that's
the<00:02:15.330> little<00:02:15.480> by<00:02:15.690> Feiler<00:02:16.020> coil<00:02:16.470> I<00:02:16.770> also<00:02:17.370> added<00:02:17.760> a

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
the little by Feiler coil I also added a

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.130 
the little by Feiler coil I also added a
potentiometer<00:02:18.960> here<00:02:19.200> to<00:02:19.350> control<00:02:19.800> the

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:21.140 
potentiometer here to control the

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.810 
potentiometer here to control the
voltage<00:02:22.140> going<00:02:22.650> into<00:02:22.950> the<00:02:23.040> base<00:02:23.340> of<00:02:23.370> this

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
voltage going into the base of this

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.300 
voltage going into the base of this
transistor<00:02:24.180> this<00:02:24.840> is<00:02:24.900> a<00:02:25.050> little<00:02:25.290> 2<00:02:25.500> into<00:02:25.890> 2<00:02:26.070> 2

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310

potentiometer right here I can dial up
more<00:04:42.860> power<00:04:43.220> now<00:04:44.210> I<00:04:44.270> want<00:04:44.479> to<00:04:44.539> show<00:04:44.750> you<00:04:44.810> here

00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:45.199 
more power now I want to show you here

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:47.409 
more power now I want to show you here
this<00:04:45.229> it's<00:04:45.800> going<00:04:46.039> to<00:04:46.099> climb<00:04:46.400> if<00:04:46.699> i<00:04:46.849> dial<00:04:47.180> this

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:47.419 
this it's going to climb if i dial this

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:52.439 
this it's going to climb if i dial this
up<00:04:47.630> more<00:04:47.840> power

00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:52.449 

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:55.060 

there<00:04:53.449> goes<00:04:53.630> more<00:04:53.870> power<00:04:54.139> going<00:04:54.560> into<00:04:54.740> these

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:55.070 
there goes more power going into these

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:56.980 
there goes more power going into these
batteries<00:04:55.610> here<00:04:55.820> on<00:04:55.970> this<00:04:56.150> side<00:04:56.419> here<00:04:56.840> now

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:56.990 
batteries here on this side here now

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:59.680 
batteries here on this side here now
that's<00:04:57.680> costing<00:04:58.310> me<00:04:58.490> some<00:04:58.759> on<00:04:58.940> that<00:04:59.180> side<00:04:59.479> it's

00:04:59.680 --> 00:04:59.690 
that's costing me some on that side it's

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:01.600 
that's costing me some on that side it's
just<00:04:59.900> like<00:05:00.050> Abedini<00:05:00.650> you<00:05:00.830> have<00:05:01.039> to<00:05:01.190> find<00:05:01.490> the

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610 
just like Abedini you have to find the

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:05.200 
just like Abedini you have to find the
sweet<00:05:01.880> spot<00:05:01.910> and<00:05:02.570> let<00:05:03.229> this<00:05:03.410> thing<00:05:03.680> run<00:05:04.210> but

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210 
sweet spot and let this thing run but

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:08.529 
sweet spot and let this thing run but
yeah<00:05:05.389> this<00:05:05.599> is<00:05:05.810> a<00:05:05.840> charging<00:05:06.880> circuit<00:05:07.880> now<00:05:08.300> on

00:05:08.529 --> 00:05:08.539 
yeah this is a charging circuit now on

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:12.180 
yeah this is a charging circuit now on
this<00:05:08.660> Joule<00:05:09.080> thief<00:05:09.440> circuit<00:05:10.240> now<00:05:11.240> on<00:05:11.570> lights

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:12.190 
this Joule thief circuit now on lights

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:14.649 
this Joule thief circuit now on lights
I'll<00:05:13.190> just<00:05:13.460> connect<00:05:13.789> the<00:05:13.940> light<00:05:14.120> to<00:05:14.360> and<00:05:14.509> show

00:05:14.649 --> 00:05:14.659 
I'll just connect the light to and show

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:15.999 
I'll just connect the light to and show
you<00:05:14.720> the<00:05:14.840> lights<00:05:15.080> you<00:05:15.380> can<00:05:15.590> connect<00:05:15.889> the

00:05:15.999 --> 00:05:16.009 
you the lights you can connect the

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:22.719 
you the lights you can connect the
lights<00:05:16.250> -<00:05:18.520> there's<00:05:19.520> the<00:05:19.699> LEDs<00:05:20.240> going<00:05:20.630> on<00:05:21.729> and

00:05:22.719 --> 00:05:22.729 
lights - there's the LEDs going on and

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:26.740 
lights - there's the LEDs going on and
with<00:05:23.030> my<00:05:24.759> potentiometer<00:05:25.759> here<00:05:26.000> I<00:05:26.180> can<00:05:26.479> vary

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:26.750 
with my potentiometer here I can vary

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:29.260 
with my potentiometer here I can vary
the<00:05:26.840> intensity<00:05:27.500> of<00:05:27.710> the<00:05:27.830> lights<00:05:28.070> -<00:05:28.460> they<00:05:28.940> go<00:05:29.120> up

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:29.270 
the intensity of the lights - they go up

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:32.439 
the intensity of the lights - they go up
and<00:05:29.479> down<00:05:29.570> also<00:05:30.849> this<00:05:31.849> isn't<00:05:32.210> going<00:05:32.330> to<00:05:32.419> show

00:05:32.439 --> 00:05:32.449 
and down also this isn't going to show

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:34.180 
and down also this isn't going to show
on<00:05:32.810> the<00:05:32.930> camera<00:05:33.349> very<00:05:33.470> well<00:05:33.680> because<00:05:34.009> the

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:34.190 
on the camera very well because the

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:38.290 
on the camera very well because the
camera<00:05:34.960> averages<00:05:35.960> out<00:05:36.110> the<00:05:36.380> luminosity<00:05:37.300> so

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:38.300 
camera averages out the luminosity so

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:39.820 
camera averages out the luminosity so
it's<00:05:38.449> hard<00:05:38.659> to<00:05:38.750> show<00:05:38.960> brightness<00:05:39.469> on<00:05:39.650> this

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:39.830 
it's hard to show brightness on this

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:45.159 
it's hard to show brightness on this
camera<00:05:43.000> but<00:05:44.000> yeah<00:05:44.210> this<00:05:44.389> was<00:05:44.659> a<00:05:44.690> fun<00:05:45.139> little

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:45.169 
camera but yeah this was a fun little

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:47.529 
camera but yeah this was a fun little
project<00:05:45.800> today<00:05:46.400> I<00:05:46.430> got<00:05:46.699> a<00:05:46.729> big<00:05:47.000> bang<00:05:47.270> out<00:05:47.479> of

00:05:47.529 --> 00:05:47.539 
project today I got a big bang out of

00:05:47.539 --> 00:05:49.810 
project today I got a big bang out of
this<00:05:47.780> one<00:05:48.050> it's<00:05:48.259> such<00:05:48.500> a<00:05:48.620> simple<00:05:49.280> little<00:05:49.430> thing

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:49.820 
this one it's such a simple little thing

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:54.700 
this one it's such a simple little thing
it's<00:05:50.780> just<00:05:50.960> this<00:05:51.820> one<00:05:52.820> little<00:05:53.030> -<00:05:53.419> and<00:05:53.659> -<00:05:53.930> -<00:05:54.259> and

those for less than three bucks and then

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:11.620 
those for less than three bucks and then
it's<00:06:07.490> 20<00:06:07.969> turns<00:06:08.300> -<00:06:09.340> two<00:06:10.340> coils<00:06:10.610> of<00:06:10.969> 20<00:06:11.330> turns

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:11.630 
it's 20 turns - two coils of 20 turns

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:14.560 
it's 20 turns - two coils of 20 turns
each<00:06:12.409> and<00:06:12.889> it<00:06:13.669> runs<00:06:13.909> through<00:06:14.180> this<00:06:14.360> little

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:14.570 
each and it runs through this little

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:16.719 
each and it runs through this little
transistor<00:06:15.199> and<00:06:15.590> then<00:06:15.710> a<00:06:15.770> resistance<00:06:16.400> here<00:06:16.490> on

00:06:16.719 --> 00:06:16.729 
transistor and then a resistance here on

00:06:16.729 --> 00:06:19.749 
transistor and then a resistance here on
the<00:06:16.849> base<00:06:17.120> and<00:06:17.509> then<00:06:18.440> it<00:06:18.620> goes<00:06:18.830> to<00:06:18.860> the<00:06:19.159> LEDs<00:06:19.729> in

00:06:19.749 --> 00:06:19.759 
the base and then it goes to the LEDs in

00:06:19.759 --> 00:06:22.240 
the base and then it goes to the LEDs in
the<00:06:20.180> normal<00:06:20.599> Joule<00:06:21.199> thief<00:06:21.440> circuit<00:06:21.500> and<00:06:22.159> then

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:22.250 
the normal Joule thief circuit and then

00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:25.060 
the normal Joule thief circuit and then
I<00:06:22.340> spin<00:06:22.789> off<00:06:23.000> of<00:06:23.030> that<00:06:23.389> go<00:06:24.380> through<00:06:24.680> a<00:06:24.710> diode

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:25.070 
I spin off of that go through a diode

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:27.520 
I spin off of that go through a diode
and<00:06:25.699> now<00:06:26.030> I've<00:06:26.210> got<00:06:26.419> a<00:06:26.449> charging<00:06:26.990> circuit<00:06:27.229> out

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:27.530 
and now I've got a charging circuit out

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:29.019 
and now I've got a charging circuit out
of<00:06:27.650> it<00:06:27.740> you<00:06:27.860> see<00:06:28.039> how<00:06:28.099> the<00:06:28.159> voltage<00:06:28.400> is<00:06:28.759> going

00:06:29.019 --> 00:06:29.029 
of it you see how the voltage is going

00:06:29.029 --> 00:06:32.680 
of it you see how the voltage is going
off<00:06:29.180> on<00:06:29.210> the<00:06:29.510> charge<00:06:29.810> batteries<00:06:30.320> but

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:32.690 
off on the charge batteries but

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:34.990 
off on the charge batteries but
now<00:06:32.840> this<00:06:33.050> is<00:06:33.230> something<00:06:33.470> that<00:06:33.820> it's<00:06:34.820> got<00:06:34.970> a

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:35.000 
now this is something that it's got a

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.640 
now this is something that it's got a
lot<00:06:35.120> of<00:06:35.150> potential<00:06:35.630> I<00:06:35.840> think<00:06:35.870> a<00:06:36.140> lot<00:06:36.320> of<00:06:36.350> guys

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:36.650 
lot of potential I think a lot of guys

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:38.170 
lot of potential I think a lot of guys
are<00:06:36.920> playing<00:06:37.160> around<00:06:37.460> this<00:06:37.670> have<00:06:37.910> the<00:06:38.000> right

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:38.180 
are playing around this have the right

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:39.970 
are playing around this have the right
idea<00:06:38.660> now<00:06:39.170> I'm<00:06:39.230> going<00:06:39.350> to<00:06:39.410> seeing<00:06:39.560> more<00:06:39.830> and

00:06:39.970 --> 00:06:39.980 
idea now I'm going to seeing more and

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:42.040
