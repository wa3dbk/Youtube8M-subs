00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.880 
the 99 Saab 95 - 2.3 liter 4-cylinder so
basically<00:00:22.400> in<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.519> last<00:00:23.730> of<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.000> video<00:00:24.269> I

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:24.890 
basically in the last of the video I

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:26.960 
basically in the last of the video I
specified<00:00:25.890> that<00:00:26.070> you<00:00:26.189> don't<00:00:26.369> need<00:00:26.519> to<00:00:26.670> remove

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
specified that you don't need to remove

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.609 
specified that you don't need to remove
the<00:00:27.300> rear<00:00:27.900> engine<00:00:28.109> mount<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:29.429> bolt<00:00:29.640> and<00:00:30.619> shift

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
the rear engine mount the bolt and shift

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:36.470 
the rear engine mount the bolt and shift
engine<00:00:32.130> around<00:00:33.260> so<00:00:34.790> it<00:00:35.790> was<00:00:36.000> a<00:00:36.030> lot<00:00:36.300> easier

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
engine around so it was a lot easier

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.400 
engine around so it was a lot easier
than<00:00:36.660> I<00:00:36.870> thought

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
than I thought

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.430 
than I thought
I<00:00:37.440> mean<00:00:37.710> it<00:00:37.890> was<00:00:38.250> still<00:00:38.340> a<00:00:38.520> pain<00:00:39.079> to<00:00:40.079> get<00:00:40.200> a<00:00:40.260> lot

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
I mean it was still a pain to get a lot

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:46.190 
I mean it was still a pain to get a lot
of<00:00:40.590> stuff<00:00:40.800> done<00:00:43.940> done<00:00:44.940> to<00:00:45.120> it<00:00:45.270> it's<00:00:45.870> kind<00:00:46.140> of

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
of stuff done done to it it's kind of

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.529 
of stuff done done to it it's kind of
hard<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:46.500> see<00:00:46.770> because<00:00:46.890> igner<00:00:47.309> of<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.550> Sun<00:00:47.789> but

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
hard to see because igner of the Sun but

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:56.720

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
won't have any problems I ran into that

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.109 
won't have any problems I ran into that
a<00:01:56.880> couple<00:01:57.210> times<00:01:57.420> I<00:01:57.689> tighten<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.439> top<00:01:58.619> up<00:01:58.890> and

the<00:02:00.119> bottom<00:02:00.270> one<00:02:00.509> wouldn't<00:02:00.810> go<00:02:00.899> in<00:02:01.049> so<00:02:01.259> I<00:02:01.829> took

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
the bottom one wouldn't go in so I took

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.780 
the bottom one wouldn't go in so I took
that<00:02:02.250> off<00:02:02.310> tightened<00:02:03.030> and<00:02:03.420> this<00:02:04.049> is<00:02:04.229> also

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
that off tightened and this is also

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.249 
that off tightened and this is also
tightening<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:05.909> bracket<00:02:06.270> so<00:02:06.509> the<00:02:06.810> lessons

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
tightening the bracket so the lessons

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.570 
tightening the bracket so the lessons
learned<00:02:07.530> you<00:02:07.740> know<00:02:07.890> you<00:02:07.950> learn<00:02:08.129> as<00:02:08.310> you<00:02:08.429> go

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
learned you know you learn as you go

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.160 
learned you know you learn as you go
it's<00:02:08.759> a<00:02:08.849> do-it-yourself<00:02:09.000> this<00:02:09.629> is<00:02:09.780> my<00:02:09.899> first

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
it's a do-it-yourself this is my first

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.350 
it's a do-it-yourself this is my first
alternator<00:02:10.649> I've<00:02:10.800> ever

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
alternator I've ever

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.589 
alternator I've ever
replaced<00:02:13.360> on<00:02:13.690> a<00:02:14.159> European<00:02:15.159> car<00:02:15.390> I've<00:02:16.390> done

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:16.599 
replaced on a European car I've done

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:18.570 
replaced on a European car I've done
American<00:02:17.019> cars<00:02:17.230> which<00:02:17.470> the<00:02:17.890> alternator<00:02:18.250> sits

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
American cars which the alternator sits

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:20.610 
American cars which the alternator sits
in<00:02:18.670> the<00:02:18.760> front<00:02:19.000> so<00:02:19.450> it's<00:02:19.750> all<00:02:20.080> it<00:02:20.319> was<00:02:20.440> always

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
in the front so it's all it was always

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:26.640 
in the front so it's all it was always
easy<00:02:21.030> but<00:02:23.549> back<00:02:24.549> here<00:02:24.760> this<00:02:24.940> was<00:02:25.150> a<00:02:25.349> it<00:02:26.349> wasn't

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
easy but back here this was a it wasn't

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.009 
easy but back here this was a it wasn't
as<00:02:26.890> bad<00:02:27.040> as<00:02:27.099> I<00:02:27.370> thought<00:02:27.519> it<00:02:27.580> would<00:02:27.790> be<00:02:27.970> and<00:02:28.239> it

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 
as bad as I thought it would be and it

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:32.280 
as bad as I thought it would be and it
took<00:02:29.230> a<00:02:29.290> total<00:02:29.560> of<00:02:29.910> about<00:02:30.910> three<00:02:31.870> hours<00:02:32.019> I

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
took a total of about three hours I

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.550 
took a total of about three hours I
started<00:02:32.590> about<00:02:32.769> nine<00:02:33.040> and<00:02:33.870> finished<00:02:34.870> actually

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:41.230 
to use an engine hoist which I didn't

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.770 
to use an engine hoist which I didn't
use<00:03:41.470> I<00:03:41.739> just<00:03:41.769> used<00:03:42.130> the<00:03:42.250> jack<00:03:42.519> under<00:03:42.940> the<00:03:43.480> car

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:43.780 
use I just used the jack under the car

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.159 
use I just used the jack under the car
with<00:03:44.590> a<00:03:44.620> two-by-four<00:03:45.750> centering<00:03:46.750> it<00:03:46.870> on<00:03:46.989> the

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:47.169 
with a two-by-four centering it on the

00:03:47.169 --> 00:03:50.190 
with a two-by-four centering it on the
bottom<00:03:47.650> of<00:03:47.739> the<00:03:47.919> oil<00:03:48.250> pan<00:03:48.519> to<00:03:49.329> lift<00:03:49.599> up<00:03:49.840> the

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
bottom of the oil pan to lift up the

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.569 
bottom of the oil pan to lift up the
engine<00:03:50.530> and<00:03:51.090> that<00:03:52.090> that<00:03:52.599> worked<00:03:53.079> well<00:03:53.590> and<00:03:53.919> and

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:54.579 
engine and that that worked well and and

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:56.849 
engine and that that worked well and and
again<00:03:55.329> you<00:03:55.840> don't<00:03:55.930> have<00:03:56.139> to<00:03:56.260> take<00:03:56.410> the<00:03:56.590> trim

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:56.859 
again you don't have to take the trim

00:03:56.859 --> 00:04:00.390 
again you don't have to take the trim
out<00:03:57.040> of<00:03:57.190> the<00:03:57.310> wheel<00:03:57.579> well<00:03:57.930> because<00:03:59.400> there's

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
out of the wheel well because there's

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:02.280 
out of the wheel well because there's
also<00:04:00.700> part<00:04:01.180> of<00:04:01.269> the<00:04:01.329> body<00:04:01.540> inside<00:04:01.930> the<00:04:01.989> wheel

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:02.290 
also part of the body inside the wheel

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.309 
also part of the body inside the wheel
well<00:04:02.530> that<00:04:03.099> the<00:04:03.280> trim<00:04:03.519> covers<00:04:03.940> so<00:04:04.540> you're<00:04:05.200> not

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:05.319 
well that the trim covers so you're not

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:07.199 
well that the trim covers so you're not
really<00:04:05.560> doing<00:04:05.709> you<00:04:06.190> know<00:04:06.310> you're<00:04:06.910> not<00:04:07.000> really

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
really doing you know you're not really

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:09.470

helping<00:04:07.359> yourself<00:04:07.780> by<00:04:07.840> removing<00:04:08.379> that<00:04:08.500> and

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:09.480 
helping yourself by removing that and

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.059 
helping yourself by removing that and
another<00:04:10.480> thing<00:04:10.750> is<00:04:10.959> I<00:04:11.379> didn't<00:04:11.739> have<00:04:11.859> to<00:04:11.980> remove

00:04:12.059 --> 00:04:12.069
