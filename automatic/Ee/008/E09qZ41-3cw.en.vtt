00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:12.400
 Yes I will talk about the guitar chord change tips today 

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:20.100
 The voice of the code display is a sound at high altitude 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:23.180
 It is called a hoard change that the movement of the time to connect 1 to the next of the different sound 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:28.160
 Eh 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:29.330
 I always say that this code change, but the guitar is that here is not connected well 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.480
 Bounce your 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:36.250
 Hearing quite often 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:40.870
 It is Nan, so I will talk about that switch. 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:42.880
 For example because code and c that c is 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.950
 Yup 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:49.730
 That's the feeling 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:53.370
 I called the c things went like that and this mode was in the middle same 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.510
 Another one eh weiner 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.280
 a minor 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.280
 It is this form 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:03.649
 In the form of 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:06.770
 Is called a minor but this code is two 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:07.950
 What happens to everyone if you say good thing code change please try 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.450
 Or 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:14.360
 If if 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:17.880
 If this seems to be happening 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:19.630
 That's not a legal move . 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:25.830
 What is already 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:32.370
 It is such one It does not seem to be a problem no problem 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:34.970
 Currently there are a lot of people who are getting into trouble, but it is efficient code change 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.970
 Because 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.080
 Yeah I wonder if you know 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:48.140
 It does not let you You're talking about there is no need to ring such that it does not keep an extra finger 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:58.910
 That means that there is no break at all. 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.910
 This flower stone 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:08.450
 I think I can hear the sound out of a moment 

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.450
 Yeah because 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:28.190
 I think it is good to do this preparation without having to talk or release 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:34.430
 Because it is first is the first tips and after the bear in mind as much as possible a minimum of movement 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:36.530
 There is another point, but it is a story that is very close to the present , but I do not move as it is now 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.950
 Most of the good things are said 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:43.860
 Because not only a case 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.860
 For example, there is a code d 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:49.060
 A child who holds down a save run 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:53.590
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:56.569
 I think people who play electric will be like this from here for example 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:59.790
 Good code 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:01.390
 How do you work if you need to go 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:05.680
 me 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:07.400
 Clearly let this your Wow over 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.160
 Yup 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:13.700
 Then 9 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:16.880
 This it to the index finger to the shaft 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:22.000
 Poop up 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:28.650
 I think it is the most beautiful to do this is also true 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.650
 In that case, there is a Japan axis here , so that blurring is reduced 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:38.410
 Yup 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:44.880
 Is that sister 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:44.880
 This is an attempt to anyway minimize the movement 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.810
 It is to say 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:55.520
 This is such a breeze even when any code change 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:04:00.880
 It is important to be aware of the movement as simple as possible 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:03.580
 Always that such efficient movement in connection of any absolute code and be aware of it 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:08.030
 The find should see the something 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:10.030
 I think that it is good to always think about such a thing 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:10.030
 Hmm 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.550
 Own 

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:17.100
 Minutes 

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:21.880
 me 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:27.640
 For example, there is a section called Iima a minor. 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:30.430
 People go to say that would talk once Kobatto am fine from here, but this is also as much as possible 

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:34.560
 Round fly of small movement because it is also the same shape 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.560
 Let 's move it in this form, right ? 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.150
 Hmm 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:44.000
 This is efficiency 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:47.870
 Will be the wind that 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:49.150
 This is true of any other code, though 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:53.080
 Hmm 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:53.770
 Polariton after and in good to do not take, rather than, for example, 

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.650
 Hmm 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:05:03.340
 There is such a minor form 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:03.340
 There is I am doing this kind of form, but say from here 

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:08.039
 I have to go to the 7th board 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:09.240
 Yes 

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:19.729
 No 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:19.729
 It is Kara efficiency which is also doing this to Fu that this and Tokusuru Ya do not take 

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:23.260
 Hmm 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.449
 The wind that 

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:28.710
 It is good to do it 

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:34.039
 I think that good because it's short of this release Prefecture, which is said to this open code 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:34.039
 It's not such a sophisticated outside mixed up a lot 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:40.650
 Even at high altitudes with high position beyond 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:47.000
 It is an effective way of thinking 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:47.000
 Thank you for trying it as a reference for code change
