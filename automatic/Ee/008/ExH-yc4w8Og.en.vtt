episode has not aired yet in the New
York<00:03:01.110> Region<00:03:01.550> so<00:03:02.550> if<00:03:03.060> you<00:03:03.240> get<00:03:03.450> this<00:03:03.630> like

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990 
York Region so if you get this like

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:06.200 
York Region so if you get this like
before<00:03:04.380> December<00:03:04.860> 8th<00:03:05.040> you<00:03:05.820> can<00:03:05.970> watch<00:03:06.090> the

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
last episode before other people so I

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.720 
last episode before other people so I
guess<00:03:08.490> that's<00:03:08.700> a<00:03:08.760> bonus<00:03:09.030> feature<00:03:10.580> but<00:03:11.580> other

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
guess that's a bonus feature but other

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.010 
guess that's a bonus feature but other
than<00:03:11.820> that<00:03:11.970> I<00:03:12.000> would<00:03:12.270> recommend<00:03:12.600> getting<00:03:12.870> the

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
than that I would recommend getting the

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:14.780 
than that I would recommend getting the
blu-ray<00:03:13.320> version<00:03:13.350> as<00:03:13.890> opposed<00:03:14.340> to<00:03:14.430> the<00:03:14.550> DVD

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
blu-ray version as opposed to the DVD

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.850 
blu-ray version as opposed to the DVD
version<00:03:14.960> because<00:03:15.960> it's<00:03:16.170> the<00:03:16.260> first<00:03:16.470> season<00:03:16.800> of

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
version because it's the first season of

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.180 
version because it's the first season of
power<00:03:17.070> inches<00:03:17.400> to<00:03:17.820> be<00:03:17.850> shot<00:03:18.210> in<00:03:18.240> HD<00:03:18.690> and<00:03:19.410> I<00:03:20.010> must

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
power inches to be shot in HD and I must

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:21.920 
power inches to be shot in HD and I must
say<00:03:20.340> it<00:03:20.490> does<00:03:20.520> look<00:03:20.850> absolutely<00:03:21.120> gorgeous<00:03:21.480> on
