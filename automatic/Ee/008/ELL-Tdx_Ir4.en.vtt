00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.840
 age 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:17.510
 video tutorials forum where your questions 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:20.510
 teachers meet the site urokimuse.ru 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.510
 presents 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.949
 all in the drum game I loved 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.449
 I was always tired of doing technique 

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:45.110
 these hours of gathering for 

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:47.530
 the training pads are all cool 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:52.100
 exercises for separate training hands 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:54.550
 foot coordination unison of improvisation 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.550
 betrayed 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.729
 because own idea 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:00.620
 which I want to present to you now 

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:02.269
 the meaning of this idea is to 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:06.710
 do several things 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:10.750
 simultaneously simultaneously train 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.750
 coordination technique and carry 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.220
 in fact we all do it when 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.380
 blunt floor on the floor or in hat counts down 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.659
 quarters a while we 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.679
 practicing on a training penny or 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:23.659
 snare drum 

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:28.399
 I suggest to go further for example you 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:30.140
 train paradiddles and cheats in addition to Bani 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:32.000
 foursomes and find i suggest 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.590
 use also the right but the patent for 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.190
 bass drum everyone chooses for himself 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.759
 myself 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:39.110
 which one you think is the most convenient and 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:42.319
 more interest i like very often 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:47.349
 I use a basic drawing for bass and 

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:48.770
 drums fighting style with hyung can also 

00:01:47.349 --> 00:01:56.209
 you can experiment 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:02:00.830
 play share can be played on and can 

00:01:56.209 --> 00:02:02.390
 play the eighth note short 1 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:04.759
 the idea is to engage 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.520
 hand technique surface over new pattern 

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:09.649
 in the legs while following the orchestration and 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:14.209
 unison and claire we deal with the paradigm 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:15.200
 take over and above this picture 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:17.270
 impose parade 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:18.890
 there we throw the lead hand on hat or wright 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.220
 after what we scatter drawing by 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.220
 entire installation 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.970
 it turns out that involuntarily 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:50.950
 your musicality is also trained 

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:50.950
 music lessons dot ru 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:59.939
 and street work can be done and 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.709
 on the contrary, that is, now kick down 

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:06.569
 true drawing in hands for example 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:08.189
 take such a paradite and mind and 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:17.700
 between paradise there even this and small 

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:39.840
 drum accent we beat 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:49.769
 the resulting potter kicked it was 2 by 

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:50.909
 music lessons the point of ru is her 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:52.799
 tom that train two drawings 

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:54.750
 at the same time really most 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:56.910
 time we do that and take for 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:01.319
 example drawing cuban 6 eighths in 

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:03.599
 hands and feet will play something 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:06.859
 inherent funky will turn out so myself 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:06.859
 unusual of time shuffle 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:23.380
 This is my personal opinion and approach convenient 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.060
 to me personally, but I can't help it not 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:29.070
