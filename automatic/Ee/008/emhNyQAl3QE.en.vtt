00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:06.240
 having a sustainable attitude is a matter of 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.639
 I'm a habit here with ritata freitas que 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.929
 is a personal organizer and gives tips on how to 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.139
 the people 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:15.480
 organize the house economizing is renata 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.310
 here in the room that we can do 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.990
 Good here in the room things we can 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.279
 do to save energy for 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.300
 example you can start with the 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.369
 light bulbs 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.920
 the ramp of fluorescent or white and 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.289
 light save around 75% of 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.939
 energy compared to yellow 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.710
 so if we can change lamps 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.840
 We're already going to contribute a lot to the environment. 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.270
 environment with our pocket also 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.360
 Another issue is the TV sets 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.760
 and dvd sound you only call when really 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.950
 to use to stand by and also spend 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.289
 then I can save money too. 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.510
 with this procedure 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.160
 another issue also in environments and 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.789
 should maximize the use of energy 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.680
 natural then windows doors 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.680
 I can not turn on the light while I can 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.109
 best light colors they favor 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.640
 natural light then lighter environment 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.809
 It's not me, I'll be able to use Portuguese better. 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.850
 natural 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.000
 another environment that is also possible 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.189
 save a lot is in the bathroom renata 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.200
 How can we do it here? 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.570
 here in the bathroom for example a large 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.759
 villain in case of waste of energy 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.960
 It is electric power consumption 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.909
 electric shower 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.700
 so if the electric shower he is 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:25.950
 in summer it saves about 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.630
 40% electric power 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.790
 so the very important tip also 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.100
 during the shower in the case of 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.619
 adults if they can use a bucket and 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.500
 a basin to stop while washing 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.659
 during the very moment of the hair 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.579
 bath to stop water so that water does not 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:44.880
 if you completely lose this water after 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:48.840
 can be reused in the toilet 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.670
 also has tips on the discharge and sink in the 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.950
 Download then we will not be long. 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.409
 to leave the finger there for a long time in the 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.570
 downloading three seconds is usually 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.850
 enough then when it is sufficient 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:03.000
 the little finger would not spend so much 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:04.350
 the water in relation to the sink 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.180
 children during the time when 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.910
 they are brushing their teeth then 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.610
 while brushing the alloy teeth 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.860
 so that the water is not 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.210
 do not be wasted and always parents 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.710
 after she finishes giving a 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:17.870
 Acknowledgments 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:20.090
 because sometimes they let dripping 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.310
 So it also consumes water, too. 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:24.320
 Can I save money with this care? 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.780
 now we come to the environment that is 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:29.870
 a real trap for the owner of 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:32.630
 This house does not renata the kitchen is full of 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.910
 places where you can save money 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.459
 enough or spend a lot of money, this is 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.470
 An example is the refrigerator, right? 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:41.660
 so the refrigerator is a big villain 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.030
 for waste of energy 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.340
 It is interesting that the housewife in 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.720
 own organization of the refrigerator 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.630
 use as we can see here 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:53.480
 transparent refractories will help 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:55.370
 identification of the food then how much 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.280
 The better she knows where things are. 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.650
 the less time she will spend watching the 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.320
 how is she doing now in 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.860
 open refrigerator and just looking for some 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.110
 thing 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.150
 exactly what happens to the refrigerator 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.489
 She's going to have to work bent to 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.560
 supply the energy that was wasted in the 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:14.270
 time it was open then to the 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.730
 food was well preserved 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:18.049
 will generate more energy to cool 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.299
 all again 

00:03:18.049 --> 00:03:22.489
 that's why it's also very interesting parents 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:24.440
 work with children, do not you 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:26.269
 not opening the entire refrigerator 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.190
 child hour what it is you want 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:30.739
 then the father or mother who will already know 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.810
 where you are and will be looking faster and 

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:35.660
 will waste less energy 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:39.200
 also loves stove is a trap that 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:42.440
 can greatly disrupt the economy in 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:44.690
 gas issue is rather interesting that the 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.370
 stove is well positioned away from 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:49.250
 large ventilation areas 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:51.200
 it's not because if you put one thing 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.750
 to cook something to cook and 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.239
 there the wind comes then until you feel that 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:58.790
 the gas is leaking gas 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:02.060
 So you're missing gas there then. 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.980
 away from ventilated areas and when you 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:06.290
 to cook something you have 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:08.900
 February care you can download the 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.850
 Fire, no problem , renata goes. 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:15.260
 take time but not cooking time 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:17.150
 is the same and you can consume less gas 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.729
 Do not forget to also always cover the 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.170
 pans because panela stamped them 

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:23.660
 save twice 

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:25.580
 but gas than the food being 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:27.980
 cooked and the uncovered pan 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:29.780
 now we have some general tips on 

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:32.240
 house entry for example in the 

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:35.420
 supermarket has things that are 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.610
 2 infallible example a snack 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:40.400
 before going to the supermarket is not well 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:42.470
 fed and make a purchase of a snack 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.600
 check what you already have at home so that 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:46.580
 there is no waste since all of a sudden 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:48.530
 she does not forget to check some 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:51.140
 food that would be close to winning than 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:52.970
 he can use it then go check it out 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:55.280
 who is really needing to write 

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:57.200
 everything and go fed 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:58.730
 because then you will consume less too 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:01.220
 in the supermarket will buy only what 

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:04.460
 you need renata to finish the 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:07.040
 garbage separation at home is 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:09.200
 very important also very important 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:11.720
 a lot when you do the selective collection 

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:13.610
 Do you see how much material you 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:16.430
 directed to the correct environment 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:18.680
 then if the housewife if the whole 

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:20.660
 family can engage in it there because 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:22.880
 are various materials that can be 

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:24.680
 forwarded to the selective collection not 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.740
 is the housewife along with the 

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.740
 family
