00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.970
 good 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:08.369
 The album has the quality of 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.750
 opened page always launches the 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.750
 material quality 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.830
 the too weak will try to open a 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.500
 package 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.560
 let's try not walk open a 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.390
 package here to see how these 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:29.100
 Schools are not figurines in Brazil. 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:36.300
 little cardboard there 4g in a lacquer tries 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:49.350
 Focus there I know you can see the 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:54.959
 planet years are little cards with 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:56.700
 normal quality until normal 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.959
 special chrome may not have 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.810
 special ne 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:02.490
 but obviously how lucky I am 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.540
 did not come here 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:08.640
 good is sessions to my impressions about 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.190
 the album I do not know if you like it 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:14.610
 interesting if the price is too expensive 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:17.550
 unfortunately, but who wants to leave the 

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:20.190
 benches and bookstores come in those packages 

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:22.620
 with with figurine album also together 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:25.440
 then who wants to collect and 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:28.110
 obviously I will not collect much 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:31.950
 because these qualities give me anger 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:35.489
 but at least to have as a target of 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:37.950
 collection is interesting is this personal the 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:40.350
 fast game is already going to take four minutes 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:43.380
 I wish you liked it 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:47.900
 if you liked and that is a young man and comment 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:47.900
 then okay, until the next time
