00:00:14.329 --> 00:00:18.289

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.849
 yes incident that 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:24.849
 that I also play it better with the eye in addition 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.449
 yes sr 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.349
 good for that and it is important 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:34.210
 was that just before the winter break one of the problems of this team knows that 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:35.330
 you as a young boy 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.760
 few experienced guys around you 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.080
 followed with them then 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.080
 yes many important players and where players have 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.690
 and then it is, after all, it is a good plan 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:50.840
 With that the interest returned and I got a new trailer 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:52.290
 so view 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.840
 well then the state must have come mcclaren to vitesse already give my 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:57.530
 peace 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.710
 so the boys come along now so that also applies to you 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.510
 yes for example such players to be important to us now 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.260
 yes it will be there too 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.600
 no one who follows those opponents who actually know everything about opponents 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:17.020
 and all this, the band is trying to find someone out twice, but I know 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.320
 what type the opponent against but the plan 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:22.520
 watts qualities are in it 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.520
 are a lesser points, it becomes difficult 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:30.290
 yes probably big strong and reasonably quick on our requirements 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:31.700
 discussion about on television 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.410
 year scores easily 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:36.799
 we just have to make sure that you 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:40.569
 he joined sunday week i show more romania this type defend what 

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:43.490
 she really fully focuses on an opponent you also want yourself 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.320
 the soccer player and his stamp 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.590
 yes that more more quality and concern at the ball instead of going to the 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.260
 become an opponent 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.260
 try to do that should work better 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.259
 yes i think feyenoord to build it up and to press it 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.110
 years back a better then 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:03.530
 8 defend 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.980
 Is that an aspect that you want to develop that game or precisely because of this 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:10.040
 focus on the things you never know well 

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:13.809
 yes too but I also want to 

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:16.809
 and learn to defend better and that she already had 

00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:21.709
 it is better to do an example axes against twente 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:27.200
 constructive not really to comic to me for the farewell 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.459
 contest 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:31.210
 we must show the defender against 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:32.659
 janko that 

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:35.299
 before this was and it is 

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:37.019
 and who scored a lot and on it 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:40.789
 there is still with ronan he switched so to speak 

00:02:41.529 --> 00:02:45.370
 what can you add to your profile in this competition because you can 

00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:46.219
 also say what 

00:02:46.219 --> 00:02:49.620
 the gap with the teams that are on the left-hand side of the battle 

00:02:49.619 --> 00:02:50.859
 participation playoffs 

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:53.859
 european court because that is too big or think differently about it 

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:57.609
 yes it is certainly big but I think it is 

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:00.829
 about the choice for me that is 

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:04.199
 yes six more points for the terrain 

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:07.199
 that is achievable, but it is difficult enough for me 

00:03:07.749 --> 00:03:11.799
 yes what market share of such a topper to be a good opponent 

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:13.329
 year are part 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:16.160
 ach ach ressiv and very very good in the newspaper 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.979
 in the switchover 

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:22.169
 there you see that they come out quickly with 

00:03:22.169 --> 00:03:25.789
 years when playing like a corner and a private audience yes then they are just whole 

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:29.229
 dangerous and also a lot of scoring strikers 

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:30.430
 embarrassed a good team
