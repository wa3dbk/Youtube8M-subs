to<00:01:33.610> make<00:01:33.700> sure<00:01:33.880> it<00:01:34.119> works<00:01:34.360> as<00:01:34.630> you<00:01:35.140> see<00:01:35.320> well<00:01:35.620> if

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:35.799 
to make sure it works as you see well if

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:37.380 
to make sure it works as you see well if
I<00:01:35.920> turn<00:01:36.100> the<00:01:36.250> volume<00:01:36.549> up<00:01:36.670> in<00:01:36.820> the<00:01:36.909> back<00:01:37.120> you

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
I turn the volume up in the back you

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:38.460 
I turn the volume up in the back you
would<00:01:37.540> of<00:01:37.659> here<00:01:37.840> you<00:01:38.080> would<00:01:38.200> have<00:01:38.260> heard

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
would of here you would have heard

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:40.890 
would of here you would have heard
around<00:01:39.250> completed<00:01:39.909> so<00:01:40.090> even<00:01:40.360> if<00:01:40.479> champion

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:40.900 
around completed so even if champion

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.330 
around completed so even if champion
didn't<00:01:41.110> revive<00:01:41.409> we<00:01:41.590> should<00:01:41.770> have<00:01:41.860> been<00:01:41.979> ok<00:01:42.280> to

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
didn't revive we should have been ok to

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.640 
didn't revive we should have been ok to
good<00:01:42.549> and<00:01:42.729> good<00:01:42.909> to<00:01:43.090> go<00:01:43.210> but<00:01:43.870> just<00:01:44.170> to<00:01:44.290> test<00:01:44.500> it

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:44.650 
good and good to go but just to test it

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:46.890 
good and good to go but just to test it
again<00:01:44.920> in<00:01:45.159> like<00:01:45.820> just<00:01:46.120> a<00:01:46.210> few<00:01:46.360> seconds<00:01:46.780> you're

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:46.900 
again in like just a few seconds you're

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.109 
again in like just a few seconds you're
going<00:01:47.020> to<00:01:47.080> see<00:01:47.260> us<00:01:47.380> do<00:01:47.560> it<00:01:47.710> again<00:01:48.190> with<00:01:48.460> it<00:01:48.490> the

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:49.119 
going to see us do it again with it the

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:51.180 
going to see us do it again with it the
same<00:01:49.330> method<00:01:49.750> we're<00:01:50.380> gonna<00:01:50.470> kill<00:01:50.770> him<00:01:50.860> super

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190 
same method we're gonna kill him super

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.500 
same method we're gonna kill him super
fast<00:01:51.510> as<00:01:52.510> long<00:01:52.780> as<00:01:52.990> one<00:01:53.619> person<00:01:53.830> survives

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:54.510 
fast as long as one person survives

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:56.760 
fast as long as one person survives
those<00:01:55.510> what<00:01:55.869> you<00:01:55.960> want<00:01:56.110> to<00:01:56.200> do<00:01:56.320> is<00:01:56.440> you<00:01:56.470> want<00:01:56.590> to

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
those what you want to do is you want to

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.920 
those what you want to do is you want to
try<00:01:56.920> to<00:01:56.950> rocket<00:01:57.850> him<00:01:58.030> and<00:01:58.240> use<00:01:58.330> all<00:01:58.510> your<00:01:58.630> heavy

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
try to rocket him and use all your heavy

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.200 
try to rocket him and use all your heavy
super<00:01:59.380> fast<00:01:59.680> so<00:02:00.100> try<00:02:00.310> not<00:02:00.340> to<00:02:00.610> jump<00:02:00.820> in<00:02:00.970> and<00:02:01.090> out

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
super fast so try not to jump in and out

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:02.490 
super fast so try not to jump in and out
of<00:02:01.240> the<00:02:01.390> bubble<00:02:01.540> because<00:02:01.840> that<00:02:02.110> slows<00:02:02.320> it<00:02:02.470> down

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
of the bubble because that slows it down

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.289 
of the bubble because that slows it down
because<00:02:02.799> you<00:02:03.040> can<00:02:03.189> only<00:02:03.250> do<00:02:03.490> it<00:02:03.610> one<00:02:03.820> rocket<00:02:04.180> at

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:04.299 
because you can only do it one rocket at

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:06.870 
because you can only do it one rocket at
a<00:02:04.360> time<00:02:04.600> so<00:02:05.350> what<00:02:05.770> we<00:02:05.890> do<00:02:06.070> is<00:02:06.100> we<00:02:06.340> pop<00:02:06.549> a<00:02:06.580> bubble

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
a time so what we do is we pop a bubble

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.060 
a time so what we do is we pop a bubble
I<00:02:07.150> pop<00:02:07.510> out<00:02:07.689> on<00:02:07.720> the<00:02:07.960> left<00:02:08.140> shoot<00:02:08.500> two<00:02:08.649> rockets

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.070 
I pop out on the left shoot two rockets

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.280 
I pop out on the left shoot two rockets

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
take cover one person pops out in the

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.259 
take cover one person pops out in the
front<00:02:11.500> does<00:02:11.920> the<00:02:12.070> same<00:02:12.280> thing<00:02:12.519> and<00:02:12.760> one<00:02:12.910> person

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:13.269 
front does the same thing and one person

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:14.729 
front does the same thing and one person
pops<00:02:13.480> out<00:02:13.660> on<00:02:13.810> the<00:02:13.930> right<00:02:14.200> and<00:02:14.440> does<00:02:14.590> the<00:02:14.709> same

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:14.739 
pops out on the right and does the same

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:16.620 
pops out on the right and does the same
thing<00:02:15.130> now<00:02:15.640> if<00:02:15.730> you<00:02:15.820> do<00:02:15.940> it<00:02:16.060> fast<00:02:16.330> enough<00:02:16.450> you

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
thing now if you do it fast enough you

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.170 
thing now if you do it fast enough you
can<00:02:16.870> kill<00:02:17.110> before<00:02:17.320> he<00:02:17.590> summons<00:02:17.860> his<00:02:18.100> a<00:02:18.730> Theon

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
can kill before he summons his a Theon

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.100 
can kill before he summons his a Theon

and down or poking out the front that's

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.820 
and down or poking out the front that's
what<00:02:39.849> she<00:02:40.030> said<00:02:40.270> and<00:02:40.480> discrepancies<00:02:41.170> jumping

but<00:02:45.700> as<00:02:45.760> you<00:02:45.940> see<00:02:46.090> we're<00:02:46.270> killing<00:02:46.510> him<00:02:46.600> away

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
but as you see we're killing him away

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.320 
but as you see we're killing him away
faster<00:02:47.140> this<00:02:47.290> time<00:02:47.700> the<00:02:48.700> weapons<00:02:49.030> of<00:02:49.120> light

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:49.330 
faster this time the weapons of light

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.930 
faster this time the weapons of light
really<00:02:49.960> helps<00:02:50.200> a<00:02:50.290> lot<00:02:50.440> I<00:02:50.740> use<00:02:51.190> the<00:02:51.340> synthesis

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
really helps a lot I use the synthesis

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.970 
really helps a lot I use the synthesis
right<00:02:52.300> here<00:02:52.630> and<00:02:52.810> we're<00:02:53.470> going<00:02:53.590> to<00:02:53.650> kill<00:02:53.860> them

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
right here and we're going to kill them

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.920 
right here and we're going to kill them
now<00:02:54.040> at<00:02:54.370> this<00:02:54.520> time<00:02:54.580> I<00:02:55.030> would<00:02:55.120> have<00:02:55.480> survived

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
now at this time I would have survived

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.650 
now at this time I would have survived
but<00:02:56.710> i<00:02:56.770> decided<00:02:57.250> to<00:02:57.490> Rocky<00:02:57.730> myself<00:02:58.240> right<00:02:58.510> when

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
but i decided to Rocky myself right when

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.000 
but i decided to Rocky myself right when

the bubble spawned as you'll see in just

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.460 
the bubble spawned as you'll see in just
a<00:03:00.220> couple<00:03:00.310> seconds<00:03:00.850> but<00:03:01.600> that's<00:03:01.840> okay<00:03:02.110> the
