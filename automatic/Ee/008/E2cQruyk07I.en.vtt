 just like you had a difficult week 

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:25.789
 I'm made by what I got to see 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:29.889
 a little bit because of the panic face that the 

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:33.590
 final you forgot how little 

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:35.810
 ander is that you have all these types of 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:40.539
 I forget there is no one help, I really do not 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:40.539
 he warned at the end of the song that it happened 

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:47.360
 is that the olivic terminal appointment in the 

00:05:44.749 --> 00:05:53.050
 the problem was the face of 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:53.050
 fear that it's still good 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:06.249
 I have a lot of confidence in what you do 

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:08.649
 but a lot in you 

00:06:06.249 --> 00:06:12.339
 like to see you on stage and you make me 

00:06:08.649 --> 00:06:14.739
 the day but you can not trust that 

00:06:12.339 --> 00:06:18.479
 is that I'm going to give you a pull of your ears and 

00:06:14.739 --> 00:06:18.479
 you know what a jerk of the ears is 

00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:26.949
 a red for development 

00:06:20.529 --> 00:06:29.070
 alicia and has been the tiniest and 

00:06:26.949 --> 00:06:32.000
 work a lot 

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:32.000
 but I'm going to give 

00:06:37.569 --> 00:06:42.099
 what are you going to give him is still the health you are the 

00:06:40.929 --> 00:06:44.169
 where smaller can trust 

00:06:42.099 --> 00:06:46.360
 you have to keep throwing him lots of 

00:06:44.169 --> 00:06:47.600
 you want to listen to the teachers is 

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:51.070
 okay 

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:51.070
 and for ignoring 

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:59.460
 therefore it is acute is waiting 

00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:01.980
 of the final decision but you are something 

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:03.690
