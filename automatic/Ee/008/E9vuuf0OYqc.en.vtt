00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:24.280 
liner but i'm going to use kind of a

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:27.480 
liner but i'm going to use kind of a
nude<00:05:24.520> one<00:05:24.729> this<00:05:25.060> is<00:05:25.440> pale<00:05:26.440> pink<00:05:26.770> from<00:05:27.009> NYX<00:05:27.280> and

nude one this is pale pink from NYX and

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.580 
nude one this is pale pink from NYX and
the<00:05:28.030> reason<00:05:28.300> that<00:05:28.330> is<00:05:28.690> because<00:05:29.139> i'm<00:05:29.259> using<00:05:29.500> a

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:29.590 
the reason that is because i'm using a

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:31.740 
the reason that is because i'm using a
bright<00:05:29.889> pink<00:05:30.220> lipstick<00:05:30.759> and<00:05:31.000> I<00:05:31.330> don't<00:05:31.570> want

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:31.750 
bright pink lipstick and I don't want

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:35.399 
bright pink lipstick and I don't want
something<00:05:32.849> like<00:05:33.849> a<00:05:33.880> pink<00:05:34.330> lip<00:05:34.690> liner<00:05:34.930> to<00:05:35.229> take

00:05:35.399 --> 00:05:35.409 
something like a pink lip liner to take

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:37.469 
something like a pink lip liner to take
away<00:05:35.620> from<00:05:35.680> that<00:05:35.830> so<00:05:36.250> if<00:05:36.669> you<00:05:36.849> have<00:05:37.000> a<00:05:37.030> nude<00:05:37.300> one

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:37.479 
away from that so if you have a nude one

00:05:37.479 --> 00:05:39.540 
away from that so if you have a nude one
use<00:05:37.750> nude<00:05:38.050> I'm<00:05:38.680> just<00:05:38.770> going<00:05:38.949> to<00:05:38.979> use<00:05:39.159> a<00:05:39.190> very
