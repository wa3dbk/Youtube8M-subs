00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.599
 Hey 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:39.000
 the kia sportage is of course everything 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.940
 except a new lake but still 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.820
 turns out that car fits perfectly with 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:48.149
 the wishes of customers who are in this suv 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.820
 crossover segment search for a new car 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.329
 kia didn't have to be too busy 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.309
 to make 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.900
 as for the facelift of these 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:59.000
 car because this is one 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.180
 and then let me see what's new 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.180
 is on 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.409
 light seen well let me have one more 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:07.700
 see it once and then I'll tell you something there 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:10.400
 is new 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.920
 kia has a new grille on it 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.470
 put this car with a different structure 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.869
 and at the back we see 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.940
 rear lights that are the same in shape 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:23.380
 but those are different 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:26.840
 they are a bit redder and format 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.950
 in fact, that's what we call it in 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.320
 the interior 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.320
 some freer materials and better ones 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.390
 isolation of sounds 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.670
 All that will be, but he had that much 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.330
 need a car that sprayed something is that 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.890
 concerns 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.800
 such a strong statement at the time 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:45.770
 program with such a typical european 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.000
 design that for that matter that sport 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.460
 is still new 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.650
 as of yesterday 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.510
 technically there is still something new too 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:56.119
 report the two liters directly injected 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.229
 gti engine has slightly more power 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:59.090
 looked at 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:00.650
 that doesn't matter a lot either 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.530
 oddly enough in this time of 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:05.630
 downsizing and more efficient engines and 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.159
 interventions that makes and is frugal 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.270
 those two liters slightly less economical 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:10.610
 become 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.780
 you walk those two liters into practice 1 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.239
 at 11 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.310
 and if we compare that with some 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:18.890
 turbo dam lock engines 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.690
 that's very neat consumption 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.790
 only disappointing or of a bit 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.709
 Missing is precisely that flexibility 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.980
 which we naturally spoiled by all those 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:30.200
 Turbo engines know if you go up hill 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.209
 then switch back to van 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.230
 turbo engine and if the plenty of torque 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:34.940
 available 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.230
 that switching back is of course also possible 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:39.290
 with the six-speed box 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.840
 in this kia sportage per liter of GT 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:44.410
 he just has a little less 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.410
 power 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.700
 you supply kia die sports 2 liter tdi 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:10.280
 only in the middle of the more expensive ones 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:13.220
 equipment variants and that means that 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.290
 you least need them 33,000 euros 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:18.050
 to buy the car 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.160
 you go for the in the netherlands much more often 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:22.220
 chosen 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.570
 1.6 liter direct-injection engine than 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.730
 has that new one 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:30.320
 renewed kia sportage is already available 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:34.240
 from 24 1995 euros and what we think 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:34.240
 really just the better choice 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.970
 at van 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:57.700
 Yes
