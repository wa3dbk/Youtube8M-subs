00:01:58.169 --> 00:01:58.179 
here you type in echoes and I would

00:01:58.179 --> 00:02:01.469 
here you type in echoes and I would
space<00:01:58.390> it<00:01:58.539> up<00:01:58.630> by<00:01:58.750> like<00:01:58.929> three<00:01:59.789> so<00:02:00.789> echo<00:02:01.210> space

space it up by like three so echo space

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:09.059 
space it up by like three so echo space
pay<00:02:01.690> space<00:02:04.259> echo<00:02:05.259> space<00:02:05.740> pay<00:02:05.950> face<00:02:06.190> and<00:02:08.069> echo

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:14.340 
space pay space and as you can see that
is<00:02:13.300> how<00:02:13.450> you<00:02:13.510> would<00:02:13.690> add<00:02:13.810> it<00:02:13.959> you<00:02:14.019> would<00:02:14.140> paste

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
is how you would add it you would paste

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:16.229 
is how you would add it you would paste
it<00:02:14.560> for<00:02:14.950> you<00:02:15.069> would<00:02:15.220> copy<00:02:15.400> and<00:02:15.640> paste<00:02:15.819> it<00:02:16.000> first

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
it for you would copy and paste it first

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:18.830 
it for you would copy and paste it first
then<00:02:16.989> you<00:02:17.140> would<00:02:17.260> type<00:02:17.470> in<00:02:17.590> your<00:02:17.650> echoes<00:02:18.100> and

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
then you would type in your echoes and

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.199 
then you would type in your echoes and
then<00:02:19.840> it<00:02:20.230> would<00:02:20.500> appear<00:02:20.890> so<00:02:21.160> let<00:02:21.850> me<00:02:21.940> just<00:02:22.060> show

00:02:22.199 --> 00:02:22.209 
then it would appear so let me just show

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:26.490 
then it would appear so let me just show
you<00:02:22.239> guys<00:02:22.480> a<00:02:22.720> demonstration<00:02:23.680> for<00:02:24.430> this<00:02:25.500> @echo

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
you guys a demonstration for this @echo

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.520 
you guys a demonstration for this @echo
off<00:02:27.420> CLS<00:02:29.400> home<00:02:30.400> will<00:02:30.700> call<00:02:30.850> this<00:02:30.970> home<00:02:31.180> and

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
off CLS home will call this home and

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:37.920 
off CLS home will call this home and
then<00:02:32.579> pause<00:02:35.760> there<00:02:36.760> we<00:02:36.820> go<00:02:37.000> I'll<00:02:37.239> show<00:02:37.870> you

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
then pause there we go I'll show you

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.120 
then pause there we go I'll show you
guys<00:02:37.989> this<00:02:38.290> and<00:02:38.730> here<00:02:39.730> it<00:02:39.790> is<00:02:39.959> whoops<00:02:40.959> I<00:02:41.320> type

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
guys this and here it is whoops I type

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.370 
guys this and here it is whoops I type
that<00:02:42.160> in<00:02:42.340> wrong<00:02:42.750> what<00:02:43.750> did<00:02:43.840> I<00:02:43.930> do<00:02:43.989> wrong

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
that in wrong what did I do wrong

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:49.410 
that in wrong what did I do wrong
oh<00:02:45.720> yeah<00:02:47.609> it's<00:02:48.609> got<00:02:48.700> to<00:02:48.790> be<00:02:48.850> lower<00:02:49.060> case<00:02:49.269> I

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
oh yeah it's got to be lower case I

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:57.690 
oh yeah it's got to be lower case I
believe<00:02:50.790> pause<00:02:55.950> anyway<00:02:56.950> for<00:02:57.160> some<00:02:57.310> reason

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
believe pause anyway for some reason

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:04.500 
believe pause anyway for some reason
this<00:02:57.910> is<00:02:58.120> not<00:02:58.150> working<00:03:00.209> I<00:03:03.000> think<00:03:04.000> it's<00:03:04.209> because

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
this is not working I think it's because

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.030 
this is not working I think it's because
of<00:03:04.630> these<00:03:04.690> though<00:03:04.989> I'm<00:03:05.230> not<00:03:05.500> sure<00:03:05.560> but<00:03:05.950> I<00:03:06.010> think

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:06.040 
of these though I'm not sure but I think

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:11.220 
of these though I'm not sure but I think
it's<00:03:06.310> because<00:03:06.579> of<00:03:08.010> these<00:03:09.010> actual<00:03:10.230> things

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
it's because of these actual things

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.099 
it's because of these actual things
right<00:03:11.500> there<00:03:12.329> it's<00:03:13.329> not<00:03:13.450> going<00:03:13.570> to<00:03:13.630> talk<00:03:14.079> about

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:14.109 
right there it's not going to talk about

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:15.800 
right there it's not going to talk about
the<00:03:14.410> same<00:03:14.590> it's<00:03:14.950> gonna<00:03:15.070> look<00:03:15.220> different<00:03:15.280> and

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
the same it's gonna look different and

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:18.330 
the same it's gonna look different and
actually<00:03:16.810> that's<00:03:17.109> not<00:03:17.230> it<00:03:17.320> either<00:03:17.410> but<00:03:18.220> that's

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
actually that's not it either but that's

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:19.740 
actually that's not it either but that's
how<00:03:18.519> you<00:03:18.579> would<00:03:18.730> add<00:03:18.940> it<00:03:19.209> I'm<00:03:19.359> sorry<00:03:19.630> I

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:19.750 
how you would add it I'm sorry I

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.170 
how you would add it I'm sorry I
couldn't<00:03:20.049> open<00:03:20.230> it<00:03:20.500> for<00:03:20.620> some<00:03:20.769> reason<00:03:21.180> unless

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
couldn't open it for some reason unless

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.190 
couldn't open it for some reason unless
I'm<00:03:22.510> being<00:03:22.540> a<00:03:22.989> retard<00:03:23.170> and<00:03:23.590> not<00:03:24.130> knowing<00:03:25.200> what

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
I'm being a retard and not knowing what

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:34.120 
I'm being a retard and not knowing what
to<00:03:26.230> do

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.130 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.410 

I<00:03:34.220> don't<00:03:34.910> know<00:03:35.060> why<00:03:35.390> it's<00:03:35.540> not<00:03:35.720> working<00:03:37.420> anyway

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
I don't know why it's not working anyway

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:39.850 
I don't know why it's not working anyway
that's<00:03:38.990> how<00:03:39.110> you<00:03:39.170> would<00:03:39.320> add<00:03:39.440> it<00:03:39.560> into<00:03:39.710> your

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
that's how you would add it into your

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:41.710 
that's how you would add it into your
batch<00:03:40.160> code<00:03:40.460> I'm<00:03:40.910> assuming<00:03:41.540> you<00:03:41.630> would

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
batch code I'm assuming you would

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.090 
batch code I'm assuming you would
already<00:03:41.870> have<00:03:42.020> one<00:03:42.410> so<00:03:42.440> that's<00:03:42.710> probably<00:03:42.920> why

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:43.100 
already have one so that's probably why

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.290 
already have one so that's probably why
it's<00:03:43.250> not<00:03:43.370> working<00:03:43.730> but<00:03:44.390> I<00:03:45.400> don't<00:03:46.400> know<00:03:46.460> but

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:47.300 
it's not working but I don't know but

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:48.760 
it's not working but I don't know but
that's<00:03:47.420> how<00:03:47.600> you<00:03:47.630> add<00:03:47.990> it<00:03:48.230> in<00:03:48.350> and<00:03:48.530> that's<00:03:48.620> how

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:48.770 
that's how you add it in and that's how

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:51.700 
that's how you add it in and that's how
you<00:03:48.860> get<00:03:49.070> the<00:03:49.220> ASCII<00:03:49.790> art<00:03:50.140> again<00:03:51.140> I'll<00:03:51.440> leave

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:51.710 
you get the ASCII art again I'll leave

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:53.200 
you get the ASCII art again I'll leave
this<00:03:51.800> in<00:03:51.920> the<00:03:52.010> ship<00:03:52.160> Shin<00:03:52.280> below<00:03:52.490> for<00:03:53.090> your
