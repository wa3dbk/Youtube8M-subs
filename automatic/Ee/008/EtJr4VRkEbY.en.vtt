actually<00:00:15.450> started<00:00:15.990> with<00:00:16.440> the<00:00:16.560> professor<00:00:16.980> here

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
actually started with the professor here

actually started with the professor here
at<00:00:17.220> UBC<00:00:17.490> saying<00:00:17.910> let's<00:00:18.630> get<00:00:18.779> away<00:00:18.930> from<00:00:18.990> this

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
at UBC saying let's get away from this

at UBC saying let's get away from this
idea<00:00:19.380> of<00:00:19.590> these<00:00:19.980> static<00:00:20.490> robots<00:00:20.880> like<00:00:21.359> you

idea of these static robots like you
know<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:21.720> chess<00:00:21.900> playing<00:00:22.199> robots<00:00:22.529> and<00:00:22.619> the

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
know the chess playing robots and the

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:23.900 
know the chess playing robots and the
ones<00:00:22.859> that<00:00:22.920> kind<00:00:23.130> of<00:00:23.220> see<00:00:23.400> everything<00:00:23.519> around

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
ones that kind of see everything around

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.060 
ones that kind of see everything around
them<00:00:24.150> they're<00:00:24.269> omniscient<00:00:24.779> beings<00:00:25.140> and<00:00:25.529> let's

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
them they're omniscient beings and let's

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.230 
them they're omniscient beings and let's
get<00:00:26.189> out<00:00:26.310> into<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:26.490> real<00:00:26.699> world<00:00:26.730> and<00:00:27.060> apply

overhead cameras on the field and they

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.260 
overhead cameras on the field and they
look<00:00:46.469> down<00:00:46.649> see<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.070> robot<00:00:47.309> send<00:00:47.879> that<00:00:48.030> to<00:00:48.180> our

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
look down see the robot send that to our

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.600 
look down see the robot send that to our
computer<00:00:48.719> it<00:00:49.020> finds<00:00:49.469> which<00:00:49.620> robot<00:00:50.010> is<00:00:50.160> closest

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
computer it finds which robot is closest

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.310 
computer it finds which robot is closest
to<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:50.969> ball<00:00:51.120> and<00:00:51.420> then<00:00:51.600> that<00:00:51.899> one<00:00:52.079> will

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
to the ball and then that one will

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.410 
to the ball and then that one will
either<00:00:52.620> defend<00:00:53.100> or<00:00:53.280> attack<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:53.879> then<00:00:54.270> the

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
either defend or attack and then the

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:55.790 
either defend or attack and then the
other<00:00:54.539> robots<00:00:54.899> will<00:00:55.110> adjust<00:00:55.469> their<00:00:55.680> positions

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
other robots will adjust their positions

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.770 
other robots will adjust their positions
accordingly<00:00:56.550> when<00:00:56.969> is<00:00:57.180> humans<00:00:57.570> playing

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
accordingly when is humans playing

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.810 
accordingly when is humans playing
soccer<00:00:58.020> it's<00:00:58.710> really<00:00:58.980> hard<00:00:59.160> for<00:00:59.309> us<00:00:59.370> we<00:00:59.640> don't

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
soccer it's really hard for us we don't

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:00.920 
soccer it's really hard for us we don't
know<00:00:59.910> what<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.120> others<00:01:00.300> are<00:01:00.449> thinking<00:01:00.570> even

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
know what the others are thinking even

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.240 
know what the others are thinking even
on<00:01:01.020> our<00:01:01.050> team<00:01:01.350> so<00:01:01.590> we<00:01:01.680> need<00:01:01.859> to<00:01:02.010> communicate

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
on our team so we need to communicate

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.130 
on our team so we need to communicate
with<00:01:02.670> each<00:01:02.789> other<00:01:03.000> it's<00:01:03.329> easy<00:01:03.539> for<00:01:03.750> a<00:01:03.809> computer

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
with each other it's easy for a computer

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.289 
with each other it's easy for a computer
and<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:04.500> split<00:01:04.739> second<00:01:05.159> to<00:01:05.220> switch<00:01:05.790> up<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.119> say

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
and a split second to switch up and say

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.520 
and a split second to switch up and say
well<00:01:06.510> actually<00:01:06.689> you'd<00:01:06.930> be<00:01:06.960> better<00:01:07.140> forward

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
well actually you'd be better forward

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:15.020 
well actually you'd be better forward
now<00:01:07.619> go<00:01:07.799> up<00:01:07.979> bring<00:01:08.310> this<00:01:08.430> one<00:01:08.610> back

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.400 

buddy<00:01:16.590> there<00:01:17.590> you<00:01:17.620> go

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:19.410 
buddy there you go

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.740 
buddy there you go
robust<00:01:20.410> break<00:01:21.270> there's<00:01:22.270> a<00:01:22.330> lot<00:01:22.450> of<00:01:22.570> running

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:22.750 
robust break there's a lot of running

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:24.180 
robust break there's a lot of running
off<00:01:22.840> the<00:01:22.870> field<00:01:22.990> pulling<00:01:23.470> them<00:01:23.590> off<00:01:23.710> putting<00:01:24.070> a

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.190 
off the field pulling them off putting a

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:25.740 
off the field pulling them off putting a
new<00:01:24.310> one<00:01:24.430> on<00:01:24.520> we<00:01:24.730> need<00:01:24.850> to<00:01:24.970> monitor<00:01:25.120> if<00:01:25.600> it

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750 
new one on we need to monitor if it

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.000 
new one on we need to monitor if it
thinks<00:01:25.930> it<00:01:26.110> has<00:01:26.200> the<00:01:26.350> ball<00:01:26.500> but<00:01:26.650> it<00:01:26.740> doesn't

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.010 
thinks it has the ball but it doesn't

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:28.290 
thinks it has the ball but it doesn't
actually<00:01:27.340> then<00:01:27.490> that's<00:01:27.640> the<00:01:27.760> problem<00:01:28.120> and<00:01:28.240> it

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:28.300 
actually then that's the problem and it

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.570 
actually then that's the problem and it
needs<00:01:28.360> to<00:01:28.630> be<00:01:28.720> taken<00:01:29.110> off<00:01:29.260> and<00:01:29.530> put<00:01:30.070> into<00:01:30.190> the

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:30.580 
needs to be taken off and put into the

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.630 
needs to be taken off and put into the
the<00:01:31.240> pit<00:01:31.480> various<00:01:32.130> components<00:01:33.130> came<00:01:33.310> in<00:01:33.460> late

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
the pit various components came in late

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.630 
the pit various components came in late
and<00:01:34.000> the<00:01:34.870> robots<00:01:35.200> were<00:01:35.410> built<00:01:35.650> later<00:01:36.370> this

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
and the robots were built later this

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.270 
and the robots were built later this
year<00:01:36.850> so<00:01:37.120> we<00:01:37.270> had<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:38.590> get<00:01:38.680> the<00:01:38.770> board's<00:01:39.100> ready

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
year so we had to get the board's ready

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.620 
year so we had to get the board's ready
later<00:01:39.550> and<00:01:39.820> then<00:01:39.940> we<00:01:40.000> had<00:01:40.120> to<00:01:40.210> write<00:01:40.330> the<00:01:40.450> code

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
later and then we had to write the code

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.270 
later and then we had to write the code
later<00:01:40.870> a<00:01:41.020> lot<00:01:41.230> still<00:01:41.530> needs<00:01:41.770> to<00:01:41.950> be<00:01:41.980> tuned

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
later a lot still needs to be tuned

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.010 
later a lot still needs to be tuned
before<00:01:42.670> we<00:01:42.760> go<00:01:42.880> to<00:01:42.940> Mexico<00:01:43.450> and<00:01:43.630> before<00:01:43.900> we

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
before we go to Mexico and before we
