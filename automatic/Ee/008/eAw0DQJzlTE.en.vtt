action<00:04:40.050> a<00:04:41.370> feeling<00:04:42.370> of<00:04:42.490> movement<00:04:43.440> which<00:04:44.440> is

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:44.740 
action a feeling of movement which is

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.760 
action a feeling of movement which is
what<00:04:44.950> you<00:04:45.130> want<00:04:45.400> for<00:04:45.820> for<00:04:46.750> fire<00:04:47.020> because<00:04:47.590> it's

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
what you want for for fire because it's

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.460 
what you want for for fire because it's
always<00:04:48.130> moving<00:04:48.450> this<00:04:49.450> gives<00:04:49.720> an<00:04:49.840> illusion<00:04:49.990> of

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:50.470 
always moving this gives an illusion of

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.010 
always moving this gives an illusion of
movement<00:04:51.000> and<00:04:52.000> I'm<00:04:52.180> just<00:04:52.390> coloring<00:04:52.720> in<00:04:52.930> the

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
movement and I'm just coloring in the

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.950 
movement and I'm just coloring in the
top<00:04:53.260> half<00:04:53.560> or<00:04:53.980> the<00:04:54.340> little<00:04:54.550> peeks<00:04:55.390> of<00:04:55.690> the

top half or the little peeks of the

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:04.950 
top half or the little peeks of the
flames<00:04:56.260> with<00:04:57.250> orange

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:09.190 

gives<00:05:05.960> it<00:05:06.110> the<00:05:06.230> illusion<00:05:06.530> of<00:05:08.200> changing

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:09.200 
gives it the illusion of changing

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:13.090 
gives it the illusion of changing
temperatures<00:05:10.540> the<00:05:11.540> next<00:05:11.570> color<00:05:12.080> is<00:05:12.410> this

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:13.100 
temperatures the next color is this

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:18.850 
temperatures the next color is this
bright<00:05:14.060> yellow<00:05:14.840> color<00:05:15.020> and<00:05:17.320> it<00:05:18.320> actually

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 
bright yellow color and it actually

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.770 
bright yellow color and it actually
looks<00:05:19.220> more<00:05:19.400> like<00:05:19.460> a<00:05:19.580> highlighter<00:05:20.150> because<00:05:20.600> it

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:20.780 
looks more like a highlighter because it

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:25.450 
looks more like a highlighter because it
is<00:05:20.930> a<00:05:21.140> neon<00:05:21.650> yellow<00:05:22.390> and<00:05:23.440> I<00:05:24.440> really<00:05:24.830> liked<00:05:25.100> it<00:05:25.310> I

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:25.460 
is a neon yellow and I really liked it I

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:27.310 
is a neon yellow and I really liked it I
prefer<00:05:25.820> it<00:05:25.940> over<00:05:26.000> the<00:05:26.270> regular<00:05:26.630> yellow<00:05:26.810> is<00:05:27.110> the

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:27.320 
prefer it over the regular yellow is the

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.260 
prefer it over the regular yellow is the
hottest<00:05:27.740> color<00:05:28.040> because<00:05:28.460> it<00:05:28.580> is<00:05:28.700> just<00:05:28.970> so

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:29.270 
hottest color because it is just so

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:32.340 
hottest color because it is just so
bright<00:05:29.600> it<00:05:30.200> does<00:05:30.590> give<00:05:30.920> the<00:05:31.070> illusion<00:05:31.430> of

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:32.350 
bright it does give the illusion of

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:35.920 
bright it does give the illusion of
emitting<00:05:33.350> light<00:05:33.880> which<00:05:34.880> is<00:05:35.000> exactly<00:05:35.420> what<00:05:35.750> I'm

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:35.930 
emitting light which is exactly what I'm

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:39.070 
emitting light which is exactly what I'm
going<00:05:36.770> for<00:05:36.800> with<00:05:37.190> this<00:05:37.340> picture<00:05:37.760> plus<00:05:38.510> it<00:05:39.050> just

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:39.080 
going for with this picture plus it just

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:40.780 
going for with this picture plus it just
looks<00:05:39.440> so<00:05:39.620> good<00:05:39.860> right<00:05:40.040> against<00:05:40.280> that<00:05:40.460> pink

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:40.790 
looks so good right against that pink

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:44.590 
looks so good right against that pink
and<00:05:41.090> with<00:05:42.080> that<00:05:42.230> orange<00:05:43.270> really<00:05:44.270> really

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:44.600 
and with that orange really really

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:47.800 
and with that orange really really
bright<00:05:45.280> next<00:05:46.280> I've<00:05:46.370> got<00:05:46.400> this<00:05:46.700> golden<00:05:47.660> yellow

00:05:47.800 --> 00:05:47.810 
bright next I've got this golden yellow

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:49.360 
bright next I've got this golden yellow
color<00:05:47.960> and<00:05:48.290> I'm<00:05:48.560> going<00:05:48.590> to<00:05:48.770> use<00:05:48.920> that<00:05:49.100> to<00:05:49.250> blend

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:49.370 
color and I'm going to use that to blend

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:55.630 
color and I'm going to use that to blend
the<00:05:49.610> orange<00:05:50.120> and<00:05:51.020> ah<00:05:52.750> and<00:05:53.750> also<00:05:53.920> the<00:05:54.920> the<00:05:55.370> neon

00:05:55.630 --> 00:05:55.640 
the orange and ah and also the the neon

00:05:55.640 --> 00:06:01.920 
the orange and ah and also the the neon
yellow<00:05:55.820> color<00:05:58.210> gives<00:05:59.210> a<00:05:59.300> nice<00:05:59.680> analogous

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:01.930 
yellow color gives a nice analogous

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:06.730 
yellow color gives a nice analogous
blend<00:06:03.520> and<00:06:04.520> where<00:06:04.700> my<00:06:04.790> other<00:06:04.970> videos<00:06:05.630> hard<00:06:06.530> to

00:06:06.730 --> 00:06:06.740 
blend and where my other videos hard to

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:08.590 
blend and where my other videos hard to
talk<00:06:06.920> about<00:06:07.070> harmonious<00:06:08.000> analogous

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:08.600 
talk about harmonious analogous

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:11.470 
talk about harmonious analogous
analogous<00:06:09.260> means<00:06:10.060> the<00:06:11.060> colors<00:06:11.330> are<00:06:11.420> right

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:11.480 
analogous means the colors are right

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:16.120 
analogous means the colors are right
next<00:06:11.630> to<00:06:11.780> each<00:06:11.900> other<00:06:12.820> so<00:06:13.820> um<00:06:14.890> what<00:06:15.890> I'm<00:06:15.980> going

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:16.130 
next to each other so um what I'm going

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:18.280 
next to each other so um what I'm going
to<00:06:16.160> do<00:06:16.280> next<00:06:16.460> is<00:06:16.760> I'm<00:06:16.940> going<00:06:16.970> to<00:06:17.090> take<00:06:17.300> a<00:06:17.480> red

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:18.290 
to do next is I'm going to take a red

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:21.940 
to do next is I'm going to take a red
and<00:06:19.240> to<00:06:20.240> tie<00:06:20.450> this<00:06:20.510> all<00:06:20.930> together<00:06:21.110> I'm<00:06:21.620> going

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:21.950 
and to tie this all together I'm going

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:24.840 
and to tie this all together I'm going
to<00:06:22.100> outline<00:06:22.250> a<00:06:22.490> little<00:06:22.760> bit<00:06:22.880> of<00:06:22.940> the<00:06:23.000> flames

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:24.850 
to outline a little bit of the flames

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:27.310 
to outline a little bit of the flames
not<00:06:25.850> too<00:06:26.090> much<00:06:26.330> because<00:06:26.480> Reds<00:06:26.840> are<00:06:27.020> really

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:27.320 
not too much because Reds are really

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:31.650 
not too much because Reds are really
bold<00:06:27.770> a<00:06:28.250> color<00:06:28.850> so<00:06:29.300> you<00:06:29.990> just<00:06:30.230> need<00:06:30.740> a<00:06:30.770> tiny<00:06:30.920> bit

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:31.660 
bold a color so you just need a tiny bit

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:37.810 
bold a color so you just need a tiny bit
to<00:06:32.660> convey<00:06:34.630> that<00:06:35.630> heat<00:06:36.580> there's<00:06:37.580> already<00:06:37.700> a

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:37.820 
to convey that heat there's already a

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:41.080 
to convey that heat there's already a
lot<00:06:38.030> of<00:06:38.150> warmth<00:06:38.540> in<00:06:38.690> this<00:06:38.810> picture<00:06:39.170> too<00:06:39.350> so<00:06:40.090> put

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:41.090 
lot of warmth in this picture too so put

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:44.130 
lot of warmth in this picture too so put
in<00:06:41.210> too<00:06:41.390> much<00:06:41.600> you<00:06:41.750> could<00:06:41.930> really<00:06:42.140> overdo<00:06:42.590> it

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:44.140 
in too much you could really overdo it

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:47.950 
in too much you could really overdo it
and<00:06:45.820> I'm<00:06:46.820> going<00:06:46.970> to<00:06:47.000> outline<00:06:47.300> the<00:06:47.480> edges<00:06:47.750> in<00:06:47.840> my

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:47.960 
and I'm going to outline the edges in my

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:50.320 
and I'm going to outline the edges in my
heart<00:06:48.200> with<00:06:48.530> the<00:06:48.650> red<00:06:48.890> just<00:06:49.460> right<00:06:49.790> on<00:06:49.940> top<00:06:50.150> of

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:50.330 
heart with the red just right on top of

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:53.950 
heart with the red just right on top of
that<00:06:50.420> magenta<00:06:50.750> I<00:06:52.420> think<00:06:53.420> that's<00:06:53.570> gonna<00:06:53.720> help

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:53.960 
that magenta I think that's gonna help

00:06:53.960 --> 00:07:01.110 
that magenta I think that's gonna help
it<00:06:54.290> um<00:06:56.050> look<00:06:57.050> even<00:06:57.320> more<00:06:57.500> dimensional

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:01.120 

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:05.020 

and<00:07:02.120> I'm<00:07:02.510> going<00:07:02.840> to<00:07:02.900> do<00:07:03.740> some<00:07:04.340> light<00:07:04.580> strokes

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:05.030 
and I'm going to do some light strokes

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:08.170 
and I'm going to do some light strokes
of<00:07:05.240> red<00:07:05.480> here<00:07:05.840> again<00:07:06.230> to<00:07:06.590> show<00:07:06.890> the<00:07:07.460> gradation

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:08.180 
of red here again to show the gradation

00:07:08.180 --> 00:07:11.400 
of red here again to show the gradation
of<00:07:08.270> color<00:07:08.330> just<00:07:09.140> like<00:07:09.260> I<00:07:09.410> did<00:07:09.620> with<00:07:09.830> the<00:07:10.160> other

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:11.410 
of color just like I did with the other

00:07:11.410 --> 00:07:17.590 
of color just like I did with the other
colors<00:07:12.410> here<00:07:14.500> so<00:07:15.940> I'm<00:07:16.940> pretty<00:07:17.210> happy<00:07:17.390> with
