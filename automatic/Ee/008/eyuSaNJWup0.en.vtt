 Tonami method crawl tips 

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:08.590
 Example of Takayasu player 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:19.980
 Crawling is the basis of swimming 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:21.570
 In this video, we will introduce four typical tips for crawling to swim well. 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.350
 I will 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.350
 me 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.189
 me 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:36.040
 This is how your child reads the crawl for the first time 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:36.040
 I often have sunk the lower half of the body 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:48.470
 Let's have an image that stretches the body consciously to be horizontal with the water surface so that the body does not warp 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.030
 I will not bend my knees 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:54.040

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:56.630
 The lower body sinks as the foot comes out of the water 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:01:00.290
 [musics] 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:03.659
 Taste is lightly in the crotch and one 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:06.399
 As the thumbs of both feet touch lightly 

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:10.590
 goo 

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:14.440
 The decrease is one foot 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.990
 N Oh 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:19.940
 So good 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:25.300
 The driving force of the glow Le is determined by the arm 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:33.630
 You can move forward more by turning your arms greatly 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:33.630
 You can make a big turn by opening your shoulders good when your arms turn back 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.470
 Hmm 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:44.890
 me 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:50.700
 People who stop breath in the water are surprisingly many 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:54.689
 With this, it will be painful gradually and can not swim a long distance 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:57.750
 The trick of breathing is to exhale in water 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:02:02.390
 Hmm from Hmmm long wear 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.390

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:20.310
 Let's synchronize the rotation of your arm and your breathing 

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:20.310
 Once you start turning your arm, turn to the side and breathe, let's put your face before the arm returns 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:26.190

 Stretch your body firmly and horizontally 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:38.230
 Yeah yeah 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:41.280
 Open the shoulder when the arm turns back 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:41.280
 Turn large 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:52.890
 Exert a breath from the nose in water in five of 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:55.049
 When you start turning your arm, turn to the side and put a face on your arm before it returns 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.730
 Good good 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:58.660
