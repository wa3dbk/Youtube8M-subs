like that have been chased off the

like that have been chased off the
islands<00:00:52.739> and<00:00:52.860> they<00:00:52.949> now<00:00:53.100> have<00:00:53.309> a<00:00:53.340> coordinate

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
islands and they now have a coordinate

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.600 
islands and they now have a coordinate
where<00:00:54.390> they<00:00:54.539> can't<00:00:54.809> take<00:00:55.110> cruise<00:00:56.039> liners<00:00:56.460> with

in about 60 miles of these islands as

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.170 
in about 60 miles of these islands as
this<00:00:59.190> wonder<00:00:59.460> if<00:00:59.550> he's<00:00:59.640> heard<00:00:59.820> anything<00:01:00.030> about

through<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.619> North<00:01:46.829> Pole<00:01:47.009> opening<00:01:47.460> it<00:01:48.329> looked

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
through the North Pole opening it looked

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.289 
through the North Pole opening it looked
like<00:01:48.600> a<00:01:48.780> smoky<00:01:49.530> color<00:01:50.280> so<00:01:50.790> that's<00:01:51.000> why<00:01:51.210> he

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
like a smoky color so that's why he

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:55.490 
like a smoky color so that's why he
called<00:01:51.570> it<00:01:51.810> the<00:01:52.049> smoky<00:01:52.470> God<00:01:52.680> in<00:01:52.950> his<00:01:53.579> book<00:01:54.500> but

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
every 12 hours a bright white side of it

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.539 
every 12 hours a bright white side of it
would<00:01:59.340> come<00:01:59.700> into<00:01:59.909> view<00:02:00.240> and<00:02:00.299> it<00:02:00.810> was<00:02:00.990> like<00:02:01.229> day

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.600 
has bright
tiny<00:02:14.069> holes<00:02:14.430> that<00:02:14.760> look<00:02:15.000> like<00:02:15.180> stars<00:02:15.240> at<00:02:15.930> night

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
tiny holes that look like stars at night

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.900 
tiny holes that look like stars at night
so<00:02:17.610> no<00:02:17.970> the<00:02:18.450> Sun<00:02:18.690> inside<00:02:19.560> ah<00:02:19.590> is<00:02:20.130> always

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
so no the Sun inside ah is always

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.930 
so no the Sun inside ah is always
visible<00:02:21.150> but<00:02:21.750> it<00:02:22.020> has<00:02:22.230> a<00:02:22.260> day<00:02:22.560> on<00:02:22.680> my<00:02:22.830> side<00:02:23.099> and

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
visible but it has a day on my side and

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.360 
visible but it has a day on my side and
since<00:02:24.300> it<00:02:24.480> turns<00:02:24.720> so<00:02:24.989> very<00:02:25.290> slowly<00:02:25.620> once<00:02:26.040> every

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
since it turns so very slowly once every

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.960 
since it turns so very slowly once every
seven<00:02:26.700> hundred<00:02:26.970> years<00:02:27.180> the<00:02:28.220> the<00:02:29.220> rotation<00:02:29.849> of

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
seven hundred years the the rotation of

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.000 
seven hundred years the the rotation of
the<00:02:30.090> shell<00:02:30.330> about<00:02:30.630> it<00:02:30.810> makes<00:02:31.020> the<00:02:31.260> the<00:02:31.650> effect

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
the shell about it makes the the effect

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.670 
the shell about it makes the the effect
of<00:02:32.250> day<00:02:32.430> and<00:02:32.580> night<00:02:32.870> well<00:02:33.870> Rodney<00:02:34.170> good<00:02:34.500> luck

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
of day and night well Rodney good luck

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.309 
of day and night well Rodney good luck
