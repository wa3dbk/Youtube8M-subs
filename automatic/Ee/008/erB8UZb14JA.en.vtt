the<00:01:00.840> K<00:01:01.289> bar<00:01:01.500> that<00:01:01.680> I<00:01:01.710> had<00:01:01.980> prior<00:01:02.430> to<00:01:02.460> this

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
the K bar that I had prior to this

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.850 
the K bar that I had prior to this
actually<00:01:03.960> broke<00:01:04.260> at<00:01:04.920> the<00:01:05.100> hilt<00:01:06.380> the<00:01:07.380> we<00:01:07.740> had

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
actually broke at the hilt the we had

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.340 
actually broke at the hilt the we had
them<00:01:07.979> for<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.030> k<00:01:09.180> bar<00:01:09.390> there's<00:01:09.750> a<00:01:09.840> blade<00:01:10.049> and

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
them for the k bar there's a blade and

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.440 
them for the k bar there's a blade and
then<00:01:10.860> at<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.100> hilt<00:01:11.250> it<00:01:11.400> tapered<00:01:11.850> down<00:01:12.090> into<00:01:12.390> a

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
then at the hilt it tapered down into a

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.390 
then at the hilt it tapered down into a
single<00:01:12.750> shaft<00:01:12.990> to<00:01:13.229> extend<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:13.979> length<00:01:14.159> of<00:01:14.340> the

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
single shaft to extend the length of the

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.140 
single shaft to extend the length of the
grip<00:01:14.810> and<00:01:15.810> it<00:01:16.439> just<00:01:16.619> wasn't<00:01:16.920> strong<00:01:16.979> enough<00:01:17.150> we

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
grip and it just wasn't strong enough we

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.020 
grip and it just wasn't strong enough we
we<00:01:18.600> threw<00:01:18.869> our<00:01:19.020> knives<00:01:19.610> and<00:01:20.610> it<00:01:20.790> just<00:01:20.939> couldn't

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
we threw our knives and it just couldn't

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:27.609 
we threw our knives and it just couldn't
withstand<00:01:21.470> impact<00:01:22.470> with<00:01:22.650> a<00:01:22.680> target<00:01:25.520> this<00:01:26.520> one

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619 
withstand impact with a target this one

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:33.350 
withstand impact with a target this one
the<00:01:28.619> entire<00:01:29.009> grip<00:01:30.320> is<00:01:31.320> an<00:01:32.130> extension<00:01:32.700> of<00:01:32.970> the

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
the entire grip is an extension of the

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:33.859 
the entire grip is an extension of the
blade

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
blade

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.520 
blade
so<00:01:34.590> rather<00:01:34.950> than<00:01:35.100> tapering<00:01:35.520> down<00:01:36.229> this<00:01:37.229> whole

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
so rather than tapering down this whole

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.999 
so rather than tapering down this whole
width<00:01:37.829> is<00:01:40.670> the<00:01:42.200> the<00:01:43.200> extension<00:01:43.649> of<00:01:43.710> the<00:01:43.829> blade

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
width is the the extension of the blade

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:49.429 
width is the the extension of the blade
so<00:01:44.060> it's<00:01:45.060> a<00:01:45.439> incredibly<00:01:46.439> strong<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:47.840> I<00:01:48.840> wanted

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
so it's a incredibly strong and I wanted

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.760 
so it's a incredibly strong and I wanted
to<00:01:49.530> get<00:01:49.649> this<00:01:49.740> one<00:01:49.920> just<00:01:50.009> because<00:01:50.159> it<00:01:50.310> was

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
to get this one just because it was

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.620 
to get this one just because it was
smaller<00:01:52.770> than<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.909> K<00:01:54.090> bar<00:01:54.360> lighter<00:01:54.990> as<00:01:55.259> well

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 
smaller than the K bar lighter as well

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.410 
smaller than the K bar lighter as well
I've<00:01:57.630> thrown<00:01:57.960> this<00:01:58.340> quite<00:01:59.340> a<00:01:59.369> bit<00:01:59.460> and<00:01:59.850> I've

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
I've thrown this quite a bit and I've

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:07.670 
I've thrown this quite a bit and I've
used<00:02:00.689> it<00:02:00.869> in<00:02:02.360> the<00:02:03.360> field<00:02:03.619> extensively<00:02:04.619> and<00:02:06.649> the

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
used it in the field extensively and the

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:11.119 
used it in the field extensively and the
grips<00:02:08.429> that<00:02:08.759> it<00:02:09.450> came<00:02:09.660> with<00:02:09.770> came<00:02:10.770> with<00:02:10.920> two

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
grips that it came with came with two

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.330 
grips that it came with came with two
plastic<00:02:12.120> pieces

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
plastic pieces

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.400 
plastic pieces
that<00:02:13.519> were<00:02:13.730> bolted<00:02:14.209> and<00:02:14.360> glued<00:02:14.629> on<00:02:14.959> either

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410 
that were bolted and glued on either

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.880 
that were bolted and glued on either
side<00:02:15.709> and<00:02:16.010> it

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
side and it

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.820 
side and it
the<00:02:18.890> vibrations<00:02:19.610> actually<00:02:20.319> caused<00:02:21.319> the<00:02:21.620> glue

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
the vibrations actually caused the glue

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.410 
the vibrations actually caused the glue
to<00:02:22.360> separate<00:02:23.360> and<00:02:23.569> the<00:02:24.080> bolts<00:02:24.440> to<00:02:24.650> loosen<00:02:25.099> and

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
to separate and the bolts to loosen and

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.290 
to separate and the bolts to loosen and
it<00:02:26.420> required<00:02:26.810> a<00:02:27.170> keyed<00:02:27.950> allen<00:02:28.879> wrench<00:02:29.060> to

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
it required a keyed allen wrench to

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.660 
it required a keyed allen wrench to
tighten<00:02:29.989> up<00:02:30.230> which<00:02:30.890> I<00:02:31.900> disagree<00:02:32.900> with<00:02:33.200> that

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
tighten up which I disagree with that

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.240 
tighten up which I disagree with that
because<00:02:34.670> I<00:02:34.879> had<00:02:35.000> to<00:02:35.260> try<00:02:36.260> and<00:02:36.440> find<00:02:36.680> a<00:02:36.980> keyed

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
because I had to try and find a keyed

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.390 
because I had to try and find a keyed
allen<00:02:37.580> wrench<00:02:37.760> which<00:02:38.330> I<00:02:38.950> couldn't<00:02:39.950> find<00:02:40.220> one

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
allen wrench which I couldn't find one

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.750 
allen wrench which I couldn't find one
so<00:02:40.700> I<00:02:40.730> actually<00:02:41.230> ended<00:02:42.230> up<00:02:42.379> taking<00:02:43.340> the<00:02:43.489> grips

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
so I actually ended up taking the grips

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.160 
so I actually ended up taking the grips
off<00:02:43.940> and<00:02:44.470> making<00:02:45.470> a<00:02:45.620> custom<00:02:46.130> grip<00:02:46.750> that<00:02:47.750> worked

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
off and making a custom grip that worked

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.949 
off and making a custom grip that worked
for<00:02:49.010> me<00:02:49.480> what<00:02:50.480> I<00:02:50.510> did<00:02:50.780> is<00:02:50.930> I<00:02:51.110> took<00:02:51.650> 550<00:02:52.220> cord<00:02:52.400> and

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
for me what I did is I took 550 cord and

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:56.949 
for me what I did is I took 550 cord and
wrapped<00:02:53.959> it<00:02:54.250> like<00:02:55.250> this<00:02:55.489> going<00:02:56.299> one<00:02:56.540> way<00:02:56.569> and

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
wrapped it like this going one way and

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:58.360 
wrapped it like this going one way and
then<00:02:57.049> the<00:02:57.410> opposite<00:02:57.799> direction<00:02:57.860> going<00:02:58.250> the

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
then the opposite direction going the

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.880 
then the opposite direction going the
other<00:02:58.430> way<00:02:58.720> so<00:02:59.720> it's<00:02:59.840> kind<00:03:00.019> of<00:03:00.079> overlapped<00:03:00.560> in

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:00.890 
other way so it's kind of overlapped in

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.059 
other way so it's kind of overlapped in
an<00:03:01.280> X<00:03:01.549> type<00:03:02.450> pattern<00:03:02.840> and<00:03:03.019> then<00:03:03.500> I<00:03:03.530> wrap<00:03:03.799> that

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:04.069 
an X type pattern and then I wrap that

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:07.500 
an X type pattern and then I wrap that
with<00:03:04.250> electrical<00:03:04.670> tape<00:03:05.290> and<00:03:06.290> that<00:03:07.069> works

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
with electrical tape and that works

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.869 
with electrical tape and that works
really<00:03:08.510> good<00:03:08.720> for<00:03:08.930> me<00:03:09.430> you<00:03:10.430> know<00:03:10.519> everybody

00:03:10.869 --> 00:03:10.879 
really good for me you know everybody

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:13.330 
really good for me you know everybody
has<00:03:11.000> their<00:03:11.030> own<00:03:11.180> preferences<00:03:11.989> this<00:03:12.980> is<00:03:13.099> mine

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
has their own preferences this is mine

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:18.069 
has their own preferences this is mine
so<00:03:13.819> it<00:03:14.750> also<00:03:14.900> came<00:03:15.079> with<00:03:15.170> a<00:03:15.260> sheath<00:03:16.900> total<00:03:17.900> I

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:18.079 
so it also came with a sheath total I

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:20.020 
so it also came with a sheath total I
think<00:03:18.260> I<00:03:18.350> paid<00:03:18.530> eighty<00:03:19.400> five<00:03:19.700> to<00:03:20.000> ninety

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
think I paid eighty five to ninety

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.110 
think I paid eighty five to ninety
dollars<00:03:20.540> for<00:03:20.720> this<00:03:20.810> again<00:03:21.109> around<00:03:22.000> you<00:03:23.000> could

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:23.120 
dollars for this again around you could

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.379 
dollars for this again around you could
probably<00:03:23.239> get<00:03:23.450> a<00:03:23.480> better<00:03:23.630> price<00:03:23.900> online<00:03:24.170> but

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:25.389 
probably get a better price online but

00:03:25.389 --> 00:03:30.849 
probably get a better price online but
