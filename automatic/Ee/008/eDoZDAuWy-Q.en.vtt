sounds<00:02:10.790> a<00:02:10.820> little<00:02:10.910> bit<00:02:11.120> funny<00:02:12.130> out<00:02:13.130> of<00:02:13.310> context

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
sounds a little bit funny out of context

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.420 
sounds a little bit funny out of context
but<00:02:14.000> it<00:02:14.090> sounds<00:02:14.390> cool<00:02:14.450> in<00:02:14.870> the<00:02:15.020> riff<00:02:15.430> after

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
but it sounds cool in the riff after

but it sounds cool in the riff after
that<00:02:16.550> we<00:02:16.670> just<00:02:16.700> go<00:02:16.910> back<00:02:17.090> to<00:02:17.120> the<00:02:17.360> G<00:02:17.540> and<00:02:18.310> that's

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
that we just go back to the G and that's

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:31.729 
that we just go back to the G and that's
the<00:02:19.520> whole<00:02:19.640> riff

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:34.020 

the<00:02:32.739> main<00:02:32.950> chords<00:02:33.370> that<00:02:33.519> we're<00:02:33.640> playing<00:02:33.849> in

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
the main chords that we're playing in

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.860 
the main chords that we're playing in
this<00:02:34.180> are<00:02:34.330> really<00:02:34.480> a<00:02:34.720> minor<00:02:35.200> G<00:02:35.560> F<00:02:36.430> and<00:02:37.269> G<00:02:37.840> and

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
this are really a minor G F and G and

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:39.539 
this are really a minor G F and G and
they'd<00:02:38.110> be<00:02:38.290> the<00:02:38.409> chords<00:02:38.739> that<00:02:38.920> you'd<00:02:39.040> play<00:02:39.280> if

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
that chord sequence but there's one

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.580 
that chord sequence but there's one
other<00:02:48.370> little<00:02:48.610> bit<00:02:48.910> in<00:02:49.060> the<00:02:49.450> song<00:02:49.690> so<00:02:49.900> it's

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
other little bit in the song so it's

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.729 
other little bit in the song so it's
doing<00:02:50.860> the<00:02:50.980> riffs<00:02:51.250> a<00:02:51.549> lot<00:02:52.230> then<00:02:53.230> it<00:02:53.379> goes<00:02:53.560> into

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
doing the riffs a lot then it goes into

00:02:53.739 --> 00:03:01.350 
doing the riffs a lot then it goes into
F<00:02:54.150> G<00:02:55.150> a<00:02:55.720> minor<00:02:56.910> F<00:02:57.910> E<00:02:58.900> minor<00:02:59.290> a<00:02:59.709> Matador<00:03:00.489> fear<00:03:00.970> the

F G a minor F E minor a Matador fear the
reaper<00:03:04.379> so<00:03:05.379> it's<00:03:05.500> just<00:03:05.590> that<00:03:05.769> little<00:03:05.890> bit<00:03:06.190> that

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
reaper so it's just that little bit that

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:14.940 
reaper so it's just that little bit that

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
goes F G a minor 2 3 4 F e minor and

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.199 
goes F G a minor 2 3 4 F e minor and
then<00:03:15.129> back<00:03:15.340> into<00:03:15.519> the<00:03:15.609> a<00:03:15.700> minor<00:03:16.180> -<00:03:16.569> G<00:03:16.930> -<00:03:16.959> f<00:03:17.859> -

00:03:18.199 --> 00:03:18.209 
then back into the a minor - G - f -

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.670 
then back into the a minor - G - f -
it's<00:03:19.209> kind<00:03:19.450> of<00:03:19.569> strums<00:03:19.870> it<00:03:20.049> a<00:03:20.109> couple<00:03:20.290> of<00:03:20.440> times

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
it's kind of strums it a couple of times

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.240 
it's kind of strums it a couple of times
and<00:03:21.390> then<00:03:22.390> eventually<00:03:22.599> it<00:03:23.319> kind<00:03:23.650> of<00:03:23.799> morphs

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
and then eventually it kind of morphs

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:37.160 
and then eventually it kind of morphs
into<00:03:24.430> the<00:03:24.819> rim

picking I was not really sure to be

picking I was not really sure to be

the<00:03:49.360> tune<00:03:49.629> and<00:03:49.810> it's<00:03:50.379> quite<00:03:50.650> obvious<00:03:51.069> when<00:03:51.220> you

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:51.340 
the tune and it's quite obvious when you

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:52.680 
the tune and it's quite obvious when you
watch<00:03:51.489> some<00:03:51.700> films<00:03:52.000> that<00:03:52.120> he's<00:03:52.330> using

watch some films that he's using
alternate<00:03:53.080> picking<00:03:53.110> so<00:03:53.560> make<00:03:53.769> sure<00:03:53.799> that

00:03:54.059 --> 00:03:54.069 
alternate picking so make sure that

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:57.300 
alternate picking so make sure that
you're<00:03:54.370> going<00:03:54.580> down<00:03:55.330> up<00:03:55.690> down<00:03:56.170> up<00:03:56.470> down<00:03:57.010> up

there's<00:04:02.349> a<00:04:02.440> few<00:04:02.680> other<00:04:02.860> patterns<00:04:03.280> that<00:04:03.430> kind

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
there's a few other patterns that kind

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:05.280 
there's a few other patterns that kind
of<00:04:03.790> seem<00:04:04.000> a<00:04:04.030> little<00:04:04.239> bit<00:04:04.480> easier<00:04:04.750> at<00:04:04.870> first<00:04:05.110> but

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
of seem a little bit easier at first but

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:06.900 
of seem a little bit easier at first but
if<00:04:05.410> you<00:04:05.470> do<00:04:05.680> it<00:04:05.799> this<00:04:05.890> way<00:04:06.129> it<00:04:06.250> does<00:04:06.430> sound<00:04:06.459> just

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 
if you do it this way it does sound just

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.430 
if you do it this way it does sound just
like<00:04:07.000> the<00:04:07.209> record<00:04:07.540> and<00:04:07.750> if<00:04:08.079> you're<00:04:08.230> going<00:04:08.319> to

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 
like the record and if you're going to

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.020 
like the record and if you're going to
accidentally<00:04:08.950> hit<00:04:09.190> any<00:04:09.340> strings<00:04:09.730> at<00:04:09.849> least

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
accidentally hit any strings at least

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.339 
accidentally hit any strings at least
they'll<00:04:10.209> be<00:04:10.239> accidentally<00:04:11.019> the<00:04:11.140> right

00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:11.349 
they'll be accidentally the right

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:13.470 
they'll be accidentally the right
strings<00:04:11.739> you<00:04:11.860> know<00:04:11.890> so<00:04:12.640> I<00:04:12.670> like<00:04:13.150> the<00:04:13.269> same

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
strings you know so I like the same

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.089 
strings you know so I like the same
strings<00:04:13.780> that<00:04:13.900> he<00:04:14.049> might<00:04:14.260> accidentally<00:04:14.769> if<00:04:14.950> it

00:04:15.089 --> 00:04:15.099 
strings that he might accidentally if it

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:17.610 
strings that he might accidentally if it
on<00:04:15.250> the<00:04:15.370> record<00:04:15.810> when<00:04:16.810> it<00:04:16.840> comes<00:04:16.959> to<00:04:17.290> doing<00:04:17.440> the

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
on the record when it comes to doing the

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:20.690 
on the record when it comes to doing the
chord<00:04:17.919> part<00:04:18.250> you<00:04:18.940> can<00:04:19.090> either<00:04:19.269> kind<00:04:19.630> of<00:04:19.720> strum

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
chord part you can either kind of strum

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.159
