in this video what I want you guys to

my<00:00:32.640> gym<00:00:33.030> tried<00:00:33.510> to<00:00:33.750> disrupt<00:00:34.290> me<00:00:34.590> while<00:00:34.950> lifting

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
my gym tried to disrupt me while lifting

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.959 
my gym tried to disrupt me while lifting
and<00:00:35.899> I<00:00:36.899> think<00:00:37.469> this<00:00:37.620> is<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.920> best<00:00:38.340> way<00:00:38.610> you<00:00:38.640> can

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
and I think this is the best way you can

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.319 
and I think this is the best way you can
go<00:00:39.149> about<00:00:39.270> dealing<00:00:39.690> with<00:00:39.989> these<00:00:40.110> people<00:00:41.329> which

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
go about dealing with these people which

00:00:42.329 --> 00:01:26.100 
go about dealing with these people which
you<00:00:42.360> will<00:00:42.690> see<00:00:42.960> shortly

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.530 

so<00:01:27.110> there<00:01:27.260> you<00:01:27.290> see<00:01:27.590> I<00:01:28.119> was<00:01:29.119> apparently

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
so there you see I was apparently

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.320 
so there you see I was apparently
dropping<00:01:30.260> the<00:01:30.409> way<00:01:30.530> too<00:01:30.590> loudly<00:01:31.100> and<00:01:31.610> senior

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.330 
dropping the way too loudly and senior

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.440 
dropping the way too loudly and senior
citizens<00:01:32.869> go<00:01:33.140> to<00:01:33.200> this<00:01:33.440> gym<00:01:33.740> so<00:01:34.640> apparently<00:01:35.330> it

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
citizens go to this gym so apparently it

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.240 
citizens go to this gym so apparently it
has<00:01:35.600> to<00:01:35.750> be<00:01:35.840> treated<00:01:36.050> like<00:01:36.229> a<00:01:36.409> library<00:01:36.890> but

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
has to be treated like a library but

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.219 
has to be treated like a library but
thankfully<00:01:38.030> for<00:01:38.210> me<00:01:38.300> I<00:01:38.330> had<00:01:38.570> my<00:01:38.690> headphones<00:01:39.050> in

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:39.229 
thankfully for me I had my headphones in

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:42.180 
thankfully for me I had my headphones in
I<00:01:39.440> didn't<00:01:39.680> even<00:01:39.800> hear<00:01:40.040> her<00:01:40.220> and<00:01:40.930> the<00:01:41.930> guy

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:42.190 
I didn't even hear her and the guy

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.800 
I didn't even hear her and the guy
lifting<00:01:43.190> next<00:01:43.490> to<00:01:43.550> me<00:01:43.670> I<00:01:43.880> believe<00:01:44.420> he<00:01:44.630> had<00:01:44.720> an

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:44.810 
lifting next to me I believe he had an

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.290 
lifting next to me I believe he had an
NBC<00:01:45.409> shirt<00:01:45.649> on<00:01:45.860> seemed<00:01:46.550> like<00:01:46.700> a<00:01:46.729> really<00:01:47.090> chill

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:47.300 
NBC shirt on seemed like a really chill

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.830 
NBC shirt on seemed like a really chill
dude<00:01:47.600> and<00:01:48.050> he<00:01:48.229> took<00:01:48.440> over<00:01:48.619> for<00:01:48.950> me<00:01:49.100> he<00:01:49.340> said

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:49.840 
dude and he took over for me he said

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.499 
dude and he took over for me he said
then<00:01:50.840> go<00:01:50.869> to<00:01:51.140> another<00:01:51.470> gym<00:01:51.880> which<00:01:52.880> I<00:01:53.060> think
