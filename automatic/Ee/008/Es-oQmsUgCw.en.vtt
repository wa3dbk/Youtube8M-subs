00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:03.920
 Thirteenth May 2009 

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.900
 Audi AG has invited to the Annual General Meeting 

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:11.010
 Even in a tense economic situation CEO Rupert Stadler 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:12.739
 To offer shareholders 

00:00:12.739 --> 00:00:13.959
 anniversary 

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:16.959
 positive news 

00:00:17.909 --> 00:00:19.539
 Audi is currently developing 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:21.769
 much better than the overall market 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:25.999
 We know that we are Red White with significant overall markets too 

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:27.089
 have to fight 

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:30.549
 Nevertheless, we are currently against the trend and very positive 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:35.210
 In China, we still bring the first quarter 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:36.520
 leadership 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.630
 meanwhile even in Western Europe we have conquered our market leadership 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:41.480
 UNIFIL retail markets 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.930
 So the development is actually relatively good 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.729
 that the increase translates into market shares for specific numbers 

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:51.740
 CFO Axel Strotbek confidently 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:56.090
 Despite the difficult situation on the market, he is also able to do so in the first quarter of 2009 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.730
 report a positive result 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.079
 I am with the result 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:05.060
 For Olic in the first quarter of 2009 was quite satisfied with 63 million 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:09.200
 and the result is clearly positive 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.090
 Market and this though the markets are veritable worldwide 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.520
 Collapsed significantly below the previous year and Audi overall clear 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.610
 better able to hold Allstate's overall markets worldwide 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.570
 the company is looking ahead 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.140
 an indication of this is the training offensive which the Audi AG 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:28.780
 this year starts 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.780
 Personnel Director Werner Widuckel says why 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.900
 located on a photo Preuss training very much value 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.300
 a solid skilled worker training 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.260
 the best basis for the high quality of our products 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:47.020
 At the beginning of 2009, capacity is set to increase by 40 percent 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:48.650
 too good investment 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.760
 we are now becoming a hundred-year one-time this capacity for another 100 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:53.600
 increase 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:54.650
 because we 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:57.960
 in it simply a very important contribution Â»see the future of 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.910
