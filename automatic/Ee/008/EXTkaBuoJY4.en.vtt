okay<00:00:01.170> so<00:00:01.230> now<00:00:01.800> I<00:00:01.829> think<00:00:02.100> it's<00:00:02.370> time<00:00:02.520> to<00:00:02.850> do<00:00:03.000> a

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.030 
okay so now I think it's time to do a

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.530 
okay so now I think it's time to do a
few<00:00:03.419> prankster<00:00:04.140> comets<00:00:04.879> the<00:00:05.879> first<00:00:06.210> one<00:00:06.509> is

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
few prankster comets the first one is

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.089 
few prankster comets the first one is
here<00:00:06.870> in<00:00:07.020> cloudy<00:00:07.379> court<00:00:07.859> galaxy<00:00:09.200> and<00:00:10.200> I

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
here in cloudy court galaxy and I

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:14.680 
here in cloudy court galaxy and I
believe<00:00:11.400> this<00:00:11.580> is<00:00:11.820> a<00:00:11.849> cosmic<00:00:12.330> clone<00:00:12.990> talent

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:14.690 
believe this is a cosmic clone talent

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:25.880 
believe this is a cosmic clone talent
entitled<00:00:15.690> the<00:00:15.929> shadow<00:00:16.350> lining

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.800 

right<00:00:26.550> off<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:26.730> bat<00:00:27.029> you<00:00:27.240> can<00:00:27.390> see<00:00:27.570> we<00:00:27.779> have

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
right off the bat you can see we have

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.050 
right off the bat you can see we have
these<00:00:28.170> platforms<00:00:28.619> which<00:00:29.310> are<00:00:29.490> just<00:00:29.670> floating

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
these platforms which are just floating

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.500 
these platforms which are just floating
around<00:00:30.330> in<00:00:30.720> outer<00:00:31.020> space<00:00:32.270> these<00:00:33.270> are<00:00:33.420> the

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
around in outer space these are the

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.569 
around in outer space these are the
platforms<00:00:34.140> that<00:00:34.260> show<00:00:34.680> up<00:00:34.890> when<00:00:35.340> you<00:00:35.370> get

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
platforms that show up when you get

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.430 
platforms that show up when you get
close<00:00:35.850> to<00:00:36.059> them<00:00:37.730> for<00:00:38.730> example<00:00:39.210> say<00:00:40.079> I'm

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
close to them for example say I'm

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.130 
close to them for example say I'm
walking<00:00:40.980> forward<00:00:41.510> those<00:00:42.510> two<00:00:42.809> platforms

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
walking forward those two platforms

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.819 
walking forward those two platforms
there<00:00:43.680> they<00:00:44.550> appear<00:00:45.059> when<00:00:45.960> I'm<00:00:46.079> not<00:00:46.290> close<00:00:46.620> to

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
there they appear when I'm not close to

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.720 
there they appear when I'm not close to
them<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.640> two<00:00:47.820> platforms<00:00:48.120> don't<00:00:48.750> appear

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
them the two platforms don't appear

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.860 
them the two platforms don't appear
you'll<00:00:50.730> just<00:00:50.940> walk<00:00:51.150> from<00:00:51.390> platform<00:00:51.780> to

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
you'll just walk from platform to

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.319 
you'll just walk from platform to
platform<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.800> platforms<00:00:53.489> will<00:00:53.699> appear<00:00:54.089> as

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
platform the platforms will appear as

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.920 
platform the platforms will appear as
you<00:00:54.540> get<00:00:54.690> close<00:00:54.900> to<00:00:54.930> them<00:00:55.489> and<00:00:56.629> now<00:00:57.629> we<00:00:57.690> have

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
you get close to them and now we have

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.170 
you get close to them and now we have
some<00:00:58.260> cosmic<00:00:58.859> clones<00:00:59.219> which<00:00:59.699> are<00:00:59.879> chasing

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
some cosmic clones which are chasing

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.979 
some cosmic clones which are chasing
Mario<00:01:01.579> they<00:01:02.579> follow<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.120> path<00:01:03.329> that<00:01:03.359> Mario

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
Mario they follow the path that Mario

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.260 
Mario they follow the path that Mario
takes<00:01:04.410> exactly<00:01:06.710> so<00:01:07.710> say<00:01:08.070> Mario<00:01:08.580> walk<00:01:08.850> slowly

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
takes exactly so say Mario walk slowly

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.440 
takes exactly so say Mario walk slowly
the<00:01:09.810> clones<00:01:10.080> will<00:01:10.320> walk<00:01:10.530> slowly<00:01:11.000> say<00:01:12.000> Mario

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
the clones will walk slowly say Mario

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.950 
the clones will walk slowly say Mario
jumps<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:13.560> clones<00:01:13.890> will<00:01:14.310> jump<00:01:14.640> say<00:01:15.509> Mario

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
jumps the clones will jump say Mario

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.230 
jumps the clones will jump say Mario

platforms<00:01:40.399> let's<00:01:41.399> go<00:01:41.729> up<00:01:41.909> as<00:01:42.720> soon<00:01:43.049> as<00:01:43.200> you<00:01:43.320> get

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
platforms let's go up as soon as you get

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.120 
platforms let's go up as soon as you get
close<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:43.920> them<00:01:44.960> just<00:01:45.960> run<00:01:46.350> through<00:01:46.619> this<00:01:46.770> area

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
close to them just run through this area

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.200 
close to them just run through this area
as<00:01:47.399> quickly<00:01:47.880> as<00:01:48.119> you<00:01:48.240> can<00:01:49.460> you<00:01:50.460> can<00:01:50.640> also<00:01:50.790> run

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
as quickly as you can you can also run

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.510 
as quickly as you can you can also run
slowly<00:01:51.659> just<00:01:52.619> make<00:01:52.770> sure<00:01:52.799> you<00:01:52.950> run<00:01:53.280> at<00:01:53.490> a

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
slowly just make sure you run at a

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.220 
slowly just make sure you run at a
consistent<00:01:54.119> speed

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:55.230 
consistent speed

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:57.830 
consistent speed
that<00:01:55.950> way<00:01:56.160> the<00:01:56.400> shadow<00:01:56.820> clones<00:01:57.270> which<00:01:57.660> are

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
that way the shadow clones which are

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.510 
that way the shadow clones which are
behind<00:01:58.110> you<00:01:58.350> won't<00:01:58.740> catch<00:01:58.950> up<00:02:00.350> and<00:02:01.350> here's<00:02:02.340> the

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
behind you won't catch up and here's the

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.090 
behind you won't catch up and here's the
last<00:02:02.730> leg<00:02:03.060> of<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.240> challenge<00:02:03.740> you<00:02:04.740> want<00:02:04.920> to

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
last leg of the challenge you want to

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.300 
last leg of the challenge you want to
spin<00:02:05.430> into<00:02:05.760> the<00:02:05.970> star<00:02:06.330> twice<00:02:06.890> before<00:02:07.890> the

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
spin into the star twice before the

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.040 
spin into the star twice before the
cosmic<00:02:08.790> cones<00:02:09.090> reach<00:02:09.570> Mario<00:02:11.210> so<00:02:12.210> overall<00:02:12.780> it's

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
cosmic cones reach Mario so overall it's

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.140 
cosmic cones reach Mario so overall it's
not<00:02:13.140> too<00:02:13.440> difficult<00:02:13.590> just<00:02:14.400> keep<00:02:14.610> moving<00:02:14.790> at<00:02:15.120> a

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
not too difficult just keep moving at a

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.300 
not too difficult just keep moving at a
steady<00:02:15.270> pace<00:02:15.570> and<00:02:16.140> you<00:02:16.650> shouldn't<00:02:16.980> have<00:02:17.160> to

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
steady pace and you shouldn't have to

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.360 
steady pace and you shouldn't have to
worry<00:02:17.460> about<00:02:17.700> the<00:02:18.060> clones
