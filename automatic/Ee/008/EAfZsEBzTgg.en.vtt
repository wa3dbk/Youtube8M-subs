00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:06.450
 go up.com the ski specialist and 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.309
 snowboarding on the internet hello and 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.230
 welcome to lensois.com I am arnaud 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.670
 confess our board today we're going 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.500
 talk about the different contests that 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.630
 exists on the snowboard market for 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.460
 enlighten you help you choose 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.439
 your board so we will start with 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.250
 the classic com I have seven boards in 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:25.019
 hand that alas loose to guide off it's 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.820
 a true true as classic 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.010
 there is not so rockers 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.619
 really from one end to the other the 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.180
 board and burglars it's the boards 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.200
 who have the most secure skirmishes 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.880
 they will be the best performers 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.550
 late a speed that in addition to 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.680
 support but it will also be the boards 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.629
 the least tolerant the least easy 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.450
 access for riders a little bit 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.079
 more beginners so then there is the 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.410
 how to reverse 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.329
 I took as an example the banache skate 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.370
 eliptec which is a board in pure 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.800
 reversed camber really banana it's 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:57.510
 the type of camber that is going to be the most 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.910
 so fun for beginners it's 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.859
 leave the boards the easiest 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.969
 that they are really going through all that 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.040
 offers a lot of versatility 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.630
 on the other hand for someone who goes 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.500
 really looking for the eighth a lot 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.630
 support etc 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.760
 it'll miss a little bit of clarification 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.439
 the flat camber we find a very good 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.549
 example at liesse with the public 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.930
 we'll see him a little bit in two 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.040
 versions we will see later in the 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.650
 breaststroke camps but here it is the 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.600
 true when their dishes rather intended to 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.600
 very free style boards really 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.909
 oriented jim even to have an easy 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.100
 on the rails something tolerant 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.090
 but at the same time that there is pop and that will 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.530
 to be a little permissive 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.890
 so that's really the camber 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.549
 rather destined jim freestyle the 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.920
 how to associate 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.079
 so there is a next multitude 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:44.759
 the brands following the programs we are going 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:46.799
 to see 4 really distinct that are 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.020
 on boards program a little 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.689
 different so to come back on a 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.899
 full camber in quotation marks this is a 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:57.210
 hybrid with machete at schirrhein 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.070
 which is a flat camber between the feet 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.829
 with a slight spatula rocker or any 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.659
 the area between the inserts is flat and 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:06.270
 just after we have a little rocker of 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.310
 each side the advantage of this campus and 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.009
 which will be the eighth but the 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.180
 versatility but also tolerance 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:12.780
 it will be a little easier to 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.370
 engaged 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.200
 and he's going to have a better exit in 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.150
 powder while really having a good 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.890
 support on snow then lasts 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.200
 small variation found on the 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.300
 basic piece which is one of the best 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.290
 references on this program there it is a 

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.780
 very good versatile 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.930
 so there between the feet we will have some 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:33.330
 camber up to both ends of 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.530
 inserts and after at the level of spatulas 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.959
 like a little rocker 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.000
 so we'll have support on snow 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:40.170
 lasts a very good grip one side 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.700
 very versatile since it's a 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.730
 board that goes very well in powder 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.320
 and fun side easy for freestyle 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.510
 or for the riders between more 

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.489
 intermediate so another variant 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.300
 we find on the nitro team so there 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:56.489
 it's a series a little special artists 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:59.069
 this one so she's even less 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.630
 inverted between the feet in classic on 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:03.209
 the feet and re inverted after so his 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.920
 kids a form of w it's a board 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.370
 who will be super tolerant super 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.530
 playful 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.540
 because he really has the swivel side 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:11.130
 easy and we found the 

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:12.810
 how to invert as on banana acp 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.280
 but against the two small areas 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:15.630
 kamp added underfoot 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.700
 will give a little more across 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.989
 a little more secure side for 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.090
 riders a little more confirmed that they're going 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:23.489
 look for a little over two tons us 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.610
 while having the very versatile side 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:28.620
 is super easy to account by pouring one 

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:30.320
 last form of how to associate one 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.090
 found on barracuda at burton 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:35.700
 who has a really cheap camber and 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.980
 freeride powder that will be declined 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.360
 differently according to the marks and 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.670
 models 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:43.680
 so it's a dead time caciques on 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:45.989
 the back of the board and a huge 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.299
 Rock on the spatula before interest 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:50.220
 it is to keep a coherence 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:53.070
 side supports control over hard snow 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.750
 thanks to this section of Cambrai and the 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:56.489
 oversized rocker standards on the 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.890
 front spatula to dislodge powder 

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:00.480
 to have a really buoyancy a 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.040
 child we will see the triple base 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.130
 technological is not really a 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.239
 camber it's a technology that is 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:08.579
 declined disk more vividly on 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:10.200
 battalion boards and lobsters that's in 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:12.690
 simply makes boards that do not 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.760
 are not flat they are in three 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.769
 dimensions at the level of the spatulas 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.660
 especially so that is to say that we have a little 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:20.340
 a flat area on the center of the 

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:22.590
 spatula and the board and slightly 

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:25.860
 concave it falls at the level of cards 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:28.530
 the main benefits it's going to be this 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:31.440
 side a very playful side at the level of 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.790
 spatulas we will have no bite at 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.139
 level of the map between the board that 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:36.180
 so called for freestyle or for the 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:38.010
 tolerant side for beginners 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:39.270
 well done and that's fine and then that 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:41.820
 will give a curved entry 

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:43.260
 progressive is very powerful so for 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:44.850
 the riders who really like the crooked 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:47.070
 and have support on hard snow it's 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:49.050
 really good here so we saw a 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:50.760
 little any camber technologies 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.130
 that exists on the snowboard market 

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:54.300
 I hope to have helped you 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.530
 maximum
