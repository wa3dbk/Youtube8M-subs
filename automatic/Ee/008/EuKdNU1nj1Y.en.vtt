00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
in the key of a and basically you're

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:28.660 
in the key of a and basically you're
going<00:01:21.979> from<00:01:22.640> the<00:01:23.150> first<00:01:23.479> board<00:01:23.900> which<00:01:24.619> is<00:01:24.740> a<00:01:26.110> 2d

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:28.670 
going from the first board which is a 2d

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:34.170 
going from the first board which is a 2d
back<00:01:29.390> down<00:01:29.600> to<00:01:29.630> a<00:01:29.780> and<00:01:30.580> then<00:01:31.580> e<00:01:32.320> then<00:01:33.320> back<00:01:33.560> to<00:01:33.710> a

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.180 
back down to a and then e then back to a

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.330 
back down to a and then e then back to a
but<00:01:35.180> what<00:01:35.330> I<00:01:35.360> like<00:01:35.600> about<00:01:35.810> the<00:01:36.710> rhythm<00:01:37.010> part<00:01:37.160> is

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
but what I like about the rhythm part is

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.010 
but what I like about the rhythm part is
that<00:01:37.550> it's<00:01:37.730> a<00:01:37.820> very<00:01:38.000> subtle<00:01:38.270> movement<00:01:38.420> between

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
that it's a very subtle movement between

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.100 
that it's a very subtle movement between
those<00:01:39.440> chords<00:01:40.270> you<00:01:41.270> kind<00:01:41.510> of<00:01:41.570> have<00:01:41.690> to<00:01:41.720> listen

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
those chords you kind of have to listen

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:43.840 
those chords you kind of have to listen
carefully<00:01:42.140> to<00:01:42.620> hear<00:01:42.830> how<00:01:42.980> they're<00:01:43.160> moving<00:01:43.370> but

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
carefully to hear how they're moving but

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.410 
carefully to hear how they're moving but
but<00:01:44.810> like<00:01:45.650> with<00:01:45.920> all<00:01:46.160> these<00:01:46.310> poly<00:01:46.640> rhythms<00:01:47.150> the

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
but like with all these poly rhythms the

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.980 
but like with all these poly rhythms the
patterns<00:01:48.400> are<00:01:49.400> independent<00:01:50.210> but<00:01:50.780> they

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:50.990 
patterns are independent but they

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.010 
patterns are independent but they
interlock<00:01:51.910> perfectly<00:01:52.910> and<00:01:53.210> this<00:01:53.720> is<00:01:53.840> what<00:01:53.990> I

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:54.020 
interlock perfectly and this is what I

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.990 
interlock perfectly and this is what I
like<00:01:54.200> about<00:01:54.350> super<00:01:54.800> smooth<00:01:55.070> music<00:01:55.610> is<00:01:55.790> that

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
like about super smooth music is that

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.380 
like about super smooth music is that
all<00:01:56.479> these<00:01:56.720> patterns<00:01:56.960> they<00:01:57.440> interlock<00:01:57.850> but<00:01:58.850> at

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
all these patterns they interlock but at

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.640 
all these patterns they interlock but at
the<00:01:59.510> same<00:01:59.690> time<00:02:00.050> you<00:02:00.830> do<00:02:02.170> sense<00:02:03.170> the<00:02:03.320> chord

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:03.650 
the same time you do sense the chord

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:10.120 
the same time you do sense the chord
movement<00:02:04.160> in<00:02:04.369> the<00:02:04.580> song<00:02:04.820> so<00:02:05.860> so<00:02:06.860> anyway<00:02:07.460> as<00:02:09.130> we

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
movement in the song so so anyway as we

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.190 
movement in the song so so anyway as we
start<00:02:10.459> here<00:02:10.820> and<00:02:10.970> basically<00:02:11.390> the<00:02:11.750> rhythm<00:02:12.050> I'm

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
start here and basically the rhythm I'm

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.710 
start here and basically the rhythm I'm
going<00:02:12.350> to<00:02:12.410> play<00:02:12.590> to<00:02:12.650> you<00:02:12.950> in<00:02:13.160> in<00:02:13.730> normal<00:02:14.480> time
