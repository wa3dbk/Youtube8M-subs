let's<00:00:08.120> Academy<00:00:08.570> today<00:00:09.530> we're<00:00:09.710> going<00:00:09.830> to<00:00:09.920> go

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:10.040 
let's Academy today we're going to go

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:16.430 
let's Academy today we're going to go
through<00:00:10.340> the<00:00:11.059> progression<00:00:11.240> sets<00:00:11.690> for

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.960 

basically<00:00:17.440> you've<00:00:17.650> seen<00:00:17.860> the<00:00:18.070> video<00:00:18.730> that<00:00:18.880> I

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:18.970 
basically you've seen the video that I

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.570 
basically you've seen the video that I
did<00:00:19.030> before<00:00:19.300> of<00:00:19.990> the<00:00:20.890> progression<00:00:21.430> of<00:00:21.490> steps

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:21.580 
did before of the progression of steps

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:22.410 
did before of the progression of steps
for<00:00:21.880> pull-up

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:22.420 
for pull-up

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.480 
for pull-up
so<00:00:23.050> now<00:00:23.230> that<00:00:23.680> you<00:00:23.860> should<00:00:24.040> have<00:00:24.160> got<00:00:24.340> that

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:24.490 
so now that you should have got that

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:27.929 
so now that you should have got that
done<00:00:24.730> the<00:00:25.689> next<00:00:25.930> bit<00:00:26.080> for<00:00:26.259> masseter<00:00:26.730> I'm<00:00:27.730> going

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:27.939 
done the next bit for masseter I'm going

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:35.130 
done the next bit for masseter I'm going
to<00:00:28.000> show<00:00:28.150> you<00:00:28.210> so<00:00:29.250> Rakesh<00:00:30.250> will<00:00:30.400> show<00:00:30.520> you<00:00:34.140> say

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:35.140 
to show you so Rakesh will show you say

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.340 
to show you so Rakesh will show you say
squares<00:00:35.530> hands<00:00:35.770> just<00:00:36.220> shoulder-width<00:00:36.700> apart

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
squares hands just shoulder-width apart

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.460 
squares hands just shoulder-width apart
now<00:00:38.430> from<00:00:39.430> here<00:00:39.730> we've<00:00:40.690> got<00:00:40.840> a<00:00:40.870> normal<00:00:41.050> pull<00:00:41.320> up

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:41.470 
now from here we've got a normal pull up

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.910 
now from here we've got a normal pull up
so<00:00:41.620> demonstrate<00:00:41.980> more<00:00:42.160> for<00:00:42.399> us<00:00:43.500> as<00:00:44.500> you<00:00:44.739> see

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:44.920 
so demonstrate more for us as you see

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.950 
so demonstrate more for us as you see
he's<00:00:45.070> bringing<00:00:45.399> his<00:00:45.520> head<00:00:45.730> right<00:00:46.149> above<00:00:46.450> the

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:46.960 
he's bringing his head right above the

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.990 
he's bringing his head right above the
bar<00:00:47.170> now<00:00:48.070> for<00:00:48.280> the<00:00:48.340> muscle<00:00:48.670> up

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.000 
bar now for the muscle up

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.330 
bar now for the muscle up
it's<00:00:49.420> about<00:00:49.720> carrying<00:00:50.560> woman<00:00:50.920> and<00:00:51.010> your

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:51.340 
it's about carrying woman and your

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.970 
it's about carrying woman and your
momentum<00:00:51.820> up<00:00:52.030> past<00:00:52.780> there<00:00:53.050> so<00:00:53.590> now<00:00:53.710> if<00:00:53.800> you<00:00:53.890> do

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:53.980 
momentum up past there so now if you do

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.510 
momentum up past there so now if you do
have<00:00:54.070> power<00:00:54.220> pull<00:00:54.490> up<00:00:55.830> see<00:00:56.830> the<00:00:56.950> speed<00:00:57.250> at

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:57.520 
have power pull up see the speed at

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.400 
have power pull up see the speed at
which<00:00:57.550> she's<00:00:57.910> coming<00:00:58.240> up<00:00:58.360> for<00:00:58.750> the<00:00:58.810> pull<00:00:58.990> up<00:00:59.140> a

00:00:59.400 --> 00:00:59.410 
which she's coming up for the pull up a

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.189 
which she's coming up for the pull up a
lot<00:01:00.130> faster

00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:02.199 
lot faster

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:04.799 
lot faster
so<00:01:02.800> now<00:01:02.980> he's<00:01:03.190> getting<00:01:03.489> to<00:01:03.579> that<00:01:03.670> point<00:01:03.969> where

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:04.809 
so now he's getting to that point where

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:07.499 
so now he's getting to that point where
the<00:01:05.770> flick<00:01:06.040> of<00:01:06.220> the<00:01:06.250> wrist<00:01:06.580> is<00:01:07.030> what<00:01:07.240> will<00:01:07.360> get

00:01:07.499 --> 00:01:07.509 
the flick of the wrist is what will get

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:12.120 
the flick of the wrist is what will get
him<00:01:07.720> above<00:01:07.960> the<00:01:08.110> bar

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.130 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.780 

now<00:01:12.850> if<00:01:12.970> we<00:01:13.090> combine<00:01:13.299> that<00:01:13.689> with<00:01:14.700> kind<00:01:15.700> of

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:15.790 
now if we combine that with kind of

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:17.940 
now if we combine that with kind of
increasing<00:01:16.330> the<00:01:16.390> momentum<00:01:16.869> so<00:01:17.500> this<00:01:17.680> is<00:01:17.799> where

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
increasing the momentum so this is where

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:20.430 
increasing the momentum so this is where
you<00:01:18.070> want<00:01:18.250> to<00:01:18.340> imagine<00:01:18.670> that<00:01:19.200> if<00:01:20.200> you<00:01:20.320> imagine

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:20.440 
you want to imagine that if you imagine

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.640 
you want to imagine that if you imagine
that<00:01:20.619> your<00:01:20.830> feet<00:01:21.070> up<00:01:21.190> in<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:23.170> your<00:01:23.290> arms<00:01:23.590> are

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:23.650 
that your feet up in and your arms are

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:36.520 
that your feet up in and your arms are
pinned<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.970> only<00:01:25.270> movement<00:01:25.509> that<00:01:25.840> you've<00:01:25.990> got

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:36.530 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.340 

that<00:01:38.060> is<00:01:39.060> what<00:01:39.300> will<00:01:39.479> allow<00:01:39.570> you<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:39.930> kick

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
that is what will allow you to kick

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:43.250 
that is what will allow you to kick
yourself<00:01:40.530> up<00:01:41.010> that<00:01:41.250> little<00:01:41.760> bit<00:01:42.000> more<00:01:42.260> along

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:43.260 
yourself up that little bit more along

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.050 
yourself up that little bit more along
with<00:01:43.440> the<00:01:43.530> power<00:01:43.740> pull<00:01:44.010> up<00:01:44.159> to<00:01:44.580> then<00:01:44.729> flick

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
with the power pull up to then flick

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.350 
with the power pull up to then flick
over<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.479> bottom<00:01:46.460> right<00:01:47.460> so<00:01:47.729> I<00:01:47.820> demonstrate

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
over the bottom right so I demonstrate

00:01:48.360 --> 00:02:12.300 
over the bottom right so I demonstrate
now

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.590 

okay<00:02:12.880> so<00:02:13.590> step<00:02:14.590> one<00:02:15.150> once<00:02:16.150> you've<00:02:16.270> got<00:02:16.360> to<00:02:16.450> pull

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:16.600 
okay so step one once you've got to pull

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.330 
okay so step one once you've got to pull
up<00:02:16.630> so<00:02:17.080> watch<00:02:17.260> it<00:02:17.290> on<00:02:17.440> video<00:02:17.650> game<00:02:17.980> pull-ups

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
up so watch it on video game pull-ups

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.990 
up so watch it on video game pull-ups
down<00:02:19.440> and<00:02:20.440> get<00:02:20.620> the<00:02:20.709> power<00:02:20.860> pull-up<00:02:21.250> you<00:02:21.790> want

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000 
down and get the power pull-up you want

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.150 
down and get the power pull-up you want
a<00:02:22.090> bar<00:02:22.300> coming<00:02:23.110> as<00:02:23.400> fast<00:02:24.400> start<00:02:24.850> down<00:02:25.030> your

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
a bar coming as fast start down your

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.500 
a bar coming as fast start down your
your<00:02:27.160> abs<00:02:27.370> as<00:02:27.550> possible<00:02:27.910> so<00:02:28.000> you<00:02:28.120> really<00:02:28.360> want

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510 
your abs as possible so you really want

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:30.809 
your abs as possible so you really want
to<00:02:28.569> be<00:02:28.630> bringing<00:02:28.780> out<00:02:29.020> today<00:02:29.340> so<00:02:30.340> head<00:02:30.580> right

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:30.819 
to be bringing out today so head right

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:34.590 
to be bringing out today so head right
over<00:02:30.940> the<00:02:31.209> bar<00:02:31.530> explosive<00:02:32.530> power<00:02:33.360> then<00:02:34.360> get

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
over the bar explosive power then get

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.670 
over the bar explosive power then get
the<00:02:34.720> momentum<00:02:35.430> and<00:02:36.430> then<00:02:37.270> combine<00:02:37.630> the<00:02:37.780> two<00:02:37.989> -

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
the momentum and then combine the two -

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.830 
the momentum and then combine the two -
then<00:02:38.830> flick<00:02:39.130> your<00:02:39.310> wrist<00:02:39.550> over<00:02:39.970> the<00:02:40.060> bar<00:02:40.270> and

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
then flick your wrist over the bar and

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:43.890 
then flick your wrist over the bar and
then<00:02:41.440> it's<00:02:41.590> a<00:02:41.680> normal<00:02:42.130> dip<00:02:42.660> so<00:02:43.660> the<00:02:43.780> other

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
then it's a normal dip so the other

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.500 
then it's a normal dip so the other
thing<00:02:44.110> you<00:02:44.140> can<00:02:44.410> do<00:02:44.560> system<00:02:45.430> is<00:02:45.970> to<00:02:46.150> work<00:02:46.180> on

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
thing you can do system is to work on

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.670 
thing you can do system is to work on
your<00:02:46.570> triceps<00:02:48.900> dips<00:02:49.900> on<00:02:50.110> the<00:02:50.200> pot<00:02:50.380> on<00:02:50.530> the

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
your triceps dips on the pot on the

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:57.730 
your triceps dips on the pot on the
bench

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:57.740 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:00.230 

school<00:02:57.980> mood<00:02:58.160> it's<00:02:58.310> like<00:02:58.430> this

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
school mood it's like this

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.360 
school mood it's like this
more<00:03:01.050> string<00:03:01.290> for<00:03:01.470> your<00:03:01.590> triceps<00:03:02.040> if<00:03:02.190> that's

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
more string for your triceps if that's

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.460 
more string for your triceps if that's
the<00:03:02.490> weak<00:03:02.640> area<00:03:03.030> to<00:03:03.870> be<00:03:03.990> able<00:03:04.050> to<00:03:04.230> get<00:03:04.380> that

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470
