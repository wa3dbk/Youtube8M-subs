00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:07.649
 hello my name is geneviÃ¨ve lenain and 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.320
 I am head chef and teacher of 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.900
 cooking for 22 years and original 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.730
 Vietnamese moreover I offer you 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.310
 teach you how to make a Cantonese rice 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.500
 also revisited to prepare rice 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.830
 Cantonese I chose to take a laugh 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.710
 red 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.840
 you will need two hours of 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.630
 cooked work that you find in super 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.800
 and hypermarkets and Chinese sausages 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.369
 you find in stores 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.500
 Chinese 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.320
 we will also need a little bit 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.390
 of peanut oil and a few scenes 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.940
 first step we will start with 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.010
 shrimp that will be cut in small 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.510
 pieces do not leave too small 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.710
 because if it's too small we feel 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.510
 not the piece of shrimp 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.600
 if the much more interesting than 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:52.500
 know little bits like that so 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:58.800
 the first step has ended here I'm them 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:01:00.030
 reserve and we'll go to and so in 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.750
 ultimately neither more nor less 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:07.409
 Omelette 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:10.080
 so I'm going to break but e 2 e here 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.450
 now I will beat energetically 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.280
 so now we're ready for the 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.130
 cooking first step we will do well 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.930
 heat your pan without fat 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.460
 Once again, the frying pan 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:22.200
 she is hot so it's not the 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.119
 trouble to put the now we put 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.070
 just above we notice that she 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.600
 is hot so here I am going to put a 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.460
 oil fillet 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.460
 so I see a little bit but they 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.869
 and here I go 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:42.200
 because to quickly flee the eyes over a strong fire 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:44.450
 just in front of the very slightly like 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.380
 those who watch and I add the 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:51.920
 sausages and shrimp stir a little 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:02:00.530
 I'm against it here a little bit 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:02:05.090
 of rice here is a pinch of salt and the 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:08.149
 day and we'll say that you have 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:12.019

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:13.940

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:15.560
