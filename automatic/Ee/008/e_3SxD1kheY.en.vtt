00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:13.519
 oh you we present as the au 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:20.430
 beyond all you the unknowable 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:27.570
 the unspeakable we do not know how 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:32.279
 to name you tell me that you are our father 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:36.000
 but it's a difficult word and one that has 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:38.239
 so far never managed to cross our 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.239
 the air 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.450
 of our father from here do not know how to laugh 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:54.580
 that absence or indifference or 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:57.250
 violence when he comes home drunk 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:01:00.550
 as usual and tears because 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:06.700
 we too because we do it 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:08.910
 does that trouble and the silence of the 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.910
 shame 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.320
 because before us as we 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.409
 he is without work good for nothing 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.409
 definitely that useful help 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.409
 irrecoverable 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:37.460
 tell us about your name which is love of 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:47.509
 your reign which is of love of your will 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:52.460
 who is to invite to love but where is 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:56.180
 love in our world of cops 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.530
 judge matons between his gray walls on 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:05.119
 a time of all suffering 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:11.140
 accumulated for centuries love is 

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:11.140
 absent and this is our only misfortune 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.780
 and when we present some 

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.060
 thing anyway because a friend 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:22.840
 we spun a cigarette that a visitor 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:26.610
 we smiled that the woman is in the parlor 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.610
 Saturday after Saturday 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:38.769
 our only happiness but still threatened 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:41.830
 always hurt always like a 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:43.690
 promise a crazy momentum all of a sudden the 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:46.540
 certainty of what we are for 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:50.130
 done in a flash in a shock at 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.130
 heart to cry 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.629
 and then the absence again 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:09.140
 and prison like a desert because in 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:09.140
 out of love there is nothing 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.750
 we are told to turn to you 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.790
 to ask for bread every day 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:29.599
 but we do not need you to 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:31.459
 that's the bread that's won at that flight 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:33.650
 besides, we do not lack bread 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:36.700
 to prisons we have too many 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.700
 throwing out the windows 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:51.079
 unless it is another 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:53.709
 paints the bread of the soul of the heart of the 

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:53.709
 presence 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:06.310
 but especially especially you ask us to 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:06.310
 forgive 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:13.550
 how do you want us to forgive 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:15.830
 alami who gave us to the cops or who 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:18.620
 took advantage of our absence to take 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:21.230
 our wife that we forgave to 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:26.930
 police officers to the judges to the crowd of all 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:32.210
 those who will have hurt us 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:36.020
 temptation is hatred it is she who 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:39.490
 keeps us standing day after day in 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.490
 the tent of revenge 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:55.350
 luckily there is mozart and brel and 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.470
 rimbaud and antonin artaud all these 

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:59.770
 men 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:02.200
 they cried yelling sing notes 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:06.660
 the highest despite the wall of the 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:06.660
 mediocrity the impossible death 

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:10.230
 fortunately 

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:13.589
 there is love 

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:20.770
 single birth only birth to life 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:23.550
 to the eternity of love 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:27.060
 death as a permanent 

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:27.060
 possibilities of escape 

00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:34.349
 luckily there is in the end despite everything 

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:42.419
 the beauty the tenderness the patience of the 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.419
 women 

00:05:50.969 --> 00:06:02.860
 but we do not know how to love do not want 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:04.300
 not loved we are afraid to love by 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:09.779
 way we think there is no 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:15.210
 no other solution than to hate love 

00:06:09.779 --> 00:06:15.210
 to save us from the absence 

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:18.790
 fortunately 

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:29.970
 there is Christ the only one who has not 

00:06:24.449 --> 00:06:32.280
 never cheated anger is tenderness 

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:34.169
 from christ to the end until the end 

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:35.750
 until agony in solitude 

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:39.919
 until death 

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:46.160
 until forgiveness when all abandon him 

00:06:39.919 --> 00:06:52.560
 can be with him with him only 

00:06:46.160 --> 00:07:00.470
 they deliver us from the evil we 

00:06:52.560 --> 00:07:00.470
 can say in a murmur peace 

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:07.960
 earth forgive us for doubting the 

00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:19.250
 earth do not have my will is there third 

00:07:16.270 --> 00:07:23.010

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:26.210
 forgive them for they do not know they 

00:07:23.010 --> 00:07:26.210
 can not know 

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:35.430
 peace 

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:38.430
 in your hands I give myself back 

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:38.430
 bitter
