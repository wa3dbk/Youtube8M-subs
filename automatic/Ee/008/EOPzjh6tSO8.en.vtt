spray can I'll show you which make I

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.979 
spray can I'll show you which make I

used and I didn't sand them I didn't

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.750 
used and I didn't sand them I didn't
think<00:01:01.079> it<00:01:01.230> was<00:01:01.289> necessary<00:01:01.469> because<00:01:02.129> these

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
think it was necessary because these

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.870 
think it was necessary because these
parts<00:01:03.210> don't<00:01:03.510> get<00:01:04.110> touched<00:01:04.470> very<00:01:04.890> often<00:01:05.339> it's

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
parts don't get touched very often it's

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.350 
parts don't get touched very often it's
not<00:01:05.970> like<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.360> door<00:01:06.570> handle<00:01:07.080> or<00:01:07.290> anything<00:01:07.770> and

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:08.360 
not like the door handle or anything and

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:16.700 
not like the door handle or anything and
and<00:01:09.360> it<00:01:09.810> looked<00:01:09.990> good<00:01:10.140> it<00:01:10.500> looked<00:01:10.680> real<00:01:10.830> well

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.870
