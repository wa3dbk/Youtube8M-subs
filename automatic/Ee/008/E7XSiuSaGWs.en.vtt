there's<00:00:23.450> a<00:00:23.510> reason<00:00:23.750> why<00:00:24.050> we've<00:00:24.290> chosen<00:00:24.320> to<00:00:24.740> use

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:24.770 
there's a reason why we've chosen to use

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:27.190 
there's a reason why we've chosen to use
the<00:00:25.070> spinning<00:00:25.310> clothes<00:00:25.580> today<00:00:25.930> we<00:00:26.930> already

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:27.200 
the spinning clothes today we already

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.660 
the spinning clothes today we already
touch<00:00:27.350> base<00:00:27.560> that<00:00:27.740> part<00:00:27.950> of<00:00:28.040> it<00:00:28.160> they<00:00:28.310> spin

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:28.670 
touch base that part of it they spin

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.210 
touch base that part of it they spin
really<00:00:29.270> easy<00:00:29.570> at<00:00:29.840> super<00:00:30.170> slow<00:00:30.410> speeds<00:00:30.740> so<00:00:31.040> from

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:31.220 
really easy at super slow speeds so from

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.010 
really easy at super slow speeds so from
dripping<00:00:31.490> perspective<00:00:32.210> that's<00:00:32.390> an<00:00:32.570> advantage

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.020 
dripping perspective that's an advantage

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.830 
dripping perspective that's an advantage
but<00:00:33.530> they're<00:00:33.680> also<00:00:33.860> buoyant<00:00:34.850> they<00:00:35.030> float<00:00:35.270> and

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:35.840 
but they're also buoyant they float and

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:36.939 
but they're also buoyant they float and
because<00:00:36.110> of<00:00:36.230> that<00:00:36.320> they<00:00:36.500> help<00:00:36.650> keep<00:00:36.800> our

00:00:36.939 --> 00:00:36.949 
because of that they help keep our

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:38.410 
because of that they help keep our
crawler<00:00:37.220> up<00:00:37.520> off<00:00:37.670> the<00:00:37.820> bottom<00:00:37.940> a<00:00:38.150> little<00:00:38.239> bit

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:38.420 
crawler up off the bottom a little bit

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:39.910 
crawler up off the bottom a little bit
not<00:00:39.080> so<00:00:39.110> much<00:00:39.379> because<00:00:39.500> I'm<00:00:39.650> worried<00:00:39.860> about

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
not so much because I'm worried about

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.770
