by far my favorite clip ins that I've
ever<00:00:28.320> had<00:00:28.949> and<00:00:29.340> it's<00:00:30.029> one<00:00:30.420> set<00:00:30.779> of<00:00:31.019> clippings

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
ever had and it's one set of clippings

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.310 
ever had and it's one set of clippings
um<00:00:32.099> usually<00:00:32.640> I<00:00:33.120> know<00:00:33.450> some<00:00:33.780> people<00:00:33.809> would<00:00:34.110> use

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
um usually I know some people would use

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.130 
um usually I know some people would use
two<00:00:34.770> sets<00:00:34.980> because<00:00:35.579> one<00:00:36.059> set<00:00:36.300> is<00:00:36.510> kind<00:00:36.809> of<00:00:36.870> thin

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
two sets because one set is kind of thin

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.020 
two sets because one set is kind of thin
to<00:00:37.380> me<00:00:37.530> it<00:00:37.800> looks<00:00:37.950> more<00:00:38.040> natural<00:00:38.219> when<00:00:38.820> it's

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
to me it looks more natural when it's

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.420 
to me it looks more natural when it's
not<00:00:39.300> as<00:00:39.510> thick<00:00:39.899> because<00:00:40.290> then<00:00:40.620> it<00:00:40.739> matches<00:00:41.219> it

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
not as thick because then it matches it

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.240 
not as thick because then it matches it
kind<00:00:42.270> of<00:00:42.390> like<00:00:42.629> how<00:00:42.870> my<00:00:43.140> hair<00:00:43.379> would<00:00:43.680> be<00:00:43.829> if<00:00:44.070> my

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
kind of like how my hair would be if my

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.130 
kind of like how my hair would be if my
hair<00:00:44.460> grew<00:00:44.700> out<00:00:44.820> to<00:00:45.000> be<00:00:45.090> really<00:00:45.270> involved<00:00:45.600> so

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140
