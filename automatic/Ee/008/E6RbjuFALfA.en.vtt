to<00:00:25.050> fully<00:00:25.320> break<00:00:25.590> in<00:00:25.920> right<00:00:26.460> now<00:00:26.580> it's

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
to fully break in right now it's

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.220 
to fully break in right now it's
starting<00:00:27.090> to<00:00:27.180> break<00:00:27.359> in<00:00:27.599> but<00:00:27.750> there<00:00:27.869> are<00:00:27.960> some

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
starting to break in but there are some

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.689 
starting to break in but there are some
things<00:00:28.439> that<00:00:28.590> I<00:00:28.710> really<00:00:29.010> don't<00:00:29.189> like<00:00:29.250> about<00:00:29.550> it

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
things that I really don't like about it

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.939 
things that I really don't like about it
and<00:00:30.029> we'll<00:00:30.390> start<00:00:30.689> with<00:00:30.900> that<00:00:31.140> right<00:00:31.439> now<00:00:31.470> so<00:00:31.920> I

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
and we'll start with that right now so I

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:35.270 
and we'll start with that right now so I
don't<00:00:32.279> like<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.850> finger<00:00:33.090> pad<00:00:33.450> is<00:00:33.750> one<00:00:34.079> thing<00:00:34.410> I

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.889 
don't like the finger pad is one thing I
think<00:00:35.700> it<00:00:35.940> would<00:00:36.059> have<00:00:36.149> been<00:00:36.210> better<00:00:36.270> if<00:00:36.570> K

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899

when<00:01:21.869> it<00:01:21.960> was<00:01:22.080> brand-new<00:01:22.439> it<00:01:22.560> was<00:01:22.710> super<00:01:23.070> stiff

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
when it was brand-new it was super stiff

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.890 
when it was brand-new it was super stiff
it<00:01:23.490> was<00:01:23.610> almost<00:01:23.790> like<00:01:23.970> a<00:01:24.030> rock<00:01:24.270> hard<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:24.720> break

it was almost like a rock hard to break

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.080 
it was almost like a rock hard to break
in<00:01:25.140> but<00:01:25.830> it<00:01:25.920> did<00:01:26.070> come<00:01:26.220> around<00:01:26.430> really<00:01:26.790> nicely

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
in but it did come around really nicely

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.960

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:31.850 
this one is still solid as a rock it's
it<00:01:30.329> needs<00:01:30.540> game<00:01:30.780> time<00:01:31.079> that's<00:01:31.350> what<00:01:31.500> it<00:01:31.650> needs

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
it needs game time that's what it needs

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.399 
it needs game time that's what it needs
it<00:01:32.070> just<00:01:32.250> needs<00:01:32.430> time<00:01:32.700> put<00:01:33.000> into<00:01:33.030> it<00:01:33.299> and<00:01:33.630> get

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
it just needs time put into it and get

this squeaking noise you'll hear they're
it's<00:02:12.540> like<00:02:12.900> the<00:02:13.080> finger

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
it's like the finger

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.380 
it's like the finger
rubbing<00:02:14.250> on<00:02:14.370> each<00:02:14.400> other<00:02:14.700> and<00:02:14.790> it's<00:02:15.090> kind<00:02:15.330> of

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
rubbing on each other and it's kind of

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.510 
rubbing on each other and it's kind of
annoying<00:02:15.630> sound<00:02:16.080> it<00:02:16.650> kind<00:02:16.890> of<00:02:16.980> bothers<00:02:17.280> me<00:02:17.430> it

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
annoying sound it kind of bothers me it

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.700 
annoying sound it kind of bothers me it
makes<00:02:17.640> me<00:02:17.760> almost<00:02:17.970> feel<00:02:18.240> like<00:02:18.270> the<00:02:18.630> leather<00:02:19.470> is

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
makes me almost feel like the leather is

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:22.460 
makes me almost feel like the leather is
like<00:02:19.860> a<00:02:19.890> pleather<00:02:20.250> like<00:02:20.550> a<00:02:20.580> fake<00:02:20.880> leather<00:02:21.470> but

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
like a pleather like a fake leather but

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:23.750 
like a pleather like a fake leather but
I'm<00:02:22.770> hoping<00:02:23.130> it's<00:02:23.310> just<00:02:23.370> because<00:02:23.730> it's

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
I'm hoping it's just because it's

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.630 
I'm hoping it's just because it's
brand-new<00:02:24.030> the<00:02:24.420> rawlings<00:02:24.750> never<00:02:24.960> did<00:02:25.200> that

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
brand-new the rawlings never did that

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.580 
brand-new the rawlings never did that
