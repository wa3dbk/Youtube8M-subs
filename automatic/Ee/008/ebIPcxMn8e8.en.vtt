be working on an acrylic painting that
I've<00:00:17.180> started<00:00:17.480> a<00:00:17.660> few<00:00:17.840> days<00:00:17.869> ago<00:00:18.050> and<00:00:19.480> in<00:00:20.480> this

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:20.660 
I've started a few days ago and in this

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.409 
I've started a few days ago and in this
painting<00:00:21.039> what<00:00:22.039> I<00:00:22.070> want<00:00:22.369> to<00:00:22.550> try<00:00:22.789> to<00:00:22.849> do<00:00:23.060> is

00:00:23.409 --> 00:00:23.419 
painting what I want to try to do is

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:26.830 
painting what I want to try to do is
paint<00:00:24.050> with<00:00:24.829> acrylics<00:00:25.340> but<00:00:25.430> exactly<00:00:25.849> like<00:00:26.300> the

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:26.840 
paint with acrylics but exactly like the

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.200 
paint with acrylics but exactly like the
way<00:00:26.989> I<00:00:27.020> paint<00:00:27.500> with<00:00:27.680> oils<00:00:28.070> so<00:00:28.399> there's<00:00:29.119> a

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.210 
way I paint with oils so there's a

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.700 
way I paint with oils so there's a
tendency<00:00:29.800> with<00:00:30.800> acrylic<00:00:31.189> paints<00:00:31.640> to<00:00:31.939> paint<00:00:32.710> a

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710 
tendency with acrylic paints to paint a

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.280 
tendency with acrylic paints to paint a
little<00:00:33.860> thinner<00:00:34.250> and<00:00:34.579> people<00:00:35.480> sort<00:00:35.690> of<00:00:35.750> scrubs

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:36.290 
little thinner and people sort of scrubs

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:41.340 
little thinner and people sort of scrubs
paint<00:00:36.770> on<00:00:36.920> it<00:00:37.219> sort<00:00:37.579> of<00:00:37.700> goes<00:00:38.450> on<00:00:38.629> thin<00:00:39.020> and

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350 
paint on it sort of goes on thin and

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.649 
paint on it sort of goes on thin and
people<00:00:42.350> who<00:00:42.500> know<00:00:42.950> paint<00:00:43.309> and<00:00:43.610> wash<00:00:44.329> for

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:44.659 
people who know paint and wash for

00:00:44.659 --> 00:00:46.180 
people who know paint and wash for
example<00:00:45.109> you<00:00:45.440> know<00:00:45.530> sometimes<00:00:45.980> can

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
example you know sometimes can

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.310 
example you know sometimes can
transition<00:00:46.699> rate<00:00:46.909> easily<00:00:47.390> over<00:00:47.600> to<00:00:47.809> acrylics

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.320 
transition rate easily over to acrylics

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.809 
transition rate easily over to acrylics
you<00:00:48.530> know<00:00:48.739> if<00:00:48.890> they<00:00:49.039> paint<00:00:49.280> that<00:00:49.460> way<00:00:49.609> that

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:49.819 
you know if they paint that way that

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:53.290 
you know if they paint that way that
sort<00:00:50.030> of<00:00:50.149> thin<00:00:51.309> matter<00:00:52.309> with<00:00:52.699> maybe<00:00:52.940> a<00:00:53.030> lot<00:00:53.210> of

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.300 
sort of thin matter with maybe a lot of

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.229 
sort of thin matter with maybe a lot of
cross<00:00:53.510> hatching<00:00:54.140> or<00:00:54.440> or<00:00:55.190> blocks<00:00:55.489> of<00:00:55.789> color<00:00:56.030> was

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 
cross hatching or or blocks of color was

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:59.439 
cross hatching or or blocks of color was
very<00:00:56.420> sharp<00:00:56.690> edges<00:00:57.069> but<00:00:58.069> the<00:00:58.940> way<00:00:59.059> I<00:00:59.089> want<00:00:59.390> to

00:00:59.439 --> 00:00:59.449 
very sharp edges but the way I want to

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:02.439 
very sharp edges but the way I want to
paint<00:00:59.809> tonight<00:01:00.050> is<00:01:00.589> a<00:01:00.859> very<00:01:01.280> Alla<00:01:01.550> Prima<00:01:01.670> or

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:02.449 
paint tonight is a very Alla Prima or

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:06.310 
paint tonight is a very Alla Prima or
that<00:01:02.690> is<00:01:02.870> all<00:01:03.649> at<00:01:03.800> once<00:01:04.059> very<00:01:05.059> wet<00:01:05.420> and<00:01:05.870> a<00:01:06.110> wet

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
that is all at once very wet and a wet

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.469 
that is all at once very wet and a wet
into<00:01:06.620> wet<00:01:06.830> style<00:01:07.400> of<00:01:07.550> painting<00:01:07.880> was<00:01:08.000> very<00:01:08.240> very

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 
into wet style of painting was very very

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:12.969 
into wet style of painting was very very
thick<00:01:08.780> strokes<00:01:09.170> and<00:01:10.479> there's<00:01:11.479> a<00:01:11.540> few<00:01:12.110> you<00:01:12.860> know

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
thick strokes and there's a few you know

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:15.700 
thick strokes and there's a few you know
tricks<00:01:13.340> you<00:01:13.549> can<00:01:13.580> kind<00:01:13.940> of<00:01:14.030> use<00:01:14.270> to<00:01:14.500> make<00:01:15.500> that

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
tricks you can kind of use to make that

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.950 
tricks you can kind of use to make that
a<00:01:15.740> lot<00:01:15.980> easier<00:01:17.170> after<00:01:18.170> the<00:01:18.650> painting<00:01:18.890> dries<00:01:19.220> I

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
a lot easier after the painting dries I

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:25.200 
a lot easier after the painting dries I
will<00:01:20.960> be<00:01:23.200> scrambling<00:01:24.200> a<00:01:24.290> little<00:01:24.320> bit<00:01:24.770> and

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
will be scrambling a little bit and

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.810 
will be scrambling a little bit and
adjusting<00:01:26.210> the<00:01:26.300> values<00:01:26.720> was<00:01:27.200> a<00:01:27.230> few<00:01:27.470> places

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:27.820 
adjusting the values was a few places

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.370 
adjusting the values was a few places
now<00:01:28.820> one<00:01:29.000> of<00:01:29.030> the<00:01:29.180> nice<00:01:29.450> things<00:01:29.480> about<00:01:29.900> an

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
now one of the nice things about an

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:31.990 
now one of the nice things about an
acrylic<00:01:30.620> painting<00:01:31.130> is<00:01:31.280> it<00:01:31.640> dries<00:01:31.850> very

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
acrylic painting is it dries very

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.150 
acrylic painting is it dries very
quickly<00:01:32.530> and<00:01:33.530> I<00:01:35.110> can<00:01:36.140> I<00:01:36.320> think<00:01:36.500> lays<00:01:36.710> almost

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:37.160 
quickly and I can I think lays almost

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.460 
quickly and I can I think lays almost
immediately<00:01:37.670> what<00:01:37.880> I've<00:01:38.000> done<00:01:38.180> you<00:01:38.510> know

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
immediately what I've done you know

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:41.320 
immediately what I've done you know
maybe<00:01:39.740> if<00:01:40.010> the<00:01:40.160> paint<00:01:40.400> layer<00:01:40.670> is<00:01:40.850> really<00:01:41.060> thick

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:41.330 
maybe if the paint layer is really thick

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.480 
maybe if the paint layer is really thick
I'm<00:01:42.080> gonna<00:01:42.290> have<00:01:42.380> to<00:01:42.500> wait<00:01:42.650> maybe<00:01:43.130> an<00:01:43.310> hour<00:01:43.400> or

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
I'm gonna have to wait maybe an hour or

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.600 
I'm gonna have to wait maybe an hour or
two<00:01:44.710> but<00:01:45.710> one<00:01:45.920> thing<00:01:46.130> you<00:01:46.160> have<00:01:46.430> to<00:01:46.520> remember

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
two but one thing you have to remember

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.020 
two but one thing you have to remember
about<00:01:46.910> paint<00:01:47.270> acrylic<00:01:48.170> paint<00:01:48.530> is<00:01:48.940> when<00:01:49.940> you

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
about paint acrylic paint is when you

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.400 
about paint acrylic paint is when you
paint<00:01:50.270> on<00:01:50.420> a<00:01:50.890> real<00:01:51.890> thick<00:01:52.310> stroke<00:01:52.730> it<00:01:53.720> will<00:01:53.960> get

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:54.410 
paint on a real thick stroke it will get

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:56.920 
paint on a real thick stroke it will get
thinner<00:01:54.620> as<00:01:55.070> it<00:01:55.280> dries<00:01:55.520> because<00:01:56.030> as<00:01:56.750> I

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
thinner as it dries because as I

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.800 
thinner as it dries because as I
mentioned<00:01:56.960> before<00:01:57.380> the<00:01:58.370> water<00:01:58.610> leaves<00:01:58.970> that

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
mentioned before the water leaves that

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.590 
mentioned before the water leaves that
stroke<00:02:00.230> and<00:02:00.680> to<00:02:01.010> become

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
stroke and to become

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.319 
stroke and to become
you<00:02:02.600> know<00:02:02.689> by<00:02:02.810> volume<00:02:03.320> no<00:02:03.770> smaller<00:02:04.180> whereas<00:02:05.180> an

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:05.329 
you know by volume no smaller whereas an

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:09.760 
you know by volume no smaller whereas an
oil<00:02:05.570> stroke<00:02:05.960> that<00:02:06.970> it<00:02:07.970> dries<00:02:08.270> by<00:02:08.770> oxidation

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
oil stroke that it dries by oxidation

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.290 
oil stroke that it dries by oxidation
and<00:02:11.200> it<00:02:12.200> won't<00:02:12.440> it<00:02:12.950> won't<00:02:13.160> diminish<00:02:13.880> it<00:02:14.180> all

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:14.300 
and it won't it won't diminish it all

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.500 
and it won't it won't diminish it all
the<00:02:14.420> things<00:02:14.720> at<00:02:15.020> all<00:02:15.190> so<00:02:16.190> the<00:02:16.910> main<00:02:17.239> thing

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
the things at all so the main thing

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.059 
the things at all so the main thing
though<00:02:17.720> is<00:02:17.989> that<00:02:18.019> the<00:02:18.470> appearance<00:02:18.709> of<00:02:18.950> the

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 
though is that the appearance of the

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:21.580 
though is that the appearance of the
thick<00:02:19.310> stroke<00:02:19.730> with<00:02:20.239> all<00:02:20.390> uh<00:02:20.420> you<00:02:21.200> know<00:02:21.290> very

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:50.380

00:03:59.789 --> 00:03:59.799 
of acrylic medium and this will keep the

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:02.620 
of acrylic medium and this will keep the
the<00:04:00.799> surface<00:04:01.549> of<00:04:01.700> the<00:04:01.760> paint<00:04:02.000> from<00:04:02.120> being<00:04:02.389> too

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630 
the surface of the paint from being too

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:05.559 
the surface of the paint from being too
absorbent<00:04:03.370> now<00:04:04.370> if<00:04:04.489> I<00:04:04.579> just<00:04:04.639> just<00:04:05.120> sweat<00:04:05.299> it<00:04:05.420> up

00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:05.569 
absorbent now if I just just sweat it up

and<00:04:09.970> that<00:04:10.120> would<00:04:10.240> be<00:04:10.300> bad<00:04:10.800> now<00:04:11.800> here's<00:04:12.010> some<00:04:12.250> of

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
and that would be bad now here's some of

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.520 
and that would be bad now here's some of
my<00:04:12.400> paint<00:04:12.790> I<00:04:13.030> use<00:04:13.420> primarily<00:04:13.870> golden<00:04:14.290> paint

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
thick and I like that feel it feels more

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:21.780

fairly<00:04:38.530> quickly<00:04:38.940> with<00:04:39.940> it<00:04:39.970> with<00:04:40.390> acrylics<00:04:40.930> but

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:41.140 
fairly quickly with it with acrylics but

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:43.560 
fairly quickly with it with acrylics but
I<00:04:41.290> did<00:04:41.890> they<00:04:42.010> give<00:04:42.220> a<00:04:42.250> texture<00:04:43.120> that<00:04:43.240> I<00:04:43.300> really

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.570 
I did they give a texture that I really

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:47.610 
I did they give a texture that I really
love<00:04:43.780> now<00:04:44.590> this<00:04:44.770> is<00:04:44.980> a<00:04:45.250> gel<00:04:45.850> that<00:04:46.150> I<00:04:47.020> get<00:04:47.440> from

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620 
love now this is a gel that I get from

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.100 
love now this is a gel that I get from
Utrecht<00:04:48.070> and<00:04:48.910> you<00:04:49.120> can<00:04:49.240> see<00:04:49.480> it's<00:04:49.630> very<00:04:49.840> clear

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
Utrecht and you can see it's very clear

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.700 
Utrecht and you can see it's very clear
and<00:04:51.570> when<00:04:52.570> you<00:04:52.660> put<00:04:52.840> this<00:04:52.960> on<00:04:53.170> you<00:04:53.440> don't<00:04:53.530> want

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
and when you put this on you don't want

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:55.340 
and when you put this on you don't want
to<00:04:53.770> put<00:04:53.890> on<00:04:53.980> too<00:04:54.250> thick<00:04:54.280> I<00:04:54.760> mean<00:04:54.910> it<00:04:55.030> can

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:55.350 
to put on too thick I mean it can

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:58.410 
to put on too thick I mean it can
disrupt<00:04:56.580> cross-linking<00:04:57.580> of<00:04:57.700> the<00:04:57.910> different

00:04:58.410 --> 00:04:58.420 
disrupt cross-linking of the different

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:02.780 
disrupt cross-linking of the different
layers<00:04:58.540> of<00:04:58.750> paint<00:04:59.490> so<00:05:00.490> you<00:05:01.480> put<00:05:01.960> it<00:05:02.050> on<00:05:02.140> thin

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:02.790 
layers of paint so you put it on thin

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:06.750 
layers of paint so you put it on thin
and<00:05:04.110> it's<00:05:05.110> actually<00:05:05.710> it's<00:05:06.040> actually<00:05:06.370> quite

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:06.760 
and it's actually it's actually quite

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.350 
and it's actually it's actually quite
thick<00:05:07.650> now<00:05:08.650> here's<00:05:08.890> my<00:05:08.950> palette<00:05:09.490> and<00:05:09.760> I've

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.360 
thick now here's my palette and I've

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.460 
thick now here's my palette and I've
used<00:05:10.690> my<00:05:11.910> grayscale<00:05:12.910> to<00:05:13.360> pick<00:05:13.630> out<00:05:13.810> mostly

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:14.470 
used my grayscale to pick out mostly

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:21.300 
used my grayscale to pick out mostly
like<00:05:15.340> six<00:05:15.940> values<00:05:16.180> seven<00:05:16.720> value<00:05:19.350> Gray's<00:05:20.350> well

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:21.310 
like six values seven value Gray's well

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:22.920 
like six values seven value Gray's well
some<00:05:21.610> of<00:05:21.670> these<00:05:21.760> are<00:05:21.910> the<00:05:22.030> lighter<00:05:22.270> I've<00:05:22.720> tried

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:22.930 
some of these are the lighter I've tried

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:27.240 
some of these are the lighter I've tried
to<00:05:23.050> keep<00:05:23.200> the<00:05:23.470> color<00:05:24.070> very<00:05:25.290> broken<00:05:26.290> and<00:05:26.950> I

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.250 
to keep the color very broken and I

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:30.180 
to keep the color very broken and I
might<00:05:27.430> add<00:05:27.610> just<00:05:27.940> a<00:05:28.750> little<00:05:28.780> bit<00:05:29.050> of<00:05:29.140> red<00:05:29.320> you

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:30.190 
might add just a little bit of red you

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:35.239 
might add just a little bit of red you
can<00:05:30.340> see<00:05:30.370> how<00:05:30.700> that's<00:05:31.260> maybe<00:05:32.260> a<00:05:32.380> bit<00:05:32.560> much

00:05:35.239 --> 00:05:35.249 

00:05:35.249 --> 00:05:37.849 

I'm<00:05:36.209> sharp<00:05:36.509> in<00:05:36.689> the<00:05:36.809> end<00:05:36.929> was<00:05:37.289> a<00:05:37.319> pencil

00:05:37.849 --> 00:05:37.859 
I'm sharp in the end was a pencil

00:05:37.859 --> 00:05:40.839 
I'm sharp in the end was a pencil
sharpener<00:05:38.119> and<00:05:39.119> I'm<00:05:39.419> a<00:05:39.569> scratch<00:05:39.899> into<00:05:40.229> the

00:05:40.839 --> 00:05:40.849 
sharpener and I'm a scratch into the

00:05:40.849 --> 00:05:45.109 
sharpener and I'm a scratch into the
canvas<00:05:41.849> with<00:05:41.999> that<00:05:42.179> and<00:05:42.389> I<00:05:42.479> will<00:05:42.719> see<00:05:43.309> now<00:05:44.309> some

00:05:45.109 --> 00:05:45.119 
canvas with that and I will see now some

00:05:45.119 --> 00:05:47.599 
canvas with that and I will see now some
of<00:05:45.149> these<00:05:45.269> strokes<00:05:45.629> will<00:05:46.079> be<00:05:46.229> fairly<00:05:46.559> fat<00:05:47.129> even

00:05:47.599 --> 00:05:47.609 
of these strokes will be fairly fat even

00:05:47.609 --> 00:05:49.489 
of these strokes will be fairly fat even
when<00:05:47.849> they<00:05:47.969> dry<00:05:48.209> but<00:05:48.569> a<00:05:48.719> lot<00:05:48.929> of<00:05:49.049> them<00:05:49.169> will<00:05:49.289> dry

00:05:49.489 --> 00:05:49.499 
when they dry but a lot of them will dry

00:05:49.499 --> 00:05:53.359 
when they dry but a lot of them will dry
damp<00:05:49.709> fairly<00:05:50.309> thin<00:05:50.749> dimensionally<00:05:52.189> but<00:05:53.189> it'll

00:05:53.359 --> 00:05:53.369 
damp fairly thin dimensionally but it'll

00:05:53.369 --> 00:05:55.659 
damp fairly thin dimensionally but it'll
still<00:05:53.609> have<00:05:53.789> the<00:05:53.879> look<00:05:54.089> of<00:05:54.239> a<00:05:54.299> nice<00:05:54.539> fresh

00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:55.669 
still have the look of a nice fresh

00:05:55.669 --> 00:05:58.219 
still have the look of a nice fresh
simply<00:05:56.669> painted<00:05:56.999> canvas<00:05:57.239> and<00:05:57.899> that's<00:05:58.079> what<00:05:58.169> we

00:05:58.219 --> 00:05:58.229 
simply painted canvas and that's what we

00:05:58.229 --> 00:06:04.669 
simply painted canvas and that's what we
want<00:05:59.899> no<00:06:00.899> I'm<00:06:01.109> gonna<00:06:01.289> paint<00:06:01.589> it<00:06:01.859> still<00:06:03.679> darker

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:04.679 
want no I'm gonna paint it still darker

00:06:04.679 --> 00:06:07.549 
want no I'm gonna paint it still darker
over<00:06:04.799> that<00:06:05.689> that<00:06:06.689> Terminator<00:06:07.199> where<00:06:07.439> that

00:06:07.549 --> 00:06:07.559 
over that that Terminator where that

00:06:07.559 --> 00:06:16.029 
over that that Terminator where that
shadow<00:06:07.799> goes<00:06:08.249> by<00:06:11.449> it'll<00:06:12.449> look<00:06:12.509> really<00:06:12.719> nice

00:06:16.029 --> 00:06:16.039 

00:06:16.039 --> 00:06:18.199 

you<00:06:17.039> can<00:06:17.069> see<00:06:17.429> I<00:06:17.459> mean<00:06:17.699> I'm<00:06:17.849> painting<00:06:18.119> right

00:06:18.199 --> 00:06:18.209 
you can see I mean I'm painting right

00:06:18.209 --> 00:06:19.639 
you can see I mean I'm painting right
over<00:06:18.449> a<00:06:18.509> dry<00:06:18.719> paint<00:06:19.049> I<00:06:19.259> mean<00:06:19.409> it's<00:06:19.559> just

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:19.649 
over a dry paint I mean it's just

00:06:19.649 --> 00:06:22.279 
over a dry paint I mean it's just
there's<00:06:20.069> not<00:06:20.189> a<00:06:20.249> problem<00:06:20.549> it<00:06:20.879> just<00:06:21.259> it<00:06:22.259> just

00:06:22.279 --> 00:06:22.289 
there's not a problem it just it just

00:06:22.289 --> 00:06:25.309 
there's not a problem it just it just
goes<00:06:22.769> right<00:06:23.009> over<00:06:23.069> it's<00:06:24.319> fairly

00:06:25.309 --> 00:06:25.319 
goes right over it's fairly

00:06:25.319 --> 00:06:27.769 
goes right over it's fairly
straightforward<00:06:26.119> now<00:06:27.119> you<00:06:27.179> can<00:06:27.360> see<00:06:27.569> here

00:06:27.769 --> 00:06:27.779 
straightforward now you can see here

00:06:27.779 --> 00:06:31.159 
straightforward now you can see here
I've<00:06:27.929> mixed<00:06:28.169> up<00:06:28.409> some<00:06:29.299> some<00:06:30.299> lighter<00:06:30.569> yellow

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:31.169 
I've mixed up some some lighter yellow

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:33.409 
I've mixed up some some lighter yellow
so<00:06:31.529> I<00:06:31.559> mixed<00:06:31.860> quite<00:06:32.039> a<00:06:32.069> bit<00:06:32.249> of<00:06:32.369> red<00:06:32.909> into<00:06:33.269> it

00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:33.419 
so I mixed quite a bit of red into it

00:06:33.419 --> 00:06:35.509 
so I mixed quite a bit of red into it
it's<00:06:34.139> all<00:06:34.229> very<00:06:34.559> very<00:06:34.739> broken

00:06:35.509 --> 00:06:35.519 
it's all very very broken

00:06:35.519 --> 00:06:39.049 
it's all very very broken
I<00:06:35.549> haven't<00:06:36.179> over<00:06:36.449> mixed<00:06:36.869> and<00:06:37.799> the<00:06:38.669> value<00:06:38.969> is

00:06:39.049 --> 00:06:39.059 
I haven't over mixed and the value is

00:06:39.059 --> 00:06:41.899 
I haven't over mixed and the value is
probably<00:06:39.299> about<00:06:39.769> I'd<00:06:40.769> say<00:06:40.799> like<00:06:41.189> about<00:06:41.459> a<00:06:41.489> six

00:06:41.899 --> 00:06:41.909 
probably about I'd say like about a six

00:06:41.909 --> 00:06:45.079 
probably about I'd say like about a six
to<00:06:42.029> a<00:06:42.179> seven<00:06:42.979> and<00:06:43.979> those<00:06:44.279> will<00:06:44.429> be<00:06:44.489> perfect<00:06:44.909> for

00:06:45.079 --> 00:06:45.089 
to a seven and those will be perfect for

00:06:45.089 --> 00:06:47.419 
to a seven and those will be perfect for
the<00:06:45.299> hay<00:06:46.199> bales<00:06:46.439> in<00:06:46.649> the<00:06:46.739> front<00:06:47.009> that<00:06:47.129> are<00:06:47.249> very

00:06:47.419 --> 00:06:47.429 
the hay bales in the front that are very

00:06:47.429 --> 00:06:59.720 
the hay bales in the front that are very
light

00:06:59.720 --> 00:06:59.730 

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:02.360 

okay<00:07:00.330> so<00:07:00.390> I'm<00:07:00.660> really<00:07:01.140> desperately<00:07:02.010> need<00:07:02.340> to

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:02.370 
okay so I'm really desperately need to

00:07:02.370 --> 00:07:04.520 
okay so I'm really desperately need to
stand<00:07:03.330> back<00:07:03.510> and<00:07:03.870> take<00:07:03.930> a<00:07:04.080> look<00:07:04.290> at<00:07:04.410> this

00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:04.530 
stand back and take a look at this

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:07.130 
stand back and take a look at this
because<00:07:05.330> there's<00:07:06.330> a<00:07:06.360> very<00:07:06.540> good<00:07:06.570> chance<00:07:06.690> that

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:07.140 
because there's a very good chance that

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:08.810 
because there's a very good chance that
this<00:07:07.290> might<00:07:07.650> not<00:07:07.680> be<00:07:07.860> reading<00:07:08.310> correctly<00:07:08.520> and

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:08.820
