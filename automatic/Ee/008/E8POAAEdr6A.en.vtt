00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:09.240
 hello people today we want the question 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:12.110
 like the problematic on the 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:15.630
 go fundamentally what it's all about 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:17.460
 that the first fruit supposedly on sugar 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.730
 should be overbred 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:23.340
 I hear that again and again I want you 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.160
 very briefly my thoughts on this we give 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.119
 and maybe you can have one too 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.300
 form opinion 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.830
 it's like we start that 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.140
 first thing is first you have to 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.940
 imagine that for decades one 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.250
 worked some propaganda has its 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.710
 propaganda against sugar against 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.480
 carbohydrates and that has been plain and simple 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.059
 touching that led you 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.700
 nowadays equates fruit with sugar 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:50.969
 and therefore a chronic answer yes 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.770
 really propaganda for decades 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.980
 different directions and the 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:01:01.500
 fruit of course that works that's it 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:02.940
 the first one and let's start 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.040
 Let's start, let's catch it for a moment 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.400
 So the experiences I made 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.880
 if I have just now on vacation 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.860
 was 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.850
 and I also have wild prickly pears 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:17.820
 eaten wild bananas in Thailand what 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.479
 whatever the start trees threaten in 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:24.000
 For example, thailand became a groupon 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:27.409
 jack fruit trees riesending real 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.119
 gigantic the middle of the pampa and 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:31.530
 honestly then hung barrel off as 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.420
 really probably several hundred 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.340
 kilograms or tons of fruit 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.869
 that was gigantic 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.280
 and that was in the middle of the pampa me 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.030
 do not believe that there monsanto or in 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.799
 Breeders just what gene manipulated or 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:46.009
 why have bred that tree completely 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.880
 a lot of bears very big rieck and 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:49.740
 that he then still on sugar 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.159
 has omitted because of these things 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.290
 tasted extremely sweet but not even 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.090
 go so far we can stay 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.790
 but here in germany at the cultivation 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.719
 from high yard also grown quite a few 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.149
 apple trees 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:06.869
 the taste sugar sweet are right 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:10.649
 really delicious, of course, are also sour 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:12.420
 varieties very briefly at this 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.770
 if you had a choice somewhere 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.220
 you your nature sooner or whatever 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.720
 always 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.700
 between the sour apple and one 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.810
 sweet seconded sour fluff species 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:24.120
 or sweet whatever 99 9% would 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:27.629
 you're too sweet to grab that yes only 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:30.480
 but by the way, this one 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:32.220
 Things are looking over 100 years old 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.300
 Let me take a look at this picture or 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.700
 these pictures i'm watching right now 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:38.580
 By the way, this is a shrub 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.200
 It's probably over 50 years old 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.879
 even 60 years old he has none 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.849
 Genmanipuliert there will not rum 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:48.599
 bred this shrub gooseberry 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:51.720
 shrub bears every year every year 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:52.620
 he is really fat and bulging so you 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.160
 you have to imagine 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:58.230
 He wears it extremely many fruits 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.349
 single gooseberries are right 

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:03.900
 really fat and really big and it is 

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:07.080
 Third, they are really cute 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:09.209
 yes, that's why I can only with my head 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.250
 shake when people saw that 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:13.200
 whole fruit is sugar- coated yes 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.750
 look at the things at first 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.159
 accidents it's wild old son what 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.780
 Whatever he of course there are also 

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:21.150
 they do not clean things sweet but it does 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.819
 is also extremely sweet says yes of nature 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.709
 that's the first one but now 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:27.450
 Let's see if that whole 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:29.930
 Fruit in the supermarket really so often 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.670
 sugar is overgrown if it is so sweet 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.250
 I do not know where you live but if 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:36.079
 i usually aldi or penny g 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.750
 Exceptions are always positive 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:40.909
 exceptions though when i am normally in 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.260
 These supermarkets g, for example, with 

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:45.890
 an alcohol or whatever 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:48.049
 because ingenious sour immature fucking 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:52.689
 again, I have to say that clearly 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:55.159
 clean immature nothing tastes sweet 

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:57.139
 catastrophic tastes shitty where is 

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:58.790
 because there is sugar overgrown fruit 

00:03:57.139 --> 00:04:00.129
 it's a joke, is not it ? 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.169
 bad joke 

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:06.079
 a principle is always when something sweet 

00:04:03.169 --> 00:04:07.700
 tastes yes then it is also rich in 

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:10.370
 Minerals rich in vitamin and so on 

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:12.189
 As I said, I do not know what I mean 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.629
 still to say about this topic 

00:04:12.189 --> 00:04:17.539
 my experience looks very different 

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:20.150
 especially this theme with the old ones 

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:21.500
 varieties and as I said look at where 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.780
 are the over-bred on sugar 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.720
 Fruits that's just scary here 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:29.169
 chronic fear of the sugar 

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:31.009
 chronic fear of carbohydrates 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:34.190
 for decades propaganda I have it 

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:36.889
 said is bullshit 

00:04:34.190 --> 00:04:39.349
 this argument just does not just pull 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:42.669
 very bad and limited only a few 

00:04:39.349 --> 00:04:45.860
 varieties are really that changed 

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:49.370
 She really sweet sense or much 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:51.349
 are bigger or whatever that 

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:55.330
 I was recently traveling same've got 

00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:59.030
 in a forest extra gigantic 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:00.169
 bombay was they were worth in balance 

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:03.259
 found 

00:05:00.169 --> 00:05:06.139
 tons without end of the barrel without end 

00:05:03.259 --> 00:05:07.610
 on the shrub big and all sweet there 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:12.050
 nothing was manipulated or 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:15.620
 bred or something that is that 

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:17.360
 argument that you say hey that's not 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.889
 to eat normally so much fruit because earlier 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.389
 it would have been a lot smaller or it would have been 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:21.800
 would not be so much fruit available 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:23.360
 because the trees are less worn 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.550
 or the third one will 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:28.340
 it would all be sugar breeder it 

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:29.930
 simply kaiserschmarrn I do not know 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:33.130
 As you can see people write to me 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:36.699
 your opinion has so under it makes it good 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:36.699
 see you soon
