00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.920

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.460
 grab all those woods that you have in 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.050
 your house you can assemble buzzer is worth what 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.819
 have what you want to recycle 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.999
 because he must teach how to make this blackboard 

00:00:32.819 --> 00:00:37.890
 with those woods and we're going to give it shape 

00:00:35.999 --> 00:00:39.960
 of cupcake to decorate your kitchen 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.390
 we started 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.840
 on my desk with what the 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.480
 woods to recycle horizontally 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:51.449
 in the middle abundant vinyl cola and 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:55.430
 a wood above then hold it 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.430
 well with nails and the hammer 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:59.120
 when the vinyl glue dried I gave it 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.490
 return 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:05.330
 I took a chalk and from the back 

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:09.110
 I started drawing all the cupcake on 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:11.720
 perimeter is to say the entire edge with the 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:14.390
 chalk you make the cream to the part of the pyro 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:18.010
 tim and all the details you have 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:20.140
 wanting to join your project 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:22.990
 and it was time for rock and roll 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:26.020
 girls with this short hand jigsaw 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:28.750
 the outline when finished cutting 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:31.990
 all the cupcake I took a brush eta 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:34.180
 synthetic flat and wetting paint 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:37.240
 acrylic brown I started to 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:40.420
 paint the entire middle part of my cupcake 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.790
 is with a dark brown that simulates 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:46.870
 chocolate and you just have to 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:48.940
 paint flat very simple let it be 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:51.840
 dry and then if you want you can give 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:54.340
 another hand to make it darker 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.290
 remember that the acrylic paints that 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.110
 I'm using are water paints 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:02.200
 so when you finish using the 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:04.740
 brush you just have to wash it with 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.740
 Water 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.820
 two 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.750
 to paint the cream on the part 

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:26.050
 top use a water-based paint 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:28.690
 acrylic white old moistened 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:32.170
 the whole region so that it is well 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:36.099
 moistened the wood and then with the same 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:39.430
 brush just touch the tip on the 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:43.360
 brown that I used previously with that 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:46.720
 I was painting certain waves to generate 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:49.150
 the volume of the cream simply raisins 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:52.299
 several times to one side to the other and 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:56.140
 that way you're going to vanish the color 

00:02:52.299 --> 00:03:00.050
 brown with the old white blur what 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:03.320
 well so that it is well well soft 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:06.320
 I kept drawing the waves to generate 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:09.950
 more volumes in the cream and that is 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:14.030
 with a 3d effect I repeated the same system 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:18.010
 around the perimeter I placed brown and 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:18.010
 it fades with the old white 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.170
 two 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:46.400
 to make it more decorative take the 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:49.280
 same brush eta synthetic and with my 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:53.280
 favorite color the aquamarine I made a 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:55.850
 stripe under the brown paint 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.850
 and 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:06.270
 and if you want to turn your cupcake into 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:09.000
 blackboard here I leave the formula so that 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:11.660
 make your own homemade paint for 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.660
 blackboard 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:18.470
 mix the acrylic paint well 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:20.989
 color I wanted with plaster and water until 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:22.460
 that all lumps were well dissolved 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:25.550
 and ready 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:28.450
 I have finished my homemade painting 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.450
 for blackboard 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:34.100
 now all that remains is to apply it 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:37.700
 on the surface with an eta brush 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:40.150
 Gentle let dry and then the second 

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:40.150
 hand 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:52.610
 to decorate the cream with the same 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:57.290
 flat brush and the colors that you most 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:05:01.900
 like you are making many hairlines and 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:01.900
 very nice and contrasting colors 

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:04.990
 two 

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:09.420
 two 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:21.110
 When everything is dry, sand a little 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:24.400
 the sense of the grain of the wood for 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:24.400
 give vintage effect 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.600
 I leave you my idea then so that 

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:30.580
 recycle all the ways you have in 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.620
 your house and you can decorate your kitchen 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:35.040
