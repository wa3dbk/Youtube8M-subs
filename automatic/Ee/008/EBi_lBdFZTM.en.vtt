00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:25.119

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.850
 I'm the guy from google fuck off 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:30.340

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:33.129
 Let's learn how to do the arcane. 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:35.620
 pigeon or week book of the ex-doctor to 2 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:38.620
 we will also learn how to make the obelisk 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.870
 neutral essence altar used in the 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.450
 altar traffic that I explained as 

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:46.239
 does in the previous video that is in the 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:48.760
 description of this video so let's go 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:50.920
 first mount this structure we will 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.410
 use two stone bricks and a brick 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:56.020
 of stone worked on top and let's 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:58.390
 repeat this on the other side leaving 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:01.140
 three blocks of space between them 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.140
 thus 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:21.590
 ready now we will put an obelisk in the 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:25.030
 half the obelisk if so do you 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.030

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.910
 right-click to open the 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:33.490
 obelisk 

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:36.590
 in doing so you have seen this interface 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:41.170
 you can put it in here only 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.170
 these items to generate neutral essence 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.820
 this bucket with blue liquid is that 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:49.130
 water that you find in the world of 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:55.490
 game just pick it up with a bucket and 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:57.470
 put in it is the item that 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.500
 generates more neutral essence 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:02.660
 see the next video that will explain how 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.690
 collect this essence and store it in a 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:08.030
 battery or send to the altar kraft 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.880

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.940
 put two blocks on the tip of the 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:26.890
 also place a frame in the 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.890
 top and a book inside the frame 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:34.860
