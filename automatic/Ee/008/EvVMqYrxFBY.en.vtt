00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
it's easier if you start with straight

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.609 
it's easier if you start with straight
hair<00:00:25.910> so<00:00:26.910> I'm<00:00:27.000> starting<00:00:27.510> with<00:00:27.779> sectioning<00:00:28.590> my

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
hair so I'm starting with sectioning my

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:31.130 
hair so I'm starting with sectioning my
hair<00:00:28.769> and<00:00:29.279> the<00:00:29.429> front<00:00:29.670> part<00:00:30.000> you're<00:00:30.599> gonna<00:00:30.750> put

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
hair and the front part you're gonna put

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.740 
hair and the front part you're gonna put
it<00:00:31.230> on<00:00:31.349> either<00:00:31.560> side<00:00:31.949> you<00:00:32.160> prefer<00:00:32.600> almost<00:00:33.600> in

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
it on either side you prefer almost in

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.030 
it on either side you prefer almost in
the<00:00:33.840> middle<00:00:33.870> but<00:00:34.290> not<00:00:34.350> too<00:00:34.649> much

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
the middle but not too much

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.830 
the middle but not too much
make<00:00:35.309> sure<00:00:35.430> you<00:00:35.670> section<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.180> back<00:00:36.360> part<00:00:36.630> on

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
make sure you section the back part on

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.450 
make sure you section the back part on
the<00:00:36.960> opposite<00:00:37.440> side<00:00:37.680> so<00:00:37.710> it<00:00:38.040> gives<00:00:38.219> more

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
the opposite side so it gives more

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.520 
the opposite side so it gives more
volume<00:00:38.670> and<00:00:39.390> then<00:00:39.600> I'm<00:00:39.899> just<00:00:39.930> going<00:00:40.170> to<00:00:40.350> take<00:00:40.500> a
