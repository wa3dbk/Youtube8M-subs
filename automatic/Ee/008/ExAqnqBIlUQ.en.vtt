then I took the trailer apart by taking

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.200 
then I took the trailer apart by taking
a<00:00:13.679> pin<00:00:13.920> out<00:00:14.070> right<00:00:14.280> there<00:00:14.490> that<00:00:14.820> one<00:00:14.940> had<00:00:15.059> to<00:00:15.089> be

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
a pin out right there that one had to be

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:16.970 
a pin out right there that one had to be
drilled<00:00:15.509> out<00:00:15.719> and<00:00:16.020> then<00:00:16.680> there<00:00:16.830> was<00:00:16.949> another

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
drilled out and then there was another

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.890 
drilled out and then there was another
pin<00:00:17.460> holding<00:00:17.880> the<00:00:17.940> hydraulic<00:00:18.449> cylinder<00:00:18.810> on

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
pin holding the hydraulic cylinder on

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.349 
pin holding the hydraulic cylinder on
right<00:00:19.109> here<00:00:19.410> and<00:00:19.590> that<00:00:20.189> one<00:00:20.400> just<00:00:20.760> had<00:00:21.210> to<00:00:21.270> be

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
right here and that one just had to be

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.730 
right here and that one just had to be
pulled<00:00:21.600> out<00:00:21.720> with<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:21.930> pliers<00:00:24.470> the<00:00:25.470> biggest

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
pulled out with the pliers the biggest

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.019 
pulled out with the pliers the biggest
thing<00:00:25.859> I<00:00:25.949> wanted<00:00:26.160> to<00:00:26.279> accomplish<00:00:26.490> with<00:00:26.849> this

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
thing I wanted to accomplish with this

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.570 
thing I wanted to accomplish with this
project<00:00:27.240> was<00:00:27.630> to<00:00:27.660> make<00:00:27.779> the<00:00:28.140> front<00:00:28.859> hitch<00:00:29.160> area

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
project was to make the front hitch area

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.130 
project was to make the front hitch area
of<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:29.849> trailer<00:00:30.150> look<00:00:30.330> more<00:00:30.510> realistic<00:00:30.779> and

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
of the trailer look more realistic and

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.749 
of the trailer look more realistic and
so<00:00:31.230> I<00:00:31.740> was<00:00:31.890> going<00:00:32.040> to<00:00:32.099> take<00:00:32.219> out<00:00:32.369> a<00:00:32.399> lot<00:00:32.640> of

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
so I was going to take out a lot of

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.190 
so I was going to take out a lot of
metal<00:00:33.000> so<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.239> first<00:00:33.450> thing<00:00:33.600> I<00:00:33.690> did<00:00:33.840> was<00:00:33.960> drill

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
metal so the first thing I did was drill

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.130 
metal so the first thing I did was drill
a<00:00:34.230> hole<00:00:34.440> in<00:00:34.770> the<00:00:35.130> metal<00:00:35.250> so<00:00:36.000> that<00:00:36.030> I<00:00:36.180> had<00:00:36.450> a<00:00:36.780> way

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
a hole in the metal so that I had a way

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.280 
a hole in the metal so that I had a way
to<00:00:37.200> get<00:00:37.590> my<00:00:37.739> burr<00:00:37.800> in<00:00:38.190> so<00:00:39.149> that<00:00:39.300> I<00:00:39.329> could<00:00:39.629> grind

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
to get my burr in so that I could grind

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.920 
to get my burr in so that I could grind
out<00:00:40.530> all<00:00:40.739> of<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:41.129> casting<00:00:41.850> there<00:00:44.629> so<00:00:45.629> once<00:00:45.840> I

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
out all of the casting there so once I

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.360 
out all of the casting there so once I
had<00:00:46.020> the<00:00:46.110> holes<00:00:46.289> drilled<00:00:46.559> I<00:00:46.649> used<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:46.950> burr<00:00:47.100> to

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
had the holes drilled I used the burr to

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.700 
had the holes drilled I used the burr to
take<00:00:47.610> out<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:47.940> casting<00:00:48.559> anywhere<00:00:49.559> where

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
take out the casting anywhere where

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.049 
take out the casting anywhere where
there<00:00:49.860> wouldn't<00:00:50.039> be<00:00:50.160> casting<00:00:50.700> on<00:00:50.820> a<00:00:50.850> wheel

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
there wouldn't be casting on a wheel

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.330 
there wouldn't be casting on a wheel
trailer<00:00:51.559> basically<00:00:52.559> just<00:00:52.739> leaving<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.129> class

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
trailer basically just leaving the class

00:00:53.340 --> 00:01:04.280 
trailer basically just leaving the class
members

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:13.290 

you

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:13.300 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.310 

one-side<00:01:14.300> removes<00:01:14.600> the<00:01:14.750> material<00:01:15.170> that<00:01:15.260> I

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
one-side removes the material that I

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.950 
one-side removes the material that I
wanted<00:01:15.620> to<00:01:15.680> I<00:01:15.950> used<00:01:16.190> a<00:01:16.430> grinding<00:01:17.330> stone<00:01:17.510> to

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
wanted to I used a grinding stone to

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.690 
wanted to I used a grinding stone to
kind<00:01:18.200> of<00:01:18.260> smooth<00:01:18.530> the<00:01:18.740> surface<00:01:18.950> up<00:01:19.340> make<00:01:19.580> it

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
kind of smooth the surface up make it

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.760 
kind of smooth the surface up make it
look<00:01:19.820> a<00:01:19.850> little<00:01:19.940> bit<00:01:20.180> better<00:01:20.380> there<00:01:21.380> was<00:01:21.530> still

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
look a little bit better there was still

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.950 
look a little bit better there was still
some<00:01:21.920> imperfections<00:01:22.550> in<00:01:22.700> it<00:01:22.820> but<00:01:23.000> I<00:01:23.030> kind<00:01:23.870> of

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
some imperfections in it but I kind of

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.740 
some imperfections in it but I kind of
just<00:01:24.140> figured<00:01:24.440> that<00:01:24.850> after<00:01:25.850> I<00:01:25.880> painted<00:01:26.300> it<00:01:26.480> the

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
just figured that after I painted it the

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.090 
just figured that after I painted it the
paint<00:01:26.960> would<00:01:27.050> kind<00:01:27.290> of<00:01:27.380> run<00:01:27.560> into<00:01:27.770> the<00:01:27.860> cracks

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:28.100 
paint would kind of run into the cracks

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.980 
paint would kind of run into the cracks
and<00:01:28.340> stuff<00:01:28.460> and<00:01:28.730> it<00:01:28.820> would<00:01:28.910> make<00:01:29.030> it<00:01:29.090> make<00:01:29.870> it

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
and stuff and it would make it make it

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:40.310 
and stuff and it would make it make it
look<00:01:30.140> pretty<00:01:30.350> smooth

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.870 

here's<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:41.010> trailer<00:01:41.190> with<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.490> front<00:01:41.730> two

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
here's the trailer with the front two

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.120 
here's the trailer with the front two
sections<00:01:42.300> removed<00:01:42.720> I<00:01:42.960> still<00:01:43.470> have<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:43.740> do<00:01:43.860> the

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
sections removed I still have to do the

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.910 
sections removed I still have to do the
kind<00:01:44.940> of<00:01:45.030> back<00:01:45.240> section<00:01:45.750> if<00:01:45.870> you<00:01:45.990> will<00:01:46.200> but

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
kind of back section if you will but

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.650 
kind of back section if you will but
it's<00:01:47.310> looking<00:01:47.490> a<00:01:47.640> lot<00:01:47.730> better<00:01:47.790> already<00:01:48.270> a<00:01:48.420> lot

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:48.660 
it's looking a lot better already a lot

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:50.060 
it's looking a lot better already a lot
more<00:01:48.840> realistic<00:01:49.140> I<00:01:49.470> just<00:01:49.650> kinda<00:01:49.860> have<00:01:49.950> to

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
more realistic I just kinda have to

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.740 
more realistic I just kinda have to
smooth<00:01:50.310> it<00:01:50.430> out<00:01:50.520> a<00:01:50.580> little<00:01:50.760> bit<00:01:50.910> here<00:01:51.600> I'm

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
smooth it out a little bit here I'm

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.960 
smooth it out a little bit here I'm
drilling<00:01:51.960> the<00:01:52.200> hole<00:01:52.380> to<00:01:53.040> go<00:01:53.490> into<00:01:53.670> that<00:01:53.760> back

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
drilling the hole to go into that back

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.640 
drilling the hole to go into that back
section<00:01:54.240> this<00:01:54.510> will<00:01:54.630> be<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.840> last<00:01:55.050> area<00:01:55.470> that

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:55.650 
section this will be the last area that

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:12.600 
section this will be the last area that
I<00:01:55.710> need<00:01:55.860> to<00:01:55.980> remove<00:01:56.250> casting<00:01:56.790> from

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.000 

I<00:02:12.730> also<00:02:13.570> decided<00:02:14.020> that<00:02:14.200> I<00:02:14.260> was<00:02:14.440> going<00:02:14.590> to<00:02:14.740> use

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
I also decided that I was going to use

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:16.650 
I also decided that I was going to use
different<00:02:15.490> wheels<00:02:15.640> for<00:02:15.970> this<00:02:16.090> trailer<00:02:16.300> then

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
different wheels for this trailer then

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.390 
different wheels for this trailer then
they<00:02:16.900> more<00:02:17.170> than<00:02:17.290> likely<00:02:17.470> have<00:02:17.710> an<00:02:17.830> axle<00:02:18.220> and

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
they more than likely have an axle and

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.840 
they more than likely have an axle and
so<00:02:19.150> I<00:02:19.180> cut<00:02:19.870> the<00:02:20.110> pegs<00:02:20.680> off<00:02:21.010> of<00:02:21.220> the<00:02:21.400> trailer

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:21.850 
so I cut the pegs off of the trailer

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:37.080 
so I cut the pegs off of the trailer
that<00:02:21.880> the<00:02:22.750> original<00:02:23.350> tires<00:02:24.160> were<00:02:24.520> on

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.910 

here's<00:02:37.600> the<00:02:37.720> trailer<00:02:37.900> after<00:02:38.140> I<00:02:38.319> finish<00:02:38.620> taking

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
here's the trailer after I finish taking

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:40.110 
here's the trailer after I finish taking
all<00:02:39.040> the<00:02:39.130> metal<00:02:39.370> off<00:02:39.520> I<00:02:39.700> also<00:02:39.850> took<00:02:40.000> the

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
all the metal off I also took the

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.870 
all the metal off I also took the
hydraulic<00:02:40.840> cylinder<00:02:41.230> off<00:02:41.380> by<00:02:41.760> drilling<00:02:42.760> out

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:42.880 
hydraulic cylinder off by drilling out

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.790 
hydraulic cylinder off by drilling out
another<00:02:43.120> pin<00:02:43.390> there<00:02:43.660> because<00:02:44.290> I'm<00:02:44.440> planning

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
another pin there because I'm planning

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.230 
another pin there because I'm planning
on<00:02:44.890> repainting<00:02:45.430> the<00:02:45.520> trailer<00:02:45.880> and<00:02:46.030> I<00:02:46.060> didn't

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:46.240 
on repainting the trailer and I didn't

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:48.330 
on repainting the trailer and I didn't
want<00:02:46.390> to<00:02:46.450> paint<00:02:46.569> the<00:02:46.720> cylinder<00:02:47.110> so<00:02:48.010> that<00:02:48.040> like

product<00:02:49.750> of<00:02:49.870> it<00:02:50.050> that's<00:02:50.410> pretty<00:02:50.650> well<00:02:50.830> cleaned

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.490

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
paint it's a thin paint it's kind of

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.430 
paint it's a thin paint it's kind of
like<00:03:18.820> the<00:03:19.000> flat<00:03:19.330> blacks<00:03:19.600> and<00:03:19.930> stuff<00:03:20.140> like<00:03:20.260> that

they're<00:03:20.620> really<00:03:20.769> thin<00:03:21.100> and<00:03:21.130> so<00:03:21.459> I'd<00:03:22.060> ended<00:03:22.330> up

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
they're really thin and so I'd ended up

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:24.059 
they're really thin and so I'd ended up
taking<00:03:22.600> about<00:03:22.780> three<00:03:23.260> coats<00:03:23.470> and<00:03:23.800> it<00:03:23.860> still

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:26.699 
taking about three coats and it still
isn't<00:03:24.220> perfect<00:03:24.489> but<00:03:25.050> -<00:03:26.050> about<00:03:26.200> what<00:03:26.470> I<00:03:26.500> was
