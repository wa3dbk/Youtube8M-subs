00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:06.569
 absolutely not to miss the six days 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.639
 revival historical re-enactment of the six 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.219
 days organized by motodays is in 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.139
 collaboration with moto club rome in 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:16.199
 occasion of its centenary 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.270
 lamberto poggi sports event 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.640
 advisor of the motoclub and rome then 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.400
 you have organized this beautiful thing 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.470
 let's recall times that were here 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.810
 let's talk about the six days revival 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.840
 then he sat at the goal because 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.160
 this year marks the centenary 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.280
 centenary of an event that 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.840
 consider from the Olympics of the bike 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:40.530
 because in the field of off-road it is 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:45.480
 certainly the longest and most tiring race 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:47.219
 especially interesting for the teams 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.140
 because clearly it is not alone 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.989
 individual ranking but there is a 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.750
 prestigious trophy that is passed by 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.730
 year by year by a national team ad 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.489
 another is there 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.829
 the trophy is basically a race that 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.530
 yes it runs in six Italian drivers or 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.409
 the nation pavilions and there are some 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:11.700
 rankings that clearly come later 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:14.820
 six very hard days and that's a lot 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:18.420
 prestigious is normally done in 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.729
 different countries of the world because all 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.340
 countries almost all the countries where you run 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.660
 we say in the big off-road vehicle there is 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.110
 were editions of the six 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:31.130
 days and the first road in England 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:34.740
 in 1913 and this year we have 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:38.820
 great honor to have the hundredth 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:41.190
 in italy together with this occasion 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.259
 in conjunction with the 100 years of the 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.869
 motoclub in Rome because we do 100 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.750
 years also this year the idea of 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:51.420
 present this as a motorbike 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.770
 but this beautiful thing will tell me 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.830
 I want to know even if there is any 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.619
 pilot who really ran we have the 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.509
 Real series drivers we have real pilots 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.009
 we never know anyone there 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.619
 let's get to know why we are not 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.840
 there are so many because unfortunately they are 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.880
 mostly from the north 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.130
 but in short someone we have succeeded in 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:15.380
 bring it and you will see that you will not be 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:15.380
 disappointed also on the track thanks lamberto

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.200
 six days I saw you run 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:04.560

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:08.069
 kid on the bike a good be like 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:12.540

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.290

 Italian motorcycle federation wants to 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:30.230
