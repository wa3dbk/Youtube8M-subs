00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
roasting machine comes with this little

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.990 
roasting machine comes with this little
cub<00:00:40.829> and<00:00:41.129> it<00:00:41.309> says<00:00:41.520> to<00:00:41.730> use<00:00:41.940> four<00:00:42.710> scoops<00:00:44.000> so

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
cub and it says to use four scoops so

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.560 
cub and it says to use four scoops so
now<00:00:45.559> puts<00:00:46.559> us<00:00:46.680> on<00:00:46.860> top<00:00:48.800> here<00:00:49.800> and<00:00:50.010> then<00:00:50.570> click

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
now puts us on top here and then click

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.200 
now puts us on top here and then click
the<00:00:51.600> lid<00:00:51.960> this<00:00:52.199> little<00:00:52.500> thing<00:00:52.680> collects<00:00:53.399> chafe

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
the lid this little thing collects chafe

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.760 
the lid this little thing collects chafe
that<00:00:54.570> burns<00:00:55.530> off<00:00:55.800> of<00:00:55.980> the<00:00:56.070> things<00:00:57.109> I<00:00:58.109> collects

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
that burns off of the things I collects

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.290 
that burns off of the things I collects
it<00:00:58.949> in<00:00:59.070> a<00:00:59.100> nice<00:00:59.250> way<00:00:59.399> so<00:00:59.550> you<00:00:59.820> can<00:00:59.969> throw<00:01:00.120> them

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
it in a nice way so you can throw them

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.200 
it in a nice way so you can throw them
out<00:01:01.070> the<00:01:02.070> controls<00:01:02.520> of<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.789> roaster

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
out the controls of the roaster

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.289 
out the controls of the roaster
basically<00:01:03.989> have<00:01:04.229> it<00:01:04.379> can<00:01:04.530> a<00:01:04.979> knob<00:01:05.519> for<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:05.970> fan

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
basically have it can a knob for the fan

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.740 
basically have it can a knob for the fan
and<00:01:06.600> then<00:01:07.729> low<00:01:08.729> medium<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.180> high<00:01:09.270> for<00:01:09.659> the

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
and then low medium and high for the

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.570 
and then low medium and high for the
temperature<00:01:10.170> it<00:01:10.470> seems<00:01:10.710> like<00:01:10.920> you<00:01:10.950> always<00:01:11.280> use

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
temperature it seems like you always use

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.429 
temperature it seems like you always use
high<00:01:11.790> temperature<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:12.630> it's<00:01:12.900> a<00:01:13.020> general<00:01:13.320> good

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
high temperature and it's a general good

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.859 
high temperature and it's a general good
idea<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:13.979> have<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.400> speed<00:01:14.670> of<00:01:15.299> the<00:01:15.479> fan<00:01:15.659> on

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
idea to have the speed of the fan on

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.350 
idea to have the speed of the fan on
high<00:01:16.110> and<00:01:16.409> other<00:01:17.369> than<00:01:17.490> that<00:01:17.610> you<00:01:17.850> just<00:01:18.119> push

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
high and other than that you just push

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.370 
high and other than that you just push
the<00:01:18.570> start<00:01:19.350> button<00:01:20.090> well<00:01:21.090> actually<00:01:21.689> you<00:01:22.080> just

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
the start button well actually you just

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.109 
the start button well actually you just
push<00:01:22.979> this<00:01:23.100> up<00:01:23.250> too<00:01:23.400> high<00:01:23.549> and<00:01:23.850> then<00:01:23.970> it's

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
push this up too high and then it's

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.590 
push this up too high and then it's
ready<00:01:24.299> to<00:01:24.479> go<00:01:24.659> I<00:01:25.259> have<00:01:26.070> this<00:01:26.189> placed<00:01:26.490> under<00:01:26.970> my

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
ready to go I have this placed under my

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.050 
ready to go I have this placed under my
kitchen<00:01:28.140> vent<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:28.650> the<00:01:29.430> reason<00:01:29.549> for<00:01:29.729> that<00:01:29.880> is

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
kitchen vent and the reason for that is

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.789 
kitchen vent and the reason for that is
because<00:01:30.090> it<00:01:30.450> does<00:01:30.600> give<00:01:30.810> off<00:01:30.960> kind<00:01:31.200> of<00:01:31.320> unusual

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
because it does give off kind of unusual

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.359 
because it does give off kind of unusual
odor<00:01:33.350> which<00:01:34.350> kind<00:01:34.619> of<00:01:34.680> permeates<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.220> house

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
odor which kind of permeates the house

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.370 
odor which kind of permeates the house
it's<00:01:35.670> not<00:01:35.729> wholly<00:01:36.150> unpleasant<00:01:36.570> or<00:01:36.960> terrible

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
it's not wholly unpleasant or terrible

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.740 
it's not wholly unpleasant or terrible
but<00:01:37.590> it<00:01:38.369> is<00:01:38.520> noticeable<00:01:38.939> so<00:01:39.299> if<00:01:39.390> you<00:01:39.479> put<00:01:39.659> it

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
but it is noticeable so if you put it

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.749 
but it is noticeable so if you put it
under<00:01:39.960> event<00:01:40.320> that<00:01:40.560> helps<00:01:40.860> reduce<00:01:41.460> that

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
under event that helps reduce that

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.660 
under event that helps reduce that
another<00:01:42.570> thing<00:01:42.899> you<00:01:43.020> can<00:01:43.200> do<00:01:43.350> is<00:01:43.470> just<00:01:43.670> open

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
another thing you can do is just open

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.010 
another thing you can do is just open
all<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:44.880> windows<00:01:44.970> in<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.390> house<00:01:45.570> when<00:01:45.869> you're

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
all the windows in the house when you're

00:01:46.020 --> 00:02:06.399 
all the windows in the house when you're
roasting<00:01:46.470> if<00:01:46.860> it's<00:01:46.979> not<00:01:47.159> too<00:01:47.340> cold<00:01:47.520> outside

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:06.409 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:32.370 

you<00:02:06.649> can<00:02:06.829> change<00:02:07.070> this<00:02:07.369> by<00:02:07.670> an

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:32.380 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:35.860 

so<00:02:33.380> once<00:02:33.650> it's<00:02:33.860> done<00:02:34.070> you<00:02:34.850> basically<00:02:35.060> take<00:02:35.720> the

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
so once it's done you basically take the

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.310 
so once it's done you basically take the
top<00:02:36.110> off<00:02:36.140> here<00:02:36.740> it<00:02:36.890> can<00:02:37.100> be<00:02:37.640> a<00:02:37.670> little<00:02:37.850> bit<00:02:38.030> hot

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
top off here it can be a little bit hot

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:43.750 
top off here it can be a little bit hot
and<00:02:41.560> inside<00:02:42.560> you<00:02:42.590> can<00:02:42.920> see<00:02:42.950> kind<00:02:43.340> of<00:02:43.460> some<00:02:43.640> of

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
and inside you can see kind of some of

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.630 
and inside you can see kind of some of
the<00:02:43.820> chief<00:02:44.120> so<00:02:44.920> you<00:02:45.920> basically<00:02:46.070> can<00:02:46.460> take

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
the chief so you basically can take

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.400 
the chief so you basically can take
these<00:02:46.760> things<00:02:47.030> apart<00:02:47.330> and<00:02:47.420> clean<00:02:47.660> it<00:02:47.690> off<00:02:47.960> and

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
these things apart and clean it off and

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:55.960 
these things apart and clean it off and
then<00:02:49.870> the<00:02:50.870> beans<00:02:51.110> goes<00:02:51.830> into<00:02:52.190> a<00:02:54.580> vacuum<00:02:55.580> seal

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
then the beans goes into a vacuum seal

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:01.210 
then the beans goes into a vacuum seal
and<00:02:57.070> I<00:02:58.070> hear<00:02:58.430> that<00:02:58.960> their<00:02:59.960> best<00:03:00.710> after<00:03:01.190> a

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:01.220 
and I hear that their best after a

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.420 
and I hear that their best after a
