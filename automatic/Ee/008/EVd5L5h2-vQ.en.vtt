00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:09.290
 we are there guys with another video of 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:14.160
 project with gps and 9 all forged tek 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:16.139
 F400 and I will show you today 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.410
 work that is done in the tank's 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.720
 where we put two exits apart from 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:27.840
 since we are going to work with 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:29.039
 two 1036 pumps with 200 pounds 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.820
 hours 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:35.700
 so I need an exit space 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.040
 more reason to do so. 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.590
 work in welding oxygen with you 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:50.460
 can observe that the so-called weld 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:55.010
 with approximately 14 thousand 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:01:05.850
 internally and externally they measure 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:01:10.140
 15.9mm in 2006 have an idea of ​​the 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:12.900
 good size diameter and a good reason 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.850
 How to get treatment at 14 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.470
 I'll try to show you here the rate 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.810
 tank interior 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:24.090
 after it the tank being washed 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:27.450
 carbonized and avoid the possibility of 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.610
 personal explosion to decarbonize nato 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.780
 that they usually call car and 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.610
 laying on the tank exhaust 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.130
 so the technician will get good goods 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.829
 warm internally thereby drying 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.090
 all fuel and thereby preventing 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:46.770
 the explosion 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:53.820
 the motion for you here the inner part 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:02:01.610
 you look and it was very clean 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:02:01.610
 after cleaning and there are levels 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:12.979
 you can show you 

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:22.950
 Now you can see there are the books 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:24.480
 soldiers from the inside and stood 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.910
 little thing inside 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:30.660
 since the sale of the entire share and 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:32.549
 with the oxygen solder 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:36.090
 The less they stay in there. 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:38.970
 best to get the most 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.470
 possible even the car 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.910
 being low fuel level 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.430
 in the tank 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:48.299
 some blotches and rust that is 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:51.230
 have been made due to rinse the 

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:54.359
 tank as putting fuel still 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:58.410
 sometimes they appear with chances but 

00:02:54.359 --> 00:03:02.879
 soon put the fuel still left 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:06.480
 That's it folks but the extreme item 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:09.920
 importance of the project tap as it arrives 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.920
 original gt s goal 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:21.980
 the time has information that will volks 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:30.000
 analyze right 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:39.030
 now appeared the rubber and the original and 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:44.190
 mount volkswagen the tank in good 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:49.739
 no dents and conservation status 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:52.340
 now just play some paint qna 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:57.540
 works to prevent the outbreak by ju 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:04:02.490
 a spray of black paint already solves 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.490
 Ok everybody is this, thanks
