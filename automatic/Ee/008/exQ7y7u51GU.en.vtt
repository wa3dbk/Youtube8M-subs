building multiple pylons I haven't bring
that<00:02:06.360> out<00:02:06.509> yet<00:02:06.720> in<00:02:06.840> this<00:02:06.899> happen<00:02:07.320> because<00:02:07.500> I

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
that out yet in this happen because I

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.979 
that out yet in this happen because I
apparently<00:02:07.979> do<00:02:08.340> not<00:02:08.369> use<00:02:09.060> them<00:02:11.780> let's<00:02:12.780> skip

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
apparently do not use them let's skip

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:15.290 
apparently do not use them let's skip
ahead<00:02:13.020> in<00:02:13.380> a<00:02:13.590> little<00:02:13.890> bit<00:02:14.010> into<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:14.370> game<00:02:14.580> show

you okay there I am I've just figured

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.280 
you okay there I am I've just figured
out<00:02:19.530> that<00:02:19.770> you<00:02:20.700> can<00:02:20.880> use<00:02:21.150> the<00:02:21.750> probes<00:02:22.050> and

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
out that you can use the probes and

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.840 
out that you can use the probes and
build<00:02:22.560> multiple<00:02:22.920> buildings<00:02:23.220> at<00:02:23.489> one<00:02:23.640> time

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
build multiple buildings at one time

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.170 
build multiple buildings at one time
with<00:02:24.840> Tosh<00:02:25.320> Zerg<00:02:25.830> and<00:02:26.130> taryn<00:02:26.520> it<00:02:26.760> works<00:02:27.000> all

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
with Tosh Zerg and taryn it works all

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.350 
with Tosh Zerg and taryn it works all

hackers seeing how they're very lazy you
may<00:02:42.120> not<00:02:42.269> think<00:02:42.330> that<00:02:42.570> this<00:02:42.780> hasn't<00:02:43.170> much<00:02:43.470> of

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
may not think that this hasn't much of

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.170 
may not think that this hasn't much of
an<00:02:43.709> advantage<00:02:43.799> over<00:02:44.190> most<00:02:44.459> Starcraft<00:02:44.940> players
