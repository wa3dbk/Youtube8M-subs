 massacre in the city of hula calling it an act 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:25.199
 disgusted at the stack 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:26.340

 this call for peace is not addressed 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:41.579

 people continue to die according to 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.250
 opposition to the victims of the latter

 Assad troops reapplied heavy 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.600
 residential weapon 

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:07.030
 quarters apparently these frames were 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:09.820

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.049
 tank attacks on the city of Hula 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.180

 between the carnage in the Hooley condemned 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:30.610
 and Russia is still remaining 

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:32.500
 the last ally of the regime in Syria with 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.210
 this Moscow laid the responsibility and 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.789
 on the Syrian rebels 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:39.850

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:46.149
 addressed as the Syrian government 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:47.740
 so and the armed opposition she intends 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:49.390
 meet with Syrian members 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.940
 governments and with the country's president 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.640
 bashar assad however most 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.590
 Syrians do not believe any truce is not 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.439
 in implementing at least some 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:02.259
 peace plan part of the opposition requires 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:04.329
 stop al-assad using military force 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:06.880
 but such measures are not in any way 

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:09.299
 stipulated by the UN Security Council statement
