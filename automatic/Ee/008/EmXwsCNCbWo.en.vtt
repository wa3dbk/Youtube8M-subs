going<00:00:32.910> to<00:00:33.030> trash<00:00:33.300> him<00:00:33.480> so<00:00:34.230> the<00:00:34.320> advantage<00:00:34.620> with

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
going to trash him so the advantage with

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.740 
going to trash him so the advantage with
artificial<00:00:35.460> baits<00:00:35.640> is<00:00:35.850> that<00:00:36.030> you<00:00:36.120> can<00:00:36.270> give<00:00:36.510> a

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
artificial baits is that you can give a

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.920 
artificial baits is that you can give a
bait<00:00:37.410> that<00:00:37.649> looks<00:00:37.890> identical<00:00:38.629> it's<00:00:39.629> about<00:00:39.809> how

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
bait that looks identical it's about how

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.389 
bait that looks identical it's about how
many<00:00:39.989> times<00:00:40.290> those<00:00:40.530> small<00:00:40.980> fish<00:00:41.160> are<00:00:41.190> going<00:00:41.309> to

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
many times those small fish are going to

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:42.530 
many times those small fish are going to
pick<00:00:41.550> it<00:00:41.579> up<00:00:41.700> it's<00:00:41.910> still<00:00:42.090> going<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.329> look

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
pick it up it's still going to look

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.369 
pick it up it's still going to look
perfect

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
perfect

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.080 
perfect
and<00:00:43.800> it<00:00:43.950> means<00:00:44.070> when<00:00:44.250> attention<00:00:44.550> comes<00:00:44.789> along

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
and it means when attention comes along

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.060 
and it means when attention comes along
it's<00:00:45.600> not<00:00:45.750> another<00:00:45.960> difference<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.950> other

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
it's not another difference the other

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.709 
it's not another difference the other
advantage<00:00:47.550> is<00:00:47.579> they're<00:00:47.820> buoyant<00:00:48.210> so<00:00:48.480> you<00:00:48.570> can

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
advantage is they're buoyant so you can

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.049 
advantage is they're buoyant so you can
correctly<00:00:49.079> balance<00:00:49.500> them<00:00:49.800> so<00:00:50.370> once<00:00:50.850> you've

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
correctly balance them so once you've

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.880 
correctly balance them so once you've
done<00:00:51.210> it<00:00:51.270> on<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.840> first<00:00:52.079> time<00:00:52.320> you<00:00:52.559> always<00:00:52.770> got

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
done it on the first time you always got

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.200 
done it on the first time you always got
a<00:00:52.920> test<00:00:53.129> in<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.370> margins<00:00:53.730> just<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:54.030> make<00:00:54.180> sure

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
a test in the margins just to make sure

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.510 
a test in the margins just to make sure
that<00:00:54.570> it's<00:00:54.690> sitting<00:00:54.870> correctly<00:00:55.340> but<00:00:56.340> once

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
that it's sitting correctly but once

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.520 
that it's sitting correctly but once
you've<00:00:56.699> done<00:00:56.730> that<00:00:56.940> every<00:00:57.660> time<00:00:57.870> you<00:00:58.020> cast<00:00:58.260> out

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
you've done that every time you cast out

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.979 
you've done that every time you cast out
it<00:00:58.770> gives<00:00:58.949> you<00:00:59.070> perfect<00:00:59.340> presentation<00:01:00.270> so

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
it gives you perfect presentation so

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.410 
it gives you perfect presentation so
there<00:01:01.140> you<00:01:01.199> go<00:01:01.320> out<00:01:01.500> official<00:01:01.859> baits<00:01:02.420> small

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
there you go out official baits small

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.090 
there you go out official baits small
fish<00:01:03.600> proof<00:01:03.899> and<00:01:04.680> give<00:01:04.949> you<00:01:05.010> a<00:01:05.040> great

fishing these big gravel pits generally

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.649 
fishing these big gravel pits generally
they're<00:01:10.590> very<00:01:10.770> very<00:01:10.890> weedy<00:01:11.450> so<00:01:12.450> what<00:01:12.570> I'm

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
they're very very weedy so what I'm

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.060 
they're very very weedy so what I'm
looking<00:01:12.780> to<00:01:12.990> do<00:01:13.110> is<00:01:13.140> try<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:13.380> find<00:01:13.500> a<00:01:13.740> clear

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
looking to do is try and find a clear

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.060 
looking to do is try and find a clear
patch<00:01:14.340> so<00:01:15.060> looking<00:01:15.360> for<00:01:15.479> gravel<00:01:15.810> bars<00:01:16.070> silty

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
patch so looking for gravel bars silty

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.380 
patch so looking for gravel bars silty
areas<00:01:17.460> some<00:01:17.640> whether<00:01:17.820> you<00:01:17.909> can<00:01:18.000> present<00:01:18.299> a

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
areas some whether you can present a

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.450 
areas some whether you can present a
bait<00:01:18.540> effectively<00:01:19.140> so<00:01:19.830> I<00:01:19.860> generally<00:01:20.040> do<00:01:20.340> is

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
bait effectively so I generally do is

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.640 
bait effectively so I generally do is
get<00:01:20.700> their<00:01:20.909> cast<00:01:21.509> out<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.780> marker<00:01:22.049> float<00:01:22.259> find

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
get their cast out the marker float find

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.350 
get their cast out the marker float find
that<00:01:22.799> spot<00:01:23.159> and<00:01:23.280> then<00:01:23.369> clip<00:01:23.670> that<00:01:23.880> line<00:01:24.119> up

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
that spot and then clip that line up

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.270 
that spot and then clip that line up
I'll<00:01:24.540> then<00:01:24.780> pace<00:01:25.140> it<00:01:25.320> out<00:01:25.409> do<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:25.920> same<00:01:26.130> with

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
I'll then pace it out do the same with

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.070 
I'll then pace it out do the same with
the<00:01:26.400> spod<00:01:26.670> rod<00:01:26.700> but<00:01:27.270> I'll<00:01:27.330> generally<00:01:27.570> take<00:01:27.840> off

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
the spod rod but I'll generally take off

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.749 
the spod rod but I'll generally take off
a<00:01:28.110> little<00:01:28.320> bit<00:01:28.500> as<00:01:28.619> well<00:01:28.829> as<00:01:29.250> you<00:01:29.430> got<00:01:29.520> allowed

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
for the drop of the lead spot the bait

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.740 
for the drop of the lead spot the bait
out<00:01:31.890> get<00:01:32.400> your<00:01:32.520> marker<00:01:32.820> float<00:01:33.030> pace<00:01:33.450> it<00:01:33.630> out

out get your marker float pace it out

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.810 
out get your marker float pace it out
and<00:01:33.990> you<00:01:34.259> do<00:01:34.409> that<00:01:34.560> with<00:01:34.619> your<00:01:34.860> other<00:01:35.009> rods<00:01:35.310> and

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
and you do that with your other rods and

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.580 
and you do that with your other rods and
what<00:01:35.970> I'll<00:01:36.090> then<00:01:36.240> do<00:01:36.420> is<00:01:36.570> tie<00:01:36.869> a<00:01:36.900> little<00:01:37.110> little

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
what I'll then do is tie a little little

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.319 
what I'll then do is tie a little little
stop<00:01:37.950> not<00:01:38.189> about<00:01:38.579> foot<00:01:38.850> from<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.090> end<00:01:39.210> of<00:01:39.270> the

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
stop not about foot from the end of the

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.510 
stop not about foot from the end of the
rod<00:01:39.509> so<00:01:40.350> what<00:01:40.500> that<00:01:40.590> means<00:01:40.799> is<00:01:40.979> it<00:01:41.159> when<00:01:41.430> I'm

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
rod so what that means is it when I'm

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.660 
rod so what that means is it when I'm
clipped<00:01:41.759> up<00:01:41.939> can<00:01:42.899> cast<00:01:43.140> out<00:01:43.409> and<00:01:43.680> clip<00:01:44.549> the

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
clipped up can cast out and clip the

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.510 
clipped up can cast out and clip the
line<00:01:44.700> forget<00:01:45.689> a<00:01:45.720> fish<00:01:45.990> see<00:01:46.439> I<00:01:46.470> can<00:01:46.649> land<00:01:46.829> it<00:01:47.040> all

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.609 
line forget a fish see I can land it all
I<00:01:47.579> need<00:01:47.820> to<00:01:47.939> do<00:01:48.030> then<00:01:48.210> is<00:01:48.360> just<00:01:48.390> cast<00:01:49.200> anywhere

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
I need to do then is just cast anywhere

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:52.310

on the baited patch the factly where
this<00:02:00.960> is<00:02:01.170> that<00:02:01.380> once<00:02:01.799> that<00:02:01.890> stop<00:02:02.280> knots<00:02:02.460> there

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
this is that once that stop knots there

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.100 
this is that once that stop knots there
you<00:02:02.790> can<00:02:02.969> move<00:02:03.119> it<00:02:03.240> around<00:02:03.299> so<00:02:03.750> if<00:02:03.840> I<00:02:03.899> want<00:02:04.049> to

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
you can move it around so if I want to

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.170 
you can move it around so if I want to
fish<00:02:04.290> a<00:02:04.469> bait<00:02:04.680> towards<00:02:05.040> the<00:02:05.130> back<00:02:05.310> of<00:02:05.340> it<00:02:05.640> all<00:02:06.119> I

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
fish a bait towards the back of it all I

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.370 
fish a bait towards the back of it all I
need<00:02:06.360> to<00:02:06.450> do<00:02:06.540> instead<00:02:06.750> of<00:02:06.899> it<00:02:06.990> having<00:02:07.020> it<00:02:07.320> a

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
need to do instead of it having it a

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.440 
need to do instead of it having it a
foot<00:02:07.680> front<00:02:07.829> in<00:02:07.950> the<00:02:08.069> rod<00:02:08.220> four<00:02:08.970> or<00:02:09.060> five<00:02:09.209> feet

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
foot front in the rod four or five feet

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.320 
foot front in the rod four or five feet
so<00:02:10.200> they<00:02:10.289> go<00:02:10.440> accuracy<00:02:11.069> absolutely<00:02:11.849> key<00:02:12.060> if

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
so they go accuracy absolutely key if

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.990 
so they go accuracy absolutely key if
you<00:02:12.510> using<00:02:12.750> a<00:02:12.930> spotter<00:02:13.200> marker

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:17.550 
tip three is wind direction so generally

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:19.430 
tip three is wind direction so generally
