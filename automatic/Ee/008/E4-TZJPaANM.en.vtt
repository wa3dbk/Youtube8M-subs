00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
that feature so before you would go into

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.869 
that feature so before you would go into
your<00:00:35.730> hangouts<00:00:36.210> and<00:00:37.250> go<00:00:38.250> into<00:00:38.430> your<00:00:38.520> settings

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
what you do still here but before there

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.880

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
would be a little checkbox and you just

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.610 
would be a little checkbox and you just
uncheck<00:00:44.610> it<00:00:45.030> or<00:00:45.120> check<00:00:45.450> it<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.780> enable<00:00:46.020> disable

little<00:01:14.880> bit<00:01:15.030> hidden<00:01:15.240> and<00:01:15.920> I'm<00:01:16.920> sad<00:01:17.250> to<00:01:17.400> say

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
little bit hidden and I'm sad to say

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.310 
little bit hidden and I'm sad to say
that<00:01:17.850> it<00:01:18.030> actually<00:01:18.360> did<00:01:18.509> take<00:01:18.720> me<00:01:18.990> a<00:01:19.020> little

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
that it actually did take me a little

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.620 
that it actually did take me a little
bit<00:01:19.470> to<00:01:19.740> figure<00:01:19.890> out<00:01:20.130> where<00:01:20.520> it<00:01:20.700> was<00:01:20.850> because<00:01:21.390> I

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
bit to figure out where it was because I

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.330 
bit to figure out where it was because I
thought<00:01:22.200> well<00:01:22.350> maybe<00:01:22.380> it's<00:01:22.680> not<00:01:22.740> personalized

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
thought well maybe it's not personalized

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.700 
thought well maybe it's not personalized
maybe<00:01:23.700> it's<00:01:23.909> in<00:01:24.119> default<00:01:24.659> app<00:01:24.810> settings<00:01:25.439> well

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
maybe it's in default app settings well

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.039 
maybe it's in default app settings well
actually<00:01:26.580> it's<00:01:27.060> under<00:01:27.420> this<00:01:27.570> little<00:01:27.750> tab<00:01:28.020> here

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
actually it's under this little tab here

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.280 
actually it's under this little tab here
where<00:01:28.740> it<00:01:28.799> says<00:01:28.829> more<00:01:29.189> if<00:01:29.759> you<00:01:29.909> go<00:01:30.060> there<00:01:30.450> then

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
where it says more if you go there then

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.620 
where it says more if you go there then
you<00:01:31.409> see<00:01:31.560> it<00:01:31.680> default<00:01:32.430> SMS<00:01:32.759> app<00:01:33.119> so<00:01:33.329> right<00:01:33.509> now

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
you see it default SMS app so right now

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.480 
you see it default SMS app so right now
you<00:01:33.689> can<00:01:33.930> see<00:01:34.170> it's<00:01:34.439> set<00:01:34.650> to<00:01:34.829> hangouts<00:01:35.220> you

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
you can see it's set to hangouts you

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.670 
you can see it's set to hangouts you
just<00:01:36.479> move<00:01:36.630> it<00:01:36.750> over<00:01:36.810> to<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.320> one<00:01:37.470> that<00:01:37.560> you

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
just move it over to the one that you

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.679 
just move it over to the one that you
want<00:01:37.890> and<00:01:38.009> you're<00:01:38.340> done<00:01:38.610> that's<00:01:39.299> it

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
want and you're done that's it

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:42.260 
want and you're done that's it
so<00:01:40.140> you<00:01:40.200> don't<00:01:40.409> actually<00:01:40.560> have<00:01:40.979> to<00:01:41.040> go<00:01:41.460> through

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
so you don't actually have to go through

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.050 
so you don't actually have to go through
the<00:01:42.890> hangouts<00:01:43.890> app<00:01:44.070> to<00:01:44.490> get<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:44.729> that<00:01:44.880> if
