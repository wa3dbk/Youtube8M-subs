00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:05.130
 Hello dear friends and welcome to 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:08.670
 the resolution of our network image 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:14.089
 jupiter right by my side dj pauly 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:17.100
 and felix so far 

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:23.220
 First of all we had in the last one 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:24.510
 time in his network image were announced 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.980
 but in the end not quite like that 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.840
 satisfied with the pictures we have there 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.969
 had and then a little something 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:34.260
 gone wrong and actually we have 

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:36.710
 relatively terra forms I do not know if 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.690
 that would have been so interesting then 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.640
 three places in a row each 15 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.610
 would have made minutes where only terra 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.140
 shaped and always makes the same that was 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.789
 the problem with the whole is namely 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.200
 that, too, is always that 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.449
 same work that is not so now 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.559
 are lots of varied things 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:57.660
 but is always the same work and 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:59.280
 that 's easy with the time is on 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.660
 beginning to be quite interesting but with the 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.470
 Just get bored when you look 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.240
 have to look at it all and yes how 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.990
 felix already said our recording 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.890
 also went a bit wrong 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.650
 and that's why we decided 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.920
 suits the first republic have fit 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.500
 and then we just said good 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.240
 letting it to the upload 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.369
 not so many people looked at now 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:27.170
 that was not the strongest right now 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:33.329
 Looks and that's the reason why yes 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:36.930
 but we were not quite like that ourselves 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.909
 happy with how I improve 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:42.509
 So I 'll try the new one 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:44.460
 bit at that to terraforming that 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.380
 It was great because you can already see us 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.259
 have a bit with ice and snow 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:53.070
 with splatter brushes the whole one 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:55.950
 a little bit changed we say so here 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.600
 still a lot of work put in and 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.600
 Now you just wanted to do this here 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.710
 show how the last things have become 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.710
 is exactly 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.830
 in a beautiful that can skull 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:22.900
 won but only at the dragon's head 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:25.600
 skeleton about most ideas come yes 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.250
 even while you build something 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.050
 As you can see we have we too 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.090
 he goes a bit further already 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.100
 that will only be a little bit bigger 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.400
 Project where we are not yet 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:37.930
 I want to give away a lot but that's me 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.080
 was flown a direction where the 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:42.610
 transporter exactly so we last 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.769
 time or who is the last picture 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.920
 looked at certainly heard or 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:50.230
 seen that in the background there 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.110
 is a little more shaped and that is 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.390
 that has been our time labs 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:57.970
 we have finished recording now 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:03:00.780
 and she's a bit strong here 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:03.190
 strongly built on it 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:11.370
 when loading the chance not really 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:13.540
 luckily with me already gamer computer 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:16.750
 a little bit on the sat 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.400
 So we did a lot there and 

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.310
 above all, let's say right 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:24.130
 strange style that is not yet 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:28.510
 Add agennix to him now with me 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:34.810
 looks meant you mean here now 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:36.130
 the driving hunt norbert rips there we have 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.950
 as well as with quite a lot of people 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.790
 collaborated 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:44.170
 maybe you say a little something 

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:50.160
 14 people always go up to it 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:56.380
 exactly the maddies fly 

00:03:50.160 --> 00:04:02.109
 1337 by katarina witt david 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:03.800
 the calendar felix storm xd me so the 

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:09.570
 Paul II 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:11.970
 teen what then two heads of migros 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:15.380
 aare von rechnitz taken this is 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:18.030
 robert so ruby broken 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:19.370
 we also have cellar who has 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:23.970
 she did not write down 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:27.240
 we also have a blond that is that 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:29.490
 gave that is gave and asuadi this 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.520
 partly not well recognizable because just 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:34.980
 the upper one just is just missing 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:41.330
 as for example with my new skin by the way 

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:47.540
 also wants the coat of the collar 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:47.540
 Basically yes what that actually or 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:55.800
 give information to what is now in the 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:58.890
 So let's say that we are like now 

00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:02.940
 We said we are working very hard 

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:05.850
 is very intense on new things so 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:07.830
 The living room is something like this 

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:09.060
 a bit of the problem that we then too 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.860
 many things start and then so 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:13.790
 around 90 percent when you're almost there 

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:21.750
 finished on stop exactly 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:23.460
 where the participation would be so 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.750
 Consumers consistently need it then 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.940
 exactly what you already 

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:28.680
 and as i will also be at the 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:41.430
 a channel the time laptops of all 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:45.540
 link so I would say yes 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:49.410
 beautiful background that's it and yes we 

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:52.040
 see us at the next video or 

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:52.040
 back office
