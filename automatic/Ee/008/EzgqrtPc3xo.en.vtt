00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:11.610
 hello everyone good in this video we are going to 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.960
 make a little flower with a ribbon like 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.530
 you see 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:18.240
 it's very pretty it's super fast 

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:20.790
 we're going to it we just need 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.920
 a loop this is one and a half centimeters 

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:25.440
 width 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.160
 thread and needle then we have to 

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:30.390
 do I look at it like that 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:34.450
 I give him 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:37.630
 two laps is to say as if we had 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:39.970
 4 dice three times and this is the length 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:42.960
 that we have to leave on the one hand 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:42.960
 we go around like that 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.590
 and we turn 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:54.800
 behind 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:57.469
 we turn back 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:00.280
 and now all the times like this we go back to 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:00.280
 turn back 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.360
 let's say again 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.860
 and this rat if we take one end then 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.860
 the other 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:19.130
 another the other 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.409
 the other 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.250
 every time one does not have more complication 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:24.250
 that every time one 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:30.810
 behind 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.810
 behind 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.250
 A) Yes 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.100
 until we finish 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:47.410
 with one of the sides 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:48.790
 As you can see, there is no more where 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:51.970
 finish 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:55.470
 we hold them together 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:59.060
 and when you release it, this is 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:03.310
 then let's grab with the hand 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.310
 with these two fingers like this 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.819
 and the short side 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.490
 let's throw slowly so you do not 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:14.940
 escape us 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:17.569
 let's say like stretching and as you see 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.640
 it is forming 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:24.830
 a little flower 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.830
 when we are happy with how it is 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.310
 let's grab it below 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.110
 you see that it is simpler that it can not 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.110
 be 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:39.200
 you already know how to share the video subscribe 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.850
 to the good channel and when we have it already 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.500
 grabbed below we're going to take a 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.540
 thread 

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.280
 and we are going to sew it 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:49.300
 to ensure it so that we are not 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:53.670
 undo 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.670
 we passed him three or four times 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:03:01.180
 me when the past 3 or 4 times to me 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.180
 like to go down 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:08.190
 traversing the entire flower 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:10.200
 and I go back down 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.630
 but this does not need to me I like 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.910
 because I like that the flowers are 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:18.500
 tighter 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:18.500
 but this is not necessary as I say 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:23.870
 and we are passing the thread 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:35.520
 and it would simply be 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:35.520
 we can cut the excess loop 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:40.959
 then we would have a little flower 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:46.819
 this or we can leave it like that for 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:49.390
 grab it to the hair or some suit some 

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:52.600
 Dress as you want 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:54.940
 so fijaros super simple for nothing 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:57.600
 I hope you liked it and see you 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.600
 the next video
