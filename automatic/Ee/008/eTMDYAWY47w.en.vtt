it<00:00:34.530> we<00:00:34.800> were<00:00:35.309> not<00:00:35.610> non<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.329> Dreamcast<00:00:36.780> this

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
it we were not non the Dreamcast this

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.540 
it we were not non the Dreamcast this
was<00:00:37.079> all<00:00:37.170> done<00:00:37.200> with<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.649> vm<00:00:37.950> you<00:00:38.190> so<00:00:38.430> you'd

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
was all done with the vm you so you'd

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.010 
was all done with the vm you so you'd
look<00:00:38.700> at<00:00:38.820> the<00:00:38.910> controller<00:00:39.270> and<00:00:39.600> they<00:00:39.690> didn't

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
look at the controller and they didn't

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.410 
look at the controller and they didn't
he'd<00:00:40.140> be<00:00:40.170> doing<00:00:40.559> stuff<00:00:40.760> but<00:00:41.760> obviously<00:00:42.300> they

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
he'd be doing stuff but obviously they

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.869 
he'd be doing stuff but obviously they
can<00:00:42.629> do<00:00:42.809> that<00:00:43.020> with<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.290> Gamecube<00:00:43.800> so<00:00:44.070> he<00:00:44.730> just

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
can do that with the Gamecube so he just

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.000 
can do that with the Gamecube so he just
kind<00:00:45.000> of<00:00:45.120> pops<00:00:45.329> up<00:00:45.539> like<00:00:45.600> that<00:00:45.870> fina<00:00:46.649> is<00:00:46.890> at

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
buttload of spirit and we won't really

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.310 
buttload of spirit and we won't really
be<00:00:56.190> making<00:00:56.579> that<00:00:56.730> much<00:00:56.850> useful<00:00:57.059> of<00:00:57.449> use<00:00:57.989> of<00:00:58.199> it

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
be making that much useful of use of it

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.670 
be making that much useful of use of it
early<00:00:58.620> on<00:00:58.649> but<00:00:59.039> this<00:00:59.250> one<00:00:59.430> lunar<00:00:59.789> glyph<00:01:00.680> very

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
early on but this one lunar glyph very

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:07.050 

she<00:01:05.740> also<00:01:05.860> doesn't<00:01:06.159> have<00:01:06.310> a<00:01:06.340> lot<00:01:06.490> of<00:01:06.520> magic<00:01:06.939> she

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
she also doesn't have a lot of magic she

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:12.270 
she also doesn't have a lot of magic she
just<00:01:07.270> has<00:01:07.420> curia<00:01:07.930> and<00:01:08.259> risin<00:01:10.320> risin<00:01:11.320> is<00:01:11.860> a<00:01:11.890> pain

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
because it only is a fifty percent

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.609 
because it only is a fifty percent

okay<00:02:18.250> so<00:02:18.310> there<00:02:18.670> should<00:02:18.880> be<00:02:19.000> a<00:02:19.030> moon<00:02:19.270> crystal

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:19.710 
okay so there should be a moon crystal

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:23.880 
okay so there should be a moon crystal
under<00:02:20.710> each<00:02:20.920> moon<00:02:21.690> closest<00:02:22.690> ones<00:02:22.960> are<00:02:23.260> yellow

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
under each moon closest ones are yellow

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.760 
under each moon closest ones are yellow
of<00:02:24.100> value<00:02:24.460> and<00:02:24.760> red<00:02:25.180> mood<00:02:25.390> of<00:02:25.540> Nazareth<00:02:26.020> so

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
of value and red mood of Nazareth so

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:28.410 
of value and red mood of Nazareth so
this<00:02:27.160> is<00:02:27.190> why<00:02:27.400> we've<00:02:27.670> been<00:02:27.880> trying<00:02:28.150> to<00:02:28.300> like
