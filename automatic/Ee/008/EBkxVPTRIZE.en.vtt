month so I had to use the preset
template<00:00:30.990> he<00:00:31.109> had<00:00:31.199> built<00:00:31.410> on<00:00:31.619> erosion<00:00:32.250> which

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
template he had built on erosion which

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.700 
template he had built on erosion which
is<00:00:33.090> kind<00:00:33.329> of<00:00:33.360> like<00:00:33.450> this<00:00:33.540> little<00:00:33.690> chasm<00:00:34.290> area

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
is kind of like this little chasm area

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.680 
is kind of like this little chasm area
build<00:00:35.399> up<00:00:35.520> from<00:00:35.670> that<00:00:35.850> and<00:00:36.059> make<00:00:36.180> my<00:00:36.300> own<00:00:36.329> map

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
build up from that and make my own map

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.319 
build up from that and make my own map
of<00:00:36.899> it<00:00:37.050> so<00:00:37.860> a<00:00:37.890> derailed<00:00:38.520> is<00:00:38.730> kind<00:00:38.940> of<00:00:39.030> a<00:00:39.090> mini

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
of it so a derailed is kind of a mini

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.229 
of it so a derailed is kind of a mini
train<00:00:39.930> station<00:00:40.469> area<00:00:40.739> built<00:00:41.579> off<00:00:41.850> of<00:00:41.879> this

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
train station area built off of this

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.840 
train station area built off of this
little<00:00:42.620> draining<00:00:43.620> zone<00:00:43.829> so<00:00:44.430> as<00:00:44.520> you<00:00:44.579> can<00:00:44.700> see

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
little draining zone so as you can see

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.549 
little draining zone so as you can see
here<00:00:45.059> you<00:00:45.120> have<00:00:45.180> a<00:00:45.270> derailed<00:00:45.870> train<00:00:46.260> with<00:00:46.530> a

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
here you have a derailed train with a

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.350 
here you have a derailed train with a
crashed<00:00:46.860> car<00:00:47.190> which<00:00:47.399> allows<00:00:47.640> access<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:48.180> the

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
crashed car which allows access to the

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.299 
crashed car which allows access to the
second<00:00:48.719> floor<00:00:48.840> along<00:00:49.710> with<00:00:49.739> a<00:00:49.829> few<00:00:50.010> different

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
second floor along with a few different

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:51.799 
second floor along with a few different
ramps<00:00:50.610> and<00:00:50.730> tunnels<00:00:51.059> underneath<00:00:51.329> that<00:00:51.570> kind

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
ramps and tunnels underneath that kind

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.389 
ramps and tunnels underneath that kind
of<00:00:51.899> split<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.770> map<00:00:52.920> up<00:00:53.100> into<00:00:53.370> different

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
of split the map up into different

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.790 
of split the map up into different
sectors<00:00:54.090> so<00:00:54.960> as<00:00:55.020> you<00:00:55.079> can<00:00:55.199> see<00:00:55.350> this<00:00:55.469> is<00:00:55.620> one<00:00:55.770> of

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
sectors so as you can see this is one of

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.350 
sectors so as you can see this is one of
the<00:00:55.920> tunnels<00:00:56.070> I'm<00:00:56.280> talking<00:00:56.579> about<00:00:56.640> you<00:00:57.210> got<00:00:57.329> a

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
the tunnels I'm talking about you got a

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.880 
the tunnels I'm talking about you got a
cool<00:00:57.539> drainage<00:00:57.989> tunnel<00:00:58.379> that<00:00:58.530> goes<00:00:58.590> right

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
cool drainage tunnel that goes right

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.139 
cool drainage tunnel that goes right
beneath<00:00:59.160> their<00:00:59.399> with<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.609> grilling<00:00:59.940> on<00:01:00.059> the

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
beneath their with the grilling on the

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.910 
beneath their with the grilling on the
side<00:01:00.329> you<00:01:00.899> got<00:01:01.020> these<00:01:01.170> steep<00:01:01.440> ramps<00:01:01.829> which

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
side you got these steep ramps which

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.590 
side you got these steep ramps which
kind<00:01:02.160> of<00:01:02.250> twist<00:01:02.699> the<00:01:02.820> gameplay<00:01:03.149> up<00:01:03.270> a<00:01:03.359> little

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
kind of twist the gameplay up a little

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:04.850 
kind of twist the gameplay up a little
bit<00:01:03.690> so<00:01:03.809> it's<00:01:03.930> very<00:01:04.080> risky<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.559> traverse

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
bit so it's very risky to traverse

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.710 
bit so it's very risky to traverse
yourself<00:01:05.220> through<00:01:05.460> there<00:01:05.610> that<00:01:06.210> come<00:01:06.420> up<00:01:06.600> to

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
yourself through there that come up to

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.780 
yourself through there that come up to
this<00:01:06.840> other<00:01:07.110> building<00:01:07.530> here's<00:01:08.430> a<00:01:08.490> little<00:01:08.700> bit

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
this other building here's a little bit

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:09.859 
this other building here's a little bit
of<00:01:08.850> first-person<00:01:09.180> footage<00:01:09.630> from<00:01:09.750> my

we're gonna find a shotgun spawn as the

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.410 
we're gonna find a shotgun spawn as the
initial<00:01:52.229> ordinance<00:01:52.740> for<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:52.950> map<00:01:53.299> once<00:01:54.299> again

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
initial ordinance for the map once again

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.429 
initial ordinance for the map once again
here's<00:01:54.659> a<00:01:54.750> little<00:01:54.990> bit<00:01:55.079> of<00:01:55.140> first-person

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
here's a little bit of first-person

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:56.719 
here's a little bit of first-person
footage<00:01:55.860> a<00:01:55.950> flood<00:01:56.189> just<00:01:56.340> to<00:01:56.490> show<00:01:56.610> you<00:01:56.640> guys

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
footage a flood just to show you guys

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.179 
footage a flood just to show you guys
how<00:01:56.880> it's<00:01:57.149> actually<00:01:57.270> really<00:01:57.659> balanced<00:01:58.259> what

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
how it's actually really balanced what

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.560 
how it's actually really balanced what
you<00:01:59.280> don't<00:01:59.369> want<00:01:59.549> to<00:01:59.610> do<00:01:59.700> is<00:01:59.790> what<00:02:00.329> we<00:02:00.450> did

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
you don't want to do is what we did

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
you don't want to do is what we did
right<00:02:00.719> there<00:02:00.810> have<00:02:01.079> one<00:02:01.200> player<00:02:01.409> do<00:02:01.560> a

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
right there have one player do a

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.109 
right there have one player do a
distraction<00:02:02.219> and<00:02:02.310> then<00:02:02.430> hopefully<00:02:02.820> come<00:02:03.000> in

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
distraction and then hopefully come in

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.910 
distraction and then hopefully come in
from<00:02:03.240> behind<00:02:03.450> and<00:02:03.659> managed<00:02:04.439> to<00:02:04.530> take<00:02:04.710> out<00:02:04.799> the

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
from behind and managed to take out the

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.980 
from behind and managed to take out the
humans<00:02:05.219> so<00:02:05.850> progressively<00:02:06.329> through<00:02:06.750> a<00:02:06.810> little

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
humans so progressively through a little

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.210 
humans so progressively through a little
bit<00:02:07.020> of<00:02:07.170> testing<00:02:07.320> i<00:02:07.619> found<00:02:07.829> that<00:02:07.950> I've<00:02:08.099> been

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
bit of testing i found that I've been

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.949 
bit of testing i found that I've been
able<00:02:08.340> to<00:02:08.520> come<00:02:08.670> up<00:02:08.700> with<00:02:08.819> a<00:02:08.940> rather<00:02:09.390> balanced

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
able to come up with a rather balanced

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.809 
able to come up with a rather balanced
aspect<00:02:10.349> for<00:02:10.470> this<00:02:10.590> map<00:02:10.800> it<00:02:11.370> also<00:02:11.520> works<00:02:11.610> really

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
aspect for this map it also works really

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.790 
aspect for this map it also works really
well<00:02:12.030> with<00:02:12.239> flood<00:02:12.540> in<00:02:12.660> general<00:02:12.989> so

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
well with flood in general so

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.770 
well with flood in general so
keep<00:02:13.920> that<00:02:14.040> in<00:02:14.190> mind<00:02:14.390> as<00:02:15.390> you<00:02:15.600> saw<00:02:15.750> there

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
keep that in mind as you saw there

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.780 
keep that in mind as you saw there
there's<00:02:16.080> a<00:02:16.170> water<00:02:16.470> tower<00:02:16.710> on<00:02:16.890> the<00:02:17.010> right<00:02:17.190> up

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
there's a water tower on the right up

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.460 
there's a water tower on the right up
here<00:02:18.090> is<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.300> derailed<00:02:18.630> train<00:02:18.930> once<00:02:19.170> again

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
here is the derailed train once again

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:20.690 
here is the derailed train once again
you<00:02:19.590> can<00:02:19.740> see<00:02:19.860> it's<00:02:19.980> kind<00:02:20.190> of<00:02:20.250> going<00:02:20.430> into<00:02:20.640> a

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:20.700 
you can see it's kind of going into a

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.030 
you can see it's kind of going into a
tunnel<00:02:20.940> and<00:02:21.180> exiting<00:02:21.600> the<00:02:21.720> area<00:02:22.020> right<00:02:23.010> here

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
tunnel and exiting the area right here

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.070 
tunnel and exiting the area right here
is<00:02:23.190> a<00:02:23.250> view<00:02:23.460> from<00:02:23.670> inside<00:02:23.880> the<00:02:24.060> building<00:02:24.210> you

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
is a view from inside the building you

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.780 
is a view from inside the building you
can<00:02:25.260> kind<00:02:25.710> of<00:02:25.740> go<00:02:25.890> outside<00:02:26.250> you<00:02:26.490> get<00:02:26.610> a<00:02:26.640> nice

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
can kind of go outside you get a nice

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.090 
can kind of go outside you get a nice
open<00:02:27.000> range<00:02:27.450> of<00:02:27.660> fire<00:02:27.870> here<00:02:28.200> some<00:02:28.680> decent

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
open range of fire here some decent

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.220 
open range of fire here some decent
lines<00:02:29.250> of<00:02:29.430> sites<00:02:29.670> up<00:02:30.510> here's<00:02:30.840> one<00:02:31.110> of<00:02:31.200> the

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
lines of sites up here's one of the

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.600 
lines of sites up here's one of the
flood<00:02:31.500> spawns<00:02:31.830> they<00:02:32.010> actually<00:02:32.250> have<00:02:32.370> quite<00:02:32.550> a

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
flood spawns they actually have quite a

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.700 
flood spawns they actually have quite a
few<00:02:32.700> on<00:02:32.940> this<00:02:33.060> map<00:02:33.270> which<00:02:33.450> really<00:02:33.690> diverts<00:02:34.650> the

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
few on this map which really diverts the

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:36.260 
few on this map which really diverts the
combat<00:02:35.130> to<00:02:35.250> different<00:02:35.550> areas<00:02:35.670> and<00:02:36.060> really

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:36.270 
combat to different areas and really

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:37.610 
combat to different areas and really
makes<00:02:36.450> the<00:02:36.570> humans<00:02:36.840> cover<00:02:37.020> their<00:02:37.200> backs<00:02:37.380> on

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
makes the humans cover their backs on

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.190 
makes the humans cover their backs on
multiple<00:02:37.980> occasions<00:02:38.540> so<00:02:39.540> another<00:02:39.900> one<00:02:40.050> of<00:02:40.140> the

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:40.200 
multiple occasions so another one of the

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.750 
multiple occasions so another one of the
spawns<00:02:40.440> is<00:02:40.590> right<00:02:40.800> here<00:02:40.980> inside<00:02:41.160> this<00:02:41.490> train

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
spawns is right here inside this train

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.490 
spawns is right here inside this train

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:56.610 
this is kind of a cool switch that would

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.240 
this is kind of a cool switch that would
get<00:02:56.760> pulled<00:02:57.120> to<00:02:57.390> kind<00:02:57.630> of<00:02:57.690> set<00:02:58.020> these<00:02:58.250> storage

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
get pulled to kind of set these storage

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.370 
get pulled to kind of set these storage

carts to move and go up get attached to
another<00:03:01.470> train<00:03:01.830> so<00:03:02.040> this<00:03:02.190> is<00:03:02.280> kind<00:03:02.430> of<00:03:02.460> like

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
another train so this is kind of like

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.040 
another train so this is kind of like
just<00:03:02.640> a<00:03:02.850> waiting<00:03:03.180> station<00:03:03.600> for<00:03:03.750> the<00:03:03.840> train

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
just a waiting station for the train

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:05.900 
just a waiting station for the train
while<00:03:04.230> the<00:03:04.410> upper<00:03:04.590> passage<00:03:05.130> is<00:03:05.310> an<00:03:05.490> actual

spawns this is that probably their

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.670 
spawns this is that probably their
highest<00:03:11.940> point<00:03:12.180> to<00:03:12.300> get<00:03:12.450> from<00:03:12.690> this<00:03:13.350> is<00:03:13.500> kind

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
highest point to get from this is kind

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.050 
highest point to get from this is kind
of<00:03:13.740> to<00:03:13.860> divert<00:03:14.190> the<00:03:14.340> attention<00:03:14.370> from<00:03:14.880> the

see<00:03:39.150> right<00:03:39.270> here's<00:03:39.540> a<00:03:39.600> strategy<00:03:40.020> we<00:03:40.110> were

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
see right here's a strategy we were

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:41.690 
see right here's a strategy we were
doing<00:03:40.530> i<00:03:40.620> was<00:03:40.770> covering<00:03:40.980> my<00:03:41.220> teammates<00:03:41.580> and

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
doing i was covering my teammates and

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.370 
doing i was covering my teammates and
fortunately<00:03:42.180> they<00:03:42.390> did<00:03:42.540> not<00:03:42.690> cover<00:03:42.900> me<00:03:43.170> so<00:03:43.350> i

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:43.380 
fortunately they did not cover me so i

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:44.680 
fortunately they did not cover me so i
ended<00:03:43.530> up<00:03:43.620> getting<00:03:43.739> wiped<00:03:43.980> out<00:03:44.190> from<00:03:44.280> the<00:03:44.430> side

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
ended up getting wiped out from the side

ended up getting wiped out from the side
another<00:03:45.690> important<00:03:45.989> aspect<00:03:46.110> of<00:03:46.380> think<00:03:46.560> of<00:03:46.650> is

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
another important aspect of think of is

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:47.930 
another important aspect of think of is
that<00:03:46.950> there's<00:03:47.160> a<00:03:47.190> little<00:03:47.340> hole<00:03:47.430> that<00:03:47.580> you<00:03:47.790> can

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
that there's a little hole that you can

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.100 
that there's a little hole that you can
drop<00:03:48.120> down<00:03:48.360> if<00:03:48.480> every<00:03:48.690> being<00:03:48.870> assaulted

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
drop down if every being assaulted

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:50.360 
drop down if every being assaulted
trying<00:03:49.590> to<00:03:49.650> run<00:03:49.800> through<00:03:49.920> the<00:03:50.040> tunnels<00:03:50.310> and

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.370 
trying to run through the tunnels and
get<00:03:50.520> yourself<00:03:50.820> a<00:03:50.880> little<00:03:51.120> bit<00:03:51.209> of<00:03:51.300> cover<00:03:51.450> so

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380
