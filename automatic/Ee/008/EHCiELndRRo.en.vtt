00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 hello friends on today's talk episode 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:09.059
 about the bathroom in an office 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:13.460
 dentistry and how it shows 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.460
 about you to your patient 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.910
 according to my friend gleisi juvenil who 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.850
 is a consultant there 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:27.480
 the bathroom is the clinic area where the 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:30.689
 customer is alone and then he can 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:33.630
 both is an ideal space to enchant you 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.829
 and taste all the hygiene and care of your 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:40.070
 service and bathroom is no place for 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:43.980
 compressor bucket broom 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:46.260
 hanging bags stock footage 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.789
 crochet towel 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.300
 so try to create an environment 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:54.320
 nice with aroma a flower pot 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:57.360
 the mouthwash a mini paste 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:00.750
 little treats for your patients 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:04.260
 I put these treats in a box and 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.560
 also in a bag holder at the time 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.820
 that the patient is still an office 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.520
 entering the bathroom normally if it is 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.369
 woman has a bag and she has some 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.520
 place to attend another point 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:20.640
 important is the cleanliness if the 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.369
 your office is in poor condition 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.170
 your patient can think of his care 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.890
 with hygiene inside the room 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:31.890
 service may be similar and this 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.079
 can take you away from your clinic will not 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.240
 think that it was another customer who 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.790
 person who entered the office and was dirty 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.280
 will not find a dirty bathroom will 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.799
 to have a bad impression 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:47.460
 a good way to keep the bathroom clean 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:49.799
 besides a good cleaning of course is to use 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.320
 those wipes moistened with products 

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:54.420
 cleaner knows it's ready then 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.299
 with a single sheet of tissue 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.600
 secretary go and can return to 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:02.369
 toilet to the long-awaited cleaning 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:05.189
 by their agents 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:08.640
 so it's too late you can keep the 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:10.099
 bathroom and for this reason the 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.230
 bathroom of a dental office 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:13.830
 should have the same attention as any other 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.400
 other 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:20.400
 his art here in my used a paper of 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:23.670
 adhesive wall that is easy to install and 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:26.730
 that adds a touch to the decor 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.830
 these bonded papers they can be 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.290
 clean with a damp cloth that is more 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:34.650
 interesting for the bathroom area 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:37.040

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:39.840
