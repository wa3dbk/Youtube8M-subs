00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
right as we look at Walter a style very

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.090 
right as we look at Walter a style very
distinctive<00:01:14.380> five-step<00:01:15.380> approach<00:01:15.500> pushes

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
distinctive five-step approach pushes

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.430 
distinctive five-step approach pushes
the<00:01:16.160> ball<00:01:16.340> way<00:01:16.490> in<00:01:16.610> his<00:01:16.730> second<00:01:17.090> step<00:01:17.300> a<00:01:17.570> pretty

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:18.440 
the ball way in his second step a pretty

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.440 
the ball way in his second step a pretty
high<00:01:18.650> backswing<00:01:19.340> little<00:01:19.730> past<00:01:19.910> shoulder<00:01:20.270> high

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
high backswing little past shoulder high

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.430 
high backswing little past shoulder high
and<00:01:20.720> just<00:01:21.320> really<00:01:21.890> really<00:01:22.070> cuts<00:01:22.640> it<00:01:22.760> loose

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:23.440 
and just really really cuts it loose

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.750 
and just really really cuts it loose
never<00:01:24.440> makes<00:01:24.710> a<00:01:24.800> tentative<00:01:25.100> shot<00:01:25.340> I<00:01:25.550> think

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:25.760 
never makes a tentative shot I think

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:32.020 
never makes a tentative shot I think
that's<00:01:25.880> his<00:01:26.000> greatest<00:01:26.210> asset<00:01:30.580> and<00:01:31.580> he<00:01:31.700> tucks

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
that's his greatest asset and he tucks

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.210 
that's his greatest asset and he tucks
that<00:01:32.360> ball<00:01:32.630> and<00:01:32.930> I<00:01:33.050> think<00:01:33.080> it<00:01:33.440> listens<00:01:33.860> to<00:01:34.100> him

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
that ball and I think it listens to him

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.370 
that ball and I think it listens to him
it<00:01:35.000> seems<00:01:35.270> to<00:01:35.390> listen<00:01:35.660> to<00:01:35.750> him<00:01:35.930> I<00:01:36.050> thought<00:01:36.260> oh

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:36.380 
it seems to listen to him I thought oh

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:38.140 
it seems to listen to him I thought oh
you<00:01:37.040> never<00:01:37.220> listen<00:01:37.610> to<00:01:37.640> me<00:01:37.730> I<00:01:37.850> don't<00:01:38.090> know

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:38.150 
you never listen to me I don't know

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.990 
you never listen to me I don't know
about<00:01:38.210> you<00:01:39.100> it<00:01:40.100> listened<00:01:40.430> a<00:01:40.460> little<00:01:40.580> bit<00:01:40.820> last

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
about you it listened a little bit last

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.270

week<00:01:41.150> a<00:01:41.510> little<00:01:42.170> bit<00:01:42.260> less<00:01:42.440> we<00:01:42.620> certainly<00:01:43.040> did

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
week a little bit less we certainly did

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.950 
week a little bit less we certainly did
well<00:01:43.550> and<00:01:44.120> something<00:01:44.600> to<00:01:44.660> do<00:01:44.720> with<00:01:44.870> the

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960

certainly<00:02:04.880> have<00:02:05.180> been<00:02:05.300> a<00:02:05.360> distraction<00:02:05.810> but

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
certainly have been a distraction but

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:07.780 
certainly have been a distraction but
things<00:02:06.770> are<00:02:06.920> slowing<00:02:07.130> down<00:02:07.370> a<00:02:07.430> little<00:02:07.670> bit

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:39.130 
my mind the two best bowlers you know of

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:46.110 
my mind the two best bowlers you know of
this<00:03:39.370> decade

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.520 

why<00:03:47.120> that<00:03:47.300> made<00:03:47.420> a<00:03:47.450> snap<00:03:47.780> in<00:03:47.930> a<00:03:47.990> hurry<00:03:48.110> just<00:03:48.380> a

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
why that made a snap in a hurry just a

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.380 
why that made a snap in a hurry just a
hair<00:03:48.710> soft<00:03:48.980> just<00:03:49.400> a<00:03:49.460> little<00:03:49.670> bit<00:03:49.850> yeah<00:03:50.090> he<00:03:50.240> was

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:50.390 
hair soft just a little bit yeah he was

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:51.940 
hair soft just a little bit yeah he was
a<00:03:50.420> little<00:03:50.570> soft<00:03:50.870> for<00:03:50.960> that<00:03:51.170> shot<00:03:51.380> I<00:03:51.410> think<00:03:51.590> he

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
a little soft for that shot I think he

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:52.510 
a little soft for that shot I think he
knows<00:03:52.160> it

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:52.520 
knows it

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.760 
knows it
I<00:03:52.570> think<00:03:53.570> norm<00:03:53.780> feels<00:03:53.990> like<00:03:54.170> he<00:03:54.320> found

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:54.770

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:56.350 
I think norm feels like he found
something<00:03:55.280> now<00:03:55.370> you<00:03:55.430> can<00:03:55.640> see<00:03:55.790> his<00:03:55.910> ball<00:03:56.120> going

00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:55.520 
Ernie Schlegel and he had to both on the

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:59.850 
Ernie Schlegel and he had to both on the
right-hand<00:06:55.910> lane<00:06:57.400> and<00:06:58.400> one<00:06:58.669> high<00:06:58.850> one<00:06:58.880> light

00:06:59.850 --> 00:06:59.860 
right-hand lane and one high one light

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:02.020 
right-hand lane and one high one light
yeah<00:07:00.860> he<00:07:01.010> got<00:07:01.100> a<00:07:01.160> little<00:07:01.370> bit<00:07:01.490> trapped<00:07:01.730> towards

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:02.030 
yeah he got a little bit trapped towards

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:03.190 
yeah he got a little bit trapped towards
the<00:07:02.120> end<00:07:02.210> of<00:07:02.300> that<00:07:02.360> game<00:07:02.600> I<00:07:02.630> don't<00:07:02.810> think<00:07:03.110> he

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:03.200 
the end of that game I don't think he

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:05.560 
the end of that game I don't think he
was<00:07:03.380> as<00:07:03.530> decisive<00:07:03.950> as<00:07:04.220> it<00:07:04.370> needed<00:07:04.610> to<00:07:04.639> be<00:07:04.730> and

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:05.570 
was as decisive as it needed to be and

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:07.480 
was as decisive as it needed to be and
it<00:07:06.260> cost<00:07:06.470> him<00:07:06.680> and<00:07:06.889> that's<00:07:07.190> why<00:07:07.340> we're

00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:07.490 
it cost him and that's why we're

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:08.710 
it cost him and that's why we're
watching<00:07:07.580> norm<00:07:07.970> Duke<00:07:08.180> bowling<00:07:08.540> against

00:07:10.330 --> 00:07:10.340 
Walter Ray Williams jr. man cuz he had a

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:14.820 
Walter Ray Williams jr. man cuz he had a
winning<00:07:10.669> shot<00:07:10.820> I<00:07:11.240> thought<00:07:11.590> he<00:07:12.590> looked<00:07:12.740> good

00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:14.830 
winning shot I thought he looked good

winning shot I thought he looked good
seventh<00:07:15.830> frame<00:07:16.040> action<00:07:16.460> trailing<00:07:16.940> by<00:07:17.090> 10<00:07:17.389> on

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:17.630

lane<00:07:17.870> 33<00:07:19.660> gets<00:07:20.660> the<00:07:20.930> light<00:07:21.139> scrambler<00:07:21.830> a

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:24.400 

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:28.240 

little<00:07:25.400> more<00:07:25.550> speed<00:07:25.850> on<00:07:25.910> that<00:07:26.120> delivery<00:07:27.250> and

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:28.250 
little more speed on that delivery and

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:29.500 
little more speed on that delivery and
that's<00:07:28.490> why<00:07:28.669> the<00:07:28.729> ball<00:07:28.940> came<00:07:29.150> in<00:07:29.300> just<00:07:29.450> a

00:07:29.500 --> 00:07:29.510 
that's why the ball came in just a

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:31.450 
that's why the ball came in just a
little<00:07:29.540> bit<00:07:29.870> light<00:07:30.080> but<00:07:30.350> with<00:07:31.040> these<00:07:31.190> balls
