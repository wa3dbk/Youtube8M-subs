blow-dry<00:01:01.949> it<00:01:02.010> a<00:01:02.219> little<00:01:02.430> bit<00:01:02.579> because<00:01:02.730> my<00:01:03.030> hair

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
blow-dry it a little bit because my hair

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.530 
blow-dry it a little bit because my hair
comes<00:01:03.750> is<00:01:04.680> very<00:01:04.949> straight<00:01:05.280> and<00:01:05.460> this<00:01:05.970> helps<00:01:06.390> it

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
comes is very straight and this helps it

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:07.940 
comes is very straight and this helps it
to<00:01:06.630> have<00:01:06.720> a<00:01:06.750> little<00:01:07.049> bit<00:01:07.140> of<00:01:07.229> body<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:07.830> it

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
to have a little bit of body and it

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.560 
to have a little bit of body and it
holds<00:01:08.130> its<00:01:08.369> curl<00:01:08.700> better<00:01:08.909> for<00:01:09.180> me<00:01:09.299> when<00:01:09.450> I<00:01:09.479> do

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
holds its curl better for me when I do

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.050 
holds its curl better for me when I do
it<00:01:09.720> that<00:01:09.840> way<00:01:09.990> so<00:01:10.049> I<00:01:10.700> separate<00:01:11.700> a<00:01:11.729> front

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
it that way so I separate a front

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.990 
it that way so I separate a front
section<00:01:12.979> probably<00:01:13.979> about<00:01:14.159> an<00:01:14.340> inch<00:01:14.580> to<00:01:14.760> an

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
section probably about an inch to an

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.660 
section probably about an inch to an
inch<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.240> a<00:01:15.360> half<00:01:15.390> thick<00:01:17.960> and<00:01:18.960> I<00:01:19.229> put<00:01:19.590> a<00:01:19.920> hot

inch and a half thick and I put a hot

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:28.399 
inch and a half thick and I put a hot
stick<00:01:21.060> in<00:01:21.299> it<00:01:24.619> and<00:01:25.729> then<00:01:26.729> for<00:01:27.180> my<00:01:27.360> bumpit<00:01:27.869> my

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409
