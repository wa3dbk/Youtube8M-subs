00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.569
 on 

00:00:10.569 --> 00:00:13.659
 as headless as it is still the lightest and solution 

00:00:14.399 --> 00:00:16.710
 I would like to point out 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.619

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:22.779
 Rimbach 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:26.390
 my conscience 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.500
 Corinna Ponto still have a few parks on it 

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:33.589

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:52.510
 she is the case 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.350

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:55.590
 to the slogan 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.470
 Volker general 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.660
 nothing good 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.660
 either way 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.090
 our Father is the beautiful word 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:09.620
 Dr 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.140
 she is getting tighter and tighter 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.420
 Project number 1 Â» 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.930
 Rachel Hezbollah had 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.930
 it runs out 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.580
 So again with no 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:31.150
 after good and it is 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.840
 "That's how it has been 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.290
 the piece 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.290
 two dpa 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.370
 yes I 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.370
 can feel good 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.620
 I hope much more will be seen 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.129
 Werner Suppan 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:38.800
 Great opportunities through the fencing for a da 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.800

00:02:43.419 --> 00:02:45.539
 is red 

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:48.539
 Let's talk like that 

00:02:50.749 --> 00:02:52.279
 the clock is ticking 

00:02:52.279 --> 00:02:54.099
 and brings 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:57.099
 and on 

00:02:59.699 --> 00:03:02.819
 become 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:04.649
 how it works 

00:03:04.649 --> 00:03:06.050
 I look like BusinessWeek 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:07.059
 Borken 

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:10.039

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:16.179
 Asked Peruggia 

00:03:16.179 --> 00:03:18.299
 I am ashamed again 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:21.299
 in the design of spaces 

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:23.630
 for Klopp also Gundogan 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:25.159
 Gmail 

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:27.929
 so far 

00:03:27.929 --> 00:03:29.499
 In the morning 

00:03:29.499 --> 00:03:34.659
 Nat wine book on with over 60 we pack 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:37.959
 4 4 we wanted 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:39.010
 Pauli 2 1 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:42.010
 the troupe is 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:44.480
 8 percent 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:45.700
 and 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:48.700
 FC Cologne 

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:51.889
 Chopin 

00:03:51.889 --> 00:03:54.169
 I 

00:03:54.169 --> 00:03:55.019
 here 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:57.659
 because off 

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:00.579
 yes b 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:02.339
 Borken 

00:04:02.339 --> 00:04:05.269
 on 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:08.489
 not say 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:10.049
 4 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:11.989

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:14.479
 O'Brien 

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:15.829
 percent 

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:18.000
 for years 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.299
 per watt 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:21.889
 4 

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:22.729
 dpa 

00:04:22.729 --> 00:04:25.620
 and century 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.620
 please place 

00:04:33.749 --> 00:04:36.749
 not after seven 

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:40.439
 Woman approx 

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:43.069
 what is there at this 

00:04:43.069 --> 00:04:44.889
 Succeeded 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:47.499
 around 

00:04:47.499 --> 00:04:50.169
 finally through Luca Toni 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:52.419
 Jack also for the savings target Euro 

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:56.030
 So it did not take much longer than First Boston would have to 

00:04:56.029 --> 00:05:00.140
 but good 4 but wealth Tumpel 

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:03.140
 was a bit better than in Ostfildern 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:06.879
 but 

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:11.219
 Well in just the same problems as the oil if you want it that you can 

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:19.949
 not to buy your own tickets on 9 Clyde and kids clothes or so and to 

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:21.730
 have prompt 

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:26.820
 AP does not want to miss your own stuff but otherwise everything is quite 

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:28.339
 well, I mean 

00:05:28.339 --> 00:05:32.889
 I think boring to do what they do, the showers or the crawl compete 

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:37.259
 so cap pitcher the main game and both add-ons to 500 aircraft boat 

00:05:37.939 --> 00:05:41.360
 Moosburg already say 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.360
 how do you say shows off 

00:05:45.089 --> 00:05:49.809
 next comes next to the percent from now on even forced break 

00:05:49.809 --> 00:05:50.839
 only from the women 

00:05:50.839 --> 00:05:53.300
 which is every morning 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.349
 but it has to look too 

00:05:55.349 --> 00:05:58.449
 who on a canal would have to go to Scotsman as well 

00:05:58.449 --> 00:06:01.289
 and there are still a few action to look like 

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:04.319
 and now Sion Schramma needs only as a percent 

00:06:05.869 --> 00:06:08.869
 on the other hand Omar wore 

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:14.539
 but good me because I do not say anything I want to say I do not mind 

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:19.069
 maybe they will come to the other one 

00:06:19.069 --> 00:06:20.900
 So the man did not have to 

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:23.539
 Again, such a small issue in the end 

00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:26.219
 polish okay around here 

00:06:26.219 --> 00:06:29.039
 but you can drive me another race or something 

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:31.770
 the LaCie finally gone I seemed to him the caller 

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:34.439
 let us show that 

00:06:34.439 --> 00:06:38.239
 and everyone whether inside and billions of Euros may never be commitments IT 

00:06:38.239 --> 00:06:41.020
 Not credits and revenge l in which 

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:43.669
 Things that happen in the end but no fair no more 

00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:45.309
 more relevant stuff 

00:06:45.309 --> 00:06:49.449
 I hope you enjoyed the woman who brings you that one last song 

00:06:49.449 --> 00:06:52.449
 Year game I'll do 

00:06:53.949 --> 00:06:57.059
 So as I said know is clearly on you do not ask yourself 

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:01.839
 here it will now serve Oris so I think of Dieter three 

00:07:01.839 --> 00:07:05.149
 because I do not because they all only have consoles 

00:07:05.149 --> 00:07:07.289
 in the wiki animal 

00:07:07.289 --> 00:07:10.289
 Dust a ton, as some spurious ones do 

00:07:11.189 --> 00:07:14.189
 have to come out bitterly five weeks into my husband 

00:07:14.809 --> 00:07:17.899
 that would make Wenger here if the family pile up that way 

00:07:17.899 --> 00:07:21.779
 otherwise what the hopefully year is he going to do that as well as I was not 

00:07:21.779 --> 00:07:24.779
 as I said all the consoles were based 

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:28.539
 I want to say 

00:07:28.539 --> 00:07:31.659
 it avenges what makes it neat, so we'll see you next 

00:07:31.659 --> 00:07:32.960
 the latter again 

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:35.779
 the next one does not work 

00:07:35.779 --> 00:07:38.139
 and around 

00:07:38.139 --> 00:07:39.889
 we were so 

00:07:39.889 --> 00:07:40.900
 to floor
