00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:36.720 
two different ways there's ones like

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.650 
two different ways there's ones like
plucking<00:00:37.020> your<00:00:37.620> string<00:00:37.950> and<00:00:38.390> then<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.420> other

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
plucking your string and then the other

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.430 
plucking your string and then the other
one<00:00:39.870> is<00:00:39.899> using<00:00:40.350> your<00:00:40.470> pick<00:00:40.710> so<00:00:41.719> um<00:00:42.719> what<00:00:43.110> I<00:00:43.140> try

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
one is using your pick so um what I try

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.170 
one is using your pick so um what I try
to<00:00:43.469> do<00:00:43.680> is<00:00:43.860> keep<00:00:44.040> it<00:00:44.190> in<00:00:44.309> my<00:00:44.460> hand<00:00:44.730> but<00:00:45.000> it's<00:00:45.120> a

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
to do is keep it in my hand but it's a

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.549 
to do is keep it in my hand but it's a
little<00:00:45.329> bit<00:00:45.450> hard<00:00:45.750> so<00:00:45.989> hopefully<00:00:46.350> you<00:00:46.440> guys

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
little bit hard so hopefully you guys

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.560 
little bit hard so hopefully you guys
can<00:00:46.620> master<00:00:47.370> that<00:00:47.519> a<00:00:47.550> little<00:00:47.850> better<00:00:48.030> than<00:00:48.390> me

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
can master that a little better than me

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.160
