00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
of them are gonna be like alicorn so the

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.050

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.109 
rarity factor targeted rarity factor is
kind<00:01:51.930> of<00:01:52.020> diminishing<00:01:52.680> with<00:01:53.130> every<00:01:53.610> alicorn

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
kind of diminishing with every alicorn

that<00:02:01.700> the<00:02:01.909> agreeable<00:02:02.690> it<00:02:03.080> may<00:02:03.229> not<00:02:03.380> be

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
that the agreeable it may not be

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.680

agreeable<00:02:04.010> at<00:02:04.159> first<00:02:04.490> but<00:02:04.850> I'm<00:02:05.030> sure<00:02:05.420> we'll

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:05.690 
agreeable at first but I'm sure we'll

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:07.330 
agreeable at first but I'm sure we'll
warm<00:02:05.900> up<00:02:06.080> to<00:02:06.290> it<00:02:06.320> because<00:02:06.740> that's<00:02:06.950> what

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
now he seems to be a staple in the show

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.699 
now he seems to be a staple in the show
cadence<00:02:14.000> you<00:02:14.300> know<00:02:14.540> no<00:02:14.750> one<00:02:14.900> really<00:02:14.930> likes<00:02:15.380> and

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
cadence you know no one really likes and

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:17.230 
cadence you know no one really likes and
still<00:02:15.890> no<00:02:16.010> one<00:02:16.130> really<00:02:16.370> likes<00:02:16.550> her<00:02:16.790> but<00:02:17.000> she

still no one really likes her but she

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.780 
still no one really likes her but she
has<00:02:17.420> not<00:02:17.720> much<00:02:17.959> developed<00:02:18.500> so<00:02:18.740> even<00:02:19.400> if<00:02:19.580> they

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:19.790 
has not much developed so even if they

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.790 
has not much developed so even if they
are<00:02:20.000> you<00:02:20.150> going<00:02:20.360> to<00:02:20.510> add<00:02:20.630> another<00:02:20.750> alicorn<00:02:21.590> I

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:21.800 
are you going to add another alicorn I

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.370

think<00:02:22.370> the<00:02:22.490> show<00:02:22.760> writers<00:02:23.240> are<00:02:23.570> sure<00:02:24.140> enough

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
think the show writers are sure enough

think the show writers are sure enough
