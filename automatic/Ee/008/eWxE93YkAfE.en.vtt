gone to a 1v1 the person that you're

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.550 
gone to a 1v1 the person that you're
playing<00:01:29.759> with<00:01:30.000> is<00:01:30.240> actually<00:01:31.049> your<00:01:31.170> second

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
playing with is actually your second

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.490 
playing with is actually your second
controller<00:01:32.240> now<00:01:33.240> this<00:01:33.420> lips<00:01:33.659> were<00:01:34.200> online

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
controller now this lips were online

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.620 
controller now this lips were online
obviously<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:35.520> it's<00:01:35.970> a<00:01:36.030> really<00:01:36.240> good<00:01:36.299> glitch

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
obviously and it's a really good glitch

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.710 
obviously and it's a really good glitch
to<00:01:36.930> do<00:01:37.049> online<00:01:37.350> I<00:01:37.890> don't<00:01:38.850> recommend<00:01:39.390> doing<00:01:39.570> it

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
to do online I don't recommend doing it

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.499 
to do online I don't recommend doing it
online<00:01:39.840> because<00:01:40.229> obviously<00:01:41.000> if<00:01:42.000> you<00:01:42.210> don't<00:01:42.420> on

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
online because obviously if you don't on

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.960 
online because obviously if you don't on
1v1<00:01:42.930> you<00:01:43.350> probably<00:01:43.740> can<00:01:44.100> boost<00:01:44.369> I'm<00:01:44.610> not<00:01:44.759> quite

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
1v1 you probably can boost I'm not quite

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.380 
1v1 you probably can boost I'm not quite
