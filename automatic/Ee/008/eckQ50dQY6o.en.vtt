00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
this time I got a 9 cat in Minecraft and

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.120 
this time I got a 9 cat in Minecraft and
the<00:00:03.659> best<00:00:03.840> thing<00:00:04.049> is<00:00:04.230> you<00:00:04.319> can<00:00:04.529> actually<00:00:04.680> write

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:05.130 
the best thing is you can actually write

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.990 
the best thing is you can actually write
it<00:00:06.170> so<00:00:07.170> let's<00:00:07.379> see<00:00:07.560> how<00:00:07.649> I<00:00:07.710> did<00:00:07.950> it<00:00:08.069> well<00:00:08.670> as<00:00:08.880> you

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
may have guessed I used a bunch of

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.799 
may have guessed I used a bunch of
entity<00:00:11.070> stacked<00:00:11.429> on<00:00:11.550> top<00:00:11.580> of<00:00:11.820> a<00:00:11.910> minecart<00:00:12.300> but

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
entity stacked on top of a minecart but

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.720 
entity stacked on top of a minecart but
what<00:00:12.990> entities<00:00:13.290> did<00:00:13.620> I<00:00:13.710> use<00:00:13.920> well<00:00:14.190> let<00:00:14.460> me<00:00:14.549> show

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
what entities did I use well let me show

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.510 
what entities did I use well let me show
you<00:00:14.790> first<00:00:15.570> things<00:00:15.900> first<00:00:15.990> the<00:00:16.740> minecart<00:00:17.160> then

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
you first things first the minecart then

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.400 
you first things first the minecart then
we'll<00:00:17.670> use<00:00:17.850> some<00:00:18.060> invisible<00:00:18.510> slimes<00:00:18.810> just<00:00:19.289> to

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
we'll use some invisible slimes just to

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.050 
we'll use some invisible slimes just to
spawn<00:00:19.680> these<00:00:19.920> minecarts<00:00:20.550> with<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.760> command

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
spawn these minecarts with the command

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.900 
spawn these minecarts with the command
block<00:00:21.240> just<00:00:21.689> a<00:00:21.810> bit<00:00:21.960> higher<00:00:22.199> then<00:00:23.070> again<00:00:23.430> a<00:00:23.670> lot

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
block just a bit higher then again a lot

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:25.910 
block just a bit higher then again a lot
of<00:00:23.939> slimes<00:00:24.390> for<00:00:24.930> now<00:00:25.019> I'll<00:00:25.350> keep<00:00:25.560> them<00:00:25.769> visible

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
of slimes for now I'll keep them visible

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.460 
of slimes for now I'll keep them visible
the<00:00:26.670> next<00:00:27.000> entity<00:00:27.330> will<00:00:27.539> be<00:00:27.570> the<00:00:27.869> fireworks

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
the next entity will be the fireworks

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.769 
the next entity will be the fireworks
rocket<00:00:28.920> entity<00:00:29.310> to<00:00:29.760> give<00:00:29.910> the<00:00:30.060> 9<00:00:30.240> get<00:00:30.510> a<00:00:30.539> nice

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
rocket entity to give the 9 get a nice

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.920 
rocket entity to give the 9 get a nice
trail<00:00:31.199> now<00:00:31.890> I'll<00:00:32.160> use<00:00:32.189> an<00:00:32.610> inverted<00:00:33.059> slime<00:00:33.329> so

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
trail now I'll use an inverted slime so

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.959 
trail now I'll use an inverted slime so
the<00:00:34.079> next<00:00:34.290> entities<00:00:34.739> will<00:00:34.980> spawn<00:00:35.219> a<00:00:35.250> bit<00:00:35.520> lower

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
the next entities will spawn a bit lower

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.420 
the next entities will spawn a bit lower
that<00:00:36.540> way<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.960> rocket<00:00:37.290> spawns<00:00:37.649> inside<00:00:38.219> the

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
that way the rocket spawns inside the

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.270 
that way the rocket spawns inside the
cat<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:38.940> yet<00:00:39.690> another<00:00:40.110> inverted<00:00:40.739> slime<00:00:41.010> to

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
cat and yet another inverted slime to

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.670 
cat and yet another inverted slime to
spawn<00:00:41.520> this<00:00:41.760> pig<00:00:42.090> a<00:00:42.120> bit<00:00:42.390> lower<00:00:42.660> so<00:00:42.989> that<00:00:43.440> its

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
spawn this pig a bit lower so that its

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.860 
spawn this pig a bit lower so that its
saddle<00:00:44.129> will<00:00:44.309> be<00:00:44.460> just<00:00:44.820> above<00:00:45.030> the<00:00:45.239> cats<00:00:45.480> will

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
saddle will be just above the cats will

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.080 
saddle will be just above the cats will
make<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.200> big<00:00:46.410> invisible<00:00:47.010> as<00:00:47.100> well<00:00:47.309> because

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
make the big invisible as well because

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.000 
make the big invisible as well because
as<00:00:48.270> you<00:00:48.390> can<00:00:48.539> see<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.989> settle<00:00:49.379> will<00:00:49.530> still<00:00:49.860> be

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
as you can see the settle will still be

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.920 
as you can see the settle will still be
visible<00:00:50.160> so<00:00:50.640> that<00:00:51.270> are<00:00:51.420> all<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.719> entities

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
visible so that are all the entities

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.810 
visible so that are all the entities
we're<00:00:52.289> gonna<00:00:52.440> spawn<00:00:52.739> this<00:00:53.219> is<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.579> anti

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
we're gonna spawn this is the anti

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.360 
we're gonna spawn this is the anti
recommend<00:00:54.210> well<00:00:54.899> yeah<00:00:55.559> that's<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:55.980> bit<00:00:56.129> long

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
recommend well yeah that's a bit long

recommend well yeah that's a bit long
I'll<00:00:56.760> put<00:00:57.120> that<00:00:57.270> in<00:00:57.420> a<00:00:57.510> text<00:00:57.780> editor<00:00:58.109> for<00:00:58.140> you

00:00:58.569 --> 00:00:58.579 
I'll put that in a text editor for you

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:01.580 
I'll put that in a text editor for you
man<00:00:59.579> that's<00:00:59.879> a<00:01:00.059> lot<00:01:00.180> of<00:01:00.239> text<00:01:00.660> ok<00:01:01.199> we<00:01:01.350> start

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
man that's a lot of text ok we start

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.680 
man that's a lot of text ok we start
with<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.949> big<00:01:02.160> first<00:01:02.910> we'll<00:01:03.120> give<00:01:03.270> it<00:01:03.300> a<00:01:03.449> Cell

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
with the big first we'll give it a Cell

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.200 
with the big first we'll give it a Cell
so<00:01:04.019> set<00:01:04.350> this<00:01:04.530> to<00:01:04.739> 1<00:01:04.920> and<00:01:05.129> this<00:01:05.700> is<00:01:05.850> gonna<00:01:06.030> make

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
so set this to 1 and this is gonna make

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.080 
so set this to 1 and this is gonna make
sure<00:01:06.479> it<00:01:06.720> becomes<00:01:07.380> invisible<00:01:07.590> so<00:01:08.520> as<00:01:08.850> you<00:01:08.970> can

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
sure it becomes invisible so as you can

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.270 
sure it becomes invisible so as you can
see<00:01:09.330> I<00:01:09.570> put<00:01:09.869> an<00:01:10.049> on<00:01:10.290> all<00:01:10.439> these<00:01:10.619> slimes<00:01:11.010> over

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
see I put an on all these slimes over

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.760 
see I put an on all these slimes over
here<00:01:11.430> as<00:01:11.549> well<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:12.540> next<00:01:12.900> one<00:01:13.170> will<00:01:13.380> be<00:01:13.409> this

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
here as well the next one will be this

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.880 
here as well the next one will be this
slime<00:01:14.130> will<00:01:14.520> set<00:01:14.760> invulnerable<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:16.080> one<00:01:16.320> and

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
slime will set invulnerable to one and

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.460 
slime will set invulnerable to one and
will<00:01:17.189> set<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.400> size<00:01:17.670> to<00:01:17.700> minus<00:01:18.360> 2<00:01:18.689> so<00:01:19.140> we'll<00:01:19.290> be

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
will set the size to minus 2 so we'll be

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:22.999 
will set the size to minus 2 so we'll be
inverted<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.630> we'll<00:01:21.630> make<00:01:21.780> it<00:01:21.930> invisible<00:01:22.259> the

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
inverted and we'll make it invisible the

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.190 
inverted and we'll make it invisible the
next<00:01:23.250> map<00:01:23.400> will<00:01:23.610> be<00:01:23.729> the<00:01:23.880> cat<00:01:24.090> so<00:01:24.450> set<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:25.020> ID

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
next map will be the cat so set the ID

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.670 
next map will be the cat so set the ID
to<00:01:25.799> ocelots<00:01:26.520> will<00:01:27.030> send<00:01:27.330> cat<00:01:27.570> type<00:01:27.840> to<00:01:28.080> 3<00:01:28.439> so

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
to ocelots will send cat type to 3 so

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.140 
to ocelots will send cat type to 3 so
get<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.100> great<00:01:29.310> cat<00:01:29.549> that<00:01:29.790> looks<00:01:29.970> the<00:01:30.119> most

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
get the great cat that looks the most

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.690 
get the great cat that looks the most
like<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.659> nyan<00:01:30.900> cat<00:01:31.200> I'll<00:01:31.530> set<00:01:31.890> owner<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.430> me

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
like the nyan cat I'll set owner to me

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.810 
like the nyan cat I'll set owner to me
or<00:01:33.000> basically<00:01:33.659> anything<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:35.009> next<00:01:35.310> mark<00:01:35.549> will

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
or basically anything the next mark will

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.929 
or basically anything the next mark will
be<00:01:35.850> this<00:01:36.210> line<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:36.780> we'll<00:01:37.590> make<00:01:37.740> it

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:37.939 
be this line and we'll make it

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:40.429 
be this line and we'll make it
invulnerable<00:01:38.939> and<00:01:39.240> set<00:01:39.540> the<00:01:39.630> size<00:01:39.780> to<00:01:39.840> minus<00:01:40.200> 2

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
invulnerable and set the size to minus 2

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.490 
invulnerable and set the size to minus 2
again<00:01:40.619> and<00:01:41.299> then<00:01:42.299> we'll<00:01:42.479> spawn<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:42.990> fireworks

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
again and then we'll spawn the fireworks

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.910 
again and then we'll spawn the fireworks
rocket<00:01:43.920> entity<00:01:44.310> we'll<00:01:44.820> set<00:01:45.060> lifetime<00:01:45.540> to

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
rocket entity we'll set lifetime to

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.800 
rocket entity we'll set lifetime to
32,000<00:01:46.920> that<00:01:47.430> way<00:01:47.610> it<00:01:47.850> will<00:01:48.000> stay<00:01:48.180> there<00:01:48.509> for<00:01:48.780> a

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
32,000 that way it will stay there for a

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.319 
32,000 that way it will stay there for a
very<00:01:49.079> long<00:01:49.409> time<00:01:49.520> now<00:01:50.520> will<00:01:50.820> spawn<00:01:51.119> the

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
very long time now will spawn the

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.020 
very long time now will spawn the
invulnerable<00:01:52.110> slimes<00:01:52.560> with<00:01:52.950> size<00:01:53.520> set<00:01:53.909> to

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
invulnerable slimes with size set to

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.090 
invulnerable slimes with size set to
zero<00:01:54.299> so<00:01:54.720> that's<00:01:55.020> the<00:01:55.229> smallest<00:01:55.500> one<00:01:55.680> but<00:01:55.950> it's

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
zero so that's the smallest one but it's

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.649 
zero so that's the smallest one but it's
not<00:01:56.310> averted<00:01:56.820> and<00:01:56.969> we'll<00:01:57.299> make<00:01:57.450> them<00:01:57.540> all

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
not averted and we'll make them all

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.770 
not averted and we'll make them all
invisible<00:01:57.960> again<00:01:58.409> and<00:01:59.119> then<00:02:00.119> we'll<00:02:00.360> get<00:02:00.719> to

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
invisible again and then we'll get to

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.760 
invisible again and then we'll get to
the<00:02:01.170> minecarts<00:02:01.829> with<00:02:02.310> a<00:02:02.340> command<00:02:02.759> block<00:02:02.850> and

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
the minecarts with a command block and

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.709 
the minecarts with a command block and
this<00:02:04.770> is<00:02:04.979> the<00:02:05.100> command<00:02:05.430> that<00:02:05.490> is<00:02:05.729> inside<00:02:06.390> the

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
this is the command that is inside the

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.809 
this is the command that is inside the
command<00:02:07.020> block<00:02:07.369> basically<00:02:08.369> what<00:02:08.580> it's<00:02:08.729> doing

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
command block basically what it's doing

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.900 
command block basically what it's doing
it's<00:02:09.300> assuming<00:02:10.229> an<00:02:10.379> item<00:02:10.709> about<00:02:11.160> sixteen<00:02:11.879> and

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
it's assuming an item about sixteen and

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.250 
it's assuming an item about sixteen and
a<00:02:12.090> half<00:02:12.120> blocks

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
a half blocks

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.250 
a half blocks
off<00:02:13.319> the<00:02:13.530> micro<00:02:13.890> as<00:02:14.519> you<00:02:14.700> can<00:02:14.849> see<00:02:15.030> here<00:02:15.390> it's

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
off the micro as you can see here it's

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.800 
off the micro as you can see here it's
idea<00:02:16.650> SETI<00:02:16.980> 35<00:02:17.549> so<00:02:17.730> that's<00:02:17.909> wool<00:02:18.150> and<00:02:18.450> this<00:02:18.629> is

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
idea SETI 35 so that's wool and this is

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.300 
idea SETI 35 so that's wool and this is
the<00:02:18.959> color<00:02:19.200> all<00:02:19.860> set<00:02:20.159> h2<00:02:21.200> 5800<00:02:22.200> and<00:02:22.739> usually<00:02:23.280> I

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
the color all set h2 5800 and usually I

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.880 
the color all set h2 5800 and usually I
said<00:02:23.730> count<00:02:24.120> to<00:02:24.390> 1<00:02:24.689> but<00:02:24.959> this<00:02:25.110> time<00:02:25.409> we<00:02:25.709> won't

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
said count to 1 but this time we won't

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.309 
said count to 1 but this time we won't
do<00:02:26.129> that<00:02:26.370> because<00:02:26.730> then<00:02:27.299> you<00:02:27.569> can<00:02:27.750> pick<00:02:27.989> up<00:02:28.019> the

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
do that because then you can pick up the

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:31.190 
do that because then you can pick up the
drops<00:02:28.620> and<00:02:28.920> this<00:02:29.459> is<00:02:29.640> the<00:02:29.760> motion<00:02:30.000> that<00:02:30.420> those

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
drops and this is the motion that those

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.960 
drops and this is the motion that those
are<00:02:31.379> just<00:02:31.440> a<00:02:31.680> bunch<00:02:31.799> of<00:02:31.980> random<00:02:32.190> numbers<00:02:32.700> so

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
are just a bunch of random numbers so

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.940 
are just a bunch of random numbers so
it's<00:02:33.299> got<00:02:33.599> a<00:02:33.629> bit<00:02:33.900> of<00:02:33.989> a<00:02:34.079> random<00:02:34.379> look<00:02:34.560> and

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 
it's got a bit of a random look and

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.460 
it's got a bit of a random look and
these<00:02:35.940> are<00:02:36.150> just<00:02:36.329> the<00:02:36.420> same<00:02:36.599> slides<00:02:37.049> we<00:02:37.260> used

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
these are just the same slides we used

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.319 
these are just the same slides we used
above<00:02:37.769> and<00:02:38.069> then<00:02:38.370> we'll<00:02:38.489> get<00:02:38.670> you<00:02:38.849> to<00:02:38.940> minecart

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:39.329 
above and then we'll get you to minecart

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:41.449 
above and then we'll get you to minecart
writeable<00:02:39.840> these<00:02:40.379> are<00:02:40.620> a<00:02:40.650> lot<00:02:41.010> of<00:02:41.069> end

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
writeable these are a lot of end

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.880 
writeable these are a lot of end
brackets<00:02:41.879> those<00:02:42.540> are<00:02:42.780> there<00:02:43.049> because<00:02:43.230> as<00:02:43.650> you

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
brackets those are there because as you

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.190 
brackets those are there because as you
can<00:02:44.010> see<00:02:44.250> this<00:02:44.730> is<00:02:44.909> the<00:02:45.030> beginning<00:02:45.359> racket<00:02:45.989> of

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
can see this is the beginning racket of

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.990 
can see this is the beginning racket of
writing<00:02:46.769> and<00:02:47.010> it<00:02:47.250> does<00:02:47.400> not<00:02:47.549> have<00:02:47.760> an<00:02:47.879> end

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
writing and it does not have an end

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.449 
writing and it does not have an end
bracket<00:02:48.359> so<00:02:48.540> basically<00:02:48.870> it's<00:02:49.170> a<00:02:49.470> writing<00:02:50.099> tag

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
bracket so basically it's a writing tag

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.670 
bracket so basically it's a writing tag
inside<00:02:51.030> a<00:02:51.060> writing<00:02:51.480> tag<00:02:51.690> inside<00:02:52.200> of<00:02:52.349> writing

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
inside a writing tag inside of writing

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.099 
inside a writing tag inside of writing
tag<00:02:52.889> inside<00:02:53.310> of<00:02:53.459> writing<00:02:53.760> and<00:02:54.000> so<00:02:54.480> on<00:02:54.720> and<00:02:54.959> so

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:55.109 
tag inside of writing and so on and so

00:02:55.109 --> 00:02:57.649 
tag inside of writing and so on and so
on<00:02:55.170> now<00:02:55.769> all<00:02:56.040> you<00:02:56.250> have<00:02:56.280> to<00:02:56.639> do<00:02:56.819> is<00:02:57.060> copy<00:02:57.420> the

00:02:57.649 --> 00:02:57.659 
on now all you have to do is copy the

00:02:57.659 --> 00:02:59.089 
on now all you have to do is copy the
command<00:02:57.810> and<00:02:58.170> put<00:02:58.349> it<00:02:58.440> in<00:02:58.530> the<00:02:58.620> command<00:02:58.859> rock

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099 
command and put it in the command rock

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:02.000 
command and put it in the command rock
and<00:02:59.340> now<00:02:59.730> make<00:02:59.970> sure<00:03:00.000> it<00:03:00.480> gets<00:03:00.659> fired<00:03:01.079> once<00:03:01.620> you

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
and now make sure it gets fired once you

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.910 
and now make sure it gets fired once you
right-click<00:03:02.310> the<00:03:02.790> spawn<00:03:03.090> egg<00:03:03.620> but<00:03:04.620> first

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
right-click the spawn egg but first

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.530 
right-click the spawn egg but first
you'll<00:03:05.159> have<00:03:05.310> to<00:03:05.430> give<00:03:05.700> yourself<00:03:05.819> the<00:03:06.269> spawn

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
you'll have to give yourself the spawn

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.440 
you'll have to give yourself the spawn
egg<00:03:06.780> and<00:03:07.049> that's<00:03:07.290> done<00:03:07.560> using<00:03:07.799> this<00:03:08.099> command

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
egg and that's done using this command

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.830 
egg and that's done using this command
now<00:03:09.450> create<00:03:10.440> a<00:03:10.470> new<00:03:10.650> objective<00:03:10.950> that<00:03:11.790> has<00:03:12.359> the

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
now create a new objective that has the

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.819 
now create a new objective that has the
criteria<00:03:13.650> types<00:03:14.010> that<00:03:14.400> don't<00:03:14.670> use<00:03:15.510> item<00:03:15.989> 3<00:03:16.290> 8<00:03:16.560> 3

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:16.829 
criteria types that don't use item 3 8 3

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:20.180 
criteria types that don't use item 3 8 3
and<00:03:17.690> then<00:03:18.690> just<00:03:18.989> attach<00:03:19.109> this<00:03:19.560> command<00:03:19.980> to<00:03:20.160> a

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
and then just attach this command to a

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.400 
and then just attach this command to a
clock<00:03:20.579> that's<00:03:21.090> gonna<00:03:21.419> make<00:03:21.629> sure<00:03:21.900> your<00:03:22.109> score

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
clock that's gonna make sure your score

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:25.159 
clock that's gonna make sure your score
is<00:03:22.560> going<00:03:22.799> to<00:03:22.949> be<00:03:23.190> set<00:03:23.699> back<00:03:23.970> to<00:03:24.209> 0<00:03:24.510> once<00:03:24.900> you

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:25.169 
is going to be set back to 0 once you

00:03:25.169 --> 00:03:27.920 
is going to be set back to 0 once you
right-click<00:03:25.470> the<00:03:26.010> Yaak<00:03:26.340> and<00:03:26.669> it's<00:03:27.510> gonna<00:03:27.720> turn

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930 
right-click the Yaak and it's gonna turn

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.509 
right-click the Yaak and it's gonna turn
on<00:03:28.139> the<00:03:28.169> comparator<00:03:28.769> which<00:03:28.949> is<00:03:29.099> gonna<00:03:29.250> spawn

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
on the comparator which is gonna spawn

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:31.879 
on the comparator which is gonna spawn
the<00:03:29.699> nyan<00:03:29.910> cat<00:03:30.180> so<00:03:30.840> yeah<00:03:30.989> that's<00:03:31.290> it<00:03:31.500> I<00:03:31.680> hope

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:31.889 
the nyan cat so yeah that's it I hope
