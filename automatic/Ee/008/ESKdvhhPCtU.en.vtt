an<00:00:53.760> IKE<00:00:54.199> who's<00:00:55.199> in<00:00:55.320> a<00:00:55.379> kv-5<00:00:55.760> he<00:00:56.760> was<00:00:56.879> able<00:00:57.090> to

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
an IKE who's in a kv-5 he was able to

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.250 
an IKE who's in a kv-5 he was able to
put<00:00:57.300> in<00:00:57.390> two<00:00:57.570> meaty<00:00:57.780> shells<00:00:58.399> as<00:00:59.399> was<00:00:59.640> I<00:00:59.989> and<00:01:00.989> I

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
put in two meaty shells as was I and I

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.990 
put in two meaty shells as was I and I
set<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.770> tiger<00:01:02.070> two<00:01:02.219> on<00:01:02.399> fire<00:01:02.699> and

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
set the tiger two on fire and

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.390 
set the tiger two on fire and
considering<00:01:03.989> he<00:01:04.140> had<00:01:04.320> an<00:01:04.439> amazing<00:01:04.799> matchup<00:01:05.220> I

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
considering he had an amazing matchup I

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.219 
considering he had an amazing matchup I
think<00:01:05.640> he<00:01:05.729> just<00:01:05.880> had<00:01:06.030> a<00:01:06.060> very<00:01:06.299> bad<00:01:06.479> day<00:01:08.210> so<00:01:09.229> I'm

here
but<00:01:22.170> we<00:01:22.290> found<00:01:22.500> our<00:01:22.740> shot<00:01:23.009> and<00:01:23.400> we<00:01:23.490> put<00:01:23.700> in<00:01:23.820> a

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
but we found our shot and we put in a

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.670 
but we found our shot and we put in a
high<00:01:24.119> roll<00:01:24.420> on<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.689> comet<00:01:25.020> that<00:01:25.140> was<00:01:25.200> a<00:01:25.320> very

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
high roll on the comet that was a very

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:32.210 
high roll on the comet that was a very
high<00:01:25.920> role<00:01:26.130> of<00:01:26.340> 488<00:01:30.350> we<00:01:31.350> finish<00:01:31.710> him<00:01:31.799> off<00:01:31.950> with

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
high role of 488 we finish him off with

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.859 
high role of 488 we finish him off with
another<00:01:32.549> fairly<00:01:33.240> good<00:01:33.390> roll<00:01:33.570> of<00:01:33.720> 407<00:01:35.810> so<00:01:36.810> I'm

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
another fairly good roll of 407 so I'm

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.370 
another fairly good roll of 407 so I'm
putting<00:01:37.170> my<00:01:37.200> turret<00:01:37.650> towards<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.130> m6<00:01:38.520> here<00:01:38.759> I

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
putting my turret towards the m6 here I

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.740 
putting my turret towards the m6 here I
have<00:01:40.380> entangled<00:01:40.770> my<00:01:40.860> armor<00:01:41.100> very<00:01:41.310> well<00:01:41.750> but

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
have entangled my armor very well but

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.450 
have entangled my armor very well but
I'm<00:01:42.899> more<00:01:43.049> focused<00:01:43.259> on<00:01:43.649> putting<00:01:43.799> damage<00:01:44.250> and

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
I'm more focused on putting damage and

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.100 
I'm more focused on putting damage and
now<00:01:44.579> I<00:01:44.610> angled<00:01:45.030> my<00:01:45.119> armor<00:01:45.390> properly<00:01:45.810> against

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
now I angled my armor properly against

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.649 
now I angled my armor properly against
this<00:01:46.200> m6

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:52.870 

we<00:01:51.229> put<00:01:51.439> in<00:01:51.530> our<00:01:51.619> second<00:01:52.070> shell<00:01:52.250> taking<00:01:52.729> him

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:52.880 
we put in our second shell taking him

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.539 
we put in our second shell taking him
out<00:01:53.860> now<00:01:54.860> it's<00:01:55.009> time<00:01:55.310> to<00:01:55.579> close<00:01:56.000> the<00:01:56.180> distance

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:57.549 
out now it's time to close the distance

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:01.090 
out now it's time to close the distance
one<00:01:58.549> thing<00:01:58.759> I<00:01:58.909> found<00:01:59.509> at<00:01:59.720> the<00:01:59.840> is-6<00:02:00.259> is<00:02:00.560> that

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:01.100 
one thing I found at the is-6 is that

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.160

tanks at a matte weak points then you're

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:12.820

very very quickly very very aggressively

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:20.530 
very very quickly very very aggressively
this<00:05:18.470> is<00:05:18.710> rapidly<00:05:19.160> become<00:05:19.640> I<00:05:19.790> think<00:05:19.820> this<00:05:20.360> has

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:20.540 
this is rapidly become I think this has

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:22.300 
this is rapidly become I think this has
to<00:05:20.570> be<00:05:20.780> my<00:05:20.930> favorite<00:05:21.140> premium<00:05:21.800> tank<00:05:22.070> to

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:22.310 
to be my favorite premium tank to

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:24.190 
to be my favorite premium tank to
playing<00:05:22.730> the<00:05:22.850> game<00:05:23.060> for<00:05:23.270> making<00:05:23.570> money<00:05:23.720> now<00:05:24.050> I

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:24.200 
playing the game for making money now I

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.010 
playing the game for making money now I
have<00:05:24.920> great<00:05:25.250> results<00:05:25.400> in<00:05:25.790> this<00:05:25.910> tank<00:05:26.120> because

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:27.020 
have great results in this tank because

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:28.780 
have great results in this tank because
it<00:05:27.050> matches<00:05:27.860> my<00:05:27.980> playstyle<00:05:28.430> which<00:05:28.670> is

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:28.790 
it matches my playstyle which is

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:31.270 
it matches my playstyle which is
aggression<00:05:29.120> and<00:05:29.450> high<00:05:29.630> DPM<00:05:30.140> and<00:05:30.380> still<00:05:31.010> having

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:31.280 
aggression and high DPM and still having

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.130 
aggression and high DPM and still having
the<00:05:31.370> armor<00:05:31.670> to<00:05:31.790> bounce<00:05:32.030> the<00:05:32.270> lower<00:05:32.420> tier<00:05:32.690> tanks

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:33.140 
the armor to bounce the lower tier tanks

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:35.110 
the armor to bounce the lower tier tanks
so<00:05:33.350> you<00:05:33.440> can<00:05:33.710> literally<00:05:34.010> just<00:05:34.160> roll<00:05:34.460> it<00:05:34.640> tier<00:05:34.820> 6

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:35.120 
so you can literally just roll it tier 6

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.880 
so you can literally just roll it tier 6
tanks<00:05:35.450> with<00:05:35.630> reckless<00:05:36.110> abandon<00:05:36.590> and<00:05:36.680> they've

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:36.890 
tanks with reckless abandon and they've

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:39.160 
tanks with reckless abandon and they've
not<00:05:37.160> got<00:05:37.430> any<00:05:37.670> chance<00:05:38.240> to<00:05:38.450> really<00:05:38.660> penetrate

00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:39.170 
not got any chance to really penetrate

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:40.810 
not got any chance to really penetrate
you<00:05:39.260> unless<00:05:39.470> they<00:05:39.530> get<00:05:39.830> that<00:05:40.040> your<00:05:40.280> flank<00:05:40.580> I

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:40.820 
you unless they get that your flank I

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:42.850 
you unless they get that your flank I
fully<00:05:41.330> recommend<00:05:41.690> the<00:05:41.900> is-6<00:05:42.380> it's<00:05:42.680> an

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:42.860 
fully recommend the is-6 it's an

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.040 
fully recommend the is-6 it's an
absolute<00:05:43.430> beast<00:05:43.640> and<00:05:43.910> you<00:05:44.030> really<00:05:44.480> can't<00:05:44.840> go

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.050 
absolute beast and you really can't go

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:46.960 
absolute beast and you really can't go
wrong<00:05:45.080> with<00:05:45.470> this<00:05:45.650> tank<00:05:45.890> it's<00:05:46.700> very

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:46.970 
wrong with this tank it's very

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:48.880 
wrong with this tank it's very
interesting<00:05:47.240> because<00:05:47.630> an<00:05:48.110> unskilled<00:05:48.650> player

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:48.890 
interesting because an unskilled player

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:52.060 
interesting because an unskilled player
can<00:05:49.130> do<00:05:49.280> well<00:05:49.460> in<00:05:49.610> the<00:05:49.700> I<00:05:49.730> 6<00:05:50.150> and<00:05:50.420> I<00:05:51.290> feel<00:05:51.800> that<00:05:52.040> a

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:52.070 
can do well in the I 6 and I feel that a

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:54.400 
can do well in the I 6 and I feel that a
high<00:05:52.310> skilled<00:05:52.640> player<00:05:52.910> can<00:05:53.390> know<00:05:54.080> what<00:05:54.290> the

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:54.410 
high skilled player can know what the

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:56.830 
high skilled player can know what the
weak<00:05:54.530> points<00:05:54.890> are<00:05:55.010> of<00:05:55.160> this<00:05:55.280> tank<00:05:55.550> and<00:05:55.840> really

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:56.840 
weak points are of this tank and really

00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.740 
weak points are of this tank and really
just<00:05:57.500> use<00:05:57.740> its<00:05:57.920> strong<00:05:58.220> points<00:05:58.700> to<00:05:58.910> maximize

00:05:59.740 --> 00:05:59.750 
just use its strong points to maximize

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:01.510 
just use its strong points to maximize
the<00:06:00.080> amount<00:06:00.170> of<00:06:00.530> impact<00:06:00.950> that<00:06:01.070> you<00:06:01.190> can<00:06:01.220> have

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:01.520 
the amount of impact that you can have

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.460 
the amount of impact that you can have
in<00:06:01.640> the<00:06:01.730> game<00:06:01.760> it's<00:06:02.510> an<00:06:02.630> absolute<00:06:02.960> beast<00:06:03.170> mode

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:03.470
