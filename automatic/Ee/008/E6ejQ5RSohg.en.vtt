sorry keyboard mouse webcam Raspberry Pi
and<00:00:13.560> monitor<00:00:15.299> for<00:00:16.320> booting<00:00:17.320> Raspberry<00:00:17.679> Pi

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:18.279 
and monitor for booting Raspberry Pi

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:23.579 
and monitor for booting Raspberry Pi
we<00:00:18.849> must<00:00:19.089> put<00:00:20.730> microUSB<00:00:21.730> power<00:00:22.079> on<00:00:23.079> must<00:00:23.439> be

00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:23.589 
we must put microUSB power on must be

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:26.669 
we must put microUSB power on must be
API<00:00:24.269> so<00:00:25.269> this<00:00:25.539> is<00:00:25.659> the<00:00:25.749> booting<00:00:26.079> of<00:00:26.199> Raspberry

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:26.679 
API so this is the booting of Raspberry

00:00:26.679 --> 00:00:50.520 
API so this is the booting of Raspberry
Pi

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:50.530 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:57.150 

okay<00:00:51.129> for<00:00:51.460> dojin<00:00:52.059> we<00:00:52.539> must<00:00:52.780> type<00:00:53.160> VI<00:00:56.160> for

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:57.160 
okay for dojin we must type VI for

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:04.759 
okay for dojin we must type VI for
password<00:00:57.760> is<00:00:58.000> raspberry

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.760 

okay<00:01:05.369> before<00:01:05.790> about<00:01:06.090> the<00:01:06.210> desktop<00:01:06.659> you<00:01:06.960> must

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
okay before about the desktop you must

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:22.000 
okay before about the desktop you must
type<00:01:08.130> star<00:01:08.790> text<00:01:09.149> to<00:01:09.329> go<00:01:09.479> to<00:01:09.540> desktop

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.010 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:25.690 

so<00:01:22.610> this<00:01:22.820> is<00:01:22.970> the<00:01:23.090> desktop<00:01:23.360> of<00:01:23.600> raspbian<00:01:24.700> the

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:25.700 
so this is the desktop of raspbian the

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.860 
so this is the desktop of raspbian the
operating<00:01:26.090> system<00:01:26.420> of<00:01:26.630> Raspberry<00:01:27.230> Pi<00:01:27.730> after

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:28.870 
operating system of Raspberry Pi after

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:34.960 
operating system of Raspberry Pi after
booting<00:01:29.870> go<00:01:30.560> to<00:01:30.620> the<00:01:30.800> fete

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:42.740 

then<00:01:35.600> open<00:01:36.050> the<00:01:36.290> program

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.560 

this<00:01:43.750> is<00:01:43.900> a<00:01:44.250> protection<00:01:45.250> program<00:01:45.730> using

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
this is a protection program using

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.560 
this is a protection program using
Raspberry<00:01:46.900> Pi<00:01:47.520> this<00:01:48.520> is<00:01:48.640> a<00:01:48.670> coordinate<00:01:49.300> fest

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:49.570 
Raspberry Pi this is a coordinate fest

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.740 
Raspberry Pi this is a coordinate fest
of<00:01:49.810> epi<00:01:50.440> the<00:01:51.130> function<00:01:51.430> of<00:01:51.550> coordinate<00:01:52.000> is<00:01:52.150> to

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
of epi the function of coordinate is to

00:01:52.750 --> 00:02:06.090 
of epi the function of coordinate is to
find<00:01:53.020> a<00:01:53.110> position<00:01:53.260> of<00:01:53.640> face<00:01:56.970> next<00:02:00.270> to<00:02:01.270> me<00:02:01.420> now

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:35.770 

okay<00:02:06.790> click<00:02:07.659> fighter<00:02:10.080> this

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:35.780 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.290 

so<00:02:36.290> this<00:02:36.530> is<00:02:36.650> fast<00:02:37.340> detection<00:02:37.820> you<00:02:37.970> see<00:02:38.120> not

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:38.300 
so this is fast detection you see not

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.320 
so this is fast detection you see not
very<00:02:38.480> clear<00:02:38.690> if<00:02:39.160> the<00:02:40.160> camera<00:02:40.550> catch<00:02:40.850> the<00:02:41.090> face

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
very clear if the camera catch the face

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.240 
very clear if the camera catch the face
it<00:02:41.990> will<00:02:42.290> show<00:02:43.100> the<00:02:43.310> coordinate<00:02:43.670> of<00:02:43.700> face<00:02:45.250> if

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250 
it will show the coordinate of face if

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.140 
it will show the coordinate of face if
the<00:02:46.940> camera<00:02:47.270> cannot<00:02:47.690> catch<00:02:48.440> the<00:02:48.470> face<00:02:48.940> it<00:02:49.940> will

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
the camera cannot catch the face it will

00:02:50.150 --> 00:03:00.830 
the camera cannot catch the face it will
show<00:02:51.370> no<00:02:52.370> first<00:02:52.670> detected

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:07.580 

then<00:03:01.440> close

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.550 

okay<00:03:08.220> after<00:03:09.060> that<00:03:09.420> go<00:03:10.349> to<00:03:10.410> the<00:03:10.560> next<00:03:10.920> program

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
okay after that go to the next program

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:32.330 
okay after that go to the next program
file

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.750 

this<00:03:33.340> is<00:03:33.490> the<00:03:33.670> program<00:03:34.150> of<00:03:35.760> visualizing

visualizing<00:05:33.860> face<00:05:34.779> for<00:05:35.779> laptop<00:05:36.169> you<00:05:36.800> can<00:05:37.009> make

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:37.520 
visualizing face for laptop you can make

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:41.049 
visualizing face for laptop you can make
real<00:05:37.729> time<00:05:37.849> for<00:05:38.689> face<00:05:38.929> detection<00:05:39.969> just<00:05:40.969> a

real time for face detection just a

00:05:41.059 --> 00:05:59.290 
real time for face detection just a
program<00:05:41.679> director

00:05:59.290 --> 00:05:59.300 

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:06.480
