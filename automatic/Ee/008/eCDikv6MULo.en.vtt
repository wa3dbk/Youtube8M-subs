00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
about a project that I've been doing for

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.289 
about a project that I've been doing for
one<00:01:01.790> of<00:01:01.879> my<00:01:02.000> modules<00:01:02.449> in<00:01:02.629> third<00:01:02.869> year<00:01:03.080> which<00:01:03.739> is

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:04.299 
one of my modules in third year which is

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:07.390 
one of my modules in third year which is
3d<00:01:05.299> scene<00:01:05.540> in<00:01:05.720> DirectX<00:01:06.350> using<00:01:06.830> shader

languages<00:01:08.500> so<00:01:09.609> while<00:01:10.609> you<00:01:10.759> do<00:01:10.880> for<00:01:11.060> this

00:01:11.139 --> 00:01:11.149 
languages so while you do for this

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:14.319 
languages so while you do for this
coursework<00:01:11.719> is<00:01:12.579> basically<00:01:13.579> elaborated<00:01:14.210> upon

00:01:14.319 --> 00:01:14.329 
coursework is basically elaborated upon

00:01:14.329 --> 00:01:16.840 
coursework is basically elaborated upon
something<00:01:14.810> you've<00:01:15.079> done<00:01:15.229> in<00:01:15.380> second<00:01:15.829> year<00:01:15.950> in

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
something you've done in second year in

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.690 
something you've done in second year in
second<00:01:17.450> year<00:01:17.570> we<00:01:17.750> done<00:01:18.170> it<00:01:18.289> to<00:01:18.770> a<00:01:19.039> 3d<00:01:19.369> scene

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
second year we done it to a 3d scene

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.910 
second year we done it to a 3d scene
using<00:01:20.090> OpenGL<00:01:20.390> that<00:01:21.049> used<00:01:21.409> the<00:01:21.649> fixed

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
using OpenGL that used the fixed

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.300 
using OpenGL that used the fixed
function<00:01:22.189> pipeline<00:01:23.560> you<00:01:24.560> taught<00:01:24.859> all<00:01:25.070> about

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
function pipeline you taught all about

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.169 
function pipeline you taught all about
that<00:01:25.520> in<00:01:25.880> second<00:01:26.359> year<00:01:26.509> and<00:01:27.759> it's<00:01:28.759> very

00:01:29.169 --> 00:01:29.179 
that in second year and it's very

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:31.980 
that in second year and it's very
limited<00:01:29.689> it<00:01:29.990> comes<00:01:30.200> with<00:01:30.409> a<00:01:30.799> lot<00:01:31.310> of<00:01:31.490> limited

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
limited it comes with a lot of limited

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.929 
limited it comes with a lot of limited
functionality<00:01:32.990> such<00:01:33.829> as<00:01:33.859> the<00:01:34.130> lighting<00:01:34.340> is

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:34.939 
functionality such as the lighting is

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:38.940 
functionality such as the lighting is
very<00:01:35.270> cubed<00:01:36.079> and<00:01:36.579> comes<00:01:37.579> with<00:01:37.759> a<00:01:37.789> lot<00:01:37.999> of<00:01:38.030> flaws

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950 
very cubed and comes with a lot of flaws

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.539 
very cubed and comes with a lot of flaws
so<00:01:39.950> within<00:01:40.579> the<00:01:41.390> third<00:01:42.140> year<00:01:42.350> we<00:01:42.740> develop<00:01:43.159> a<00:01:43.249> 3d

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549 
so within the third year we develop a 3d

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:45.999 
so within the third year we develop a 3d
scene<00:01:43.909> and<00:01:44.210> it's<00:01:44.899> all<00:01:45.049> done<00:01:45.259> from<00:01:45.469> the<00:01:45.770> shader

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
scene and it's all done from the shader

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:50.260 
scene and it's all done from the shader
so<00:01:46.759> we<00:01:46.880> get<00:01:47.090> this<00:01:47.630> nice<00:01:48.490> shaded<00:01:49.490> out<00:01:49.639> approach

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
so we get this nice shaded out approach

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.230 
so we get this nice shaded out approach
and<00:01:50.689> it<00:01:51.020> looks<00:01:51.229> very<00:01:51.530> natural<00:01:51.909> so<00:01:52.909> we<00:01:53.030> take

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
and it looks very natural so we take

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:59.319 
and it looks very natural so we take
more<00:01:53.479> control<00:01:53.659> over<00:01:53.960> the<00:01:54.560> pipeline<00:01:57.280> in<00:01:58.329> second

00:01:59.319 --> 00:01:59.329 
more control over the pipeline in second

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:00.879 
more control over the pipeline in second
year<00:01:59.389> you<00:01:59.509> also<00:01:59.689> learn<00:01:59.990> how<00:02:00.079> to<00:02:00.229> make<00:02:00.499> 2d

00:02:00.879 --> 00:02:00.889 
year you also learn how to make 2d

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:04.719 
year you also learn how to make 2d
scenes<00:02:01.179> which<00:02:02.179> I<00:02:02.630> added<00:02:03.590> upon<00:02:03.889> some<00:02:04.520> game

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
scenes which I added upon some game

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:09.130 
scenes which I added upon some game
logic<00:02:04.939> into<00:02:05.420> a<00:02:05.990> playable<00:02:06.950> game<00:02:07.750> which<00:02:08.750> is<00:02:08.929> more

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
logic into a playable game which is more

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.650 
logic into a playable game which is more
fun<00:02:09.350> and<00:02:09.590> that<00:02:10.520> comes<00:02:10.789> from<00:02:10.910> our<00:02:11.270> first-year

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
fun and that comes from our first-year

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.490 
fun and that comes from our first-year
knowledge<00:02:12.110> that<00:02:12.710> is<00:02:13.010> to<00:02:13.520> create<00:02:13.820> a<00:02:14.500> console

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
knowledge that is to create a console

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.160 
knowledge that is to create a console
based<00:02:15.740> application

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
based application

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.460 
based application
does<00:02:18.170> something<00:02:18.440> graphically<00:02:19.129> I'm<00:02:19.550> fun<00:02:20.470> so

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
does something graphically I'm fun so

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:22.809 
does something graphically I'm fun so
how<00:02:21.590> long<00:02:21.739> did<00:02:21.890> actually<00:02:22.099> take<00:02:22.519> you<00:02:22.790> to

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819 
how long did actually take you to

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:27.100 
how long did actually take you to
complete<00:02:23.090> this<00:02:23.450> project<00:02:24.099> too<00:02:25.099> long<00:02:25.870> it<00:02:26.870> took

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
complete this project too long it took

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.119 
complete this project too long it took
me<00:02:27.170> about<00:02:28.690> 14<00:02:29.690> solid<00:02:30.170> days<00:02:30.379> to<00:02:30.739> make<00:02:30.890> this

00:02:31.119 --> 00:02:31.129 
me about 14 solid days to make this

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:33.880 
me about 14 solid days to make this
because<00:02:31.819> the<00:02:32.540> coursework<00:02:33.200> requirement

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
because the coursework requirement

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.250 
because the coursework requirement
requires<00:02:34.459> some<00:02:34.910> of<00:02:35.150> the<00:02:35.299> work<00:02:35.450> done<00:02:35.840> in<00:02:36.110> the

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
requires some of the work done in the

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.280 
requires some of the work done in the
vertex<00:02:36.590> shader<00:02:36.739> and<00:02:37.250> fragment<00:02:37.459> shader<00:02:38.180> as<00:02:38.480> I

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
vertex shader and fragment shader as I

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.890 
vertex shader and fragment shader as I
decided<00:02:39.680> to<00:02:39.890> do<00:02:40.010> it<00:02:40.160> all<00:02:40.400> from<00:02:41.060> the<00:02:41.330> vertex<00:02:41.660> and

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
decided to do it all from the vertex and

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:43.600 
decided to do it all from the vertex and
fragment<00:02:41.930> shader<00:02:42.500> which<00:02:43.010> meant<00:02:43.280> I<00:02:43.400> give

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
fragment shader which meant I give

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.729 
fragment shader which meant I give
myself<00:02:43.819> quite<00:02:44.390> a<00:02:44.420> bit<00:02:44.629> more<00:02:44.780> work<00:02:45.049> in<00:02:45.410> order<00:02:45.560> to

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739 
myself quite a bit more work in order to

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:49.059 
myself quite a bit more work in order to
get<00:02:46.040> a<00:02:46.310> more<00:02:46.580> impressive<00:02:47.450> scene<00:02:47.690> like<00:02:48.349> you<00:02:48.920> get

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:49.069 
get a more impressive scene like you get

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:51.130 
get a more impressive scene like you get
the<00:02:49.160> grass<00:02:49.370> moving<00:02:49.970> which<00:02:50.360> is<00:02:50.510> all<00:02:50.660> done<00:02:50.930> from

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
the grass moving which is all done from

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.600 
the grass moving which is all done from
the<00:02:51.290> pipeline<00:02:51.709> so<00:02:51.920> that's<00:02:52.099> all<00:02:52.220> done<00:02:52.250> on<00:02:52.519> the

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
the pipeline so that's all done on the

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.130 
the pipeline so that's all done on the
graphics<00:02:53.000> card<00:02:53.090> so<00:02:53.540> it<00:02:53.630> doesn't<00:02:53.930> infringe

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
graphics card so it doesn't infringe

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.120 
graphics card so it doesn't infringe
upon<00:02:54.319> the<00:02:54.590> CPU<00:02:55.010> which<00:02:55.220> in<00:02:55.700> modern<00:02:55.970> games<00:02:56.390> is<00:02:56.720> a

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130 
upon the CPU which in modern games is a

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.160 
upon the CPU which in modern games is a
tactic<00:02:58.130> that's<00:02:58.370> always<00:02:58.730> used<00:02:59.360> you<00:02:59.660> always

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:00.170 
tactic that's always used you always

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.050 
tactic that's always used you always
have<00:03:00.349> to<00:03:00.560> get<00:03:00.769> as<00:03:00.920> much<00:03:01.190> of<00:03:01.250> the<00:03:01.430> process<00:03:01.640> and

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
have to get as much of the process and

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.020 
have to get as much of the process and
into<00:03:02.299> the<00:03:02.390> GPU<00:03:02.810> from<00:03:03.079> the<00:03:03.230> CPU<00:03:03.590> as<00:03:03.709> possible<00:03:04.190> so

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
into the GPU from the CPU as possible so

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.000 
into the GPU from the CPU as possible so
how<00:03:05.180> much<00:03:05.360> of<00:03:05.420> this<00:03:05.750> we<00:03:05.959> actually<00:03:06.200> taught<00:03:06.769> in

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
how much of this we actually taught in

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.500 
how much of this we actually taught in
how<00:03:07.129> much<00:03:07.250> did<00:03:07.489> you<00:03:07.579> have<00:03:07.700> to<00:03:07.910> find<00:03:08.209> out<00:03:08.360> for

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
how much did you have to find out for

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.580 
how much did you have to find out for
yourself<00:03:08.840> a<00:03:09.220> lot<00:03:10.220> of<00:03:10.310> it<00:03:10.459> was<00:03:10.760> taught<00:03:11.150> we<00:03:11.930> get

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
yourself a lot of it was taught we get

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.140 
yourself a lot of it was taught we get
taught<00:03:13.720> basics<00:03:14.720> of<00:03:15.140> everything<00:03:15.829> like<00:03:16.519> we<00:03:17.000> were

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
taught basics of everything like we were

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.509 
taught basics of everything like we were
taught<00:03:17.360> how<00:03:17.390> to<00:03:17.599> render<00:03:18.200> basic<00:03:18.739> grass<00:03:18.980> with<00:03:19.340> no

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 
taught how to render basic grass with no

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:23.620 
taught how to render basic grass with no
movement<00:03:20.030> and<00:03:21.670> that<00:03:22.670> was<00:03:22.850> basically<00:03:23.120> it

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
movement and that was basically it

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:26.470 
movement and that was basically it
was<00:03:24.380> pointing<00:03:25.100> towards<00:03:25.489> the<00:03:25.579> camera<00:03:25.819> from<00:03:26.299> the

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
was pointing towards the camera from the

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.199 
was pointing towards the camera from the
CPU<00:03:27.019> which<00:03:27.590> obviously<00:03:28.220> defeats<00:03:28.700> the<00:03:28.819> point<00:03:28.970> of

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:29.209 
CPU which obviously defeats the point of

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:32.830 
CPU which obviously defeats the point of
the<00:03:29.540> more<00:03:30.530> modern<00:03:30.950> techniques<00:03:31.519> which<00:03:32.209> is<00:03:32.540> to

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
the more modern techniques which is to

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.449 
the more modern techniques which is to
do<00:03:33.079> it<00:03:33.170> all<00:03:33.290> in<00:03:33.440> the<00:03:33.590> CPU<00:03:33.950> and<00:03:34.130> if<00:03:34.190> I<00:03:34.310> actually

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
do it all in the CPU and if I actually

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:38.229 
do it all in the CPU and if I actually
go<00:03:34.700> above<00:03:34.910> it<00:03:35.060> it<00:03:35.840> shows<00:03:36.650> the<00:03:37.160> effect<00:03:37.310> falling

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
go above it it shows the effect falling

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:39.640 
go above it it shows the effect falling
over<00:03:38.569> because<00:03:38.870> you<00:03:38.959> wouldn't<00:03:39.139> be<00:03:39.230> able<00:03:39.319> to<00:03:39.560> do

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
over because you wouldn't be able to do

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:41.650 
over because you wouldn't be able to do
that<00:03:39.799> in<00:03:39.889> a<00:03:39.950> proper<00:03:40.250> game<00:03:40.400> where<00:03:40.910> there's<00:03:41.359> one

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660 
that in a proper game where there's one

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:45.580 
that in a proper game where there's one
quad<00:03:42.019> and<00:03:42.319> pointing<00:03:42.950> towards<00:03:43.370> you<00:03:43.489> and<00:03:44.590> that

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:45.590 
quad and pointing towards you and that

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.860 
quad and pointing towards you and that
saves<00:03:46.099> a<00:03:46.280> lot<00:03:46.459> of<00:03:46.519> CPU<00:03:46.790> efficiency<00:03:47.480> so<00:03:47.720> it's

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:47.870 
saves a lot of CPU efficiency so it's

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.650 
saves a lot of CPU efficiency so it's
traditionally<00:03:48.530> done<00:03:48.739> was<00:03:49.010> six<00:03:49.849> quad<00:03:50.180> strong

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
traditionally done was six quad strong

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.680 
traditionally done was six quad strong
and<00:03:51.669> appear<00:03:52.669> like<00:03:53.000> as<00:03:53.120> if<00:03:53.239> they<00:03:53.389> were<00:03:53.480> looking

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
and appear like as if they were looking

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.159 
and appear like as if they were looking
at<00:03:53.840> you<00:03:54.079> but<00:03:54.919> was<00:03:55.310> waste<00:03:55.519> in<00:03:55.790> a<00:03:55.880> lot<00:03:56.120> of

00:03:56.159 --> 00:03:56.169 
at you but was waste in a lot of

00:03:56.169 --> 00:04:00.250 
at you but was waste in a lot of
processor<00:03:57.169> time<00:03:57.709> and<00:03:58.010> rendering<00:03:58.730> time<00:03:59.260> how

much<00:04:00.410> help<00:04:00.650> did<00:04:00.829> you<00:04:00.980> get<00:04:01.280> from<00:04:01.459> the<00:04:01.549> lecturers

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
much help did you get from the lecturers

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.520 
much help did you get from the lecturers
with<00:04:02.269> this<00:04:02.540> a<00:04:02.900> lot<00:04:03.799> of<00:04:03.919> help<00:04:04.989> one<00:04:05.989> day<00:04:06.019> when<00:04:06.500> I

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.530 
with this a lot of help one day when I

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:08.830 
with this a lot of help one day when I
was<00:04:06.709> stuck<00:04:07.040> on<00:04:07.250> my<00:04:07.579> glow<00:04:07.910> effect<00:04:08.299> which<00:04:08.630> you

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
was stuck on my glow effect which you

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:10.690 
was stuck on my glow effect which you
can<00:04:09.019> see<00:04:09.230> on<00:04:09.380> the<00:04:09.500> tank<00:04:09.769> the<00:04:10.069> tank<00:04:10.250> is<00:04:10.459> glowing

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
can see on the tank the tank is glowing

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:14.289 
can see on the tank the tank is glowing
in<00:04:11.060> the<00:04:11.540> scene<00:04:12.040> the<00:04:13.040> lecturer<00:04:13.700> who<00:04:13.970> clocked

00:04:14.289 --> 00:04:14.299

help me out of his own free time and

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:21.490 
help me out of his own free time and
didn't<00:04:19.190> get<00:04:19.310> paid<00:04:19.519> for<00:04:19.789> that<00:04:19.910> time<00:04:20.180> so<00:04:20.720> the

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
didn't get paid for that time so the

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.040 
didn't get paid for that time so the
lecturers<00:04:22.099> are<00:04:22.310> brilliant<00:04:23.060> on<00:04:23.389> this<00:04:23.780> course

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
lecturers are brilliant on this course

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.990 
lecturers are brilliant on this course
Oh

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
Oh

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.070 
Oh
I'm<00:04:25.450> incredible<00:04:26.220> if<00:04:27.220> I<00:04:27.400> ever<00:04:27.720> come<00:04:28.720> into<00:04:28.960> any

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
I'm incredible if I ever come into any

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.320 
I'm incredible if I ever come into any
trouble<00:04:29.410> so<00:04:30.280> how<00:04:30.520> did<00:04:30.670> you<00:04:30.790> find<00:04:31.000> the<00:04:31.120> first

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
trouble so how did you find the first

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:34.590 
trouble so how did you find the first
year<00:04:31.660> the<00:04:32.200> first<00:04:32.230> year<00:04:32.580> I<00:04:33.580> was<00:04:34.270> very

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:34.600 
year the first year I was very

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.330 
year the first year I was very
interested<00:04:34.900> in<00:04:35.200> programming<00:04:35.830> before<00:04:35.980> I<00:04:36.160> came

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
interested in programming before I came

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.640 
interested in programming before I came
to<00:04:36.370> first<00:04:36.670> year<00:04:36.880> and<00:04:37.060> also<00:04:37.180> the<00:04:37.870> maths<00:04:38.170> so<00:04:38.530> the

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
to first year and also the maths so the

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:42.990 
to first year and also the maths so the
first<00:04:38.890> year<00:04:39.190> was<00:04:39.850> a<00:04:39.880> bit<00:04:40.120> slow<00:04:40.540> for<00:04:40.840> me<00:04:42.000> you

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:43.000 
first year was a bit slow for me you

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.820 
first year was a bit slow for me you
learn<00:04:43.270> all<00:04:43.450> the<00:04:43.570> basic<00:04:43.960> techniques<00:04:44.410> which

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:44.830 
learn all the basic techniques which

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:48.330 
learn all the basic techniques which
brings<00:04:45.520> me<00:04:45.730> into<00:04:45.970> this<00:04:46.090> project<00:04:46.920> where<00:04:47.920> all

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
brings me into this project where all

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.050 
brings me into this project where all
the<00:04:48.720> work<00:04:49.720> we<00:04:49.960> do<00:04:50.110> is<00:04:50.410> console<00:04:51.280> based<00:04:51.460> so<00:04:51.940> the

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060 
the work we do is console based so the

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:56.130 
the work we do is console based so the
old-style<00:04:52.480> type<00:04:53.410> things<00:04:53.890> in<00:04:54.130> and<00:04:54.370> you<00:04:55.080> into<00:04:56.080> a

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:56.140 
old-style type things in and you into a

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:59.490 
old-style type things in and you into a
console<00:04:56.640> with<00:04:57.640> no<00:04:57.910> real<00:04:58.270> graphical<00:04:59.020> ability

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
console with no real graphical ability

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:03.120 
console with no real graphical ability
and<00:05:00.660> it's<00:05:01.660> fun<00:05:01.960> because<00:05:02.350> you<00:05:02.440> learn<00:05:02.620> loads<00:05:02.980> of

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:03.130 
and it's fun because you learn loads of

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:05.460 
and it's fun because you learn loads of
new<00:05:03.610> little<00:05:03.940> techniques<00:05:04.870> that<00:05:05.080> you<00:05:05.169> wouldn't

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:05.470 
new little techniques that you wouldn't

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:08.790 
new little techniques that you wouldn't
have<00:05:05.530> thought<00:05:05.590> of<00:05:06.130> before<00:05:07.230> but<00:05:08.230> you<00:05:08.530> just

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:08.800 
have thought of before but you just

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:10.710 
have thought of before but you just
can't<00:05:09.010> wait<00:05:09.220> to<00:05:09.400> go<00:05:09.520> into<00:05:09.730> second<00:05:10.150> year<00:05:10.330> where

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:10.720 
can't wait to go into second year where

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:16.200 
can't wait to go into second year where
we<00:05:11.730> develop<00:05:12.730> our<00:05:13.450> 2d<00:05:13.960> scenes<00:05:14.260> and<00:05:15.060> start<00:05:16.060> to

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:16.210 
we develop our 2d scenes and start to

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:19.470 
we develop our 2d scenes and start to
add<00:05:16.330> the<00:05:16.570> graphics<00:05:17.080> to<00:05:17.500> the<00:05:17.650> games<00:05:18.210> so<00:05:19.210> tell<00:05:19.390> me

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:19.480 
add the graphics to the games so tell me

00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:21.000 
add the graphics to the games so tell me
about<00:05:19.570> the<00:05:19.750> computers<00:05:20.140> you<00:05:20.169> have<00:05:20.320> access<00:05:20.770> to

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:21.010 
about the computers you have access to

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:24.240 
about the computers you have access to
well<00:05:21.730> first<00:05:21.940> of<00:05:22.060> all<00:05:22.120> we<00:05:22.720> have<00:05:22.960> quad<00:05:23.320> core<00:05:23.350> i7s

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:24.250 
well first of all we have quad core i7s

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:26.460 
well first of all we have quad core i7s
by<00:05:24.550> Intel<00:05:24.940> which<00:05:25.300> is<00:05:25.510> the<00:05:25.690> top<00:05:25.930> notch<00:05:26.169> of<00:05:26.380> the

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:26.470 
by Intel which is the top notch of the

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:29.550 
by Intel which is the top notch of the
processors<00:05:27.040> then<00:05:28.000> you<00:05:28.150> have<00:05:28.360> 8<00:05:28.660> gigs<00:05:28.960> of<00:05:29.169> ddr3

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:29.560 
processors then you have 8 gigs of ddr3

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:32.460 
processors then you have 8 gigs of ddr3
RAM<00:05:29.740> which<00:05:30.700> as<00:05:31.360> far<00:05:31.419> as<00:05:31.720> I<00:05:31.810> know<00:05:31.870> comes<00:05:32.200> at<00:05:32.320> what

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:32.470 
RAM which as far as I know comes at what

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:35.070 
RAM which as far as I know comes at what
are<00:05:32.590> the<00:05:32.650> seven<00:05:33.160> megahertz<00:05:33.700> just<00:05:34.450> the<00:05:34.630> fastest

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:35.080 
are the seven megahertz just the fastest

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:36.360 
are the seven megahertz just the fastest
you<00:05:35.169> can<00:05:35.200> get<00:05:35.500> for<00:05:35.680> the<00:05:35.740> yeah<00:05:35.860> three<00:05:36.100> at<00:05:36.250> the

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:36.370 
you can get for the yeah three at the

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:40.770 
you can get for the yeah three at the
moment<00:05:36.729> for<00:05:37.120> these<00:05:37.210> ones<00:05:37.470> we<00:05:38.470> have<00:05:38.680> Windows<00:05:39.780> 7

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:40.780 
moment for these ones we have Windows 7

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:45.750 
moment for these ones we have Windows 7
64<00:05:41.229> bit<00:05:41.729> which<00:05:42.729> allows<00:05:43.000> us<00:05:43.240> a<00:05:43.390> lot<00:05:43.720> of<00:05:43.990> power<00:05:44.919> to

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:45.760 
64 bit which allows us a lot of power to

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:47.659 
64 bit which allows us a lot of power to
use<00:05:45.880> the<00:05:46.150> full<00:05:46.300> potential<00:05:46.600> of<00:05:46.810> the<00:05:46.930> ROM<00:05:47.110> and

00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:47.669 
use the full potential of the ROM and

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:50.219 
use the full potential of the ROM and
then<00:05:48.669> we<00:05:48.880> have<00:05:49.090> our<00:05:49.330> graphics<00:05:49.720> card<00:05:49.930> which<00:05:50.200> is

00:05:50.219 --> 00:05:50.229 
then we have our graphics card which is

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:54.900 
then we have our graphics card which is
NVIDIA<00:05:51.190> GeForce<00:05:51.460> GTX<00:05:52.390> 285<00:05:53.080> which<00:05:53.950> is<00:05:54.190> not<00:05:54.580> the

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:54.910 
NVIDIA GeForce GTX 285 which is not the

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:56.850 
NVIDIA GeForce GTX 285 which is not the
newest<00:05:55.240> one<00:05:55.419> but<00:05:55.810> one<00:05:56.169> of<00:05:56.229> the<00:05:56.350> most<00:05:56.620> powerful

00:05:56.850 --> 00:05:56.860 
newest one but one of the most powerful

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:00.300 
newest one but one of the most powerful
cards<00:05:57.250> on<00:05:57.550> to<00:05:58.479> series<00:05:58.900> and<00:05:59.169> how<00:05:59.919> does<00:05:59.979> this

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:00.310 
cards on to series and how does this

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:02.310 
cards on to series and how does this
help<00:06:00.550> you<00:06:00.760> do<00:06:00.880> your<00:06:01.060> work<00:06:01.090> it<00:06:01.960> helps<00:06:02.229> all

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:02.320 
help you do your work it helps all

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:05.100 
help you do your work it helps all
because<00:06:02.620> we<00:06:02.770> have<00:06:02.800> to<00:06:03.160> do<00:06:03.310> 3d<00:06:03.900> models<00:06:04.900> and

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:05.110 
because we have to do 3d models and

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:07.620 
because we have to do 3d models and
graphics<00:06:05.860> and<00:06:06.040> the<00:06:06.430> CPUs<00:06:06.820> can<00:06:07.090> only<00:06:07.210> do<00:06:07.419> it

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:07.630 
graphics and the CPUs can only do it

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:09.840 
graphics and the CPUs can only do it
therefore<00:06:08.200> the<00:06:08.530> GPU<00:06:08.890> power<00:06:09.100> does<00:06:09.430> come<00:06:09.669> a<00:06:09.700> lot

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:09.850 
therefore the GPU power does come a lot

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:12.300 
therefore the GPU power does come a lot
handy<00:06:10.300> makes<00:06:10.900> the<00:06:11.380> work<00:06:11.560> much<00:06:11.890> much<00:06:12.100> faster

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:12.310 
handy makes the work much much faster

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:14.969 
handy makes the work much much faster
like<00:06:12.669> the<00:06:12.820> rendering<00:06:13.360> the<00:06:13.570> modeling<00:06:14.080> it<00:06:14.290> helps

00:06:14.969 --> 00:06:14.979 
like the rendering the modeling it helps

00:06:14.979 --> 00:06:17.070 
like the rendering the modeling it helps
along<00:06:15.220> does<00:06:15.820> they<00:06:15.940> only<00:06:16.120> help<00:06:16.479> you<00:06:16.630> with<00:06:16.780> 3d

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:17.080 
along does they only help you with 3d
