might<00:00:30.340> wonder<00:00:30.520> why<00:00:30.760> and<00:00:31.150> it<00:00:31.240> turns<00:00:31.420> out<00:00:31.540> that

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:31.599 
might wonder why and it turns out that

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:32.580 
might wonder why and it turns out that
has<00:00:31.840> something<00:00:32.020> to<00:00:32.140> do<00:00:32.290> with<00:00:32.410> something

has something to do with something
called<00:00:32.710> gorilla<00:00:33.160> glass<00:00:33.400> from<00:00:33.910> Corning<00:00:34.300> so

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:34.630 
called gorilla glass from Corning so

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:36.300 
called gorilla glass from Corning so
here<00:00:34.810> with<00:00:34.900> Abby<00:00:35.110> from<00:00:35.530> Corning<00:00:35.890> who's<00:00:36.190> going

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:36.310 
here with Abby from Corning who's going

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:38.100 
here with Abby from Corning who's going
to<00:00:36.400> explain<00:00:36.640> to<00:00:36.790> us<00:00:36.880> what<00:00:37.239> is<00:00:37.480> Gorilla<00:00:37.900> Glass

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:38.110 
to explain to us what is Gorilla Glass

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.970 
to explain to us what is Gorilla Glass
is<00:00:39.210> a<00:00:40.210> chemically<00:00:40.780> strengthened<00:00:41.320> glass<00:00:41.530> ok

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:41.980 
is a chemically strengthened glass ok

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.790 
is a chemically strengthened glass ok
that<00:00:42.310> is<00:00:43.060> strengthened<00:00:44.020> similar<00:00:44.350> to<00:00:44.530> a<00:00:44.560> soda

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:44.800 
that is strengthened similar to a soda

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.470 
that is strengthened similar to a soda
lime<00:00:45.010> glass<00:00:45.040> ok<00:00:45.700> but<00:00:45.880> it<00:00:45.970> strengthens

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:46.480 
lime glass ok but it strengthens

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.990 
lime glass ok but it strengthens
actually<00:00:46.899> more<00:00:47.140> so<00:00:47.470> it's<00:00:47.980> a<00:00:48.100> deeper<00:00:48.430> depth<00:00:48.850> of

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:49.000 
actually more so it's a deeper depth of

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.639 
actually more so it's a deeper depth of
layer<00:00:49.149> we<00:00:49.390> call<00:00:49.570> it<00:00:49.719> our<00:00:49.809> deeper<00:00:50.199> strength

00:00:50.639 --> 00:00:50.649 
layer we call it our deeper strength

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:53.250 
layer we call it our deeper strength
layer<00:00:50.829> that<00:00:51.489> allows<00:00:51.760> more<00:00:52.269> impact<00:00:52.780> without

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260 
layer that allows more impact without

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.410 
layer that allows more impact without
the<00:00:53.649> glass<00:00:53.829> actually<00:00:54.309> that<00:00:54.670> makes<00:00:55.059> it<00:00:55.210> so<00:00:55.390> that

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:55.420 
the glass actually that makes it so that

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:56.880 
the glass actually that makes it so that
we<00:00:55.600> can<00:00:55.750> drop<00:00:55.929> our<00:00:56.079> forward<00:00:56.440> and<00:00:56.530> chances<00:00:56.829> are

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890 
we can drop our forward and chances are

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.080 
we can drop our forward and chances are
the<00:00:57.039> case<00:00:57.219> is<00:00:57.370> going<00:00:57.489> to<00:00:57.550> break<00:00:57.730> before<00:00:57.910> the

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.090 
the case is going to break before the

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:59.849 
the case is going to break before the
poor<00:00:58.600> the<00:00:58.660> glass<00:00:58.840> shatters<00:00:59.260> fact<00:00:59.440> now<00:00:59.800> I

00:00:59.849 --> 00:00:59.859 
poor the glass shatters fact now I

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:01.020 
poor the glass shatters fact now I
understand<00:01:00.250> that<00:01:00.399> we<00:01:00.460> can<00:01:00.579> actually<00:01:00.670> use<00:01:00.850> this

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
understand that we can actually use this

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:02.520 
understand that we can actually use this
is<00:01:01.179> the<00:01:01.300> drought<00:01:01.629> droid<00:01:01.929> we<00:01:02.079> have<00:01:02.199> in<00:01:02.260> our<00:01:02.350> hand

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530 
is the drought droid we have in our hand

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.590 
is the drought droid we have in our hand
it<00:01:03.010> works<00:01:03.219> as<00:01:03.429> a<00:01:03.489> capacitive<00:01:04.120> touchscreen<00:01:04.570> you

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:04.600 
it works as a capacitive touchscreen you

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.150 
it works as a capacitive touchscreen you
can<00:01:04.930> use<00:01:05.050> it<00:01:05.110> in<00:01:05.290> capacitive<00:01:05.770> touchscreen

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:06.160 
can use it in capacitive touchscreen

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:08.190 
can use it in capacitive touchscreen

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.070 
touch screen applications what are some
devices<00:01:11.920> that<00:01:12.160> we<00:01:12.280> might<00:01:12.430> find<00:01:13.240> your<00:01:13.450> product

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:24.190 
with the dell adamo you around some PDAs

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.790 
with the dell adamo you around some PDAs
and<00:01:24.430> mp3<00:01:25.150> players<00:01:25.390> also<00:01:25.660> varied<00:01:26.380> cell<00:01:26.590> phones

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:26.800 
and mp3 players also varied cell phones

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.130 
and mp3 players also varied cell phones
so<00:01:27.430> let's<00:01:27.670> let's<00:01:28.030> let's<00:01:28.150> do<00:01:28.480> this<00:01:28.630> these<00:01:28.990> are

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
so let's let's let's do this these are

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:30.450 
so let's let's let's do this these are
some<00:01:29.170> glasses<00:01:29.470> that<00:01:29.740> I<00:01:29.860> that<00:01:30.100> I<00:01:30.130> shattered

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
some glasses that I that I shattered

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.370 
some glasses that I that I shattered
earlier<00:01:30.910> just<00:01:31.330> to<00:01:31.420> just<00:01:31.870> to<00:01:31.930> see<00:01:32.080> what's<00:01:32.230> going

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
earlier just to just to see what's going

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:33.900 
earlier just to just to see what's going
to<00:01:32.440> happen<00:01:32.710> this<00:01:32.800> is<00:01:32.860> the<00:01:33.100> non<00:01:33.370> strength<00:01:33.700> and

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:33.910 
to happen this is the non strength and

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:35.490 
to happen this is the non strength and
then<00:01:34.000> the<00:01:34.090> strengthened<00:01:34.540> line<00:01:34.810> I<00:01:35.110> guess<00:01:35.320> it's

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
then the strengthened line I guess it's

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.220 
then the strengthened line I guess it's
a<00:01:35.730> line<00:01:36.730> process<00:01:37.150> and<00:01:37.750> then<00:01:37.870> the<00:01:37.900> gorilla

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:38.230 
a line process and then the gorilla

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:40.140 
a line process and then the gorilla
glass<00:01:38.470> so<00:01:38.860> let's<00:01:39.040> give<00:01:39.190> it<00:01:39.220> a<00:01:39.310> go<00:01:39.340> here<00:01:39.670> today<00:01:39.910> I

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:40.150 
glass so let's give it a go here today I

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.140 
glass so let's give it a go here today I
have<00:01:40.960> my<00:01:41.170> trusty<00:01:41.680> breaking<00:01:42.160> implement<00:01:42.610> we

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:43.150 
have my trusty breaking implement we

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:44.610 
have my trusty breaking implement we
will<00:01:43.300> call<00:01:43.450> it<00:01:43.480> the<00:01:43.660> one<00:01:44.140> we<00:01:44.230> call<00:01:44.380> there's<00:01:44.560> a
