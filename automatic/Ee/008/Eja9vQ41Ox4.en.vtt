in brown so this is the trick it's not
hard<00:00:54.809> it's<00:00:55.110> really<00:00:55.320> really<00:00:55.559> nice<00:00:55.710> so<00:00:56.070> all

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
hard it's really really nice so all

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.979 
hard it's really really nice so all
you're<00:00:56.430> doing<00:00:56.730> is<00:00:56.850> you're<00:00:56.879> pulling<00:00:57.300> up<00:00:57.420> the

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
you're doing is you're pulling up the

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.830 
you're doing is you're pulling up the
first<00:00:58.289> section<00:00:58.770> of<00:00:58.890> your<00:00:59.039> hair<00:00:59.100> and<00:00:59.850> you're

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
not putting the comb n like fast I think

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.460 
not putting the comb n like fast I think
that's<00:01:03.329> a<00:01:03.449> lot<00:01:03.570> of<00:01:03.629> people's<00:01:03.960> issue<00:01:04.110> they<00:01:04.320> put

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
that's a lot of people's issue they put

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.899 
that's a lot of people's issue they put
the<00:01:04.559> common<00:01:04.920> like<00:01:05.070> this<00:01:05.250> and<00:01:05.489> it<00:01:05.580> just<00:01:05.729> slides

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
the common like this and it just slides

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.969 
the common like this and it just slides
out<00:01:06.150> you're<00:01:06.780> actually<00:01:06.990> turning<00:01:07.470> the<00:01:07.770> poem

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
out you're actually turning the poem

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.149 
out you're actually turning the poem
backwards<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:09.320> you're<00:01:10.320> pushing<00:01:10.740> it<00:01:10.830> in<00:01:10.979> like

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
backwards and you're pushing it in like

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.740 
backwards and you're pushing it in like
that<00:01:11.189> so<00:01:11.580> there's<00:01:11.729> no<00:01:12.000> chance<00:01:12.030> of<00:01:12.570> it<00:01:12.720> coming

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
that so there's no chance of it coming

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.580 
that so there's no chance of it coming
out<00:01:13.170> she<00:01:13.890> pushed<00:01:14.100> that<00:01:14.250> in<00:01:14.430> securely<00:01:15.530> and<00:01:16.530> then

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
out she pushed that in securely and then

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.249 
out she pushed that in securely and then
you're<00:01:16.860> just<00:01:16.890> shaping<00:01:17.450> your<00:01:18.450> hair<00:01:18.689> after<00:01:18.900> that
