technique so I'm gonna be using my

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.380 
technique so I'm gonna be using my

a pear pizzaz ink pad I have early

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:12.160 
a pear pizzaz ink pad I have early
espresso<00:03:09.349> marker<00:03:10.280> an<00:03:10.640> Old<00:03:11.000> Olive<00:03:11.239> marker<00:03:11.959> and

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:17.060 
a always artichoke marker now it's

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.180 
a always artichoke marker now it's
really<00:03:17.329> important<00:03:17.989> that<00:03:18.530> when<00:03:18.829> you're<00:03:18.980> doing

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
really important that when you're doing

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:21.460 
really important that when you're doing
this<00:03:19.370> technique<00:03:19.910> that<00:03:19.940> you<00:03:20.239> always<00:03:20.510> go<00:03:20.959> light

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
this technique that you always go light

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.890 
this technique that you always go light
to<00:03:21.859> dark<00:03:22.130> so<00:03:22.970> we're<00:03:23.060> going<00:03:23.150> to<00:03:23.209> start<00:03:23.569> off

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
to dark so we're going to start off

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:30.849 
to dark so we're going to start off
inking<00:03:24.680> up<00:03:24.859> the<00:03:25.329> stamp<00:03:26.329> in<00:03:27.459> purposes<00:03:29.620> and<00:03:30.620> then

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:30.859 
inking up the stamp in purposes and then

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:34.319 
inking up the stamp in purposes and then
what<00:03:31.010> I'm<00:03:31.130> going<00:03:31.310> to<00:03:31.370> do<00:03:31.670> is<00:03:32.030> I'm<00:03:32.269> going<00:03:32.299> to<00:03:32.889> use

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:34.329 
what I'm going to do is I'm going to use

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:37.900 
what I'm going to do is I'm going to use
my<00:03:35.329> early<00:03:35.690> espresso<00:03:35.900> marker<00:03:36.709> going<00:03:37.489> straight

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:37.910 
my early espresso marker going straight

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.410 
my early espresso marker going straight
over<00:03:37.940> the<00:03:38.420> top<00:03:38.660> of<00:03:38.690> the<00:03:38.959> ink<00:03:39.280> with<00:03:40.420> early

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:41.420 
over the top of the ink with early

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:44.830 
over the top of the ink with early
espresso<00:03:41.480> on<00:03:42.139> the<00:03:42.799> trunk<00:03:43.340> and<00:03:43.670> then<00:03:44.329> I'm<00:03:44.480> just

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
espresso on the trunk and then I'm just

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:51.009 
espresso on the trunk and then I'm just
picking<00:03:45.470> out<00:03:45.859> a<00:03:45.889> few<00:03:46.549> of<00:03:47.440> the<00:03:48.670> branches<00:03:50.019> with

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:51.019 
picking out a few of the branches with

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:54.129 
picking out a few of the branches with
the<00:03:51.200> early<00:03:51.680> espresso<00:03:52.810> don't<00:03:53.810> worry<00:03:54.019> about

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:54.139 
the early espresso don't worry about

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:56.229 
the early espresso don't worry about
getting<00:03:54.380> all<00:03:54.739> of<00:03:54.950> them<00:03:55.100> it's<00:03:55.400> it's<00:03:55.790> just<00:03:56.120> to

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:56.239 
getting all of them it's it's just to

00:03:56.239 --> 00:03:59.460 
getting all of them it's it's just to
give<00:03:56.389> it<00:03:56.510> a<00:03:56.600> little<00:03:56.810> bit<00:03:57.019> more<00:03:57.230> of<00:03:57.670> interest

00:03:59.460 --> 00:03:59.470 
give it a little bit more of interest

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:03.789 
give it a little bit more of interest
with<00:04:00.470> the<00:04:00.920> stamp<00:04:01.730> and<00:04:02.540> then<00:04:02.900> we're<00:04:03.470> going<00:04:03.680> to

00:04:03.789 --> 00:04:03.799 
with the stamp and then we're going to

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:08.650 
with the stamp and then we're going to
get<00:04:03.889> onto<00:04:04.069> the<00:04:04.370> thumping<00:04:05.150> of<00:04:05.359> it<00:04:06.220> so<00:04:07.569> when<00:04:08.569> you

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
get onto the thumping of it so when you

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:11.589 
get onto the thumping of it so when you
use<00:04:08.780> the<00:04:08.930> Old<00:04:09.200> Olive<00:04:09.560> marker<00:04:10.549> this<00:04:11.269> has<00:04:11.420> got

00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:11.599 
use the Old Olive marker this has got

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:14.949 
use the Old Olive marker this has got
the<00:04:11.780> white<00:04:12.230> tip<00:04:12.769> so<00:04:13.579> the<00:04:13.730> white<00:04:13.970> line<00:04:14.209> is<00:04:14.569> the

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 
the white tip so the white line is the

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:20.319 
the white tip so the white line is the
the<00:04:15.350> wide<00:04:15.590> tip<00:04:16.070> and<00:04:17.979> what<00:04:18.979> I'm<00:04:19.100> going<00:04:19.310> to<00:04:19.370> do<00:04:19.669> is

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:20.329 
the wide tip and what I'm going to do is

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:23.080 
the wide tip and what I'm going to do is
hold<00:04:20.509> it<00:04:20.870> sort<00:04:21.289> of<00:04:21.319> loosely<00:04:21.919> in<00:04:22.220> in<00:04:22.699> your<00:04:22.819> hand

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
hold it sort of loosely in in your hand

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:31.510 
hold it sort of loosely in in your hand
and<00:04:23.800> bounce<00:04:24.800> it<00:04:25.280> all<00:04:26.680> over<00:04:27.680> the<00:04:28.639> the<00:04:29.330> tree<00:04:30.520> now

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 
and bounce it all over the the tree now

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.429 
and bounce it all over the the tree now
what<00:04:31.729> this<00:04:31.879> is<00:04:31.939> doing<00:04:32.300> is<00:04:32.479> each<00:04:32.659> time<00:04:32.689> it

00:04:33.429 --> 00:04:33.439 
what this is doing is each time it

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:37.300 
what this is doing is each time it
thumps<00:04:34.159> or<00:04:34.370> hits<00:04:34.639> the<00:04:35.050> stamp<00:04:36.050> it's<00:04:36.770> actually

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
thumps or hits the stamp it's actually

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.809 
thumps or hits the stamp it's actually
going<00:04:37.520> to<00:04:37.669> leave<00:04:37.879> a<00:04:37.909> tiny<00:04:38.210> bit<00:04:38.449> of<00:04:38.539> ink<00:04:38.810> behind

00:04:39.809 --> 00:04:39.819 
going to leave a tiny bit of ink behind

00:04:39.819 --> 00:04:42.999 
going to leave a tiny bit of ink behind
so<00:04:40.819> that's<00:04:41.090> the<00:04:41.300> old<00:04:41.539> olive<00:04:41.719> one<00:04:42.080> now<00:04:42.860> we're

00:04:42.999 --> 00:04:43.009 
so that's the old olive one now we're

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:43.959 
so that's the old olive one now we're
going<00:04:43.159> to<00:04:43.219> do<00:04:43.370> it<00:04:43.430> again

00:04:43.959 --> 00:04:43.969 
going to do it again

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:51.070 
going to do it again
always<00:04:44.560> always<00:04:45.610> artichoke<00:04:46.610> you<00:04:49.840> see<00:04:50.840> I<00:04:50.870> told

always always artichoke you see I told
you<00:04:51.259> it<00:04:51.349> wasn't<00:04:51.620> dangerous<00:04:52.210> now<00:04:53.650> you<00:04:54.650> need<00:04:54.800> to

00:04:54.939 --> 00:04:54.949 
you it wasn't dangerous now you need to

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:57.040 
you it wasn't dangerous now you need to
give<00:04:55.099> this<00:04:55.250> a<00:04:55.430> magic<00:04:55.759> huff<00:04:56.030> now<00:04:56.569> if<00:04:56.900> you've

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.050 
give this a magic huff now if you've

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.020 
give this a magic huff now if you've
never<00:04:57.080> come<00:04:57.440> across<00:04:57.560> the<00:04:57.979> magic<00:04:58.280> Huff<00:04:58.460> before

00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.030 
never come across the magic Huff before

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:03.279 
never come across the magic Huff before
you've<00:04:59.900> made<00:05:00.169> two<00:05:01.030> below<00:05:02.030> breathe<00:05:02.870> out<00:05:03.080> all

00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:03.289 
you've made two below breathe out all

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:05.860 
you've made two below breathe out all
over<00:05:03.409> the<00:05:03.979> stamp<00:05:04.250> and<00:05:04.729> what<00:05:05.000> that<00:05:05.150> does<00:05:05.389> is<00:05:05.750> it

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:05.870 
over the stamp and what that does is it

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:07.719 
over the stamp and what that does is it
actually<00:05:05.990> remoisten<00:05:06.770> to<00:05:07.099> the<00:05:07.219> ink<00:05:07.400> because

00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:07.729 
actually remoisten to the ink because

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:11.999 
actually remoisten to the ink because
it's<00:05:07.909> it's<00:05:08.210> begun<00:05:08.539> to<00:05:08.690> dry<00:05:08.900> so<00:05:09.800> you<00:05:09.860> do<00:05:10.069> this

00:05:11.999 --> 00:05:12.009 
it's it's begun to dry so you do this

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:18.820 
it's it's begun to dry so you do this
and<00:05:13.009> then<00:05:13.400> you<00:05:13.699> stamp<00:05:14.419> the<00:05:14.690> image<00:05:17.169> and<00:05:18.169> they

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:18.830 
and then you stamp the image and they

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:21.189 
and then you stamp the image and they
have<00:05:19.189> love<00:05:19.699> love<00:05:19.729> love<00:05:20.419> this<00:05:20.569> technique<00:05:20.930> so

00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:21.199 
have love love love this technique so

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:23.769 
have love love love this technique so
you've<00:05:21.349> got<00:05:21.500> lots<00:05:21.770> of<00:05:21.979> different<00:05:22.460> shades<00:05:23.270> of

00:05:23.769 --> 00:05:23.779 
you've got lots of different shades of

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:27.100 
you've got lots of different shades of
green<00:05:24.409> in<00:05:24.800> there<00:05:25.310> now<00:05:26.180> you<00:05:26.240> can<00:05:26.539> use<00:05:26.779> the<00:05:26.990> magic

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.110 
green in there now you can use the magic

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:31.809 
green in there now you can use the magic
cuff<00:05:27.379> again<00:05:29.169> so<00:05:30.169> that<00:05:30.409> will<00:05:30.560> give<00:05:30.860> a<00:05:31.190> really
