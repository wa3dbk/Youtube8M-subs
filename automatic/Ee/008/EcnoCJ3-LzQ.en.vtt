00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
head and I think also to the chest

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.630 
head and I think also to the chest
within<00:01:09.330> a<00:01:09.420> certain<00:01:09.630> range<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:10.290> of<00:01:11.100> course<00:01:11.130> the

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
within a certain range and of course the

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.490 
within a certain range and of course the
real<00:01:11.970> time<00:01:12.360> so<00:01:12.960> I<00:01:13.580> quadri<00:01:14.580> chambering<00:01:15.000> hem

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500 
real time so I quadri chambering hem

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.560 
real time so I quadri chambering hem
will<00:01:16.500> be<00:01:16.650> quite<00:01:16.860> high<00:01:17.040> as<00:01:17.189> well<00:01:17.369> as<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.729> bolt

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
will be quite high as well as the bolt

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.910 
will be quite high as well as the bolt
drop<00:01:19.080> so<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:20.549> you<00:01:21.330> will<00:01:21.479> have<00:01:21.600> like<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:22.170> like<00:01:22.890> a

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
drop so and you will have like a like a

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.580 
drop so and you will have like a like a
short<00:01:23.369> range<00:01:23.670> sniper<00:01:24.030> rifle<00:01:24.600> I<00:01:24.840> guess<00:01:25.290> in

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
short range sniper rifle I guess in

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.490 
short range sniper rifle I guess in
terms<00:01:25.979> of<00:01:26.340> damage<00:01:27.000> you<00:01:27.030> could<00:01:27.330> say<00:01:27.509> so<00:01:28.259> and

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
terms of damage you could say so and

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.080 
terms of damage you could say so and
that's<00:01:28.860> at<00:01:28.979> least<00:01:29.009> what<00:01:29.280> it<00:01:29.369> looks<00:01:29.579> like<00:01:29.759> and

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
that's at least what it looks like and

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.819 
that's at least what it looks like and
then<00:01:30.810> there<00:01:30.960> will<00:01:31.049> be<00:01:31.290> three<00:01:31.650> other

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
then there will be three other

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.039 
then there will be three other
assignments<00:01:32.490> or<00:01:32.640> to<00:01:32.820> unlock<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.210> high<00:01:33.479> for<00:01:33.840> a

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
assignments or to unlock the high for a

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.830 
assignments or to unlock the high for a
high<00:01:34.350> explosive<00:01:34.409> bolt<00:01:35.130> which<00:01:35.640> is<00:01:35.720> just<00:01:36.720> in

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
has to landed in repairs and stuff and

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:12.470 
has to landed in repairs and stuff and
thus<00:02:09.509> can<00:02:09.720> bolt<00:02:09.959> has<00:02:10.229> a<00:02:10.440> range<00:02:11.129> of<00:02:11.520> 10<00:02:12.060> meter

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
thus can bolt has a range of 10 meter

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.920 
thus can bolt has a range of 10 meter
10<00:02:13.379> meters<00:02:13.680> so<00:02:14.190> that's<00:02:14.550> the<00:02:14.700> radius<00:02:15.090> in<00:02:15.330> which

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
10 meters so that's the radius in which

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.839 
10 meters so that's the radius in which
so<00:02:16.440> it's<00:02:16.709> basically<00:02:16.890> like<00:02:17.220> the<00:02:17.280> motion<00:02:17.640> bolts

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
so it's basically like the motion bolts

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:20.180 
so it's basically like the motion bolts
from<00:02:17.909> bad<00:02:18.120> company<00:02:18.480> 2<00:02:18.629> and<00:02:18.900> it's<00:02:19.860> pretty<00:02:20.069> much

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
from bad company 2 and it's pretty much

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.910 
from bad company 2 and it's pretty much
the<00:02:20.340> same<00:02:20.720> which<00:02:21.720> is<00:02:21.750> really<00:02:22.409> nice<00:02:22.530> because<00:02:22.739> I

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
the same which is really nice because I

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.710 
the same which is really nice because I
really<00:02:23.250> miss<00:02:23.400> those<00:02:23.549> nice<00:02:24.209> little<00:02:24.390> motion

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
really miss those nice little motion

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.039 
really miss those nice little motion
balls<00:02:24.900> and<00:02:25.519> then<00:02:26.519> we<00:02:26.670> have<00:02:26.819> the<00:02:27.090> long-range

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:28.049 
balls and then we have the long-range

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:31.309 
balls and then we have the long-range
bolt<00:02:28.980> and<00:02:29.280> they<00:02:29.849> haven't<00:02:30.120> really<00:02:30.239> like<00:02:30.930> said

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
bolt and they haven't really like said

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:32.839 
bolt and they haven't really like said
too<00:02:31.530> much<00:02:31.680> about<00:02:31.950> it<00:02:32.010> there<00:02:32.340> will<00:02:32.489> be<00:02:32.519> more

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
too much about it there will be more

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:36.190 
too much about it there will be more
like<00:02:33.360> information<00:02:34.110> released<00:02:34.620> somewhere

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
like information released somewhere

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.050 
like information released somewhere
before<00:02:37.200> the<00:02:37.620> aftermath<00:02:38.099> ELC<00:02:38.519> comes<00:02:38.700> out<00:02:38.879> but

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
before the aftermath ELC comes out but

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.789 
before the aftermath ELC comes out but
it's<00:02:39.780> basically<00:02:39.989> having<00:02:40.769> less<00:02:41.700> bolt<00:02:42.269> drop<00:02:42.569> and

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:42.799 
it's basically having less bolt drop and

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:46.580 
it's basically having less bolt drop and
higher<00:02:43.799> damage<00:02:44.159> I<00:02:44.430> guess<00:02:44.640> so<00:02:45.269> it<00:02:45.690> will<00:02:46.140> perform

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
higher damage I guess so it will perform

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.259 
higher damage I guess so it will perform
like<00:02:47.040> a<00:02:47.280> little<00:02:47.489> bit<00:02:47.610> like<00:02:47.790> a<00:02:47.819> sniper<00:02:48.150> rifle

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
like a little bit like a sniper rifle

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:52.550 
like a little bit like a sniper rifle
probably<00:02:48.959> and<00:02:50.299> like<00:02:51.299> I<00:02:51.390> said<00:02:51.450> those<00:02:51.810> are<00:02:52.019> and

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
probably and like I said those are and

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.030 
probably and like I said those are and
those<00:02:53.400> bolts<00:02:53.940> are<00:02:54.120> all<00:02:54.599> available<00:02:54.959> to<00:02:55.620> every

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
those bolts are all available to every

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.819 
those bolts are all available to every
class<00:02:56.190> together<00:02:56.879> with<00:02:57.209> a<00:02:57.239> crossbow<00:02:57.690> and<00:02:57.900> you

00:02:58.819 --> 00:02:58.829 
class together with a crossbow and you

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:01.160 
class together with a crossbow and you
will<00:02:58.980> be<00:02:59.129> able<00:02:59.280> to<00:02:59.609> change<00:03:00.060> them<00:03:00.450> on<00:03:00.660> the<00:03:00.930> fly

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
will be able to change them on the fly

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.099 
will be able to change them on the fly
so<00:03:01.549> I<00:03:02.549> don't<00:03:02.819> think<00:03:02.970> you<00:03:03.090> have<00:03:03.209> to<00:03:03.239> go<00:03:03.629> to<00:03:03.690> your

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:04.109 
so I don't think you have to go to your

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:07.430 
so I don't think you have to go to your
soldier<00:03:04.530> menu<00:03:04.829> and<00:03:05.040> and<00:03:05.959> change<00:03:06.959> it<00:03:07.079> there<00:03:07.230> so

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
soldier menu and and change it there so

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.349 
soldier menu and and change it there so
I<00:03:07.470> think<00:03:07.680> can<00:03:08.040> change<00:03:08.280> it<00:03:08.400> just<00:03:08.609> in<00:03:08.849> game<00:03:09.030> while

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:09.359 
I think can change it just in game while

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:10.839 
I think can change it just in game while
running<00:03:09.569> around<00:03:09.959> use<00:03:10.200> a<00:03:10.230> different<00:03:10.590> bolt

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:10.849 
running around use a different bolt

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:14.000 
running around use a different bolt
which<00:03:11.849> makes<00:03:12.569> it<00:03:12.690> pretty<00:03:12.900> powerful<00:03:13.290> and<00:03:13.769> adds

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
which makes it pretty powerful and adds

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.650 
which makes it pretty powerful and adds
lots<00:03:14.220> of<00:03:14.519> a<00:03:15.180> variety<00:03:15.959> to<00:03:16.680> it<00:03:16.709> and<00:03:17.660> that's

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
lots of a variety to it and that's

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.750 
lots of a variety to it and that's
something<00:03:18.959> I<00:03:19.290> am<00:03:19.530> really<00:03:19.769> concerned<00:03:20.160> about<00:03:20.340> is

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
something I am really concerned about is

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:26.839 
something I am really concerned about is
I<00:03:22.099> really<00:03:23.099> don't<00:03:23.790> want<00:03:24.380> to<00:03:25.380> have<00:03:25.410> a<00:03:26.069> don't<00:03:26.639> want

00:03:26.839 --> 00:03:26.849 
I really don't want to have a don't want

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:30.830 
I really don't want to have a don't want
have<00:03:27.120> us<00:03:27.450> all<00:03:27.660> players<00:03:29.060> then<00:03:30.060> yeah<00:03:30.450> to<00:03:30.690> have

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
have us all players then yeah to have

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.659 
have us all players then yeah to have
them<00:03:31.049> the<00:03:31.380> strongest<00:03:31.889> rifles<00:03:32.310> in<00:03:32.430> the<00:03:32.519> game

00:03:32.659 --> 00:03:32.669 
them the strongest rifles in the game

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:35.420 
them the strongest rifles in the game
the<00:03:32.970> ability<00:03:33.419> to<00:03:33.690> get<00:03:33.870> like<00:03:34.169> so<00:03:34.859> much<00:03:35.010> extra

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
the ability to get like so much extra

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.300 
the ability to get like so much extra
points<00:03:36.000> through<00:03:36.389> reviving<00:03:37.049> having<00:03:38.010> a<00:03:38.099> med<00:03:38.280> kit

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
points through reviving having a med kit

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.099 
points through reviving having a med kit
in<00:03:38.760> order<00:03:38.940> to<00:03:39.000> heal<00:03:39.150> themselves<00:03:39.660> or<00:03:39.840> a<00:03:39.870> new

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:40.109 
in order to heal themselves or a new

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:42.440 
in order to heal themselves or a new
tube<00:03:40.349> if<00:03:40.470> they<00:03:40.650> want<00:03:41.010> to<00:03:41.099> have<00:03:41.220> one<00:03:41.430> and<00:03:41.700> then

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
tube if they want to have one and then

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:47.300 
tube if they want to have one and then
for<00:03:42.690> example<00:03:43.230> like<00:03:44.130> another<00:03:44.609> c4<00:03:45.209> bold<00:03:45.480> or<00:03:46.310> like

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
for example like another c4 bold or like

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.970 
for example like another c4 bold or like
a<00:03:47.340> scan<00:03:47.819> bolt<00:03:48.030> so<00:03:48.239> just<00:03:48.900> imagine<00:03:49.019> the<00:03:49.620> the

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
a scan bolt so just imagine the the

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.599 
a scan bolt so just imagine the the
assault<00:03:50.310> kit<00:03:50.609> with<00:03:50.910> discs<00:03:51.870> and<00:03:52.049> bolts<00:03:52.410> so<00:03:53.069> this

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:53.609 
assault kit with discs and bolts so this

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:56.690 
assault kit with discs and bolts so this
sounds<00:03:54.060> just<00:03:54.329> like<00:03:54.989> in<00:03:55.200> my<00:03:55.230> years<00:03:55.889> and<00:03:56.280> Brie

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
sounds just like in my years and Brie

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.409 
sounds just like in my years and Brie
overpowered<00:03:57.239> and<00:03:58.669> the<00:03:59.669> the<00:04:00.030> thing<00:04:00.239> which

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:00.419 
overpowered and the the thing which

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:03.170 
overpowered and the the thing which
makes<00:04:00.450> me<00:04:00.900> think<00:04:01.109> that<00:04:01.829> as<00:04:02.190> if<00:04:02.849> you<00:04:02.970> go<00:04:03.120> to

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
makes me think that as if you go to

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.729 
makes me think that as if you go to
Battlelog<00:04:03.540> and<00:04:03.780> check<00:04:03.930> it<00:04:04.019> for<00:04:04.169> yourself<00:04:04.260> do

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
Battlelog and check it for yourself do

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:07.190 
Battlelog and check it for yourself do
you<00:04:04.799> little<00:04:04.980> article<00:04:05.280> it's<00:04:06.269> somewhere<00:04:06.629> says

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
you little article it's somewhere says

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.119 
you little article it's somewhere says
that<00:04:08.329> and<00:04:09.329> it<00:04:09.870> used<00:04:10.139> the<00:04:10.379> assault<00:04:10.650> kit<00:04:10.949> or

00:04:11.119 --> 00:04:11.129 
that and it used the assault kit or

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:14.900 
that and it used the assault kit or
soldiers<00:04:12.030> I<00:04:12.329> think<00:04:13.040> it<00:04:14.040> was<00:04:14.250> the<00:04:14.459> the<00:04:14.730> name

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
soldiers I think it was the the name

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.409 
soldiers I think it was the the name
they<00:04:15.180> were<00:04:15.239> giving<00:04:15.840> the<00:04:15.959> assault<00:04:16.260> players<00:04:16.500> and

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:17.419 
they were giving the assault players and

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:20.569 
they were giving the assault players and
it<00:04:18.419> was<00:04:18.599> is<00:04:18.780> it<00:04:19.139> named<00:04:19.530> them<00:04:19.769> as<00:04:20.070> like<00:04:20.430> an

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:20.579 
it was is it named them as like an

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:23.899 
it was is it named them as like an
example<00:04:21.120> and<00:04:21.860> did<00:04:22.860> something<00:04:23.099> which<00:04:23.460> really

00:04:23.899 --> 00:04:23.909 
example and did something which really

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:26.330 
example and did something which really
concerns<00:04:24.390> me<00:04:24.590> which

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
concerns me which

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:27.770 
concerns me which
and<00:04:26.400> on<00:04:26.550> the<00:04:26.669> other<00:04:26.790> hand<00:04:27.030> again<00:04:27.360> makes<00:04:27.570> me

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:27.780 
and on the other hand again makes me

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.189 
and on the other hand again makes me
think<00:04:28.020> that<00:04:28.850> you<00:04:29.850> might<00:04:30.090> only<00:04:30.480> be<00:04:30.630> able<00:04:30.930> to

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:31.199 
think that you might only be able to

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:34.850 
think that you might only be able to
have<00:04:31.380> the<00:04:31.940> class<00:04:32.940> specific<00:04:33.449> thing<00:04:33.720> to<00:04:34.650> your

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
have the class specific thing to your

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:39.230 
have the class specific thing to your
like<00:04:36.229> class<00:04:37.229> so<00:04:37.889> that<00:04:38.220> the<00:04:38.460> rican<00:04:38.760> for<00:04:38.880> example

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
like class so that the rican for example

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.939 
like class so that the rican for example
only<00:04:39.419> can<00:04:39.720> use<00:04:39.870> the<00:04:39.960> normal<00:04:40.110> and<00:04:40.530> thus<00:04:40.710> can

00:04:40.939 --> 00:04:40.949 
only can use the normal and thus can

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:43.670 
only can use the normal and thus can
bolt<00:04:41.220> but<00:04:42.030> I<00:04:42.060> don't<00:04:42.720> think<00:04:42.990> that<00:04:43.199> is<00:04:43.350> the<00:04:43.380> case

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
bolt but I don't think that is the case

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:47.570 
bolt but I don't think that is the case
it<00:04:44.550> really<00:04:44.729> sounds<00:04:45.210> differently<00:04:45.600> and<00:04:45.900> and<00:04:46.650> so

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
it really sounds differently and and so

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:50.570 
it really sounds differently and and so
i<00:04:47.720> think<00:04:48.720> i'm<00:04:48.930> pretty<00:04:49.110> sure<00:04:49.199> and<00:04:49.620> i<00:04:49.949> think<00:04:50.400> that

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
i think i'm pretty sure and i think that

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.610 
i think i'm pretty sure and i think that
i<00:04:50.610> can<00:04:50.970> assume<00:04:51.330> that<00:04:51.389> really<00:04:52.080> everyone<00:04:52.440> will

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
i can assume that really everyone will

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.320 
i can assume that really everyone will
be<00:04:52.800> able<00:04:52.830> to<00:04:53.040> use<00:04:53.190> every<00:04:53.520> bolt<00:04:53.760> as<00:04:54.000> soon<00:04:54.180> as

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 
be able to use every bolt as soon as

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:56.200 
be able to use every bolt as soon as
they<00:04:54.479> have<00:04:54.780> finished<00:04:55.050> the<00:04:55.260> assignment<00:04:55.320> for<00:04:55.830> it

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.210 
they have finished the assignment for it

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:59.120 
they have finished the assignment for it
yeah<00:04:57.210> like<00:04:57.479> i<00:04:57.510> said<00:04:57.810> and<00:04:58.080> first<00:04:58.860> i<00:04:58.950> was<00:04:59.100> really

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 
yeah like i said and first i was really

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:01.969 
yeah like i said and first i was really
happy<00:04:59.430> because<00:04:59.610> i<00:04:59.850> felt<00:05:00.150> like<00:05:00.330> and<00:05:00.540> like<00:05:01.410> yeah

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:01.979 
happy because i felt like and like yeah

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:05.480 
happy because i felt like and like yeah
finally<00:05:02.460> some<00:05:02.700> explosives<00:05:03.330> maybe<00:05:04.139> if<00:05:04.680> i<00:05:04.830> show

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490 
finally some explosives maybe if i show

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.490 
finally some explosives maybe if i show
that<00:05:05.520> tank<00:05:06.150> eight<00:05:06.419> times<00:05:06.660> or<00:05:06.930> so<00:05:06.960> it'll<00:05:07.320> blow

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:07.500 
that tank eight times or so it'll blow

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:11.620 
that tank eight times or so it'll blow
up<00:05:07.650> and<00:05:08.930> taking<00:05:09.930> out<00:05:10.050> four<00:05:10.770> helicopters

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.630 
up and taking out four helicopters

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:13.820 
up and taking out four helicopters
slapping<00:05:12.630> the<00:05:12.810> heli<00:05:12.930> pilot<00:05:13.320> is<00:05:13.560> probably

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:13.830 
slapping the heli pilot is probably

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:17.330 
slapping the heli pilot is probably
better<00:05:14.010> but<00:05:14.310> and<00:05:14.940> for<00:05:15.720> a<00:05:15.750> like<00:05:16.290> the<00:05:16.440> jeep<00:05:16.680> right

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:17.340 
better but and for a like the jeep right

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:19.879 
better but and for a like the jeep right
here<00:05:17.580> on<00:05:17.789> Rush<00:05:18.030> and<00:05:18.389> then<00:05:18.900> when<00:05:19.110> peak<00:05:19.380> they<00:05:19.620> can

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:19.889 
here on Rush and then when peak they can

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:21.409 
here on Rush and then when peak they can
be<00:05:20.010> pretty<00:05:20.190> annoying<00:05:20.490> if<00:05:20.729> they're<00:05:20.910> like

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:21.419 
be pretty annoying if they're like

00:05:21.419 --> 00:05:23.360 
be pretty annoying if they're like
nearly<00:05:21.660> objectives<00:05:22.200> to<00:05:22.740> in<00:05:22.919> order<00:05:23.070> to<00:05:23.160> blew

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
nearly objectives to in order to blew

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:24.980 
nearly objectives to in order to blew
them<00:05:23.610> up<00:05:23.639> because<00:05:23.910> you<00:05:24.270> won't<00:05:24.449> get<00:05:24.630> far<00:05:24.780> with

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:24.990 
them up because you won't get far with

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:27.020 
them up because you won't get far with
grenades<00:05:25.410> there's<00:05:26.130> really<00:05:26.370> happy<00:05:26.729> at<00:05:26.820> first

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:27.030 
grenades there's really happy at first

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:30.409 
grenades there's really happy at first
especially<00:05:27.810> and<00:05:28.580> because<00:05:29.580> of<00:05:29.610> scandals<00:05:30.180> too

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:30.419 
especially and because of scandals too

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:31.670 
especially and because of scandals too
because<00:05:30.690> I<00:05:30.720> really<00:05:30.990> missed<00:05:31.200> motion<00:05:31.530> bolts

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:31.680 
because I really missed motion bolts

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.909 
because I really missed motion bolts
from<00:05:31.740> bad<00:05:31.950> company<00:05:32.250> 2<00:05:32.400> but<00:05:33.270> and<00:05:33.919> after

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:34.919 
from bad company 2 but and after

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:36.760 
from bad company 2 but and after
thinking<00:05:35.190> a<00:05:35.430> little<00:05:35.550> bit<00:05:35.669> more<00:05:36.000> about<00:05:36.060> it<00:05:36.450> and

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:36.770 
thinking a little bit more about it and

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:40.450 
thinking a little bit more about it and
the<00:05:37.770> rican<00:05:38.010> class<00:05:38.340> is<00:05:38.580> split<00:05:38.880> it's<00:05:39.360> pretty<00:05:39.570> I

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:40.460 
the rican class is split it's pretty I

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.589 
the rican class is split it's pretty I
don't<00:05:41.460> want<00:05:41.580> to<00:05:41.639> say<00:05:41.700> underpowered<00:05:42.090> compared

00:05:42.589 --> 00:05:42.599 
don't want to say underpowered compared

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:43.760 
don't want to say underpowered compared
to<00:05:42.720> the<00:05:42.810> other<00:05:42.960> classes<00:05:43.349> but<00:05:43.500> it's<00:05:43.620> definitely

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:43.770 
to the other classes but it's definitely

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:49.060 
to the other classes but it's definitely
weaker<00:05:44.370> and<00:05:45.979> add<00:05:46.979> the<00:05:47.789> tax<00:05:48.030> in<00:05:48.270> the<00:05:48.360> nav<00:05:48.780> der

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:49.070 
weaker and add the tax in the nav der

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:51.950 
weaker and add the tax in the nav der
well<00:05:50.070> you're<00:05:50.460> not<00:05:50.610> the<00:05:50.669> best<00:05:51.000> gadgets<00:05:51.660> I<00:05:51.750> mean

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:51.960 
well you're not the best gadgets I mean

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.159 
well you're not the best gadgets I mean
it's<00:05:52.110> nice<00:05:52.320> to<00:05:52.560> see<00:05:53.070> the<00:05:53.190> enemies<00:05:53.520> around<00:05:53.789> but

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:54.169 
it's nice to see the enemies around but

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:56.300 
it's nice to see the enemies around but
the<00:05:55.169> demotion<00:05:55.440> bolts<00:05:55.770> were<00:05:55.860> so<00:05:56.099> much<00:05:56.250> more

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:56.310 
the demotion bolts were so much more

00:05:56.310 --> 00:05:58.760 
the demotion bolts were so much more
like<00:05:56.880> useful<00:05:57.330> because<00:05:57.450> you<00:05:57.750> could<00:05:57.900> like<00:05:58.440> throw

00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:58.770 
like useful because you could like throw

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:00.560 
like useful because you could like throw
them<00:05:58.950> into<00:05:59.099> a<00:05:59.190> building<00:05:59.610> and<00:05:59.760> other<00:05:59.970> people<00:06:00.479> in

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:00.570 
them into a building and other people in

00:06:00.570 --> 00:06:03.860 
them into a building and other people in
there<00:06:00.750> and<00:06:00.930> with<00:06:01.860> the<00:06:01.940> texts<00:06:02.940> and<00:06:03.120> nav<00:06:03.539> there<00:06:03.840> a

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:03.870 
there and with the texts and nav there a

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:05.270 
there and with the texts and nav there a
little<00:06:03.990> bit<00:06:04.110> more<00:06:04.260> Campeador<00:06:04.650> just<00:06:04.979> around

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:05.280 
little bit more Campeador just around

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.640 
little bit more Campeador just around
you<00:06:05.550> so<00:06:05.760> you<00:06:05.789> know<00:06:06.090> what's<00:06:06.300> going<00:06:06.539> on<00:06:06.599> there<00:06:06.870> so

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:07.650 
you so you know what's going on there so

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:09.200 
you so you know what's going on there so
this<00:06:07.860> really<00:06:08.099> concerned<00:06:08.610> in<00:06:08.760> a<00:06:08.820> little<00:06:09.060> bit

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:09.210 
this really concerned in a little bit

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:12.170 
this really concerned in a little bit
because<00:06:09.419> that's<00:06:10.070> actually<00:06:11.070> an<00:06:11.430> ability<00:06:11.910> I

00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:12.180 
because that's actually an ability I

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:14.300 
because that's actually an ability I
don't<00:06:12.479> want<00:06:12.630> to<00:06:12.690> see<00:06:12.840> our<00:06:13.039> like<00:06:14.039> for<00:06:14.250> example

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:14.310 
don't want to see our like for example

00:06:14.310 --> 00:06:17.870 
don't want to see our like for example
this<00:06:14.580> old<00:06:14.789> kid<00:06:15.000> using<00:06:15.620> because<00:06:16.620> I<00:06:16.919> really

00:06:17.870 --> 00:06:17.880 
this old kid using because I really

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:20.210 
this old kid using because I really
don't<00:06:18.000> know<00:06:18.030> how<00:06:18.210> this<00:06:18.750> will<00:06:18.930> play<00:06:19.080> out<00:06:19.139> and<00:06:19.650> I

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:20.220 
don't know how this will play out and I

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:22.279 
don't know how this will play out and I
really<00:06:20.610> hope<00:06:20.729> dies<00:06:20.970> can<00:06:21.300> manage<00:06:21.960> to<00:06:22.139> balance

00:06:22.279 --> 00:06:22.289 
really hope dies can manage to balance

00:06:22.289 --> 00:06:24.920 
really hope dies can manage to balance
all<00:06:22.620> of<00:06:22.680> this<00:06:22.979> because<00:06:23.460> right<00:06:24.389> now<00:06:24.419> it<00:06:24.720> sounds

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:24.930 
all of this because right now it sounds

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:28.400 
all of this because right now it sounds
just<00:06:25.169> a<00:06:25.500> little<00:06:25.740> bit<00:06:26.120> awkward<00:06:27.120> but<00:06:27.870> yeah<00:06:28.110> I

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:28.410 
just a little bit awkward but yeah I

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:30.920 
just a little bit awkward but yeah I
think<00:06:28.500> that's<00:06:28.830> all<00:06:28.919> for<00:06:28.979> now<00:06:29.160> and<00:06:29.690> lift<00:06:30.690> down<00:06:30.900> a

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:30.930 
think that's all for now and lift down a

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:32.270 
think that's all for now and lift down a
come<00:06:31.169> below<00:06:31.410> of<00:06:31.470> what<00:06:31.620> you<00:06:31.770> think<00:06:31.979> about<00:06:32.039> this

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:32.280 
come below of what you think about this

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:34.860 
come below of what you think about this
whole<00:06:32.460> thing<00:06:32.490> and<00:06:32.880> let's<00:06:33.330> go<00:06:33.510> figure<00:06:33.690> out

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:34.870 
whole thing and let's go figure out

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:36.930
