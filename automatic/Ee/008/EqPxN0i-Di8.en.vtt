00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:21.800 
is another test that I wanted to do a

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.210 
is another test that I wanted to do a
quick<00:00:22.039> video<00:00:22.220> on<00:00:23.050> it's<00:00:24.050> called<00:00:24.259> the<00:00:24.499> V<00:00:24.710> or<00:00:24.980> Y

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:25.220 
quick video on it's called the V or Y

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.950 
quick video on it's called the V or Y
under<00:00:25.550> the<00:00:25.910> eye<00:00:25.939> and<00:00:26.449> what<00:00:27.289> it<00:00:27.380> is<00:00:27.550> is<00:00:28.960> the

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:29.960 
under the eye and what it is is the

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.290 
under the eye and what it is is the
theory<00:00:30.230> behind<00:00:30.349> it<00:00:30.679> is<00:00:30.859> that<00:00:30.890> the<00:00:31.730> veins<00:00:31.999> in

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.300 
theory behind it is that the veins in

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.090 
theory behind it is that the veins in
your<00:00:32.570> eyes

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:34.100 
your eyes

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.150

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:40.730 
if it's on the left side then it is a
