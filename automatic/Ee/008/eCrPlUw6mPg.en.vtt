00:00:00.358 --> 00:00:04.649
 Let's go to the next game, which is a very new and very difficult game. 

00:00:04.649 --> 00:00:08.144
 It's called "Improbable Fairy Tale". 

00:00:08.144 --> 00:00:10.795
 How does this game work? Everybody plays, 

00:00:10.795 --> 00:00:14.529
 but does not have an order of who starts and who ends. 

00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:16.695
 Come when you feel like it. 

00:00:16.695 --> 00:00:21.592
 And I need the audience, and the audience light ... There. 

00:00:21.592 --> 00:00:24.716
 I need a person only who wants to give the name 

00:00:24.716 --> 00:00:26.440
 of a fairy tale that does not exist. 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:29.624
 - One at a time ... - If you were to write a children's book ... 

00:00:29.624 --> 00:00:32.532
 I'm short-sighted, but I know you've got your hand up. 

00:00:32.532 --> 00:00:35.497
 "It's you." "You turned around, you can get up, please." 

00:00:35.497 --> 00:00:40.097
 - You can talk. - 'The Story of the Prince Who called the Next Day'. 

00:00:40.097 --> 00:00:42.030
 - Rolled! - Wow... 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.200
 So we're going to do 'The Story of the Prince Who called the Next Day'. 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.269
 In "Improbable Fairy Tale" can only speak rhyming. 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:52.888
 All the text they speak has to be rhyming. 

00:00:52.888 --> 00:00:57.109
 This 'our' you speak is fiery. 'Ours' .... 

00:00:57.109 --> 00:00:59.172
 But that's right. They'll have to do everything by rhyming. 

00:00:59.172 --> 00:01:05.856
 So ... 'The Prince Who called the Next Day'. Valendo. 

00:01:06.797 --> 00:01:10.479
 Oh, I'm so nervous and anxious! 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:13.140
 Because yesterday I went out with a guy ... 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.775
 Oh oh... 

00:01:15.775 --> 00:01:18.904
 But I'm proud! 

00:01:18.919 --> 00:01:23.660
 This is the story of a girl. For a boy she gave herself up. 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.759
 She became anxious because one day passed and he did not call! 

00:01:29.218 --> 00:01:32.925
 It was then that she received the call at the end of the night. 

00:01:32.925 --> 00:01:36.745
 He tightened his beautiful heart tight! 

00:01:42.055 --> 00:01:45.077
 [singing] Call me, any time ... [ringtone] 

00:01:45.077 --> 00:01:48.487
 Ah! To tell me that you love me ... 

00:01:48.487 --> 00:01:52.390
 Hello, my dear! I'm eating some frosting, 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.291
 and now I ask: Was it good for you? 

00:02:02.456 --> 00:02:06.055
 It looks like it's fast, it seems rushed. 

00:02:06.055 --> 00:02:10.114
 The night before, they had had sex. 

00:02:10.488 --> 00:02:13.357
 Oh, speak up, my love! 

00:02:13.357 --> 00:02:19.202
 There may be some listener, but I'm so glad you called the next day! 

00:02:19.202 --> 00:02:23.140
 My dear, come to my house quickly. 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.726
 But attention, be careful with the way! 

00:02:27.943 --> 00:02:30.797
 Thirty minutes passed. 

00:02:30.797 --> 00:02:34.267
 So that hand found that it arrived 

00:02:34.267 --> 00:02:37.954
 and that the invitation was a mistake ... 

00:02:40.745 --> 00:02:43.986
 I'll explain again! 

00:02:51.893 --> 00:02:55.356
 I will explain again, since it was not very clear. 

00:02:55.356 --> 00:03:00.271
 His cell phone was not TIM, it was Claro's cell phone! 

00:03:08.147 --> 00:03:12.672
 Oh! My God, where does he live? I think I'm lost! 

00:03:12.672 --> 00:03:18.340
 If I do not find this house soon ... I'm going to be all burned! 

00:03:18.856 --> 00:03:23.804
 Oh, I see you're here! Found me first. 

00:03:23.804 --> 00:03:28.518
 What she does not know is that I am a mighty sorcerer! 

00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:35.267
 Who are you? What are you doing here? 

00:03:37.547 --> 00:03:43.012
 You see, my love, do you have some khaki? 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:46.909
 Yes I have. 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:53.647
 A persimmon ... From the fridge. 

00:03:54.003 --> 00:03:58.862
 Eat that persimmon ... He has a sleeping pill! 

00:03:59.561 --> 00:04:04.553
 It was then that the girl in the persimmon took a bite. 

00:04:04.553 --> 00:04:09.047
 Poor thing, she was fucked! 

00:04:11.495 --> 00:04:14.935
 [shouting] Noooooo! 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:17.952
 Damn it, I did not get there first! 

00:04:17.952 --> 00:04:23.056
 She was bewitched by the old sorcerer! 

00:04:23.246 --> 00:04:27.020
 - Haha ha! - You bastard! 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:31.458
 You must die! And if I can not do this, 

00:04:31.458 --> 00:04:34.447
 I'm going to sweep. 

00:04:35.773 --> 00:04:39.149
 Do not even try to sweep my land! 

00:04:41.519 --> 00:04:48.166
 Do not act with dementia, I am the voice of your conscience! 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:05:01.146
 My dear, do not fear! For I bring this potion. 

00:05:02.008 --> 00:05:07.547
 Pouring into you, I will raise your heart. 

00:05:07.811 --> 00:05:10.897
 It was then that the boy, with a beautiful feeling, 

00:05:10.897 --> 00:05:14.139
 awakened in that ... At that moment ... 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:16.575
 That moment! 

00:05:16.575 --> 00:05:20.355
 The girl was resurrected and the two of them hugged each other! 

00:05:20.355 --> 00:05:25.391
 They gave a tasty kiss and in that moment they stayed! 

00:05:26.851 --> 00:05:30.865
 It was then that I realized that doing romantic rhymes is not funny. 

00:05:30.865 --> 00:05:35.171
 I'm a super fan of Felipe Massa! 

00:05:37.288 --> 00:05:45.843
 Sorcerer! Good always wins evil ... With the simplest tactic! 

00:05:45.843 --> 00:05:50.090
 We will live happily, ignoring grammar! 

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:57.179
 [bell and applause] 

00:06:01.838 --> 00:06:06.040
 I lost the reputation of dumber now!
