00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.899 

all<00:00:00.269> right<00:00:00.480> so<00:00:00.659> two<00:00:01.199> AWS<00:00:01.800> is<00:00:01.979> versus<00:00:02.370> ballistic

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909 
all right so two AWS is versus ballistic

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:42.299 
all right so two AWS is versus ballistic
shield<00:00:03.120> all<00:00:03.659> right<00:00:03.810> go

00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:42.309 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:48.689 

that's<00:00:42.760> like<00:00:42.969> a<00:00:43.000> break<00:00:43.420> just<00:00:43.780> so<00:00:47.699> ballistic

00:00:48.689 --> 00:00:48.699 
that's like a break just so ballistic

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:55.740 
that's like a break just so ballistic
shield<00:00:48.910> versus<00:00:49.360> EMR

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:55.750 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.940 

hmm<00:00:56.730> that<00:00:57.730> does<00:00:58.350> without<00:00:59.350> that<00:00:59.620> would<00:00:59.770> break

00:00:59.940 --> 00:00:59.950 
hmm that does without that would break

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:08.540 
hmm that does without that would break
it<00:01:01.860> my<00:01:02.860> turn

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:08.550 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.030 

so<00:01:09.550> a<00:01:09.580> ballistic<00:01:10.240> shield<00:01:10.450> versus<00:01:10.900> 357<00:01:11.710> Magnum

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.040 
so a ballistic shield versus 357 Magnum

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:20.070 
so a ballistic shield versus 357 Magnum
and<00:01:12.370> step<00:01:12.670> you<00:01:12.760> 40<00:01:13.060> step<00:01:13.600> us<00:01:13.990> w4u<00:01:18.360> he<00:01:19.360> died<00:01:19.570> okay

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:20.080 
and step you 40 step us w4u he died okay

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.960 
and step you 40 step us w4u he died okay
so<00:01:20.140> ballistics<00:01:20.890> oil<00:01:21.100> versus<00:01:21.610> Rex<00:01:22.360> let's<00:01:23.230> go

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
so ballistics oil versus Rex let's go

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.320 
so ballistics oil versus Rex let's go
wow

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:25.330 
wow

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:30.000

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:32.470 
alright so a ballistic shield versus

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:51.760 
alright so a ballistic shield versus
shorty<00:01:33.310> 12-gauge

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.320 

all<00:01:52.770> right<00:01:52.920> so<00:01:53.160> a<00:01:53.190> ballistics<00:01:53.700> field<00:01:53.910> versus

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330 
all right so a ballistics field versus

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:59.450 
all right so a ballistics field versus
one<00:01:54.660> air<00:01:55.050> burst<00:01:55.290> all<00:01:55.830> right<00:01:55.920> go<00:01:58.340> that<00:01:59.340> goes

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
one air burst all right go that goes

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.160 
one air burst all right go that goes

happen

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:14.270 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:25.370 

mystic<00:02:15.270> shield<00:02:15.480> versus<00:02:15.810> UD<00:02:16.440> but

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:33.760 

the<00:02:26.380> MRAP<00:02:26.530> exploded<00:02:30.930> it's<00:02:31.930> not<00:02:32.080> working

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
the MRAP exploded it's not working

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:37.160 
the MRAP exploded it's not working
alright<00:02:34.940> 870mcs<00:02:35.940> with<00:02:36.300> slug<00:02:36.510> rounds<00:02:36.720> versus

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
alright 870mcs with slug rounds versus

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:46.070 
alright 870mcs with slug rounds versus
ballistic<00:02:37.590> shield<00:02:37.860> I<00:02:43.819> heard<00:02:44.819> it<00:02:44.940> broke<00:02:45.209> yep

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
ballistic shield I heard it broke yep

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:54.260 
ballistic shield I heard it broke yep
goes<00:02:47.069> through<00:02:52.520> alright<00:02:53.520> so<00:02:53.670> apparently<00:02:54.060> when

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
goes through alright so apparently when

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.300 
goes through alright so apparently when
you<00:02:54.360> pick<00:02:54.480> up<00:02:54.510> a<00:02:54.690> shield<00:02:54.930> or<00:02:55.440> something<00:02:56.220> from

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
you pick up a shield or something from

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.160 
you pick up a shield or something from
someone<00:02:56.550> else's<00:02:56.760> kit<00:02:57.030> the<00:02:57.630> glass<00:02:57.870> will<00:02:58.050> be

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
someone else's kit the glass will be

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:03.949 
someone else's kit the glass will be
repaired<00:02:58.500> let's<00:02:58.739> see<00:02:58.860> oh<00:03:00.170> it<00:03:01.170> broke<00:03:02.690> you<00:03:03.690> broke

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
repaired let's see oh it broke you broke

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.410 
repaired let's see oh it broke you broke
it<00:03:04.110> after<00:03:04.349> you<00:03:04.470> shot<00:03:04.680> it<00:03:04.860> okay<00:03:05.730> so<00:03:05.819> the<00:03:06.209> glass

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:06.420 
it after you shot it okay so the glass

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.240 
it after you shot it okay so the glass
fixes<00:03:06.810> itself<00:03:07.110> when<00:03:07.380> you<00:03:07.620> pick<00:03:07.800> up<00:03:07.890> the<00:03:08.040> shield

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
fixes itself when you pick up the shield

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.259 
fixes itself when you pick up the shield
from<00:03:08.640> another<00:03:08.910> kit<00:03:09.150> that<00:03:09.330> was<00:03:09.420> broken<00:03:11.269> itself

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
from another kit that was broken itself

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:18.670 
from another kit that was broken itself
again<00:03:15.709> let<00:03:16.709> me<00:03:16.739> try<00:03:16.950> it<00:03:16.980> this<00:03:17.250> real<00:03:17.489> quick

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
again let me try it this real quick

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.960 
again let me try it this real quick
alright<00:03:19.680> so<00:03:19.950> ballistic<00:03:20.400> shield<00:03:20.580> versus

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
alright so ballistic shield versus

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:28.339 
alright so ballistic shield versus
mobile<00:03:21.150> a<00:03:21.360> twenty<00:03:21.870> millimeter

00:03:28.339 --> 00:03:28.349 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:34.470 

he<00:03:29.349> goes<00:03:29.470> right<00:03:29.620> through<00:03:32.280> okay<00:03:33.360> well<00:03:34.360> they're

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
he goes right through okay well they're

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.390 
he goes right through okay well they're
sick<00:03:34.660> shield<00:03:34.900> versus<00:03:35.290> languishing<00:03:35.920> in<00:03:36.040> on<00:03:36.190> the

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
sick shield versus languishing in on the

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:44.290 
sick shield versus languishing in on the
MBT<00:03:37.000> turret<00:03:37.840> main<00:03:38.200> turret

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:44.300 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:52.479 

really<00:03:45.480> that's<00:03:46.260> not<00:03:46.440> going<00:03:46.560> to<00:03:46.620> him<00:03:47.870> really

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:57.760 

that's<00:03:53.489> obnoxious

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:57.770 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:00.620 

so<00:03:58.770> ballistic<00:03:59.520> shield<00:03:59.760> versus<00:04:00.209> heavy

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
so ballistic shield versus heavy

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.260 
so ballistic shield versus heavy

machine-gun coaxial for the main cannon

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:07.250 
machine-gun coaxial for the main cannon
on<00:04:03.390> the<00:04:03.420> tank<00:04:03.660> let's<00:04:04.140> go<00:04:04.260> I<00:04:05.750> was<00:04:06.750> expecting<00:04:07.230> to

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:07.260 
on the tank let's go I was expecting to

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:14.630 
on the tank let's go I was expecting to
just<00:04:07.470> go<00:04:07.650> right<00:04:07.830> through<00:04:07.890> it<00:04:08.099> a<00:04:13.190> shield<00:04:14.190> versus

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:14.640 
just go right through it a shield versus

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:26.540 
just go right through it a shield versus
gonna<00:04:15.090> see<00:04:15.360> it<00:04:15.450> on<00:04:15.630> the<00:04:15.900> MBT<00:04:25.340> ballistic<00:04:26.340> shield

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
gonna see it on the MBT ballistic shield

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:35.690 
gonna see it on the MBT ballistic shield
versus<00:04:26.910> main<00:04:27.360> cannon<00:04:34.190> that<00:04:35.190> would<00:04:35.460> be

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:35.700 
versus main cannon that would be

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:45.810 
versus main cannon that would be
hilarious<00:04:35.880> blocked<00:04:36.660> it

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:45.820 

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:47.880
