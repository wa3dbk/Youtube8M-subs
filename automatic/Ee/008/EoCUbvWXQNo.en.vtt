00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:08.510
 hi i'm antonella and today we'll do a 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:09.890
 little snowman with the 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:11.810
 polystyrene 

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:13.550
 then first of all we need to 

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:15.590
 two polystyrene balls one more 

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:18.020
 large and a smaller one 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:20.750
 we need crepe paper wadding 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:24.890
 red green line card a small piece 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:27.890
 of cardboard the scissors of the 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:31.460
 glue the glitter tape 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:35.570
 silver a speed eno peter lynn e 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:37.160
 buttons and fire is a brush 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.840
 first of all we have to say the head the 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:41.690
 body of our snowman 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.910
 let's take our task e 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.970
 we make a hole in the center of the 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:49.220
 our ball deep enough then 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.680
 let us take a spirit that I have broken 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:53.180
 to make it a little shorter we slip in 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:57.590
 within that future 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:01:00.230
 we also play our party 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:05.890
 snowman always that skewer 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.890
 I trust we make a nice hole 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:15.060
 and we join it to the body of the puppet 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:18.000
 perfect now we need to create the base 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:21.540
 because this is not read we cut out a 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.460
 small square of cardboard and we can 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.140
 cover with green tissue paper 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.290
 it can also change tissue paper 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.570
 red or whitish we give more or less the 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.040
 size of our card we cut a 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.680
 bit large enough to 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.410
 cover it and close it as if it were 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.010
 a packet we stop the card with del 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.010
 Scotch tape 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.710
 now we must attack ours 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:50.790
 puppet in the center because the bassano yes 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:54.360
 hold up well let's put some glue then 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:57.330
 let's go for a pin our puppet it 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.420
 we lay down to the glue we are not at 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:04.050
 contrary and we combine the two parts with the 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:06.360
 pin we can make the hat there 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:09.660
 it will be from our red crepe paper 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:12.690
 we go up a square of the longer side o 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:15.870
 less than ten centimeters widen it 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:19.769
 ago we attach it to the puppet's head 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:23.010
 and then the tip we can come to 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:26.550
 pick up a place in itself here it is 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.810
 and there we pass now that we understand 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.220
 what is the right size we can 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.220
 attach the two ends 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:38.410
 a bit so that you stick now instead 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.800
 we always do with our card 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.300
 crest the scarf of our puppet of 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.540
 snow 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:49.000
 the Italian a fairly long strip 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:54.580
 here we see if the length is good 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:58.120
 we widen a little we cut the two 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:03:01.510
 ends creating fringes we have 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:03.160
 a little these too now to be able to 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:05.800
 to be able to put our jackets we have 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:10.030
 need a pin and even one 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:13.870
 bellina rossa the Foggia we put a 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:19.030
 side on the other and stop it with the 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:19.660
 pin now we have to complete the 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.690
 hat 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:26.080
 we take our cotton wool and create a 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:29.020
 quite long cord 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:31.770
 my name is glue on the edge of the 

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:31.770
 castle 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:37.909
 we have our made 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:44.379
 and then we confuse ours 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:50.319
 hats with a ball of auction 

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:52.810
 the pelletry well then we tighten the 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:56.409
 hat tip we can cut 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:59.849
 also the excess part we start the 

00:03:56.409 --> 00:04:04.500
 glue in the center of the tin but let's start 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:04.500
 perfect now let's put on the buttons 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:13.470
 now only the nose for eyes are missing 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:18.000
 we need him a sedan 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:24.030
 long rose is an incentive to do the 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:27.150
 nose feeling for every eye use 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:29.970
 a very small green sedan is one 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:33.060
 shirt always turns with a pin of 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:34.860
 block both to make it more 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:38.520
 bright we can put some glitter 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:40.770
 silver on the base and we distribute it with 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:43.770
 a brush 

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:43.770
 over
