00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.400

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:31.259
 530 many of you from my 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.910
 subscribers have asked me to do this 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:38.880
 video and well the customization 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.750
 that I had previously is a bit 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:45.260
 different from what I have now 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:49.310
 the only thing that changes are the icons and the 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:51.500
 wallpaper basically good for 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:53.660
 this customization 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:57.990
 use your new album 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:01:00.750
 and to get a little closer to oli pop 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:03.020
 in the applications drawer I put on show 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.630
 page masks 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:08.969
 very appearance 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.490
 and here if they want more lollipop 

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:14.369
 icons give lollipop icons 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.079
 and logically the breasts if they want my 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.860
 person and the exception that I have right now 

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:23.509

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:27.569

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:37.350

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:42.590
 what else could I tell you about fighting 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.590
 I think that's basically that 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:49.390
 it seems to go with the customization that 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:53.060
 I have use modules because you can see here 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:57.770
 how do I have the bar 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:02:00.120
 different and just like I like it 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:03.620
 and good 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.620
 to customize this 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:09.819
 I have several modules installed 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:13.299
 which can see here 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:17.409
 they are blue bird there are very clear 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:19.830
 the color bars gravity box extremen king 

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:22.490
 and xperia flipshare course 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.490

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:30.950
 let's give a revised like this to the 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:32.930
 to each of these clubs diminished 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:37.600
 but so configured in this way 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:42.010

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:45.430
 I have set and ready in which is the 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:48.130
 color bar it seems to me that they only install it 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.520
 active on the disk it seems they tell me 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.520
 nothing 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.519
 and some modification 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:03:01.850
 The gravity box is very wide to be able 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:05.000
 many that in this video you should 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:07.360
 to know this gravity box and that 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 keep some idea of ​​how 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:15.900
 how to do it 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.900
 and I also use this rally 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:23.250
 I have the jungle theme right now 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:26.280

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:31.680
 They asked about this topic and I will try to 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:34.350
 look for the link because we do not remember 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.840

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:39.450

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:43.040
 with everything upload the file that I have 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:47.760
 so that you can personalize your 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:50.460
 your mobile and finally I have installed 

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:53.040
 xperia flip settings 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:55.830
 what is it that allows us to have the 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:58.950
 bar and the quick accesses of this 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:01.280
 way like that kitkat style could be 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.280
 tell 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:07.630
 and finally to finish with the 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:10.800
 customization that I have right now 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:14.580

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:27.000
 destruction 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:31.080
 and well that would be everything and I think it was a 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.870
