and<00:00:43.410> context<00:00:44.040> it's<00:00:44.280> convoluted<00:00:44.910> is<00:00:45.420> what<00:00:45.600> it

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:45.720 
and context it's convoluted is what it

is<00:00:45.750> but<00:00:46.260> back<00:00:46.470> then<00:00:46.500> there<00:00:47.489> you<00:00:47.790> go<00:00:47.820> move<00:00:48.449> boost

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
is but back then there you go move boost

is but back then there you go move boost
now<00:00:50.220> go<00:00:50.430> play<00:00:50.730> oh<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.390> uh<00:00:51.530> good<00:00:52.530> freakin<00:00:52.980> luck

the complexity let's in the chambers
right<00:01:44.320> next<00:01:44.620> to<00:01:44.710> all<00:01:44.740> the<00:01:44.890> damn<00:01:45.130> spikes

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.140 

there's<00:01:50.110> a<00:01:50.200> casual<00:01:50.740> mode<00:01:50.980> which<00:01:51.310> doesn't<00:01:51.970> keep

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.150 
there's a casual mode which doesn't keep

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.750 
there's a casual mode which doesn't keep
score<00:01:52.630> and<00:01:52.870> lets<00:01:53.200> you<00:01:53.320> continue<00:01:53.770> as<00:01:54.160> well<00:01:54.610> as<00:01:54.730> a

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:54.760 
score and lets you continue as well as a

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.120 
score and lets you continue as well as a
normal<00:01:55.240> and<00:01:55.480> hardcore<00:01:56.080> mode<00:01:56.350> I'm<00:01:56.860> not<00:01:57.070> a

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
normal and hardcore mode I'm not a

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.540 
normal and hardcore mode I'm not a
sadist<00:01:57.490> so<00:01:58.120> yeah<00:01:58.810> casual<00:01:59.470> was<00:01:59.770> fine<00:02:00.280> with<00:02:00.490> me

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550 
sadist so yeah casual was fine with me

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.270 
sadist so yeah casual was fine with me
the<00:02:01.210> thing<00:02:01.360> that's<00:02:01.600> great<00:02:01.930> about<00:02:01.960> 48<00:02:02.770> chambers

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
the thing that's great about 48 chambers

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.490 
the thing that's great about 48 chambers
is<00:02:03.490> that<00:02:03.910> it<00:02:04.000> controls<00:02:04.390> so<00:02:04.660> well<00:02:04.870> moving<00:02:05.230> your

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500 
is that it controls so well moving your

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.460 
is that it controls so well moving your
ship<00:02:05.740> is<00:02:05.950> just<00:02:06.490> extremely<00:02:07.000> responsive<00:02:07.870> so<00:02:08.200> the

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
ship is just extremely responsive so the

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:10.200 
ship is just extremely responsive so the
game<00:02:08.619> totally<00:02:09.100> gets<00:02:09.280> out<00:02:09.430> of<00:02:09.550> the<00:02:09.640> way<00:02:09.670> it's

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.210 
game totally gets out of the way it's

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:14.160 
game totally gets out of the way it's
just<00:02:10.510> you<00:02:10.810> those<00:02:11.530> chambers<00:02:12.300> those<00:02:13.300> spikes<00:02:13.810> so

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
just you those chambers those spikes so

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:23.270 
just you those chambers those spikes so
God

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.640 

I<00:02:23.340> can't<00:02:24.270> recommend<00:02:24.569> this<00:02:24.750> game<00:02:24.959> enough<00:02:25.380> it's

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
I can't recommend this game enough it's

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.650 
I can't recommend this game enough it's
a<00:02:25.770> wicked<00:02:25.980> throwback<00:02:26.700> to<00:02:27.150> the<00:02:27.180> days<00:02:27.270> when

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
a wicked throwback to the days when

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.720 
a wicked throwback to the days when
multiplayer<00:02:28.290> meant<00:02:28.620> taking<00:02:28.980> turns<00:02:29.400> with<00:02:29.550> your

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
multiplayer meant taking turns with your

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.390 
multiplayer meant taking turns with your
friends<00:02:30.240> and<00:02:30.330> shouting<00:02:31.200> out<00:02:31.350> ideas<00:02:31.770> when<00:02:32.280> an

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
friends and shouting out ideas when an

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.699 
friends and shouting out ideas when an
instruction<00:02:33.090> manual<00:02:33.120> wasn't<00:02:34.110> half<00:02:34.290> filled

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
instruction manual wasn't half filled

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:37.550

with<00:02:35.060> contextual<00:02:36.060> control<00:02:36.840> commands<00:02:37.290> when

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
with contextual control commands when

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.260 
with contextual control commands when
the<00:02:37.650> complexity<00:02:38.250> came<00:02:38.459> not<00:02:38.700> from<00:02:38.850> learning

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
the complexity came not from learning

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.000 
the complexity came not from learning
how<00:02:39.450> to<00:02:39.510> play<00:02:39.780> but<00:02:40.380> from<00:02:40.560> getting<00:02:40.860> through

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
how to play but from getting through

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:46.280 
how to play but from getting through
though<00:02:41.190> those<00:02:42.200> those<00:02:43.200> spikes<00:02:44.959> it's<00:02:45.959> 48

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
though those those spikes it's 48
