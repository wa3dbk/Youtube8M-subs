why<00:01:59.310> fin<00:01:59.610> polishes<00:02:00.119> work<00:02:00.270> great<00:02:00.719> sometimes

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
why fin polishes work great sometimes

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.539 
why fin polishes work great sometimes
because<00:02:01.500> you<00:02:01.590> just<00:02:01.829> wanted<00:02:02.100> to<00:02:02.159> be<00:02:02.340> like<00:02:02.520> a

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
because you just wanted to be like a

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.610 
because you just wanted to be like a
sheer<00:02:03.000> veil<00:02:03.390> and<00:02:03.719> see<00:02:04.439> how<00:02:04.649> that<00:02:04.710> blends<00:02:05.219> my

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:05.620 
sheer veil and see how that blends my

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:08.969 
sheer veil and see how that blends my
orange<00:02:05.920> into<00:02:06.340> my<00:02:06.490> yellow<00:02:07.260> making<00:02:08.260> that<00:02:08.500> into<00:02:08.800> a

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
orange into my yellow making that into a

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
to do is I had to mix a blue and a

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.760 
to do is I had to mix a blue and a
purple<00:03:16.220> the<00:03:16.670> purple<00:03:16.700> that<00:03:17.300> I<00:03:17.330> had<00:03:17.770> was

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:18.770 
purple the purple that I had was

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:21.220 
purple the purple that I had was
translucent<00:03:19.490> and<00:03:19.670> so<00:03:19.910> you<00:03:19.970> there's<00:03:20.720> no<00:03:21.020> way

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
translucent and so you there's no way

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:22.540 
translucent and so you there's no way
that<00:03:21.410> you<00:03:21.530> could<00:03:21.710> have<00:03:21.800> made<00:03:21.920> the<00:03:22.070> purple<00:03:22.400> work

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:22.550 
that you could have made the purple work

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:24.640 
that you could have made the purple work
without<00:03:22.730> adding<00:03:23.150> white<00:03:23.330> to<00:03:23.360> it<00:03:23.570> so<00:03:24.200> I<00:03:24.230> added<00:03:24.440> a

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
without adding white to it so I added a

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:25.870 
without adding white to it so I added a
little<00:03:24.860> bit<00:03:24.980> of<00:03:25.070> white<00:03:25.250> and<00:03:25.460> it<00:03:25.580> gave<00:03:25.760> it

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
little bit of white and it gave it

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:27.760 
little bit of white and it gave it
substance<00:03:26.540> so<00:03:26.810> that<00:03:26.840> it<00:03:27.020> would<00:03:27.140> look<00:03:27.410> good<00:03:27.710> on

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:27.770 
substance so that it would look good on

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:32.590 
substance so that it would look good on
the<00:03:28.130> nail<00:03:28.310> and<00:03:28.550> the<00:03:29.030> blue<00:03:29.330> is<00:03:29.660> going<00:03:30.530> to<00:03:31.600> also
