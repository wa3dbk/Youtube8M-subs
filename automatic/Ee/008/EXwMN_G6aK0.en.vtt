just so i can show you guys shift six so
it<00:01:49.590> looks<00:01:49.860> it's<00:01:50.159> going<00:01:50.280> to<00:01:50.340> look<00:01:50.460> like<00:01:50.490> that

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
it looks it's going to look like that

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.230 
it looks it's going to look like that
now<00:01:51.630> once<00:01:52.079> you<00:01:52.170> get<00:01:52.320> that<00:01:52.549> for<00:01:53.549> each<00:01:53.670> class<00:01:54.030> you

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
now once you get that for each class you

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.990 
now once you get that for each class you
have<00:01:54.270> goes<00:01:54.780> all<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.020> way<00:01:55.200> up<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:55.290> 10<00:01:55.759> or<00:01:56.759> sorry

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
have goes all the way up to 10 or sorry

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.399 
have goes all the way up to 10 or sorry
i<00:01:57.060> think<00:01:57.180> it<00:01:57.360> actually<00:01:57.450> only<00:01:57.659> goes<00:01:57.869> to<00:01:58.020> seven

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
i think it actually only goes to seven

00:01:58.409 --> 00:01:59.660 
i think it actually only goes to seven
so<00:01:58.530> you<00:01:58.619> can<00:01:58.740> only<00:01:58.829> have<00:01:59.009> seven<00:01:59.369> colored

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
so you can only have seven colored

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.620 
so you can only have seven colored
classes<00:02:00.180> but<00:02:00.420> one<00:02:01.409> is<00:02:02.149> so<00:02:03.149> you<00:02:03.240> just<00:02:03.360> hit<00:02:03.540> the

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
classes but one is so you just hit the

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:04.850 
classes but one is so you just hit the
number<00:02:03.899> of<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.049> class<00:02:04.229> so<00:02:04.500> if<00:02:04.619> it's<00:02:04.740> your

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
number of the class so if it's your

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.950 
number of the class so if it's your
first<00:02:04.890> custom<00:02:05.490> class<00:02:05.670> hit<00:02:05.969> shift<00:02:06.299> six<00:02:06.630> and<00:02:06.840> the
