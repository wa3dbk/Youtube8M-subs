00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:41.450 
these have a mic in them and also

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.690 
these have a mic in them and also
buttons<00:03:42.450> to<00:03:42.630> control<00:03:42.660> the<00:03:43.260> volume<00:03:44.220> and<00:03:44.519> stuff

buttons to control the volume and stuff

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.250 
buttons to control the volume and stuff
hopefully<00:03:44.910> in<00:03:45.150> to<00:03:45.239> answer<00:03:45.480> calls<00:03:45.660> on<00:03:45.870> that<00:03:46.019> and

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
hopefully in to answer calls on that and

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.490 
hopefully in to answer calls on that and
here<00:03:47.099> we<00:03:47.130> have<00:03:47.220> some<00:03:47.880> different<00:03:48.690> sized<00:03:48.930> ear

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
here we have some different sized ear

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.270 
here we have some different sized ear
buds<00:03:49.859> for<00:03:50.790> the<00:03:50.970> earphones<00:03:51.660> and<00:03:51.950> then<00:03:52.950> this

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
buds for the earphones and then this

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.259 
buds for the earphones and then this
massive<00:03:54.239> battery<00:03:54.959> that's<00:03:55.560> really<00:03:56.069> heavy<00:03:56.269> I

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
massive battery that's really heavy I

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:01.909 
massive battery that's really heavy I
think<00:03:57.780> this<00:03:57.870> is<00:03:58.669> 3,100<00:03:59.669> 3,200<00:04:00.560> milliamp<00:04:01.560> hours

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:01.919 
think this is 3,100 3,200 milliamp hours

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:03.890 
think this is 3,100 3,200 milliamp hours
something<00:04:02.099> like<00:04:02.190> that<00:04:02.459> but<00:04:03.180> that's<00:04:03.389> a<00:04:03.540> really

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
something like that but that's a really

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.339 
something like that but that's a really
nice<00:04:04.049> little<00:04:04.799> selection<00:04:05.099> of<00:04:05.489> accessories

00:04:06.339 --> 00:04:06.349
