what<00:03:07.260> I<00:03:07.290> mean<00:03:07.379> it<00:03:07.650> pretty<00:03:07.860> simple<00:03:08.099> the<00:03:08.340> fewer

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
what I mean it pretty simple the fewer

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:10.220 
what I mean it pretty simple the fewer

score<00:03:10.470> for<00:03:10.709> yourself<00:03:11.129> i<00:03:11.280> mean<00:03:11.489> that's

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
score for yourself i mean that's

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:14.390
