Tony is what is all you see all the rest
that's<00:00:09.870> coming<00:00:10.139> off<00:00:10.260> the<00:00:10.410> brakes<00:00:10.650> you<00:00:10.830> can<00:00:10.980> see

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
that's coming off the brakes you can see

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.720 
that's coming off the brakes you can see
yes<00:00:11.519> exactly<00:00:11.880> exactly<00:00:12.769> the<00:00:13.769> tack<00:00:14.400> thing<00:00:14.610> is<00:00:14.700> a

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
yes exactly exactly the tack thing is a

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.129 
yes exactly exactly the tack thing is a
minor<00:00:15.000> spray<00:00:15.299> the<00:00:15.450> whole<00:00:15.570> tire<00:00:15.780> by<00:00:15.960> the<00:00:16.020> way

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
minor spray the whole tire by the way

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.410 
minor spray the whole tire by the way
just<00:00:16.800> because<00:00:17.130> it's<00:00:17.340> not<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:17.580> biopolymer<00:00:18.330> in

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
just because it's not the biopolymer in

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.810 
just because it's not the biopolymer in
it<00:00:18.539> so<00:00:19.109> it<00:00:19.199> keeps<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.529> tires<00:00:19.740> black<00:00:20.100> and<00:00:20.460> what

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
it so it keeps the tires black and what

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.040 
it so it keeps the tires black and what
you're<00:00:20.939> doing<00:00:21.150> is<00:00:21.240> putting<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.570> anti<00:00:21.840> static

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
you're doing is putting the anti static

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:32.089 
you're doing is putting the anti static
charge<00:00:22.500> on<00:00:22.710> there<00:00:22.949> excellent<00:00:23.970> yeah<00:00:31.099> okay

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
charge on there excellent yeah okay

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.350 
charge on there excellent yeah okay
that's<00:00:32.309> what<00:00:32.430> I'm<00:00:32.610> looking<00:00:32.880> at<00:00:32.969> you<00:00:33.059> see<00:00:33.210> this

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
something you can clean I mean it's

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:50.990 
something you can clean I mean it's
helping<00:00:49.980> it<00:00:50.219> well<00:00:50.460> it's<00:00:50.610> not<00:00:50.700> something

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
helping it well it's not something

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.819 
helping it well it's not something
others<00:00:51.270> people<00:00:51.629> can<00:00:51.750> clean<00:00:51.930> off<00:00:52.050> I<00:00:52.260> can

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
others people can clean off I can

00:00:52.829 --> 00:01:02.290 
others people can clean off I can
because<00:00:53.820> I<00:00:53.910> didn't<00:00:54.149> tell<00:00:54.300> you<00:00:54.449> I<00:00:54.690> invented

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.980 

other<00:01:03.300> participating<00:01:04.049> retailers<00:01:04.739> see<00:01:05.990> no

reason<00:01:07.409> to<00:01:07.470> spray<00:01:07.830> the<00:01:07.950> rubber<00:01:08.130> by<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.340> way

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
reason to spray the rubber by the way

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.670 
reason to spray the rubber by the way
just<00:01:08.640> stop<00:01:08.939> kidding<00:01:09.180> around<00:01:09.270> for<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:09.600> second<00:01:09.900> is

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
just stop kidding around for a second is

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.039 
just stop kidding around for a second is
the<00:01:10.920> biopolymer<00:01:11.580> likes<00:01:11.820> to<00:01:11.970> attack<00:01:12.090> actually

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
the biopolymer likes to attack actually

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:25.460 
the biopolymer likes to attack actually
stop<00:01:13.470> for<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.740> second<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:24.080> some<00:01:25.080> people<00:01:25.350> can

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
stop for a second and some people can

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.469 
stop for a second and some people can
see<00:01:25.500> this<00:01:25.740> is<00:01:25.890> why<00:01:26.040> you<00:01:26.100> do<00:01:26.520> this<00:01:26.729> first<00:01:27.119> before

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
see this is why you do this first before

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.920 
see this is why you do this first before
the<00:01:27.840> auto<00:01:28.200> wash<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:28.680> shine<00:01:29.180> right<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.810> this

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
the auto wash and shine right and this

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.109 
the auto wash and shine right and this
one<00:01:31.079> up<00:01:31.170> all<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.500> road<00:01:31.710> tar<00:01:32.009> off<00:01:32.250> it<00:01:32.610> melts<00:01:32.939> all

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
one up all the road tar off it melts all

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.140 
one up all the road tar off it melts all
the<00:01:33.320> bugs<00:01:34.320> off<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.340> license<00:01:35.729> plate<00:01:35.970> by

the bugs off and the license plate by
the<00:01:36.210> way<00:01:36.360> is<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.570> big<00:01:36.750> thing<00:01:36.780> people<00:01:37.140> let

really get crazy about it found I need
you<00:01:41.700> like<00:01:41.790> I<00:01:41.850> said<00:01:42.150> this<00:01:42.299> isn't<00:01:42.509> too<00:01:42.720> bad<00:01:42.750> this

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
you like I said this isn't too bad this

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.200 
you like I said this isn't too bad this
is<00:01:43.259> pretty<00:01:43.439> easy<00:01:43.530> actually<00:01:43.920> but<00:01:44.909> yeah<00:01:45.090> it

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
is pretty easy actually but yeah it

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.569 
is pretty easy actually but yeah it
needs<00:01:45.360> to<00:01:45.509> sit<00:01:45.780> otherwise<00:01:46.170> right<00:01:46.500> yeah<00:01:46.890> I<00:01:46.920> like

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
needs to sit otherwise right yeah I like

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.190 
needs to sit otherwise right yeah I like
to<00:01:47.700> spray<00:01:47.970> them<00:01:48.119> all<00:01:48.270> down<00:01:48.509> do<00:01:48.780> all<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.049> wheel

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
to spray them all down do all the wheel

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.380 
to spray them all down do all the wheel
spray<00:01:49.680> all<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:49.860> wheels<00:01:50.100> around<00:01:50.250> and<00:01:51.119> then<00:01:51.270> I

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
spray all the wheels around and then I

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.999 
spray all the wheels around and then I
go<00:01:51.570> around<00:01:51.659> and<00:01:51.990> then<00:01:52.259> I<00:01:52.290> get<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.590> auto<00:01:52.740> wash

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
go around and then I get the auto wash

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.910 
go around and then I get the auto wash
and<00:01:53.220> shine<00:01:53.399> going<00:01:53.700> in<00:01:54.390> the<00:01:54.720> thing<00:01:55.590> and<00:01:55.770> then

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
and shine going in the thing and then

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.440 
and shine going in the thing and then
that's<00:01:56.189> what<00:01:56.340> puts<00:01:56.610> that<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:57.000> big<00:01:57.210> thick

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
that's what puts that the big thick

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.580 
that's what puts that the big thick
biopolymer<00:01:58.229> in<00:01:58.380> and<00:01:59.159> then<00:02:00.439> you're<00:02:01.439> basically

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
biopolymer in and then you're basically

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.889 
biopolymer in and then you're basically
creating<00:02:02.520> an<00:02:02.759> anti-static<00:02:03.299> surge<00:02:03.689> the

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
creating an anti-static surge the

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.870 
creating an anti-static surge the
processor

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
processor

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.070 
processor
you<00:02:06.880> can<00:02:07.030> seal<00:02:07.180> them<00:02:07.359> for<00:02:07.600> the<00:02:07.719> break<00:02:07.869> that's

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
you can seal them for the break that's

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.960 
you can seal them for the break that's
diseases<00:02:08.590> school<00:02:09.039> we<00:02:09.190> saw<00:02:09.399> in<00:02:09.550> their<00:02:09.729> leaves

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
diseases school we saw in their leaves

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:11.790 
diseases school we saw in their leaves
you<00:02:10.119> just<00:02:10.300> kept<00:02:10.479> coming<00:02:10.780> up<00:02:11.080> all<00:02:11.290> the<00:02:11.530> crops

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
you just kept coming up all the crops
