00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:09.530
 It will be the iphone 5 s u ichi here 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:12.910
 If it was gray, I bought it inadvertently because I would go back soon 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:14.670
 This is iphone 5 yeah 

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:18.630
 Color guard 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.170
 After all it's a grader and iphone 5s is lighter in color 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.369
 I will 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:28.110
 I think that it is often used as a camera 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:29.189
 I thought that I wanted a professional-like color as much as possible by avoiding bold and such 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:32.580
 It was good 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:34.660
 Well I tried the camera a little and tried it 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:37.900
 There love because I tried a little bit 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:42.640
 It is a bell but I want to get it 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:46.340
 First Come blur in the fact that iphone 5 s sensor is increased 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:52.430
 I expected it to be a little bigger 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:56.150
 Well Mitaju I wonder that such a camera slightly blurred 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:01:04.940
 Well massage Kawan not shop and Jacko even though the following is 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:06.360
 It has been improved well and say what about what is Toka moved ghost Toka flare definitive backlit 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:12.780
 It is called color 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:17.400
 Great Buddha Guides Emotions Well, even if the conditions for the light to hit Well with the iphone 55s 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:20.400
 It is super beautiful Which also took Naa clean it over to the 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:23.490
 If you think that it is definitely different 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:26.350
 It is a camera inside the in-camera Face time camera 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:31.180
 The picture here is completely different 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:32.500
 I took 2 shots like this and tried to shoot under the conditions of backlight. 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:39.190
 I tried 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:39.940
 After all it is better for 5s. Please see here. 5less has better color. 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:45.759
 Because 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:46.340
 I think I feel that white blur a rather Those who iphone 5 also here videos 

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:50.810
 I took a picture 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:55.880
 And Kedomo I saw while the iphone 5 s is relatively clean 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:59.840
 iphone 5 has strange flares in it 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:03.110
 As for which one you can use and which one you want to use 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:07.729
 It will be towards the in-camera of 5 s 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:12.230
 I'm very interested in the in-camera because I'm a video blogger . 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:15.900
 Kedomo I do it is often photographed doing this from a travel destination in the camera 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:22.709
 It can be said that the Well kana not you say, even if you are not a so 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:26.159
 There you just ne ordinary operation large-less movement than there is in ios 75, even 5 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:30.000
 I thought I might be fine too, but after all 

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:33.200
 If it is 5 s, it's a suck 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:39.170
 It is crisp but 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:42.160
 I this over a period of 24 months in the fact that the kana not it enough in 5 of Te 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:45.410
 I will pay by division though 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:51.560
 80,000 more than it is you price here'll also 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:57.470
 a value starred by a person who owns the iphone 5 as to whether it is worth buying 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:03:02.140
 I think that there is no place for now but is in relation to whether or not there 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:05.230
 Very you feel like good will not have to Hachiman if available 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:08.920
 It is better to spend money on other things 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:11.950
 Even though there are at a level on a reported Yes that I felt that way 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:17.140
 was there a iphone 5 s 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:17.530
 At 2 o'clock, the model changed from iphone 4 to iphone 5 c 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:21.879
 The 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:24.250
 I think if it changes dramatically so much I think it is worth it 

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:31.170
 I Nde speed of innovation has stagnated 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:31.170
 It feels like it will become better if the steamer is about once every two years from now on
