00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:03.890
 two 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.940
 but I like them 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:27.640
 and like them very much I leave you with the video 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:45.949
 and let's start with the video the 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:47.929
 first step will be to apply a 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:50.059
 corrector I previously already apply in 

00:00:47.929 --> 00:00:52.429
 eyelash mask so I'm going to 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:54.769
 use this cream and have 

00:00:52.429 --> 00:00:57.260
 sunscreen will help you cover 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:59.210
 very well my imperfections use the 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.549
 brochita and diffuse it very well with my 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:04.129
 fingers the next step is going to be apply 

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:06.830
 a bicrim I used this that is the 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:09.080
 division are going and will help me cover 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.299
 imperfections also has a substitute 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.780
 lightening and andrew gas and blocker 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:16.729
 solar 50 has a final finish as of 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:20.350
 powder then they no longer need to apply 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:20.350
 nothing more to ratify the skin 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:26.240
 now let's place the shadows this 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:28.520
 makeup is very natural then I'm going to 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.310
 apply very little products nothing more 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.920
 to define my eyes first those of 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:36.730
 line and with the darkest color and what 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.710
 diffuse very well with a brush 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:41.040
 and apply it also on the eyelashes 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.040
 lower 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.590
 now I'm going to delineate my eyes use 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.440
 sexy black that is a very eyeliner 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:52.050
 black and liquid that comes with a brush 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:56.360
 very tiny then I finished very well 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.360
 nothing else on the edge of my eyelashes 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:05.049
 for my eyebrows a mask of 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:07.630
 eyebrows is dark and only 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:09.670
 serves as refills as has gel 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.899
 will also help to fix them so that 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.899
 do not move during the day 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.400
 and that's how my eyes looked and 

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:20.260
 now let's apply brooch and I chose 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.629
 this is a clear tone but if you 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.969
 comes to notice and I'm going to apply it with a 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:27.870
 I'm not going to 

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:27.870
 apply on my cheekbones 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.700
 and we continue with our lipstick this 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:37.560
 it's also very clear it looks like the tone 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.650
 natural from my lips and has a sunscreen 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.650
 solar 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:46.740
 and at the end of chan is the result that 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.810
 you can get as you can see no 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:51.330
 They need to use many products to 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:52.910
 make a makeup that can be casual 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.200
 or at night to leave 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.970
 use a and white shoes with 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.500
 laces and wide heel 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.940
 They serve very well for those to whom 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.590
 They have a hard time using heels 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.960
 because they feel like they're 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.910
 using tennis also use some 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:07.620
 long socks that are above the 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:10.880
 knee and in the end they end up with 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:13.580
 These are black lace 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:16.580
 and the being that is of a color that is 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:18.770
 using a lot in winter and it's this 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.890
 Wine color is short but with the 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:23.870
 socks do not feel cold believe me 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:26.860
 also a black blouse that is 

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:29.750
 very basic and has lace on the sleeves 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:32.720
 as you can see it combines well and also 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:35.090

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.130
