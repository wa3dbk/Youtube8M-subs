00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.370 

we're<00:01:29.000> done<00:01:29.179> with<00:01:29.359> the<00:01:29.450> library<00:01:29.869> so<00:01:30.140> let's

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
we're done with the library so let's

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.469 
we're done with the library so let's
bring<00:01:30.619> up<00:01:30.710> the<00:01:30.920> attribute<00:01:31.520> inspector<00:01:32.119> and<00:01:32.270> use

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
bring up the attribute inspector and use

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:34.690 
bring up the attribute inspector and use
it<00:01:32.630> to<00:01:32.659> enter<00:01:33.049> a<00:01:33.079> default<00:01:33.530> URL<00:01:33.710> for<00:01:34.250> the<00:01:34.340> text

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
it to enter a default URL for the text

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:43.130

field

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.260 

we'll<00:01:43.680> also<00:01:43.890> set<00:01:44.250> the<00:01:44.400> text<00:01:44.580> field<00:01:44.790> to<00:01:45.000> trigger

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
we'll also set the text field to trigger

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.940 
we'll also set the text field to trigger
actions<00:01:45.810> when<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.110> user<00:01:46.320> hits<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.800> enter<00:01:47.130> key
