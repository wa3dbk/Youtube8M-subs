00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:06.700 
it's not wore out so now we're putting

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.340 
it's not wore out so now we're putting
it<00:01:06.910> all<00:01:07.030> back<00:01:07.210> together<00:01:07.420> we're<00:01:07.930> putting<00:01:08.260> the

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:18.030 
it all back together we're putting the
cush<00:01:08.620> drive<00:01:08.950> back<00:01:09.520> into<00:01:10.030> the<00:01:10.180> wheel<00:01:17.040> we're

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:18.040 
cush drive back into the wheel we're

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.220 
cush drive back into the wheel we're
going<00:01:18.160> to<00:01:18.250> take<00:01:18.460> our<00:01:18.700> worn<00:01:19.060> out<00:01:19.240> sprocket<00:01:20.050> and

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:20.230

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.090 

then<00:01:27.450> we're<00:01:27.570> going<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:27.780> clean<00:01:28.080> up<00:01:28.110> our<00:01:28.470> spacers

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
then we're going to clean up our spacers

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.330 
then we're going to clean up our spacers
before<00:01:29.640> we<00:01:29.760> stick<00:01:30.030> those<00:01:30.240> into<00:01:30.570> the<00:01:30.660> seal

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:34.340 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.800 

we're<00:01:35.340> going<00:01:35.460> to<00:01:35.550> take<00:01:35.700> our<00:01:35.880> axle<00:01:36.450> we're<00:01:36.630> going

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
we're going to take our axle we're going

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.680 
we're going to take our axle we're going
to<00:01:36.870> put<00:01:37.050> a<00:01:37.080> light<00:01:37.470> coat<00:01:37.860> of<00:01:37.890> grease<00:01:38.510> down<00:01:39.510> the

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.690 
to put a light coat of grease down the

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.400 
to put a light coat of grease down the
whole<00:01:39.870> axle<00:01:40.910> this<00:01:41.910> will<00:01:42.180> help<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.630> ax<00:01:43.170> will

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:43.410 
whole axle this will help the ax will

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:45.890 
whole axle this will help the ax will
come<00:01:43.590> out<00:01:43.770> much<00:01:44.610> easier<00:01:44.640> next<00:01:45.390> time<00:01:45.570> when<00:01:45.810> we

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:45.900 
come out much easier next time when we

00:01:45.900 --> 00:02:01.430 
come out much easier next time when we
take<00:01:46.110> it<00:01:46.229> out

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:01.440 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:18.010 

I<00:02:02.300> don't<00:02:03.300> think<00:02:03.450> that's<00:02:03.660> it

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.630 

so<00:02:19.020> we<00:02:19.170> roll<00:02:19.410> the<00:02:19.530> wheel<00:02:19.709> into<00:02:19.920> place<00:02:20.040> and<00:02:20.550> we

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
so we roll the wheel into place and we

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.390 
so we roll the wheel into place and we
lift<00:02:20.850> it<00:02:20.940> up<00:02:21.090> with<00:02:21.300> our<00:02:21.480> foot<00:02:22.250> we're<00:02:23.250> going<00:02:23.280> to

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
lift it up with our foot we're going to

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:33.430 
lift it up with our foot we're going to
hook<00:02:23.640> the<00:02:23.790> chain<00:02:23.819> onto<00:02:24.450> the<00:02:24.840> sprocket

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.550 

and<00:02:33.620> we're<00:02:34.370> going<00:02:34.490> to<00:02:34.550> take<00:02:34.730> our<00:02:34.910> caliper

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
and we're going to take our caliper

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.840 
and we're going to take our caliper
we're<00:02:36.560> going<00:02:36.710> to<00:02:36.770> slide<00:02:37.040> our<00:02:37.070> caliper<00:02:37.520> into

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
we're going to slide our caliper into

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:39.940 
we're going to slide our caliper into
place<00:02:38.090> we<00:02:38.450> need<00:02:38.570> to<00:02:38.630> line<00:02:38.930> that<00:02:39.140> caliper<00:02:39.710> up

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:39.950 
place we need to line that caliper up

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:41.440 
place we need to line that caliper up
with<00:02:40.190> the<00:02:40.310> little<00:02:40.550> bracket<00:02:41.000> that's<00:02:41.150> on<00:02:41.330> the

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
with the little bracket that's on the

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.370 
with the little bracket that's on the
swing<00:02:41.720> arm<00:02:41.960> and<00:02:43.390> get<00:02:44.390> that<00:02:44.630> wheel<00:02:44.840> up<00:02:45.080> in<00:02:45.290> the

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
swing arm and get that wheel up in the

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.790 
swing arm and get that wheel up in the
air<00:02:45.560> and<00:02:45.920> take<00:02:46.310> our<00:02:46.520> axle<00:02:47.150> and<00:02:47.620> we're<00:02:48.620> going<00:02:48.740> to

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:48.800 
air and take our axle and we're going to

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.130 
air and take our axle and we're going to
slide<00:02:49.100> our<00:02:49.280> axle<00:02:49.850> through<00:02:50.150> the<00:02:50.270> swing<00:02:50.600> arm<00:02:50.840> and

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
slide our axle through the swing arm and

00:02:51.140 --> 00:03:15.130 
slide our axle through the swing arm and
then<00:02:51.260> through<00:02:51.530> the<00:02:51.650> wheel<00:03:13.720> so<00:03:14.720> once<00:03:14.930> you<00:03:15.050> get

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:15.140 
then through the wheel so once you get

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.620 
then through the wheel so once you get
that

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
that

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:16.940 
that
so<00:03:15.720> most<00:03:16.020> of<00:03:16.140> the<00:03:16.260> way<00:03:16.380> through<00:03:16.410> the<00:03:16.740> wheel

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
so most of the way through the wheel
