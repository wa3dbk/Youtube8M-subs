00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.260
 only it is not exclusive of Brazil 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.879
 a market animal very beginning right of 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.860
 Central America taking all that 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.520
 Amazon region time to bolivia and 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.579
 Ecuador 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.070

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.750
 bird symbol of our cerrado also in 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.949
 puerto rico is interesting to talk to 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.239
 were introduced by man 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.140
 probably with the pet 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.450
 huh 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.760
 is an animal that I learned to speak well this 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.520
 Beautiful combination is a bug nests are 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.650
 very docile raised in captivity and 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.020
 also because cocoa, not today, has 10 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.939
 years she is born in captivity with 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:22.470
 registration in ibama is microchiped 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:25.130
 here a crime 1981 and 2005 estimates 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.750
 that more than 55,000 macaws were 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.579
 commercialized only the sad staff 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.310
 is that often the trafficking of these 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.329
 even happens to museums and 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:35.159
 collectors 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:38.430
 these animals with pets and 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.860
 worse still having access to the puppies 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:43.140
 Spenders knocked down a tree to 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.210
 take a nest and only harm the 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.189
 harvests harms a number of birds that 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.820
 also used that tree on the spot to 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.260
 reproduction 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.110
 but still 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:54.150
 an animal is threatened with extinction, which 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.660
 does not mean that it can not become a 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:02:00.000
 event you are life and in the background the 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:02.430
 her mate screaming because he 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.680
 Do you want to know where the cocoa is? 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:07.680
 because the macaws canindé as well as 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:10.649
 many other and called curves 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.780
 monogamous animal parrots or 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.850
 they choose a partner and since they 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.080
 they form this partner they go there in the 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.150
 the rest of life 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:19.770
 they practically get married spend the 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.460
 the rest of their lives with a single 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.620
 partner 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:25.260
 this guy here is very important in 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.900
 nature because it has some seeds that 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.420
 several animals on the ground can not 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.550
 open then it will break those 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:39.240
 seeds there yes the bugs can eat 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:40.290
 not ai that's how cute he is 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:42.080
 God 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.790
 are excellent seed dispersers 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.620
 because they eat lots of fruit and 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.020
 The seed passes through their 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.450
 removed that part of it that 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:54.420
 prevents her jermina and know when this 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.280
 bug falls to the ground it is already possible to trace 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:02.459
 It is as it was and looks to the animal 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:06.150
 scale right here in the week just pick up the 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:09.000

 Wanna rip my finger out of him? 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.430
 He started quietly but he is alone. 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:21.840
 joking, you see. 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.390
 that's why it's a great 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.430
 petting like trash is beautiful and always active 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.950
 playful is so unfortunately it is 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.820
 very close to the legal animal trade. 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.800
 these guys 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.900
 they eat several native plants of the 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.010

 clay hills Since then agile in 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:50.790
 To manage this already begins the same 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:52.980
 because it will help eliminate this 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:57.930
 toxic substance 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:04:00.400
 this substance to these substances 

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:05.680
 Are you kidding with me, right?
