00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:49.870
 original sports destinations 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:56.610
 then we walked along the dogs dogs 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:09.230
 decree of communication with 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.590
 beautiful interesting cool captures 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.570
 spirit 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.610
 and most importantly , he is the principle of healthy 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:15.830
 lifestyle about which we broadcast from 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.540
 all the stands as they say in action so 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:19.310
 where is government support where 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.470
 interest of city authorities 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.990
 where is the desire to make this sport massive 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.790
 and safe to student sites from the place 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:26.990
 absolutely no 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:32.690
 sometimes let's say yiddish to practice 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:34.990
 and only there asphalt more and more 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:37.310
 account for missing first sites 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:40.280
 not enough people who long 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:42.350
 engaged because they finish on the 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:46.130
 the same reason that there are no grounds not 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:47.930
 arrange them well do not do the hall on 

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:50.210
 For example, winter is not given in winter because 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:54.380
 all sorts of things stick out of the snow and 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:04:00.020
 many such cases when and some 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:04:01.240
 injuries got killed i got myself

 stuck out and cut my leg 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:10.060
 I would like the government to help 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.520

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:15.640
