00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:09.699 

Vaughn<00:04:03.890> Kaiser<00:04:07.180> and<00:04:08.410> really<00:04:09.410> that's<00:04:09.590> all<00:04:09.680> I

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:09.709 
Vaughn Kaiser and really that's all I

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:11.259 
Vaughn Kaiser and really that's all I
can<00:04:09.830> say<00:04:09.950> about<00:04:10.070> Vaughn<00:04:10.400> Kaiser<00:04:10.700> he<00:04:10.970> hasn't

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:11.269 
can say about Vaughn Kaiser he hasn't

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:13.150 
can say about Vaughn Kaiser he hasn't
really<00:04:11.450> changed<00:04:11.480> that<00:04:12.110> much<00:04:12.290> he's<00:04:12.620> faster

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.160 
really changed that much he's faster

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.949 
really changed that much he's faster
he'll<00:04:13.640> try<00:04:13.910> and<00:04:13.970> fake<00:04:14.209> you<00:04:14.360> out<00:04:14.390> he<00:04:14.810> has<00:04:14.930> a

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 
he'll try and fake you out he has a

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:16.750 
he'll try and fake you out he has a
one-hit<00:04:15.410> knockout<00:04:15.860> move<00:04:16.070> but<00:04:16.340> that's<00:04:16.519> about

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 
one-hit knockout move but that's about

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.849 
one-hit knockout move but that's about
it<00:04:16.970> I<00:04:17.350> think<00:04:18.350> the<00:04:18.680> first<00:04:18.979> time<00:04:19.190> I<00:04:19.250> mentioned

00:04:20.849 --> 00:04:20.859 
it I think the first time I mentioned

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:24.420 
it I think the first time I mentioned
wait<00:04:21.859> I'm<00:04:22.250> gonna<00:04:22.400> knock<00:04:22.550> it<00:04:22.580> out<00:04:22.760> right<00:04:23.000> here<00:04:23.030> I

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:24.430 
wait I'm gonna knock it out right here I

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:27.339 
wait I'm gonna knock it out right here I
think

00:04:27.339 --> 00:04:27.349 
think

00:04:27.349 --> 00:04:31.159 
think
there<00:04:28.349> we<00:04:28.469> go<00:04:28.590> yeah<00:04:29.340> he's<00:04:29.460> done<00:04:29.669> I<00:04:30.169> think

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:31.169 
there we go yeah he's done I think

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:33.260 
there we go yeah he's done I think
during<00:04:31.710> The<00:04:31.919> Contender<00:04:32.219> mode<00:04:32.520> when<00:04:32.789> he<00:04:33.120> had

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
during The Contender mode when he had

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:35.540 
during The Contender mode when he had
that<00:04:33.300> little<00:04:33.689> intermission<00:04:34.310> animation<00:04:35.310> part

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
that little intermission animation part

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:36.619 
that little intermission animation part
where<00:04:35.669> the<00:04:35.759> kids<00:04:35.969> were<00:04:36.090> beating<00:04:36.389> him<00:04:36.419> I<00:04:36.569> think

00:04:36.619 --> 00:04:36.629 
where the kids were beating him I think

00:04:36.629 --> 00:04:37.999 
where the kids were beating him I think
that<00:04:36.810> was<00:04:36.990> actually<00:04:37.259> supposed<00:04:37.409> to<00:04:37.500> be<00:04:37.590> a<00:04:37.650> dream

00:04:37.999 --> 00:04:38.009 
that was actually supposed to be a dream

00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:39.559 
that was actually supposed to be a dream
sequence<00:04:38.310> so<00:04:38.699> I<00:04:38.729> might<00:04:38.939> have<00:04:39.030> gotten<00:04:39.360> that<00:04:39.509> one

00:04:39.559 --> 00:04:39.569 
sequence so I might have gotten that one

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:42.499 
sequence so I might have gotten that one
wrong<00:04:40.430> it<00:04:41.430> would<00:04:41.610> explain<00:04:41.909> why<00:04:42.120> he's<00:04:42.300> like

00:04:42.499 --> 00:04:42.509 
wrong it would explain why he's like

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:44.899 
wrong it would explain why he's like
I'll<00:04:42.689> shake<00:04:43.229> it<00:04:43.379> up<00:04:43.500> and<00:04:43.650> uh-huh<00:04:44.099> like<00:04:44.669> when

00:04:44.899 --> 00:04:44.909 
I'll shake it up and uh-huh like when

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:48.050 
I'll shake it up and uh-huh like when
the<00:04:45.120> match<00:04:45.360> starts<00:04:45.780> but<00:04:45.960> yeah<00:04:46.789> they<00:04:47.789> say

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:49.740 
defending the belt is harder than

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.510 
defending the belt is harder than
