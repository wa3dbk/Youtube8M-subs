to<00:00:55.680> cover<00:00:56.329> look<00:00:57.329> I<00:00:57.450> guess<00:00:57.629> let's<00:00:57.780> just

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
to cover look I guess let's just

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.510 
to cover look I guess let's just
conserve<00:00:58.289> so<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.530> first<00:00:58.710> one<00:00:58.890> is<00:00:58.950> it<00:00:59.219> this<00:00:59.250> is

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
conserve so the first one is it this is

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.069 
conserve so the first one is it this is
I<00:00:59.640> believe<00:00:59.700> the<00:01:00.149> only<00:01:00.239> had<00:01:00.539> said<00:01:00.750> I'll<00:01:00.840> cover

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.410 
I believe the only had said I'll cover
that<00:01:01.230> has<00:01:01.559> an<00:01:01.739> on-ear<00:01:02.399> design<00:01:02.820> now<00:01:03.090> this<00:01:03.270> is

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.690 
that has an on-ear design now this is
one<00:01:04.140> thing<00:01:04.470> like<00:01:04.680> this<00:01:04.799> headset<00:01:05.250> probably<00:01:05.610> the

one thing like this headset probably the
only<00:01:05.909> thing<00:01:06.360> that<00:01:06.540> I<00:01:06.630> don't<00:01:06.690> like<00:01:07.190> basically

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:08.190 
only thing that I don't like basically

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:10.670 
only thing that I don't like basically
on<00:01:08.460> your<00:01:08.700> design<00:01:09.030> as<00:01:09.330> it<00:01:09.570> should<00:01:10.229> tell<00:01:10.530> you

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
on your design as it should tell you

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.340 
on your design as it should tell you
guys<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:11.159> doesn't<00:01:11.549> go<00:01:12.090> around<00:01:12.330> your<00:01:12.930> ear<00:01:13.110> so

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
guys it doesn't go around your ear so

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.350 
guys it doesn't go around your ear so
it's<00:01:13.470> not<00:01:13.619> noise<00:01:13.830> cancelling<00:01:14.549> whatsoever<00:01:15.119> you

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
it's not noise cancelling whatsoever you

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.030 
it's not noise cancelling whatsoever you
can<00:01:15.420> hear<00:01:15.810> everything<00:01:16.200> going<00:01:16.619> on<00:01:16.740> in<00:01:16.770> your

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
can hear everything going on in your

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.910 
can hear everything going on in your
house<00:01:17.360> and<00:01:18.360> it's<00:01:18.570> not<00:01:18.810> as<00:01:18.990> comfortable<00:01:19.350> as<00:01:19.680> the

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
house and it's not as comfortable as the

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.649 
house and it's not as comfortable as the
over<00:01:20.250> as<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.790> over-the-air<00:01:21.180> designed

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
over as the over-the-air designed

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.780 
over as the over-the-air designed
headsets<00:01:22.439> like<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.740> a40<00:01:23.400> you're<00:01:23.490> like<00:01:23.640> the

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
headsets like the a40 you're like the

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.640 
headsets like the a40 you're like the
turtle<00:01:24.030> beaches<00:01:24.570> or<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.810> Triton<00:01:25.260> so<00:01:25.470> that's

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
turtle beaches or the Triton so that's

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.730 
turtle beaches or the Triton so that's
definitely<00:01:26.369> one<00:01:27.000> place<00:01:27.299> where<00:01:27.659> I<00:01:27.990> feel<00:01:28.619> like

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
definitely one place where I feel like

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.789 
definitely one place where I feel like
the<00:01:28.890> a30<00:01:29.310> takes<00:01:29.640> a<00:01:29.820> hit<00:01:30.030> it's<00:01:30.210> comfort<00:01:30.900> because

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
the a30 takes a hit it's comfort because

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.070 
the a30 takes a hit it's comfort because
of<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.280> honor<00:01:32.490> of<00:01:32.640> design<00:01:32.970> I<00:01:33.270> know<00:01:33.810> what<00:01:33.960> they

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080 
of the honor of design I know what they

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.780 
of the honor of design I know what they
were<00:01:34.140> going<00:01:34.470> for<00:01:34.619> because<00:01:35.100> they're<00:01:35.340> going<00:01:35.580> for

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
were going for because they're going for

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.140 
were going for because they're going for
more<00:01:35.939> of<00:01:36.000> a<00:01:36.150> versatile<00:01:36.979> lightweight<00:01:38.150> headset

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
that as I guess we can talk about right

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.270 
that as I guess we can talk about right
now<00:01:42.210> is<00:01:42.509> not<00:01:42.659> just<00:01:42.990> meant<00:01:43.200> for<00:01:43.380> gaming<00:01:43.740> but<00:01:44.220> you

beach x 11 did not have those xbox only

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:40.750 
beach x 11 did not have those xbox only
headset<00:03:38.660> so<00:03:39.200> that<00:03:39.350> allows<00:03:39.680> this<00:03:39.980> headset<00:03:40.430> to

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
headset so that allows this headset to

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.670 
headset so that allows this headset to
for<00:03:41.150> those<00:03:41.240> people<00:03:41.570> with<00:03:41.660> multi<00:03:42.020> or<00:03:42.470> two

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:45.130 
for those people with multi or two
consoles<00:03:43.220> it<00:03:43.820> gives<00:03:44.300> it<00:03:44.390> more<00:03:44.540> use<00:03:44.870> because

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:45.140 
consoles it gives it more use because

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.010 
consoles it gives it more use because
for<00:03:45.470> me<00:03:45.590> I<00:03:45.830> have<00:03:46.190> an<00:03:46.280> xbox<00:03:46.490> in<00:03:46.790> the<00:03:46.850> ps3<00:03:47.090> why

essentially it's going to make me after
by<00:03:52.100> two<00:03:52.160> heads<00:03:52.550> its<00:03:52.760> overall<00:03:53.150> where<00:03:53.750> i<00:03:53.810> can<00:03:53.960> buy

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:53.990 
by two heads its overall where i can buy

by two heads its overall where i can buy
this<00:03:54.110> headset<00:03:54.710> it's<00:03:55.280> maybe<00:03:55.490> twice<00:03:55.760> as<00:03:55.940> much

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
this headset it's maybe twice as much

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.050 
this headset it's maybe twice as much
money<00:03:56.420> but<00:03:57.230> it<00:03:57.620> can<00:03:58.100> work<00:03:58.280> for<00:03:58.340> both<00:03:58.700> or

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
money but it can work for both or

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:00.730 
money but it can work for both or
there's<00:03:59.660> a<00:03:59.750> there's<00:04:00.020> a<00:04:00.080> few<00:04:00.260> other<00:04:00.290> headsets

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:00.740 
there's a there's a few other headsets

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:02.190 
there's a there's a few other headsets
that<00:04:00.890> I'll<00:04:01.040> talk<00:04:01.190> about<00:04:01.250> later<00:04:01.460> that

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 
that I'll talk about later that

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.180 
that I'll talk about later that
specifically<00:04:03.200> for<00:04:03.470> entry<00:04:03.710> level<00:04:03.740> that<00:04:04.130> I

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.190 
specifically for entry level that I

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:05.500 
specifically for entry level that I
think<00:04:04.490> if<00:04:04.640> you<00:04:04.730> have<00:04:04.820> two<00:04:04.970> consoles<00:04:05.420> you

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
think if you have two consoles you

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:06.790 
think if you have two consoles you
should<00:04:05.690> definitely<00:04:05.840> get<00:04:06.140> I'll<00:04:06.590> talk<00:04:06.770> about

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:06.800 
should definitely get I'll talk about

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.400 
should definitely get I'll talk about
those<00:04:06.980> in<00:04:07.160> another<00:04:07.520> video<00:04:07.730> but<00:04:08.660> yeah<00:04:09.200> guys

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:09.410 
those in another video but yeah guys

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:11.980 
those in another video but yeah guys
this<00:04:09.620> had<00:04:09.830> to<00:04:09.860> essentially<00:04:10.580> is<00:04:10.880> it<00:04:11.300> durable<00:04:11.660> I

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:11.990 
this had to essentially is it durable I

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:13.630 
this had to essentially is it durable I
don't<00:04:12.440> really<00:04:12.560> think<00:04:12.680> so<00:04:13.100> it's<00:04:13.280> very<00:04:13.460> very

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:13.640 
don't really think so it's very very

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.700 
don't really think so it's very very
flimsy<00:04:14.180> for<00:04:14.570> those<00:04:14.690> of<00:04:14.840> you<00:04:14.960> have<00:04:15.050> had<00:04:15.260> it<00:04:15.500> it's

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:15.710 
flimsy for those of you have had it it's

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:17.770 
flimsy for those of you have had it it's
i<00:04:16.400> mean<00:04:16.640> that's<00:04:16.910> what<00:04:17.210> they<00:04:17.299> were<00:04:17.359> going<00:04:17.600> for

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
i mean that's what they were going for

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:19.750 
i mean that's what they were going for
yeah<00:04:18.560> it's<00:04:18.739> lightweight<00:04:19.040> but<00:04:19.489> it's<00:04:19.609> also

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
yeah it's lightweight but it's also

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.350 
yeah it's lightweight but it's also
flimsy<00:04:20.390> it's<00:04:20.510> also<00:04:20.660> not<00:04:21.020> very<00:04:21.080> durable

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:23.360 
flimsy it's also not very durable

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:24.580 
flimsy it's also not very durable
I<00:04:23.449> don't<00:04:23.750> know<00:04:23.840> this<00:04:24.020> is<00:04:24.169> one<00:04:24.319> of<00:04:24.349> the<00:04:24.439> least

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:24.590 
I don't know this is one of the least

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:27.219 
I don't know this is one of the least
durable<00:04:24.949> headsets<00:04:25.310> I've<00:04:25.430> ever<00:04:25.580> tried<00:04:26.229> comfort

00:04:27.219 --> 00:04:27.229 
durable headsets I've ever tried comfort

00:04:27.229 --> 00:04:29.830

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
again not great sound quality when

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.749 
again not great sound quality when
you're<00:04:29.960> listening<00:04:30.139> music<00:04:30.439> average<00:04:31.370> when

you're listening music average when

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:33.700

you're listening to gaming you can hear

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:34.869 
you're listening to gaming you can hear
everything<00:04:33.919> around<00:04:34.219> you<00:04:34.460> so<00:04:34.580> it's<00:04:34.699> not<00:04:34.819> that
