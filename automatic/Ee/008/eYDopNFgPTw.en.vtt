00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
 and beautiful boys as usual being 04 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.080
 we're here with a brand new video 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.820
 we are with a really big profit video 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.969
 on the sale 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.280
 I'm really making an absurd profit 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.920
 on this day with only with 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.510
 these two abdennur players look 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.970
 how many and jarvis 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.470
 now I will explain everything to you that is not every 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.160
 accident what is really simple here 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.660
 Trade 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.689
 in the meantime you see that they are me 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.359
 continuing to increase credits 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.130
 we see a 1400 there are none 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.790
 look here i can buy them 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:38.969
 very well at 1200 I made 16 offers 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.460
 look at a two three four five plus 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:45.180
 11 up here 16 offers 11 I won 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.710
 this one has expired now so you understand 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.160
 that you also manage to take 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.350
 quite easily 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.969
 we have a profit if we come 1500 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.100
 the 1,500 fee should be 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:58.559
 about 75 so we have a 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.629
 225 player profit 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.300
 see here that practically I buy 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.610
 I buy and resell immediately if we see each other again 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.320
 really in a flash time 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.330
 then if I do n't put it at 1400 maybe now I will 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.710
 I give it a try it's even worse if it is 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:15.049
 put at 1400 we sell it type 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.909
 let's see how much it should pass 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:18.710
 about ten seconds or so 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:21.409
 I can assure you more 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:26.050
 let's take a look at this experiment in 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:28.220
 live indeed look already bought 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:30.380
 so even if he maybe we buy 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:32.930
 1200 and we remain 1400 there is practically 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.600
 in two minutes we sell ten players e 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.790
 we make an incredible profit I 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.200
 did the same thing with jarvis why 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:41.479
 now you can really make a buy 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.070
 well won well practically ie 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:44.630
 counting all these here 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:47.119
 I really sold today, I'll be done 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.860
 at least 15,000 of 15,000 credits e 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:50.479
 earnings look here how many you look 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.090
 how many how many I've sold and how many 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:54.920
 I really bought a sale 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.990
 absurd I am finding myself really well 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.300
 also because in any case abdennur a delle 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.250
 really great statistics because now 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.679
 I'll show you a 72 speed one 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.990
 86 of physique a 92 of physical strength 80 

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:08.330
 obvious defense but that is not good 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.640
 with very few players I watched 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.660
 sin has expired a buy now a thousand 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.460
 that was really bad 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.690
 and therefore nothing I wanted to tell you 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:18.580
 obviously now the players after 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.410
 this video may not be possible anymore 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.960
 use but there are many around 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.950
 many around even for example of jarvis 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.410
 which is another that I managed to 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.540
 buy very easily but who knows 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.700
 guys how many braithwaite that too 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.320
 of Toulouse and I went out to buy 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.570
 enough there really are around 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:36.460
 so many that you can buy for 200 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:37.480
 300 under the buy now and sell 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.800
 really right away 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.930
 so guys this really one here 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.940
 there is an extraordinary sale 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.070
 really profit the limited because 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.710
 meaning I would still go on abdennur 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:48.910
 watched the 1400 in the meantime and am 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:51.450
 come out a little but don't worry 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:54.910
 because they will expire almost immediately 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.920
 look I make 1200 auctions 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:58.990
 we will be able to take almost all of them 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.270
 look at this can see if the seconds 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:03.070
 all you can take in 1200 is the 

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:05.260
 absurd buying tv I do this 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:09.010
 this offer with 1,200 euros video 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:11.980
 however, 95 per cent ends first 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:14.380
 we buy because that is really one 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.930
 absurd sale try us changed 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:20.220
 player always put a 2 0 2 underneath 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:23.620
 or 300 credits to have at least a 250 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:26.260
 You earn 220 with a player with 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.880
 I have a lot of players reviewing them 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:31.390
 how many players i sold in the 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:33.040
 only today between jarvis abdennur too 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.560
 this player who buckley holes or 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:38.200
 type is located at 200 buy now every 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.000
 300 so much in case it sells immediately 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.110
 therefore there are few on the market 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.120
 very well, however, I recommend you 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:45.740
 speak with the gold players to buy it ie 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.030
 look at how much money you have on 

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:51.520
 these all put them all in 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:53.590
 truth I tell you who this morning I was type a 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:56.260
 twenty thousand created then oh well I did 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:59.650
 two teams I made this one here 

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:01.300
 okay the classic premier more then i am 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:04.830
 made a leigh anne so pretty 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:07.690
 fast na so he had arrived type a 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:09.250
 7000 8000 credits now I remain 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:12.370
 all these at least I think to arrive 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:15.250
 on the 25 thousand so this of nur we are 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:18.209
 to take and wait for these thirty 

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:20.370
 seconds we buy it together 

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:22.199
 and nothing I recommend anyway to 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.940
 change player because after the video 

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:25.319
 they all start trying with these two 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.500
 players there are a lot of 

00:04:25.319 --> 00:04:27.500
 players 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.610
 and so I hope nothing is there 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.850
