but<00:01:11.650> I<00:01:11.680> like<00:01:11.980> fun<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:13.950> I<00:01:14.950> like<00:01:15.160> this<00:01:15.340> game<00:01:15.610> a

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:15.940 
but I like fun and I like this game a

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.440 
but I like fun and I like this game a
lot<00:01:16.690> its<00:01:17.110> fast-paced<00:01:17.530> it's<00:01:18.340> easy<00:01:19.030> to<00:01:19.210> pick<00:01:19.420> up

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
lot its fast-paced it's easy to pick up

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.720 
lot its fast-paced it's easy to pick up
and<00:01:19.750> play<00:01:19.990> yet<00:01:20.290> extremely<00:01:20.770> difficult<00:01:21.250> to

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:21.730 
and play yet extremely difficult to

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:23.730 
and play yet extremely difficult to
master<00:01:22.150> it's<00:01:22.300> got<00:01:22.480> a<00:01:22.510> great<00:01:22.870> risk<00:01:23.170> versus

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
master it's got a great risk versus

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.850 
master it's got a great risk versus
reward<00:01:23.890> scoring<00:01:24.640> system<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:26.200> it<00:01:26.380> reminds<00:01:26.800> me

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
reward scoring system and it reminds me

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.220 
reward scoring system and it reminds me
a<00:01:26.950> lot<00:01:27.160> of<00:01:27.360> asteroids<00:01:28.360> and<00:01:28.690> other<00:01:28.780> games<00:01:29.050> like

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:29.230 
a lot of asteroids and other games like

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:37.820 
a lot of asteroids and other games like
geometry<00:01:29.650> wars<00:01:30.100> games<00:01:30.580> which<00:01:31.360> are<00:01:31.540> also<00:01:31.660> fun

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:37.830 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.770 

so<00:01:38.340> here's<00:01:38.520> what<00:01:38.670> you<00:01:38.700> do<00:01:38.880> you<00:01:39.060> fly<00:01:39.360> around<00:01:39.510> in

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
so here's what you do you fly around in

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.650 
so here's what you do you fly around in
outer<00:01:39.960> space<00:01:40.140> and<00:01:40.560> gather<00:01:41.370> ions<00:01:42.000> or<00:01:42.390> whatever

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:42.660 
outer space and gather ions or whatever

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:44.300 
outer space and gather ions or whatever
those<00:01:42.840> things<00:01:42.870> are<00:01:43.260> by<00:01:43.440> soaking<00:01:43.890> them<00:01:43.980> up<00:01:44.160> with

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
those things are by soaking them up with

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.680 
those things are by soaking them up with
your<00:01:44.430> spaceship<00:01:44.910> and<00:01:45.090> then<00:01:45.210> shooting<00:01:45.480> them

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:45.690 
your spaceship and then shooting them

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.050 
your spaceship and then shooting them
back<00:01:45.870> at<00:01:46.260> asteroids<00:01:46.950> or<00:01:47.190> aliens<00:01:47.670> or<00:01:47.880> end

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
back at asteroids or aliens or end

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.330 
back at asteroids or aliens or end
bosses<00:01:48.600> which<00:01:48.780> then<00:01:49.050> drop<00:01:49.440> points<00:01:49.950> that<00:01:50.160> you

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
bosses which then drop points that you

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.220 
bosses which then drop points that you
collect<00:01:50.790> as<00:01:50.970> quickly<00:01:51.480> as<00:01:51.690> possible<00:01:52.170> to

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:52.230 
collect as quickly as possible to

00:01:52.230 --> 00:02:00.580 
collect as quickly as possible to
increase<00:01:52.650> your<00:01:52.800> multiplier

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.039 

you're<00:02:01.579> not<00:02:01.700> scored<00:02:02.090> until<00:02:02.420> the<00:02:02.509> asteroids

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:03.049 
you're not scored until the asteroids

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:05.740 
you're not scored until the asteroids
where<00:02:03.259> the<00:02:03.350> aliens<00:02:03.740> are<00:02:03.859> totally<00:02:04.750> destroyed

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
where the aliens are totally destroyed

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.080 
where the aliens are totally destroyed
so<00:02:06.229> you<00:02:06.289> can<00:02:06.619> half<00:02:06.890> blow<00:02:07.219> up<00:02:07.340> a<00:02:07.429> bunch<00:02:07.670> of<00:02:07.820> rocks

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
so you can half blow up a bunch of rocks

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:09.580 
so you can half blow up a bunch of rocks
and<00:02:08.390> then<00:02:08.539> finish<00:02:08.899> them<00:02:09.080> all<00:02:09.229> off<00:02:09.410> at<00:02:09.560> once

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
and then finish them all off at once

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.680 
and then finish them all off at once
collecting<00:02:10.369> everything<00:02:10.789> which<00:02:11.090> gives<00:02:11.300> you<00:02:11.510> an

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
collecting everything which gives you an

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.170 
collecting everything which gives you an
enormous<00:02:12.440> point<00:02:12.769> multiplier<00:02:13.280> but<00:02:14.000> that's

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
enormous point multiplier but that's

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.420 
enormous point multiplier but that's
also<00:02:14.390> pretty<00:02:14.870> tricky<00:02:15.379> to<00:02:15.800> do<00:02:16.010> because<00:02:16.190> the

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:16.430 
also pretty tricky to do because the

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:18.070 
also pretty tricky to do because the
more<00:02:16.580> time<00:02:16.819> you<00:02:16.970> spend<00:02:17.000> on<00:02:17.510> a<00:02:17.540> level<00:02:17.750> just

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
more time you spend on a level just

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.589 
more time you spend on a level just
flying<00:02:18.379> around<00:02:18.590> working<00:02:19.250> on<00:02:19.400> the<00:02:20.030> asteroids

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:20.599 
flying around working on the asteroids

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:23.559 
flying around working on the asteroids
themselves<00:02:21.379> the<00:02:21.620> more<00:02:21.980> time<00:02:22.519> the<00:02:22.700> aliens<00:02:23.180> get

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
themselves the more time the aliens get

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:26.170 
themselves the more time the aliens get
to<00:02:23.750> respawn<00:02:24.260> and<00:02:24.650> try<00:02:24.830> to<00:02:24.890> kick<00:02:25.099> your<00:02:25.310> ass<00:02:25.459> so

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
to respawn and try to kick your ass so

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:27.580 
to respawn and try to kick your ass so
like<00:02:26.390> a<00:02:26.420> lot<00:02:26.629> of<00:02:26.660> arcade<00:02:27.019> games<00:02:27.290> you<00:02:27.440> can<00:02:27.560> play

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
like a lot of arcade games you can play

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.410 
like a lot of arcade games you can play
two<00:02:27.769> different<00:02:28.190> ways<00:02:28.370> try<00:02:28.790> to<00:02:28.849> get<00:02:29.090> through<00:02:29.330> it

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
two different ways try to get through it

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:30.970 
two different ways try to get through it
as<00:02:29.510> quickly<00:02:29.540> as<00:02:29.989> possible<00:02:30.049> or<00:02:30.650> hang<00:02:30.860> around

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
as quickly as possible or hang around

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.240 
as quickly as possible or hang around
the<00:02:31.310> level<00:02:32.120> and<00:02:32.269> maximize<00:02:32.989> your<00:02:33.260> points<00:02:33.500> you

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
the level and maximize your points you

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.850 
the level and maximize your points you
get<00:02:34.489> an<00:02:34.610> extra<00:02:34.730> ship<00:02:35.180> every<00:02:35.560> 100,000<00:02:36.560> points

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
get an extra ship every 100,000 points

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:38.949 
get an extra ship every 100,000 points
and<00:02:37.220> you'll<00:02:37.610> you'll<00:02:37.910> want<00:02:38.150> some<00:02:38.360> extra<00:02:38.599> ships

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959
