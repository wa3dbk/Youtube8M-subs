00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
really want is an external monitor such

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.210 
really want is an external monitor such
as<00:00:18.449> this<00:00:18.600> one<00:00:18.810> or<00:00:18.990> this<00:00:19.380> one<00:00:19.439> if<00:00:19.949> you<00:00:20.039> want<00:00:20.160> to

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
as this one or this one if you want to

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.529 
as this one or this one if you want to
go<00:00:20.279> this<00:00:20.400> route<00:00:20.609> you<00:00:20.760> can<00:00:20.880> get<00:00:21.060> something<00:00:21.270> from

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
go this route you can get something from

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.290 
go this route you can get something from
AAA<00:00:21.990> like<00:00:22.260> Kona<00:00:22.619> and<00:00:22.920> you<00:00:23.189> can<00:00:23.340> go<00:00:23.460> SDI<00:00:23.910> into

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
AAA like Kona and you can go SDI into

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.320 
AAA like Kona and you can go SDI into
this<00:00:24.390> beautiful<00:00:24.720> broadcast<00:00:25.320> quality<00:00:25.650> monitor

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:29.330 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.089 

so<00:00:30.330> here<00:00:30.480> we<00:00:30.630> have<00:00:30.779> a<00:00:30.810> cable<00:00:31.199> which<00:00:31.289> carries<00:00:31.619> HD

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
so here we have a cable which carries HD

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.660 
so here we have a cable which carries HD
SDI<00:00:32.399> it's<00:00:33.180> a<00:00:33.480> BNC<00:00:33.870> little<00:00:34.620> locking<00:00:35.130> connector

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
SDI it's a BNC little locking connector

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.119 
SDI it's a BNC little locking connector
and<00:00:35.880> this<00:00:36.480> carries<00:00:36.809> both<00:00:37.079> audio<00:00:37.590> and<00:00:37.680> video

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
and this carries both audio and video

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.639 
and this carries both audio and video
over<00:00:38.340> one<00:00:38.910> cable<00:00:39.320> things<00:00:40.320> are<00:00:40.410> going<00:00:40.530> to<00:00:40.590> be

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
over one cable things are going to be

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:41.810 
over one cable things are going to be
spending<00:00:40.860> about<00:00:40.980> three<00:00:41.309> grand<00:00:41.430> for<00:00:41.760> the

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
spending about three grand for the

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.090 
spending about three grand for the
monitor<00:00:42.149> about<00:00:42.570> two<00:00:42.780> grand<00:00:42.989> for<00:00:43.200> the<00:00:43.260> card<00:00:43.500> so

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
monitor about two grand for the card so

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.830 
monitor about two grand for the card so
if<00:00:44.190> you<00:00:44.280> want<00:00:44.520> to<00:00:44.850> spend<00:00:45.360> less<00:00:45.480> than<00:00:45.660> five

thousand dollars I suggest getting this

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:48.740 
thousand dollars I suggest getting this
one<00:00:47.550> here<00:00:47.700> this<00:00:47.850> is<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.120> Blackmagic

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
one here this is the Blackmagic

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.569 
one here this is the Blackmagic
intensity<00:00:49.140> Pro<00:00:49.469> it<00:00:49.920> can<00:00:50.129> hook<00:00:50.250> up<00:00:50.399> via

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
intensity Pro it can hook up via

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.610 
intensity Pro it can hook up via
component<00:00:51.059> cables<00:00:51.390> via<00:00:51.750> this<00:00:51.870> breakout<00:00:52.230> cable

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
component cables via this breakout cable

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:59.959 
component cables via this breakout cable
or<00:00:52.980> it<00:00:53.550> can<00:00:53.670> hook<00:00:53.789> up<00:00:53.910> via<00:00:54.059> HDMI<00:00:58.820> alright<00:00:59.820> we're

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
or it can hook up via HDMI alright we're

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.119 
or it can hook up via HDMI alright we're
looking<00:01:00.000> at<00:01:00.329> the<00:01:00.420> back<00:01:00.629> of<00:01:00.660> a<00:01:00.960> consumer<00:01:01.530> LCD

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
looking at the back of a consumer LCD

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.060 
looking at the back of a consumer LCD
HDTV<00:01:03.000> and<00:01:03.270> so<00:01:03.989> this<00:01:04.140> is<00:01:04.290> an<00:01:04.439> expense<00:01:04.799> monitor

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
HDTV and so this is an expense monitor

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.609 
HDTV and so this is an expense monitor
that<00:01:05.129> you<00:01:05.250> could<00:01:05.369> pick<00:01:05.700> up<00:01:05.850> locally<00:01:06.299> and<00:01:06.619> what

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
that you could pick up locally and what

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:08.840 
that you could pick up locally and what
you'll<00:01:07.799> notice<00:01:07.830> on<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.189> back<00:01:08.340> of<00:01:08.490> this<00:01:08.580> one<00:01:08.729> is

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
you'll notice on the back of this one is

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.609 
you'll notice on the back of this one is
that<00:01:08.880> it<00:01:09.060> does<00:01:09.180> have<00:01:09.360> HDMI<00:01:09.540> so<00:01:10.200> we're<00:01:10.320> using

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
that it does have HDMI so we're using

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.830 
that it does have HDMI so we're using
the<00:01:10.830> HDMI<00:01:10.979> cable<00:01:11.430> out<00:01:12.000> of<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.270> back<00:01:12.510> of<00:01:12.540> our

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
the HDMI cable out of the back of our

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.899 
the HDMI cable out of the back of our
intensity<00:01:13.290> Pro<00:01:13.590> and<00:01:13.830> we<00:01:14.189> can<00:01:14.340> plug<00:01:14.549> it<00:01:14.700> right

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
intensity Pro and we can plug it right

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.200 
intensity Pro and we can plug it right
and<00:01:15.330> this<00:01:15.960> is<00:01:16.080> carrying<00:01:16.380> both<00:01:17.150> audio<00:01:18.150> and

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
and this is carrying both audio and

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.899 
and this is carrying both audio and
video<00:01:18.780> over<00:01:19.170> one<00:01:19.590> cable<00:01:20.070> and<00:01:20.369> it's<00:01:20.549> digital

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
video over one cable and it's digital

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.600 
video over one cable and it's digital
you<00:01:21.150> know<00:01:21.869> if<00:01:21.990> you<00:01:22.140> got<00:01:22.290> an<00:01:22.439> LCD<00:01:22.799> monitor<00:01:22.920> that

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
you know if you got an LCD monitor that

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.039 
you know if you got an LCD monitor that
was<00:01:23.700> a<00:01:23.729> little<00:01:23.909> bit<00:01:24.030> older<00:01:24.150> or<00:01:24.299> maybe<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.600> plasma

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
was a little bit older or maybe a plasma

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.590 
was a little bit older or maybe a plasma
display<00:01:25.380> you<00:01:25.770> may<00:01:25.890> not<00:01:26.070> have<00:01:26.250> HDMI<00:01:26.880> in<00:01:27.119> that

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
display you may not have HDMI in that

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.560 
display you may not have HDMI in that
case<00:01:27.840> you<00:01:27.990> can<00:01:28.140> use<00:01:28.170> the<00:01:28.380> intensity<00:01:28.860> pros

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
case you can use the intensity pros

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.149 
case you can use the intensity pros
component<00:01:30.570> cables<00:01:31.200> so<00:01:31.560> you<00:01:31.619> get<00:01:31.770> a<00:01:31.799> breakout

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
component cables so you get a breakout

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.700 
component cables so you get a breakout
cable<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:32.670> you'd<00:01:33.390> feed<00:01:33.659> your<00:01:33.900> video<00:01:34.200> here<00:01:34.530> and

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
cable and you'd feed your video here and

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.620 
cable and you'd feed your video here and
your<00:01:35.159> audio<00:01:35.520> here<00:01:35.820> so<00:01:36.060> you've<00:01:36.210> got<00:01:36.420> five

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
your audio here so you've got five

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.539 
your audio here so you've got five
cables<00:01:37.200> and<00:01:37.680> you<00:01:37.829> would<00:01:37.920> have<00:01:38.040> to<00:01:38.159> plug<00:01:38.369> in

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
cables and you would have to plug in

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.429 
cables and you would have to plug in
rather<00:01:39.119> than<00:01:39.240> just<00:01:39.570> one<00:01:39.780> but<00:01:40.049> you<00:01:40.140> can<00:01:40.259> still

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
rather than just one but you can still

gonna be 1366 by 768
most<00:02:14.070> likely<00:02:14.370> and<00:02:14.700> you're<00:02:15.210> not<00:02:15.330> going<00:02:15.480> to<00:02:15.540> be

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
most likely and you're not going to be

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.150 
most likely and you're not going to be
getting<00:02:15.720> the<00:02:15.930> full<00:02:16.140> resolution<00:02:16.350> that<00:02:16.890> you

getting the full resolution that you

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.710 
getting the full resolution that you
would<00:02:17.610> be<00:02:17.730> getting<00:02:18.000> on<00:02:18.210> a<00:02:18.240> more<00:02:18.480> expensive

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
would be getting on a more expensive

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.500 
would be getting on a more expensive
monitor<00:02:19.200> so<00:02:19.680> 1080p<00:02:20.490> is<00:02:20.760> going<00:02:21.120> to<00:02:21.240> be<00:02:21.330> better

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
monitor so 1080p is going to be better

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.300 
monitor so 1080p is going to be better
