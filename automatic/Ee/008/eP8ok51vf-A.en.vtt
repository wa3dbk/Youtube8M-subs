00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
use materials that are connected with

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.620 
use materials that are connected with

some unknown future project waiting for

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.060 
some unknown future project waiting for
the<00:02:12.820> project<00:02:13.390> itself<00:02:13.810> to<00:02:14.170> reveal<00:02:14.470> itself<00:02:14.800> in

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
the project itself to reveal itself in
