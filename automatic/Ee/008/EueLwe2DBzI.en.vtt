00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.420
 pallets 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:48.220
 materials pallet sticks that I

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:53.050
 hello today we are going to make these cute 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.940
 pencils that can be used as 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.879
 bookmark 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:01.329
 let's use a pallet stick 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:05.370
 big and then we're going to trim the point 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:08.730
 of this to form the tip of the pencil 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:12.510
 let's use an ocher marker and or 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:15.420
 of black color and we are going to form the tip 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.300
 of the pencil at home if they wish 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.940
 can use different types of 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:23.370
 colors for the tip as well as 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:26.220
 for the body of our lips 

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:28.350
 I'm going to use a yellow color but 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:32.070
 if they wish they can use blue 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:34.320
 red green and so on once we have 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.840
 stuffed the pencil body then 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.360
 we will form the draft and for the 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.350
 eraser let's take one I believed the ocher 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.350
 jean pink 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:48.280
 for the band that goes between the draft and 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:51.820
 the body of the pencil we are going to use a 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:55.120
 Silver color if you do not have this color 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:57.190
 Silver can use gray or black or 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.950
 You can also use nail polish 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:02.530
 of silver color or can also 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:06.660
 use aluminum foil that can be 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.660
 stuck to the top of the pencil 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.780
 and here is the pencil finished 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.880
 the pencil can be used as 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:18.330
