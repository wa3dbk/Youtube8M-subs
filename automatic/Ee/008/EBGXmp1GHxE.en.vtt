00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.420
 pink 

00:00:10.239 --> 00:00:11.209
 we'll see 

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:14.209
 on how we can touch more pictures 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:17.269
 if two of these levels are used 

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:20.849
 what have we decided that we are not, since it is 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:23.689
 let's say for another a slightly dark shape 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:25.130
 it's a little scura peru 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:26.630
 at the bottom of it 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.380
 It has some values 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.760
 of reasonable light that brings us the image following the and in idle by the 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.200
 game that we have left 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.400
 in the sky 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.920
 towards the values ​​of the background what happens is that it has some dominant 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:39.830
 determined 

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:40.789
 i 

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:43.330
 Maybe they are not the right ones 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:47.820
 we can do what this has the dominants that we have defined 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:48.900
 they will be inside 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.120
 but will be entered with Cuba the determined 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.249
 that we have given them in advance 

00:00:54.249 --> 00:00:57.249
 with that you red dots yellow dots 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.630
 we want you 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:02.920
 let's go to 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.479
 so that it is seen let's do it 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:05.820
 through 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:06.980
 of the computer 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:08.140
 we are going to 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.770
 open the normal levels of automatic if there would be automatic 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.240
 here is as much as the automatic levels as you see the image 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.259
 the tones 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.469
 antiago colder but is if you look at him in the box 

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:23.040
 computer and arranged here 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.150
 yes i made 63 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.010
 the red 59 and the blue 64 that the correction 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:32.240
 that dialogue later 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.590
 percent and with our options we will see if this is true as we have 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.790
 a cut in black and white 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.329
 although we do not analyze now 

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:44.890
 but the important thing is that we see that it is true that she corrected the red 132 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:45.729
 and the blue 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:50.759
 in 122 that this color seems to us little that is a bit poor in color it is 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.850
 we comment is this what we want we say that if we are going to go 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.430
 let's see the cut in black let's start 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.259
 we put 0 and evidently the photograph remains 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.660
 excessively Swiss - they have 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:06.880
 little money we're going to give him back the fifth 10 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:11.449
 we're even going to try to improve 120 bs let's test if 130 improves 

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:13.949
 etc the values ​​of black 

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:15.809
 that we had before and after 

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:17.360
 I feel this 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.059
 in the room of 13 955 it's a pretty reasonable black value 

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:24.399
 percent you can is amazing 

00:02:24.399 --> 00:02:28.729
 maybe it would be better to leave him on the bench that will be closer to 

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:30.130
 the 18 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.140
 percent although red specifically and that way we could print a 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.709
 little bit of tomás and that is let's go down 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:38.960
 a little bit instead of 0 30 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:39.799
 let's give it 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:44.419
 at 0 20 by demos to look here to see if the values ​​still work 

00:02:44.419 --> 00:02:47.419
 basically the situation I was in because it seems more reasonable 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:52.119
 the white values ​​that we have on hand with giving the maximum 

00:02:52.119 --> 00:02:56.669
 250 teachers where four are values ​​in which there is not yet a minimum detail 

00:02:57.849 --> 00:02:59.319
 we mean 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:02.779
 let's tell you that if we are going to compare the preview this is what 

00:03:02.779 --> 00:03:03.599
 I enter 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:05.869
 this is what we have done 

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:08.259
 the law estimated is yes 

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:11.289
 we do not want backward to the new colors 

00:03:11.289 --> 00:03:12.430
 this little town 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.239
 well that bothers you when you do it three hundred times worse 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:16.269
 this picture 

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:17.919
 is corrected 

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:20.479
 in an instant we are going to make a faster correction of another 

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:21.619
 Photography 

00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:23.230
 this photograph earth 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.159
 the yellow tones 

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:26.829
 and that in principle good 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:29.669
 there is a small disproportion as seen on the screen 

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:33.520
 between the red and the other colors is this image of me 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.629
 yellowish red but maybe it's too much 

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:37.349
 we are going to acquire 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:38.439
 the levels 

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:42.389
 let's give them automatic let's say that he really the image 

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:46.239
 agencies a little bit we see what was before sure that after but 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:47.619
 has practically not touched 

00:03:47.619 --> 00:03:49.509
 percent and that maybe 

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:50.540
 the father 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.690
 Because it's so white, maybe we're not a little bit more 

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:58.359
 within its values ​​we give a little more color is this what 

00:03:58.359 --> 00:03:59.829
 we want is perfect 

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:02.589
 we say yes we say yes we say yes 

00:04:02.589 --> 00:04:04.889
 I will not see the new color values 

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:06.529
 and we already have the photograph 

00:04:06.529 --> 00:04:08.039
 p as he wanted 

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:10.829
 We are gonna give 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:13.829
 some more image 

00:04:16.379 --> 00:04:17.370
 does not join 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:18.979
 but he is 

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:22.379
 let's raise the tone 

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:25.520
 Is this what we want 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:27.689
 retouched image 

00:04:27.689 --> 00:04:29.499
 a car one last 

00:04:29.499 --> 00:04:30.999
 of weights 

00:04:30.999 --> 00:04:33.529
 let's see this stubbornness 

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:37.319
 redo the same thing as the levels I usually use the keyboard for it 

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:38.759
 we give it automatism 

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:42.469
 it seems that we are going cold not really less soft enough authorized by 

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:45.080
 cent is just what you need is a little more color 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.740
 this little color 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.150
 we have it 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:50.460
 we say yes 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:52.110
 to all this 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.349
 except wait for the target muscles and let's see what we had 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.430
 and what we have 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:01.009
 we had 

00:05:01.009 --> 00:05:02.930
 what 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:04.780
 at the time of making it 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:05.800
 it seems to us 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.449
 we should have increased it a little bit the white goal levels is very 

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:12.720
 easy today to go back to hobbes levels we do and we start again 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:17.370
 giving a little more clipping to the white of 0 10 postiza 0 20 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:21.860
 spokesmen 15 contests the values ​​of eduardo in this area that the many 

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:26.210
 other 41 252 I the truth is that they do not solve it butler 

00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:29.440
 we have corrected a photo in 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:31.340
 both will act on the court
