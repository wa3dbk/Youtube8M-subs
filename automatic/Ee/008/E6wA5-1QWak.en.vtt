00:00:00.849 --> 00:00:03.460
 but the final dollar did not end 

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:04.460
 Here we go 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.460
 We are now going to enjoy Brussels and Ukraine 

00:00:08.329 --> 00:00:11.329
 this year youtube made 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.650
 the cyber leading the way 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:22.400
 karin the big book standing very much on jump techniques that are the 64 sp.a. 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.130
 preferred viewer group somersaults on the bar 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:26.880
 it won't screw it anyway 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.229
 unbelievable 

00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:33.229
 so also pretty it is a blemish blemish on the train 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.520
 and here again in dessel sport and game will stop with a half turn 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.420
 spreading on a campsite is then important 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.280
 keep moving constantly 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.720
 keep your head up 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.380
 we have our equilibrium system based on that human right go 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.640
 to keep the head upright so don't look the head straight up and down 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.610
 the plans 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:05.550
 so yes 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.990
 keep visual contact with the ipad 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.970
 and if showing mouth is shot next to the balls you have to do that completely 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.050
 I hang seng let go 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:17.000
 only 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 the world smaller fun hey this feeds your level up 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.360
 without a trace 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.360
 sideways somersault 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:30.650
 the food feels the bar with the left foot shows them at the end has five 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.650
 weeks ahead at the place of 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.240
 indulge 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.980
 la s 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:42.610
 let 2 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.790
 and then yes then it works 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.900
 maybe jumped a little higher than normal because this is a club 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.990
 the disastrous in a World Cup final 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.480
 a fall is a full point deduction 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:57.790
 how could it happen after the night lasts an hour with 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.830
 your body's center of gravity of the day 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:01.490
 are you going to run very fast 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.340
 but if you criticize it is no longer save 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.340
 start looking hello on this 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.869
 and it was me 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:12.869
 the tip of the top to say you look this time 

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:16.789
 it was on the tip of the tongue to say it and we love it until now 

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:20.089
 toe is very high final I have not seen a single big mistake 

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:26.149
 in libya that was like feet 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:33.650
 and watch the landing here look the bocholtse is high enough paint higher 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.650
 bin look she remains a hanging group had to open a body 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:41.599
 we can easily say this to get rid of the bank there position you 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:42.919
 just have to do it yourself 

00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:44.609
 and this is the result 

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:47.679
 the world collapsed 

00:02:47.679 --> 00:02:50.869
 you have worked together there for years 

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:53.749
 it just did not succeed in telling us yes those are the 

00:02:53.749 --> 00:02:55.849
 disappointments from a top athlete 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:57.919
 and you have to learn to live with that 

00:02:57.919 --> 00:03:01.169
 and if your date wins then you need a real one 

00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:04.139
 a real sport it is also a really nothing 

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:07.139
 can handle disappointments 

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:12.609
 the american girl would be nice and relaxed with them at the moment 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:15.650
 in second to first to third place 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:19.260
 left bronze that would be the first time 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.260
 Moreover 

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:29.529
 and that he brought on television 

00:03:29.529 --> 00:03:32.059
 the jury consisting of a peak per tonne 

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:36.409
 of two people who dare to determine this score and that they do is also wrong 

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:39.299
 each other that must be completely simultaneous and 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:42.890
 they have to choose with each other for a little while now six points but we see the 

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:45.889
 many years more than the club will certainly be able to 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:50.769
 it eventually became 7 33 

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:53.559
 in the statistics 

00:03:53.559 --> 00:03:55.019
 our editors 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:59.329
 the american tax authorities in the picture first mitchell the australian second 

00:03:59.329 --> 00:04:00.629
 and lower the mill on the right
