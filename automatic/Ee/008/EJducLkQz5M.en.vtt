00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:30.910

have definitely not been in the ground
for<00:00:31.030> year<00:00:31.330> as<00:00:31.510> a<00:00:31.540> matter<00:00:31.780> of<00:00:31.870> fact<00:00:31.960> I've<00:00:32.230> been

00:00:32.339 --> 00:00:32.349 
for year as a matter of fact I've been

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:33.779 
for year as a matter of fact I've been
in<00:00:32.439> the<00:00:32.500> ground<00:00:32.679> for<00:00:32.859> about<00:00:33.070> four<00:00:33.339> months<00:00:33.550> or

00:00:33.779 --> 00:00:33.789 
in the ground for about four months or

00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:36.029 
in the ground for about four months or
so<00:00:34.000> but<00:00:34.390> these<00:00:34.929> tomatoes<00:00:35.379> have<00:00:35.620> a<00:00:35.649> little<00:00:35.920> bit

00:00:36.029 --> 00:00:36.039 
so but these tomatoes have a little bit

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:37.680 
so but these tomatoes have a little bit
more<00:00:36.309> of<00:00:36.460> a<00:00:36.550> story<00:00:36.760> than<00:00:37.120> you<00:00:37.480> might<00:00:37.660> think

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:37.690 
more of a story than you might think

00:00:37.690 --> 00:01:07.250 
more of a story than you might think
you'll<00:00:38.379> see<00:00:38.559> what<00:00:38.679> I<00:00:38.710> mean

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.950 

the<00:01:08.260> first<00:01:08.560> time<00:01:08.860> I<00:01:09.280> heard<00:01:09.640> the<00:01:09.970> term<00:01:10.240> heirloom

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
the first time I heard the term heirloom

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.130 
the first time I heard the term heirloom
tomato<00:01:11.320> I<00:01:11.619> was<00:01:12.130> intrigued<00:01:12.549> the<00:01:13.270> first<00:01:13.600> time<00:01:13.840> I

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
tomato I was intrigued the first time I

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.010 
tomato I was intrigued the first time I
tasted<00:01:14.500> an<00:01:14.830> heirloom<00:01:15.100> tomato<00:01:15.490> I<00:01:15.790> was<00:01:16.420> sold<00:01:16.659> it

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
tasted an heirloom tomato I was sold it

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.170 
tasted an heirloom tomato I was sold it
was<00:01:17.200> the<00:01:17.320> most<00:01:17.350> delicious<00:01:17.860> tomato<00:01:18.460> I<00:01:18.790> had<00:01:19.030> ever

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:19.180 
was the most delicious tomato I had ever

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.389 
was the most delicious tomato I had ever
tasted<00:01:19.420> but<00:01:20.350> there<00:01:20.650> was<00:01:20.680> a<00:01:20.770> question<00:01:21.009> after

00:01:21.389 --> 00:01:21.399 
tasted but there was a question after

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:24.630 
tasted but there was a question after
that<00:01:22.080> exactly<00:01:23.080> what<00:01:23.200> makes<00:01:23.800> the<00:01:23.950> tomato<00:01:24.310> in

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:24.640 
that exactly what makes the tomato in

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:34.780 
that exactly what makes the tomato in
heirloom

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:34.790 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.690 

it<00:01:35.390> may<00:01:35.570> seem<00:01:35.630> odd<00:01:36.110> to<00:01:36.470> use<00:01:36.740> the<00:01:36.920> word<00:01:37.100> heirloom

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
it may seem odd to use the word heirloom

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.790 
it may seem odd to use the word heirloom
when<00:01:37.910> it<00:01:38.000> comes<00:01:38.150> to<00:01:38.300> describing<00:01:38.540> a<00:01:38.840> plant<00:01:39.140> but

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:39.800 
when it comes to describing a plant but

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.770 
when it comes to describing a plant but
in<00:01:39.980> the<00:01:40.160> case<00:01:40.370> of<00:01:40.400> heirloom<00:01:40.940> tomatoes<00:01:41.450> and<00:01:41.660> all

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
in the case of heirloom tomatoes and all

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.750 
in the case of heirloom tomatoes and all
heirloom<00:01:42.200> vegetables<00:01:42.770> it's<00:01:43.010> actually<00:01:43.520> pretty

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:43.760 
heirloom vegetables it's actually pretty

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.270 
heirloom vegetables it's actually pretty
accurate<00:01:44.060> it<00:01:44.600> means<00:01:45.050> these<00:01:45.380> plants<00:01:46.010> have<00:01:46.130> been

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
accurate it means these plants have been

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.250 
accurate it means these plants have been
handed<00:01:46.760> down<00:01:46.970> from<00:01:47.360> generation<00:01:47.450> to

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:48.260 
handed down from generation to

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:50.830 
handed down from generation to
generation<00:01:48.670> by<00:01:49.670> growers<00:01:50.060> who<00:01:50.480> have<00:01:50.570> saved

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
generation by growers who have saved

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.780 
generation by growers who have saved
seeds<00:01:51.230> from<00:01:51.530> each<00:01:51.740> year's<00:01:51.980> plants<00:01:52.550> and<00:01:52.700> then

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
seeds from each year's plants and then

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.090 
seeds from each year's plants and then
grown<00:01:53.090> them<00:01:53.360> the<00:01:53.480> next<00:01:53.660> year<00:01:53.990> so<00:01:54.470> literally

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
grown them the next year so literally

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.010 
grown them the next year so literally
these<00:01:55.580> same<00:01:55.880> tomato<00:01:56.330> plants<00:01:56.870> have<00:01:56.990> been

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
these same tomato plants have been

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.560 
these same tomato plants have been
growing<00:01:57.530> for<00:01:57.560> the<00:01:57.830> last<00:01:58.040> 50<00:01:58.970> or<00:01:59.180> even<00:01:59.479> a

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
growing for the last 50 or even a

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:08.680 
growing for the last 50 or even a
hundred<00:01:59.810> years

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.540 

so<00:02:09.690> if<00:02:09.810> heirloom<00:02:10.140> tomatoes<00:02:10.590> are<00:02:10.860> so<00:02:11.160> delicious

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
so if heirloom tomatoes are so delicious

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.340 
so if heirloom tomatoes are so delicious
why<00:02:12.090> don't<00:02:12.300> we<00:02:12.420> see<00:02:12.630> more<00:02:12.660> of<00:02:12.930> them<00:02:13.140> it's<00:02:13.290> a

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
why don't we see more of them it's a

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.110 
why don't we see more of them it's a
store<00:02:13.620> well<00:02:13.950> it's<00:02:14.070> because<00:02:14.220> of<00:02:14.460> the<00:02:14.580> science

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
store well it's because of the science

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.380 
store well it's because of the science
