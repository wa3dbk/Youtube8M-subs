00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:08.550
 if you think that the company zalman produces only cooling for computers 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.410
 then you are deeply mistaken they have a whole series of game devices and today I 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:34.500
 I'll tell you about 4 and chapters and chapters if you think what zalman company is doing 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.040
 only cooling for computers you are deeply mistaken 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.230
 they have a whole series of gaming devices and today I will tell you about 4 gaming 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.579
 keyboard from the company zalman start with the most simple and smoothly 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.020
 we will move on to the most sophisticated 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.449
 So I liked the model 200 from the first 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:08.060
 I really like the keyboard where the minimum is superfluous is thin light 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.420
 compact and besides it has extra keys 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.770
 and mom is a great option for those who do not like hefty keys with a huge 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.450
 by the number of additional buttons, by the way, they are not so few 10 pieces here 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.289
 nothing supernatural only useful things like a calculator 

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:29.360
 control of the tracks and sound of the button my computer email client and the act of rigondo 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.490
 The principle of the keyboard is not even gaming but multimedia gaming nothing in it 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.929
 no except for one chip included there are 6 keys that can 

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:45.319
 put instead of the standard of course this is wsd and arrows + replacement tool 

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:51.470
 he works like this the way the clave becomes even prettier and already has 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.880
 gaming color work and play on it is convenient due to the size of the buttons they 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.549
 larger rather they are standard but square 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:03.709
 finger touch is big and it is very comfortable left shift big this 

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:08.780
 pleases the buttons the remaining words are matte and do not get dirty in general, I really like 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.220
 I did not like the fact that the cord is very short for some, it may simply not 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.660
 get to the company but this is probably the only drawback 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:22.370
 the next model is ca-300 it is bigger and not matte and glossy 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:28.790
 and even though I love the gloss but here it is real dirty instantly wipe 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.800
 does not wipe fluorine factors by me but if you do not look at the gloss who design 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.379
 cool i really like a small palm rest glowing logo 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:42.349
 extra keys compared to their previous model 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:46.879
 it is more now ig20 sound control the same calculator my 

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:50.690
 computer and so on added browser control and as for me not 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:55.340
 very necessary buttons like slip power and so on for changing buttons 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.819
 there is also a replacement tool and the blue keys along with the blue logo 

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:03.980
 it looks cool all the same as a couple of small strokes can greatly revive 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:09.709
 the design looks really cool the wire has become thicker but unfortunately no longer 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:14.240
 all the same meter and a half keys are pressed a little more than 200 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:19.100
 the models are longer and I like it more like the size and cover of the buttons 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:24.410
 have not changed so work and play very conveniently further modelka 350 her 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:29.209
 made smaller than 300 left a small place under the palm 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:33.800
 logo and extra keys look very interesting 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.330
 The surface is matte. The prints and dirt of the button do not remain on it. 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:43.099
 on previous models, the keystroke is easy and quiet, the key is short to strike 2 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:47.470
 grooves for the thumbs are cool fingers are usually there and go 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.709
 Additional eight buttons are standard sound control buttons. 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:54.770
 button my computer browser calculator and email client 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:04:01.910
 Well, finally, the last model to the 400 is already a full gaming keyboard about 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:06.140
 This says a lot but everything in order so in this model they added 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:11.360
 the backlight, moreover, it can be blue red or completely off from the top 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.030
 A knob that can adjust the backlight brightness 

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:17.150
 next to it is the button oringi which turns on muzlo 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.109
 i.e. the backlight color changes backlight is dull even at maximum brightness 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:25.849
 but it is actually not bad at night from her eyes do not get tired and the characters can be seen 

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:30.229
 perfectly extra keys 14 m button 

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:33.750
 switches you to 1 3 g profiles buttons you can 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.830
 to program on anything there are sound control buttons and a button 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:42.720
 turning on the keys in the windows space with cool grooves for thumbs 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.800
 like the 350 to the k is cool but here's what the bottom row 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:51.360
 buttons raised so that the brush did not get tired just did not like it very much 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.590
 inconvenient to type text and play have to get used to be honest in 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.340
 Unlike previous models, the assembly did not really like it and this is me 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.720
 surprised some keys are at different heights and the school responds immediately 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:07.470
 that this is of course not very good for a gaming keyboard and perhaps this is the most 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:11.909
 The big disadvantage of this model is very strange considering that in the past 

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:16.440
 models, I did not notice this and something else that did not like these glossy 

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:20.580
 inserts get dirty very quickly maybe I already find fault because it looks 

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:25.199
 cool but it would be better to do everything dull but the cable pleased though that 

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:29.479
 the length has not changed now it is in fabric braid so it will serve us longer 

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:35.190
 Well, the last owl here is that it is simple and intuitive to program 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:40.409
 keys as you want expose the polling frequency from 125 to 1000 hertz create 

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:45.719
 macros and save profiles in general everything is just like in a regular gaming keyboard only 

00:05:45.719 --> 00:05:49.650
 socially download software yours is in a set disk and there is no summarizing 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:55.139
 the keyboard I liked they are not without flaws special bush 300 model but 

00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:59.340
 to demand a lot from them I would not even look at the price of my 

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:03.180
 a look is a great budget option for people not aspiring. 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:08.550
 unnecessary frills here everything is just compact and with an interesting design for my 

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:12.659
 look very nice keyboard on it all with you was an online store
