land that you're working with and it's a

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.770 
land that you're working with and it's a
way<00:00:35.290> to<00:00:35.320> to<00:00:36.250> grow<00:00:36.490> vegetables<00:00:36.790> in<00:00:37.300> a<00:00:37.420> very

way to to grow vegetables in a very
sustainable<00:00:38.230> manner<00:00:38.560> and<00:00:38.860> we<00:00:39.070> decided<00:00:39.640> that

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:39.670 
sustainable manner and we decided that

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.840 
sustainable manner and we decided that
we<00:00:40.560> after<00:00:41.560> a<00:00:41.590> long<00:00:41.830> time<00:00:42.010> in<00:00:42.160> Japan<00:00:42.430> we<00:00:42.580> wanted

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:42.850 
we after a long time in Japan we wanted

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:44.550 
we after a long time in Japan we wanted
to<00:00:43.030> sort<00:00:43.240> of<00:00:43.300> take<00:00:43.450> our<00:00:43.630> farming<00:00:43.960> to<00:00:44.110> it<00:00:44.230> to<00:00:44.410> an

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:44.560 
to sort of take our farming to it to an

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.780 
to sort of take our farming to it to an
the<00:00:45.340> next<00:00:45.580> level<00:00:45.910> and<00:00:46.770> we<00:00:47.770> decided<00:00:48.490> it<00:00:48.700> was

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:48.790 
the next level and we decided it was

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:52.170 
the next level and we decided it was
time<00:00:48.910> to<00:00:48.970> move<00:00:49.210> back<00:00:49.420> to<00:00:49.630> the<00:00:49.720> states<00:00:50.020> and<00:00:51.180> we

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:52.180 
time to move back to the states and we

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.840 
time to move back to the states and we
we<00:00:52.540> moved<00:00:52.780> here<00:00:52.990> in<00:00:53.140> North<00:00:53.350> Carolina<00:00:53.670> on<00:00:54.670> the

organic farms and a lot of sustainably

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.560 
organic farms and a lot of sustainably
minded<00:01:06.340> folks<00:01:06.670> the<00:01:07.150> idea<00:01:07.540> being<00:01:07.869> that<00:01:08.490> we're

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
minded folks the idea being that we're

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.319 
minded folks the idea being that we're
creating<00:01:10.570> a<00:01:11.110> real<00:01:11.680> sense<00:01:12.070> of<00:01:12.250> local<00:01:12.700> food

00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:13.329 
creating a real sense of local food

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:15.389 
creating a real sense of local food
security<00:01:13.749> if<00:01:14.170> we've<00:01:14.469> got<00:01:14.649> our<00:01:14.770> own<00:01:14.799> farmers

00:01:15.389 --> 00:01:15.399 
security if we've got our own farmers

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:18.810 
security if we've got our own farmers
here<00:01:15.700> producing<00:01:16.509> our<00:01:16.689> own<00:01:16.719> food<00:01:17.020> locally<00:01:17.820> we

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
here producing our own food locally we

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.899 
here producing our own food locally we
become<00:01:19.240> less<00:01:19.509> and<00:01:19.719> less<00:01:19.780> dependent<00:01:20.499> on<00:01:20.909> food

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:21.909 
become less and less dependent on food

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:24.719 
become less and less dependent on food
from<00:01:22.390> all<00:01:22.840> over<00:01:23.140> the<00:01:23.409> world<00:01:23.439> that's<00:01:24.189> traveling

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:24.729 
from all over the world that's traveling

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:27.480 
from all over the world that's traveling
great<00:01:24.939> distances<00:01:25.539> to<00:01:25.810> get<00:01:26.649> here<00:01:26.890> I<00:01:27.039> think

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
great distances to get here I think

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:28.559 
great distances to get here I think
we're<00:01:27.640> all<00:01:27.759> starting<00:01:27.850> to<00:01:28.090> realize<00:01:28.359> that

00:01:28.559 --> 00:01:28.569 
we're all starting to realize that

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:30.630 
we're all starting to realize that
that's<00:01:28.719> that's<00:01:28.960> a<00:01:29.079> really<00:01:29.350> important<00:01:29.920> thing

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
that's that's a really important thing

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.940 
that's that's a really important thing
that<00:01:30.909> we<00:01:31.030> need<00:01:31.270> to<00:01:31.390> focus<00:01:31.539> on<00:01:31.899> I<00:01:32.259> think<00:01:32.829> there

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
that we need to focus on I think there

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.480 
that we need to focus on I think there
is<00:01:33.100> definitely<00:01:33.819> a<00:01:34.210> myth<00:01:34.569> about<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:36.009> high<00:01:36.460> cost

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
is definitely a myth about the high cost

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.319 
is definitely a myth about the high cost
of<00:01:37.210> sustainably<00:01:37.780> produced<00:01:37.889> vegetables<00:01:38.889> I

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
of sustainably produced vegetables I

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.330 
of sustainably produced vegetables I
think<00:01:40.329> it<00:01:40.420> comes<00:01:40.539> down<00:01:40.659> to<00:01:40.960> choices<00:01:40.990> if<00:01:41.889> you're

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
think it comes down to choices if you're

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.609 
think it comes down to choices if you're
comparing<00:01:43.350> conventionally<00:01:44.350> produced

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:44.619 
comparing conventionally produced

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:47.730 
comparing conventionally produced
vegetables<00:01:45.460> with<00:01:45.759> sustainably<00:01:46.740> organically

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:47.740 
vegetables with sustainably organically

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.649 
vegetables with sustainably organically
produced<00:01:47.770> vegetables<00:01:48.549> there<00:01:49.119> is<00:01:49.299> going<00:01:49.479> to<00:01:49.630> be

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:49.659 
produced vegetables there is going to be

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:51.660 
produced vegetables there is going to be
a<00:01:49.749> price<00:01:49.990> difference<00:01:50.219> but<00:01:51.219> if<00:01:51.369> you<00:01:51.520> are

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
a price difference but if you are

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.840 
a price difference but if you are
comparing<00:01:52.740> organic<00:01:53.740> produce<00:01:54.039> that<00:01:54.549> you<00:01:54.700> would

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850 
comparing organic produce that you would

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.910 
comparing organic produce that you would
buy<00:01:54.969> in<00:01:55.179> a<00:01:55.299> supermarket<00:01:55.560> that's<00:01:56.560> coming<00:01:56.859> from

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
buy in a supermarket that's coming from

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.300 
buy in a supermarket that's coming from
say<00:01:57.219> California<00:01:57.909> with<00:01:58.539> the<00:01:59.310> sustainable

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
say California with the sustainable

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:01.649 
say California with the sustainable
produce<00:02:00.639> that<00:02:00.819> you're<00:02:00.969> likely<00:02:01.149> going<00:02:01.299> to<00:02:01.450> find

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:01.659 
produce that you're likely going to find

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:03.330 
produce that you're likely going to find
at<00:02:01.749> farmer's<00:02:02.079> markets<00:02:02.469> here<00:02:02.770> you're

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:03.340 
at farmer's markets here you're

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:04.830 
at farmer's markets here you're
generally<00:02:03.759> going<00:02:03.789> to<00:02:03.969> find<00:02:04.179> that<00:02:04.299> the<00:02:04.479> farmers

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
generally going to find that the farmers

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.260 
generally going to find that the farmers
market<00:02:04.869> prices<00:02:05.679> are<00:02:06.009> going<00:02:06.310> to<00:02:06.459> be<00:02:06.639> a<00:02:06.909> bit

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
market prices are going to be a bit

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.389 
market prices are going to be a bit
lower<00:02:07.569> than<00:02:08.140> the<00:02:08.500> organic<00:02:08.979> produce<00:02:09.160> that

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:09.399 
lower than the organic produce that

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:12.120 
lower than the organic produce that
you'd<00:02:09.520> get<00:02:09.700> in<00:02:09.789> a<00:02:09.880> supermarket<00:02:10.800> yeah<00:02:11.800> the<00:02:11.920> farm

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:47.950 
food security is important now and is

food security is important now and is
becoming<00:02:48.280> increasingly<00:02:48.540> important<00:02:49.540> is<00:02:49.720> that

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
becoming increasingly important is that

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.009 
becoming increasingly important is that
we<00:02:50.800> don't<00:02:50.920> really<00:02:51.220> know<00:02:51.550> what<00:02:51.880> the<00:02:52.030> future<00:02:52.630> of

food is going to be but we can see how

it's<00:02:58.030> becoming<00:02:58.450> increasingly<00:02:58.600> more
