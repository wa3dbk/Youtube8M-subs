underground ravines oh well let's go

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.710 
underground ravines oh well let's go
check<00:01:22.799> it<00:01:22.950> out<00:01:23.009> so<00:01:23.189> that's<00:01:23.369> that's<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.210> the

check it out so that's that's the the

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.070 
check it out so that's that's the the
seed<00:01:25.680> right<00:01:25.890> there<00:01:26.189> I<00:01:26.369> will<00:01:27.060> type<00:01:27.570> this<00:01:27.780> out<00:01:27.960> in

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
seed right there I will type this out in

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.539 
seed right there I will type this out in
the<00:01:28.140> description<00:01:28.380> of<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.770> video<00:01:28.920> so<00:01:29.340> you<00:01:29.369> can

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
should be facing the direction we need

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.660 
should be facing the direction we need
to<00:01:47.700> go<00:01:47.759> I'm<00:01:48.360> gonna<00:01:48.570> press<00:01:48.780> f3<00:01:49.130> and<00:01:50.130> we'll<00:01:50.579> take

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
to go I'm gonna press f3 and we'll take

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.249 
to go I'm gonna press f3 and we'll take
a<00:01:50.729> look<00:01:50.880> at<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.030> coordinates<00:01:51.450> X<00:01:51.659> is<00:01:51.960> negative

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
a look at the coordinates X is negative

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.810 
a look at the coordinates X is negative

1 6 7 z is 1 2 2 in case you spawn in a
different<00:01:57.119> location<00:01:57.210> that's<00:01:58.020> where<00:01:58.229> you<00:01:58.320> need

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
different location that's where you need

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:03.100 
different location that's where you need
to<00:01:58.500> go<00:01:59.750> all<00:02:00.750> right<00:02:00.799> sweet<00:02:01.799> all<00:02:02.490> right<00:02:02.610> now<00:02:02.729> fly

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
to go all right sweet all right now fly

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:04.749 
to go all right sweet all right now fly
fly<00:02:04.110> away

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
fly away

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:06.709 
fly away
this<00:02:05.759> is<00:02:05.909> direction<00:02:06.210> we<00:02:06.270> need<00:02:06.360> to<00:02:06.450> go<00:02:06.540> actually

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
this is direction we need to go actually

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.779 
this is direction we need to go actually
so<00:02:07.200> we're<00:02:07.290> gonna<00:02:07.380> just<00:02:07.619> turn<00:02:07.950> to<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.310> right<00:02:08.580> 2

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
so we're gonna just turn to the right 2

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:09.820 
so we're gonna just turn to the right 2

right in follow it down there's one

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.330 
right in follow it down there's one
block<00:03:22.640> entranceway<00:03:23.540> that's<00:03:24.050> it<00:03:24.320> I<00:03:24.530> found<00:03:25.220> this

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
block entranceway that's it I found this

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.550 
block entranceway that's it I found this
completely<00:03:25.850> by<00:03:26.060> accident<00:03:26.180> is<00:03:26.570> today<00:03:26.870> pretty

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
completely by accident is today pretty

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:28.000 
completely by accident is today pretty
cool<00:03:27.769> stuff

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
cool stuff

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.820 
cool stuff
alright<00:03:29.000> so<00:03:29.269> go<00:03:29.510> down<00:03:29.720> here<00:03:30.440> there's<00:03:30.650> a<00:03:30.709> couple

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830 
alright so go down here there's a couple

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:34.449 
alright so go down here there's a couple
ways<00:03:30.980> to<00:03:31.250> go<00:03:31.400> actually<00:03:32.320> I<00:03:33.320> think<00:03:33.800> it's<00:03:34.070> whips

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
ways to go actually I think it's whips

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:37.180 
ways to go actually I think it's whips
off<00:03:34.730> up<00:03:35.090> top<00:03:35.540> wait<00:03:35.840> where's<00:03:36.080> the<00:03:36.140> split<00:03:36.500> splits

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
off up top wait where's the split splits

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:40.509 
off up top wait where's the split splits
right<00:03:37.370> here<00:03:37.810> so<00:03:38.810> if<00:03:38.930> you<00:03:39.050> go<00:03:39.230> to<00:03:39.260> the<00:03:39.620> left<00:03:39.890> it

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519 
right here so if you go to the left it

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:42.610 
right here so if you go to the left it
leads<00:03:40.730> to<00:03:40.850> a<00:03:40.970> more<00:03:41.180> natural<00:03:41.720> cavern<00:03:42.230> system

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
leads to a more natural cavern system

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.890 
leads to a more natural cavern system
and<00:03:43.070> you'll<00:03:43.400> get<00:03:43.580> to<00:03:43.760> the<00:03:43.880> mineshaft<00:03:44.420> there's

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:44.900 
and you'll get to the mineshaft there's

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.750 
and you'll get to the mineshaft there's
a<00:03:44.959> ton<00:03:45.260> of<00:03:45.290> iron<00:03:45.680> and<00:03:45.890> coal<00:03:46.100> down<00:03:46.340> there<00:03:46.550> by<00:03:46.700> the

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
a ton of iron and coal down there by the

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:51.340 
a ton of iron and coal down there by the
way<00:03:46.970> and<00:03:47.590> over<00:03:48.590> here<00:03:49.010> put<00:03:49.550> you<00:03:49.730> right<00:03:49.930> in<00:03:50.930> the
