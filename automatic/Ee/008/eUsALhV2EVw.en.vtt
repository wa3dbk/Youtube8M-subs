00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:09.830
 rubric answers to questions 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:14.040
 Today our theme is glue guns 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:16.199
 I wrote a letter to the girls her name is 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.109
 Julia from St. Petersburg 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.480
 that's what she writes she hello to me 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.400
 really like your group and site with 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.590
 by your help I learned to do very 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.449
 beautiful bouquets and I want to continue 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.439
 develop in this direction 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:33.719
 thank you very much you about me 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.239
 glue gun do not advise 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:39.480
 at one of the master classes you spoke 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:43.309
 that the temperature of the glue should not exceed 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:46.739
 80 degrees I recently chose a gun 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:48.899
 everywhere the temperature is 105 and 65 degrees 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:54.000
 this is not suitable Julia 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:56.390
 thank you very much for asking of course you 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.590
 wo n't find a clima gun which 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.260
 heated to a maximum of eighty 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.619
 degrees because he must 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:08.280
 melt glue cartridge so that 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:13.710
 he flowed well what I said that 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:15.930
 it should not be very hot and better 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.650
 do not overheat it to the maximum 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:24.320
 temperatures need it in order not to 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:26.390
 burn yourself when working because you stick 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:30.180
 with your fingers 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:32.939
 petals of flowers and so time 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:36.049
 from time off glue gun 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:40.460
 either by clicking on the button or 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:40.460
 pulling it out of the socket 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:47.729
 be careful when working with glue 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:49.820
 a pistol it was a question from yuli from 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:53.070
