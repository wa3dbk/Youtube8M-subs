00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:24.950
 camera of white stationers of the 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:26.300

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.840
 difficult but has done more things 

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.840
 difficult 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:35.570
 uniting for people to understand 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.320
 so he understands but it's okay 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:41.030
 started with something difficult and the same already 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.350

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:49.789
 people and it was already complicated with everything 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:51.590
 the price if the liters were how many 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:52.759

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:38.640
 the load that I can carry that I know 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:46.060
 in that change it may be that that is the 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:49.120
