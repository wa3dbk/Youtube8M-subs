00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
differences in how they how they go on

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.170 
differences in how they how they go on
and<00:00:58.320> how<00:00:58.980> they<00:00:59.129> look<00:00:59.340> on<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.520> piece<00:00:59.760> of<00:00:59.910> stained

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
and how they look on a piece of stained

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.160 
and how they look on a piece of stained
wood<00:01:01.670> the<00:01:02.670> first<00:01:02.910> thing<00:01:03.090> you'll<00:01:03.629> notice<00:01:03.930> about

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
wood the first thing you'll notice about

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.679 
wood the first thing you'll notice about
the<00:01:04.760> water-based<00:01:05.760> polyurethane<00:01:06.090> is<00:01:06.540> that

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
the water-based polyurethane is that

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.300 
the water-based polyurethane is that
it's<00:01:06.840> not<00:01:06.990> really<00:01:07.380> clear<00:01:07.740> at<00:01:07.860> all<00:01:08.010> when<00:01:08.220> it

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
it's not really clear at all when it

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.750 
it's not really clear at all when it
goes<00:01:08.490> on<00:01:08.729> it's<00:01:08.970> kind<00:01:09.689> of<00:01:09.750> a<00:01:09.869> milky<00:01:10.380> white<00:01:10.760> sort

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
goes on it's kind of a milky white sort

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.499 
goes on it's kind of a milky white sort
of<00:01:11.850> a<00:01:11.909> look<00:01:12.920> but<00:01:13.920> it<00:01:14.100> will<00:01:14.280> dry<00:01:14.610> to<00:01:14.790> a<00:01:15.060> clear

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
of a look but it will dry to a clear

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.320 
of a look but it will dry to a clear
finish<00:01:16.159> if<00:01:17.159> it<00:01:17.310> wants<00:01:17.520> to<00:01:17.580> take<00:01:17.759> a<00:01:17.820> look<00:01:18.090> at<00:01:18.180> how

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
finish if it wants to take a look at how

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.840 
finish if it wants to take a look at how
that<00:01:18.540> goes<00:01:18.780> on<00:01:20.360> you<00:01:21.360> want<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:21.570> use<00:01:21.659> nice<00:01:22.020> smooth

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
that goes on you want to use nice smooth

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.230 
that goes on you want to use nice smooth
long<00:01:23.850> strokes<00:01:25.040> keep<00:01:26.040> your<00:01:26.250> overlapping<00:01:26.820> to<00:01:27.210> a

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
long strokes keep your overlapping to a

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:33.370 
long strokes keep your overlapping to a
minimum

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:33.380 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.350 

when<00:01:33.950> you're<00:01:34.100> first<00:01:34.280> brushing<00:01:34.760> out<00:01:34.880> to<00:01:35.060> finish

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
when you're first brushing out to finish

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.330 
when you're first brushing out to finish
you<00:01:35.540> can<00:01:35.659> press<00:01:35.990> pretty<00:01:36.259> hard<00:01:36.460> but<00:01:39.189> you<00:01:40.189> want

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
you can press pretty hard but you want

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.480 
you can press pretty hard but you want
to<00:01:40.400> use<00:01:40.520> a<00:01:40.549> lighter<00:01:40.909> stroke<00:01:41.799> add<00:01:42.799> closer<00:01:43.190> to<00:01:43.460> a

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:43.490 
to use a lighter stroke add closer to a

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.460 
to use a lighter stroke add closer to a
90-degree<00:01:43.850> angle<00:01:44.119> when<00:01:44.570> you<00:01:44.659> do<00:01:44.810> your<00:01:44.990> your

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
90-degree angle when you do your your

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.749 
90-degree angle when you do your your
last<00:01:45.770> stroke<00:01:46.450> now<00:01:47.450> let's<00:01:47.659> take<00:01:47.810> a<00:01:47.840> look<00:01:48.049> at<00:01:48.200> the

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:48.759 
last stroke now let's take a look at the

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:53.620 
last stroke now let's take a look at the
at<00:01:49.759> the<00:01:50.000> solvent<00:01:50.600> based<00:01:50.750> polyurethane<00:01:52.630> now

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:53.630 
at the solvent based polyurethane now

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.730 
at the solvent based polyurethane now
you<00:01:53.690> can<00:01:53.960> see<00:01:54.200> that<00:01:54.409> the<00:01:56.289> solvent<00:01:57.289> based

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:57.740 
you can see that the solvent based

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.639 
you can see that the solvent based
polyurethane<00:01:58.190> is<00:01:59.030> clear<00:01:59.720> when<00:02:00.049> it<00:02:00.140> goes<00:02:00.350> on

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
polyurethane is clear when it goes on

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:03.190 
polyurethane is clear when it goes on
the<00:02:01.270> brushing<00:02:02.270> technique<00:02:02.659> is<00:02:02.810> pretty<00:02:02.960> much

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
the brushing technique is pretty much

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.949 
the brushing technique is pretty much
the<00:02:03.350> same<00:02:05.409> you<00:02:06.409> want<00:02:06.590> to<00:02:06.649> use<00:02:06.770> a<00:02:06.800> light<00:02:07.100> stroke

00:02:07.949 --> 00:02:07.959 
the same you want to use a light stroke

00:02:07.959 --> 00:02:10.930 
the same you want to use a light stroke
once<00:02:08.959> you've<00:02:09.140> gotten<00:02:09.380> your<00:02:09.530> material<00:02:09.739> on<00:02:10.640> to

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:10.940 
once you've gotten your material on to

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:18.640 
once you've gotten your material on to
the<00:02:11.060> wood<00:02:16.569> press<00:02:17.569> it<00:02:17.750> in<00:02:17.840> pretty<00:02:18.080> good<00:02:18.350> to<00:02:18.500> get

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
the wood press it in pretty good to get

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.949 
the wood press it in pretty good to get
that<00:02:18.860> initial<00:02:19.519> material<00:02:19.819> onto<00:02:20.360> the<00:02:20.600> wood<00:02:20.780> and

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
that initial material onto the wood and

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:24.759 
that initial material onto the wood and
then<00:02:21.190> lightly<00:02:22.190> drag<00:02:22.459> the<00:02:22.670> brush<00:02:23.350> to<00:02:24.350> eliminate

00:02:24.759 --> 00:02:24.769 
then lightly drag the brush to eliminate

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:32.770 
then lightly drag the brush to eliminate
any<00:02:24.950> bubbles<00:02:25.630> and<00:02:27.790> streaking<00:02:28.790> if<00:02:28.910> you<00:02:29.030> can<00:02:31.780> and

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
any bubbles and streaking if you can and
