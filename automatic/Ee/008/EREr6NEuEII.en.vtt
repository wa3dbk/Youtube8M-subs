Jordan<00:00:00.510> Dominique<00:00:00.930> Wilkins<00:00:01.290> and<00:00:01.770> I<00:00:02.669> ask<00:00:03.179> you

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 
Jordan Dominique Wilkins and I ask you

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.360 
Jordan Dominique Wilkins and I ask you
fellas<00:00:03.720> if<00:00:04.080> you<00:00:04.259> thought<00:00:04.470> Jordan<00:00:05.100> should<00:00:05.220> let

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
fellas if you thought Jordan should let

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.670 
fellas if you thought Jordan should let
him<00:00:05.460> go<00:00:05.490> first<00:00:05.790> or<00:00:05.970> not<00:00:06.089> well<00:00:06.779> I<00:00:06.810> think<00:00:07.230> that

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
him go first or not well I think that

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.700 
him go first or not well I think that
Jordan<00:00:08.460> probably<00:00:09.269> did<00:00:09.630> the<00:00:09.780> right<00:00:09.960> thing<00:00:10.290> he's

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
Jordan probably did the right thing he's

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.870 
Jordan probably did the right thing he's
going<00:00:10.889> to<00:00:10.950> put<00:00:11.130> the<00:00:11.250> pressure<00:00:11.460> on<00:00:11.670> Wilkins<00:00:12.559> and

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:13.880 
going to put the pressure on Wilkins and

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.709 
going to put the pressure on Wilkins and
Dominique<00:00:14.880> is<00:00:15.030> going<00:00:15.269> to<00:00:15.360> give<00:00:15.480> a<00:00:15.509> little

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
Dominique is going to give a little

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.950 
Dominique is going to give a little
Running<00:00:16.289> Start<00:00:17.160> to<00:00:17.550> this<00:00:17.699> one<00:00:17.940> not<00:00:18.750> much

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
Running Start to this one not much

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:26.580 
Running Start to this one not much
though<00:00:21.740> from<00:00:22.740> high

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:26.590 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.560 

above<00:00:27.590> the<00:00:27.830> rim<00:00:28.010> well<00:00:28.490> out<00:00:28.699> in<00:00:28.910> front<00:00:28.939> I<00:00:29.449> think

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:29.570 
above the rim well out in front I think

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:31.659 
above the rim well out in front I think
that's<00:00:30.019> the<00:00:30.230> key<00:00:30.439> as<00:00:30.650> well<00:00:30.859> is<00:00:31.009> the<00:00:31.160> height<00:00:31.369> how

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:31.669 
that's the key as well is the height how

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:33.520 
that's the key as well is the height how
far<00:00:31.970> out<00:00:32.059> in<00:00:32.210> front<00:00:32.480> he<00:00:32.599> caught<00:00:32.870> it<00:00:32.899> when<00:00:33.410> is

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
far out in front he caught it when is

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.619 
far out in front he caught it when is
able<00:00:33.860> to<00:00:33.950> hammer<00:00:34.280> at<00:00:34.520> home<00:00:34.579> and<00:00:35.239> again<00:00:35.480> he

00:00:35.619 --> 00:00:35.629 
able to hammer at home and again he

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:37.720 
able to hammer at home and again he
makes<00:00:35.840> it<00:00:36.020> look<00:00:36.170> like<00:00:36.350> it's<00:00:36.590> routine<00:00:37.010> but<00:00:37.610> why

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:37.730 
makes it look like it's routine but why

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.760 
makes it look like it's routine but why
should<00:00:37.940> we<00:00:38.030> look<00:00:38.120> how<00:00:38.300> far<00:00:38.570> away<00:00:38.780> is<00:00:39.020> that's<00:00:39.590> a

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:39.770 
should we look how far away is that's a

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.130 
should we look how far away is that's a
great<00:00:40.100> start<00:00:40.460> for<00:00:40.670> dominate<00:00:41.420> and<00:00:41.690> look<00:00:41.870> still

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:42.140 
great start for dominate and look still

be<00:01:25.960> hard<00:01:26.170> not<00:01:26.290> to<00:01:26.350> give<00:01:26.590> 50<00:01:26.950> on<00:01:27.040> that<00:01:27.159> one<00:01:27.340> Steve

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
be hard not to give 50 on that one Steve

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.530 
be hard not to give 50 on that one Steve
that<00:01:27.880> was<00:01:28.000> impressive

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
that was impressive

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.900 
that was impressive
that<00:01:30.080> time<00:01:30.350> he<00:01:30.470> did<00:01:30.620> the<00:01:30.650> two-hander<00:01:31.430> double

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:31.910 
that time he did the two-hander double

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.930 
that time he did the two-hander double
clutch<00:01:32.410> as<00:01:33.410> he<00:01:33.680> did<00:01:33.950> looked<00:01:34.280> like<00:01:34.430> to<00:01:34.580> kiss<00:01:34.760> the

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:34.940

rim<00:01:35.090> type<00:01:35.890> before<00:01:36.890> he<00:01:37.160> got<00:01:37.340> a<00:01:37.370> 50

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
rim type before he got a 50

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:44.940 
it hammers it home over the top and

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.420 
it hammers it home over the top and
you'll<00:01:45.420> see<00:01:45.659> from<00:01:46.140> way<00:01:46.290> up<00:01:46.320> high<00:01:46.710> just<00:01:47.250> how

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
you'll see from way up high just how

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.510 
you'll see from way up high just how
difficult<00:01:48.030> it<00:01:48.120> is<00:01:48.150> and<00:01:48.570> we'll<00:01:49.110> see<00:01:49.520> the
