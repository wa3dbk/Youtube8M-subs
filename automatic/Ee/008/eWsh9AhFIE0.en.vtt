00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.380
 assault 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:53.920
 or a machine gun as for me easy assault and 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:57.590
 best fit descent insert 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:00.530
 full automatic and clip if you 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.210
 put a gun barrel then would he 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:06.140
 need to put a high capacity 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:10.789
 if attack and light assault this clip 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:14.090
 we put standard in equipment 

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:17.929
 fighting is best bullet fit or 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:21.020
 Tesla let's see it whine that 

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:22.659
 we succeeded and so we on so 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:28.630
 called polygon 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:29.900
 or something like that, and so here we 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:40.860
 shoot 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:43.320
 the bullet is not our assembly on saturn 65 well 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:47.010
 that 's something like that now let's see 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:53.430
 if we put the tests like this 

00:01:47.010 --> 00:02:03.290
 will look like with tesla and so now not 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:02:08.610
 charge 50 here already puts on all 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:12.380
 the world even put spoons 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:16.610
 two assemblies will be the most decent 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:19.170
 also let's take the machine gun on 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:23.330

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:34.760
 I forgot to put both high capacity 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:34.760
 so here is a preset but shoot 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:49.140
