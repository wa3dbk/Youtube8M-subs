00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
interesting line of videos to be doing

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.070 
interesting line of videos to be doing
is<00:01:19.259> because<00:01:19.619> I've<00:01:19.830> noticed<00:01:20.280> that<00:01:20.430> any<00:01:21.049> video<00:01:22.049> I

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
is because I've noticed that any video I

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.649 
is because I've noticed that any video I
make<00:01:22.590> that<00:01:22.640> revolves<00:01:23.640> around<00:01:23.759> a<00:01:24.090> game<00:01:24.420> that

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
make that revolves around a game that

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.800 
make that revolves around a game that
was<00:01:24.810> released<00:01:24.869> back<00:01:25.500> in<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:25.920> 90<00:01:26.430> those<00:01:27.180> videos

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
was released back in the 90 those videos

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.520 
was released back in the 90 those videos
get<00:01:28.409> the<00:01:28.619> most<00:01:28.860> views<00:01:29.900> so<00:01:30.900> I<00:01:30.930> thought<00:01:31.200> it'd<00:01:31.380> be

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
get the most views so I thought it'd be

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.950 
get the most views so I thought it'd be
interesting<00:01:31.770> to<00:01:32.280> upload<00:01:32.820> those<00:01:33.150> get<00:01:33.570> quite<00:01:33.930> a

the 90s and a game that I enjoyed a lot
as<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:55.649> child<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:56.430> still<00:01:56.729> enjoy<00:01:56.909> to<00:01:57.329> this<00:01:57.479> day

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
as a child and still enjoy to this day

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.590 
as a child and still enjoy to this day
even<00:01:58.430> but<00:01:59.430> then<00:01:59.640> again<00:01:59.790> it'd<00:02:00.090> be<00:02:00.240> kind<00:02:00.540> of

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
even but then again it'd be kind of

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.840 
even but then again it'd be kind of
cheap<00:02:01.049> doing<00:02:01.439> that<00:02:01.649> it's<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:01.920> first<00:02:02.189> episode

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
cheap doing that it's the first episode

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.480 
cheap doing that it's the first episode
because<00:02:03.090> well<00:02:03.659> I<00:02:03.930> have<00:02:04.380> a<00:02:04.409> bunch<00:02:04.770> of<00:02:04.979> carnivals

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
because well I have a bunch of carnivals

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:06.890 
because well I have a bunch of carnivals
videos<00:02:05.939> on<00:02:06.180> my<00:02:06.360> own

videos on my own

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.320 
videos on my own
channel<00:02:07.830> so<00:02:08.100> what<00:02:08.460> would<00:02:08.580> be<00:02:08.640> the<00:02:08.910> point<00:02:09.119> of

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
channel so what would be the point of

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.930 
channel so what would be the point of
telling<00:02:09.570> you<00:02:09.810> guys<00:02:10.020> like<00:02:10.500> my<00:02:10.740> history<00:02:11.280> how<00:02:11.910> I

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
enjoyed it as much as I did when I was

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.240 
enjoyed it as much as I did when I was
little<00:02:14.450> it'd<00:02:15.450> be<00:02:15.780> like<00:02:15.810> no<00:02:16.260> point<00:02:16.770> to<00:02:16.920> that<00:02:16.950> at

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
little it'd be like no point to that at

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.910 
little it'd be like no point to that at
all<00:02:17.660> but<00:02:18.660> at<00:02:18.750> the<00:02:18.870> same<00:02:19.080> time<00:02:19.410> it<00:02:19.650> would<00:02:19.770> be

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
all but at the same time it would be

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.280 
all but at the same time it would be
well<00:02:20.160> soon<00:02:20.610> though<00:02:20.940> seeing<00:02:21.300> how<00:02:21.540> all<00:02:21.870> I<00:02:21.930> ever
