00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:45.980

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:48.160 
instead of this pump because I think
it's<00:02:46.280> a<00:02:46.370> little<00:02:46.580> bit<00:02:46.850> easier<00:02:47.210> for<00:02:47.270> me<00:02:47.510> anyway

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
me not to overdo it should I say if I

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.130 
me not to overdo it should I say if I
don't<00:02:55.040> have<00:02:55.490> my<00:02:55.820> products<00:02:56.360> in<00:02:56.450> a<00:02:56.540> pump<00:02:56.810> so<00:02:57.110> I

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
don't have my products in a pump so I

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:58.930 
don't have my products in a pump so I
would<00:02:57.440> hope<00:02:57.650> that<00:02:57.710> they<00:02:58.010> would<00:02:58.160> put<00:02:58.370> this<00:02:58.490> into

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
would hope that they would put this into

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.220 
would hope that they would put this into
a<00:02:58.970> jar<00:02:59.870> instead<00:03:00.410> of<00:03:00.620> in<00:03:00.800> a<00:03:01.100> pump<00:03:01.370> system<00:03:01.580> and

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
40% of the way so I can just get most of

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.630 
40% of the way so I can just get most of
the<00:03:47.210> moisture<00:03:47.360> out<00:03:47.780> and<00:03:47.960> then<00:03:48.350> I<00:03:48.620> went<00:03:48.980> in<00:03:49.190> then

the<00:03:51.920> way<00:03:52.070> and<00:03:52.340> then<00:03:52.880> when<00:03:53.060> it<00:03:53.150> was<00:03:53.270> completely

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:53.690 
the way and then when it was completely

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:55.900 
the way and then when it was completely
dry<00:03:53.960> I<00:03:54.350> just<00:03:54.920> turned<00:03:55.130> my<00:03:55.190> head<00:03:55.400> upside<00:03:55.670> down

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:48.750 
don't wear twist outs I just wear wash
and<00:05:43.690> gos<00:05:43.840> but<00:05:44.230> this<00:05:44.920> I<00:05:45.160> actually<00:05:45.400> like<00:05:46.060> I<00:05:47.760> think

00:05:48.750 --> 00:05:48.760 
and gos but this I actually like I think

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:51.660 
and gos but this I actually like I think
that<00:05:48.940> this<00:05:49.210> cream<00:05:49.930> gave<00:05:50.680> my<00:05:50.860> hair<00:05:51.100> a<00:05:51.130> hold<00:05:51.430> that

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:51.670 
that this cream gave my hair a hold that

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:53.400 
that this cream gave my hair a hold that
I<00:05:51.730> would<00:05:52.030> normally<00:05:52.210> not<00:05:52.690> have<00:05:52.720> for<00:05:53.260> some

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:53.410 
I would normally not have for some

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:56.130 
I would normally not have for some
reason<00:05:53.800> once<00:05:53.980> I<00:05:54.130> twist<00:05:54.400> my<00:05:54.460> hair<00:05:54.820> out<00:05:54.850> my<00:05:55.810> hair

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:56.140 
reason once I twist my hair out my hair

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:57.810 
reason once I twist my hair out my hair
flattens<00:05:56.680> out<00:05:56.800> because<00:05:57.130> it<00:05:57.250> straightens<00:05:57.670> out

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:57.820 
flattens out because it straightens out

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:59.730 
flattens out because it straightens out
so<00:05:58.060> much<00:05:58.210> once<00:05:58.480> I<00:05:58.600> twist<00:05:58.900> it<00:05:59.020> it<00:05:59.170> doesn't<00:05:59.380> puff

00:05:59.730 --> 00:05:59.740 
so much once I twist it it doesn't puff

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:02.790 
so much once I twist it it doesn't puff
up<00:05:59.920> anymore<00:06:00.370> but<00:06:00.970> this<00:06:01.240> I<00:06:01.540> actually<00:06:01.810> really

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:02.800 
up anymore but this I actually really

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.500 
up anymore but this I actually really
really<00:06:03.040> like<00:06:03.340> because<00:06:03.760> I<00:06:03.790> have<00:06:04.150> a<00:06:04.180> lot<00:06:04.480> of

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:04.510 
really like because I have a lot of

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:07.020 
really like because I have a lot of
volume<00:06:05.020> which<00:06:05.770> is<00:06:05.800> just<00:06:06.310> not<00:06:06.490> something<00:06:06.790> I

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:07.030 
volume which is just not something I

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:08.970 
volume which is just not something I
normally<00:06:07.090> get<00:06:07.690> with<00:06:07.870> a<00:06:07.900> twist<00:06:08.200> out<00:06:08.350> and<00:06:08.620> so

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:08.980 
normally get with a twist out and so

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:12.780 
normally get with a twist out and so
even<00:06:09.880> if<00:06:10.000> I<00:06:10.120> do<00:06:10.180> one<00:06:10.810> by<00:06:11.380> chance<00:06:11.740> I<00:06:12.040> usually<00:06:12.580> pin

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:12.790 
even if I do one by chance I usually pin

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:14.580 
even if I do one by chance I usually pin
it<00:06:12.880> up<00:06:13.030> but<00:06:13.240> this<00:06:13.390> I<00:06:13.510> would<00:06:13.630> totally<00:06:13.750> wear<00:06:13.990> down

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:14.590 
it up but this I would totally wear down

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:18.840 
it up but this I would totally wear down
I'm<00:06:15.160> loving<00:06:15.640> this<00:06:15.790> cream<00:06:16.120> I<00:06:17.640> don't<00:06:18.640> know<00:06:18.730> what

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:47.560 
on my curl just as a test curl just to

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.170 
on my curl just as a test curl just to
see<00:06:47.740> what<00:06:47.890> it<00:06:47.980> would<00:06:48.100> do<00:06:48.280> to<00:06:48.310> define<00:06:48.820> the<00:06:48.970> curl

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:49.180 
see what it would do to define the curl

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:51.150 
see what it would do to define the curl
and<00:06:49.240> it<00:06:49.510> definitely<00:06:50.110> was<00:06:50.350> wonderful<00:06:50.830> for<00:06:50.980> that

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:51.160 
and it definitely was wonderful for that

flakiness no residue the crunch is the

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:17.460 
flakiness no residue the crunch is the

that<00:07:26.139> I<00:07:26.169> have<00:07:26.349> a<00:07:26.379> little<00:07:26.769> bit<00:07:26.889> more<00:07:27.159> of<00:07:27.459> a<00:07:27.669> hold

00:07:27.959 --> 00:07:27.969 
that I have a little bit more of a hold

00:07:27.969 --> 00:07:30.899 
that I have a little bit more of a hold
up<00:07:28.330> here<00:07:28.629> because<00:07:28.869> I<00:07:29.019> did<00:07:29.469> place<00:07:29.799> the<00:07:30.099> ultra

00:07:30.899 --> 00:07:30.909 
up here because I did place the ultra

00:07:30.909 --> 00:07:33.779 
up here because I did place the ultra
defining<00:07:31.360> gel<00:07:31.539> at<00:07:31.809> the<00:07:32.139> top<00:07:32.529> of<00:07:32.769> my<00:07:33.069> hair<00:07:33.459> going

00:07:33.779 --> 00:07:33.789 
defining gel at the top of my hair going

00:07:33.789 --> 00:07:35.939 
defining gel at the top of my hair going
down<00:07:34.179> so<00:07:34.779> I<00:07:34.809> do<00:07:35.049> have<00:07:35.409> a<00:07:35.469> little<00:07:35.649> bit<00:07:35.769> more

00:07:35.939 --> 00:07:35.949 
down so I do have a little bit more

00:07:35.949 --> 00:07:37.919 
down so I do have a little bit more
texture<00:07:36.309> up<00:07:36.549> here<00:07:36.819> as<00:07:36.939> far<00:07:37.089> as<00:07:37.149> the<00:07:37.419> stiffness

00:07:37.919 --> 00:07:37.929 
texture up here as far as the stiffness

00:07:37.929 --> 00:07:40.859 
texture up here as far as the stiffness
but<00:07:38.439> that<00:07:38.769> is<00:07:39.069> what<00:07:39.459> I<00:07:39.639> actually<00:07:39.939> like<00:07:40.419> because

00:07:40.859 --> 00:07:40.869 
but that is what I actually like because

00:07:40.869 --> 00:07:44.369 
but that is what I actually like because
I<00:07:41.199> want<00:07:41.559> my<00:07:41.709> hair<00:07:42.039> wherever<00:07:42.879> I<00:07:42.969> put<00:07:43.209> my<00:07:43.449> ultra

00:07:44.369 --> 00:07:44.379 
I want my hair wherever I put my ultra

00:07:44.379 --> 00:07:45.959 
I want my hair wherever I put my ultra
defining<00:07:44.739> gel<00:07:44.860> is<00:07:44.979> really<00:07:45.159> where<00:07:45.429> I<00:07:45.489> want<00:07:45.789> to

00:07:45.959 --> 00:07:45.969 
defining gel is really where I want to

00:07:45.969 --> 00:07:48.389 
defining gel is really where I want to
have<00:07:46.149> the<00:07:46.539> most<00:07:46.779> definition<00:07:47.619> I<00:07:47.769> wanted<00:07:48.279> to

00:07:48.389 --> 00:07:48.399 
have the most definition I wanted to

00:07:48.399 --> 00:07:49.889 
have the most definition I wanted to
have<00:07:48.549> a<00:07:48.579> separation<00:07:49.269> there<00:07:49.479> and<00:07:49.659> so<00:07:49.779> that's

00:07:49.889 --> 00:07:49.899 
have a separation there and so that's

00:07:49.899 --> 00:07:52.499 
have a separation there and so that's
what<00:07:50.079> I<00:07:50.110> have<00:07:50.319> so<00:07:50.919> that<00:07:51.429> is<00:07:51.759> my<00:07:52.029> complete

00:07:52.499 --> 00:07:52.509
