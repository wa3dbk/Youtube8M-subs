00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:10.780
 So that's the name for that 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:12.620
 new tool with your yours 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:15.830
 prepaid cards easy and simple 

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:18.320
 can manage comfortably and not 

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:21.440
 only that you can also very simple 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.350
 charge account balance or query directly 

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.490
 on the customer portal the prepaid 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:27.740
 providers book any options 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:28.970
 and does not lose the costs 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.699
 in fact, they will become pro 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.559
 counted charging internal guide on 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:36.949
 has two independent costs 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:38.870
 counts that every sim card we cost 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:41.360
 counter can be activated 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:44.329
 yes that is exactly and I hope you have 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:47.210
 has a lot of fun and sees in practice 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:50.210
 the whole thing then how are these 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:54.610
 Mainz will be charging there now 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.610
 enter the code directly 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:01:04.160
 and after this code has been entered 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:05.500
 we are still asked how big the 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.610
 is worth 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.160
 Let's give it to others with the 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:13.090
 cost counter knows how much we now 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:17.440
 have charged 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:19.220
 thus, the costs are recorded for us 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.560
 and that's it 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.369
 so easy and so fast can be with you 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.349
 guide 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:26.349
 recharge the prepaid cable 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:35.230
 yes and there we are already in 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.760
 adjusts window of the network provider stands 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:39.250
 now on custom with it 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:42.690
 sees how this is configured manually 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:47.830
 eg in this case enter vodafone 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:49.360
 then the usd account will query this data 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:54.490
 You should get out of the internet first 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:57.790
 search out and then you can, for example 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:00.610
 the user button with own 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:03.940
 functions prove this, for example 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.750
 portal that you at the prepaid provider 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.000
 call 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:10.209
 but you can also call there 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.540
 specify then with the example 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:14.830
 hotline to be connected 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:18.280
 but you can just as well there 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:21.310
 enter another usd code to 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:24.400
 Example, somehow the corner before 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:28.830
 request a button press 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:31.959
 yes the edition code star 100 stars 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:34.330
 followed by the leyen to give then 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:38.580
 Recharge number will be completed in 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:40.989
 rhombus symbol inscribed there 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.780
 and so you have almost the full control 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:49.360
 over the entire co2 through the program 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:51.420
 it is used for the Germans 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.930
 Customers already have some profiles 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.600
 preconfigured all in germany 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:59.190
 available networks should be so with it 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:01.900
 without manual configuration 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.160
 it should be a config that that 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.200
 does not know he could program 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.820
 these individual and in one of the 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.750
 next version is also this one 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:13.269
 Provider in the list in it 

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:15.670
 yes and with the hook you can for it 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:18.519
 then make sure you have a SIM card in it 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:20.620
 The status bar integrates the man 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:22.329
 clicks and lands directly in the program 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.299
 the cost meter is so far 

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:26.620
 interesting as he after input the 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:28.720
 Shortly then charge a window 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:32.410
 apparently where he would have to determine how 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:34.900
 high now the sum of the charge number 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:36.850
 was then counted internally how much 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.130
 money already on this card 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:42.070
 you could pay the counter 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:44.740
 on the menu here reset 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:46.150
 Direct display means that you are in 

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:48.490
 the survey in a small 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:53.350
 customer circle at a glance immediately sees 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:55.960
 how high the cost is the dual 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:57.760
 sim mode is for two sim operation so 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:00.730
 not only can dual sim be synonymous 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:02.860
 its just a single so mandy 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:04.810
 but has several cards you like 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:07.650
 sometimes changes fast times changes so 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.570
 you can do that as a second profile 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:11.680
 abuse 

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:12.400
 but that is not usually the case 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:16.470
 be a case 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:16.470
 That's it with the configuration
