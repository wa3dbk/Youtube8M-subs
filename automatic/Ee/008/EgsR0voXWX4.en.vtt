00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:40.190 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:44.270 

maybe<00:03:41.190> I'm<00:03:41.340> gonna<00:03:41.460> wrap<00:03:41.670> these<00:03:41.880> ends<00:03:43.280> surely

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
maybe I'm gonna wrap these ends surely

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:49.190 
maybe I'm gonna wrap these ends surely
this<00:03:44.400> okay<00:03:44.730> so<00:03:45.360> I<00:03:47.630> would<00:03:48.630> say<00:03:48.780> I<00:03:48.810> want<00:03:49.080> these

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
this okay so I would say I want these

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.460 
this okay so I would say I want these
end<00:03:49.680> city<00:03:49.980> phones<00:03:50.370> either<00:03:50.700> I<00:03:51.120> just<00:03:52.080> want<00:03:52.290> this

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
end city phones either I just want this

00:03:52.470 --> 00:04:04.080 
end city phones either I just want this
to<00:03:52.650> be<00:03:52.710> very<00:03:52.950> stable

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.090 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:07.720 

that's<00:04:05.090> that<00:04:06.070> so<00:04:07.070> it's<00:04:07.160> a<00:04:07.250> great<00:04:07.460> way<00:04:07.700> to

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 
that's that so it's a great way to

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:12.070 
that's that so it's a great way to
organize<00:04:08.030> all<00:04:08.750> your<00:04:09.110> wires<00:04:10.780> now<00:04:11.780> it's

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:12.080 
organize all your wires now it's

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:15.640 
organize all your wires now it's
basically<00:04:13.180> quite<00:04:14.180> a<00:04:14.210> short<00:04:14.480> wire<00:04:14.780> didn't<00:04:15.530> need

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
basically quite a short wire didn't need

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:18.300 
basically quite a short wire didn't need
all<00:04:15.800> this<00:04:15.920> anything<00:04:16.370> so<00:04:16.850> now<00:04:17.060> I<00:04:17.090> can<00:04:17.270> do<00:04:17.420> this

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
all this anything so now I can do this

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:56.040 
all this anything so now I can do this
and<00:04:19.310> just<00:04:19.550> hold<00:04:19.820> it<00:04:19.970> in<00:04:24.070> of<00:04:25.070> them<00:04:54.310> ridiculous

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:56.050 
and just hold it in of them ridiculous

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:57.970 
and just hold it in of them ridiculous
so<00:04:57.050> I<00:04:57.110> usually<00:04:57.290> just<00:04:57.470> leave<00:04:57.770> it<00:04:57.860> on<00:04:57.920> the

00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:57.980 
so I usually just leave it on the

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.460 
so I usually just leave it on the
counter
