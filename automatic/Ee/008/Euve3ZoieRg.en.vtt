another one of our new line lives
italian-made<00:02:56.370> it's<00:02:57.240> called<00:02:57.540> the<00:02:57.630> tripwire

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
italian-made it's called the tripwire

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:00.110 
italian-made it's called the tripwire
basically<00:02:58.860> it's<00:02:59.040> a<00:02:59.130> multi-tool

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
basically it's a multi-tool

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.710 
basically it's a multi-tool
so<00:03:00.840> it<00:03:01.200> has<00:03:01.470> a<00:03:01.740> glass<00:03:02.040> breaker<00:03:02.570> it's<00:03:03.570> got<00:03:03.690> a

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:03.720 
so it has a glass breaker it's got a

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:05.870 
so it has a glass breaker it's got a

this<00:03:10.250> patented<00:03:11.250> feature<00:03:11.550> here<00:03:12.030> right<00:03:12.600> there

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
this patented feature here right there

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.830 
this patented feature here right there
it's<00:03:12.960> got<00:03:13.080> a<00:03:13.110> wire<00:03:13.380> cutter<00:03:13.710> so<00:03:14.160> we<00:03:15.090> designed<00:03:15.690> it

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
it's got a wire cutter so we designed it

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.380 
it's got a wire cutter so we designed it
so<00:03:15.870> it<00:03:16.020> have<00:03:16.380> the<00:03:16.560> capacity<00:03:17.340> to<00:03:17.550> cut<00:03:17.970> training

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
so it have the capacity to cut training

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.030 
so it have the capacity to cut training
pencil<00:03:18.780> to<00:03:18.840> show<00:03:19.050> you<00:03:19.110> know

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:27.949 

it<00:03:24.040> cuts<00:03:24.550> right<00:03:24.700> through<00:03:24.760> the<00:03:25.000> chain-link

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:30.500 

so<00:03:28.379> that's<00:03:28.590> that's<00:03:29.459> the<00:03:29.760> best<00:03:29.909> a<00:03:30.150> new<00:03:30.299> life

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
so that's that's the best a new life

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.640 
so that's that's the best a new life
