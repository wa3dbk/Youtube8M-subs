just<00:00:42.210> washed<00:00:42.660> it<00:00:42.899> that's<00:00:43.079> why<00:00:43.230> it's<00:00:43.379> a<00:00:43.410> little

00:00:43.959 --> 00:00:43.969 
just washed it that's why it's a little

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:46.400 
just washed it that's why it's a little
it<00:00:44.969> seems<00:00:45.180> a<00:00:45.270> little<00:00:45.390> heavier<00:00:45.870> than<00:00:45.899> normal

like<00:01:21.030> I<00:01:21.119> said<00:01:21.180> I<00:01:21.360> had<00:01:21.600> twisted<00:01:21.810> his<00:01:22.170> hair<00:01:22.500> I<00:01:22.770> had

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
like I said I had twisted his hair I had

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.310 
like I said I had twisted his hair I had
dipped<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.090> ends<00:01:24.509> to<00:01:24.689> do<00:01:24.780> like<00:01:24.900> a<00:01:24.990> corkscrew

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
dipped the ends to do like a corkscrew

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.340 
dipped the ends to do like a corkscrew
method<00:01:25.680> I<00:01:25.770> didn't<00:01:25.979> like<00:01:26.130> it<00:01:26.990> because<00:01:27.990> it<00:01:28.200> looks

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
method I didn't like it because it looks

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:29.840

stringy because I don't have any hair on

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.539 
stringy because I don't have any hair on
the<00:01:30.060> sides<00:01:30.270> in<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.479> back<00:01:30.750> but<00:01:31.710> even<00:01:32.250> after<00:01:32.400> I

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
the sides in the back but even after I

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.060 
the sides in the back but even after I
manipulated<00:01:33.150> it<00:01:33.390> I<00:01:33.659> was<00:01:34.380> able<00:01:34.500> to<00:01:34.619> take<00:01:34.829> it<00:01:34.950> out

manipulated it I was able to take it out
and<00:01:35.220> produce<00:01:35.400> this<00:01:35.759> look<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.299> then<00:01:37.229> I<00:01:37.740> added

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
and produce this look and then I added

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.460 
and produce this look and then I added
some<00:01:38.670> new<00:01:39.060> strands<00:01:39.420> in<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.600> back<00:01:39.869> to<00:01:40.170> filling

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
some new strands in the back to filling

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:41.539 
some new strands in the back to filling
because<00:01:40.530> I<00:01:40.680> kind<00:01:40.890> of<00:01:40.950> went<00:01:41.100> a<00:01:41.159> little<00:01:41.250> scissor

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
because I kind of went a little scissor

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.780 
because I kind of went a little scissor
happy<00:01:41.880> my<00:01:42.030> first<00:01:42.270> date<00:01:42.560> styling<00:01:43.560> it<00:01:43.790> added

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
happy my first date styling it added

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.880 
happy my first date styling it added
some<00:01:44.939> new<00:01:45.090> pieces<00:01:45.329> in<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.570> back<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:46.049> twisted

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
some new pieces in the back and twisted

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.260 
some new pieces in the back and twisted
that<00:01:47.009> and<00:01:47.280> I<00:01:47.340> think<00:01:47.520> I<00:01:47.610> took<00:01:47.790> them<00:01:47.939> out<00:01:48.060> maybe

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
that and I think I took them out maybe

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.960 
that and I think I took them out maybe
five<00:01:48.630> hours<00:01:48.659> later<00:01:49.259> and<00:01:49.649> it<00:01:50.399> was<00:01:50.490> pretty<00:01:50.729> much

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
five hours later and it was pretty much

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.929 
five hours later and it was pretty much
the<00:01:51.899> same<00:01:52.079> as<00:01:52.290> this<00:01:52.520> so<00:01:53.520> you<00:01:53.610> don't<00:01:53.729> even<00:01:53.850> have

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
the same as this so you don't even have

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.490 
the same as this so you don't even have
the<00:01:54.000> twisting<00:01:54.390> like<00:01:54.540> overnight<00:01:54.810> it<00:01:55.200> could<00:01:55.320> be

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
the twisting like overnight it could be

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.200 
the twisting like overnight it could be
within<00:01:55.649> a<00:01:55.740> day<00:01:55.920> but<00:01:56.460> overnight<00:01:56.759> will<00:01:57.030> produce

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
within a day but overnight will produce

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.480 
within a day but overnight will produce
tighter<00:01:57.600> results<00:01:58.079> but<00:01:58.259> nonetheless<00:01:59.189> you

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
tighter results but nonetheless you

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.850 
tighter results but nonetheless you
could<00:01:59.610> still<00:01:59.820> have<00:02:00.000> a<00:02:00.259> somewhat<00:02:01.259> of<00:02:01.380> a<00:02:01.409> pattern

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
could still have a somewhat of a pattern

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.340 
could still have a somewhat of a pattern
if<00:02:02.070> you<00:02:02.159> twist<00:02:02.310> it<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.549> same<00:02:02.729> day<00:02:02.939> so<00:02:03.840> I<00:02:04.079> really

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
if you twist it the same day so I really

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.539 
if you twist it the same day so I really
like<00:02:04.500> this<00:02:04.649> hair

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
like this hair

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.330 
like this hair
I<00:02:06.110> think<00:02:07.110> maybe<00:02:07.290> my<00:02:07.380> scalp<00:02:07.740> was<00:02:07.860> also<00:02:08.039> able<00:02:08.160> to

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
I think maybe my scalp was also able to

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.510 
I think maybe my scalp was also able to
because<00:02:08.520> I<00:02:08.580> had<00:02:08.759> to<00:02:08.910> braid<00:02:09.539> it<00:02:09.690> extreme

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
because I had to braid it extreme

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.460 
because I had to braid it extreme
tight<00:02:10.790> because<00:02:11.420> my<00:02:11.570> hair<00:02:11.750> is<00:02:11.780> short<00:02:12.140> you<00:02:12.380> could

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
tight because my hair is short you could

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:13.720 
tight because my hair is short you could
see<00:02:12.590> from<00:02:12.740> my<00:02:12.800> other<00:02:12.920> videos<00:02:13.040> that<00:02:13.370> my<00:02:13.460> hair<00:02:13.610> is

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:37.480 
condition the hair before you even put

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:40.230 
condition the hair before you even put
it<00:05:37.600> in<00:05:37.750> while<00:05:38.260> still<00:05:38.620> bound<00:05:38.950> up<00:05:39.220> together<00:05:39.430> so

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240 
it in while still bound up together so

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.630 
it in while still bound up together so
you<00:05:40.330> don't<00:05:40.360> have<00:05:40.800> losing<00:05:41.800> hair<00:05:42.040> and<00:05:42.340> strands

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:42.640

you don't have losing hair and strands
and<00:05:42.790> things<00:05:42.940> like<00:05:43.030> that<00:05:43.090> while<00:05:43.480> it's<00:05:43.600> still

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:45.540 
and things like that while it's still
bound<00:05:43.990> up<00:05:44.200> you<00:05:44.350> could<00:05:44.740> probably<00:05:44.890> dip<00:05:45.220> it<00:05:45.370> or

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:45.550 
bound up you could probably dip it or

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:47.550

um crochet braids are just so much
easier<00:06:03.610> for<00:06:04.120> me<00:06:04.270> because<00:06:04.660> it<00:06:05.020> doesn't<00:06:05.260> take

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:05.410 
easier for me because it doesn't take

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:09.780 
easier for me because it doesn't take
that<00:06:05.440> long<00:06:05.680> and<00:06:07.410> it's<00:06:08.410> easy<00:06:08.800> to<00:06:08.980> maintain<00:06:09.160> and

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:15.600 
that long and it's easy to maintain and
it<00:06:10.800> maintains<00:06:11.800> the<00:06:12.040> look<00:06:12.430> of<00:06:13.590> the<00:06:14.590> style<00:06:14.920> for<00:06:15.550> a

00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:15.610 
it maintains the look of the style for a

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:18.000 
it maintains the look of the style for a
long<00:06:15.850> time<00:06:16.150> and<00:06:16.540> the<00:06:17.050> older<00:06:17.380> it<00:06:17.500> gets<00:06:17.680> the

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:18.010 
long time and the older it gets the

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:20.010
