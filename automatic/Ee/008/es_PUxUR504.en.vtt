00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 hello markus here from markus fotos.de 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.330
 if your own folk is always from 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.250
 same motive or one always 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.480
 again uses the same techniques asks 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.410
 As a photographer you have fast 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.570
 occurs on the spot 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.790
 the fast successes you get in the beginning 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.090
 The photographic career had the 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.470
 let go very quickly and then fly 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.480
 also fast the motivation is one 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.920
 even the camera attacks in 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.380
 I would like to give you five tips on this video 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.680
 give as you find new inspiration 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.680
 can 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:35.290
 boredom arises 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.450
 So it's the easiest of the usual 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.100
 pattern break out as a portrait photographer 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.360
 For example, you should just do something 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.580
 Try something else and see 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.680
 Landscapes photograph or macros 

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.540
 or street photography actually completely 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.280
 No matter the main thing you do something different 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.080
 than what you usually do if you 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.370
 landscape photographer since why not 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:53.379
 also make some process 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:55.059
 that too can help my new way 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:57.480
 view of the photograph too 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:57.480
 to get 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:02.120
 tip 2 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:04.070
 Scouting is a good option 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.670
 discovering something new is easy too 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:05.899
 to travel 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.729
 they do not have to do that right away 

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:09.619
 Maldives will be perfect 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:11.630
 the camera in the closer environment 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:13.790
 drive main thing to a place on the 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.049
 we usually are not so not 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.240
 take the typical way to work 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:19.369
 but just the case on the 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.100
 Throwing a map and looking something like that 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:24.259
 radius of perhaps 50 to 60 kilometers around 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.330
 a place of residence is the advantage it 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:28.310
 is that while he is with the strip 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.679
 the camera also know new places 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.479
 learn her for later photo projects 

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:34.460
 you could use this way you can 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:36.830
 you a map of backgrounds 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.690
 environments and sceneries create her 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:41.259
 then use it specifically in photo projects 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.259
 can 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.159
 look at other photos and 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.710
 if necessary copy is actually 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:50.000
 have not always been wrong in the 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.770
 art the students of the big ones 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.180
 learned why should we do that 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.750
 do not do that in photography either 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:59.090
 if you copy a picture you get 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.860
 relatively good insight into what's in your head 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.119
 the photographer has done that 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:03.799
 picture origin did not do which 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:05.869
 ideas he had and what problems he had 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:07.759
 maybe this is the one encountered 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:09.709
 process of copying come one 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:11.599
 mostly very own ideas how to 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:12.950
 this photo and maybe improve 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:16.130
 can change and that too is again 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.510
 a creative process if he is such a 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:19.370
 photo after poses and if necessary 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.780
 uploaded again and so on 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.910
 it's nice, of course 

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.100
 to be identified and named 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.350
 from whom the original idea came 

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.970
 and maybe it's even a good one 

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.350
 Idea the original photographer 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:31.819
 link to your picture to send and to 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.530
 Hey, that's what I got out of your idea 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:35.720
 made or based on your idea 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.830
 what do you think of it maybe one 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:40.220
 possibility a whole new one 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:42.049
 interesting contact to make us 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.390
 inspirations easily with the 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:46.190
 website can find 500 px I can show 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.480
 you in a separate video me 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.370
 just link this here 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.600
 if he is traveling with the mobile device 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:52.070
 You look at the video 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.130
 description also there is the 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:54.130
 link 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.490
 to 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.170
 because as a lone fighter you do not come 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:03.180
 very far the cooperation with others 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:05.400
 creates new insights opportunities 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.080
 you never alone as an example 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.209
 it could be that the one photographer 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.220
 a great location on the hand has the 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:12.959
 next one has the mad model and one 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.160
 maybe you have exactly the right one 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:15.540
 Props I need to get that 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.700
 to take a perfect picture 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:20.190
 so why do not you do it together? 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.990
 and jointly create a factory it has 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.820
 then you end up not only great photos 

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:25.590
 you have a crazy funny 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.270
 usually in the afternoon and you have 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.530
 new contacts are made 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:29.459
 maybe even for the next project 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.350
 can use again 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:33.420
 So it makes perfect sense of time 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:35.910
 to take time to take a photographer 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.440
 a source where such things take place 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.510
 for example, the diary of the 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.430
 fotocommunity and then 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.150
 I position you a link in the 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:44.150
 video description 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:50.540
 fifth starter a series himself 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.280
 to set limits in which one 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.590
 For example , you can take pictures 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.270
 the theme of the series makes it easier 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.140
 to focus on this topic 

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:00.140
 because you do not have that many anymore 

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.640
 Opportunities now has in the spring or 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:03.470
 Even in autumn, the time is long 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:06.800
 shadow could be a potential topic 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:08.330
 for example, be shadow and that 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.250
 The goal of the whole would not be then 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.780
 more of a motive to photograph yourself 

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.489
 but only the shadow it throws 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:16.010
 and of course as artistically as possible 

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:17.570
 and appealing another option 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:19.459
 for a project or a series would be 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:20.780
 For example, signs for love in 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:23.180
 to find a big city 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:25.520
 that means to go around and 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:27.290
 For example, after picture of rings 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.330
 to look for or shape the 

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:31.390
 collectively a heart or 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.760
 just hands-holding couple 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:36.440
 Graffiti There are a thousand possibilities 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:38.030
 just as an example of such series 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:39.590
 you can then the whole course 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:41.240
 re- network with others and share 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.639
 discuss and that's a good one again 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.919
 possibility to make new contacts 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:47.479
 blame this limitation on a topic 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:49.400
 In any case, the eye and vectors 

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:51.110
 hunt and that is not too 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:53.169
 underestimate as a factor for the 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.310
 motivation 

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:57.169
 as a last tip maybe that 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:58.669
 most importantly , not yourself 

00:04:57.169 --> 00:05:00.620
 very under pressure but tried 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:02.180
 just have fun with the photography 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:04.190
 because only then you really want 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:05.180
 one to grab the camera to go out 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:06.979
 to take pictures 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.180
 I hope the video has you 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:10.190
 helped a bit and fell 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:12.020
 if so motivates me a bit 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:13.610
 in that he thumbs up his thumb 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.260
 press and if you have not already done so 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:16.910
 I subscribed to the channel 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.500
 I thank you for watching and me 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:20.650
 I'm looking forward to the next video until then 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:20.650
 bye
