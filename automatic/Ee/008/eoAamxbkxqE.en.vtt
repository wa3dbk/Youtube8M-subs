 of thistle of cultivation 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:37.240
 we make a cut to the chestnuts and 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.240
 we cook for 10 minutes 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:48.079
 We last the chicken in a little oil 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.079
 we have used for the campero 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.239
 once cooked we peel the chestnuts 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.240
 it is much easier to do it when still 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:03.730
 they are hot 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:03.730
 careful before I know yes 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:07.920

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.760
 we add the chestnuts to the powder 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.880

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.610
 the artichokes in sheets do not forget 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.689
 put them in water with lemon or parsley 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.689
 so they do not rust 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.710
 we fry them seasoned and 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.710
 we reserve 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:29.530
 We look at the chicken while you gravy 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.530
 ends to reduce 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.840

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.840
 of the liver 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.300
 saute the mushrooms before assembly 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.359
 and you can add a little garlic to the 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.359
 end of cooking 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:23.709
 we will use a swim to ride the timbale 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.709
 filling it with the chicken mixture 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.930
 we have to press a little 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:36.290
 so that then anguita is not dismantled 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.290
 of the hoop 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:54.050
 once we have it, we draw a line 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:54.050
 with the sauce 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.140
 we accompany with the mushrooms 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:12.340
 and we put the crispy artichoke 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.340
