00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:34.859 
all good looking it'll picked up but

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:39.979 
all good looking it'll picked up but
better<00:03:36.470> it<00:03:37.470> has<00:03:37.620> a<00:03:37.650> change<00:03:38.359> speech<00:03:39.359> tool<00:03:39.750> off

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989

on<00:03:40.489> XY<00:03:41.489> I<00:03:42.049> didn't<00:03:43.049> know<00:03:43.109> what<00:03:43.230> that<00:03:43.350> was<00:03:43.410> but<00:03:43.620> I

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
on XY I didn't know what that was but I

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.849 
on XY I didn't know what that was but I
used<00:03:44.430> it<00:03:44.670> and<00:03:45.019> what<00:03:46.019> I<00:03:46.049> found<00:03:46.380> out<00:03:46.620> is<00:03:46.680> that

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:46.859 
used it and what I found out is that

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:49.900 
used it and what I found out is that
means<00:03:47.160> you<00:03:47.310> can<00:03:47.489> cost<00:03:47.790> in<00:03:48.180> the<00:03:48.299> game<00:03:48.480> bad<00:03:49.380> words

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:49.910 
means you can cost in the game bad words

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:52.310

and<00:03:50.910> stuff<00:03:51.299> like<00:03:51.420> that<00:03:51.480> but<00:03:51.630> it<00:03:51.900> won't<00:03:52.109> block

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:52.320 
and stuff like that but it won't block

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.550 
and stuff like that but it won't block
it<00:03:53.120> instead<00:03:54.120> what<00:03:54.540> happens<00:03:54.930> is<00:03:55.079> when<00:03:55.230> you<00:03:55.350> say

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
it instead what happens is when you say

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.740

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
what happens is that I walk around doing

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.490
