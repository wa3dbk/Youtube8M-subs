00:00:45.339 --> 00:00:50.260
 machine with some partition I 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:52.540

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:56.680

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:58.300
 Coming family collection of the tok believed and 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.489

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:05.710

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.899
 part of watch movie I wanted to do 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.789
 this little box started like that something to me 

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:14.979
 that I saw it is made in a box 

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:16.210
 An old dresser, I do not 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:18.520

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.080
 Internet 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:25.630
 I made a hole here with a drill 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.580
 and I took in my house an old handle 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.899
 that I had wood so now he 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.509

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:33.670
 same old and there inside that drawer 

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:36.729
 with those with these papers from my 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.979

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:40.750
 there you can put the opel 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:42.280
 I sewed here also with the machine 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.140

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.240
 cutting the small piece of paper 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.780
 and then you can put a piece of 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:52.090

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:12.459

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:16.800
 my side the hearts all i used 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.840
 here it is 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.760
 It's just you and I put a paper there. 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.100
 red color has several hearts and if 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.920
 You can choose the design I sewed. 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:28.950
 some put the stickers 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.500

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.030
 Are you seeing with your little heart and then you? 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.650
 it's hard filling you can put 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.130
 how many chips do you want I created this 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:40.710
 with the height collection clock as well 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.900
 can be met for all 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:44.430
 colors and even different formats 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.830
 also 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:49.680
 how much more is different you 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:51.870
 create the coolest phishings goes 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.420
 stay sealed your mini album and I left 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.530
 ones out so I found that with 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.410
 legal effect 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.780
 So this is the idea of ​​our 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.510
 old box with the right even ceg 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:05.130
 opinion for the power to heal this little box 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.410
 on the bottom 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.420
 I cut pieces of cement from my 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:13.110
 collection to show you need 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.220
 I cut a few pieces of 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.200
 movie 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.750
 some small pieces here 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.580
 watches and I stay I passed an ink 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.260
 that I'm going to show and I'm watching a 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.300
 little bit of not investing all 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:27.360
 remote control that I was just putting 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:29.220
 some little things around or 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.480
 here I put two clocks apart 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:34.560
 wing 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:36.630
 here in front also this aged 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.400
 that you are seeing is a 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:41.190
 Very cool product, I really liked it. 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.560
 working with this habit bitumen lap 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:46.560
 acrilex it there are several things in 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.730
 red and blue in silver I really liked it 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.220
 this color 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:52.410
 I applied with a sponge then gave 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:55.050
 to work here in this house 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:56.880
 Aged then it is not that face that I 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:59.520
 I really wanted an old drawer 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.140
 movie to the remote control port and then I 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:03.930
 I'll show you how I did it. 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.489
 I'm going to sew on this machine. 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.170
 sew one of the tags 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:10.260
 I already have two family photos 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.970
 here and this machine is the 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.230
 science there is an infinity of 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:15.659
 machines 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.949
 have at home can use only have a point 

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:18.840
 different 

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:22.049
 I choose her point down here. 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:25.110
 in these drawings and then I dial the number 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:26.370
 that I want and I went with you is to do the 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.449
 The drawing I make will choose one 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:33.479
 easy here a world that looks like a 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:35.760
 phone the number 23 and it will look like 

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:37.889
 It was a telephone and I will spend the seam 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:40.260
 that on paper I really like to sew 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:43.220
 the paper with the machine so I think it gives 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.220
 a very cool effect 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:47.600
 the loose animal is proud of me again until 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:49.130
 It's good to see you 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.790
 it's easy to put 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:56.130
 the line of this brand 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:56.130
 the character is just following the little boxes 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:03.580
 and the machines of today are a beauty right? 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:06.460
 because neither the thread in the needle but the people 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:13.980
 Just put squid, you're leaving everything. 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:13.980
 ready to put it back 

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:22.700
 now it's just you do not leave one 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:24.860
 speed too fast too fast 

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:27.260
 same is to leave a speed with 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:29.300
 care that paper 

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:31.820
 ripped can not break down is not with 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:38.200
 The diseased tissue accounts for more than 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:38.200
 careful but the effect looks very beautiful 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:58.450
 even more so that I used a bad bread one 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:01.270
 agent is using a green ribbon with a 

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:04.530
 red line on the black paper that 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:04.530
 You'll see how beautiful it is. 

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:16.979
 on the machine itself on a 

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:16.979
 cut here stayed 

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:23.980
 and you can spend as much as the seams 

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:26.980
 You want me when I do the 

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:28.750
 page I heard the test rules of kidney support 

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:30.520
 back and went on double-sided tape 

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:32.140
 as we can not do this here 

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:34.060
 because the chips are loose there 

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:36.240
 people will have to cut and then 

00:06:34.060 --> 00:06:39.730
 Pretty careful you pass a hive 

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:42.340
 in the corner of the ribbon here to 

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:44.680
 it gets firmer and you can pass 

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:47.050
 more culture if you want and 

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:49.960
 fits your chips here with the 

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:52.790
 people who live in the house for you 

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:56.720
 also his mini album 

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:56.720
 difficult to decorate 

00:07:06.679 --> 00:07:11.549
 I hope you enjoyed this 

00:07:09.149 --> 00:07:13.289
 class is something different is also a 

00:07:11.549 --> 00:07:15.059
 recycling-like environment that had 

00:07:13.289 --> 00:07:16.979
 in the old drawer even better 

00:07:15.059 --> 00:07:19.559
