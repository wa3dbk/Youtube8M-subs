so<00:00:00.480> you<00:00:00.539> want<00:00:00.690> to<00:00:00.719> turn<00:00:00.900> your<00:00:01.230> Raspberry<00:00:01.920> Pi

00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:01.949 
so you want to turn your Raspberry Pi

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:03.530 
so you want to turn your Raspberry Pi
into<00:00:02.310> a<00:00:02.370> thin<00:00:02.639> client<00:00:02.939> to<00:00:03.120> be<00:00:03.179> able<00:00:03.300> to<00:00:03.360> connect

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:03.540 
into a thin client to be able to connect

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.280 
into a thin client to be able to connect
to<00:00:03.570> the<00:00:03.659> Windows<00:00:04.020> server<00:00:04.440> maybe<00:00:05.160> Windows<00:00:05.609> 8

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:06.290 
to the Windows server maybe Windows 8

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.740 
to the Windows server maybe Windows 8
maybe<00:00:07.290> even<00:00:07.529> Windows<00:00:07.830> 7<00:00:08.220> well<00:00:08.880> today<00:00:09.179> ontology

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
maybe even Windows 7 well today ontology

maybe even Windows 7 well today ontology
evolution<00:00:10.230> wouldn't<00:00:10.590> were<00:00:10.679> showing<00:00:10.889> you<00:00:11.070> just

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400 
evolution wouldn't were showing you just

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.669 
evolution wouldn't were showing you just
how<00:00:11.550> to<00:00:11.639> do<00:00:11.910> that<00:00:12.030> so<00:00:12.210> stay<00:00:12.389> tuned<00:00:12.660> as<00:00:13.259> we<00:00:13.500> are

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
how to do that so stay tuned as we are

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:20.450 
how to do that so stay tuned as we are
jump<00:00:13.860> over<00:00:14.040> to<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:14.190> Raspberry<00:00:14.519> Pi<00:00:19.310> so<00:00:20.310> now

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
jump over to the Raspberry Pi so now

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.759 
jump over to the Raspberry Pi so now
we're<00:00:20.609> on<00:00:20.730> to<00:00:20.880> the<00:00:21.029> Raspberry<00:00:21.660> Pi<00:00:21.689> to<00:00:22.560> create

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
we're on to the Raspberry Pi to create

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.380 
we're on to the Raspberry Pi to create
into<00:00:23.010> a<00:00:23.039> thin<00:00:23.310> client<00:00:23.640> you<00:00:23.939> need<00:00:24.000> to<00:00:24.060> open<00:00:24.300> up

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
into a thin client you need to open up

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.529 
into a thin client you need to open up
the<00:00:24.510> LX<00:00:24.840> terminal<00:00:25.670> and<00:00:26.670> then<00:00:26.760> from<00:00:27.029> here<00:00:27.060> you

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
the LX terminal and then from here you

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.689 
the LX terminal and then from here you
need<00:00:27.900> to<00:00:28.050> get<00:00:28.230> to<00:00:28.439> a<00:00:28.470> super<00:00:28.920> user<00:00:29.039> by<00:00:29.369> typing

carry all the operation it will say this

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.350 
carry all the operation it will say this
will<00:00:49.200> take<00:00:49.350> so<00:00:49.620> many<00:00:49.680> bytes<00:00:50.120> megabytes<00:00:51.120> do<00:00:51.300> you

remove that line remove it and then from
your<00:01:02.430> server<00:01:02.730> that<00:01:02.879> you've<00:01:03.059> already<00:01:03.149> got<00:01:03.390> all

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
your server that you've already got all

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.270 
your server that you've already got all
your<00:01:03.600> desktop<00:01:04.049> you<00:01:04.680> need<00:01:04.830> to<00:01:04.920> know<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.159> IP

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
your desktop you need to know the IP

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.240 
your desktop you need to know the IP
address<00:01:05.790> so<00:01:06.420> mine's<00:01:06.659> an<00:01:06.810> internal<00:01:07.260> one<00:01:07.350> so<00:01:08.189> you

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
address so mine's an internal one so you

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:15.950 
address so mine's an internal one so you
type<00:01:08.670> our<00:01:09.080> desktop<00:01:11.600> 192<00:01:12.600> 168<00:01:13.200> 0<00:01:14.040> to<00:01:14.820> 9<00:01:15.060> this<00:01:15.780> is

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
type our desktop 192 168 0 to 9 this is

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.039 
type our desktop 192 168 0 to 9 this is
my<00:01:16.110> internal<00:01:17.040> IP<00:01:17.340> address<00:01:17.850> and<00:01:18.090> then

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
my internal IP address and then

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.210 
my internal IP address and then
obviously<00:01:19.259> any<00:01:19.530> word<00:01:19.680> for<00:01:19.830> people<00:01:19.950> that<00:01:20.130> are

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
obviously any word for people that are

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.940 
obviously any word for people that are
connected<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.700> our<00:01:20.970> network<00:01:21.030> so<00:01:21.869> what's<00:01:22.799> done

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
connected to our network so what's done

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.460 
connected to our network so what's done
that<00:01:23.100> you'll<00:01:23.220> press<00:01:23.369> ENTER<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:24.200> you'll<00:01:25.200> find

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
that you'll press ENTER and you'll find

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.230 
that you'll press ENTER and you'll find
that<00:01:25.650> it<00:01:25.770> opens<00:01:26.070> up<00:01:26.189> ok<00:01:26.759> so<00:01:26.820> this<00:01:26.970> is<00:01:27.119> the

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
that it opens up ok so this is the

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.280 
that it opens up ok so this is the
server<00:01:27.479> here<00:01:27.780> but<00:01:28.650> if<00:01:29.340> you<00:01:29.549> press<00:01:30.290> bubble

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
connect a smart card and well there is

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.530 
connect a smart card and well there is
no<00:01:38.400> way<00:01:38.579> around<00:01:38.850> this<00:01:38.970> you<00:01:39.090> can't<00:01:39.270> look<00:01:39.360> in<00:01:39.479> the

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
no way around this you can't look in the

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.640 
no way around this you can't look in the
other<00:01:39.600> way<00:01:39.750> because<00:01:39.900> it'll<00:01:40.170> tell<00:01:40.290> you<00:01:40.380> to<00:01:40.500> use

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
other way because it'll tell you to use

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.679 
other way because it'll tell you to use
a<00:01:40.680> smart<00:01:41.159> card<00:01:41.840> so<00:01:42.840> you're<00:01:43.200> pretty<00:01:43.439> much<00:01:43.590> stuck

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:44.689 
a smart card so you're pretty much stuck

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:46.819 
a smart card so you're pretty much stuck
unless<00:01:45.689> you<00:01:45.869> don't<00:01:46.049> have<00:01:46.140> a<00:01:46.170> smart<00:01:46.439> card<00:01:46.680> but

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
unless you don't have a smart card but

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.240 
unless you don't have a smart card but
that<00:01:46.979> is<00:01:47.100> how<00:01:47.250> you<00:01:47.310> would<00:01:47.610> connect<00:01:49.009> so<00:01:50.009> to<00:01:50.070> get

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
that is how you would connect so to get

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.240 
that is how you would connect so to get
around<00:01:50.549> this<00:01:50.880> you<00:01:51.560> need<00:01:52.560> to<00:01:52.680> do<00:01:52.829> something

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
around this you need to do something

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.990 
around this you need to do something
called<00:01:53.549> gr<00:01:54.360> desktop<00:01:55.250> again<00:01:56.250> for<00:01:56.700> that<00:01:56.820> you

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
called gr desktop again for that you

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.620 
called gr desktop again for that you
type<00:01:57.360> in<00:01:57.540> install<00:01:58.460> now<00:01:59.460> you<00:01:59.520> want<00:01:59.790> you<00:02:00.420> type

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
type in install now you want you type
