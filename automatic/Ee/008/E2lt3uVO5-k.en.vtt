with<00:00:22.619> dslrs<00:00:23.250> a<00:00:23.550> few<00:00:23.760> lightweight<00:00:24.180> cameras

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
with dslrs a few lightweight cameras

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.290 
with dslrs a few lightweight cameras
like<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.109> old<00:00:25.380> panasonic<00:00:26.099> h<00:00:26.250> we<00:00:26.460> asked<00:00:26.760> to<00:00:26.849> 100

system<00:00:34.260> you<00:00:34.770> know<00:00:34.890> can<00:00:35.670> it<00:00:35.790> handle<00:00:35.969> big

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
system you know can it handle big

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.780 
system you know can it handle big
cameras<00:00:36.719> so<00:00:37.500> it<00:00:37.680> took<00:00:37.829> it<00:00:38.010> out<00:00:38.129> to<00:00:38.370> our<00:00:38.520> film

focus<00:00:55.440> you<00:00:56.070> know<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.340> whole<00:00:56.579> rig<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.180> we<00:00:57.629> did

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
focus you know the whole rig and we did

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.740 
focus you know the whole rig and we did
some<00:00:57.809> tests<00:00:58.350> of<00:00:58.649> how<00:00:59.370> our<00:00:59.399> camera<00:01:00.270> dolly<00:01:00.539> and

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
some tests of how our camera dolly and

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.470 
some tests of how our camera dolly and
slider<00:01:01.020> system<00:01:01.530> can<00:01:01.770> handle<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.370> way<00:01:02.520> we<00:01:03.210> set

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
slider system can handle the way we set

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.840 
slider system can handle the way we set
it<00:01:03.510> up<00:01:03.719> as<00:01:03.899> an<00:01:04.049> orbital<00:01:04.589> lolly<00:01:04.830> in<00:01:05.129> a<00:01:05.250> compact

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
it up as an orbital lolly in a compact

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.140 
it up as an orbital lolly in a compact
configuration<00:01:06.270> and<00:01:07.200> attach<00:01:08.040> the<00:01:08.250> t-bar<00:01:08.729> so<00:01:09.000> it

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
configuration and attach the t-bar so it

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.550 
configuration and attach the t-bar so it
could<00:01:09.330> be<00:01:09.360> pushed<00:01:09.810> and<00:01:09.960> pulled<00:01:10.229> in<00:01:10.380> any

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
could be pushed and pulled in any

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.039 
could be pushed and pulled in any
direction<00:01:10.740> it<00:01:11.580> was<00:01:11.729> great<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.510> guys<00:01:12.720> that<00:01:12.750> the

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
direction it was great the guys that the

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:14.840 
direction it was great the guys that the
film<00:01:13.260> institute<00:01:13.740> couldn't<00:01:14.130> believe<00:01:14.580> how

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
film institute couldn't believe how

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.240 
film institute couldn't believe how
smooth<00:01:15.240> it<00:01:15.390> flow<00:01:15.689> and<00:01:15.930> how<00:01:16.229> stable<00:01:16.619> that<00:01:16.890> huge

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
smooth it flow and how stable that huge

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.300 
smooth it flow and how stable that huge
rig<00:01:17.549> was<00:01:17.790> on<00:01:17.970> top<00:01:18.210> of<00:01:18.240> our<00:01:18.810> tabletop<00:01:19.290> or<00:01:19.770> Batali

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
rig was on top of our tabletop or Batali

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.030 
rig was on top of our tabletop or Batali
they<00:01:21.119> thought<00:01:21.450> it<00:01:21.659> might<00:01:21.810> trip<00:01:22.140> over<00:01:22.320> they

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
they thought it might trip over they

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.609 
they thought it might trip over they
even<00:01:23.340> tried<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:23.880> push<00:01:24.150> it<00:01:24.180> over<00:01:24.689> but<00:01:25.110> it<00:01:25.259> stood

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
even tried to push it over but it stood

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.039 
even tried to push it over but it stood
solid<00:01:26.220> on<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.520> ground<00:01:26.790> as<00:01:27.000> you<00:01:27.390> can<00:01:27.570> see<00:01:27.840> in

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
solid on the ground as you can see in

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.469 
solid on the ground as you can see in
this<00:01:28.290> video<00:01:28.470> well<00:01:28.979> guys<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.939> cam<00:01:30.210> dolly

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
this video well guys the cam dolly

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.690 
this video well guys the cam dolly
system<00:01:30.930> is<00:01:31.079> lightweight<00:01:31.590> only<00:01:32.280> in<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.520> sense

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
system is lightweight only in the sense

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.179 
system is lightweight only in the sense
that<00:01:32.850> one<00:01:33.210> person<00:01:33.630> alone<00:01:33.750> can<00:01:34.140> carry<00:01:34.470> and<00:01:34.770> one

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
that one person alone can carry and one

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.370 
that one person alone can carry and one
person<00:01:35.640> alone<00:01:35.700> can<00:01:36.090> set<00:01:36.390> it<00:01:36.509> up<00:01:36.600> in<00:01:36.810> about<00:01:36.900> five

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
person alone can set it up in about five

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.370 
person alone can set it up in about five
minutes<00:01:37.860> in<00:01:38.100> just<00:01:38.369> about<00:01:38.610> any<00:01:38.850> configuration

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
minutes in just about any configuration

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.920 
minutes in just about any configuration
but<00:01:40.380> it's<00:01:40.979> not<00:01:41.549> lightweight<00:01:41.970> in<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.600> sense

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
but it's not lightweight in the sense

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.440 
but it's not lightweight in the sense
that<00:01:43.079> it<00:01:43.350> can<00:01:43.530> carry<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:44.220> superbly<00:01:44.909> handle

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
that it can carry and superbly handle

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.630 
that it can carry and superbly handle
the<00:01:45.540> heaviest<00:01:45.899> cameras<00:01:46.409> like<00:01:46.649> fully<00:01:47.220> Regan

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
the heaviest cameras like fully Regan

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.210 
the heaviest cameras like fully Regan
Alexa<00:01:48.060> cameras<00:01:48.509> rad<00:01:48.960> cameras<00:01:49.470> and<00:01:49.680> so<00:01:49.829> on<00:01:49.979> oh

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.120 
Alexa cameras rad cameras and so on oh
and<00:01:50.820> it's<00:01:51.509> also<00:01:51.810> lightweight<00:01:52.200> as<00:01:52.619> far<00:01:52.860> as<00:01:53.009> the

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
and it's also lightweight as far as the

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.780
