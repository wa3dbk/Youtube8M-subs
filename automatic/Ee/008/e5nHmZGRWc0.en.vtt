00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.470 
they showed us said big news tomorrow
Thursday<00:05:07.200> februari<00:05:07.800> the<00:05:07.920> sixth<00:05:08.340> so<00:05:08.850> I<00:05:08.880> would

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:09.480 
Thursday februari the sixth so I would

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:10.370 
Thursday februari the sixth so I would
assume<00:05:09.570> that<00:05:09.750> they're<00:05:09.960> not<00:05:10.080> going<00:05:10.200> to<00:05:10.260> just

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380 
assume that they're not going to just

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.740 
assume that they're not going to just
show<00:05:10.590> more<00:05:10.800> gameplay<00:05:11.160> at<00:05:11.550> the<00:05:11.700> gun<00:05:12.090> obviously

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 
show more gameplay at the gun obviously

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.770 
show more gameplay at the gun obviously
I<00:05:12.780> think<00:05:12.960> they're<00:05:13.080> gonna<00:05:13.170> show<00:05:13.470> the<00:05:14.280> fool<00:05:14.610> on

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:18.110 
I think they're gonna show the fool on
