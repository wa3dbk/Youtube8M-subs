piston<00:00:35.460> door<00:00:35.610> I<00:00:36.800> think<00:00:37.800> it<00:00:37.950> was<00:00:38.040> broken<00:00:38.610> for

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
piston door I think it was broken for

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.200 
piston door I think it was broken for
some<00:00:39.270> reason<00:00:40.489> with<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.960> lot<00:00:42.960> with<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.379> update

like<00:01:19.380> it<00:01:19.500> did<00:01:19.619> this<00:01:19.799> um<00:01:20.189> this<00:01:20.549> is<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:20.880> 3<00:01:21.299> by<00:01:21.420> 3

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
like it did this um this is the 3 by 3

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.200 
like it did this um this is the 3 by 3
by<00:01:21.960> sandy<00:01:22.500> minecraft<00:01:23.009> so<00:01:23.759> you<00:01:23.850> start<00:01:24.150> with

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
by sandy minecraft so you start with

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.929 
by sandy minecraft so you start with
this<00:01:26.180> very<00:01:27.180> very<00:01:27.750> basic<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:28.619> then<00:01:29.579> you<00:01:29.729> move

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
this very very basic and then you move

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.090 
this very very basic and then you move
on<00:01:30.119> to<00:01:30.299> this<00:01:30.450> which<00:01:30.840> flicking<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.560> switch<00:01:31.590> is

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
on to this which flicking the switch is

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.859 
on to this which flicking the switch is
going<00:01:32.250> to<00:01:32.310> do<00:01:32.430> absolutely<00:01:32.670> nothing<00:01:32.970> this<00:01:33.720> is

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
going to do absolutely nothing this is

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.149 
going to do absolutely nothing this is
just<00:01:34.079> the<00:01:34.170> next<00:01:34.350> step<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:35.210> then<00:01:36.210> this<00:01:37.159> you

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
just the next step and then this you

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.670 
just the next step and then this you
have<00:01:38.250> a<00:01:38.310> button

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
have a button

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.420 
have a button
this<00:01:41.220> is<00:01:41.340> how<00:01:41.490> this<00:01:41.640> works<00:01:42.230> and<00:01:43.430> then

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
this is how this works and then

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.620 
this is how this works and then
obviously<00:01:44.940> yep<00:01:47.000> okay<00:01:48.000> so<00:01:48.270> that's<00:01:48.420> how<00:01:48.540> that

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
obviously yep okay so that's how that

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.300 
obviously yep okay so that's how that
works<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:49.110> then<00:01:49.260> basically<00:01:49.410> add<00:01:49.830> all<00:01:50.100> the

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
works and then basically add all the

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.790 
works and then basically add all the
stuff<00:01:50.550> around<00:01:50.700> it<00:01:51.060> after<00:01:51.330> that<00:01:51.480> and<00:01:54.440> yeah<00:01:55.440> we

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:55.800 
stuff around it after that and yeah we

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.420 
stuff around it after that and yeah we
have<00:01:55.890> invisible<00:01:56.190> blocks<00:01:56.700> because<00:01:57.600> my<00:01:58.020> leg<00:01:58.430> all

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
have invisible blocks because my leg all

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.219 
have invisible blocks because my leg all
right<00:01:59.610> and<00:01:59.729> then<00:01:59.850> basically<00:02:00.479> if<00:02:00.930> you<00:02:01.020> want<00:02:01.170> to

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
right and then basically if you want to

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.050 
right and then basically if you want to
put<00:02:01.350> it<00:02:01.410> all<00:02:01.530> together<00:02:01.680> this<00:02:02.310> button<00:02:02.700> doesn't

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
put it all together this button doesn't

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.120 
put it all together this button doesn't
work<00:02:03.119> because<00:02:03.540> I<00:02:03.840> don't<00:02:04.200> I<00:02:04.440> wasn't<00:02:04.770> sure<00:02:04.950> how

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
work because I don't I wasn't sure how

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.620 
work because I don't I wasn't sure how
to<00:02:05.160> connect<00:02:05.580> it<00:02:05.820> this<00:02:06.720> one<00:02:06.990> does<00:02:07.260> those<00:02:07.710> so

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
to connect it this one does those so

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.520 
to connect it this one does those so
yeah<00:02:10.520> yep<00:02:11.520> brate<00:02:12.150> like<00:02:12.300> that<00:02:12.480> and<00:02:13.260> then

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
yeah yep brate like that and then

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.000 
yeah yep brate like that and then
obviously<00:02:13.910> this<00:02:14.910> one<00:02:15.239> is<00:02:15.390> with<00:02:15.690> a<00:02:15.900> switch<00:02:16.650> and

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
obviously this one is with a switch and

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:24.830 
obviously this one is with a switch and
not<00:02:17.190> a<00:02:17.220> button<00:02:18.230> so<00:02:19.230> i<00:02:19.590> do<00:02:22.459> but<00:02:23.459> um<00:02:23.730> i<00:02:24.120> might<00:02:24.690> be

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840

piston door or vertical piston the word
that<00:02:41.160> he<00:02:41.340> made<00:02:41.610> smaller<00:02:42.030> than<00:02:42.330> mr<00:02:43.080> Wood<00:02:43.260> ste<00:02:43.500> he

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
that he made smaller than mr Wood ste he

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.180 
that he made smaller than mr Wood ste he
just<00:02:44.250> released<00:02:44.550> it<00:02:44.790> today<00:02:44.910> so<00:02:45.090> I<00:02:45.330> gotta<00:02:45.570> I

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:21.730 
because i was just kind of starting to

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:25.560 
because i was just kind of starting to
take<00:04:21.970> it<00:04:22.090> apart<00:04:22.360> and<00:04:23.220> look<00:04:24.220> at<00:04:24.340> things<00:04:24.610> and<00:04:24.850> see

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
take it apart and look at things and see

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:30.120 
take it apart and look at things and see
how<00:04:25.660> he's<00:04:25.930> doing<00:04:25.960> this<00:04:26.350> exactly<00:04:27.480> so<00:04:28.480> yeah<00:04:29.130> but

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
how he's doing this exactly so yeah but

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.490 
how he's doing this exactly so yeah but
