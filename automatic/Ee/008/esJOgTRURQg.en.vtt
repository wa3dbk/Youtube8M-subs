00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.260
 no 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:55.570
 recently the company so at gries college 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:58.690
 belongs to the group exel so summer 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:01.390
 bought back two months ago so for the 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:05.350
 condor marketing in France 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:07.509
 it is the company herriot who are responsible 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.340
 so of this part so with two 

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:12.909
 commercials myself and so Ã©ric 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.530
 michaud on the southern part of france for 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:18.340
 the northern part of France so it will be 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:20.170
 myself so this camera so it's a 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:22.000
 self-propelled sprayer that is 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.780
 available with three types of vats 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:30.490
 so in capacity of 3400 4000 or 5000 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:33.159
 liters at the chassis level we have three 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.750
 different types of chassis 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:37.569
 differentiates especially for 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:40.500
 uses first frame first he 

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:42.580
 this is a chassis having variable 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.220
 so from the doctor when to two meters 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:49.289
 25 our chassis including that its stabiles 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:53.440
 opus then a second chassis that him 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:56.549
 allows to increase the ground clearance so 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:59.140
 from ahmed 25 to 2 meters under chassis 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:02.740
 especially for crops such as 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:05.110
 corn to treat against the beetle 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:06.490
 is a third chassis that fit 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.340
 specialized crops like the apple 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.019
 of land which is the white stalking more 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.590
 which allows to get a way up 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:13.590
 too much will put 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:26.110
 so 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:27.640
 question more towards isation so these 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.670
 devices are available first 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:34.060
 in circulation continues function number 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:36.819
 that on the condor had that of bontin in 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.040
 piston diaphragm a third pump 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:41.319
 additional is available for 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.720
 filling especially for fertilizer 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:45.000
 liquid so a pump 708 minutes in 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.099
 centrifugal 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.310
 the particularity of this device is 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:54.730
 that we have zero bottom of tank thanks to a 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:58.450
 system so the positioning of pumps 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:00.250
 unpublished spray side and available 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.560
 also air injection buses that is 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.269
 the high tech airplus that allows 

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.090
 thanks to the over-control 

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:10.000
 so in the cabin to vary the size 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:13.019
 drops so directly on the 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.489
 electronic console more so in the cabin 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:16.720
 the air flow more than between them so 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:19.389
 it is a system between states but 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.950
 morges two windsocks that allows 

00:03:19.389 --> 00:03:22.420
 so to return the sheets of 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.689
 labeling for applications 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:28.540
 especially in fungicides 

00:03:24.689 --> 00:03:31.810
 so we have a fan system all 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:34.419
 the three meters that allows to have a 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.989
 blower frank and especially without loss 

00:03:34.419 --> 00:03:37.359
 charge 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:38.790
 we are left alone on the one 

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:41.530
 device on the market that offers that 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:44.620
 so to ensure a spray of the 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:46.780
 optimum fungicide so we're pretty 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.010
 important of the cabin so so as 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.510
 I said it earlier that includes 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:51.010
 so first of all the housing that allows 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:54.190
 to completely manage the device 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:56.139
 the chassis so in particular the widths 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.850
 of voice which is very important 

00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:59.320
 the case keeps 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:01.180
 in memory of the last four money 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:03.210
 voice also helps manage the 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:06.500
 spraying but also the advancement 

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:09.440
 the wheel modes knowing that he can 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:12.130
 operate in 4 th wheel director 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:14.540
 guidelines or crab walking 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:17.329
 the box also allows to manage the 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:19.810
 traction control system another housing 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:23.200
 so lets do the guiding barb 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:26.510
 but also is available on the device 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:29.390
 autoguiding the cutting of sections 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:31.730
 also including on the device which 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:34.370
 can be at the heart of sections all 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:36.050
 three meters to goal cuts by mu 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:41.210
 so knowing that we can climb so from 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:44.540
 24 51 meters almost 100 buses managed 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:45.590
 by the GPS so as you can 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:48.530
 to see behind me is a cabin 

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:50.800
 spacious so with a seat to 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:54.639
 air suspension a passenger seat 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:56.710
 but the portal motivations that is 

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:59.999
 regulate automatically and a 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:03.780
 continent behavior including friot 

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:03.780
 for the driver's drinks
