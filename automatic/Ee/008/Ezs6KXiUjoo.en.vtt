00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
probably won't use much but it's kind of

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.459 
probably won't use much but it's kind of
odd<00:00:08.370> that<00:00:08.639> it<00:00:08.820> will<00:00:08.940> actually<00:00:09.059> work<00:00:09.389> so<00:00:09.469> it's

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
odd that it will actually work so it's

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.940 
odd that it will actually work so it's
called<00:00:10.679> blower<00:00:11.010> and<00:00:12.259> basically<00:00:13.259> what<00:00:13.830> it<00:00:13.920> does

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
called blower and basically what it does

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.849 
called blower and basically what it does
is<00:00:14.309> actually<00:00:14.460> blows<00:00:14.910> air<00:00:15.150> out<00:00:15.179> of<00:00:15.360> your<00:00:15.630> iPhone
