00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
in my charger not anymore I took him out

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.539 
in my charger not anymore I took him out
right<00:00:12.570> away<00:00:12.660> because<00:00:13.410> I<00:00:13.440> was<00:00:14.130> getting<00:00:14.309> the

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
right away because I was getting the

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.910 
right away because I was getting the
flickering<00:00:15.000> problem<00:00:15.540> and<00:00:15.839> the<00:00:16.500> haricot

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
flickering problem and the haricot

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.920 
flickering problem and the haricot
problem<00:00:17.369> whatever<00:00:17.580> that<00:00:18.180> comes<00:00:18.480> with<00:00:18.720> the

problem whatever that comes with the
newer<00:00:19.109> Chargers<00:00:19.650> because<00:00:19.949> the<00:00:20.039> computer

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
newer Chargers because the computer

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.060 
newer Chargers because the computer
doesn't<00:00:21.210> recognize<00:00:21.689> hid<00:00:22.199> because<00:00:22.560> of<00:00:22.920> the

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
doesn't recognize hid because of the

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.189 
doesn't recognize hid because of the
temperature<00:00:23.550> they<00:00:23.730> burn<00:00:23.939> that<00:00:24.180> you<00:00:25.109> know

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
temperature they burn that you know

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.419 
temperature they burn that you know

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
whatnot so I do have the DDM tuning HID

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:35.389 
whatnot so I do have the DDM tuning HID

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
this time I have capacitors or here :

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.760 
this time I have capacitors or here :
eliminators<00:00:45.899> whatever<00:00:46.260> you<00:00:46.379> want<00:00:46.500> to<00:00:46.590> call

eliminators whatever you want to call

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.360 
eliminators whatever you want to call
their<00:00:47.550> plug-and-play<00:00:49.039> right<00:00:50.039> there<00:00:50.280> just

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
their plug-and-play right there just

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:57.950 
their plug-and-play right there just
like<00:00:50.670> that<00:00:52.309> plug<00:00:53.309> them<00:00:53.460> in<00:00:54.770> wallah<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:56.960> we

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
like that plug them in wallah and we

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.799 
like that plug them in wallah and we
have<00:00:58.309> working<00:00:59.309> HIDs<00:00:59.820> hopefully<00:01:00.239> we'll<00:01:00.570> see

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
have working HIDs hopefully we'll see

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.080 
have working HIDs hopefully we'll see
and<00:01:01.410> if<00:01:01.680> you<00:01:01.800> see<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.430> end<00:01:02.670> of<00:01:02.730> this<00:01:02.850> video

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
then we'll see if it works and also

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.469 
then we'll see if it works and also

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
we'll have matching LED reverse lights

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.370 
we'll have matching LED reverse lights
and<00:01:23.610> we'll<00:01:23.729> have<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:23.970> Chinese<00:01:24.299> hopefully<00:01:24.720> so

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.130 
where I got the kit
I'm<00:02:24.070> the<00:02:24.550> how<00:02:24.730> to<00:02:24.790> is<00:02:25.120> on<00:02:25.240> the<00:02:25.330> kit<00:02:25.570> too<00:02:25.780> because

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
I'm the how to is on the kit too because

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.320 
I'm the how to is on the kit too because
if<00:02:26.230> you<00:02:26.350> need<00:02:26.500> to<00:02:26.830> put<00:02:27.040> them<00:02:27.130> the<00:02:27.640> capacitors

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:28.330 
if you need to put them the capacitors

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:29.760 
if you need to put them the capacitors
then<00:02:28.630> you're<00:02:28.750> probably<00:02:29.170> going<00:02:29.440> to<00:02:29.620> need<00:02:29.709> a

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
then you're probably going to need a

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.340 
then you're probably going to need a
how-to<00:02:30.010> video<00:02:30.340> I<00:02:30.820> have<00:02:31.480> that<00:02:31.720> I<00:02:31.930> didn't<00:02:32.230> make

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
how-to video I have that I didn't make

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:35.220 
how-to video I have that I didn't make
it<00:02:32.410> but<00:02:32.770> it's<00:02:32.920> one<00:02:33.070> I<00:02:33.100> found<00:02:33.990> so<00:02:34.990> I'll<00:02:35.080> post

show you what the reverse lights look
like<00:02:54.160> well<00:02:55.090> put<00:02:55.690> an<00:02:55.780> e-brake<00:02:56.500> on<00:02:56.800> and<00:02:56.980> then<00:02:57.070> put

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
like well put an e-brake on and then put

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:06.720 
like well put an e-brake on and then put
the<00:02:57.400> reverse<00:03:01.770> press<00:03:02.770> that<00:03:02.980> in<00:03:03.220> and<00:03:05.550> hit<00:03:06.550> that

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
the reverse press that in and hit that

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:13.230 
the reverse press that in and hit that
shift<00:03:07.000> really<00:03:07.210> quick<00:03:08.610> let<00:03:09.610> it<00:03:09.730> go<00:03:12.060> let's<00:03:13.060> check

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:22.420 
guys think a lot better than the normal

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.250 
guys think a lot better than the normal
yellow<00:03:24.060> hailers<00:03:25.060> and<00:03:25.240> reverse<00:03:25.510> lights<00:03:25.840> but

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
yellow hailers and reverse lights but

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.350 
yellow hailers and reverse lights but
everything<00:03:27.130> matching<00:03:27.640> that's<00:03:27.940> what<00:03:28.090> has<00:03:28.210> the

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
everything matching that's what has the

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.900 
everything matching that's what has the
goal<00:03:28.540> is<00:03:28.980> everything<00:03:29.980> everything<00:03:30.580> bright

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
goal is everything everything bright

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.830 
goal is everything everything bright
