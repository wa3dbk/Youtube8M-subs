00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
think in my view the most important

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:43.000 
think in my view the most important
thing<00:04:41.520> is<00:04:41.610> to<00:04:41.640> restore<00:04:42.150> the<00:04:42.270> flow<00:04:42.600> of

thing is to restore the flow of

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:46.310 
thing is to restore the flow of

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 
ecosystem services that was lost if we

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:49.280 
ecosystem services that was lost if we
can<00:04:46.650> keep<00:04:46.830> these<00:04:47.070> farmers<00:04:47.610> doing<00:04:48.420> benign

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:49.290 
can keep these farmers doing benign

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:52.100 
can keep these farmers doing benign

and<00:04:52.970> happy<00:04:53.970> I<00:04:54.320> think<00:04:55.320> is<00:04:55.410> a<00:04:55.440> great<00:04:55.710> achievement

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:55.920
