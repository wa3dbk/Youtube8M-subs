00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
for on body and off body but they let me

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.600 
for on body and off body but they let me
flow<00:01:55.020> through<00:01:55.290> all<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.710> moves<00:01:55.979> that<00:01:56.159> I<00:01:56.280> like

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
flow through all the moves that I like

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.109 
flow through all the moves that I like
to<00:01:56.820> do<00:01:57.000> so<00:01:57.630> these<00:01:58.110> are<00:01:58.439> a<00:01:58.469> 20<00:01:59.100> millimeter<00:01:59.700> pipe

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
to do so these are a 20 millimeter pipe

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:04.039 
to do so these are a 20 millimeter pipe
and<00:02:00.479> my<00:02:01.259> favorite<00:02:01.920> diameter<00:02:02.520> or<00:02:02.729> size<00:02:03.030> of<00:02:03.420> hoop

and my favorite diameter or size of hoop
is<00:02:04.320> usually<00:02:05.100> between<00:02:05.509> 85<00:02:06.509> at<00:02:06.930> the<00:02:07.079> smallest<00:02:07.469> if

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
is usually between 85 at the smallest if

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.040 
is usually between 85 at the smallest if
I'm<00:02:07.979> rocking<00:02:08.399> twins<00:02:08.729> or<00:02:08.970> some<00:02:09.149> fast<00:02:09.450> on<00:02:09.690> off

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:33.150 
mama hoops they're a little bit heavier

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.180 
mama hoops they're a little bit heavier
and<00:02:33.600> they're<00:02:33.870> really<00:02:34.290> nurturing<00:02:34.800> for<00:02:35.070> the

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
and they're really nurturing for the

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.210 
and they're really nurturing for the
body<00:02:35.400> these<00:02:36.210> are<00:02:36.570> the<00:02:37.110> weight<00:02:37.380> and<00:02:37.680> size<00:02:37.950> of

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
body these are the weight and size of

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.610 
body these are the weight and size of
hoop<00:02:38.430> that<00:02:38.640> I<00:02:38.790> started<00:02:39.570> with<00:02:39.810> when<00:02:40.260> I<00:02:40.290> first

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
hoop that I started with when I first

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:41.810 
hoop that I started with when I first
started<00:02:40.950> hula<00:02:41.250> hooping

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
started hula hooping

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.910 
started hula hooping
well<00:02:42.120> after<00:02:42.690> I<00:02:42.900> realized<00:02:43.170> that<00:02:43.530> the<00:02:43.680> little

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:43.920 
well after I realized that the little

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.520 
well after I realized that the little
kids<00:02:44.040> hoop<00:02:44.280> was<00:02:44.460> not<00:02:44.820> going<00:02:45.180> to<00:02:45.300> work<00:02:45.540> ever<00:02:45.900> so

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
kids hoop was not going to work ever so

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.630 
kids hoop was not going to work ever so
this<00:02:46.920> is<00:02:47.100> a<00:02:47.130> 25<00:02:47.910> millimeter<00:02:49.280> thickness<00:02:50.280> of

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
this is a 25 millimeter thickness of

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.920 
this is a 25 millimeter thickness of
pipe<00:02:50.910> and<00:02:51.890> these<00:02:52.890> are<00:02:53.340> a<00:02:53.400> lot<00:02:53.880> slower<00:02:54.270> it<00:02:54.720> just

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
pipe and these are a lot slower it just

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.050 
pipe and these are a lot slower it just
makes<00:02:55.140> sense<00:02:55.440> that<00:02:55.920> the<00:02:56.430> heavier<00:02:56.820> the<00:02:57.030> weight

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
makes sense that the heavier the weight

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.020 
makes sense that the heavier the weight
of<00:02:57.450> the<00:02:57.780> pipe<00:02:58.020> and<00:02:58.410> the<00:02:58.560> bigger<00:02:58.830> the<00:02:59.460> diameter

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
of the pipe and the bigger the diameter

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.790 
of the pipe and the bigger the diameter
of<00:03:00.060> the<00:03:00.270> hoop<00:03:00.510> is<00:03:00.720> going<00:03:00.750> to<00:03:01.020> slow<00:03:01.260> down<00:03:01.530> and<00:03:01.740> be

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
of the hoop is going to slow down and be

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.270 
of the hoop is going to slow down and be
a<00:03:01.890> little<00:03:02.130> bit<00:03:02.370> more<00:03:02.730> cruzi<00:03:03.450> so<00:03:03.930> if<00:03:04.200> you're<00:03:04.500> you

these<00:03:18.480> days<00:03:18.540> because<00:03:19.230> I<00:03:19.350> want<00:03:19.620> to<00:03:19.709> move<00:03:20.070> really

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
these days because I want to move really

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.600 
these days because I want to move really
freely<00:03:21.390> through<00:03:22.020> my<00:03:22.170> on<00:03:22.440> and<00:03:22.770> off<00:03:22.950> body<00:03:23.220> moves
