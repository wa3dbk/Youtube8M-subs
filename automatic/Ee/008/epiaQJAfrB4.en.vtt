00:00:00.579 --> 00:00:05.109
 six days before the Passover was Jesus to Bethany where Lazarus was 

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:08.109
 although Jesus had risen from the dead 

00:00:08.689 --> 00:00:10.859
 there they offered him a dinner 

00:00:10.859 --> 00:00:12.169
 Serbian marten 

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:15.169
 and Lazarus was one of those who were at the table with him 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:16.900
 Mary 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.460
 taking a pound of pure spikenard perfume of great value 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.190
 a price the feet of jesus 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:24.939
 and dry it with your hair 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:27.810
 the house was filled with the smell of perfume 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.039
 said then judas iscariote 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:31.710
 one of his disciples 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.070
 the one who was going to deliver 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.360
 because this perfume has not been sold in 300 of larios 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.100
 and if he has given to the poor 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.520
 He said this not because he will worry about the poor 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.360
 but because he was a thief 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.859
 and how I had the bag 

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:49.960
 they were stealing from what was in it 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.650
 but jesus said 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.910
 let her save it for the day of my burial 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:56.100
 for the poor 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.170
 tennis and employment with you 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.170
 but you do not always have me 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.120
 a large part of the Jews learned that he was there 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.770
 and they went not only for Jesus 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.730
 but also to see Lazarus 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:13.130
 who had risen from the dead 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.080
 This is why the princes of the priests decided to kill 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.970
 Lazarus 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.490
 because many for their cause turned away from the Jews and believed in Jesus 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:26.369
 the next day 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.860
 the great crowd that had gone to the party 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.380
 hearing that jesus was coming to jerusalem 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.100
 they took palm branches 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.329
 and they went out to meet him screaming 

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:36.370
 hosanna 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:39.030
 blessed the one who comes in the name of the Lord 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.960
 the king of israel 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.910
 Jesus found a donkey 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.050
 and rode on it as it is written 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.030
 Do not be afraid, daughter of Zion 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.030
 turre and comes riding on a Aznar colt 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.850
 his disciples understood it at the beginning these things 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.510
 but when Jesus was glorified 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:02.110
 then they remembered 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.090
 that had been written from him 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.850
 and that they made us 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.590
 the people who were with him when he called Lazarus from the sepulcher and 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.590
 he rose from the dead he gave testimony 

00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:17.349
 that's why the crowd came out to meet him 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:20.349
 because they had heard that he had made this century 

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:23.739
 then the Pharisees chose each other 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:25.809
 you see that it does not advance and is nothing 

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:28.809
 look how the whole world has gone after him 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:34.080
 there were some Greeks among those who went up to worship at the party 

00:02:34.929 --> 00:02:36.879
 this approached felipe 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:38.749
 the sacred duty of galilea 

00:02:38.749 --> 00:02:40.659
 begging 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:42.939
 we want to see jesus 

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:45.249
 felipe went to tell him andrey 

00:02:45.249 --> 00:02:48.009
 Andrew and felipe told Jesus 

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:50.469
 and Jesus answered him 

00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:53.569
 the hour has come when the Son of Man will be glorified 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:55.669
 I assure you 

00:02:55.669 --> 00:02:59.269
 If the grain of wheat that falls on the ground does not die, it remains alone 

00:02:59.869 --> 00:03:01.029
 but if he dies 

00:03:01.029 --> 00:03:03.109
 it produces a lot of fruit 

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:05.159
 who loves his life loses it 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:07.689
 and who abhors his life in this world 

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:10.589
 he will keep it for eternal life 

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:11.940
 if anyone serves me 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:12.999
 follow me 

00:03:12.999 --> 00:03:15.999
 and where I am there will also be my server 

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:19.759
 If anyone serves me, my father will honor him 

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:22.969
 now my soul is proven 

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:25.559
 and what it says 

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:27.569
 Save me from this hour 

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:30.569
 but if this is why I came to this hour 

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:34.239
 glorify your name 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:36.739
 then a voice came from heaven 

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:38.439
 it glorifies it etc 

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:41.439
 and again glorifies him of 

00:03:42.179 --> 00:03:43.679
 the people who were there 

00:03:43.679 --> 00:03:45.039
 and he heard it 

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:47.259
 He said it had been thunder 

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:48.450
 others said 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.049
 an angel embraced him 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:52.759
 jesus answered 

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:55.759
 this voice has not come for me but for you 

00:03:56.359 --> 00:03:58.809
 now is the judgment of this world 

00:03:58.809 --> 00:04:01.809
 now the prince of this world will be cast out 

00:04:03.279 --> 00:04:05.419
 when it has risen from the earth 

00:04:05.419 --> 00:04:08.599
 I will attract everyone to me 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:11.599
 said this by pointing out that death was going to die 

00:04:12.179 --> 00:04:14.239
 the people responded 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:16.239
 we know by law 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:19.039
 that the Christ remains eternally 

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:20.010
 so 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:21.359
 how do you say 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:24.359
 it is necessary that the son of man has risen up high 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.639
 who is the son of man 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:30.169
 Jesus told him 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:33.610
 for a short time there is still the light among you 

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:35.630
 walk while you have light 

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:38.069
 so that we are not surprised by the darkness 

00:04:38.069 --> 00:04:39.889
 then who walks in darkness 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:42.029
 he does not know where he's going 

00:04:42.029 --> 00:04:43.610
 while you have light 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:46.740
 Believe in the light so that you may be children of light 

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:49.520
 Jesus said this 

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:50.570
 And he left 

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:53.770
 hiding from them 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:56.720
 although he had made such big signs in front of them 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.199
 they did not believe in him 

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:01.569
 so that the oracle of the prophet Isaiah that said 

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:03.080
 Mr 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.849
 who has believed in our message 

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:07.300
 and the arm of the sr 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.860
 here it has not been revealed 

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:11.409
 and they could not believe 

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:13.969
 because he had already said isaiah 

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:17.139
 he blinded their eyes and hardened his heart 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:20.839
 so that they do not see with their eyes or understand with their hearts 

00:05:20.839 --> 00:05:23.839
 and convert and I saved him 

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:27.629
 this isaiah said because he saw his glory and spoke of him 

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:32.029
 however even many of the chiefs believed in him 

00:05:32.589 --> 00:05:35.439
 but because of the Pharisees they did not confess 

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:38.370
 so as not to be expelled from the synagogue 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:40.700
 for they loved more the glory of men 

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:43.740
 of the glory of God 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:46.099
 Jesus cried and said 

00:05:46.099 --> 00:05:48.690
 who believes in me does not believe in me 

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:51.089
 but in the one who sent me 

00:05:51.089 --> 00:05:52.550
 and who owes to minsk 

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:54.999
 b to the one who sent me 

00:05:54.999 --> 00:05:57.229
 I have come to the world as light 

00:05:57.229 --> 00:06:00.229
 so that everyone who believes in me will not be left in darkness 

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:03.939
 and if any and in my words and does not keep them 

00:06:03.939 --> 00:06:05.460
 I did not judge him 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.779
 I have not come to judge the world 

00:06:07.779 --> 00:06:10.379
 if it's not going to save the world 

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:13.040
 who despises me and does not accept my words 

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:15.059
 already has someone who likes 

00:06:15.059 --> 00:06:17.059
 the word that I taught 

00:06:17.059 --> 00:06:20.069
 that will judge him on the last day 

00:06:20.069 --> 00:06:22.490
 because I have not spoken for myself 

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:24.860
 but the father who sent me 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:28.309
 He told me what to say and talk 

00:06:28.309 --> 00:06:31.129
 and I know that his mandate is eternal life 

00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:32.930
 this is why I speak 

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:34.740
 I say it as the father told me
