00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
to come out this soon I definitely was

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.679 
to come out this soon I definitely was
thinking<00:01:19.650> you<00:01:19.799> know<00:01:19.830> February<00:01:20.540> around<00:01:21.540> that

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
thinking you know February around that

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.350 
thinking you know February around that
time<00:01:21.900> later<00:01:22.650> next<00:01:22.920> year<00:01:23.040> possibly<00:01:23.369> just

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
time later next year possibly just

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.210 
time later next year possibly just
because<00:01:24.689> I<00:01:24.990> figured<00:01:25.560> it<00:01:25.650> would<00:01:25.770> take<00:01:25.799> a<00:01:25.979> while

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
because I figured it would take a while

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.310 
because I figured it would take a while
to<00:01:26.490> actually<00:01:26.520> work<00:01:26.970> on<00:01:27.119> but<00:01:27.420> they<00:01:27.960> pulled<00:01:28.200> this

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.810 
with these snow golems I was able to
make<00:01:34.049> about<00:01:34.229> eight<00:01:34.530> before<00:01:34.799> it<00:01:35.280> actually<00:01:35.640> cut

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
make about eight before it actually cut

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.940 
make about eight before it actually cut
me<00:01:35.970> off<00:01:36.000> I<00:01:36.240> could<00:01:36.390> not<00:01:36.509> make<00:01:36.659> any<00:01:36.900> more<00:01:37.140> before

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
me off I could not make any more before

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.859 
me off I could not make any more before
this<00:01:38.159> I<00:01:38.340> could<00:01:38.670> only<00:01:38.790> make<00:01:39.030> six<00:01:39.360> so<00:01:39.600> I'm<00:01:39.720> not

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
this I could only make six so I'm not

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.109 
this I could only make six so I'm not
really<00:01:40.079> sure<00:01:40.200> if<00:01:40.740> maybe<00:01:41.280> I<00:01:41.400> just<00:01:41.640> lost<00:01:41.939> track

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
really sure if maybe I just lost track

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.630 
really sure if maybe I just lost track
of<00:01:42.210> count<00:01:42.509> or<00:01:43.320> maybe<00:01:43.649> it<00:01:43.860> was<00:01:43.979> just<00:01:44.009> something

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
of count or maybe it was just something

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.179 
of count or maybe it was just something
going<00:01:44.670> on<00:01:45.090> not<00:01:45.630> really<00:01:45.899> sure<00:01:46.350> but<00:01:46.799> I<00:01:46.829> was<00:01:46.979> just

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
going on not really sure but I was just

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.859 
going on not really sure but I was just
experimenting<00:01:47.820> I<00:01:48.030> like<00:01:48.210> lined<00:01:48.479> them<00:01:48.630> all<00:01:48.810> up

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
experimenting I like lined them all up

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.620 
experimenting I like lined them all up
like<00:01:49.170> in<00:01:49.560> rows<00:01:50.159> of<00:01:50.369> two<00:01:50.579> and<00:01:50.909> was<00:01:51.329> just<00:01:51.450> like

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
like in rows of two and was just like

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.080 
like in rows of two and was just like
slapping<00:01:52.110> heads<00:01:52.290> on<00:01:52.500> them<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:53.159> then<00:01:53.759> it<00:01:53.880> just

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
slapping heads on them and then it just

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.760 
slapping heads on them and then it just
kind<00:01:54.329> of<00:01:54.420> just<00:01:54.479> stopped<00:01:54.990> what<00:01:55.409> you'll<00:01:55.590> see

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
kind of just stopped what you'll see

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.709 
kind of just stopped what you'll see
here<00:01:55.920> -<00:01:56.100> if<00:01:56.219> you<00:01:56.340> cannot<00:01:56.610> make<00:01:56.880> any<00:01:56.909> more<00:01:57.119> it

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
here - if you cannot make any more it

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.179 
here - if you cannot make any more it
will<00:01:57.840> actually<00:01:58.140> just<00:01:58.290> turn<00:01:58.530> into<00:01:59.040> just

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
will actually just turn into just

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.190 
will actually just turn into just
snowballs<00:01:59.670> so<00:01:59.939> that's<00:02:00.540> pretty<00:02:00.780> much<00:02:00.840> it<00:02:00.960> for

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
snowballs so that's pretty much it for

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.810 
snowballs so that's pretty much it for
the<00:02:01.290> snow<00:02:01.469> golems<00:02:01.799> like<00:02:01.920> I<00:02:02.009> say<00:02:02.159> utility<00:02:02.579> mobs

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
the snow golems like I say utility mobs

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.850
