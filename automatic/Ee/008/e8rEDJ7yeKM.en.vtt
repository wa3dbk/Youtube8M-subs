00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:08.160
 my name is michael jordan i am 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.809
 photographer trainer and author and i lead 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.590
 you through this video training 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:15.210
 speedlite 600x rt 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:17.190
 this is the top spot of canon and 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.439
 just as spiky said the manual 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.779
 that it is incredibly thick and if they are so 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.800
 I read reluctantly manuals then 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.560
 they probably already have it on 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.029
 I've been waiting for a video training session 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.099
 step by step like this 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.630
 thing works here i show them 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.489
 the different keys and me 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.860
 show I explained it to me even 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:37.200
 the mode test or the button for the 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.210
 wireless radio operation then there is here 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.590
 four function keys are very much 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.410
 are clearer than at the 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.390
 predecessor model but that's what you should do 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.520
 know are the different occupied 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.110
 depending on what mode you are in 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.780
 are there and there is a video training 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.949
 optimal to understand that and for me 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.449
 it is much easier too 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.539
 explain as if I have him about it 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:58.469
 to write a book and if they are the 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:00:59.280
 modes of operation of the individual buttons 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.320
 know 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.750
 then I show the very end of the video 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.720
 trainings how a link works 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.640
 Two cameras take pictures simultaneously 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.619
 from different perspectives 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.810
 same motive that is a great thing 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.520
 and really much fun and its full 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.619
 however, this device has potential 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.750
 if you own a second or one 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.700
 transmitter then the devices can 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.920
 communicate with each other and they can 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.680
 either in a left bulkhead two 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.750
 Cameras equipped with flash units and 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.250
 photograph these two at the same time 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.170
 let 's say the photography of one 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.420
 own motive from different 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.310
 perspectives or that I still have 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.740
 much more exciting and also much funnier 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.439
 find you have a receiver on 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.850
 the camera and with the flash unit 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:43.740
 illuminate your motive you are running around 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.329
 the motive is flashing around 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.970
 different directions on the 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:50.409
 motive and solve by the pressure on the 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.569
 lightning button the camera off 

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:54.640
 I wish you a lot of fun with this 

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:56.999
 Video training from video2brain and me 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.999
 I'm sure they are lightning fast 

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:59.999
