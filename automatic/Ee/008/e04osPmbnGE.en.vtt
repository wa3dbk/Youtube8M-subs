00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 n 

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:08.399
 read 

00:00:08.399 --> 00:00:11.399
 read 

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:22.929
 walls between structural bales 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:28.890
 the total weight of the roof known as top and dead load and that of its 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:29.829
 structure 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:34.260
 is distributed evenly over bale walls and empty spaces 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.510
 for doors and windows called vanos 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.050
 This method has general restrictions regarding the number of 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:43.050
 levels 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.970
 since only 1 can be built and the maximum area of ​​openings should not be 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.900
 exceed 50% of the total area of ​​the wall 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.310
 among the advantages offered by the system is that it does not require a structure 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:59.260
 to support the roof 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.110
 which can represent a saving in material time 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.740
 and construction work 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.850
 Another advantage is that the design is simple 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.210
 what facilitates the construction 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.640
 By not having the support structure the roof design should not be 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:22.090
 very heavy it is necessary to wait until the walls are compressed and settle with the 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.090
 weight of the roof to start shaping the straw 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.310
 2% limping 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.110
 for the weight of life that already has 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.080
 here they have been competing 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:38.320
 then what we are going to do is put another piece of reflect 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.570
 to pull 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.380
 your chairs and squeezing 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.659
 this could stop more settlements when the blood arrives and in it they have 

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:47.360
 made man 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.909
 percent think you're going to stop paying this part you have to be this one 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.660
 drying the measurement on the doors to know how much has gone 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:01.600
 so much gone down when the three days is maintained as the measure does not go down 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.660
 we are ready to start firewood 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.430
 to give the first hand of him 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.789
 chump community 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:12.729
 in the process of construction 

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:14.579
 the foundations 

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:18.619
 a sunken stone foundation was built in cement mix 

00:02:20.719 --> 00:02:24.489
 the foundation process that are used in the bale method 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:25.699
 structural 

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:28.699
 It is similar to the construction with support structure 

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:33.730
 you can consult the section of foundations in walls of bales with structure 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:34.729
 support 

00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:37.729
 to learn more about its characteristics 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.369
 walls 

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:46.669
 rods are placed on the foundation shaft every 50 centimeters for 

00:02:46.669 --> 00:02:49.639
 the first row of bales that fits 

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:52.359
 leaving the spaces for the doors 

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:56.879
 the following rows of the four walls are placed at the same time 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:02.219
 unlike the method that uses structure in which you can build 

00:03:02.219 --> 00:03:05.139
 Cadamuro independently 

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:09.859
 Staples made with bread are placed in the four corners of each row 

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:13.159
 to connect the bales and give unity to the walls 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:16.849
 also sticks rods every three rows 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:19.849
 two grills are used per bale 

00:03:20.649 --> 00:03:22.579
 the doors and the windows 

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:26.169
 must be placed a façade and a half away from the east 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:29.689
 according to the design of the construction 

00:03:29.689 --> 00:03:33.169
 6 ov7 rows of straws are stacked 

00:03:33.169 --> 00:03:36.120
 and the enclosures are placed in this case 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.120
 They are wooden beams 

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:46.359
 ep / seville c 

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:48.569
 they receive the direct load from the roof 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:51.759
 kila distributed evenly in the straw walls 

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:54.260
 once the wounds are placed 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:57.719
 far eco chef tie the bales from the foundation 

00:03:57.719 --> 00:04:02.250
 and proceeds with the construction of the ceiling ap breasts 

00:04:11.749 --> 00:04:15.949
 a roof design suitable for the structural bales method 

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:17.949
 it can be still water 

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:18.900
 for which 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:23.099
 it is necessary to leave one more row of bales on one side 

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:24.730
 that of the inclination 

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:27.520
 that will allow the runoff of water 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.930
 the technique used in this example 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:32.930
 it is similar before the house with support structure 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:37.750
 the difference is the moment that is constructed since for the method of 

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:42.780
 structural bales it is necessary to finish the roof first before 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:45.780
 begin with the flattening of the walls 

00:04:53.779 --> 00:04:55.120
 the murillo destination 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.370
 They are placed on the wooden beams 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:02.260
 and above the reed and a layer of land with an island before 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.260
 intermediate plastic 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:26.779
 since the roof is built in its entirety 

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:30.769
 the walls are covered with two layers of mud mixed with straw 

00:05:31.319 --> 00:05:34.439
 to fill the gaps between the bales 

00:05:34.439 --> 00:05:37.199
 and for the edges of frames and windows 

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:40.490
 It uses a thick straw altet mass with mud 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:47.270
 the pacas of the four walls are completely covered with mud 

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:49.599
 once it has dried 

00:05:49.599 --> 00:05:54.379
 metal mesh is placed in the corners and door frames 

00:05:54.379 --> 00:05:55.619
 and windows 

00:05:55.619 --> 00:05:58.550
 the walls are reinforced with chicken coop 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:00.369
 to give resistance 

00:06:00.369 --> 00:06:03.369
 and prevent the entry of rodents 

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:14.159
 finished 

00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:19.659
 the enjarre is made on the chicken coop fabric with a cement mixture 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:23.610
 in the final layer 

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:26.569
 will be the finished and the painting 

00:06:26.569 --> 00:06:27.789
 for 

00:06:27.789 --> 00:06:30.789
 just like the bale system with support structure 

00:06:31.499 --> 00:06:33.480
 the finished ones like the floor 

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:34.819
 they are made according to 

00:06:34.819 --> 00:06:37.819
 opp design and budget 

00:06:40.849 --> 00:06:43.229
 the constructions with bales of straw 

00:06:43.229 --> 00:06:47.469
 are a sustainable housing alternative for the inhabitants of the 

00:06:47.469 --> 00:06:50.490
 Aryan regions and according to Caritas of Mexico
