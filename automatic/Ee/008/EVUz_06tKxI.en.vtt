about six give or take probably more I

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.970 
about six give or take probably more I
could<00:00:30.240> be<00:00:30.359> wrong<00:00:30.510> let's<00:00:31.410> look<00:00:31.529> at<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.710> unit

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
could be wrong let's look at the unit

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.020 
could be wrong let's look at the unit
last<00:00:32.219> tab<00:00:33.020> pretty<00:00:34.020> even<00:00:34.200> so<00:00:34.500> far<00:00:34.530> because<00:00:35.030> well

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030 
last tab pretty even so far because well

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.299 
last tab pretty even so far because well
as<00:00:36.180> far<00:00:36.420> as<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.660> resources<00:00:37.320> go<00:00:37.440> because<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:38.070> T

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
as far as the resources go because the T

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.400 
as far as the resources go because the T
of<00:00:38.430> those<00:00:38.520> units<00:00:38.850> are<00:00:39.000> more<00:00:39.180> expensive<00:00:39.480> they

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
of those units are more expensive they

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.740 
of those units are more expensive they
are<00:00:40.440> higher<00:00:40.829> tier<00:00:41.040> units<00:00:41.399> so<00:00:41.579> yeah<00:00:41.940> here<00:00:42.600> we

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
are higher tier units so yeah here we

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:45.560 
are higher tier units so yeah here we
have<00:00:42.960> a<00:00:42.989> mad<00:00:43.800> frog<00:00:44.100> trying<00:00:44.610> to<00:00:44.730> test<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.360> door

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
have a mad frog trying to test the door

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.260 
have a mad frog trying to test the door
of<00:00:46.160> TLO<00:00:47.160> trying<00:00:47.670> to<00:00:47.760> do<00:00:47.879> a<00:00:47.910> little<00:00:48.059> bit<00:00:48.239> of

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
of TLO trying to do a little bit of

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.360 
of TLO trying to do a little bit of
scouting<00:00:48.600> see<00:00:48.989> what's<00:00:49.170> going<00:00:49.410> on<00:00:49.530> here<00:00:49.800> see<00:00:50.280> if

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
scouting see what's going on here see if

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.830 
scouting see what's going on here see if
he<00:00:50.460> has<00:00:50.640> a<00:00:50.670> chance<00:00:51.000> of<00:00:51.120> getting<00:00:51.210> in<00:00:51.539> and<00:00:51.690> doing

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
he has a chance of getting in and doing

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.139 
he has a chance of getting in and doing
some<00:00:52.079> harassment<00:00:52.260> but<00:00:52.860> at<00:00:53.430> this<00:00:53.670> point<00:00:53.910> I

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
some harassment but at this point I

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.119 
some harassment but at this point I
think<00:00:54.690> that<00:00:54.840> he<00:00:54.989> is<00:00:55.020> favoring<00:00:55.559> to<00:00:55.739> you<00:00:55.860> know<00:00:55.949> to

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
think that he is favoring to you know to

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.130 
think that he is favoring to you know to
keep<00:00:56.160> his<00:00:56.489> army<00:00:56.820> for<00:00:57.210> security<00:00:57.780> reasons

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
keep his army for security reasons

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.540 
keep his army for security reasons
because<00:00:58.350> he<00:00:58.590> is<00:00:58.680> putting<00:00:58.829> out<00:00:59.039> for<00:00:59.219> a<00:00:59.250> second

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
because he is putting out for a second

expansion<00:01:12.479> getting<00:01:13.110> at<00:01:13.229> a<00:01:13.260> few<00:01:13.950> more

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
expansion getting at a few more

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.840 
expansion getting at a few more
Marauders<00:01:15.770> because<00:01:16.770> yeah<00:01:17.220> now<00:01:17.430> to<00:01:17.490> do<00:01:17.640> see

Marauders because yeah now to do see

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.370 
Marauders because yeah now to do see
roaches<00:01:18.240> you<00:01:18.390> gotta<00:01:18.540> pump<00:01:18.840> on<00:01:18.960> Marauders

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
roaches you gotta pump on Marauders

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.170 
roaches you gotta pump on Marauders
because<00:01:19.680> that<00:01:19.920> just<00:01:19.950> makes<00:01:20.310> sense<00:01:20.490> it's<00:01:20.759> a

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
because that just makes sense it's a

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.210 
because that just makes sense it's a
counter<00:01:21.570> unit<00:01:21.869> and<00:01:22.080> a<00:01:22.470> very<00:01:22.650> good<00:01:22.740> counter

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
unit at that and here we have TLO

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.060 
unit at that and here we have TLO
getting<00:01:25.950> a<00:01:26.869> level<00:01:27.869> 1<00:01:28.049> upgrade<00:01:28.320> for<00:01:28.770> his

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
putting up a good fight but at this

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:35.939 
putting up a good fight but at this
point<00:03:34.750> man<00:03:34.959> I<00:03:34.989> do<00:03:35.139> have<00:03:35.349> to<00:03:35.379> believe<00:03:35.620> that<00:03:35.799> they

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:35.949 
point man I do have to believe that they

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:37.830 
point man I do have to believe that they
are<00:03:36.069> being<00:03:36.220> outnumbered<00:03:36.400> by<00:03:37.090> the<00:03:37.150> stores<00:03:37.540> and

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
are being outnumbered by the stores and

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.129 
are being outnumbered by the stores and
the<00:03:38.680> land<00:03:39.189> army<00:03:39.489> over<00:03:39.849> there<00:03:40.060> the<00:03:40.479> marine<00:03:40.930> and

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:41.139 
the land army over there the marine and

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:44.879 
the land army over there the marine and
whatnot<00:03:41.500> so<00:03:42.900> these<00:03:43.900> roaches<00:03:44.139> are<00:03:44.500> forced<00:03:44.859> to

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:44.889 
whatnot so these roaches are forced to

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:49.050 
whatnot so these roaches are forced to
run<00:03:45.069> away<00:03:45.220> and<00:03:46.500> well<00:03:47.500> on<00:03:48.220> the<00:03:48.669> creep<00:03:48.909> they're

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:49.060 
run away and well on the creep they're

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:51.749 
run away and well on the creep they're
gonna<00:03:49.180> regenerate<00:03:49.540> quite<00:03:49.989> fast<00:03:50.290> so<00:03:50.560> I<00:03:50.859> think

00:03:51.749 --> 00:03:51.759 
gonna regenerate quite fast so I think

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:53.969 
gonna regenerate quite fast so I think
we're<00:03:52.060> going<00:03:52.180> to<00:03:52.299> be<00:03:52.389> seeing<00:03:52.599> them<00:03:52.810> quite<00:03:53.680> soon

00:03:53.969 --> 00:03:53.979 
we're going to be seeing them quite soon

00:03:53.979 --> 00:03:56.339 
we're going to be seeing them quite soon
don't<00:03:54.609> worry<00:03:54.819> and<00:03:55.090> we<00:03:55.419> here<00:03:55.810> we<00:03:55.959> have<00:03:56.079> a<00:03:56.109> lot<00:03:56.319> of

00:03:56.339 --> 00:03:56.349 
don't worry and we here we have a lot of

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:59.369 
don't worry and we here we have a lot of
extra<00:03:56.680> workers<00:03:56.859> on<00:03:57.729> that<00:03:58.060> refinery<00:03:58.569> I<00:03:58.810> don't

00:03:59.369 --> 00:03:59.379 
extra workers on that refinery I don't

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:00.899 
extra workers on that refinery I don't
think<00:03:59.409> it's<00:03:59.650> going<00:03:59.799> to<00:03:59.889> be<00:03:59.949> you<00:04:00.310> know<00:04:00.430> that's

00:04:00.899 --> 00:04:00.909 
think it's going to be you know that's

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:02.369 
think it's going to be you know that's
not<00:04:01.030> useful<00:04:01.239> pretty<00:04:01.959> sure<00:04:02.109> it's<00:04:02.229> a<00:04:02.290> mistake

00:04:02.369 --> 00:04:02.379 
not useful pretty sure it's a mistake

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:05.159 
not useful pretty sure it's a mistake
but<00:04:03.280> yeah<00:04:03.579> here<00:04:03.849> we<00:04:03.970> have<00:04:04.150> math<00:04:04.419> rock<00:04:04.720> scouting

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:05.169 
but yeah here we have math rock scouting

00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:06.899 
but yeah here we have math rock scouting
with<00:04:05.259> a<00:04:05.319> few<00:04:05.560> with<00:04:05.829> a<00:04:05.859> pack<00:04:06.189> of<00:04:06.370> their<00:04:06.549> links

00:04:06.899 --> 00:04:06.909 
with a few with a pack of their links

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:13.199 
with a few with a pack of their links
and<00:04:08.040> the<00:04:09.780> lights<00:04:10.780> in<00:04:10.959> my<00:04:10.989> room<00:04:11.139> are<00:04:12.209> twitching

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:13.209 
and the lights in my room are twitching

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:16.229 
and the lights in my room are twitching
again<00:04:13.540> and<00:04:14.040> let's<00:04:15.040> hope<00:04:15.220> I<00:04:15.459> don't<00:04:15.699> lose<00:04:15.970> power

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
again and let's hope I don't lose power

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:20.020 
again and let's hope I don't lose power
boys<00:04:16.509> but<00:04:17.199> yeah<00:04:17.440> here<00:04:17.680> we<00:04:17.769> have<00:04:17.979> a<00:04:18.209> race

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:20.030 
boys but yeah here we have a race

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.680 
boys but yeah here we have a race
for<00:04:20.329> a<00:04:20.359> base<00:04:21.139> race<00:04:21.470> basically<00:04:22.070> and<00:04:22.450> TLO<00:04:23.450> is

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:23.690 
for a base race basically and TLO is

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:26.170 
for a base race basically and TLO is
choosing<00:04:24.170> to<00:04:24.200> ignore<00:04:24.410> the<00:04:25.280> his<00:04:25.580> base<00:04:25.850> his

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:26.180 
choosing to ignore the his base his

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:27.730 
choosing to ignore the his base his
defenses<00:04:26.750> he<00:04:26.900> did<00:04:27.080> kill<00:04:27.290> all<00:04:27.320> the<00:04:27.470> workers

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:27.740 
defenses he did kill all the workers

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.520 
defenses he did kill all the workers
over<00:04:28.250> there<00:04:28.460> and<00:04:28.669> now<00:04:29.570> I<00:04:29.870> do<00:04:29.990> believe<00:04:30.320> that

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
over there and now I do believe that

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:32.680 
over there and now I do believe that
they<00:04:30.650> are<00:04:30.680> going<00:04:30.800> for<00:04:31.070> a<00:04:31.250> base<00:04:31.460> race<00:04:31.760> because

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690 
they are going for a base race because

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:34.270 
they are going for a base race because
all<00:04:33.020> his<00:04:33.169> workers<00:04:33.590> he's<00:04:33.800> not<00:04:33.950> going<00:04:34.100> to<00:04:34.190> be

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
all his workers he's not going to be

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.550 
all his workers he's not going to be
able<00:04:34.310> to<00:04:34.550> save<00:04:34.790> them<00:04:35.000> Matt<00:04:35.690> from<00:04:36.020> inflicting

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:36.560 
able to save them Matt from inflicting

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.430 
able to save them Matt from inflicting
heavy<00:04:36.950> damage<00:04:37.430> upon<00:04:38.000> his<00:04:38.210> workers<00:04:38.630> upon<00:04:39.230> his

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 
heavy damage upon his workers upon his

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.460 
heavy damage upon his workers upon his
buildings<00:04:39.860> and<00:04:40.100> everything<00:04:40.610> is<00:04:41.150> going<00:04:41.660> slowly

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470 
buildings and everything is going slowly

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.070 
buildings and everything is going slowly
going<00:04:42.800> down<00:04:42.919> yeah<00:04:43.760> they're<00:04:43.970> your<00:04:44.210> health<00:04:44.840> bars

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.080 
going down yeah they're your health bars

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.180 
going down yeah they're your health bars
ticking<00:04:45.380> away<00:04:45.470> so<00:04:45.590> you<00:04:45.770> could<00:04:45.919> see<00:04:46.040> it<00:04:46.130> a

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:46.190 
ticking away so you could see it a

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:48.460 
ticking away so you could see it a
little<00:04:46.280> bit<00:04:46.490> clearly<00:04:46.910> more<00:04:47.480> clear<00:04:47.780> and<00:04:48.050> now

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:48.470 
little bit clearly more clear and now

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:50.409 
little bit clearly more clear and now
here<00:04:48.889> we<00:04:49.010> have<00:04:49.040> sierra<00:04:49.460> pushing<00:04:50.180> into<00:04:50.300> the

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:50.419 
here we have sierra pushing into the

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:53.710 
here we have sierra pushing into the
main<00:04:50.690> base<00:04:50.930> of<00:04:51.280> mad<00:04:52.280> frog<00:04:52.610> this<00:04:53.450> is<00:04:53.600> so

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:53.720 
main base of mad frog this is so

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.630 
main base of mad frog this is so
exciting<00:04:53.960> man<00:04:54.290> it<00:04:54.410> is<00:04:54.500> i<00:04:54.770> do<00:04:55.070> believe<00:04:55.370> that

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:55.640 
exciting man it is i do believe that

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:59.800 
exciting man it is i do believe that
because<00:04:56.620> ELO<00:04:57.620> can<00:04:57.980> left<00:04:58.220> office<00:04:58.600> buildings<00:04:59.600> he

00:04:59.800 --> 00:04:59.810 
because ELO can left office buildings he

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:01.900 
because ELO can left office buildings he
is<00:04:59.900> an<00:05:00.020> advantage<00:05:00.410> here<00:05:00.800> but<00:05:01.220> let's<00:05:01.669> see<00:05:01.790> what

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:01.910 
is an advantage here but let's see what

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:04.390 
is an advantage here but let's see what
we<00:05:02.030> can<00:05:02.060> what<00:05:02.750> is<00:05:02.990> going<00:05:03.380> to<00:05:03.500> happen<00:05:03.919> because

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 
we can what is going to happen because

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.000 
we can what is going to happen because
roaches<00:05:05.060> noisy<00:05:05.419> links<00:05:05.750> can<00:05:05.930> attack<00:05:06.200> air<00:05:06.470> but

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:07.010 
roaches noisy links can attack air but

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:09.820 
roaches noisy links can attack air but
this<00:05:07.610> arm<00:05:07.850> here<00:05:08.120> is<00:05:08.270> capable<00:05:08.660> well<00:05:09.169> capable<00:05:09.410> of

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:09.830 
this arm here is capable well capable of

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:12.010 
this arm here is capable well capable of
attacking<00:05:10.160> land<00:05:10.580> and<00:05:10.820> air<00:05:11.090> so<00:05:11.570> they<00:05:11.720> are<00:05:11.840> just

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:12.020 
attacking land and air so they are just

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:13.960 
attacking land and air so they are just
going<00:05:12.350> in<00:05:12.560> their<00:05:12.740> past<00:05:12.950> and<00:05:13.220> destroying

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:13.970 
going in their past and destroying

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:15.640 
going in their past and destroying
everything<00:05:14.300> the<00:05:14.810> spire<00:05:15.140> goes<00:05:15.380> down

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:15.650 
everything the spire goes down

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:17.740 
everything the spire goes down
everything<00:05:16.400> goes<00:05:16.550> down<00:05:16.790> the<00:05:17.240> workers<00:05:17.630> are

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:17.750 
everything goes down the workers are

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:19.450 
everything goes down the workers are
hurt<00:05:17.990> more<00:05:18.470> with<00:05:18.650> just<00:05:18.830> coming<00:05:19.100> out<00:05:19.220> that

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:19.460 
hurt more with just coming out that

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:20.980 
hurt more with just coming out that
unable<00:05:19.700> to<00:05:19.940> inflict<00:05:20.180> damage<00:05:20.330> they<00:05:20.660> get<00:05:20.840> taken

unable to inflict damage they get taken

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:23.950 
unable to inflict damage they get taken
out<00:05:21.200> as<00:05:21.410> the<00:05:21.440> Terran<00:05:22.220> army<00:05:22.550> is<00:05:23.000> too<00:05:23.300> large<00:05:23.479> and

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:23.960 
out as the Terran army is too large and

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.050 
out as the Terran army is too large and
