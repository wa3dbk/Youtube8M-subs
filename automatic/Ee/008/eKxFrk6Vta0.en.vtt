00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:15.250
 hello good to all yes yes as before 

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:17.980
 well we are here in the strategy of 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:20.650
 watercress for the tournament I will explain 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:23.050
 how it's done perfectly ok it's not going to 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:24.490
 no doubt I hope and any 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.970
 I doubt you have already know what I said 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:31.359
 I wrote it here and I 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:33.280
 I will try to answer you always go to 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:36.250
 record where my camera is from 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.500
 I mean, I 'm the one who is going to be behind us 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.360
 two players as you know will go one 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.610
 in front and another behind bond returns from 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.630
 back I am in this case and he when 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:45.489
 I grabbed jce 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:49.149
 when I recorded jce be in capturing it 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:50.530
 mobile as it is with camera has 

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:52.180
 you have to see the two players 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.770
 then you have to record it as such and 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.780
 As you see in my video, it's worth 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.399
 then we will always start the 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.160
 strategy from here from the kitchen 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:01.660
 we always start from here nothing more 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:04.000
 that we start here in the kitchen 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.920
 will put the number in red and we'll start 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.470
 run down it's worth that's how I 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.720
 let's do then let's start and 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.300
 you will see how it is done 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:16.180
 we will always have to keep so much 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:19.120
 as my partner we will have to maintain 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.980
 a distance of like one more room 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.200
 or less approximately then 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:25.810
 now they would turn red we started 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.490
 we're running round 26 and already 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.650
 put the thing tight I wanted to do it 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.170
 that in this round because here was the 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.790
 best way to do it then already 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.680
 they start coming everything starts to come out 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.290
 the partner is always going to close the 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.780
 window that can be the danger for 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.280
 I do not want to explain to you 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.110
 detail because I want you to see 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.060
 the video and that you take out 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.860
 own conclusions to do the 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.560
 strategy but following this same 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.750
 ok then they would be everything here 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.369
 behind regrouped I would take it to 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.590
 up calmly the companion and 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:58.450
 is there ahead waiting for me and now 

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.130
 we would put them here in the trap is already 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.770
 they would be almost all behind they are not going to 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.600
 to die all of us are going to die but 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.250
 the vast majority will die then 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.140
 they would be there and the little ones would come 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.610
 that would be there behind and already 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.170
 they would start to leave all for all 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.470
 parts the partner has to burst 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.150
 the kitchen would already go forward and now 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.050
 it has to be coming out of the kitchen 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.490
 practically 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.200
 I made that window so that I would not 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.540
 come out in those zombies and that's fine 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.690
 done and now that forward to down 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:28.420
 fast is fast forward and fast 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.890
 And that's always keeping a distance 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.480
 more or less at a distance then he will 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.520
 Take those two zombies now so you do not 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.540
 can be killed and now we kill here 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.730
 down 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.290
 we kill down here that if you see 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.270
 that you can not kill down here and you have 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.710
 to take him to the trap of the trap 

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:43.570
 electric another you see why you take it without 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:45.730
 problems the thing is always 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:47.380
 interspersed we kill down there kill 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.840
 the traps you kill very down we kill the 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.970
 traps that we can not anymore 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.250
 directly a spin we kill in 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.740
 trap a spin we kill in trap like that 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:00.190
 It's worth that too, because if it's 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:02.500
 a round 60 or 50 or whatever here in 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.990
 Peru, it's hard for you to do it 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:08.020
 once and in the trap is enough 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:09.650
 thing is that always carry and distance 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.689
 between the two 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.069
 and to see that the player looks good 

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:15.530
 the other what he does is worth then 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:17.840
 it would always be this strategy we kill 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.610
 again the electric trap and we what 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.950
 we go back to again quickly then 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:23.569
 he goes again there in the kitchen and 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.030
 mercÃ¨ actually the window and now it 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:27.470
 goes the quickly again down and 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.659
 That's how I would like the strategy 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:32.599
 repeat again because you have already fixed 

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:33.920
 which is the same we have put back what 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:35.269
 same again but so that what 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.049
 see again how we have done it 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:41.659
 and that would be how we would get here below 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:44.510
 down here I would regroup quietly and 

00:03:41.659 --> 00:03:47.090
 down here stuff we both would cast 

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.920
 the ice would miss the howl 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.139
 winter and would kill both montero 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.090
 there without any problem and you 

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:54.950
 it's like this would be all people already know if 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.689
 in long long long round I do not ask you 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:58.069
 that you do this but if you put it in 

00:03:56.689 --> 00:03:59.590
 traps and that you always carry 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:02.840
 distance and then in conditions 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:06.829
 we will take into account everything is worth 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:09.769
 audio as you do it as the way 

00:04:06.829 --> 00:04:11.599
 cleanly kill everything is worth killing you 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:15.230
 that they kill us of everything what we will have 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:16.400
 present voucher apart you ask me tri 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.859
 what could be done 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.989
 / can not record on screen 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:23.630
 divided by the theme that can be 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:25.910
 do thousands of glitch and then already 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:28.580
 you know what to play cleanly and in case 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:30.110
 maybe we will do it we will not 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.940
 do so on split screen so that 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:33.590
 to avoid problems 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:36.620
 although there are people I know who do not 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:38.449
 but as there are people who do and everything 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.610
 what can be prevented from being done 

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:42.860
 traps we will try to avoid all 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:45.169
 So, good people, I hope there's 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:47.840
 liked this map strategy and you know 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:50.500
 vote it give you like to subscribe and up 

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:50.500
