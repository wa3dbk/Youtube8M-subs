00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.980
 0 

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:12.830
 with 6 tricks of ricochet first that 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:15.260
 nothing you have to know that the answer 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.840
 goals remain in the center where 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:20.119
 rocket launchers reappear and the last and the 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.640
 third appears below where it appears 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:24.260
 the sword will repeat that second order 

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.579
 you have to learn that it is nothing 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.410
 more throw it where you want is not going to 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:29.180
 work has to have a little bit over 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.800
 where you want to throw you have to 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.020
 run to this direction so that the ball 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.670
 go far and fast 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.380
 Finally, make sure there are no 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.970
 enemy close that way when the 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:39.970
 person has the ball does not have any 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:42.260
 difficulty of throwing it towards the goal 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:44.150
 let's start where we can throw it in the 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.800
 pittsburgh center was in throwing it 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.840
 from there so you do not have any 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.910
 problem with the component in the hole 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.650
 which remains in the center or in the box if 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.510
 the situation is calmer and this 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.130
 shot complicates them there is another method of 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.290
 throw it by simply moving it is a bit 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:01:00.260
 closer and have them directly from 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:02.059
 this way has an assured goal 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:03.679
 the second shot that we are going to learn is 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:05.689
 in the hallway also knowing where 

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:07.759
 appear a rocket launcher we have it there 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:09.680
 mismito that way we can have a 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:11.119
 hit in ensures and well direct have 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.560
 to be careful because the ball can 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:14.240
 bounce off the ground and have to ensure 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.560
 that the enemy does not grab it if the 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.909
 situation is a bit more complicated 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.159
 when there's a hyper on the other side of 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:22.100
 map can pull in corners doors or 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:23.570
 walls to bounce and in the area is 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.490
 very simple nothing else has to be a 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.440
 Mathematical soccer for the last shot 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.509
 that we are going to learn where the 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.240
 last ball in sword I recommend that 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:34.429
 go up and go jump jump into the abyss 

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.619
 to throw the ball is a little more 

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:38.330
 complicated it takes a little longer but the 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:40.190
 enemies can be distracted and you can 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.899
 score easily on the ball another 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.520
 recommendation that you could do is go to 

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:45.920
 the house of cards and do it from there 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.869
 also use the walls or the sand that 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.880
 There on the map to note that 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:53.140
 way they can make an instant goal 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.140
 without any problem 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.350
 One of my recommendations is that they try 

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:58.820
 being tocho I have a partner who is 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.340
 has infiltrated the enemy base without 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.229
 the enemy knows go wait and your 

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.670
 mate throws the ball towards where it is 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:06.770
 that way he can grab the 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.989
 ball and can do a tokyo so that 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.700
 know the torsion is 50 points and each 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:12.440
 once you have a ball to the goal are 20 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.269
 points so it is more advisable that 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.680
 throw the ball to your friend so that 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:17.090
 make history good with me 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:19.370
 recommendation is that they go to the cake and 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.019
 make your own jumps tactical tricks 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.849
 with your own equipment since a thousand ways 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:24.290
 of how to play this type of game if you 

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:26.090
 has served this video dale I like and 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:29.590
 maybe make more than other types of game 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.590
 hd see you
