00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:28.889 
him as well but maybe it's just a

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:30.470

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:31.759 
pairing doesn't work I find a lot of the
time<00:03:30.629> it's<00:03:30.780> not<00:03:30.870> even<00:03:31.079> just<00:03:31.109> an<00:03:31.349> individual

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
time it's not even just an individual

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:33.770 
time it's not even just an individual
pairing<00:03:32.099> until<00:03:32.370> you<00:03:32.459> match<00:03:32.699> them<00:03:32.970> up<00:03:33.090> with<00:03:33.150> and

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
pairing until you match them up with and

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.680
