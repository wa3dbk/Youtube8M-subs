00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 it's been a long time since I've done 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:11.370
 of video at the same time it's normal 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:13.259
 that a control in primary in college 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.210
 and in high school there is one thing that comes up 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.490
 all the time it's the controls of the 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:22.230
 controls it's absolutely everywhere by 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.820
 the part left salt everywhere then 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.740
 necessarily we control that it serves 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.730
 but sometimes it serves me absolutely to 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.260
 nothing 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.050
 take as an example the controls 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.529
 of fine arts think three 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:37.200
 seconds 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:38.489
 at the age when it is used for what 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.690
 it's as if they've noticed the big ones 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.739
 painters whenever he was doing a 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:46.440
 table it's out of luck to very pretty 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.719
 tableau monsieur de vinci I like this 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.640
 mysterious smile and the eyes that you 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.860
 follow when you move very 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:57.449
 interesting i 'll put you a 18 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:59.039
 out of 20 so as I said there are some 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.620
 controls that serve something 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.270
 but there is one thing that is absolutely 

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.100
 horrible professor who invented that 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.409
 is a person who hates children 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.210
 it's the surprise checks so everything 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.670
 the world knows the surprise checks 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:14.510
 it's not the kind of surprise it's 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.510
 what is it for me 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:23.840
 I will open a nano ipod 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:26.600
 it's more the kind of surprise it is 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:31.250
 what is it ticking? 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:33.490
 what's a clock it's 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.490
 stopped 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:42.799
 however, there are several types of 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:44.899
 different surprise checks there are the 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:47.630
 surprise checks on the first day the 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:48.110
 back to school hello I'm even 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:49.550
 the path 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.800
 your new teacher from 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:54.020
 mathematics I'm delighted to do for 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.420
 with you this year I we have very 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.280
 very well to hear us and for better 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.130
 get to know 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.869
 Interro surprise lovemaking frolics otherwise he 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.060
 there are surprise checks or even the 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:06.200
 teacher does not expect it because 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.239
 sometimes teachers in 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.429
 surprise checks because students 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:12.709
 finally annoyed when I say that it's 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.540
 since they say they will give a 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:20.959
 surprise control because the control 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:24.950
 him he never first second time 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:33.109
 time I voted against 1 strongly of a 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:34.940
 little tenth time 21 points shut up 

00:02:33.109 --> 00:02:37.730
 otherwise it's easy for everyone 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:40.310
 world my agreement most of the time the 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.420
 teacher gives the controls several 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.370
 weeks to the advanced 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:47.990
 but sometimes the teachers give them 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:49.550
 controls especially what does that mean 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:52.100
 a control over all this could very 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:03:01.070
 kindly say that but it could 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:03:02.090
 perfectly mean on that and more 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.620
 when they say they will do some 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.420
 controls especially is what they're going 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.100
 do checks on every thing 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:11.420
 has made us since the beginning of 

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:14.420
 the year it can do a lot and 

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:17.450
 I have to give his mother a 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:19.870
 lathered for me I have to answer to 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.870
 all the questions 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:27.110
 how long 30 minutes 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.820
 ok yes because sometimes teachers 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.500
 arrived very late on the day of 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:33.620
 control 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:36.550
 so you only have 30 left 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.550
 two hours square 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:40.940
 in high school and high school there are less 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.680
 in less control of conjugation but 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.940
 when people no it's really they 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.400
 have no luck because this is 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:48.410
 more questions conjugate the verb 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.940
 eat in the present in the first person 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:52.670
 singular it's questions 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:54.770
 a lot harder because if 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.600
 conjugation there you will never see them 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:58.550
 in the books and it would surprise me that 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.510
 people use it conjugate do it 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:01.160
 to do to all people 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:04.090
 singular plural to more than perfect 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:06.440
 has supplanted france eire passive and active 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:20.959
 and but I do not know the answer to 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:22.520
 the sava yeah it's going sometimes in the 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:25.460
 controls there are questions to which 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.300
 you never have after the answers of 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:28.970
 your whole life 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:30.770
 37 x 1080 aiming by the root of 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.660
 bad faith of the head of your own 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:37.460
 offers of francs would be the same if we 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:39.050
 is in fifth yeah I know sometimes 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:41.720
 the teachers gives the corrections of 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:43.520
 checks right after you 've done 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:44.750
 control is there then necessarily you 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:54.620
 you realize that you have everything 

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:57.190
 missed here I'm groans second role but it 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.190
 will break the balls 

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:15.909
