00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:15.780
 I was telling him that this car was presented 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.699
 the first months of this year to all 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.430
 engine had the opportunity to test the ldl and 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.170
 which is the most equipped car in another range 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:24.420
 the front of the stratus is discarded with 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.269
 a very thrown lid of a huge holder 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.789
 patents in the lower part of perth and 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:35.010
 has a very dynamic gold shape about 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:37.350
 x of 0 31 has 4 meters 73 in length 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:42.360
 exterior measurements are completed with a 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:44.219
 between 174 height one meter 38 and 181 of 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.180
 Wide tank capacity 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:50.640
 fuel 61 liters in the tail of the 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.890
 car has a built-in brake light 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.390
 on the lid of the trunk and that has a lot 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.390
 what to do with the security issue 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:06.410
 the keychain incorporates a command to 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:07.520
 opening distance of doors and envelope 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.710
 the driver's door panel 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.990
 there are the salsa commands 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.240
 electric glasses blocking the 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.220
 lift rear glass and the closing 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.600
 they have made the doors and a control 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.800
 remote so you can face 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:23.380
 josÃ© tecoh dog mirrors 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.060
 The steering wheel has good size has 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.070
 airbag in the horn and in the part 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.530
 central while the sides are 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.930
 find the control commands 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:34.930
 Cruise speed is to say you can 

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.040
 put 90 80 or 100 kilometers per hour and 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.320
 it leaves the other nailed and 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:42.430
 automatically the car follows that 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:45.070
 speed in addition this column address 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:47.350
 of the regulation in the height above 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:48.700
 or below and on the key the column 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.340
 address are the commands of the 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.920
 lights and on the right the control of 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.420
 wiper washer 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.299
 the board has a tachometer 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.100
 fuel level speedometer 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:01.409
 Water temperature in addition to the marker 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:04.560
 that tells us permanently what 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.400
 change let's make this fundamental for 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.680
 a car 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:11.580
 Sequential velocity bio deals 

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.580
 automatic no 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.720
 the gear lever that will see it 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:20.160
 has two lanes a series of work 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:21.840
 and offers to the side the glove compartment of 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.600
 good capacity considering the 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.580
 presence of larvae but because of the leakage in 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.440
 the center of the seats has another 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:32.010
 glove compartment with purse 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:35.040
 also in there are the controls for 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:36.990
 the heating of the seats have 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.090
 electrical regulation forward 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:41.520
 backwards and the belts are also 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.500
 can adjust the trunk in height 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:48.600
 you can open the hair inside the 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:50.190
 automobile capacity of trunk 485 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.290
 liters 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.050
 the engine of this strata is a verse of 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:58.560
 60 degree view with a displacement of 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:00.480
 2400 97 centimeters public with four 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:04.580
 valves per injection cylinder 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:08.580
 Sequential multipoint 163 horses to 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:10.950
 5,800 laps of walking in the city is very 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:14.460
 soft remember the four meters 73 of 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:17.880
 long and in terms of consumption the stratus 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:21.000
 consumes 14 liters to travel 100 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:23.460
 kilometers at that speed has a 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.580
 autonomy taking into account the 61 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:30.420
 liters capacity of both 429 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:32.130
 kilometers in a little while and we tried it to 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:33.840
 background new power not and also the earth 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:38.300
 which is a motor jack curtain 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.300
 because our paths and lessons 

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.500
 We are in the racetrack of the city of 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.120
 buenos aires here we are doing the 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.350
 Acceleration tests I'm telling you 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:02.200
 I 'm stratus, I need 11.5 seconds 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:04.690
 to accelerate from 0 to 100 and 17 as five 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:09.130
 seconds to make the 400 meters 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:12.580
 with stopped start the maximum speed 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:16.870
 it was 203 kilometers per hour almost 200 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:19.419
 4 203 800 to be traction and motor 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:22.690
 front did not show any trend 

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:24.850
 and you of horn even in some of 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.590
 the parts of the motorcycle slalom certain 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.050
 tendency to pull out the tail then 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:32.890
 remembering that it has 4 meters 73 of 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:37.030
 long and two meters 74 between axes this 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:40.169
 by itself is meaning a good good 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.169
 walk a smooth walk 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:45.039
 the front suspensions of the type of 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.599
 deformable parallelogram based on 

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:49.000
 arms overlaid with bars 

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:51.509
 stabilizers of 31 millimeters of 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.509
 diameter 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:59.070
 the brakes behaved in a way 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:03.460
 excellent stopping the stratus from 90 to 

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:05.830
 0 in only 37 meters with 5 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:07.690
 Of course, you always have to add 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:10.150
 the reaction of the driver what 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:12.490
 we are saying it is the car 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:15.240
 mechanically the car from which 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:18.370
 you squeeze the pedal delay 37 meters 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:22.840
 but you always have to add your own 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:26.969
 reaction to an eventual obstacle that 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:29.579
 you are presented or 90 0 37 meters 

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:32.689
 has four devil brake discs 

00:05:29.579 --> 00:05:32.689
 front has abs 

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:38.320
 and despite not having a huge strip 

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:40.240
 showed virtually no 

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:43.810
 inconvenient to walk on earth the 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:48.790
 total weight of the car thousand 435 kilos and the 

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:51.610
 price that is 34 thousand 900 dollars with 

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:54.960
 a guarantee of 2 years or 50 thousand 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:54.960
 kilometers what has
