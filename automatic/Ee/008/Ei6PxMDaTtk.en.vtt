00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
bits or actually in those glowing bits

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.210 
bits or actually in those glowing bits
there<00:03:04.390> is<00:03:04.540> a<00:03:04.570> scanner<00:03:05.140> a<00:03:05.320> little<00:03:05.590> computer<00:03:06.040> so

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:06.220 
there is a scanner a little computer so

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.920 
there is a scanner a little computer so
we<00:03:06.340> got<00:03:06.459> a<00:03:06.489> switch<00:03:07.060> declare<00:03:07.390> and<00:03:07.540> go<00:03:07.660> people

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
we got a switch declare and go people

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.020 
we got a switch declare and go people
what<00:03:08.110> would<00:03:08.200> people<00:03:08.350> and<00:03:08.799> hack<00:03:09.250> that<00:03:09.579> terminal

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.030 
what would people and hack that terminal

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.280
