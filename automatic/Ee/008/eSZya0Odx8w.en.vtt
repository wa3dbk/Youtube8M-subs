Mount<00:03:59.230> Armstrong<00:03:59.710> we'd<00:04:00.670> seen<00:04:00.880> a<00:04:00.910> bit<00:04:01.090> of<00:04:01.120> Sun

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
Mount Armstrong we'd seen a bit of Sun

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.790 
Mount Armstrong we'd seen a bit of Sun
throughout<00:04:02.650> the<00:04:02.800> morning<00:04:03.720> but<00:04:04.720> it<00:04:05.560> looked

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:05.800 
throughout the morning but it looked

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.370 
throughout the morning but it looked
steep<00:04:06.160> enough<00:04:06.430> and<00:04:06.730> it<00:04:07.630> just<00:04:07.930> looked<00:04:08.140> perfect

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:08.380 
steep enough and it just looked perfect

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:11.250 
steep enough and it just looked perfect
for<00:04:08.980> what<00:04:09.100> we<00:04:09.250> were<00:04:09.370> trying<00:04:09.580> to<00:04:09.700> do<00:04:09.910> I<00:04:10.260> dropped

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 
for what we were trying to do I dropped

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.580 
for what we were trying to do I dropped
in<00:04:11.440> off<00:04:11.650> the<00:04:11.800> ridge<00:04:12.010> it<00:04:12.400> was<00:04:12.580> steep<00:04:13.440> snow<00:04:14.440> is

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
in off the ridge it was steep snow is

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.410 
in off the ridge it was steep snow is
pretty<00:04:14.830> loose<00:04:15.040> the<00:04:15.280> wet<00:04:15.430> slide<00:04:15.700> started<00:04:16.150> going

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:16.420 
pretty loose the wet slide started going

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:18.449 
pretty loose the wet slide started going
immediately<00:04:17.019> but<00:04:17.830> there<00:04:18.070> was<00:04:18.160> a<00:04:18.190> lot<00:04:18.430> of

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
immediately but there was a lot of

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:20.660 
immediately but there was a lot of
different<00:04:19.359> channels<00:04:19.570> for<00:04:19.810> it<00:04:19.989> to<00:04:20.049> go<00:04:20.200> down

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:20.670 
different channels for it to go down

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:23.340 
different channels for it to go down
popped<00:04:21.670> a<00:04:21.820> little<00:04:22.030> air<00:04:22.180> down<00:04:22.990> was<00:04:23.140> quite

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.350 
popped a little air down was quite

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:24.870 
popped a little air down was quite
variable<00:04:23.740> a<00:04:23.950> bit<00:04:24.160> harder<00:04:24.520> than<00:04:24.670> what<00:04:24.820> I

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
variable a bit harder than what I

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.910 
variable a bit harder than what I
expected<00:04:25.090> but<00:04:25.690> I<00:04:25.960> managed<00:04:26.590> to<00:04:26.620> pull<00:04:26.830> it

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:26.920 
expected but I managed to pull it

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:27.240 
expected but I managed to pull it
together

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
together

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:32.550 
together
now<00:04:30.030> we've<00:04:31.030> walked<00:04:31.240> in<00:04:31.480> in<00:04:31.660> a<00:04:31.750> storm<00:04:32.080> knowing

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
now we've walked in in a storm knowing

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.930 
now we've walked in in a storm knowing
that<00:04:32.710> it<00:04:32.860> was<00:04:32.980> going<00:04:33.310> to<00:04:33.400> clear<00:04:33.840> but<00:04:35.700> we<00:04:36.700> didn't

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
that it was going to clear but we didn't

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.390 
that it was going to clear but we didn't
expect<00:04:37.330> that<00:04:37.510> much<00:04:37.720> East<00:04:38.260> northeasterly<00:04:38.830> wind

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
expect that much East northeasterly wind

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.850 
expect that much East northeasterly wind
the<00:04:39.550> first<00:04:39.790> day<00:04:40.060> it<00:04:40.780> caused<00:04:41.050> a<00:04:41.260> lot<00:04:41.410> of<00:04:41.590> clouds

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
the first day it caused a lot of clouds

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.070 
the first day it caused a lot of clouds
and<00:04:42.280> we<00:04:42.550> were<00:04:42.669> unsure<00:04:42.880> whether<00:04:43.390> or<00:04:43.660> not

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
and we were unsure whether or not

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.850 
and we were unsure whether or not
now<00:04:44.680> Brewster<00:04:45.190> would<00:04:45.400> would<00:04:46.360> be<00:04:46.660> possible<00:04:47.500> we

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
now Brewster would would be possible we

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.760 
now Brewster would would be possible we
spent<00:04:48.160> a<00:04:48.220> bit<00:04:48.370> of<00:04:48.400> time<00:04:48.960> on<00:04:49.960> Mount<00:04:50.230> Armstrong

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
spent a bit of time on Mount Armstrong

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:52.840 
and by about two o'clock Mount Brewster

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.100 
and by about two o'clock Mount Brewster
was<00:04:52.990> just<00:04:53.200> showing<00:04:53.530> its<00:04:53.680> head
