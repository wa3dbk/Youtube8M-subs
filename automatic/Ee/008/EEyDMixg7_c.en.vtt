because I didn't know it and I've been

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.740 
because I didn't know it and I've been
talking<00:00:10.980> to<00:00:11.010> drew<00:00:11.250> on<00:00:11.370> the<00:00:11.490> phone<00:00:11.730> he<00:00:12.450> has

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
talking to drew on the phone he has

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.070 
talking to drew on the phone he has
ordered<00:00:13.259> a<00:00:13.380> prototype<00:00:13.980> and<00:00:14.660> I'm<00:00:15.660> going<00:00:15.990> to

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
ordered a prototype and I'm going to

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.750 
ordered a prototype and I'm going to
show<00:00:16.230> it<00:00:16.410> to<00:00:16.529> you<00:00:16.680> probably<00:00:17.430> in<00:00:17.550> the<00:00:17.640> next

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
show it to you probably in the next

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.670 
show it to you probably in the next
video<00:00:18.150> work<00:00:18.570> that<00:00:18.720> he's<00:00:18.900> going<00:00:19.080> to<00:00:19.199> overnight

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
video work that he's going to overnight

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.210 
video work that he's going to overnight
the<00:00:20.539> prototype<00:00:21.539> to<00:00:21.750> me<00:00:21.980> but<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.189> interesting

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
the prototype to me but the interesting

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.400 
the prototype to me but the interesting
thing<00:00:23.789> is<00:00:24.060> I've<00:00:24.539> already<00:00:24.720> told<00:00:25.019> you<00:00:25.260> we're

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
thing is I've already told you we're

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.439 
thing is I've already told you we're
going<00:00:25.529> to<00:00:25.590> put<00:00:25.740> a<00:00:25.800> slot<00:00:26.099> in<00:00:26.130> here<00:00:26.490> so<00:00:27.150> that<00:00:27.420> the

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
going to put a slot in here so that the

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.790 
going to put a slot in here so that the
one<00:00:27.900> tool<00:00:28.260> can<00:00:28.650> do<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:29.189> neutral<00:00:29.699> the<00:00:30.240> warm

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:30.800 
one tool can do the neutral the warm

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.100 
one tool can do the neutral the warm
extra<00:00:31.800> warming<00:00:32.369> uh<00:00:32.630> without<00:00:33.630> having<00:00:33.960> to<00:00:34.079> go

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
extra warming uh without having to go

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.440 
extra warming uh without having to go
and<00:00:34.440> have<00:00:34.620> a<00:00:34.649> different<00:00:35.340> tools<00:00:35.579> for<00:00:36.270> color

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
and have a different tools for color

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.330 
and have a different tools for color
balancing<00:00:36.960> so<00:00:37.230> the<00:00:37.469> one<00:00:37.649> tool<00:00:37.860> will<00:00:38.100> be<00:00:38.219> able

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
balancing so the one tool will be able

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.119 
balancing so the one tool will be able
to<00:00:38.489> do<00:00:38.790> maybe<00:00:39.540> two<00:00:39.840> three<00:00:40.230> who<00:00:40.680> knows<00:00:40.890> how<00:00:41.100> many

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
to do maybe two three who knows how many

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.979 
to do maybe two three who knows how many
that<00:00:41.579> Drew's<00:00:42.059> going<00:00:42.239> to<00:00:42.329> come<00:00:42.480> up<00:00:42.600> with<00:00:42.629> he's

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
that Drew's going to come up with he's

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.830 
that Drew's going to come up with he's
the<00:00:43.170> one<00:00:43.350> that's<00:00:43.379> engineering<00:00:44.370> this<00:00:44.550> stuff

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:44.840 
the one that's engineering this stuff

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.750 
the one that's engineering this stuff
the<00:00:45.840> interesting<00:00:46.320> thing<00:00:46.379> is<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.980> new<00:00:47.340> color

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
the interesting thing is the new color

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.610 
the interesting thing is the new color
right<00:00:48.030> Pro<00:00:49.020> area<00:00:49.829> 51<00:00:50.550> unit<00:00:51.000> all<00:00:51.270> right<00:00:51.620> is

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
right Pro area 51 unit all right is

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.740 
right Pro area 51 unit all right is
going<00:00:53.100> to<00:00:53.219> be<00:00:53.340> able<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:53.789> pass<00:00:54.000> more<00:00:54.360> light

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
going to be able to pass more light

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.510 
going to be able to pass more light
through<00:00:55.020> it<00:00:55.170> there's<00:00:55.500> new<00:00:55.710> technologies<00:00:56.370> in

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
through it there's new technologies in

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.000 
through it there's new technologies in
the<00:00:56.550> plastics<00:00:57.059> and<00:00:57.270> I<00:00:57.660> wasn't<00:00:57.989> aware<00:00:58.079> of<00:00:58.289> it<00:00:58.469> so

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
the plastics and I wasn't aware of it so

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.439 
the plastics and I wasn't aware of it so
this<00:00:59.309> is<00:00:59.340> going<00:00:59.640> to<00:00:59.730> take<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.030> color<00:01:00.210> right

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
this is going to take the color right

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.490 
this is going to take the color right
pro<00:01:00.780> and<00:01:01.079> kick<00:01:01.680> it<00:01:01.859> up<00:01:02.010> a<00:01:02.250> whole<00:01:03.059> big<00:01:03.809> notch

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
pro and kick it up a whole big notch

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.480 
pro and kick it up a whole big notch
like<00:01:05.280> Emeril<00:01:05.729> says<00:01:05.970> BAM<00:01:06.680> okay<00:01:07.680> so<00:01:07.740> he's<00:01:08.250> got

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
like Emeril says BAM okay so he's got

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.570 
like Emeril says BAM okay so he's got
he's<00:01:09.000> drew<00:01:09.960> is<00:01:10.110> doing<00:01:10.409> a<00:01:10.530> BAM<00:01:10.890> on<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.369> caller

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
he's drew is doing a BAM on the caller

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.000 
he's drew is doing a BAM on the caller
ID<00:01:11.790> pro<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.360> it's<00:01:13.140> going<00:01:13.350> to<00:01:13.439> pass<00:01:13.650> through<00:01:13.920> a

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
ID pro and it's going to pass through a

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.710 
ID pro and it's going to pass through a
lot<00:01:14.280> more<00:01:14.520> light<00:01:14.760> now<00:01:14.939> what<00:01:15.150> does<00:01:15.240> that<00:01:15.420> mean

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
lot more light now what does that mean

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.240 
lot more light now what does that mean
it<00:01:15.990> means<00:01:16.049> you're<00:01:16.320> going<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:16.470> get<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:17.009> high

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
it means you're going to get the high

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.910 
it means you're going to get the high
value<00:01:17.759> of<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.030> diffusion<00:01:18.600> which<00:01:19.259> is<00:01:19.500> going<00:01:19.830> to

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
value of the diffusion which is going to

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.010 
value of the diffusion which is going to
diffuse<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:20.850> colors<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.509> give<00:01:21.689> you<00:01:21.869> the

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
diffuse the colors and give you the

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.109 
diffuse the colors and give you the
color<00:01:22.229> balance<00:01:22.680> but<00:01:23.310> you'll<00:01:23.460> be<00:01:23.580> able<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:23.970> do

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
color balance but you'll be able to do

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.210 
color balance but you'll be able to do
it<00:01:24.150> even<00:01:24.420> in<00:01:24.689> darker<00:01:25.110> environments<00:01:25.860> where<00:01:26.070> the

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
it even in darker environments where the

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.760 
it even in darker environments where the
color<00:01:26.400> right<00:01:26.610> pro<00:01:27.080> has<00:01:28.080> a<00:01:28.110> certain<00:01:28.439> amount<00:01:28.650> of

light passing through it the color I pro
area<00:01:30.930> 51<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.770> new<00:01:31.890> unit<00:01:32.220> that's<00:01:32.369> coming<00:01:32.670> out

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
area 51 the new unit that's coming out

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.719 
area 51 the new unit that's coming out
is<00:01:33.000> going<00:01:33.840> to<00:01:34.229> use<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.770> new<00:01:35.009> technologies

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
is going to use the new technologies

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.910 
is going to use the new technologies
that<00:01:35.939> are<00:01:36.000> out<00:01:36.210> there<00:01:36.470> that's<00:01:37.470> not<00:01:37.680> in<00:01:37.890> the

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
that are out there that's not in the

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.249 
that are out there that's not in the
color<00:01:38.189> right<00:01:38.369> pro<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:38.909> it's<00:01:39.570> going<00:01:39.930> to<00:01:40.020> pass

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
color right pro and it's going to pass

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.550 
color right pro and it's going to pass
through<00:01:40.530> even<00:01:41.100> more<00:01:41.460> light<00:01:42.030> then<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:43.290> color<00:01:43.500> i

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
through even more light then the color i

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.830 
through even more light then the color i
pro<00:01:43.860> is<00:01:44.040> passing<00:01:44.520> through<00:01:44.549> so<00:01:45.119> this<00:01:45.329> is<00:01:45.479> a<00:01:45.509> big

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
pro is passing through so this is a big

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
to pass more light and the plastics are

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.009 
to pass more light and the plastics are

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
going to give a more accurate color

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.979 
going to give a more accurate color
balance<00:02:53.540> the<00:02:54.459> grays<00:02:55.459> and<00:02:56.060> the<00:02:56.120> blacks<00:02:56.239> and<00:02:56.900> the

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:02.420 
that is going to be more true color so

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:03.640 
that is going to be more true color so
that's<00:03:02.600> the<00:03:02.780> important<00:03:03.200> thing<00:03:03.230> now<00:03:03.380> when<00:03:03.620> I

that's the important thing now when I

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.040 
that's the important thing now when I
get<00:03:03.860> the<00:03:03.980> prototype<00:03:04.630> available<00:03:05.630> in<00:03:05.750> front<00:03:05.959> of

you'll<00:03:34.160> be<00:03:34.250> able<00:03:34.310> to<00:03:34.519> control<00:03:34.790> it<00:03:35.030> are<00:03:35.600> they

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
you'll be able to control it are they

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:37.600 
you'll be able to control it are they
going<00:03:36.320> to<00:03:36.380> be<00:03:36.470> easy<00:03:36.650> to<00:03:36.890> scratch<00:03:37.220> how

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 
going to be easy to scratch how

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.229 
going to be easy to scratch how
sensitive<00:03:38.120> are<00:03:38.360> they<00:03:39.070> to<00:03:40.070> being<00:03:40.549> damaged<00:03:41.030> and

00:03:41.229 --> 00:03:41.239 
sensitive are they to being damaged and

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:44.140 
sensitive are they to being damaged and
stuff<00:03:41.480> like<00:03:41.660> that<00:03:41.720> then<00:03:42.709> at<00:03:43.190> the<00:03:43.549> scratches

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
stuff like that then at the scratches

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:46.420 
stuff like that then at the scratches
and<00:03:44.329> the<00:03:44.390> damage<00:03:44.750> doesn't<00:03:44.989> matter<00:03:45.370> so<00:03:46.370> you

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
and the damage doesn't matter so you

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.550 
and the damage doesn't matter so you
don't<00:03:47.000> have<00:03:47.180> to<00:03:47.359> be<00:03:47.540> worried<00:03:48.019> about<00:03:48.140> them

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
don't have to be worried about them

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.860 
don't have to be worried about them
they're<00:03:48.799> not<00:03:49.010> like<00:03:49.220> a<00:03:49.250> lens<00:03:49.640> glass<00:03:50.090> they're

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
they're not like a lens glass they're

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.080 
they're not like a lens glass they're
not<00:03:51.049> like<00:03:51.230> a<00:03:51.260> filter<00:03:51.799> glass<00:03:52.070> all<00:03:52.730> they're

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
not like a filter glass all they're

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:55.199 
not like a filter glass all they're
doing<00:03:53.120> is<00:03:53.630> they're<00:03:53.709> under<00:03:54.709> very<00:03:55.010> strict

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:55.209 
doing is they're under very strict

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:58.360 
doing is they're under very strict
control<00:03:56.290> changing<00:03:57.290> the<00:03:57.440> color<00:03:57.739> that's<00:03:58.070> going

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 
control changing the color that's going

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:59.740 
control changing the color that's going
to<00:03:58.459> hit<00:03:58.579> the<00:03:58.609> sensor<00:03:59.090> where<00:03:59.269> it's<00:03:59.450> going<00:03:59.690> to

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 
to hit the sensor where it's going to

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:01.509 
to hit the sensor where it's going to
get<00:03:59.840> the<00:03:59.959> color<00:04:00.140> balance<00:04:00.530> so<00:04:00.980> you<00:04:01.070> don't<00:04:01.370> have

00:04:01.509 --> 00:04:01.519 
get the color balance so you don't have

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:03.069 
get the color balance so you don't have
to<00:04:01.700> worry<00:04:01.880> about<00:04:02.000> the<00:04:02.209> durability<00:04:02.390> of<00:04:02.630> the

to worry about the durability of the

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:04.630 
to worry about the durability of the
discs<00:04:03.440> that<00:04:03.470> go<00:04:03.680> in<00:04:03.829> you<00:04:04.040> can<00:04:04.190> toss<00:04:04.400> them

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:04.640 
discs that go in you can toss them

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:06.130 
discs that go in you can toss them
around<00:04:04.730> as<00:04:05.299> a<00:04:05.420> matter<00:04:05.600> of<00:04:05.690> fact<00:04:05.750> they're<00:04:06.019> going

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:06.140 
around as a matter of fact they're going

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:07.360 
around as a matter of fact they're going
to<00:04:06.200> have<00:04:06.350> a<00:04:06.380> hole<00:04:06.620> in<00:04:06.769> them<00:04:06.890> so<00:04:07.010> you<00:04:07.100> can<00:04:07.220> put

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370 
to have a hole in them so you can put

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:09.699 
to have a hole in them so you can put
them<00:04:07.519> on<00:04:07.609> a<00:04:07.640> keyring<00:04:08.120> can<00:04:08.660> slide<00:04:08.989> it<00:04:09.170> in<00:04:09.410> slide

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:09.709 
them on a keyring can slide it in slide

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:12.069 
them on a keyring can slide it in slide
it<00:04:09.890> out<00:04:10.010> they're<00:04:10.609> not<00:04:10.880> sensitive<00:04:11.390> to<00:04:11.540> damage

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:12.079 
it out they're not sensitive to damage

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:14.650 
it out they're not sensitive to damage
even<00:04:12.500> if<00:04:12.769> it<00:04:12.890> does<00:04:13.100> get<00:04:13.370> scratched<00:04:13.820> it's<00:04:14.420> not

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 
even if it does get scratched it's not

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:16.539 
even if it does get scratched it's not
going<00:04:14.840> to<00:04:14.930> affect<00:04:14.959> your<00:04:15.470> color<00:04:15.859> balancing<00:04:16.400> so

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:16.549 
going to affect your color balancing so

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:17.979 
going to affect your color balancing so
that's<00:04:16.729> a<00:04:16.820> very<00:04:17.030> important<00:04:17.510> thing<00:04:17.660> because<00:04:17.810> I

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
that's a very important thing because I

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:19.539 
that's a very important thing because I
don't<00:04:18.260> want<00:04:18.289> people<00:04:18.680> going<00:04:18.799> around<00:04:19.039> thinking

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
don't want people going around thinking

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:21.940 
don't want people going around thinking
like<00:04:19.700> oh<00:04:19.880> I<00:04:20.180> have<00:04:20.599> this<00:04:20.780> super<00:04:21.019> sensitive<00:04:21.590> tool

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:21.950 
like oh I have this super sensitive tool

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:24.430 
like oh I have this super sensitive tool
that<00:04:22.190> needs<00:04:22.400> to<00:04:22.520> be<00:04:22.640> protected<00:04:23.140> greatly<00:04:24.140> in<00:04:24.260> my

that needs to be protected greatly in my

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.110 
that needs to be protected greatly in my
camera<00:04:24.830> case<00:04:25.039> no<00:04:25.370> toss

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:28.280 
around this is practically unbreakable

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.340 
around this is practically unbreakable
I'm<00:04:28.940> sure<00:04:29.180> if<00:04:29.330> i<00:04:29.389> run<00:04:29.570> it<00:04:29.720> over<00:04:29.780> with<00:04:30.080> the<00:04:30.169> car

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:30.350 
I'm sure if i run it over with the car

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:32.110 
I'm sure if i run it over with the car
would<00:04:30.590> break<00:04:30.740> but<00:04:31.040> basically<00:04:31.490> the<00:04:31.699> plastics

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:32.120 
would break but basically the plastics

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.600 
would break but basically the plastics
are<00:04:32.240> unbreakable<00:04:32.540> and<00:04:32.990> the<00:04:33.860> new<00:04:34.130> discs<00:04:34.520> that

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:34.610 
are unbreakable and the new discs that

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:36.270 
are unbreakable and the new discs that

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 
are going to go in the white balance

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:38.950 
are going to go in the white balance
discs<00:04:37.280> that's<00:04:38.240> going<00:04:38.479> to<00:04:38.570> give<00:04:38.690> you<00:04:38.810> the

they're going to be very resistant also

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:45.879 
they're going to be very resistant also
even<00:04:44.510> if<00:04:44.600> they<00:04:44.750> do<00:04:44.810> get<00:04:45.110> scratched<00:04:45.470> it's<00:04:45.710> got

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:49.040 
not going to affect the color balanced I

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.680 
not going to affect the color balanced I
don't<00:04:49.190> want<00:04:49.310> to<00:04:49.370> get<00:04:49.490> tongue-tied<00:04:49.729> there<00:04:50.210> it

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:50.690 
don't want to get tongue-tied there it

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:53.860 
don't want to get tongue-tied there it
will<00:04:51.050> not<00:04:51.440> affect<00:04:51.820> like<00:04:52.820> it<00:04:52.970> says<00:04:53.180> here<00:04:53.510> it

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:53.870 
will not affect like it says here it

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:55.780 
will not affect like it says here it
will<00:04:54.139> not<00:04:54.440> affect<00:04:54.740> the<00:04:55.010> color<00:04:55.280> balance<00:04:55.669> so

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:55.790 
will not affect the color balance so

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:59.230 
will not affect the color balance so
they<00:04:55.940> are<00:04:56.150> durable<00:04:56.690> it's<00:04:57.169> tough<00:04:57.560> but<00:04:58.520> keep<00:04:59.060> in

00:04:59.230 --> 00:04:59.240 
they are durable it's tough but keep in

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:02.500 
they are durable it's tough but keep in

and<00:05:12.139> it's<00:05:12.320> going<00:05:12.440> to<00:05:12.500> pass<00:05:12.740> through<00:05:12.949> more

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:13.850 
and it's going to pass through more

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:16.360 
and it's going to pass through more
light<00:05:14.330> which<00:05:14.720> is<00:05:14.960> great<00:05:15.260> for<00:05:15.289> you<00:05:15.680> and<00:05:15.889> great

light which is great for you and great
for<00:05:16.580> me<00:05:16.729> because<00:05:16.760> I<00:05:17.150> do<00:05:17.270> a<00:05:17.449> lot<00:05:17.690> of<00:05:17.720> low<00:05:17.990> light

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:18.470 
for me because I do a lot of low light

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:20.920 
for me because I do a lot of low light
work<00:05:18.889> and<00:05:19.160> when<00:05:19.940> I<00:05:20.120> need<00:05:20.360> to<00:05:20.479> get<00:05:20.660> into<00:05:20.810> that

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:20.930 
work and when I need to get into that

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:23.260 
work and when I need to get into that
low<00:05:21.229> light<00:05:21.470> work<00:05:21.800> some<00:05:22.430> of<00:05:22.550> the<00:05:22.639> other<00:05:22.820> discs

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:23.270 
low light work some of the other discs

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:25.990 
low light work some of the other discs
like<00:05:23.419> the<00:05:23.570> expo<00:05:23.960> disc<00:05:24.260> and<00:05:24.770> and<00:05:25.250> others<00:05:25.669> like

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.000 
like the expo disc and and others like

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.390 
like the expo disc and and others like
those<00:05:26.510> caps<00:05:26.870> that<00:05:27.050> you<00:05:27.199> put<00:05:27.380> on<00:05:27.410> the<00:05:27.620> top<00:05:27.830> they

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:28.400 
those caps that you put on the top they

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.520 
those caps that you put on the top they
don't<00:05:28.610> pass<00:05:28.880> through<00:05:29.300> enough<00:05:29.570> light<00:05:29.840> a<00:05:30.110> good

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:30.530 
don't pass through enough light a good

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:32.770 
don't pass through enough light a good
accurate<00:05:30.770> color<00:05:31.340> balance<00:05:31.970> need<00:05:32.240> more<00:05:32.539> light

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:32.780 
accurate color balance need more light

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:35.260 
accurate color balance need more light
to<00:05:32.810> get<00:05:33.139> through<00:05:33.349> to<00:05:33.530> the<00:05:33.620> sensor<00:05:34.010> because<00:05:35.000> if

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:35.270 
to get through to the sensor because if

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:36.940 
to get through to the sensor because if
you<00:05:35.419> don't<00:05:35.539> get<00:05:35.750> the<00:05:35.870> proper<00:05:36.229> amount<00:05:36.349> of<00:05:36.710> life

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:36.950 
you don't get the proper amount of life

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:39.430 
you don't get the proper amount of life
through<00:05:37.280> to<00:05:37.430> the<00:05:37.550> sensor<00:05:37.970> you<00:05:38.599> won't<00:05:38.840> get<00:05:39.020> the

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:39.440 
through to the sensor you won't get the

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.409 
through to the sensor you won't get the
right<00:05:39.620> color<00:05:39.919> balance<00:05:40.370> are<00:05:40.729> with<00:05:40.910> one<00:05:41.180> tool

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:41.419 
right color balance are with one tool

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:43.510 
right color balance are with one tool
I'm<00:05:42.050> going<00:05:42.200> to<00:05:42.380> have<00:05:42.530> more<00:05:42.740> like<00:05:43.010> I'm<00:05:43.250> going<00:05:43.460> to

I'm going to have more like I'm going to

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.120 
I'm going to have more like I'm going to
have<00:05:43.639> more<00:05:43.849> accurate<00:05:44.720> color<00:05:45.410> balance<00:05:45.919> and

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:46.130 
have more accurate color balance and

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:49.000 
have more accurate color balance and
I'll<00:05:46.340> be<00:05:46.460> able<00:05:46.669> to<00:05:46.940> change<00:05:47.240> if<00:05:47.660> I'm<00:05:48.410> doing<00:05:48.710> a
