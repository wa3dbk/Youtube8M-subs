00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:05.869 
I would do they say the darkest hour is
right<00:00:04.200> before<00:00:04.350> the<00:00:04.590> dawn<00:00:04.740> and<00:00:04.770> unfurl<00:00:05.700> Mike

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
that kind of story I'm guessing that's

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:09.890 
that kind of story I'm guessing that's
like<00:00:08.640> honey<00:00:08.850> because<00:00:09.090> you<00:00:09.390> can<00:00:09.510> really<00:00:09.780> get

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
like honey because you can really get

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.860 
like honey because you can really get
into<00:00:10.170> the<00:00:10.200> drama<00:00:10.650> get<00:00:10.920> into<00:00:11.099> the<00:00:11.420> greater<00:00:12.420> what

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
into the drama get into the greater what

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.539 
into the drama get into the greater what
these<00:00:12.990> people<00:00:13.259> are<00:00:13.320> going<00:00:13.440> through<00:00:13.769> yeah<00:00:14.400> we

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
these people are going through yeah we

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.129 
these people are going through yeah we
spend<00:00:14.820> more<00:00:14.940> time<00:00:15.120> obviously<00:00:15.389> we've<00:00:15.870> got<00:00:15.990> more

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
spend more time obviously we've got more

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.240 
spend more time obviously we've got more
time<00:00:16.350> because<00:00:16.560> we're<00:00:16.680> splitting<00:00:16.980> it<00:00:17.010> across

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
time because we're splitting it across

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.120 
time because we're splitting it across
two<00:00:17.490> movies<00:00:17.820> and<00:00:18.710> there<00:00:19.710> was<00:00:19.800> something<00:00:19.920> about

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
two movies and there was something about

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.769 
two movies and there was something about
taking<00:00:20.699> them<00:00:20.820> out<00:00:20.970> into<00:00:21.180> the<00:00:21.449> big<00:00:21.570> world

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
taking them out into the big world

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.490 
taking them out into the big world
leaving<00:00:22.260> Hogwarts<00:00:22.800> behind<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:24.000> notion<00:00:24.390> that

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:24.500 
leaving Hogwarts behind the notion that

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.830 
leaving Hogwarts behind the notion that
there<00:00:25.500> oddly<00:00:25.859> iconic<00:00:26.580> characters<00:00:27.480> I've<00:00:27.630> spent

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
there oddly iconic characters I've spent

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.630 
there oddly iconic characters I've spent
five<00:00:28.140> and<00:00:28.320> a<00:00:28.349> half<00:00:28.380> years<00:00:28.529> working<00:00:29.099> with<00:00:29.369> them

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
five and a half years working with them

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.780 
five and a half years working with them
so<00:00:30.210> for<00:00:30.390> me<00:00:30.480> there's<00:00:30.689> a<00:00:30.779> there's<00:00:31.230> a<00:00:31.289> there's<00:00:31.790> a

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
so for me there's a there's a there's a

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.470 
so for me there's a there's a there's a
there's<00:00:33.270> a<00:00:33.660> relate<00:00:34.520> IM<00:00:35.520> pyth<00:00:35.730> I<00:00:35.850> so<00:00:36.150> much<00:00:36.300> with

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
there's a relate IM pyth I so much with

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.300 
there's a relate IM pyth I so much with
the<00:00:36.600> characters<00:00:37.140> and<00:00:37.470> obviously<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:38.040> people

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:38.310 
the characters and obviously the people

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:40.430 
the characters and obviously the people
are<00:00:38.430> playing<00:00:38.640> with<00:00:38.940> them<00:00:39.090> and<00:00:39.480> I<00:00:39.810> think<00:00:39.870> for

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
are playing with them and I think for

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.770 
are playing with them and I think for
the<00:00:40.530> millions<00:00:40.950> of<00:00:41.100> fans<00:00:41.310> who<00:00:41.730> love<00:00:41.970> these

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
the millions of fans who love these

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.910 
the millions of fans who love these
characters<00:00:44.420> it<00:00:45.420> becomes<00:00:46.170> oddly<00:00:46.590> compelling

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
characters it becomes oddly compelling

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.630 
characters it becomes oddly compelling
to<00:00:47.190> see<00:00:47.370> them<00:00:47.580> in<00:00:48.090> this<00:00:48.780> very<00:00:49.400> dark<00:00:50.400> and

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
to see them in this very dark and

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.730 
to see them in this very dark and
dangerous<00:00:50.880> world<00:00:51.630> that<00:00:52.050> feels<00:00:52.200> much<00:00:52.440> realer

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:52.740 
dangerous world that feels much realer

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.740 
dangerous world that feels much realer
when<00:00:52.950> were<00:00:53.040> at<00:00:53.130> Hogwarts<00:00:53.550> because<00:00:54.330> it's<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:54.570> big

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
when were at Hogwarts because it's a big

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.150 
when were at Hogwarts because it's a big
wonderful<00:00:54.960> castle<00:00:55.560> that<00:00:55.680> even<00:00:55.860> when<00:00:55.980> there's

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
wonderful castle that even when there's

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.090 
wonderful castle that even when there's
deputy<00:00:56.580> it<00:00:57.240> always<00:00:57.690> feels<00:00:57.960> sort<00:00:58.200> of<00:00:58.290> safe<00:00:58.530> but

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
deputy it always feels sort of safe but

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.560 
deputy it always feels sort of safe but
there's<00:00:59.250> something<00:00:59.580> more<00:00:59.760> haunting<00:01:00.300> about

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
there's something more haunting about

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.399 
there's something more haunting about
them<00:01:00.750> being<00:01:01.010> away<00:01:02.010> from<00:01:02.070> all<00:01:02.430> of<00:01:02.460> that<00:01:02.580> I<00:01:03.570> was

years ago I just noticed Daniel saying

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.350 
years ago I just noticed Daniel saying
that<00:01:10.620> he<00:01:10.680> got<00:01:10.740> a<00:01:10.800> text<00:01:11.130> from<00:01:11.190> JK<00:01:11.790> and<00:01:12.150> she<00:01:12.270> was

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
that he got a text from JK and she was

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.120 
that he got a text from JK and she was
writing<00:01:12.510> this<00:01:12.690> book<00:01:12.870> and<00:01:13.050> said<00:01:13.230> she<00:01:13.770> described

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
writing this book and said she described

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.770 
writing this book and said she described
it<00:01:14.220> as<00:01:14.400> a<00:01:14.430> bizarre<00:01:14.820> little<00:01:15.000> road<00:01:15.270> movie<00:01:15.600> and

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.810 
it as a bizarre little road movie and
that<00:01:15.990> notion<00:01:16.260> that<00:01:16.530> really<00:01:17.130> it's<00:01:17.550> quite

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
that notion that really it's quite

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.280 
that notion that really it's quite
cinematic<00:01:18.330> because<00:01:18.480> you've<00:01:18.570> got<00:01:18.690> car<00:01:18.930> chases
