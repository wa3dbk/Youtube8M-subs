gear pretty significant contact yeah
that<00:02:59.840> makes<00:03:00.049> me<00:03:00.200> nervous<00:03:00.379> about<00:03:00.620> the<00:03:00.859> front<00:03:01.010> of

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:01.069 
that makes me nervous about the front of

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:02.229 
that makes me nervous about the front of
that<00:03:01.129> truck<00:03:01.340> but<00:03:01.489> if<00:03:01.549> it<00:03:01.639> was<00:03:01.760> overheating<00:03:02.150> we

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
that truck but if it was overheating we

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:03.610 
that truck but if it was overheating we
would<00:03:02.389> have<00:03:02.480> seen<00:03:02.659> some<00:03:02.900> water<00:03:03.139> shooting<00:03:03.500> out

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
would have seen some water shooting out

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:04.869 
would have seen some water shooting out
of<00:03:03.680> the<00:03:03.769> front<00:03:03.950> of<00:03:04.040> it<00:03:04.129> so<00:03:04.159> I<00:03:04.280> guess<00:03:04.459> he's<00:03:04.669> fine

00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:04.879 
of the front of it so I guess he's fine

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:06.580 
of the front of it so I guess he's fine
but<00:03:05.090> that's<00:03:05.239> a<00:03:05.329> lot<00:03:05.629> of<00:03:05.689> contact

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
but that's a lot of contact

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.979 
but that's a lot of contact
