00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.880
 fairly good 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:06.890
 let's review the images of what 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:09.590
 happened today before returning 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.180
 to wellington with our partners that 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.250
 already ready to have all the 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:16.670
 reactions everything that has happened and what 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:19.070
 that will continue to happen in new zealand 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.380
 that's how the game started with the card 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.450
 yellow for Luis Montes a game that 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.350
 it was very intense more and that not winning the 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.500
 I had very complicated 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.150
 intensity within the deficiencies and 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.870
 at some point this innocence of the 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.940
 great is 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:35.770
 they never lowered their arms they never left 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:38.620
 to fight with a lot of dignity with a lot 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.510
 self-love but simply and simply 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.640
 when there is no football, it is very 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:44.530
 complicated that you reach for something more 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:47.770
 11th minute of the first time 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:50.320
 there is the goal and rock with the zapatazo and 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.840
 the goalkeeper in the background preventing 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.060
 that seemed the first entry of the 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:58.420
 Mexican set that would be a feast in 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.670
 offensive that attacked 123 any 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.280
 number of times 2 minute service 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.520
 at the end of Giménez and the goalkeeper who 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.700
 move away 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:11.090
 the kiwi team was still saving 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:13.099
 14 minutes again mexico to the boarding 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.959
 found some link found some and that 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:21.319
 service and what resolution or teacher 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:24.410
 sensational oribe peralta the beautiful that 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:28.099
 I would have a fantastic night in new 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:29.870
 zealand marked the first and put the 

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:32.450
 last nail in the coffin to the 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.970
 New Zealanders already won Mexico 6 x 1 in 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.459
 the global but the selection of the louse 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:40.459
 Herrera wanted more of the goal and for Raúl 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:44.959
 jiménez the impact down and the goalkeeper 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:48.349
 I returned to save your table we were still 1 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:51.380
 0 but Mexico was owner master of 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:54.190
 the ball and 24 minute actions 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:58.579
 the reaction would come from the all whites 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:03:02.780
 moisés muñoz was left with the ball 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:04.700
 went to greater 28 minute ball 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.890
 filtering new account mexico to 

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.270
 approach there is a brush 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.220
 Mexico 

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:13.950
 2 to 0 

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:18.370
 again layun with the service again 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:21.549
 the beautiful with the shot and mexico 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:26.960
 mexico won 2 goals for 0 

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:30.590
 they want more there is more July peralta 3 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:35.930
 3 of the brush 3 of oribe what moment 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:38.010
 Naughty Peralta Mexico takes her pass 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:41.610
 to the world cup 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:43.349
 this way of goal and rock for oribe 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:46.920
 peralta and after this move that is 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:49.370
 extraordinary 4 jiménez 4 jiménez 4 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:49.370
 Wolves 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:56.660
 on the line 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:59.140
 how close was raúl jiménez to sealing 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:02.350
 the 4 by 0 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:07.790
 simply and simply could not minute 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:09.920
 38 would come what is a sabadazo 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:14.239
 for the sauce 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:19.100
 the referee the purchase is a penalty in favor 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:22.000
 from new zealand but eye that would come 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:25.150
 moisés muñoz to save 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.790
 very well moisés muñoz in the background it 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:31.660
 move on the line is thrown to your 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:34.060
 right and ends up preventing 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.969
 first goal in the discount for 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:39.569
 New Zealanders 

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:43.240
 more from mexico more from raúl jiménez and from 

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:47.229
 new account the ball that came out deviated 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:50.530
 45 minute a first time full of 

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:52.780
 goal plays again jiménez line 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:56.020
 diagonal background delayed the impact of 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:59.949
 Paul Aguilar and in the background to the defense 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:02.680
 and preventing the annotation the fourth one 

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:05.110
 he denied the Mexican team that if 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:08.020
 I saw the rest with three but that well 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:10.870
 it could have been six 78 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:12.580
 many many goals could have been 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:15.310
 of the Mexican set part 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:18.970
 complementary 71 minutes of time 

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:21.689
 run there is the mountain and 

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:25.469
 new account almost on the line 

00:05:21.689 --> 00:05:29.189
 the defensive crossing and preventing the 

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:34.439
 annotation was still denied the fourth the 

00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:37.499
 Help johnny tion to 75 minutes other 

00:05:34.439 --> 00:05:40.739
 services nobody closes the clamp the 

00:05:37.499 --> 00:05:44.669
 ball that burns the whole area and mexico 

00:05:40.739 --> 00:05:48.329
 was still with the 3 for 0 minute 79 would come 

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:50.939
 the reaction with pure pride with pure 

00:05:48.329 --> 00:05:54.209
 self-esteem of the Kiwis and with this 

00:05:50.939 --> 00:05:56.110
 criminal that the referee of the 

00:05:54.209 --> 00:05:59.450
 meeting 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:01.490
 controversial maybe but there is a hand 

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:04.010
 de rafa marquez the referee does not hesitate 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:07.910
 mark the and would have the discount of 3 

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:11.210
 goals for 1 and things got a 

00:06:07.910 --> 00:06:13.590
 little by little almost nothing more 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:16.260
 decorous 

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:18.200
 for the Kiwis the celebration of the 

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:21.540
 people did not all carry their banners 

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:24.540
 with the premiere of goal 

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:26.820
 New Zealand followed the boarding 

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:29.910
 there would be four goals for two with one 

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:34.590
 very good extraordinary resolution of 

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:37.650
 error and colom 4 3 by 2 were approaching the 

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:40.680
 all whites and then the reaction would come 

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:42.160
 of the Mexican set to put the 

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:45.460
 things 

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:47.140
 in 86 the set relaxed a bit 

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:48.220
 Mexican took advantage of new zealand but 

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:50.620
 there is 

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:52.840
 would come the goal and rock if the one of the 

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:57.580
 machine gun 

00:06:52.840 --> 00:07:01.690
 I would say Pablo's goal 4 goals by 24 

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:04.720
 29 to 3 the global scoreboard mexico is in 

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:06.960
 the mexico world cup is in the 

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.960
 world
