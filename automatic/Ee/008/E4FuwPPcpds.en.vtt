a long one for each click we do until we
get<00:00:24.480> to<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.660> end<00:00:24.890> where<00:00:25.890> if<00:00:26.250> we<00:00:26.310> click<00:00:27.060> it<00:00:27.180> one

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
get to the end where if we click it one

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.620 
get to the end where if we click it one
more<00:00:27.510> time<00:00:28.429> comes<00:00:29.429> all<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.730> way<00:00:30.029> back<00:00:30.300> to<00:00:30.539> the

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.200 
blog though and beneath those blocks are
these<00:00:51.449> droppers<00:00:52.050> and<00:00:52.520> each<00:00:53.520> drop<00:00:53.879> our<00:00:54.030> leads

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
these droppers and each drop our leads

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.760 
these droppers and each drop our leads
into<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.480> next<00:00:54.570> row<00:00:54.960> which<00:00:55.320> leads<00:00:55.590> them<00:00:55.649> to

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
into the next row which leads them to

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.860 
into the next row which leads them to
the<00:00:55.920> next<00:00:56.070> one's<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.550> next<00:00:56.850> one<00:00:57.030> until<00:00:57.660> we

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
the next one's the next one until we

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.569 
the next one's the next one until we
reach<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.289> end<00:00:58.320> of<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.829> line<00:00:59.010> of<00:00:59.160> droppers

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
reach the end of the line of droppers

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.770 
reach the end of the line of droppers
where<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.809> end<00:01:01.050> dropper<00:01:01.469> will<00:01:01.649> lead<00:01:01.859> into<00:01:02.129> a

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:02.780 
where the end dropper will lead into a

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.850 
where the end dropper will lead into a
line<00:01:03.780> of<00:01:04.070> hoppers<00:01:05.390> which<00:01:06.390> goes<00:01:06.990> down<00:01:07.320> to<00:01:07.710> the

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
line of hoppers which goes down to the

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.219 
line of hoppers which goes down to the
last<00:01:08.070> hopper<00:01:08.400> which<00:01:09.180> leads<00:01:09.510> into<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.930> first

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
last hopper which leads into the first

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.539 
last hopper which leads into the first
dropper<00:01:11.659> now<00:01:12.659> the<00:01:13.229> last<00:01:13.409> part<00:01:13.560> of<00:01:13.830> this<00:01:13.920> is<00:01:14.189> we

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
dropper now the last part of this is we

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.810 
dropper now the last part of this is we
have<00:01:14.880> these<00:01:15.630> comp<00:01:16.110> raters<00:01:16.619> needing<00:01:17.520> from<00:01:17.729> the

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
have these comp raters needing from the

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.710 
have these comp raters needing from the
each<00:01:18.060> dropper<00:01:18.680> into<00:01:19.680> a<00:01:19.710> block<00:01:20.430> and<00:01:20.759> then<00:01:21.540> on

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
each dropper into a block and then on

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.560 
each dropper into a block and then on
top<00:01:21.869> of<00:01:21.930> that<00:01:22.049> block<00:01:22.350> is<00:01:22.560> a<00:01:22.619> redstone<00:01:23.189> lamp<00:01:23.570> so

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
top of that block is a redstone lamp so

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.300 
top of that block is a redstone lamp so
if<00:01:24.630> you<00:01:24.750> do<00:01:24.869> that<00:01:25.020> one<00:01:25.200> for<00:01:25.409> each<00:01:25.530> dropper<00:01:25.920> it

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
if you do that one for each dropper it

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.870 
if you do that one for each dropper it
should<00:01:26.610> work<00:01:26.759> perfectly<00:01:28.130> so<00:01:29.130> that's<00:01:29.700> the

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
should work perfectly so that's the

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.929 
should work perfectly so that's the
tutorial<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:31.220> hope<00:01:32.220> you<00:01:32.400> guys<00:01:32.549> could<00:01:32.790> follow

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
tutorial and hope you guys could follow

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.990 
tutorial and hope you guys could follow
that<00:01:33.500> the<00:01:34.500> last<00:01:35.369> thing<00:01:35.579> i<00:01:35.670> want<00:01:35.790> to<00:01:35.820> show<00:01:35.880> you

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
that the last thing i want to show you

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.810 
that the last thing i want to show you
though<00:01:36.210> is<00:01:36.479> that<00:01:36.960> if<00:01:37.619> we<00:01:37.650> were<00:01:38.009> to<00:01:38.220> just<00:01:38.579> move

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
though is that if we were to just move

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.960 
though is that if we were to just move
that<00:01:38.880> over<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:39.860> then<00:01:40.860> we<00:01:40.890> can<00:01:41.130> just<00:01:41.159> hop<00:01:41.759> into

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:41.970 
that over and then we can just hop into

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.080 
that over and then we can just hop into
this<00:01:42.229> dropper<00:01:43.229> which<00:01:43.380> is<00:01:43.500> now<00:01:43.619> free<00:01:43.979> we<00:01:44.880> can

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
this dropper which is now free we can

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.429 
this dropper which is now free we can
plot<00:01:45.780> 1<00:01:46.049> in<00:01:46.170> there<00:01:46.380> and<00:01:47.899> we<00:01:48.899> have<00:01:49.200> now<00:01:49.380> two

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
plot 1 in there and we have now two

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.340 
plot 1 in there and we have now two
lights<00:01:50.310> lit<00:01:50.640> up<00:01:50.820> and<00:01:51.570> they<00:01:51.689> will<00:01:51.869> move<00:01:52.020> on

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
lights lit up and they will move on

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:56.450 
lights lit up and they will move on
together<00:01:54.170> so<00:01:55.170> it<00:01:55.320> allows<00:01:55.590> multiple<00:01:56.009> inputs

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
together so it allows multiple inputs

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.969 
together so it allows multiple inputs
this<00:01:56.700> thing<00:01:56.880> does<00:01:57.090> and<00:01:57.530> even<00:01:58.530> when<00:01:58.619> we<00:01:58.770> get<00:01:58.890> to

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
this thing does and even when we get to

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.770 
this thing does and even when we get to
the<00:01:59.009> end<00:01:59.100> they<00:01:59.729> just<00:01:59.939> go<00:02:00.090> back<00:02:00.299> to<00:02:00.329> each<00:02:00.570> other

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
the end they just go back to each other

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.480 
the end they just go back to each other
and<00:02:01.310> it<00:02:02.310> works<00:02:02.549> very<00:02:02.700> well<00:02:02.909> so<00:02:03.869> i<00:02:04.430> like<00:02:05.430> to

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
and it works very well so i like to
