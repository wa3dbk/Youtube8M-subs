it's<00:00:07.900> coach<00:00:08.080> Nick<00:00:08.350> I<00:00:08.440> want<00:00:08.530> to<00:00:08.650> show<00:00:08.800> you<00:00:08.860> a

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:08.920 
it's coach Nick I want to show you a

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.530 
it's coach Nick I want to show you a
little<00:00:09.070> biomechanics<00:00:09.970> trick<00:00:10.120> that<00:00:10.270> you<00:00:10.360> can

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:10.540 
little biomechanics trick that you can

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:12.890 
little biomechanics trick that you can
use<00:00:10.570> to<00:00:10.840> enhance<00:00:10.930> your<00:00:11.380> biceps<00:00:12.309> and<00:00:12.460> triceps

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
use to enhance your biceps and triceps

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.589 
use to enhance your biceps and triceps
extensions<00:00:13.900> and<00:00:14.080> curls<00:00:14.379> with<00:00:14.950> the<00:00:15.099> cable

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
extensions and curls with the cable

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.670 
extensions and curls with the cable
traditionally<00:00:16.599> when<00:00:16.750> someone<00:00:17.020> does<00:00:17.170> a<00:00:17.200> biceps

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:17.680 
traditionally when someone does a biceps

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.170 
traditionally when someone does a biceps
curl<00:00:17.770> they<00:00:18.550> have<00:00:18.700> the<00:00:18.820> cable<00:00:19.180> down<00:00:19.360> low<00:00:20.140> and

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
curl they have the cable down low and

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.359 
curl they have the cable down low and
what<00:00:22.180> is<00:00:22.270> it<00:00:22.390> happening<00:00:22.779> is<00:00:22.960> the<00:00:23.259> angle<00:00:24.220> of

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:24.369 
what is it happening is the angle of

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:27.330 
what is it happening is the angle of
force<00:00:24.790> on<00:00:25.000> your<00:00:25.090> biceps<00:00:25.599> is<00:00:25.779> different<00:00:26.340> each

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:27.340 
force on your biceps is different each

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:28.740 
force on your biceps is different each
time<00:00:27.399> you<00:00:27.730> change<00:00:27.939> the<00:00:28.000> height<00:00:28.149> of<00:00:28.239> this<00:00:28.329> cable

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:28.750 
time you change the height of this cable

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:30.300 
time you change the height of this cable
so<00:00:28.930> what<00:00:29.079> I<00:00:29.110> want<00:00:29.290> to<00:00:29.349> show<00:00:29.500> you<00:00:29.560> is<00:00:29.829> a<00:00:30.009> way<00:00:30.130> to

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:30.310 
so what I want to show you is a way to

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.030 
so what I want to show you is a way to
change<00:00:30.640> the<00:00:31.230> angle<00:00:32.230> of<00:00:32.320> the<00:00:32.380> cable<00:00:32.710> relative

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:33.040 
change the angle of the cable relative

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.370 
change the angle of the cable relative
to<00:00:33.160> your<00:00:33.220> arm<00:00:33.430> to<00:00:33.960> stimulate<00:00:34.960> maximally

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:35.380 
to your arm to stimulate maximally

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:36.690 
to your arm to stimulate maximally
sending<00:00:35.649> a<00:00:35.680> different<00:00:36.010> part<00:00:36.190> of<00:00:36.220> your<00:00:36.280> bicep

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:36.700 
sending a different part of your bicep

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.130 
sending a different part of your bicep
now<00:00:36.820> every<00:00:37.059> part<00:00:37.300> of<00:00:37.329> your<00:00:37.420> bicep<00:00:37.780> arbitrary

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:38.140 
now every part of your bicep arbitrary

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:39.900 
now every part of your bicep arbitrary
tricep<00:00:38.530> is<00:00:38.649> only<00:00:38.800> to<00:00:38.949> do<00:00:39.010> a<00:00:39.070> curl<00:00:39.309> or<00:00:39.429> extension

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:39.910 
tricep is only to do a curl or extension

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:41.910 
tricep is only to do a curl or extension
but<00:00:40.030> it's<00:00:40.149> the<00:00:40.420> point<00:00:40.960> of<00:00:41.050> maximal<00:00:41.500> loading<00:00:41.800> of

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:41.920 
but it's the point of maximal loading of

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.139 
but it's the point of maximal loading of
the<00:00:42.010> Muslims<00:00:42.399> so<00:00:42.609> we're<00:00:42.730> going<00:00:42.820> to<00:00:42.879> talk<00:00:43.000> about

00:00:43.139 --> 00:00:43.149 
the Muslims so we're going to talk about

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:45.090 
the Muslims so we're going to talk about
really<00:00:43.449> loading<00:00:43.840> the<00:00:44.230> highest<00:00:44.559> part<00:00:44.800> the<00:00:44.920> peak

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:45.100 
really loading the highest part the peak

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.599 
really loading the highest part the peak
of<00:00:45.250> your<00:00:45.399> bicep<00:00:46.140> what<00:00:47.140> you<00:00:47.260> notice<00:00:47.559> if<00:00:48.190> I<00:00:48.399> have

00:00:48.599 --> 00:00:48.609 
of your bicep what you notice if I have

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:51.959 
of your bicep what you notice if I have
my<00:00:48.789> arms<00:00:49.089> in<00:00:49.239> line<00:00:49.589> for<00:00:50.589> everything<00:00:50.800> my<00:00:51.070> biceps

00:00:51.959 --> 00:00:51.969 
my arms in line for everything my biceps

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:53.939 
my arms in line for everything my biceps
here<00:00:52.179> in<00:00:52.359> line<00:00:52.899> with<00:00:53.050> the<00:00:53.140> cable<00:00:53.499> as<00:00:53.559> I<00:00:53.649> curl<00:00:53.920> it

00:00:53.939 --> 00:00:53.949 
here in line with the cable as I curl it

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:55.979 
here in line with the cable as I curl it
in<00:00:54.160> that's<00:00:54.820> about<00:00:54.940> a<00:00:55.089> 90<00:00:55.329> degree<00:00:55.570> angle<00:00:55.600> to

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:55.989 
in that's about a 90 degree angle to

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:58.169 
in that's about a 90 degree angle to
your<00:00:56.019> forearms<00:00:56.649> and<00:00:56.859> the<00:00:57.219> cable<00:00:57.850> that's<00:00:57.999> the

00:00:58.169 --> 00:00:58.179 
your forearms and the cable that's the

00:00:58.179 --> 00:01:00.689 
your forearms and the cable that's the
highest<00:00:58.359> point<00:00:58.809> of<00:00:58.929> contraction<00:00:59.530> or<00:00:59.890> the<00:01:00.129> area

00:01:00.689 --> 00:01:00.699 
highest point of contraction or the area

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:02.160 
highest point of contraction or the area
where<00:01:00.850> the<00:01:00.940> weight<00:01:01.089> is<00:01:01.120> the<00:01:01.359> heaviest<00:01:01.659> to<00:01:01.960> my

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.170 
where the weight is the heaviest to my

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.140 
where the weight is the heaviest to my
biceps<00:01:02.679> and<00:01:02.859> then<00:01:03.309> it<00:01:03.429> gets<00:01:03.550> a<00:01:03.609> little<00:01:03.670> easier

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:04.150 
biceps and then it gets a little easier

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:05.910 
biceps and then it gets a little easier
as<00:01:04.269> I<00:01:04.390> short<00:01:04.629> the<00:01:04.780> lever<00:01:04.960> arm<00:01:05.170> and<00:01:05.470> then<00:01:05.800> it

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
as I short the lever arm and then it

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.560 
as I short the lever arm and then it
gets<00:01:06.070> easier<00:01:06.490> here<00:01:06.760> at<00:01:06.880> the<00:01:07.000> lever<00:01:07.210> arm<00:01:07.420> is

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.570 
gets easier here at the lever arm is

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.930 
gets easier here at the lever arm is
basically<00:01:07.900> zero<00:01:08.290> so<00:01:08.860> my<00:01:09.040> elbow<00:01:09.250> is<00:01:09.400> at<00:01:09.520> 90

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:09.940 
basically zero so my elbow is at 90

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.480 
basically zero so my elbow is at 90
degrees<00:01:10.619> or<00:01:11.619> when<00:01:11.799> there's<00:01:11.979> a<00:01:12.009> 90<00:01:12.250> rain<00:01:12.369> will

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
degrees or when there's a 90 rain will

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.639 
degrees or when there's a 90 rain will
come<00:01:12.640> here<00:01:12.880> in<00:01:12.970> here<00:01:13.270> more<00:01:14.079> accurately<00:01:14.470> that's

00:01:14.639 --> 00:01:14.649 
come here in here more accurately that's

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:15.929 
come here in here more accurately that's
when<00:01:14.860> everything<00:01:15.100> is<00:01:15.340> the<00:01:15.490> heaviest<00:01:15.790> and

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:15.939 
when everything is the heaviest and

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:17.789 
when everything is the heaviest and
toughest<00:01:16.360> that's<00:01:16.869> the<00:01:17.079> point<00:01:17.259> of<00:01:17.380> maximal

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:17.799 
toughest that's the point of maximal

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:19.770 
toughest that's the point of maximal
load<00:01:17.979> so<00:01:18.640> check<00:01:18.850> this<00:01:19.000> out<00:01:19.240> if<00:01:19.420> I<00:01:19.509> bring<00:01:19.720> my

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
load so check this out if I bring my

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.100 
load so check this out if I bring my
elbows<00:01:20.140> in<00:01:20.290> close<00:01:20.380> and<00:01:21.220> I<00:01:22.060> do<00:01:22.119> a<00:01:22.299> biceps<00:01:22.840> curl<00:01:22.930> I

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
elbows in close and I do a biceps curl I

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.740 
elbows in close and I do a biceps curl I
notice<00:01:23.409> now<00:01:23.770> the<00:01:24.159> 90<00:01:24.700> degree<00:01:25.000> angle<00:01:25.299> is<00:01:25.450> just

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750 
notice now the 90 degree angle is just

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.490 
notice now the 90 degree angle is just
the<00:01:25.930> top<00:01:26.170> of<00:01:26.200> the<00:01:26.469> curl<00:01:26.820> whereas<00:01:27.820> here<00:01:28.299> the<00:01:29.290> 90

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
the top of the curl whereas here the 90

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.289 
the top of the curl whereas here the 90
degree<00:01:29.560> angles<00:01:30.040> at<00:01:30.189> the<00:01:30.399> mid-range<00:01:30.759> of<00:01:31.090> the

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:31.299 
degree angles at the mid-range of the

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:33.810 
degree angles at the mid-range of the
procas<00:01:31.600> here<00:01:31.810> at<00:01:31.899> the<00:01:31.990> top<00:01:32.170> of<00:01:32.320> the<00:01:32.380> curl<00:01:32.820> so

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820 
procas here at the top of the curl so

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.480 
procas here at the top of the curl so
what<00:01:34.240> we're<00:01:34.390> going<00:01:34.509> to<00:01:34.570> do<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:35.829> sugar<00:01:36.039> short

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
what we're going to do the sugar short

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.160 
what we're going to do the sugar short
range<00:01:36.729> curl<00:01:37.090> basically<00:01:37.509> I<00:01:37.570> have<00:01:37.780> it's<00:01:37.960> about

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
range curl basically I have it's about

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.920 
range curl basically I have it's about
bellybutton<00:01:38.740> height<00:01:38.920> I<00:01:39.250> get<00:01:40.180> my<00:01:40.299> elbows<00:01:40.479> to<00:01:40.810> my

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:40.930 
bellybutton height I get my elbows to my

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:42.100 
bellybutton height I get my elbows to my
side<00:01:41.200> and<00:01:41.469> then<00:01:41.590> I'm<00:01:41.680> going<00:01:41.799> to<00:01:41.829> pull

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
side and then I'm going to pull

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:43.750 
side and then I'm going to pull
to<00:01:42.320> my<00:01:42.440> chest<00:01:42.740> and<00:01:42.920> squeeze<00:01:43.070> it<00:01:43.310> for<00:01:43.460> a<00:01:43.490> second

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:43.760 
to my chest and squeeze it for a second

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:45.700 
to my chest and squeeze it for a second
so<00:01:43.940> it's<00:01:44.090> a<00:01:44.150> shorter<00:01:44.510> range<00:01:44.690> curl<00:01:45.050> but<00:01:45.560> I'm

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:45.710 
so it's a shorter range curl but I'm

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:48.520 
so it's a shorter range curl but I'm
maximizing<00:01:46.280> the<00:01:46.610> load<00:01:46.820> at<00:01:47.150> the<00:01:47.960> top<00:01:48.200> of<00:01:48.410> the

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
maximizing the load at the top of the

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.020 
maximizing the load at the top of the
curl<00:01:48.740> that's<00:01:48.890> definitely<00:01:49.490> a<00:01:49.520> different

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 
curl that's definitely a different

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.840 
curl that's definitely a different
feeling<00:01:50.770> you're<00:01:51.770> maximally<00:01:52.250> loading<00:01:52.580> at<00:01:52.670> that

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
feeling you're maximally loading at that

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.700 
feeling you're maximally loading at that
peak<00:01:53.120> contraction<00:01:53.540> is<00:01:53.840> approaching<00:01:54.290> maximum

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 
peak contraction is approaching maximum

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.820 
peak contraction is approaching maximum
loading<00:01:54.890> at<00:01:55.160> the<00:01:56.030> 90-degree<00:01:56.690> point<00:01:56.990> such<00:01:57.800> as

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:57.830 
loading at the 90-degree point such as

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:59.530 
loading at the 90-degree point such as
when<00:01:58.100> you<00:01:58.160> do<00:01:58.280> a<00:01:58.310> dumbbell<00:01:58.580> Pro<00:01:58.910> same<00:01:59.240> thing<00:01:59.420> it

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540 
when you do a dumbbell Pro same thing it

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.840 
when you do a dumbbell Pro same thing it
happened<00:01:59.840> with<00:01:59.930> a<00:01:59.960> triceps<00:02:00.380> extension<00:02:00.860> take<00:02:01.820> a

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
happened with a triceps extension take a

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.420 
happened with a triceps extension take a
reverse<00:02:02.180> grip<00:02:02.360> pull<00:02:03.350> off<00:02:03.500> to<00:02:03.650> the<00:02:03.680> side<00:02:03.770> and

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:04.430 
reverse grip pull off to the side and

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:05.469 
reverse grip pull off to the side and
this<00:02:04.580> one<00:02:04.760> is<00:02:04.880> actually<00:02:04.970> kind<00:02:05.180> of<00:02:05.270> cool<00:02:05.390> cause

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
this one is actually kind of cool cause

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:07.150 
this one is actually kind of cool cause
I'm<00:02:05.570> going<00:02:05.690> to<00:02:05.750> push<00:02:05.960> it<00:02:06.140> into<00:02:06.500> my<00:02:06.620> thighs<00:02:06.890> at

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:07.160 
I'm going to push it into my thighs at

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.219 
I'm going to push it into my thighs at
the<00:02:07.280> end<00:02:07.460> notice<00:02:08.149> there's<00:02:08.509> a<00:02:08.600> 90<00:02:08.929> degree<00:02:09.200> angle

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 
the end notice there's a 90 degree angle

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.100 
the end notice there's a 90 degree angle
now<00:02:09.590> between<00:02:09.950> my<00:02:10.759> forearm<00:02:11.240> and<00:02:11.450> the<00:02:11.690> cable<00:02:12.020> or

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:12.110 
now between my forearm and the cable or

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.680 
now between my forearm and the cable or
roughly<00:02:12.470> 90<00:02:12.740> degrees<00:02:13.070> here<00:02:13.820> is<00:02:14.000> zero<00:02:14.270> so<00:02:14.570> this

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
roughly 90 degrees here is zero so this

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.530 
roughly 90 degrees here is zero so this
is<00:02:14.750> no<00:02:15.110> tension<00:02:15.530> on<00:02:15.590> my<00:02:15.620> triceps<00:02:16.209> but<00:02:17.209> here<00:02:17.450> is

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540 
is no tension on my triceps but here is

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.050 
is no tension on my triceps but here is
maximal<00:02:18.170> tension<00:02:18.200> on<00:02:18.530> my<00:02:18.560> triceps<00:02:19.100> or<00:02:19.700> if<00:02:19.850> I

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
maximal tension on my triceps or if I

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.110 
maximal tension on my triceps or if I
had<00:02:20.239> the<00:02:20.360> rope<00:02:20.570> up<00:02:20.750> tall<00:02:21.530> and<00:02:21.890> I<00:02:22.640> was<00:02:22.670> pulling

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
had the rope up tall and I was pulling

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.240 
had the rope up tall and I was pulling
it<00:02:23.209> or<00:02:23.300> the<00:02:23.420> cable<00:02:23.840> up<00:02:23.930> tall<00:02:24.220> maximal<00:02:25.220> tension

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
it or the cable up tall maximal tension

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.040 
it or the cable up tall maximal tension
would<00:02:25.700> be<00:02:25.760> with<00:02:26.000> my<00:02:26.150> elbow<00:02:26.450> is<00:02:26.600> at<00:02:26.720> 9<00:02:26.900> degrees

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
would be with my elbow is at 9 degrees

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.010 
would be with my elbow is at 9 degrees
so<00:02:27.920> now<00:02:28.040> I'm<00:02:28.160> getting<00:02:28.280> full<00:02:28.640> the<00:02:29.209> hardest<00:02:29.840> part

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
so now I'm getting full the hardest part

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:31.510 
so now I'm getting full the hardest part
of<00:02:30.080> the<00:02:30.140> exercise<00:02:30.320> is<00:02:31.010> where<00:02:31.220> I'm<00:02:31.310> going<00:02:31.430> on

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
of the exercise is where I'm going on

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.010 
of the exercise is where I'm going on
full<00:02:31.670> contraction<00:02:32.209> so<00:02:32.330> again<00:02:32.540> that's<00:02:32.660> kind<00:02:32.780> of

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
full contraction so again that's kind of

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:34.780 
full contraction so again that's kind of
that<00:02:33.080> the<00:02:33.620> highest<00:02:33.950> part<00:02:34.190> of<00:02:34.250> your<00:02:34.370> triceps

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
that the highest part of your triceps

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.760 
that the highest part of your triceps
there<00:02:35.739> so<00:02:36.739> you<00:02:37.340> want<00:02:37.520> to<00:02:37.580> get<00:02:37.700> a<00:02:37.730> more<00:02:38.090> complete

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
there so you want to get a more complete

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:41.110 
there so you want to get a more complete
arm<00:02:39.770> workout<00:02:40.400> you<00:02:40.550> want<00:02:40.610> to<00:02:40.730> change<00:02:40.940> the

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
arm workout you want to change the

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.430 
arm workout you want to change the
angles<00:02:41.450> a<00:02:41.510> little<00:02:41.690> bit<00:02:41.810> this<00:02:41.959> is<00:02:42.020> a<00:02:42.140> great<00:02:42.320> way

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:42.440 
angles a little bit this is a great way

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.680 
angles a little bit this is a great way
to<00:02:42.470> do<00:02:42.709> it<00:02:42.830> so<00:02:43.520> quick<00:02:43.760> review<00:02:44.120> is<00:02:44.390> a<00:02:44.450> nice

to do it so quick review is a nice

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.259 
to do it so quick review is a nice
little<00:02:44.870> superset<00:02:45.380> I<00:02:45.650> can<00:02:46.459> go<00:02:46.610> triceps<00:02:47.060> first
