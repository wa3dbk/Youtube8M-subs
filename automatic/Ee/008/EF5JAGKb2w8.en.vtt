00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:10.120 
today we're going to take a quick look

today we're going to take a quick look
at<00:00:10.389> song<00:00:10.719> settings<00:00:11.230> and<00:00:11.440> patterns<00:00:12.330> song

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:15.309 
settings can be adjusted when you create

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:17.820 
settings can be adjusted when you create
a<00:00:15.340> new<00:00:15.460> song<00:00:15.910> where<00:00:16.630> they<00:00:16.810> can<00:00:17.020> be<00:00:17.140> modified<00:00:17.500> at

a new song where they can be modified at
any<00:00:17.980> point<00:00:18.279> from<00:00:18.550> the<00:00:18.700> settings<00:00:19.000> palette<00:00:19.529> as

any point from the settings palette as

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:23.220 
any point from the settings palette as
the<00:00:20.770> name<00:00:20.949> would<00:00:20.980> imply<00:00:21.779> song<00:00:22.779> settings

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:23.230 
the name would imply song settings

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:25.349 
the name would imply song settings
affect<00:00:23.560> the<00:00:23.710> entire<00:00:24.010> song<00:00:24.400> thus<00:00:24.910> they<00:00:25.090> affect

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:28.539 
all the instruments tempo is probably

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:30.179 
all the instruments tempo is probably
the<00:00:28.660> most<00:00:28.810> obvious<00:00:29.080> song<00:00:29.529> setting<00:00:29.980> and

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:30.189 
the most obvious song setting and

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:32.220 
the most obvious song setting and
determines<00:00:31.090> the<00:00:31.269> length<00:00:31.449> of<00:00:31.660> a<00:00:31.900> quarter<00:00:32.199> note

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:32.230 
determines the length of a quarter note

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.759 
determines the length of a quarter note
with<00:00:32.830> one<00:00:33.070> beat<00:00:33.960> tempo<00:00:34.960> can<00:00:35.140> be<00:00:35.260> set<00:00:35.470> directly

00:00:35.759 --> 00:00:35.769 
with one beat tempo can be set directly

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:38.130 
with one beat tempo can be set directly
with<00:00:36.159> the<00:00:36.250> slider<00:00:36.610> and<00:00:37.059> beats<00:00:37.330> per<00:00:37.600> minute<00:00:37.930> or

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:38.140 
with the slider and beats per minute or

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.619 
with the slider and beats per minute or
it<00:00:38.860> can<00:00:38.949> be<00:00:38.979> set<00:00:39.309> with<00:00:39.550> the<00:00:39.699> tap<00:00:39.879> tempo<00:00:40.210> button

00:00:40.619 --> 00:00:40.629 
it can be set with the tap tempo button

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:43.079 
it can be set with the tap tempo button
so<00:00:41.350> you<00:00:41.440> can<00:00:41.650> match<00:00:41.860> the<00:00:42.129> tempo<00:00:42.430> interactively

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:43.089 
so you can match the tempo interactively

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:45.570 
so you can match the tempo interactively
with<00:00:43.360> another<00:00:43.809> song<00:00:44.140> such<00:00:44.949> as<00:00:45.100> something<00:00:45.460> in

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:45.580 
with another song such as something in

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.060 
with another song such as something in
your<00:00:45.670> ipod<00:00:46.030> music<00:00:46.210> library<00:00:46.870> or<00:00:47.470> with<00:00:47.769> a<00:00:47.799> live

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.070

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:51.489 
performance tempo is also the only song

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:53.130 
performance tempo is also the only song
setting<00:00:51.940> that<00:00:52.059> affects<00:00:52.390> the<00:00:52.510> sound<00:00:52.870> of<00:00:53.110> your

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:53.140 
setting that affects the sound of your

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:55.680 
setting that affects the sound of your
pattern<00:00:53.530> music<00:00:53.860> song<00:00:54.100> it<00:00:54.909> quite<00:00:55.269> obviously

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:55.690 
pattern music song it quite obviously

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.229 
pattern music song it quite obviously
speeds<00:00:56.080> things<00:00:56.320> up<00:00:56.530> or<00:00:56.860> slows<00:00:57.129> them<00:00:57.369> down<00:00:57.400> it's

00:00:58.229 --> 00:00:58.239 
speeds things up or slows them down it's

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:02.830 
speeds things up or slows them down it's
pretty<00:00:58.510> straightforward

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.530 

next<00:01:03.840> we'll<00:01:04.019> look<00:01:04.170> at<00:01:04.320> time<00:01:04.559> signature<00:01:05.540> time

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
next we'll look at time signature time

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.050 
next we'll look at time signature time
signature<00:01:07.110> is<00:01:07.380> a<00:01:07.770> music<00:01:08.340> structural<00:01:08.850> guide

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
signature is a music structural guide

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.210 
signature is a music structural guide
and<00:01:09.390> simply<00:01:10.140> refers<00:01:10.500> to<00:01:10.800> the<00:01:10.890> number<00:01:10.920> of

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
and simply refers to the number of

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.960 
and simply refers to the number of
quarter<00:01:11.670> notes<00:01:11.910> per<00:01:12.270> bar<00:01:13.280> the<00:01:14.280> default<00:01:14.490> time

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
quarter notes per bar the default time

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.080 
quarter notes per bar the default time
signature<00:01:15.510> is<00:01:16.020> 44<00:01:16.800> often<00:01:17.520> referred<00:01:17.550> to<00:01:17.909> as

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
signature is 44 often referred to as

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.780 
signature is 44 often referred to as
common<00:01:18.630> time<00:01:18.840> so<00:01:19.710> that's<00:01:19.890> four<00:01:20.250> quarter<00:01:20.760> notes

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
common time so that's four quarter notes

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.280 
common time so that's four quarter notes
per<00:01:21.300> bar

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290 
per bar

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.430 
per bar
that's<00:01:23.920> reflected<00:01:24.520> in<00:01:24.520> pattern<00:01:25.000> music<00:01:25.420> in<00:01:26.260> the

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
note that changing the time signature

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.719 
note that changing the time signature
does<00:01:46.229> not<00:01:46.409> change<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:47.100> duration<00:01:47.369> of

from four four two three four so you

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.070 
from four four two three four so you
need<00:01:59.340> to<00:01:59.460> go<00:01:59.610> in<00:01:59.790> and<00:02:00.030> do<00:02:00.210> that<00:02:00.360> yourself<00:02:00.810> if

need to go in and do that yourself if

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.830 
need to go in and do that yourself if

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.359 
but the instrument pattern length
setting<00:02:05.810> will<00:02:06.140> help<00:02:06.320> you<00:02:06.439> align<00:02:06.740> the<00:02:07.039> pattern

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369

length to an integral number of bars so

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.050 
length to an integral number of bars so
we've<00:02:10.280> tried<00:02:10.519> to<00:02:10.550> make<00:02:10.670> it<00:02:10.849> easy

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
we've tried to make it easy

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.600 
we've tried to make it easy
the<00:02:12.930> last<00:02:13.140> song<00:02:13.440> setting<00:02:13.950> we're<00:02:14.280> going<00:02:14.459> to

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
the last song setting we're going to

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.770 
the last song setting we're going to
look<00:02:14.790> at<00:02:14.970> is<00:02:15.510> the<00:02:15.810> scale<00:02:17.180> scales<00:02:18.180> and<00:02:18.480> pattern

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
look at is the scale scales and pattern

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.530 
look at is the scale scales and pattern
music<00:02:19.110> are<00:02:19.290> very<00:02:19.680> powerful<00:02:20.250> tool<00:02:20.489> that<00:02:21.330> we

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
music are very powerful tool that we
