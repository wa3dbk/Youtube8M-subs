00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:08.710
 with patience to participate in a 

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:11.320
 constellation of polemic and easy edged 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:14.290
 science society tempt you to analyze and 

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:16.720
 make explicit the methodological principles 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:19.929
 the presuppositions and the concepts 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.429
 fundamentals that enable e that are 

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:24.269
 condition of possibility of these 

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:26.890
 controversial and at the same time limit them 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:28.569
 then from them we can 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.539
 also define what would interest us 

00:00:28.569 --> 00:00:33.789
 what would be the philosophy of biology 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.410
 logical nuisance philosophy of 

00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:37.690
 participate in a constellation of 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:40.300
 polemics about or that I want to be alive 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:43.120
 about how it is constituted on how that 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:46.649
 volume then in philosophy the 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.489
 biology and study the presuppositions 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.809
 methodological the principles 

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:53.199
 fundamental those tips 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:54.969
 fundamentals that again being 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:58.300
 condition of possibility of 

00:00:54.969 --> 00:01:00.159
 controversial biologists sustain and 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:03.040
 serve as a frame of reason, however, 

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:05.740
 reference and also 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.570
 this one was in the df where he also 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.420
 They make a historical perspective - 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:14.800
 we can see how these concepts and the 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:18.450
 fundamental principles of evolutions 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:22.259
 they were also in those subjects to move 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.909
 we have an inspirational presence 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.820
 amount of always not our work 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.920
 we would see something that is approaching 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.829
 always the transcendental people are not 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.259
 doubt 800 of the world more studies the 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.899
 condition of possibility of being of these 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.399
 800 plus people know that those 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:42.289
 conditions of possibilities also 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:42.289
 are submitted are my congratulations 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.360
 forcing the transcendental by feeding 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.959
 permanently they had all the people 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.360
 really to capture those those 

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:55.520
 removals 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.020
 settle the presented that has 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.630
 philosophy of biology based on some 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:02.480
 examples we can find two 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:05.510
 biologists discussing for example if a 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:08.840
 ballot belongs or not to a certain 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:10.399
 news species the biology that we're going 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.080
 to ask us but his own 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:15.440
 concept of species 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.630
 we can find two biologists 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.420
 arguing about whether a structure in 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.430
 an adaptive structure we are not going to 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.810
 ask about the very nature of 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:28.650
 adaptation concept 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:31.709
 but biologists 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:34.230
 or better two psychiatrists can discuss 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:36.930
 about the normal or pathological character in 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.790
 a behavior the philosophers of the 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.430
 science in the case of biology we 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.680
 let's ask if the legitimate after 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.780
 by comparing normal four out of five for 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:48.239
 win is not from physiological processes 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:54.120
 more to falar 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:54.120
 behaviors are not in itself
