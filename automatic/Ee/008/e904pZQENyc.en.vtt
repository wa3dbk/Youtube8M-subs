00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.480
 Y 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.930
 rag doll 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:28.669
 a young couple buy a big house one 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.590
 old country house a certain day 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:34.440
 they found something in the attic thrown in 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:38.040
 a corner full of cobwebs next to 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:40.559
 other old junk was a doll from 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:44.129
 very old cloth and look a bit 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:46.300
 I had strange red hair and 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.879
 the black eyes 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:51.820
 It was broken and dirty but with 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:53.829
 some care was precious the 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:57.310
 ideal toy for the queen of the house 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:01:00.340
 the only daughter of that marriage 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:04.030
 when they gave it to her the girl opened a lot 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:07.440
 the eyes smiled cry of happiness and he 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.440
 put to play with the doll 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:22.270
 after a few days they started to happen 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:25.720
 strange things one day the room of 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:28.750
 the girl woke up perfectly collected 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:31.180
 when it was usual that they were 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.800
 all the toys messed up by the 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:36.510
 quarter 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:39.490
 another day three dead spiders came in 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:41.200
 crushed on the ground very close to the 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.870
 girl's bed 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:46.360
 on another occasion they appeared headless 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:49.360
 all the dolls except the redhead 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.020
 with black eyes no matter how much you 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.679
 they will ask 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:58.869
 he did not say anything so they decided 

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:58.869
 take their daughter to sleep with them 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.850
 since that day nothing strange happened 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.940
 in the girl's room during 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:16.790
 several weeks but still the parents 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:19.700
 they took her to the pediatrician who did not notice anything 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:22.010
 weird in your little one considering that 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.890
 the parents decided that their daughter 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:27.230
 go back to sleep in your room but 

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:29.450
 one morning the mother when fixing the 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.930
 room noticed that the doll 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:35.870
 I had my shoes stained with mud 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:38.510
 that night it had rained while examining 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:42.860
 the most closely he let out a cry of terror 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:45.830
 and there was no doubt the doll had 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:47.870
 grown up scared hair 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:52.209
 the father buried the doll in a 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.209
 deep hole away from the big house 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:03.530
 then the girl did not smile again 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:06.860
 he asked a lot about his wrist and cried 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:09.110
 I often did not eat anything I had 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.520
 nightmares and always walked half 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.490
 sick 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:16.160
 the pediatrician recommended that they buy 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:19.130
 a doll as close to the previous one 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:21.470
 but the girl as soon as they gave her the 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:24.860
 new doll tossed to the hair 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:28.670
 tried to break it violently threw 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:31.240
 floor and kicked parents 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:34.030
 they went to all kinds of specialists 

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:36.440
 but seeing that nothing worked 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.170
 they interned the daughter in a small 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.270
 private clinic 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.280
 the father went to the place where he had 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:46.030
 buried to the wrist 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:48.640
 as he approached he was terrified 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:51.040
 see that through the earth showed 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.560
 a hand of the wrist when the 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.959
 unearthing observed that the hair had 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:04:00.069
 grown much more and that those eyes 

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:04.200
 very black faced him with hatred when he arrived 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:04.200
 home threw the doll to the fireplace 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:12.700
 he sat down to wait for his wife 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:25.380
 shortly after the phone rang 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:28.420
 they told me that there had been a 

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:32.100
 terrible event in the clinic 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:35.390
 and that all who were there had 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:39.230
 disappeared without a trace 

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:43.990
 and that the only thing that was found was a 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:43.990
 rag doll lying in a corner
