bonus chest is and as you can see it's
kind<00:01:00.930> of<00:01:00.960> like<00:01:01.079> a<00:01:01.140> survival<00:01:01.620> island<00:01:01.770> there's

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
kind of like a survival island there's

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.670 
kind of like a survival island there's
only<00:01:02.640> two<00:01:02.879> trees<00:01:03.210> some<00:01:03.719> sand<00:01:04.049> of<00:01:04.229> course<00:01:04.439> and

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:11.630 
dungeon and the coordinates of this is
286<00:02:06.530> x<00:02:07.530> and<00:02:07.890> then<00:02:08.220> 16<00:02:08.789> y<00:02:09.060> and<00:02:09.390> negative<00:02:09.989> 2<00:02:10.800> 68<00:02:11.340> or

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
286 x and then 16 y and negative 2 68 or

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.720 
286 x and then 16 y and negative 2 68 or
so<00:02:11.819> on<00:02:12.060> z

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
so on z

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.910 
so on z
oh<00:02:12.790> and<00:02:13.510> let's<00:02:14.019> see<00:02:14.140> what's<00:02:14.319> in<00:02:14.470> the<00:02:14.590> chest

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
oh and let's see what's in the chest

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.820 
oh and let's see what's in the chest
well<00:02:15.730> looks<00:02:16.030> like<00:02:16.090> we<00:02:16.330> got<00:02:16.480> some<00:02:16.510> iron<00:02:16.870> some

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
well looks like we got some iron some

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:21.750 
well looks like we got some iron some
cocoa<00:02:18.129> beans<00:02:18.430> some<00:02:18.970> saddle<00:02:19.450> and<00:02:20.250> just<00:02:21.250> stuff

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
cocoa beans some saddle and just stuff

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.180 
cocoa beans some saddle and just stuff
like<00:02:21.790> that<00:02:21.909> I<00:02:22.299> guess<00:02:22.750> this<00:02:22.930> is<00:02:23.099> kind<00:02:24.099> of

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:24.190 
like that I guess this is kind of

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:25.680 
like that I guess this is kind of
suitable<00:02:24.489> for<00:02:24.730> a<00:02:24.760> survival<00:02:25.209> island<00:02:25.330> thing

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
suitable for a survival island thing

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.699 
suitable for a survival island thing
some<00:02:26.349> gold<00:02:26.620> over<00:02:26.890> here<00:02:27.599> slava<00:02:28.599> obsidian<00:02:29.319> so

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
some gold over here slava obsidian so

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:31.949 
some gold over here slava obsidian so
this<00:02:30.519> could<00:02:30.760> be<00:02:30.819> a<00:02:30.970> perfect<00:02:31.180> survival<00:02:31.660> island

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:31.959 
this could be a perfect survival island

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:35.369 
this could be a perfect survival island
a<00:02:32.349> seed<00:02:33.280> if<00:02:33.580> someone<00:02:34.480> wanted<00:02:34.720> to<00:02:34.780> use<00:02:34.989> it<00:02:35.019> just

00:02:35.369 --> 00:02:35.379 
a seed if someone wanted to use it just

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:37.199 
a seed if someone wanted to use it just
because<00:02:35.739> I<00:02:36.010> kinda<00:02:36.310> have<00:02:36.400> to<00:02:36.430> survive<00:02:36.760> a<00:02:36.819> clear

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
because I kinda have to survive a clear

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.380 
because I kinda have to survive a clear
and<00:02:37.420> then<00:02:38.019> well<00:02:38.410> you<00:02:39.280> can<00:02:39.430> craft<00:02:39.849> the<00:02:40.000> boat<00:02:40.180> oh

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
and then well you can craft the boat oh

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.610 
and then well you can craft the boat oh
and<00:02:40.780> I<00:02:41.590> guess<00:02:42.629> swim<00:02:43.629> your<00:02:43.870> way<00:02:43.900> all<00:02:44.349> day<00:02:44.560> to

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
and I guess swim your way all day to

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.259 
and I guess swim your way all day to
this<00:02:44.799> mushroom<00:02:45.160> biome<00:02:45.370> and<00:02:45.670> if<00:02:45.940> you're<00:02:46.090> lucky

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
this mushroom biome and if you're lucky

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:48.420 
this mushroom biome and if you're lucky
you<00:02:46.510> can<00:02:46.569> find<00:02:46.900> this<00:02:47.110> defeat<00:02:47.769> the<00:02:47.950> done<00:02:48.129> you

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
you can find this defeat the done you

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.759 
you can find this defeat the done you
know<00:02:48.549> the<00:02:48.670> mobs<00:02:48.940> and<00:02:49.299> you'll<00:02:49.780> find<00:02:49.959> this<00:02:50.230> also

00:02:50.759 --> 00:02:50.769 
know the mobs and you'll find this also

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:53.490 
know the mobs and you'll find this also
up<00:02:51.160> sitting<00:02:51.540> down<00:02:52.540> over<00:02:52.780> here<00:02:53.019> so<00:02:53.200> you<00:02:53.260> can<00:02:53.410> go

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
up sitting down over here so you can go

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.289 
up sitting down over here so you can go
to<00:02:53.560> the<00:02:53.739> nether<00:02:53.950> and<00:02:54.190> do<00:02:54.340> some<00:02:54.549> challenges<00:02:55.150> if

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:55.299 
to the nether and do some challenges if

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:57.330 
to the nether and do some challenges if
you<00:02:55.780> kind<00:02:55.989> of<00:02:56.079> made<00:02:56.230> challenges<00:02:56.650> for<00:02:57.040> yourself

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
you kind of made challenges for yourself

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.430 
you kind of made challenges for yourself
but<00:02:58.150> I<00:02:58.180> guess<00:02:58.450> that's<00:02:58.480> about<00:02:58.750> it<00:02:58.870> what<00:02:59.019> is<00:02:59.260> see

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
but I guess that's about it what is see

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.650 
but I guess that's about it what is see
it's<00:02:59.680> not<00:02:59.769> very<00:02:59.920> no<00:03:00.519> really<00:03:00.940> complex<00:03:01.390> it's

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
it's not very no really complex it's

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:05.130 
it's not very no really complex it's
just<00:03:01.840> simple<00:03:02.829> and<00:03:03.010> to<00:03:03.160> the<00:03:03.190> point<00:03:03.310> and<00:03:03.870> I<00:03:04.870> guess

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:05.140 
just simple and to the point and I guess

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:06.660 
just simple and to the point and I guess
that's<00:03:05.319> about<00:03:05.440> it<00:03:05.560> for<00:03:05.739> this<00:03:05.980> seed<00:03:06.250> spotlight

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
that's about it for this seed spotlight

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.030 
that's about it for this seed spotlight
