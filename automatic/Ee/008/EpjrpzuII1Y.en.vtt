00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
close and I don't know if there's any

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.540 
close and I don't know if there's any
sort<00:00:20.760> of<00:00:20.910> major<00:00:21.920> noticeable<00:00:22.920> difference<00:00:23.369> but

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
sort of major noticeable difference but

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.220 
sort of major noticeable difference but
what<00:00:23.730> I<00:00:23.760> will<00:00:23.880> tell<00:00:24.240> you<00:00:24.390> is<00:00:24.449> my<00:00:24.630> skin<00:00:24.930> feels

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
what I will tell you is my skin feels

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.929 
what I will tell you is my skin feels
really<00:00:25.800> soft<00:00:26.490> and<00:00:26.849> smooth<00:00:27.810> like<00:00:28.349> it's<00:00:28.590> been

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:28.939 
really soft and smooth like it's been

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:33.229 
really soft and smooth like it's been
really<00:00:29.939> well<00:00:30.179> moisturized<00:00:31.969> still<00:00:32.969> got<00:00:33.120> that

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
really well moisturized still got that

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.389 
really well moisturized still got that
lovely<00:00:33.600> smell<00:00:33.989> lingering<00:00:34.829> which<00:00:34.980> is<00:00:35.130> lovely

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
lovely smell lingering which is lovely

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:41.119 
lovely smell lingering which is lovely
and<00:00:37.940> yeah<00:00:38.940> I<00:00:38.969> think<00:00:39.410> my<00:00:40.410> skin<00:00:40.649> looks<00:00:40.890> probably

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
and yeah I think my skin looks probably

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.000 
and yeah I think my skin looks probably
brighter<00:00:41.550> more<00:00:42.030> radiant<00:00:42.090> I<00:00:42.930> guess<00:00:43.770> it's

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
brighter more radiant I guess it's

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.410 
brighter more radiant I guess it's
something<00:00:44.219> that<00:00:44.460> you'd<00:00:44.579> have<00:00:44.789> to<00:00:44.940> keep<00:00:45.180> on

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
something that you'd have to keep on

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.040 
something that you'd have to keep on
doing<00:00:46.670> over<00:00:47.670> time<00:00:47.910> and<00:00:48.149> see<00:00:48.390> how<00:00:48.420> it<00:00:48.690> goes<00:00:48.840> I'm

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
doing over time and see how it goes I'm

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.630 
doing over time and see how it goes I'm
going<00:00:49.170> to<00:00:49.230> keep<00:00:49.469> doing<00:00:49.770> it<00:00:49.920> perhaps<00:00:50.280> twice<00:00:50.579> a

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
going to keep doing it perhaps twice a

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.139 
going to keep doing it perhaps twice a
week<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:51.829> and<00:00:52.829> see<00:00:53.039> what<00:00:53.190> I<00:00:53.219> think<00:00:53.610> so<00:00:53.820> I'll<00:00:53.969> do

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
week and and see what I think so I'll do

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.650 
week and and see what I think so I'll do
an<00:00:54.300> update<00:00:54.719> on<00:00:55.460> long-term<00:00:56.460> results<00:00:57.360> but<00:00:57.539> this

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
an update on long-term results but this

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.130 
an update on long-term results but this
is<00:00:57.809> obviously<00:00:58.250> my<00:00:59.250> face<00:00:59.550> after<00:01:00.510> losing<00:01:00.809> it<00:01:00.930> now

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
is obviously my face after losing it now

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:06.620 
is obviously my face after losing it now
I<00:01:01.440> will<00:01:01.829> show<00:01:01.949> you<00:01:02.010> my<00:01:02.129> hands<00:01:04.790> that's<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:06.360> left

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
I will show you my hands that's the left

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.960 
I will show you my hands that's the left
hand<00:01:06.930> I<00:01:07.140> did<00:01:07.320> the<00:01:07.439> mask<00:01:07.680> on<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.640> I'm<00:01:08.820> obviously

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
hand I did the mask on and I'm obviously

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.700 
hand I did the mask on and I'm obviously
taking<00:01:09.570> it<00:01:09.659> off<00:01:09.750> as<00:01:09.930> well<00:01:10.080> I'm<00:01:10.290> just<00:01:10.470> going<00:01:10.650> to

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
taking it off as well I'm just going to

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:21.620 
taking it off as well I'm just going to
close<00:01:11.549> in<00:01:12.180> on<00:01:12.299> that<00:01:13.369> to<00:01:14.369> say<00:01:15.890> again<00:01:19.460> to<00:01:20.460> me<00:01:20.700> this

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
close in on that to say again to me this

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.190 
close in on that to say again to me this
hand<00:01:21.960> doesn't<00:01:22.380> look<00:01:22.470> better<00:01:22.680> I<00:01:23.280> think<00:01:24.200> the

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
hand doesn't look better I think the

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.130 
hand doesn't look better I think the
lines<00:01:25.950> are<00:01:26.159> perhaps<00:01:26.430> ever<00:01:26.700> so<00:01:26.939> slightly<00:01:27.210> less

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
lines are perhaps ever so slightly less

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.109 
lines are perhaps ever so slightly less
obvious<00:01:30.079> definitely<00:01:31.079> feels<00:01:31.500> more<00:01:31.979> smooth<00:01:32.850> and

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
obvious definitely feels more smooth and

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.020 
obvious definitely feels more smooth and
more<00:01:33.240> moisturized<00:01:33.930> so<00:01:34.799> overall<00:01:35.549> I'm<00:01:35.790> pretty

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
more moisturized so overall I'm pretty

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.609 
more moisturized so overall I'm pretty
happy<00:01:36.329> with<00:01:36.509> that<00:01:36.570> I<00:01:36.930> like<00:01:37.140> it<00:01:37.409> and<00:01:37.530> I'm

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
happy with that I like it and I'm

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.140 
happy with that I like it and I'm
looking<00:01:37.770> forward<00:01:38.070> to<00:01:38.159> keep<00:01:38.369> trying<00:01:38.729> it<00:01:38.970> and

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150
