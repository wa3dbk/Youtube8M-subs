we've<00:00:22.560> moved<00:00:22.680> on<00:00:22.859> to<00:00:22.890> mark<00:00:23.189> rods<00:00:23.430> now<00:00:23.580> we've

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
we've moved on to mark rods now we've

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.580 
we've moved on to mark rods now we've
done<00:00:23.939> this<00:00:24.090> in<00:00:24.210> its<00:00:24.330> own<00:00:24.539> individual<00:00:25.140> section

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
done this in its own individual section

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.230 
done this in its own individual section
because<00:00:25.830> there's<00:00:25.980> four<00:00:26.250> in<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.609> range<00:00:26.849> now

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
because there's four in the range now

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.480 
because there's four in the range now
the<00:00:27.960> first<00:00:28.140> thing<00:00:28.349> that<00:00:28.380> I<00:00:28.529> can<00:00:28.710> occur<00:00:29.099> mention

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
the first thing that I can occur mention

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.479 
the first thing that I can occur mention
is<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:30.119> 3k<00:00:30.539> we've<00:00:30.810> this<00:00:31.560> will<00:00:31.769> match<00:00:31.980> any<00:00:32.340> of

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
is the 3k we've this will match any of

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.360 
is the 3k we've this will match any of
the<00:00:32.700> actual<00:00:32.850> fishing<00:00:33.360> rods<00:00:33.540> in<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.719> range<00:00:33.930> so

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:34.370 
the actual fishing rods in the range so

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.370 
the actual fishing rods in the range so
suppressors<00:00:35.370> or<00:00:35.670> velocities<00:00:36.660> or<00:00:36.840> excess<00:00:37.140> ones

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
suppressors or velocities or excess ones

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:39.110 
suppressors or velocities or excess ones
that<00:00:37.590> will<00:00:37.800> match<00:00:37.980> up<00:00:38.010> if<00:00:38.370> that's<00:00:38.520> if<00:00:38.940> that's

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
that will match up if that's if that's

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.310 
that will match up if that's if that's
what<00:00:39.329> you<00:00:39.450> want<00:00:39.600> to<00:00:39.660> do<00:00:39.750> with<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:39.989> range<00:00:40.170> if

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
what you want to do with the range if

and a quarter in twelve foot six the
first<00:00:56.399> thing<00:00:56.610> I'll<00:00:56.730> say<00:00:56.760> about<00:00:56.940> only<00:00:57.300> mark

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
first thing I'll say about only mark

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.760 
first thing I'll say about only mark
around<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.020> certainly<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.350> ones<00:00:58.500> in<00:00:58.649> our

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
around and certainly the ones in our

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.680 
around and certainly the ones in our
range<00:00:59.010> are<00:00:59.280> they<00:00:59.489> all<00:00:59.670> come<00:01:00.149> with<00:01:00.180> 50<00:01:00.660> ml

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
range are they all come with 50 ml

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.590 
range are they all come with 50 ml
borings<00:01:01.260> is<00:01:01.379> standard<00:01:01.800> I<00:01:02.640> think<00:01:03.149> most<00:01:03.420> people

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
borings is standard I think most people

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.539 
borings is standard I think most people
are<00:01:03.989> or<00:01:04.500> if<00:01:04.739> they're<00:01:04.890> not<00:01:05.040> they<00:01:05.250> should<00:01:05.280> be

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
are or if they're not they should be

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.700 
are or if they're not they should be
using<00:01:06.060> some<00:01:06.240> form<00:01:06.450> of<00:01:06.600> braid<00:01:06.869> to<00:01:07.320> find<00:01:07.560> the

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
using some form of braid to find the

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.800 
using some form of braid to find the
features<00:01:07.890> on<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.250> lakebed<00:01:08.430> no<00:01:09.210> stretch<00:01:09.570> so

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
features on the lakebed no stretch so

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:10.880 
features on the lakebed no stretch so
obviously<00:01:10.110> you're<00:01:10.320> gonna<00:01:10.439> get<00:01:10.619> a<00:01:10.680> lot<00:01:10.830> more

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
obviously you're gonna get a lot more

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.980 
obviously you're gonna get a lot more
feel<00:01:11.310> for<00:01:11.520> what's<00:01:11.670> down<00:01:11.880> there<00:01:12.119> so<00:01:12.390> 50<00:01:12.840> ml

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
feel for what's down there so 50 ml

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
point about these is the tip is nearly 5

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.760 
point about these is the tip is nearly 5
millimeters<00:01:31.439> thick<00:01:31.710> and<00:01:32.570> by<00:01:33.570> doing<00:01:33.960> that<00:01:34.140> the

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
millimeters thick and by doing that the

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.710 
millimeters thick and by doing that the
actual<00:01:35.070> feel<00:01:35.430> through<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.360> through<00:01:36.689> the

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
actual feel through the through the

actual feel through the through the
actual<00:01:36.900> rod<00:01:37.290> even<00:01:37.890> though<00:01:37.950> these<00:01:38.070> are<00:01:38.310> based

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
actual rod even though these are based

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.219 
actual rod even though these are based
on<00:01:38.759> a<00:01:38.790> three-pound<00:01:39.270> task<00:01:39.540> if<00:01:39.689> don't<00:01:39.930> think

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
on a three-pound task if don't think

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.990 
on a three-pound task if don't think
it's<00:01:40.680> just<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:40.979> three-pound<00:01:41.430> rod<00:01:41.640> that<00:01:41.880> we've

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
it's just a three-pound rod that we've

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.300 
it's just a three-pound rod that we've
called<00:01:42.270> a<00:01:42.479> three<00:01:42.780> pound<00:01:43.049> marker<00:01:43.439> rod<00:01:43.590> it's

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
called a three pound marker rod it's

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.310 
called a three pound marker rod it's
it's<00:01:44.579> not<00:01:44.790> based<00:01:45.090> on<00:01:45.299> a<00:01:45.360> three<00:01:45.600> pound<00:01:45.840> Tasker

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
it's not based on a three pound Tasker

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.770 
it's not based on a three pound Tasker
if<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.619> tip<00:01:46.890> is<00:01:47.189> 5<00:01:47.970> mil<00:01:48.210> thick<00:01:48.420> like<00:01:48.630> I've<00:01:48.750> just

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
if the tip is 5 mil thick like I've just

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.230 
if the tip is 5 mil thick like I've just
mentioned<00:01:49.350> but<00:01:50.250> what<00:01:50.460> will<00:01:50.850> do<00:01:51.000> it<00:01:51.149> will

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
mentioned but what will do it will

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.389 
mentioned but what will do it will
transfer<00:01:51.720> them<00:01:51.840> all<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.170> feel<00:01:52.380> straight<00:01:53.130> down

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
transfer them all the feel straight down

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.670 
transfer them all the feel straight down
into<00:01:53.640> your<00:01:53.820> hands<00:01:53.970> so<00:01:54.149> any<00:01:54.659> pebble<00:01:55.320> will<00:01:55.470> feel

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
into your hands so any pebble will feel

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.069 
into your hands so any pebble will feel
like<00:01:56.009> an<00:01:56.310> absolute<00:01:56.520> rockery<00:01:57.119> you<00:01:57.540> know<00:01:57.689> so<00:01:57.960> it

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
like an absolute rockery you know so it

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.810
