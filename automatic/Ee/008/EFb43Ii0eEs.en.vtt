you see that the model is fixed to the
bottom<00:01:17.460> not<00:01:17.700> only<00:01:17.880> by<00:01:18.000> screws<00:01:18.330> but<00:01:18.570> also<00:01:18.689> by

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
bottom not only by screws but also by

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.770 
bottom not only by screws but also by
one<00:01:19.140> of<00:01:19.229> those<00:01:19.380> ties<00:01:19.650> you<00:01:19.830> have<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.070> remove<00:01:20.280> and

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
one of those ties you have to remove and

one of those ties you have to remove and
to<00:01:21.780> free<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.229> model<00:01:22.470> from<00:01:22.560> the<00:01:22.650> base<00:01:22.890> it's

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
to free the model from the base it's

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.700 
to free the model from the base it's
just<00:01:23.729> a<00:01:23.820> matter<00:01:23.939> of<00:01:24.119> undoing<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.140> screws<00:01:25.229> and

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
just a matter of undoing the screws and

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.490 
just a matter of undoing the screws and
then<00:01:26.610> you<00:01:26.700> have<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:26.939> model<00:01:27.270> free<00:01:28.229> to<00:01:28.380> have<00:01:28.470> a

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
then you have the model free to have a

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.580 
then you have the model free to have a
look<00:01:28.680> at<00:01:29.659> so<00:01:30.659> let's<00:01:30.840> have<00:01:30.990> a<00:01:31.049> quick<00:01:31.200> look<00:01:31.229> at

you can see here there's some fine bolts
and<00:01:49.560> plates<00:01:49.790> that<00:01:50.790> are<00:01:50.850> modelled<00:01:51.210> in<00:01:51.420> small

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
and plates that are modelled in small

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.960 
and plates that are modelled in small
scale<00:01:52.170> and<00:01:52.439> if<00:01:53.310> we<00:01:53.430> look<00:01:53.549> at<00:01:53.670> some<00:01:53.850> of<00:01:53.909> the

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
scale and if we look at some of the

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.730 
scale and if we look at some of the
graphics<00:01:54.360> again<00:01:54.630> they're<00:01:54.840> very<00:01:55.110> very<00:01:55.320> small

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740

graphics again they're very very small
and<00:01:56.009> quite<00:01:56.790> legible<00:01:57.090> even<00:01:57.990> at<00:01:58.079> this<00:01:58.170> scale

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
and quite legible even at this scale

00:01:58.469 --> 00:01:59.359 
and quite legible even at this scale
which<00:01:58.649> is<00:01:58.680> very<00:01:59.040> good

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
which is very good

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:02.090 
which is very good
the<00:02:00.360> operators<00:02:00.869> area<00:02:01.170> is<00:02:01.320> quite<00:02:01.530> nice<00:02:01.770> with<00:02:02.040> a

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
the operators area is quite nice with a

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.600 
the operators area is quite nice with a
black<00:02:03.000> seat<00:02:03.360> and<00:02:03.649> with<00:02:04.649> a<00:02:04.680> bank<00:02:05.100> of<00:02:05.219> control

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
black seat and with a bank of control

black seat and with a bank of control
levers<00:02:05.939> which<00:02:06.149> are<00:02:06.299> perhaps<00:02:06.509> slightly<00:02:06.719> large

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
levers which are perhaps slightly large

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.469 
levers which are perhaps slightly large
for<00:02:07.979> the<00:02:08.069> scale<00:02:08.340> but<00:02:09.030> they're<00:02:09.149> made<00:02:09.270> of<00:02:09.390> that

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
for the scale but they're made of that

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.330 
for the scale but they're made of that
kind<00:02:09.810> of<00:02:09.899> soft<00:02:10.140> plastic<00:02:10.289> which<00:02:11.009> actually

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
kind of soft plastic which actually

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.430 
kind of soft plastic which actually
gives<00:02:11.489> them<00:02:11.610> a<00:02:11.670> little<00:02:11.849> bit<00:02:11.940> of<00:02:12.000> move

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
gives them a little bit of move

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.360 
gives them a little bit of move
and<00:02:12.620> makes<00:02:13.250> it<00:02:13.400> feel<00:02:13.880> like<00:02:14.000> the<00:02:14.060> leaders<00:02:14.390> move

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:15.370 
and makes it feel like the leaders move

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:18.220 
and makes it feel like the leaders move
the<00:02:16.370> bucket<00:02:16.580> is<00:02:16.790> a<00:02:16.820> nice<00:02:17.030> casting<00:02:17.570> with<00:02:17.780> where

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
the bucket is a nice casting with where

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.140 
the bucket is a nice casting with where
plates<00:02:18.530> on<00:02:18.710> the<00:02:18.800> bottom<00:02:19.100> and<00:02:19.340> if<00:02:19.790> we<00:02:19.910> look<00:02:20.030> at

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
plates on the bottom and if we look at

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:22.840 
plates on the bottom and if we look at
the<00:02:20.300> mechanism<00:02:20.900> for<00:02:20.930> lifting<00:02:21.380> the<00:02:21.500> bucket<00:02:21.850> you

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
the mechanism for lifting the bucket you

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.640 
the mechanism for lifting the bucket you
can<00:02:22.880> see<00:02:23.090> there<00:02:23.240> the<00:02:23.540> rivets<00:02:23.870> are<00:02:24.050> quite<00:02:24.440> large

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
can see there the rivets are quite large

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.260 
can see there the rivets are quite large
on<00:02:24.890> the<00:02:25.010> model<00:02:25.280> but<00:02:25.880> at<00:02:25.970> least<00:02:26.060> they're

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
on the model but at least they're

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:27.990 
on the model but at least they're
painted<00:02:26.690> so<00:02:26.900> they<00:02:27.020> don't<00:02:27.200> look<00:02:27.320> too<00:02:27.530> bad

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
painted so they don't look too bad

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.640 
painted so they don't look too bad
so<00:02:29.000> let's<00:02:29.210> now<00:02:29.390> cut<00:02:29.630> to<00:02:29.660> some<00:02:29.900> live<00:02:30.050> action<00:02:30.080> to

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
so let's now cut to some live action to

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.890 
so let's now cut to some live action to
look<00:02:30.860> at<00:02:30.950> the<00:02:31.070> features<00:02:31.370> of<00:02:31.400> the<00:02:31.610> model<00:02:31.910> the

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
look at the features of the model the

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.830 
look at the features of the model the
first<00:02:33.050> item<00:02:33.470> is<00:02:33.680> the<00:02:33.980> metal<00:02:34.610> tracks<00:02:34.880> which<00:02:35.300> all

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
first item is the metal tracks which all

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.890 
first item is the metal tracks which all
quite<00:02:36.230> well<00:02:36.470> they're<00:02:36.680> quite<00:02:36.770> smooth<00:02:37.810> but<00:02:38.810> they

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
quite well they're quite smooth but they

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.050 
quite well they're quite smooth but they
do<00:02:38.960> roll<00:02:39.320> together<00:02:39.500> and<00:02:40.190> that's<00:02:40.490> because<00:02:40.880> they

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
do roll together and that's because they

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.480 
do roll together and that's because they
are<00:02:41.090> linked<00:02:41.510> through<00:02:41.570> the<00:02:41.840> rear<00:02:42.020> axle<00:02:42.530> so<00:02:43.340> it's

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:43.490 
are linked through the rear axle so it's

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:45.280 
are linked through the rear axle so it's
not<00:02:43.610> possible<00:02:43.940> to<00:02:44.090> turn<00:02:44.240> the<00:02:44.510> model<00:02:44.960> by<00:02:45.080> just

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
not possible to turn the model by just

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.220 
not possible to turn the model by just
moving<00:02:45.440> one<00:02:46.310> of<00:02:46.400> the<00:02:46.490> tracks<00:02:46.730> the<00:02:47.630> loader<00:02:48.020> arm

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
moving one of the tracks the loader arm

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.450 
moving one of the tracks the loader arm
lifts<00:02:48.560> up<00:02:48.710> and<00:02:49.270> also<00:02:50.270> you<00:02:50.720> can<00:02:51.110> take<00:02:51.560> tip<00:02:52.280> the

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:52.460 
lifts up and also you can take tip the

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.870 
lifts up and also you can take tip the
bucket<00:02:52.580> forward<00:02:53.120> just<00:02:53.750> like<00:02:53.840> that<00:02:54.430> all<00:02:55.430> fairly

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880 
bucket forward just like that all fairly

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.330 
bucket forward just like that all fairly
simple<00:02:56.720> and<00:02:56.840> straightforward<00:02:56.900> I'm<00:02:57.710> not<00:02:58.160> sure

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
simple and straightforward I'm not sure

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:00.910 
simple and straightforward I'm not sure
the<00:02:58.490> lifting<00:02:59.390> heights<00:02:59.630> that<00:03:00.200> are<00:03:00.380> high<00:03:00.590> and

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
the lifting heights that are high and

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.280 
the lifting heights that are high and
uncertainly<00:03:01.490> the<00:03:01.580> tipping<00:03:01.880> angle<00:03:02.210> seems<00:03:02.450> just

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
uncertainly the tipping angle seems just

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.350 
uncertainly the tipping angle seems just
a<00:03:03.380> little<00:03:03.740> bit<00:03:03.830> of<00:03:03.890> shallow<00:03:04.070> perhaps<00:03:04.460> but<00:03:05.240> it

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
a little bit of shallow perhaps but it

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.630 
a little bit of shallow perhaps but it
all<00:03:05.450> works<00:03:05.660> well<00:03:05.780> enough<00:03:06.310> here's<00:03:07.310> a<00:03:07.400> picture

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
all works well enough here's a picture

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.940 
all works well enough here's a picture
of<00:03:07.760> the<00:03:07.940> old-timer<00:03:08.330> cat<00:03:08.630> 977<00:03:09.350> on<00:03:09.590> its<00:03:09.740> way<00:03:09.890> to

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
of the old-timer cat 977 on its way to

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:12.370 
of the old-timer cat 977 on its way to
the<00:03:10.130> museum<00:03:10.220> and<00:03:10.790> no<00:03:11.570> voice<00:03:11.750> is<00:03:12.050> quite<00:03:12.200> a<00:03:12.230> nice

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
the museum and no voice is quite a nice

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.320 
the museum and no voice is quite a nice
little<00:03:12.740> model<00:03:13.010> by<00:03:13.190> norscot<00:03:13.670> and<00:03:13.880> it<00:03:14.210> will

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
little model by norscot and it will

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.150 
little model by norscot and it will
bring<00:03:14.480> back<00:03:14.630> memories<00:03:14.840> for<00:03:15.230> those<00:03:15.410> who've

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:16.160 
bring back memories for those who've

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:17.860 
bring back memories for those who've
been<00:03:16.340> around<00:03:16.459> long<00:03:16.670> enough<00:03:16.700> to<00:03:16.910> see<00:03:17.180> the<00:03:17.360> real

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
been around long enough to see the real

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:20.890 
been around long enough to see the real
machine<00:03:18.020> at<00:03:18.650> work<00:03:18.890> it<00:03:19.820> has<00:03:20.030> enough<00:03:20.270> reasonable

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
machine at work it has enough reasonable

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.930
