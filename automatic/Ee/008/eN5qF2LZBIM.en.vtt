because I don't have a greenhouse
and<00:02:11.140> having<00:02:12.140> a<00:02:12.230> greenhouse<00:02:12.530> where<00:02:12.770> I<00:02:12.800> live

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
and having a greenhouse where I live

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.070 
and having a greenhouse where I live
would<00:02:13.220> be<00:02:13.250> wouldn't<00:02:14.180> be<00:02:14.420> very<00:02:14.630> functional

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
would be wouldn't be very functional

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.140 
would be wouldn't be very functional
anyway<00:02:15.470> just<00:02:15.740> because<00:02:16.040> it's<00:02:16.250> so<00:02:16.460> warm<00:02:16.790> most

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.150 
anyway just because it's so warm most

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.240 
anyway just because it's so warm most
the<00:02:17.330> time<00:02:17.570> and<00:02:17.960> we<00:02:18.590> also<00:02:18.710> have<00:02:18.980> a<00:02:19.010> lot<00:02:19.220> of

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
the time and we also have a lot of

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:21.640 
the time and we also have a lot of
tropical<00:02:19.760> storms<00:02:20.300> and<00:02:20.480> hurricanes<00:02:21.020> and<00:02:21.440> so<00:02:21.590> I

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
tropical storms and hurricanes and so I

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.020 
tropical storms and hurricanes and so I
could<00:02:21.800> always<00:02:21.950> have<00:02:22.130> something<00:02:22.370> blow<00:02:22.790> over

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
could always have something blow over

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.760 
could always have something blow over
and<00:02:23.510> I<00:02:23.570> would<00:02:23.660> hate<00:02:23.870> to<00:02:23.900> have<00:02:24.050> that<00:02:24.200> happen<00:02:25.060> so

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:26.770 
and I would hate to have that happen so

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.550 
and I would hate to have that happen so
I've<00:02:27.770> tried<00:02:28.210> starting<00:02:29.210> seeds<00:02:29.660> outside<00:02:30.290> on<00:02:30.530> my

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
I've tried starting seeds outside on my

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.910 
I've tried starting seeds outside on my
screened-in<00:02:30.980> porch<00:02:31.460> and<00:02:32.290> that<00:02:33.290> did<00:02:33.470> not<00:02:33.650> work

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
screened-in porch and that did not work

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.250 
screened-in porch and that did not work
out<00:02:34.250> I<00:02:34.310> mean<00:02:34.610> they<00:02:34.760> they<00:02:35.120> germinated<00:02:35.810> but<00:02:36.170> the

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
out I mean they they germinated but the

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.720 
out I mean they they germinated but the
plants<00:02:36.560> just<00:02:36.620> weren't<00:02:36.920> very<00:02:37.100> healthy<00:02:37.610> and

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
plants just weren't very healthy and

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.660 
plants just weren't very healthy and
they<00:02:37.820> weren't<00:02:37.970> thriving<00:02:38.710> so<00:02:39.710> I<00:02:39.740> tried<00:02:40.130> some

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
they weren't thriving so I tried some

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.240 
they weren't thriving so I tried some
indoor<00:02:41.000> window<00:02:41.330> cells<00:02:41.600> in<00:02:41.810> my<00:02:41.900> kitchen<00:02:42.140> and<00:02:42.680> in

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
indoor window cells in my kitchen and in

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.430 
indoor window cells in my kitchen and in
my<00:02:43.340> dining<00:02:43.760> room<00:02:43.790> and<00:02:44.540> they<00:02:44.750> again<00:02:45.380> they

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
my dining room and they again they

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.190 
my dining room and they again they
germinated<00:02:46.280> but<00:02:46.490> just<00:02:46.820> weren't<00:02:47.060> thriving<00:02:47.720> and

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
germinated but just weren't thriving and

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.600 
germinated but just weren't thriving and
it<00:02:48.350> seemed<00:02:48.500> like<00:02:48.650> the<00:02:48.740> only<00:02:48.890> place<00:02:49.070> that<00:02:49.190> that

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
it seemed like the only place that that

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.270 
it seemed like the only place that that
I<00:02:50.180> had<00:02:50.360> remembered<00:02:50.510> or<00:02:51.080> recall<00:02:51.440> trying<00:02:52.040> out

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
I had remembered or recall trying out

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.130 
I had remembered or recall trying out
wasn't<00:02:52.490> one<00:02:52.700> of<00:02:52.730> my<00:02:52.910> bedroom<00:02:53.360> windows<00:02:53.810> and

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:54.140 
wasn't one of my bedroom windows and

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.060 
wasn't one of my bedroom windows and
it's<00:02:54.800> a<00:02:54.890> south-facing<00:02:55.190> window<00:02:56.030> so<00:02:56.900> I<00:02:57.230> have

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
it's a south-facing window so I have

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:00.400 
it's a south-facing window so I have
always<00:02:58.220> had<00:02:58.760> some<00:02:58.940> luck<00:02:59.150> there<00:02:59.360> one<00:02:59.540> time<00:02:59.720> so<00:03:00.110> I

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
always had some luck there one time so I

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.980 
always had some luck there one time so I
got<00:03:01.070> to<00:03:01.190> thinking<00:03:01.610> that<00:03:01.850> that<00:03:02.690> would<00:03:02.840> be<00:03:02.960> a

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:02.990 
got to thinking that that would be a

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:06.550 
got to thinking that that would be a
good<00:03:03.110> place<00:03:03.260> to<00:03:03.320> start<00:03:04.480> you<00:03:05.480> know<00:03:05.630> to<00:03:06.170> try<00:03:06.470> to

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
good place to start you know to try to

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:09.760 
good place to start you know to try to
start<00:03:07.570> germinating<00:03:08.570> some<00:03:08.780> seed<00:03:09.080> so<00:03:09.470> I'm<00:03:09.560> going

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:09.770 
start germinating some seed so I'm going

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:11.800 
start germinating some seed so I'm going
ahead<00:03:09.860> and<00:03:10.640> I'm<00:03:10.850> gonna<00:03:11.150> show<00:03:11.390> you<00:03:11.450> what<00:03:11.690> I've

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
ahead and I'm gonna show you what I've

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.670 
ahead and I'm gonna show you what I've
kind<00:03:12.410> of<00:03:12.700> done<00:03:13.700> in<00:03:14.180> my<00:03:14.450> bedroom<00:03:14.660> when<00:03:15.530> our

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:25.880 
I've started to try to start some seeds

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:26.590 
I've started to try to start some seeds
over<00:03:26.120> here

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 
over here

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.180 
over here

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:28.190 
and a lot of the seeds I ordered for

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.790 
and a lot of the seeds I ordered for
Baker<00:03:28.370> Creek<00:03:28.730> I<00:03:29.060> put<00:03:29.780> them<00:03:29.960> in<00:03:30.230> just<00:03:30.650> a<00:03:30.770> little

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.600 
container and I'm marking with a big
popsicle<00:03:37.310> stick<00:03:37.490> craft<00:03:38.060> stick<00:03:39.010> so<00:03:40.010> hopefully

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:40.610 
popsicle stick craft stick so hopefully

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:42.790 
popsicle stick craft stick so hopefully
these<00:03:40.730> will<00:03:40.820> germinate<00:03:41.060> okay<00:03:41.570> this<00:03:42.410> gets<00:03:42.650> a

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:42.800 
these will germinate okay this gets a

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:44.830 
these will germinate okay this gets a
South<00:03:43.190> a<00:03:43.220> south-facing<00:03:43.670> window<00:03:44.450> and<00:03:44.630> it<00:03:44.720> gets

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
South a south-facing window and it gets

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.480 
South a south-facing window and it gets
a<00:03:44.960> lot<00:03:45.140> of<00:03:45.200> sunlight<00:03:45.550> all<00:03:46.550> day<00:03:46.850> long<00:03:48.160> so<00:03:49.160> over

a lot of sunlight all day long so over
here<00:03:50.140> I've<00:03:51.140> already<00:03:51.320> started<00:03:51.680> some<00:03:51.890> in<00:03:52.010> peat

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
here I've already started some in peat

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.520 
here I've already started some in peat
pots<00:03:52.460> and<00:03:52.700> I'm<00:03:52.760> not<00:03:52.910> sure<00:03:53.120> that<00:03:53.390> I<00:03:54.170> should<00:03:54.440> do

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
pots and I'm not sure that I should do

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.440 
pots and I'm not sure that I should do
this<00:03:54.740> you<00:03:54.890> know<00:03:55.010> kind<00:03:55.280> of<00:03:55.310> new<00:03:55.490> and<00:03:55.670> starting

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
this you know kind of new and starting

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:57.760 
this you know kind of new and starting
seeds<00:03:56.690> I'm<00:03:56.810> sure<00:03:56.990> if<00:03:57.140> I<00:03:57.230> would<00:03:57.380> just<00:03:57.500> take<00:03:57.620> the

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:57.770 
seeds I'm sure if I would just take the

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:00.400 
seeds I'm sure if I would just take the
time<00:03:57.950> and<00:03:58.190> read<00:03:58.340> mill<00:03:59.240> Bartholomew's<00:04:00.110> look

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
time and read mill Bartholomew's look

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:03.160 
time and read mill Bartholomew's look
and<00:04:01.010> follow<00:04:01.250> it<00:04:01.550> I<00:04:01.780> wouldn't<00:04:02.780> have<00:04:02.870> to<00:04:03.020> get

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
and follow it I wouldn't have to get

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:04.750 
and follow it I wouldn't have to get
through<00:04:03.320> all<00:04:03.440> this<00:04:03.560> experimentation<00:04:04.280> like<00:04:04.640> I

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760 
through all this experimentation like I

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.780 
through all this experimentation like I

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
soil so it can become healthy so that's
