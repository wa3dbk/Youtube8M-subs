00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:06.250
 Where have the times gone when you were a big mess with 200 hp? 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:10.700
 nowadays life starts at 240 hp the new canon it at the hot 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.710
 hatchbacks are called audi s3 and mazda 3 nps these have two respectively around it 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.060
 65 from 260 hp ger 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.410
 on a drenched circuit of axes we watch what they are playing against the 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.800
 bmw 130i 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.960
 also on wall street in the sea and the volkswagen golf r32 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.739
 A year after Volkswagen opened up with the 200 HP strong Golf GTD newspaper 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:35.890
 back with the astra opcw 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.210
 with about 240 hp he was almost a second faster in the sprint from 0 to 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:41.860
 100 than the GT 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.100
 volkswagen has now prezzent the claim in the thirty of the g with 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.800
 130 hp 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.980
 but because it was not yet available stupid with this film the 50 hp strong 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.980
 there 32 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.190
 was there now comes with the superlative the mazda 3 mps this has but 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:07.190
 no less than 260 hp under the hood that he distributes over just two tires 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.000
 front two 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 the figures on the mast make an impression but it really is that good 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:17.300
 the odd one out of this 50 is the bmw 130i cup 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.440
 thanks to the optional parquet, it still looks like a sporty party 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.230
 but in principle this is a normal heads work with a very thick engine 

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:29.650
 it is with 265 hp that are released on the rear wheels even the strongest 

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.750
 engine 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.040
 the last of these five is the audi s3 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.620
 This four wheel drive orange can our ball is equipped with 265 hp 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.920
 it is therefore one to take into account 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.960
 we went to work on the rebuilt tiety circuit of assen unfortunately on one 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.960
 soaking wet job but that should not spoil the fun 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.500
 it is a true feast to go up each of these cars screening piece 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.550
 they all have a different character 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:01.320
 all that break created impressive performance and its tasteful appearance 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.200
 the wave no longer emotion due to its great sounding v6 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.479
 the masts have a lot of power for little money 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:19.459
 The BMW has great engine primark properties 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:26.669
 and the open long has a very good control can great chassis 

00:02:34.429 --> 00:02:37.919
 a judgment is therefore not easily passed, but ultimately the consequences prevail 

00:02:37.919 --> 00:02:39.929
 the opel astra open sea 

00:02:39.929 --> 00:02:44.560
 despite having only a power of 240 hp the effect down to the second time 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.060
 chassis is thick before the decision has been made and everything is in place 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.419
 well screwed together 

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:53.269
 the price is considerably lower than three of the other four models in this test
