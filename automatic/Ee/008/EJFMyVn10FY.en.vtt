00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
today I'm going to go over how to wind a

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.839 
today I'm going to go over how to wind a
manual<00:00:04.259> wind<00:00:04.730> radio<00:00:05.730> Mir<00:00:06.200> Panerai<00:00:07.610> so<00:00:08.610> you<00:00:08.700> see

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
manual wind radio Mir Panerai so you see

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.910 
manual wind radio Mir Panerai so you see
this<00:00:08.970> is<00:00:09.120> a<00:00:09.150> manual<00:00:09.599> wind<00:00:09.780> watch<00:00:12.679> here's<00:00:13.679> your

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
this is a manual wind watch here's your

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.580 
this is a manual wind watch here's your
mainspring<00:00:14.460> that<00:00:14.940> sits<00:00:15.269> inside<00:00:15.599> this<00:00:16.170> barrel

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
mainspring that sits inside this barrel

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.290 
mainspring that sits inside this barrel
here<00:00:17.060> as<00:00:18.060> you<00:00:18.330> turn<00:00:18.539> the<00:00:18.570> crown<00:00:19.400> it<00:00:20.400> will<00:00:20.670> turn

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
here as you turn the crown it will turn

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.130 
here as you turn the crown it will turn
this<00:00:21.420> gear<00:00:21.689> here<00:00:21.930> and<00:00:22.170> then<00:00:23.039> it<00:00:23.160> will<00:00:24.140> turn

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
this gear here and then it will turn

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.599 
this gear here and then it will turn
this<00:00:25.380> barrel<00:00:25.769> and<00:00:25.890> there's<00:00:26.070> mainspring<00:00:26.460> that

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
this barrel and there's mainspring that

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:27.970 
this barrel and there's mainspring that
gets<00:00:26.730> tighter<00:00:26.939> and<00:00:27.119> tighter<00:00:27.269> and<00:00:27.539> tighter

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:27.980 
gets tighter and tighter and tighter

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.009 
gets tighter and tighter and tighter
inside<00:00:28.980> there<00:00:29.279> which<00:00:29.820> is<00:00:30.029> basically<00:00:30.810> your

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
inside there which is basically your

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:33.350 
inside there which is basically your
fuel<00:00:31.320> to<00:00:31.650> keep<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.550> watch<00:00:32.700> running<00:00:33.059> so<00:00:33.210> as<00:00:33.270> you

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
fuel to keep the watch running so as you

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.000 
fuel to keep the watch running so as you
can<00:00:33.450> see<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.840> watch<00:00:33.989> is<00:00:34.230> not<00:00:34.410> running<00:00:34.739> at<00:00:34.890> the

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
can see the watch is not running at the

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.500 
can see the watch is not running at the
moment<00:00:35.450> so<00:00:37.399> how<00:00:38.399> to<00:00:38.460> properly<00:00:38.850> do<00:00:39.120> this<00:00:39.300> so<00:00:39.420> the

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
moment so how to properly do this so the

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.510 
moment so how to properly do this so the
crown<00:00:39.750> should<00:00:40.050> be<00:00:40.200> in<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.410> in<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:41.010> tight

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
crown should be in the in the tight

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.619 
crown should be in the in the tight
position<00:00:42.620> so<00:00:43.620> what<00:00:43.770> you<00:00:43.890> do<00:00:44.010> is<00:00:44.160> is<00:00:44.309> you<00:00:44.629> grab

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
position so what you do is is you grab

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.500 
position so what you do is is you grab
it<00:00:45.750> with<00:00:45.780> two<00:00:45.870> fingers<00:00:46.200> and<00:00:47.039> rotate

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
it with two fingers and rotate

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.750 
it with two fingers and rotate
counterclockwise<00:00:49.010> so<00:00:50.010> back<00:00:50.219> towards

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
counterclockwise so back towards

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.639 
counterclockwise so back towards
yourself<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.449> nothing's<00:00:52.020> fast

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
yourself and nothing's fast

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.520 
yourself and nothing's fast
nothing's<00:00:53.370> in<00:00:53.520> a<00:00:53.579> hurry<00:00:55.670> very<00:00:56.670> slowly<00:00:56.969> unwind

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
nothing's in a hurry very slowly unwind

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.020 
nothing's in a hurry very slowly unwind
back<00:00:58.530> towards<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:59.010> and<00:00:59.190> it<00:00:59.550> should<00:00:59.699> come<00:00:59.879> out

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
back towards you and it should come out

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.270 
back towards you and it should come out
to<00:01:00.180> this<00:01:00.500> neutral<00:01:01.500> position

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
to this neutral position

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.700 
to this neutral position
where<00:01:02.910> you<00:01:03.000> can<00:01:03.149> push<00:01:03.329> it<00:01:03.449> back<00:01:03.600> and<00:01:03.809> forth<00:01:04.049> if

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
where you can push it back and forth if

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.050 
where you can push it back and forth if
you've<00:01:04.860> had<00:01:05.010> to<00:01:05.100> watch<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:05.430> while

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
you've had to watch a while

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.910 
you've had to watch a while
or<00:01:06.450> if<00:01:06.600> it<00:01:06.689> hasn't<00:01:06.840> been<00:01:07.020> serviced<00:01:07.409> recently

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
or if it hasn't been serviced recently

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.070 
or if it hasn't been serviced recently
sometimes<00:01:08.610> you<00:01:08.790> might<00:01:09.000> just<00:01:09.540> have<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:09.900> give<00:01:10.049> it

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
sometimes you might just have to give it

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.600 
sometimes you might just have to give it
a<00:01:10.170> little<00:01:10.260> help<00:01:10.560> just<00:01:10.860> to<00:01:10.950> get<00:01:11.070> it<00:01:11.189> out<00:01:11.340> to<00:01:11.369> that

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
a little help just to get it out to that

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.289 
a little help just to get it out to that
kind<00:01:11.880> of<00:01:11.970> first<00:01:12.750> neutral<00:01:13.619> position<00:01:14.180> so<00:01:15.180> what

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
kind of first neutral position so what

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:21.530 
kind of first neutral position so what
you<00:01:15.390> do<00:01:15.509> here<00:01:15.540> is<00:01:15.869> now<00:01:16.500> you<00:01:16.560> wind<00:01:17.490> forward<00:01:20.540> so

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
you do here is now you wind forward so

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.630 
you do here is now you wind forward so
if<00:01:21.600> you<00:01:21.689> can<00:01:21.810> hear<00:01:22.049> that<00:01:22.340> so<00:01:23.340> you're<00:01:23.490> going<00:01:23.520> to

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
if you can hear that so you're going to

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.700 
if you can hear that so you're going to
take<00:01:23.850> the<00:01:23.970> two<00:01:24.119> fingers<00:01:24.540> and<00:01:24.750> you're<00:01:25.560> going<00:01:25.680> to

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
take the two fingers and you're going to

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.490 
take the two fingers and you're going to
wind<00:01:25.920> slowly<00:01:26.330> clockwise<00:01:27.330> you<00:01:28.049> don't<00:01:28.200> have<00:01:28.320> to

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
wind slowly clockwise you don't have to

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.179 
wind slowly clockwise you don't have to
rotate<00:01:28.770> it<00:01:29.009> back<00:01:29.280> forth<00:01:29.640> back<00:01:29.970> forth

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:31.189 
rotate it back forth back forth

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:33.710 
rotate it back forth back forth
backwards<00:01:32.189> forwards<00:01:32.820> any<00:01:33.210> other<00:01:33.420> direction

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
backwards forwards any other direction

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.499 
backwards forwards any other direction
just<00:01:35.420> clockwise<00:01:36.420> just<00:01:36.920> winding<00:01:37.920> it<00:01:38.009> forward

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
just clockwise just winding it forward

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:41.450 
just clockwise just winding it forward
so<00:01:39.509> I'll<00:01:39.659> show<00:01:39.840> you<00:01:39.869> what<00:01:40.079> that<00:01:40.110> what<00:01:41.070> that<00:01:41.250> is

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
so I'll show you what that what that is

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.420 
so I'll show you what that what that is
doing<00:01:42.710> so<00:01:43.710> on<00:01:43.950> this<00:01:44.220> watch<00:01:44.490> just<00:01:45.450> like<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:46.430> pam

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
doing so on this watch just like the pam

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.530 
doing so on this watch just like the pam
112<00:01:47.909> then<00:01:48.270> on<00:01:48.720> the<00:01:48.869> previous<00:01:49.200> video<00:01:50.540> it's

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
112 then on the previous video it's

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.840 
112 then on the previous video it's
going<00:01:51.750> to<00:01:51.810> turn<00:01:51.899> this<00:01:52.140> gear<00:01:52.380> here<00:01:52.710> which<00:01:53.700> in

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
going to turn this gear here which in

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.080 
going to turn this gear here which in
turn<00:01:54.090> is<00:01:54.450> turning<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:54.899> mainspring<00:01:55.969> inside<00:01:56.969> of

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
turn is turning the mainspring inside of

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.840 
turn is turning the mainspring inside of
that<00:01:57.180> barrel<00:01:58.009> so<00:01:59.009> inside<00:01:59.430> that<00:01:59.460> barrel

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
that barrel so inside that barrel

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.359 
that barrel so inside that barrel
there's<00:02:00.030> a<00:02:00.380> let's<00:02:01.380> say<00:02:01.530> a<00:02:01.579> two<00:02:02.579> foot<00:02:03.829> spring<00:02:04.829> a

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
there's a let's say a two foot spring a

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.100 
there's a let's say a two foot spring a
little<00:02:05.759> flat<00:02:06.420> piece<00:02:06.600> of<00:02:06.630> metal<00:02:06.719> that<00:02:06.930> gets

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
little flat piece of metal that gets

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.149 
little flat piece of metal that gets
wound<00:02:07.320> up<00:02:07.500> wound<00:02:07.680> up<00:02:07.860> wound<00:02:08.039> up<00:02:08.220> wound<00:02:08.459> up<00:02:08.640> and

00:02:11.149 --> 00:02:11.159 

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:14.910 

so<00:02:12.159> as<00:02:12.250> you<00:02:12.340> keep<00:02:12.549> winding<00:02:13.620> just<00:02:14.620> going<00:02:14.739> to<00:02:14.830> go

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
so as you keep winding just going to go

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.220 
so as you keep winding just going to go
forward<00:02:15.220> and<00:02:15.489> you<00:02:16.150> just<00:02:16.299> keep<00:02:16.480> winding<00:02:16.780> so

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
forward and you just keep winding so

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:19.680 
forward and you just keep winding so
this<00:02:17.379> is<00:02:17.560> obviously<00:02:17.920> reverse<00:02:18.519> so<00:02:19.299> normally

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
this is obviously reverse so normally

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.680 
this is obviously reverse so normally
you<00:02:20.319> would<00:02:20.470> be<00:02:20.700> winding<00:02:21.700> it<00:02:21.819> this<00:02:22.000> way<00:02:22.209> but<00:02:22.569> I'm

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:22.690 
you would be winding it this way but I'm

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:24.949 
you would be winding it this way but I'm
just<00:02:22.810> doing<00:02:22.959> this<00:02:23.260> so<00:02:23.530> you<00:02:23.739> can<00:02:24.280> see<00:02:24.310> exactly

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
just doing this so you can see exactly

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.520 
just doing this so you can see exactly
what<00:02:25.959> it's<00:02:26.110> doing<00:02:26.760> it<00:02:27.760> might<00:02:28.030> help<00:02:28.180> you

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
what it's doing it might help you

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.920 
what it's doing it might help you
understand<00:02:29.530> it<00:02:29.620> a<00:02:29.680> little<00:02:29.769> bit<00:02:29.920> better<00:02:30.069> so<00:02:30.930> as

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
understand it a little bit better so as

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.240 
understand it a little bit better so as
you<00:02:32.019> wind<00:02:32.200> it<00:02:32.379> it<00:02:32.620> just<00:02:32.829> keeps<00:02:33.010> getting

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
you wind it it just keeps getting

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.600 
you wind it it just keeps getting
tighter<00:02:33.280> and<00:02:34.060> tighter<00:02:34.470> and<00:02:35.470> you<00:02:36.129> keep<00:02:36.310> going

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
tighter and tighter and you keep going

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.160 
tighter and tighter and you keep going
in<00:02:36.700> you'll<00:02:37.180> start<00:02:37.480> to<00:02:37.569> get<00:02:37.659> a<00:02:37.720> little<00:02:37.840> tension

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
in you'll start to get a little tension

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:39.720 
in you'll start to get a little tension
imagine<00:02:38.829> the<00:02:38.890> watch<00:02:39.010> let's<00:02:39.220> flip<00:02:39.370> back<00:02:39.549> over

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
imagine the watch let's flip back over

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.490 
imagine the watch let's flip back over
and<00:02:39.970> as<00:02:40.060> you're<00:02:40.299> winding<00:02:40.569> forward<00:02:41.140> forward

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
and as you're winding forward forward

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.539 
and as you're winding forward forward
forward<00:02:42.209> you'll<00:02:43.209> get<00:02:43.450> a<00:02:43.480> little<00:02:43.900> kickback

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
forward you'll get a little kickback

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:47.250 
forward you'll get a little kickback
from<00:02:45.549> this<00:02:45.879> the<00:02:46.180> the<00:02:46.510> crown<00:02:46.720> as<00:02:46.930> you<00:02:47.049> wind

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
from this the the crown as you wind

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.970 
from this the the crown as you wind
forward<00:02:47.769> and<00:02:48.010> as<00:02:48.970> you<00:02:49.090> go<00:02:49.239> to<00:02:49.299> let<00:02:49.450> it<00:02:49.599> go<00:02:49.980> did

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
forward and as you go to let it go did

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.640 
forward and as you go to let it go did
another<00:02:51.250> grip<00:02:51.459> on<00:02:51.579> it<00:02:51.700> to<00:02:51.819> go<00:02:51.940> forward<00:02:52.180> it'll

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650 
another grip on it to go forward it'll

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.589 
another grip on it to go forward it'll
kind<00:02:53.650> of<00:02:53.739> slide<00:02:53.980> back<00:02:54.220> on<00:02:54.459> you<00:02:54.670> you<00:02:55.180> don't<00:02:55.510> have

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:55.599 
kind of slide back on you you don't have

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:58.770 
kind of slide back on you you don't have
to<00:02:55.690> hold<00:02:55.810> it<00:02:56.280> it's<00:02:57.280> just<00:02:57.640> it's<00:02:57.819> a<00:02:58.030> little<00:02:58.569> bit

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
to hold it it's just it's a little bit

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.110 
to hold it it's just it's a little bit
of<00:02:58.840> tension<00:02:58.989> on<00:02:59.260> there<00:02:59.519> so<00:03:00.519> you<00:03:00.549> keep<00:03:00.819> going

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:01.120 
of tension on there so you keep going

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:03.330 
of tension on there so you keep going
then<00:03:02.079> sometimes<00:03:02.409> you<00:03:02.530> can<00:03:02.650> go<00:03:02.739> 40<00:03:03.069> 50<00:03:03.310> times

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
then sometimes you can go 40 50 times

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.520 
then sometimes you can go 40 50 times
sometimes<00:03:03.879> they'll<00:03:04.239> take<00:03:04.420> 16<00:03:04.840> just<00:03:05.140> depending

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:05.530 
sometimes they'll take 16 just depending

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.740 
sometimes they'll take 16 just depending
on<00:03:05.650> how<00:03:05.980> much<00:03:06.519> of<00:03:06.549> a<00:03:06.700> charge<00:03:06.940> already<00:03:07.329> has<00:03:07.480> on

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:07.750 
on how much of a charge already has on

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:11.009 
on how much of a charge already has on
it<00:03:07.930> but<00:03:08.769> you<00:03:09.099> just<00:03:09.129> keep<00:03:09.790> winding<00:03:10.120> and<00:03:10.450> you

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
it but you just keep winding and you

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:12.539 
it but you just keep winding and you
don't<00:03:11.170> necessarily<00:03:11.260> have<00:03:11.739> to<00:03:11.980> go<00:03:12.250> all<00:03:12.400> the<00:03:12.519> way

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:12.549 
don't necessarily have to go all the way

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:16.319 
don't necessarily have to go all the way
to<00:03:12.670> the<00:03:12.819> end<00:03:13.260> but<00:03:14.260> if<00:03:14.349> you<00:03:14.440> do<00:03:14.849> as<00:03:15.849> it<00:03:16.030> starts

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:16.329 
to the end but if you do as it starts

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:19.020 
to the end but if you do as it starts
kicking<00:03:16.959> back<00:03:17.290> at<00:03:17.560> you<00:03:17.680> just<00:03:17.950> go<00:03:18.069> very<00:03:18.400> very

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
kicking back at you just go very very

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.199 
kicking back at you just go very very
slowly<00:03:19.419> you<00:03:19.720> don't<00:03:20.019> want<00:03:20.319> to<00:03:20.410> hit<00:03:20.530> the<00:03:20.650> end

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
slowly you don't want to hit the end

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:26.659 
slowly you don't want to hit the end
quickly<00:03:22.590> and<00:03:24.150> if<00:03:25.150> you<00:03:25.389> do<00:03:25.690> come<00:03:25.989> to<00:03:26.109> the<00:03:26.230> end

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:26.669 
quickly and if you do come to the end

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:28.789 
quickly and if you do come to the end
it'll<00:03:27.669> start<00:03:27.940> getting<00:03:28.060> tighter<00:03:28.359> and<00:03:28.480> tighter

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
it'll start getting tighter and tighter

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:31.319 
it'll start getting tighter and tighter
as<00:03:29.799> it<00:03:29.950> gets<00:03:30.129> to<00:03:30.280> the<00:03:30.370> end<00:03:30.400> when<00:03:30.790> it<00:03:30.910> does<00:03:31.120> hit

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:31.329 
as it gets to the end when it does hit

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:35.490 
as it gets to the end when it does hit
the<00:03:31.480> end<00:03:32.010> you<00:03:33.010> just<00:03:33.220> stop<00:03:34.079> that's<00:03:35.079> it<00:03:35.349> you

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
the end you just stop that's it you

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.009 
the end you just stop that's it you
don't<00:03:35.650> force<00:03:36.160> it<00:03:36.400> you<00:03:36.459> don't<00:03:36.940> continue<00:03:37.780> to

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
don't force it you don't continue to

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:41.039 
don't force it you don't continue to
wind<00:03:38.230> because<00:03:39.190> you<00:03:39.310> will<00:03:39.989> break<00:03:40.989> the

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:41.049 
wind because you will break the

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:42.360 
wind because you will break the
mainspring<00:03:41.500> on<00:03:41.620> the<00:03:41.709> inside<00:03:41.980> there's<00:03:42.310> a

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:42.370 
mainspring on the inside there's a

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:43.949 
mainspring on the inside there's a
little<00:03:42.639> hook<00:03:43.120> in<00:03:43.150> the<00:03:43.299> end<00:03:43.389> of<00:03:43.480> the<00:03:43.540> mainspring

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
little hook in the end of the mainspring

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:45.599 
little hook in the end of the mainspring
and<00:03:44.109> it's<00:03:44.199> dragging<00:03:44.769> on<00:03:45.040> the<00:03:45.099> inside<00:03:45.430> of<00:03:45.549> the

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:45.609 
and it's dragging on the inside of the

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:49.099 
and it's dragging on the inside of the
barrel<00:03:46.440> just<00:03:47.440> another<00:03:47.650> little<00:03:47.859> clip<00:03:48.639> and<00:03:48.910> that

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:49.109 
barrel just another little clip and that

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:51.479 
barrel just another little clip and that
breaks<00:03:50.109> and<00:03:50.709> then<00:03:50.889> you'll<00:03:50.980> get<00:03:51.370> the

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489 
breaks and then you'll get the

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:54.150 
breaks and then you'll get the
mainspring<00:03:51.790> replaced<00:03:52.180> so<00:03:52.900> just<00:03:53.889> remember

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
mainspring replaced so just remember

00:03:54.160 --> 00:04:01.539 
mainspring replaced so just remember
don't<00:03:54.310> over<00:03:54.669> wind<00:03:54.910> the<00:03:55.629> watch

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:01.549 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:05.539 

then<00:04:03.109> once<00:04:04.109> it's<00:04:04.290> fully<00:04:04.499> wound<00:04:04.769> you're<00:04:05.400> going

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:05.549 
then once it's fully wound you're going

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:08.089 
then once it's fully wound you're going
to<00:04:05.609> take<00:04:05.790> the<00:04:05.999> crown<00:04:06.900> and<00:04:07.170> you're<00:04:07.920> going<00:04:08.040> to

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:08.099 
to take the crown and you're going to

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:09.500 
to take the crown and you're going to
what<00:04:08.340> I<00:04:08.370> do<00:04:08.459> is<00:04:08.639> I<00:04:08.730> push<00:04:08.939> it<00:04:09.060> with<00:04:09.150> two<00:04:09.299> fingers

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
what I do is I push it with two fingers

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.360 
what I do is I push it with two fingers
and<00:04:09.840> I<00:04:10.290> roll<00:04:10.469> it<00:04:10.590> backwards<00:04:11.040> a<00:04:11.129> little<00:04:11.159> bit

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
and I roll it backwards a little bit

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:16.400 
and I roll it backwards a little bit
kind<00:04:12.359> of<00:04:12.389> like<00:04:12.510> seating<00:04:12.870> a<00:04:13.430> jar<00:04:14.430> and<00:04:15.259> then<00:04:16.259> you

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
kind of like seating a jar and then you

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:18.949 
kind of like seating a jar and then you
roll<00:04:16.560> it<00:04:16.709> forward<00:04:16.979> to<00:04:17.759> get<00:04:17.910> it<00:04:18.000> to<00:04:18.150> tighten

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
roll it forward to get it to tighten

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.400
