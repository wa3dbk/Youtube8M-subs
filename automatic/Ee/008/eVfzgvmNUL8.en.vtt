00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:07.230
 so here it was worth 100 genec 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:16.730
 so that it is not needed 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:18.930
 disconnect these wires here so here 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:21.240
 everything now has a maximum speed 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.300
 about two hundred and thirty kilometers in 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.300
 hour 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:29.109
 now we will get him 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:39.080
 This tuning such an upgrade leg in order 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:41.680
 there is no key to start 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.680
 pussy 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.960
 area lead forward on 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:19.200
 that's all shit for the Chinese 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.200
 did this fucking wiring 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:36.869
 and now if the same colleagues go seriously 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:46.929
 come first, we need it first 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:52.719
 the control unit of the first and second disk 

00:01:46.929 --> 00:02:00.840
 he is with us right here with them 

00:01:52.719 --> 00:02:03.250
 Jobs understandable name where there is no visible 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:07.179
 actually we are interested in lower 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:13.239
 the terminal of the control unit itself is upper 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:18.250
 gray lower black outline with black 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:21.760
 plant factory 12 terminal it is with us 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.980
 plugged with a rubber stopper to accurately 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:27.519
 make sure all this 12 can be flipped 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:33.489
 This topic and on it numbering is from 1 to 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:35.519
 9 and further from 10 to 18 there in principle 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:38.920
 already wrote that you can use 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:40.950
 motherboard connector summer to poke there 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:44.950
 i made it easier i just pasted 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:49.209
 the wire we strip it 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.810
 used ordinary wires from the network 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:54.660
 cord 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.660
 that's about so expose him 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:00.750
 we twist back the end should be a little bit 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.989
 be different little twisted 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.580
 shot that contact was better and 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:10.620
 here in this place where we later pull out 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:14.629
 gum insert there this wire there 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.629
 very well included 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:27.660
 just basically why did 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:29.580
 so did not put any connector and therefore 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:33.599
 what first checked if at all the meaning 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:36.440
 connect the throttle well 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:39.750
 as it turned out, of course there is a sense 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:42.019
 so when the wire is inserted reverse 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.489
 side look at the terminal itself 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:47.030
 continued just a bit to hang around 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:50.480
 Well, so that did not choose 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:53.090
 a couple of hours pushing 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.849
 Here we do not know the principle 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:04:00.349
 you can see a little bit of it at all 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:04:05.110
 sticking wire I screwed to the very 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:08.120
 Actually to the main tape 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:09.830
 Now I led to the second unit'll show 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:13.730
 where the second block is located is understandable 

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:15.379
 was look a little bit bent over 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:17.419
 other wires, that is, not to fly out 

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:21.169
 Well, in general, in principle, it is thick wire 

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:22.600
 holds very firmly the most important thing 

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:26.900
 to have contact 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:27.710
 you can check any multimeter take 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.639
 cleat 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:30.639
 dress in place 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.770
 we click to check we take 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.409
 multimeter 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:39.909
 yes one pin top plus 

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:42.789
 Rechargeable batteries can be relyuhi 

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:45.909
 turn on the ignition and the second contact 

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:48.759
 multimeter touch the wire and on 

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:50.620
 call if there is a call there he is in 

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:52.930
 In principle, the small will be in principle 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.379
 wire well we hooked look 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:56.310
 farther 

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:56.310
 slipknot 

00:05:02.539 --> 00:05:09.449
 the second block we have is obtained 

00:05:05.489 --> 00:05:11.489
 under the tank is to start you need in the spirit 

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:14.689
 remove errors well, just do not raise 

00:05:11.489 --> 00:05:14.689
 the spirit of instruction will begin 

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:32.509
 siduhi remove so the hair tank does not remove 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:35.780
 you need even the principle of any connectors 

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:41.419
 disable do not need to unscrew 2 bolts 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:44.919
 that i fix without plastic 

00:05:41.419 --> 00:05:44.919
 so far so much easier 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:50.139
 hat fell 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.460
 So 

00:05:55.710 --> 00:06:02.310
 neatly raise here are the problems 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:04.800
 there are already two notes of video wire 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:07.130
 which go collector pump a little 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:10.400
 so fall out neatly with them 

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:14.550
 principle someone firmly falls out someone 

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:19.920
 tank insert so the second block of us 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:23.340
 it turns out he is a black fish 

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:26.130
 next won masters that wire 

00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:28.530
 which we took out of the control unit 

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:31.710
 the first and second engine we deduce vessels 

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:39.060
 here he goes with us where to push 

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:42.440
 full so right now I bolts put remove 

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:42.440
 second terminal 

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:49.790
 remove our own black terminal 

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:57.680
 here on it we need the same absolutely 

00:06:53.660 --> 00:07:01.550
 contact that turns out and on 1 that is 

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:03.950
 this is block 34 that block 12 is 30 fourth 

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:07.460
 we need the same 12 pin on black 

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:09.530
 pads in which we connected the case to 

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:11.390
 that on this pad to him already 

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:13.940
 throttle is connected 

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:18.010
 is seen on the phone can not see it here 

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:18.010
 here is a gray red wire 

00:07:18.449 --> 00:07:23.360
 gray red wire it goes on i'm 

00:07:20.159 --> 00:07:26.069
 did as neatly cut the sheath 

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:27.900
 pulled it cut 

00:07:26.069 --> 00:07:29.729
 but in principle you can not cut 

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:32.009
 just here that wire reel that is 

00:07:29.729 --> 00:07:35.189
 gently remove the tape and reel and I 

00:07:32.009 --> 00:07:36.689
 cut the difference to see 

00:07:35.189 --> 00:07:38.309
 Generally from the connection throttle 

00:07:36.689 --> 00:07:40.680
 damper that is generally the thigh principle 

00:07:38.309 --> 00:07:42.210
 strong wind up from the throttle so I 

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:45.569
 cut that is, if in principle do 

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:46.559
 will immediately cut a special meaning no 

00:07:45.569 --> 00:07:50.490
 just reeling 

00:07:46.559 --> 00:07:52.289
 we isolate this wire 

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:54.659
 preferably all well and actually 

00:07:52.289 --> 00:07:57.509
 put back that is the meaning is that to 

00:07:54.659 --> 00:07:59.999
 to the twelfth pin of this pad 

00:07:57.509 --> 00:08:01.499
 connect 12 pint pads well and 

00:07:59.999 --> 00:08:05.400
 respectively, the throttle on y 

00:08:01.499 --> 00:08:10.169
 there will be a lot of blog right now 

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:14.300
 light dress back now now how 

00:08:10.169 --> 00:08:14.300
 break the bond strictly speaking
