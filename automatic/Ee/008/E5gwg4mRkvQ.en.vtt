00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:27.850
 then it would be long of 22 of 28 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:27.850
 up to 30 feet long 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:34.550
 and then here it says that they enable so 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.550
 can enter the sawmill 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:40.110
 remember the rule doyle is good at 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.579
 the doyle rule is a procedure of 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.550
 measurement marketing 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:48.550
 and that is how they are estimated 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:52.899
 calculate double feet later 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:56.859
 are changed or must be adjusted to meters 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:01:03.150
 cubic roll which is very important 

00:00:56.859 --> 00:01:04.980
 then have the data of the third party 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.280
 therefore we have to have well 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:11.160
 located our batteries inside would be 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:13.860
 we need to have them as well measures 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:16.830
 we give that we are going to measure the diameter 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.560
 let's calculate the surface or the area 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:23.100
 whether we use small and 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:26.900
 hoover or newton and there we can take the 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:29.960
 data to calculate the volumes 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:32.180
 very important then it will be the long 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.420
 of the star would we say we can 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:38.180
 find 16 feet which is the most common 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:41.360
 16 of 8 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:44.750
 and then keep in mind the 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:47.210
 reinforcements so that the data are 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:50.570
 suitable for locating wood 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.000
 so it is very important to measure the 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.830
 diameters 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.770
 the atrocious wound in their faces has 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.960
 certain irregularities and that's why 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:04.050
 convenient 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:06.830
 that in some of the cases we take 12 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:11.600
 or three diameters to get the average 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:13.720
 already with this information of the diameters 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.480
 we can 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:19.480
 based on their lengths and applying the 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:22.950
 newton we said formula q Mariani 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:25.720
 see over there that this one based on light 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:29.640
 surfaces or diameter and the lengths 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:32.160
 we calculate the volume 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.530
 then to have well controlled 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.620
 our inventories is convenient 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:40.110
 have well- placed wood in this 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.720
 wooden case roll 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:46.440
 requires information as we have already 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:49.050
 been commenting on the long 16 well 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:52.740
 good with the reinforcement here in the south of 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:54.250
 chihuahua are 5.5 meters with 88 

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:58.920
 centimeters 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:02.420
 in this case the truck is mobilizing 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:07.880
 8 feet wood spraying 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:10.849
 which represents 2.59 meters then with 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:14.599
 the length and with the diameter diameter 

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:18.150
 in centimeters we can calculate what 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:21.140
 is what the volume 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:24.239
 then we apply the formula there 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:26.879
 that use the diameter for the 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:30.060
 surfaces and the length and we calculate the 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:34.530
 superficial forgiveness we calculate the volume 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:36.689
 of the atrocious hurt well we said that it is 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:41.340
 very important to have the data of 

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:44.670
 larger diameter smaller diameter and long 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:48.049
 and applying clear there using the 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:51.659
 palo de pepe let's calculate the volume 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:54.690
 and so we can locate wood that is 

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:57.480
 transports in trucks that we have in 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:59.030
 patios or that we have projects therefore 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.880
 between 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:05.000
 and this will give us an opportunity to have 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:07.460
 All very well 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:11.200
 controlled and will help us in all 

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:11.200
 our logging activities 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:23.290
 well then we said that we calculate 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:25.780
 the diameters the surfaces and in these 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:29.860
 cases that's why it's important that we take 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:34.150
 the average diameters well then 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:37.420
 we calculate the surfaces the areas the 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:39.880
 area and then the diameter diameter 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:41.580
 average and we do this same 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:45.280
 process 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:47.980
 both in the thick part of the trail or 

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:51.520
 in the thin part and already using 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:55.890
 the long good with your with these data 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.890
 we can calculate the volume 

00:04:56.440 --> 00:05:03.990
 the prosperity can be 8 feet 16 of 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.990
 12 out of 10 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:08.940
 to be located it is very important to have in 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:15.700
 account 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:19.740
 the diameter data is then measured 

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:22.940
 two or three diameters to remove 

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:26.430
 a fact out there in terms of diameter 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:28.680
 the average diameter we can work 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:31.259
 with 

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:35.310
 based on the formula we use is 

00:05:31.259 --> 00:05:38.450
 you can use the diameter 

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:38.450
 or surfaces 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:43.270
 surfaces can be about 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:44.320
 procedures use the diameter 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:48.460
 half others 

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:52.919
 the average surface others calculate a 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:52.919
 average surface of the tracery
