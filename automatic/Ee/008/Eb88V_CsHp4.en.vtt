right I had such hopes for that smash
and<00:02:41.440> I<00:02:41.740> almost<00:02:42.100> was<00:02:42.520> in<00:02:42.670> the<00:02:42.790> clear<00:02:43.150> the

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
and I almost was in the clear the

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:44.850 
and I almost was in the clear the
meeples<00:02:43.780> were<00:02:43.870> flying<00:02:44.290> through<00:02:44.500> the<00:02:44.830> air

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
meeples were flying through the air

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.750 
meeples were flying through the air
safely<00:02:45.670> but<00:02:46.330> one<00:02:46.750> of<00:02:46.780> them<00:02:46.990> escaped<00:02:47.610> first<00:02:48.610> of

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
safely but one of them escaped first of

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.040 
safely but one of them escaped first of
all<00:02:48.910> we<00:02:49.000> have<00:02:49.120> to<00:02:49.240> deal<00:02:49.390> with<00:02:49.540> the<00:02:49.630> collateral

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.050 
all we have to deal with the collateral

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:51.750 
all we have to deal with the collateral
damage<00:02:50.080> I<00:02:50.560> get<00:02:50.800> to<00:02:50.890> gobble<00:02:51.280> up<00:02:51.370> these<00:02:51.520> two

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
damage I get to gobble up these two

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.280 
damage I get to gobble up these two
floors<00:02:52.060> because<00:02:52.270> there's<00:02:52.510> nothing<00:02:52.690> on<00:02:52.900> top<00:02:53.110> of

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
floors because there's nothing on top of

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:54.960 
floors because there's nothing on top of
them<00:02:53.380> and<00:02:53.470> that's<00:02:53.650> great<00:02:53.920> but<00:02:54.459> now<00:02:54.700> that

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
them and that's great but now that

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.030 
them and that's great but now that
soldier<00:02:55.540> has<00:02:55.690> run<00:02:56.019> away<00:02:56.140> to<00:02:56.290> the<00:02:56.650> run<00:02:56.860> away

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
soldier has run away to the run away

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.490

00:02:59.490 --> 00:02:59.500 
board completing this line which means I

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.470 
board completing this line which means I
lose<00:02:59.860> a<00:02:59.890> tooth<00:03:00.280> but<00:03:00.580> I<00:03:00.610> don't<00:03:00.760> have<00:03:00.970> a<00:03:01.000> tooth<00:03:01.300> to

lose a tooth but I don't have a tooth to

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.690 
lose a tooth but I don't have a tooth to
lose<00:03:01.690> so<00:03:02.350> I<00:03:02.380> have<00:03:02.560> to<00:03:02.680> give<00:03:02.830> two<00:03:03.100> of<00:03:03.130> my<00:03:03.370> maples

I've<00:04:22.190> actually<00:04:22.640> rotated<00:04:23.180> the<00:04:23.270> board<00:04:23.540> here<00:04:23.810> a

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:23.840 
I've actually rotated the board here a

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:25.330 
I've actually rotated the board here a
little<00:04:23.990> bit<00:04:24.140> so<00:04:24.200> Luke<00:04:24.590> could<00:04:24.770> reach<00:04:25.010> his

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:25.340 
little bit so Luke could reach his

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:32.140 
little bit so Luke could reach his
monster<00:04:25.820> pause<00:04:26.030> a<00:04:26.060> little<00:04:26.510> more<00:04:26.690> easily<00:04:31.150> now

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
monster pause a little more easily now

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.330 
monster pause a little more easily now
is<00:04:32.270> that<00:04:32.480> what<00:04:32.630> you<00:04:32.690> were<00:04:32.810> trying<00:04:32.960> to<00:04:33.260> go<00:04:33.410> No
