00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
on T I use that as target instead of

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.270 
on T I use that as target instead of
what<00:02:23.760> would<00:02:23.910> default<00:02:24.240> be<00:02:24.390> tab<00:02:24.630> and<00:02:24.870> then<00:02:25.650> my

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:26.280 
what would default be tab and then my

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.370 
what would default be tab and then my
other<00:02:26.490> fingers<00:02:26.880> lie<00:02:27.210> on<00:02:27.570> you<00:02:27.840> I<00:02:28.200> you<00:02:29.070> and<00:02:29.430> I<00:02:29.610> and
