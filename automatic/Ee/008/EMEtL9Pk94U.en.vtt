over<00:00:01.560> the<00:00:01.650> next<00:00:01.829> four<00:00:02.129> webcasts<00:00:02.669> we're<00:00:02.790> going

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909 
over the next four webcasts we're going

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:03.889 
over the next four webcasts we're going
to<00:00:02.970> take<00:00:03.090> a<00:00:03.120> look<00:00:03.300> at<00:00:03.389> some<00:00:03.540> of<00:00:03.659> the<00:00:03.720> most

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:03.899 
to take a look at some of the most

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:05.749 
to take a look at some of the most
important<00:00:04.410> reactions<00:00:04.890> of<00:00:05.130> monosaccharides

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
important reactions of monosaccharides

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:07.670 
important reactions of monosaccharides
and<00:00:06.330> we'll<00:00:06.420> begin<00:00:06.569> with<00:00:06.779> the<00:00:06.899> process<00:00:07.440> of

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
and we'll begin with the process of

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.759 
and we'll begin with the process of
mutarotation<00:00:08.510> which<00:00:09.510> is<00:00:09.780> an<00:00:10.019> inversion<00:00:10.440> of

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
mutarotation which is an inversion of

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.100 
mutarotation which is an inversion of
configuration<00:00:11.040> of<00:00:11.880> the<00:00:12.030> hydroxyl<00:00:12.660> group<00:00:12.929> at

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
configuration of the hydroxyl group at

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.740 
configuration of the hydroxyl group at
the<00:00:13.469> anomeric<00:00:13.740> position<00:00:14.000> so<00:00:15.000> the<00:00:15.120> Alpha<00:00:15.480> form

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
the anomeric position so the Alpha form

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.779 
the anomeric position so the Alpha form
can<00:00:15.960> interconvert<00:00:16.320> to<00:00:16.619> the<00:00:16.740> beta<00:00:16.920> and<00:00:17.220> vice

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
can interconvert to the beta and vice

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.279 
can interconvert to the beta and vice
versa<00:00:18.150> and<00:00:18.359> the<00:00:18.510> way<00:00:18.630> that<00:00:18.840> this<00:00:18.930> can<00:00:19.140> be

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
versa and the way that this can be

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.500 
versa and the way that this can be
tracked<00:00:19.619> it<00:00:20.130> can<00:00:20.310> be<00:00:20.430> followed<00:00:20.850> by<00:00:21.449> the

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
tracked it can be followed by the

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.349

process<00:00:22.109> of<00:00:22.320> specific<00:00:22.890> rotation<00:00:23.359> specific

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
process of specific rotation specific

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:25.490 
process of specific rotation specific
rotation<00:00:24.539> you<00:00:24.930> don't<00:00:25.080> need<00:00:25.199> to<00:00:25.260> know<00:00:25.350> the

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.410 
rotation you don't need to know the
details<00:00:25.949> but<00:00:26.220> if<00:00:26.340> you<00:00:26.430> were<00:00:26.519> to<00:00:26.609> take<00:00:26.760> it's<00:00:27.210> a

reflection it's a characteristic
property<00:00:29.099> of<00:00:29.550> a<00:00:29.640> pure<00:00:29.910> compound<00:00:30.710> so<00:00:31.710> if<00:00:31.800> you

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
property of a pure compound so if you

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.459 
property of a pure compound so if you
were<00:00:32.009> to<00:00:32.099> take<00:00:32.250> pure<00:00:32.640> alpha<00:00:32.910> d<00:00:33.719> glucose<00:00:34.200> a

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
were to take pure alpha d glucose a

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:35.990 
were to take pure alpha d glucose a
solution<00:00:34.920> of<00:00:35.040> that<00:00:35.160> would<00:00:35.340> have<00:00:35.430> a<00:00:35.460> specific

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
solution of that would have a specific

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.780 
solution of that would have a specific
rotation<00:00:36.180> of<00:00:36.660> 112<00:00:37.260> degrees<00:00:37.469> but<00:00:38.370> over<00:00:38.579> time

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
rotation of 112 degrees but over time

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.420 
rotation of 112 degrees but over time
that<00:00:39.059> would<00:00:39.239> evolve<00:00:39.510> to<00:00:39.780> a<00:00:39.989> value<00:00:40.440> of<00:00:40.469> 52<00:00:40.980> point

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
that would evolve to a value of 52 point

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.150 
that would evolve to a value of 52 point
7<00:00:41.960> similarly<00:00:42.960> if<00:00:43.170> you<00:00:43.350> were<00:00:43.469> to<00:00:43.590> take<00:00:43.770> a<00:00:43.800> pure

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
solution of beta-d-glucose initially

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.340 
solution of beta-d-glucose initially
you'd<00:00:47.760> measure<00:00:47.940> a<00:00:48.120> value<00:00:48.360> of<00:00:48.690> eighteen<00:00:49.050> point

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
you'd measure a value of eighteen point

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.560 
you'd measure a value of eighteen point
seven<00:00:49.440> but<00:00:50.160> again<00:00:50.399> over<00:00:50.700> time<00:00:50.969> that<00:00:51.390> would

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
seven but again over time that would

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.150 
seven but again over time that would
evolve<00:00:52.079> to<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.980> same<00:00:53.219> exact<00:00:53.640> value<00:00:54.379> 52.7<00:00:55.379> when

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
evolve to the same exact value 52.7 when

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.979 
evolve to the same exact value 52.7 when
two<00:00:56.399> different<00:00:56.610> solutions<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:57.660> different

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
two different solutions to different

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.639 
two different solutions to different
pure<00:00:58.379> substances<00:00:59.070> converge<00:00:59.640> to<00:00:59.969> a<00:01:00.000> same<00:01:00.649> value

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
pure substances converge to a same value

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.560 
pure substances converge to a same value
of<00:01:01.859> a<00:01:01.980> physical<00:01:02.460> characteristic<00:01:03.090> you

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
of a physical characteristic you

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.329 
of a physical characteristic you
probably<00:01:03.989> are<00:01:04.199> dealing<00:01:04.559> with<00:01:04.589> an<00:01:04.890> equilibrium

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
probably are dealing with an equilibrium

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.130 
probably are dealing with an equilibrium
situation<00:01:06.270> where<00:01:06.450> there's<00:01:06.600> going<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:06.869> be<00:01:06.960> an

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
situation where there's going to be an

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.130 
situation where there's going to be an
equilibrium<00:01:07.590> mixture<00:01:08.340> that<00:01:08.880> lies<00:01:09.180> that<00:01:09.810> is<00:01:10.110> a

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
equilibrium mixture that lies that is a

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.160 
equilibrium mixture that lies that is a
combination<00:01:11.130> of<00:01:11.670> two<00:01:12.330> different<00:01:12.360> chemical

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
combination of two different chemical

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.840 
combination of two different chemical
species<00:01:13.619> and<00:01:13.830> that's<00:01:13.890> exactly<00:01:14.280> what's<00:01:14.640> going

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
species and that's exactly what's going

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.550 
species and that's exactly what's going
on<00:01:15.030> here<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.630> two<00:01:15.810> different<00:01:16.170> chemical

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
on here the two different chemical

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.039 
on here the two different chemical
species<00:01:17.040> are<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.729> Alpha<00:01:18.150> anamur<00:01:18.600> and<00:01:18.810> the

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
species are the Alpha anamur and the

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.320 
species are the Alpha anamur and the
beta<00:01:19.290> anomer<00:01:19.439> that<00:01:20.280> can<00:01:20.460> interconvert<00:01:20.939> with

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
beta anomer that can interconvert with

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.230 
beta anomer that can interconvert with
one<00:01:21.509> another<00:01:21.780> through<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.320> open<00:01:22.770> chain<00:01:23.100> form

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
one another through the open chain form

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.060 
one another through the open chain form
so<00:01:24.240> for<00:01:24.450> example<00:01:24.900> if<00:01:25.080> you<00:01:25.530> were<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:25.680> wonder

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
so for example if you were to wonder

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.660 
so for example if you were to wonder
where<00:01:26.430> that<00:01:26.960> 52.7<00:01:27.960> comes<00:01:28.560> from<00:01:28.860> well<00:01:29.340> it's

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
where that 52.7 comes from well it's

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.249 
where that 52.7 comes from well it's
just<00:01:29.820> an<00:01:30.240> arithmetic<00:01:31.140> on<00:01:31.670> average<00:01:33.110> 36%

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
just an arithmetic on average 36%

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.969 
just an arithmetic on average 36%
x<00:01:35.150> 112<00:01:36.150> which<00:01:36.479> is<00:01:36.659> the<00:01:36.840> value<00:01:37.200> for<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.740> pure

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
x 112 which is the value for the pure

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.780 
x 112 which is the value for the pure
alpha<00:01:38.369> form<00:01:38.700> plus<00:01:39.420> at<00:01:39.810> equilibrium<00:01:40.530> we<00:01:40.680> have

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
alpha form plus at equilibrium we have

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.359 
alpha form plus at equilibrium we have
64<00:01:41.790> percent<00:01:42.270> of<00:01:42.360> the<00:01:43.049> beta<00:01:43.259> form<00:01:43.680> which<00:01:44.130> has<00:01:44.159> a

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
64 percent of the beta form which has a

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.569 
64 percent of the beta form which has a
value<00:01:44.700> of<00:01:44.880> eighteen<00:01:45.540> point<00:01:45.899> seven<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.439> so<00:01:47.040> the

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
value of eighteen point seven and so the

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.399 
value of eighteen point seven and so the
arithmetic<00:01:47.850> average<00:01:48.360> of<00:01:48.750> those<00:01:48.960> numbers

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
arithmetic average of those numbers

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.340 
arithmetic average of those numbers
gives<00:01:50.009> you<00:01:50.250> fifty<00:01:51.210> two<00:01:51.390> point<00:01:51.689> seven<00:01:52.170> percent

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
gives you fifty two point seven percent

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.260 
gives you fifty two point seven percent
and<00:01:52.770> so<00:01:52.920> starting<00:01:53.310> from<00:01:53.430> either<00:01:53.670> pure<00:01:54.060> alpha

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
and so starting from either pure alpha

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.850 
and so starting from either pure alpha
or<00:01:54.840> pure<00:01:55.200> beta<00:01:55.409> we<00:01:56.040> end<00:01:56.250> up<00:01:56.430> with<00:01:56.700> a<00:01:56.939> value<00:01:57.450> of

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
or pure beta we end up with a value of

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.010 
or pure beta we end up with a value of
52<00:01:58.860> point<00:01:59.310> 7<00:01:59.729> because<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.060> equilibrium

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
52 point 7 because the equilibrium

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.410 
52 point 7 because the equilibrium
mixture<00:02:01.560> will<00:02:01.829> be<00:02:01.979> the<00:02:02.130> same<00:02:02.369> regardless<00:02:02.850> of

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
mixture will be the same regardless of

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:04.819 
mixture will be the same regardless of
where<00:02:03.750> we<00:02:03.930> started<00:02:04.200> from

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
where we started from

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.770 
where we started from
we<00:02:05.490> want<00:02:05.670> to<00:02:05.729> look<00:02:05.820> at<00:02:05.939> the<00:02:06.030> mechanism<00:02:06.630> in

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
we want to look at the mechanism in

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.749 
we want to look at the mechanism in
three<00:02:07.020> dimensions<00:02:07.530> what's<00:02:08.039> going<00:02:08.369> on<00:02:08.520> here

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
three dimensions what's going on here

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.360 
three dimensions what's going on here
basically<00:02:08.970> is<00:02:09.479> we've<00:02:09.690> interconverted<00:02:10.709> the

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
basically is we've interconverted the

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.430 
basically is we've interconverted the
an<00:02:11.459> America<00:02:11.879> Doxil<00:02:12.569> group<00:02:12.780> in<00:02:12.959> the<00:02:13.049> axial

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
an America Doxil group in the axial

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.800 
an America Doxil group in the axial
alpha<00:02:13.980> position<00:02:14.519> into<00:02:15.150> the<00:02:15.180> beta<00:02:15.510> position

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
alpha position into the beta position

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.289 
alpha position into the beta position
and<00:02:16.319> it's<00:02:16.890> going<00:02:17.129> to<00:02:17.280> involve<00:02:17.580> this<00:02:17.909> open

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:18.299 
and it's going to involve this open

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:20.449 
and it's going to involve this open
chain<00:02:18.540> form<00:02:18.569> so<00:02:19.170> let's<00:02:19.379> take<00:02:19.590> a<00:02:19.620> look<00:02:19.920> at<00:02:20.159> the

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
chain form so let's take a look at the

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:23.000 
chain form so let's take a look at the
details<00:02:20.909> of<00:02:21.150> the<00:02:21.269> mechanism<00:02:21.739> basically<00:02:22.739> we'll

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
details of the mechanism basically we'll

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.580 
details of the mechanism basically we'll
follow<00:02:23.670> a<00:02:23.790> process<00:02:24.360> that<00:02:24.569> can<00:02:24.750> either<00:02:25.080> involve

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
follow a process that can either involve

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.399 
follow a process that can either involve
the<00:02:26.190> cleavage<00:02:26.670> of<00:02:26.879> the<00:02:26.970> bond<00:02:27.480> within<00:02:27.840> the<00:02:28.200> ring

00:02:28.399 --> 00:02:28.409 
the cleavage of the bond within the ring

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:30.440 
the cleavage of the bond within the ring
that's<00:02:28.890> going<00:02:29.159> to<00:02:29.250> be<00:02:29.370> the<00:02:29.519> endo<00:02:29.909> cyclic

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
that's going to be the endo cyclic

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.750 
that's going to be the endo cyclic
cleavage<00:02:31.110> pathway<00:02:31.620> or<00:02:32.040> it<00:02:32.190> could<00:02:32.340> involve

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
cleavage pathway or it could involve

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.360 
cleavage pathway or it could involve
cleavage<00:02:33.360> of<00:02:33.599> the<00:02:33.750> hydroxyl<00:02:34.409> group<00:02:34.470> carbon

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
cleavage of the hydroxyl group carbon

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.580 
cleavage of the hydroxyl group carbon
oxygen<00:02:35.700> bond<00:02:36.090> on<00:02:36.299> the<00:02:36.659> outside<00:02:37.110> of<00:02:37.319> the<00:02:37.409> ring

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
oxygen bond on the outside of the ring

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.319 
oxygen bond on the outside of the ring
and<00:02:37.769> that<00:02:37.799> will<00:02:37.950> be<00:02:38.010> the<00:02:38.099> EXO<00:02:38.489> cyclic<00:02:38.909> pathway

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:39.329 
and that will be the EXO cyclic pathway

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:41.509 
and that will be the EXO cyclic pathway
and<00:02:39.510> we'll<00:02:39.930> begin<00:02:40.110> there<00:02:40.470> and<00:02:40.709> the<00:02:40.860> key<00:02:41.190> word

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
and we'll begin there and the key word

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:45.009 
and we'll begin there and the key word
to<00:02:41.819> write<00:02:42.030> down<00:02:42.269> in<00:02:42.620> both<00:02:43.620> cases<00:02:44.160> is<00:02:44.609> the

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
to write down in both cases is the

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:46.670 
to write down in both cases is the
intermediate<00:02:46.019> that's<00:02:46.230> known<00:02:46.470> as<00:02:46.500> the

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
intermediate that's known as the

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.490 
intermediate that's known as the
oxocarbenium<00:02:47.329> ion<00:02:48.329> intermediate<00:02:48.599> so<00:02:49.349> let's

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
oxocarbenium ion intermediate so let's

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.740 
oxocarbenium ion intermediate so let's
take<00:02:49.650> a<00:02:49.709> look<00:02:49.890> at<00:02:50.010> what<00:02:50.340> the<00:02:50.489> oxocarbenium<00:02:50.940> ion

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
take a look at what the oxocarbenium ion

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.020 
take a look at what the oxocarbenium ion
intermediate<00:02:52.019> is<00:02:52.500> basically<00:02:53.430> we're<00:02:53.609> going<00:02:53.790> to

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
intermediate is basically we're going to

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:55.729 
intermediate is basically we're going to
protonate<00:02:54.480> the<00:02:54.720> hydroxyl<00:02:55.319> group<00:02:55.379> at<00:02:55.650> the

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
protonate the hydroxyl group at the

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.680 
protonate the hydroxyl group at the
anomeric<00:02:55.980> position<00:02:56.220> so<00:02:56.879> we<00:02:57.030> can<00:02:57.180> set<00:02:57.390> up<00:02:57.540> a

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
anomeric position so we can set up a

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.289 
anomeric position so we can set up a
good<00:02:57.989> leaving<00:02:58.230> group<00:02:58.590> then<00:02:59.250> we're<00:03:00.060> going<00:03:00.239> to

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
good leaving group then we're going to

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:02.750 
good leaving group then we're going to

this up in this mechanism up in a
slightly<00:03:42.870> different<00:03:43.019> way<00:03:43.470> had<00:03:43.919> we<00:03:44.099> protonated

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
slightly different way had we protonated

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.939 
slightly different way had we protonated
the<00:03:44.879> oxygen<00:03:45.569> in<00:03:45.810> the<00:03:45.959> ring<00:03:46.169> we<00:03:46.739> would<00:03:46.889> have

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:46.949 
the oxygen in the ring we would have

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:49.970 
the oxygen in the ring we would have
ended<00:03:47.310> up<00:03:47.400> with<00:03:47.459> a<00:03:48.260> an<00:03:49.260> intermediate<00:03:49.859> that

ended up with a an intermediate that

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.129 
ended up with a an intermediate that
looks<00:03:50.190> like<00:03:50.340> this<00:03:50.730> that<00:03:51.000> intermediate<00:03:51.870> would

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:52.139 
looks like this that intermediate would

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:54.530 
looks like this that intermediate would
then<00:03:52.349> go<00:03:52.530> on<00:03:52.560> and<00:03:52.980> do<00:03:53.220> the<00:03:53.579> a<00:03:53.790> beta<00:03:54.209> elimination

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
then go on and do the a beta elimination

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.110 
then go on and do the a beta elimination
lone<00:03:55.169> pair<00:03:55.470> assisted<00:03:56.040> and<00:03:56.220> now<00:03:56.579> what<00:03:56.819> we<00:03:56.940> need

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:57.120 
lone pair assisted and now what we need

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.170 
lone pair assisted and now what we need
to<00:03:57.299> do<00:03:57.449> is<00:03:57.690> to<00:03:58.260> generate<00:03:58.739> to<00:03:59.310> change<00:03:59.639> the<00:03:59.910> phase

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
to do is to generate to change the phase

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:03.020 
to do is to generate to change the phase
by<00:04:00.599> doing<00:04:00.930> a<00:04:01.019> bond<00:04:01.260> rotation<00:04:01.889> about<00:04:02.129> that<00:04:02.190> bond

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
by doing a bond rotation about that bond

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.199 
by doing a bond rotation about that bond
and<00:04:03.299> show<00:04:04.049> the<00:04:04.260> opposite<00:04:04.769> phase<00:04:05.069> so<00:04:05.430> that<00:04:05.609> the

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
and show the opposite phase so that the

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:09.110 
and show the opposite phase so that the
hydroxyl<00:04:07.019> group<00:04:07.400> can<00:04:08.400> add<00:04:08.639> into<00:04:09.090> that

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:09.120 
hydroxyl group can add into that

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.809 
hydroxyl group can add into that
polarized<00:04:09.930> PI<00:04:10.349> bond<00:04:10.650> on<00:04:10.919> the<00:04:11.069> opposite<00:04:11.609> side

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:11.819 
polarized PI bond on the opposite side

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:14.300 
polarized PI bond on the opposite side
from<00:04:11.849> which<00:04:12.299> the<00:04:12.540> cleavage<00:04:12.959> took<00:04:13.199> place<00:04:13.440> now

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:14.310 
from which the cleavage took place now

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:17.060 
from which the cleavage took place now
the<00:04:14.370> new<00:04:14.730> carbon<00:04:15.180> oxygen<00:04:15.540> bond<00:04:15.930> is<00:04:16.169> set<00:04:16.859> up<00:04:17.039> to

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
the new carbon oxygen bond is set up to

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.659 
the new carbon oxygen bond is set up to
be<00:04:17.310> in<00:04:17.699> the<00:04:18.329> beta<00:04:19.260> position<00:04:19.950> and<00:04:20.159> so<00:04:20.489> we've

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
be in the beta position and so we've

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:21.909 
be in the beta position and so we've
generated<00:04:21.150> the<00:04:21.419> beta

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 
generated the beta

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:24.290 
generated the beta
those<00:04:22.919> are<00:04:23.100> two<00:04:23.250> different<00:04:23.400> mechanisms<00:04:23.700> by

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
those are two different mechanisms by

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.780 
those are two different mechanisms by
which<00:04:24.330> the<00:04:24.930> mutarotation<00:04:25.340> process<00:04:26.340> can<00:04:26.760> take

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
which the mutarotation process can take

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.210 
which the mutarotation process can take
place
