 at the same time 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.760

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.930
 how fast it is to access and find 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:55.240

00:06:23.279 --> 00:06:26.429
 Click or on the desktop to make the start menu disappear 

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:32.430
 then in this session 

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:34.380
 to review we have seen 

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:38.090

 they are no longer programs but they would be 

00:07:06.590 --> 00:07:07.990
