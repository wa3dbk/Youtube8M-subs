 practically all Venezuela expected 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.590
 because several or a large part of what is 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:47.180
 the community knew that we had 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:49.030

 many things but tell a little what 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:03.170
 was what finally happened and why 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.360
 even if they were fired and others 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.610
 renouncing therefore this material should 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.290

 madeline juan if you can explain me a 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:16.070
 little bit 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:18.930
 well we are the technical team that was 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:21.600
 fired from the case of Jesus and my 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.640
 person we renounce before a 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.540
 series of events that were unleashed 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.970
 just that Thursday the 27th when that 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.700
 event occurs at approximately 3 o'clock 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.740
 the afternoon of this Thursday 27 in the 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.630
 Maracaibo municipality creates a great 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.210
 confrontation between what are unique 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.350
 armed groups against national guard and 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:45.180
 the inhabitants of residence for the jma 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:48.090
 immediately 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.340
 goes to the residential complex 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.660
 to do what are the shots in train 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.790
 of globovision we have a 

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:55.950
 internal communication process always 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.320
 we communicate where we are going when 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.670
 we move when we get to the site the 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.370
 situation that is being lived in the 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.990
 movement we even upload photos in 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.360
 those reports so that it is also 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.250
 posted on the channel's website and 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.970
 can be updated the information of 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.090
 way and 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.440
 while this one is in the place of the 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.790
 events 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.040
 that day all that 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.460
 procedure by Jesus who 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.290
 made several announcements 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:24.450
 immediately this also communicated 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:27.060
 they received an immediate response a 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.770
 monkey copied an understanding that 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.820
 obviously it gives us as 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:34.950
 reporters the indication that those 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.050
 Information is passing your stay 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.870
 in receiving therefore over clean 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:44.250
 In addition, those emails indicated that 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:47.160
 we had a team in regeneration at 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.720
 soul in the place and that previously 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.910
 we had not been able to interest 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.310
 by the circumstances of the 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:55.560
 confrontation that was waving 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.209
 there of the situation that happened in 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.430
 paraguay we got to arrive for we have 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.320
 a team here and we want to know how to understand 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:08.410
 that we were going to have the images that 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:10.810
 we could transmit them well not but yes 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:14.260
 to be able to transmit because there was no greater 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:16.900
 interest there were no majors there was no greater 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.090
 interest then now here is a 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.350
 question are we going to do concrete if what 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.840
 I do like the international audience 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.700
 I could have been watching the guard 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.320
 Bolivarian national and I'm watching 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:29.530
 superimpose the video please and I'm 

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:31.870
 watching civilians without shirt 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.610
 some with their faces covered this is not 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.610
 the case this is the entry of a 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.840
 authority with young people but good 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:42.960
 This is the video I'm talking about 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:47.170
 and good we see civilians but for you 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:48.940
 they could be collective because of where 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:52.330
 you draw that these civilians are 

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:54.790
 groups that are not defined or nothing 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:57.420
 more like civilians that accompany the 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.420
 Bolivarian National Guard 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:01.870
 the way of acting fernando here in 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:04.870
 venezuela the collective difference in a 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:07.540
 group that carries a common purpose that 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:09.550
 identify among them good either by 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:11.260
 the activity that they are going to carry out 

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:13.600
 some are armed groups others not 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:16.780
 they are but it is the way they 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:18.940
 they arrived left directly to enter 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.880
 violently the residence had 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:24.160
 passed as previous day in residences 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.200
 the cují and wall of residence resort 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:29.230
 had also taken place in 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:32.080
 ether towers and saladillo era is a series 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:34.660
 in an operandi that was happening in 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.250
 every residential point that showed 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.470
 some kind of resistance like you 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.960
 says here in venezuela before what they are 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.610
 the different manifestations that 

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.980
 they were holding here in 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:46.810
 residence for lyman but it was pretty 

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:50.050
 numerous besides 

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:52.060
 they came in other opportunities and 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:55.330
 Then came the agencies of 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:57.730
 however , all of them 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:00.040
 they arrived directly throwing stones 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:02.889
 they came at once also saying 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:05.009
 in some other way the custodian or of 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:10.080
 some other way also put 

00:05:05.009 --> 00:05:12.449
 what would Madeline be and how much is there 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.649
 have to pause to go back and I'm going 

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:14.849
 to leave a question on the table as 

00:05:13.649 --> 00:05:16.319
 I usually do it 

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:19.469
 the question I leave on the table is the 

00:05:16.319 --> 00:05:21.689
 next because necessarily think 

00:05:19.469 --> 00:05:24.479
 that are collective and not only 

00:05:21.689 --> 00:05:26.399
 civilians in collaboration with the guard 

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:28.770
 Bolivarian national what implications 

00:05:26.399 --> 00:05:30.149
 have this so that our 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:32.699
 international agency pause 

00:05:30.149 --> 00:05:34.619
