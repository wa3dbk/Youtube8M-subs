00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:26.269
 today to teach to do a regatta you 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:37.719
 will need a very elastic fabric 

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:37.719
 seagrass type cotton scissors pin 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:01:06.560
 lower to mark the fabric has to 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:11.270
 Finding a dry soap can be 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:16.150
 useful first of all 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:16.150
 you will have to take and pass the fabric 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:28.380
 this procedure of passing the tissue is 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:32.729
 very important because you can also wash 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:35.790
 I had enough clothes before 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:39.840
 when you wash or pass fabric 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:42.540
 before cutting and making it shrink that 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:02:23.150
 important tissue food process 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:02:23.150
 that at this time it is important to position 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:42.989
 well and had in the legal body 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:47.880
 So we'll leave the little bitch pretty soft. 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:51.330
 nothing to keep pulling the same 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:53.760
 thing you're going to pull the door to a fabric 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:57.080
 elastic has to work with a lot of 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.080
 very careful
