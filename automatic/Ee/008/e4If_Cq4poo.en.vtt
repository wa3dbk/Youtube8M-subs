00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 hi everyone I 'm roots and in this 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.250
 video I'm going to show you a new 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.649
 minigame I 've made for the main 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.290
 craft oct edition in which it is about 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:13.259
 the split mode which if not the 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.990
 you know it's about several players with 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.359
 shovels that destroy the blocks of 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.720
 below the opponent to knock him down 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:25.260
 and so fall into the void and win the one that 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:28.140
 stay in the sand and good here 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.599
 we also have another modality that I have 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.719
 put in case they do not have to play in a 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.670
 local server with your friends or with 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.410
 known I have the modality of a 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.649
 player which is about going 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.809
 knocking down blocks without you falling 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:46.770
 empty because there are as you can see there 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:50.500
 columns of 2 and 3 of sand but without 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:54.160
 But it ends and columns of 1 nothing more 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:56.650
 when they are updated, they fall into a vacuum and 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.290
 try to destroy as much of 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:02.020
 sand without falling into vacuum so a 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:04.960
 small modality designed for those 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:07.720
 that they can not play with other people and 

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.630
 well now let's see the modality of 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.600
 two players 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.960
 the two or four players start 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.270
 standing on these platforms 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:22.590
 start and then when everyone is 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:25.320
 ready destroy the sand and if it reaches 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.880
 have some this someone who does not 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.950
 destroyed the sand as you can see it 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.799
 starts a chain reaction that pulls 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:34.649
 the four players and then you can already 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:37.590
 start the game and as you can see is a 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:40.200
 normal split in which we are removing 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:45.200
 the blocks here I do not have demonstration 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:49.399
 with another player but it's about that 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:52.549
 so well I hope you like this map 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:55.460
 of split if they have any modification 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:57.979
 they want him to do to the map 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.289
 you can ask for it in the comments and 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:02.509
 also if they have any suggestions of 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:04.880
 another type of map made for the main 

00:02:02.509 --> 00:02:08.030
 craft pocket edition can do it 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.890
 also so right now I'm giving 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.920
 account you can use the balls of 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:15.950
 level to throw the opponents but not 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.380
 do that so good that's been all 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:21.380
 for this video the download link is 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:25.030
