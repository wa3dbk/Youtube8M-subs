00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.200
 hello everyone today I bring you a trick to 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:20.570
 tell you 2 multiplayer and good is for 

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.279
 download one of the games 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.110
 modified we said ok to be able 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:25.130
 leave the maps so good at what 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:27.169
 What do we have to do? 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.810
 tve when we count that we go down 

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:31.340
 the community and we go into the more 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.380
 popular when we enter the 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.060
 macular we have to go down to games 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.220
 custom 

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.810
 and here you will see some of the games 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.640
 some are modified others are not worth 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:42.440
 are to take the flag and have to 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.000
 put efe klich or something like that is worth the 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.250
 new that there is similar to what had 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.260
 with the dragon fire here you have a here 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.090
 you have another so good you will have it 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.770
 around here the most popular the coges 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.450
 you give it if it's worth it and we will not have 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:56.030
 charged 

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:58.040
 now we could play but not 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.870
 have to always do the same thing so 

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.550
 what are we going to do is save it, we're going 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.410
 to edit the rules of the game and 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.699
 just when we give it below we 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:06.800
 it puts that we press the x equals vale for 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.840
 save it on the play would be squared and 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.609
 well we keep it not 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.140
 once it's saved it's worth not 

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:14.479
 have to always do the same every 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.880
 time we want to play is worth another day or 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:18.579
 something like that what we have to do 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.409
 we go to custom games 

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:23.000
 configuration of the game and change 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:24.170
 game mode to read and when we change 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.509
 game then we give to where it puts 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.770
 saved and the game is no longer valid 

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:29.959
 we simply have to load it already 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.100
 is we would start playing vale os 

00:01:29.959 --> 00:01:33.829
 I recommend that you always put the 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.959
 team or is it worth because then at 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:37.670
 change equipment you will see if it is not 

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:40.310
 a roll theirs that always or 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.649
 you start being signal worth between each other is 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.149
 Once you get a weapon before the end of the 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:45.560
 countdown you change equipment you take 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:48.229
 which you want is worth in this case with 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.759
 the audi team and I take a gun and I appear 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:51.709
 the weapon leaves water ship but good not 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:53.299
 nothing happens, no, that's not the trick that is not 

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:55.429
 is the trick worth 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:57.259
 we have changed seal equipment and before 

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:59.659
 start, but always start from 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:01.099
 He signs what we do now 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:02.299
 would be the following we are not going to 

00:02:01.099 --> 00:02:04.489
 any corner any place in 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:06.319
 this case and I come here what we have 

00:02:04.489 --> 00:02:07.759
 what to do is press the start we change 

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:10.879
 of equipment and we're going to be again 

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:12.410
 we choose weapon does not reappear mos we give 

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:13.459
 again at pause we change equipment and 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.510
 we go again to the team that 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.430
 we were 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.019
 I take a gun and I give the X to 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.239
 reappear and as you can see either 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:22.549
 out is this is the new system that 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:24.170
 there are now we can do it in upload like this 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:26.060
 in buildings and that we can also leave 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.310
 of the maps by simply pulling the 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.470
 end of the typical map not the end of the 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.150
 map not that the limit goes out is not the 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.099
 typical fence or whatever 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.420
 we catch we jump against the fence 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:37.430
 just when we hit the fence 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.799
 we do the same bone process 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.349
 we take click the start we change 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:43.760
 we go to the team seal does not reappear mos and 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:44.959
 then we change through teams 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.640
 we go back to the team where we were 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:48.560
 ok and we will surely be out of the 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.060
 map voucher can be made from the two 

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.680
 ways or to climb buildings or to 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.840
 leave the map so good simply 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.129
 is this I hope that I have served you 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.420
