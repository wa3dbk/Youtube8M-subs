00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
all right so we begin this project guys

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.410 
all right so we begin this project guys
by<00:00:03.540> me<00:00:03.720> just<00:00:04.110> cotton<00:00:04.500> this<00:00:05.220> four<00:00:05.940> piece<00:00:06.180> of

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
by me just cotton this four piece of

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.810 
by me just cotton this four piece of
wood<00:00:06.600> that<00:00:06.629> I<00:00:06.870> glued<00:00:07.140> together<00:00:07.290> oak<00:00:07.919> on<00:00:08.580> the

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
wood that I glued together oak on the

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:09.589 
wood that I glued together oak on the
table<00:00:09.210> saw

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:09.599 
table saw

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.810 
table saw
now<00:00:10.110> my<00:00:10.290> blade<00:00:10.530> isn't<00:00:10.740> big<00:00:10.980> enough<00:00:11.099> to<00:00:11.400> culture

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
now my blade isn't big enough to culture

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.419 
now my blade isn't big enough to culture
and<00:00:12.120> one<00:00:12.300> stroke<00:00:12.630> so<00:00:13.320> I<00:00:13.349> did<00:00:13.620> as<00:00:13.710> I<00:00:13.860> thought<00:00:14.099> as

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
and one stroke so I did as I thought as

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.660 
and one stroke so I did as I thought as
deep<00:00:14.730> as<00:00:14.940> I<00:00:15.059> can<00:00:15.089> and<00:00:15.870> flip<00:00:16.199> it<00:00:16.230> over<00:00:16.470> line<00:00:17.369> up

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
deep as I can and flip it over line up

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.400 
deep as I can and flip it over line up
with<00:00:17.850> the<00:00:17.940> crosscut<00:00:18.210> sled<00:00:18.570> and<00:00:18.900> then<00:00:19.170> take

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
with the crosscut sled and then take

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.099 
with the crosscut sled and then take
another<00:00:19.590> slice<00:00:20.570> after<00:00:21.570> I<00:00:21.630> meant<00:00:21.840> to<00:00:22.020> the

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
another slice after I meant to the

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.320 
another slice after I meant to the
underlay<00:00:22.590> and<00:00:23.369> then<00:00:23.519> start<00:00:23.820> using<00:00:24.090> my

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
underlay and then start using my

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.480 
underlay and then start using my
roughing<00:00:24.779> gouge<00:00:24.810> it<00:00:25.380> will<00:00:25.560> fit<00:00:25.769> the<00:00:25.949> shape<00:00:26.220> and

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
roughing gouge it will fit the shape and

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:37.990 
roughing gouge it will fit the shape and
just<00:00:26.730> get<00:00:27.000> it<00:00:27.150> nice<00:00:27.480> and<00:00:27.539> red

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.000

marinara<00:00:39.000> all<00:00:39.480> my<00:00:39.840> woodturning<00:00:40.380> projects

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
marinara all my woodturning projects

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.340 
marinara all my woodturning projects
actually<00:00:41.190> stick<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:41.820> just<00:00:41.970> treat<00:00:42.360> would<00:00:43.080> turn

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
actually stick to just treat would turn

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.760 
actually stick to just treat would turn
in<00:00:43.500> cheese's<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.670> part<00:00:44.970> engage<00:00:45.530> the<00:00:46.530> part

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
in cheese's the part engage the part

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.820 
in cheese's the part engage the part
code<00:00:47.010> sorry<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:48.330> roughing<00:00:49.080> gouge<00:00:49.110> and<00:00:49.650> the

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:49.830 
code sorry the roughing gouge and the

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:51.860 
code sorry the roughing gouge and the
ball<00:00:50.010> gauge<00:00:50.309> and<00:00:50.610> I<00:00:50.760> find<00:00:51.090> this<00:00:51.270> does<00:00:51.570> most

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
ball gauge and I find this does most

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.070 
ball gauge and I find this does most
projects<00:00:52.500> for<00:00:52.680> me<00:00:52.800> so<00:00:53.670> I'm<00:00:53.820> just<00:00:54.000> making<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:54.870> few

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:55.080 
projects for me so I'm just making a few

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.320 
projects for me so I'm just making a few
indications<00:00:55.590> using<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.400> part<00:00:56.670> engage<00:00:56.970> here

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:57.330 
indications using the part engage here

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:59.240 
indications using the part engage here
just<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.140> show<00:00:58.350> where<00:00:58.559> it<00:00:58.620> starts<00:00:59.129> and

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
just to show where it starts and

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.910 
just to show where it starts and
finishes<00:00:59.570> and<00:01:00.570> them<00:01:00.900> using<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.440> bowl<00:01:01.620> gouge

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
finishes and them using the bowl gouge

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.359 
finishes and them using the bowl gouge
to<00:01:02.340> go<00:01:02.519> ahead<00:01:02.580> to<00:01:02.940> shape<00:01:03.180> I<00:01:03.390> want<00:01:03.629> this<00:01:04.559> project

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
to go ahead to shape I want this project

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.040 
to go ahead to shape I want this project
is<00:01:05.489> actually<00:01:05.640> great<00:01:06.000> for<00:01:06.030> just<00:01:06.360> practice<00:01:06.869> in

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:07.050 
is actually great for just practice in

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.170 
is actually great for just practice in
your<00:01:07.200> lathe<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:08.070> getting<00:01:08.369> used<00:01:08.580> to<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.910> tools

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
your lathe and getting used to the tools

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.450 
your lathe and getting used to the tools
and<00:01:09.479> you<00:01:09.570> can<00:01:09.600> redo<00:01:10.050> whatever<00:01:10.350> freeform<00:01:11.160> shape

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
and you can redo whatever freeform shape

00:01:11.460 --> 00:02:06.480 
and you can redo whatever freeform shape
you<00:01:11.640> want

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
pick up some of the wood chips from when

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.449 
pick up some of the wood chips from when
I<00:02:28.300> was<00:02:28.510> turning<00:02:28.780> I'm<00:02:29.530> rest<00:02:29.800> honor<00:02:30.130> and<00:02:30.340> that

00:02:30.449 --> 00:02:30.459 
I was turning I'm rest honor and that

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:33.150 
I was turning I'm rest honor and that
goes<00:02:30.640> like<00:02:30.670> a<00:02:30.850> sheen<00:02:31.239> to<00:02:31.270> the<00:02:31.660> wood<00:02:32.010> so<00:02:33.010> the

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
goes like a sheen to the wood so the

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.340 
goes like a sheen to the wood so the
finish<00:02:33.520> on<00:02:33.730> playing<00:02:34.150> is<00:02:34.510> just<00:02:34.780> the<00:02:34.930> usual

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
finish on playing is just the usual

finish on playing is just the usual
blood<00:02:35.620> Lindsey<00:02:36.130> own<00:02:36.250> beeswax<00:02:36.940> mix<00:02:37.330> so<00:02:38.200> just

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
blood Lindsey own beeswax mix so just

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.800 
blood Lindsey own beeswax mix so just
apply<00:02:38.709> it<00:02:38.739> on<00:02:38.920> with<00:02:39.190> a<00:02:39.220> paper<00:02:39.459> towel<00:02:39.820> and<00:02:40.120> I<00:02:40.630> use

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
apply it on with a paper towel and I use

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.300 
apply it on with a paper towel and I use
paper<00:02:41.050> towels<00:02:41.410> because<00:02:41.560> that<00:02:41.860> way<00:02:42.010> if<00:02:42.160> the

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
paper towels because that way if the

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:45.600 
paper towels because that way if the
wood<00:02:42.519> grabs<00:02:42.880> onto<00:02:43.180> it<00:02:43.480> it<00:02:44.230> won't<00:02:44.500> catch<00:02:45.130> rate

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
wood grabs onto it it won't catch rate

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.400 
wood grabs onto it it won't catch rate
and<00:02:45.910> I<00:02:46.090> know<00:02:46.150> just<00:02:46.480> ripped<00:02:46.750> so<00:02:47.080> it's<00:02:47.230> quite

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
and I know just ripped so it's quite

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:50.550 
and I know just ripped so it's quite
safe<00:02:48.150> afterwards<00:02:49.150> I<00:02:49.390> just<00:02:49.420> buffer<00:02:50.110> a<00:02:50.290> new

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
safe afterwards I just buffer a new

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.580 
safe afterwards I just buffer a new

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:15.610 
for this so the way I caught a circle is

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:19.080 
for this so the way I caught a circle is
I<00:03:16.300> screw<00:03:16.900> on<00:03:17.080> one<00:03:17.680> denizens<00:03:18.190> groan<00:03:18.490> ah<00:03:18.580> he<00:03:18.880> said

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.090 
I screw on one denizens groan ah he said

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:22.350 
I screw on one denizens groan ah he said
oak<00:03:19.240> on<00:03:19.630> to<00:03:19.840> my<00:03:19.990> crosscut<00:03:20.680> sled<00:03:20.830> and<00:03:21.250> I<00:03:22.150> get

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.360 
oak on to my crosscut sled and I get

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:25.470 
oak on to my crosscut sled and I get
that's<00:03:22.900> a<00:03:23.050> square<00:03:23.530> of<00:03:23.560> the<00:03:24.000> diameter<00:03:25.000> that<00:03:25.450> I

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
that's a square of the diameter that I

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:28.680 
that's a square of the diameter that I
want<00:03:25.810> to<00:03:26.500> the<00:03:26.680> finish<00:03:27.070> diameter<00:03:27.610> is<00:03:27.760> the<00:03:28.420> width

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 
want to the finish diameter is the width

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:32.070 
want to the finish diameter is the width
and<00:03:29.020> length<00:03:29.350> of<00:03:29.830> the<00:03:30.040> square<00:03:30.510> so<00:03:31.510> I<00:03:31.540> just<00:03:31.870> begin

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080 
and length of the square so I just begin

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.620 
and length of the square so I just begin
by<00:03:32.290> cutting<00:03:32.560> off<00:03:32.800> all<00:03:33.040> the<00:03:33.250> sharp<00:03:33.520> corners<00:03:34.150> and

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
by cutting off all the sharp corners and

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:37.440 
by cutting off all the sharp corners and
then<00:03:35.170> cut<00:03:35.710> all<00:03:35.800> the<00:03:36.010> finer<00:03:36.340> corners<00:03:37.000> and<00:03:37.210> then

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
then cut all the finer corners and then

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.140 
then cut all the finer corners and then
eventually<00:03:37.840> what<00:03:38.290> I<00:03:38.320> do<00:03:38.470> is<00:03:38.920> actually<00:03:39.490> hold<00:03:39.970> a

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
eventually what I do is actually hold a

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.180 
eventually what I do is actually hold a
piece<00:03:40.390> of<00:03:40.570> wood<00:03:40.750> and<00:03:40.990> twisted<00:03:41.860> around<00:03:42.100> the

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.190 
piece of wood and twisted around the

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.000 
piece of wood and twisted around the
blade<00:03:42.430> and<00:03:42.820> that<00:03:43.000> makes<00:03:43.750> it<00:03:43.900> a<00:03:43.960> perfect<00:03:44.290> circle

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
blade and that makes it a perfect circle

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.730 
blade and that makes it a perfect circle
now<00:03:45.850> in<00:03:46.090> this<00:03:46.270> shot<00:03:46.570> guys<00:03:46.870> it<00:03:47.170> looks<00:03:47.200> like<00:03:47.470> my

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:47.740 
now in this shot guys it looks like my

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:50.400 
now in this shot guys it looks like my
hands<00:03:48.010> are<00:03:48.220> really<00:03:48.670> close<00:03:49.180> to<00:03:49.450> the<00:03:49.510> plate<00:03:49.720> like

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410 
hands are really close to the plate like

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.170 
hands are really close to the plate like
you<00:03:50.590> guarantee<00:03:51.070> it<00:03:51.100> or<00:03:51.370> not<00:03:51.550> there's<00:03:51.850> still<00:03:51.940> at

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
you guarantee it or not there's still at

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.690 
you guarantee it or not there's still at
least<00:03:52.210> three<00:03:52.750> inches<00:03:53.020> which<00:03:53.890> obviously<00:03:54.520> if

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:54.700 
least three inches which obviously if

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.730 
least three inches which obviously if
you<00:03:54.850> are<00:03:54.970> between<00:03:55.210> a<00:03:55.330> fence<00:03:55.720> would<00:03:56.200> be<00:03:56.380> quite

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:56.740 
you are between a fence would be quite

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:59.730 
you are between a fence would be quite
dangerous<00:03:57.120> so<00:03:58.120> I'm<00:03:58.690> not<00:03:58.960> gonna<00:03:59.170> recommend
