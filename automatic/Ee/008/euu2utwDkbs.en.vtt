00:00:04.029 --> 00:00:08.029
 hi all told all these readings 

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:10.309
 fast and today we savor a 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:14.270
 new video on ten is a movie that 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:16.880
 2.0 and I have a little advance video gold 

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:20.630
 as you can as you can 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:24.800
 see I did and I'm available 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:29.240
 if all that I do not know if it 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:32.060
 worth it if you find it is pretty 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.440
 good I think that 's okay it's hard 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:36.560
 well 

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:40.010
 myself I even put a parking lot up 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:41.990
 and not the last episode I forgot 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:47.150
 to show you that's what I did at 

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:52.100
 beginning it is to say at the bottom the 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:53.820
 sewers that's why I started 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.530
 what's that 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.430
 it's a bouquet of flowers hockey and 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.430
 functions invest 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.400
 okay 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:10.140
 that's noisy 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.890
 so that's how you can see and 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.890
 sewers 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.820
 with 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.370
 I really did not do a lot 

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:24.030
 big between you can like you 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:24.030
 can see it 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:38.090
 that's where it normally limits 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.110
 so yes I did a little ellipses 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.930
 because it did not do like 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:53.330
 louis may the end believe you that 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:55.250
 that's it and so here I hope it 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:58.130
 So go I was telling us 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:00.680
 explain that for every house that 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:04.210
 seemed like that here assured the same 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:05.890
 terror you would take the same door for 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:08.690
 for that 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:11.180
 and yes I did as with 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.390
 lifts there are several small 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:17.209
 tables on in this episode 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:23.140
 I counted it's m but to limit it 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:23.140
 their little things to arrange it 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.209
 he 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:05.710
 so here I have echoed just not so 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:11.319
 you have noticed 

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:14.310
 much less spend and 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:14.310
 here 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.480
 g 

00:05:52.889 --> 00:06:01.500
 it's slow because it's just the 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:03.180
 face time so 

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:05.370
 see you next time for a new video 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:06.110
