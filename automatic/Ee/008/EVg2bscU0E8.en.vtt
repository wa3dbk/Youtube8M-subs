00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:15.170

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:18.070
 video a boxing of this exterior that I 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:20.240
 I just bought it is an advance of 140 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:23.750
 Well, the truth is that it made me very 

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:28.210
 good exterior so let's see what it is 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:28.210
 which contains the product itself 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:36.350
 well we see that first of all we have these 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.960
 cables that is the harness that is connected 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:40.730
 behind the studio to go connected already 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.660
 studies that our 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:48.620
 power cable to the kitchens and the 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:51.410
 remote and everything works fine 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.899
 also has these two accessories 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.449
 which are to be able to remove your stereo 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:59.420
 Every time you want to remove it, they are 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:01.879
 special for this model and there with 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.649
 some screws also for when 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:05.449
 we want to fix to the place of assembly that 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:07.010
 we wish we will see what else 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:10.130
 they have 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.960
 well let's continue here is a 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:15.290
 little tight so I'm going to cut this 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:17.780
 the video to teach taken out everything that 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:20.750
 had inside has what is a manual 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.910
 operating manual user in 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.950
 and apparently printed version here 

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:31.070
 also an album so that you can 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:35.170
 the computer running and I'm 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:39.130
 here we also have what is the manual 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:41.450
 and here is the story 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:45.010
 Here's the first thing you wrote that 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.010
 a stereo has this type d 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.420
 packing or protector could be 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:50.649
 say that he is very curious the first thing is 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:52.630
 that then in a stereo as I say 

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:55.130
 It seems that it can be removed very easy as well 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:59.040
 what are we gonna see 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:02.120
 if it's so easy for the space hand 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.120
 but get us 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:13.360

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.130

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.140

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:21.569

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:23.489

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:25.620

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:28.499

00:02:28.499 --> 00:02:34.590

00:02:31.499 --> 00:02:37.079

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.599

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:42.370
 what is the harness that made it possible to 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:46.330
 sant pere of radio input 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:48.450
 here just a framework to put it where 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.390
 let's ride it 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.940

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:56.519
