hello and welcome to another episode on
evolution<00:00:02.790> today<00:00:03.750> we<00:00:03.929> are<00:00:03.990> going<00:00:04.080> to<00:00:04.170> be

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
evolution today we are going to be

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:05.150 
evolution today we are going to be
talking<00:00:04.440> about<00:00:04.650> the<00:00:04.830> difference<00:00:05.100> between

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:05.160 
talking about the difference between

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.130 
talking about the difference between
natural<00:00:05.879> selection<00:00:06.390> and<00:00:06.509> artificial

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
natural selection and artificial

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.900 
natural selection and artificial
selection<00:00:07.379> when<00:00:08.250> talking<00:00:08.519> about<00:00:08.670> the

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
selection when talking about the

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:10.820 
selection when talking about the
difference<00:00:09.210> between<00:00:09.540> natural<00:00:09.750> selection<00:00:10.620> and

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
difference between natural selection and

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.410 
difference between natural selection and
artificial<00:00:11.370> selection<00:00:11.460> is<00:00:11.910> important<00:00:12.360> to

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:12.420 
artificial selection is important to

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:13.520 
artificial selection is important to
know<00:00:12.599> the<00:00:12.809> difference<00:00:13.080> between<00:00:13.200> the<00:00:13.380> two

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
know the difference between the two

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.070 
know the difference between the two
words<00:00:13.679> natural<00:00:14.219> artificial<00:00:14.929> natural<00:00:15.929> is

words natural artificial natural is

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.660 
words natural artificial natural is
something<00:00:16.410> that<00:00:16.529> is<00:00:16.619> made<00:00:16.770> by<00:00:16.949> nature<00:00:17.369> such<00:00:17.640> as

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
something that is made by nature such as

something that is made by nature such as
this<00:00:17.940> forest<00:00:18.510> whereas<00:00:19.020> artificial<00:00:19.770> is

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
evolution means change over time so

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.009 
evolution means change over time so
we're<00:00:26.789> looking<00:00:27.180> at<00:00:27.359> things<00:00:27.779> that<00:00:27.960> have

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
we're looking at things that have

look at things that have changed

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:32.690 
look at things that have changed
naturally<00:00:31.170> over<00:00:31.410> time<00:00:31.650> and<00:00:31.949> we<00:00:32.369> are<00:00:32.430> going<00:00:32.610> to

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
naturally over time and we are going to

look at things that have changed

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.900 
look at things that have changed
artificially<00:00:34.440> over<00:00:34.680> time<00:00:34.890> or<00:00:35.160> change<00:00:35.430> because

artificially over time or change because

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.330 
artificially over time or change because
of<00:00:36.090> humans<00:00:36.630> so<00:00:36.899> in<00:00:37.410> order<00:00:37.620> to<00:00:37.800> look<00:00:38.070> through

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
of humans so in order to look through

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.530 
of humans so in order to look through
these<00:00:38.489> two<00:00:38.700> things<00:00:39.000> we're<00:00:39.180> going<00:00:39.329> to<00:00:39.360> do<00:00:39.510> a

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
these two things we're going to do a

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.319 
these two things we're going to do a
little<00:00:39.719> thought<00:00:40.050> experiment<00:00:40.790> one<00:00:41.790> example<00:00:42.090> we

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
little thought experiment one example we

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.600 
little thought experiment one example we
could<00:00:42.420> use<00:00:42.629> is<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:42.930> Cougar<00:00:43.430> imagine<00:00:44.430> one

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
could use is the Cougar imagine one

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.369 
could use is the Cougar imagine one
cougar<00:00:44.969> that<00:00:45.000> is<00:00:45.239> very<00:00:45.450> sharp<00:00:45.780> teeth<00:00:46.050> and

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
cougar that is very sharp teeth and

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.139 
cougar that is very sharp teeth and
imagine<00:00:47.129> another<00:00:47.340> cougar<00:00:47.700> that<00:00:47.730> has<00:00:47.940> very

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
imagine another cougar that has very

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.250 
imagine another cougar that has very
dull<00:00:48.480> teeth<00:00:48.840> dhol<00:00:49.530> means<00:00:49.920> not<00:00:50.370> very<00:00:50.940> sharp<00:00:51.570> my

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
dull teeth dhol means not very sharp my

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.170 
dull teeth dhol means not very sharp my
question<00:00:52.800> to<00:00:52.949> you<00:00:53.070> is<00:00:53.100> which<00:00:53.430> cougar<00:00:53.910> do<00:00:54.090> you

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
question to you is which cougar do you

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.600 
question to you is which cougar do you
think<00:00:54.449> would<00:00:54.600> survive<00:00:54.960> better<00:00:55.520> obviously<00:00:56.520> in

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
think would survive better obviously in

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.010 
think would survive better obviously in
this<00:00:56.760> case<00:00:56.820> the<00:00:57.210> Cougar<00:00:57.480> with<00:00:57.629> the<00:00:57.750> sharp

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
this case the Cougar with the sharp

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.900 
this case the Cougar with the sharp
teeth<00:00:58.230> would<00:00:58.440> probably<00:00:58.980> survive<00:00:59.340> better<00:00:59.640> than

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
teeth would probably survive better than

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.660 
teeth would probably survive better than
Cougars<00:01:00.300> with<00:01:00.480> dull<00:01:00.750> teeth<00:01:01.230> so<00:01:02.010> in<00:01:02.190> this<00:01:02.340> case

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
Cougars with dull teeth so in this case

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.060 
Cougars with dull teeth so in this case
Nature<00:01:03.570> has<00:01:03.719> made<00:01:03.899> the<00:01:04.080> decision<00:01:04.229> as<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:04.769> which

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
Nature has made the decision as to which

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.340 
Nature has made the decision as to which
animal<00:01:05.580> will<00:01:05.700> survive<00:01:05.970> better<00:01:06.240> it<00:01:06.600> was<00:01:06.990> not<00:01:07.140> up

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
animal will survive better it was not up

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.929 
animal will survive better it was not up
to<00:01:07.380> humans<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:07.979> decide<00:01:08.280> which<00:01:08.460> cougar<00:01:08.790> would

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
to humans to decide which cougar would

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.450 
to humans to decide which cougar would
survive<00:01:09.270> rather<00:01:09.960> nature<00:01:10.650> decided<00:01:10.979> based<00:01:11.280> on

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
survive rather nature decided based on

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.399 
survive rather nature decided based on
the<00:01:11.520> sharpness<00:01:11.880> of<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.330> Cougars<00:01:12.659> teeth<00:01:13.049> and

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
the sharpness of the Cougars teeth and

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.499 
the sharpness of the Cougars teeth and
when<00:01:14.040> nature<00:01:14.220> decides<00:01:14.760> it's<00:01:15.060> called<00:01:15.270> natural

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
when nature decides it's called natural

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.690 
when nature decides it's called natural
selection<00:01:16.380> because<00:01:16.470> Nature<00:01:17.130> has<00:01:17.310> done<00:01:17.520> the

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
selection because Nature has done the

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
humans were deciding which Cougars get

humans were deciding which Cougars get
to<00:01:24.180> survive<00:01:24.509> we<00:01:25.140> probably<00:01:25.500> wouldn't<00:01:25.950> decide

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
to survive we probably wouldn't decide

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.679 
to survive we probably wouldn't decide
based<00:01:26.580> on<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:26.790> sharpness<00:01:27.060> of<00:01:27.270> their<00:01:27.420> teeth

based on the sharpness of their teeth
rather<00:01:28.350> humans<00:01:28.890> have<00:01:29.040> a<00:01:29.070> tendency<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.549> choose

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
rather humans have a tendency to choose

rather humans have a tendency to choose
things<00:01:30.150> based<00:01:30.450> on<00:01:30.659> cuteness<00:01:31.380> let's<00:01:32.130> say<00:01:32.310> one

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
things based on cuteness let's say one

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.640 
things based on cuteness let's say one
cougar<00:01:32.970> is<00:01:33.060> really<00:01:33.360> cute<00:01:33.630> and<00:01:33.840> one<00:01:34.140> cougar<00:01:34.530> was

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
cougar is really cute and one cougar was

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.219 
cougar is really cute and one cougar was
really<00:01:34.979> not<00:01:35.340> cute<00:01:35.909> in<00:01:36.090> reality<00:01:36.570> humans<00:01:37.140> have

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
really not cute in reality humans have

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:38.870 
really not cute in reality humans have
always<00:01:37.380> chosen<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:38.009> animals<00:01:38.340> that<00:01:38.460> are<00:01:38.610> cute

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
always chosen the animals that are cute

of Cougar is cute and that is where we

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.740 
of Cougar is cute and that is where we
