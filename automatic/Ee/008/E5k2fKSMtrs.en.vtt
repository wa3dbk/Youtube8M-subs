00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.389 

in<00:00:00.780> this<00:00:01.469> clip<00:00:01.740> we're<00:00:01.860> going<00:00:01.890> to<00:00:02.010> be<00:00:02.070> talking

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:02.399 
in this clip we're going to be talking

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:05.050 
in this clip we're going to be talking
about<00:00:02.460> controlling<00:00:03.090> volume<00:00:03.300> on<00:00:04.200> a<00:00:04.259> Hammond

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:05.060 
about controlling volume on a Hammond

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.760 
about controlling volume on a Hammond
the<00:00:06.060> the<00:00:06.540> very<00:00:06.779> first<00:00:06.839> thing<00:00:07.379> and<00:00:07.529> the<00:00:07.589> most

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
the the very first thing and the most

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.879 
the the very first thing and the most
obvious<00:00:08.280> thing<00:00:08.490> is<00:00:08.670> the<00:00:08.700> volume<00:00:09.090> pedal<00:00:09.889> this

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
obvious thing is the volume pedal this

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.589 
obvious thing is the volume pedal this
this<00:00:11.550> pedal<00:00:11.880> works<00:00:12.090> just<00:00:12.360> like<00:00:12.420> an

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
this pedal works just like an

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.629 
this pedal works just like an
accelerator<00:00:13.110> the<00:00:13.530> further<00:00:13.799> down<00:00:14.040> you<00:00:14.250> push<00:00:14.460> it

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
accelerator the further down you push it

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.689 
accelerator the further down you push it
the<00:00:14.820> latter<00:00:15.480> it<00:00:15.690> gets<00:00:15.900> so<00:00:16.379> you<00:00:17.190> just<00:00:17.369> use<00:00:17.550> this

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
the latter it gets so you just use this

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:25.990 
the latter it gets so you just use this
for<00:00:17.910> basic<00:00:18.240> swells

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:26.000 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.640 

that's<00:00:27.000> your<00:00:27.180> first<00:00:27.360> method<00:00:27.840> of<00:00:27.960> a<00:00:27.990> volume

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
that's your first method of a volume

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.810 
that's your first method of a volume
control<00:00:30.050> pretty<00:00:31.050> simple<00:00:31.410> now<00:00:32.310> a<00:00:32.340> volume<00:00:32.790> pedal

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
control pretty simple now a volume pedal

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.940 
control pretty simple now a volume pedal
is<00:00:33.270> not<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.600> only<00:00:33.780> way<00:00:34.110> to<00:00:34.140> control<00:00:34.590> volume

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
is not the only way to control volume

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.740 
is not the only way to control volume
and<00:00:35.309> really<00:00:35.700> if<00:00:35.820> you<00:00:35.940> want<00:00:36.090> to<00:00:36.150> be<00:00:36.210> smart<00:00:36.570> about

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
and really if you want to be smart about

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.920 
and really if you want to be smart about
making<00:00:37.530> your<00:00:37.620> sounds<00:00:38.040> blend<00:00:38.370> you'll<00:00:39.360> use<00:00:39.750> the

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
making your sounds blend you'll use the

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.240 
making your sounds blend you'll use the
second<00:00:40.290> technique<00:00:40.470> as<00:00:40.710> well<00:00:40.860> which<00:00:41.070> is<00:00:41.220> really

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
second technique as well which is really

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.660 
second technique as well which is really
each<00:00:42.000> one<00:00:42.330> of<00:00:42.449> these<00:00:42.830> drawbars<00:00:43.830> is<00:00:44.100> a<00:00:44.129> volume

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
each one of these drawbars is a volume

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.299 
each one of these drawbars is a volume
for<00:00:45.390> that<00:00:45.600> particular<00:00:46.110> drawbar<00:00:46.590> right<00:00:46.980> so

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
for that particular drawbar right so

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.549 
for that particular drawbar right so
when<00:00:48.000> you're<00:00:48.210> when<00:00:48.750> you're<00:00:48.780> rocking<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.290> the

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
when you're when you're rocking the the

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:56.720 
when you're when you're rocking the the
big<00:00:49.739> low<00:00:50.010> stuff<00:00:50.809> you<00:00:51.809> know<00:00:55.309> but<00:00:56.309> you<00:00:56.460> want<00:00:56.640> it

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
big low stuff you know but you want it

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.060 
big low stuff you know but you want it
all<00:00:56.850> so<00:00:57.120> we'll<00:00:57.840> go<00:00:57.960> back<00:00:58.110> to<00:00:58.230> this<00:00:58.350> preset<00:00:58.829> so

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
all so we'll go back to this preset so

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.959 
all so we'll go back to this preset so
you<00:00:59.130> can<00:00:59.370> you<00:01:00.329> also<00:01:00.480> want<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:00.720> have<00:01:00.780> a<00:01:00.899> high

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:01.969 
you can you also want to have a high

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:06.530 
you can you also want to have a high
kind<00:01:02.969> of<00:01:03.030> quiet<00:01:03.450> sounding<00:01:05.180> let's<00:01:06.180> make<00:01:06.390> it<00:01:06.420> a

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
kind of quiet sounding let's make it a

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.700 
kind of quiet sounding let's make it a
little<00:01:06.660> bit

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.050 

say<00:01:10.710> so<00:01:10.770> you<00:01:11.039> want<00:01:11.249> to<00:01:11.310> use<00:01:11.429> those<00:01:11.609> two<00:01:11.789> sounds

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
say so you want to use those two sounds

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.940 
say so you want to use those two sounds
together<00:01:14.240> obviously<00:01:15.240> this<00:01:16.079> is<00:01:16.229> way<00:01:16.649> louder

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
together obviously this is way louder

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.649 
together obviously this is way louder
than<00:01:17.159> this<00:01:17.399> is<00:01:17.579> right<00:01:17.789> now<00:01:17.969> but<00:01:18.149> you<00:01:18.270> need<00:01:18.479> to

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
than this is right now but you need to

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.029 
than this is right now but you need to
you<00:01:18.810> know<00:01:18.929> you<00:01:18.990> want<00:01:19.469> it<00:01:19.530> to<00:01:19.649> get<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.859> right

00:01:20.029 --> 00:01:20.039 
you know you want it to get the right

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:21.590 
you know you want it to get the right
blend<00:01:20.310> you<00:01:20.579> want<00:01:20.939> you<00:01:21.060> have<00:01:21.240> these<00:01:21.420> guys

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
blend you want you have these guys

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.020 
blend you want you have these guys
further<00:01:21.990> up<00:01:22.200> so<00:01:22.500> you<00:01:23.459> know<00:01:23.549> you<00:01:23.609> pulled<00:01:23.939> these

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
further up so you know you pulled these

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.849 
further up so you know you pulled these
guys<00:01:24.270> up<00:01:24.479> together<00:01:24.659> there<00:01:25.560> get<00:01:25.709> you're<00:01:25.799> gonna

00:01:25.849 --> 00:01:25.859 
guys up together there get you're gonna

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:31.190 
guys up together there get you're gonna
get<00:01:26.069> the<00:01:26.189> same<00:01:26.369> sound<00:01:26.579> just<00:01:26.819> quieter<00:01:27.329> so<00:01:30.200> in

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
get the same sound just quieter so in

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.559 
get the same sound just quieter so in
fact<00:01:31.890> then<00:01:32.099> now<00:01:32.399> this<00:01:32.759> guys<00:01:33.000> these<00:01:33.270> guys<00:01:33.420> are<00:01:33.479> a

00:01:33.559 --> 00:01:33.569 
fact then now this guys these guys are a

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:38.809 
fact then now this guys these guys are a
little<00:01:33.659> bit<00:01:33.869> quiet<00:01:34.079> so<00:01:37.130> so<00:01:38.130> those<00:01:38.310> those<00:01:38.609> two

00:01:38.809 --> 00:01:38.819 
little bit quiet so so those those two

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:40.459 
little bit quiet so so those those two
match<00:01:39.000> up<00:01:39.209> together<00:01:39.359> so<00:01:39.689> really<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.229> volume

00:01:40.459 --> 00:01:40.469 
match up together so really the volume

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:41.690 
match up together so really the volume
control<00:01:40.740> is<00:01:40.859> just<00:01:41.099> as<00:01:41.189> much<00:01:41.369> about<00:01:41.490> the

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
control is just as much about the

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.190 
control is just as much about the
drawbars<00:01:42.239> that<00:01:42.450> you're<00:01:42.569> going<00:01:42.689> to<00:01:42.750> be<00:01:42.840> using

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
drawbars that you're going to be using

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.270 
drawbars that you're going to be using
as<00:01:43.349> it<00:01:43.860> is<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.549> just<00:01:44.879> using<00:01:45.239> the<00:01:45.329> volume<00:01:45.509> pedal

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
as it is the just using the volume pedal

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.469 
as it is the just using the volume pedal
the<00:01:47.280> third<00:01:47.489> way<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:47.700> control<00:01:48.000> volume<00:01:48.329> is

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
the third way to control volume is

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.839 
the third way to control volume is
through<00:01:48.659> this<00:01:48.840> fancy<00:01:49.530> switch<00:01:50.310> called<00:01:50.729> the

00:01:50.839 --> 00:01:50.849 
through this fancy switch called the

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:53.119 
through this fancy switch called the
volume<00:01:51.209> switch<00:01:51.539> it<00:01:51.840> just<00:01:52.439> toddlers<00:01:52.979> you

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:53.129 
volume switch it just toddlers you

00:01:53.129 --> 00:01:54.619 
volume switch it just toddlers you
between<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.819> normal<00:01:54.149> volume<00:01:54.270> which<00:01:54.509> is<00:01:54.539> what

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:54.629 
between the normal volume which is what

00:01:54.629 --> 00:01:56.719 
between the normal volume which is what
I've<00:01:54.869> been<00:01:54.899> playing<00:01:55.229> it<00:01:55.409> and<00:01:55.560> soft<00:01:56.189> volume<00:01:56.579> and

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
I've been playing it and soft volume and

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.240 
I've been playing it and soft volume and
really<00:01:57.450> I<00:01:57.479> would<00:01:57.840> only<00:01:57.989> use<00:01:58.289> this<00:01:58.560> for<00:01:58.619> when

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
really I would only use this for when

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.490 
really I would only use this for when
you're<00:01:59.399> playing<00:02:00.179> by<00:02:00.329> yourself<00:02:00.450> or<00:02:00.989> just

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
you're playing by yourself or just

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.229 
you're playing by yourself or just
practicing<00:02:02.159> or<00:02:02.280> anything<00:02:02.429> like<00:02:02.670> that<00:02:02.729> because

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:03.239 
practicing or anything like that because

00:02:03.239 --> 00:02:04.729 
practicing or anything like that because
you<00:02:03.420> already<00:02:03.450> have<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.780> other<00:02:04.020> controls<00:02:04.500> it's

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:04.739 
you already have the other controls it's

00:02:04.739 --> 00:02:06.289 
you already have the other controls it's
just<00:02:04.979> that<00:02:05.099> just<00:02:05.310> keeps<00:02:05.489> it<00:02:05.609> softer<00:02:06.060> so<00:02:06.270> you
