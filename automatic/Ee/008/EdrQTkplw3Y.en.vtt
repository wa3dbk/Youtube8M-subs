okay<00:02:20.400> so<00:02:20.730> the<00:02:21.660> pattern<00:02:22.170> itself<00:02:22.560> we're<00:02:22.800> gonna

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
okay so the pattern itself we're gonna

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.620 
okay so the pattern itself we're gonna
keep<00:02:23.190> this<00:02:23.370> pattern<00:02:23.760> going<00:02:24.060> throughout<00:02:24.570> the

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
keep this pattern going throughout the

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:30.230 
keep this pattern going throughout the
whole<00:02:24.840> tune<00:02:25.320> so<00:02:25.590> it's<00:02:28.010> and<00:02:29.010> then<00:02:30.000> we<00:02:30.150> would

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
whole tune so it's and then we would

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:38.100 
whole tune so it's and then we would
switch<00:02:30.540> courts<00:02:30.930> OB

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.020 

now<00:02:39.110> I'm<00:02:39.230> gonna<00:02:39.410> go<00:02:39.560> up<00:02:39.830> down<00:02:40.130> when<00:02:40.700> I<00:02:40.730> go<00:02:40.970> to

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
now I'm gonna go up down when I go to

00:02:41.030 --> 00:03:01.000 
now I'm gonna go up down when I go to
the<00:02:41.420> each<00:02:41.660> new<00:02:42.080> chord<00:02:42.500> so<00:02:42.920> we<00:02:43.040> have

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:15.650 

so<00:03:02.010> the<00:03:02.790> the<00:03:03.240> feel<00:03:03.890> is<00:03:14.240> right<00:03:15.240> that's<00:03:15.540> what

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
so the the feel is right that's what

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:16.640 
so the the feel is right that's what
it's<00:03:15.780> gonna<00:03:15.900> sound<00:03:16.140> like<00:03:16.260> if<00:03:16.410> I<00:03:16.470> don't

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
it's gonna sound like if I don't

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:17.840 
it's gonna sound like if I don't
actually<00:03:16.800> play<00:03:17.100> anything<00:03:17.310> now<00:03:17.490> I<00:03:17.520> want<00:03:17.670> to<00:03:17.700> add

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
actually play anything now I want to add

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:31.930 
actually play anything now I want to add
that<00:03:17.880> all<00:03:18.510> together

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.840 

okay<00:03:32.940> so<00:03:33.240> it<00:03:33.390> just<00:03:33.600> repeats<00:03:33.930> that<00:03:34.580> same<00:03:35.580> strong

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
okay so it just repeats that same strong

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.890 
okay so it just repeats that same strong
patterns<00:03:36.209> on<00:03:36.360> each<00:03:36.390> board

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.470 

right<00:03:40.500> and<00:03:40.709> at<00:03:40.830> the<00:03:40.980> end<00:03:41.190> of<00:03:41.489> each<00:03:41.700> verse<00:03:42.120> it's

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
right and at the end of each verse it's

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.570 
right and at the end of each verse it's
gonna<00:03:42.629> hold<00:03:42.930> the<00:03:43.170> F<00:03:43.319> for<00:03:43.709> twice<00:03:43.980> as<00:03:44.010> long<00:03:44.220> so

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:44.580 
gonna hold the F for twice as long so

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:47.180 
gonna hold the F for twice as long so
check<00:03:44.760> it<00:03:44.879> out<00:03:44.970> let's<00:03:45.360> do<00:03:45.599> a<00:03:45.629> verse<00:03:46.140> and<00:03:46.409> then

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
check it out let's do a verse and then

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.500 
check it out let's do a verse and then
we'll<00:03:47.400> say<00:03:47.670> we're<00:03:47.909> going<00:03:48.060> through<00:03:48.209> the<00:03:48.330> course

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
we'll say we're going through the course

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:57.570 
we'll say we're going through the course
okay<00:03:48.810> so

00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:57.580 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:14.470 

course

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.770 

right<00:04:15.480> I<00:04:15.630> think<00:04:15.660> it<00:04:16.020> may<00:04:16.200> cycle<00:04:16.739> through<00:04:17.070> the

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
right I think it may cycle through the

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.410 
right I think it may cycle through the
CG<00:04:18.780> a<00:04:19.080> minor<00:04:19.470> half<00:04:19.770> twice<00:04:20.340> in<00:04:20.640> the<00:04:20.730> course<00:04:21.030> but

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:21.420 
CG a minor half twice in the course but

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:23.180 
CG a minor half twice in the course but
remember<00:04:21.989> that<00:04:22.020> at<00:04:22.290> the<00:04:22.410> end<00:04:22.440> of<00:04:22.860> the<00:04:22.980> each

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
remember that at the end of the each

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.400 
remember that at the end of the each
chorus<00:04:23.670> you're<00:04:24.150> gonna<00:04:24.270> stand<00:04:24.540> that<00:04:24.750> nap<00:04:24.990> twice

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410 
chorus you're gonna stand that nap twice

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.580 
chorus you're gonna stand that nap twice
as<00:04:25.620> long<00:04:25.820> it's<00:04:26.820> gonna<00:04:26.880> go<00:04:27.090> back<00:04:27.390> into<00:04:28.020> the

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:28.590 
as long it's gonna go back into the

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.320 
as long it's gonna go back into the
verse<00:04:28.800> just<00:04:29.190> like<00:04:29.430> the<00:04:29.550> first<00:04:29.760> in<00:04:29.880> the<00:04:29.940> courses

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:30.330 
verse just like the first in the courses

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.720 
verse just like the first in the courses
are<00:04:30.480> the<00:04:30.510> same<00:04:30.840> except<00:04:31.470> for<00:04:31.500> that<00:04:31.770> double<00:04:32.520> left

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:32.730 
are the same except for that double left

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:35.750 
are the same except for that double left
at<00:04:33.000> the<00:04:33.090> end<00:04:33.270> of<00:04:33.510> the<00:04:34.170> actual<00:04:34.650> course<00:04:34.920> now<00:04:35.700> the

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:35.760 
at the end of the actual course now the

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:38.660 
at the end of the actual course now the
only<00:04:35.970> other<00:04:36.150> part<00:04:36.390> in<00:04:36.480> the<00:04:36.570> song<00:04:36.840> is<00:04:37.230> a<00:04:37.800> bridge

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:38.670 
only other part in the song is a bridge

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:40.880 
only other part in the song is a bridge
and<00:04:39.060> it's<00:04:39.390> the<00:04:39.630> same<00:04:39.840> chords<00:04:40.410> but<00:04:40.620> we're<00:04:40.770> just

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:40.890 
and it's the same chords but we're just

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:42.200 
and it's the same chords but we're just
gonna<00:04:40.980> put<00:04:41.160> them<00:04:41.250> in<00:04:41.310> a<00:04:41.400> different<00:04:41.550> order<00:04:41.910> so

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
gonna put them in a different order so

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.130 
gonna put them in a different order so
I'll<00:04:42.630> come<00:04:42.870> out<00:04:43.110> of<00:04:43.490> the<00:04:44.490> chorus<00:04:45.050> there's<00:04:46.050> a

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:46.140 
I'll come out of the chorus there's a

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:47.900 
I'll come out of the chorus there's a
little<00:04:46.410> transition<00:04:46.890> of<00:04:47.160> just<00:04:47.370> one<00:04:47.640> time

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910 
little transition of just one time

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:51.050 
little transition of just one time
through<00:04:48.210> the<00:04:48.300> chords

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.000 

and<00:04:51.150> then<00:04:51.750> it<00:04:51.870> goes<00:04:52.020> into<00:04:52.290> the<00:04:52.440> bridge<00:04:52.680> so<00:04:52.889> I'll

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.010 
and then it goes into the bridge so I'll

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:54.860 
and then it goes into the bridge so I'll
do<00:04:53.190> that<00:04:53.220> transition<00:04:54.030> and<00:04:54.180> then<00:04:54.389> into<00:04:54.750> the

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 
do that transition and then into the

00:04:54.870 --> 00:05:04.360 
do that transition and then into the
bridge<00:04:55.050> check<00:04:55.350> it<00:04:55.440> out<00:04:55.530> here<00:04:55.680> we<00:04:55.740> go

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:04.370 

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:18.429 

rich

00:05:18.429 --> 00:05:18.439 

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:24.879 

and<00:05:18.739> then<00:05:22.779> so<00:05:23.779> all<00:05:23.959> Z<00:05:24.139> did<00:05:24.289> is<00:05:24.409> we<00:05:24.559> stayed<00:05:24.769> on

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:24.889 
and then so all Z did is we stayed on

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:27.529 
and then so all Z did is we stayed on
that<00:05:25.009> F

00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:27.539 

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:34.640 

now<00:05:28.539> we<00:05:28.599> can<00:05:28.960> keep<00:05:29.110> the<00:05:29.289> pattern<00:05:29.500> the<00:05:29.740> same

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:34.650 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:36.719 

right<00:05:35.650> and<00:05:35.860> this<00:05:35.979> one<00:05:36.160> you<00:05:36.220> might<00:05:36.340> have<00:05:36.460> known

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:36.729 
right and this one you might have known

00:05:36.729 --> 00:05:39.900 
right and this one you might have known
actually<00:05:37.300> play<00:05:37.990> an<00:05:38.169> actual<00:05:38.530> G<00:05:38.889> right<00:05:39.490> just<00:05:39.759> it

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:39.910 
actually play an actual G right just it

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:41.309 
actually play an actual G right just it
just<00:05:40.180> to<00:05:40.270> be<00:05:40.360> a<00:05:40.389> little<00:05:40.479> bit<00:05:40.720> different<00:05:41.110> so<00:05:41.229> we

00:05:41.309 --> 00:05:41.319 
just to be a little bit different so we

00:05:41.319 --> 00:05:43.409 
just to be a little bit different so we
could<00:05:41.500> strum<00:05:42.130> it<00:05:42.310> or<00:05:42.430> keep<00:05:42.669> the<00:05:42.789> pattern<00:05:43.090> so<00:05:43.240> if

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:43.419 
could strum it or keep the pattern so if

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:54.059 
could strum it or keep the pattern so if
I<00:05:43.509> strum<00:05:44.080> it<00:05:44.199> it<00:05:44.319> would<00:05:44.410> be<00:05:44.470> more<00:05:44.650> like

00:05:54.059 --> 00:05:54.069 

00:05:54.069 --> 00:05:58.119 

so<00:05:55.069> we<00:05:55.159> go<00:05:55.279> F<00:05:56.199> G

00:05:58.119 --> 00:05:58.129 
so we go F G

00:05:58.129 --> 00:06:02.650 
so we go F G
a<00:05:58.389> minor<00:06:00.189> back<00:06:01.189> to<00:06:01.429> F

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:02.660 
a minor back to F

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:04.900 
a minor back to F
it<00:06:03.020> stays<00:06:03.260> on<00:06:03.470> F<00:06:03.680> okay<00:06:04.070> and<00:06:04.370> then<00:06:04.550> goes<00:06:04.700> back

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:04.910 
it stays on F okay and then goes back

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:06.520 
it stays on F okay and then goes back
into<00:06:05.150> the<00:06:05.210> verse<00:06:05.360> so<00:06:05.690> again<00:06:06.140> one<00:06:06.350> more<00:06:06.470> time
