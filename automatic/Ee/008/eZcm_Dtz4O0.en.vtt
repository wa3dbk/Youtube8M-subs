00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:03.770 

this<00:00:01.979> is<00:00:02.159> the<00:00:02.310> first<00:00:02.580> question<00:00:03.090> of<00:00:03.240> pipes<00:00:03.510> and

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
this is the first question of pipes and

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:07.660 
this is the first question of pipes and
systems<00:00:04.230> that<00:00:04.470> we<00:00:04.950> are<00:00:05.069> going<00:00:05.310> to<00:00:05.520> solve<00:00:06.210> okay

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:07.670 
systems that we are going to solve okay

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.900 
systems that we are going to solve okay
so<00:00:08.670> what<00:00:08.820> does<00:00:09.030> it<00:00:09.059> indicate<00:00:09.389> in<00:00:10.110> fact<00:00:10.910> it

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
so what does it indicate in fact it

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.670 
so what does it indicate in fact it
indicates<00:00:12.480> that<00:00:13.849> there<00:00:14.849> is<00:00:14.940> a<00:00:15.000> tank<00:00:15.299> and<00:00:15.680> there

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
indicates that there is a tank and there

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.510 
indicates that there is a tank and there
are<00:00:16.800> two<00:00:17.100> pipes<00:00:17.490> as<00:00:17.990> they<00:00:18.990> let<00:00:19.199> the<00:00:19.980> first<00:00:20.250> one

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
are two pipes as they let the first one

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.420 
are two pipes as they let the first one
and<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:21.150> second<00:00:21.539> one<00:00:21.600> okay<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.859> first<00:00:23.130> one<00:00:23.400> is

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
and the second one okay the first one is

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.000 
and the second one okay the first one is
ceiling<00:00:23.910> of<00:00:24.029> the<00:00:24.150> tank<00:00:24.449> in<00:00:24.900> five<00:00:25.470> hours<00:00:25.680> and

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
ceiling of the tank in five hours and

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.040 
ceiling of the tank in five hours and
the<00:00:26.369> second<00:00:26.760> one<00:00:26.910> is<00:00:27.029> filling<00:00:27.359> up<00:00:27.449> the<00:00:27.599> tank<00:00:27.810> in

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
the second one is filling up the tank in

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.830 
the second one is filling up the tank in
10<00:00:28.260> hours<00:00:28.439> so<00:00:29.250> what<00:00:29.789> we<00:00:29.970> have<00:00:30.210> to<00:00:30.240> find<00:00:30.599> out

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
10 hours so what we have to find out

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.010 
10 hours so what we have to find out
here<00:00:31.140> that<00:00:31.740> in<00:00:31.980> how<00:00:32.309> many<00:00:32.369> hours<00:00:32.700> is<00:00:33.480> both<00:00:33.989> the

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
here that in how many hours is both the

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.720 
here that in how many hours is both the
pipes<00:00:34.469> are<00:00:36.739> filling<00:00:37.739> of<00:00:37.920> the<00:00:37.980> tank<00:00:38.370> together

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
pipes are filling of the tank together

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.080 
pipes are filling of the tank together
in<00:00:39.300> how<00:00:39.989> many<00:00:40.020> hours<00:00:40.350> will<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:40.980> tank<00:00:41.219> be<00:00:41.430> full

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
in how many hours will the tank be full

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.279 
in how many hours will the tank be full
right<00:00:42.870> so<00:00:43.879> for<00:00:44.879> this<00:00:45.059> in<00:00:45.329> the<00:00:45.750> previous<00:00:45.960> video

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
right so for this in the previous video

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.770 
right so for this in the previous video
that<00:00:46.559> I<00:00:46.770> had<00:00:47.100> discussed<00:00:47.520> that<00:00:48.170> if<00:00:49.170> a<00:00:50.329> tank<00:00:51.329> gets

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
that I had discussed that if a tank gets

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.420 
that I had discussed that if a tank gets
filled<00:00:52.110> in<00:00:52.309> exhales<00:00:53.309> right<00:00:54.530> then<00:00:55.530> in<00:00:55.829> one<00:00:56.190> hour

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
filled in exhales right then in one hour

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.900 
filled in exhales right then in one hour
what<00:00:57.059> part<00:00:57.390> of<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.660> tank<00:00:57.930> will<00:00:58.500> be<00:00:58.649> filled<00:00:58.920> so

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
what part of the tank will be filled so

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.110 
what part of the tank will be filled so
here<00:01:00.270> on<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:01.260> same<00:01:01.500> principle<00:01:01.739> we<00:01:02.730> will<00:01:02.910> solve

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
here on the same principle we will solve

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.190 
here on the same principle we will solve
the<00:01:03.270> question<00:01:03.690> in<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.769> complete<00:01:05.549> tank<00:01:06.200> by

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
the question in the complete tank by

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.609 
the question in the complete tank by
pipe<00:01:07.470> one<00:01:07.830> is<00:01:08.729> getting<00:01:09.630> filled<00:01:10.080> in<00:01:10.229> five<00:01:10.439> hours

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
pipe one is getting filled in five hours

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:22.010 
pipe one is getting filled in five hours
so<00:01:11.189> in<00:01:11.369> one<00:01:11.640> hour<00:01:12.619> one<00:01:13.619> hour

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.130 

bye-bye

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.270 

a<00:01:25.640> ok<00:01:26.870> what<00:01:27.870> part<00:01:27.900> of<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.470> Tang<00:01:28.920> will<00:01:29.159> be

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
a ok what part of the Tang will be

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.730 
a ok what part of the Tang will be
filled<00:01:29.520> one<00:01:30.090> by<00:01:30.740> five<00:01:31.740> right<00:01:32.750> because<00:01:33.750> in<00:01:33.960> five

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
filled one by five right because in five

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.520 
filled one by five right because in five
hours<00:01:34.950> it<00:01:35.220> is<00:01:35.250> filling<00:01:35.670> up<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:35.970> complete<00:01:36.930> tank

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
hours it is filling up the complete tank

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:46.830 
hours it is filling up the complete tank
okay<00:01:38.159> and<00:01:38.540> by<00:01:39.540> pipe<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:40.460> buy<00:01:44.060> 52

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
okay and by pipe to buy 52

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:53.219 
okay and by pipe to buy 52
it<00:01:47.380> will<00:01:47.649> be<00:01:48.090> 1<00:01:49.090> by<00:01:50.250> 10<00:01:51.250> right<00:01:51.820> because<00:01:52.329> second

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
it will be 1 by 10 right because second

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:54.899 
it will be 1 by 10 right because second
pipe<00:01:53.380> is<00:01:53.590> filling<00:01:53.859> up<00:01:53.950> the<00:01:54.100> complete<00:01:54.460> tank<00:01:54.729> in

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:54.909 
pipe is filling up the complete tank in

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:58.160 
pipe is filling up the complete tank in
10<00:01:55.450> hours<00:01:55.630> so<00:01:56.259> in<00:01:56.380> one<00:01:56.590> hour<00:01:56.740> it<00:01:56.950> will<00:01:57.069> fill<00:01:57.340> the

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
10 hours so in one hour it will fill the

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.520 
10 hours so in one hour it will fill the
tank<00:01:59.170> as<00:01:59.409> 1<00:01:59.920> by<00:01:59.950> 10<00:02:00.490> part<00:02:00.850> poking<00:02:01.780> if<00:02:02.020> both<00:02:02.409> the

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
tank as 1 by 10 part poking if both the

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.959 
tank as 1 by 10 part poking if both the
pipes<00:02:02.770> are<00:02:03.009> opened<00:02:03.789> together<00:02:04.229> then<00:02:05.939> what<00:02:06.939> is

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:06.969 
pipes are opened together then what is

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:09.990 
pipes are opened together then what is
the<00:02:07.270> feeling<00:02:07.479> of<00:02:07.810> the<00:02:07.959> tank<00:02:08.259> by<00:02:09.039> part<00:02:09.340> in<00:02:09.580> one

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:10.000 
the feeling of the tank by part in one

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:18.400 
the feeling of the tank by part in one
are<00:02:10.239> it<00:02:10.989> will<00:02:11.170> be<00:02:11.349> added<00:02:12.239> by<00:02:13.239> both<00:02:13.540> pipes

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:25.680 

is<00:02:18.920> equal<00:02:19.430> to<00:02:19.610> 1<00:02:19.880> by<00:02:20.150> 5<00:02:20.870> plus<00:02:21.380> 1<00:02:21.800> by<00:02:21.830> 10<00:02:22.820> right<00:02:24.310> so

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
is equal to 1 by 5 plus 1 by 10 right so

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:32.410 
is equal to 1 by 5 plus 1 by 10 right so
is<00:02:26.690> equal<00:02:27.140> to<00:02:27.320> 3<00:02:27.800> by<00:02:28.070> 10<00:02:28.970> okay<00:02:30.640> so<00:02:31.640> three<00:02:31.850> by<00:02:32.090> 10

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
is equal to 3 by 10 okay so three by 10

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.010 
is equal to 3 by 10 okay so three by 10
part<00:02:33.080> will<00:02:33.320> be<00:02:33.350> filled<00:02:34.130> up<00:02:34.250> in<00:02:34.460> one<00:02:34.880> are<00:02:35.120> ok<00:02:35.840> so

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
part will be filled up in one are ok so

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.420 
part will be filled up in one are ok so
the<00:02:36.650> complete<00:02:37.160> tank<00:02:37.690> complete<00:02:38.690> Tang<00:02:38.960> will<00:02:39.200> be

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
the complete tank complete Tang will be

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:47.380 
the complete tank complete Tang will be
filled<00:02:40.430> up<00:02:42.040> complete<00:02:43.040> tank<00:02:43.840> is<00:02:44.890> equal<00:02:45.890> to<00:02:46.100> 1<00:02:47.030> by

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
filled up complete tank is equal to 1 by

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:54.820 
filled up complete tank is equal to 1 by
3<00:02:47.840> by<00:02:48.250> 10<00:02:49.510> so<00:02:50.510> 1<00:02:50.960> by<00:02:50.990> 3<00:02:51.410> x<00:02:51.650> 10<00:02:53.440> so<00:02:54.440> the<00:02:54.560> time<00:02:54.800> taken

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
3 by 10 so 1 by 3 x 10 so the time taken
