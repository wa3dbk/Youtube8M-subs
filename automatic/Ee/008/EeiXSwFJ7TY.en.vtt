00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:06.690 
got age is almost the same only four

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.780 
got age is almost the same only four
years<00:00:06.930> separating<00:00:07.500> the<00:00:07.589> two<00:00:07.799> and<00:00:08.040> the<00:00:08.550> weight

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
years separating the two and the weight

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.730 
years separating the two and the weight
the<00:00:09.179> weight<00:00:09.360> is<00:00:09.510> the<00:00:09.540> factor<00:00:09.990> here<00:00:10.230> and<00:00:10.380> also

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
the weight is the factor here and also

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.980 
the weight is the factor here and also
more<00:00:11.010> so<00:00:11.250> the<00:00:11.429> experience<00:00:11.969> endows<00:00:12.570> got<00:00:12.780> two

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
more so the experience endows got two

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.200 
more so the experience endows got two
years<00:00:13.230> experience<00:00:13.860> where<00:00:14.070> Saito's<00:00:14.610> got<00:00:14.849> six

years experience where Saito's got six
the<00:00:15.780> bigger<00:00:15.960> girls<00:00:16.260> got<00:00:16.440> less<00:00:16.590> experience<00:00:17.160> the

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
the bigger girls got less experience the

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.560 
the bigger girls got less experience the
smaller<00:00:17.580> girls<00:00:17.880> got<00:00:18.090> more<00:00:18.270> experience

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
smaller girls got more experience

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.240 
smaller girls got more experience
they've<00:00:19.020> both<00:00:19.260> been<00:00:19.320> trained<00:00:19.830> in<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.070> same
