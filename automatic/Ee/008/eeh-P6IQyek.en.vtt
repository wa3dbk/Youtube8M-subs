00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:06.920
 Rescuing an abandoned light, fleeing from lies and suspicion 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.280
 You will find the truth that is still holding firmly 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.780
 In the hands of the night 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.300
 The air of the twilight keeps the game of shadows, dances boldly and slides further 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:37.760
 Waiting and thinking, will I ever see the truth that you hold? 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:44.020
 Climbing the walls you make and reciting your name, but you keep them all away 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.720
 Hiding all the ways you want to scream and scream 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.600
 Why could not you just rely on me? 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.760
 He is boiling up and down, a heart that I will never know 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.260
 Steal your stout eyes, pass by the lies, and see the real me 

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.640
 Brave but lying, scared and crying when I lost my way? 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:09.400
 Because the only thing I believed was a long time ago 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:10.780
 So say yes 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:16.040
 The world cheats shadows, say I'm just full of lies 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:21.320
 Listen when I say, "Just take my hand," believe me you can 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.860
 You will not ever see me run, no, nothing scares me anymore 

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:32.620
 Do not turn your eyes, you'll be okay, leave your worries behind 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.320
 "One day they will pay for this!" 

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.480
 He's echoing the story or being destined to be, you see this is our destiny 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.080
 Wait a little longer and I'll let you see the secret I kept 

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.280
 It grows even darker every day, can not you see what's on the road? 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.840
 All your yellow memories are red and sweet 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.240
 But it will be until you start to bleed 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:11.300
 I want to protect you from the world I know 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.820
 I'm occupying the position again, letting it finish and blasting this fate 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.980
 I'm struggling until I flood, I'm next to you, know that I will never give up 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.820
 Because the only thing I believed was gone without a trace 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.260
 So say yes 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.400
 The world turns against you, say there is no one on your side 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.640
 Listen when I say "You're not alone," catch it tomorrow 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:44.340
 You will never see me run, no, nothing shakes me anymore 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:50.100
 Scenarios stuck in rewinding, I'll be ready to fight 

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:55.560
 "I bet if I told her I loved her, she would answer with 'I and you too!'" 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.060
 "Stupid bitch" 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.920
 "You fooled her! I do not want to see you near her, do you understand ?!" 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.960
 "Hey, she was stupid enough to trust me!" 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.180
 "How could I have been so stupid?" 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:27.120
 Say everyone is against you, say no one is on your side 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.020
 Listen when I say, "Just take my hand," believe me you can 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.360
 You will always be next to me, now that I know what is true, I will fight 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:43.140
 Through every scene and every life, with these hands of the night 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:51.380
 Say that we know the answer, tell us that we have heard her all her life 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:04:00.720
 You will never see me running, no, nothing scares me anymore 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.040
 I'll be ready to fight
