now<00:00:07.860> here<00:00:08.130> are<00:00:08.160> some<00:00:08.400> of<00:00:08.550> the<00:00:08.610> health<00:00:08.820> benefits

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
now here are some of the health benefits

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.009 
now here are some of the health benefits
of

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
of

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.370 
of
it's<00:00:10.110> just<00:00:10.379> to<00:00:10.499> add<00:00:10.679> them<00:00:10.950> to<00:00:11.129> our

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:11.380 
it's just to add them to our

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.890 
it's just to add them to our
first<00:00:12.250> of<00:00:12.460> all<00:00:12.580> they<00:00:12.970> have<00:00:13.150> very<00:00:13.390> little<00:00:13.570> fat

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:13.900 
first of all they have very little fat

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.950 
first of all they have very little fat
and<00:00:14.320> no<00:00:14.890> cholesterol<00:00:15.450> so<00:00:16.450> that<00:00:16.690> they're

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:16.960 
and no cholesterol so that they're

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.130 
and no cholesterol so that they're
wonderful<00:00:17.560> as<00:00:17.710> far<00:00:17.950> as<00:00:18.100> dieting<00:00:18.580> goes<00:00:18.790> the

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
wonderful as far as dieting goes the

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.200 
wonderful as far as dieting goes the
amount<00:00:20.140> of<00:00:20.230> fiber<00:00:20.529> is<00:00:20.980> phenomenal<00:00:21.760> so<00:00:22.029> there

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:22.210 
amount of fiber is phenomenal so there

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:24.570 
amount of fiber is phenomenal so there
is<00:00:22.360> a<00:00:22.390> lot<00:00:22.510> of<00:00:22.720> fiber<00:00:23.200> and<00:00:23.439> mushrooms<00:00:23.980> that's

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:24.580 
is a lot of fiber and mushrooms that's

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.000 
is a lot of fiber and mushrooms that's
why<00:00:24.880> most<00:00:25.150> of<00:00:25.360> them<00:00:25.480> have<00:00:25.660> to<00:00:25.750> be<00:00:25.869> cooked<00:00:26.140> you

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:27.010 
why most of them have to be cooked you

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:29.269 
why most of them have to be cooked you
may<00:00:27.220> know<00:00:27.460> that<00:00:27.640> mushrooms<00:00:28.150> is<00:00:28.360> one<00:00:28.570> of<00:00:28.689> the

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
may know that mushrooms is one of the

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.540 
may know that mushrooms is one of the
structural<00:00:30.279> polymers<00:00:31.050> there<00:00:32.050> is<00:00:32.470> a<00:00:33.250> lot<00:00:33.520> of

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:33.550 
structural polymers there is a lot of

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.389 
structural polymers there is a lot of
chitin<00:00:34.120> and<00:00:34.270> chitin<00:00:35.079> is<00:00:35.260> the<00:00:35.470> top<00:00:35.860> amino

00:00:36.389 --> 00:00:36.399 
chitin and chitin is the top amino

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:39.000 
chitin and chitin is the top amino
polymer<00:00:36.970> that's<00:00:37.210> found<00:00:37.450> in<00:00:37.720> crabs<00:00:38.110> crab

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:42.700 
shells and other arthropods so that's

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.420

cellulose<00:00:50.230> and<00:00:50.560> lignin<00:00:51.510> is<00:00:52.510> are<00:00:52.900> also<00:00:53.200> found

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:53.590 
cellulose and lignin is are also found

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:55.680 
cellulose and lignin is are also found
in<00:00:53.800> mushrooms<00:00:54.310> but<00:00:54.460> all<00:00:54.640> of<00:00:54.760> these<00:00:54.910> are<00:00:55.180> very

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:55.690 
in mushrooms but all of these are very

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.630 
in mushrooms but all of these are very
undigestible<00:00:56.440> to<00:00:56.680> us<00:00:56.830> unless<00:00:57.040> they're<00:00:57.340> cooked
