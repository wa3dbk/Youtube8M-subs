00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:09.750
 welcome from my world minutes evil 2 days 7 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.599
 if I tell you how to make bombs in 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:15.450
 Maykrafte and we throw snowball and his that 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:21.119
 happens it's all torn and so 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:22.830
 blocks scatters that's cool let's 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:27.000
 for the probe you to see how it all 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.619
 scatters well and you can also 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.719
 do this so that everything trembles 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:36.420
 was acquired simply thorough 

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:38.550
 That's how I think it looks very cool 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.820
 give more days for me for some reason 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.920
 don't like a lot like a 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:46.260
 cool Well, and how to do it all 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.899
 really very easy to do so a 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.360
 we throw a snowball when he was a kid 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.340
 there is one block that is here it flies 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.140
 snowball for example this is their freedom and 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.780
 one block below is already in 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.660
 stone the fate of such a team that 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.370
 first puts beneath the blessings of the air then 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.049
 there is 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:06.720
 football takes off here for example here you fly 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.060
 but he was here istanbul and he puts here 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.130
 the air and at the same here in these 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.540
 coordinates starts a block with 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.240
 a certain direction so he 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:18.270
 flew out and it looks like this 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.360
 we throw a snowball and that's what happens 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:24.479
 block toss and falls back here 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.670
 again that is, we are testing snowball 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.890
 if it is under the conditional blocks 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.409
 he puts a block of air on this spot 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:35.939
 this starts silestone snap 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:38.130
 gathered upwards like this 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.590
 done by two teams first first 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.290
 testing snowball then testing under 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.530
 block if there is a son under it 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:50.540
 stone then he changes this fruit to air and 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:53.880
 then on the same coordinates and spawn 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:56.640
 son stone won and the links and 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.290
 choose idi unit and how much it will be 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.210
 fly well there is generally possible and my husband 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.579
 direction we chose to check only 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.590
 one therefore fascinates and when we did 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:08.250
 that the bomb is straight that was considered because 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.099
 that I tested the snowball and the ground 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.420
 there is a kingdom around them for example here 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:13.090
 is testing a block that is 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.160
 eg 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.840
 not here but here and when it finds 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.739
 stress here he launches from blu coins 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.709
 go there 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:23.739
 so it looks cool on the course here 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:25.000
 here and the motion and in this direction now you 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:26.530
 you can write me in the comments what are you 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.780
 should do the following video it even 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.670
 we are not interesting and simple unusual 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.650
 what can be done is very simple but with 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.220
 this it can see people and English 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.290
 did not understand 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.290
 Thank you all for watching and all for now.
