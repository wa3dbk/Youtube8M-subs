00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:10.749
 there 

00:00:10.749 --> 00:00:13.749
 the student 

00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:19.779
 the year the construction industry has already been affected by the 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:22.039
 new sales should keep up this pace 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:23.259
 until 2015 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:27.089
 is what a research released by Sinduscon-sp union of the 

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:29.179
 construction industry in parana 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:32.480
 a bitch works so hard that builders find an alternative 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.480
 to deal with the shortage of labor 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.199
 outside a common apartment 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:43.659
 was inside the walls and the pure technology ceiling with some plasterboard 

00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:48.620
 builders do not make any more relatives in stones and bricks the very common system 

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:52.589
 in the United States the prefabricated panels with a wool blanket of 

00:00:52.589 --> 00:00:57.889
 Glass for sound insulation in the slab ceiling has smaller preformed daughters 

00:00:57.889 --> 00:01:02.239
 that it comes in the right size a faster and better technique with the 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:05.250
 environment - includes the work 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.400
 the cariocas talking about the best all of us already the team of slabs 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:15.570
 using the same question all the time the system and even with 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:16.570
 a goal 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:21.980
 just hungry with so many ready materials the builders can reduce 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:23.630
 the service during the work 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.799
 and the companies that produce these large-scale manufactured parts 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:31.479
 he orders are always made well in advance so it is well 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:34.420
 the risk of delaying the delivery of orders 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.400
 and also of construction 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.520
 by conventional system this building would take four years to get ready 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.790
 with so much technology the deadline is in advance will be delivered in three years 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.700
 also reduce the time of the work bringing a technique used in Japan in the 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:55.380
 construction only grows no bricks the material costs more 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.689
 in the end the guaranteed economy 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.130
 close your eyes and exercise 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.580
 full of style the victim of a shock 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.260
 I must have been more 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.560
 already in the game we can disguise texts and at the construction site no one 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.390
 Are you afraid of losing your job for these news as he works with 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.260
 production 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.560
 the more you produce 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.040
 However, it should be noted that there is more one who normally 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.339
 health plans the toucan 

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:22.349
 now 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:22.959
 the case
