00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.680
 hello kitchens welcome to the kitchen 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.950
 of life I am Laura and this is my 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:16.650
 cook today we are going to cook hake to the 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.880
 Roman so first we'll get the 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.960
 apron 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.960
 as always 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.930
 with the knot ahead you know 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.650
 to put the rag on which to dry 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.650
 hands 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.340
 the tools we need for the 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.940
 hake a la romana are very simple 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.940
 a non-stick pan 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.340
 A spatula 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:53.640
 a deep dish and a fork or 

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:53.640
 rods to be able to beat an egg 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:02.180
 ingredients that we need to make 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.180
 a hake to the Roman 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.420
 a filleted hake 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.180
 a little bit of salt 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.170
 olive oil 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:20.710
 egg 

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:23.200
 and flour I like to use flour 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:26.080
 integral that is this one that is a bit more 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:30.390
 It lasts that refined flour but a lot 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.390
 healthier and this is all 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.360
 what we will do is light the fire 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.190
 a fire not very strong 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.820
 so rather small we put the pan 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.490
 we throw the oil 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.759
 the amount of oil has to be more 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:04.659
 or less than half a centimeter in height 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:06.990
 of oil has to do not have to get 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:10.750
 to cover them the fillets of hake 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.549
 simply because a little oil like that 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.160
 an amount I like to cook with 

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:19.050
 a lot of oil the oil gives a flavor to 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:21.920
 the food that is wonderful 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.920
 more or less 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:28.040
 more or less around here a little bit more 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:31.129
 I could have chosen another bottle 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.080
 of enough oil while 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:36.650
 heat the oil 

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:40.970
 we prepare a source 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:43.129
 with kitchen paper or blotting paper that 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:46.370
 is where we will put the fillets of 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:49.640
 hake once cooked 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:51.319
 so that it drips well and soaks the oil 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.450
 surplus 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:55.730
 and while the oil in the pan is 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:58.719
 it warms up what we have to do is 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.719
 whisk the egg 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:09.629
 from friend we can use a fork one 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.629
 rod each 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.410
 we beat the game 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.939
 A) Yes 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:32.350
 and ready we have the egg we have the 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:35.020
 flour and we have around here that I do not know if 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:38.459
 Hake fillets are we are going 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:38.459
 to take a little salt 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:46.319
 very little this depends a little on the 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:49.950
 like everyone and if you have to 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:52.130
 take better care of your health and take a diet 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:55.170
 with little salt 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:59.810
 let's go there we'll take a steak 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.810
 hake we had for the flour 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:07.689
 we went through the egg 

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:16.980
 and in the pan the first time with the 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:19.790
 skin up 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:25.840
 this is a bit sticky I know 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:25.840
 we go there another bit the breaded 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:34.440
 in flour we give you a tour of the 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.440
 egg 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:43.470
 and to roast in 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.470
 one more that fits me 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.600
 flour 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:53.560
 web 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:58.949
 well on all sides 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:06.110
 to the attentive 

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:08.419
 and we would wait for it to be done a little bit 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:10.129
 this side before turning them over 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:13.029
 meanwhile I'm going to wash these 

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:13.029
 crimes with water 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:23.940
 well let's go around these 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:27.510
 hake fillets with the help of the 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:30.320
 spatula and fork with which we have 

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.320
 whipped the egg 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:37.890
 and to each according to the skill you have 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.890
 it will work out better or worse 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:45.900
 another couple of minutes here in the pan and 

00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:48.350
 these little things will be ready right away 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.350
 we come back 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:00.360
 well these friends are ready to me 

00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:02.700
 I do not like that fish is made too much 

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:05.970
 I like it to be soft and juicy 

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:07.680
 inside so with a couple of minutes per 

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:10.790
 each side are enough 

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:14.330
 louis that golden scar turns out 

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:16.860
 and a wonder they will also be 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:19.440
 very good we can eat it hot 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:21.920
 cold with a mayonnaise like the one 

00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:25.260
 we did the other day it would be sensational 

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:27.150
 so nothing else so we would continue with 

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:29.550
 all the hake fillets that we 

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:33.260
 there are only left for me to say until soon 

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:33.260
 and bon app√©tit
