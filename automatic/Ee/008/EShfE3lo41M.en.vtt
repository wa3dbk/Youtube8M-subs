00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.179
 ah 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.660
 gardens of mexico the future park of 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:37.030
 largest landscaping in Latin America 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:39.580
 is preparing to open its doors the year 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:42.280
 next while they are exhibited 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:44.320
 some of his treasures in Florida from the 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.540
 Dutch horticultural fair more 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.280
 important in the world our project 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.470
 consists of a landscaping park 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.500
 where we will have different types of 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:54.390
 representative gardens of the world 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.640
 obviously including mexico 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.949
 highlighting the flora that we have in the 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.020
 country as is the desert through the 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:04.449
 cactus and tropical garden 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:06.070
 that precisely a part of the garden 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:08.580
 tropical is what we come to show today 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.580
 in Florida 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.820
 the tropical garden does not exactly 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.920
 characterized by its color rather they are 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.049
 green tones and we also play with the 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.759
 water then we can see also inside 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:23.679
 our provision to this little waterfall 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:25.869
 what do they really find in 

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:28.240
 tropical gardens where we can 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:30.310
 see the passage of water some other 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.319
 species and if something color like that 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.479
 new flower that we see here on that side 

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:37.179
 what we are looking for is also to link 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:39.700
 with tour operators that's why 

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:41.560
 also the link with the secretary 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.479
 of tourism from the federal government is 

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.849
 important for us to give 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:47.289
 promotion to our park and that the 

00:01:45.849 --> 00:01:50.079
 international tourism that reaches 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:52.239
 Mexico to visit gardens mexico 

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:54.130
 as a visit already required given that 

00:01:52.239 --> 00:01:57.489
 we want to position our park as 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:02:00.659
 an icon a reference in the state of 

00:01:57.489 --> 00:02:00.659
 morelos and nationally 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.610
 highlight that if it is the first park of 

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:14.760
 landscaping that we are going to have in 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:17.460
 Latin America then they are 100 hectares 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.490
 of which in this first stage 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.490
 will build 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:25.519
 45 50 hectares of themed gardens the 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:27.590
 investment is important and we are 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:29.870
 generating a 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.890
 also a spill in issues of 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:35.420
 employment we have approximately thought 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:37.819
 750 direct and 1,500 indirect jobs 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.560
 during the development of the park which 

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:41.390
 would be the contribution and of Holland in particular 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.910
 to the gardens of mexico 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:47.420
 we come a lot to learn them especially 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:49.489
 the issue of production made for 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.590
 our gardens we have built 6 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:54.260
 hectares of ships with technology 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.280
 Dutch with cen business then 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.660
 we were also in the 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.519
 cem facilities we were 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.349
 visiting several greenhouses here 

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:02.329
 holland and we are learning that 

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:04.220
 production process all the flowers 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:06.500
 that we are going to exhibit in the park will be 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:09.349
 produced in the same park then 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.549
 I think that Holland is already having a 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:12.590
 strong tradition on the subject of 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:15.200
 horticulture we can learn a lot from 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.599
 them and with that although in particular the 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.209
 way to show them the gardens and 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:22.519
 to be able to operate and receive so many 

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:24.290
 visitors from all over the world do not 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:27.040
 which is the same as we expect there in 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.040
 gardens of mexico
