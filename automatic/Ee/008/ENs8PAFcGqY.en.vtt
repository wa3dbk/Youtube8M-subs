00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.330 
first thing I will say about Diablo is I

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.390 
first thing I will say about Diablo is I
literally<00:03:53.260> for<00:03:53.440> the<00:03:53.500> first<00:03:53.739> probably<00:03:54.100> three

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
literally for the first probably three

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.030 
literally for the first probably three
days<00:03:54.550> of<00:03:54.850> it<00:03:55.000> I<00:03:55.180> definitely<00:03:55.480> had<00:03:56.020> some<00:03:56.350> some<00:03:56.920> of

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:57.040 
days of it I definitely had some some of

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.330 
days of it I definitely had some some of
those<00:03:57.100> flushed<00:03:57.550> face<00:03:57.880> like<00:03:58.360> hot<00:03:58.660> moments<00:03:59.340> but

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
those flushed face like hot moments but

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:01.860 
those flushed face like hot moments but
I<00:04:00.370> think<00:04:00.670> I<00:04:00.700> start<00:04:00.940> to<00:04:01.030> adapt<00:04:01.270> to<00:04:01.300> a<00:04:01.480> little<00:04:01.750> bit

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
I think I start to adapt to a little bit

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:04.320 
I think I start to adapt to a little bit
and<00:04:02.110> it<00:04:02.770> literally<00:04:03.160> for<00:04:03.550> the<00:04:03.580> last<00:04:03.850> you<00:04:04.209> know

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
seven days became my morning coffee and

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.550 
seven days became my morning coffee and
I<00:04:06.850> enjoy<00:04:07.090> it<00:04:07.120> I<00:04:07.269> actually<00:04:07.390> preferred<00:04:08.019> it<00:04:08.200> over

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560

suppressant here's the good news

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:24.850 
suppressant here's the good news
most<00:04:23.509> people<00:04:23.780> that<00:04:23.870> take<00:04:24.050> of<00:04:24.199> that<00:04:24.380> work<00:04:24.560> are

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
most people that take of that work are

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.040 
most people that take of that work are
not<00:04:25.070> trying<00:04:25.430> to<00:04:25.580> grow<00:04:25.940> like<00:04:26.210> me<00:04:26.389> right<00:04:26.570> now<00:04:26.720> so

the<00:05:38.090> last<00:05:38.300> couple<00:05:38.719> reps<00:05:38.990> a<00:05:39.349> little<00:05:39.620> bit<00:05:39.770> more

00:05:39.999 --> 00:05:40.009 
the last couple reps a little bit more

00:05:40.009 --> 00:05:42.429 
the last couple reps a little bit more
than<00:05:40.460> I<00:05:40.490> normally<00:05:40.639> do<00:05:41.210> so<00:05:41.719> I<00:05:41.749> feel<00:05:42.050> like<00:05:42.080> it<00:05:42.289> did

00:05:42.429 --> 00:05:42.439 
than I normally do so I feel like it did
