00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.070 
their Sunday ball match this painting is

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.220 
their Sunday ball match this painting is
actually<00:00:34.160> entitled<00:00:34.880> to<00:00:34.969> further<00:00:35.210> match<00:00:35.480> which

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:36.230 
actually entitled to further match which

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.229 
actually entitled to further match which
I<00:00:36.320> think<00:00:36.500> sums<00:00:36.800> up<00:00:37.070> the<00:00:37.370> fact<00:00:37.579> that<00:00:37.640> it's<00:00:37.820> just

00:00:38.229 --> 00:00:38.239 
I think sums up the fact that it's just

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:41.350 
I think sums up the fact that it's just
that<00:00:38.420> moment<00:00:38.780> in<00:00:39.140> time<00:00:39.469> where<00:00:40.370> perhaps<00:00:41.030> this

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.360 
that moment in time where perhaps this

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.690 
that moment in time where perhaps this
is<00:00:41.540> the<00:00:41.719> deciding<00:00:42.200> throw<00:00:42.680> of<00:00:43.190> the<00:00:43.370> entire

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:43.700 
is the deciding throw of the entire

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.729 
is the deciding throw of the entire
match<00:00:44.030> which<00:00:44.719> way<00:00:44.899> is<00:00:44.960> it<00:00:45.079> going<00:00:45.260> to<00:00:45.320> go<00:00:45.469> that's

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 
match which way is it going to go that's

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:47.919 
match which way is it going to go that's
the<00:00:45.860> question<00:00:46.370> there's<00:00:46.969> no<00:00:47.090> shortage<00:00:47.510> of<00:00:47.660> help

00:00:47.919 --> 00:00:47.929 
the question there's no shortage of help

00:00:47.929 --> 00:00:49.389 
the question there's no shortage of help
and<00:00:48.050> advice<00:00:48.379> from<00:00:48.589> these<00:00:48.800> guys<00:00:49.070> in<00:00:49.280> the

00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:49.399 
and advice from these guys in the

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:51.790 
and advice from these guys in the
shadows<00:00:49.820> I<00:00:50.059> like<00:00:50.480> the<00:00:50.629> idea<00:00:50.929> that<00:00:50.989> a<00:00:51.140> painting

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
shadows I like the idea that a painting

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.910 
shadows I like the idea that a painting
has<00:00:51.949> a<00:00:51.980> little<00:00:52.489> bit<00:00:52.550> of<00:00:52.609> a<00:00:52.730> narrative<00:00:52.999> to<00:00:53.239> it

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920 
has a little bit of a narrative to it

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.799 
has a little bit of a narrative to it
like<00:00:54.920> that<00:00:55.129> and<00:00:55.339> perhaps<00:00:56.179> every<00:00:56.510> time<00:00:56.690> you

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:56.809 
like that and perhaps every time you

00:00:56.809 --> 00:00:58.599 
like that and perhaps every time you
look<00:00:56.960> at<00:00:57.019> this<00:00:57.170> painting<00:00:57.409> you<00:00:57.710> can<00:00:57.739> you<00:00:58.460> can

00:00:58.599 --> 00:00:58.609 
look at this painting you can you can

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:00.220 
look at this painting you can you can
decide<00:00:58.909> on<00:00:59.059> a<00:00:59.089> different<00:00:59.420> outcome<00:00:59.659> to<00:01:00.109> the

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
decide on a different outcome to the

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.990 
decide on a different outcome to the
match<00:01:02.079> this<00:01:03.079> painting<00:01:03.620> in<00:01:03.859> many<00:01:04.400> ways<00:01:04.699> is<00:01:04.970> a

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
match this painting in many ways is a

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.320 
match this painting in many ways is a
painting<00:01:05.420> based<00:01:05.570> on<00:01:05.810> childhood<00:01:06.350> memories

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.330

me so much of my childhood they spent it

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.330 
me so much of my childhood they spent it
along<00:01:13.700> the<00:01:13.820> riverbank<00:01:14.740> and<00:01:15.740> here<00:01:15.920> we<00:01:16.010> are<00:01:16.159> in

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
along the riverbank and here we are in

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:23.420 
probably familiar to many people but one

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:24.639
