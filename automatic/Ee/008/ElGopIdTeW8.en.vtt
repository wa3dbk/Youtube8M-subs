one of the arm negatives with this
sniper<00:04:33.200> rifle<00:04:33.560> is<00:04:33.740> the<00:04:34.160> slow<00:04:35.090> rate<00:04:35.360> of<00:04:35.419> fire

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750 
sniper rifle is the slow rate of fire

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.219 
sniper rifle is the slow rate of fire
but<00:04:36.250> this<00:04:37.250> will<00:04:37.700> make<00:04:37.850> each<00:04:38.090> shot<00:04:38.570> you<00:04:39.050> shoot

00:04:39.219 --> 00:04:39.229 
but this will make each shot you shoot

so<00:04:40.760> it<00:04:40.910> isn't<00:04:41.060> only<00:04:41.450> negative<00:04:42.020> that<00:04:42.200> it<00:04:42.290> is

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:42.410 
so it isn't only negative that it is

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:55.659 
so it isn't only negative that it is
firing<00:04:42.830> so<00:04:43.160> slower<00:04:43.400> Isis<00:04:43.760> it<00:04:43.880> as<00:04:44.090> it<00:04:44.570> is

rifles<00:06:01.159> and<00:06:01.400> as<00:06:02.389> you<00:06:02.599> may<00:06:02.779> noticed<00:06:03.169> all<00:06:04.039> the

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:04.430 
rifles and as you may noticed all the

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:06.490 
rifles and as you may noticed all the
samples<00:06:04.969> were<00:06:05.300> both<00:06:05.569> actions<00:06:06.020> lock<00:06:06.169> raffles

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:06.500 
samples were both actions lock raffles

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.339

00:06:12.129 --> 00:06:12.139
