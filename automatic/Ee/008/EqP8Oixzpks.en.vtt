00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:03.479
 many people who if our resource 

00:00:03.479 --> 00:00:05.440
 franchise offers 

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.970
 then with that question year 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:10.919
 as a rule the main question is yes and it is on the street 

00:00:10.919 --> 00:00:12.439
 manufacturing 

00:00:12.439 --> 00:00:15.129
 mainly disc production 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:17.730
 what it looks like from what this consists 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.189
 what material are needed 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.189
 Well, then how to compose it shorter 

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:25.879
 and now for now the main elements in 

00:00:25.879 --> 00:00:28.719
 In principle, here it is all very easy and 

00:00:28.719 --> 00:00:30.409
 simply 

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:32.870
 mini make it difficult to force it 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.300
 see all the memories once 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.860
 it means the percentage that we need 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.050
 we need 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:42.110
 attack a box with whether are called 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:43.430
 can buy 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.430
 in any store 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:46.940
 On the market 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:47.909
 that is, it 

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:50.909
 standard 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.160
 covers 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.560
 by the way work on a new phone 

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.970
 recipient's table such works fine gifts 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:01.960
 us 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.860
 that is, you can already be immediately 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:05.590
 start from this drives after 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.510
 acquisitions get by phone 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:09.640
 the disks themselves 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.000
 naturally 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.780
 painted 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.910
 percent recommend ordering them 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.610
 in a printing house in some company 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.480
 photographic rendering services 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.460
 productions as covers 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.440
 so and business cards and 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.720
 many principle onslaught too is drawn 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.150
 marks called drawing 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.960
 silk screen printing 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.980
 Here we have it 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:37.320
 somewhere from eight to 1 7 rubles 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.730
 manufacturing of one disk 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:43.740
 that means the box cover discs and 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:45.940
 final no 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:47.150
 this 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.330
 so here is a transparent bag plenochka 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:51.940
 which gives 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.940
 quite an interesting thing 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:56.740
 Effect 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.960
 end product 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.820
 how does it look like 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.020
 what's next 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.490
 victory in the fight against inflation itself 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:06.460
 the order 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.519
 such gloss gives 

00:02:09.519 --> 00:02:12.889
 an hour I will show how all things are sent us 

00:02:12.889 --> 00:02:14.569
 it's done like this 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:15.440
 is taken 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.440
 cars drive 

00:02:19.219 --> 00:02:21.239
 rather boxes with here 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:23.239
 Iraqis drive 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:25.659
 is inserted 

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:27.819
 take cover 

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:30.459
 just turn over 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:32.549
 present 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:34.829
 in this way 

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:37.569
 percent 

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:39.120
 close we take 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.689
 package 

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:43.239
 he has our lobe we tear off 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:47.319
 pavlov so the tape is far from being tried 

00:02:47.929 --> 00:02:50.929
 turning skp to 

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:54.930
 but for the closing side was for 1 

00:02:54.929 --> 00:02:57.929
 they say russia will look 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:01.649
 we insert 

00:03:01.649 --> 00:03:05.039
 we fix 

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:07.199
 all leaderism is ready 

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:08.529
 Oh please 

00:03:08.529 --> 00:03:11.839
 everything is just a simple legit 

00:03:11.839 --> 00:03:14.839
 20 15 20 minutes how would 

00:03:16.669 --> 00:03:19.379
 so I can prepare a point here 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:22.809
 shook his hand even for such cases already 

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:25.279
 managed to do 

00:03:25.279 --> 00:03:27.319
 maybe it's here somewhere order probably 

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:29.229
 forty disks 

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:31.589
 we believe 

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:34.879
 all commodity 8 1000 rubles that's tuning interfere 

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:38.719
 all this can be done 

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:41.089
 at home sitting at a table like me at the moment 

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:43.849
 a business 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:44.959
 especially not straining
