00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 guys jackman moments in this video 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.060
 well explain them exactly how 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.980
 rewards and chests work 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:09.360
 treasures in the price of the elderly already 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.920
 that there was a lot of confusion about it and 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.719
 I have received many questions 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.179
 you first of all take into account 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.710
 the following each level or modality in 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.480
 the pressure old people have their own 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.460
 weekly reward that can only 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.039
 get one time with each character 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.689
 every week money 28 has brands and 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.300
 Avant-garde reputation together with 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.090
 engrams and over 32 gives you a core 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.180
 armor that of 34 a core of weapons and 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.399
 an etheric light and of 35 both nuclei and 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.899
 the etheric and all these modalities you 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.120
 they give reputation to the house of judgment that 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.680
 is the faction of barix on the reef you 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.360
 you can do each of these in the 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.420
 order you want and they will reward you 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.219
 if for example in a week you do 4 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.289
 difficulties or modalities with only one 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.230
 character receive absolutely 2 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:54.719
 cores of weapon 2 cores armor 2 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.129
 Terika looks a thousand or more of reputation to the 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.930
 barix faction and other rewards 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.500
 like good bizarre light bikes without 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.960
 dramas now to the top of all this there are 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.640
 including an extra reward this is 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.210
 you get by opening the treasure chest of 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.860
 the Queen 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.260
 which requires you to have a key on 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.200
 treasure when you overcome the presidio this 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.670
 chest does not have a weekly enclosure and 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.140
 as long as you have a key to the 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.240

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.770
 only once per game this treasure is 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.479
 you can get lucky by opening them with 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.740
 front on the wolves after 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.390
 overcome an event of hunts in 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.670

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.830
 these events in addition to that when 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.960
 You surpass all history missions 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.850
 of the expansion they give you a key with 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.369
 this method you can get three one 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.080
 with each character and finally sometimes 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.850
 before rod argent finally priced the 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.009
 elderly can each players and a 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.720
 key as a reward or you can even 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.460
 go out in the small chests in the room 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.649
 of the treasure just before opening the chest 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.750
 the queen the reward of the chest of the 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.640
 queen are pretty good these can 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.009
 be tokens to exchange with ships 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.830
 by ships shaders or class brands 

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:06.720
 exotic weapons and go quite often 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.119
 I have opened five chests of the queen and 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.220
 He received three exotic also speckles 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.300
 of light and strange coins and weapons 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.430
 legendary of the queen 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.050
 you're not very sure if you just 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.030
 they get here but if I can tell you 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.560
 that of the five chests each one has 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.600
 given a weapon from the queen and all have 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.920
 been different then no these weapons is 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.930
 that like the ones in the tower 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:25.950
 they can reform 9 gunsmith so 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.830
 get the skills that you most 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.930
 like even to the top of all this there 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.280
 a hidden exotic contract that can 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:34.650
 leave when completing the price the 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.600
 elders this so you do not have to 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.880
 see with the chests it simply comes out 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.070
 lucky to defeat the last boss alone 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.170
 I've seen a person get it and it came out 

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:45.060
 in difficulty level 34 I do not know if 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.580
 they also know the 32 but I'm sure 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.890
 that if you can there is one of 35 when you complete 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.450
 this contract lets you choose between a 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.310
 of the 39 sex test as a subject of 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.630
 fallen so I'm sure everyone 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.460
 we want to obtain it since simply 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.930
 get it then you have the option to 

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:00.180
 choose any of the most 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.530
 like we still do not know much about this contract 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.750
 exotic but just have more 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.760
 information this other video so for 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.900
 summarize guys every depression modality 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.000
 Elderly has its own reward 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.710
 weekly we can get them in the order 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.930
 that we want and receive them once for 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:14.430
 week to complete the presidio we are going to 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.080
 throw the treasure and one of these mails 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.870
 requires a special key to open it 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.489
 this does not affect the weekly rewards 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.230
 you can repeat the presidio how many times 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:24.269
 you want and open this chest always and 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.010
 When you have a key the keys are 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:28.110
 rare to obtain but then try to 

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.879
 collect several a day and then let's say 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:32.099
 that you repeat the presidio several times and 

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:33.299
 level 28 which is the easiest now is the 

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:35.760
 chest that you will have a chance to receive 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:37.409
 enough rewards I'm very sure 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.659
 that the modality in which 

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:41.760
 I passed the presidio the reward of this 

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:44.099
 The chest does not change, although it may be that 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.510
 wrong so nothing guys if you do not 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:47.280
 there were doubts left in the comments 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.950
 Greetings to all if you are Australian 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:52.280
