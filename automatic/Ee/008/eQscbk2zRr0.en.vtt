seche vite over the white I always do
that<00:00:43.680> before<00:00:43.950> creating<00:00:44.850> a<00:00:45.210> gradient<00:00:45.570> always

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:47.980 
that before creating a gradient always

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.310 
that before creating a gradient always
to<00:00:48.579> do<00:00:48.730> the<00:00:48.880> gradient<00:00:49.239> i'm<00:00:49.510> using<00:00:49.809> a<00:00:49.899> latex

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:50.320 
to do the gradient i'm using a latex

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.380 
to do the gradient i'm using a latex
free<00:00:50.530> sponge<00:00:50.920> i<00:00:51.160> always<00:00:51.610> use<00:00:51.790> latex<00:00:52.030> free

sponges they tend to give you a much
better<00:00:54.600> smoother<00:00:55.600> gradient<00:00:56.320> effect<00:00:56.440> and<00:00:56.920> yes

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:57.460 
better smoother gradient effect and yes

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.799 
better smoother gradient effect and yes
I<00:00:57.489> have<00:00:57.670> Denver<00:00:58.300> do<00:00:58.480> with<00:00:58.780> some<00:00:59.079> warm<00:00:59.440> water<00:01:00.809> so

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:01.809 
I have Denver do with some warm water so

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:03.420 
I have Denver do with some warm water so
you<00:01:01.870> repeat<00:01:02.290> the<00:01:02.440> process<00:01:02.620> of<00:01:02.949> painting<00:01:03.220> the

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.430 
you repeat the process of painting the

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.280 
you repeat the process of painting the
police<00:01:03.730> directly<00:01:03.910> onto<00:01:04.360> the<00:01:04.479> sponge<00:01:04.900> and<00:01:05.170> then

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.290 
police directly onto the sponge and then

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:06.990 
police directly onto the sponge and then
dabbing<00:01:05.650> that<00:01:05.800> onto<00:01:06.160> your<00:01:06.310> nail<00:01:06.430> as<00:01:06.700> many

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.000 
dabbing that onto your nail as many

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.090 
dabbing that onto your nail as many
times<00:01:07.330> as<00:01:07.540> you<00:01:07.720> like<00:01:07.750> in<00:01:08.290> order<00:01:08.650> to<00:01:08.680> get<00:01:08.979> the

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
times as you like in order to get the

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.510 
times as you like in order to get the
strength<00:01:09.430> of<00:01:09.580> color<00:01:09.850> that<00:01:09.970> you're<00:01:10.270> after<00:01:11.520> but

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
strength of color that you're after but

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.490 
strength of color that you're after but
this<00:01:12.640> one<00:01:12.820> I<00:01:12.880> did<00:01:13.150> it<00:01:13.270> three<00:01:13.540> or<00:01:13.570> four<00:01:13.930> times<00:01:14.200> I

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
this one I did it three or four times I

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.620 
this one I did it three or four times I
think<00:01:14.770> in<00:01:15.130> order<00:01:15.310> to<00:01:15.610> get<00:01:15.759> a<00:01:15.790> very<00:01:16.270> very

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 
think in order to get a very very

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.649 
think in order to get a very very
vibrant<00:01:17.229> color<00:01:17.790> you<00:01:18.790> can<00:01:18.940> also<00:01:19.090> depend<00:01:19.479> on<00:01:19.600> the

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:19.659 
vibrant color you can also depend on the

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:21.359 
vibrant color you can also depend on the
brand<00:01:20.050> or<00:01:20.259> the<00:01:20.380> type<00:01:20.590> of<00:01:20.619> polish<00:01:21.070> that<00:01:21.220> you're

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:21.369 
brand or the type of polish that you're

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:22.980 
brand or the type of polish that you're
using<00:01:21.610> some<00:01:22.030> a<00:01:22.060> thinner<00:01:22.420> than<00:01:22.630> others<00:01:22.960> and

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
using some a thinner than others and

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.550 
using some a thinner than others and
might<00:01:23.320> require<00:01:23.649> a<00:01:23.710> lot<00:01:24.070> more<00:01:24.100> coats<00:01:25.380> and<00:01:26.380> once

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
might require a lot more coats and once

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.350 
might require a lot more coats and once
my<00:01:26.740> gradient<00:01:27.009> was<00:01:27.280> complete<00:01:27.670> I<00:01:27.850> just<00:01:28.090> pulled
