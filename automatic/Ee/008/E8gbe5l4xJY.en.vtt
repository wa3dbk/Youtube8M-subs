 such 

00:00:01.369 --> 00:00:04.440
 Parts of the neighbors I can not use yet 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.180
 damned 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:10.180
 quiet sometimes 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.389
 Brussels advised thicker 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.389
 the press often difficult 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.820
 at Werner's head 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.480
 Woman from normal Penck further holes again bring to the euro 

00:00:31.729 --> 00:00:33.710
 and again 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.700
 I suppose it can be companies 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.010
 AR customers 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.150

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.150
 and it keeps coming TuS must 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.820
 Do not give Kusturica 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:52.990
 Now watch out where it is not the federal government 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.600

 Spohle and that too with 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.620
 clear 

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.260
 here how many 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.580
 until 12 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.950
 there are still here 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:23.280
 the wars 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.280
 No way 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.200
 that was clear 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.260
 the message that the 

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.110
 what role does the report play? 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.410
 7 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:40.500

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.280
 Jeker publishing house percent 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.280
 Thacker were Straubing 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.280
 what me too 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.640
 stay at accuracy 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.640
 that's how it works 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.700
 Buer 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.700
 that was close 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.809
 Lord so now graces the 12th 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.030

00:02:11.969 --> 00:02:14.969
 only knows that 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:17.339
 2 

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:20.349
 that's so 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:23.349
 It just does not look good right now 

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:28.389
 It will be critical now that it is there - so stay put 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:36.239
 I want to fast with the 1 

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:40.619
 big Meier clear 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:47.239
 because people raised 

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:52.579
 I mean the partially privatized c ++ net duer goen 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:56.109
 Kickers went sword 

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:59.109
 what does not all here four turnover 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:04.489
 for a sensation 

00:03:05.679 --> 00:03:07.549
 that was clear 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:10.239
 b different Andrews 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:14.019
 she is only 11 as she was attacked by the other Lorians herself 

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:17.029
 Oh, you saint 

00:03:17.029 --> 00:03:18.869

00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:21.869
 Peters the nastiest US victory has been 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:29.809

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:32.809
 Coburn, whether the IEC honor couples 

00:03:33.339 --> 00:03:36.339
 and above all 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:39.939
 his taste 

00:03:39.939 --> 00:03:42.769
 also 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:45.769
 if it is still visible 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:54.049
 that looked like SuS 

00:04:00.969 --> 00:04:03.969
 after attack 

00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:07.559
 it has to be visible 

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:16.409
 now also wants Kommern 

00:04:16.409 --> 00:04:19.169
 use meters 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:22.169

 Hit and again 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:39.909
 I have Rheine danger in the loop 

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:42.909
 Lines like us or not 

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:47.499
 Zuber pretty good 

00:04:47.499 --> 00:04:50.499
 Stecher though mainly through and through young 

00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:58.050
 Rorsted continues 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.289
 continues to want the circles 

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:04.289
 pretty easy to figure out 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.150
 Profile Stitch always behind him 

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:14.180
 I was not expecting seats completely 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:17.180
 who's the swordmaster? 

00:05:24.089 --> 00:05:25.520
