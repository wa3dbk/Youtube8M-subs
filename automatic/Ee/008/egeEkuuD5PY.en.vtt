00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:07.260
 to me 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.460
 look 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:17.770
 option to teach 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:19.990
 hi friends, here we are with a 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:22.660
 new video that is critical to the w the 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.730
 very famous struggles of the USA versus the 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.220
 Mexican struggles such as triple-a or 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.140
 world wrestling council decides 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.210
 discuss this issue as only just 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.370
 pass the 1000th episode of raw and 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.770
 we will start from where he is born in the fight 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.750
 free in mexico the origins of the struggle 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.610
 free in mexico go back to eras 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.620
 little suspected is said that this 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.960
 sport was introduced to our country 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:48.760
 during the French intervention in the 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:51.429
 year of 1863 in 1910 he came to mexico to his 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.230
 total climax and founded the two companies 

00:00:51.429 --> 00:00:55.179
 leaders in mexico as the council 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.829
 World Wrestling Championship and the 

00:00:55.179 --> 00:00:59.019
 triple to the truth of seen the two 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:01.480
 struggles is a bit better for me 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:03.609
 the us because the triple-a have already 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.530
 been doing very false already in place 

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:07.780
 of struggles seem like telenovelas that 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.240
 cybernetic said the grim reaper that the dragon 

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.370
 golden said that the dogs of evil are 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.470
 with those of the foreign union that with 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:16.480
 The bald guy seems gay, he does not know either 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.190
 it's about that and the truth the fight 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.710
 Mexican has dropped a little level 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.760
 from his great idols as was the 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.190
 holy blue 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.840
 cavernario the thousand masks and others 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.360
 heroes that was for us the 

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.460
 Mexicans but the double one stays very 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.950
 back that with his jong movies and others 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.750
 pirate wrestlers that the only one is charged 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.030
 fighter that really kind of me 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.040
 like like fights is the undertaker and 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:41.770

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.510
 Mysterio Alberto of the river without face that is 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.730
 the mystic because they present a decent level 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:50.800

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:53.650
