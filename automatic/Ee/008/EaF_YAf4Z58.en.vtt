00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:08.060
 because of how the route they are 

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:10.040
 taking our agreements with the 

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:12.190
 television that really is riding in 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:15.350
 to transmit 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:18.080
 our games 

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:20.840
 I can not make it known at the moment 

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:24.020
 because we are still in a process of 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:28.820
 negotiation that culminates the next 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:30.800
 sanz but as of Monday 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:33.230
 but by Tuesday it will take to 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.880
 but what we can anticipate 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.270
 by previous agreements that have been 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:41.400
 been taking is that black lions will 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:47.220
 is defining as the schedule 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:48.970
 play at home on Sundays at 5 o'clock 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.550
 late 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:54.010
 we thought convenient after a 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.980
 analysis and discussion by the television 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:59.920
 we are dealing with the convenience of 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:03.640
 outside a very accessible schedule to everything 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:06.580
 type of audience including then note 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:10.600
 the infant of the relative the infantile 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:13.930
 because not always for this 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:16.560
 the best schedule very at night 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:19.210
 and good is a schedule that practically 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.680
 only one team 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.680
 national leagues 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.820
 and have as their own schedule that is 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.850
 just another team of houses and more 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:35.730
 but in a mirror schedule to ours 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.890
 then in the already prepared calendar 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:40.290
 by the Mexican federation in as much 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.870
 we are visitors 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.520
 chivas is local and vice versa when 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:47.850
 we are from local they will be 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:51.890
 of visitors so from the 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.890
 next Sunday 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.550
 7 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.360
 we will have the first day at home 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:02.570
 this 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:05.240
 for heavy cheers against the querÃ©taro 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.479
 and well we are waiting for a good 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:11.090
 moment to make the presentation 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:13.730
 formal of each and every one of the 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.910
 players that are integrated into this 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:19.550
 season to strengthen the team of 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:22.760
 black lions in their foray into first 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:25.520
 division and the truth is that it's a taste 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:29.630
 for us to have them today 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:31.820
 here to the players and good to do a 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.820
 ritual that for us is very 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:38.360
 important that we had not done it but 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:42.790
 which is important for all those who 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.790
 that we are part of this medium 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:45.910
 Y
