00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:08.580
 Today I will show you how to do 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:15.870
 diagnostics on the Passat would be the third with 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:19.020
 rp motor from 88 to 98 pasca on others 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.869
 Motors and year of release this 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:25.830
 procedure may vary on motors 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:28.730
 rps 90 to 91 years this procedure is also 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.730
 may differ 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.119
 remove the cover 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.380
 fastener connectors should be here 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.870
 but they are broken so the wires are just 

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:55.460
 tucked in 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:58.989
 he went inside the very beginning they were 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.989
 shoved very deep 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:17.980
 so we have two black chips 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:22.510
 brown brown can still be 

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:34.840
 white to brown can be 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:41.170
 one or two wires black is a plus and 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:43.650
 minus plus red wire is brown 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.650
 minus 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:57.310
 here should be well Halloween 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:00.380
 there is only one line 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:03.440
 there are two types of verification the first is 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.930
 when the yellow light is present 2 

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.550
 when she is gone 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:10.369
 it is advisable to warm up before checking 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:13.370
 car check can even be done on 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:16.760
 engine running if yellow 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.430
 light bulb is present need to connect 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:23.800
 wire 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.800
 wire on brown chips 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:37.280
 turn on the ignition and the second end 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:43.610
 connected wire to close with 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:50.209
 weight somewhere for 5 seconds here and let go 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:52.989
 leash started diagnostics code consists 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:52.989
 4 digits 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.370
 now gives some error 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:10.440
 again a long light bulb 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:12.450
 says that one cat issued she 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.530
 will go in a circle or will issue 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:19.670
 other trouble codes still have 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:22.700
 In this case, it gives 2122 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:28.620
 which means that some problem 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:30.900
 engine speed signal to 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.020
 stop diagnostics just turn off 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.020
 ignition 

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:44.340
 if you have no light bulb then you can 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.470
 make your own business 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.870
 any LED in series 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:54.830
 turn on resistance I took 1 kilo to you 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:58.640
 impedance and connect it 

00:03:54.830 --> 00:04:01.710
 Here I took the red black wire 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:08.040
 red should connect to the plus 

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:17.430
 and black should connect here 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:21.239
 brown chips to this wire so 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:23.610
 red hooked plus and if these are chips 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:29.220
 no, it can be connected to any plus 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:31.500
 spot on black turned on diagnostic 

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.630
 the wire will need another wire like 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:38.030
 and in the version if the light bulb is present 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:38.030
 so that it could be closed to ground 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:47.390
 ignition keys 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:57.770
 lit bulb close to ground on 

00:04:47.390 --> 00:05:01.850
 5 seconds, let it start 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:06.820
 diagnostics what to do if this 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:06.820
 chips are not visible there is an option 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:17.720
 here under the hood there is such a big 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:21.140
 chip here is the top yellow-black 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:27.170
 provodochek he goes just so to this 

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:29.440
 brown chips this is a wire line here 

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:29.440
 here he is 

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:36.429
 yellow-black on the other hand already 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:40.389
 for some reason, yellow here you can also 

00:05:36.429 --> 00:05:46.269
 connect itself with a light bulb to close 

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:48.519
 its diagnostics will occur if 

00:05:46.269 --> 00:05:51.639
 do you not have this wire? 

00:05:48.519 --> 00:05:53.979
 you can connect to the 22 foot itself 

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:56.559
 control unit for this motor 

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:58.959
 years very little special help they to you 

00:05:56.559 --> 00:06:02.859
 can not do anything when and lay out 

00:05:58.959 --> 00:06:05.319
 video description to erase codes 

00:06:02.859 --> 00:06:08.619
 faults need to turn off the ignition 

00:06:05.319 --> 00:06:10.059
 and close this wire to the ground and 

00:06:08.619 --> 00:06:12.519
 turn on the ignition 

00:06:10.059 --> 00:06:15.129
 hold closed about five 

00:06:12.519 --> 00:06:17.889
 seconds and disconnect the wire one more 

00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:23.349
 the way how to erase their mistakes is 

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:25.299
 disconnect the battery thanks 

00:06:23.349 --> 00:06:27.839
 watched hope the video was for you 

00:06:25.299 --> 00:06:27.839
 useful
