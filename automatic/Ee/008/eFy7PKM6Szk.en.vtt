 since always it is the one who has me 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:03.880
 did I really liked this game I gave him 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.940
 worshiped at a ninja game and then me who 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.890
 do not have too much infiltration and discretion 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.770
 you think you there I played them well but 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:15.130
 I hung the very first dead gold 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:16.780
 alive ever but this game concept of 

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.250
 fight where it always takes against and I 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.260
 find it's me when I played at 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.239
 4t in life four online i 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.280
 found too much paid too shit and it got me 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:27.489
 angry I stopped it disgusted me with 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:30.730
 cerium and final fantasy 7 a new 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:32.980
 When there is no instruction but but 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:34.300
 try t are a little bit scratched especially 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:37.480
 first as a part each time 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:39.430
 I buy some final fantasy that contains 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.010
 contain several CDs each time 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:44.530
 This is the first CD which is managed 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.810
 two others the two or three have the 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:50.650
 more in the vast majority of cases they 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.850
 are nickels bah yes normal and people 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.680
 when they resell it so let's not say too much 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.569
 raised the game and that in the end they even 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.390
 not finished prove it 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:04:00.150
 and v finally that's my opinion 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:06.180
 personal on a clip a sega game 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:07.409
 saturn shockwave aso made by electronic 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.810
 arts that yeah that's right he was 

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:12.799
 like that the logo of electronic arts this 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.799
 what was ugly 

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:19.139
 dragon ball z budokai tradition 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:21.959
 collector there are the ways the teachers 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:25.410
 month the original official levels 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:26.789
 japanese in the game yes i do not know 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:31.169
 what I read the jacket can they 

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:35.400
 had points played 2 a game installs a 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:37.560
 game xbox star wars battlefront ii as well 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.680
 hard enough to find that it's more 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:45.750
 hard to find on xbox on the ps2 and 

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:47.039
 360 games for success finally in 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:48.660
 one I have already made in 

00:04:47.039 --> 00:04:50.729
 success tomb raider anniversary 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.410
 on the other hand I the prophets brave beast 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:55.650
 it's easy and there is too much this game 

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:58.050
 off warriors toll that's the believe that 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.370
 it's the game no it's the title of the day 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:02.220
 what am I saying I'm bad 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:05.789
 That's it for the week's purchases 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:08.880
 so before anything that says breaks to 

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:11.409
 the chain of the week the chain of the 

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.449
