00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
keep my moisturizer in the bathroom so

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.700 
keep my moisturizer in the bathroom so
it<00:01:33.240> has<00:01:33.360> a<00:01:33.390> lot<00:01:33.570> of<00:01:33.630> time<00:01:33.780> to<00:01:33.930> sink<00:01:34.140> in<00:01:34.290> before<00:01:34.470> i

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
it has a lot of time to sink in before i

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.410 
it has a lot of time to sink in before i
actually<00:01:34.979> do<00:01:35.220> my<00:01:35.310> makeup<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.850> one<00:01:36.000> i<00:01:36.030> use
