00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.620
 Why 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.640
 from retracted pattern not so easy 

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:26.460
 liberate you finally comes with 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:30.869
 this world does not think about it 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.099
 a wonderful investigation of something 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.260
 clearly what makes you like then 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.180
 Dandruff falls from the eyes that much 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.340
 from our current monogram 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.840
 is transported to the next 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.030
 people we are with and 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.470
 even to our children where we go 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.460
 unaware that's it 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:47.160
 is transported 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.730
 a study that shows with a half 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.670
 year is already a child in the situation 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.489
 such a screen to look at and 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.680
 then you have on his monitor 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:00.809
 pictured like that already something and mountain 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.760
 and then came a little yellow male 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.530
 how it crawled in the trickfilm and that 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.240
 This mountain high and had a lot to 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.369
 do and snort and slipped parma 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.830
 back and then it came at some point 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.570
 high and six months old babies 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.300
 the earlier on, that looked at first 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.550
 sequence second sequence again the mountain 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.320
 that little yellow male again 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.780
 what wanted up there and then can be small 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.040
 green and helped and behind 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.490
 pushed and then the two came 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.320
 better high second sequence frit 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.060
 Sequence, the baby has also patient 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.830
 This has also endured 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.900
 looked again at the little yellow 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.240
 The guy wanted to go back to the mountain again 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.790
 up and then came up a blue and 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.350
 it has pushed down the baby 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.090
 also looked at then you have all 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.280
 those babies who looked at this 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.460
 back set to a table and intends 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.770
 them a little green and a little one 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.270
 blue male from the movie you 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.400
 had just set up 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.159
 Look what takes it now are 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.690
 that babies in the age not that 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.730
 take what you do not like 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.720
 all children all babies in the age of 

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:04.000
 six months 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.420
 After watching these three movie sequences 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.460
 have seen the little green 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:12.520
 in support, no one comes from 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:14.080
 us as consumer to the world it comes 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.380
 none of us as brutal 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.450
 Reckless egocentric to the world 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.160
 but that must somehow arise like that 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.160
 and that is what is happening and that is that 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.440
 happy message to all of you here 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.600
 They are as educators as parents 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.210
 Much much sooner than we do 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:33.700
 have thought so far can the 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:36.070
 same experiment with the same children 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.560
 Six months later, when the one year 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:39.790
 old are repeat 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.290
 Then they are sitting there again 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.390
 the three sequences and then you give 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.130
 him again the little green again the 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:46.630
 small blue in front of the square and up 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.450
 once are ten to 20 percent of 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:54.310
 Children at once with one year 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:55.570
 they take the down thrust so now it is 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.160
 the question that can not yet yes 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:59.310
 speak of who did that have 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.069
 learned 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:04.470
 and then they notice something systemic 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:07.170
 thinking means then they notice where we are in 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.260
 instant with our knowledge and 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:13.739
 stuck our thinking 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:15.930
 they have observed this in these 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:18.870
 family system in which they grow up 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:20.880
 is there anybody who succeeded 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:23.040
 within this family system 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.599
 very successful at the expense of others 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:26.910
 enforce and now they still remain 

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:29.400
 whether that would be useful for 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:31.440
 such a little child and whether it is biological 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:35.310
 would be useful if the after the 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:36.989
 that would not do that to children 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.060
 depend on those who succeed 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:42.420
 are 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:45.840
 So these kids are just as we 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:47.790
 is the first happy message second 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.130
 Embassy is all children come with 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.660
 an incredible openness to the world 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.730
 with a brain what so many 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:56.519
 offers connections because it just 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:59.670
 No genetic programs are available 

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:02.880
 would know like a human brain 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:04.350
 would use because the genetic 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.209
 programs can not know if 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:08.250
 this child before 

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:09.390
 was born in the Middle Ages 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.269
 were already the same genetic 

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:14.130
 access programs all over the world or 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:16.140
 400,000 years since we had already 

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:18.479
 the same genetic programs or 

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:21.239
 whether this child today as it's the mother 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:23.850
 in the polar circle or as a small amazonas 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:25.590
 indians in brazil or as 

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:27.120
 small Chinese in China comes to the world 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.680
 the genetic programs know that 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.370
 not and that's why they start us 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.740
 People 

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.960
 that's the big evolutionary one 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:37.500
 achievement with a brain out with 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:39.419
 where you can all too much too many 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.490
 nerve cells have a third at the beginning 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:43.340
 they all have more in their minds 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:47.010
 had left as it is today 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:48.630
 that was before birth, so to speak 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:51.419
 had the genetic programs 

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:54.479
 overestimated in what is needed 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:56.610
 for a good human brain and such 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:58.229
 we are going to surpluses in the world 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:00.330
 sent as well as that looks with the 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:02.700
 genetically with the behavioral patterns of 

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:04.560
 we will be much too much on 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:07.460
 initially provided behind 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:09.390
 it starts in the brain stem and then 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:10.220
 sequentially over the different ones 

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:12.740
 regions and them 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:14.930
 I can only wish front up frontal 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:16.760
 her because that will never be on there 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:19.660
 always provided there could 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:24.260
 you also around life again around 

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:26.300
 think and feel if there is only one 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:28.460
 reason for that would be strong enough 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:30.560
 Now we come to the other point 

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:32.210
 all children start at the beginning of their day 

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:34.910
 life and even before the 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:38.090
 you have two years of experience, too 

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:40.400
 all made and they are totally banal 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:45.560
 as long as children still big in a mother 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:47.000
 they will grow first and secondly 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.530
 are they connected that's the two 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.690
 basic experience that everyone has 

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:53.360
 from these two basic experiences 

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:55.940
 growth or from the basic experience 

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:57.920
 growth then becomes something that is also in the 

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:59.660
 brain anchored as commitments already 

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:01.100
 Experienced will anchor in the brain and there 

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:03.140
 is there even this so-called 

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:05.270
 curiosity system what with certain 

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:08.690
 Transmitter works dopamin belongs 

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:10.610
 to it and this system ensures that 

00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:12.470
 get in turin due to 

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:14.300
 But experience has only emerged 

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:16.220
 that then ensures that a child if 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:17.690
 it goes to the world and hopes 

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:20.090
 that there is something out there 

00:06:17.690 --> 00:06:22.460
 There is a desire to discover and shape it 

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:24.200
 grow it wants to show that it can do something 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:27.320
 It wants to find tasks in which it 

00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:28.720
 It can grow autonomously and and 

00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:31.370
 also to be free 

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:32.800
 the second great experience before the 

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:35.810
 birth connectedness 

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:37.729
 but it is deeply experienced in the brain 

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:39.220
 Anchored also there is then one 

00:06:37.729 --> 00:06:41.060
 system that is the so-called 

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:43.850
 binding system works with others 

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:45.650
 oxytocin prolactin and 

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:47.930
 this system is also formed 

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:49.520
 depending on experience prenatal 

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:51.050
 and then each child comes to the world 

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:53.240
 in the hope that it is out there 

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:55.700
 somehow welcome it that someone 

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:57.770
 he takes it in the arm takes the im 

00:06:55.700 --> 00:07:00.410
 Give privacy and security and then 

00:06:57.770 --> 00:07:03.020
 these kids go to the world and 

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:04.669
 make the most important 

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:08.030
 Experiences are always closed up 

00:07:04.669 --> 00:07:10.430
 only succeed in this area in this area 

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:12.440
 to bring it together 

00:07:10.430 --> 00:07:14.210
 because that's their basic form it's yes 

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:16.460
 gone at least nine months at least 

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:17.030
 you were connected at the same time and is 

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:19.820
 grown 

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:22.220
 Now you get out of there and then it fits 

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:23.390
 the mother does not like it or so 

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:27.300
 the dad 

00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:29.940
 or somebody there you will either 

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:32.190
 not taken as you are there catch 

00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:33.810
 adults at a rum to achieve 

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:36.030
 because they want you to become like them 

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:38.700
 or how she liked that or 

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:41.910
 become or one becomes 

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:45.240
 with one, so to speak , I always call that 

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:47.760
 like spider monkeys love crushed in 

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:50.670
 his need to grow because 

00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:53.180
 it's kind of running in the honey title 

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:57.140
 the connectedness 

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:57.140
 both catastrophic
