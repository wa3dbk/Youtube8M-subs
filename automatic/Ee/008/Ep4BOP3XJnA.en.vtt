we're going to close it so we're gonna
go<00:00:42.750> up<00:00:42.809> to<00:00:42.870> tools<00:00:43.110> up<00:00:43.379> here<00:00:43.590> we<00:00:44.280> go<00:00:44.399> DHCP<00:00:45.120> you

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
go up to tools up here we go DHCP you

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.690 
go up to tools up here we go DHCP you
can<00:00:46.170> open<00:00:46.469> up<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.680> MMC<00:00:47.450> now<00:00:49.280> the<00:00:50.280> role<00:00:50.610> is

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
can open up the MMC now the role is

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.970 
can open up the MMC now the role is
installed<00:00:51.059> but<00:00:51.660> we<00:00:51.840> have<00:00:52.110> to<00:00:52.230> configure<00:00:52.500> scope

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
installed but we have to configure scope

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.270 
installed but we have to configure scope
and<00:00:53.190> scope<00:00:53.789> options<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.449> then<00:00:55.350> also<00:00:55.739> we<00:00:56.100> have

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
and scope options and then also we have

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.819 
and scope options and then also we have
to<00:00:56.399> authorize<00:00:56.579> it<00:00:57.090> so<00:00:57.989> what<00:00:58.410> we<00:00:58.500> need<00:00:58.620> to<00:00:58.710> do

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
to authorize it so what we need to do

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.799 
to authorize it so what we need to do
first<00:00:59.100> is<00:00:59.399> you<00:00:59.910> can<00:01:00.000> expand<00:01:00.390> you<00:01:00.539> can<00:01:00.600> see

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
first is you can expand you can see

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:02.060 
first is you can expand you can see
there's<00:01:00.960> a<00:01:01.050> little<00:01:01.230> red<00:01:01.350> down<00:01:01.680> arrows<00:01:01.980> it

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
there's a little red down arrows it

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.410 
there's a little red down arrows it
means<00:01:02.190> it's<00:01:02.340> not<00:01:02.370> really<00:01:02.640> working<00:01:02.820> yet<00:01:03.120> it's

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
means it's not really working yet it's

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.359 
means it's not really working yet it's
it's<00:01:04.080> almost<00:01:04.320> ready<00:01:04.680> so<00:01:04.949> go<00:01:05.040> ahead<00:01:05.100> and<00:01:05.280> right

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
it's almost ready so go ahead and right

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.010 
it's almost ready so go ahead and right

creative scope next case is the range of
IP<00:01:19.680> addresses<00:01:19.830> we<00:01:20.280> want<00:01:20.430> to<00:01:20.490> allow<00:01:20.640> this

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880

this is where we tell this scope what to

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.240 
this is where we tell this scope what to
hand<00:02:44.820> out<00:02:45.000> for<00:02:45.600> you<00:02:45.810> know<00:02:45.930> their<00:02:46.200> gateway<00:02:46.590> and

DNS servers and everything so to add an
IP<00:02:49.440> address<00:02:49.860> for<00:02:50.070> a<00:02:50.130> router<00:02:50.340> use<00:02:50.580> my<00:02:50.760> clients

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.210 
IP address for a router use my clients

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:52.610 
IP address for a router use my clients
so<00:02:51.570> this<00:02:51.690> in<00:02:51.840> our<00:02:51.990> case<00:02:52.170> is<00:02:52.290> gonna<00:02:52.410> be<00:02:52.500> our

so this in our case is gonna be our

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.290 
so this in our case is gonna be our
pfSense<00:02:53.130> box<00:02:53.400> which<00:02:53.640> is<00:02:54.020> 192<00:02:55.020> 168<00:02:55.400> 1.1<00:02:56.400> go

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:29.010 
what we need to do is authorize it you

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.380 
what we need to do is authorize it you
can<00:03:29.130> see<00:03:29.310> here<00:03:29.490> what<00:03:29.610> I<00:03:29.640> clicked<00:03:29.940> on<00:03:30.060> this<00:03:30.150> is

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
can see here what I clicked on this is

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.990 
can see here what I clicked on this is
must<00:03:31.110> be<00:03:31.200> authorized<00:03:31.650> so<00:03:31.980> if<00:03:32.430> we<00:03:32.580> I<00:03:32.610> think<00:03:32.820> it's

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
must be authorized so if we I think it's

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.180 
must be authorized so if we I think it's
up<00:03:33.120> here<00:03:33.330> if<00:03:33.450> we<00:03:33.570> right<00:03:33.780> click<00:03:33.920> and<00:03:34.920> do

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
up here if we right click and do

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.770 
up here if we right click and do
authorize<00:03:36.620> and<00:03:37.620> we<00:03:37.830> can<00:03:37.980> refresh<00:03:38.510> it's<00:03:39.510> green

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
authorize and we can refresh it's green

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.350 
authorize and we can refresh it's green
so<00:03:40.130> now<00:03:41.130> this<00:03:41.340> server<00:03:41.580> should<00:03:41.850> be<00:03:42.000> handing<00:03:42.300> out

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
so now this server should be handing out

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.110 
so now this server should be handing out
IP<00:03:42.570> addresses<00:03:43.200> if<00:03:43.350> we<00:03:43.560> have<00:03:44.430> a<00:03:44.460> computer<00:03:44.820> that

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:45.120 
IP addresses if we have a computer that

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:47.330 
IP addresses if we have a computer that
boots<00:03:45.360> up<00:03:45.540> and<00:03:45.810> does<00:03:46.500> not<00:03:46.680> have<00:03:46.860> a<00:03:46.920> static<00:03:47.220> IP

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
boots up and does not have a static IP

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.460 
boots up and does not have a static IP
address<00:03:47.960> reservations<00:03:48.960> if<00:03:49.110> we're<00:03:49.230> gonna<00:03:49.320> be

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:49.470

like I really like to do reservations

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:55.550 
like I really like to do reservations
for<00:03:54.030> printers<00:03:54.420> we'll<00:03:55.080> be<00:03:55.170> doing<00:03:55.380> that<00:03:55.410> later

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
for printers we'll be doing that later

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
but once it's booted up I will change it

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:18.860 
but once it's booted up I will change it
wait<00:04:17.150> who<00:04:18.150> would<00:04:18.299> do<00:04:18.390> is<00:04:18.510> I'm<00:04:18.600> gonna<00:04:18.720> go<00:04:18.840> ahead

before I want to switch it over DHCP we

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:29.020 
before I want to switch it over DHCP we
should<00:04:26.600> get<00:04:26.810> a<00:04:27.050> new<00:04:27.770> IP<00:04:27.979> address<00:04:28.430> here<00:04:28.639> if<00:04:28.940> we
