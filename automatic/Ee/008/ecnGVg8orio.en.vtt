00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:42.560 
to pencil out the new high speed quad it
also<00:01:41.759> probably<00:01:42.240> wasn't<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.509> right

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
also probably wasn't the right

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.460 
also probably wasn't the right

personality for what we want

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.690 
personality for what we want
it<00:01:45.470> is<00:01:45.650> an<00:01:45.770> interesting<00:01:46.040> story<00:01:46.430> in<00:01:46.580> itself

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:46.700 
it is an interesting story in itself

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.520 
it is an interesting story in itself
they<00:01:47.150> were<00:01:47.270> able<00:01:47.420> to<00:01:47.600> reuse<00:01:47.960> all<00:01:48.140> those<00:01:48.290> things
