00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:15.100
 I have always believed that for the 60s 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:18.160
 years or before maybe I would not be 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:19.840
 doing I have always thought so look 

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.240
 the French presented problems of 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.950
 broadcast since child stopped watching with his 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.770
 right eye due to optic neuritis 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:28.660
 and the view of his left eye was going 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.520
 degenerating due to insufficiency 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.460
 limbic in its cornea of origin 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.260
 unknown 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.090
 thanks to the limbo of the eye without 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.800
 vision remained intact it could be 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.379
 make this patient a transplant in the 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.989
 eye with limbic insufficiency miguel 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.820
 regained 90 percent of the vision and 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.399
 so it stays five years later 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.230
 being his case one of the followings to 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.720
 longer term of Spain in 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.559
 regeneration of the corneal epithelium 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.820
 by treatment with cells 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.370
 mother obtained from limbo 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.050
 the limb is the ocular region in charge 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.700
 of the regeneration of the epithelium of 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.190
 epithelium is the most superficial layer of 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.449
 the cornea there resides the stem cells 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.510
 who are in charge of this 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:10.160
 epithelial regeneration when it originated 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.440
 limbic insufficiency is that you're 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.660
 stem cells have been destroyed then 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.210
 the epithelium is pacified and begins 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:19.040
 This prevents neovascular be lifted between 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.290
 light correctly to the inside of the eye 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.330
 the most advanced treatment for 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:26.119
 Limbic insufficiency is a transplant 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.680
 with stem cells the technique begins 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:30.050
 with a small biopsy of about two 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.090
 millimeters of the donor limb being a 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.490
 so small sample does not involve affectation 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.890
 for the healthy eye the stem cells 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.100
 obtained from this extraction is grown 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.330
 in the cell therapy gmp laboratory 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.130
 once the 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.710
 adequate growth of this population 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:47.600
 cell after two or three weeks, 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:49.820
 obtained stem cells are transplanted to 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.770
 an amniotic membrane where they are grown 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.570
 again until you get a population 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.190
 enough cell to transplant to 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.510
 those affected through this same 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:16.569
 membrane 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:19.269
 [Music] 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:21.219
 these cells are covering the 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:23.709
 ocular surface staying in limbo 

00:02:21.219 --> 00:02:25.810
 affected and implanted in it until 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:27.219
 regenerate the damaged epithelium and return to 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.180
 create a corneal surface 

00:02:27.219 --> 00:02:35.490
 transparent and homogeneous 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:37.590
 [Music] 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:39.540
 in cases where both eyes are 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.250
 affected, a transplant is used in 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:44.220
 stem cells of an immune relative 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.870
 compatible or from an organ donor the 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.640
 regeneration of corneas through 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:49.830
 transplant of adult stem cells 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.690
 limbic is a technique that 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:55.620
 ophthalmologists of the university clinic 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:57.239
 of Navarra apply for 8 years 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.260
 and now I feel like a person 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:02.900
 totally useful completely independent 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.040
 and with a lot of life 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:09.200
 I'm going to leave it 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.200
 Right now we are the car 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.030
 yes
