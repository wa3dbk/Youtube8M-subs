00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
complaint about the size there even

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.610 
complaint about the size there even
though<00:00:55.890> it's<00:00:56.039> small<00:00:56.280> it's<00:00:57.050> fairly<00:00:58.050> easy<00:00:58.230> to

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
though it's small it's fairly easy to

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.439 
though it's small it's fairly easy to
read<00:00:58.859> because<00:00:59.280> you<00:00:59.399> have<00:00:59.520> a<00:00:59.550> lot<00:00:59.730> of<00:00:59.760> contrast

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
read because you have a lot of contrast

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.030 
read because you have a lot of contrast
with<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.780> white<00:01:00.809> on<00:01:01.079> black<00:01:01.530> markers<00:01:03.979> it's<00:01:04.979> a

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
with the white on black markers it's a

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.760 
with the white on black markers it's a
quartz<00:01:05.400> movement<00:01:05.909> so<00:01:06.119> it's<00:01:06.270> accurate<00:01:06.770> the

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
quartz movement so it's accurate the

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.800 
quartz movement so it's accurate the
water<00:01:07.950> resistance<00:01:08.549> is<00:01:08.700> given<00:01:09.000> as<00:01:09.150> thirty

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
water resistance is given as thirty

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.620 
water resistance is given as thirty
meters<00:01:10.229> so<00:01:10.710> it's<00:01:10.890> not<00:01:11.100> really<00:01:12.030> intended<00:01:12.360> for

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
meters so it's not really intended for

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.050 
meters so it's not really intended for
like<00:01:13.110> diving<00:01:13.590> swimming<00:01:14.040> or<00:01:14.490> anything<00:01:14.760> like

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
like diving swimming or anything like

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.429 
like diving swimming or anything like
that<00:01:15.090> so<00:01:15.659> that's<00:01:16.320> not<00:01:16.619> what<00:01:17.009> its<00:01:17.159> purpose<00:01:18.439> this

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
that so that's not what its purpose this

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.800 
that so that's not what its purpose this
is<00:01:19.500> probably<00:01:19.920> a<00:01:19.979> good<00:01:20.159> watch<00:01:20.430> to<00:01:20.790> like<00:01:21.299> wear<00:01:21.659> to

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
is probably a good watch to like wear to

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.560 
is probably a good watch to like wear to
work<00:01:22.020> or<00:01:22.560> if<00:01:23.159> you're<00:01:23.549> in<00:01:23.670> a<00:01:23.759> job<00:01:24.030> where<00:01:24.360> you

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
work or if you're in a job where you

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.840 
work or if you're in a job where you
need<00:01:24.780> an<00:01:24.960> analog<00:01:25.470> watch<00:01:25.770> with<00:01:26.130> a<00:01:26.159> second<00:01:26.640> hand

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
need an analog watch with a second hand

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.240 
need an analog watch with a second hand
this<00:01:27.689> would<00:01:27.840> probably<00:01:28.200> fit<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.710> bill<00:01:28.890> pretty

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
this would probably fit the bill pretty

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.990 
this would probably fit the bill pretty
good<00:01:30.229> the<00:01:31.229> only<00:01:31.350> thing<00:01:32.070> that<00:01:32.220> I<00:01:32.369> found<00:01:32.759> about

good the only thing that I found about

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.410 
good the only thing that I found about
the<00:01:33.210> watch<00:01:33.360> that<00:01:33.630> I<00:01:33.810> didn't<00:01:34.170> like<00:01:34.350> was<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:35.420> way

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
the watch that I didn't like was the way

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.580 
the watch that I didn't like was the way
the<00:01:36.600> band<00:01:36.869> is<00:01:37.140> put<00:01:37.409> on<00:01:37.560> it's<00:01:38.869> one<00:01:39.869> piece<00:01:40.140> band

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
the band is put on it's one piece band

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.859 
the band is put on it's one piece band
or<00:01:41.310> excuse<00:01:41.700> me<00:01:41.850> it's<00:01:41.970> a<00:01:42.060> two<00:01:42.270> piece<00:01:42.509> band

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
or excuse me it's a two piece band

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.350 
or excuse me it's a two piece band
that's<00:01:43.740> held<00:01:44.070> on<00:01:44.250> with<00:01:44.430> the<00:01:44.520> spring<00:01:44.850> pins<00:01:45.149> and

looking watch with the military style

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.839 
looking watch with the military style
it's<00:02:24.769> accurate<00:02:25.769> because<00:02:26.280> of<00:02:26.400> the<00:02:26.459> courts

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849

it's accurate because of the courts
everything<00:02:27.629> it's<00:02:28.189> really<00:02:29.189> lightweight<00:02:29.459> so<00:02:29.700> if

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
everything it's really lightweight so if

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.729 
everything it's really lightweight so if
you<00:02:30.209> don't<00:02:30.389> like<00:02:30.569> a<00:02:30.599> heavy<00:02:30.989> watch<00:02:31.319> you<00:02:31.560> don't

even want to know you're wearing a watch
this<00:02:33.359> would<00:02:33.510> be<00:02:33.659> the<00:02:33.810> one<00:02:33.959> to<00:02:34.109> go<00:02:34.260> with<00:02:34.469> I<00:02:34.620> think

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
this would be the one to go with I think

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.470 
this would be the one to go with I think
this<00:02:37.620> is<00:02:37.739> available<00:02:38.010> on<00:02:38.579> Amazon<00:02:39.180> right<00:02:39.420> now

for<00:02:40.790> $18.99<00:02:41.790> I<00:02:42.030> believe<00:02:42.359> the<00:02:42.569> list<00:02:42.810> price<00:02:43.049> is

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:43.109 
for $18.99 I believe the list price is

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:47.839 
for $18.99 I believe the list price is
34<00:02:44.010> 95<00:02:44.730> or<00:02:45.060> somewhere<00:02:45.599> around<00:02:45.720> there<00:02:46.159> so<00:02:47.159> I

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:47.849 
34 95 or somewhere around there so I

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:49.729 
34 95 or somewhere around there so I
