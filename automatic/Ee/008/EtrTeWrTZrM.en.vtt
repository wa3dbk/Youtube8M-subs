00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:04.460 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.709 

we've<00:00:05.460> gone<00:00:05.609> over<00:00:06.120> the<00:00:06.750> seven<00:00:07.080> natural<00:00:07.259> notes

00:00:08.709 --> 00:00:08.719 
we've gone over the seven natural notes

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:11.839 
we've gone over the seven natural notes
now<00:00:09.719> the<00:00:10.349> next<00:00:10.679> step<00:00:10.889> is<00:00:11.130> to<00:00:11.309> recognize<00:00:11.550> the

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
now the next step is to recognize the

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.220 
now the next step is to recognize the
notes<00:00:12.240> that<00:00:12.389> are<00:00:12.480> in<00:00:12.509> between<00:00:14.900> you<00:00:15.900> don't<00:00:16.080> need

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
notes that are in between you don't need

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.580 
notes that are in between you don't need
to<00:00:16.320> rush<00:00:16.560> into<00:00:16.800> this<00:00:17.840> but<00:00:18.840> if<00:00:19.170> you're

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
to rush into this but if you're

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.380 
to rush into this but if you're
ambitious<00:00:19.770> and<00:00:20.400> you<00:00:20.550> really<00:00:20.910> have<00:00:21.150> the

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
ambitious and you really have the

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.439 
ambitious and you really have the
natural<00:00:21.779> notes<00:00:22.020> down<00:00:22.640> which<00:00:23.640> means<00:00:23.939> you<00:00:24.269> can

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
natural notes down which means you can

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.990 
natural notes down which means you can
pick<00:00:25.109> any<00:00:25.350> of<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.769> seven<00:00:26.070> natural<00:00:26.340> notes<00:00:26.789> from

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
pick any of the seven natural notes from

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.640 
pick any of the seven natural notes from
the<00:00:27.150> C<00:00:27.330> major<00:00:27.510> scale<00:00:27.660> and<00:00:28.199> play<00:00:28.500> it

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
the C major scale and play it

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.849 
the C major scale and play it
immediately<00:00:28.769> in<00:00:29.429> a<00:00:30.359> pretty<00:00:30.869> rapid<00:00:31.289> pace<00:00:31.320> from

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
immediately in a pretty rapid pace from

immediately in a pretty rapid pace from
string<00:00:32.219> to<00:00:32.250> string<00:00:34.760> then<00:00:35.760> you're<00:00:35.910> ready<00:00:36.210> to

it's<00:00:51.539> pretty<00:00:51.809> cool<00:00:52.760> so<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:54.090> brief<00:00:54.570> explanation

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
it's pretty cool so a brief explanation

make<00:01:24.630> it<00:01:24.840> easy<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.770> play<00:01:26.040> you<00:01:26.549> don't<00:01:26.670> have<00:01:26.759> to

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
make it easy to play you don't have to

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.910 
make it easy to play you don't have to
play<00:01:27.570> on<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.840> Black<00:01:28.049> Keys<00:01:28.290> you<00:01:28.530> can<00:01:28.560> just<00:01:28.770> play

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
play on the Black Keys you can just play

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.649 
play on the Black Keys you can just play
on<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.159> white<00:01:29.790> keys<00:01:30.030> of<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.270> piano<00:01:30.420> and

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
on the white keys of the piano and

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:36.230 
on the white keys of the piano and
you'll<00:01:30.869> get<00:01:30.990> this<00:01:31.229> sound<00:01:31.470> C<00:01:32.040> D<00:01:32.490> D<00:01:32.880> F<00:01:33.180> G<00:01:33.210> a<00:01:33.840> B<00:01:34.350> C<00:01:35.240> so

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
you'll get this sound C D D F G a B C so

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.090 
you'll get this sound C D D F G a B C so
or<00:01:36.479> in<00:01:36.750> order<00:01:36.930> to<00:01:37.020> make<00:01:37.259> that<00:01:37.409> sound

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
or in order to make that sound

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.130 
or in order to make that sound
they<00:01:38.250> had<00:01:38.430> what's<00:01:38.939> called<00:01:39.030> natural<00:01:39.900> half

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
they had what's called natural half

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.789 
they had what's called natural half
steps<00:01:41.930> intervals<00:01:42.930> are<00:01:43.110> used<00:01:43.380> to<00:01:43.530> create

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
steps intervals are used to create

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.929 
steps intervals are used to create
scales<00:01:44.159> so<00:01:45.000> if<00:01:45.990> this<00:01:46.170> is<00:01:46.350> a<00:01:46.380> half<00:01:46.619> step<00:01:46.880> this<00:01:47.880> is

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
scales so if this is a half step this is

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.420 
scales so if this is a half step this is
a<00:01:48.090> whole<00:01:48.329> step<00:01:48.570> so<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.680> order<00:01:50.040> of<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:50.220> major

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
a whole step so the order of a major

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.889 
a whole step so the order of a major
scale<00:01:50.790> is<00:01:51.439> whole<00:01:52.439> step<00:01:52.759> whole<00:01:53.759> step<00:01:53.840> half<00:01:54.840> step

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
scale is whole step whole step half step

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.719

you<00:02:06.630> play<00:02:06.870> that<00:02:07.020> pattern<00:02:07.470> from<00:02:07.860> any<00:02:08.179> string<00:02:09.179> or

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
you play that pattern from any string or

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.199 
you play that pattern from any string or
any<00:02:10.020> note<00:02:10.319> location<00:02:11.100> and<00:02:11.370> you'll<00:02:11.880> have<00:02:12.060> the

00:02:12.199 --> 00:02:12.209 
any note location and you'll have the

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.410 
any note location and you'll have the
major<00:02:12.420> scale<00:02:12.810> for<00:02:12.840> that<00:02:13.410> note<00:02:14.250> so<00:02:14.819> this<00:02:15.000> is<00:02:15.150> G

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
major scale for that note so this is G

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.260 
major scale for that note so this is G
and<00:02:16.230> we<00:02:16.290> play<00:02:16.500> that<00:02:16.650> pattern<00:02:17.069> starting<00:02:17.790> here

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
and we play that pattern starting here

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.949 
and we play that pattern starting here

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
so getting back to the notes this is C

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.320 
so getting back to the notes this is C
this<00:02:37.850> is<00:02:38.360> D<00:02:39.130> any<00:02:40.130> note<00:02:40.700> that's<00:02:40.910> directly

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
this is D any note that's directly

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.350 
this is D any note that's directly

up above that F F sharp G G flat so you

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:36.140 
up above that F F sharp G G flat so you
can<00:03:34.480> see<00:03:34.629> where<00:03:34.780> this<00:03:34.840> is<00:03:34.900> going

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
can see where this is going

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.630 
can see where this is going
um<00:03:37.150> if<00:03:37.480> you've<00:03:38.349> learned<00:03:38.620> the<00:03:38.859> seven<00:03:39.219> notes<00:03:39.430> and

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640 
um if you've learned the seven notes and

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.099 
um if you've learned the seven notes and
you<00:03:39.700> know<00:03:39.849> them<00:03:40.000> really<00:03:40.120> well<00:03:40.269> all<00:03:40.689> the<00:03:40.989> other

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:41.109 
you know them really well all the other

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:45.059 
you know them really well all the other
notes<00:03:41.439> are<00:03:41.829> a<00:03:41.890> sharp<00:03:42.459> or<00:03:42.670> a<00:03:42.760> flat<00:03:43.739> from<00:03:44.739> a<00:03:44.859> note

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:45.069 
notes are a sharp or a flat from a note

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:48.780 
notes are a sharp or a flat from a note
that<00:03:45.280> you<00:03:45.459> know<00:03:46.230> so<00:03:47.230> it's<00:03:47.409> pretty<00:03:47.590> easy<00:03:47.829> you

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:48.790 
that you know so it's pretty easy you

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.280 
that you know so it's pretty easy you
know<00:03:48.909> what<00:03:49.780> note<00:03:49.930> is<00:03:49.959> that

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
know what note is that

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:52.229 
know what note is that
well<00:03:50.680> I<00:03:50.709> know<00:03:50.920> that<00:03:51.040> this<00:03:51.310> one's<00:03:51.489> G<00:03:51.790> so<00:03:52.120> that's

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 
well I know that this one's G so that's

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:54.390 
well I know that this one's G so that's
G<00:03:52.510> sharp<00:03:53.069> boom

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:54.400 
G sharp boom

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.479 
G sharp boom
and<00:03:55.269> it<00:03:55.420> gets<00:03:55.510> easier<00:03:55.750> pretty<00:03:56.680> soon<00:03:56.950> you<00:03:57.459> just

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:57.489 
and it gets easier pretty soon you just

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:00.059 
and it gets easier pretty soon you just
know<00:03:57.879> you<00:03:58.150> can<00:03:58.299> see<00:03:58.569> it<00:03:58.659> because<00:03:59.049> that's<00:03:59.769> B

00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:00.069 
know you can see it because that's B

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:04.830 
know you can see it because that's B
flat<00:04:00.900> that's<00:04:01.900> C<00:04:02.139> sharp<00:04:03.090> just<00:04:04.090> because<00:04:04.419> I<00:04:04.659> know

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:04.840 
flat that's C sharp just because I know

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.039 
flat that's C sharp just because I know
where<00:04:05.109> C<00:04:05.290> is<00:04:05.639> my<00:04:06.639> brain<00:04:06.939> has<00:04:07.419> kind<00:04:07.750> of<00:04:07.840> grouped

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:08.049 
where C is my brain has kind of grouped

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:10.770 
where C is my brain has kind of grouped
it<00:04:08.200> together<00:04:08.530> and<00:04:08.970> I<00:04:09.970> didn't<00:04:10.239> really<00:04:10.389> spend

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
it together and I didn't really spend

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.009 
it together and I didn't really spend
time<00:04:11.109> memorizing<00:04:11.950> the<00:04:12.669> sharps<00:04:13.239> and<00:04:13.359> flats<00:04:13.450> it

00:04:14.009 --> 00:04:14.019 
time memorizing the sharps and flats it

00:04:14.019 --> 00:04:15.659 
time memorizing the sharps and flats it
just<00:04:14.260> happened<00:04:14.799> because<00:04:14.950> I<00:04:15.099> understand<00:04:15.609> the

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:15.669 
just happened because I understand the

00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:18.509 
just happened because I understand the
concept<00:04:15.939> and<00:04:16.509> I<00:04:17.440> spent<00:04:18.099> so<00:04:18.340> much<00:04:18.459> time

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
concept and I spent so much time

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:20.939 
concept and I spent so much time
learning<00:04:19.060> the<00:04:19.299> natural<00:04:19.660> notes<00:04:19.900> that<00:04:20.650> it<00:04:20.769> just

00:04:20.939 --> 00:04:20.949 
learning the natural notes that it just

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:23.400 
learning the natural notes that it just
kind<00:04:21.190> of<00:04:21.280> became<00:04:22.240> a<00:04:22.539> larger<00:04:23.050> part<00:04:23.320> of

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.410 
kind of became a larger part of

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:27.870 
kind of became a larger part of
something<00:04:23.800> I<00:04:23.889> already<00:04:24.039> knew<00:04:24.430> and<00:04:25.949> I<00:04:26.949> know

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
something I already knew and I know

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.610 
something I already knew and I know
people<00:04:28.090> that<00:04:28.300> still<00:04:28.630> don't<00:04:28.900> know<00:04:29.169> the<00:04:29.440> notes

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
people that still don't know the notes

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:32.790 
people that still don't know the notes
of<00:04:29.830> the<00:04:29.919> neck<00:04:30.510> because<00:04:31.510> the<00:04:32.289> old<00:04:32.470> way<00:04:32.650> of<00:04:32.710> doing

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:32.800 
of the neck because the old way of doing

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:38.760 
of the neck because the old way of doing
it<00:04:33.220> the<00:04:33.960> sharp<00:04:34.960> G<00:04:35.199> sharp<00:04:35.650> a<00:04:36.159> you<00:04:36.849> know<00:04:37.770> it

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:38.770 
it the sharp G sharp a you know it

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:40.529 
it the sharp G sharp a you know it
doesn't<00:04:39.190> teach<00:04:39.370> you<00:04:39.639> the<00:04:40.000> notes<00:04:40.180> of<00:04:40.300> the<00:04:40.360> neck

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:40.539 
doesn't teach you the notes of the neck

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:42.719 
doesn't teach you the notes of the neck
it<00:04:40.720> just<00:04:40.750> teaches<00:04:41.020> you<00:04:41.260> a<00:04:41.289> formula<00:04:41.710> and<00:04:42.130> you're

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:42.729 
it just teaches you a formula and you're

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:45.270 
it just teaches you a formula and you're
attached<00:04:43.060> to<00:04:43.270> that<00:04:43.389> process<00:04:43.960> that's<00:04:44.770> it<00:04:45.070> with

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
attached to that process that's it with

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:50.279 
attached to that process that's it with
the<00:04:45.490> sharps<00:04:45.849> and<00:04:46.000> flats<00:04:48.389> so<00:04:49.389> again<00:04:49.690> go<00:04:50.050> back

00:04:50.279 --> 00:04:50.289 
the sharps and flats so again go back

00:04:50.289 --> 00:04:53.070 
the sharps and flats so again go back
start<00:04:51.159> with<00:04:51.370> C<00:04:51.610> really<00:04:52.240> burn<00:04:52.599> that<00:04:52.780> in<00:04:52.930> your

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
start with C really burn that in your

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:57.060 
start with C really burn that in your
brain<00:04:53.409> B<00:04:54.250> then<00:04:54.729> D<00:04:55.169> then<00:04:56.169> go<00:04:56.440> back<00:04:56.620> and<00:04:56.650> really

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 
brain B then D then go back and really

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:59.730 
brain B then D then go back and really
hone<00:04:57.280> in<00:04:57.310> on<00:04:57.550> F<00:04:57.849> make<00:04:58.479> sure<00:04:58.659> you<00:04:58.780> have<00:04:59.050> F<00:04:59.289> nailed

00:04:59.730 --> 00:04:59.740 
hone in on F make sure you have F nailed

hone in on F make sure you have F nailed
then<00:05:00.460> e<00:05:00.849> then<00:05:01.060> G<00:05:01.510> and<00:05:01.750> then<00:05:01.930> learn<00:05:02.139> a<00:05:02.349> and<00:05:03.030> do

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:04.030 
then e then G and then learn a and do

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:05.670 
then e then G and then learn a and do
this<00:05:04.180> every<00:05:04.360> day<00:05:04.690> as<00:05:04.960> part<00:05:05.169> of<00:05:05.409> your<00:05:05.500> practice

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 
this every day as part of your practice

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.939 
this every day as part of your practice
routine<00:05:05.949> and<00:05:07.169> pretty<00:05:08.169> soon<00:05:08.440> you're<00:05:08.800> going<00:05:08.889> to

00:05:08.939 --> 00:05:08.949 
routine and pretty soon you're going to
