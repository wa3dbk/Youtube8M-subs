00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.259
 hello everyone with you i'm the chef's food 

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:09.450
 finally this wonderful one 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:12.690
 a tablet called nvidia 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.800
 shield doused I know that many were waiting for him 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:19.260
 very much and fortunately I have 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:21.960
 the opportunity to test it and it is very 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.240
 nice well i just waited a long time 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.539
 There are some nuances of this moment . 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.519
 which I really like it well, 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.600
 Of course we will check all these nuances 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.610
 first of all I want to tell you that 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:37.649
 box despite the fact that she is but 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.020
 hid here just opened 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.250
 looked and well then there is something there 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.079
 there is and 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.030
 and shut down ie nothing at all there 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.280
 never touched 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.640
 it's like the first unpacking of this 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.170
 tablet on the right side there is 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.390
 some characteristics 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.570
 but about them I certainly already in the review 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.879
 directly tell and 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:01.770
 let's look at directly myself 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.790
 see even the tablet was closed incorrectly 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:08.939
 box so here and nvidia shield doused 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:12.810
 never see here that is all factory 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:15.439
 all clearly looking at the equipment 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.220
 picking this we go yusbi 

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:21.869
 microusb lanyard 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:24.840
 This is so ordinary although it has such 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.000
 Checks logo, in principle, it is also 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.320
 used with the controller but for 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.439
 charging and for the controller further this 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:35.400
 documentation 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:39.090
 Here is such a documentation principle all 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:43.560
 it is clear and the adapter adapter is well with us 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.430
 It can be difficult to say that's all this 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.040
 we still have 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:51.270
 officially this device is not for sale 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:54.210
 so the adapter we have a plug other but 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.829
 this is not a problem i have adapters 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:59.430
 because I often test 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:01.680
 device with but american forks 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:06.899
 see everything is empty nothing else here 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:11.039
 no regret controller goes separately 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:12.840
 so you need to buy it and nvidia 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:16.200
 shield drenched me the store 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.450
 citrus and unfortunately but how would 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.610
 they too have no controller yet but 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.849
 Thank God for at least a tablet provided 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.680
 it already pleases and we look at 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:30.510
 the tablet itself 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:35.129
 it's very interesting so how is she 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:39.750
 here so it all opens very very 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:42.950
 even so plump and take out the shell 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:50.790
 tables hey 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:54.750
 get somewhere he poured yet 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:58.170
 now just got a look at the design and 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:00.959
 ergonomics on the front of us go 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:04.260
 front speakers on the right side 

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:05.180
 us stylus which we take out 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.390
 pocket 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:11.550
 shield we also have a stub for 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:14.700
 if that was the chat version here 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:15.390
 would put a sim card for miss micro sd 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.260
 cards 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:22.890
 volume control and power button 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:27.150
 we have a connector on the top 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:29.430
 mini-hdmi headphone jack microusb and 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:33.269
 also still in with in buffer but 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:35.099
 like a tiger in a new laptop that is something 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:37.260
 which is on tegra 4 

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:39.510
 by the way from this side the same thing 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.090
 there is for more bulk and massive 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:46.950
 sound on the back 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:50.190
 us the shield logo also has a camera without 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:54.060
 flashes and basically everything below us 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:55.080
 but some dimples are possible for some 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.090
 docking stations 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:00.349
 It is unlikely that it will charge as 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.980
 there are no connectors but nevertheless they are 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:05.819
 but also 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:08.700
 also very well so well i think that 

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:10.980
 it makes sense the first time to run this 

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:14.819
 shild doused and run 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:19.549
 we have it in a vertical version like this 

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:23.190
 looks pretty good in principle 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:26.630
 soft touch reminds me a lot of nexus 7 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:30.270
 Well, very straight straight all the same 

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:34.070
 glossy name shield now 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:38.940
 The first download is loaded with us and 

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:43.820
 in principle let us run now and 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:47.760
 so I already go to my account and not here 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:48.419
 offer some services to look for times 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.050
 references 

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:55.199
 from all this we give up almost 

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:58.020
 ready license agreement 

00:04:55.199 --> 00:05:00.539
 look there are a number of additional 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:02.460
 applications console mode wireless 

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:06.210
 controller and so on but about them we 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:09.419
 let's talk video review on the first 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:11.580
 impressions that tell you the tablet 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:14.669
 really looks good 

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:18.389
 well assembled i mean i didn't notice 

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:23.130
 no nuances on the build quality and 

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:26.130
 Of course, it is good that in the shell tables 

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:29.010
 full hd screen which 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:31.020
 Well, it will not be uncomfortable because everything 

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:32.310
 yet like a tiger geyser laptop which 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:34.020
 I did a review 

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:37.500
 that is, in general, this game is those of those 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:40.169
 who are still some father there 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:43.349
 the tiger of the laptop was hd screen and this 

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:46.470
 Well, to put it mildly saddened me but 

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:49.530
 Happily in the table went here full hd 

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:53.310
 but my friends will have a screen 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:56.160
 some days at least for his test 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:59.039
 that is, I will test it of course 

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:01.680
 I will definitely take off a lot of different 

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:04.470
 there video and so on i have to you 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:08.610
 a sentence that is you can for 

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:11.039
 that's who there 2 days even up to three days she 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:13.110
 writes some questions and if it be 

00:06:11.039 --> 00:06:15.389
 really but important questions that 

00:06:13.110 --> 00:06:18.900
 need to be considered in the review I definitely them 

00:06:15.389 --> 00:06:20.070
 I will consider and answer you these questions right in 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:22.260
 the review therefore 

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:26.460
 write in the comments what you would like 

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:28.440
 see but only of course it is clear that 

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:30.900
 doable ie controller to 

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:31.560
 Unfortunately, I will not show you how to play 

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:35.850
 the controller 

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:39.060
 but for example such nuances as stream 

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:41.790
 such nuances as a computer run 

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:42.630
 the game on the tablet is basically all that 

00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:44.940
 can do 

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:47.970
 shield tablet I think we are because 

00:06:44.940 --> 00:06:52.170
 testing and of course well I think it will 

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:53.520
 sense to make a comparison of this tablet 

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:57.330
 that is, shell tables and 

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:58.710
 xiaomi mi pad because here is the same 

00:06:57.330 --> 00:07:02.130
 most tegra k1 

00:06:58.710 --> 00:07:04.500
 but be a little with others there is an example 

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:08.220
 soft buns true features of the 

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:10.380
 there is it in another this tablet and about it we 

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:13.770
 also separately but we can do it 

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:15.510
 say comparison and do not know write to 

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:18.270
 Does it make sense to make a comparison? 

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:20.820
 for example with some ipad to 

00:07:18.270 --> 00:07:23.580
 samsung's example at ps maybe there 

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:26.610
 meaning, that is, please also write in 

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:30.270
 comments and I read everything but maybe 

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:32.490
 I will not answer everything for exactly what I read 

00:07:30.270 --> 00:07:35.670
 thank you for watching this 

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:38.340
 unpacking it was and nvidia shield 

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:42.240
 doused unpacking this wonderful 

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:45.480
 interesting gaming tablet even 

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:48.600
 You see, there is an inscription for Ultimate 

00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:51.960
 blackford gamer i.e. it is already possible 

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:54.630
 say the tablet era for gamers and about 

00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:57.660
