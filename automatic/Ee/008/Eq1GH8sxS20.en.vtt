okay<00:00:09.240> just<00:00:09.450> to<00:00:09.510> follow<00:00:09.750> up<00:00:09.900> on<00:00:10.019> the<00:00:10.559> last<00:00:10.769> video

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.040 
okay just to follow up on the last video

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.350 
okay just to follow up on the last video
with<00:00:11.400> the<00:00:11.580> axe<00:00:11.760> in<00:00:12.090> and<00:00:12.240> the<00:00:12.330> RL<00:00:13.110> miles<00:00:14.099> C<00:00:14.459> radio

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
with the axe in and the RL miles C radio

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.640 
with the axe in and the RL miles C radio
gear<00:00:15.510> some<00:00:15.690> people<00:00:15.900> suggested<00:00:16.350> to<00:00:16.500> me<00:00:16.619> that

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
gear some people suggested to me that

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.099 
gear some people suggested to me that
perhaps<00:00:16.920> the<00:00:17.160> camera<00:00:17.609> was<00:00:17.760> a<00:00:17.789> bit<00:00:18.029> noisy<00:00:18.240> the

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
perhaps the camera was a bit noisy the

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.380 
perhaps the camera was a bit noisy the
camera<00:00:19.380> on<00:00:19.439> my<00:00:19.529> TV<00:00:19.859> backpack<00:00:20.310> or<00:00:20.880> some<00:00:21.240> of<00:00:21.330> the

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
camera on my TV backpack or some of the

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:22.580 
camera on my TV backpack or some of the
other<00:00:21.510> gear<00:00:21.720> that's<00:00:21.930> hooked<00:00:22.109> up<00:00:22.199> on<00:00:22.320> here<00:00:22.439> so

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
other gear that's hooked up on here so

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.200 
other gear that's hooked up on here so
I've<00:00:22.800> got<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:23.070> spectrum<00:00:23.430> analyzer<00:00:23.579> set<00:00:24.089> up

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
I've got the spectrum analyzer set up

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.060 
I've got the spectrum analyzer set up
here<00:00:24.390> hopefully<00:00:25.230> you<00:00:25.259> can<00:00:25.439> see<00:00:25.710> that<00:00:25.890> now

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
here hopefully you can see that now

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.859 
here hopefully you can see that now
there<00:00:26.519> is<00:00:26.640> a<00:00:26.669> little<00:00:27.179> bit<00:00:27.329> of<00:00:27.449> noise<00:00:27.599> right

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
there is a little bit of noise right

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.109 
there is a little bit of noise right
here<00:00:28.079> on<00:00:28.169> 433<00:00:28.859> let's<00:00:29.039> just<00:00:29.220> see<00:00:29.339> what<00:00:29.490> that

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
here on 433 let's just see what that

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.150 
here on 433 let's just see what that
actually<00:00:30.480> what<00:00:31.140> frequency<00:00:31.499> that<00:00:31.619> that<00:00:31.890> little

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
actually what frequency that that little

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.700 
actually what frequency that that little
noise<00:00:32.369> peak<00:00:32.700> actually<00:00:33.060> is<00:00:33.290> there<00:00:34.290> are<00:00:34.440> we

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
noise peak actually is there are we

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.010 
noise peak actually is there are we
oops<00:00:34.920> no<00:00:35.130> I'm<00:00:35.190> going<00:00:35.370> the<00:00:35.460> wrong<00:00:35.579> way<00:00:36.020> I'm

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
oops no I'm going the wrong way I'm

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.010 
oops no I'm going the wrong way I'm
gonna<00:00:37.110> go<00:00:37.880> for<00:00:38.880> 30<00:00:39.239> there<00:00:39.390> we<00:00:39.480> go<00:00:39.600> need<00:00:39.780> to<00:00:39.870> go

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
gonna go for 30 there we go need to go

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.860 
gonna go for 30 there we go need to go
with<00:00:40.290> my<00:00:40.440> marker<00:00:40.920> which<00:00:41.910> is<00:00:42.180> because<00:00:42.720> I'm

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
with my marker which is because I'm

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.020 
with my marker which is because I'm
looking<00:00:43.050> for<00:00:43.350> my<00:00:43.530> funny<00:00:43.740> angle<00:00:44.160> here<00:00:44.760> we<00:00:44.850> go

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
looking for my funny angle here we go

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.500 
looking for my funny angle here we go
let's<00:00:45.300> move<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.600> marker<00:00:45.900> along<00:00:47.390> there<00:00:48.390> is<00:00:48.420> a

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
let's move the marker along there is a

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.650 
let's move the marker along there is a
spike<00:00:48.960> here<00:00:49.290> at<00:00:52.130> 429<00:00:53.130> so<00:00:53.970> yeah<00:00:54.360> and<00:00:54.540> there's

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
spike here at 429 so yeah and there's

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:03.320 
spike here at 429 so yeah and there's
another<00:00:54.810> one<00:00:54.960> at<00:00:59.450> 430<00:01:00.450> exactly<00:01:01.260> but<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.370> arm

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:03.330 
another one at 430 exactly but the arm

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:06.410 
another one at 430 exactly but the arm
I'll<00:01:03.510> see<00:01:03.720> gear<00:01:03.900> hops<00:01:04.110> around<00:01:04.409> past<00:01:05.339> that<00:01:05.549> 433

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
I'll see gear hops around past that 433

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.390 
I'll see gear hops around past that 433
I<00:01:06.479> think<00:01:06.659> we<00:01:06.720> regret<00:01:06.979> so<00:01:07.979> they<00:01:08.100> shouldn't<00:01:08.310> be

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
I think we regret so they shouldn't be

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.160 
I think we regret so they shouldn't be
too<00:01:08.549> much<00:01:08.640> of<00:01:08.700> an<00:01:08.880> issue<00:01:08.970> well<00:01:09.659> they<00:01:09.780> could<00:01:10.140> be

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
too much of an issue well they could be

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.040 
too much of an issue well they could be
but<00:01:10.829> let's<00:01:11.009> turn<00:01:11.280> on<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.790> fpv<00:01:12.510> backpack<00:01:12.930> the

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:13.050 
but let's turn on the fpv backpack the

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:14.750 
but let's turn on the fpv backpack the
video<00:01:13.290> system<00:01:13.440> and<00:01:13.740> see<00:01:14.040> whether<00:01:14.400> it<00:01:14.610> really

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
video system and see whether it really

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:15.950 
video system and see whether it really
screws<00:01:15.090> up<00:01:15.330> the<00:01:15.390> noise<00:01:15.480> now<00:01:15.690> I've<00:01:15.750> got<00:01:15.870> the

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
screws up the noise now I've got the

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.500 
screws up the noise now I've got the
sensitivity<00:01:16.470> wound<00:01:16.650> right<00:01:17.159> up<00:01:17.460> here<00:01:17.700> if<00:01:18.030> I

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:18.510 
sensitivity wound right up here if I

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.590 
sensitivity wound right up here if I
look<00:01:18.690> at<00:01:18.780> my<00:01:18.990> reference<00:01:19.860> level<00:01:20.300> where<00:01:21.300> are<00:01:21.450> we

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
look at my reference level where are we

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.510 
look at my reference level where are we
the<00:01:21.990> top<00:01:22.140> level<00:01:22.409> it's<00:01:22.500> minus<00:01:22.830> 60<00:01:23.159> dis<00:01:23.310> about

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
the top level it's minus 60 dis about

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.149 
the top level it's minus 60 dis about
the<00:01:23.640> top<00:01:23.820> e<00:01:23.850> asserts<00:01:24.180> 60<00:01:25.110> 70<00:01:25.590> 80<00:01:25.800> 90<00:01:26.060> 100<00:01:28.159> 110

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
the top e asserts 60 70 80 90 100 110

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.250 
the top e asserts 60 70 80 90 100 110
decibels<00:01:29.550> is<00:01:30.000> a<00:01:30.030> noise<00:01:30.270> for<00:01:30.479> at<00:01:30.600> 100<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.050> minus

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:31.260 
decibels is a noise for at 100 and minus

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.950 
decibels is a noise for at 100 and minus
110<00:01:31.740> decibels<00:01:31.890> for<00:01:32.280> this<00:01:32.400> unit<00:01:32.700> so<00:01:33.600> let's<00:01:33.750> plug

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
110 decibels for this unit so let's plug

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.039 
110 decibels for this unit so let's plug
in<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.520> fpv<00:01:35.520> backpack<00:01:36.030> and<00:01:36.330> see<00:01:36.630> what<00:01:36.780> it<00:01:36.870> does

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
in the fpv backpack and see what it does

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.640 
in the fpv backpack and see what it does
okay<00:01:37.790> well<00:01:38.790> you<00:01:38.880> notice<00:01:39.150> that<00:01:39.299> the<00:01:40.290> noise<00:01:40.620> was

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
okay well you notice that the noise was

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.010 
okay well you notice that the noise was
increased<00:01:41.190> slightly<00:01:41.580> but<00:01:41.940> only<00:01:42.390> ever<00:01:42.840> so

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
increased slightly but only ever so

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.620 
increased slightly but only ever so
slightly<00:01:43.350> and<00:01:43.500> my<00:01:44.330> spectrum<00:01:45.330> analyzer

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
slightly and my spectrum analyzer

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.050 
slightly and my spectrum analyzer
antenna<00:01:45.990> is<00:01:46.140> as<00:01:46.290> close<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.909> backpack<00:01:47.909> as

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
antenna is as close to the backpack as

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.450 
antenna is as close to the backpack as
the<00:01:48.390> antennas<00:01:48.930> for<00:01:49.080> the<00:01:49.290> receiver<00:01:50.010> are<00:01:50.159> here

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
the antennas for the receiver are here

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.450 
the antennas for the receiver are here
so<00:01:51.150> yeah<00:01:52.110> there's<00:01:52.619> nothing<00:01:52.740> really<00:01:53.010> going<00:01:53.250> on

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
so yeah there's nothing really going on

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.609 
so yeah there's nothing really going on
there<00:01:53.640> I<00:01:53.940> wouldn't<00:01:54.630> expect<00:01:54.930> that<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.380> cause<00:01:55.590> a

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
there I wouldn't expect that to cause a

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.340 
there I wouldn't expect that to cause a
major<00:01:56.010> issue<00:01:56.790> with<00:01:57.140> reception<00:01:58.140> I'll<00:01:58.229> just

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
major issue with reception I'll just

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:59.510 
major issue with reception I'll just
unplug<00:01:58.590> it<00:01:58.799> and<00:01:58.890> we'll<00:01:58.979> see<00:01:59.100> what<00:01:59.220> happens<00:01:59.430> to

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
unplug it and we'll see what happens to

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.420 
unplug it and we'll see what happens to
the<00:01:59.610> noise<00:01:59.760> floor<00:01:59.970> see<00:02:00.540> some<00:02:00.900> plugs<00:02:01.140> now

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
the noise floor see some plugs now

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:07.190 
the noise floor see some plugs now
unplug<00:02:02.430> not<00:02:02.820> much<00:02:02.970> plug<00:02:03.420> it<00:02:03.570> in<00:02:05.930> the<00:02:06.930> batteries

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
unplug not much plug it in the batteries

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.330 
unplug not much plug it in the batteries
go<00:02:07.320> flat<00:02:07.409> on<00:02:07.650> the<00:02:07.710> spectrum<00:02:07.950> analyzer<00:02:08.099> but

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
go flat on the spectrum analyzer but

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.130 
go flat on the spectrum analyzer but
there<00:02:08.519> you<00:02:08.580> go<00:02:08.700> so<00:02:09.509> there's<00:02:09.750> not<00:02:09.869> a<00:02:09.929> lot<00:02:10.110> of

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
there you go so there's not a lot of

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.289 
there you go so there's not a lot of
noise<00:02:10.319> produced<00:02:10.860> by<00:02:11.159> this<00:02:11.370> so<00:02:11.519> it's<00:02:11.700> not<00:02:11.760> the

00:02:12.289 --> 00:02:12.299 
noise produced by this so it's not the

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:14.000 
noise produced by this so it's not the
installation<00:02:13.019> just<00:02:13.260> tear<00:02:13.650> that<00:02:13.680> off<00:02:13.799> before

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
installation just tear that off before

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.490 
installation just tear that off before
it<00:02:14.280> makes<00:02:15.090> too<00:02:15.269> much<00:02:15.390> noise<00:02:15.450> so<00:02:15.750> really<00:02:15.990> it's

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
it makes too much noise so really it's

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.080 
it makes too much noise so really it's
not<00:02:16.709> the<00:02:16.860> installation<00:02:17.490> that's<00:02:17.700> causing<00:02:17.910> the

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
not the installation that's causing the

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.520 
not the installation that's causing the
problem<00:02:18.120> I'll<00:02:18.660> show<00:02:18.810> you<00:02:18.900> a<00:02:18.959> bit<00:02:19.080> more<00:02:19.110> inside

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
problem I'll show you a bit more inside

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:20.610 
problem I'll show you a bit more inside
what<00:02:19.740> we've<00:02:19.860> done<00:02:20.069> we

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
what we've done we

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.000 
what we've done we
the<00:02:20.739> install<00:02:21.750> take<00:02:22.750> the<00:02:22.930> little<00:02:23.680> thing<00:02:23.890> of

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
the install take the little thing of

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.199 
the install take the little thing of
lift<00:02:25.000> the<00:02:25.180> ax<00:02:25.510> in<00:02:25.920> catch<00:02:26.920> as<00:02:27.700> you<00:02:27.819> can<00:02:27.940> see<00:02:28.060> I've

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
lift the ax in catch as you can see I've

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:30.229 
lift the ax in catch as you can see I've
got<00:02:28.360> the<00:02:28.810> arm<00:02:28.989> I'll<00:02:29.200> see<00:02:29.409> receiver<00:02:29.860> here

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
got the arm I'll see receiver here

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:33.809 
got the arm I'll see receiver here
sitting<00:02:31.239> on<00:02:31.330> top<00:02:31.569> of<00:02:31.720> the<00:02:31.810> battery<00:02:32.200> and<00:02:32.819> the

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:33.819 
sitting on top of the battery and the

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:35.309 
sitting on top of the battery and the
only<00:02:33.940> other<00:02:34.060> thing<00:02:34.150> is<00:02:34.330> the<00:02:34.420> ESC<00:02:34.900> down<00:02:35.080> here

00:02:35.309 --> 00:02:35.319 
only other thing is the ESC down here

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:37.649 
only other thing is the ESC down here
but<00:02:35.440> that's<00:02:35.530> a<00:02:35.709> linear<00:02:36.400> yes<00:02:36.790> a<00:02:37.090> linear<00:02:37.450> Bick

00:02:37.649 --> 00:02:37.659 
but that's a linear yes a linear Bick

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:38.699 
but that's a linear yes a linear Bick
and<00:02:37.840> this<00:02:37.930> that's<00:02:38.170> not<00:02:38.290> gonna<00:02:38.409> cause<00:02:38.590> any

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
and this that's not gonna cause any

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:42.149 
and this that's not gonna cause any
noise<00:02:38.980> so<00:02:39.840> the<00:02:40.840> antennas<00:02:41.260> the<00:02:41.680> active<00:02:41.920> part

00:02:42.149 --> 00:02:42.159 
noise so the antennas the active part

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:43.800 
noise so the antennas the active part
starts<00:02:42.489> about<00:02:42.670> here<00:02:42.849> so<00:02:43.030> it's<00:02:43.180> well<00:02:43.329> away<00:02:43.569> from

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
starts about here so it's well away from

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.289 
starts about here so it's well away from
everything<00:02:44.049> it's<00:02:45.010> it's<00:02:45.400> not<00:02:45.610> a<00:02:45.670> bad<00:02:45.909> install

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:46.299 
everything it's it's not a bad install

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:47.809 
everything it's it's not a bad install
there's<00:02:46.750> no<00:02:46.870> reason<00:02:47.200> why<00:02:47.319> it<00:02:47.379> should<00:02:47.680> have

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:47.819 
there's no reason why it should have

it is here in the workshop mitts can

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.110 
it is here in the workshop mitts can
check<00:02:55.900> that<00:02:56.049> out<00:02:56.640> okay<00:02:57.640> here<00:02:57.790> we<00:02:57.879> are<00:02:57.910> we're

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
check that out okay here we are we're

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.910 
check that out okay here we are we're
outside<00:02:58.480> now<00:02:58.510> just<00:02:59.349> looking<00:02:59.500> at<00:02:59.650> the<00:02:59.739> noise

00:02:59.910 --> 00:02:59.920 
outside now just looking at the noise

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.640 
outside now just looking at the noise
profile<00:03:00.459> you<00:03:00.579> see<00:03:00.780> the<00:03:01.780> still<00:03:02.049> the<00:03:02.349> gain<00:03:02.530> is

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
profile you see the still the gain is

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:03.720 
profile you see the still the gain is
still<00:03:02.859> where<00:03:03.040> and<00:03:03.129> right<00:03:03.280> up<00:03:03.400> and<00:03:03.489> it's<00:03:03.579> really

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
still where and right up and it's really

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.849 
still where and right up and it's really
only<00:03:04.510> a<00:03:04.660> couple<00:03:04.840> little<00:03:05.019> peek<00:03:05.290> see<00:03:05.470> of<00:03:05.530> it<00:03:05.620> very

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:05.859 
only a couple little peek see of it very

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:10.050 
only a couple little peek see of it very
-<00:03:06.310> and<00:03:06.459> fry<00:03:07.079> and<00:03:08.079> any<00:03:08.739> decent<00:03:09.220> system<00:03:09.640> excuse

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
- and fry and any decent system excuse

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.869 
- and fry and any decent system excuse
the<00:03:10.090> strobing<00:03:10.569> because<00:03:10.750> the<00:03:11.730> backlight<00:03:12.730> on

00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:12.879 
the strobing because the backlight on

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:15.119 
the strobing because the backlight on
this<00:03:13.030> seems<00:03:13.720> to<00:03:13.840> be<00:03:13.870> fished<00:03:14.170> a<00:03:14.290> funny<00:03:14.500> its

00:03:15.119 --> 00:03:15.129 
this seems to be fished a funny its

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:15.899 
this seems to be fished a funny its
frequency

00:03:15.899 --> 00:03:15.909 
frequency

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:18.990 
frequency
yeah<00:03:16.390> any<00:03:16.629> kind<00:03:16.930> of<00:03:17.459> good<00:03:18.459> hopping<00:03:18.730> system

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
yeah any kind of good hopping system

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.119 
yeah any kind of good hopping system
should<00:03:19.150> be<00:03:19.180> able<00:03:19.299> to<00:03:19.390> dodge<00:03:19.569> those<00:03:19.950> Peaks<00:03:20.950> but

00:03:21.119 --> 00:03:21.129 
should be able to dodge those Peaks but

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:25.319 
should be able to dodge those Peaks but
I<00:03:21.159> guess<00:03:21.370> they<00:03:21.549> are<00:03:21.700> there<00:03:22.000> and<00:03:24.000> I'll<00:03:25.000> do<00:03:25.150> some

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:25.329 
I guess they are there and I'll do some

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:27.659 
I guess they are there and I'll do some
measurements<00:03:25.870> of<00:03:26.160> coldness<00:03:27.160> with<00:03:27.400> one<00:03:27.519> hand

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:27.669 
measurements of coldness with one hand

00:03:27.669 --> 00:03:28.650 
measurements of coldness with one hand
at<00:03:27.760> the<00:03:27.819> moment<00:03:27.880> holding<00:03:28.239> the<00:03:28.329> cam<00:03:28.480> with<00:03:28.599> the

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
at the moment holding the cam with the

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.539 
at the moment holding the cam with the
other<00:03:28.810> side<00:03:28.959> I'll<00:03:29.380> do<00:03:29.590> some<00:03:29.799> legal

00:03:30.539 --> 00:03:30.549 
other side I'll do some legal

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:33.599 
other side I'll do some legal
measurements<00:03:31.079> okay<00:03:32.079> that's<00:03:32.410> a<00:03:32.470> bit<00:03:32.590> -90<00:03:33.579> to

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:33.609 
measurements okay that's a bit -90 to

00:03:33.609 --> 00:03:35.640 
measurements okay that's a bit -90 to
-91<00:03:33.760> decibels<00:03:34.750> that<00:03:34.780> big<00:03:35.049> peak<00:03:35.290> we've<00:03:35.470> got

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
-91 decibels that big peak we've got

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.949 
-91 decibels that big peak we've got
there<00:03:35.889> which<00:03:36.669> is<00:03:36.879> you<00:03:37.090> know<00:03:37.419> it's<00:03:37.510> adequate<00:03:37.720> I

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
there which is you know it's adequate I

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:39.629 
there which is you know it's adequate I
mean<00:03:38.470> you<00:03:38.530> should<00:03:38.709> be<00:03:38.739> able<00:03:38.829> to<00:03:38.919> eat<00:03:39.370> through

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:39.639 
mean you should be able to eat through

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:41.069 
mean you should be able to eat through
that<00:03:39.760> one<00:03:39.910> kilometer<00:03:40.329> it<00:03:40.599> should<00:03:40.810> be<00:03:40.870> plenty

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:41.079 
that one kilometer it should be plenty

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:43.470 
that one kilometer it should be plenty
of<00:03:41.230> range<00:03:42.000> even<00:03:43.000> with<00:03:43.180> it

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
of range even with it

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.619 
of range even with it
peak<00:03:43.780> in<00:03:43.989> the<00:03:44.139> noise<00:03:44.370> sorry<00:03:45.370> yeah<00:03:46.150> don't<00:03:46.569> know

00:03:46.619 --> 00:03:46.629 
peak in the noise sorry yeah don't know

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:48.360 
peak in the noise sorry yeah don't know
what's<00:03:46.780> going<00:03:46.989> on<00:03:47.079> there<00:03:47.290> so<00:03:47.889> here<00:03:48.099> we<00:03:48.220> go

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
what's going on there so here we go

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.659 
what's going on there so here we go
that's<00:03:48.549> the<00:03:48.700> our<00:03:48.819> mousey<00:03:49.359> system<00:03:49.780> no<00:03:50.680> what<00:03:51.609> I

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:51.669 
that's the our mousey system no what I

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:54.180 
that's the our mousey system no what I
would<00:03:51.760> call<00:03:52.209> no<00:03:52.510> major<00:03:52.870> noise<00:03:53.349> issues<00:03:53.829> with

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
would call no major noise issues with

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:55.770 
would call no major noise issues with
the<00:03:54.280> installation<00:03:54.879> looks<00:03:55.299> good

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
the installation looks good

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.319 
the installation looks good
and<00:03:55.989> a<00:03:56.919> bit<00:03:57.280> of<00:03:57.310> noise<00:03:57.579> in<00:03:57.790> the<00:03:57.849> environment

00:03:58.319 --> 00:03:58.329 
and a bit of noise in the environment

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:00.539 
and a bit of noise in the environment
but<00:03:58.540> not<00:03:58.750> a<00:03:59.079> lot<00:03:59.319> exactly<00:03:59.739> here<00:03:59.919> where<00:04:00.129> I<00:04:00.160> bound

00:04:00.539 --> 00:04:00.549 
but not a lot exactly here where I bound

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:03.089 
but not a lot exactly here where I bound
the<00:04:00.699> system<00:04:01.030> up<00:04:01.239> so<00:04:01.510> why<00:04:02.379> isn't<00:04:02.739> it<00:04:02.769> not

00:04:03.089 --> 00:04:03.099 
the system up so why isn't it not

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:04.740 
the system up so why isn't it not
working<00:04:03.519> why<00:04:03.639> are<00:04:03.699> we<00:04:03.819> only<00:04:03.849> getting<00:04:04.180> one

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
working why are we only getting one

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:06.780 
working why are we only getting one
kilometer<00:04:05.349> of<00:04:05.500> range<00:04:05.769> out<00:04:06.040> of<00:04:06.129> watch<00:04:06.280> a<00:04:06.519> system

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
kilometer of range out of watch a system

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.939 
kilometer of range out of watch a system
that<00:04:06.879> should<00:04:07.060> give<00:04:07.299> you<00:04:08.049> know<00:04:08.169> tens<00:04:08.709> of

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:08.949 
that should give you know tens of

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:10.650 
that should give you know tens of
kilometers<00:04:09.370> of<00:04:09.400> range<00:04:09.669> and<00:04:09.849> some<00:04:10.060> people<00:04:10.299> do

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:10.660 
kilometers of range and some people do

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:12.659 
kilometers of range and some people do
get<00:04:10.870> quite<00:04:11.500> a<00:04:11.560> long<00:04:11.799> range<00:04:12.280> out<00:04:12.459> of<00:04:12.579> these

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:12.669 
get quite a long range out of these

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:14.819 
get quite a long range out of these
things<00:04:12.849> well<00:04:13.260> several<00:04:14.260> options<00:04:14.590> as<00:04:14.739> I

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:14.829 
things well several options as I

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:15.990 
things well several options as I
mentioned<00:04:15.250> at<00:04:15.340> the<00:04:15.370> start<00:04:15.430> of<00:04:15.669> this<00:04:15.760> video

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
mentioned at the start of this video

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.729 
mentioned at the start of this video
could<00:04:16.180> be<00:04:16.359> the<00:04:16.660> installation<00:04:17.139> but<00:04:17.349> it's<00:04:17.500> not

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
could be the installation but it's not

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:20.490 
could be the installation but it's not
the<00:04:18.220> installation<00:04:18.639> is<00:04:18.729> just<00:04:18.940> fine<00:04:19.470> the<00:04:20.470> other

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
the installation is just fine the other

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.409 
the installation is just fine the other
thing<00:04:20.799> it<00:04:20.919> could<00:04:21.039> be<00:04:21.099> that<00:04:21.340> wonky<00:04:21.970> transmitter

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:22.419 
thing it could be that wonky transmitter

00:04:22.419 --> 00:04:24.360 
thing it could be that wonky transmitter
aerial<00:04:22.780> that<00:04:22.930> horrible<00:04:23.229> telescopic<00:04:24.160> thing

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:24.370 
aerial that horrible telescopic thing

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:25.770 
aerial that horrible telescopic thing
because<00:04:24.639> the<00:04:24.760> module<00:04:25.030> does<00:04:25.150> get<00:04:25.360> hot<00:04:25.570> and<00:04:25.720> if

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
because the module does get hot and if

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:27.270 
because the module does get hot and if
the<00:04:25.870> modules<00:04:26.199> getting<00:04:26.440> hot<00:04:26.620> that<00:04:26.800> means<00:04:27.010> a

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
the modules getting hot that means a

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.950 
the modules getting hot that means a
fair<00:04:27.910> amount<00:04:28.120> of<00:04:28.150> the<00:04:28.240> energy<00:04:28.389> that<00:04:28.719> should<00:04:28.900> be

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
fair amount of the energy that should be

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.110 
fair amount of the energy that should be
going<00:04:29.169> out<00:04:29.680> the<00:04:29.860> transmitter<00:04:30.340> antenna<00:04:30.849> is

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
going out the transmitter antenna is

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.909 
going out the transmitter antenna is
coming<00:04:31.419> back<00:04:31.539> into<00:04:31.690> the<00:04:31.810> module<00:04:32.140> and<00:04:32.289> causing

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:32.919 
coming back into the module and causing

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:33.750 
coming back into the module and causing
things<00:04:33.039> to<00:04:33.159> heat<00:04:33.370> up<00:04:33.400> so

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:33.760 
things to heat up so

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.840 
things to heat up so
I<00:04:33.820> have<00:04:34.330> a<00:04:34.480> nagoya<00:04:34.900> antenna<00:04:35.860> coming<00:04:36.250> should<00:04:36.760> be

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:36.850 
I have a nagoya antenna coming should be

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:37.830 
I have a nagoya antenna coming should be
here<00:04:37.030> in<00:04:37.090> the<00:04:37.120> next<00:04:37.180> couple<00:04:37.450> of<00:04:37.600> days<00:04:37.780> just

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
here in the next couple of days just

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.110 
here in the next couple of days just
like<00:04:38.200> the<00:04:38.290> one<00:04:38.380> on<00:04:38.410> my<00:04:38.590> spectrum<00:04:38.860> analyzer<00:04:39.220> and

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
like the one on my spectrum analyzer and

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.250 
like the one on my spectrum analyzer and
I'll<00:04:40.210> fit<00:04:40.390> that<00:04:40.540> and<00:04:40.840> we'll<00:04:40.960> do<00:04:41.080> some<00:04:41.230> more

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:41.260 
I'll fit that and we'll do some more

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.470 
I'll fit that and we'll do some more
trying<00:04:41.590> but<00:04:41.680> of<00:04:41.800> course<00:04:41.950> when<00:04:42.520> you<00:04:42.670> know<00:04:42.910> that

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:43.480 
trying but of course when you know that

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:44.610 
trying but of course when you know that
it's<00:04:43.600> very<00:04:43.780> likely<00:04:44.020> the<00:04:44.230> model<00:04:44.410> is<00:04:44.470> going<00:04:44.560> to

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:44.620 
it's very likely the model is going to

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:46.380 
it's very likely the model is going to
fly<00:04:44.800> out<00:04:44.920> of<00:04:45.010> range<00:04:45.190> it's<00:04:45.340> a<00:04:45.370> bit<00:04:45.490> dodgy<00:04:45.640> you

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:46.390 
fly out of range it's a bit dodgy you

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:48.990 
fly out of range it's a bit dodgy you
know<00:04:46.600> so<00:04:47.110> what<00:04:47.230> I've<00:04:47.350> done<00:04:47.470> is<00:04:47.620> I'll<00:04:47.710> put<00:04:48.000> the

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
know so what I've done is I'll put the

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.960 
know so what I've done is I'll put the
system<00:04:49.630> in<00:04:49.750> my<00:04:49.990> hobbyking<00:04:50.650> EPP<00:04:51.190> fpv<00:04:51.640> with<00:04:51.850> the

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:51.970 
system in my hobbyking EPP fpv with the

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:55.080 
system in my hobbyking EPP fpv with the
FY<00:04:52.420> 21<00:04:53.050> and<00:04:53.290> return<00:04:53.620> to<00:04:53.830> launch<00:04:54.070> so<00:04:54.670> if<00:04:54.760> it<00:04:54.850> does

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 
FY 21 and return to launch so if it does

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:56.580 
FY 21 and return to launch so if it does
fly<00:04:55.390> out<00:04:55.510> of<00:04:55.600> range<00:04:55.780> hopefully<00:04:56.260> it'll<00:04:56.410> just

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
fly out of range hopefully it'll just

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:57.900 
fly out of range hopefully it'll just
turn<00:04:56.770> around<00:04:56.980> and<00:04:57.070> come<00:04:57.190> back<00:04:57.220> that's<00:04:57.640> what<00:04:57.820> it

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:57.910 
turn around and come back that's what it

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:00.300 
turn around and come back that's what it
usually<00:04:58.000> does<00:04:58.360> so<00:04:58.830> that's<00:04:59.830> something<00:05:00.160> that

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.310 
usually does so that's something that

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.760 
usually does so that's something that
I'll<00:05:00.550> do<00:05:00.960> when<00:05:01.960> the<00:05:02.050> weather<00:05:02.230> allows<00:05:02.290> probably

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:02.770 
I'll do when the weather allows probably

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:04.110 
I'll do when the weather allows probably
early<00:05:02.980> next<00:05:03.130> week<00:05:03.220> we'll<00:05:03.460> do<00:05:03.550> a<00:05:03.580> test<00:05:03.760> with<00:05:04.000> the

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
early next week we'll do a test with the

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.870 
early next week we'll do a test with the
new<00:05:04.150> transmitter<00:05:04.720> antenna<00:05:05.020> and<00:05:05.880> installation

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:06.880 
new transmitter antenna and installation

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.660 
new transmitter antenna and installation
in<00:05:07.030> the<00:05:07.180> hobbyking<00:05:07.690> EPP<00:05:08.320> model<00:05:08.680> where<00:05:09.430> again

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:09.670 
in the hobbyking EPP model where again

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:11.550 
in the hobbyking EPP model where again
the<00:05:09.880> installation<00:05:10.750> is<00:05:10.840> very<00:05:10.900> good<00:05:11.260> everything

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:11.560 
the installation is very good everything

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.170 
the installation is very good everything
is<00:05:11.620> well<00:05:11.800> away<00:05:11.980> from<00:05:12.190> everything<00:05:12.340> else<00:05:12.490> even

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:13.180 
is well away from everything else even

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:14.610 
is well away from everything else even
more<00:05:13.330> so<00:05:13.510> than<00:05:13.660> on<00:05:13.750> the<00:05:13.840> X<00:05:14.110> in<00:05:14.260> but<00:05:14.440> we'll<00:05:14.530> try

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:14.620 
more so than on the X in but we'll try

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:15.900 
more so than on the X in but we'll try
it<00:05:14.710> out<00:05:14.830> with<00:05:15.070> that<00:05:15.280> so<00:05:15.430> here<00:05:15.550> we<00:05:15.610> go

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:15.910 
it out with that so here we go

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:19.140 
it out with that so here we go
and<00:05:16.080> that<00:05:17.080> does<00:05:17.710> it<00:05:17.800> dragon<00:05:18.040> link<00:05:18.340> have<00:05:18.970> said

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:19.150 
and that does it dragon link have said

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:20.400 
and that does it dragon link have said
they're<00:05:19.300> sending<00:05:19.510> me<00:05:19.750> a<00:05:19.780> dragon<00:05:20.050> link<00:05:20.290> to

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:20.410 
they're sending me a dragon link to

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:22.470 
they're sending me a dragon link to
review<00:05:20.530> so<00:05:21.130> it'll<00:05:21.250> be<00:05:21.310> interesting<00:05:21.760> to<00:05:22.090> see

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:22.480 
review so it'll be interesting to see

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:24.120 
review so it'll be interesting to see
the<00:05:22.630> comparison<00:05:22.930> because<00:05:23.590> the<00:05:23.680> other<00:05:23.830> thing

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:24.130 
the comparison because the other thing

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:26.730 
the comparison because the other thing
you<00:05:24.220> got<00:05:24.310> to<00:05:24.370> remember<00:05:24.460> with<00:05:24.790> that<00:05:25.590> the<00:05:26.590> are

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:26.740 
you got to remember with that the are

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:28.860 
you got to remember with that the are
miles<00:05:27.010> C<00:05:27.280> system<00:05:27.970> is<00:05:28.060> that<00:05:28.150> it<00:05:28.300> is<00:05:28.330> spitting

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:28.870 
miles C system is that it is spitting

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:31.860 
miles C system is that it is spitting
out<00:05:28.960> a<00:05:28.990> lot<00:05:29.440> of<00:05:29.470> energy<00:05:30.100> in<00:05:30.250> harmonics<00:05:31.000> so<00:05:31.240> even

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:31.870 
out a lot of energy in harmonics so even

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:34.200 
out a lot of energy in harmonics so even
though<00:05:31.960> it's<00:05:32.110> supposedly<00:05:33.010> 1.2<00:05:33.760> watts<00:05:33.970> in<00:05:34.120> the

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.210 
though it's supposedly 1.2 watts in the

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:35.880 
though it's supposedly 1.2 watts in the
low<00:05:34.300> power<00:05:34.510> configuration<00:05:35.140> how<00:05:35.590> much<00:05:35.740> of

low power configuration how much of
that's<00:05:36.010> actually<00:05:36.220> on<00:05:36.460> the<00:05:36.490> frequencies<00:05:36.940> you

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:37.090 
that's actually on the frequencies you

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:38.550 
that's actually on the frequencies you
want<00:05:37.240> and<00:05:37.390> how<00:05:37.450> much<00:05:37.600> of<00:05:37.630> it<00:05:37.840> is<00:05:38.080> harmonic

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:38.560 
want and how much of it is harmonic

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.380 
want and how much of it is harmonic
energy<00:05:39.070> if<00:05:39.610> you<00:05:39.670> put<00:05:39.820> it<00:05:39.910> on<00:05:39.970> a<00:05:40.030> power<00:05:40.240> meter

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:40.390 
energy if you put it on a power meter

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:41.760 
energy if you put it on a power meter
it's<00:05:40.540> going<00:05:40.660> to<00:05:40.720> measure<00:05:40.810> the<00:05:40.990> whole<00:05:41.110> lot<00:05:41.380> it

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:41.770 
it's going to measure the whole lot it

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:43.230 
it's going to measure the whole lot it
may<00:05:41.980> be<00:05:42.040> that<00:05:42.340> the<00:05:42.460> actual<00:05:42.580> amount<00:05:42.970> of<00:05:43.030> power

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:43.240 
may be that the actual amount of power

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.550 
may be that the actual amount of power
going<00:05:43.450> to<00:05:43.540> the<00:05:43.630> antenna<00:05:43.900> is<00:05:44.020> a<00:05:44.050> lot<00:05:44.200> less<00:05:44.380> than

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:44.560 
going to the antenna is a lot less than

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:48.180 
going to the antenna is a lot less than
the<00:05:44.650> 1.2<00:05:45.130> Watts<00:05:45.690> that<00:05:46.690> it<00:05:47.260> claims<00:05:47.620> at<00:05:48.040> least

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:48.190 
the 1.2 Watts that it claims at least

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:49.530 
the 1.2 Watts that it claims at least
the<00:05:48.280> amount<00:05:48.460> of<00:05:48.490> power<00:05:48.790> going<00:05:48.970> to<00:05:49.090> the<00:05:49.180> antenna

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:49.540 
the amount of power going to the antenna

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:51.690 
the amount of power going to the antenna
on<00:05:49.660> the<00:05:49.750> required<00:05:50.080> frequency<00:05:50.590> so<00:05:51.460> there<00:05:51.580> we<00:05:51.670> go

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:51.700 
on the required frequency so there we go

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:53.430 
on the required frequency so there we go
and<00:05:51.970> of<00:05:52.240> course<00:05:52.390> the<00:05:52.480> last<00:05:52.630> thing<00:05:52.870> I<00:05:53.140> could<00:05:53.320> do

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:53.440 
and of course the last thing I could do

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:55.560 
and of course the last thing I could do
is<00:05:53.650> take<00:05:53.980> a<00:05:54.010> hike<00:05:54.250> a<00:05:54.460> kilometer<00:05:55.030> over<00:05:55.150> to<00:05:55.420> where

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:55.570 
is take a hike a kilometer over to where

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:56.910 
is take a hike a kilometer over to where
that<00:05:55.720> half<00:05:55.870> round<00:05:56.110> burners<00:05:56.440> and<00:05:56.500> just<00:05:56.650> measure

00:05:56.910 --> 00:05:56.920 
that half round burners and just measure

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:59.430 
that half round burners and just measure
the<00:05:57.430> noise<00:05:57.610> profile<00:05:58.150> over<00:05:58.360> there<00:05:58.510> then<00:05:59.350> I'd

00:05:59.430 --> 00:05:59.440 
the noise profile over there then I'd

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:01.020 
the noise profile over there then I'd
pay<00:05:59.590> me<00:05:59.680> enough<00:05:59.830> to<00:05:59.890> do<00:06:00.070> that<00:06:00.220> but<00:06:00.400> hey<00:06:00.550> I<00:06:00.760> may

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:01.030 
pay me enough to do that but hey I may

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:02.760 
pay me enough to do that but hey I may
do<00:06:01.090> it<00:06:01.330> I<00:06:01.390> may<00:06:01.540> just<00:06:01.750> jump<00:06:01.960> the<00:06:02.050> fence<00:06:02.170> take<00:06:02.680> the

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:02.770 
do it I may just jump the fence take the

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:04.290 
do it I may just jump the fence take the
spectrum<00:06:03.100> analyzer<00:06:03.190> and<00:06:03.610> just<00:06:03.850> see<00:06:04.060> how<00:06:04.180> much

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:04.300 
spectrum analyzer and just see how much

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:05.310 
spectrum analyzer and just see how much
noise<00:06:04.540> maybe<00:06:04.720> there's<00:06:04.930> something<00:06:05.170> in<00:06:05.290> that

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:05.320 
noise maybe there's something in that

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.260 
noise maybe there's something in that
barn<00:06:05.770> over<00:06:05.950> there<00:06:06.160> on<00:06:06.280> their<00:06:06.430> sheds<00:06:06.910> nearby

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:07.270 
barn over there on their sheds nearby

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:09.420 
barn over there on their sheds nearby
that's<00:06:07.480> creating<00:06:07.930> a<00:06:07.990> lot<00:06:08.230> of<00:06:08.260> noise<00:06:08.530> which<00:06:09.280> is

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:09.430 
that's creating a lot of noise which is

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:11.250 
that's creating a lot of noise which is
causing<00:06:09.700> the<00:06:09.880> armed<00:06:10.330> RC<00:06:10.750> receiver<00:06:10.930> to<00:06:11.230> be

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:11.260 
causing the armed RC receiver to be

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:13.350 
causing the armed RC receiver to be
swamped<00:06:11.680> and<00:06:11.800> lose<00:06:12.190> the<00:06:12.520> transmitter<00:06:13.000> signal

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:13.360 
swamped and lose the transmitter signal

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.960 
swamped and lose the transmitter signal
who<00:06:13.930> knows<00:06:14.160> but<00:06:15.160> I'll<00:06:15.280> do<00:06:15.400> my<00:06:15.430> best<00:06:15.700> to<00:06:15.820> find

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:15.970 
who knows but I'll do my best to find

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:17.670 
who knows but I'll do my best to find
out<00:06:16.150> for<00:06:16.330> you<00:06:16.450> and<00:06:16.960> if<00:06:17.110> the<00:06:17.200> people<00:06:17.320> from<00:06:17.530> our

mile C are watching maybe they could

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:20.100 
mile C are watching maybe they could
chime<00:06:19.120> in<00:06:19.300> and<00:06:19.420> tell<00:06:19.540> us<00:06:19.630> what<00:06:19.750> they<00:06:19.840> think<00:06:20.050> the
