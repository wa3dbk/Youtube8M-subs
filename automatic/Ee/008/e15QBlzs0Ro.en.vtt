 SELECTED IN THE SUNDANCE FILM FESTIVAL AND THE TORONTO FILM FESTIVAL 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
 Do I need to introduce myself? 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
 "WESTERN THAT DOES NOT CONSIDER THAT SERGIO LEONE SITTED." 

00:00:14.001 --> 00:00:17.000
 I've been surrounded by bad people all my life. 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
 I'll make you a suggestion. 

00:00:23.001 --> 00:00:27.000
 Have I told you there is a way to save your little brother Mikey from the noose? 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
 Let's just give you a horse and a gun. 

00:00:31.001 --> 00:00:33.000
 So what do you want? 

00:00:33.001 --> 00:00:35.500
 I know where your brother Arthur Burns is. 

00:00:35.501 --> 00:00:38.000
 It's a forgotten place. 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
 - You want me to kill my brother? - I want you to kill your brother. 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
 The fact is, you promised those animals that raped Eliza Hopkins a pardon 

00:00:50.001 --> 00:00:53.000
 if Charlie Burns brings his brother back. 

00:00:53.001 --> 00:00:56.000
 Arthur Burns is a beast. He's disgusting. 

00:00:56.001 --> 00:01:00.000
 He caused all the violence. 

00:01:00.001 --> 00:01:03.000
 Your brother came to kill you. 

00:01:03.001 --> 00:01:06.000
 - Can I help you. - You me? 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
 - Is everything okay? - Just ask your man. 

00:01:12.001 --> 00:01:14.000
 I'm civilizing this country. 

00:01:14.001 --> 00:01:16.000
 Who do you think you are? Judge? 

00:01:16.001 --> 00:01:18.000
 Someone must stop Arthur Burns. 

00:01:18.001 --> 00:01:20.500
 - Well, they raped a woman. - She was my friend! 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
 You shouldn't have left us here. 

00:01:23.001 --> 00:01:25.500
 - Brother! - He's hanging on Mikey's throw. 

00:01:27.001 --> 00:01:30.000
 I know why you came, Charlie. 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
 God, thank you for your gifts we are going to accept. 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 When you have to kill one, take care to kill them all. 

00:01:43.001 --> 00:01:50.000
 "When?" asked the moon moon in the sky. "Soon," the wind answered, following him home. 

00:01:50.001 --> 00:01:54.000
