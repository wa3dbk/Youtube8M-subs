00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
important we tried to check that each

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.590 
important we tried to check that each
other<00:02:52.520> is<00:02:52.790> in<00:02:52.970> proper<00:02:53.209> form<00:02:53.570> and<00:02:54.200> that

other is in proper form and that

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:57.580 
other is in proper form and that
maximizes<00:02:56.600> the<00:02:56.630> effectiveness<00:02:57.230> of<00:02:57.470> the

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:57.590 
maximizes the effectiveness of the

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.040 
maximizes the effectiveness of the
exercise<00:02:58.190> and<00:02:58.610> at<00:02:58.670> the<00:02:58.790> same<00:02:59.060> time<00:02:59.450> hopefully

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
exercise and at the same time hopefully

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:01.510 
exercise and at the same time hopefully
consistent<00:03:00.560> getting<00:03:00.800> hurt

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:01.520 
consistent getting hurt

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.229 
consistent getting hurt
we're<00:03:01.820> told<00:03:03.459> she's<00:03:04.459> really<00:03:04.760> subtle<00:03:05.120> about

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
we're told she's really subtle about

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:07.300 
we're told she's really subtle about
Corrections<00:03:06.200> and<00:03:06.530> I<00:03:06.709> think<00:03:06.920> that<00:03:07.010> makes<00:03:07.190> it

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
Corrections and I think that makes it

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:08.620 
Corrections and I think that makes it
easier<00:03:07.580> to<00:03:07.610> take<00:03:07.730> the<00:03:07.970> class<00:03:08.180> because<00:03:08.540> you're

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
easier to take the class because you're

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.120 
easier to take the class because you're
not<00:03:08.750> worried<00:03:09.020> about<00:03:09.110> somebody<00:03:09.470> standing<00:03:09.830> over

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
not worried about somebody standing over

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.780 
not worried about somebody standing over
you<00:03:10.310> going<00:03:11.060> you're<00:03:11.989> doing<00:03:12.230> it<00:03:12.350> wrong<00:03:12.560> I<00:03:12.920> think

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
you going you're doing it wrong I think

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.610 
you going you're doing it wrong I think
