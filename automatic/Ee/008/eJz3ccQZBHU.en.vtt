cutting them the meat is falling off the
bone<00:03:59.169> wood<00:03:59.500> is<00:03:59.859> actually<00:04:00.700> not<00:04:00.849> what<00:04:01.060> you<00:04:01.209> want

00:04:04.649 --> 00:04:04.659 
that means that they're overdone so I'm

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:06.390 
that means that they're overdone so I'm
gonna<00:04:04.780> have<00:04:04.959> to<00:04:05.109> rethink<00:04:05.319> this<00:04:05.739> next<00:04:06.219> time

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
gonna have to rethink this next time

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.909 
gonna have to rethink this next time
maybe<00:04:07.180> try<00:04:07.540> it<00:04:07.599> without<00:04:07.780> the<00:04:07.989> rap<00:04:08.349> or<00:04:08.709> maybe

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:08.919 
maybe try it without the rap or maybe

00:04:08.919 --> 00:04:10.949 
maybe try it without the rap or maybe
reduce<00:04:09.129> to<00:04:09.459> cook<00:04:09.669> time<00:04:09.879> by<00:04:10.090> an<00:04:10.209> hour<00:04:10.389> but

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:10.959 
reduce to cook time by an hour but

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:12.479 
reduce to cook time by an hour but
that's<00:04:11.079> a<00:04:11.260> good<00:04:11.469> time<00:04:11.709> because<00:04:11.950> it<00:04:12.189> means<00:04:12.310> my

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 
that's a good time because it means my

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:16.849 
that's a good time because it means my
pellet<00:04:12.909> smoker<00:04:13.060> is<00:04:13.450> getting<00:04:13.780> it<00:04:13.870> done<00:04:14.049> quick
