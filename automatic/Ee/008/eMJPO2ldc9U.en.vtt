Fusion<00:00:06.230> and<00:00:07.230> in<00:00:07.350> my<00:00:07.470> mind<00:00:07.710> it's<00:00:07.859> one<00:00:07.950> of<00:00:08.040> the

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
Fusion and in my mind it's one of the

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:09.470 
Fusion and in my mind it's one of the
best<00:00:08.370> looking<00:00:08.610> cars<00:00:08.730> in<00:00:09.210> the<00:00:09.300> segment

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
best looking cars in the segment

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.629 
best looking cars in the segment
basically<00:00:10.469> what<00:00:10.620> Ford<00:00:10.950> did<00:00:11.040> was<00:00:11.429> they<00:00:11.610> took

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
basically what Ford did was they took

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.509 
basically what Ford did was they took
the<00:00:11.820> front<00:00:12.150> end<00:00:12.360> of<00:00:12.509> an<00:00:12.599> Aston<00:00:13.049> Martin<00:00:13.519> it's

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
the front end of an Aston Martin it's

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.790 
the front end of an Aston Martin it's
like<00:00:14.700> a<00:00:14.820> Jaguar<00:00:15.089> on<00:00:15.360> the<00:00:15.509> back<00:00:15.660> of<00:00:15.839> it<00:00:15.960> of

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
like a Jaguar on the back of it of

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.250 
like a Jaguar on the back of it of
course<00:00:17.039> the<00:00:17.190> question<00:00:17.520> is<00:00:17.640> does<00:00:18.300> it<00:00:18.510> drive<00:00:18.869> as

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
course the question is does it drive as
