we<00:00:00.299> are<00:00:00.539> beginning<00:00:00.690> to<00:00:00.960> get<00:00:01.050> a<00:00:01.110> handle<00:00:01.469> on<00:00:01.530> why

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.070 
we are beginning to get a handle on why

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.730 
we are beginning to get a handle on why
it<00:00:02.129> is<00:00:02.340> that<00:00:02.520> we<00:00:02.639> sleep<00:00:02.909> and<00:00:03.149> it's<00:00:03.449> weird<00:00:04.049> it's

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
it is that we sleep and it's weird it's

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.829 
it is that we sleep and it's weird it's
another<00:00:05.009> one<00:00:05.250> of<00:00:05.279> those<00:00:05.370> unexpected<00:00:05.839> really

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
another one of those unexpected really

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:08.450 
another one of those unexpected really
weirdly<00:00:07.319> unexpected<00:00:07.950> things<00:00:08.099> and<00:00:08.189> here's<00:00:08.370> the

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
weirdly unexpected things and here's the

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.160 
weirdly unexpected things and here's the
way<00:00:08.519> you<00:00:08.550> can<00:00:08.760> show<00:00:08.910> it<00:00:09.030> you<00:00:09.719> put<00:00:09.929> a<00:00:09.960> wrap

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
way you can show it you put a wrap

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.509 
way you can show it you put a wrap
through<00:00:10.380> a<00:00:10.440> maze<00:00:10.650> and<00:00:10.980> you've<00:00:11.099> got<00:00:11.219> a<00:00:11.250> bunch<00:00:11.490> of

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
through a maze and you've got a bunch of

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.240 
through a maze and you've got a bunch of
electrodes<00:00:11.940> stuck<00:00:12.269> in<00:00:12.389> its<00:00:12.509> head<00:00:12.719> okay<00:00:13.250> you

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:14.250 
electrodes stuck in its head okay you

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.750 
electrodes stuck in its head okay you
record<00:00:14.880> the<00:00:15.690> pattern<00:00:16.289> of<00:00:16.440> electrical<00:00:16.949> firing

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
record the pattern of electrical firing

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.540 
record the pattern of electrical firing
as<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:18.779> rat<00:00:19.350> learns<00:00:19.710> to<00:00:20.010> negotiate<00:00:20.430> through

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
as the rat learns to negotiate through

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:21.830 
as the rat learns to negotiate through
the<00:00:20.640> maze<00:00:20.789> that<00:00:21.300> make<00:00:21.420> sense

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
the maze that make sense

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.310 
the maze that make sense
pretty<00:00:22.560> soon<00:00:22.800> you<00:00:22.980> see<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.369> rat<00:00:23.580> has<00:00:23.970> a<00:00:24.359> maze

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
pretty soon you see the rat has a maze

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.220 
pretty soon you see the rat has a maze
learn<00:00:25.980> pattern<00:00:26.789> and<00:00:27.029> you<00:00:27.599> can<00:00:27.750> actually<00:00:27.900> watch

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
learn pattern and you can actually watch

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.259 
learn pattern and you can actually watch
the<00:00:28.500> rat<00:00:28.710> as<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.189> rat<00:00:29.340> is<00:00:29.490> going<00:00:29.849> through<00:00:30.119> the

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
the rat as the rat is going through the

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.510 
the rat as the rat is going through the
maze<00:00:30.449> deploying<00:00:31.439> that<00:00:31.830> pattern<00:00:32.250> over<00:00:32.489> and

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
maze deploying that pattern over and

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.910 
maze deploying that pattern over and
over<00:00:32.669> again<00:00:32.759> that<00:00:33.000> make<00:00:33.120> sense<00:00:33.329> if<00:00:33.960> you<00:00:34.590> leave

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
over again that make sense if you leave

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.900 
over again that make sense if you leave
the<00:00:35.460> electrode<00:00:36.329> on<00:00:36.630> at<00:00:36.989> night<00:00:37.550> while<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.730> rat

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
the electrode on at night while the rat

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.990 
the electrode on at night while the rat
is<00:00:39.149> asleep<00:00:39.540> at<00:00:39.809> a<00:00:40.440> very<00:00:40.920> particular<00:00:41.280> stage<00:00:41.790> in

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
is asleep at a very particular stage in

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.209 
is asleep at a very particular stage in
the<00:00:42.180> rat<00:00:42.329> sleep<00:00:42.660> you<00:00:42.899> see<00:00:43.110> something<00:00:43.559> so<00:00:43.860> weird

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
the rat sleep you see something so weird

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.920 
the rat sleep you see something so weird
that<00:00:44.309> I<00:00:44.579> think<00:00:45.090> when<00:00:45.600> it<00:00:45.660> was<00:00:45.780> first

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
that I think when it was first

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.299 
that I think when it was first
encountered<00:00:46.440> some<00:00:46.710> people<00:00:46.920> didn't<00:00:47.100> believe

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
encountered some people didn't believe

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:52.760 
encountered some people didn't believe
it<00:00:48.020> the<00:00:49.020> rat<00:00:49.850> replays<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:51.780> entire<00:00:52.199> learned

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
it the rat replays the entire learned

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:58.549 
it the rat replays the entire learned
sequence<00:00:55.430> thousands<00:00:56.430> of<00:00:56.550> times<00:00:57.350> over<00:00:58.350> and

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
sequence thousands of times over and

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:04.280 
sequence thousands of times over and
over<00:00:58.920> again<00:00:59.039> at<00:00:59.940> night<00:01:00.890> at<00:01:01.890> night<00:01:03.019> it's<00:01:04.019> called

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
over again at night at night it's called

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.640 
over again at night at night it's called

actually<00:01:17.610> is<00:01:18.030> begins<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:19.110> night<00:01:19.490> after

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
actually is begins the night after

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.240 
actually is begins the night after
you've<00:01:20.610> learned<00:01:20.790> it<00:01:20.939> in<00:01:21.650> which<00:01:22.650> case<00:01:22.920> the

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
you've learned it in which case the

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.399 
you've learned it in which case the
brain<00:01:23.460> rule<00:01:23.759> says<00:01:24.060> sleep<00:01:24.450> well<00:01:24.720> think<00:01:25.200> well

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
brain rule says sleep well think well

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.080 
brain rule says sleep well think well
what<00:01:25.740> it<00:01:25.860> really<00:01:25.979> means<00:01:26.250> is<00:01:26.490> that<00:01:26.520> sleep<00:01:26.880> is

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
what it really means is that sleep is

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.969 
what it really means is that sleep is
unbelievably<00:01:27.720> important<00:01:28.259> to<00:01:28.350> learning<00:01:28.619> and

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
unbelievably important to learning and

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.640 
unbelievably important to learning and
it<00:01:29.610> may<00:01:29.820> be<00:01:29.880> you<00:01:30.509> can<00:01:30.659> now<00:01:30.750> show<00:01:31.020> this<00:01:31.259> to<00:01:31.560> be

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
it may be you can now show this to be

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.399 
it may be you can now show this to be
true<00:01:31.799> in<00:01:32.100> humans<00:01:32.960> when<00:01:33.960> you<00:01:34.110> learn<00:01:34.380> something

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
true in humans when you learn something

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.149 
true in humans when you learn something
you<00:01:35.100> will<00:01:35.880> replay<00:01:36.390> it<00:01:36.570> over<00:01:37.350> and<00:01:37.590> over<00:01:38.040> again

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
you will replay it over and over again

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.910 
you will replay it over and over again
in<00:01:38.549> your<00:01:38.579> head<00:01:38.759> at<00:01:39.030> night<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:39.509> if<00:01:39.960> we<00:01:40.290> disrupt

your sleep and a very particular stage

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.710 
your sleep and a very particular stage
you<00:01:44.250> will<00:01:44.399> quit<00:01:44.700> learning<00:01:45.090> and<00:01:45.240> you<00:01:45.450> have<00:01:45.600> to

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
you will quit learning and you have to

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.210 
you will quit learning and you have to
relearn<00:01:46.049> it<00:01:46.259> in<00:01:46.380> fact<00:01:46.799> you<00:01:46.890> can<00:01:47.009> you<00:01:47.070> show<00:01:47.189> that

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
relearn it in fact you can you show that

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.620 
relearn it in fact you can you show that
with<00:01:47.460> the<00:01:47.549> maze<00:01:47.700> with<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.000> rats<00:01:48.180> with<00:01:48.509> the

with the maze with the rats with the
maze<00:01:48.780> when<00:01:49.350> you<00:01:49.439> disrupt<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:50.009> sleep<00:01:50.280> right<00:01:50.549> to

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670

maze when you disrupt the sleep right to
the<00:01:50.759> time<00:01:50.909> when<00:01:51.030> they're<00:01:51.119> doing<00:01:51.270> repeating

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
the time when they're doing repeating

that thousands of times they have to go

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.560 
that thousands of times they have to go
back<00:01:53.490> and<00:01:53.670> relearn<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:54.030> maze<00:01:54.180> they<00:01:54.329> didn't
