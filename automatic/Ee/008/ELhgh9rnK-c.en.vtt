 reforming the surveillance program n.b. 

00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:13.829
 however this did not happen instead 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.049
 the president took the side of the agency and 

00:00:13.829 --> 00:00:18.210
 praised his work clearly 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.910
 understand that unprecedented collection 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.949
 citizens' metadata will continue like this 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.029
 Obama's called reforms did not touch 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.099
 prism programs 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.779
 which allows nb to follow 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.599
 citizen activity on the Internet 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.600
 including email chat and 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:35.490
 search queries and video calls are also 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.040
 the president did not mention activity 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:40.410
 nb related to burglary technology 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.720
 encryption or collecting information about 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.320
 location of people, and so what 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.540
 will change 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.220
 Obama is against you being a government 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.710
 continued to monitor storage 

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:51.690
 metadata he suggested that information 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.210
 about the calls of all Americans was transmitted 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.280
 third party the us president also 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.230
 stated that at the end of March, the Prosecutor General 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.150
 Eric Holder and Intelligence Officers

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.199
 reviewed various organizations 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:06.330
 eligible to store this metadata 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.700
 in essence, this means that representatives 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.040
 US governments who initiated 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.960
 spyware expansion now 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.160
 will be responsible for limiting their own 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.830
 own authority 

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.659
 moreover, Obama has declared that now if 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.670
 a n b wants to request records 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.890
 telephone conversations he will have 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.180
 each time getting permission from the court 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.510
 Foreign Supervision Cases 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.670
 intelligence known as fayz chord on 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:31.800
 the fact is that this court is secret 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.140
 his meeting is closed 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.570
 the doors and their data are classified and 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.890
 therefore, many fear that a and b not 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.260
 make a lot of work 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.270
 make a request to this court president of the united states 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.520
 declared that thanks to work a n b c 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.830
 last decade has been prevented 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.900
 many terrorist attacks and lives were saved 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.729
 innocent people all over the world but 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.170
 research published in the middle 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.690
 January organization new american 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.280
 foundation suggests otherwise 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.830
 based on this data 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.750
 information which is held and not for Mr. 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:02.790
 has a pronounced effect in 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.040
 prevent terrorist attacks 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.229
 so obama can claim all that 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.970
 but research contradicts him 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.950
 according to 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.950
