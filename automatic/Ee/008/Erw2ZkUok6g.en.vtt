like<00:01:56.990> cameo<00:01:58.900> cameo<00:01:59.900> there's<00:02:00.890> probably<00:02:01.340> a<00:02:01.430> lot

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
like cameo cameo there's probably a lot

and with good reason I think a lot of
the<00:02:53.870> time<00:02:54.079> they're<00:02:54.349> overrated<00:02:54.829> they're

overhyped

overhyped

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.250 
overhyped
and<00:02:56.720> they<00:02:57.680> don't<00:02:57.889> tend<00:02:58.159> to<00:02:58.280> deliver<00:02:59.139> let<00:03:00.139> me

and they don't tend to deliver let me

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:02.319 
and they don't tend to deliver let me
put<00:03:00.470> a<00:03:00.500> bit<00:03:00.650> more<00:03:00.889> of<00:03:01.010> a<00:03:01.159> perspective<00:03:01.879> on<00:03:02.150> to

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:02.329 
put a bit more of a perspective on to

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:04.059 
put a bit more of a perspective on to
this<00:03:02.450> because<00:03:03.019> I've<00:03:03.139> been<00:03:03.260> playing<00:03:03.530> games<00:03:03.799> for

this because I've been playing games for

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:08.170 
this because I've been playing games for
what<00:03:04.430> over<00:03:04.790> thirty<00:03:05.030> years<00:03:05.510> now<00:03:06.790> I've<00:03:07.790> seen

what over thirty years now I've seen
pretty<00:03:08.959> much<00:03:09.109> all<00:03:09.439> there<00:03:09.650> is<00:03:09.680> to<00:03:09.829> be<00:03:10.129> seen<00:03:11.120> in

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
pretty much all there is to be seen in

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.789 
pretty much all there is to be seen in
terms<00:03:11.720> of<00:03:11.959> the<00:03:12.319> growth<00:03:12.500> of<00:03:12.739> video<00:03:13.069> games<00:03:13.459> and

2d sprites and all that doesn't excite
me<00:03:17.510> probably<00:03:17.930> as<00:03:18.079> much<00:03:18.290> as<00:03:18.530> somebody<00:03:18.919> who<00:03:19.099> did

that<00:05:01.849> there<00:05:02.060> is<00:05:02.180> another<00:05:02.419> way<00:05:02.660> than<00:05:02.930> just

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:03.110 
that there is another way than just

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:05.260 
that there is another way than just
doing<00:05:03.620> sprite<00:05:04.099> based<00:05:04.370> games<00:05:04.729> because<00:05:05.090> you

doing sprite based games because you

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:07.570 
doing sprite based games because you
look<00:05:05.690> on<00:05:05.840> Steam<00:05:06.139> it's<00:05:06.380> overloaded<00:05:07.220> with<00:05:07.370> them

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.580 
look on Steam it's overloaded with them

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:11.800 
look on Steam it's overloaded with them
now<00:05:08.590> steam<00:05:09.590> is<00:05:09.800> becoming<00:05:10.310> increasingly<00:05:10.810> more

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:11.810 
now steam is becoming increasingly more

now steam is becoming increasingly more
unmanageable<00:05:12.490> as<00:05:13.490> far<00:05:13.759> as<00:05:13.849> finding<00:05:14.150> good

unmanageable as far as finding good
quality<00:05:14.800> content<00:05:15.800> and<00:05:16.039> it's<00:05:16.729> that's

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:17.030 
quality content and it's that's

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:21.100 
quality content and it's that's
something<00:05:17.419> for<00:05:17.449> another<00:05:17.630> run<00:05:18.169> but<00:05:19.930> most<00:05:20.930> of

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.110 
something for another run but most of

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:26.580 
something for another run but most of
them<00:05:21.259> tend<00:05:21.409> to<00:05:21.560> be<00:05:21.650> this<00:05:22.370> kind<00:05:22.699> of<00:05:24.490> stylized

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:26.590 
them tend to be this kind of stylized

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:29.710 
them tend to be this kind of stylized
pixel<00:05:27.590> stuff<00:05:27.860> and<00:05:28.250> there<00:05:28.880> are<00:05:28.970> a<00:05:29.030> few<00:05:29.210> free<00:05:29.569> D

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:29.720 
pixel stuff and there are a few free D

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:31.810 
pixel stuff and there are a few free D
games<00:05:30.020> and<00:05:30.319> all<00:05:30.409> the<00:05:30.440> very<00:05:31.099> few<00:05:31.430> 3d

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:31.820

platformers<00:05:32.570> and<00:05:32.720> I<00:05:33.050> think<00:05:33.289> they're<00:05:33.409> really

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:33.590 
platformers and I think they're really

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:35.560 
platformers and I think they're really
missing<00:05:33.979> a<00:05:34.099> trick<00:05:34.340> here<00:05:34.639> particularly

missing a trick here particularly

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:37.510 
missing a trick here particularly

unity and things like that that people
use<00:06:09.259> but<00:06:09.680> they're<00:06:09.800> not<00:06:09.889> very<00:06:09.949> sophisticated

we're talking Unreal Engine 4 the full
package<00:06:13.430> here<00:06:14.060> so<00:06:14.750> indie<00:06:15.289> developers<00:06:15.800> are

00:06:15.939 --> 00:06:15.949 
package here so indie developers are

00:06:15.949 --> 00:06:19.089 
package here so indie developers are
going<00:06:16.099> to<00:06:16.159> get<00:06:16.310> cheaper<00:06:16.880> engines<00:06:17.360> and<00:06:17.719> I<00:06:18.620> think

00:06:19.089 --> 00:06:19.099 
going to get cheaper engines and I think

00:06:19.099 --> 00:06:21.909 
going to get cheaper engines and I think
there's<00:06:19.280> less<00:06:19.460> of<00:06:19.520> an<00:06:19.789> excuse<00:06:20.330> now<00:06:20.800> you<00:06:21.800> know

00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:21.919 
there's less of an excuse now you know

00:06:21.919 --> 00:06:23.800 
there's less of an excuse now you know

words we're novel when they first came
out<00:06:25.520> but<00:06:26.090> I<00:06:26.150> think<00:06:26.360> it's<00:06:26.479> time<00:06:26.690> to<00:06:26.719> move<00:06:26.990> on<00:06:27.289> I

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:27.500 
out but I think it's time to move on I

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:28.899 
out but I think it's time to move on I
think<00:06:27.949> it's<00:06:28.070> time<00:06:28.280> for<00:06:28.550> the<00:06:28.639> indie

00:06:28.899 --> 00:06:28.909 
think it's time for the indie

00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:31.540 
think it's time for the indie
development<00:06:29.330> seem<00:06:30.020> to<00:06:30.229> really<00:06:30.469> you<00:06:31.070> know<00:06:31.099> ramp

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:31.550 
development seem to really you know ramp

00:06:31.550 --> 00:06:33.159 
development seem to really you know ramp
it<00:06:31.699> up<00:06:31.820> a<00:06:32.030> little<00:06:32.210> bit<00:06:32.539> particularly

00:06:33.159 --> 00:06:33.169 
it up a little bit particularly

00:06:33.169 --> 00:06:36.250 
it up a little bit particularly
considering<00:06:33.740> that<00:06:34.190> the<00:06:34.490> tools<00:06:34.789> are<00:06:35.240> now<00:06:35.810> far

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:36.260 
considering that the tools are now far

00:06:36.260 --> 00:06:37.810 
considering that the tools are now far
more<00:06:36.469> readily<00:06:36.830> available<00:06:37.010> than<00:06:37.520> they<00:06:37.639> were

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:37.820 
more readily available than they were

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:40.450 
more readily available than they were
say<00:06:38.060> five<00:06:38.089> years<00:06:38.690> ago<00:06:39.070> it<00:06:40.070> would<00:06:40.310> be

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:40.460 
say five years ago it would be

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:42.030 
say five years ago it would be
interesting<00:06:41.089> to<00:06:41.210> say

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:42.040 
interesting to say

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:44.920 
interesting to say
but<00:06:43.040> that's<00:06:43.250> just<00:06:43.430> my<00:06:43.640> but<00:06:44.000> just<00:06:44.240> my<00:06:44.360> faults<00:06:44.750> on

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:44.930 
but that's just my but just my faults on

00:06:44.930 --> 00:06:46.450 
but that's just my but just my faults on
it<00:06:45.050> I'm<00:06:45.200> very<00:06:45.350> much<00:06:45.620> looking<00:06:45.830> forward<00:06:46.250> to<00:06:46.340> the

00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:46.460 
it I'm very much looking forward to the

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:48.220 
it I'm very much looking forward to the
last<00:06:46.490> tinker<00:06:47.180> from<00:06:47.600> why<00:06:47.750> I've<00:06:47.810> seen<00:06:48.050> of<00:06:48.170> the

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:48.230 
last tinker from why I've seen of the

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:50.200 
last tinker from why I've seen of the
gameplay<00:06:48.710> it<00:06:49.010> seems<00:06:49.400> like<00:06:49.580> a<00:06:49.610> game<00:06:49.820> I<00:06:50.030> could

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:50.210 
gameplay it seems like a game I could

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:53.470 
gameplay it seems like a game I could
really<00:06:50.480> get<00:06:50.720> on<00:06:50.810> board<00:06:51.050> with<00:06:51.340> and<00:06:52.340> I'm<00:06:53.120> really

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:53.480 
really get on board with and I'm really

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:55.540 
really get on board with and I'm really
enjoying<00:06:53.630> my<00:06:54.020> PlayStation<00:06:54.980> 2

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:55.550 
enjoying my PlayStation 2

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:58.690 
enjoying my PlayStation 2
I<00:06:55.840> got<00:06:56.840> jak<00:06:57.320> and<00:06:57.500> daxter<00:06:57.830> on<00:06:57.890> the<00:06:58.010> ps3<00:06:58.250> but<00:06:58.580> I'm

00:06:58.690 --> 00:06:58.700 
I got jak and daxter on the ps3 but I'm

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:00.550 
I got jak and daxter on the ps3 but I'm
playing<00:06:58.880> it<00:06:59.090> on<00:06:59.180> the<00:06:59.210> ps2<00:06:59.810> and<00:06:59.960> there's

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:00.560 
playing it on the ps2 and there's

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:01.840 
playing it on the ps2 and there's
something<00:07:00.860> about<00:07:01.070> having<00:07:01.490> the<00:07:01.640> original

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:01.850 
something about having the original

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:04.750 
something about having the original
console<00:07:02.630> release<00:07:03.070> although<00:07:04.070> being<00:07:04.520> in<00:07:04.670> a

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:04.760 
console release although being in a

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:06.310 
console release although being in a
power<00:07:05.000> region<00:07:05.420> it's<00:07:05.570> a<00:07:05.630> bit<00:07:05.780> annoying<00:07:06.050> because

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:06.320 
power region it's a bit annoying because

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:08.290 
power region it's a bit annoying because
even<00:07:06.680> with<00:07:06.830> component<00:07:07.370> cable

00:07:08.290 --> 00:07:08.300

even with component cable
it<00:07:08.630> doesn't<00:07:08.990> necessarily<00:07:09.520> output<00:07:10.520> at<00:07:10.730> 480p<00:07:11.570> it

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:12.290 
it doesn't necessarily output at 480p it

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:14.020 
it doesn't necessarily output at 480p it
tends<00:07:12.470> to<00:07:12.590> be<00:07:12.680> for<00:07:12.920> ATI<00:07:13.220> which<00:07:13.490> is<00:07:13.610> a<00:07:13.640> bit<00:07:13.820> muddy

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:14.030

of<00:07:36.260> fraida<00:07:36.500> platforms<00:07:37.040> do<00:07:37.160> you<00:07:37.250> miss<00:07:37.460> them<00:07:37.700> did

00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:37.940 
of fraida platforms do you miss them did

of fraida platforms do you miss them did
you<00:07:37.970> not<00:07:38.630> like<00:07:38.840> them<00:07:39.020> in<00:07:39.170> the<00:07:39.260> first<00:07:39.470> place<00:07:39.770> do

you not like them in the first place do

00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:41.770 
you not like them in the first place do
you<00:07:39.980> think<00:07:40.190> it's<00:07:40.340> something<00:07:40.580> where<00:07:41.300> the<00:07:41.510> indie

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:41.780 
you think it's something where the indie

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:44.830 
you think it's something where the indie
development<00:07:43.060> community<00:07:44.060> could<00:07:44.240> really<00:07:44.510> make

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:44.840 
development community could really make

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:47.560 
development community could really make
a<00:07:45.590> good<00:07:46.130> headway<00:07:46.400> considering<00:07:47.210> that<00:07:47.300> the<00:07:47.420> big

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:47.570 
a good headway considering that the big

00:07:47.570 --> 00:07:48.850 
a good headway considering that the big
boys<00:07:47.780> don't<00:07:48.110> really<00:07:48.380> want<00:07:48.560> to<00:07:48.650> touch<00:07:48.830> it

00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:48.860 
boys don't really want to touch it

00:07:48.860 --> 00:07:52.380 
boys don't really want to touch it
anymore<00:07:49.340> as<00:07:49.640> a<00:07:49.910> genre<00:07:50.300> anyway<00:07:51.130> although<00:07:52.130> I
