he's<00:00:13.940> the<00:00:14.090> greatest<00:00:14.270> hockey<00:00:14.450> player<00:00:14.750> who<00:00:14.870> ever

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:15.020 
he's the greatest hockey player who ever

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:16.600 
he's the greatest hockey player who ever
lived<00:00:15.200> in<00:00:15.650> my<00:00:15.800> opinion<00:00:16.160> so<00:00:16.280> that's<00:00:16.430> the

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:16.610 
lived in my opinion so that's the

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:18.340 
lived in my opinion so that's the
starting<00:00:16.910> point<00:00:16.970> if<00:00:17.240> anybody<00:00:18.080> who<00:00:18.170> cares

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:18.350 
starting point if anybody who cares

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:21.130 
starting point if anybody who cares
about<00:00:18.500> the<00:00:18.680> game<00:00:18.940> I<00:00:19.940> think<00:00:20.540> it's<00:00:20.780> hard<00:00:20.960> not<00:00:21.080> to

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.140 
about the game I think it's hard not to

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.080 
about the game I think it's hard not to
care<00:00:21.410> about<00:00:21.470> Bobby<00:00:21.770> Orr<00:00:22.010> and<00:00:22.220> and<00:00:22.730> his<00:00:22.880> place

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:23.090 
care about Bobby Orr and and his place

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:26.440 
care about Bobby Orr and and his place
in<00:00:23.270> the<00:00:23.360> game<00:00:23.510> I<00:00:23.750> think<00:00:24.650> beyond<00:00:24.920> that<00:00:25.070> he<00:00:25.580> he's

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:26.450 
in the game I think beyond that he he's

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:28.839 
in the game I think beyond that he he's
one<00:00:26.720> of<00:00:26.750> those<00:00:27.140> rare<00:00:27.500> athletes<00:00:28.400> who<00:00:28.550> I<00:00:28.610> think

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:28.849 
one of those rare athletes who I think

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:32.619 
one of those rare athletes who I think
are<00:00:29.060> originals<00:00:30.699> there<00:00:31.699> are<00:00:31.940> a<00:00:31.970> lot<00:00:32.180> of<00:00:32.210> great

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:32.629 
are originals there are a lot of great

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:34.030 
are originals there are a lot of great
you<00:00:33.050> know<00:00:33.140> not<00:00:33.320> just<00:00:33.350> athletes<00:00:33.770> I<00:00:33.890> could

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:34.040 
you know not just athletes I could

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.619 
you know not just athletes I could
extend<00:00:34.340> it<00:00:34.520> to<00:00:34.610> musicians<00:00:35.059> or<00:00:35.210> artists<00:00:35.540> or

00:00:35.619 --> 00:00:35.629 
extend it to musicians or artists or

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:36.910 
extend it to musicians or artists or
whatever<00:00:35.870> that's<00:00:36.199> I<00:00:36.350> think<00:00:36.500> it's<00:00:36.620> part<00:00:36.800> of<00:00:36.830> the

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920 
whatever that's I think it's part of the

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.910 
whatever that's I think it's part of the
same<00:00:37.070> thing

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:38.920 
same thing

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.470 
same thing
most<00:00:39.920> if<00:00:40.400> you<00:00:40.550> think<00:00:40.730> of<00:00:40.820> the<00:00:41.030> most<00:00:41.150> the<00:00:41.300> great

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
most if you think of the most the great

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.240 
most if you think of the most the great
athletes<00:00:41.629> are<00:00:41.930> kind<00:00:42.410> of<00:00:42.440> a<00:00:42.559> variation<00:00:42.830> on<00:00:43.100> the

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
athletes are kind of a variation on the

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:45.130 
athletes are kind of a variation on the
theme<00:00:43.280> that<00:00:43.519> they've<00:00:43.910> they're<00:00:44.210> the<00:00:44.750> the<00:00:44.930> next

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
theme that they've they're the the next

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:46.840 
theme that they've they're the the next
evolution<00:00:46.010> of<00:00:46.100> something<00:00:46.399> that<00:00:46.489> came<00:00:46.670> before

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:46.850 
evolution of something that came before

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:48.850 
evolution of something that came before
them<00:00:47.210> and<00:00:48.079> you<00:00:48.230> can<00:00:48.350> kind<00:00:48.470> of<00:00:48.500> put<00:00:48.649> them<00:00:48.739> in<00:00:48.800> a

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:48.860 
them and you can kind of put them in a

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.319 
them and you can kind of put them in a
category<00:00:49.280> say<00:00:49.399> well<00:00:49.520> he<00:00:49.610> started<00:00:49.850> like<00:00:50.000> so<00:00:50.180> and

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:50.329 
category say well he started like so and

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:52.840 
category say well he started like so and
so<00:00:50.680> it's<00:00:51.680> again<00:00:51.829> same<00:00:52.190> with<00:00:52.309> musicians<00:00:52.760> you

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850 
so it's again same with musicians you

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:54.459 
so it's again same with musicians you
could<00:00:52.969> say<00:00:53.120> well<00:00:53.300> it's<00:00:53.540> somebody<00:00:54.050> following

00:00:54.459 --> 00:00:54.469 
could say well it's somebody following

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:56.139 
could say well it's somebody following
along<00:00:54.649> the<00:00:54.829> lines<00:00:55.010> of<00:00:55.309> his<00:00:55.550> influences

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:56.149 
along the lines of his influences

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:57.910 
along the lines of his influences
clearly<00:00:56.480> are<00:00:56.690> you<00:00:57.230> know<00:00:57.290> Bobby<00:00:57.530> Orr<00:00:57.739> it's<00:00:57.829> one

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
clearly are you know Bobby Orr it's one

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.520 
clearly are you know Bobby Orr it's one
of<00:00:58.010> those<00:00:58.070> rare<00:00:58.340> ones<00:00:58.550> whose<00:00:58.730> are<00:00:58.850> an<00:00:58.910> original

00:00:59.520 --> 00:00:59.530 
of those rare ones whose are an original

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.479 
of those rare ones whose are an original
he's<00:01:00.530> a<00:01:00.559> one-off<00:01:00.890> he<00:01:01.489> arrives<00:01:02.120> fully<00:01:02.570> formed

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:03.489 
he's a one-off he arrives fully formed

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:07.690 
he's a one-off he arrives fully formed
really<00:01:04.489> as<00:01:04.699> a<00:01:04.729> kid<00:01:05.030> almost<00:01:05.300> and<00:01:05.720> and<00:01:06.710> reinvents

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
really as a kid almost and and reinvents

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.749 
really as a kid almost and and reinvents
or<00:01:07.850> reimagines<00:01:08.600> the<00:01:08.690> game<00:01:09.250> or<00:01:10.250> at<00:01:10.369> least<00:01:10.520> his

00:01:10.749 --> 00:01:10.759 
or reimagines the game or at least his

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:12.310 
or reimagines the game or at least his
position<00:01:11.180> playing<00:01:11.450> defense<00:01:11.750> and<00:01:11.990> in<00:01:12.110> hockey

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:12.320 
position playing defense and in hockey

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.590 
position playing defense and in hockey
and<00:01:12.590> and<00:01:12.830> I<00:01:12.920> think<00:01:13.130> the<00:01:13.789> I<00:01:14.210> always<00:01:14.420> come<00:01:14.570> back

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
and and I think the I always come back

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:15.730 
and and I think the I always come back
to<00:01:14.750> the<00:01:14.869> same<00:01:14.990> kind<00:01:15.140> of<00:01:15.170> points<00:01:15.410> of<00:01:15.500> comparison

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
to the same kind of points of comparison

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.440 
to the same kind of points of comparison
but<00:01:16.130> they're<00:01:16.250> there<00:01:16.369> and<00:01:16.399> they<00:01:16.520> they're

familiar chord progression and turn it

00:01:29.599 --> 00:01:31.809 
familiar chord progression and turn it
inverted<00:01:30.140> somehow<00:01:30.500> I<00:01:30.709> think<00:01:31.099> or<00:01:31.250> takes<00:01:31.580> hockey

00:01:31.809 --> 00:01:31.819 
inverted somehow I think or takes hockey

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:33.669 
inverted somehow I think or takes hockey
and<00:01:32.179> sees<00:01:32.509> it<00:01:32.750> in<00:01:32.929> a<00:01:33.050> different<00:01:33.200> way<00:01:33.530> and

00:01:33.669 --> 00:01:33.679 
and sees it in a different way and

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:35.290 
and sees it in a different way and
because<00:01:33.920> of<00:01:33.950> the<00:01:34.130> skills<00:01:34.429> he<00:01:34.580> has<00:01:34.759> which<00:01:35.119> are

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:35.300 
because of the skills he has which are

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.830 
because of the skills he has which are
unique<00:01:36.160> he<00:01:37.160> can<00:01:37.369> he<00:01:37.700> can<00:01:37.849> really<00:01:38.060> can<00:01:38.569> live<00:01:38.720> it

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
unique he can he can really can live it

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.370 
unique he can he can really can live it
out<00:01:38.959> he<00:01:39.229> can<00:01:39.410> he<00:01:39.770> can<00:01:39.979> express<00:01:40.369> it<00:01:40.670> in<00:01:41.569> a<00:01:42.229> way

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
out he can he can express it in a way
