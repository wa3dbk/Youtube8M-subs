00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
got two HP pavilions here one sometimes

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.509 
got two HP pavilions here one sometimes
has<00:00:04.560> no<00:00:04.890> video<00:00:05.899> the<00:00:06.899> other<00:00:07.020> one<00:00:07.259> always<00:00:07.589> has<00:00:08.189> no

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
video and what I did is I put a card in

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.660 
video and what I did is I put a card in
the<00:00:12.210> PCI<00:00:12.630> slot<00:00:13.139> and<00:00:13.500> the<00:00:13.679> video<00:00:14.040> works<00:00:14.340> totally

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
the PCI slot and the video works totally

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.720 
the PCI slot and the video works totally
solid<00:00:15.320> sister<00:00:16.320> machine<00:00:16.710> taken<00:00:17.279> apart<00:00:17.609> and

solid sister machine taken apart and

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.759 
solid sister machine taken apart and
what<00:00:20.730> I<00:00:20.760> found<00:00:21.119> was<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:21.600> video<00:00:21.990> here<00:00:22.350> didn't

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
what I found was the video here didn't

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.170 
what I found was the video here didn't
work<00:00:23.010> and<00:00:24.260> this<00:00:25.260> port<00:00:25.680> coming<00:00:26.130> out<00:00:26.310> of<00:00:26.460> here<00:00:26.820> on

work and this port coming out of here on
the<00:00:27.240> video<00:00:28.019> would<00:00:28.590> be<00:00:28.650> intermittent<00:00:29.400> and<00:00:29.699> he'd

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
the video would be intermittent and he'd

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.479 
the video would be intermittent and he'd
booted<00:00:30.960> up<00:00:31.109> it<00:00:31.349> act<00:00:31.529> like<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.859> power<00:00:32.070> supplies

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
booted up it act like the power supplies

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.700 
booted up it act like the power supplies
did<00:00:32.880> you<00:00:33.540> couldn't<00:00:33.750> get<00:00:33.960> into<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.320> BIOS

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
did you couldn't get into the BIOS

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.220 
did you couldn't get into the BIOS
sometimes<00:00:35.160> you<00:00:35.340> could<00:00:35.550> get<00:00:35.820> in<00:00:36.230> everything

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
sometimes you could get in everything

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.799 
sometimes you could get in everything
was<00:00:37.350> acting<00:00:37.739> totally<00:00:37.920> screwy<00:00:38.520> and<00:00:38.910> here<00:00:39.660> I've

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
was acting totally screwy and here I've

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.290 
was acting totally screwy and here I've
got<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.680> unit<00:00:40.980> running<00:00:41.370> with<00:00:41.550> what<00:00:42.059> it<00:00:42.149> came

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
got the unit running with what it came

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.020 
got the unit running with what it came
installed<00:00:42.750> four<00:00:43.500> years<00:00:43.770> ago<00:00:43.920> which<00:00:44.340> was<00:00:44.370> Vista

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
installed four years ago which was Vista

installed four years ago which was Vista
Home<00:00:45.210> Premium<00:00:45.559> but<00:00:46.559> anyways<00:00:47.239> at<00:00:48.239> first<00:00:48.510> I

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
Home Premium but anyways at first I

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.209 
Home Premium but anyways at first I
thought<00:00:48.960> there<00:00:49.410> was<00:00:49.530> something<00:00:49.770> wrong<00:00:50.070> with

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
thought there was something wrong with

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.520 
thought there was something wrong with
my<00:00:50.370> monitor<00:00:50.879> change<00:00:51.660> tried<00:00:51.899> to<00:00:52.230> several

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
my monitor change tried to several

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.740 
my monitor change tried to several
different<00:00:52.620> monitors<00:00:53.219> it's<00:00:54.090> not<00:00:54.300> anything

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
different monitors it's not anything

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.150 
different monitors it's not anything
wrong<00:00:54.989> with<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.469> connector<00:00:55.980> but<00:00:56.250> the

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
wrong with the connector but the

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.639 
wrong with the connector but the
graphics<00:00:59.160> on<00:00:59.370> this<00:00:59.609> machine<00:01:00.059> is<00:01:00.420> flaky<00:01:01.410> and

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
graphics on this machine is flaky and

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.529 
graphics on this machine is flaky and
intermediate<00:01:02.280> so<00:01:02.550> what<00:01:02.730> I<00:01:02.760> did<00:01:02.879> is<00:01:03.239> I<00:01:03.329> went

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
intermediate so what I did is I went

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.810 
intermediate so what I did is I went
through<00:01:04.070> intermittent<00:01:05.070> I<00:01:05.189> went<00:01:05.400> through<00:01:05.640> and

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
through intermittent I went through and

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.530 
through intermittent I went through and
got<00:01:05.990> another<00:01:06.990> video<00:01:07.439> card<00:01:07.830> this<00:01:08.100> is<00:01:08.250> from<00:01:08.780> 1996

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540 
got another video card this is from 1996

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.050 
got another video card this is from 1996
IBM<00:01:12.540> put<00:01:13.049> this<00:01:13.200> into<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.590> PCI<00:01:14.040> slot<00:01:14.549> and<00:01:14.880> lo

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
IBM put this into the PCI slot and lo

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.870 
IBM put this into the PCI slot and lo
and<00:01:15.210> behold<00:01:15.360> all<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.830> video<00:01:17.159> problems<00:01:17.610> went

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
and behold all the video problems went

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.420 
and behold all the video problems went
away<00:01:18.170> so<00:01:19.170> then<00:01:19.439> I<00:01:19.470> went<00:01:19.740> ahead<00:01:19.890> and<00:01:20.250> put<00:01:20.400> a

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
away so then I went ahead and put a

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.330 
away so then I went ahead and put a
better<00:01:20.640> card<00:01:21.030> this<00:01:21.240> is<00:01:21.299> a<00:01:21.450> 32<00:01:21.869> Meg<00:01:22.259> card<00:01:22.650> it's

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
better card this is a 32 Meg card it's

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.039 
better card this is a 32 Meg card it's
the<00:01:23.369> wrong<00:01:23.640> card<00:01:24.030> that's<00:01:24.299> why<00:01:24.479> it's<00:01:24.630> too<00:01:24.810> tall

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
the wrong card that's why it's too tall

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.270 
the wrong card that's why it's too tall
but<00:01:25.110> if<00:01:25.590> you<00:01:25.950> put<00:01:26.189> a<00:01:26.479> VC<00:01:27.479> a<00:01:27.509> PCI<00:01:28.259> card<00:01:28.770> in<00:01:28.979> here

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
but if you put a VC a PCI card in here

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.780 
but if you put a VC a PCI card in here
or<00:01:29.460> a<00:01:29.790> PCI<00:01:30.270> Express<00:01:30.780> card<00:01:31.259> what<00:01:32.070> it<00:01:32.220> does<00:01:32.430> is

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
or a PCI Express card what it does is

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.910 
or a PCI Express card what it does is
evidently<00:01:33.180> in<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.540> BIOS<00:01:33.900> that<00:01:33.930> automatically

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
evidently in the BIOS that automatically

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.399 
evidently in the BIOS that automatically
will<00:01:35.549> use<00:01:35.820> one<00:01:36.210> of<00:01:36.240> these<00:01:36.420> cards<00:01:36.960> instead<00:01:37.259> of

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
will use one of these cards instead of

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.130 
will use one of these cards instead of
the<00:01:37.500> built<00:01:37.740> in<00:01:38.009> and<00:01:38.670> then<00:01:38.850> all<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.540> problems<00:01:39.990> I

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
the built in and then all the problems I

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.590 
the built in and then all the problems I
had<00:01:40.350> went<00:01:40.619> away<00:01:40.740> so<00:01:41.090> here<00:01:42.090> I've<00:01:42.299> got<00:01:42.540> a<00:01:42.829> HP<00:01:44.600> 3700

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
had went away so here I've got a HP 3700

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.260 
had went away so here I've got a HP 3700
F<00:01:45.750> pavilion<00:01:46.530> and<00:01:46.770> I've<00:01:47.430> got<00:01:47.579> it<00:01:47.729> all<00:01:47.820> taken

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
F pavilion and I've got it all taken

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.149 
F pavilion and I've got it all taken
apart<00:01:48.600> but<00:01:48.960> it's<00:01:49.500> going<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:49.710> throw<00:01:49.890> it<00:01:50.009> in<00:01:50.100> the

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
apart but it's going to throw it in the

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.280 
apart but it's going to throw it in the
trash<00:01:50.460> and<00:01:50.490> then<00:01:50.880> lo<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:51.090> behold<00:01:51.329> I<00:01:51.780> found<00:01:52.049> out

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
trash and then lo and behold I found out

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.160 
trash and then lo and behold I found out
by<00:01:52.500> putting<00:01:52.770> a<00:01:53.040> video<00:01:53.430> card<00:01:53.729> in<00:01:54.000> here<00:01:54.329> that<00:01:54.990> all

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
by putting a video card in here that all

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.530 
by putting a video card in here that all
its<00:01:55.619> weirdness<00:01:56.009> went<00:01:56.369> away<00:01:56.460> and<00:01:56.969> the

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
its weirdness went away and the

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.170 
its weirdness went away and the
characteristics<00:01:58.350> I<00:01:58.500> had<00:01:58.770> were<00:01:59.009> that<00:01:59.460> the

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
characteristics I had were that the

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.850 
characteristics I had were that the
machine<00:02:00.509> either<00:02:00.719> acted<00:02:01.229> like<00:02:01.350> it<00:02:01.560> didn't<00:02:01.740> want

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
machine either acted like it didn't want

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.359 
machine either acted like it didn't want
a<00:02:02.009> boot<00:02:02.219> or<00:02:02.520> if<00:02:03.119> it<00:02:03.240> did<00:02:03.479> you'd<00:02:04.200> get<00:02:04.469> up<00:02:04.619> into<00:02:04.829> a

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
a boot or if it did you'd get up into a

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.850 
a boot or if it did you'd get up into a
screen<00:02:05.909> and<00:02:06.270> it<00:02:06.899> would<00:02:07.049> go<00:02:07.200> through<00:02:07.229> and<00:02:07.649> drop

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
screen and it would go through and drop

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.499

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
resurrect this old pavilion for four

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.259 
resurrect this old pavilion for four
years<00:03:37.949> ago<00:03:38.129> and<00:03:39.019> seems<00:03:40.019> to<00:03:40.169> work<00:03:40.319> flawlessly

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:41.269 
years ago and seems to work flawlessly

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:44.360 
years ago and seems to work flawlessly
so<00:03:42.769> that's<00:03:43.769> what<00:03:44.009> I<00:03:44.040> did

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
so that's what I did

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.659 
so that's what I did
and<00:03:44.669> then<00:03:44.879> I've<00:03:45.030> got<00:03:45.889> Vista<00:03:46.889> working<00:03:47.459> here

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:47.669 
and then I've got Vista working here

00:03:47.669 --> 00:03:50.569 
and then I've got Vista working here

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.780

uh<00:03:57.620> they<00:03:58.620> don't<00:03:58.829> tend<00:03:59.069> to<00:03:59.159> work<00:03:59.370> or<00:03:59.609> something

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
uh they don't tend to work or something

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:04.429

light<00:04:09.419> would<00:04:09.659> come<00:04:09.689> on<00:04:09.930> here<00:04:10.530> like<00:04:10.889> it's

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:11.099 
light would come on here like it's

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:14.689 
light would come on here like it's
booting<00:04:11.519> and<00:04:12.019> there<00:04:13.019> would<00:04:13.139> be<00:04:13.169> no<00:04:13.470> video<00:04:13.739> now

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:14.699 
booting and there would be no video now

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:17.270 
booting and there would be no video now
to<00:04:14.759> turn<00:04:15.030> it<00:04:15.209> off<00:04:15.449> turn<00:04:15.900> it<00:04:15.930> back<00:04:16.169> on<00:04:16.380> again<00:04:16.409> and

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
to turn it off turn it back on again and

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.719 
to turn it off turn it back on again and
after<00:04:17.880> three<00:04:18.120> or<00:04:18.150> four<00:04:18.269> or<00:04:18.509> five<00:04:18.690> boots<00:04:19.079> of<00:04:19.729> I

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:20.729 
after three or four or five boots of I

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:23.420 
after three or four or five boots of I
would<00:04:21.030> finally<00:04:21.419> get<00:04:21.570> it<00:04:21.690> into<00:04:21.989> a<00:04:22.019> screen<00:04:22.500> it

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
would finally get it into a screen it

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.370 
would finally get it into a screen it
would<00:04:23.550> boot<00:04:23.760> up<00:04:24.000> and<00:04:24.210> so<00:04:24.419> I<00:04:24.450> had<00:04:24.779> people<00:04:25.050> tell

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
would boot up and so I had people tell

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:27.170 
would boot up and so I had people tell
him<00:04:25.469> it<00:04:25.560> was<00:04:25.680> the<00:04:25.800> power<00:04:26.039> supply

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
him it was the power supply
