00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:10.850
 hello and welcome to automoto en 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:13.519
 Finland in the north of Finland 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:16.150
 to test exclusively the new 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:18.230
 audi rs 3 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:20.750
 so here we have a gray model that is 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:23.570
 presented here we will immediately watched 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:26.329
 19-inch wheels 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:28.550
 so we are in winter tires obviously and 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:32.300
 watch the brake calipers at eight 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.880
 pistons are the same as in an audi 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.530
 r8 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.870
 this is a sportback version 1 5 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.829
 doors as you can see this 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.710
 engine is coupled to a line 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:44.769
 completely revised exhaust and there we 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.030
 optional sport exhaust 

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:48.379
 look in the chest why are we going 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.690
 look at the chest is the same as a 

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:52.309
 a3 standard sportback but the great 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.640
 difference is the position of the 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:58.640
 battery was located see here at 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:02.780
 the rear in the center to optimize 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:04.909
 the distribution of masses see in 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:08.900
 open the hood and we discover the 5 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:09.820
 cylinders 2 liters 5 turbo making 367 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:14.380
 horses 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:16.930
 more than 460 newton-meters of torque 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:20.369
 turbo that now blow to 1.3 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:24.210
 bar before that it was 1.2 bar on 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.210
 the rs3 2011 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.140
 hop 

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:31.450
 let's look inside the first 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:35.380
 something that is obvious is his 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:39.100
 aerators look at red background and its 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.929
 decoration carbon slats it's 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:44.289
 always really impeccable in finishing 

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:47.860
 at audi but look at the seats 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:51.659
 padded leather bucket with 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:54.490
 many settings even on the passenger side 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:57.069
 here we can see the double box 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:59.560
 Seven-speed robotic clutch 

00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:03.130
 there the flat wheel and the pedal 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:05.890
 aluminum place on this gray model we have 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:10.269
 an option with a specific grille 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:13.349
 black and lacquered black sill 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:15.280
 also it is an option 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:17.200
 so we did not find this version 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.049
 gray in static but we're going 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:24.750
 try this model blocks exactly the 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:24.750
 even on a frozen lake 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:37.459
 it crackles well the sound is nice go 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:42.350
 so we start inside the noise 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:43.820
 is less marked than outside and the 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:46.370
 direction was seeing her in value is when 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:49.520
 even enough all breeds puts in mode 

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:51.680
 good first manual sport and that's 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:53.510
 left my first love so much to this 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.520
 city let go seconds 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.190
 we can go off on the track of 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.550
 ice cream 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.550
 I was reading 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:08.200
 if they were driving honda pop up 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.909
 of foot she automatically registers 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.659
 it looks like we have a propulsion 

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:13.330
 kind of weird 

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:15.819
 when you enter 90 degrees in 

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:19.409
 trunks and ready to go upside down what 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:23.290
 we see on the see automatically 

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:26.049
 yielded hop the pop the same foot see I 

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:28.120
 make me serious fast she is recovering 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:29.739
 it's a video game there is no need to be 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.989
 a pilot to know how to drive fast 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:33.790
 this car can be said that this 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:36.700
 Christmas generation remains not always so 

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:39.700
 easy efficient but much more agile 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:43.120
 grass to this ex last generation 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:46.150
 is 55 kg lighter than the old 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.510
 rs3 with more power and 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.579
 couple 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:51.010
 so we have one car at a time more 

00:03:48.579 --> 00:03:55.140
 performing more playful and easier 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.140
 see you soon on automoto
