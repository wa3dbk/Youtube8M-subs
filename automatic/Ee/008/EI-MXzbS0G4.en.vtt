00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
song about solution from Intel so we

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.320 
song about solution from Intel so we
have<00:00:27.960> a<00:00:27.990> live<00:00:28.260> demo<00:00:28.590> in<00:00:28.769> here<00:00:29.250> and<00:00:29.429> today<00:00:30.090> we're

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
have a live demo in here and today we're

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:31.910 
have a live demo in here and today we're
going<00:00:30.359> to<00:00:30.480> show<00:00:30.539> you<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.869> to<00:00:31.170> portend<00:00:31.590> about

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
going to show you the to portend about

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.580 
going to show you the to portend about
solution<00:00:32.489> but<00:00:32.969> we<00:00:33.120> can<00:00:33.329> do<00:00:33.570> with<00:00:33.899> this<00:00:34.170> kind<00:00:34.469> of

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
solution but we can do with this kind of

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.830 
solution but we can do with this kind of
like<00:00:34.829> Asian<00:00:35.280> right<00:00:36.120> so<00:00:36.390> all<00:00:36.420> the<00:00:36.690> other

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
like Asian right so all the other

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.540 
like Asian right so all the other
Thunderbolt<00:00:37.440> motherboards<00:00:37.980> so<00:00:38.190> far<00:00:38.430> I've

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
Thunderbolt motherboards so far I've

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.100 
Thunderbolt motherboards so far I've
only<00:00:38.610> had<00:00:38.820> a<00:00:38.879> single<00:00:39.149> port<00:00:39.510> so<00:00:39.629> this<00:00:39.780> is<00:00:39.899> quite

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
only had a single port so this is quite

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.959 
only had a single port so this is quite
different<00:00:40.320> right<00:00:40.649> yes<00:00:41.070> because<00:00:41.610> to<00:00:41.790> ball

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
different right yes because to ball

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.970 
different right yes because to ball
solution<00:00:42.360> we<00:00:42.600> sing<00:00:42.840> a<00:00:42.870> more<00:00:43.140> flexible<00:00:43.590> when

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
solution we sing a more flexible when

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.040 
solution we sing a more flexible when
you<00:00:44.070> use<00:00:44.250> each<00:00:44.520> for<00:00:44.789> example<00:00:45.090> in<00:00:45.210> here<00:00:45.480> you<00:00:45.930> can

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
you use each for example in here you can

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.410 
you use each for example in here you can
see<00:00:46.260> our<00:00:46.379> demo<00:00:46.680> here<00:00:46.950> we<00:00:47.430> have<00:00:47.640> a<00:00:47.670> one<00:00:48.059> system

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
see our demo here we have a one system

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.790 
see our demo here we have a one system
with<00:00:48.570> one<00:00:48.719> chain<00:00:49.079> with<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.289> different

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
with one chain with a different

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.830 
with one chain with a different
application<00:00:50.250> and<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.030> election<00:00:51.300> we<00:00:51.660> have<00:00:51.809> a

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
application and the election we have a

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.470 
application and the election we have a
different<00:00:52.350> storage<00:00:52.770> applying<00:00:53.340> so<00:00:53.879> give<00:00:54.180> more

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
different storage applying so give more

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.139 
different storage applying so give more
flexible<00:00:55.020> and<00:00:55.260> plus<00:00:55.710> each<00:00:56.100> thought<00:00:56.879> of

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
flexible and plus each thought of

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.000 
flexible and plus each thought of
alternative<00:00:57.600> are<00:00:57.719> able<00:00:58.020> to<00:00:58.140> support<00:00:58.500> system

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
alternative are able to support system

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.360 
alternative are able to support system
65<00:00:59.879> plus<00:01:00.210> one<00:01:00.510> monitor<00:01:00.989> so<00:01:01.530> we<00:01:01.680> stopped<00:01:01.949> 24

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
65 plus one monitor so we stopped 24

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.700 
65 plus one monitor so we stopped 24
solution<00:01:02.850> I<00:01:02.940> can<00:01:02.969> do<00:01:03.359> up<00:01:03.629> to<00:01:03.660> 12<00:01:04.140> device<00:01:04.439> with

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
solution I can do up to 12 device with

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.310 
solution I can do up to 12 device with
to<00:01:04.890> monitor<00:01:05.339> that<00:01:05.760> difference<00:01:06.180> right<00:01:06.930> so<00:01:07.260> you

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
to monitor that difference right so you

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.350 
to monitor that difference right so you
get<00:01:07.799> much<00:01:08.010> more<00:01:08.189> connectivity<00:01:08.640> option<00:01:09.180> with

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
get much more connectivity option with

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.010 
get much more connectivity option with
this<00:01:09.510> yes<00:01:10.310> okay<00:01:11.310> so<00:01:11.790> right<00:01:12.180> now<00:01:12.210> I<00:01:12.390> gotta<00:01:12.810> show

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
so 12 HD video together you can see all

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.009 
so 12 HD video together you can see all
the<00:02:10.039> frame<00:02:10.610> rates<00:02:10.849> pretty<00:02:11.120> smooth<00:02:11.480> and<00:02:11.780> not

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:12.019 
the frame rates pretty smooth and not

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:14.740 
the frame rates pretty smooth and not
dropping<00:02:12.379> okay<00:02:13.099> and<00:02:13.370> also<00:02:13.760> with<00:02:14.090> this<00:02:14.360> kind<00:02:14.660> of

point I like even very fast forward you

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.420 
point I like even very fast forward you
will<00:02:26.540> see<00:02:26.720> the<00:02:26.840> rate<00:02:27.110> rise<00:02:27.470> working<00:02:28.040> very<00:02:28.220> high

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
will see the rate rise working very high

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.690 
will see the rate rise working very high
see<00:02:28.849> that<00:02:29.030> post<00:02:29.870> lights<00:02:30.319> blinking<00:02:31.010> very<00:02:31.519> hot

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:31.700 
see that post lights blinking very hot

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.259

so<00:02:32.030> because<00:02:32.360> I<00:02:32.450> to<00:02:32.510> shift<00:02:33.019> on<00:02:33.200> the<00:02:33.230> fly<00:02:34.269> okay

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:35.269 
so because I to shift on the fly okay

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:37.420 
so because I to shift on the fly okay
but<00:02:35.840> you<00:02:36.079> won't<00:02:36.380> see<00:02:36.590> this<00:02:36.709> kind<00:02:36.950> performance

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430
