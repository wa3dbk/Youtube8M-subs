through we've got three key been stories
we've<00:00:11.190> got<00:00:11.400> traditional<00:00:11.940> camber<00:00:12.330> we've<00:00:12.929> got

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
we've got traditional camber we've got

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.810 
we've got traditional camber we've got
rocker<00:00:13.469> and<00:00:13.799> then<00:00:14.219> kind<00:00:14.370> of<00:00:14.490> bringing<00:00:14.759> the

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.490 
configurations out there but you just
can't<00:00:27.740> deny<00:00:28.670> the<00:00:28.730> time<00:00:29.420> and<00:00:29.780> the<00:00:29.900> testing

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:30.500 
can't deny the time and the testing

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.950 
can't deny the time and the testing
that's<00:00:30.650> been<00:00:30.830> put<00:00:31.130> into<00:00:31.310> a<00:00:31.790> can<00:00:32.239> bird<00:00:32.419> board<00:00:32.720> I

that's been put into a can bird board I
mean<00:00:33.950> the<00:00:34.160> precision<00:00:34.400> in<00:00:35.090> the<00:00:35.210> turning<00:00:35.750> that

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:36.410 
mean the precision in the turning that

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.400 
mean the precision in the turning that
it<00:00:36.560> provides<00:00:37.040> and<00:00:37.520> then<00:00:37.730> also<00:00:38.150> the<00:00:38.570> suspension

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
it provides and then also the suspension

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:45.220 
across the board from tip to tail I mean

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.650 
across the board from tip to tail I mean
you<00:00:46.220> just<00:00:46.460> can't<00:00:46.520> be<00:00:46.940> that<00:00:47.120> you<00:00:47.239> can't<00:00:47.480> beat

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
you just can't be that you can't beat

you just can't be that you can't beat
the<00:00:47.840> response<00:00:48.320> and<00:00:48.590> you<00:00:48.680> can't<00:00:48.950> beat<00:00:49.100> the<00:00:49.309> edge

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
the response and you can't beat the edge

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:55.690 
the response and you can't beat the edge
control<00:00:49.820> you<00:00:50.180> get<00:00:50.330> out<00:00:50.480> of<00:00:50.600> a<00:00:50.660> camber<00:00:51.020> board
