00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:05.299 

okay<00:00:01.020> so<00:00:01.680> I<00:00:01.709> want<00:00:02.520> to<00:00:02.610> show<00:00:02.960> you<00:00:03.960> how<00:00:04.259> to<00:00:04.309> cut

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:05.309 
okay so I want to show you how to cut

00:00:05.309 --> 00:00:08.539 
okay so I want to show you how to cut
down<00:00:05.519> the<00:00:05.879> banana<00:00:06.359> tree<00:00:06.889> so<00:00:07.889> I<00:00:07.950> already<00:00:08.160> cut

00:00:08.539 --> 00:00:08.549 
down the banana tree so I already cut

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:13.930 
down the banana tree so I already cut
off<00:00:08.790> the<00:00:09.139> banana<00:00:10.139> fruit<00:00:11.240> all<00:00:12.240> right

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:13.940 
off the banana fruit all right

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:23.240 
off the banana fruit all right
here's<00:00:14.940> the<00:00:15.059> tree<00:00:20.960> saw<00:00:21.960> most<00:00:22.199> people<00:00:22.560> cut<00:00:23.099> it

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
here's the tree saw most people cut it

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.240 
here's the tree saw most people cut it
up<00:00:23.369> here<00:00:23.609> and<00:00:24.060> then<00:00:24.119> they<00:00:25.050> chopped<00:00:25.439> off<00:00:25.619> but

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
up here and then they chopped off but

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.200 
up here and then they chopped off but
hopefully<00:00:27.029> this<00:00:27.210> method<00:00:27.689> is<00:00:27.810> I<00:00:27.990> easier<00:00:29.179> what<00:00:30.179> I

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
hopefully this method is I easier what I

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.960 
hopefully this method is I easier what I
do<00:00:30.300> is<00:00:30.509> a<00:00:31.099> get<00:00:32.099> a<00:00:32.160> really<00:00:32.520> soft

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:32.970 
do is a get a really soft

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.450 
do is a get a really soft
well<00:00:33.720> not<00:00:34.020> really<00:00:34.320> it<00:00:34.890> doesn't<00:00:35.190> need<00:00:35.280> to<00:00:35.340> be<00:00:35.430> a

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
well not really it doesn't need to be a

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.170 
well not really it doesn't need to be a
sharp<00:00:35.850> knife<00:00:36.500> just<00:00:37.500> any<00:00:37.860> night<00:00:38.100> but<00:00:38.160> a<00:00:38.430> smaller

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
sharp knife just any night but a smaller

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:45.740 
sharp knife just any night but a smaller
better<00:00:39.660> but<00:00:40.260> long<00:00:41.690> so<00:00:42.770> here's<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:44.540> tree<00:00:45.540> that

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
better but long so here's the tree that

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.800 
better but long so here's the tree that
I<00:00:45.780> cut<00:00:46.140> earlier<00:00:46.910> what<00:00:47.910> it<00:00:48.000> does<00:00:48.180> that<00:00:48.210> leave<00:00:48.780> a

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:48.810 
I cut earlier what it does that leave a

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:50.420 
I cut earlier what it does that leave a
hole<00:00:49.110> but<00:00:49.380> then<00:00:49.500> it's<00:00:49.680> going<00:00:49.800> to<00:00:49.860> get<00:00:50.190> filled

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
hole but then it's going to get filled

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.180 
hole but then it's going to get filled
with<00:00:50.580> dirt<00:00:50.790> and<00:00:50.970> then<00:00:51.480> auto<00:00:51.840> plan<00:00:52.230> that<00:00:52.500> around

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
with dirt and then auto plan that around

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.510 
with dirt and then auto plan that around
it<00:00:53.570> get<00:00:54.570> a<00:00:54.600> chance<00:00:54.900> to<00:00:55.080> grow<00:00:55.290> and<00:00:55.620> it<00:00:56.190> doesn't

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
it get a chance to grow and it doesn't

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:04.639 
it get a chance to grow and it doesn't
be<00:00:56.700> a<00:00:57.050> bulky<00:00:58.050> kind<00:00:58.920> of<00:00:58.980> like<00:01:03.110> folk<00:01:04.110> on<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.469> bill

00:01:04.639 --> 00:01:04.649 
be a bulky kind of like folk on the bill

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:08.270 
be a bulky kind of like folk on the bill
and<00:01:04.890> go<00:01:05.070> in<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.489> dirt<00:01:05.640> I<00:01:05.850> guess<00:01:06.060> the<00:01:07.049> way<00:01:07.280> so

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
and go in the dirt I guess the way so

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.999 
and go in the dirt I guess the way so
what<00:01:08.429> you<00:01:08.549> want<00:01:08.820> to<00:01:08.909> do<00:01:09.060> is<00:01:09.210> add<00:01:09.899> an<00:01:10.049> angle<00:01:10.409> push

00:01:10.999 --> 00:01:11.009 
what you want to do is add an angle push

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:15.679 
what you want to do is add an angle push
it<00:01:11.159> in<00:01:11.250> I<00:01:12.439> did<00:01:13.439> it's<00:01:13.649> just<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:14.329> little<00:01:15.329> bit<00:01:15.450> hard

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
it in I did it's just a little bit hard

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:21.560 
it in I did it's just a little bit hard
ah<00:01:16.969> so<00:01:17.969> so<00:01:18.689> I'm<00:01:18.810> doing<00:01:19.020> just<00:01:20.090> poke<00:01:21.090> through<00:01:21.390> it

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
ah so so I'm doing just poke through it

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:35.469 
ah so so I'm doing just poke through it
and<00:01:21.780> then<00:01:22.229> move<00:01:22.619> back<00:01:22.920> and<00:01:23.159> forth

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:39.050 

as<00:01:36.479> you<00:01:36.630> can<00:01:36.720> see<00:01:36.930> that<00:01:37.400> I'm<00:01:38.400> cutting<00:01:38.909> through

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
as you can see that I'm cutting through

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.590 
as you can see that I'm cutting through
it<00:01:39.150> with<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:39.960> DOS<00:01:40.200> IRA<00:01:40.530> here<00:01:40.890> so<00:01:41.790> deny<00:01:42.180> doesn't

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
it with the DOS IRA here so deny doesn't

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:58.310 
it with the DOS IRA here so deny doesn't
need<00:01:42.690> to<00:01:42.780> be<00:01:42.900> soft<00:01:43.170> so<00:01:56.420> what<00:01:57.420> I'm<00:01:57.540> doing<00:01:57.570> is<00:01:57.990> try

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
need to be soft so what I'm doing is try

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:05.050 
need to be soft so what I'm doing is try
to<00:01:58.380> cut<00:01:58.950> ace<00:01:59.420> try<00:02:00.420> to<00:02:00.479> separate<00:02:03.380> the<00:02:04.380> load<00:02:04.590> one

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
to cut ace try to separate the load one

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.020 
to cut ace try to separate the load one
from<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.180> plant<00:02:07.039> and<00:02:08.039> I'm<00:02:08.280> going<00:02:08.459> to<00:02:08.550> use<00:02:08.759> the

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
from the plant and I'm going to use the

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:24.500 
from the plant and I'm going to use the
weight<00:02:09.479> opt<00:02:09.750> up<00:02:10.700> plan<00:02:11.700> and<00:02:13.220> you<00:02:14.220> know<00:02:15.860> break<00:02:16.860> it

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:32.949 

so<00:02:25.940> after<00:02:26.940> I<00:02:26.970> cut<00:02:27.450> about<00:02:27.599> half<00:02:28.110> of<00:02:28.230> it<00:02:28.849> push<00:02:29.849> it

00:02:32.949 --> 00:02:32.959 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:36.740 

better<00:02:33.959> way<00:02:34.200> out<00:02:34.610> if<00:02:35.610> you<00:02:35.760> open<00:02:36.030> you<00:02:36.299> if<00:02:36.629> you

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
better way out if you open you if you

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.100 
better way out if you open you if you
have<00:02:36.900> the<00:02:37.040> tar<00:02:38.040> banana<00:02:38.489> tree<00:02:38.959> like<00:02:39.959> my

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
have the tar banana tree like my

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:45.289 
have the tar banana tree like my
neighbor<00:02:40.349> did<00:02:41.750> that<00:02:42.750> is<00:02:43.730> way<00:02:44.730> higher<00:02:45.269> than

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
neighbor did that is way higher than

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:50.420 
neighbor did that is way higher than
mine<00:02:47.360> so<00:02:48.360> what<00:02:48.660> you<00:02:48.780> want<00:02:48.959> to<00:02:49.019> do<00:02:49.200> is<00:02:49.410> to<00:02:50.190> lower

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
mine so what you want to do is to lower

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.940 
mine so what you want to do is to lower
the<00:02:50.780> upper<00:02:51.780> portion<00:02:52.530> of<00:02:52.650> it

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
the upper portion of it

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.550 
the upper portion of it
don't<00:02:53.579> touch<00:02:53.790> the<00:02:54.000> bottom<00:02:54.299> yet<00:02:54.480> what<00:02:55.319> you<00:02:55.349> want

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
don't touch the bottom yet what you want

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.080 
don't touch the bottom yet what you want
to<00:02:55.650> do<00:02:55.769> is<00:02:56.390> do<00:02:57.390> the<00:02:57.599> cut<00:02:57.870> same<00:02:58.200> right<00:02:58.410> here

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
to do is do the cut same right here

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:06.979 
to do is do the cut same right here
basically<00:03:00.860> cut<00:03:01.860> a<00:03:01.890> little<00:03:02.250> bit<00:03:02.400> into<00:03:02.970> it<00:03:05.989> so

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
basically cut a little bit into it so

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:11.599 
basically cut a little bit into it so
that<00:03:08.359> banished<00:03:09.359> the<00:03:09.750> upper<00:03:10.620> part<00:03:10.920> will<00:03:11.280> bent

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:11.609 
that banished the upper part will bent

00:03:11.609 --> 00:03:16.940 
that banished the upper part will bent
on<00:03:11.849> it<00:03:12.120> own<00:03:14.390> which<00:03:15.390> will<00:03:15.569> lower<00:03:16.349> the<00:03:16.680> fruit

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
on it own which will lower the fruit

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:23.300 
on it own which will lower the fruit
that<00:03:17.329> way<00:03:20.599> you<00:03:21.599> can<00:03:21.780> cut<00:03:22.500> the<00:03:22.739> fruit<00:03:22.980> while

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
that way you can cut the fruit while

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.720 
that way you can cut the fruit while
with<00:03:23.989> near<00:03:24.989> the<00:03:25.170> ground<00:03:25.440> it's<00:03:25.980> much<00:03:26.190> easier<00:03:26.670> to

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:26.730 
with near the ground it's much easier to

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.370 
with near the ground it's much easier to
handle<00:03:27.629> that<00:03:28.019> way<00:03:29.540> just<00:03:30.540> like<00:03:30.720> chopping<00:03:31.169> tree

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
handle that way just like chopping tree

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:39.259 
handle that way just like chopping tree
you<00:03:31.650> know<00:03:32.750> just<00:03:34.370> cut<00:03:35.370> into<00:03:35.880> it<00:03:37.639> on<00:03:38.639> one<00:03:38.940> side

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
you know just cut into it on one side

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:41.569 
you know just cut into it on one side
and<00:03:39.540> let<00:03:40.290> the<00:03:40.470> weight<00:03:40.680> through<00:03:40.950> a<00:03:40.980> thing<00:03:41.310> or

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
and let the weight through a thing or

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:44.629 
and let the weight through a thing or
gravity's<00:03:42.510> going<00:03:42.780> to<00:03:42.870> say<00:03:43.130> do<00:03:44.130> we<00:03:44.250> don't<00:03:44.370> think

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:44.639 
gravity's going to say do we don't think

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:47.920 
gravity's going to say do we don't think
so

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.839 

since<00:03:48.930> my<00:03:49.169> banana<00:03:49.620> tree<00:03:49.889> is<00:03:50.010> not<00:03:50.160> that<00:03:50.519> tall

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:50.849 
since my banana tree is not that tall

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:52.430 
since my banana tree is not that tall
and<00:03:51.269> it<00:03:51.510> doesn't<00:03:51.810> have<00:03:51.930> enough<00:03:51.959> weight<00:03:52.410> to

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
and it doesn't have enough weight to

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.250 
and it doesn't have enough weight to
break<00:03:52.829> it<00:03:53.040> but<00:03:53.220> usually<00:03:53.459> if<00:03:53.760> you<00:03:53.849> cut<00:03:54.090> it<00:03:54.260> just

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
break it but usually if you cut it just

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.479 
break it but usually if you cut it just
enough<00:03:55.530> like<00:03:55.739> this<00:03:56.510> the<00:03:57.510> weight<00:03:57.980> will<00:03:58.980> pretty

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
enough like this the weight will pretty

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:04.460 
enough like this the weight will pretty
much<00:04:01.370> the<00:04:02.370> way<00:04:02.579> is<00:04:02.819> what<00:04:03.209> I<00:04:03.389> know<00:04:03.599> heavy<00:04:04.169> enough

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
much the way is what I know heavy enough

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.059 
much the way is what I know heavy enough
to<00:04:04.709> bend<00:04:05.310> the<00:04:05.459> tree<00:04:05.639> over<00:04:06.209> and<00:04:06.450> lower<00:04:06.780> it<00:04:07.069> then

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:08.069 
to bend the tree over and lower it then

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:10.430 
to bend the tree over and lower it then
you<00:04:08.340> just<00:04:08.549> guide<00:04:08.760> it<00:04:08.819> down<00:04:09.180> and<00:04:09.419> cut<00:04:09.599> your<00:04:09.870> foot

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
you just guide it down and cut your foot

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:15.289 
you just guide it down and cut your foot
down<00:04:11.269> so<00:04:12.269> there<00:04:12.720> you<00:04:12.810> go<00:04:12.930> so<00:04:13.819> it<00:04:14.819> doesn't<00:04:15.239> need

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:15.299 
down so there you go so it doesn't need

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:18.390 
down so there you go so it doesn't need
to<00:04:15.450> be<00:04:15.560> much

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400 
to be much

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.020 
to be much
and<00:04:19.269> then<00:04:19.630> you<00:04:19.900> can<00:04:20.049> just<00:04:20.229> pull<00:04:20.620> it<00:04:20.910> in<00:04:21.910> the

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
and then you can just pull it in the

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:27.240 
and then you can just pull it in the
bullpen<00:04:25.110> you'll<00:04:26.110> be<00:04:26.260> able<00:04:26.320> to<00:04:26.590> lower<00:04:27.100> the

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:27.250 
bullpen you'll be able to lower the

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:30.840 
bullpen you'll be able to lower the
fruit<00:04:27.850> down<00:04:28.060> and<00:04:28.360> cut<00:04:28.840> it<00:04:28.990> from<00:04:29.110> there<00:04:29.850> from

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850 
fruit down and cut it from there from

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:49.290 
fruit down and cut it from there from
whatever<00:04:31.180> height<00:04:31.600> you<00:04:31.630> choose<00:04:47.610> okay<00:04:48.610> well<00:04:49.030> I

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:49.300 
whatever height you choose okay well I

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:54.200 
whatever height you choose okay well I
just<00:04:49.570> want<00:04:49.720> to<00:04:49.810> cut<00:04:49.990> it<00:04:50.110> up<00:04:50.139> so<00:04:52.020> there<00:04:53.020> you<00:04:53.080> go

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:54.210 
just want to cut it up so there you go

00:04:54.210 --> 00:05:04.790 
just want to cut it up so there you go
okay<00:04:55.240> so<00:04:56.639> let's<00:04:57.639> go<00:04:57.789> back<00:04:57.820> to<00:04:58.030> the<00:04:58.300> bottom<00:04:58.630> here

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:04.800 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.879 

see<00:05:05.800> if<00:05:05.979> I<00:05:06.070> can<00:05:07.080> try<00:05:08.080> to<00:05:08.110> poke<00:05:08.410> through<00:05:08.440> from

00:05:08.879 --> 00:05:08.889 
see if I can try to poke through from

00:05:08.889 --> 00:05:31.280 
see if I can try to poke through from
this<00:05:09.100> angle

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:31.290 

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:37.720 

so<00:05:35.150> go<00:05:36.150> you<00:05:36.450> hear<00:05:36.690> it

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:37.730 
so go you hear it

00:05:37.730 --> 00:06:06.500 
so go you hear it
stop<00:05:38.730> breaking<00:05:40.430> wallah<00:05:41.990> let's<00:05:42.990> go

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:06.510 

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:09.720 

that's<00:06:07.510> it<00:06:07.950> that's<00:06:08.950> how<00:06:09.160> you<00:06:09.220> cut<00:06:09.490> a<00:06:09.520> banana

00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:09.730 
that's it that's how you cut a banana

00:06:09.730 --> 00:06:15.800 
that's it that's how you cut a banana
tree<00:06:10.500> and<00:06:12.750> if<00:06:13.750> you<00:06:13.960> poke<00:06:14.260> through<00:06:14.530> deep<00:06:15.130> enough

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:15.810 
tree and if you poke through deep enough

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:20.730 
tree and if you poke through deep enough
you<00:06:16.810> won't<00:06:16.960> have<00:06:17.200> that<00:06:18.330> any<00:06:19.330> left<00:06:20.230> over<00:06:20.560> you

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:20.740 
you won't have that any left over you

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:22.430 
you won't have that any left over you
don't<00:06:20.890> have<00:06:20.980> any<00:06:21.130> left<00:06:21.340> over<00:06:21.550> from<00:06:21.670> the<00:06:21.850> Chi

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:22.440 
don't have any left over from the Chi

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:28.190 
don't have any left over from the Chi
Chi<00:06:23.440> Chuan<00:06:23.500> the<00:06:24.190> banana<00:06:24.640> joint<00:06:26.430> there<00:06:27.430> you<00:06:27.580> go

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:28.200 
Chi Chuan the banana joint there you go

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:36.900 
Chi Chuan the banana joint there you go
right<00:06:29.200> here<00:06:29.410> is<00:06:34.740> as<00:06:35.740> you<00:06:36.250> can<00:06:36.310> see<00:06:36.400> the<00:06:36.580> bottom

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:36.910 
right here is as you can see the bottom

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:39.870 
right here is as you can see the bottom
doesn't<00:06:37.180> have<00:06:37.270> any<00:06:37.420> fiber<00:06:37.690> just<00:06:38.350> crunchy<00:06:38.980> so

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:39.880 
doesn't have any fiber just crunchy so

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:43.470 
doesn't have any fiber just crunchy so
it<00:06:40.030> break<00:06:40.360> really<00:06:40.750> easy<00:06:40.960> you<00:06:42.180> can<00:06:43.180> see<00:06:43.330> I<00:06:43.360> only

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:43.480 
it break really easy you can see I only

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:48.090 
it break really easy you can see I only
cut<00:06:43.960> like<00:06:44.200> what<00:06:44.440> into<00:06:45.310> like<00:06:45.640> I<00:06:45.970> only<00:06:46.240> cut<00:06:47.100> about

00:06:48.090 --> 00:06:48.100 
cut like what into like I only cut about

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:51.960 
cut like what into like I only cut about
I<00:06:48.550> say<00:06:49.210> 1/3<00:06:49.510> and<00:06:49.780> the<00:06:50.740> rest<00:06:50.980> of<00:06:51.160> it<00:06:51.310> after<00:06:51.880> you

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:51.970 
I say 1/3 and the rest of it after you

00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:56.430 
I say 1/3 and the rest of it after you
push<00:06:52.240> it<00:06:52.450> you<00:06:53.230> just<00:06:54.300> break<00:06:55.300> apart<00:06:55.870> like<00:06:56.200> that

00:06:56.430 --> 00:06:56.440 
push it you just break apart like that

00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:02.400 
push it you just break apart like that
so<00:06:57.990> very<00:06:58.990> simple<00:06:59.320> now<00:07:00.240> just<00:07:01.240> cut<00:07:01.810> into<00:07:02.140> pieces

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:02.410 
so very simple now just cut into pieces

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:04.310 
so very simple now just cut into pieces
so<00:07:02.740> that<00:07:02.770> you<00:07:02.950> can<00:07:03.070> fill<00:07:03.310> it<00:07:03.430> into<00:07:03.580> the

00:07:04.310 --> 00:07:04.320 
so that you can fill it into the

00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:15.570 
so that you can fill it into the
dumpster<00:07:05.320> oh<00:07:12.450> that's<00:07:13.450> it
