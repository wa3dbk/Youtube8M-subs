and this one features a satin nickel

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:28.890 
and this one features a satin nickel
hardware<00:01:23.380> so<00:01:25.180> this<00:01:26.180> is<00:01:26.330> the<00:01:26.450> prototype<00:01:27.670> the

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:28.900 
hardware so this is the prototype the

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.510 
hardware so this is the prototype the
production<00:01:29.900> models<00:01:30.229> will<00:01:30.380> actually<00:01:30.770> have<00:01:31.009> the

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
production models will actually have the

and what about the materials for that

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.530 
and what about the materials for that
tailpiece<00:02:32.340> they<00:02:33.000> actually<00:02:33.329> look<00:02:33.510> like

haven't<00:05:00.560> really<00:05:00.740> reduced<00:05:01.190> the<00:05:01.280> next<00:05:01.610> size<00:05:01.789> by

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:02.060 
haven't really reduced the next size by

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.060 
haven't really reduced the next size by
much<00:05:02.300> you<00:05:03.199> know<00:05:03.320> if<00:05:03.380> this<00:05:03.530> was<00:05:03.680> a<00:05:03.710> slightly

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:04.070 
much you know if this was a slightly

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:05.589 
much you know if this was a slightly
thinner<00:05:04.460> neck<00:05:04.759> I'm<00:05:04.970> sure<00:05:05.180> the<00:05:05.300> guitar

00:05:05.589 --> 00:05:05.599 
thinner neck I'm sure the guitar

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:08.770 
thinner neck I'm sure the guitar
wouldn't<00:05:05.900> sound<00:05:06.160> any<00:05:07.160> different<00:05:07.449> it's<00:05:08.449> really

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:08.780 
wouldn't sound any different it's really

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.520 
wouldn't sound any different it's really
about<00:05:08.960> the<00:05:09.139> texture<00:05:09.530> of<00:05:09.889> the<00:05:10.460> neck<00:05:10.669> and<00:05:11.530> we're

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:12.530 
about the texture of the neck and we're

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:15.530 
about the texture of the neck and we're
not<00:05:12.650> sacrificing<00:05:12.889> any<00:05:13.490> tone<00:05:13.759> here

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:15.540 
not sacrificing any tone here

guitars<00:05:18.990> oh<00:05:19.490> I<00:05:20.490> say<00:05:20.790> so<00:05:20.850> it's<00:05:21.090> an<00:05:21.210> option<00:05:21.600> that

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:21.630 
guitars oh I say so it's an option that

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.140 
guitars oh I say so it's an option that
you<00:05:21.930> can<00:05:22.020> get<00:05:22.230> with<00:05:22.380> every<00:05:22.970> guitar<00:05:23.970> could<00:05:24.090> be

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150 
you can get with every guitar could be

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.480 
you can get with every guitar could be
ordered<00:05:24.510> with<00:05:24.630> a<00:05:24.660> Z<00:05:24.870> glide<00:05:25.110> nut<00:05:25.410> where<00:05:26.250> did<00:05:26.400> you

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:26.490 
ordered with a Z glide nut where did you

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:29.150 
ordered with a Z glide nut where did you
get<00:05:26.610> the<00:05:26.730> idea<00:05:27.060> for<00:05:27.300> this<00:05:27.480> I<00:05:27.920> don't<00:05:28.920> know<00:05:29.040> I've

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:29.160 
get the idea for this I don't know I've

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.460 
get the idea for this I don't know I've
had<00:05:29.310> this<00:05:29.460> idea<00:05:29.640> for<00:05:29.850> a<00:05:30.030> couple<00:05:30.360> years<00:05:30.390> and<00:05:30.990> you

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:31.470 
had this idea for a couple years and you

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:34.280 
had this idea for a couple years and you
know<00:05:31.560> we<00:05:31.620> put<00:05:31.770> the<00:05:31.860> laser<00:05:32.070> in<00:05:32.310> play<00:05:32.720> yet<00:05:33.720> in<00:05:34.110> the

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:34.290 
know we put the laser in play yet in the

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:37.010 
know we put the laser in play yet in the
DBZ<00:05:34.620> factory<00:05:35.490> and<00:05:36.180> it<00:05:36.330> just<00:05:36.480> took<00:05:36.570> us<00:05:36.720> a<00:05:36.840> while

00:05:37.010 --> 00:05:37.020 
DBZ factory and it just took us a while

00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:38.510 
DBZ factory and it just took us a while
you<00:05:37.410> know<00:05:37.530> until<00:05:37.680> we<00:05:37.800> could<00:05:37.950> get<00:05:38.070> start

00:05:38.510 --> 00:05:38.520 
you know until we could get start

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:40.940 
you know until we could get start
playing<00:05:38.790> with<00:05:39.000> this<00:05:39.150> the<00:05:40.140> technology<00:05:40.770> right

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:40.950 
playing with this the technology right

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:43.490 
playing with this the technology right
to<00:05:41.130> do<00:05:41.250> this<00:05:41.430> but<00:05:42.330> I<00:05:42.360> had<00:05:42.930> the<00:05:43.080> idea<00:05:43.170> for<00:05:43.440> a

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:43.500 
to do this but I had the idea for a

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:45.110 
to do this but I had the idea for a
couple<00:05:43.800> years<00:05:44.040> but<00:05:44.250> we've<00:05:44.430> been<00:05:44.610> working<00:05:44.970> on

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:45.120 
couple years but we've been working on

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:48.110 
couple years but we've been working on
it<00:05:45.270> I<00:05:45.480> would<00:05:46.080> say<00:05:46.320> six<00:05:47.160> months<00:05:47.280> and<00:05:47.760> very

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:48.120 
it I would say six months and very

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:50.390 
it I would say six months and very
heavily<00:05:48.420> the<00:05:48.630> last<00:05:48.870> view<00:05:49.140> you<00:05:49.830> look<00:05:50.010> close<00:05:50.220> in

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:50.400 
heavily the last view you look close in

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:51.800 
heavily the last view you look close in
this<00:05:50.520> pattern<00:05:50.820> it<00:05:51.090> really<00:05:51.270> has<00:05:51.360> two<00:05:51.540> things

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:51.810 
this pattern it really has two things

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:53.780 
this pattern it really has two things
going<00:05:51.900> on<00:05:52.230> it<00:05:52.470> has<00:05:52.680> the<00:05:52.860> depressions<00:05:53.490> and<00:05:53.640> then

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:53.790 
going on it has the depressions and then

00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:57.410 
going on it has the depressions and then
there's<00:05:54.000> the<00:05:54.150> lines<00:05:55.790> the<00:05:56.790> lines<00:05:56.820> are<00:05:57.270> really

00:05:57.410 --> 00:05:57.420 
there's the lines the lines are really

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:01.160 
there's the lines the lines are really
for<00:05:57.780> wicking<00:05:58.590> sweat<00:05:59.480> so<00:06:00.480> the<00:06:00.630> depression

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:01.170 
for wicking sweat so the depression

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:04.820 
for wicking sweat so the depression
reduces<00:06:01.680> the<00:06:01.800> surface<00:06:02.010> area<00:06:02.580> and<00:06:03.530> these<00:06:04.530> lines

00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:04.830 
reduces the surface area and these lines

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:06.530 
reduces the surface area and these lines
are<00:06:05.040> kind<00:06:05.190> of<00:06:05.310> like<00:06:05.430> ideal<00:06:05.790> to<00:06:06.180> act<00:06:06.360> like

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:06.540 
are kind of like ideal to act like

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:08.740 
are kind of like ideal to act like

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:08.750 
little squeegees

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:10.810 
little squeegees
you<00:06:09.080> could<00:06:09.230> go<00:06:09.320> in<00:06:09.500> kind<00:06:09.950> of<00:06:10.070> sent<00:06:10.310> same<00:06:10.670> up
