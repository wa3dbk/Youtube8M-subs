and then they all came together to do

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.820 
and then they all came together to do
the<00:03:41.220> final<00:03:41.580> assembly<00:03:42.060> in<00:03:42.390> placement<00:03:43.050> and<00:03:43.739> I

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 
the final assembly in placement and I

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:47.420 
the final assembly in placement and I
think<00:03:44.130> that<00:03:44.489> for<00:03:45.300> me<00:03:45.480> was<00:03:45.810> in<00:03:46.560> a<00:03:46.650> nutshell<00:03:46.890> all

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
think that for me was in a nutshell all

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.650 
think that for me was in a nutshell all
of<00:03:47.670> the<00:03:47.819> waldorf<00:03:48.800> threads<00:03:49.800> coming<00:03:50.069> together

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
of the waldorf threads coming together

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.380 
of the waldorf threads coming together
so<00:03:51.660> they<00:03:51.870> took<00:03:52.319> their<00:03:52.650> their<00:03:53.370> skills<00:03:53.819> and

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
so they took their their skills and

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:59.350 
so they took their their skills and
their<00:03:55.069> imagination<00:03:56.069> and<00:03:56.780> their<00:03:58.340> academic

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 
their imagination and their academic

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.390 
their imagination and their academic
learning<00:04:00.360> and<00:04:00.630> put<00:04:01.560> it<00:04:01.650> together<00:04:01.830> into<00:04:02.370> a

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
learning and put it together into a

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.910 
learning and put it together into a
cooperative<00:04:03.120> planning<00:04:03.959> and<00:04:04.260> production

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
cooperative planning and production

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.490 
cooperative planning and production
process<00:04:05.819> and<00:04:06.090> they<00:04:06.260> made<00:04:07.260> something

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:07.500 
process and they made something
