00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:06.890
 hello girls and guys this I bring you a 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:09.200
 today's recipe for a water 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:12.320
 and it's going to be super simple only 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:15.320
 We are going to occupy 3 to 4 ingredients and 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:18.289
 Here is the list 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.630
 we are going to occupy good I am going to occupy in 

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:23.810
 this time pineapple in a can because to the 

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:27.380
 Natural pineapple is a bit expensive 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:31.400
 right here but this is an alternative 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:34.699
 super good they were also going to occupy this 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:37.580
 aside that it is also already sweet and 

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:41.410
 serves us very well this will occupy 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.410
 good and I'm going to make two cans 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:50.010
 because I'm going to occupy two pineapple cans 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:53.160
 I'm going to occupy two apples to the apple 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.829
 what am I using has I teach you is 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.790
 is the red I do not remember has its 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.970
 name that I do not remember the name 

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:03.600
 Exactly from the apple they see that apple 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:05.700
 fuji something like that then I do not want them 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.330
 say names just two apples this 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:13.050
 it's sweet and the shell is removed 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.759
 and the handisport diced is and 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.789
 on this side the apple sede as 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:20.910
 bold but when it touches you a lot 

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:23.100
 good time a few minutes in the air is 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:26.490
 put need then try 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:29.580
 do it fast and this one I'm going to finish 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:33.360
 to paint this I will occupy obviously 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.740
 the blender water and sugar is the 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.990
 sugar will be according to what 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.360
 you want as you want sweet 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.460
 and well, more or less like two liters 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.640
 of water I will finish chopping the 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.319
 apples I'm going to open the cans and I'm going to 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:50.000
 put them in the blender and you're 

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:50.000
 when he ground back and I teach them 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.260
 what girls and boys already have ready the 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:26.930
 pitcher with water I will occupy 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.930
 transparent the amount of sugar 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.270
 As I told you, it will vary depending on 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:34.430
 amount that you want me more or 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:38.360
 except here I'm putting half a cup 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:41.300
 or less than half a cup because I left the 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:45.020
 Juice from the pineapple of the blender for 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:48.290
 grind here I have water in case it occupied 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:51.769
 perhaps the chopped apple 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:55.159
 I'm going to put the mixture of the 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:03:00.340
 pineapple as you see this is already fine 

00:02:55.159 --> 00:03:00.340
 well ground and we're putting it 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.519
 and as I said here I have water 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.790
 then at stake the water the glass 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:28.200
 and I'm going to have to stop the video with the 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:30.599
 apple with both hands and back 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:34.590
 although I already put the apple as you can 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:37.620
 see here the sugar was very good that 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:39.030
 2k could be said a little sweet if 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:42.330
 you want to be seen more 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:44.819
 strong this has foam by grinding it 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:47.640
 you get that foam but if you want 

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:50.060
 that they are a little more like more 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.680
 dissolved that you see more what is water 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:55.100
 can put more water in a jar more 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.470
 big with this I'm tiny 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:59.000
 then I 'm going to make see in this 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:02.390
 cup 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.580
 as you can see that the apple and that 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:08.650
 you can chop the finite 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:11.270
 and now yes 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:14.410
 turn around 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:17.830
 As you can see I'm left with water 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:19.510
 I hope you like the recipe and we 

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:22.860

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:22.860
