 Hi everyone, here I am with 19 in art and 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:27.669
 this time as in previous it is 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:29.560
 still quite summer nail art 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:31.210
 which makes us still think about the holidays and 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.129
 in the heat 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:36.070
 as you can see the subject is a 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:38.470
 little goldfish in mine 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:42.449
 imagination is positioned in a 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:45.550
 aquarium nail art really is 

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:47.850
 very simple it does not take much to 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:50.290
 carry it out and then let's start right away 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.090
 first of all I laid on all the 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.890
 nails a reinforcing base used 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:56.260
 the debora is the whitening base 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:59.230
 anti pupa yellow are the king inches 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:01.510
 then I took the 845 debora which is 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.129
 this light blue and mirror effect 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.619
 spread evenly on all nails 

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:07.720
 except that they are the king inch and on 

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:09.580
 which I made a france or later took 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.280
 black and white acrylic paint 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:16.660
 orange a brush from the tip 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:19.600
 small and thin and a daughter of two 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:22.149
 measures and I went to create the first 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.700
 orange minnow on ring finger e 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:26.679
 then thumb with the older doctor e 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:30.039
 the blue enamel created the bubbles 

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:32.950
 that come out of the fish with the 

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:35.830
 dott er smaller and black created 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:38.110
 the fish's eye returning to the 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:40.840
 Doctor, I made others 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:43.479
 white bubbles on the other nails and 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:46.750
 with the small one redefined the 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:48.670
 finally blue bubbles as I always have 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.590
 got my essence top coat is it 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.450
 same informally on all nails 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:54.310
 in order to make it brighter and 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.979
 brilliant in the art to protect it 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.989
 enamel and acrylic painting I like 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:00.310
 I always hope there is in art 

00:01:58.989 --> 00:02:02.979
 liked it and that you also did 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:06.539
 smile and we'll see each other very soon 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:06.539
