00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.809
 hello how are you lucky i fuck you 

00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:11.930
 nintendo editor and I'm ready to 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:13.400
 present them this boxing of this 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:16.129
 new release by Nintendo 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.410
 the mini wii that unlike your 

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:22.310
 version and its release only a few months 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:25.220
 in Canada now it comes with a game that 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.019
 it's mario kart wii we all know what 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.699
 is to mark the fun the madness that 

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:31.099
 represents this game and well let's go 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:33.520
 to give a check to the box before 

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:35.320
 open it and see what is its content 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.330
 is basically this is a box 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:42.100
 much smaller in the video 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:45.400
 original that does not bring as many things as 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.680
 its original version 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.960
 as we see the system is in red 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:53.800
 with black which is good as you remember a 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.600
 little someone who by the way 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.100
 how the lid is opened and the 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.829
 discs 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.269
 and I say a very simple box very 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:03.730
 minimalist as has always been 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:05.860
 characterized with intent on the part of 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:09.030
 back has its warnings of 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.030
 security of 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:15.310
 customer service and well 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:17.920
 basically this is here you have been placed 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:22.350
 a sticker in which indicates that it is coming 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.350
 included greater carwin 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:32.510
 The first thing we will find is 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:37.070
 the title mario kart wii that comes 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:39.710
 included also come the manuals 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:43.520
 this is the nintendo console always 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:46.290
 has included the ball we can see this 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.600
 security 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.120
 instructions in order we all know what 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.580
 that it contains in the game as 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.010
 we comment unlike the version 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:02:00.270
 Canadian that we met a few months ago 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:03.859
 and we opened 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.859
 we have what it is 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.789
 to all of streams basically what 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:16.890
 the same as the original wind already 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:16.890
 we know and here we have the console 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:22.840
 how 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.840
 as always well 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:29.770
 found and good here we have what is the 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.480
 console 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.480
 I'm going to close this a little 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:39.629
 Hello 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:43.680
 in a very very small console really 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:45.690
 is the space occupied by the disk and 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:49.980
 buttons that we have 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:52.560
 this is the power to learn we have 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:56.239
 to open it 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.680
 As I was saying the album does not have 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:00.300
 no light in the case of wii the 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.960
 original 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:06.620
 has a sync button for 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:09.430
 the controls 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:14.299
 How much longer does your USB connection have? 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:17.659
 has the eliminator entry the 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:19.540
 video audio input and the one in the bar 

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:22.650
 of sensor 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.340
 and comment that this system does not have 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.469
 compatibility with games 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.819
 gamecube does not have a connection either 

00:03:26.469 --> 00:03:29.349
 internet that I think are two of the 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:31.420
 most important points that we can 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:33.939
 mention the console and good is a 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:36.939
 system designed then let's say that 

00:03:33.939 --> 00:03:39.069
 for the orioles and for the little ones 

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:41.829
 for those who are just starting in 

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:44.170
 the video game and well then an option 

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:45.650
 that offers us nintendo at a price more 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:48.640
 low 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:48.640
 here we have 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:58.420
 ah 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:02.230
 whitmarsh 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:05.280
 very nice red color and it even comes 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.280
 with your protection 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:12.819
 very well that illusion plus there is no 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:17.790
 need to attach the accessory 

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:17.790
 and we will also have here a lot 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:23.430
 yes 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:32.790
 red spot that the same so you have 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:35.790
 there 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:37.440
 the divinity what we said about the bar 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:42.480
 of the sensor 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:44.970
 the same one that has with they are part 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:48.849
 fundamental and essential of the console 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:52.629
 we have also for batteries thanks 

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:54.490
 for control and finally the cable 

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:58.360
 audio Video 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:05:01.979
 that we will be loans in the part 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:01.979
 back of the system 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:12.680
 as you can see is a console that is 

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:16.790
 coming to Mexico with a suggested price 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:19.120
 of 599 pesos wine includes a game 

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:22.690
 I will comment 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:24.490
 Mario Kart Wii for you that best game is not 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:27.130
 there may be to start in the 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:28.900
 videogames mario kart wii title that has 

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:32.990
 had many copies and then basically 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:35.860
 that's all we're going to remove 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:38.710
 what great 

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:41.689

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:44.360
 original to show 

00:05:41.689 --> 00:05:47.110
 the highlight of this console then 

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:49.309
