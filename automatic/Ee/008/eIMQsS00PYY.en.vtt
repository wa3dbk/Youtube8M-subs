00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:17.520
 I welcome you, my name is Kaizen and today we will consider 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.279
 One very interesting class of ships in the game World of Warships. 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.770
 And not from the point of view of historical realities, but specifically from the game 

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:24.770
 parties. 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:27.420
 So let's go! 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.410
 We start with the class destroyers. 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:33.001
 Historically, as the all-knowing Wikipedia says, destroyers 

00:00:33.001 --> 00:00:35.460
 - this is a class of multipurpose combat high-speed maneuverable 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.810
 ships intended to fight underwater 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:41.470
 boats, aircraft and enemy ships, 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.140
 as well as for the protection and defense of ship connections or 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.370
 ship convoys when crossing the sea. 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.610
 Destroyers can also be used for reconnaissance and 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.300
 patrol services, artillery support during the landing 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.719
 and for setting minefields. 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:59.539
 In our game, some of the descriptions are of course implemented, 

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:02.429
 namely, reconnaissance, the possibility of introducing combat 

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:05.110
 action against air targets and most importantly, in 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.110
 what is the power and strength of any destroyer - is 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:09.560
 torpedo armament. 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:13.640
 Let me remind you, suddenly someone does not know, a torpedo is self-propelled 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:14.640
 underwater weapon. 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.729
 Consists of a cylindrical streamlined body with feathers 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.140
 and propellers. 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.450
 The torpedo warhead has a powerful explosive charge. 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.020
 substances, detonator, fuel, engine and controls. 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.930
 Another advantage that all destroyers have 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.340
 In our game, this is an opportunity to put a smoke masking 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.780
 veil in which you can successfully and quickly hide 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.130
 yourself as well as hide allies from the enemy 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:41.130
 shelling. 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.509
 And after all the described features of this class. 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:46.969
 I immediately have a comparison with the popular 

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:49.820
 games in stealth style, which must be unnoticed 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.960
 move, hide, secretly and imperceptibly destroy 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:57.490
 opponents using the quiet and most powerful weapon. 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.460
 And if you browse destroyers by nations, which are currently 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.250
 the moment is only two: Japanese and American, then after 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.980
 interesting associations arise: 

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.670
 Japanese destroyers - the real "ninja" in this 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:09.670
 the game. 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.400
 Have a good stealth ability to apply 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.620
 smoke curtains and having the most powerful and long-range 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.180
 (up to 20 kilometers) torpedo armament. 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.260
 American destroyers are such universal "secret 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.800
 special agents "who also have torpedoes, really not 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.250
 as powerful and long-range as the Japanese. 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.110
 It is also possible to use smoke screens. 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.280
 An important feature of American destroyers is a decent 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.620
 for the destroyer, the main weapon and good anti-aircraft 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:36.620
 defense. 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.019
 It turns out like a universal soldier who can do everything 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:41.019
 and everything can. 

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:45.519
 From the above, we single out the following: if you like 

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:48.220
 stealth action gameplay in which you are very vulnerable 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.000
 and you can die from a couple of hits of the enemy, if 

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.981
 you are careful, able to plan actions, attentive and 

00:02:53.981 --> 00:02:56.730
 You have the skill to make decisions quickly, then this 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.000
 the class was created especially for you 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.980
 So if you like to play stealth action games, 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.930
 I think you will enjoy playing such a class. 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:06.830
 like destroyers. 

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:09.130
 You thought and decided that this class specifically 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.150
 created for you, then I will give you a couple of tips. 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:13.299
 Tip number one. 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:15.809
 The most dangerous, but at the same time the most risky 

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:17.660
 - This is a melee attack. 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.261
 Try not to appear in open water, but use 

00:03:20.261 --> 00:03:23.909
 torpedo shots in the straits and other narrow spaces. 

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:26.470
 Similar tactics, after your torpedo attack, 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:29.370
 forces the enemy to hastily escape from the blow, often 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.500
 while running aground and turning into a light 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.950
 A target for you and your allies. 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.040
 For a successful departure, do not forget to use 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.420
 smoke curtains. 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.709
 Second tip: Also play boldly on medium and long range. 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:44.489
 attack distances, i.e. at the range of the stroke 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:47.870
 torpedoes and your light are important characteristics, 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.170
 which you need to learn from the data in the port. 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:53.590
 This is a very careful tactic that allows you not to be substituted. 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.599
 under the deadly fire of the enemy. 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:58.780
 The accuracy of such a fire is low, but with the acquisition of experience 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.640
 will allow the player to hit the target often while remaining 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.319
 in relative safety. 

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:07.140
 At this my video came to an end. 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.469
 The next time we consider the class of cruisers. 

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:13.090
