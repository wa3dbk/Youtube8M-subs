00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.980
 the idea is to move from a point to 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:05.050
 another as fluidly as possible using 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.240
 the abilities of the human body what 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.550
 involves overcoming obstacles like fences and 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.230
 walls in urban environments and trees or 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.210
 rivers in rural environments as 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:15.070
 important is to heat well all the 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.960
 body and being cautious is not 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.430
 question of doing crazy things mainly 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.020
 the mental barrier 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.120
 is when you block yourself and you 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.430
 you block there the hardest thing is the look 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.380
 and half 50 percent physical 50 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.690
 percent this mental if you're not 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.870
 balanced you can have an injury if 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:33.040
 you have 50 percent physical but 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:35.260
 you do not have the mental capacity yet 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.120
 to do something it can suffer 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.830
 an injury and vice versa if you know that 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.960
 you can do something , you will do it if you do not 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.840
 is to practice it until you can do it 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:46.330
 simply basically it is abel body 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.770
 smart mind as well as we exercise 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.810
 our body we exercise our mind 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.700
 which is very basic does not help me 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.130
 to have a very strong body is to be 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.320
 too skillful if I question mind I'll 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.810
 To be too weak to learn to fall is 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.580
 basic to not hurt yourself that's why it's 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.300
 recommendable to start with the support of 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.979
 A professional 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.690
 you have to have a lot of discipline to 

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:06.790
 get results and someone that we 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:10.000
 teach the new movements that we are 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:12.400
 able to do this is very free and 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.150
 it really strengthens is all of that is very 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:18.190
 good and doing so much exercise you do not 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.830
 it gives me a lot of relaxation makes me feel 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:23.890
 very well more that changed this feel 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:27.850
 inside, not the physical condition 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:30.130
 confidence when walking on the street or if 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:33.700
 you are angry you can take out your anger and 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:37.480
 move simply decision accuracy 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:39.520
 balance or the balance somersaults 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.800
 grip walk on a wall 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.959
 defying gravity jump to several 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.540
 meters in height overcome obstacles like 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:49.300
 fences walls even trees all this 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:51.010
 is part of this new discipline not 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.480
 we need no special equipment 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.910
 we just need good ones 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.340
 tennis in peace today simply with that 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.410
 let's be comfortable and if you can do it 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.239
 it just has to be with someone 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:02.980
 you can do it alone but it's always 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:05.830
 better doing it together gives you more 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:09.340
 You trust him more 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:11.620
 train this if you injure yourself too 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.269
 can lift and if you have changed your 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.489
 body since you're training low 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:17.230
 with which my back has entered more 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:19.480
 and we already have more strength in the arms 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.100
 discipline is so important that 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.080
 pass the physical exercise to 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:25.420
 also influence the attitude towards a 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.489
 everyday problem basically what 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.110
 many times we do is to avoid it 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:30.670
 surround it and just imagine that it does not 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.180
 happens I have a put me at home instead 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:33.370
 from simple 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.129
 surround him and look he put a but like 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.719
 many times we look for it we try 

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:39.430
 look for a different alternative not in 

00:03:37.719 --> 00:03:41.609
 instead of just yes good I do not want anymore 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:44.170
 I give up why not try like that 

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:48.219
 practical a thousand times a movement to 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:50.349
 carry out do not know other than the kind of 

00:03:48.219 --> 00:03:53.549
 skills that we try to exercise 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:53.549
 same in my daily life 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:03.069
 of ant where everyone comes and goes 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:06.189
 I walk some of the others after others and 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:09.480
 I can not fix my way with 

00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:09.480
 an imagination creativity 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:12.420
 and the faces 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:18.090
 there is a very serious problem in many 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:21.480
 countries that is overweight obesity 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:24.210
 and heart disease change 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:25.800
 night we decided to try to work with 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:27.990
 young boys 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:31.139
 we did a lot of studies here for 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:33.060
 find out what the problems were and 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:35.669
 we discovered that all the campaigns and 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:38.759
 efforts have been made for parent mothers and 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:40.710
 children in elementary school and us 

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:43.229
 we decided we are going to work with the 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:45.289
 teenagers because nobody knows how 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:47.940
 reach them then we did studies 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:50.340
 to see how to get there and what are the 

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:52.560
 massages and in that we did that the 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:54.180
 guys of good all the guys cement 

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:56.699
 in football but the girls do not want 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.949
 the social want to be fun not 

00:04:56.699 --> 00:05:01.169
 they want to be by then we wanted 

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:03.750
 promote something where they can 

00:05:01.169 --> 00:05:06.180
 experience different types of 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:08.599
 physical activity to see what can be 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:11.639
 fun they can meet other young people 

00:05:08.599 --> 00:05:14.370
 said kids and kids not because 

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:17.819
 obviously those in this age very 

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:20.490
 important for a little bit to replace the 

00:05:17.819 --> 00:05:22.590
 soda with water intake 

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:25.379
 I wish we can get launch 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:27.090
 to do something older here in this 

00:05:25.379 --> 00:05:29.250
 region 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:32.270
 the guys can continue this from 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:32.270
 have a good experience 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:42.290
 that 's how we are made for that the 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:43.760
 Immobility is what is not normal and 

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:47.270
 this ends up making our body of 

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:49.100
 ag and useful as new as it was thought that 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:51.020
 was made to function in that sense 

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:52.940
 that can be useful or a lot 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:55.460
 self-awareness in the development of 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:58.130
 skills but what we call 

00:05:55.460 --> 00:06:02.510
 mindfulness in awareness mindfulness 

00:05:58.130 --> 00:06:04.490
 I have not based you on that developed your 

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:06.560
 skills with that knowledge of how 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:08.840
 you are managing what is the environment which 

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:10.520
 is the concept that you feel like 

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:14.330
 next your body that feels 

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:16.130
 seizes the athlete in what serves 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:18.650
 the athlete with a draft because no 

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:20.960
 is an athlete going to realize 

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:24.710
 what parts of your training do not 

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:26.600
 it's not say let's comply when 

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:29.120
 it deviates a bit 

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:31.010
 I think you would be here we are going to 

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:33.140
 show our deficiencies can supply 

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:35.360
 this body can be much more 

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:38.770
 developed much more we feel many 

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:38.770
 other senses and
