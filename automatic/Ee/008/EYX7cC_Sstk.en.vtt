and<00:00:38.149> it's<00:00:39.149> not<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.450> time<00:00:39.660> to<00:00:39.840> try<00:00:39.960> to

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
and it's not the time to try to

and it's not the time to try to
obviously<00:00:40.829> you<00:00:41.010> can't<00:00:41.250> see<00:00:41.550> your<00:00:41.790> live<00:00:41.969> rock

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
obviously you can't see your live rock

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.600 
obviously you can't see your live rock
it<00:00:42.840> has<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.230> clear<00:00:43.469> up<00:00:43.620> some<00:00:43.890> before<00:00:44.250> you<00:00:44.280> want

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
it has to clear up some before you want

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.060 
it has to clear up some before you want
to<00:00:44.700> do<00:00:44.820> any<00:00:45.030> what's<00:00:45.300> called<00:00:45.539> aquascaping<00:00:46.289> that

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
to do any what's called aquascaping that

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.950 
to do any what's called aquascaping that
is<00:00:47.309> placing<00:00:47.789> your<00:00:47.910> live<00:00:48.059> rock<00:00:48.420> so<00:00:48.660> it<00:00:48.750> looks

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
is placing your live rock so it looks

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.959 
is placing your live rock so it looks
nice<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:50.660> we've<00:00:51.660> filled<00:00:52.590> up<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.980> oceanic

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
nice and we've filled up the oceanic

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.060 
nice and we've filled up the oceanic
biocube<00:00:54.149> so<00:00:54.809> that<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.110> pumps<00:00:55.469> running<00:00:55.680> it's

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
biocube so that the pumps running it's

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.810 
biocube so that the pumps running it's
not<00:00:56.250> slurping<00:00:56.879> if<00:00:57.530> you<00:00:58.530> come<00:00:59.100> in<00:00:59.280> here<00:00:59.520> you<00:00:59.699> can

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
not slurping if you come in here you can

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.520 
not slurping if you come in here you can
see<00:01:00.059> that<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.359> water<00:01:00.870> is<00:01:01.550> actually<00:01:02.550> flowing

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
see that the water is actually flowing

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.740 
see that the water is actually flowing
into<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.920> area<00:01:05.339> where<00:01:05.670> it<00:01:05.790> goes<00:01:05.939> on<00:01:06.180> top<00:01:06.420> of

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
into the area where it goes on top of

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:14.359 
into the area where it goes on top of
the<00:01:08.900> this<00:01:09.900> plastic<00:01:10.530> part<00:01:12.680> which<00:01:13.680> evenly

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
the this plastic part which evenly

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:15.980 
the this plastic part which evenly
distributes<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.030> water<00:01:15.240> over<00:01:15.600> your<00:01:15.630> bio

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
distributes the water over your bio

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:20.420 
distributes the water over your bio
cubes<00:01:18.259> because<00:01:19.259> we're<00:01:19.409> just<00:01:19.530> starting<00:01:19.890> what<00:01:20.400> I

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
cubes because we're just starting what I

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.590 
cubes because we're just starting what I
suggest<00:01:21.030> is<00:01:21.210> to<00:01:21.600> buy<00:01:21.780> some<00:01:22.229> bulk<00:01:22.619> filter<00:01:23.310> floss

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
suggest is to buy some bulk filter floss

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.420 
suggest is to buy some bulk filter floss
that's<00:01:24.600> what<00:01:24.750> this<00:01:24.869> is<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:25.799> get<00:01:25.950> it<00:01:26.100> at<00:01:26.280> your

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
that's what this is and get it at your

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.910 
that's what this is and get it at your
aquarium<00:01:26.759> store<00:01:27.240> and<00:01:28.009> cut<00:01:29.009> out<00:01:29.040> a<00:01:29.159> piece<00:01:29.280> and

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
aquarium store and cut out a piece and

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.850 
aquarium store and cut out a piece and
change<00:01:31.920> this<00:01:32.159> every<00:01:32.520> second<00:01:32.939> day<00:01:33.200> at<00:01:34.200> least

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
change this every second day at least

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.770 
change this every second day at least
for<00:01:35.310> the<00:01:35.490> first<00:01:35.700> little<00:01:35.970> wall<00:01:36.299> while<00:01:36.600> you're

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780
