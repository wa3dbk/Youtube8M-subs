00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:06.710
 Well was likely that something good this day is also good Naa's a good weather this weather today 

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:13.870
 Oh, it's a fine weather and I'll wait for a minute What kind of a nasty dragon's face 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:19.570
 Or this 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:19.570
 75,000 points us to end the game in the overthrow 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.060
 Straw me 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:00.060
 me 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.060
 delorean 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:10.580
 Yes everyone is Excalibur zombie the strongest player Reimu 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:14.210
 So I want to say that even doing'll go Nuuk town this time 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:18.620
 This map only would normally want to add a tie 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:22.170
 There is a restriction that revive ban , but it further bans Jaganog. 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:26.580
 I will also bind the weapon First of all, the wall selling weapon is ptrs 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:30.680
 I can only use it, and the random box can only catch the first two times 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:35.600
 I think that I would like to do with the following things 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:40.250
 And based on this restraint, save 75,000 points to that dragon 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:43.760
 The goal of this map is to let the game end 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:47.770
 By the way the 4th place knife and the bound should be ok 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.770
 It's tough if you don't have it 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.680
 Well then first let's buy ptrs 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:10.060
 What is the best value for 750 points ? 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:13.870
 By the way, do you sell it 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:24.240
 The town mix of everyone to see from the match 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:27.750
 I will deliver a dream of life I can get one peace of mind life free phone call 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:34.610
 So fanet Well then Kinfuji 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:39.040
 Dream and Painnet Rey Moon and Painet Japannet o 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.040
 Japane tray gnu to Yun 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:45.940
 And I thought it better 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:51.060
 I'm dying of being a fool 

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:51.060
 I 'm going through a terrific tea ceremony 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:03:01.260
 If it doesn't come out with this random box, it will be almost impossible game 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:01.260
 Is it okay ? 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:09.829
 Well, to some extent it seems to be a ptrs but 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.829
 It looks like the point is not good 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.260
 Ammo ammo is delicious 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.380
 It is optimal 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.250
 The mover 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.250
 I cut it because it was stupid 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:31.690
 To care what I'm being reflected around properly to Speaking of this scope of the lens 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:31.690
 Quality is high 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:36.470
 There is no highlight, so it's double speed 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:47.120
 It's still cute It sounds like this when you don't have to double the voice of zombies 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.120
 It is so cute 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:56.329
 You have bought 3000 points so do you buy a bowie knife 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:59.439
 No wait Wait for speed cola if it is better pt rs reload 

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:59.439
 What should I do to you 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:08.750
 me 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:11.590
 I'm going to buy a good speed cola If you're not as expected 310 squats in front of the screen 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.590
 Please 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:31.340
 It is not enrolled until e 3 there is delicious 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:38.730
 It became reload early, but this is saved early early 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.730
 The 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:53.969
 After all I'm anxious without Jaganogu I'm shaking my hand on the keyboard 

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:05.360
 Usodadon Dokodon with a ball off the distance of Ekko 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:10.430
 Above 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:11.840
 Yes still Jaganogu there is no and I once again the importance of Jaganogu is dangerous was a lie 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:17.360
 I understand 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:20.860
 So this time it ends with this is a little short but please understand 

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:20.860
 See you next time
