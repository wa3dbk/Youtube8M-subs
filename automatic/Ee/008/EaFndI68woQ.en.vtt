00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.929
 and they are already here in the xbox what 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.160
 we will have to do is use our 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:16.230
 phone windows phone 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.810
 to download the application that we are going to 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:22.849
 search go to marquez 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.849
 let's look for it as smart 

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:30.480
 and there they will appear 

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:34.380
 xbox smart we download them and once 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.650
 downloaded will be in game 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.090
 we enter at half 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.090
 we wait for him to load 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.969
 and we will start with our mail 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:46.610
 electronic that we are registered in 

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:48.079
 our profile account of xbox and 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.059
 we put now it seems that we have 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:52.339
 connected and we are already inside the 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:54.339
 application with this we can control 

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:57.140
 our xbox from our device 

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:59.860
 mobile for example let's use it as 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.860
 control 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.620
 well here we can see our interface 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:07.710
 and everything the same as in the xbox but mobile 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:10.110
 we enter xbox 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.480
 here this would be our control of 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.780
 assets 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:16.159
 I'm not using in any here I have the 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.240
 I send 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:19.240
 and the cardboard and telephone 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.900
 I want to move something 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:38.140
 this application is very good for when 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:42.810
 we are watching movies for example not 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.810
 I know we are going to see a movie 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.710
 the video 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:56.360
 well here has the buttons byx 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.360
 is pressing it 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.380
 enter to see her 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.420
 is 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:14.710
 it's just for them to see that it's very 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:16.510
 very good the application good and says 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:19.900
 especially for example here they appreciated 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.930
 the pause buttons forward or 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.930
 delay 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.560
 but I always want to put a pause 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.300
 of the pause 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:38.850
 that is, it is very good 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:40.920
 this application really because since 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.080
 we are at a distance away 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.750
 and we are watching a movie 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:49.920
 normally the control is turned off 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:51.870
 I know so many minutes of not crossing 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.060
 and good this application would be fine already 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:56.060
 the mobile is what we complained 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:01.150
 we have all the time 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:01.150
 and good is the same for the year
