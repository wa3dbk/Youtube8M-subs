00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.649 
photo is a test shot and I just got the
this<00:01:26.189> camera<00:01:26.640> which<00:01:26.820> is<00:01:27.000> a<00:01:27.270> nikon<00:01:27.600> d<00:01:28.080> 5<00:01:28.320> 100<00:01:28.950> um

this camera which is a nikon d 5 100 um
so<00:01:30.659> let<00:01:31.170> me<00:01:31.320> try<00:01:31.920> changing<00:01:32.369> the<00:01:32.759> white<00:01:32.909> balance

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:33.530 
so let me try changing the white balance

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.480 
so let me try changing the white balance
by<00:01:34.530> you<00:01:35.400> can<00:01:35.579> do<00:01:35.700> that<00:01:35.909> by<00:01:36.060> clicking<00:01:36.090> w<00:01:36.930> and<00:01:37.490> you

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
by you can do that by clicking w and you

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.060 
by you can do that by clicking w and you
know<00:01:38.579> it<00:01:38.869> changes<00:01:39.869> it<00:01:40.049> slightly<00:01:40.320> so<00:01:40.770> what<00:01:40.979> you

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
know it changes it slightly so what you

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.139 
know it changes it slightly so what you
want<00:01:41.250> to<00:01:41.340> do<00:01:41.460> is<00:01:41.640> when<00:01:42.570> you<00:01:42.689> click<00:01:42.899> w<00:01:43.409> you<00:01:44.149> click

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
want to do is when you click w you click

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.219 
want to do is when you click w you click
on<00:01:45.299> a<00:01:45.740> point<00:01:46.740> that's<00:01:47.009> white<00:01:47.250> and<00:01:47.899> then<00:01:48.899> it<00:01:49.020> will

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
on a point that's white and then it will

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.710 
on a point that's white and then it will
change<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.799> warmth<00:01:50.070> of<00:01:50.220> it<00:01:50.399> now<00:01:51.210> if<00:01:51.329> you<00:01:51.450> click

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.630 
change the warmth of it now if you click
on<00:01:51.750> a<00:01:52.110> point<00:01:52.439> that's<00:01:52.680> not<00:01:52.860> white<00:01:53.130> this<00:01:53.340> is<00:01:53.399> what

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
on a point that's not white this is what

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.219 
on a point that's not white this is what
will<00:01:53.790> happen<00:01:54.149> so<00:01:54.869> you<00:01:54.899> don't<00:01:55.140> want<00:01:55.290> that

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229

your<00:02:38.010> photo<00:02:38.900> um<00:02:40.460> maybe<00:02:41.460> I'll<00:02:43.460> bring<00:02:44.460> up<00:02:44.580> the

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
your photo um maybe I'll bring up the

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:50.150 
your photo um maybe I'll bring up the
shadows<00:02:45.180> and<00:02:45.420> the<00:02:46.310> darks<00:02:48.350> mmm<00:02:49.350> the<00:02:49.680> lights

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
shadows and the darks mmm the lights

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.910 
shadows and the darks mmm the lights
kind<00:02:50.670> of<00:02:50.790> down<00:02:51.030> a<00:02:51.060> bit<00:02:51.360> make<00:02:52.170> it<00:02:52.200> a<00:02:52.470> neutral

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
kind of down a bit make it a neutral

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.860 
kind of down a bit make it a neutral
image<00:02:53.510> um<00:02:54.510> I<00:02:54.990> can<00:02:55.140> also<00:02:55.260> go<00:02:55.470> to<00:02:55.500> hsl<00:02:56.750> change<00:02:57.750> the

00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:57.870 
image um I can also go to hsl change the

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:02.450 
image um I can also go to hsl change the
saturation<00:02:58.080> of<00:02:59.270> the<00:03:00.270> Reds<00:03:00.630> maybe<00:03:01.190> bend<00:03:02.190> down<00:03:02.400> a

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:02.460 
saturation of the Reds maybe bend down a

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:13.240 
saturation of the Reds maybe bend down a
little<00:03:02.580> bit<00:03:02.970> and<00:03:04.430> the<00:03:05.430> orange<00:03:05.820> is<00:03:06.000> also<00:03:09.500> and

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.190 

maybe<00:03:14.250> add<00:03:14.580> a<00:03:14.610> little<00:03:15.150> bit<00:03:15.510> of<00:03:15.570> sharpening<00:03:16.110> I

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
maybe add a little bit of sharpening I

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.830 
maybe add a little bit of sharpening I
don't<00:03:16.350> want<00:03:16.500> to<00:03:16.560> add<00:03:16.680> too<00:03:16.890> much<00:03:17.570> now<00:03:18.570> the<00:03:18.630> image

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
don't want to add too much now the image

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.920 
don't want to add too much now the image
is<00:03:19.080> kind<00:03:19.590> of<00:03:19.830> noisy<00:03:20.340> not<00:03:20.580> really<00:03:21.330> much<00:03:21.480> so<00:03:21.810> I'm

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
is kind of noisy not really much so I'm

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:26.479 
is kind of noisy not really much so I'm
just<00:03:22.140> gonna<00:03:23.510> add<00:03:24.510> some<00:03:25.440> noise<00:03:25.680> reduction<00:03:26.010> and

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
just gonna add some noise reduction and

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:38.180 
just gonna add some noise reduction and
keep<00:03:27.330> the<00:03:27.510> detail<00:03:27.930> up<00:03:35.330> and<00:03:36.470> this<00:03:37.470> is<00:03:37.680> all<00:03:37.980> about

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:38.190 
keep the detail up and this is all about

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.090 
keep the detail up and this is all about
experimenting<00:03:39.180> so<00:03:39.420> you<00:03:39.480> know<00:03:39.840> you<00:03:40.170> can<00:03:40.200> try<00:03:41.040> to

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:41.100 
experimenting so you know you can try to

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.759 
experimenting so you know you can try to
add<00:03:41.370> exposure<00:03:41.850> or<00:03:42.500> try<00:03:43.500> bringing<00:03:43.860> it<00:03:44.010> down<00:03:44.250> and

00:03:45.759 --> 00:03:45.769 
add exposure or try bringing it down and

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:49.449 
add exposure or try bringing it down and
same<00:03:46.769> thing<00:03:46.800> with<00:03:47.190> you<00:03:47.580> know<00:03:47.730> other

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459 
same thing with you know other

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:55.000 
same thing with you know other

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
commodities call scroll ething ease um

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.830

and<00:03:56.010> recovery<00:03:56.760> what<00:03:57.000> recovery<00:03:57.360> does<00:03:57.690> it

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
and recovery what recovery does it

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.220 
and recovery what recovery does it
brings<00:03:58.050> up<00:03:58.290> details<00:03:59.209> that<00:04:00.209> weren't<00:04:00.750> seen

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
brings up details that weren't seen

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.270 
brings up details that weren't seen
really<00:04:01.769> before<00:04:02.450> so<00:04:03.450> recovery<00:04:04.350> I<00:04:04.620> don't<00:04:05.220> know

really before so recovery I don't know
this<00:04:05.459> isn't<00:04:05.760> a<00:04:05.880> good<00:04:06.030> example<00:04:06.540> say<00:04:06.750> you<00:04:06.780> have<00:04:07.170> a

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
this isn't a good example say you have a

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:12.380 
this isn't a good example say you have a
canvas<00:04:09.050> that<00:04:10.050> is<00:04:10.320> white<00:04:10.590> and<00:04:10.940> you<00:04:11.940> have<00:04:12.360> a

canvas that is white and you have a

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.930 
canvas that is white and you have a
sketch<00:04:12.989> on<00:04:13.230> it<00:04:13.410> and<00:04:13.530> the<00:04:13.890> sketch<00:04:14.160> isn't<00:04:14.519> really

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:14.940 
sketch on it and the sketch isn't really

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:16.940 
sketch on it and the sketch isn't really
visible<00:04:15.269> if<00:04:15.510> you<00:04:15.630> bring<00:04:15.840> up<00:04:15.989> the<00:04:16.109> recovery<00:04:16.440> a

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
visible if you bring up the recovery a

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:23.029 
visible if you bring up the recovery a
bit<00:04:17.549> um<00:04:18.859> that<00:04:19.859> will<00:04:20.040> show<00:04:20.250> up<00:04:20.430> more<00:04:20.870> and<00:04:22.039> you

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:23.039 
bit um that will show up more and you

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:24.230 
bit um that will show up more and you
can<00:04:23.160> also<00:04:23.310> play<00:04:23.610> around<00:04:23.789> with<00:04:23.970> brightness

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
again um clarity you know kind of makes

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:10.370 
again um clarity you know kind of makes
things<00:05:06.479> I<00:05:08.150> guess<00:05:09.150> clear<00:05:09.539> this<00:05:09.870> works<00:05:10.110> better

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380 
things I guess clear this works better

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:13.150 
things I guess clear this works better
if<00:05:10.590> you<00:05:10.650> have<00:05:10.830> a<00:05:10.860> portrait<00:05:11.430> um<00:05:11.669> I<00:05:12.570> think

if you have a portrait um I think

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:18.650 
if you have a portrait um I think
there's<00:05:14.160> the<00:05:14.460> gradient<00:05:14.910> tool<00:05:15.110> which<00:05:17.389> know<00:05:18.389> so

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:18.660 
there's the gradient tool which know so

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.600 
there's the gradient tool which know so
I'm<00:05:18.840> going<00:05:19.020> to<00:05:19.080> go<00:05:19.830> from<00:05:20.039> where<00:05:20.220> the<00:05:20.340> light<00:05:20.580> is

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610 
I'm going to go from where the light is

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:23.390 
I'm going to go from where the light is
coming<00:05:21.229> and<00:05:22.229> put<00:05:22.440> the<00:05:22.560> center<00:05:22.919> point<00:05:23.130> where

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:23.400 
coming and put the center point where

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.050 
coming and put the center point where
the<00:05:23.520> flowers<00:05:23.910> are<00:05:24.090> which<00:05:24.960> is<00:05:25.110> right<00:05:25.320> here<00:05:25.349> and

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:26.060 
the flowers are which is right here and

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:30.260 
the flowers are which is right here and
I'm<00:05:27.060> going<00:05:27.270> to<00:05:27.300> put<00:05:27.479> the<00:05:27.630> clarity<00:05:28.080> 20<00:05:29.270> change

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:30.270 
I'm going to put the clarity 20 change
