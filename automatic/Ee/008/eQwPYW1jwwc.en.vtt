00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:06.080
 let's do four crafts for 

00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:09.050
 the first one we need a basic cup 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:12.250
 white and the tip marker 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:15.920
 fine of the color you choose I have put 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:17.869
 the word number one and then for 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.539
 it is nice decorate and have put 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:23.920
 I have put some pink flowers that I have 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:26.380
 also bought artificial 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:29.320
 Actually, I like to travel 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:32.400
 like it a lot, it 's a picture that goes to 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:37.440
 having a map when we are same 

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.440
 which we draw and paint 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:44.390
 you have to take a pencil with a fine tip 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:48.850
 mechanical pencil and if you're good at drawing 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:51.900
 freehand make the relief of the cream 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:54.390
 Chinese you can also 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:57.180
 It can also be to take a picture of a 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.990
 large size map and print it 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:04.320
 then with four spring colors 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:08.700
 chosen in 80 the cyan the orange and a 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:11.220
 purple baix and with a sponge you go 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.130
 taking color and painting it little by little 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.509
 compile 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.509
 you can be mixing colors 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.810
 and leave some areas with more paint 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.920
 than with others so that it gives an aspect of 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.439
 relief 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.840
 if it comes out a little nothing happens 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.580
 because because then it comes from far away and 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.950
 you do not notice 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.910
 and this is the final result 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.910
 Really beautiful 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.280
 it's very easy and sure that you already have 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.229
 seen before 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.030
 are going to be some pictures what 

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:49.460
 we need is to buy paintings from 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.990
 size you want in Chinese I have 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.180
 bought and each one has cost me a 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.860
 euro as they were not the color that I 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.500
 I liked I took the color spray 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:01.030
 white and I have painted them later what 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.030
 we let some areas dry 

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:12.670
 but you have more to look at 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.580
 internet photos that you like chosen 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.920
 grand entrance one of Paris and one that says 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.260
 the vogue and I have put them in white and 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.330
 black later with a cutter I have 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.580
 trimmed having marked previously 

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:27.060
 with a pencil the area where you have to 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.060
 trim 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:37.459
 and when you have it, it's as easy as 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:40.749
 put it in the frame and it would already be 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:40.749
 would your picture be done 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:50.250
 finally and the craft changed more 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.570
 he liked it is a pot as in him as 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:54.030
 in the hand and the previous what 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:56.160
 we need is to buy more dates in the 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:58.220
 Chinese and how I wanted them in color 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.700
 I have also painted them white with spray 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:03.590
 and I've let them dry 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.349
 then picked up some goals with water 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:09.410
 although in the end only use one and 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:11.360
 four or five glazes that I like about 

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:15.680
 spring color 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:17.680
 the balance red the yellow rose and what is 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.530
 submerged in the pot 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:23.490
 and be careful to submerge the straight 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:26.310
 so that the drawing looks good 

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:28.440
 you are adding colors and submerging the 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:31.590
 rest of pots so that everyone has 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:34.800
 a different color after you leave it 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:37.470
 dry an hour or two and it would be ready 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.660
 I have put some little flowers that they buy 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:43.820
 artificial so they do not give much 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.820
 work in maintenance
