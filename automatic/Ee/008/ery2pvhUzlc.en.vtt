00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:53.930 
these are the suction here all the rocks

00:02:53.930 --> 00:03:03.720 
these are the suction here all the rocks
that<00:02:54.050> got<00:02:54.260> turned<00:02:54.560> into<00:02:54.739> Mars<00:02:55.040> drones<00:02:59.470> a

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:10.070 

couple<00:03:04.730> shots<00:03:05.030> here

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:17.809 

start<00:03:11.080> working<00:03:11.409> on<00:03:11.500> ideas<00:03:11.769> for<00:03:12.220> the<00:03:12.280> cover

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:20.610 

might<00:03:18.819> be<00:03:19.000> an<00:03:19.090> example<00:03:19.510> of<00:03:19.750> trying<00:03:20.260> too<00:03:20.590> hard

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
might be an example of trying too hard

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:28.830 
might be an example of trying too hard
or<00:03:21.099> forcing<00:03:21.640> it<00:03:27.209> by<00:03:28.209> the<00:03:28.360> way<00:03:28.480> the<00:03:28.659> books

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
or forcing it by the way the books

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.479 
or forcing it by the way the books
available<00:03:28.989> already<00:03:29.799> it's<00:03:29.980> all<00:03:30.159> done<00:03:32.489> that's

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
available already it's all done that's

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:55.319 
available already it's all done that's
the<00:03:33.760> one<00:03:33.970> that<00:03:34.299> I<00:03:34.420> wound<00:03:34.780> up<00:03:34.930> doing<00:03:54.180> one<00:03:55.180> of<00:03:55.209> the

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:55.329 
the one that I wound up doing one of the

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:56.789 
the one that I wound up doing one of the
hardest<00:03:55.659> things<00:03:55.900> about<00:03:56.019> the<00:03:56.379> end<00:03:56.530> of<00:03:56.680> this

00:03:56.789 --> 00:03:56.799 
hardest things about the end of this

00:03:56.799 --> 00:03:59.759 
hardest things about the end of this
kind<00:03:57.040> of<00:03:57.099> subject<00:03:57.579> matter<00:03:57.819> is<00:03:58.030> the<00:03:58.150> fact<00:03:58.769> so

00:03:59.759 --> 00:03:59.769 
kind of subject matter is the fact so

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:11.839 
kind of subject matter is the fact so
many<00:04:01.049> approaches<00:04:02.049> have<00:04:02.170> already<00:04:02.470> been<00:04:02.620> done

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:11.849 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:16.469 

guys<00:04:12.849> like<00:04:13.150> Rosetta<00:04:13.630> and<00:04:13.810> krinkle<00:04:14.380> and<00:04:15.479> others

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:16.479 
guys like Rosetta and krinkle and others

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:17.729 
guys like Rosetta and krinkle and others
and<00:04:16.810> they<00:04:16.930> pretty<00:04:17.139> much<00:04:17.320> ate<00:04:17.530> up<00:04:17.709> the

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
and they pretty much ate up the

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:23.850 
and they pretty much ate up the
territory<00:04:20.010> just<00:04:21.010> pretty<00:04:21.340> hard<00:04:21.639> to<00:04:22.770> come<00:04:23.770> up

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
territory just pretty hard to come up

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:47.920 
territory just pretty hard to come up
with<00:04:23.919> something<00:04:24.250> completely<00:04:24.520> novel

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:52.219 

hey<00:04:48.930> no<00:04:49.110> talking<00:04:49.590> in<00:04:49.680> the<00:04:49.710> movie<00:04:50.870> it's<00:04:51.870> alright

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:52.229 
hey no talking in the movie it's alright

00:04:52.229 --> 00:05:01.969 
hey no talking in the movie it's alright
the<00:04:52.440> fire<00:04:52.970> went<00:04:55.159> bye-bye<00:04:59.930> mr.<00:05:00.930> Joe<00:05:01.409> no<00:05:01.770> one's

00:05:01.969 --> 00:05:01.979 
the fire went bye-bye mr. Joe no one's

00:05:01.979 --> 00:05:06.040 
the fire went bye-bye mr. Joe no one's
gonna<00:05:02.130> watch<00:05:02.520> this<00:05:02.880> thing<00:05:02.940> anyway<00:05:03.630> who<00:05:03.810> cares

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.050 

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:08.480 

you<00:05:07.050> know<00:05:07.080> this<00:05:07.289> drawing<00:05:07.560> I<00:05:07.800> started<00:05:08.190> doing<00:05:08.400> a

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
you know this drawing I started doing a

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:10.969 
you know this drawing I started doing a
new<00:05:08.639> technique<00:05:09.120> which<00:05:09.419> is<00:05:09.599> basically<00:05:10.050> dude

00:05:10.969 --> 00:05:10.979 
new technique which is basically dude

00:05:10.979 --> 00:05:15.230 
new technique which is basically dude
the<00:05:11.159> drawing<00:05:11.430> upside<00:05:11.909> down<00:05:12.800> so<00:05:13.800> I<00:05:14.159> drew<00:05:15.090> this

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
the drawing upside down so I drew this

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:21.559 
the drawing upside down so I drew this
upside<00:05:15.659> down<00:05:18.199> it's<00:05:19.199> kind<00:05:19.380> of<00:05:19.440> liberating<00:05:20.569> do

00:05:21.559 --> 00:05:21.569 
upside down it's kind of liberating do

00:05:21.569 --> 00:05:26.149 
upside down it's kind of liberating do
this<00:05:21.750> one<00:05:21.930> upside<00:05:22.080> down<00:05:22.440> to<00:05:24.620> you<00:05:25.620> come<00:05:25.830> up<00:05:25.949> with

00:05:26.149 --> 00:05:26.159 
this one upside down to you come up with

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:29.390 
this one upside down to you come up with
some<00:05:27.860> approaches<00:05:28.860> that<00:05:28.949> you<00:05:29.129> wouldn't

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:29.400 
some approaches that you wouldn't

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:43.300 
some approaches that you wouldn't
necessarily<00:05:29.520> do<00:05:30.060> otherwise

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:43.310 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:48.140 

this<00:05:44.310> guy's<00:05:44.610> got<00:05:44.909> character<00:05:46.909> it's<00:05:47.909> a<00:05:48.000> new

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:48.150 
this guy's got character it's a new

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:55.580 
this guy's got character it's a new
technique<00:05:48.569> of<00:05:48.750> mine<00:05:50.659> so<00:05:51.659> anyway<00:05:54.349> you<00:05:55.349> get<00:05:55.530> the

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:55.590 
technique of mine so anyway you get the

00:05:55.590 --> 00:06:01.520 
technique of mine so anyway you get the
idea<00:05:56.250> the<00:05:57.169> whole<00:05:58.169> darn<00:05:58.949> book<00:05:59.659> is<00:06:00.659> full<00:06:01.110> and

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:01.530 
idea the whole darn book is full and

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:07.189 
idea the whole darn book is full and
it's<00:06:04.699> 100<00:06:05.699> pages<00:06:05.879> and<00:06:06.569> I<00:06:06.659> haven't<00:06:06.900> even<00:06:06.960> shown

00:06:07.189 --> 00:06:07.199 
it's 100 pages and I haven't even shown

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:10.089 
it's 100 pages and I haven't even shown
you<00:06:07.259> all<00:06:07.560> of<00:06:07.740> them<00:06:07.860> so<00:06:08.520> that's<00:06:09.419> all<00:06:09.629> for<00:06:09.840> today
