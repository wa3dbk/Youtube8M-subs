00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:04.690
 see the first 

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:07.690
 we are great 

00:00:08.369 --> 00:00:10.689
 Yes of course 

00:00:10.689 --> 00:00:13.689
 do not hesitate 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:18.739
 it's a very good operation at the accounting level 

00:00:18.739 --> 00:00:21.819
 it is a very good operation in so far as it is a dynamic of 

00:00:21.819 --> 00:00:23.720
 wins these keys here 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.419
 who was not 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:29.029
 paris tonight in Toulouse even if we got a positive result in the 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:30.039
 difficulty 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:33.039
 we knew very well that borussia toulouse never easy 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.510
 we could guess what was waiting for us 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:39.640
 with a very compact team 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.640
 if we start from very very fast forward in cons 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:45.560
 I think we did not start the match the best way possible 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:48.170
 since tomic opened the score 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.910
 I think what we did the most difficult in the rugby match and 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.230
 visual after that what I think that 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.630
 on the trophy andros had difficulty winning this match 

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:59.270
 after trading his players not much I think that during his 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:00.090
 mandate 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.290
 of success 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.230
 but I think we were a profit coach too so 

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:07.760
 schiller criticize my players for result tonight I'm also for 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.800
 result of the half-season they did I think that 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.100
 it's really good 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.990
 very very good 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.500
 a year ago 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.110
 3h to ridicule or those who take a vacation but that the second part of 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.570
 championship of the first part of the championship that we made 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:23.610
 also allowed to have a very exciting second round of the championship 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:24.980
 but that 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.980
 good even if it is necessary to greet the spirit during the holidays it is necessary to return 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.950
 very motivated in the month of january because i think all the teams 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.040
 are going to be even more motivated to beat burgundy landed at us 

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.690
 richmond 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.140
 but hey we are well placed to know that last year a mold 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.140
 indeed in this case and I believe that my taste 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.640
 the evening of the last day we were a few points behind 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.640
 leader 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.640
 they are 2nd championship champions in january 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:57.840
 I think bourgoin 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.040
 I was not 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.910
 we will not apologize for taking a lot 

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:03.210
 a lot of progress on our pursuers 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.400
 because it can defeat mans 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.690
 to serve us as many months 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.690
 a most difficult passage in terms of results but 

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:14.169
 I think players are aware of even a little 

00:02:14.169 --> 00:02:16.929
 the first championship game we did 

00:02:16.929 --> 00:02:21.449
 it is certainly necessary to rest and hate oneself and the spirit but come back very motivated 

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.959
 for 

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.959
 try to continue this fight was the beginning of the championship 

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:36.249
 in a year every match after match has its truth I believe that a lot 

00:02:36.249 --> 00:02:39.249
 last year we had come had kept the balloon him 

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:44.339
 we had more balloons than toulouse but hey I think in the 

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:48.009
 configuration 2 of the Toulouse game last night the teams who have more balloon 

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:50.939
 Toulouse but at the exit is not under his feet always the team that has the 

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:52.919
 more ball that wins especially against toulouse 

00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:53.880
 several sources 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.730
 this game philosophy that's how does it leave the ball to 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.460
 the opponent and then leave romance very quickly in account because they have 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:00.509
 players 

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:02.239
 that allow them to do that 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:05.419
 so that's a plan when we do not have 

00:03:05.419 --> 00:03:08.900
 when we were beaten 1 to 0 the I told myself how we really had 

00:03:08.899 --> 00:03:11.679
 a lot of trouble started the match 

00:03:11.679 --> 00:03:13.590
 we equalized the very very quickly 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.039
 what was my opinion 

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:18.319
 this is the hardest thing to do 

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:20.889
 after good I think that good 

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:22.589
 we had success 

00:03:22.589 --> 00:03:25.439
 on the second goal 

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:28.909
 so here I think that at the beautiful match but was was good I think 

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:30.499
 toulouse did a good match 

00:03:30.499 --> 00:03:33.499
 I think that gourmand knew what he was going to offer us and in this 

00:03:33.499 --> 00:03:35.519
 area there they are certainly 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:38.090
 as hard as we can because they are used to playing all 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.090
 matches like that 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:45.919
 Yeah yeah 

00:03:45.919 --> 00:03:47.579
 Yeah, but 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:50.579
 that's not always the case you know it as well as I do 

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:54.089
 when we want when we are coach made choices and it turns out that 

00:03:54.089 --> 00:03:56.749
 the English know but we have the best coach in the world so 

00:03:56.749 --> 00:03:59.749
 like the one against an andy like the most idiot in the world 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:03.679
 we arrived tonight I'm happy for a beautiful 

00:04:03.679 --> 00:04:06.459
 I'm happy especially for the collective because the 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:09.789
 we were aware that it was still a dangerous move 

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:12.659
 as far as good toulouse and clermont nor what is difficult 

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:13.739
 to play 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:16.779
 and especially gained a statistic that I had noted but what 

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:17.329
 Sadly 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:18.829
 after five minutes of play 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:21.299
 it was no longer valid ie I told my players that if 

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:22.159
 toulouse 

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:24.990
 led to the score it was very difficult to win against all 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.319
 what I had seen a statistic that toulouse 

00:04:28.319 --> 00:04:31.129
 the clubhouse open the scoring against toulouse must win the match but 

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:33.689
 that a little day the score you lose the match 

00:04:33.689 --> 00:04:36.689
 it turns out that the man we believe the statistics 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.999
 are made for them 

00:04:40.999 --> 00:04:43.259
 the UN does not resume in high school 

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:46.259
 m 

00:04:47.249 --> 00:04:50.909
 yes but I think the fact dada see and legalized really very very 

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:53.709
 fast on the heels percent being a very nice goal of two dead - including the 

00:04:53.709 --> 00:04:54.759
 benign to lead 

00:04:54.759 --> 00:04:58.419
 I think in the good shots of technical waste in the game but I 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:04:59.900
 believe that against toulouse 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.760
 the woolen teammates put their game it's difficult because toulouse of 

00:05:03.759 --> 00:05:06.180
 reduce space delays 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:07.789
 and 

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:10.259
 so what's the expectations of one thing is that you make a mistake 

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:12.039
 technique to go against 

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:15.740
 and as we did not hurt tonight in summer mickaÃ«l and a difficulty of 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:17.120
 vast team of Toulouse 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.540
 I think in the lot 

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:21.760
 the Bordeaux goalkeeper was for a lot in the result tonight 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.240
 the united states but less than two 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:37.319
 in a year the steps of serenity in the game 

00:05:37.319 --> 00:05:40.319
 if you ask me that question the answer 

00:05:41.809 --> 00:05:44.339
 so you always want the same answer from what you know 

00:05:44.339 --> 00:05:47.110
 so naples player 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:49.699
 here is a medium that has other qualities and qualities 

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:51.719
 footballing maybe 

00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:52.809
 better 

00:05:52.809 --> 00:05:55.219
 but good at the level of the impact 

00:05:55.219 --> 00:05:58.069
 I think we missed a little bit of impact at the heart of the game 

00:05:58.069 --> 00:06:00.960
 because everything moves in this area is very strong 

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:02.800
 so actually 

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.869
 outside 

00:06:04.869 --> 00:06:06.529
 it can be a problem but 

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:10.009
 I think beaumont the my players have given everything but I think that 

00:06:10.009 --> 00:06:13.249
 m with their qualities with their faults drunk that night 

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:16.800
 they gave everything and all that was left of the water we have they have 

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.669
 given they were rewarded 

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:21.669
 congratulations to them 

00:06:32.869 --> 00:06:35.869
 by taking the inner cap 

00:06:41.039 --> 00:06:44.099
 hand struggling just four months after the heavy setback and who knows if 

00:06:44.099 --> 00:06:47.099
 they are taxed 1-4 materic those involved 

00:06:47.099 --> 00:06:48.779
 this saturday the chrono 

00:06:48.779 --> 00:06:52.099
 I do not have to tell you individually who's going 

00:06:52.099 --> 00:06:52.979
 resume 

00:06:52.979 --> 00:06:55.979
 the 4-4 at the price of several products in 2000 to laugh 

00:07:00.969 --> 00:07:01.849
 thank you and happy birthday
