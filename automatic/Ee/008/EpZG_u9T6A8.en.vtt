00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.160 

so<00:01:04.350> after<00:01:04.980> that<00:01:05.339> section<00:01:05.910> bark<00:01:06.390> introduces

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
so after that section bark introduces

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.080 
so after that section bark introduces
his<00:01:07.320> second<00:01:07.680> subject<00:01:07.920> which<00:01:08.460> is<00:01:08.640> full<00:01:09.060> of

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090

so<00:01:14.840> it<00:01:14.960> introduces<00:01:15.649> some<00:01:15.710> momentum<00:01:16.369> to<00:01:16.820> the

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:16.939 
so it introduces some momentum to the

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:19.240 
so it introduces some momentum to the
piece<00:01:17.149> but<00:01:17.780> the<00:01:17.960> third<00:01:18.229> section<00:01:18.590> I<00:01:18.890> think<00:01:19.100> the

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
piece but the third section I think the

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:20.859 
piece but the third section I think the
most<00:01:19.430> remarkable<00:01:19.670> it's<00:01:20.060> very<00:01:20.240> personal<00:01:20.750> and

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:20.869 
most remarkable it's very personal and

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:23.800 
most remarkable it's very personal and
it<00:01:21.350> is<00:01:21.470> based<00:01:21.770> on<00:01:21.950> his<00:01:22.100> name<00:01:22.310> be<00:01:22.610> ACH<00:01:23.329> because

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
it is based on his name be ACH because

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.460 
it is based on his name be ACH because
in<00:01:23.960> German<00:01:24.289> B<00:01:24.829> is<00:01:25.100> B<00:01:25.310> flat<00:01:25.460> and<00:01:25.850> H<00:01:26.450> is<00:01:27.020> B<00:01:27.259> natural

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
in German B is B flat and H is B natural

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:33.560 
in German B is B flat and H is B natural
so<00:01:27.979> his<00:01:28.189> his<00:01:28.579> name<00:01:28.939> sounds<00:01:29.780> like<00:01:29.930> this

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.870 

 spelt<00:01:34.650> on<00:01:34.890> the<00:01:35.130> keyboard<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:35.640> it's<00:01:35.790> the

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
 spelt on the keyboard and it's the

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.240 
 spelt on the keyboard and it's the
first<00:01:36.180> time<00:01:36.540> that<00:01:36.840> he<00:01:37.020> used<00:01:37.650> his<00:01:37.890> name<00:01:38.100> it

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
first time that he used his name it

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.830 
first time that he used his name it
seems<00:01:38.460> too<00:01:38.550> remarkable<00:01:38.790> as<00:01:39.150> you<00:01:39.270> can<00:01:39.420> spell<00:01:39.720> it

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
seems too remarkable as you can spell it

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.430 
seems too remarkable as you can spell it
so<00:01:40.110> easily<00:01:40.910> but<00:01:41.910> one<00:01:42.090> of<00:01:42.120> his<00:01:42.300> sons<00:01:42.480> writes

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:43.440 
so easily but one of his sons writes

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:44.960 
so easily but one of his sons writes
that<00:01:43.710> this<00:01:43.830> is<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.040> first<00:01:44.190> time<00:01:44.460> he<00:01:44.640> used<00:01:44.670> it

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
that this is the first time he used it

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.460 
that this is the first time he used it
as<00:01:45.090> a<00:01:45.120> few<00:01:45.360> subject<00:01:45.840> and<00:01:46.020> it's<00:01:46.140> a<00:01:46.260> very<00:01:46.730> taut

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:48.470 
as a few subject and it's a very taut

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.250 

what<00:02:09.250> happened<00:02:09.729> was<00:02:09.819> that<00:02:09.940> that<00:02:10.119> died<00:02:10.479> before

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
what happened was that that died before

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
he was able to complete this fugue so

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.900 
he was able to complete this fugue so
you<00:02:14.319> have<00:02:14.530> this<00:02:14.739> devastating<00:02:15.489> moment<00:02:15.790> where

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
you have this devastating moment where

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.360 
you have this devastating moment where
the<00:02:16.000> music<00:02:16.030> just<00:02:16.480> cuts<00:02:16.720> off<00:02:16.930> and<00:02:17.230> it's<00:02:18.010> thought

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
the music just cuts off and it's thought

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.030 
the music just cuts off and it's thought
that<00:02:18.790> as<00:02:19.000> a<00:02:19.060> four<00:02:19.870> voice<00:02:20.140> fugue<00:02:20.560> he<00:02:20.830> would<00:02:20.950> have

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
that as a four voice fugue he would have

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.540 
that as a four voice fugue he would have
eventually<00:02:21.250> reintroduced<00:02:22.209> the<00:02:22.540> awesome<00:02:23.550> as

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
eventually reintroduced the awesome as

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:29.280 
eventually reintroduced the awesome as
the<00:02:25.299> final<00:02:25.720> entry<00:02:25.930> to<00:02:26.560> the<00:02:26.709> whole<00:02:26.980> piece

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
the final entry to the whole piece

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.570 
the final entry to the whole piece
but<00:02:30.290> he<00:02:30.380> died<00:02:30.560> before<00:02:30.590> he<00:02:31.010> was<00:02:31.100> able<00:02:31.220> to<00:02:31.430> do

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
but he died before he was able to do

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.690 
but he died before he was able to do
this<00:02:31.760> so<00:02:32.120> instead<00:02:32.720> you<00:02:33.020> have<00:02:33.200> this<00:02:33.700> quite

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
this so instead you have this quite

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.850 
this so instead you have this quite
