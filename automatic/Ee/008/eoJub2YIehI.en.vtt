00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:30.850 
really good at these softer metals how

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:32.310 
really good at these softer metals how
we<00:01:30.909> look<00:01:31.120> better<00:01:31.300> than<00:01:31.540> others<00:01:31.690> you<00:01:32.020> know<00:01:32.140> you

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320

can elude them in there it kind of goes
black<00:01:34.560> okay<00:01:35.560> it<00:01:35.830> works<00:01:36.130> but<00:01:36.430> it's<00:01:37.210> not<00:01:37.390> as<00:01:37.510> nice

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:37.660 
black okay it works but it's not as nice

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.360 
black okay it works but it's not as nice
of<00:01:37.960> course<00:01:38.260> the<00:01:38.500> goldfish<00:01:39.010> Silver's

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:39.370 
of course the goldfish Silver's

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.900 
of course the goldfish Silver's
newcomers<00:01:40.890> of<00:01:41.890> course<00:01:42.130> each<00:01:42.310> of<00:01:42.490> these<00:01:42.550> metals

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:42.910 
newcomers of course each of these metals

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.510 
newcomers of course each of these metals
comes<00:01:43.150> in<00:01:43.270> different<00:01:43.360> forms<00:01:44.220> they<00:01:45.220> come<00:01:45.400> in

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
comes in different forms they come in

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.740 
comes in different forms they come in
wire<00:01:45.870> okay<00:01:46.870> even<00:01:47.800> the<00:01:47.860> gold<00:01:48.160> comes<00:01:48.400> in<00:01:48.550> where

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
wire okay even the gold comes in where

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.010 
wire okay even the gold comes in where
nate<00:01:49.750> silver<00:01:50.080> comes<00:01:50.290> in<00:01:50.440> wire<00:01:50.620> and<00:01:51.810> this<00:01:52.810> is

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
nate silver comes in wire and this is

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.590 
nate silver comes in wire and this is
the<00:01:53.230> copper<00:01:53.650> wire<00:01:53.830> and<00:01:53.860> pounded<00:01:54.820> flat<00:01:55.030> which<00:01:55.420> I

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
the copper wire and pounded flat which I

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.290 
the copper wire and pounded flat which I
think<00:01:55.840> has<00:01:56.140> a<00:01:56.170> nicer<00:01:56.740> look<00:01:57.040> then<00:01:57.940> over<00:01:58.270> on

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.300 
think has a nicer look then over on

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.420 
think has a nicer look then over on
already<00:01:58.600> hot<00:01:58.900> so<00:01:59.140> it<00:01:59.200> really<00:01:59.470> gets<00:01:59.740> down<00:01:59.920> and

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
already hot so it really gets down and

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.150 
already hot so it really gets down and
then<00:02:00.550> it<00:02:00.670> started<00:02:00.760> getting<00:02:01.120> there<00:02:01.390> yeah<00:02:02.160> then

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:03.160 
then it started getting there yeah then

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.480 
then it started getting there yeah then
this<00:02:03.520> in<00:02:03.760> all<00:02:03.910> its<00:02:04.090> oxidizes<00:02:04.810> right<00:02:05.200> so<00:02:05.980> it's

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.490 
this in all its oxidizes right so it's

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:08.639 
this in all its oxidizes right so it's
exposed<00:02:06.940> so<00:02:07.150> I<00:02:07.180> can<00:02:07.360> come<00:02:07.480> back<00:02:07.630> and<00:02:07.900> I<00:02:08.349> think<00:02:08.560> I

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
exposed so I can come back and I think I

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:11.100 
exposed so I can come back and I think I
did<00:02:08.860> it<00:02:08.979> a<00:02:09.190> little<00:02:10.030> now<00:02:10.390> what<00:02:10.569> will<00:02:10.660> happen<00:02:10.899> if

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
did it a little now what will happen if

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:12.360 
did it a little now what will happen if
you're<00:02:11.260> another<00:02:11.470> piece<00:02:11.739> of<00:02:11.890> Clinton<00:02:12.220> on<00:02:12.340> the

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
you're another piece of Clinton on the

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.280 
you're another piece of Clinton on the
back<00:02:12.670> I<00:02:12.910> was<00:02:13.239> rushed<00:02:13.540> with<00:02:13.750> it<00:02:13.930> so<00:02:14.140> it's<00:02:14.170> a

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
back I was rushed with it so it's a

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:15.240 
back I was rushed with it so it's a
little<00:02:14.440> more

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
little more

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.310 
little more
that<00:02:15.430> but<00:02:16.330> you<00:02:16.450> could<00:02:16.600> work<00:02:16.750> out<00:02:16.900> if<00:02:17.080> you<00:02:17.170> try

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
that but you could work out if you try

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.750 
that but you could work out if you try
putting<00:02:17.380> claire<00:02:17.830> over<00:02:17.980> the<00:02:18.070> top<00:02:18.250> of<00:02:18.280> it<00:02:18.490> after

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
putting claire over the top of it after

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.220 
putting claire over the top of it after
you<00:02:18.820> did<00:02:19.050> yes<00:02:20.050> and<00:02:20.290> it's<00:02:20.440> got<00:02:20.830> a<00:02:20.860> big<00:02:21.040> bubble
