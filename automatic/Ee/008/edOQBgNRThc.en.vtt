00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:17.689
 beautiful all of us here we are again 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.320
 video waiting for the super hostile 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:21.570
 we're playing 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.630
 let's start in the series how not to play at 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:29.519
 you don't remember a particular secret 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:35.610
 that today with others and we are playing 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:40.199
 a left for dead is very difficult like 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:43.530
 game and also fun than anyway 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:45.570
 however, we really need to be done 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.519
 ass in this game 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.049
 I wanted to say hello to everyone if in 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:52.500
 this week I could do a few videos 

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:55.940
 but unfortunately among my various problems 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.940
 personal and problems 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.640
 in short with the servers as you see the 

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.379
 surpassed it would have liked to stop it in 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:06.299
 how much we lost the server where 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:07.560
 we recorded anything anyway 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.979
 worrying we have already put it back 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.040
 walking 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.049
 we will make redo 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.490
 we will arrange things that do not 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.719
 they go 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.329
 let's restore the map 

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:19.920
 practically four other things and then 

00:01:18.329 --> 00:01:23.850
 we will resume making the right videos in 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.679
 these days are now on the board ed 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.140
 because he knows the game is a game 

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:31.429
 hard enough I think we will die 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.869
 soon because this is a mission 

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:35.670
 example this we have to recover everyone 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.560
 the bins from the gasoline for that 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.429
 machine from below 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.429
 being careful 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.700
 but all the zombies that will come to us 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:52.700
 take a game that you do the 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:55.670
 four-person multiplayer is a game 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:02:00.830
 which I like is a graphic engine is it 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:04.460
 itself of counter strike is however 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:05.690
 really a nice game I am just because I have 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.490
 wanted to try making a video by myself 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.929

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.560

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:14.569

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.010

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:17.600

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.880
 super obstacle and therefore as I told you 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:25.660
