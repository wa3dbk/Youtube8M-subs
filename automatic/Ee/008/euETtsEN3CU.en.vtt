00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.240 

all<00:00:00.780> right<00:00:00.960> today<00:00:01.319> I'm<00:00:01.469> doing<00:00:01.589> a<00:00:01.740> review<00:00:01.770> on<00:00:02.070> a

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:02.250 
all right today I'm doing a review on a

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:08.120 
all right today I'm doing a review on a
Pentax<00:00:03.740> 10<00:00:04.740> to<00:00:04.920> 17<00:00:05.490> millimeter<00:00:06.299> lens<00:00:06.890> I've<00:00:07.890> got

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
Pentax 10 to 17 millimeter lens I've got

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.280 
Pentax 10 to 17 millimeter lens I've got
this<00:00:08.309> just<00:00:08.790> about<00:00:08.940> this<00:00:09.179> came<00:00:09.929> with<00:00:09.960> not

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
this just about this came with not

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.140 
this just about this came with not
actually<00:00:10.590> my<00:00:10.740> k3<00:00:11.309> I<00:00:11.340> bought<00:00:11.639> it<00:00:11.730> as<00:00:11.790> a<00:00:11.849> kid<00:00:12.120> on

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
actually my k3 I bought it as a kid on

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.160 
actually my k3 I bought it as a kid on
my<00:00:12.650> while<00:00:13.650> going<00:00:13.980> about<00:00:14.160> the<00:00:14.429> camera<00:00:15.170> very

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
my while going about the camera very

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.519 
my while going about the camera very
nice<00:00:16.410> lens<00:00:16.740> the<00:00:17.070> reason<00:00:17.369> I<00:00:18.109> like<00:00:19.109> this<00:00:19.289> is

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
nice lens the reason I like this is

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.980 
nice lens the reason I like this is
because<00:00:19.560> at<00:00:20.130> 10<00:00:20.340> millimeter<00:00:20.760> it's<00:00:21.449> like<00:00:21.960> a

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
because at 10 millimeter it's like a

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.529 
because at 10 millimeter it's like a
fisheye<00:00:22.470> and<00:00:22.740> then<00:00:23.310> you<00:00:23.430> get<00:00:23.550> up<00:00:23.730> more<00:00:24.060> to<00:00:24.330> the

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
fisheye and then you get up more to the

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.170 
fisheye and then you get up more to the
17<00:00:25.260> millimeter<00:00:25.680> and<00:00:26.430> it's<00:00:26.640> more<00:00:26.849> like<00:00:27.060> an

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
17 millimeter and it's more like an

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.089 
17 millimeter and it's more like an
ultra<00:00:27.510> wide<00:00:27.619> you<00:00:28.619> don't<00:00:28.769> have<00:00:28.859> less

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
ultra wide you don't have less

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:29.990 
ultra wide you don't have less

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
Distortion

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.510 
Distortion
no<00:00:30.300> really<00:00:30.840> fisheye<00:00:31.410> effect<00:00:31.439> at<00:00:31.980> 17

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520

millimeters this is f 3.5 at 10

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.479 
millimeters this is f 3.5 at 10
millimeters<00:00:37.920> and<00:00:38.460> when<00:00:38.579> you're<00:00:38.700> at<00:00:40.489> 17

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
millimeters and when you're at 17

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:51.290 
millimeters and when you're at 17
millimeters<00:00:41.940> it's<00:00:42.149> at<00:00:42.829> 4.5<00:00:44.809> here<00:00:45.809> we<00:00:45.899> go<00:00:50.300> there

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
millimeters it's at 4.5 here we go there

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.150 
millimeters it's at 4.5 here we go there
we<00:00:51.390> go<00:00:51.570> so<00:00:51.930> you<00:00:52.140> zoom<00:00:52.350> in<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:52.590> out<00:00:52.680> so<00:00:52.949> there's

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
we go so you zoom in and out so there's

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.760 
we go so you zoom in and out so there's
not<00:00:53.340> much<00:00:53.879> of<00:00:54.390> it<00:00:54.719> coming<00:00:55.050> out<00:00:55.140> there<00:00:55.530> at<00:00:55.649> the

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
not much of it coming out there at the

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.020 
not much of it coming out there at the
end<00:00:55.980> as<00:00:56.070> you<00:00:56.250> can<00:00:56.370> see<00:00:57.079> solid<00:00:58.079> construction<00:00:58.350> a

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.030 
end as you can see solid construction a

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.330 
end as you can see solid construction a
lot<00:01:00.030> of<00:01:00.090> people<00:01:00.329> when<00:01:00.960> they're<00:01:01.109> looking<00:01:02.010> for

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
lot of people when they're looking for

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.840 
lot of people when they're looking for
this<00:01:02.460> ultra<00:01:02.789> wide<00:01:03.799> they'll<00:01:04.799> go<00:01:05.220> between<00:01:05.460> this

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
this ultra wide they'll go between this

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.170 
this ultra wide they'll go between this
and<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.840> Sigma<00:01:07.439> 10<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:08.159> 20<00:01:08.640> I<00:01:08.670> believe<00:01:08.909> it<00:01:09.030> is

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
and the Sigma 10 to 20 I believe it is

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.370 
and the Sigma 10 to 20 I believe it is
the<00:01:10.080> reason<00:01:10.710> why<00:01:10.890> I<00:01:10.920> like<00:01:11.220> this<00:01:11.430> better

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
the reason why I like this better

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.120 
the reason why I like this better
it's<00:01:13.380> because<00:01:13.560> just<00:01:13.799> it's<00:01:14.790> in<00:01:15.420> Pentax<00:01:16.170> make

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
it's because just it's in Pentax make

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.370 
it's because just it's in Pentax make
their<00:01:17.280> lenses<00:01:17.580> a<00:01:17.700> lot<00:01:17.880> smaller<00:01:18.270> so<00:01:18.740> the<00:01:19.740> Sigma

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
their lenses a lot smaller so the Sigma

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:22.730 
their lenses a lot smaller so the Sigma
one

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
one

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.670 
one
it's<00:01:23.430> about<00:01:23.759> inch<00:01:24.689> and<00:01:24.869> a<00:01:24.900> half<00:01:24.930> longer

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
it's about inch and a half longer

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.260 
it's about inch and a half longer
something<00:01:26.430> like<00:01:26.549> that<00:01:26.729> you<00:01:26.850> can<00:01:27.000> look<00:01:27.119> at<00:01:27.210> the

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
something like that you can look at the

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.249 
something like that you can look at the
specifications<00:01:28.110> on<00:01:28.579> BH<00:01:29.689> also<00:01:30.689> it's<00:01:30.840> about<00:01:30.930> 1/2

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
specifications on BH also it's about 1/2

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.190 
specifications on BH also it's about 1/2
pound<00:01:31.530> wider<00:01:31.799> so<00:01:32.070> it's<00:01:32.189> really<00:01:32.369> compact<00:01:33.200> nice

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
pound wider so it's really compact nice

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.600 
pound wider so it's really compact nice
lens<00:01:34.470> it's<00:01:34.860> very<00:01:35.490> sharp<00:01:36.259> it's<00:01:37.259> not<00:01:37.409> tack<00:01:38.310> sharp

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
lens it's very sharp it's not tack sharp

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.399 
lens it's very sharp it's not tack sharp
but<00:01:38.880> I'd<00:01:39.060> probably<00:01:39.360> give<00:01:39.600> it<00:01:39.689> about<00:01:39.780> an<00:01:40.020> 8<00:01:40.229> out

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
but I'd probably give it about an 8 out

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.370 
but I'd probably give it about an 8 out
of<00:01:40.439> 10<00:01:40.880> so<00:01:41.880> it<00:01:42.119> does<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.659> job<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:42.899> it<00:01:43.110> does<00:01:43.229> it

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
of 10 so it does the job and it does it

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:49.760 
of 10 so it does the job and it does it
well<00:01:44.180> solid<00:01:45.180> metal<00:01:45.450> back<00:01:45.960> here<00:01:47.329> you<00:01:48.329> see<00:01:48.770> the

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
well solid metal back here you see the

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.719 
well solid metal back here you see the
only<00:01:50.070> difference<00:01:50.960> between<00:01:51.960> this<00:01:52.860> that<00:01:53.369> I

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
only difference between this that I

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.690 
only difference between this that I
don't<00:01:54.240> like<00:01:54.920> that<00:01:55.920> you<00:01:56.100> might<00:01:56.250> get<00:01:56.460> on<00:01:56.520> the

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
don't like that you might get on the

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.700 
don't like that you might get on the
Sigma<00:01:57.030> that<00:01:57.180> you<00:01:57.270> would<00:01:57.420> what<00:01:57.930> like<00:01:58.140> is<00:01:58.380> this

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
Sigma that you would what like is this

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.550 
Sigma that you would what like is this
one<00:01:58.950> doesn't<00:01:59.189> have<00:01:59.369> filters<00:02:00.149> that<00:02:00.409> since<00:02:01.409> it's

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
one doesn't have filters that since it's

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.620 
one doesn't have filters that since it's
fisheye<00:02:01.950> account<00:02:02.250> those<00:02:02.759> out<00:02:03.030> there<00:02:03.270> so<00:02:03.509> there

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
fisheye account those out there so there

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.719 
fisheye account those out there so there
is<00:02:03.719> no<00:02:03.930> filter<00:02:04.649> thread<00:02:05.040> on<00:02:05.189> there<00:02:05.369> if<00:02:05.490> you<00:02:05.610> like

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
is no filter thread on there if you like

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.180 
is no filter thread on there if you like
to<00:02:05.909> put<00:02:06.110> filters<00:02:07.110> on<00:02:07.590> there

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
to put filters on there

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.000 
to put filters on there
for<00:02:08.880> landscapes<00:02:09.420> and<00:02:09.660> stuff<00:02:09.840> like<00:02:10.020> that<00:02:10.320> so

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.010 
for landscapes and stuff like that so

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:12.770 
for landscapes and stuff like that so
keep<00:02:11.190> that<00:02:11.310> in<00:02:11.370> mind<00:02:11.460> on<00:02:11.730> the<00:02:11.820> Sigma<00:02:12.150> it<00:02:12.390> is

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
keep that in mind on the Sigma it is

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.260 
keep that in mind on the Sigma it is
it's<00:02:13.230> like<00:02:13.440> an<00:02:13.560> 82<00:02:14.010> millimeter<00:02:14.520> filters<00:02:15.060> so

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
it's like an 82 millimeter filters so

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.810 
it's like an 82 millimeter filters so
those<00:02:16.170> are<00:02:16.350> kind<00:02:16.530> of<00:02:17.990> big<00:02:18.990> filters<00:02:19.530> so

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 
those are kind of big filters so

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.700 
those are kind of big filters so

sometimes you have problems fine on or
they're<00:02:22.950> pretty<00:02:23.130> pricey<00:02:23.430> for<00:02:23.820> the<00:02:24.420> 18

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
you could do if you want to use a filter

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.340 
you could do if you want to use a filter
on<00:02:28.830> this<00:02:29.010> so<00:02:29.420> you've<00:02:30.420> got<00:02:30.660> your<00:02:30.840> nice

all you need to get is one of these this

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.600 
all you need to get is one of these this
is<00:02:36.000> a<00:02:36.030> Cokin<00:02:36.630> filter

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.490 
is a Cokin filter
there's<00:02:38.610> no<00:02:38.850> thread<00:02:39.210> so<00:02:39.630> all<00:02:39.990> you<00:02:40.140> have<00:02:40.290> to<00:02:40.410> do

there's no thread so all you have to do
is<00:02:40.680> hold<00:02:40.890> it<00:02:41.070> in<00:02:41.640> front<00:02:42.240> of<00:02:42.330> your<00:02:42.560> lens<00:02:43.560> when

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
is hold it in front of your lens when

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.380 
is hold it in front of your lens when
you're<00:02:43.920> taking<00:02:44.250> your<00:02:44.280> shot<00:02:45.830> now<00:02:47.150> since<00:02:48.150> it<00:02:48.270> is

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
you're taking your shot now since it is

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.440 
you're taking your shot now since it is
fish<00:02:49.320> shot<00:02:49.560> at<00:02:50.070> 10<00:02:50.310> millimeters<00:02:50.790> you'll<00:02:51.300> have

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
fish shot at 10 millimeters you'll have

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.840 
fish shot at 10 millimeters you'll have
to<00:02:51.570> zoom<00:02:51.750> in<00:02:51.900> a<00:02:51.960> little<00:02:52.050> bit<00:02:52.170> so<00:02:52.520> you<00:02:53.520> hold<00:02:53.730> it

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
to zoom in a little bit so you hold it

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.550 
to zoom in a little bit so you hold it
at<00:02:53.910> the<00:02:53.940> corners<00:02:54.390> and<00:02:54.690> about<00:02:55.020> it<00:02:55.170> 12

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
at the corners and about it 12

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.410 
at the corners and about it 12
millimeters<00:02:56.220> so<00:02:56.370> you<00:02:56.460> could<00:02:56.610> get<00:02:57.210> your

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
millimeters so you could get your

millimeters so you could get your
fingers<00:02:57.750> out<00:02:57.900> of<00:02:58.020> the<00:02:58.110> shot<00:02:58.440> a<00:02:58.710> little<00:02:58.920> bit<00:02:59.130> but

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
fingers out of the shot a little bit but

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.700 
fingers out of the shot a little bit but
it's<00:03:00.060> really<00:03:00.150> cool<00:03:00.480> having<00:03:00.690> this<00:03:00.870> fisheye<00:03:01.530> at

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:01.710 
it's really cool having this fisheye at

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.920 
it's really cool having this fisheye at
10<00:03:01.950> millimeters<00:03:02.700> I<00:03:02.850> like<00:03:03.000> the<00:03:03.150> nice<00:03:03.330> distorted

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
10 millimeters I like the nice distorted

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.760 
10 millimeters I like the nice distorted
look<00:03:04.080> you<00:03:04.260> get<00:03:04.530> for<00:03:05.360> buildings<00:03:06.360> and<00:03:06.600> such<00:03:07.170> but

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
look you get for buildings and such but

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.900 
look you get for buildings and such but
really<00:03:08.040> saw<00:03:08.280> it<00:03:08.430> lens<00:03:08.670> it<00:03:09.540> does<00:03:09.750> come<00:03:09.990> with<00:03:10.170> a

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:10.910 
really saw it lens it does come with a

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:13.640 
really saw it lens it does come with a
bag<00:03:11.910> the<00:03:12.390> bags<00:03:12.630> kind<00:03:12.900> of<00:03:12.959> flimsy<00:03:13.170> I'll<00:03:13.470> even

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
bag the bags kind of flimsy I'll even

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:15.560 
bag the bags kind of flimsy I'll even
know<00:03:13.770> why<00:03:13.920> they<00:03:14.070> they<00:03:14.850> put<00:03:15.060> it<00:03:15.180> in<00:03:15.330> there<00:03:15.540> with

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
know why they they put it in there with

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:20.870 
know why they they put it in there with
it<00:03:15.900> but<00:03:16.110> comes<00:03:16.709> with<00:03:16.890> that<00:03:19.040> and<00:03:20.040> last<00:03:20.580> but<00:03:20.730> not

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
it but comes with that and last but not

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.730 
it but comes with that and last but not
least<00:03:21.120> why<00:03:21.300> this<00:03:21.360> is<00:03:21.630> better<00:03:21.870> than<00:03:21.990> a<00:03:22.080> sigma<00:03:22.530> a

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:22.740 
least why this is better than a sigma a

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:27.170 
least why this is better than a sigma a
lot<00:03:23.370> of<00:03:23.430> people<00:03:23.640> forget<00:03:24.120> to<00:03:25.190> forget<00:03:26.190> to<00:03:26.550> when

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
lot of people forget to forget to when

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.210 
lot of people forget to forget to when
they're<00:03:27.300> looking<00:03:27.450> at<00:03:27.720> lenses<00:03:28.140> to<00:03:28.680> look<00:03:28.860> at<00:03:29.010> one

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
they're looking at lenses to look at one

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.920 
they're looking at lenses to look at one
thing<00:03:29.520> especially<00:03:30.180> on<00:03:30.300> these<00:03:30.360> ultra<00:03:30.750> wide

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
thing especially on these ultra wide

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:34.699 
thing especially on these ultra wide
lenses<00:03:31.380> one<00:03:32.040> thing<00:03:32.190> I<00:03:32.310> always<00:03:32.459> look<00:03:32.820> at<00:03:32.970> is<00:03:33.709> the

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
lenses one thing I always look at is the

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:38.479 
lenses one thing I always look at is the
minimum<00:03:35.070> focusing<00:03:35.700> distance<00:03:35.760> so<00:03:36.510> like<00:03:37.489> with

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
minimum focusing distance so like with

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:41.180 
minimum focusing distance so like with
ultra<00:03:38.850> wide<00:03:39.030> you<00:03:39.780> know<00:03:39.989> the<00:03:40.650> farther<00:03:40.950> things

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
ultra wide you know the farther things

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.120 
ultra wide you know the farther things
away<00:03:41.459> that<00:03:42.120> there's<00:03:42.650> smaller<00:03:43.650> they<00:03:43.890> kind<00:03:44.070> of

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
away that there's smaller they kind of

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:45.770 
away that there's smaller they kind of
drop<00:03:44.370> off<00:03:44.610> they<00:03:44.820> get<00:03:44.940> was<00:03:45.090> super<00:03:45.360> small<00:03:45.630> if

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
drop off they get was super small if

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:47.810 
drop off they get was super small if
you're<00:03:45.930> too<00:03:46.470> far<00:03:46.650> away<00:03:46.830> so<00:03:46.890> well<00:03:47.670> there's

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
you're too far away so well there's

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:52.160 
you're too far away so well there's
ultra<00:03:48.150> the<00:03:49.940> minimum<00:03:50.940> focusing<00:03:51.510> distance<00:03:51.570> is

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
ultra the minimum focusing distance is

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.650 
ultra the minimum focusing distance is
about<00:03:52.890> five<00:03:53.280> and<00:03:53.400> a<00:03:53.459> half<00:03:53.520> inches<00:03:54.090> on<00:03:54.300> the

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
about five and a half inches on the

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.530 
about five and a half inches on the
sigma<00:03:55.020> it's<00:03:55.200> almost<00:03:55.530> ten<00:03:55.860> inches<00:03:56.220> so<00:03:56.540> it's

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
sigma it's almost ten inches so it's

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:58.670 
sigma it's almost ten inches so it's
quite<00:03:57.720> a<00:03:57.780> bit<00:03:57.930> of<00:03:57.959> difference<00:03:58.380> there

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
quite a bit of difference there

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.160 
quite a bit of difference there
especially<00:03:59.480> with<00:04:00.480> these<00:04:00.600> when<00:04:00.900> you're<00:04:01.020> doing

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:01.170 
especially with these when you're doing

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.740 
especially with these when you're doing
a<00:04:01.230> landscape<00:04:02.120> you<00:04:03.120> kind<00:04:03.360> of<00:04:03.390> want<00:04:03.570> to<00:04:03.600> get

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
a landscape you kind of want to get

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.830 
a landscape you kind of want to get
something<00:04:04.080> in<00:04:04.290> the<00:04:04.380> foreground<00:04:04.680> to<00:04:05.220> make<00:04:05.370> that

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
something in the foreground to make that

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:09.610 
something in the foreground to make that
nice<00:04:06.650> depth<00:04:07.070> there<00:04:07.580> to<00:04:07.820> your<00:04:07.970> shot<00:04:08.210> so<00:04:08.620> usually

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
nice depth there to your shot so usually

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:10.780 
nice depth there to your shot so usually
when<00:04:09.770> you're<00:04:09.920> when<00:04:10.130> I'm<00:04:10.250> putting<00:04:10.550> something

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790 
when you're when I'm putting something

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:12.130 
when you're when I'm putting something
in<00:04:11.030> the<00:04:11.060> foreground<00:04:11.420> it's<00:04:11.630> usually<00:04:11.750> something

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:12.140 
in the foreground it's usually something

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:16.500 
in the foreground it's usually something
small<00:04:12.620> so<00:04:13.510> if<00:04:14.510> it's<00:04:14.840> small<00:04:15.290> and<00:04:15.710> you<00:04:16.010> have<00:04:16.190> no

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
small so if it's small and you have no

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:21.520 
small so if it's small and you have no
get<00:04:17.510> back<00:04:17.690> further<00:04:18.530> from<00:04:19.780> the<00:04:20.780> what<00:04:21.410> you're

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:21.530

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:25.670 
gonna get even smaller and it won't

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:29.950 
gonna get even smaller and it won't

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
protected I actually dropped this lens

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.130 
protected I actually dropped this lens
and<00:04:49.160> it<00:04:49.280> and<00:04:49.610> it's<00:04:50.000> real<00:04:50.240> so<00:04:50.450> it<00:04:50.630> works<00:04:50.840> fine

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:51.140 
and it and it's real so it works fine

even<00:04:52.040> after<00:04:52.310> dropping<00:04:52.550> in<00:04:52.730> but<00:04:52.910> you<00:04:53.000> can<00:04:53.150> see

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
even after dropping in but you can see

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.660 
even after dropping in but you can see
over<00:04:53.330> there<00:04:53.480> where<00:04:53.720> it<00:04:53.860> on<00:04:54.860> the<00:04:55.010> edge<00:04:55.130> when<00:04:55.460> I

over there where it on the edge when I
fell<00:04:56.030> out<00:04:56.150> of<00:04:56.210> my<00:04:56.330> bag<00:04:57.970> this<00:04:58.970> is<00:05:00.610> about<00:05:01.720> $500

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:06.350 
550 on B&amp;H the Sigma which I was

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:10.450 
550 on B&amp;H the Sigma which I was
referring<00:05:06.710> to<00:05:06.860> is<00:05:08.080> close<00:05:09.080> to<00:05:09.290> five<00:05:09.530> four<00:05:09.980> four

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:15.650 
fifty five and there the Sigma also this

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:19.840 
fifty five and there the Sigma also this
is<00:05:15.830> three<00:05:16.070> point<00:05:16.340> five<00:05:16.580> this<00:05:17.060> Sigma<00:05:17.540> is<00:05:18.490> f/4<00:05:19.490> at

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:22.970 
ten millimeters not that big a

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:27.700 
ten millimeters not that big a
difference<00:05:23.150> but<00:05:25.960> that<00:05:26.960> matters<00:05:27.320> that<00:05:27.470> much<00:05:27.680> to

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:27.710 
difference but that matters that much to

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:30.880 
difference but that matters that much to
you<00:05:28.040> Sigma<00:05:29.030> also<00:05:29.210> has<00:05:29.540> a<00:05:29.870> one<00:05:30.320> that's<00:05:30.530> three

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:30.890 
you Sigma also has a one that's three

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:33.600 
you Sigma also has a one that's three
point<00:05:31.220> five<00:05:31.640> throughout<00:05:32.240> the<00:05:32.419> focal<00:05:32.810> range

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:33.610 
point five throughout the focal range

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.310 
point five throughout the focal range
and<00:05:34.610> it's<00:05:35.210> very<00:05:35.450> similar<00:05:35.720> to<00:05:35.840> the<00:05:36.020> other<00:05:36.169> one

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:36.320 
and it's very similar to the other one

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:37.570 
and it's very similar to the other one
it's<00:05:36.470> just<00:05:36.620> three<00:05:36.800> point<00:05:37.010> five<00:05:37.190> throughout

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:37.580 
it's just three point five throughout

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:40.420 
it's just three point five throughout
the<00:05:37.700> focal<00:05:38.030> range<00:05:38.150> that<00:05:38.990> one's<00:05:39.200> about<00:05:39.320> 650<00:05:40.130> so

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:40.430 
the focal range that one's about 650 so

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:42.940 
the focal range that one's about 650 so
you'd<00:05:40.880> go<00:05:41.000> on<00:05:41.120> B&amp;H<00:05:41.600> and<00:05:41.780> compare<00:05:42.140> but<00:05:42.350> I<00:05:42.380> would

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:42.950 
you'd go on B&amp;H and compare but I would

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:45.490 
you'd go on B&amp;H and compare but I would
recommend<00:05:43.100> this<00:05:43.520> over<00:05:43.880> the<00:05:44.660> other<00:05:44.960> Sigma

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:45.500 
recommend this over the other Sigma

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:47.800 
recommend this over the other Sigma

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:08.310 
f8 ISO 100 shot on the k3 and this is

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:10.760 
f8 ISO 100 shot on the k3 and this is
the<00:06:08.640> fisheye<00:06:09.360> all<00:06:09.600> the<00:06:09.720> way<00:06:09.840> at<00:06:09.990> 10<00:06:10.230> so<00:06:10.560> you<00:06:10.620> can

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:10.770 
the fisheye all the way at 10 so you can

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:16.880 
the fisheye all the way at 10 so you can
see<00:06:10.890> the<00:06:10.980> difference<00:06:11.280> here<00:06:14.360> 1710<00:06:15.620> so<00:06:16.620> you<00:06:16.710> get

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:16.890 
see the difference here 1710 so you get

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:19.280 
see the difference here 1710 so you get
that<00:06:17.070> nice<00:06:17.390> rounded<00:06:18.390> edge<00:06:18.540> there<00:06:18.960> on<00:06:19.170> the
