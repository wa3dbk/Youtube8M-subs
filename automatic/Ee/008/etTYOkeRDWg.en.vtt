of a brown and gold ish what can I tell
you<00:00:15.900> about<00:00:16.080> this<00:00:16.320> that<00:00:16.710> you<00:00:16.830> can't<00:00:16.859> see<00:00:17.430> for

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
you about this that you can't see for

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:22.550 
you about this that you can't see for
yourself<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.740> pad<00:00:19.740> is<00:00:20.130> not<00:00:20.640> a<00:00:20.820> d-pad<00:00:21.390> it's<00:00:22.380> a

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
yourself the pad is not a d-pad it's a

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.689 
yourself the pad is not a d-pad it's a
disk<00:00:23.150> it<00:00:24.150> goes<00:00:24.390> round<00:00:24.779> I<00:00:25.289> don't<00:00:25.769> know<00:00:26.070> but

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
disk it goes round I don't know but

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.460 
disk it goes round I don't know but
don't<00:00:26.880> think<00:00:27.300> the<00:00:27.599> actual<00:00:27.930> going<00:00:28.170> round

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
don't think the actual going round

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.160 
don't think the actual going round
serves<00:00:28.920> a<00:00:29.130> function<00:00:29.160> on<00:00:29.820> say<00:00:30.240> driving<00:00:30.779> games<00:00:30.960> I

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
serves a function on say driving games I

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.160 
serves a function on say driving games I
could<00:00:31.380> be<00:00:31.560> wrong<00:00:31.800> actually<00:00:32.579> I've<00:00:32.820> never<00:00:33.170> I've

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
could be wrong actually I've never I've

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.400 
could be wrong actually I've never I've
never<00:00:34.230> tried<00:00:34.590> that<00:00:34.829> um<00:00:36.020> but<00:00:37.020> whereas<00:00:37.380> a

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
never tried that um but whereas a

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.160 
never tried that um but whereas a
typical<00:00:37.950> d-pad<00:00:38.610> or<00:00:38.820> joystick<00:00:39.090> or<00:00:39.540> whatever<00:00:39.840> is

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
typical d-pad or joystick or whatever is

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.430 
typical d-pad or joystick or whatever is
eight<00:00:40.500> way<00:00:41.510> you're<00:00:42.510> up<00:00:42.629> down<00:00:42.809> left<00:00:42.840> right<00:00:43.140> and

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
eight way you're up down left right and

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.790 
eight way you're up down left right and
diagonals<00:00:43.890> this<00:00:44.129> is<00:00:44.370> I<00:00:44.730> think<00:00:45.090> it's<00:00:45.270> 16<00:00:46.020> way<00:00:46.410> it

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
diagonals this is I think it's 16 way it

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.990 
diagonals this is I think it's 16 way it
offers<00:00:47.340> more<00:00:47.579> precision<00:00:48.350> apparently<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:50.000> you

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
offers more precision apparently and you

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.119 
offers more precision apparently and you
have<00:00:51.210> your<00:00:51.449> keypad<00:00:51.870> here<00:00:52.260> which<00:00:52.530> you<00:00:52.739> can<00:00:52.949> put

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
have your keypad here which you can put

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.389 
have your keypad here which you can put
overlays<00:00:53.699> on<00:00:54.030> I<00:00:54.410> don't<00:00:55.410> have<00:00:55.620> any<00:00:55.770> overlays<00:00:56.250> to

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
overlays on I don't have any overlays to

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.470 
overlays on I don't have any overlays to
put<00:00:56.579> on<00:00:56.699> it<00:00:56.730> but<00:00:57.120> um<00:00:57.739> yeah<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:59.070> you<00:01:00.059> also<00:01:00.090> have

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
actually be all right except you've got

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.530 
actually be all right except you've got
this<00:01:40.290> raised<00:01:40.650> ring<00:01:41.340> around<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:42.030> outside<00:01:42.509> of

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
this raised ring around the outside of

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.149 
this raised ring around the outside of
it<00:01:43.490> so<00:01:44.490> that<00:01:44.810> it's<00:01:45.810> actually<00:01:46.530> in<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:46.979> way

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
it so that it's actually in the way

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.219 
it so that it's actually in the way
you've<00:01:47.759> got<00:01:47.790> to<00:01:48.030> hold<00:01:48.180> your<00:01:48.360> thumb<00:01:48.689> in<00:01:48.960> such

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
you've got to hold your thumb in such

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.219 
you've got to hold your thumb in such
wise<00:01:49.380> it's<00:01:49.649> coming<00:01:49.979> in<00:01:50.780> vertically<00:01:51.780> you<00:01:51.990> can't

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
wise it's coming in vertically you can't

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.690 
wise it's coming in vertically you can't
really<00:01:52.350> put<00:01:52.590> your<00:01:52.710> thumb<00:01:52.920> across<00:01:53.220> it<00:01:53.520> because

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
really put your thumb across it because

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.190 
really put your thumb across it because
this<00:01:53.850> stupid<00:01:54.030> piece<00:01:54.329> of<00:01:54.390> plastic<00:01:54.810> gets<00:01:54.960> in<00:01:55.140> the

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
this stupid piece of plastic gets in the

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.410 
this stupid piece of plastic gets in the
way<00:01:55.290> I<00:01:55.470> don't<00:01:56.040> like<00:01:56.250> it<00:01:56.490> there<00:01:56.850> are<00:01:57.180> probably

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
way I don't like it there are probably

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.200 
way I don't like it there are probably
people<00:01:57.960> who<00:01:58.439> swear<00:01:59.070> by<00:01:59.310> them<00:01:59.790> and<00:01:59.909> love<00:02:00.180> them

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
people who swear by them and love them

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.569 
people who swear by them and love them
and<00:02:00.540> think<00:02:00.780> they're<00:02:00.930> great<00:02:01.140> they<00:02:01.860> really<00:02:02.159> were

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
and think they're great they really were

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.209 
and think they're great they really were
back<00:02:03.420> in<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.780> day<00:02:03.990> they<00:02:04.409> were<00:02:04.590> described<00:02:05.040> as

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
back in the day they were described as

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.069 
back in the day they were described as
the<00:02:05.520> way<00:02:05.670> forward<00:02:05.700> you<00:02:06.390> know<00:02:06.420> they<00:02:06.689> were<00:02:06.750> the

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
the way forward you know they were the

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.410 
the way forward you know they were the
future<00:02:07.350> this<00:02:07.710> is<00:02:07.979> so<00:02:08.429> much<00:02:08.640> more<00:02:08.670> advanced<00:02:09.330> and

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
future this is so much more advanced and

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.449
