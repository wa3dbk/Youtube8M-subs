welcome<00:00:10.139> to<00:00:10.290> another<00:00:10.469> review<00:00:10.710> and<00:00:11.099> this<00:00:11.160> time

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
welcome to another review and this time

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.060 
welcome to another review and this time
we<00:00:11.550> look<00:00:11.639> at<00:00:11.759> my<00:00:11.969> pals<00:00:12.269> oxides

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:13.070 
we look at my pals oxides

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:15.829 
we look at my pals oxides
bridge-and-tunnel<00:00:14.070> mod<00:00:14.700> now<00:00:15.330> this<00:00:15.599> thing

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
bridge-and-tunnel mod now this thing

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.429 
bridge-and-tunnel mod now this thing
falls<00:00:16.139> into<00:00:16.350> the<00:00:16.529> category<00:00:16.560> of<00:00:17.270> extreme

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:18.439 
falls into the category of extreme

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:21.769 
falls into the category of extreme
here's<00:00:19.439> a<00:00:19.529> normal<00:00:19.970> maximum<00:00:20.970> height<00:00:21.330> bridge

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
here's a normal maximum height bridge

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.650 
here's a normal maximum height bridge
okay<00:00:22.500> let's<00:00:22.890> take<00:00:23.160> a<00:00:23.220> look<00:00:23.519> at<00:00:23.670> as<00:00:23.970> oxide

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
okay let's take a look at as oxide

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:30.849 
okay let's take a look at as oxide
bridge<00:00:27.410> so<00:00:28.410> we<00:00:28.800> go<00:00:29.039> up<00:00:29.340> to<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.880> maximum<00:00:30.269> and

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:30.859 
bridge so we go up to the maximum and

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:39.740 
bridge so we go up to the maximum and
then<00:00:31.859> we<00:00:32.700> just<00:00:33.120> keep<00:00:33.600> going<00:00:37.370> to<00:00:38.370> double<00:00:39.360> the

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
then we just keep going to double the

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.560 
then we just keep going to double the
height<00:00:39.960> of<00:00:40.579> a<00:00:41.579> normal<00:00:42.030> bridge

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
height of a normal bridge

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.020 
height of a normal bridge
okay<00:00:43.320> now<00:00:43.710> tunnels<00:00:44.219> are<00:00:44.370> exactly<00:00:44.789> the<00:00:44.969> same

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
okay now tunnels are exactly the same

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:53.119 
okay now tunnels are exactly the same
and<00:00:45.930> let<00:00:46.770> me<00:00:46.920> pop<00:00:47.190> in<00:00:51.140> okay<00:00:52.140> there's<00:00:52.469> a<00:00:52.559> normal

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
and let me pop in okay there's a normal

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.229 
and let me pop in okay there's a normal
maximum<00:00:53.520> depth<00:00:53.969> tunnel<00:00:54.800> and<00:00:55.800> now<00:00:55.829> let's<00:00:56.610> do<00:00:56.879> as

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
maximum depth tunnel and now let's do as

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:06.490 
maximum depth tunnel and now let's do as
oxide<00:00:57.930> tunnel<00:01:00.920> and<00:01:01.920> it<00:01:02.070> just<00:01:02.399> keeps<00:01:02.820> on<00:01:03.320> going

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.760 

this<00:01:07.500> IV<00:01:07.950> just<00:01:08.479> compare<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:10.110> depths<00:01:10.530> of<00:01:10.619> those

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
this IV just compare the depths of those

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.870 
this IV just compare the depths of those
things<00:01:12.619> now<00:01:13.619> there<00:01:13.799> are<00:01:13.890> two<00:01:14.100> versions<00:01:14.700> of

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
things now there are two versions of

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.170 
things now there are two versions of
this<00:01:15.060> mod<00:01:15.799> one<00:01:16.799> is<00:01:16.950> kind<00:01:17.220> of<00:01:17.280> conservative<00:01:17.670> and

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
this mod one is kind of conservative and

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.960 
this mod one is kind of conservative and
the<00:01:18.479> other<00:01:18.630> one<00:01:18.840> is<00:01:19.080> kind<00:01:19.320> of<00:01:19.380> extreme<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:20.460> the

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
the other one is kind of extreme the the

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.950 
the other one is kind of extreme the the
1.0<00:01:21.600> one<00:01:21.930> version<00:01:22.580> kind<00:01:23.580> of<00:01:23.729> limits<00:01:24.240> how<00:01:24.720> much

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
1.0 one version kind of limits how much

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.990 
1.0 one version kind of limits how much
he's<00:01:25.140> tweaked<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.770> value<00:01:26.130> so<00:01:26.430> you<00:01:26.490> can't<00:01:26.820> go

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
he's tweaked the value so you can't go

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.789 
he's tweaked the value so you can't go
quite<00:01:27.330> as<00:01:27.479> high<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:27.869> you<00:01:27.930> can't<00:01:28.140> go<00:01:28.259> quite<00:01:28.590> as

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
quite as high and you can't go quite as

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.450 
quite as high and you can't go quite as
low<00:01:29.479> but<00:01:30.479> it's<00:01:30.630> kind<00:01:30.869> of<00:01:30.960> more<00:01:31.140> controlled<00:01:31.650> the

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
low but it's kind of more controlled the

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.660 
low but it's kind of more controlled the
the<00:01:33.060> extreme<00:01:33.659> version<00:01:33.960> as<00:01:34.439> you<00:01:34.799> can<00:01:35.009> see<00:01:35.430> is

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
the extreme version as you can see is

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.810 
the extreme version as you can see is
pretty<00:01:36.240> darned<00:01:36.750> extreme<00:01:37.229> now<00:01:37.829> you<00:01:37.890> can<00:01:38.490> do

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
pretty darned extreme now you can do

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.440 
pretty darned extreme now you can do
some<00:01:39.450> pretty<00:01:39.479> staggering<00:01:40.140> stuff<00:01:40.650> with<00:01:40.860> this

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
some pretty staggering stuff with this

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.270 
some pretty staggering stuff with this
because<00:01:42.450> not<00:01:42.810> only<00:01:42.840> does<00:01:43.680> it<00:01:43.740> increase<00:01:44.159> the

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
because not only does it increase the

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.490 
because not only does it increase the
the<00:01:44.520> heights<00:01:45.000> you<00:01:45.180> can<00:01:45.360> go<00:01:45.509> to<00:01:45.570> and<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.140> depths

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
the heights you can go to and the depths

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.399 
the heights you can go to and the depths
that<00:01:46.560> you<00:01:46.799> can<00:01:46.979> go<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:47.189> but<00:01:48.030> for<00:01:48.810> example<00:01:48.899> when

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
that you can go to but for example when

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.190 
that you can go to but for example when
you're<00:01:49.560> doing<00:01:49.799> trenches<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:51.180> mod<00:01:51.450> allows<00:01:51.869> you

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
you're doing trenches the mod allows you

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.850 
you're doing trenches the mod allows you
to<00:01:52.380> go<00:01:52.590> deeper<00:01:53.220> before<00:01:53.460> a<00:01:53.729> tunnel<00:01:54.270> is<00:01:54.390> formed

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
to go deeper before a tunnel is formed

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.280 
to go deeper before a tunnel is formed
so<00:01:55.860> normally<00:01:56.579> you<00:01:56.759> get<00:01:56.909> a<00:01:56.969> tunnel<00:01:57.420> and<00:01:57.780> like<00:01:58.020> at

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
so normally you get a tunnel and like at

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.670 
so normally you get a tunnel and like at
that<00:01:58.740> level<00:01:59.159> but<00:02:00.090> you<00:02:00.570> can<00:02:00.780> go<00:02:00.960> down<00:02:01.380> and

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
that level but you can go down and

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.149 
that level but you can go down and
create<00:02:02.070> some<00:02:03.000> pretty<00:02:03.479> nice<00:02:03.960> deep<00:02:04.500> trenches

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
create some pretty nice deep trenches

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.429 
create some pretty nice deep trenches
and<00:02:05.430> the<00:02:06.270> same<00:02:06.479> goes<00:02:06.689> when<00:02:06.960> you're<00:02:07.079> raising

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
and the same goes when you're raising

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.479 
and the same goes when you're raising
terrain<00:02:08.539> just<00:02:09.539> take<00:02:10.050> a<00:02:10.259> look<00:02:10.560> at<00:02:10.860> the<00:02:11.160> walls

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
terrain just take a look at the walls

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.880 
terrain just take a look at the walls
and<00:02:12.000> trenches<00:02:12.660> that<00:02:12.900> you<00:02:13.050> can<00:02:13.260> build

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
and trenches that you can build

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.369 
and trenches that you can build
now<00:02:14.849> this<00:02:15.180> is<00:02:15.330> not<00:02:15.480> doing<00:02:15.659> anything<00:02:15.959> clever

00:02:16.369 --> 00:02:16.379 
now this is not doing anything clever

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:19.250 
now this is not doing anything clever
this<00:02:16.650> is<00:02:16.709> just<00:02:17.129> standard<00:02:17.879> you<00:02:18.420> know<00:02:18.540> raised

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
this is just standard you know raised

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.399 
this is just standard you know raised
low<00:02:19.530> at<00:02:19.680> all<00:02:19.860> with<00:02:20.549> this<00:02:20.819> mod<00:02:21.090> it's<00:02:22.049> it's

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:22.409 
low at all with this mod it's it's

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:25.640 
low at all with this mod it's it's
pretty<00:02:23.099> darn<00:02:24.030> staggering<00:02:24.840> what<00:02:25.110> you<00:02:25.260> can<00:02:25.440> come

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
pretty darn staggering what you can come

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.640 
pretty darn staggering what you can come
up<00:02:25.769> with<00:02:26.000> now<00:02:27.000> let's<00:02:27.750> go<00:02:27.959> and<00:02:28.110> have<00:02:28.260> a<00:02:28.319> look

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
up with now let's go and have a look

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.309 
up with now let's go and have a look
down<00:02:29.310> at<00:02:29.489> the<00:02:29.580> other<00:02:29.700> end<00:02:29.940> because<00:02:30.569> one<00:02:31.019> of<00:02:31.170> the

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:31.319 
down at the other end because one of the

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:34.670 
down at the other end because one of the
side<00:02:31.799> effects<00:02:32.190> is<00:02:32.750> because<00:02:33.750> these<00:02:33.930> walls<00:02:34.290> are

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
side effects is because these walls are

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.449 
side effects is because these walls are
kind<00:02:35.280> of<00:02:35.370> so<00:02:35.579> high<00:02:35.900> you<00:02:36.900> can<00:02:37.110> actually<00:02:37.459> draw

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
kind of so high you can actually draw

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:46.819 
kind of so high you can actually draw
bridges<00:02:39.560> through<00:02:40.560> them<00:02:42.769> yeah<00:02:44.629> that<00:02:45.629> it<00:02:46.560> gets

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:46.829 
bridges through them yeah that it gets

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:48.289 
bridges through them yeah that it gets
confused<00:02:47.310> and<00:02:47.459> it<00:02:47.579> allows<00:02:47.819> you<00:02:48.000> to<00:02:48.060> draw
