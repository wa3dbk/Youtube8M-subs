00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:49.040 
some stupid reason but but looking back
at<00:04:47.220> the<00:04:47.340> importance<00:04:47.820> of<00:04:47.940> the<00:04:48.000> game<00:04:48.240> the<00:04:48.900> way<00:04:48.930> I

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
at the importance of the game the way I

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:51.740 
at the importance of the game the way I
played<00:04:49.410> and<00:04:49.710> the<00:04:49.770> way<00:04:50.100> I<00:04:50.130> felt<00:04:50.600> within<00:04:51.600> that

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:51.750 
played and the way I felt within that

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.230 
played and the way I felt within that
game<00:04:52.520> mostly<00:04:53.520> then<00:04:53.730> like<00:04:53.970> I<00:04:54.000> said<00:04:54.090> the

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 
game mostly then like I said the

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.850 
game mostly then like I said the
importance<00:04:54.750> of<00:04:54.870> it<00:04:54.990> was<00:04:55.110> huge<00:04:55.350> it<00:04:55.500> was<00:04:55.560> a<00:04:55.680> big

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
importance of it was huge it was a big

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.300 
importance of it was huge it was a big
you<00:04:56.220> know<00:04:56.280> beyond<00:04:56.760> Endor<00:04:57.120> literally<00:04:58.280> like<00:04:59.280> I

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
you know beyond Endor literally like I

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:00.320 
you know beyond Endor literally like I
said<00:04:59.490> people<00:04:59.700> to<00:04:59.790> think<00:04:59.940> about<00:05:00.090> at<00:05:00.210> the<00:05:00.240> time

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:00.330 
said people to think about at the time

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:01.550 
said people to think about at the time
but<00:05:00.750> looking<00:05:01.050> at<00:05:01.290> it

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 
but looking at it

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.410 
but looking at it
sovereign<00:05:01.980> recent<00:05:02.400> times<00:05:02.640> it'll<00:05:03.060> probably

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:03.420 
sovereign recent times it'll probably

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:05.540 
sovereign recent times it'll probably
stand<00:05:03.780> out<00:05:03.900> more<00:05:04.080> than<00:05:04.140> anything<00:05:04.380> really<00:05:04.740> but

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:05.550 
stand out more than anything really but

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:06.950 
stand out more than anything really but
at<00:05:05.670> the<00:05:05.730> time<00:05:05.940> it<00:05:06.150> didn't<00:05:06.390> it<00:05:06.600> just<00:05:06.780> seemed

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 
at the time it didn't it just seemed

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.480 
at the time it didn't it just seemed
like<00:05:06.990> a<00:05:07.170> interesting<00:05:07.980> good<00:05:08.100> innings<00:05:08.370> and
