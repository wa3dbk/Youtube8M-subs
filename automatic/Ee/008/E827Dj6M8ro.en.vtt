I<00:02:20.720> noticed<00:02:21.080> about<00:02:21.140> the<00:02:21.470> exterior<00:02:21.980> is<00:02:22.010> that<00:02:22.580> the

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
I noticed about the exterior is that the

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.240 
I noticed about the exterior is that the

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
roof rails are very well integrated into

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.190 
roof rails are very well integrated into
the<00:02:25.340> car<00:02:25.610> yes<00:02:26.150> so<00:02:26.360> they're<00:02:26.510> not<00:02:26.750> an<00:02:26.959> obvious

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
the car yes so they're not an obvious

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.920 
the car yes so they're not an obvious
part<00:02:27.800> of<00:02:27.920> the<00:02:28.010> styling<00:02:28.520> they<00:02:28.790> seem<00:02:29.240> to<00:02:29.270> accent

part of the styling they seem to accent
very<00:02:30.230> much<00:02:30.470> the<00:02:30.680> roof<00:02:30.860> line<00:02:31.010> yes<00:02:31.690> first<00:02:32.690> of<00:02:32.840> all

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
very much the roof line yes first of all

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.660 
very much the roof line yes first of all
they<00:02:33.080> have<00:02:33.320> this<00:02:33.530> brushed<00:02:34.130> aluminum

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
got a load on the roof exact oh that's

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.050 
got a load on the roof exact oh that's
fantastic<00:03:53.329> so<00:03:53.930> not<00:03:54.320> only<00:03:54.470> design<00:03:55.040> feature<00:03:55.370> but

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
fantastic so not only design feature but

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:57.940 
fantastic so not only design feature but
also<00:03:56.209> a<00:03:56.450> great<00:03:56.780> technological<00:03:57.140> feature<00:03:57.709> as

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:57.950 
also a great technological feature as

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:59.440 
also a great technological feature as
well<00:03:57.980> now<00:03:58.430> one<00:03:58.640> of<00:03:58.670> the<00:03:58.820> things<00:03:58.880> I<00:03:59.180> learned

00:03:59.440 --> 00:03:59.450 
well now one of the things I learned

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:01.479 
well now one of the things I learned
about<00:03:59.570> the<00:03:59.870> ESP<00:04:00.380> is<00:04:00.560> it<00:04:00.860> has<00:04:01.040> a<00:04:01.070> downhill

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:01.489 
about the ESP is it has a downhill

00:04:01.489 --> 00:04:04.240 
about the ESP is it has a downhill
function<00:04:02.329> yes<00:04:02.600> which<00:04:02.870> reprograms<00:04:03.680> the<00:04:03.950> entire

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
function yes which reprograms the entire

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.660 
function yes which reprograms the entire
DSP<00:04:04.850> as<00:04:05.450> well<00:04:05.720> as<00:04:05.900> it<00:04:06.049> knows<00:04:06.260> what

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670 
DSP as well as it knows what

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:09.000 
DSP as well as it knows what
your<00:04:06.760> off-road<00:04:07.150> or<00:04:07.480> not<00:04:07.650> that's<00:04:08.650> right<00:04:08.860> we

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
your off-road or not that's right we

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.040 
your off-road or not that's right we
have<00:04:09.220> a<00:04:09.250> so<00:04:09.490> called<00:04:09.670> off-road<00:04:10.450> mode<00:04:10.750> which

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:11.050 
have a so called off-road mode which

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.860 
have a so called off-road mode which
functions<00:04:11.590> below<00:04:11.860> 25<00:04:12.220> miles<00:04:12.640> an<00:04:12.790> hour<00:04:12.910> and<00:04:13.660> it

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
functions below 25 miles an hour and it

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.349 
functions below 25 miles an hour and it
really<00:04:14.140> is<00:04:14.349> great<00:04:14.680> because<00:04:14.920> as<00:04:15.670> you're<00:04:16.030> going

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:16.359 
really is great because as you're going

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:18.210 
really is great because as you're going
downhill<00:04:16.570> with<00:04:17.049> the<00:04:17.079> car<00:04:17.440> it<00:04:17.709> actually

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220 
downhill with the car it actually

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.909 
downhill with the car it actually
enables<00:04:18.970> the<00:04:19.120> wheels<00:04:19.359> to<00:04:19.570> lock<00:04:19.720> up<00:04:19.989> so<00:04:20.739> that

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:20.919 
enables the wheels to lock up so that

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:23.460 
enables the wheels to lock up so that
you<00:04:21.040> can<00:04:21.220> basically<00:04:21.430> a<00:04:21.970> PI<00:04:22.300> on<00:04:22.510> gravel<00:04:23.080> wear

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
you can basically a PI on gravel wear

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.080 
you can basically a PI on gravel wear
and<00:04:23.620> it<00:04:23.770> gives<00:04:23.980> you<00:04:24.130> better<00:04:24.310> traction<00:04:24.730> or

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
and it gives you better traction or

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.030 
and it gives you better traction or
users<00:04:25.480> all<00:04:25.720> a<00:04:25.750> banana<00:04:26.230> you<00:04:26.650> don't<00:04:26.830> need<00:04:26.980> to

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
users all a banana you don't need to

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.010 
users all a banana you don't need to
tell<00:04:27.340> it<00:04:27.520> absolutely<00:04:28.419> so<00:04:28.660> that<00:04:28.840> would<00:04:28.990> be

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
tell it absolutely so that would be

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.350 
tell it absolutely so that would be
handy<00:04:29.440> and<00:04:29.590> snow<00:04:29.860> as<00:04:30.070> well<00:04:30.340> so<00:04:30.610> absolutely

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
handy and snow as well so absolutely

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.629 
handy and snow as well so absolutely
absolutely<00:04:32.320> so<00:04:32.470> you<00:04:32.530> just<00:04:32.800> push<00:04:33.040> that<00:04:33.220> ESP

00:04:33.629 --> 00:04:33.639 
absolutely so you just push that ESP

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:35.220 
absolutely so you just push that ESP
buff<00:04:33.820> and<00:04:33.940> you<00:04:34.030> get<00:04:34.180> that<00:04:34.330> off-road<00:04:34.780> mode<00:04:35.020> in

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:35.230 
buff and you get that off-road mode in

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:38.370 
buff and you get that off-road mode in
that<00:04:35.500> in<00:04:35.950> that<00:04:36.010> speed<00:04:37.000> range<00:04:37.240> oh<00:04:37.360> that's<00:04:37.960> yeah

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
that in that speed range oh that's yeah

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.950 
that in that speed range oh that's yeah
now<00:04:39.220> one<00:04:39.610> of<00:04:39.639> the<00:04:39.760> things<00:04:39.970> Baptist<00:04:40.450> cars<00:04:40.690> this

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 
now one of the things Baptist cars this

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.650 
now one of the things Baptist cars this
is<00:04:41.020> not<00:04:41.380> an<00:04:41.650> urban<00:04:41.979> poser<00:04:42.310> it<00:04:43.000> really<00:04:43.360> does

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.170 
is not an urban poser it really does
have<00:04:43.900> off-road<00:04:44.410> capabilities<00:04:45.190> absolutely<00:04:46.060> so

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
have off-road capabilities absolutely so

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.510 
have off-road capabilities absolutely so
it<00:04:46.360> has<00:04:46.540> a<00:04:46.570> really<00:04:46.900> steep<00:04:47.260> approach<00:04:47.500> angle<00:04:48.130> yep

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 
it has a really steep approach angle yep

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.760 
it has a really steep approach angle yep
as<00:04:48.760> well<00:04:49.000> as<00:04:49.030> the<00:04:49.330> ramp<00:04:49.570> angle<00:04:49.840> 17<00:04:50.560> degrees

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
as well as the ramp angle 17 degrees

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.070 
as well as the ramp angle 17 degrees
yeah<00:04:51.250> so<00:04:51.850> this<00:04:52.090> is<00:04:52.150> something<00:04:52.540> that<00:04:52.780> somebody
