server 2012 hyper-v environment you have

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.480 
server 2012 hyper-v environment you have
a<00:01:24.810> lot<00:01:24.930> more<00:01:25.020> comfort<00:01:25.619> in<00:01:25.770> patching<00:01:26.189> Windows

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
a lot more comfort in patching Windows

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.190 
a lot more comfort in patching Windows
systems<00:01:26.880> and<00:01:27.090> we<00:01:27.180> do<00:01:27.330> with<00:01:27.509> VMware<00:01:27.960> based

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200

systems and we do with VMware based
hosts<00:01:28.619> now<00:01:29.070> you<00:01:29.130> can<00:01:29.670> set<00:01:29.880> at<00:01:30.000> a<00:01:30.030> cluster<00:01:30.420> level

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
hosts now you can set at a cluster level

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.210 
hosts now you can set at a cluster level
to<00:01:30.869> say<00:01:31.049> I<00:01:31.320> want<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:31.650> patch<00:01:31.799> this<00:01:31.950> entire

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
to say I want to patch this entire

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.039 
to say I want to patch this entire
cluster<00:01:32.490> you<00:01:33.030> walk<00:01:33.210> away<00:01:33.509> and<00:01:33.659> it<00:01:33.780> does<00:01:33.930> all

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
cluster you walk away and it does all

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.080 
cluster you walk away and it does all
that<00:01:34.200> work<00:01:34.259> for<00:01:34.409> you<00:01:34.799> with<00:01:35.280> server<00:01:35.549> 2012<00:01:35.909> I

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
that work for you with server 2012 I

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.550 
that work for you with server 2012 I
think<00:01:36.270> Microsoft<00:01:36.689> has<00:01:36.869> pretty<00:01:37.200> much<00:01:37.350> leveled

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
think Microsoft has pretty much leveled

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.200 
think Microsoft has pretty much leveled

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
the field when it comes to hypervisor

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.390 
the field when it comes to hypervisor
with<00:01:39.570> virtualization<00:01:39.960> we're<00:01:40.710> able<00:01:40.860> to<00:01:41.070> easily

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
with virtualization we're able to easily

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.730 
with virtualization we're able to easily
move<00:01:41.970> our<00:01:42.210> VMS<00:01:42.570> from<00:01:42.720> VMware<00:01:43.140> over<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.439> hyper-v

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
move our VMS from VMware over to hyper-v

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.819 
move our VMS from VMware over to hyper-v
now<00:01:44.040> with<00:01:44.549> hyper-v<00:01:44.939> on<00:01:45.420> 2012<00:01:46.200> it's<00:01:46.470> right

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
now with hyper-v on 2012 it's right

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.139 
now with hyper-v on 2012 it's right
there<00:01:47.040> and<00:01:47.340> then<00:01:47.399> when<00:01:47.520> you<00:01:47.610> couple<00:01:47.820> that<00:01:47.970> with

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
there and then when you couple that with

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
system center 2012 you get this entire
