on a sprint

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:09.229 
on a sprint
it's<00:02:01.600> still<00:02:02.100> slow<00:02:03.479> squeeze<00:02:04.800> hold<00:02:05.800> and<00:02:06.370> out<00:02:08.220> now

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
it's still slow squeeze hold and out now

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.220 
it's still slow squeeze hold and out now
if<00:02:10.239> you've<00:02:10.539> still<00:02:10.720> got<00:02:10.869> a<00:02:10.899> little<00:02:10.989> bit<00:02:11.110> of

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
if you've still got a little bit of

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:12.990 
if you've still got a little bit of
energy<00:02:11.379> left<00:02:11.769> we're<00:02:12.400> going<00:02:12.549> to<00:02:12.670> move<00:02:12.819> straight

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
energy left we're going to move straight

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.729 
energy left we're going to move straight
into<00:02:13.330> arms<00:02:13.930> inwards<00:02:14.409> exactly<00:02:14.950> yep<00:02:15.220> so<00:02:16.030> again

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:16.739 
into arms inwards exactly yep so again

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:20.460 
into arms inwards exactly yep so again
this<00:02:17.739> by<00:02:18.099> moving<00:02:18.340> the<00:02:18.580> arms<00:02:18.849> in<00:02:19.030> you're<00:02:19.810> losing

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470 
this by moving the arms in you're losing

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.350 
this by moving the arms in you're losing
a<00:02:20.620> lot<00:02:20.890> of<00:02:20.950> your<00:02:21.129> balance<00:02:21.670> so<00:02:21.879> you<00:02:21.909> have<00:02:22.209> to

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
a lot of your balance so you have to

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.710 
a lot of your balance so you have to
have<00:02:22.540> nice<00:02:22.810> strong<00:02:23.350> core<00:02:23.800> which<00:02:24.430> again<00:02:24.819> you're

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
have nice strong core which again you're

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:26.890 
have nice strong core which again you're
going<00:02:25.810> to<00:02:25.930> feel<00:02:26.110> your<00:02:26.319> hamstring

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.809 
going to feel your hamstring
really<00:02:27.260> hard<00:02:27.470> now<00:02:27.709> it<00:02:27.890> can<00:02:28.040> be<00:02:28.159> quite<00:02:28.430> hard<00:02:28.459> to

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 
really hard now it can be quite hard to

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:32.020 
really hard now it can be quite hard to
also<00:02:29.379> get<00:02:30.379> this<00:02:30.849> going

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:32.030 
also get this going

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.850 
also get this going
so<00:02:32.480> if<00:02:32.599> you've<00:02:32.750> got<00:02:32.780> wheat<00:02:33.200> core<00:02:33.470> you'll<00:02:33.650> know

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
so if you've got wheat core you'll know

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.220 
so if you've got wheat core you'll know
that<00:02:34.099> you'll<00:02:34.250> be<00:02:34.540> moving<00:02:35.540> and<00:02:35.720> rolling<00:02:36.110> all

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
that you'll be moving and rolling all

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:37.929 
that you'll be moving and rolling all
over<00:02:36.560> the<00:02:36.650> place<00:02:36.860> like<00:02:37.129> you're<00:02:37.340> having<00:02:37.610> a<00:02:37.700> spaz

00:02:37.929 --> 00:02:37.939 
over the place like you're having a spaz

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:41.619 
over the place like you're having a spaz
attack<00:02:38.829> so<00:02:39.829> in<00:02:40.099> let's<00:02:40.459> go<00:02:40.730> she's<00:02:41.150> been<00:02:41.360> out<00:02:41.540> of

00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:41.629 
attack so in let's go she's been out of

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:42.789 
attack so in let's go she's been out of
practice<00:02:41.780> so<00:02:42.110> let's<00:02:42.140> see<00:02:42.409> if<00:02:42.470> you<00:02:42.560> can<00:02:42.680> get

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:42.799 
practice so let's see if you can get

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:47.080 
practice so let's see if you can get
this<00:02:42.920> right<00:02:44.409> pressures<00:02:45.409> on<00:02:45.530> now<00:02:45.560> whoa<00:02:46.129> there

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
this right pressures on now whoa there

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.759 
this right pressures on now whoa there
we<00:02:47.239> go

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:47.769 
we go

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:54.429 
we go
no<00:02:48.769> take<00:02:49.220> a<00:02:49.250> breath<00:02:49.489> in<00:02:53.049> right<00:02:54.049> after<00:02:54.409> our

00:02:54.429 --> 00:02:54.439 
no take a breath in right after our

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:56.949 
no take a breath in right after our
brief<00:02:54.799> rest<00:02:55.159> to<00:02:55.459> gather<00:02:55.730> her<00:02:55.970> wits<00:02:56.269> in<00:02:56.629> is

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:56.959 
brief rest to gather her wits in is

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:59.649 
brief rest to gather her wits in is
going<00:02:57.200> to<00:02:57.349> attempt<00:02:57.709> this<00:02:57.859> again<00:02:58.129> so<00:02:58.879> off<00:02:59.269> we're

00:02:59.649 --> 00:02:59.659 
going to attempt this again so off we're

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:09.130 
going to attempt this again so off we're
going

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:09.140 

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.680 

perfect<00:03:09.980> demonstration<00:03:10.280> there<00:03:10.940> you<00:03:11.360> can<00:03:11.510> see

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
perfect demonstration there you can see

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.320 
perfect demonstration there you can see
it<00:03:11.780> she's<00:03:11.990> locked<00:03:12.290> that<00:03:12.890> Court<00:03:13.220> in<00:03:13.550> right<00:03:14.060> and

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:14.330 
it she's locked that Court in right and

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.420 
it she's locked that Court in right and
nicely<00:03:14.960> so<00:03:15.110> she's<00:03:15.260> not<00:03:15.440> wobbling<00:03:16.250> around

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
nicely so she's not wobbling around

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.970 
nicely so she's not wobbling around
shaking<00:03:17.150> it<00:03:17.240> out<00:03:17.500> sometimes<00:03:18.500> I<00:03:18.620> think<00:03:18.680> it's<00:03:18.950> a

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:18.980 
shaking it out sometimes I think it's a

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.130 
shaking it out sometimes I think it's a
bit<00:03:19.100> of<00:03:19.190> a<00:03:19.250> mental<00:03:19.400> game<00:03:19.610> here<00:03:20.060> guys<00:03:20.300> you<00:03:20.780> focus

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
bit of a mental game here guys you focus

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:22.750 
bit of a mental game here guys you focus
on<00:03:21.230> a<00:03:21.260> spot<00:03:21.590> on<00:03:21.740> the<00:03:21.830> ceiling<00:03:22.040> you<00:03:22.460> probably

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
on a spot on the ceiling you probably

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:29.590 
on a spot on the ceiling you probably
wobble<00:03:23.030> around<00:03:23.120> a<00:03:23.390> lot<00:03:23.510> less<00:03:27.400> and<00:03:28.600> resting

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:29.600 
wobble around a lot less and resting

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.740 
wobble around a lot less and resting
there<00:03:31.120> we're<00:03:32.120> now<00:03:32.270> going<00:03:32.450> to<00:03:32.510> demonstrate

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
there we're now going to demonstrate

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.690 
there we're now going to demonstrate
probably<00:03:33.530> the<00:03:33.650> hardest<00:03:34.130> version<00:03:34.520> of<00:03:34.610> the
