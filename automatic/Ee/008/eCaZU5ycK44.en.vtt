00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
header bar like this and now can avoid

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.610 
header bar like this and now can avoid
the<00:02:27.459> vibration<00:02:28.030> noise<00:02:28.060> and<00:02:28.630> the<00:02:29.230> circuit

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
the vibration noise and the circuit

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.490 
the vibration noise and the circuit
starts<00:02:29.860> from<00:02:30.220> the<00:02:30.280> battery<00:02:30.870> this<00:02:31.870> is<00:02:31.989> our<00:02:32.290> load

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
starts from the battery this is our load

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.380
