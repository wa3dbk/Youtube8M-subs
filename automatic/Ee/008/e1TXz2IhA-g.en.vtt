we<00:00:00.420> all<00:00:00.539> have<00:00:00.750> our<00:00:00.780> ideas<00:00:01.290> of<00:00:01.319> what<00:00:01.680> makes<00:00:01.949> a

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:02.070 
we all have our ideas of what makes a

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:04.460 
we all have our ideas of what makes a
good<00:00:02.250> cup<00:00:02.460> of<00:00:02.610> coffee<00:00:02.669> but<00:00:03.540> James<00:00:03.780> calder<00:00:04.290> of

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
good cup of coffee but James calder of

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.950 
good cup of coffee but James calder of
Cherry<00:00:04.770> Hill<00:00:04.980> is<00:00:05.220> one<00:00:05.490> of<00:00:05.609> the<00:00:05.700> Masters<00:00:06.210> he's

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
Cherry Hill is one of the Masters he's

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.740 
Cherry Hill is one of the Masters he's
like<00:00:07.200> a<00:00:07.230> coffee<00:00:07.560> Jedi<00:00:08.099> James<00:00:09.090> took<00:00:09.389> me<00:00:09.540> through

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:09.750 
like a coffee Jedi James took me through

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.120 
like a coffee Jedi James took me through
the<00:00:09.840> process<00:00:10.019> they<00:00:10.469> used<00:00:10.679> to<00:00:10.830> make<00:00:10.950> the

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
the process they used to make the

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.430 
the process they used to make the
ultimate<00:00:11.280> cop<00:00:11.790> and<00:00:12.480> I'm<00:00:12.599> not<00:00:12.840> kidding<00:00:13.290> when<00:00:13.320> I

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
ultimate cop and I'm not kidding when I

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.140 
ultimate cop and I'm not kidding when I
say<00:00:13.740> may<00:00:14.040> have<00:00:14.190> been<00:00:14.400> the<00:00:14.429> best<00:00:14.849> I've<00:00:15.059> ever

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
say may have been the best I've ever

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.930 
say may have been the best I've ever
tried<00:00:15.509> the<00:00:16.379> Chemex<00:00:16.710> method<00:00:17.070> was<00:00:17.220> my<00:00:17.400> favorite

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
tried the Chemex method was my favorite

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.790 
tried the Chemex method was my favorite
but<00:00:18.119> because<00:00:18.420> the<00:00:18.570> process<00:00:18.810> can<00:00:19.320> it<00:00:19.590> takes

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
but because the process can it takes

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.160 
but because the process can it takes
time<00:00:20.100> and<00:00:20.130> precision<00:00:21.000> it<00:00:21.180> may<00:00:21.689> not<00:00:21.869> be<00:00:21.930> for

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
time and precision it may not be for

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.859 
time and precision it may not be for
everyone<00:00:22.560> the<00:00:23.340> Arab<00:00:23.609> brass<00:00:23.820> came<00:00:24.210> close<00:00:24.510> and

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
everyone the Arab brass came close and

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.800 
everyone the Arab brass came close and
it's<00:00:25.410> both<00:00:25.590> simple<00:00:26.070> and<00:00:26.130> inexpensive<00:00:26.810> check

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
it's both simple and inexpensive check

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.900 
it's both simple and inexpensive check
out<00:00:27.960> Steve<00:00:28.380> here<00:00:28.710> as<00:00:28.920> he<00:00:29.070> demonstrates<00:00:29.670> the

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
out Steve here as he demonstrates the

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.720 
out Steve here as he demonstrates the
arrow<00:00:30.060> browse<00:00:30.890> guess<00:00:31.890> is<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.340> aeropress

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
arrow browse guess is the aeropress

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.790 
arrow browse guess is the aeropress
right<00:00:33.270> so<00:00:33.719> today<00:00:34.110> we're<00:00:34.230> going<00:00:34.320> to<00:00:34.380> be<00:00:34.469> doing<00:00:34.530> a

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
right so today we're going to be doing a

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.580 
right so today we're going to be doing a
the<00:00:35.250> inverted<00:00:35.850> method<00:00:36.210> ok<00:00:36.840> basically<00:00:37.410> means

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
the inverted method ok basically means

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.799 
the inverted method ok basically means
it's<00:00:37.770> upside<00:00:38.250> down<00:00:38.280> right<00:00:39.090> because<00:00:39.480> if<00:00:39.570> you

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
it's upside down right because if you

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.180 
it's upside down right because if you
buy<00:00:39.989> one<00:00:40.020> read<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.530> instructions<00:00:41.040> that

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
buy one read the instructions that

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.290 
buy one read the instructions that
actually<00:00:41.520> tells<00:00:41.670> you<00:00:41.879> to<00:00:41.969> do<00:00:42.090> it<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.239> other

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
actually tells you to do it the other

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.060 
actually tells you to do it the other
way<00:00:42.450> yeah<00:00:42.870> this<00:00:43.260> weighs<00:00:43.440> a<00:00:43.469> little<00:00:43.620> also

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
way yeah this weighs a little also

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.160 
way yeah this weighs a little also
better<00:00:44.370> better<00:00:44.969> inverted<00:00:45.450> I<00:00:45.600> found<00:00:45.930> it's

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
better better inverted I found it's

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.840 
better better inverted I found it's
better<00:00:46.379> in<00:00:46.559> for<00:00:46.739> me<00:00:46.800> so<00:00:47.520> it's<00:00:47.640> either<00:00:47.730> like

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
better in for me so it's either like

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.330 
better in for me so it's either like
paper<00:00:48.239> ones<00:00:48.510> which<00:00:48.780> you're<00:00:48.989> just<00:00:49.260> one<00:00:49.469> use<00:00:49.680> for

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
paper ones which you're just one use for

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.439 
paper ones which you're just one use for
then<00:00:50.640> you<00:00:50.730> get<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:51.000> metal<00:00:51.239> forget<00:00:52.079> about<00:00:53.449> 20

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
then you get the metal forget about 20

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.660 
then you get the metal forget about 20
grams<00:00:54.690> of<00:00:54.960> coffee<00:00:55.230> just<00:00:55.770> I'm<00:00:56.039> gonna<00:00:56.250> be<00:00:56.460> above

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
grams of coffee just I'm gonna be above

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.229 
grams of coffee just I'm gonna be above
me<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.149> have<00:00:57.360> ok<00:00:58.280> ok<00:00:59.280> so<00:00:59.430> first<00:00:59.760> is<00:00:59.940> just<00:01:00.000> the

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
me to have ok ok so first is just the

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.110 
me to have ok ok so first is just the
pre<00:01:00.449> infusion<00:01:00.930> so<00:01:01.109> you<00:01:01.170> just<00:01:01.489> for<00:01:02.489> just<00:01:02.910> a

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
pre infusion so you just for just a

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.840 
pre infusion so you just for just a
little<00:01:03.270> bit<00:01:03.390> in<00:01:03.660> there<00:01:03.840> then<00:01:04.680> you<00:01:04.799> can<00:01:04.979> just

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
little bit in there then you can just

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.880 
little bit in there then you can just
fill<00:01:06.180> it<00:01:06.299> right<00:01:06.330> up

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.240 

so<00:01:10.520> do<00:01:10.580> you<00:01:10.610> fill<00:01:10.790> it<00:01:10.880> right<00:01:10.909> to<00:01:11.210> the<00:01:11.240> top<00:01:11.479> I

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
so do you fill it right to the top I

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.980 
so do you fill it right to the top I
fled<00:01:13.250> house<00:01:13.520> to<00:01:13.760> three<00:01:14.180> quarters<00:01:14.600> and<00:01:14.780> then<00:01:14.840> I

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
fled house to three quarters and then I

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.010 
fled house to three quarters and then I
give<00:01:15.140> it<00:01:15.229> a<00:01:15.260> bit<00:01:15.409> of<00:01:15.470> stir<00:01:15.800> so<00:01:16.340> it's<00:01:16.870> see<00:01:17.870> the

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
give it a bit of stir so it's see the

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.080 
give it a bit of stir so it's see the
good<00:01:18.380> thing<00:01:18.530> about<00:01:18.590> this<00:01:18.830> method<00:01:19.610> is<00:01:19.700> it's<00:01:19.880> a

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
good thing about this method is it's a

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.149 
good thing about this method is it's a
full<00:01:20.690> immersion<00:01:20.960> which<00:01:21.290> means<00:01:21.500> the<00:01:21.710> coffee<00:01:21.920> is

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159 
full immersion which means the coffee is

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:24.340 
full immersion which means the coffee is
like<00:01:22.310> fully<00:01:22.610> immersed<00:01:23.000> in<00:01:23.270> the<00:01:23.420> hot<00:01:23.540> water<00:01:23.690> so

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
like fully immersed in the hot water so

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.010 
like fully immersed in the hot water so
once<00:01:24.530> you<00:01:24.680> at<00:01:24.770> once<00:01:25.010> you're<00:01:25.159> done<00:01:25.660> is<00:01:26.660> simply

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
once you at once you're done is simply

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.310 
once you at once you're done is simply
like<00:01:27.229> the<00:01:27.710> latest<00:01:28.160> locks<00:01:28.400> and<00:01:28.729> like<00:01:28.910> that<00:01:29.320> wipe

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:30.320 
like the latest locks and like that wipe

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.680 
like the latest locks and like that wipe
the<00:01:30.350> filter<00:01:30.800> also<00:01:31.009> like<00:01:31.310> helps<00:01:31.610> gravitated<00:01:32.270> to

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:32.690 
the filter also like helps gravitated to

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.290 
the filter also like helps gravitated to
the<00:01:32.780> pod<00:01:32.990> so<00:01:33.979> once<00:01:34.190> you're<00:01:34.369> you're<00:01:34.820> all<00:01:35.090> locked

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:35.300 
the pod so once you're you're all locked

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.880 
the pod so once you're you're all locked
in<00:01:35.479> make<00:01:35.659> sure<00:01:35.810> it's<00:01:35.930> locked<00:01:36.020> otherwise<00:01:36.530> makes

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
in make sure it's locked otherwise makes

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.100 
in make sure it's locked otherwise makes
it<00:01:37.040> like<00:01:37.460> a<00:01:37.490> pretty<00:01:37.729> big<00:01:37.940> mass<00:01:38.119> right<00:01:38.390> and<00:01:38.930> then

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
it like a pretty big mass right and then

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.950 
it like a pretty big mass right and then
you<00:01:39.229> just<00:01:39.350> flip<00:01:39.680> it<00:01:39.800> put<00:01:40.460> it<00:01:40.550> down<00:01:40.720> okay<00:01:41.720> and

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
you just flip it put it down okay and

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.290 
you just flip it put it down okay and
then<00:01:42.710> you<00:01:43.460> don't<00:01:43.610> have<00:01:43.670> to<00:01:43.880> push<00:01:44.060> too<00:01:44.270> hard

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:44.300 
then you don't have to push too hard

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.620 
then you don't have to push too hard
it's<00:01:44.630> just<00:01:44.750> like<00:01:45.140> a<00:01:45.970> you<00:01:46.970> know<00:01:47.000> kind<00:01:47.330> of<00:01:47.390> just<00:01:47.539> a
