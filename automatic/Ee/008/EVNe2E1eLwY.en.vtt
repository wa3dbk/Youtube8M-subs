the sound the quality of the sound I
noticed<00:00:27.730> that<00:00:27.880> your<00:00:28.090> your<00:00:28.390> nails<00:00:28.660> are<00:00:28.900> a

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:28.930 
noticed that your your nails are a

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:32.790 
noticed that your your nails are a
little<00:00:29.110> bit<00:00:29.699> longer<00:00:30.699> side<00:00:31.030> and<00:00:31.900> sometimes<00:00:32.529> you

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:32.800 
little bit longer side and sometimes you

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:35.100 
little bit longer side and sometimes you
know<00:00:32.890> longer<00:00:33.309> nails<00:00:33.520> can<00:00:33.760> create<00:00:34.120> a<00:00:34.390> brighter

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:35.110 
know longer nails can create a brighter

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:39.830 
know longer nails can create a brighter
more<00:00:35.469> brighter<00:00:35.920> sound<00:00:36.309> so<00:00:36.870> I<00:00:37.870> would<00:00:38.230> suggest

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
more brighter sound so I would suggest

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.330 
more brighter sound so I would suggest
when<00:00:40.840> you<00:00:40.930> play<00:00:41.200> something<00:00:41.680> to<00:00:41.860> play<00:00:42.070> with<00:00:42.100> the

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:42.340 
when you play something to play with the

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.100 
when you play something to play with the
nail<00:00:42.520> and<00:00:42.760> the<00:00:42.820> flesh<00:00:43.060> as<00:00:43.239> well<00:00:43.480> because<00:00:43.989> it

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:44.110 
nail and the flesh as well because it

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.170 
nail and the flesh as well because it
creates<00:00:44.440> more<00:00:44.530> of<00:00:44.739> a<00:00:44.860> warmer<00:00:45.399> one<00:00:45.760> more<00:00:46.000> sound

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:46.180 
creates more of a warmer one more sound

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:48.270 
creates more of a warmer one more sound
a<00:00:46.420> little<00:00:46.630> bit<00:00:46.720> more<00:00:46.899> even<00:00:47.350> you<00:00:47.770> know<00:00:47.890> with<00:00:48.040> box

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:48.280 
a little bit more even you know with box

a little bit more even you know with box
music<00:00:48.670> you<00:00:48.760> want<00:00:48.970> to<00:00:49.030> have<00:00:49.239> you<00:00:49.690> know<00:00:49.780> the<00:00:49.899> most

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:58.450 
of notes that sort of stick out a little

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.049 
of notes that sort of stick out a little
bit<00:00:58.719> and<00:00:58.989> there<00:00:59.800> were<00:00:59.920> a<00:00:59.950> different<00:01:00.280> color<00:01:00.670> and

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:01.059 
bit and there were a different color and

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:03.569 
bit and there were a different color and
you<00:01:01.989> want<00:01:02.140> to<00:01:02.290> try<00:01:02.500> to<00:01:02.559> keep<00:01:02.860> the<00:01:03.100> sound<00:01:03.370> is

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:03.579 
you want to try to keep the sound is

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:05.399 
you want to try to keep the sound is
even<00:01:04.269> as<00:01:04.420> possible<00:01:04.869> throughout<00:01:05.049> throughout

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:05.409 
even as possible throughout throughout

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:08.670 
even as possible throughout throughout
the<00:01:05.560> whole<00:01:05.740> movement<00:01:06.009> right<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:07.750> I<00:01:08.170> think<00:01:08.229> you

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 
the whole movement right and I think you

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.010 
the whole movement right and I think you
know<00:01:09.009> try<00:01:09.310> not<00:01:09.340> to<00:01:09.729> move<00:01:09.969> the<00:01:10.479> hand<00:01:10.719> too<00:01:10.899> much

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
know try not to move the hand too much

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.920 
know try not to move the hand too much
maybe<00:01:11.290> if<00:01:11.409> you<00:01:11.500> stay<00:01:11.740> above<00:01:11.860> here<00:01:12.780> would<00:01:13.780> be

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930 
maybe if you stay above here would be

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.230 
maybe if you stay above here would be
good<00:01:14.170> and<00:01:14.470> to<00:01:15.250> maybe<00:01:15.400> shorten<00:01:15.820> the<00:01:15.909> nails<00:01:16.090> a

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.240 
good and to maybe shorten the nails a

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.359 
good and to maybe shorten the nails a
little<00:01:16.479> bit<00:01:16.630> just<00:01:17.229> a<00:01:17.350> little<00:01:17.560> bit<00:01:17.770> is<00:01:17.830> this<00:01:18.159> the

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:18.369 
little bit just a little bit is this the

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:20.910 
little bit just a little bit is this the
usual<00:01:18.520> life<00:01:18.909> that<00:01:19.119> you<00:01:19.270> play<00:01:19.450> with<00:01:19.479> or<00:01:19.960> yes<00:01:20.500> yes

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
usual life that you play with or yes yes

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.950 
usual life that you play with or yes yes
okay<00:01:21.369> so<00:01:21.400> you<00:01:21.640> don't<00:01:21.970> have<00:01:22.090> to<00:01:22.270> change<00:01:22.570> it

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 
okay so you don't have to change it

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.020 
okay so you don't have to change it
drastically<00:01:23.350> immediately<00:01:24.310> if<00:01:24.460> you<00:01:24.549> just

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
drastically immediately if you just

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.490 
drastically immediately if you just
shorten<00:01:25.390> a<00:01:25.450> little<00:01:25.750> bit<00:01:25.900> and<00:01:26.110> they<00:01:26.200> try<00:01:26.439> to

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500 
shorten a little bit and they try to

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.700 
shorten a little bit and they try to
play<00:01:26.950> and<00:01:27.310> a<00:01:27.610> little<00:01:27.850> bit<00:01:27.939> more<00:01:28.500> but<00:01:29.500> like<00:01:29.560> I

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
play and a little bit more but like I

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:31.710 
play and a little bit more but like I
said<00:01:29.890> it's<00:01:30.010> always<00:01:30.130> good<00:01:30.369> to<00:01:30.400> when<00:01:30.670> you<00:01:30.760> when

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 
said it's always good to when you when

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.210 
said it's always good to when you when
you<00:01:31.810> strike<00:01:32.140> the<00:01:32.350> string<00:01:32.680> to<00:01:32.830> strike<00:01:33.070> with

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:33.220 
you strike the string to strike with

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.219 
you strike the string to strike with
both<00:01:33.430> flesh<00:01:33.820> and<00:01:34.090> the<00:01:34.180> nail<00:01:34.390> because<00:01:34.930> that

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:35.229 
both flesh and the nail because that

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:37.170 
both flesh and the nail because that
will<00:01:35.350> create<00:01:35.530> a<00:01:35.619> more<00:01:35.860> warmer<00:01:36.400> sound<00:01:36.790> not<00:01:37.030> so

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:37.180 
will create a more warmer sound not so

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.240 
will create a more warmer sound not so
much<00:01:37.360> bright<00:01:37.659> and<00:01:38.020> also<00:01:38.590> be<00:01:38.710> careful<00:01:39.100> with

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
much bright and also be careful with

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.310 
much bright and also be careful with
with<00:01:39.520> the<00:01:39.610> eighth<00:01:39.759> finger<00:01:40.180> as<00:01:40.299> well<00:01:40.330> when<00:01:41.229> you

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
with the eighth finger as well when you

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.469 
with the eighth finger as well when you
place<00:01:41.560> you<00:01:41.770> know<00:01:41.890> some<00:01:42.100> notes<00:01:42.340> the<00:01:42.759> a<00:01:43.000> finger

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:43.479 
place you know some notes the a finger

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:45.800 
place you know some notes the a finger
is<00:01:43.600> always<00:01:43.810> the<00:01:43.900> most<00:01:44.080> difficult<00:01:44.650> one<00:01:44.799> to<00:01:45.040> play

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
is always the most difficult one to play

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.300 
is always the most difficult one to play
so<00:01:46.810> sometimes<00:01:47.380> the<00:01:47.500> a<00:01:47.530> finger<00:01:47.920> will<00:01:48.070> create

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:48.310 
so sometimes the a finger will create

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.179 
so sometimes the a finger will create
that<00:01:48.490> bright<00:01:48.759> the<00:01:49.210> bright<00:01:49.479> sound<00:01:49.920> so<00:01:50.920> you<00:01:51.009> want

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:51.189 
that bright the bright sound so you want

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:52.710 
that bright the bright sound so you want
to<00:01:51.310> make<00:01:51.640> sure<00:01:51.670> that<00:01:51.909> you<00:01:52.060> turn<00:01:52.299> your<00:01:52.329> hand

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
to make sure that you turn your hand
