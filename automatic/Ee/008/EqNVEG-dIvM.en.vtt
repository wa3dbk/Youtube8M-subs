c<00:02:51.070> stands<00:02:51.370> for<00:02:51.490> city<00:02:51.880> so<00:02:52.360> it's<00:02:52.540> smaller<00:02:52.930> it's

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
c stands for city so it's smaller it's

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:58.210 
kind of thing the interior is certainly

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:59.820 
kind of thing the interior is certainly
different<00:02:58.450> than<00:02:58.690> the<00:02:58.930> prius<00:02:59.230> this<00:02:59.410> looks<00:02:59.620> more

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
different than the prius this looks more

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:02.910 
different than the prius this looks more
like<00:02:59.980> a<00:03:00.010> regular<00:03:00.160> car<00:03:01.110> inside<00:03:02.110> here<00:03:02.470> has<00:03:02.680> the

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
like a regular car inside here has the

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.430 
like a regular car inside here has the
shifter<00:03:03.310> on<00:03:03.340> the<00:03:03.580> floor<00:03:03.850> that's<00:03:04.720> center<00:03:05.110> stack

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
shifter on the floor that's center stack

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.560 
shifter on the floor that's center stack
that's<00:03:05.770> so<00:03:05.920> traditionally<00:03:06.610> prius<00:03:07.030> is<00:03:07.270> gone

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570 
that's so traditionally prius is gone

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.930 
that's so traditionally prius is gone

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
erase this guy might be close now you

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.090 
erase this guy might be close now you
get<00:04:27.630> a<00:04:27.660> little<00:04:27.840> bit<00:04:28.050> of<00:04:28.140> extra<00:04:28.440> sound<00:04:28.740> there

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.100 
get a little bit of extra sound there

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.190 
get a little bit of extra sound there
because<00:04:29.550> the<00:04:29.700> engine<00:04:30.090> has<00:04:30.210> kicked<00:04:30.450> in<00:04:30.630> it's

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:31.200 
because the engine has kicked in it's

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.140 
because the engine has kicked in it's
realized<00:04:31.740> that<00:04:32.070> I'm<00:04:32.220> asking<00:04:32.580> for<00:04:32.790> more<00:04:32.970> than

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
realized that I'm asking for more than

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.210 
realized that I'm asking for more than
just<00:04:33.210> battery<00:04:33.780> power<00:04:34.050> so<00:04:34.350> they've<00:04:34.950> added<00:04:35.190> a

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
just battery power so they've added a

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.410 
just battery power so they've added a
lithium-ion<00:04:35.700> battery<00:04:36.360> so<00:04:36.930> right<00:04:37.140> now<00:04:37.320> Evie

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:38.420 
lithium-ion battery so right now Evie

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:41.750 
lithium-ion battery so right now Evie
mash<00:04:39.420> on<00:04:39.600> the<00:04:39.660> gas<00:04:39.900> the<00:04:40.860> engine<00:04:41.160> kicks<00:04:41.340> in<00:04:41.550> so

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760 
mash on the gas the engine kicks in so

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.210 
mash on the gas the engine kicks in so
even<00:04:42.120> in<00:04:42.210> EV<00:04:42.570> mode<00:04:42.600> it's<00:04:43.500> not<00:04:43.710> going<00:04:43.980> to<00:04:44.040> let

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:44.220 
even in EV mode it's not going to let

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:47.800 
even in EV mode it's not going to let
you<00:04:44.250> just<00:04:45.060> use<00:04:45.390> the<00:04:45.780> battery<00:04:46.170> the<00:04:46.410> lithium<00:04:46.800> ion

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:47.810 
you just use the battery the lithium ion

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:50.120 
you just use the battery the lithium ion
with<00:04:48.810> the<00:04:48.930> plug-in<00:04:49.320> is<00:04:49.530> this<00:04:49.800> kind<00:04:49.950> of<00:04:50.040> a

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:52.410 
testbed car because you know it's got

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:54.710 
testbed car because you know it's got
roughly<00:04:52.710> 11<00:04:53.100> miles<00:04:53.280> of<00:04:53.490> range<00:04:53.700> or<00:04:53.880> so<00:04:54.090> pure<00:04:54.360> EV

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 
roughly 11 miles of range or so pure EV

roughly 11 miles of range or so pure EV
there's<00:04:55.380> some<00:04:55.500> other<00:04:55.590> competitors<00:04:56.160> out<00:04:56.340> there

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
there's some other competitors out there

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.820 
there's some other competitors out there
that<00:04:56.760> do<00:04:57.120> it<00:04:57.270> a<00:04:57.300> little<00:04:57.810> bit<00:04:57.990> higher<00:04:58.230> what's

00:04:58.820 --> 00:04:58.830 
that do it a little bit higher what's

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.760 
that do it a little bit higher what's
the<00:04:58.980> thought<00:04:59.190> there<00:04:59.430> with<00:04:59.610> 11<00:05:00.270> yes<00:05:00.900> ours<00:05:01.530> is

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770 
the thought there with 11 yes ours is

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.040 
the thought there with 11 yes ours is
more<00:05:01.950> of<00:05:02.070> a<00:05:02.190> small<00:05:02.580> battery<00:05:02.880> strategies<00:05:03.780> so

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.050 
more of a small battery strategies so

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:06.110 
more of a small battery strategies so
with<00:05:04.290> the<00:05:04.440> plug<00:05:04.680> in<00:05:04.920> the<00:05:05.460> cargo<00:05:05.730> space

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 
with the plug in the cargo space

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.390 
with the plug in the cargo space
capacity<00:05:06.840> is<00:05:06.930> the<00:05:07.050> same<00:05:07.290> on<00:05:07.530> a<00:05:07.560> plugin<00:05:08.160> as<00:05:08.280> it

00:05:08.390 --> 00:05:08.400 
capacity is the same on a plugin as it

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:10.640 
capacity is the same on a plugin as it
is<00:05:08.520> on<00:05:08.670> the<00:05:08.760> lift<00:05:08.910> back<00:05:09.120> and<00:05:09.450> frankly<00:05:10.380> it<00:05:10.470> helps

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:10.650 
is on the lift back and frankly it helps

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:12.320 
is on the lift back and frankly it helps
us<00:05:10.770> keep<00:05:10.920> the<00:05:11.100> cost<00:05:11.310> down<00:05:11.490> a<00:05:11.640> little<00:05:11.850> bit<00:05:12.000> so<00:05:12.210> we

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.330 
us keep the cost down a little bit so we

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:13.760 
us keep the cost down a little bit so we
don't<00:05:12.480> have<00:05:12.570> to<00:05:12.720> charge<00:05:12.990> you<00:05:13.110> know<00:05:13.680> our

don't have to charge you know our

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:15.830 
don't have to charge you know our
customers<00:05:14.160> as<00:05:14.370> much<00:05:14.580> for<00:05:14.850> that<00:05:14.970> vehicle<00:05:15.240> you

know for my commute for example I

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:19.250 
know for my commute for example I
commute<00:05:17.400> about<00:05:17.580> 16<00:05:18.000> miles<00:05:18.270> and<00:05:18.900> I'm<00:05:19.020> getting

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:19.260 
commute about 16 miles and I'm getting

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:21.320 
commute about 16 miles and I'm getting
between<00:05:19.380> 65<00:05:20.100> and<00:05:20.130> 70<00:05:20.730> miles<00:05:20.910> per<00:05:21.120> gallon

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:21.330 
between 65 and 70 miles per gallon

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:23.510 
between 65 and 70 miles per gallon
overall<00:05:21.900> with<00:05:22.560> the<00:05:22.710> small<00:05:22.980> sure<00:05:23.190> how<00:05:23.280> to<00:05:23.340> rehab

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:23.520 
overall with the small sure how to rehab

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:25.100 
overall with the small sure how to rehab
because<00:05:23.880> you<00:05:24.060> essentially<00:05:24.450> your<00:05:24.570> first<00:05:24.750> 11

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110 
because you essentially your first 11

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:27.050 
because you essentially your first 11
miles<00:05:25.290> are<00:05:25.500> free<00:05:25.770> right<00:05:26.160> right<00:05:26.430> it's<00:05:26.700> got<00:05:26.880> some

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
miles are free right right it's got some

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.120 
miles are free right right it's got some

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:31.170 
space yet at all is there a thought that

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:33.830 
space yet at all is there a thought that
you<00:05:31.470> would<00:05:31.710> then<00:05:32.040> kind<00:05:32.760> of<00:05:32.790> scrap<00:05:33.390> the<00:05:33.600> nickel

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:33.840 
you would then kind of scrap the nickel

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.180 
you would then kind of scrap the nickel
metal<00:05:33.960> hydride<00:05:34.080> even<00:05:34.680> in<00:05:34.800> just<00:05:34.980> your<00:05:35.070> regular

think<00:05:42.870> downstream<00:05:43.290> we'll<00:05:43.440> see<00:05:43.560> how

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:43.650 
think downstream we'll see how

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:45.980 
think downstream we'll see how
lithium-ion<00:05:44.160> you<00:05:44.730> know<00:05:44.820> performs<00:05:45.360> obviously

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:45.990 
lithium-ion you know performs obviously

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:47.540 
lithium-ion you know performs obviously
you<00:05:46.470> know<00:05:46.560> more<00:05:46.680> power<00:05:46.920> output<00:05:47.340> lighter

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:47.550 
you know more power output lighter

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:49.220 
you know more power output lighter
weight<00:05:47.790> it's<00:05:48.000> got<00:05:48.120> great<00:05:48.270> potential<00:05:48.660> we'll

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:49.230 
weight it's got great potential we'll

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:50.630 
weight it's got great potential we'll
continue<00:05:49.350> that<00:05:49.770> way<00:05:49.890> in<00:05:50.010> the<00:05:50.070> short<00:05:50.280> term<00:05:50.430> and

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:50.640 
continue that way in the short term and

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:52.760 
continue that way in the short term and
we'll<00:05:51.570> make<00:05:51.690> some<00:05:51.840> decisions<00:05:52.260> later<00:05:52.440> on<00:05:52.590> and

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:52.770 
we'll make some decisions later on and

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:53.860 
we'll make some decisions later on and
looking<00:05:53.010> mine

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:53.870 
looking mine

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:56.600 
looking mine
so<00:05:54.870> there<00:05:55.020> you<00:05:55.110> go<00:05:55.139> a<00:05:55.500> Prius<00:05:55.949> for<00:05:56.160> everyone

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:56.610 
so there you go a Prius for everyone

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:59.990 
so there you go a Prius for everyone
unless<00:05:57.600> you<00:05:57.750> want<00:05:57.960> a<00:05:58.080> twin-turbo<00:05:59.040> or<00:05:59.280> a<00:05:59.310> pure

unless you want a twin-turbo or a pure
EV<00:06:00.330> can't<00:06:01.080> have<00:06:01.230> that<00:06:01.410> for<00:06:01.620> now<00:06:01.770> but<00:06:02.310> hopefully

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:02.490 
EV can't have that for now but hopefully
