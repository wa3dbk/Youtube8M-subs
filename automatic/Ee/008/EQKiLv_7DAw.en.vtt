even<00:00:40.079> a<00:00:40.320> clip<00:00:40.469> a<00:00:40.590> teabag<00:00:40.920> when<00:00:41.190> it's<00:00:41.340> not<00:00:41.489> even

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
even a clip a teabag when it's not even

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.160 
even a clip a teabag when it's not even
in<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:41.879> pack<00:00:42.090> because<00:00:42.360> of<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.690> more<00:00:42.840> natural

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
in the pack because of the more natural

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.590 
in the pack because of the more natural
color<00:00:43.350> why<00:00:44.010> is<00:00:44.070> that<00:00:44.390> basically<00:00:45.390> these

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
color why is that basically these

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.319 
color why is that basically these
traditional<00:00:46.440> tea<00:00:47.340> bags<00:00:47.579> which<00:00:47.879> it<00:00:48.030> is<00:00:48.149> very

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
traditional tea bags which it is very

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.139 
traditional tea bags which it is very
white<00:00:48.570> color<00:00:48.899> basically<00:00:49.860> undergo<00:00:50.340> a<00:00:50.670> chemical

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
white color basically undergo a chemical

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.990 
white color basically undergo a chemical
bleaching<00:00:51.780> process<00:00:52.020> in<00:00:52.710> order<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.129> make<00:00:53.670> it

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
bleaching process in order to make it

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.270 
bleaching process in order to make it
that<00:00:54.149> white<00:00:54.390> you<00:00:55.350> know<00:00:55.469> naturally<00:00:55.980> paper

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
that white you know naturally paper

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.060 
that white you know naturally paper
isn't<00:00:56.579> white<00:00:56.879> and<00:00:57.120> hence<00:00:57.809> why<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.770> clip<00:00:58.949> of

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
isn't white and hence why the clip of

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.360 
isn't white and hence why the clip of
baggers<00:00:59.460> is<00:00:59.609> more<00:00:59.879> natural<00:01:00.059> color<00:01:01.039> so<00:01:02.039> we<00:01:02.219> add

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
baggers is more natural color so we add

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.549 
baggers is more natural color so we add
nothing<00:01:03.000> artificial<00:01:03.420> to<00:01:03.840> any<00:01:04.019> of<00:01:04.170> our<00:01:04.290> teas

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
nothing artificial to any of our teas

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.320 
nothing artificial to any of our teas
and<00:01:04.920> even<00:01:05.159> our<00:01:05.280> tea<00:01:05.460> bag<00:01:05.670> paper<00:01:05.939> is<00:01:06.150> now

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
and even our tea bag paper is now

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.750 
and even our tea bag paper is now
unbleached<00:01:06.950> okay<00:01:07.950> Dan<00:01:08.159> so<00:01:08.460> what's<00:01:08.610> the

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
unbleached okay Dan so what's the

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.850 
unbleached okay Dan so what's the
