00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 lots of people and likes frida kahlo ma 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.859
 not so much for lorenzi and as it warns 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:10.050
 wait for the character to look like a mouse 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.300
 at disease the stormy died to life that 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.889
 lived that goes you can read on 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.590
 wikipedia actually the bang 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.300
 interesting as well is that she has 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.240
 helped to make themselves at a 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.400
 subject from his painting I think that 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.099
 though with private life as well as the 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.560
 historical context certainly influence 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.689
 on what an artist produces at the end 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.759
 end then the judgment must be given only in 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.920
 based on the works they were successful or not 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.440
 there are artists who have had us 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.660
 rude unruly adventurous life 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.700
 unfortunate and others that came out in the 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.160
 Saturday evening ice cream squares was fat 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.289
 which ran but in both categories yes 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.289
 find geniuses and mediocre artists because 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.360
 he does not want one can be a man woman 

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:54.030
 rich black and white Catholic Jew 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.039
 a woman from apq unlucky all these 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.719
 quality matters but none of them 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:59.940
 quality in seven guarantees that 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.760
 the artist will be good and the work valid 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.860
 so that for example you don't like it 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.570
 the art of frida kahlo that you do n't 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.580
 like what i know about how i was 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.560
 colors or more subjects circle because 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.810
 uninteresting but not what you do n't 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.180
 like because she was a woman or why 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.070
 she was Mexican would come as she knows of 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.890
 that you do n't like the time because roosters 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.840
 they make a bad face so then already in 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.610
 a problem in general towards all and 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.890
 Women all Mexicans or all 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.659
 hens maybe the case that you make yourself see from 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.579
 someone 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.470
 having said that we came to the picture I propose 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.890
 you must know that since she was paralyzed 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.079
 to bed 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.509
 the parents had stuck to the 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.759
 mirror so tar canopy saw 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.350
 always could not new car pictures 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.140
 they are well made for this is a part 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.909
 great from his car that the 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.740
 painter looking for pines and herself 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.540
 interesting from where women are 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.840
 always be a subject or better 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:54.329
 object from naked car to dress could 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.090
 choose pine trees landscapes flowers others 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:02:00.090
 women or or min chose pinewoods 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.100
 to myself as to god I am painting myself or 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.420
 maybe because if he wanted to do soccer again 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.430
 in the ass that should be given life 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.489
 reinventing itself a character a life 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:11.129
 his canvas also always refers to it 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:12.580
 to the Mexican popular Mexican culture 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:14.530
 hostile 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:16.990
 pure symbols in the clothes that he puts on 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.570
 she often has personal references 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.610
 for example his illnesses like here 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:23.740
 necklace of thorns that will recall pain 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.110
 written and monkeys what faith goes into it 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:28.210
 home she used to car well 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.970
 of absence all these various things 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:32.860
 he had around then they had happened like the 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.200
 dpa cooks all the ingredients there is 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.790
 a dispensation in the fray together and there 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.680
 puts his work and the warmth of 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.020
 fire for cooking time and maybe even 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.820
 a bit of inventiveness and what is outside 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:45.310
 It is a cake that is never simple 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:47.140
 sum of the ingredients so see that 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.210
 she gave herself the life she did 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:52.180
 with the Mexican born, they count all right 

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:54.340
 but what matters most is the way with 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.709
 she used all these things commissioning 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.750
 together and na brought out in unique art 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:00.400
 unrepeatable and above all that it can 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.709
 speak also to those who are not women 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.670
 Mexican with a broken hath luckily 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:05.670
 spine
