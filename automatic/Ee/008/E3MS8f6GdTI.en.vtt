00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:06.010
 Well, we're back with one of my maps 

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:07.960
 favorites to play as a team and this is 

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:10.120
 blood than in the remastered version 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:12.670
 hello the master chief collection 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:13.960
 you will find as strike to see how 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:15.970
 zac and I have a question that I 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:19.509
 they were killing if I'm with a 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:21.820
 team of 4 because I'm on my way 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:23.919
 in front by left by right which 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.019
 it is the best good strategy depending 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:27.579
 of the equipment you have is very important 

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:29.800
 divide us on this map by the weapons of 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:31.599
 power in the halo version 2 in the 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.060
 center we have the sword and the 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:35.770
 left we have the sniper then it is 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:38.800
 very important that you send your team 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.120
 for those weapons of power you must divide 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.100
 you according to the skills of each 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.630
 one of the members of your team but at 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.000
 moment of obtaining these weapons is like 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.230
 you can attack the other base because if the 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.420
 another team earns you these weapons 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.070
 mainly in the center is already going to be 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.320
 complicated that you use that way and they 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.390
 have it open to attack you that 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.190
 it's a very good strategy I'm going to see 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.150
 but tell me about the news that has 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.579
 this new version 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.920
 I know that there's a waterfall because no 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:05.110
 tell me a little bit more about the 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.460
 cascade in the strain version has the 

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.650
 remastered 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.270
 is in the main base as I can 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:13.150
 see here the waterfall we are going to have 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.190
 here on the top then for 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.510
 what is the waterfall the waterfall 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:17.950
 that will mainly serve for the 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:19.420
 games of objectives when we 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.630
 let's be alone defending either 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.460
 flag a king of the hill or a bomb 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.020
 It depends on the way we are playing the 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.940
 we can activate so that people who 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:31.000
 It attacks us from the outside, do not see 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:32.560
 well inwards then of that 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.880
 way we will be able to cover 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:36.580
 better and hope that our partners 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:40.300
 3 change or come to give us support 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:42.550
 from other parts of the map very good if 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.899
 you're absolutely right and that other 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:46.179
 news you found on the map 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:48.190
 well there is also another novelty in the 

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:50.320
 map that is in the hall of the shotgun 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:52.270
 in that hall of super attack we have to 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.420
 the left must also our base 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:57.190
 main thing now and that's what we can 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.510
 see here on this side is the corridor of 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.550
 the shotgun 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:02.380
 now in the remastered strain version 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.610
 we're going to have an elevator instead of 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.280
 this stone since it loses sometimes 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.150
 it will be a bit difficult to access for 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:12.340
 to be able to jump the top 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:13.540
 then then now there is an elevator 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.590
 that allows us to access the part of 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.510
 above 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.090
 and we also have another important change 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.700
 in the strain version that is 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.170
 precisely at the center point in 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.270
 place of the sword now we're going for a 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.790
 rocket launcher or jesse because he looks 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:29.770
 educate my parents was not if of 

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:30.910
 done now I consider it better 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.650
 that there is a rock in the night because of 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.210
 that in the sword it was more limited 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.740
 that nothing to the game in the center of the map 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:38.200
 since then that I raise as it is a weapon of 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.640
 short range could not go out and pursue 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.080
 enemies because it was a bit 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.480
 complicated there is not now with rock the 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.680
 launcher can you use it to kill 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.970
 distance to whoever you want in your 

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:48.370
 I consider it a pretty change 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.050
 well of course you have the whole reason campus 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.580
 that tells me if we go to the next 

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.580
 clear capsule euros right now we come back
