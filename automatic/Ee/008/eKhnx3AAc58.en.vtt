00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.999
 hello how are they obviously in progress is 

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:07.970
 Peruvian cuisine dotcom and recipes kitchen 

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:09.440
 we can locate our channel 

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.390
 Youtube 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:14.430
 this time it's going to be a dessert 

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:16.320
 which is very traditional and we are going to do 

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:19.510
 some donuts 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.120
 with a honey that is very 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:25.030
 be accompaniments let's proceed 

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:29.610
 to explain first the mass that 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:32.630
 we do and I already have another normal navy 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:35.440
 I have salt sugar 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.440
 yeast 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.440
 and an infusion of anise already 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.530
 first what we do to do 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.780
 this mass is we have made an infusion of 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:50.320
 anise and it's infused made a ski 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:53.950
 rest we return we have strained and that what 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.690
 we have strained from we have put in the 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:58.090
 dry yeast to go to court 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:02.310
 that hydrated 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.310
 the nearby yeast let's say added 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:11.210
 we have added salt sugar and a 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.549
 Once you 're ready hydrated from 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:17.390
 mature with the waters huber with infusion 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:19.640
 of anise we have done it yet like this 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.220
 let's say to the degree in flour 300 grams 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:25.480
 of flour we have mixed all the 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:28.150
 ingredients to form a dough 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:32.140
 with all those components and at the same time 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:34.600
 we have added a banana 

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:37.990
 we have not pressed until we 're with 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.280
 a puree and we should mixed together 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:42.400
 with the dough that we have made 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:45.100
 formerly as your mixture this mass 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.400
 it is already from hamÃ¡s it will be approximately 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.350
 58 hours 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.690
 if you can remember it the time 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.960
 no problem if the mass is 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.700
 lift less time can not use 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.190
 before the time also suddenly a 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.560
 couple of hours or three hours is depends 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:04.020
 also of the climate of the environment in which 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.270
 they are suddenly a little hotter 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:10.200
 in the place where they will be for that 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:13.680
 it will also be more mature and more 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:17.400
 One is that the dough is ready and it's 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.830
 to be able to work and they will see 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:23.840
 you later on and form a way 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:27.069
 of thread and add to the oil so that it does not 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:30.430
 let him be made 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:33.489
 the proper way 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.760
 the honey when I saw you accompany this 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:35.760
 honey 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:44.000
 it's a sugar drift 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:46.330
 that we put a cup of water with 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.900
 cinnamon and cloves in a saucepan and 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:54.349
 we let it boil with lemon peel 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:03:00.580
 and 5 stages we call it chancaca which is 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:03:04.129
 a sugar that comes dry in a loose ball 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:06.590
 completely yet until it is 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:08.690
 with honey as I said , and once it 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:12.440
 that's how we let it cool and it's already 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:14.750
 as well as what works and what not to do 

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:17.450
 It does not make a honey like sweet sugar 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:19.400
 Come on, it's a honey and a cane honey 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.200
 you can use a cane honey if 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.650
 they like it because they also sell there 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:27.019
 packaged but this is a little more the 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:29.750
 flavor is more pleasant to be able 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:34.280
 accompany this dish because this is more 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:36.769
 this landlord is already out and a little more 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:39.590
 nice the taste already then as you 

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:41.150
 we say is the application of honey what 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.160
 what we're going to do now is let's do 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:47.960
 we 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.960
 and let's proceed to our more 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:56.870
 this feels hot 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.290
 then we have the oil hot 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:12.540
 we obey our fingers only the 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:14.220
 part of the fingertip and what 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:16.880
 we do pay with kiev and so that 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:20.040
 the masella sticks to us then we take out 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:22.500
 an adequate amount 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:25.130
 and what we do can be unique 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.130
 really already 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.880
 how to say everything you can do for another 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:39.900
 kind of suddenly chopsticks but not 

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:42.770
 it burns us we turn around the other 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.770
 extreme and in a way 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:48.980
 to be able to take out and it can go draining 

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:51.140
 the excess oil Africa then already 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:55.280
 is this what we do is we were 

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:59.430
 here and let him take care of and then 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:05:01.860
 we return to do another equal way 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:04.170
 we dip our finger 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:06.840
 fingers and we draw another quantity the 

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:08.550
 same amount that we get then what 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:11.340
 what we do is if we see that it sticks 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:13.170
 we always wet our hands well 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:17.849
 be able to work it beyond then 

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:20.009
 we form as if a ring like this 

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:23.449
 with necessary not also basic since 

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:26.449
 do not be too much because if it does not happen 

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:26.449
 so 

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:40.700
 then you should go pulling so that 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:43.650
 as we say and close and flip fast 

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:48.570
 I approach only to burn 

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:53.880
 already then Monday and until this what 

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:56.639
 we are going to do is remove and so that the 

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:59.460
 excess oils and other reality 

00:05:56.639 --> 00:06:01.789
 second more to later arm our 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:01.789
 plate 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:07.240
 always the most must be maintained 

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:09.970
 closed so it does not dry out because it's 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:12.580
 as a mass with atmosphere can we 

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:14.689
 to be songs we keep making a mass 

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:17.480
 we make our ring 

00:06:14.689 --> 00:06:20.990
 and we are opening 

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:23.980
 and slightly hollow unless the 

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:28.090
 hand we put in our hot oil 

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:28.090
 and quickly 

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:32.310
 the hotter the oil is there 

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:34.920
 that be very careful lowering the 

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:38.550
 temperature because the oil reaches a 

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:42.690
 temperature where is suddenly to 

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:46.080
 burn already then we already have there to 

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:48.960
 our tastes is now ready 

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:52.020
 any very fast we take again 

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:54.960
 for the excess oil already almost already 

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:57.930
 we have our dream there and what 

00:06:54.960 --> 00:07:00.310
 we know is let's proceed to put 

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:02.689
 here 

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:06.379
 Y 

00:07:02.689 --> 00:07:11.560
 we put the world cup and there we have and if 

00:07:06.379 --> 00:07:15.320
 like you we can add 

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:20.190
 suddenly a line of honey 

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:23.310
 nothing more and if you like 

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:25.410
 let's go anywhere so he can of 

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:27.060
 suddenly and savor a little more sweetness 

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:29.990
 we no longer see a new sequence 

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:29.990
 let's hope you read
