00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
getting around to making the repair I've

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.290 
getting around to making the repair I've
head<00:00:22.800> of<00:00:22.890> transmission<00:00:23.460> out<00:00:23.580> for<00:00:23.939> a<00:00:23.970> few<00:00:24.150> weeks

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
head of transmission out for a few weeks

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.790 
head of transmission out for a few weeks
now<00:00:25.039> and<00:00:26.269> here<00:00:27.269> is<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.689> parts<00:00:28.080> transmission<00:00:28.710> I

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
now and here is the parts transmission I

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.269 
now and here is the parts transmission I
purchased<00:00:30.230> and<00:00:31.230> here's<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.740> original<00:00:31.920> I

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
purchased and here's the original I

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:33.620 
purchased and here's the original I
probably<00:00:32.520> could<00:00:32.730> have<00:00:32.759> both<00:00:32.969> the<00:00:33.120> individual

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
probably could have both the individual

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.170 
probably could have both the individual
gears<00:00:33.930> and<00:00:34.200> such<00:00:34.469> but<00:00:34.860> I<00:00:35.100> got<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.460> parts

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
gears and such but I got the parts

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.590 
gears and such but I got the parts
transmission<00:00:36.780> for<00:00:37.070> $75<00:00:38.070> and<00:00:38.250> it<00:00:39.239> had<00:00:39.420> pretty

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
transmission for $75 and it had pretty

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.979 
transmission for $75 and it had pretty
much<00:00:39.719> everything<00:00:40.140> I<00:00:40.230> needed<00:00:41.300> and<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.899> be

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
much everything I needed and to be

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:44.090 
much everything I needed and to be
honest<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.350> parts<00:00:43.590> are<00:00:43.710> probably<00:00:43.920> better

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
honest the parts are probably better

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:47.299 
honest the parts are probably better
than<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.399> originals<00:00:44.789> anyway<00:00:46.100> if<00:00:47.100> you're

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
than the originals anyway if you're

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.549 
than the originals anyway if you're
going<00:00:47.430> to<00:00:47.520> work<00:00:47.670> on<00:00:47.850> a<00:00:47.879> t5<00:00:48.360> they're<00:00:49.079> actually

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
going to work on a t5 they're actually

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.160 
going to work on a t5 they're actually
not<00:00:50.070> bad<00:00:50.579> I<00:00:51.090> thought<00:00:51.660> it<00:00:51.750> was<00:00:51.870> going<00:00:51.989> to<00:00:52.079> be<00:00:52.140> a

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
not bad I thought it was going to be a

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.779 
not bad I thought it was going to be a
lot<00:00:52.410> worse<00:00:52.820> but<00:00:53.820> what<00:00:54.000> you'll<00:00:54.180> want<00:00:54.329> to<00:00:54.449> do<00:00:55.789> and

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
lot worse but what you'll want to do and

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.250 
lot worse but what you'll want to do and
I'm<00:00:57.000> sure<00:00:57.180> there's<00:00:57.420> other<00:00:57.600> videos<00:00:57.960> out<00:00:58.079> there

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
I'm sure there's other videos out there

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.319 
I'm sure there's other videos out there
that<00:00:58.410> say<00:00:58.590> this<00:00:58.770> better<00:00:58.980> but<00:00:59.219> if<00:00:59.460> you<00:00:59.910> can<00:01:00.120> see

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
that say this better but if you can see

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.389 
that say this better but if you can see
right<00:01:00.359> here<00:01:00.539> there<00:01:00.930> is<00:01:01.109> a<00:01:01.170> little<00:01:01.500> roll<00:01:01.859> pan<00:01:02.160> or

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
right here there is a little roll pan or

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.820 
right here there is a little roll pan or

will<00:01:06.930> fall<00:01:07.140> out<00:01:07.380> kind<00:01:08.159> of<00:01:08.220> underneath<00:01:08.580> here

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
will fall out kind of underneath here

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.010 
will fall out kind of underneath here

spring and a ball for the detent for the

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.950 
spring and a ball for the detent for the
shift<00:01:16.080> locations<00:01:17.270> you<00:01:18.270> want<00:01:18.450> to<00:01:18.540> save<00:01:18.720> those

shift locations you want to save those

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.109 
shift locations you want to save those
make<00:01:19.259> sure<00:01:19.290> you<00:01:19.470> don't<00:01:19.560> lose<00:01:19.740> them<00:01:20.119> these

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
and the whole tail shaft slides off then

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.460 
and the whole tail shaft slides off then
you'll<00:01:27.000> be<00:01:27.090> left<00:01:27.299> with<00:01:27.540> something<00:01:27.780> that<00:01:27.990> looks

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
you'll be left with something that looks

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:36.140

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
these bolts off around the top they come

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.359 
these bolts off around the top they come
out<00:01:39.930> pretty<00:01:40.049> easy<00:01:40.439> except<00:01:40.799> for<00:01:40.829> this<00:01:41.070> one<00:01:41.130> here

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
out pretty easy except for this one here

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.560 
out pretty easy except for this one here
you<00:01:41.460> want<00:01:41.610> to<00:01:41.640> be<00:01:41.729> aware<00:01:41.939> that<00:01:42.000> a<00:01:42.210> couple<00:01:42.479> of

these<00:01:42.659> are<00:01:42.840> shoulder<00:01:43.200> bolts<00:01:43.640> so<00:01:44.640> you<00:01:44.729> want<00:01:44.909> to

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
these are shoulder bolts so you want to

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.789 
these are shoulder bolts so you want to
just<00:01:45.299> kind<00:01:45.509> of<00:01:45.540> make<00:01:45.720> make<00:01:46.200> note<00:01:46.439> of<00:01:46.470> where<00:01:46.649> you

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
just kind of make make note of where you

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.200 
just kind of make make note of where you
lay<00:01:46.979> those<00:01:47.250> because<00:01:47.670> they<00:01:47.729> won't<00:01:47.820> fit<00:01:48.060> in<00:01:48.119> the

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
lay those because they won't fit in the

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.160 
lay those because they won't fit in the
other<00:01:48.329> holes<00:01:49.670> once<00:01:50.670> you've<00:01:50.820> done<00:01:51.000> that<00:01:51.240> this

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
other holes once you've done that this

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.719 
other holes once you've done that this
piece<00:01:52.470> comes<00:01:52.770> off<00:01:52.920> you<00:01:53.100> have<00:01:53.189> to<00:01:53.250> wiggle<00:01:53.579> it<00:01:53.700> a

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
piece comes off you have to wiggle it a

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.020 
piece comes off you have to wiggle it a
little<00:01:53.759> bit<00:01:54.030> because<00:01:54.240> of<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.570> shift<00:01:54.869> Forks

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
little bit because of the shift Forks

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:04.010 
little bit because of the shift Forks
let's<00:01:57.030> sit<00:01:57.270> that<00:01:57.450> aside<00:02:01.250> then<00:02:02.250> you<00:02:02.520> have<00:02:03.020> this

I<00:02:22.480> couldn't<00:02:23.110> I've<00:02:23.260> looked<00:02:23.470> at<00:02:23.560> all<00:02:23.680> the<00:02:23.800> gears

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
I couldn't I've looked at all the gears

carefully I couldn't find a single you
know<00:02:27.280> so<00:02:27.430> much<00:02:27.520> as<00:02:27.700> a<00:02:27.730> tooth<00:02:28.210> was<00:02:28.450> chipped

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
know so much as a tooth was chipped

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.920

however<00:02:30.340> 5th<00:02:30.730> gear<00:02:30.940> which<00:02:31.120> is<00:02:31.150> what<00:02:31.390> let<00:02:31.540> go

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
however 5th gear which is what let go

shaft<00:02:33.940> by<00:02:34.209> itself<00:02:35.040> and<00:02:36.040> so<00:02:37.000> pieces<00:02:37.630> went

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
shaft by itself and so pieces went

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.270 
shaft by itself and so pieces went
everywhere<00:02:38.140> but<00:02:38.440> they<00:02:38.709> couldn't<00:02:39.010> get<00:02:39.160> into

everywhere but they couldn't get into
the<00:02:39.430> other<00:02:39.550> gears<00:02:39.850> so<00:02:40.090> they<00:02:40.209> survived

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
the other gears so they survived

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:00.660 
they're easy to change I thought it was
connected<00:03:59.590> and<00:03:59.739> the<00:03:59.799> whole<00:03:59.950> shaft<00:04:00.340> had<00:04:00.579> to

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
connected and the whole shaft had to

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.530 
connected and the whole shaft had to
come<00:04:00.880> out<00:04:01.170> but<00:04:02.400> upon<00:04:03.400> disassembly<00:04:04.360> I

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
come out but upon disassembly I

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.190 
come out but upon disassembly I
discovered<00:04:05.200> something<00:04:06.600> the<00:04:07.600> process<00:04:08.079> of

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
discovered something the process of

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.460 
discovered something the process of
changing<00:04:08.530> the<00:04:08.620> input<00:04:08.890> bearing<00:04:09.160> if<00:04:09.250> you<00:04:09.370> see

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
changing the input bearing if you see

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.140 
changing the input bearing if you see
this<00:04:11.470> little<00:04:11.680> cutout<00:04:12.130> right<00:04:12.160> here<00:04:12.610> to<00:04:12.910> look<00:04:13.030> a

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
this little cutout right here to look a

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.090 
this little cutout right here to look a
little<00:04:13.269> Halfmoon<00:04:13.630> cut<00:04:14.290> out<00:04:14.500> it's<00:04:14.950> a<00:04:15.010> little

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:15.100 
little Halfmoon cut out it's a little

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.560 
little Halfmoon cut out it's a little
hard<00:04:15.340> to<00:04:15.400> see<00:04:15.640> on<00:04:15.670> the<00:04:15.850> video<00:04:15.970> that<00:04:16.979> actually

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
hard to see on the video that actually

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.539 
hard to see on the video that actually
is<00:04:19.570> where<00:04:19.840> this<00:04:20.049> input<00:04:20.290> shaft<00:04:20.739> ends<00:04:21.250> is<00:04:21.370> right

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:21.549 
is where this input shaft ends is right

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:26.400 
is where this input shaft ends is right
here<00:04:22.200> you<00:04:23.400> turn<00:04:24.400> that<00:04:24.580> cutout<00:04:24.880> around

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:26.410 
here you turn that cutout around

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.620 
here you turn that cutout around
to<00:04:27.220> where<00:04:27.340> it<00:04:27.430> matches<00:04:27.610> the<00:04:27.970> bottom<00:04:28.390> gear

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
to where it matches the bottom gear

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:33.690 
to where it matches the bottom gear
there<00:04:29.610> just<00:04:30.610> give<00:04:30.760> a<00:04:30.790> little<00:04:30.850> pressure<00:04:32.700> just

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:33.700 
there just give a little pressure just

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:36.710 
there just give a little pressure just
go<00:04:33.820> ahead<00:04:33.880> and<00:04:34.030> pull<00:04:34.180> that<00:04:34.210> or<00:04:34.900> take<00:04:35.110> it<00:04:35.290> off

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
go ahead and pull that or take it off

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.390 
go ahead and pull that or take it off
throw<00:04:37.720> some<00:04:37.990> tools<00:04:38.230> flying<00:04:38.680> across<00:04:38.950> the<00:04:39.070> shop

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
throw some tools flying across the shop

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:46.200 
throw some tools flying across the shop
here<00:04:40.170> you<00:04:41.170> find<00:04:41.440> that<00:04:43.620> there<00:04:44.620> we<00:04:44.770> go<00:04:44.920> and<00:04:45.700> as

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210 
here you find that there we go and as

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:48.210 
here you find that there we go and as
you<00:04:46.330> see<00:04:46.570> I<00:04:46.750> dropped<00:04:47.140> all<00:04:47.380> the<00:04:47.410> needle

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:48.220 
you see I dropped all the needle

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:49.230 
you see I dropped all the needle
bearings<00:04:48.520> down<00:04:48.700> in<00:04:48.820> the<00:04:48.880> bottom<00:04:49.090> of<00:04:49.150> the

bearings down in the bottom of the

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:50.850 
bearings down in the bottom of the
transmission<00:04:49.780> I<00:04:49.870> didn't<00:04:50.170> do<00:04:50.260> this<00:04:50.440> while<00:04:50.620> ago

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860

when<00:04:51.010> I<00:04:51.100> did<00:04:51.160> it<00:04:51.280> the<00:04:51.430> first<00:04:51.460> time<00:04:51.850> but<00:04:52.000> I

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
when I did it the first time but I

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.470 
when I did it the first time but I
thought<00:04:53.020> it<00:04:53.170> would<00:04:53.260> make<00:04:53.290> a<00:04:53.500> video<00:04:53.890> for<00:04:53.950> y'all

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:54.480 
thought it would make a video for y'all

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:02.440 
parts out of as you can see how have

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:07.830 
parts out of as you can see how have
greased<00:05:02.890> it<00:05:04.110> so<00:05:05.110> they<00:05:05.260> stay<00:05:05.680> in<00:05:05.830> place<00:05:06.840> also

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 
of those and I'm not sure I think it

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.080 
of those and I'm not sure I think it
looks<00:05:17.830> like<00:05:17.950> there's<00:05:18.130> a<00:05:18.190> washer<00:05:18.400> of<00:05:18.700> some<00:05:18.850> sort

that<00:06:04.600> holds<00:06:04.810> that<00:06:05.050> that's<00:06:05.290> what<00:06:05.470> shifts<00:06:05.980> fifth

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:06.610 
that holds that that's what shifts fifth

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:11.550 
that holds that that's what shifts fifth
gear<00:06:06.850> and<00:06:06.910> out<00:06:08.400> so<00:06:09.400> that's<00:06:10.270> about<00:06:11.080> all<00:06:11.350> there

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:11.560 
gear and out so that's about all there

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.330 
gear and out so that's about all there
is<00:06:11.620> to<00:06:11.770> this<00:06:12.430> overall<00:06:13.800> of<00:06:14.800> course<00:06:15.070> if<00:06:15.220> you

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:15.340 
is to this overall of course if you

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:17.520 
is to this overall of course if you
disassemble<00:06:16.120> one<00:06:16.510> further<00:06:16.840> you've<00:06:17.050> got<00:06:17.200> quite

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:17.530 
disassemble one further you've got quite

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:19.140 
disassemble one further you've got quite
it's<00:06:17.830> quite<00:06:18.010> more<00:06:18.190> a<00:06:18.250> bit<00:06:18.669> more<00:06:18.820> complicated

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:19.150 
it's quite more a bit more complicated

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:22.260 
it's quite more a bit more complicated
with<00:06:19.540> all<00:06:19.570> the<00:06:19.810> lock<00:06:20.620> rings<00:06:20.980> and<00:06:21.340> the<00:06:21.430> friction

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:22.270 
with all the lock rings and the friction

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:24.780 
with all the lock rings and the friction
discs<00:06:22.600> and<00:06:22.750> such<00:06:22.930> in<00:06:23.110> here<00:06:23.290> but<00:06:23.520> just<00:06:24.520> for<00:06:24.760> a

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:24.790 
discs and such in here but just for a

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:29.250 
discs and such in here but just for a
quick<00:06:25.210> redneck<00:06:25.630> repair<00:06:26.020> it's<00:06:26.800> not<00:06:27.010> bad
