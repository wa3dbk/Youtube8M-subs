00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.740 
of like that you have like a little bit
of<00:01:38.950> regrowth<00:01:39.280> anyway

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750

tongue<00:01:47.680> ring<00:01:48.570> another<00:01:49.570> tongue<00:01:49.840> and<00:01:50.230> just

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:50.440 
tongue ring another tongue and just

tongue ring another tongue and just
farther<00:01:50.770> back<00:01:52.110> and<00:01:53.110> then<00:01:53.350> wait<00:01:53.830> a<00:01:53.860> few<00:01:54.070> months

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:54.190 
farther back and then wait a few months

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.650

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:10.580 
care of any regrowth then as well as
kind<00:02:09.280> of<00:02:09.310> make<00:02:09.490> it<00:02:09.520> a<00:02:09.670> little<00:02:09.850> bit<00:02:10.000> deeper<00:02:10.210> so

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
kind of make it a little bit deeper so

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
kind of make it a little bit deeper so
that<00:02:11.590> that<00:02:12.070> would<00:02:12.250> be<00:02:12.370> nice<00:02:13.650> so<00:02:16.290> yeah<00:02:17.290> is<00:02:18.280> not<00:02:18.580> a

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
that that would be nice so yeah is not a

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:20.820 
that that would be nice so yeah is not a
whole<00:02:18.910> lot<00:02:19.060> else<00:02:19.090> out<00:02:19.450> the<00:02:19.960> binding<00:02:20.440> it<00:02:20.620> gets

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
whole lot else out the binding it gets

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.550 
whole lot else out the binding it gets
difficult<00:02:21.670> you<00:02:22.150> can't<00:02:22.450> like<00:02:22.600> tie<00:02:22.870> it<00:02:22.930> tight<00:02:23.290> at

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
difficult you can't like tie it tight at

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.500 
difficult you can't like tie it tight at
some<00:02:23.800> point<00:02:24.040> like<00:02:24.250> ah<00:02:24.490> where<00:02:24.880> I<00:02:24.910> am<00:02:25.090> now<00:02:25.240> it's

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
some point like ah where I am now it's

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.900 
some point like ah where I am now it's
like<00:02:25.720> I'm<00:02:26.500> having<00:02:26.800> so<00:02:27.100> much<00:02:27.220> trouble<00:02:27.400> actually

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 
like I'm having so much trouble actually

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.650 
like I'm having so much trouble actually
making<00:02:28.450> it<00:02:28.660> tight<00:02:29.020> and<00:02:30.180> because<00:02:31.180> it'll<00:02:31.420> feel

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
making it tight and because it'll feel

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
making it tight and because it'll feel
tight<00:02:32.190> for<00:02:33.190> about<00:02:33.400> five<00:02:33.670> minutes<00:02:33.990> and<00:02:34.990> that's

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
tight for about five minutes and that's

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.890 
tight for about five minutes and that's
your<00:02:35.800> solution<00:02:35.920> again<00:02:36.280> it<00:02:36.400> feels<00:02:36.550> like<00:02:36.900> so

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
your solution again it feels like so

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.270 
your solution again it feels like so
nice<00:02:38.080> to<00:02:38.200> sit<00:02:38.470> there<00:02:38.650> and<00:02:38.740> like<00:02:38.860> constantly

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
nice to sit there and like constantly

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.800 
nice to sit there and like constantly

I obviously don't think I need to do
that<00:02:43.800> that<00:02:44.800> would<00:02:44.890> be<00:02:45.010> very<00:02:45.190> inconvenient

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:46.650 
that that would be very inconvenient

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
well keep thinking about cutting it

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:59.310 
well keep thinking about cutting it
which<00:02:55.270> if<00:02:55.600> I<00:02:56.050> do<00:02:56.110> it<00:02:56.470> let's<00:02:56.770> face<00:02:56.980> it<00:02:57.040> I<00:02:57.459> hope<00:02:58.320> it

which if I do it let's face it I hope it

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.760 
which if I do it let's face it I hope it
won't<00:02:59.590> be<00:02:59.830> done<00:03:00.070> in<00:03:00.370> a<00:03:00.520> in<00:03:01.000> a<00:03:01.239> proper<00:03:01.770> proper

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:02.770 
won't be done in a in a proper proper

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.990 
won't be done in a in a proper proper
way<00:03:02.970> you<00:03:03.970> know<00:03:05.130> I'm<00:03:06.130> probably<00:03:06.370> gonna<00:03:06.670> run<00:03:06.880> in

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
way you know I'm probably gonna run in

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.930 
way you know I'm probably gonna run in
there<00:03:07.030> with<00:03:07.330> like<00:03:08.130> some<00:03:09.130> Moses<00:03:09.489> sterilized

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
there with like some Moses sterilized

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.610 
there with like some Moses sterilized
equipment<00:03:10.540> but<00:03:10.840> probably<00:03:11.080> consists<00:03:11.470> of<00:03:11.500> a

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:11.620 
equipment but probably consists of a

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.190 
equipment but probably consists of a
exacto<00:03:12.190> knives<00:03:12.400> or<00:03:12.640> something<00:03:13.000> and<00:03:13.720> a<00:03:13.959> shit

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:14.200 
exacto knives or something and a shit

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.130 
exacto knives or something and a shit
ton<00:03:14.320> of<00:03:14.380> mouthwash<00:03:15.300> so<00:03:16.300> yeah<00:03:16.660> I<00:03:16.690> don't<00:03:16.930> know<00:03:17.110> I

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
ton of mouthwash so yeah I don't know I

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:23.580 
ton of mouthwash so yeah I don't know I
wouldn't<00:03:18.030> suggest<00:03:19.030> that<00:03:19.420> I<00:03:19.510> use<00:03:19.720> I<00:03:20.640> don't<00:03:21.640> know

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
wouldn't suggest that I use I don't know

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.280 
wouldn't suggest that I use I don't know
but<00:03:24.489> that's<00:03:24.670> kind<00:03:25.060> of<00:03:25.180> I<00:03:25.450> guess<00:03:25.570> how<00:03:25.810> I<00:03:26.020> know<00:03:26.260> I

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
but that's kind of I guess how I know I

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.370 
but that's kind of I guess how I know I
would<00:03:26.560> end<00:03:26.739> up<00:03:26.830> doing<00:03:27.100> shit<00:03:27.280> so<00:03:27.780> if<00:03:28.780> I<00:03:28.989> ever<00:03:29.080> do

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:29.380 
would end up doing shit so if I ever do

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:30.930 
would end up doing shit so if I ever do

that you can go ahead and
