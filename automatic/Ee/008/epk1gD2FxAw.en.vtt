00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:11.400
Here's some tips and some suggestions of how
to draw a manga dragon.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.460
Now these are very popular in the genres of
fantasy manga, shonen manga.

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.520
They show up a lot of places, and they're
really impressive beasts.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.020
And here's the dragon, the final drawing of
the dragon.

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:25.490
Now let's go back to look at the construction.

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.920
The construction's pretty easy, big head,
narrow snout, big nose.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:36.550
But what you want to do to make it look really
gothic is you want to take that construction

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.690
and find the planes, the different planes,
meaning the different sides and really articulate

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.220
them and have this.

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.190
Now let's go into the details, the things
that give people a little bit of trouble.

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:46.190
First, the horns.

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.010
Now a dragon's horns can go in any direction,
but I think since he's such an aggressive

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.150
creature, it's looks particularly good if
the horns go forward.

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:59.210
So I'm going to draw the first horn forward
like this.

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.180
The base is round here.

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:03.190
See how it's round and not flat?

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:04.420
That's because it's not a block of wood.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.180
It's a round cylinder.

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:12.020
Comes up this way, and then draw the horn
to a very sharp point.

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.430
And also to make it look more real, we give
it a little depth.

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:15.550
And how we do that?

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.230
We show a little bit of the interior with
a shadow.

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.650
See, now it looks like it's got some volume.

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.010
The other one is hidden behind his head.

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:25.010
It's overlapping.

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:27.250
And that's good.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:28.680
Don't apologize for that.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:29.680
Let things overlap.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.480
It makes them look like they have depth.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.600
Again, a little bit of a shadow can be used
here.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.760
Now for the plates, the plates that go on
the back of a dragon.

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.010
A lot of people just put them right on the
back of the neck.

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.430
That's fine if you want to do that, but here's
the center line.

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.820
It means it goes down what would be the center
of the back of the neck.

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:54.610
And if you put the plates here inside of the
outline of the neck, it just looks more real.

00:01:54.610 --> 00:02:00.290
So place it inside, sort of like that.

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:06.210
The last bit of trickiness to draw a dragon
is the smoke.

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.220
Now it's smoke.

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.220
They're not clouds.

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.870
So you're not going to get any bumpy stuff
like this.

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.160
That's cartoony.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:19.010
Instead, believe it or not, you want the smoke
to look a little angular, which makes it look

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.980
a little angry.

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.290
Curl as it lofts up like this.

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.540
See it's got some actual angles to it, and
it's unpredictable.

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.060
It's very random.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:36.130
It gives it sort of a gothic, mysterious look.

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:41.099
And if you want, which I suggest, you put
a few striations on this.

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:44.840
The horn could use a little decorating, and
I like to darken the tips.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.320
It's looks like it's been used.

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.349
And that's a manga dragon.
