00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
actually fairly happy that they picked

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.310 
actually fairly happy that they picked
the<00:00:48.480> drama<00:00:48.690> because<00:00:48.840> we<00:00:48.989> don't<00:00:49.140> feel<00:00:49.230> like

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
the drama because we don't feel like

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.569 
the drama because we don't feel like
it's<00:00:49.440> a<00:00:49.559> strong<00:00:49.800> other<00:00:49.980> Korean<00:00:50.219> patch<00:00:50.370> after

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.850 
it's a strong other Korean patch after
the<00:00:50.850> nerf<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:51.270> for<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.140> Diana<00:00:52.410> I've<00:00:52.680> seen

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
the nerf and for the Diana I've seen

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.229 
the nerf and for the Diana I've seen
some<00:00:53.010> people<00:00:53.250> pick<00:00:53.370> it<00:00:53.489> up<00:00:53.579> against<00:00:53.820> said<00:00:54.059> if

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
some people pick it up against said if

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.150 
some people pick it up against said if
you<00:00:54.690> make<00:00:54.930> it<00:00:54.960> out<00:00:55.110> laying<00:00:55.410> face<00:00:55.590> even<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.100> you

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
you make it out laying face even and you

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.529 
you make it out laying face even and you
reach<00:00:56.340> that<00:00:56.370> Sonya's<00:00:56.969> point<00:00:57.210> she<00:00:57.449> actually

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
reach that Sonya's point she actually

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:58.670 
reach that Sonya's point she actually
does<00:00:57.809> really<00:00:57.989> well<00:00:58.109> against<00:00:58.350> said<00:00:58.500> in<00:00:58.620> the

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
does really well against said in the

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.290 
does really well against said in the
split<00:00:58.890> pushing<00:00:59.039> phase<00:00:59.309> of<00:00:59.460> the<00:00:59.520> game<00:00:59.550> so<00:01:00.180> it's

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
split pushing phase of the game so it's

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.430 
split pushing phase of the game so it's
a<00:01:00.359> good<00:01:00.449> counter<00:01:00.750> if<00:01:00.870> you<00:01:00.989> make<00:01:01.170> it<00:01:01.289> out<00:01:01.379> of

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
a good counter if you make it out of

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.750 
a good counter if you make it out of
that<00:01:01.530> early<00:01:01.649> phase<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.190> you<00:01:02.250> get<00:01:02.399> to<00:01:02.520> the<00:01:02.609> mid

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
that early phase and you get to the mid

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.939 
that early phase and you get to the mid
game<00:01:02.850> it<00:01:03.030> starts<00:01:03.090> by<00:01:03.359> pushing<00:01:03.570> but<00:01:03.870> I<00:01:04.619> feel

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
game it starts by pushing but I feel

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:05.899 
game it starts by pushing but I feel
like<00:01:05.010> it<00:01:05.129> just<00:01:05.159> kind<00:01:05.369> of<00:01:05.400> broke<00:01:05.549> down<00:01:05.760> when

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
like it just kind of broke down when

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:07.399 
like it just kind of broke down when
you've<00:01:06.060> got<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.270> TP<00:01:06.600> top<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:07.049> then<00:01:07.140> I<00:01:07.200> managed

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
you've got the TP top and then I managed

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.450 
you've got the TP top and then I managed
to<00:01:07.500> get<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:07.680> kill<00:01:07.860> made<00:01:08.010> it<00:01:08.130> kind<00:01:08.250> of<00:01:08.310> breaks

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
a high priority against w/e or did you

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.660 
a high priority against w/e or did you
just<00:01:25.380> want<00:01:25.590> to<00:01:25.890> play<00:01:26.009> it<00:01:26.130> cautiously<00:01:26.610> and

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
just want to play it cautiously and

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:27.649 
just want to play it cautiously and
that's<00:01:26.939> why<00:01:27.090> you<00:01:27.150> put<00:01:27.360> so<00:01:27.509> much<00:01:27.600> pressure

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
that's why you put so much pressure

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.649 
that's why you put so much pressure
there<00:01:27.990> um<00:01:28.579> it<00:01:29.579> was<00:01:29.759> basically<00:01:30.060> it<00:01:30.390> was<00:01:30.479> really

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
there um it was basically it was really

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:31.670 
there um it was basically it was really
hard<00:01:30.810> for<00:01:30.840> us<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:30.990> gank<00:01:31.200> bottom<00:01:31.470> because<00:01:31.619> they

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
hard for us to gank bottom because they

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.499 
hard for us to gank bottom because they
did<00:01:31.829> have<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.040> TT<00:01:32.430> p<00:01:32.640> it's<00:01:33.119> really<00:01:33.299> hard<00:01:33.450> to

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
did have the TT p it's really hard to

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:34.730 
did have the TT p it's really hard to
gangtok<00:01:33.659> because<00:01:34.020> they<00:01:34.110> had<00:01:34.200> Sion<00:01:34.530> so<00:01:34.650> we

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
gangtok because they had Sion so we

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.050 
gangtok because they had Sion so we
mainly<00:01:34.920> focus<00:01:35.040> on<00:01:35.310> pressuring<00:01:35.640> minute<00:01:35.909> just

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
mainly focus on pressuring minute just

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.370 
mainly focus on pressuring minute just
putting<00:01:36.270> on<00:01:36.329> as<00:01:36.450> many<00:01:36.540> warrants<00:01:36.869> as<00:01:36.960> possible

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
putting on as many warrants as possible

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.499 
putting on as many warrants as possible
because<00:01:37.500> anywhere<00:01:38.250> we<00:01:38.640> gank<00:01:38.909> they<00:01:39.119> really<00:01:39.329> had

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
because anywhere we gank they really had

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.390 
because anywhere we gank they really had
a<00:01:39.540> way<00:01:39.720> to<00:01:39.780> respond<00:01:40.229> so<00:01:40.530> I<00:01:40.740> think<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.189> best<00:01:41.220> way

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
a way to respond so I think the best way

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.590 
a way to respond so I think the best way
for<00:01:41.640> us<00:01:41.670> to<00:01:41.759> play<00:01:41.909> was<00:01:42.090> either<00:01:42.270> look<00:01:42.479> for

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
for us to play was either look for

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.850 
for us to play was either look for
something<00:01:42.750> around<00:01:42.899> mid<00:01:43.140> or<00:01:43.320> look<00:01:43.500> provision

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
something around mid or look provision

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.950 
something around mid or look provision
