00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:09.770
 in the same line of thought 

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:13.099
 the 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:16.259
 I think the problem of generation gap 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.880
 that existed 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.019
 ten years ago 

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:26.569
 instead of dimming, I get the impression that it is aggravated 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:32.700
 to see me explain 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.700
 ten years ago 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.469
 about ten years and it was here in Spain 

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:42.280
 I remember a workshop with teachers 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.410
 where 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:45.909
 this 

00:00:45.909 --> 00:00:49.050
 because the computers had arrived at school 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.430
 and the teachers looked to use 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.430
 because it's because they did not give us the training course 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.480
 and if there is no excuse training 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.840
 Well, do not be afraid of the taxi driver 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.320
 because they are not trained by the young people who have the classroom 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.880
 instead of asking for a training course outside 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.230
 yes yes if in real life or in the house 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.210
 is done in training 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.840
 teenagers with the youngest 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.710
 because they do not cheer up despite being trained 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.120
 the young that is in the neck 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.120
 we had the historic opportunity 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.460
 get the entry of computers in schools by a 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:35.800
 revulsive 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.150
 in the relationship the sr were revulsive 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.550
 where the teacher will be allowed to teach 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.080
 in this one thing 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.580
 where outside of the school everyone recognizes 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.330
 the boys know more than the adults 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.810
 but as soon as they are on school grounds it is the teacher who should know more 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.670
 and then in all the countries there have been ridiculous situations 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.130
 absolutely absurd 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:05.899
 we do not have standards 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:09.179
 it must say this one is alphabetized for computer 

00:02:11.899 --> 00:02:16.869
 what we do know and what general we use less technology than the available 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:22.540
 as technologies continue to advance and continue to advance and also 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.849
 all the time 

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:27.279
 even in the 

00:02:27.279 --> 00:02:28.350
 I include myself 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.350
 from the beginning we tried to get into this 

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:34.169
 well as time goes by 

00:02:34.169 --> 00:02:38.069
 and the speed of technologies increase and one's years too 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:39.309
 increase 

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:43.309
 Well, the truth is that you do not really know how much time to dedicate this 

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:44.529
 thing 

00:02:44.529 --> 00:02:47.739
 how much is indispensable for 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:50.739
 what remains of his professional life ahead 

00:02:51.429 --> 00:02:58.509
 this problem of the tension between the generational phase shift and him misuse 

00:02:58.509 --> 00:03:02.059
 education that has been made of that generation gap 

00:03:04.399 --> 00:03:06.329
 yes in this generation 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:09.329
 of teachers is going to solve 

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:12.439
 in any case surely 

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:13.709
 when 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:16.939
 we have all teachers by primary marcela 

00:03:17.469 --> 00:03:21.299
 that chan has been with technology installed in society 

00:03:21.969 --> 00:03:24.189
 things are going to change 

00:03:24.189 --> 00:03:29.749
 things nothing but what now we are still with this wrongly resolved tension 

00:03:29.749 --> 00:03:31.709
 among those who do not 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:35.199
 they were born pole to pole computer installed in society that are the 

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:36.209
 students 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:39.209
 and those who saw the computer arrive that are the teachers 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:44.379
 there is a generational tension what 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:47.560
 It is not easy to balance
