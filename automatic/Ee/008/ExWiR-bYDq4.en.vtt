00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
northwest it is a very dry winter so we

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.500 
northwest it is a very dry winter so we
don't<00:00:16.590> have<00:00:16.740> snow<00:00:17.039> on<00:00:17.070> the<00:00:17.310> ground<00:00:17.340> but<00:00:18.210> we've

don't have snow on the ground but we've

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.040 
don't have snow on the ground but we've
been<00:00:18.690> maintaining<00:00:19.760> 20<00:00:20.760> 30<00:00:21.660> degree<00:00:22.020> weather

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
been maintaining 20 30 degree weather

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.029 
been maintaining 20 30 degree weather
pretty<00:00:22.890> much<00:00:23.070> day<00:00:23.310> and<00:00:23.490> night<00:00:23.869> so<00:00:24.869> today<00:00:25.800> we're

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
pretty much day and night so today we're

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.580 
pretty much day and night so today we're
going<00:00:26.160> to<00:00:26.220> do<00:00:26.340> an<00:00:26.460> experiment<00:00:27.260> showing<00:00:28.260> how

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
going to do an experiment showing how

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.420 
going to do an experiment showing how
quickly<00:00:28.890> you<00:00:29.369> can<00:00:29.840> warm<00:00:30.840> up<00:00:30.990> your<00:00:31.650> traditional

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
quickly you can warm up your traditional

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.459 
quickly you can warm up your traditional
Mongolian<00:00:33.000> yurt<00:00:33.270> and<00:00:33.390> you<00:00:33.750> can<00:00:33.930> maintain<00:00:34.170> that

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
Mongolian yurt and you can maintain that

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.860 
Mongolian yurt and you can maintain that
level<00:00:35.130> we<00:00:36.059> are<00:00:36.090> going<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:36.360> be<00:00:36.480> burning<00:00:36.840> the

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
level we are going to be burning the

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.639 
level we are going to be burning the
yodel<00:00:37.380> 602<00:00:38.040> CB<00:00:38.610> wood<00:00:38.879> stove<00:00:39.270> we<00:00:40.170> have<00:00:40.290> left<00:00:40.530> the

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
yodel 602 CB wood stove we have left the

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.380 
yodel 602 CB wood stove we have left the
doors<00:00:40.890> open<00:00:41.370> and<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.579> windows<00:00:41.879> open<00:00:42.210> and<00:00:42.300> the

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
doors open and the windows open and the

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.030 
doors open and the windows open and the
stove<00:00:42.629> has<00:00:42.780> not<00:00:42.960> been<00:00:43.170> on<00:00:43.290> for<00:00:43.530> several<00:00:43.770> hours

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
stove has not been on for several hours

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.940 
stove has not been on for several hours
now<00:00:44.250> so<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.809> year<00:00:46.020> should<00:00:46.200> be<00:00:46.320> nice<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:46.559> cold

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
now so the year should be nice and cold

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.130 
now so the year should be nice and cold
not<00:00:47.789> quite<00:00:48.000> as<00:00:48.120> cold<00:00:48.270> as<00:00:48.450> outside<00:00:48.870> but

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
not quite as cold as outside but

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.690 
not quite as cold as outside but
definitely<00:00:49.860> down<00:00:50.010> in<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.250> 40<00:00:50.579> degree

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
definitely down in the 40 degree

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.720 
definitely down in the 40 degree
temperature<00:00:51.360> we're<00:00:52.110> also<00:00:52.230> going<00:00:52.559> to<00:00:52.680> boil<00:00:53.430> 5

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
temperature we're also going to boil 5

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.389 
temperature we're also going to boil 5
cups<00:00:54.030> of<00:00:54.180> water<00:00:54.480> to<00:00:55.140> show<00:00:55.289> how<00:00:55.469> quickly<00:00:55.739> from

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
cups of water to show how quickly from

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.490 
cups of water to show how quickly from
the<00:00:56.489> cold<00:00:56.760> stove<00:00:57.090> you<00:00:57.390> can<00:00:57.449> boil<00:00:57.780> 5<00:00:58.050> cups<00:00:58.350> of

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
the cold stove you can boil 5 cups of

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.040 
the cold stove you can boil 5 cups of
water<00:00:58.940> ok<00:00:59.940> so<00:01:00.270> let's<00:01:00.390> go<00:01:00.510> ahead<00:01:00.600> and<00:01:00.809> give<00:01:00.899> it<00:01:00.930> a

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
water ok so let's go ahead and give it a

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:27.649 
water ok so let's go ahead and give it a
go

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.039 

the<00:01:28.659> time<00:01:28.960> is<00:01:29.200> 9:30<00:01:30.479> we<00:01:31.479> have<00:01:31.509> an<00:01:31.719> aggressive

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:32.049 
the time is 9:30 we have an aggressive

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:37.319 
the time is 9:30 we have an aggressive
boil<00:01:34.500> we've<00:01:35.500> been<00:01:35.710> burning<00:01:35.979> now<00:01:36.310> for<00:01:37.179> just

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:37.329 
boil we've been burning now for just

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:40.669 
boil we've been burning now for just
over<00:01:37.539> a<00:01:37.689> half<00:01:37.899> hour<00:01:38.229> you<00:01:39.009> can<00:01:39.159> see<00:01:39.630> absolute

00:01:40.669 --> 00:01:40.679 
over a half hour you can see absolute

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:51.660 
over a half hour you can see absolute
smokeless<00:01:41.679> burn<00:01:42.130> from<00:01:42.670> the<00:01:42.789> chimney

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:57.180 

no.5<00:01:52.780> we<00:01:53.780> have<00:01:53.990> reached<00:01:54.320> 70<00:01:55.280> point<00:01:55.730> 5<00:01:56.180> degrees

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 
no.5 we have reached 70 point 5 degrees

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.300 
no.5 we have reached 70 point 5 degrees
and<00:01:58.600> I<00:01:59.600> imagine<00:02:00.110> it's<00:02:00.260> going<00:02:00.530> to<00:02:00.590> just<00:02:00.800> keep<00:02:01.070> on

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.310 
and I imagine it's going to just keep on

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:03.850 
and I imagine it's going to just keep on
going<00:02:01.820> probably<00:02:02.240> get<00:02:02.360> close<00:02:02.690> to<00:02:02.900> 80<00:02:03.140> in<00:02:03.350> here

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
going probably get close to 80 in here

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.950 
going probably get close to 80 in here
before<00:02:04.190> it<00:02:04.550> actually<00:02:04.670> starts<00:02:04.940> to<00:02:05.330> drop<00:02:05.600> down

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
before it actually starts to drop down

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.960 
before it actually starts to drop down
because<00:02:06.320> the<00:02:06.440> stove<00:02:06.740> was<00:02:06.980> cranking<00:02:07.430> for<00:02:07.640> so

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
because the stove was cranking for so

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.920 
because the stove was cranking for so
long<00:02:08.300> for<00:02:08.360> so<00:02:08.720> hot<00:02:09.490> but<00:02:10.490> that<00:02:10.670> that<00:02:11.330> did<00:02:11.600> it<00:02:11.750> it

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
long for so hot but that that did it it

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.520 
long for so hot but that that did it it
took<00:02:12.110> us<00:02:12.520> 1<00:02:13.520> hour<00:02:13.700> and<00:02:14.030> 5<00:02:14.270> minutes<00:02:14.630> to<00:02:15.080> go<00:02:15.230> from

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:15.530 
took us 1 hour and 5 minutes to go from

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.440 
took us 1 hour and 5 minutes to go from
47<00:02:16.490> degrees<00:02:16.640> to<00:02:17.420> 70<00:02:17.960> degrees
