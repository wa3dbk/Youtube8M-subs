BACK-HANDSPRING TUTORIAL 3
spotting â€“ 1

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.300
Hi, guys!

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.000
There are many things to say
about the back-handspring:

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:20.000
Spotting techniques, exercises
on mattresses, exercises to do
in pair or alone.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.800
Let's start with spotting.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.100
There are 3 different ways to spot,
and they should be used in this order
to learn the back-handspring.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.600
Let's start with the 1st.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:35.800
So, your friend should be standing
in a position similar to the
landing from a roundoff.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:46.200
Arms in front, body slightly unbalanced
forwards, without bending the back.
Legs slightly bent.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:51.600
From here, he'll start to work on the
pushing motion for the back handspring.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:01:07.100
So position yourself laterally, put one
hand behind the knee OR behind the back,
based on his height.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:15.400
Put the other hand behind the neck and
support him while he jumps as if he
was doing a back-handspring.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.700
This is what the spotter does.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:28.300
He who does the exercise will slightly flex
his knees, unbalance himself backwards
without arching the back,

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:41.000
keeping his body thight, then he'll launch
his arms and push 45 degrees backwards.
Like so.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
1, 2... 3!

00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:07.800
It's important for the one executing the
drill to keep his legs thight while
landing to avoid the risk of injury.

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.900
Let's see it: in the landing,

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.500
he keeps his legs thight so he
lands in a safe position.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.600
So this was the 1st assistance
for the back-handspring.

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:30.900
In the following videos I'll
show you the other 2.
Hope you liked this one.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.300
See you in the next video!
