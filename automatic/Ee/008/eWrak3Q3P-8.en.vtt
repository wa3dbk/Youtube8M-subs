00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:10.019
 to the next video on the channel and to 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.330
 last ride from ultimate park after all 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.240
 fully horny ride from ultimate team with 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.039
 this theme it is number 7 338 must 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.449
 that be now and I know I have 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:24.240
 I said, I'll do seven like that 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:25.350
 with a team but I have 19 now 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.400
 player actually conditional 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.529
 I do not know how I do that 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.699
 and I do not know how 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.779
 I actually managed that 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.059
 to live after working with this team 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.640
 I played the last game 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.340
 what should i have done with the team 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:40.500
 old salmon everyday that was not really 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.000
 more beautiful so boateng a red 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.980
 get because it expired the opponents 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.420
 whether bonner has a red i get 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.820
 do not even know what to get a red for 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.649
 get the red one 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.910
 I think he was there someday 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.190
 I still do not know yellow-red 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.260
 whether it was a recipient or whether Seehofer afterwards 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.100
 look and see if it eventually to 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.629
 substitutes was 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.739
 I have no idea what might 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:02.879
 also tom strong I have no idea 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:05.729
 honored to get the red 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.360
 you can see it's good too 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.040
 to get 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.060
 I do not know who the yellow-red 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.260
 In any case, still got 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.900
 someone in my opinion one 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.270
 yellow-red so i'm getting in 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.159
 end three players on the bench 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.020
 had to set and had to play with the game 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.340
 so I would work those again 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.110
 So it was not really nice 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.330
 the opponent by complete seeba team 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:29.579
 played and with a silver bronze 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.049
 Silver gold only mainly silver and 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.000
 i had absolutely no chance i have 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.770
 not a single chance because the 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.390
 Just there I had the momentum 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.340
 of death and I hope that against 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.579
 this fc team he will not be the same with 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:43.470
 ca sharing front right navas 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.729
 could be a tough challenge 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.860
 and we just hope that 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.930
 we are in the last game in the rain so well 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.329
 meanwhile wings exist in santiago 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.360
 bernabeu that was in the last game with 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:55.649
 convince this team 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.969
 and now something shit here 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:00.430
 However, so will definitely get 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:02.110
 nothing he ribery but also mister max because 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:06.010
 Mr. Max does not play well then that can 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:07.830
 Team synonymous nothing for me though 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:11.790
 come with the types not yet clear and 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:13.780
 so glad that it's gone 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.400
 I might pity now but 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.110
 can keep up paris in form 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.490
 but comes out pariert in shape I would 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:20.020
 happy if he even comes 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.750
 I'm more on the stindl in the moment 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:23.830
 form trip left because quite happy in the 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.080
 others to try in just 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.040
 what I like so that the parasite 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.850
 can also bring his performance 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.170
 besides , I like to be called 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.720
 wingplayer the play or as 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:33.640
 left striker because fallstrike forest that 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.230
 money that looks very interesting 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.400
 but not for a link 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.780
 At least I think midfielder 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.130
 that was just too inconspicuous because 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.650
 I also gave you a giant 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.750
 only formation where I possibly 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.170
 as a right midfielder suffered the 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:49.780
 player would play or right 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.550
 what the stars went in no matter 1 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.880
 Information I'm going to play there 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:03:01.110
 would be 4 2 3 1 2 because that's it 

00:02:54.880 --> 00:03:01.110
 To some extent, but only goes well 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.100
 fits already 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.770
 that the entrance has me now 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.670
 I really have to be surprised 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.910
 honestly I would never have expected 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.590
 by the way, I'm on my own right now 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.660
 facebook 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.569
 real life and so with an ultra 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:20.269
 dealt 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:23.150
 There are really stupid people sometimes 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:25.249
 one would like to say that there are the most 

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:27.049
 Older people just have the ones 

00:03:25.249 --> 00:03:28.519
 experienced life and usually yes too 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:30.109
 wise one says so at least the 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:31.939
 older people so from the 

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:34.040
 you always suspect that something in the 

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:35.120
 Brains have that they are smart but it 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.620
 there are also people there you can 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:42.049
 Do not just grab the head and say boah 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:44.239
 they are the ones that get hammered when you come in immediately 

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:46.749
 racist is because it says normalos 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:50.120
 So it was about normalo fans and 

00:03:46.749 --> 00:03:52.519
 ultras if you say normalos 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.930
 normal people with normal jobs is 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:55.639
 you are a direct racist because you said yes 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.169
 has that ultras no normal person 

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:59.989
 More though I did not say a word about it 

00:03:57.169 --> 00:04:01.250
 have something I love that is at most 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:01.669
 You could solemnly leave the comments 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.799
 write 

00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:05.000
 if for you the statements are normal 

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:07.400
 normal people with normal jobs 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.500
 implies that ultras are not normal 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.659
 and I would not have any normal jobs 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.530
 really like to know 

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:13.790
 I would also like to 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:15.079
 know if there is a victory here 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.900
 can make the whole would indeed 

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:19.970
 well actually, after all, my 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.440
 sharing have no chemistry there but the 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.380
 does not mean anything in legends 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:26.570
 everything does not stop at laying ribery 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.460
 that is wonderful because of a shell long 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:29.960
 through i thought the eu is still going 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:33.430
 the car is in reverse anyway 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.430
 still with us now nama 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:38.430
 i actually wanted ramona and able 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:48.900
 But he does make the rainbow flick 

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:50.820
 I was not allowed to watch now and I did 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:52.230
 yes times briefly with tom strong r sets 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:58.110
 in all players stop where I red 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:05:00.240
 But I also get a ticket and I boah 

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.830
 just wanted to say that tom strong 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:08.810
 better because it is new and I'll get it 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:13.190
 again the proof directly roma in god 

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:13.190
 I do not say anything to it anymore 

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:27.450
 take care that we make the 2 1 here 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.770
 as soon as possible and then on 

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:30.030
 best also the 3 1 but because I 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:33.390
 thereby a correct gegentor the 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:34.620
 equalize cash markets so 

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:36.420
 Normally I am not the one 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:37.380
 most inconspicuous when defending 

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:38.520
 Work is mainly because I am 

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:40.770
 Mostly when I'm not at the let's 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:43.590
 By the way, play also wants to film coco 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:44.880
 or other no pornos so else 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:45.990
 he recorded something like videos 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:49.460
 meant over how others swore 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:51.870
 For example, youtuber old comment 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:52.710
 but I do not get it that way 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:54.330
 many gates 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:57.300
 the so much with this team 

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:59.130
 shit that is tragic and I suspect 

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:05.070
 Almost that's the second one 

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:06.240
 Goalkeeper will be okay though 

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:10.230
 we now get the ball forward 

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:13.260
 customer comes but comes from it 

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:15.120
 not by the defense leg too 

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:22.410
 but obviously you come 

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:24.900
 can try to play if you will 

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:27.950
 is even so slow is only then 

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:30.780
 fast enough and makes the 2 2 1 yes 

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:31.830
 nice thing nice thing with very little 

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:34.950
 but very much for that 

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:36.990
 I like precision He has done well 

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:38.610
 yes, he has to praise him is a 

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:42.420
 new game in the 21st 

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:45.390
 play in the twentieth 20 I have 20 

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:46.950
 plays a ninth goal is better 

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:50.900
 all you pay for a player 200k 

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:50.900
 but not so tragic now 

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:55.170
 By the way, you knew little fun fact 

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:57.570
 that peter this season more gates and 

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:59.490
 templates as xavi did yes 

00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:01.530
 Weber has four gates and four templates 

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:03.780
 We made three gates and two 

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:06.020
 templates made that must be a lot 

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:06.020
 be called 

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:17.640
 he did not bother anymore and that was 

00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:20.850
 now a very short follow a very 

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:22.650
 abrupt end of this episode but that 

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:26.400
 Let's just take it that way 

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:31.410
 I just say and play one more 

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:33.240
 round with the team yes well I already have 

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:35.250
 often fallen in this consequence if he 

00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:36.690
 No language trainer benefits from this video 

00:07:35.250 --> 00:07:38.310
 description also with psn credit or 

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:39.720

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:40.980
 description to facebook and tobi 

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:42.180
 Also stop by if you have bottrop 

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:43.380

00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:45.920
 still a pure colleague of the 

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:45.920
 boss and co
