00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:07.570
 with this one is enough for them to start 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:10.630

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.079
 as something that my paintings that my 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.670
 brushes are kept clean good in 

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:26.090
 this case these brushes 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:28.040
 you do not have to clean them there's only one 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.689
 Once you use them you have to leave them like this if you already 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.580
 it is not going to be used until the 

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:32.899
 next day or until dinner 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.600
 next time you have to use it from 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:37.790
 again they just put it in a jar 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:41.570
 I'm going to show you where good 

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:44.570
 I already have prepared here I have a 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.549
 transparent glass jar and here 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:48.649
 well these are from the old old people 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:49.970
 I have brushes that look and today that 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:51.619
 I'm going to use it too but today I'm going to 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.299
 replace the facts there for a few 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:55.369
 five minutes and come back like 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:58.010
 new thousand good but then in zambia 

00:01:55.369 --> 00:02:00.020
 it becomes like new 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:02.300
 and then not always mistreats 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.710
 They hold the little hairs together look like 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.680
 you can see it always stays fine 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:09.080
 like this 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.420
 it's already soft it's already clean it's not 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.640
 mistreat that is what this is a 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.070
 liquid of the same brand or of the 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.710
 same range of spray paint only that 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.720
 it's transparent is transparent it does not have 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:23.150
 ink is a clear varnish with that 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.520
 it is agreed then now yes 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.200
 they know how you do not need to have in 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:28.940
 this case good me in this case with my 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.010
 experience that I have I do not need to have 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.290
 I only use the transparent to 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:36.320
 that sometimes my paintings to clean them 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:38.060
 to say so is all that I need 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.410
 so this was recycled once I 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.780
 I've done it the town is partial not what 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.850
 I need and it stays for up to five 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.440
 days it serves me I can hold on to that same good 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.060
 dirty is only to clean the brush not 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.920
 I need it to be 100% clean because 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.320
 It makes me dirty with another brush with 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.330
 another painting and other things more than me 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:55.130
 I'm driving good then once 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:58.060
 I finished using your brush remember 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.060
 that you do not have to wash them here
