00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.710 

hello<00:00:01.020> YouTube

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.750 

this<00:00:04.529> is<00:00:04.740> my<00:00:04.980> version<00:00:05.040> of<00:00:05.549> Kip<00:00:06.150> Ches<00:00:06.569> -<00:00:07.379> box

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:07.760 
this is my version of Kip Ches - box

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:12.680 
this is my version of Kip Ches - box
using<00:00:08.760> a<00:00:08.970> disk<00:00:09.540> drive<00:00:10.250> and<00:00:11.250> his<00:00:12.030> version<00:00:12.420> he

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
using a disk drive and his version he

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.829 
using a disk drive and his version he
had<00:00:12.960> a<00:00:13.230> magnetic<00:00:13.830> switch<00:00:13.950> I<00:00:14.460> used<00:00:15.000> a

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
had a magnetic switch I used a

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.849 
had a magnetic switch I used a
combination<00:00:16.440> of<00:00:16.949> two<00:00:17.699> pins<00:00:18.000> on<00:00:18.180> the<00:00:18.270> back

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:18.859 
combination of two pins on the back

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:22.450 
combination of two pins on the back
essentially<00:00:20.300> when<00:00:21.300> you<00:00:21.420> put<00:00:21.600> a<00:00:21.630> wire<00:00:21.900> between

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:22.460 
essentially when you put a wire between

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:28.429 
essentially when you put a wire between
two<00:00:23.460> of<00:00:23.910> these<00:00:24.150> pins<00:00:24.539> back<00:00:24.779> here<00:00:25.109> it<00:00:25.410> opens<00:00:27.439> but

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
two of these pins back here it opens but

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.330 
two of these pins back here it opens but
you<00:00:28.980> don't<00:00:29.160> know<00:00:29.279> which<00:00:29.490> two<00:00:29.699> it<00:00:29.849> is<00:00:30.170> so

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:31.340 
you don't know which two it is so

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.160 
you don't know which two it is so
there's<00:00:32.340> no<00:00:32.550> switches<00:00:33.090> there's<00:00:33.570> no<00:00:33.750> nothing

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
there's no switches there's no nothing

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.810 
there's no switches there's no nothing
there's<00:00:34.590> nothing<00:00:34.950> done<00:00:35.130> to<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.399> outside<00:00:35.430> of

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
there's nothing done to the outside of

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:42.860 
there's nothing done to the outside of
this<00:00:36.120> disk<00:00:36.719> drive<00:00:36.960> at<00:00:37.110> all<00:00:39.050> but<00:00:40.050> I<00:00:41.840> was<00:00:42.840> just

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
this disk drive at all but I was just

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.209 
this disk drive at all but I was just
gonna<00:00:43.500> put<00:00:44.340> a<00:00:44.370> wire<00:00:44.610> on<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.000> back<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:46.219> connect

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
gonna put a wire on the back and connect

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.510 
gonna put a wire on the back and connect
two<00:00:47.370> random<00:00:47.789> points<00:00:48.090> with<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.329> wire<00:00:48.649> but<00:00:49.649> I

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
two random points with the wire but I

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.670 
two random points with the wire but I
figured<00:00:51.449> out<00:00:51.570> that<00:00:52.100> you<00:00:54.050> can<00:00:55.050> make<00:00:55.079> a<00:00:55.469> little

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
figured out that you can make a little

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.020 
figured out that you can make a little
yourself<00:00:56.070> a<00:00:56.399> little<00:00:56.550> key<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:57.320> you<00:00:58.320> do<00:00:58.500> that<00:00:59.030> if

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
yourself a little key and you do that if

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.570 
yourself a little key and you do that if
you<00:01:00.149> can<00:01:00.300> see<00:01:00.510> it<00:01:01.820> if<00:01:02.820> you<00:01:02.969> see<00:01:04.280> there's<00:01:05.280> these

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
you can see it if you see there's these

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.020 
you can see it if you see there's these
slots<00:01:06.119> back<00:01:06.450> here<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:07.520> plugged<00:01:08.520> into<00:01:08.760> these

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
slots back here and plugged into these

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.719 
slots back here and plugged into these
slots<00:01:09.330> before<00:01:09.990> I<00:01:10.020> rip<00:01:10.680> this<00:01:10.890> out<00:01:11.100> of<00:01:11.250> the<00:01:11.310> DVD

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
slots before I rip this out of the DVD

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.380 
slots before I rip this out of the DVD
machine<00:01:12.260> were<00:01:13.260> cables<00:01:14.159> they<00:01:15.000> have<00:01:15.150> little

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
machine were cables they have little

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.080 
machine were cables they have little
Clips<00:01:15.659> like<00:01:15.869> this<00:01:17.869> see<00:01:19.280> this<00:01:20.280> one<00:01:20.490> fits<00:01:20.909> right

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
Clips like this see this one fits right

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.280 
Clips like this see this one fits right
into<00:01:21.299> here<00:01:21.570> I<00:01:23.659> don't<00:01:24.659> know<00:01:24.750> if<00:01:24.869> you<00:01:24.960> can<00:01:25.110> see

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
into here I don't know if you can see

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.710 
into here I don't know if you can see
that<00:01:26.960> that<00:01:27.960> one<00:01:28.170> fits<00:01:28.409> right<00:01:28.560> under<00:01:28.619> there

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:29.720 
that that one fits right under there

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:35.749 
that that one fits right under there
essentially<00:01:31.880> this<00:01:33.079> is<00:01:34.079> just<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.100> wire<00:01:35.340> it

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
essentially this is just the wire it

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.230 
essentially this is just the wire it
would<00:01:36.119> replace<00:01:36.780> my<00:01:36.990> wire<00:01:37.229> before<00:01:38.060> that<00:01:39.060> would

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
would replace my wire before that would

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:43.219 
would replace my wire before that would
connect<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:39.720> two<00:01:39.960> random<00:01:40.790> pins<00:01:41.790> back<00:01:42.060> here<00:01:42.360> and

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
connect to two random pins back here and

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:49.429 
connect to two random pins back here and
it<00:01:43.829> essentially<00:01:44.960> acts<00:01:45.960> as<00:01:46.290> a<00:01:46.350> key<00:01:47.930> so<00:01:48.930> I'll

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
it essentially acts as a key so I'll

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.899 
it essentially acts as a key so I'll
show<00:01:49.680> you<00:01:49.710> just<00:01:50.509> insert<00:01:51.509> this<00:01:51.750> into<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:52.259> back

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909 
show you just insert this into the back

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:58.429 
show you just insert this into the back
and<00:01:57.229> voila

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
and voila

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.319 
and voila
I<00:01:59.450> haven't<00:02:00.450> modified<00:02:00.780> it<00:02:01.079> yet<00:02:01.229> to<00:02:01.469> go<00:02:01.619> back<00:02:02.040> in

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:02.329 
I haven't modified it yet to go back in

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:05.480 
I haven't modified it yet to go back in
probably<00:02:03.329> not<00:02:03.450> going<00:02:03.659> to<00:02:03.979> but<00:02:04.979> you<00:02:05.130> just<00:02:05.280> push

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
probably not going to but you just push

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.809 
probably not going to but you just push
it<00:02:05.520> back<00:02:05.640> in<00:02:05.880> and<00:02:06.950> if<00:02:07.950> you<00:02:08.099> want<00:02:08.280> to<00:02:08.399> get<00:02:08.700> it

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
it back in and if you want to get it

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.690 
it back in and if you want to get it
going<00:02:09.090> again

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:10.700 
going again

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:18.070 
going again
yes<00:02:13.360> yay<00:02:15.160> if<00:02:16.160> I<00:02:16.250> get<00:02:16.400> enough<00:02:16.640> views<00:02:16.910> I'll<00:02:17.840> show

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:18.080 
yes yay if I get enough views I'll show

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:22.780 
yes yay if I get enough views I'll show
you<00:02:18.170> how<00:02:18.290> to<00:02:18.380> make<00:02:18.530> one<00:02:18.680> of<00:02:18.800> these<00:02:19.630> see<00:02:20.630> ya
