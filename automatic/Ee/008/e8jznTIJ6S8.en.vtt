00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 after i inserted into the program 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.460
 photos can be said that the slide show 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.220
 already ready 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.790
 frames will replace each other and already 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:14.040
 there is something like a movie 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:18.449
 you can see what happened here 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:22.020
 this screen here on this in order to 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.760
 run here there is such a play button 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.670
 pushing this button 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.550
 and here pay attention here here 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:33.390
 this slider it moves here over 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:36.239
 time scale and see what part of the movie 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.360
 now playing here he went 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:43.760
 block transition from the slider see 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:47.309
 approaches the edge and 1 frame is replaced 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:51.570
 actually a simple movie already have a slide 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:54.539
 the show is already there but so uninteresting 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.770
 to have transitions between frames to 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.559
 the picture is beautiful 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.890
 replaced each other and want to be 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:04.700
 animation all effects effect approximation 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.409
 remove move left right forward 

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:10.049
 backwards 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:12.450
 all these effects can be applied separately 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.509
 each frame but it takes me so long 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.549
 50 odd pictures it's very long in 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.150
 This program has a function that 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.530
 The effect adds immediately to the entire frame. 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:26.580
 turning photo sequence 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:29.159
 already in the finished film for this i being 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.200
 on the main tab tab here 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.159
 the main 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.400
 I come here right now to me 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:38.640
 This part of the topic is specifically interested in 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:42.770
 auto movie here offers several 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:47.189
 here click here threads are replaced 

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:51.170
 film form in self black and white 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:54.299
 film movies with various special effects 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.920
 try to push can see 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:02:00.200
 various options 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:02.190
 films i like this one 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.650
 this 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:09.820
 called he shift and scaling 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:12.880
 With such a topic automatically each to 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:14.950
 the bed adds a smooth transition to me 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.230
 like very smooth transitions and when 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.540
 one picture smoothly into another 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.700
 picture I do not like any specials 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.950
 effects that hit their eyes they 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:27.210
 this program has them you can add but 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:30.070
 I personally use this theme and 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:33.310
 plus more automatically added 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:35.080
 animation it is added randomly 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.690
 way some frame is approaching 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.530
 some sort is removed all this is possible later 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:43.390
 correct 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:46.090
 so i click here and it appears 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.100
 hint you haven't added music yet 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.800
 add music now it can be done 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.630
 now or you can do it later 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.410
 time to draw let's add now 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:58.960
 pushing the button up 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:02.320
 I go to the folder in which is 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:04.720
 music and choosing medieval music 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:07.950
 this one I like better 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:10.989
 click click open all music 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:14.820
 automatically added to the film and 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:17.950
 now if i click on play 

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:20.440
 first this screensaver appears 

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:26.290
 it will be possible to change something later 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:32.280
 write your own video and went video with 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:32.280
 transitions with music and already with animation
