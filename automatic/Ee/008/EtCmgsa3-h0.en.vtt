00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.190 
fire it as I said because it has film in
at<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.210> moment<00:00:42.360> so<00:00:42.660> I<00:00:42.690> don't<00:00:42.840> want<00:00:42.960> to<00:00:43.020> waste

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
at the moment so I don't want to waste

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.040 
at the moment so I don't want to waste
the<00:00:43.379> film<00:00:43.590> but<00:00:44.360> there<00:00:45.360> are<00:00:45.539> a<00:00:45.570> couple<00:00:45.780> of

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
the film but there are a couple of

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.170 
the film but there are a couple of
tricks<00:00:46.289> you<00:00:46.500> have<00:00:46.530> to<00:00:46.800> have<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.129> shutter

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
tricks you have to have the shutter

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.840 
tricks you have to have the shutter
before<00:00:48.629> you<00:00:48.719> can<00:00:48.870> close<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.350> lens<00:00:49.530> up<00:00:49.850> because

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
before you can close the lens up because

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.350 
before you can close the lens up because
the<00:00:51.090> way<00:00:51.149> it<00:00:51.270> works<00:00:51.449> is<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:52.500> lens<00:00:52.770> goes<00:00:53.699> into

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
the way it works is the lens goes into

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.880 
the way it works is the lens goes into
the<00:00:54.600> part<00:00:54.899> of<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.110> shutter<00:00:55.670> and<00:00:57.500> to<00:00:58.500> recess

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
the part of the shutter and to recess

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.180 
the part of the shutter and to recess
into<00:00:59.219> that<00:00:59.489> body<00:01:00.120> like<00:01:00.780> that<00:01:01.050> it<00:01:01.739> has<00:01:01.920> to<00:01:02.070> have

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
into that body like that it has to have

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.520 
into that body like that it has to have
room<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:02.670> when<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.149> Kemp<00:01:03.420> camera<00:01:03.930> is<00:01:04.049> reset

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
room and when the Kemp camera is reset

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.500 
room and when the Kemp camera is reset
the<00:01:04.680> shutter<00:01:04.890> is<00:01:04.979> reset<00:01:05.489> it<00:01:06.000> makes<00:01:06.240> it<00:01:06.390> that

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
the shutter is reset it makes it that

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.590 
the shutter is reset it makes it that
room<00:01:06.780> so<00:01:07.140> until<00:01:07.860> you<00:01:08.010> reset<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.640> shutter<00:01:08.909> by

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
room so until you reset the shutter by

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.620 
room so until you reset the shutter by
advancing<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.200> shutter<00:01:10.439> it<00:01:11.250> won't<00:01:11.640> let<00:01:12.510> you

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
advancing the shutter it won't let you

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.420 
advancing the shutter it won't let you
push<00:01:12.960> the<00:01:13.170> lens<00:01:13.350> back<00:01:13.590> in<00:01:13.890> so<00:01:14.130> if<00:01:14.250> you're

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
push the lens back in so if you're

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.010 
push the lens back in so if you're
seeing<00:01:15.210> one<00:01:15.420> of<00:01:15.509> these<00:01:15.600> cameras<00:01:15.960> you're

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
seeing one of these cameras you're

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.149 
seeing one of these cameras you're
having<00:01:16.200> a<00:01:16.229> hard<00:01:16.350> time<00:01:16.409> shutting<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.979> lens

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
having a hard time shutting the lens

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.249 
having a hard time shutting the lens
that's<00:01:17.820> why<00:01:18.060> you<00:01:18.600> have<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:18.840> make<00:01:18.960> sure<00:01:19.020> that

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
that's why you have to make sure that

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.770 
that's why you have to make sure that
the<00:01:19.380> camera<00:01:19.770> is<00:01:19.950> advanced<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:20.909> ready<00:01:21.270> to<00:01:21.360> fire

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
the camera is advanced and ready to fire

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.520 
the camera is advanced and ready to fire
before<00:01:22.650> you<00:01:22.740> can<00:01:22.920> recess<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.180> lens<00:01:24.990> back<00:01:25.229> into

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
before you can recess the lens back into

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.620 
before you can recess the lens back into
