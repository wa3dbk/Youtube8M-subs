because I mowed all right I mowed all
around<00:03:54.970> here<00:03:55.180> so<00:03:55.360> they're<00:03:55.510> growing<00:03:55.780> short<00:03:56.050> and

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:56.590 
around here so they're growing short and

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.680 
around here so they're growing short and
the<00:03:56.680> leaves<00:03:56.920> are<00:03:57.040> short<00:03:57.340> and<00:03:57.550> it<00:03:58.360> wants<00:03:58.660> to

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
the leaves are short and it wants to

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.170 
the leaves are short and it wants to
grow<00:03:59.230> up<00:03:59.350> a<00:03:59.470> flower<00:03:59.710> really<00:03:59.980> quickly<00:04:00.430> and<00:04:00.760> it's

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
grow up a flower really quickly and it's

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.350 
grow up a flower really quickly and it's
leaves<00:04:01.420> it<00:04:01.600> grows<00:04:01.780> leaves<00:04:02.550> basil<00:04:03.550> leaves<00:04:03.970> and

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:04.360 
leaves it grows leaves basil leaves and

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:09.030 
leaves it grows leaves basil leaves and
it's<00:04:05.200> based<00:04:05.500> to<00:04:06.330> to<00:04:07.350> shield<00:04:08.350> out<00:04:08.560> other<00:04:08.740> plants

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
it's based to to shield out other plants

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.240 
it's based to to shield out other plants
so<00:04:09.280> they<00:04:09.400> don't<00:04:09.580> grow<00:04:09.760> around<00:04:09.910> it<00:04:10.270> okay<00:04:10.680> and<00:04:11.680> if

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250 
so they don't grow around it okay and if

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:14.130 
so they don't grow around it okay and if
the<00:04:12.400> grass<00:04:12.610> is<00:04:12.880> high<00:04:12.910> or<00:04:13.480> if<00:04:13.630> the<00:04:13.750> plants<00:04:14.080> are

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:14.140 
the grass is high or if the plants are

the grass is high or if the plants are
high<00:04:14.320> around<00:04:14.620> it<00:04:14.770> it<00:04:14.920> grows<00:04:15.220> high<00:04:15.490> and<00:04:15.970> if<00:04:16.120> it's

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
high around it it grows high and if it's

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:20.430 
high around it it grows high and if it's
short<00:04:16.720> it<00:04:16.870> grows<00:04:17.140> short<00:04:17.560> and<00:04:18.360> it<00:04:19.360> will<00:04:19.570> go<00:04:20.380> to

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
short it grows short and it will go to

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.440 
short it grows short and it will go to
seed<00:04:20.710> as<00:04:20.859> quickly<00:04:21.100> as<00:04:21.310> it<00:04:21.340> can<00:04:21.640> and<00:04:21.910> every

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.450 
seed as quickly as it can and every

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:25.440 
seed as quickly as it can and every
single<00:04:22.870> one<00:04:23.020> of<00:04:23.080> these<00:04:23.320> petals<00:04:23.620> is<00:04:24.420> actually<00:04:25.420> a

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:25.450 
single one of these petals is actually a

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.260 
single one of these petals is actually a
flower<00:04:26.070> that's<00:04:27.070> why<00:04:27.340> I<00:04:27.370> can<00:04:27.670> produce<00:04:27.850> this

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:28.270 
flower that's why I can produce this

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.020 
flower that's why I can produce this
many<00:04:28.570> seeds<00:04:28.990> and<00:04:29.710> they<00:04:29.890> blow<00:04:30.370> away<00:04:30.550> on<00:04:30.850> the

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
many seeds and they blow away on the

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.180 
many seeds and they blow away on the
wind<00:04:31.240> that's<00:04:32.170> the<00:04:32.260> ultimate<00:04:32.440> survivor

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.190 
wind that's the ultimate survivor

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:06.610 
many places as a diuretic especially the

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:08.730 
many places as a diuretic especially the
leaves<00:05:06.850> it's<00:05:07.750> great<00:05:07.960> about<00:05:08.170> it<00:05:08.290> as<00:05:08.380> a<00:05:08.440> diuretic

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:08.740 
leaves it's great about it as a diuretic

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:11.690 
leaves it's great about it as a diuretic
is<00:05:09.220> that<00:05:09.460> it<00:05:10.240> also<00:05:10.360> replaces<00:05:10.690> the<00:05:10.990> potassium

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:11.700 
is that it also replaces the potassium

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:14.730 
is that it also replaces the potassium
that<00:05:12.700> you<00:05:13.090> get<00:05:13.270> rid<00:05:13.450> of<00:05:13.480> when<00:05:13.690> you<00:05:13.840> pee<00:05:14.080> when

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:16.300 
you take this diuretic you need a

you take this diuretic you need a
diuretic<00:05:16.600> the<00:05:16.990> dandelion<00:05:17.470> leaf<00:05:17.650> is<00:05:17.860> very<00:05:17.920> good

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:18.630 
diuretic the dandelion leaf is very good

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:22.320 
diuretic the dandelion leaf is very good
so<00:05:20.280> they<00:05:21.280> say<00:05:21.490> might<00:05:21.730> have<00:05:21.850> come<00:05:21.970> over<00:05:22.120> on<00:05:22.270> the

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:45.170 
and sodium right cuz that's what's in
the<00:06:42.810> plant<00:06:43.080> so<00:06:43.440> I<00:06:43.710> must<00:06:44.700> be<00:06:44.760> getting<00:06:45.060> it<00:06:45.150> from

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:45.180 
the plant so I must be getting it from

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:50.000 
the plant so I must be getting it from
somewhere<00:06:47.419> let's<00:06:48.419> see<00:06:48.690> and<00:06:48.990> it<00:06:49.650> also<00:06:49.740> has<00:06:49.980> a

00:06:51.770 --> 00:06:51.780 
deep taproot so it doesn't compete with

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:54.800 
deep taproot so it doesn't compete with
the<00:06:51.960> grasses<00:06:52.440> okay<00:06:53.190> so<00:06:54.150> like<00:06:54.389> I<00:06:54.480> said<00:06:54.690> it's
