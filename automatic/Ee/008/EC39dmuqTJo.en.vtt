00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.290
 so welcome to the next one 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.600
 player review and today it's about samir 

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:48.340
 nasri second in shape but since after 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.530
 one has come to the conclusion that has 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.840
 the better rating with 84 tempo of 80 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.400
 circuit 88 keys dribbling a 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.230
 pretty big field to carry over with it 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.059
 High city ​​foot is the right one 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.680
 and you still have that gates ahead 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:01.600
 and forster away , you 're fine too 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:04.210
 you get because I wanted to ask if 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.580
 I want to borrow them yes I have 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:07.840
 then something made by him 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.190
 No one has no idea the komani 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.110
 Search comments to write us had 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.360
 Here I am then I can on everyone 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.649
 case has made five games 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.240
 and Pedro has been giving us a long time 

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:17.920
 that's definitely the case 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.200
 pretty good and good too 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.119
 his ingame stats we just see 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.740
 can pretty much green and 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:27.160
 dark green and all his tour with them 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:29.679
 so purely statistically 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.660
 So from values I should not there 

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:33.250
 so much to complain but give only comes 

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:34.810
 times to the positive aspects and the 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.850
 of course, as always with me 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.920
 samir nasri hartford that gates and 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.060
 forestry farmer and it just makes so much 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.739
 fun to play with him 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.119
 he shoots really perfect with so 

00:01:41.739 --> 00:01:45.190
 I really wanted it that way anymore 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:46.750
 he fell in half, he shoots with his left 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.770
 pretty cool you shoot right 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:49.780
 pretty cool 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.030
 as soon as we can shoot 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:56.229
 you'll just see it now 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:59.920
 nothing but long shot 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:02.759
 this today is my birthday last 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:05.020
 something in general this time it does not matter 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:08.860
 longchance right with left both running 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:11.620
 always good at dribbling with him 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.840
 he was cool the ball sticks in so many 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:17.050
 situations simply on the ball the ball 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:19.720
 meanwhile, he was still in the lead 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.040
 and leads the skates we are about to see 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.629
 can also be easy in most 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.050
 you can not really think of it 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:27.370
 gripe 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:28.629
 berbatov spindelberger spin and jobs and 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:30.610
 are good at my favorite songs 

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:31.989
 might become so has it 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.530
 I was definitely having fun with it 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:35.110
 to play 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.849
 and yes his shots canada too fast 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.069
 warns long shot that was 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:40.540
 pretty good and in most cases 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:42.400
 his salon always pretty well 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.370
 You can not really do that well 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.200
 it was the only one who complained a lot 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.850
 entrance there is to it but it was 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.690
 many complacent to help but doing it 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.130
 even later in eclipse you become 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.680
 so long shot definitely good 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.510
 his finesse both from the distance as 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:00.470
 also extremely dangerous in the sixteenth 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:05.210
 yes powershot in the 16er is unfortunately 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:06.770
 often very suddenly weak so 

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:08.210
 Issues very much of the action 

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:09.320
 the German left renner has since 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:11.060
 only if you just ball on it 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:12.800
 an example of this and such a situation 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.660
 he just shoots travel guide on the 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.760
 you can not do anything so im 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:18.560
 Maybe not always last year 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:20.270
 have power so far the upload 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.290
 fitness and in the corner pure that is in 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:23.450
 Most cases pay with you 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.700
 yes best not even say 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.380
 So whether he is a negative fraction 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:29.780
 point is another negative point 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:31.040
 maketh improve so that is 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:34.520
 Of course not now the body 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.030
 strongest that is stupid but you can 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.100
 do not do it 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:38.630
 He does not come in so often 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.520
 fight situation purely because he is with 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.830
 84 pace now on his sink because 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.150
 fast in the face and therefore 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:45.380
 can be easy in most situations 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.090
 remove 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:49.040
 and otherwise only a good one 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.920
 dribbling and that's what it's about 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:54.370
 not so easy off the ball but 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:57.200
 of course, is all about the body stretch 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:59.930
 that unfortunately already quite often and that 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.760
 you just make less fun and therefore 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.440
 not quite the body stuck 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.209
 but what is good again was because he 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:06.890
 also in outdoor player is as I said 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:09.470
 just a good pace you can get on everyone 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.989
 fall and its corners and its flanks 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:13.610
 In any case, these are pretty much none 

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:16.190
 Passes generally he would also have more apps 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:17.570
 is done when i am with benzema and stuff 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.280
 or perhaps even to general 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:21.709
 not always so many chances for yourself 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:24.650
 If so much more it would have been hacked 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:27.220
 So I'm just going to be the corner 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:29.750
 and of his four s21 triangles 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.100
 his corners are just as precise as 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.390
 otherwise what night smaller one of the 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:35.450
 match will make a horny decision 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:37.430
 He, too, so he really does but should 

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:39.320
 one is the cattle just would argue 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.330
 and that's why getting away is a good client 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.860
 yes, what is still good with him 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.540
 of course a perfect work guess with 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:46.220
 hello yes that makes fun understands 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:48.380
 actually in every imaginable way 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:50.540
 situation is always pretty good there and 

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:52.100
 cultururnation good league pale cross with 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:55.280
 brown curly hair seen from him 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:56.810
 that's why there's nothing about it 

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.120
 to criticize hybrid temperance with him 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:01.160
 because yes, you can finally reach france 

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.500
 only cooperate well and therefore years 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:05.050
 we come then 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:07.360
 all these positive aspects on one 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:10.120
 Overall, the rating in my opinion 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.620
 So from 914 points because nasri has 

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:15.160
 actually escalated pretty much with me 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:17.350
 I found the important thing is first 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:20.770
 for ticks in the form of the 780 yes she does 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:24.880
 makes relatively cheap in the bbl 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:26.800
 with 150 km and it makes easy access 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:28.720
 just horny fun the same does not like 

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.430
 so the result player as well as mandzukic 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:32.380
 or so already with me not so good 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:34.210
 has never cut off so well with me 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:35.410
 cut off and yes that we had 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:37.030
 just fun to play with him 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:39.310
 and that would just be the nine of me 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:40.600
 ten points and then mine 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:41.470
 opinion justified and that 

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.330
 it was already from this again 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:44.350
 player review i detest i hope 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:46.450
 you had fun writing video 

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:48.310
 my comments who will come it will 

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:49.750
 is considered this cinema i mobile com was yes 

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:51.760
 but so many have wished 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:54.280
 we would like to be right in the 

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:55.990
 want to see mobile or just easy 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:58.930
 only flax wanted no idea so 

00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:02.430
 Then have a nice day 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:02.430
 see and see
