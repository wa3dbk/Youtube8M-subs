I'm<00:00:00.420> really<00:00:00.659> not<00:00:00.810> sure<00:00:00.870> which<00:00:01.170> is<00:00:01.290> which<00:00:01.410> it's

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
I'm really not sure which is which it's

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:03.770 
I'm really not sure which is which it's
Rosa<00:00:02.820> would<00:00:03.000> certainly<00:00:03.330> make<00:00:03.480> a<00:00:03.540> lot<00:00:03.659> more

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:03.780 
Rosa would certainly make a lot more

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.720 
Rosa would certainly make a lot more
sense<00:00:03.840> since<00:00:04.740> Cerberus<00:00:05.160> doesn't<00:00:05.400> exist<00:00:05.609> yet

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
sense since Cerberus doesn't exist yet

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.220 
sense since Cerberus doesn't exist yet
obviously<00:00:06.270> all<00:00:06.720> right<00:00:06.870> so<00:00:06.960> now<00:00:07.049> we're<00:00:07.140> gonna

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
obviously all right so now we're gonna

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:08.390 
obviously all right so now we're gonna
go<00:00:07.379> outside<00:00:07.529> we're<00:00:07.950> going<00:00:08.099> to<00:00:08.160> solve<00:00:08.340> the

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
go outside we're going to solve the

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.629 
go outside we're going to solve the
really<00:00:08.519> just<00:00:08.760> gravestone<00:00:09.330> puzzle<00:00:09.809> now<00:00:10.139> again

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:10.639 
really just gravestone puzzle now again

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:13.209 
really just gravestone puzzle now again
you<00:00:11.639> have<00:00:11.670> to<00:00:11.849> remember<00:00:11.910> that<00:00:12.300> supposedly

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:13.219 
you have to remember that supposedly

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:15.379 
you have to remember that supposedly
there's<00:00:14.219> no<00:00:14.340> expression<00:00:14.759> for<00:00:14.880> this<00:00:14.969> mechanism

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
there's no expression for this mechanism

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.230 
there's no expression for this mechanism
existing<00:00:16.199> here<00:00:16.500> or<00:00:16.710> for<00:00:17.520> that<00:00:17.609> matter<00:00:17.670> why

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
existing here or for that matter why

existing here or for that matter why
master<00:00:18.510> Audrey<00:00:18.900> would<00:00:19.050> decide<00:00:19.410> he<00:00:19.800> needed<00:00:20.100> it

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
master Audrey would decide he needed it

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.090 
master Audrey would decide he needed it
being<00:00:20.490> as<00:00:20.609> he<00:00:20.699> can't<00:00:20.880> jump<00:00:21.119> that<00:00:21.150> high<00:00:21.270> anyway

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:22.100 
being as he can't jump that high anyway

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.460 
being as he can't jump that high anyway
it's<00:00:23.100> just<00:00:23.340> really<00:00:24.269> poor<00:00:24.630> excuse<00:00:25.109> for<00:00:25.140> this<00:00:25.350> to

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
it's just really poor excuse for this to

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.620 
it's just really poor excuse for this to
be<00:00:25.619> okay<00:00:26.250> we<00:00:26.609> see<00:00:26.730> a<00:00:26.760> switch<00:00:27.000> to<00:00:27.180> repress<00:00:27.390> it<00:00:27.539> so

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
be okay we see a switch to repress it so

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:28.640 
be okay we see a switch to repress it so
we<00:00:27.720> got<00:00:27.840> to<00:00:27.900> do<00:00:27.960> this<00:00:28.050> in<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.260> order<00:00:28.439> in<00:00:28.619> which

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
we got to do this in the order in which

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.679 
we got to do this in the order in which
he<00:00:29.310> intended<00:00:29.670> to<00:00:29.789> turn<00:00:29.939> people<00:00:30.210> into<00:00:30.240> vampires

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
he intended to turn people into vampires

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:31.939 
he intended to turn people into vampires
so<00:00:30.779> of<00:00:30.869> course<00:00:30.960> he<00:00:31.140> is<00:00:31.230> a<00:00:31.260> vampire<00:00:31.410> himself

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
so of course he is a vampire himself

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.220 
so of course he is a vampire himself
first<00:00:32.270> then<00:00:33.270> he<00:00:33.360> intended<00:00:33.719> to<00:00:33.750> turn<00:00:33.930> his<00:00:34.050> wife

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
first then he intended to turn his wife

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.900 
first then he intended to turn his wife
Mary<00:00:34.559> into<00:00:34.770> a<00:00:34.890> vampire<00:00:35.070> but<00:00:35.550> he<00:00:35.640> sort<00:00:35.820> of

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
Mary into a vampire but he sort of

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.639 
Mary into a vampire but he sort of
 that<00:00:36.270> out<00:00:36.480> but<00:00:36.719> he<00:00:36.780> had<00:00:37.200> a<00:00:37.230> very<00:00:37.380> stupid

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
 that out but he had a very stupid

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:41.470 
 that out but he had a very stupid
bet<00:00:38.030> not<00:00:39.030> that<00:00:39.149> he<00:00:39.210> was<00:00:39.300> going<00:00:39.480> to<00:00:39.570> bury<00:00:39.750> her<00:00:39.960> so

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:41.480 
bet not that he was going to bury her so

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.090 
bet not that he was going to bury her so
it<00:00:42.480> it<00:00:42.840> doesn't<00:00:43.140> make<00:00:43.350> a<00:00:43.410> whole<00:00:43.590> lot<00:00:43.649> of<00:00:43.800> sense

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
it it doesn't make a whole lot of sense

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.770 
it it doesn't make a whole lot of sense
when<00:00:44.190> you<00:00:44.370> consider<00:00:44.670> it<00:00:44.850> in<00:00:44.969> any<00:00:45.180> way<00:00:45.480> shape

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
when you consider it in any way shape

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.200 
when you consider it in any way shape
size<00:00:46.020> or<00:00:46.079> form<00:00:46.530> yes<00:00:46.800> next<00:00:47.129> was<00:00:47.250> Henry<00:00:47.520> I<00:00:50.120> had<00:00:51.120> to

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
size or form yes next was Henry I had to

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.549 
size or form yes next was Henry I had to
clear<00:00:51.360> my<00:00:51.449> throat<00:00:51.480> there<00:00:51.780> that<00:00:51.960> we<00:00:52.140> can't

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
clear my throat there that we can't

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.500 
clear my throat there that we can't
and<00:00:52.710> lastly<00:00:53.370> was<00:00:53.610> anyone<00:00:54.000> else<00:00:54.030> who<00:00:54.270> happened

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
and lastly was anyone else who happened

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.619 
and lastly was anyone else who happened
to<00:00:54.539> turn<00:00:54.750> up<00:00:54.930> so<00:00:55.260> we<00:00:55.379> get<00:00:56.090> the<00:00:57.090> Tim<00:00:57.239> says<00:00:57.449> so

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
to turn up so we get the Tim says so

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.090 
to turn up so we get the Tim says so
damaged<00:00:57.930> it<00:00:58.050> cannot<00:00:58.199> be<00:00:58.320> read<00:00:58.440> so<00:00:58.620> what<00:00:58.920> he

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
damaged it cannot be read so what he

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.740 
damaged it cannot be read so what he
buggered<00:00:59.579> up<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.879> tombstone<00:01:00.300> after<00:01:00.539> building

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
buggered up the tombstone after building

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.569 
buggered up the tombstone after building
it<00:01:00.930> just<00:01:01.109> if<00:01:01.739> they<00:01:01.829> could've<00:01:02.039> just<00:01:02.070> put<00:01:02.250> any

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
it just if they could've just put any

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:03.979

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
had to have it make no sense so we can

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.429 
had to have it make no sense so we can
climb<00:01:08.580> up<00:01:08.640> here<00:01:08.939> now<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:09.150> we<00:01:09.450> can<00:01:09.600> get<00:01:09.840> all<00:01:10.170> the

unbalanced<00:03:23.730> is<00:03:23.790> the<00:03:23.880> game<00:03:24.030> but<00:03:24.570> in<00:03:25.200> our<00:03:25.320> favor

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
unbalanced is the game but in our favor

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.039 
unbalanced is the game but in our favor
so<00:03:25.739> we<00:03:26.070> like<00:03:26.250> it<00:03:26.459> there's<00:03:27.450> a<00:03:27.510> white<00:03:27.630> duel<00:03:27.840> we

00:03:28.039 --> 00:03:28.049 
so we like it there's a white duel we

00:03:28.049 --> 00:03:30.349 
so we like it there's a white duel we
said<00:03:28.230> at<00:03:28.290> this<00:03:28.380> point<00:03:28.440> yes<00:03:28.769> we<00:03:28.890> will<00:03:29.040> know<00:03:29.820> I've

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:30.359 
said at this point yes we will know I've

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:31.809 
said at this point yes we will know I've
been<00:03:30.480> thinking<00:03:30.690> about<00:03:30.720> Cornell<00:03:31.200> a<00:03:31.260> little

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:31.819 
been thinking about Cornell a little

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:34.880 
been thinking about Cornell a little
from<00:03:32.819> his<00:03:33.030> Kos<00:03:33.269> 2064<00:03:33.900> appearance<00:03:34.350> and<00:03:34.620> I

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
from his Kos 2064 appearance and I

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.190 
from his Kos 2064 appearance and I
figure<00:03:35.160> out<00:03:35.220> maybe<00:03:35.670> one<00:03:36.090> of<00:03:36.120> the<00:03:36.630> werewolf

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
figure out maybe one of the werewolf

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.660 
figure out maybe one of the werewolf
form<00:03:37.350> is<00:03:37.410> quite<00:03:37.680> as<00:03:37.829> overpowered<00:03:38.310> as<00:03:38.430> it<00:03:38.519> is

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
form is quite as overpowered as it is

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:40.670 
form is quite as overpowered as it is
I'm<00:03:39.450> guessing<00:03:39.840> that<00:03:39.959> he<00:03:40.170> was<00:03:40.319> originally

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
I'm guessing that he was originally

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:42.500 
I'm guessing that he was originally
intended<00:03:40.980> to<00:03:41.160> be<00:03:41.310> pure<00:03:41.579> melee<00:03:42.000> attacker<00:03:42.359> I

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 
intended to be pure melee attacker I

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.690 
intended to be pure melee attacker I
mean<00:03:42.720> this<00:03:42.900> silly<00:03:43.590> blue<00:03:43.829> thing<00:03:44.069> that<00:03:44.220> we<00:03:44.310> throw

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:44.700 
mean this silly blue thing that we throw

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.640 
mean this silly blue thing that we throw
could<00:03:45.450> sensibly<00:03:45.840> be<00:03:46.079> a<00:03:46.109> trail<00:03:46.410> that's

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
could sensibly be a trail that's

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:47.960 
could sensibly be a trail that's
supposed<00:03:46.950> to<00:03:46.980> represent<00:03:47.130> some<00:03:47.459> sort<00:03:47.639> of<00:03:47.670> -

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
supposed to represent some sort of -

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.840 
supposed to represent some sort of -
punch<00:03:48.359> and<00:03:48.900> when<00:03:49.889> we<00:03:49.980> see<00:03:50.130> him<00:03:50.160> in<00:03:50.400> Castlevania

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:50.850 
punch and when we see him in Castlevania

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.300 
punch and when we see him in Castlevania
64<00:03:51.329> he<00:03:51.510> uses<00:03:51.840> variety<00:03:52.560> and<00:03:52.650> dashing<00:03:52.920> punches

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
64 he uses variety and dashing punches

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.129 
64 he uses variety and dashing punches
and<00:03:53.519> kicks<00:03:54.180> so<00:03:54.450> I<00:03:54.480> would<00:03:54.660> guess<00:03:54.810> that<00:03:54.840> he<00:03:55.049> would

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:55.139 
and kicks so I would guess that he would

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:56.780 
and kicks so I would guess that he would
handle<00:03:55.380> sort<00:03:55.590> of<00:03:55.650> like<00:03:55.799> he<00:03:55.920> was<00:03:55.950> using<00:03:56.160> Ifrit

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
handle sort of like he was using Ifrit

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.990 
handle sort of like he was using Ifrit
don't<00:03:57.120> I<00:03:57.269> cry<00:03:57.480> all<00:03:57.780> the<00:03:57.810> bloody<00:03:58.170> time<00:03:59.000> that

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:00.000 
don't I cry all the bloody time that

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.309 
don't I cry all the bloody time that
would<00:04:00.120> make<00:04:00.239> the<00:04:00.359> wolf<00:04:00.630> we'll<00:04:00.810> make<00:04:00.989> slightly

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:01.319 
would make the wolf we'll make slightly

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:02.509 
would make the wolf we'll make slightly
more<00:04:01.620> sense<00:04:01.920> because<00:04:02.220> if<00:04:02.370> you're<00:04:02.489> only

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
more sense because if you're only

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:04.670 
more sense because if you're only
punching<00:04:03.420> and<00:04:03.540> kicking<00:04:03.569> then<00:04:04.170> you<00:04:04.380> have<00:04:04.530> a<00:04:04.560> bit

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
punching and kicking then you have a bit

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.710 
punching and kicking then you have a bit
of<00:04:04.709> a<00:04:04.799> disadvantage<00:04:05.069> right<00:04:05.489> of<00:04:05.609> that<00:04:05.819> and<00:04:06.150> it

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
of a disadvantage right of that and it

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.020 
of a disadvantage right of that and it
would<00:04:06.930> help<00:04:07.049> you<00:04:07.230> a<00:04:07.290> little<00:04:07.590> but<00:04:08.519> in<00:04:08.760> the<00:04:08.910> end

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
would help you a little but in the end

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.270 
would help you a little but in the end
it<00:04:09.209> seems<00:04:09.480> that<00:04:09.600> they<00:04:09.750> realized<00:04:10.170> that<00:04:10.380> the

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:11.280 
it seems that they realized that the

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.159 
it seems that they realized that the
reason<00:04:11.430> Reinhardt<00:04:11.940> was<00:04:12.030> rubbish<00:04:12.449> that<00:04:12.660> he<00:04:13.049> was

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:13.169 
reason Reinhardt was rubbish that he was

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:14.650 
reason Reinhardt was rubbish that he was
basically<00:04:13.620> a<00:04:13.769> melee<00:04:14.070> attack

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:14.660 
basically a melee attack

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.290 
basically a melee attack
and<00:04:14.840> so<00:04:15.470> they<00:04:16.070> decided<00:04:16.550> that<00:04:16.760> they<00:04:16.940> would<00:04:17.090> give

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:17.300 
and so they decided that they would give

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:18.729 
and so they decided that they would give
him<00:04:17.420> arrange<00:04:17.690> that<00:04:17.840> I<00:04:17.989> cannot<00:04:18.290> do<00:04:18.500> anything

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
him arrange that I cannot do anything

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:20.440 
him arrange that I cannot do anything
about<00:04:18.950> the<00:04:19.130> werewolf<00:04:19.459> form<00:04:19.730> which<00:04:19.940> means<00:04:20.120> that

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:20.450 
about the werewolf form which means that

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:23.020 
about the werewolf form which means that
Cornell<00:04:21.170> is<00:04:21.560> the<00:04:21.770> most<00:04:21.950> powerful<00:04:22.160> player

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
Cornell is the most powerful player

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.880 
Cornell is the most powerful player
character<00:04:23.480> in<00:04:23.860> either<00:04:24.860> game<00:04:26.290> then<00:04:27.290> it's<00:04:27.470> of

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:27.890 
character in either game then it's of

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:29.200 
character in either game then it's of
course<00:04:28.070> the<00:04:28.280> original<00:04:28.370> carry<00:04:28.790> then<00:04:29.120> the

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
course the original carry then the

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:31.960 
course the original carry then the
legacy<00:04:29.510> of<00:04:29.540> darkness<00:04:29.990> carry<00:04:30.340> who<00:04:31.340> is<00:04:31.520> probably

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:31.970 
legacy of darkness carry who is probably

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:34.870 
legacy of darkness carry who is probably
friendly<00:04:32.870> equal<00:04:33.380> with<00:04:33.620> Henry<00:04:34.070> and<00:04:34.340> then<00:04:34.760> you

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
friendly equal with Henry and then you

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.330 
friendly equal with Henry and then you
have<00:04:35.060> either<00:04:35.240> Reinhardt<00:04:36.010> Reinhard<00:04:37.010> in<00:04:37.160> either

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:37.340 
have either Reinhardt Reinhard in either

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:39.940 
have either Reinhardt Reinhard in either
configuration<00:04:38.180> so<00:04:38.750> will<00:04:38.990> now<00:04:39.140> use<00:04:39.350> the<00:04:39.560> save

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:39.950 
configuration so will now use the save

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:41.770 
configuration so will now use the save
gem<00:04:40.400> and<00:04:40.760> then<00:04:41.060> we<00:04:41.150> will<00:04:41.240> make<00:04:41.420> our<00:04:41.540> way<00:04:41.570> down

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
gem and then we will make our way down

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.150 
gem and then we will make our way down
to<00:04:41.900> the<00:04:41.990> unbelievably<00:04:42.620> threatening<00:04:43.100> a

to the unbelievably threatening a
difficult<00:04:43.670> boss<00:04:43.850> fight<00:04:44.090> to<00:04:44.210> get<00:04:44.300> it<00:04:44.420> sealed

difficult boss fight to get it sealed

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:46.240 
difficult boss fight to get it sealed
arise<00:04:44.870> we<00:04:45.170> put<00:04:45.410> that<00:04:45.530> in<00:04:45.770> even<00:04:46.010> though<00:04:46.100> it's

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
arise we put that in even though it's

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:47.440 
arise we put that in even though it's
larger<00:04:46.520> than<00:04:46.610> our<00:04:46.670> torso<00:04:47.120> and<00:04:47.240> there's<00:04:47.360> no

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:48.710 
plausible way we could ever have been

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:50.860 
plausible way we could ever have been
carrying<00:04:49.100> it<00:04:49.220> and<00:04:49.760> we<00:04:49.910> head<00:04:50.000> on<00:04:50.030> down<00:04:50.150> so

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 
carrying it and we head on down so

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.500 
carrying it and we head on down so
that's<00:04:51.080> how<00:04:51.230> we<00:04:51.290> open<00:04:51.590> that<00:04:51.620> door<00:04:51.950> you<00:04:52.010> see<00:04:52.510> now

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:53.510 
that's how we open that door you see now

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:54.790 
that's how we open that door you see now
we've<00:04:53.720> answered<00:04:54.020> another<00:04:54.380> one<00:04:54.560> of<00:04:54.650> those

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 
we've answered another one of those

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.170 
we've answered another one of those
mysteries<00:04:55.280> that<00:04:55.370> no<00:04:55.520> one<00:04:55.640> gave<00:04:55.820> a<00:04:55.970> about

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:56.180 
mysteries that no one gave a about

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:57.880 
mysteries that no one gave a about
so<00:04:56.570> here<00:04:56.780> is<00:04:56.900> healed<00:04:57.080> arise<00:04:57.350> he<00:04:57.590> gets<00:04:57.740> no

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:57.890 
so here is healed arise he gets no
