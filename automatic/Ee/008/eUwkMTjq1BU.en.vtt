00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:09.460
 of loja 

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:11.139
 from the zoo of loja where we come to 

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:14.799
 give food as we do all 

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:17.580
 the weeks to the boas constrictor and the 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:17.580
 rainbow weddings 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:24.070
 we are in the serpentarium area in 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:26.740
 where we rent some species 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.560
 especially boa constrictors are 

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:32.140
 he calls you builders because you're 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:34.420
 entangle their prey and in this way they 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.640
 they could not realize these 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.920
 bags are fed very fast when 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.200
 they are hungry of course if not 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:44.830
 wait a moment and during the night in 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:46.480
 special they go and hunt the fish to 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:48.160
 the dam we have them in 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.250
 settlement because a lot of the time 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:53.920
 are brought by people that many of the 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.470
 Sometimes he has bored in his house and 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:57.940
 brings them here it is no longer possible to return them 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:00.490
 to its natural habitat what we 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.560
 Here is your feed and 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:04.780
 we try to keep them in the case of 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.460
 that there is some kind of disease or 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:08.440
 some kind of condition we are of 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.560
 keep them in the best state of health 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:15.040
 these are short, some have been 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:17.080
 attracted by the ministry of 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.450
 environment and others have been donated by 

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.670
 people who already in their house maybe 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.220
 I bought them from some other 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.420
 some other part we have in this in 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:31.710
 this aspect 5 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:34.440
 at a temperature of 25 to 30 degrees 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:38.700
 with a relative humidity of 60 to 70 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:41.520
 degrees centigrade they have their well 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.619
 to perform your bath and a heating 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.000
 that all day helps you because in 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.490
 the city of Loja there are casualties 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.280
 temperatures could be noticed in 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.140
 our zoo we take care of 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.560
 personally to perform this 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:58.020
 feed and we make sure that the 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.539
 animal feed 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:03.299
 and many times the animal leaves the 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:05.759
 dam there we can have problems with the 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.679
 temperature or with the humidity then of 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.019
 this way we correct so that 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:12.720
 can the animal feed itself better 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:15.599
 we invite you to meet them 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:18.989
 this type of snakes that as I already 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:20.819
 I said earlier they are rescued and 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:22.799
 are brought here so there is a better 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:24.750
 benefit and that these species can 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:27.390
 be known and at the same time they can be 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:30.120
 taken care of in this case by us 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.910
 we are the vets good for the 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.769
 people of especially the people who live 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.620
 in the East not or the people who travel 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:39.180
 towards the east a message that no 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.209
 buy this type of animals 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.640
 first he removes them from his 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:47.130
 habitat where it is doing them a lot of damage and 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.860
 they within nature fulfill a 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:52.019
 very important role that is the elimination 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.870
 for example of rodents or birds that 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:57.329
 are causing harm in some kind of 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.280
 This is my message so that 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:00.660
 all those people who traffic and 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.120
 who buy 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.730
 do not do not why this way 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:09.410
 are causing serious ecological damage to 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.410
 what is the environment
