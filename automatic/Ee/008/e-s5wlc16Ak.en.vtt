00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:05.940
 hello girls how are you? I only live by palm and 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.160
 Today I'm going to talk about a subject that 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.160
 a lot of people have doubts right? 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:13.799
 until then giving an answer to our 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:17.279
 friend here facebook is sent that 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.760
 question for us is a problem 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.340
 huh 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.789
 every time she paints her hair 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.010
 they look very golden, not their hair 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.529
 white gold tend to get right 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.960
 why is this happening because the 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.809
 Can not fix people putting a 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.059
 adventure correctly in hair on 105 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.420
 spotted is always missing two colors 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.120
 huh 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:41.280
 white hair he has to have a 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:46.530
 special treatment 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:51.930
 if you, for example, need it 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:55.440
 A color is only for example 6.0 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:58.199
 ninth in the dark is easy, right? 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.780
 you only apply the 6.0 dyer in the 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:05.070
 Hair all is well there 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:12.330
 but if you want to have in aracaju in 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:15.180
 red tile and beige gold 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.520
 You will have problems because not right 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.439
 He'll get it right, he'll stay in the 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.750
 time is very beautiful time is 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.180
 that legal coverage begins to wash 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.100
 starts to play but gets other 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:28.439
 choices where white is for example the 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.960
 red hair where it 's white will stay 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.780
 nervous do not look cool it gets weird 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.360
 but as I do not want to count my hair 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.790
 he is white he is quite white but I 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.049
 I want red I like red 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.930
 I do not want to have it painted in color 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.579
 natural, that's my pleasure, I want 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.420
 red we'll do it 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:50.070
 so we'll have to understand now 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.869
 how does the percentage of 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.840
 white hair right 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.820
 but I do have some hair 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.210
 the white 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:01.280
 How about a little bit, what do you do? 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:04.700
 difference in time i step dye 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:07.040
 always those little hooks are not 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.630
 so I want to paint from 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:12.170
 chocolate for example has a color 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:15.290
 fantasy every time it occurs puts you in the 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.300
 chocolate coloration in white hair a 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.820
 My children, my little ones, come back to 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.830
 appear after other weeks because 

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:25.430
 because we have to use the pigments 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:29.020
 natural and photo you want the color 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.020
 fantasy, we'll do it then. 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:34.850
 let's assume that I have 10 percent of 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:38.680
 white hair 7 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:41.930
 I did not get this just with little tits. 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:46.580
 But it's easy, we'll get it. 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:50.060
 it was 10% natural but as I know 10% 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:52.070
 I have 10 percent advanced 10% from 80% 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.810
 white 80% and white in natural color 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:03:00.769
 because it is natural, more or less, the 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:10.690
 time of the right ink bath goes like 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:17.200
 if it were here 100% - here in 10 to 10 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:19.870
 I found here a little bit of natural paint 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:23.420
 then you'll put the rest 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:26.780
 would be the remaining 90% you would put 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:28.190
 in the color you proposed that you want the 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.470
 your hair 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.840
 Another example to be easier for a 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:37.790
 good hair and a white boy with hair 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:41.570
 80% white hair right we will 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:45.110
 to make people use 80 percent of 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:49.459
 natural care is the same tone people 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:52.010
 if it's you 're wanting to put brown 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:55.430
 Of course you will use the natural pigment 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:57.240
 light brown which is 5.0 and then 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:01.680
 fifth contagion you cause a month 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:04.680
 top with five points on both the a7 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:07.770
 as if it were a simple chocolate spot 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.600
 was red but the tone height would be 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:12.480
 15 How are we talking now in the 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:16.350
 moment this example is the same is the same 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:18.959
 base is even color tone height 

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:21.840
 He gave then pretends to understand 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:26.970
 Ours is 80% white hair but 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:30.240
 drizzle has dreams of black right the 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:34.500
 coloring your normal your pigment goes 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:37.680
 use 80% of ink will be left only the two of us 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:40.310
 and only give it here and with the paint that you 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:43.020
 either causes the red fell another 8 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:46.260
 you will use what the rest would be 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:50.700
 20 percent and fantasy 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:53.660
 there is in this mixture will apply in the hair 

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:56.880
 it's going to proceed like a normal attitude 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:58.410
 then year but then whenever I 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:02.820
 You want to dye your hair now needs 

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:06.510
 two distinct goes if you want a 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:07.740
 Fancy color do not want natural color in 

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:10.350
 tables 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:14.490
 You will not need to always try two 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:16.590
 hands but the good of it is that you never 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:18.900
 will use 100% of each 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:21.210
 if you have 50% white hair it is 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:26.460
 most take care of customers usually 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:30.030
 have 50% on an average and will not use 5150 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:33.030
 another another month over 5150 other 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:35.100
 so I ended up not liking it very much but the 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:37.170
 It matters to us here to hit the 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:39.350
 I can keep a cool thing in the 

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:43.920
 hair 

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:47.610
 I hope it's clear, it 's just you. 

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:49.830
 understand people how much hair day 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:51.870
 white can we keep counting 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:53.490
 drizzle drizzle mandate for us 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:56.490
 has a general more or less when it is 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:59.070
 much how little is a whole head 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:02.190
 white 100% white right 

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:03.900
 hence it is only the natural pigments that can 

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:05.760
 help is good 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:10.490
 I hope you have enjoyed my 

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:10.490
 explanation kiss and see you next time
