 how are you guys today we are going to talk about 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:20.660
 my experience when changing ios android 

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:23.410
 again some time ago I used what I 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:28.400
 that was android at the beginning I started with 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:32.480
 21.6 and well now in node 3 we are 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:35.070
 using android kelvin in version 4.3 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.050
 Y 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.680
 I have not done so much what is my 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.840
 iphone but if the the ecosystem of 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.130
 applications maybe not in variety but 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:47.680
 yes in quality 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:49.750
 it has not complicated me much I have now 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.760
 most of the applications that 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:56.110
 previously used in what is 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:57.790
 android but the quality here is to that 

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:01.180
 feeling that the interface of 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:04.269
 Ios 7 user can not be bought with 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:06.909
 with android maybe 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:10.500
 personally clear giving my point of 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:10.500
 sight and well 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.400
 well mainly so far what 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.580
 more me 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:22.700
 it has brought me some difficulties 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:25.310
 been recorded on the desk as 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:28.160
 I did with reflector but I've done it well 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:32.990
 solved with one with one 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:34.580
 application that is called scr pro that we 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:38.940
 allows you to record the desktop 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:42.390
 directly from the terminal and well 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:44.190
 right now I'm editing it with the 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.990
 screen flow 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.990
 and is such 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:55.770
 If it's a big change, it's also not 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:58.470
 radical personally because he had 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.090
 used the android ecosystem 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:04.689
 previously but 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:07.019
 and the reason why I decided 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:11.470
 change the iphone5 by the three not 

00:02:07.019 --> 00:02:15.520
 screen populates mainly because 

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:18.100
 the iphone5 was a bit small 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.670
 and to take more advantage of what is 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:23.520
 multimedia youtube 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:26.190
 and it made me a little more comfortable what 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:29.430
 which is the other in terms of fluidity of the 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:33.400
 system I can tell you that android in 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:36.920
 in a high-end device 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:40.459
 it performs correctly 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.930
 you get to notice sometimes weird 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:44.599
 a little bit of the guide 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:47.239
 maybe it's because of the layer of 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:50.900
 customization that includes lanotte that 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:54.799
 it's samsung's own that these tweets 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:57.340
 and well so far I think I'm 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:03:01.030
 according to the change it is true that 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:05.440
 strange ios 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:08.890
 and I hope that the future iphone has a 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:11.740
 little more than screen size and 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.590
 wellness up to this moment what are 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:17.440
 the experiences that I would like 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:22.319
