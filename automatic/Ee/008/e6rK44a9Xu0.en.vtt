to<00:02:03.810> have<00:02:03.990> of<00:02:04.290> course<00:02:04.320> is<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:05.280> used<00:02:05.520> screen

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
to have of course is the used screen

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.920 
to have of course is the used screen
right<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.869> screen<00:02:07.200> that<00:02:07.409> has<00:02:07.590> been

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
right the screen that has been

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:09.960 
right the screen that has been
used<00:02:08.080> to<00:02:08.259> print<00:02:08.560> and<00:02:08.800> it's<00:02:09.250> been<00:02:09.460> reclaimed

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
used to print and it's been reclaimed

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.270 
used to print and it's been reclaimed
and<00:02:10.330> like<00:02:11.290> this<00:02:11.470> one<00:02:11.620> needs<00:02:11.830> a<00:02:11.920> little<00:02:12.040> bit

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
and like this one needs a little bit

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.640 
and like this one needs a little bit
more<00:02:12.340> cleaning<00:02:12.940> but<00:02:13.290> something<00:02:14.290> like<00:02:14.470> this

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
more cleaning but something like this

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.010 
more cleaning but something like this
it's<00:02:14.920> been<00:02:15.100> used<00:02:15.400> it's<00:02:15.820> it's<00:02:16.150> it's<00:02:16.540> an<00:02:16.690> old

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
it's been used it's it's it's an old

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.640 
it's been used it's it's it's an old
mesh<00:02:17.440> okay<00:02:18.220> this<00:02:18.700> is<00:02:18.880> something<00:02:19.330> that<00:02:19.650> we're

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
mesh okay this is something that we're

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.490 
mesh okay this is something that we're
going<00:02:20.920> to<00:02:21.040> reuse<00:02:21.330> to<00:02:22.330> make<00:02:22.510> shirts<00:02:22.960> again

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
going to reuse to make shirts again

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.860 
going to reuse to make shirts again
alright<00:02:24.010> so<00:02:24.459> there<00:02:25.000> are<00:02:25.120> two<00:02:25.330> types<00:02:25.630> of

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
alright so there are two types of

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.680 
alright so there are two types of
screens<00:02:26.230> the<00:02:26.770> brand<00:02:27.070> new<00:02:27.310> screen<00:02:27.730> and<00:02:27.970> the

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
screens the brand new screen and the

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.420 
screens the brand new screen and the
screen<00:02:28.840> that<00:02:29.230> we're<00:02:29.410> going<00:02:29.530> to<00:02:29.590> reuse<00:02:29.800> the

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
screen that we're going to reuse the

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.530 
screen that we're going to reuse the
used<00:02:30.850> screen<00:02:31.540> okay<00:02:32.290> so<00:02:32.400> the<00:02:33.400> reason<00:02:33.580> why<00:02:34.060> mesh

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
used screen okay so the reason why mesh

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.570 
used screen okay so the reason why mesh
preparation<00:02:35.350> is<00:02:35.470> so<00:02:35.650> important<00:02:36.220> and<00:02:36.370> the

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:36.580 
preparation is so important and the

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.730 
preparation is so important and the
reason<00:02:36.910> why<00:02:37.120> it's<00:02:37.780> important<00:02:38.350> to<00:02:38.410> note<00:02:38.709> that

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.740 
reason why it's important to note that

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:40.740 
reason why it's important to note that
there<00:02:39.130> are<00:02:39.160> really<00:02:39.430> two<00:02:39.580> different<00:02:40.180> types<00:02:40.420> is

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
there are really two different types is

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:43.860 
there are really two different types is
because<00:02:41.610> whether<00:02:42.610> or<00:02:42.820> not<00:02:43.000> you<00:02:43.360> get<00:02:43.570> through

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
because whether or not you get through

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.350 
because whether or not you get through
the<00:02:44.020> washout<00:02:44.530> phase<00:02:44.890> of<00:02:45.250> you<00:02:45.730> know<00:02:45.850> washing

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
the washout phase of you know washing

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.440 
the washout phase of you know washing
out<00:02:46.510> the<00:02:46.660> stencil<00:02:47.140> on<00:02:47.200> the<00:02:47.230> washout<00:02:47.739> booth<00:02:48.040> if

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
out the stencil on the washout booth if

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.900 
out the stencil on the washout booth if
the<00:02:49.450> mesh<00:02:49.690> hasn't<00:02:50.170> been<00:02:50.290> prepared<00:02:50.470> properly

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
the mesh hasn't been prepared properly

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.550 
the mesh hasn't been prepared properly
the<00:02:51.910> emulsion<00:02:52.450> is<00:02:52.750> not<00:02:52.989> going<00:02:53.200> to<00:02:53.260> want<00:02:53.410> to

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
the emulsion is not going to want to

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.920 
the emulsion is not going to want to
stay<00:02:53.830> adhere<00:02:54.459> to<00:02:54.640> the<00:02:54.730> mesh<00:02:54.940> even<00:02:55.510> if<00:02:55.600> you<00:02:55.720> got

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930 
stay adhere to the mesh even if you got

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:58.050 
stay adhere to the mesh even if you got
off<00:02:56.110> a<00:02:56.140> good<00:02:56.260> burn<00:02:56.680> okay<00:02:57.250> with<00:02:57.580> detail<00:02:58.030> and

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
off a good burn okay with detail and

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.690 
off a good burn okay with detail and
everything<00:02:58.630> you<00:02:59.230> can<00:02:59.410> have<00:02:59.620> poor<00:03:00.070> mesh

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
everything you can have poor mesh

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.570 
everything you can have poor mesh
adhesion<00:03:01.300> which<00:03:01.570> means<00:03:01.870> the<00:03:02.380> emulsion<00:03:03.040> can

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
adhesion which means the emulsion can

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.170 
adhesion which means the emulsion can
peel<00:03:04.180> off<00:03:04.480> or<00:03:04.890> come<00:03:05.890> away<00:03:06.160> from<00:03:06.489> the<00:03:06.640> mesh<00:03:06.850> at

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
peel off or come away from the mesh at

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.570 
peel off or come away from the mesh at
several<00:03:07.989> different<00:03:08.020> points<00:03:08.860> along<00:03:09.070> the

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
several different points along the

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.070 
several different points along the
process<00:03:09.790> it<00:03:10.239> could<00:03:10.330> happen<00:03:10.780> when<00:03:10.930> you're

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
process it could happen when you're

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.650 
process it could happen when you're
washing<00:03:11.290> it<00:03:11.590> out<00:03:11.739> meaning<00:03:12.070> maybe<00:03:12.730> you<00:03:13.390> bring

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:13.660 
washing it out meaning maybe you bring

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:15.570 
washing it out meaning maybe you bring
the<00:03:13.840> screen<00:03:14.140> from<00:03:14.410> the<00:03:14.500> exposure<00:03:14.890> table<00:03:15.400> you

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
the screen from the exposure table you

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.360 
the screen from the exposure table you
put<00:03:15.790> it<00:03:15.880> in<00:03:16.030> the<00:03:16.299> washout<00:03:16.750> booth<00:03:17.019> and<00:03:17.350> you<00:03:18.130> wash

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
put it in the washout booth and you wash

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.509 
put it in the washout booth and you wash
it<00:03:18.670> out<00:03:18.790> and<00:03:19.120> you<00:03:19.510> get<00:03:19.810> all<00:03:20.080> you<00:03:21.070> know<00:03:21.100> you<00:03:21.250> get

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 
it out and you get all you know you get

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:22.800 
it out and you get all you know you get
your<00:03:21.700> stencil<00:03:22.090> out<00:03:22.209> but<00:03:22.450> maybe<00:03:22.600> you're

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
your stencil out but maybe you're

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.930 
your stencil out but maybe you're
working<00:03:23.019> a<00:03:23.260> small<00:03:23.560> area<00:03:23.920> with<00:03:24.070> detail<00:03:24.519> and<00:03:24.820> as

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
working a small area with detail and as

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.550 
working a small area with detail and as
you<00:03:25.120> work<00:03:25.330> all<00:03:25.660> of<00:03:25.750> a<00:03:25.810> sudden<00:03:26.170> some<00:03:26.410> of<00:03:26.440> the

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
you work all of a sudden some of the

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.670 
you work all of a sudden some of the
fine<00:03:26.830> areas<00:03:27.790> of<00:03:27.940> your<00:03:28.060> stencil<00:03:28.360> pull<00:03:29.230> up<00:03:29.440> and

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
fine areas of your stencil pull up and

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.039 
fine areas of your stencil pull up and
start<00:03:30.100> to<00:03:30.220> flap<00:03:30.489> away<00:03:30.820> from<00:03:31.090> the<00:03:31.209> mesh<00:03:31.450> okay

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.049 
start to flap away from the mesh okay

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:36.210 
start to flap away from the mesh okay
that's<00:03:32.620> poor<00:03:33.660> emulsion<00:03:34.660> to<00:03:34.810> mesh<00:03:35.110> adhesion<00:03:35.920> so

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
that's poor emulsion to mesh adhesion so

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.280 
that's poor emulsion to mesh adhesion so
what<00:03:36.760> you<00:03:36.910> need<00:03:37.060> to<00:03:37.120> do<00:03:37.450> is<00:03:37.780> make<00:03:38.049> sure<00:03:38.080> that

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
what you need to do is make sure that

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.250 
what you need to do is make sure that
the<00:03:38.560> mesh<00:03:38.799> is<00:03:39.070> prepared<00:03:39.640> properly<00:03:40.390> so<00:03:41.080> that

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
the mesh is prepared properly so that

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:42.900 
the mesh is prepared properly so that
the<00:03:41.380> emulsion<00:03:41.680> will<00:03:42.040> want<00:03:42.250> to<00:03:42.340> stick<00:03:42.580> to<00:03:42.760> it

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
the emulsion will want to stick to it

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.120 
the emulsion will want to stick to it
and<00:03:43.030> that<00:03:43.780> means<00:03:44.049> we<00:03:44.230> have<00:03:44.260> to<00:03:44.470> consider<00:03:44.799> what

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
and that means we have to consider what

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.039 
and that means we have to consider what
screen<00:03:45.549> are<00:03:45.700> we<00:03:45.820> working<00:03:46.209> with<00:03:46.239> what's<00:03:46.690> what's

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:47.049 
screen are we working with what's what's

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:49.229 
screen are we working with what's what's
going<00:03:47.350> on<00:03:47.470> right<00:03:47.739> so<00:03:48.010> the<00:03:48.400> first<00:03:48.670> one<00:03:48.940> is<00:03:48.970> the

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
going on right so the first one is the

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:51.300 
going on right so the first one is the
brand-new<00:03:49.690> screen<00:03:50.170> this<00:03:50.650> is<00:03:50.709> a<00:03:50.829> brand<00:03:51.160> new

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
brand-new screen this is a brand new

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.789 
brand-new screen this is a brand new
screen<00:03:51.700> it's<00:03:51.880> never<00:03:52.239> been<00:03:52.480> used<00:03:52.720> before<00:03:52.870> okay

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:53.799 
screen it's never been used before okay

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:57.180 
screen it's never been used before okay
so<00:03:53.860> when<00:03:54.670> we<00:03:54.820> go<00:03:55.090> to<00:03:55.780> put<00:03:55.930> this<00:03:56.140> in<00:03:56.470> the<00:03:56.709> washout

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:57.190 
so when we go to put this in the washout

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.509 
so when we go to put this in the washout
booth<00:03:57.519> and<00:03:57.820> prep<00:03:58.660> that<00:03:58.900> screen<00:03:59.410> for<00:03:59.950> usage

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
booth and prep that screen for usage

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:03.150 
booth and prep that screen for usage
what<00:04:01.060> you<00:04:01.209> want<00:04:01.420> to<00:04:01.540> do<00:04:01.720> is<00:04:01.930> abrade<00:04:02.410> the<00:04:02.890> mesh

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160 
what you want to do is abrade the mesh

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
what you want to do is abrade the mesh
okay<00:04:04.030> now<00:04:04.630> what<00:04:05.440> that<00:04:05.470> means<00:04:05.650> is<00:04:06.310> you've<00:04:06.910> got

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:07.180 
okay now what that means is you've got

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:08.970 
okay now what that means is you've got
to<00:04:07.390> rough<00:04:07.690> up<00:04:07.900> the<00:04:08.140> mesh<00:04:08.350> a<00:04:08.380> little<00:04:08.860> bit

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:08.980 
to rough up the mesh a little bit

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:10.110 
to rough up the mesh a little bit
because<00:04:09.190> it's<00:04:09.489> brand-new

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
because it's brand-new

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.650 
because it's brand-new
polyester<00:04:11.250> threads<00:04:12.250> or<00:04:12.610> fibers<00:04:13.180> and<00:04:13.420> they're

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:13.660 
polyester threads or fibers and they're

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.840 
polyester threads or fibers and they're
slick<00:04:14.110> so<00:04:14.769> the<00:04:14.890> emulsion<00:04:15.190> doesn't<00:04:15.700> really

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:15.850 
slick so the emulsion doesn't really

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:17.710 
slick so the emulsion doesn't really
have<00:04:16.090> a<00:04:16.120> place<00:04:16.239> to<00:04:16.690> bite<00:04:16.959> onto

00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:17.720 
have a place to bite onto

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.410 
have a place to bite onto
the<00:04:18.110> threats<00:04:18.470> so<00:04:19.100> what<00:04:19.400> we<00:04:19.519> do<00:04:19.700> is<00:04:19.910> normally

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:20.420 
the threats so what we do is normally

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:22.300 
the threats so what we do is normally
there'll<00:04:20.900> be<00:04:20.959> a<00:04:21.110> product<00:04:21.500> you<00:04:21.890> know<00:04:22.010> you<00:04:22.070> have

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
there'll be a product you know you have

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.100 
there'll be a product you know you have
a<00:04:22.370> screen<00:04:22.700> printing<00:04:23.060> product<00:04:23.540> that<00:04:23.990> you're

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
a screen printing product that you're

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:25.270 
a screen printing product that you're
going<00:04:24.140> to<00:04:24.290> use<00:04:24.470> as<00:04:24.710> part<00:04:24.920> of<00:04:25.010> your<00:04:25.100> mass

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
going to use as part of your mass

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.820 
going to use as part of your mass
preparation<00:04:26.030> process<00:04:26.540> that<00:04:26.780> will<00:04:26.990> slightly

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
preparation process that will slightly

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.820 
preparation process that will slightly
abrade<00:04:28.520> the<00:04:28.550> mesh<00:04:29.000> and<00:04:29.330> it<00:04:29.810> is<00:04:30.020> recommended

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.830 
abrade the mesh and it is recommended

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.860 
abrade the mesh and it is recommended
that<00:04:30.860> you<00:04:31.010> use<00:04:31.160> a<00:04:31.340> mesh<00:04:31.700> of<00:04:31.850> braider<00:04:32.150> for

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
that you use a mesh of braider for

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:34.810 
that you use a mesh of braider for
screen<00:04:33.380> printing<00:04:33.410> because<00:04:34.160> the<00:04:34.310> particle

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
screen printing because the particle

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.810 
screen printing because the particle
size<00:04:35.090> of<00:04:35.390> the<00:04:35.450> abrasive<00:04:35.720> in<00:04:36.320> there<00:04:36.620> is<00:04:36.820> small

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
size of the abrasive in there is small

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.030 
size of the abrasive in there is small
enough<00:04:37.970> that<00:04:38.300> it<00:04:38.390> won't<00:04:38.510> damage<00:04:38.840> the<00:04:39.200> mesh<00:04:39.410> but

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:40.040 
enough that it won't damage the mesh but

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.010 
enough that it won't damage the mesh but
it<00:04:40.160> allows<00:04:40.430> for<00:04:40.760> the<00:04:40.850> emulsion<00:04:41.090> to<00:04:41.360> grab<00:04:41.570> to<00:04:41.870> it

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:42.020 
it allows for the emulsion to grab to it

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:44.380 
it allows for the emulsion to grab to it
okay<00:04:42.440> so<00:04:42.500> it's<00:04:42.890> really<00:04:43.100> important<00:04:43.760> when

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:44.390 
okay so it's really important when

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:46.840 
okay so it's really important when
you're<00:04:44.600> working<00:04:45.050> on<00:04:45.140> press<00:04:45.560> with<00:04:46.400> the<00:04:46.550> screen

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:00.680 
and with the ink and stuff like that at

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:02.410 
and with the ink and stuff like that at
some<00:05:01.070> point<00:05:01.340> the<00:05:01.490> emulsion<00:05:01.730> may<00:05:02.060> start<00:05:02.390> to

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:02.420 
some point the emulsion may start to

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:05.260 
some point the emulsion may start to
peel<00:05:02.690> off<00:05:02.960> it<00:05:03.260> could<00:05:03.620> wrinkle<00:05:04.160> it<00:05:04.610> could<00:05:04.820> do<00:05:05.000> a

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270 
peel off it could wrinkle it could do a

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:07.120 
peel off it could wrinkle it could do a
lot<00:05:05.510> of<00:05:05.570> weird<00:05:05.840> things<00:05:06.170> when<00:05:06.440> it's<00:05:06.620> not<00:05:06.830> really

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:07.130 
lot of weird things when it's not really

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:11.650 
lot of weird things when it's not really
adhered<00:05:07.970> to<00:05:08.270> the<00:05:08.390> mesh<00:05:08.960> okay<00:05:09.710> so<00:05:10.700> that's<00:05:11.300> why

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:11.660 
adhered to the mesh okay so that's why

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:13.540 
adhered to the mesh okay so that's why
it's<00:05:11.870> important<00:05:12.500> it's<00:05:12.680> really<00:05:12.860> important

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550 
it's important it's really important

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:17.350 
it's important it's really important
okay<00:05:14.180> and<00:05:14.650> the<00:05:15.650> second<00:05:16.130> type<00:05:16.340> okay<00:05:16.910> is<00:05:17.180> the

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.360 
okay and the second type okay is the

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.210 
okay and the second type okay is the
used<00:05:17.600> screen<00:05:18.050> right<00:05:18.470> we<00:05:18.680> said<00:05:18.830> we<00:05:18.980> have<00:05:19.100> the

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:19.220 
used screen right we said we have the

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.520 
used screen right we said we have the
used<00:05:19.460> screen<00:05:19.820> now<00:05:20.210> it's<00:05:20.840> important<00:05:21.470> to

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:21.530 
used screen now it's important to

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:23.980 
used screen now it's important to
prepare<00:05:21.860> this<00:05:22.280> for<00:05:22.550> math<00:05:22.790> um<00:05:23.060> you<00:05:23.780> know<00:05:23.870> the

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:23.990 
prepare this for math um you know the

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:25.990 
prepare this for math um you know the
mulch<00:05:24.200> encoding<00:05:24.710> is<00:05:24.830> well<00:05:24.980> mess<00:05:25.310> prep<00:05:25.610> you<00:05:25.820> got

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.000 
mulch encoding is well mess prep you got

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.080 
mulch encoding is well mess prep you got
a<00:05:26.030> mess<00:05:26.360> prep<00:05:26.630> this<00:05:26.870> too<00:05:27.110> but<00:05:27.770> this<00:05:27.980> one<00:05:28.090> we're

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:29.090 
a mess prep this too but this one we're

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:31.300 
a mess prep this too but this one we're
basically<00:05:29.510> going<00:05:29.810> to<00:05:29.870> use<00:05:30.080> a<00:05:30.110> degreaser<00:05:30.380> okay

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:31.310 
basically going to use a degreaser okay

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:33.159 
basically going to use a degreaser okay
because<00:05:31.490> you<00:05:31.700> know<00:05:31.730> that<00:05:32.090> standard<00:05:32.600> mess<00:05:32.840> prep

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:33.169 
because you know that standard mess prep

00:05:33.169 --> 00:05:36.159 
because you know that standard mess prep
is<00:05:33.380> basically<00:05:34.130> degreasing<00:05:34.910> well<00:05:35.480> with<00:05:36.020> the

00:05:36.159 --> 00:05:36.169 
is basically degreasing well with the

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:38.350 
is basically degreasing well with the
new<00:05:36.350> screen<00:05:36.770> we're<00:05:37.250> going<00:05:37.280> to<00:05:37.430> abrade<00:05:37.940> the

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:38.360 
new screen we're going to abrade the

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:40.090 
new screen we're going to abrade the
mash<00:05:38.810> a<00:05:38.840> little<00:05:39.230> bit<00:05:39.410> and<00:05:39.590> then<00:05:39.860> we're<00:05:40.010> going

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:40.100 
mash a little bit and then we're going

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:41.409 
mash a little bit and then we're going
to<00:05:40.190> decrease<00:05:40.490> it<00:05:40.820> and<00:05:40.850> we're<00:05:41.120> going<00:05:41.240> to<00:05:41.300> rinse

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:41.419 
to decrease it and we're going to rinse
