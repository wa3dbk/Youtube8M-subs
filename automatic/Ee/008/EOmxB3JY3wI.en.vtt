and<00:00:00.089> as<00:00:00.900> you<00:00:01.439> perceive<00:00:01.860> it<00:00:02.070> to<00:00:02.100> be<00:00:02.250> is<00:00:02.700> the<00:00:02.970> way

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120 
and as you perceive it to be is the way

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.990 
and as you perceive it to be is the way
that<00:00:03.389> it<00:00:03.510> is<00:00:03.689> in<00:00:03.990> other<00:00:04.110> words<00:00:04.380> your<00:00:05.160> husband

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:06.000 
that it is in other words your husband

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.110 
that it is in other words your husband
undoubtedly<00:00:06.899> had<00:00:07.740> a<00:00:07.980> different<00:00:08.460> view<00:00:08.700> of<00:00:08.760> the

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
undoubtedly had a different view of the

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.620 
undoubtedly had a different view of the
passing<00:00:09.570> of<00:00:09.660> that<00:00:09.840> same<00:00:10.139> amount<00:00:10.469> of<00:00:10.620> time<00:00:10.830> yes

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:11.630 
passing of that same amount of time yes

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:14.919 
passing of that same amount of time yes
so<00:00:12.630> it<00:00:12.840> isn't<00:00:13.170> that<00:00:13.440> the<00:00:13.860> time<00:00:14.130> actually

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:14.929 
so it isn't that the time actually

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:17.630 
so it isn't that the time actually
changed<00:00:15.929> but<00:00:16.139> your<00:00:16.350> perception<00:00:17.039> of<00:00:17.130> it<00:00:17.340> is

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
changed but your perception of it is

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.540 
changed but your perception of it is
what<00:00:17.880> it<00:00:18.060> is<00:00:18.320> the<00:00:19.320> most<00:00:19.500> significant<00:00:20.369> thing

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
what it is the most significant thing

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.099 
what it is the most significant thing
that<00:00:20.699> we<00:00:20.789> want<00:00:20.970> to<00:00:21.029> say<00:00:21.270> to<00:00:21.330> you<00:00:21.600> and<00:00:21.630> it'll<00:00:21.930> be

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
that we want to say to you and it'll be

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:23.870 
that we want to say to you and it'll be

helpful to everyone who's listening in

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.140 
helpful to everyone who's listening in
is<00:00:24.090> that<00:00:24.660> you<00:00:25.500> had<00:00:25.619> done<00:00:25.740> a<00:00:25.800> good<00:00:26.039> job<00:00:26.099> of<00:00:26.609> pre

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
is that you had done a good job of pre

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.810 
is that you had done a good job of pre
paving<00:00:27.660> and<00:00:27.869> coming<00:00:28.260> into<00:00:28.529> alignment<00:00:28.820> even

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
paving and coming into alignment even

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.080 
paving and coming into alignment even
before<00:00:29.970> you<00:00:30.269> got<00:00:30.480> there<00:00:30.810> so<00:00:31.199> the<00:00:32.090> alignment

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
before you got there so the alignment

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.370 
before you got there so the alignment
was<00:00:33.360> well<00:00:33.660> underway<00:00:34.079> then<00:00:34.739> you<00:00:34.980> had<00:00:35.250> that

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:36.380 
was well underway then you had that

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.280 
was well underway then you had that
momentary<00:00:37.550> upstream<00:00:38.690> experience<00:00:39.690> but<00:00:40.020> all

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
momentary upstream experience but all

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.200 
momentary upstream experience but all
that<00:00:40.320> did<00:00:40.890> in<00:00:41.100> other<00:00:41.250> words<00:00:41.430> as<00:00:41.579> you<00:00:41.730> read<00:00:42.000> the

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
that did in other words as you read the

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.180 
that did in other words as you read the
disclaimer<00:00:42.570> and<00:00:43.020> worried<00:00:43.680> about<00:00:43.860> what<00:00:44.100> they

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
disclaimer and worried about what they

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.459 
disclaimer and worried about what they
were<00:00:44.250> saying<00:00:44.640> and<00:00:44.879> gotcha<00:00:45.420> all<00:00:45.660> that<00:00:46.020> happened

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
were saying and gotcha all that happened

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.440 
were saying and gotcha all that happened
is<00:00:46.710> because<00:00:47.160> you<00:00:47.489> had<00:00:47.610> gotten<00:00:47.820> yourself

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
is because you had gotten yourself

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.959 
is because you had gotten yourself
moving<00:00:48.719> so<00:00:49.200> powerfully<00:00:49.770> in<00:00:49.920> your<00:00:50.160> stream<00:00:50.520> when

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
moving so powerfully in your stream when

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.910 
moving so powerfully in your stream when
you<00:00:51.059> turn<00:00:51.300> to<00:00:51.480> upstream<00:00:51.840> of<00:00:52.110> course<00:00:52.469> it<00:00:52.739> would

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
you turn to upstream of course it would

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.250 
you turn to upstream of course it would
feel<00:00:53.270> violent<00:00:54.270> in<00:00:54.510> other<00:00:54.660> words<00:00:54.870> that's

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
feel violent in other words that's

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.910 
feel violent in other words that's
logical<00:00:55.980> and<00:00:56.219> then<00:00:56.850> when<00:00:57.120> you<00:00:57.270> SAT<00:00:57.600> and<00:00:57.960> could

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
logical and then when you SAT and could

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.310 
logical and then when you SAT and could
not<00:00:59.100> find<00:00:59.430> a<00:00:59.550> downstream<00:01:00.180> thought<00:01:00.570> you<00:01:01.079> did

that sort of vision experience where

were in that chair in other words your

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.080 
were in that chair in other words your
inner<00:01:51.570> being<00:01:51.810> was<00:01:52.409> the<00:01:52.860> consciousness<00:01:53.820> that

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
inner being was the consciousness that

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.050 
inner being was the consciousness that
was<00:01:54.329> most<00:01:55.110> present<00:01:56.040> as<00:01:56.189> you<00:01:56.460> were<00:01:56.549> having<00:01:56.909> that

experience and that's why well-being was
the<00:02:01.110> dominant<00:02:01.290> experience<00:02:02.070> you<00:02:02.490> can<00:02:02.759> do<00:02:03.000> that

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
the dominant experience you can do that

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.660 
the dominant experience you can do that
under<00:02:03.540> any<00:02:03.659> and<00:02:04.170> all<00:02:04.380> conditions<00:02:05.100> you<00:02:05.280> can<00:02:05.490> do

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
that in arguments with your spouse you

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.729 
that in arguments with your spouse you

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
can do that in discomfort with your work

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.270 
can do that in discomfort with your work
you<00:02:10.979> can<00:02:11.160> do<00:02:11.340> that<00:02:11.489> in<00:02:11.700> litigate

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
you can do that in litigate

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:14.850 
you can do that in litigate
with<00:02:12.580> another<00:02:12.880> but<00:02:13.390> most<00:02:13.690> of<00:02:13.990> you<00:02:14.170> don't<00:02:14.410> do<00:02:14.740> it

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
with another but most of you don't do it

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.500 
with another but most of you don't do it
unless<00:02:15.069> the<00:02:15.430> stakes<00:02:15.700> were<00:02:15.880> high<00:02:16.060> and<00:02:16.300> that's

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:17.699 
unless the stakes were high and that's
the<00:02:16.720> thing<00:02:16.930> that<00:02:16.959> we'd<00:02:17.200> want<00:02:17.230> to<00:02:17.500> talk<00:02:17.680> about

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
the thing that we'd want to talk about

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:20.190 
the thing that we'd want to talk about
here<00:02:18.190> you<00:02:18.790> had<00:02:19.090> deliberately<00:02:19.840> brought

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
here you had deliberately brought

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.050 
here you had deliberately brought
yourself<00:02:20.470> into<00:02:20.980> alignment<00:02:21.280> because<00:02:21.700> it

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
yourself into alignment because it

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.020 
yourself into alignment because it
mattered<00:02:22.600> so<00:02:23.470> perhaps<00:02:24.040> someone<00:02:24.610> should<00:02:24.640> write

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
mattered so perhaps someone should write

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.600 
mattered so perhaps someone should write
a<00:02:25.060> book<00:02:25.150> that<00:02:25.720> says<00:02:26.050> when<00:02:26.709> you<00:02:26.740> care<00:02:27.310> as<00:02:27.580> much

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
a book that says when you care as much

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.910 
a book that says when you care as much
as<00:02:28.120> you<00:02:28.240> do<00:02:28.480> when<00:02:28.780> you're<00:02:28.959> on<00:02:29.140> the<00:02:29.350> brink<00:02:29.500> of<00:02:29.709> a

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.220 
as you do when you're on the brink of a
root<00:02:30.160> canal<00:02:30.459> it<00:02:31.000> will<00:02:31.239> work<00:02:31.390> better<00:02:31.630> for<00:02:32.050> you

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:32.230 
root canal it will work better for you

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.490

in other words if you focus more
powerfully<00:02:36.190> we've<00:02:36.550> been<00:02:36.670> talking<00:02:37.090> about<00:02:37.209> how

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
powerfully we've been talking about how

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:39.660 
powerfully we've been talking about how
if<00:02:37.840> you<00:02:38.230> want<00:02:38.500> something<00:02:38.800> and<00:02:39.100> you<00:02:39.130> allow<00:02:39.459> it

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
if you want something and you allow it

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.010 
if you want something and you allow it
and<00:02:39.730> you<00:02:39.850> want<00:02:40.030> it<00:02:40.209> and<00:02:40.300> you<00:02:40.360> allow<00:02:40.660> it<00:02:40.840> and<00:02:40.900> you

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 
and you want it and you allow it and you

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.780 
and you want it and you allow it and you
want<00:02:41.260> and<00:02:41.530> allow<00:02:41.709> it<00:02:41.739> than<00:02:42.160> it<00:02:42.310> is<00:02:42.489> but

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
want and allow it than it is but

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.000 
want and allow it than it is but
sometimes<00:02:43.300> because<00:02:43.989> you<00:02:44.110> like<00:02:44.320> the<00:02:44.470> drama<00:02:44.739> of

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
sometimes because you like the drama of

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.890 
sometimes because you like the drama of
it<00:02:45.190> you<00:02:45.519> really<00:02:45.820> don't<00:02:46.060> allow<00:02:46.360> it<00:02:46.510> which<00:02:46.660> makes

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
it you really don't allow it which makes

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.540 
it you really don't allow it which makes
you<00:02:47.110> really<00:02:47.410> want<00:02:47.769> it<00:02:47.890> you<00:02:48.010> really<00:02:48.280> don't

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:48.550 
you really want it you really don't

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.400 
you really want it you really don't
allow<00:02:48.820> which<00:02:49.060> makes<00:02:49.300> you<00:02:49.480> really<00:02:49.780> want<00:02:50.110> it<00:02:50.320> and

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
allow which makes you really want it and

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.800 
allow which makes you really want it and
this<00:02:50.890> was<00:02:51.100> a<00:02:51.130> situation<00:02:51.459> where<00:02:52.360> you<00:02:52.600> had

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
this was a situation where you had

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:54.810 
this was a situation where you had

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820 
clearly gotten the energy going you were

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.729 
clearly gotten the energy going you were
only<00:02:55.030> out<00:02:55.180> of<00:02:55.330> alignment<00:02:55.690> a<00:02:56.019> little<00:02:56.290> bit<00:02:56.440> just

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
only out of alignment a little bit just

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:58.920 
only out of alignment a little bit just
enough<00:02:56.890> to<00:02:57.190> feel<00:02:57.400> yourself<00:02:57.910> in<00:02:58.120> it<00:02:58.239> it<00:02:58.569> was<00:02:58.780> the

enough to feel yourself in it it was the

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:01.620 
enough to feel yourself in it it was the
momentum<00:02:59.500> of<00:02:59.650> your<00:02:59.920> pre<00:03:00.220> paving<00:03:00.790> that<00:03:01.269> served

momentum of your pre paving that served

momentum of your pre paving that served
you<00:03:01.900> mostly<00:03:02.410> and<00:03:03.090> your<00:03:04.090> allowance<00:03:04.600> of<00:03:04.840> your

alignment with source that gave you that

blissful experience and you know you

blissful experience and you know you
have<00:03:10.780> really<00:03:11.140> achieved<00:03:11.230> a<00:03:11.890> state<00:03:12.580> of<00:03:12.760> coming

such a powerful point so you want to
