mechanics are now maybe mechanics is
kind<00:00:13.469> of<00:00:13.559> a<00:00:13.590> broad<00:00:13.769> term<00:00:13.830> I<00:00:14.400> don't<00:00:14.549> know

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:14.780 
kind of a broad term I don't know

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.960 
kind of a broad term I don't know
basically<00:00:15.780> just<00:00:16.020> the<00:00:16.199> dice<00:00:16.470> mechanic<00:00:17.039> like

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
basically just the dice mechanic like

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.570 
basically just the dice mechanic like
what<00:00:18.650> what<00:00:19.650> are<00:00:19.740> your<00:00:19.830> favorites<00:00:20.340> what<00:00:20.490> are

what what are your favorites what are

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.800 
what what are your favorites what are
your<00:00:20.699> least<00:00:20.910> favorite<00:00:22.789> probably<00:00:23.789> probably<00:00:24.090> my

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
your least favorite probably probably my

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.099 
your least favorite probably probably my
least<00:00:25.019> favorite<00:00:25.560> I<00:00:25.650> think<00:00:25.890> is<00:00:26.099> the<00:00:26.490> D<00:00:27.109> 100-plus

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
least favorite I think is the D 100-plus

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.099 
least favorite I think is the D 100-plus
skill<00:00:28.590> or<00:00:28.920> plus<00:00:29.160> stat<00:00:29.490> or<00:00:29.880> plus<00:00:30.689> or<00:00:30.810> minus

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.770 
skill or plus stat or plus or minus
difficulty<00:00:31.679> I<00:00:31.969> think<00:00:32.969> that's<00:00:33.090> probably<00:00:33.360> the

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
difficulty I think that's probably the

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.090 
difficulty I think that's probably the
most<00:00:33.960> math<00:00:34.320> intensive<00:00:34.649> best<00:00:35.610> mechanic<00:00:36.030> and

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:37.100 
most math intensive best mechanic and

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.260 
most math intensive best mechanic and
whenever<00:00:38.100> I<00:00:38.219> have<00:00:38.489> a<00:00:38.520> game<00:00:38.760> that<00:00:38.969> has<00:00:39.239> that

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
whenever I have a game that has that

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.959 
whenever I have a game that has that
mechanic<00:00:39.989> I<00:00:40.200> usually<00:00:40.890> try<00:00:41.040> to<00:00:41.100> tweak<00:00:41.430> it<00:00:41.670> or

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
mechanic I usually try to tweak it or

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.209 
mechanic I usually try to tweak it or
I'll<00:00:42.360> divide<00:00:43.079> everything<00:00:43.320> by<00:00:43.440> five<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:44.100> make

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
I'll divide everything by five and make

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.450 
I'll divide everything by five and make
it<00:00:44.340> a<00:00:44.399> d20<00:00:44.700> and<00:00:45.530> and<00:00:46.530> I'd<00:00:46.890> for<00:00:47.219> me<00:00:47.309> I<00:00:47.340> think

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
it a d20 and and I'd for me I think

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.660 
it a d20 and and I'd for me I think
that's<00:00:47.760> my<00:00:47.910> least<00:00:48.090> favorite<00:00:49.190> as<00:00:50.190> far<00:00:50.280> as<00:00:50.520> my

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
that's my least favorite as far as my

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.020 
that's my least favorite as far as my
most<00:00:51.480> favorite<00:00:51.930> I<00:00:52.079> think<00:00:53.010> it's<00:00:53.430> kind<00:00:53.640> of<00:00:53.760> tied

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
most favorite I think it's kind of tied

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.660 
most favorite I think it's kind of tied
it's<00:00:54.449> a<00:00:54.840> I<00:00:55.289> guess<00:00:55.920> you<00:00:56.010> just<00:00:56.219> sum<00:00:56.340> up<00:00:56.370> like<00:00:56.640> a

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
it's a I guess you just sum up like a

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.779 
it's a I guess you just sum up like a
dice<00:00:56.969> pool<00:00:57.210> kind<00:00:58.050> of<00:00:58.109> mechanic<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:58.800> also<00:00:59.609> the

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
dice pool kind of mechanic and also the

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.700 
dice pool kind of mechanic and also the
d100<00:01:00.620> roll<00:01:01.620> under<00:01:02.010> mechanic<00:01:03.290> the<00:01:04.290> dice<00:01:04.500> pool

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
d100 roll under mechanic the dice pool

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.710 
d100 roll under mechanic the dice pool
mechanic<00:01:05.159> would<00:01:05.339> be<00:01:05.489> games<00:01:05.760> like<00:01:06.030> shadow<00:01:06.390> run

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
mechanic would be games like shadow run

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.940 
mechanic would be games like shadow run
or<00:01:08.060> you<00:01:09.060> know<00:01:09.180> world<00:01:09.390> of<00:01:09.479> darkness<00:01:09.830> you<00:01:10.830> know

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
or you know world of darkness you know

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.340 
or you know world of darkness you know
with<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.250> multiple<00:01:11.700> d<00:01:11.970> tens<00:01:12.240> waltz<00:01:12.659> PG<00:01:12.900> sixes

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
with the multiple d tens waltz PG sixes

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.560 
with the multiple d tens waltz PG sixes
and<00:01:13.590> you<00:01:14.460> just<00:01:14.580> look<00:01:14.729> for<00:01:14.909> success<00:01:15.210> numbers

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
and you just look for success numbers

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.380 
and you just look for success numbers
and<00:01:16.790> detective<00:01:17.790> it's<00:01:17.880> like<00:01:18.000> new<00:01:18.180> world

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
and detective it's like new world

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.090 
and detective it's like new world
darkest<00:01:18.780> World<00:01:19.020> War<00:01:19.140> dark<00:01:19.350> world<00:01:19.770> of<00:01:19.920> darkness

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
darkest World War dark world of darkness

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.320 
darkest World War dark world of darkness
it's<00:01:20.369> a<00:01:20.430> little<00:01:20.670> bit<00:01:20.759> different<00:01:21.119> but<00:01:21.210> it's

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
it's a little bit different but it's

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.800 
it's a little bit different but it's
essentially<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:22.049> same<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:23.270> with<00:01:24.270> a<00:01:24.299> d100

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
essentially the same and with a d100

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.520 
essentially the same and with a d100
role<00:01:24.960> wander<00:01:25.259> that's<00:01:25.560> more<00:01:25.979> like<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.280> BRP

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
role wander that's more like the BRP

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.039 
role wander that's more like the BRP
I've<00:01:28.530> also<00:01:28.770> found<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.520> d20<00:01:30.180> roll<00:01:30.540> under<00:01:30.869> is

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
I've also found the d20 roll under is

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.859 
I've also found the d20 roll under is
kind<00:01:31.439> of<00:01:31.500> interesting<00:01:31.710> I<00:01:32.360> noticed<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.450> Dragon

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
kind of interesting I noticed the Dragon

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.230 
kind of interesting I noticed the Dragon
Warriors<00:01:34.229> had<00:01:34.470> that<00:01:34.680> I<00:01:34.860> picked<00:01:35.310> up<00:01:35.430> pick<00:01:36.090> up

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
Warriors had that I picked up pick up

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.880 
Warriors had that I picked up pick up
that<00:01:36.360> game<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:36.869> it's<00:01:37.259> more<00:01:37.380> of<00:01:37.470> an<00:01:37.530> old-school

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
that game and it's more of an old-school

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.480 
that game and it's more of an old-school
game<00:01:38.180> but<00:01:39.180> I<00:01:39.479> I<00:01:40.409> guess<00:01:40.680> if<00:01:40.799> I<00:01:40.860> had<00:01:40.890> to<00:01:41.009> say<00:01:41.220> that

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
game but I I guess if I had to say that

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.609 
game but I I guess if I had to say that
it's<00:01:41.759> pretty<00:01:42.090> simple<00:01:42.270> would<00:01:42.509> be<00:01:42.689> probably<00:01:43.380> die

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
it's pretty simple would be probably die

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.760 
it's pretty simple would be probably die
spools<00:01:43.950> or<00:01:44.280> a<00:01:44.820> rule<00:01:45.270> under<00:01:45.540> mechanic<00:01:45.960> they're

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
spools or a rule under mechanic they're

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.530 
spools or a rule under mechanic they're
the<00:01:46.950> least<00:01:47.159> math<00:01:47.460> intensive<00:01:47.820> and<00:01:48.299> you<00:01:48.360> just

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
the least math intensive and you just

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.870 
the least math intensive and you just
kind<00:01:48.750> of<00:01:48.780> look<00:01:48.930> at<00:01:49.079> them<00:01:49.290> and<00:01:49.530> you<00:01:49.649> have<00:01:49.890> you

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
kind of look at them and you have you

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.219 
kind of look at them and you have you
have<00:01:50.939> your<00:01:51.180> answer<00:01:51.299> you<00:01:51.720> don't<00:01:51.899> have<00:01:52.079> to

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
have your answer you don't have to

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.440 
have your answer you don't have to
really<00:01:52.380> do<00:01:52.590> that<00:01:52.619> much<00:01:52.799> math<00:01:53.130> if<00:01:53.970> any<00:01:54.210> it's

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
really do that much math if any it's

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.450 
really do that much math if any it's
more<00:01:54.659> like<00:01:54.840> comparing<00:01:55.380> numbers<00:01:55.530> you<00:01:55.920> know<00:01:56.040> how

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
more like comparing numbers you know how

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.800 
more like comparing numbers you know how
many<00:01:56.700> numbers<00:01:57.000> do<00:01:57.210> I<00:01:57.270> have<00:01:57.450> that<00:01:57.479> our

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
many numbers do I have that our

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.170 
many numbers do I have that our
successes<00:01:58.140> how<00:01:58.979> many<00:01:59.159> numbers<00:01:59.399> do<00:01:59.520> I<00:01:59.579> have<00:01:59.790> the

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
successes how many numbers do I have the

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
mechanic it's just okay that I roll

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.190

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
quick I like I like mechanics that are

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.650 
quick I like I like mechanics that are
quick<00:02:10.619> and

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
quick and

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.370 
quick and
oh<00:02:11.890> it<00:02:12.890> seems<00:02:13.160> it<00:02:13.820> seems<00:02:13.970> to<00:02:14.180> me<00:02:14.330> with<00:02:15.020> the<00:02:15.200> with

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
oh it seems it seems to me with the with

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.670 
oh it seems it seems to me with the with
the<00:02:15.410> games<00:02:15.650> that<00:02:15.740> I've<00:02:15.890> done<00:02:16.130> is<00:02:16.900> the<00:02:17.900> less<00:02:18.200> you

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
the games that I've done is the less you

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.350 
the games that I've done is the less you
can<00:02:19.150> how<00:02:20.150> I<00:02:20.180> say<00:02:20.600> this<00:02:21.730> the<00:02:22.730> less<00:02:22.880> intrusive

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
can how I say this the less intrusive

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.020 
can how I say this the less intrusive
the<00:02:23.990> mechanics<00:02:24.470> are<00:02:24.590> the<00:02:25.160> more<00:02:25.400> I<00:02:25.430> think<00:02:25.880> it

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
the mechanics are the more I think it

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.060 
the mechanics are the more I think it
aids<00:02:26.330> in<00:02:26.720> role-playing<00:02:26.990> actually<00:02:27.620> getting<00:02:27.830> in

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
aids in role-playing actually getting in

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.730 
aids in role-playing actually getting in
character<00:02:28.610> and<00:02:28.990> keeping<00:02:29.990> that<00:02:30.140> immersion

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:30.740 
character and keeping that immersion

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.010 
character and keeping that immersion
that's<00:02:31.220> sort<00:02:31.460> of<00:02:31.520> just<00:02:31.730> washes<00:02:32.210> over<00:02:32.360> you<00:02:32.540> you

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:33.020 
that's sort of just washes over you you

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.680 
that's sort of just washes over you you
know<00:02:33.310> so<00:02:34.310> I<00:02:34.610> don't<00:02:34.880> know<00:02:35.000> let<00:02:35.360> me<00:02:35.390> know<00:02:35.480> what

know so I don't know let me know what
your<00:02:35.780> favorite<00:02:35.810> mechanics<00:02:36.650> are<00:02:37.840> let<00:02:38.840> me<00:02:38.900> know

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
your favorite mechanics are let me know

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:40.960 
your favorite mechanics are let me know
you<00:02:39.110> know<00:02:39.320> if<00:02:39.500> you<00:02:39.620> disagree<00:02:40.340> with<00:02:40.370> what<00:02:40.610> I<00:02:40.730> say

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
you know if you disagree with what I say

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.270 
you know if you disagree with what I say
you<00:02:41.360> know<00:02:41.420> or<00:02:41.840> you<00:02:42.440> have<00:02:42.620> a<00:02:42.650> just<00:02:42.950> a<00:02:43.010> different

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
you know or you have a just a different

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.760 
you know or you have a just a different
opinion<00:02:43.840> I'm<00:02:44.840> all<00:02:44.960> about<00:02:45.080> different<00:02:45.440> opinions

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
opinion I'm all about different opinions

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.280 
opinion I'm all about different opinions
so<00:02:46.220> if<00:02:47.000> you<00:02:47.090> think<00:02:47.150> something's<00:02:47.660> cool<00:02:47.870> some

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
so if you think something's cool some

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.000 
so if you think something's cool some
dice<00:02:48.470> mechanic<00:02:48.860> is<00:02:48.950> sweet<00:02:49.610> I<00:02:50.740> think<00:02:51.740> it<00:02:51.860> might

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
dice mechanic is sweet I think it might

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.620 
dice mechanic is sweet I think it might
be<00:02:52.040> Alternity<00:02:52.880> or<00:02:53.240> I<00:02:53.630> can't<00:02:53.990> say<00:02:54.230> it<00:02:55.630> alternity

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:56.630 
be Alternity or I can't say it alternity

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:57.520 
be Alternity or I can't say it alternity
I<00:02:56.780> think<00:02:56.990> that's<00:02:57.110> the<00:02:57.170> name<00:02:57.200> of<00:02:57.320> the<00:02:57.440> game

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
I think that's the name of the game

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.140 
I think that's the name of the game
where<00:02:57.770> you<00:02:57.830> take<00:02:58.010> a<00:02:58.040> dice<00:02:58.310> and<00:02:58.670> you<00:02:58.730> subtract

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
where you take a dice and you subtract

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.000 
where you take a dice and you subtract
another<00:02:59.360> dice<00:02:59.630> and<00:02:59.900> that's<00:03:00.050> that's<00:03:00.560> it<00:03:00.770> or

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.010 
another dice and that's that's it or

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.520 
another dice and that's that's it or
maybe<00:03:01.190> even<00:03:01.310> like<00:03:02.150> fudge<00:03:02.450> with<00:03:03.080> the<00:03:03.200> pluses

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
maybe even like fudge with the pluses

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.170 
maybe even like fudge with the pluses
and<00:03:03.560> minuses<00:03:04.070> if<00:03:04.580> that<00:03:04.760> might<00:03:05.000> be<00:03:05.090> your

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
and minuses if that might be your

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.430 
and minuses if that might be your
favorite<00:03:05.830> so<00:03:06.830> let<00:03:06.980> me<00:03:07.040> know<00:03:07.190> comment<00:03:08.180> and<00:03:08.600> tell
