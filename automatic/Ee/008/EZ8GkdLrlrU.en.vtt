00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:06.240
 Harley Alonso comes to a new video 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.859
 yes today maybe in one of the 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.820
 last videos addressed sports 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:09.360
 Pictures will definitely be 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.950
 addressed 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.400
 I do not know when this video barely 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.619
 but we are now playing times 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:21.390
 Today we form a 4-3-3 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:26.480
 numero three or no2 i believe only 243 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.480
 Number two team that about you 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:33.270
 He costs less than 20,000 coins 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.140
 thank you very much something between 10 and 20 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.899
 a thousand coins 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.370
 I'll leave you the team then of course 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:39.989
 a description if you rebuild it 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.149
 because some of you want to tell me 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:45.450
 always that you have these silver teams from 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:48.780
 want to see me there for example and 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.190
 can relate to it relatively and then too 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.140
 which do not want to have quite so 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.539
 are expensive and still operated strong 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.280
 and that's exactly what you are looking for 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.600
 because with this team I have all ten 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.879
 actually, that's why I play 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.559
 played with them and I have to 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.149
 admit I was also something about pure 

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.500
 I was not 100 percent sure because 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:07.710
 I think of it I've seen have 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.810
 has rebuilt a bit changed 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.630
 even further personally liked 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.540
 But then I have eight ups now 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.439
 played and I have to say yes I have 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.900
 no livestock lost 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.710
 it was just too well staffed at all 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.420
 position 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.009
 Here we have a look in the gate we have 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.200
 heinz müller because I could also anyone 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.210
 choose a federal silver tray 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.750
 her the complete free choice i like 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:33.390
 simply because we play in 41 so far 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.729
 You liked it but you still can 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.439
 company now created or militia or how 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.840
 still in the stables want to gate 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.479
 Make the design and love the 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.180
 at hannover defense at big both strong 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.490
 both over 70 pace, there is not much 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.439
 to say very very solid on the 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.390
 exception van damme and miguel lopez 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.920
 both van damme is also one 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.020
 Huge might be one of the best 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.520
 in this league which was very technical 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.290
 but unfortunately far left defender 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.930
 nevertheless very good decent 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.149
 tempo mega strong mega tall itself goes 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.850
 praised for me is the 20 to the mega 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:09.929
 great resistance but also big fast 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:12.150
 and right-back you have to say and 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.120
 he does his thing right there, too 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.890
 really great 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.290
 whose defense loses her 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.730
 actually hardly headball duels because no matter 

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.440
 where to flank on the long post 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:25.060
 or short post is inserted in a 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:26.920
 the head he wins in midfield is 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.440
 perhaps optimally's central 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.940
 defensive we can have one though 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:33.760
 I do not like trip in defensive midfield 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:37.360
 he did his thing well had strong 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:39.670
 Fit good shot is relatively strong 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.799
 can win battles that fits 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:45.370
 before that we do not have any cross and 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:47.319
 november and in the housing the two too 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.489
 for the central all three rather 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:50.290
 defensive oriented 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:52.209
 midfielder but that's enough 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:56.530
 from all three also relatively neat 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:58.329
 big with 180 and still fits 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.980
 very competitive so very very so 

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:03.760
 the midfield and the front we have 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:05.440
 then the great striker 15 goals 15 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.540
 have templates in ten games right 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.010
 how brilliant with a bomb shot and 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.500
 on the left we have the hidden champion 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:13.810
 I already have service bakeries aco 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:15.849
 times in the video before you showed 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.790
 that the storm is really outstanding 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:21.220
 well how can win header games 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:24.250
 he can shoot dribble recognized 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.299
 everything is running fast now 180 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.040
 only big but a very good one 

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:28.900
 Leaping power of an emotional many 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.510
 head duels then you have just like 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:33.639
 Jimmy says he's right with that 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.410
 very good shot also fast and 

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:37.269
 also really strong than he really is 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:40.810
 no weak player in this team 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:42.459
 the now really phenomenal under 80 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.739
 Strength has the only one out a bit 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:47.379
 who for example prib but the rest is 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:50.620
 really it is really fast 

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:53.290
 enough his team is up fast enough 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.639
 most positions van damme is the 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:56.199
 maybe not everybody with that 

00:03:54.639 --> 00:03:57.730
 necessarily cope at first 

00:03:56.199 --> 00:04:00.879
 but i can not say damme's 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.449
 rock solid there's nothing big 

00:04:00.879 --> 00:04:03.879
 gripe 

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:05.769
 He pulls briefly on one of the 

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:07.799
 faster than himself and then 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:10.449
 because also the problem eaten that there 

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:12.489
 someone tries to pass him to nvidia 

00:04:10.449 --> 00:04:13.810
 Praise is quite right or completely 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:15.489
 Timely sensational 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.660
 right-back even great berlin 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:17.829
 forward can play some 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.599
 Goalkeeper maybe already at Sakko 

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:22.090
 I have seen, however 

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:23.450
 all toni sakko tried me too 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:25.520
 to cut in here again but 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:27.410
 only the best and a few freestoß-tor 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.900
 but call him, he also belongs to the 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:33.400
 team and and so I thought then 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:36.560
 also here in any case yes otherwise 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.670
 Zahna and marcelo and does not fit l and 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:39.830
 You can also do marcelo 

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:42.500
 So do not be that anni and 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:45.920
 philippe they are both really big 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:49.070
 both strong both suitcases strong and in front 

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:50.480
 also relatively fast with par 70 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:52.520
 You can not complain about that 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:55.880
 strong home defense especially with 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:57.650
 the tunnel left in front of david prib the 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:59.570
 only where one may not say it 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:01.700
 optimal for his position as one 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:03.860
 a few six as a double page with 

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:05.590
 a job at 4 2 3 1 2 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:08.600
 they have a lot of wallander together 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:12.500
 outstanding as the only six-up 

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:13.370
 the most optimal solution but year is enough 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.350
 completely off 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:17.600
 next to it two gentlemen two 

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:19.880
 Midfielders have rail traffic 

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:21.620
 defend in any case 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:22.880
 can and also no offensive 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:25.100
 Midfielders are you have three 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.500
 Real six to eight in there 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:32.360
 midfield he eighth but also partially 

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:34.250
 6a that's why 6870 midfielder fun and 

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.960
 they are enough for the threesome 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:37.670
 Midfield to form what attacks 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:40.970
 can intercept and then you have with 

00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:43.490
 brilliant or prior and and sakko two 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:45.560
 fast driving outside 80 tempo is enough 

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:48.320
 of course , both with a very complete 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.400
 strong shot and as I said both too 

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:51.200
 I've ever had that shot 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:53.480
 I mentioned that from the outside with the 

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:55.220
 piece so if you left from left 

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:57.140
 and right with the right in the long corner 

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:58.490
 against these balls just always wrong 

00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:02.990
 but he usually did not stay 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:04.760
 chance and therefore perfect actually 

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:06.860
 suitable for this position and zivi of 

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:09.020
 our much as I do not know 

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:10.940
 should object from the railway one 

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:13.190
 but the card from the premier league was 

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:14.600
 ultimately to be ideal for the 

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:16.550
 could also use the cost 

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:19.310
 both believe the same the first bv and 

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:20.990
 the premier league and really what 99 

00:06:19.310 --> 00:06:22.820
 You can also design link with it 

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:25.010
 not matter which visions 

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:27.260
 you can even replace the striker 

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:29.270
 completely so every French silver 

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:31.670
 voice fits into this system 

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:33.500
 otherwise there is not quite that much 

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:35.180
 also change the right wing and the 

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:37.789
 left wing because they complete the 

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:40.759
 You can do the trio in French 

00:06:37.789 --> 00:06:42.350
 select area but yes why should 

00:06:40.759 --> 00:06:44.120
 I'm not exactly on the wheel with me 

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:47.060
 also player it is quite pretty 

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:48.979
 strong the values seen as 15 gates 

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:50.210
 15 templates mostly react 

00:06:48.979 --> 00:06:52.789
 a little more should be like a wrong one 

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:55.220
 new feeling strong distributors as well 

00:06:52.789 --> 00:06:57.020
 he really liked sakko like me 

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:59.630
 said the towering man of this team 

00:06:57.020 --> 00:07:01.639
 but with 26 motors, there are hardly any such 

00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:03.830
 you could come to the fire and burn 

00:07:01.639 --> 00:07:05.780
 I always like that when I am 

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:07.669
 with the player unfortunately no spruces of 

00:07:05.780 --> 00:07:09.889
 Cinemas in this team is the only thing 

00:07:07.669 --> 00:07:11.750
 but a little downside is overall 

00:07:09.889 --> 00:07:13.789
 if your team wanted to what did not you 

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:15.800
 too much costs a lot anyway 

00:07:13.789 --> 00:07:17.300
 strong and with her in any case 

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:19.400
 times the supercup can win and 

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:21.020
 should now if some action 

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:22.430
 then i can get this team 

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:24.080
 recommend it is a description leaves 

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:26.690
 Of course I want to go 

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:29.180
 Of course happy if you see more 

00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:30.470
 do not you want to know that and then have 

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:32.030
 I know the next video again I know 

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:33.380
 also that some of you and yours see 

00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:35.840
 want and gold have to see how I 

00:07:33.380 --> 00:07:38.199
 but you can not do that 

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:38.199
 beautiful
