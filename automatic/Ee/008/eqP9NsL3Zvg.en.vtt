00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.820 
spell out of the terminal so we're
trying<00:03:30.460> to<00:03:30.550> figure<00:03:30.730> out<00:03:31.200> how<00:03:32.200> to<00:03:32.230> put<00:03:32.530> them<00:03:32.680> all

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830 
trying to figure out how to put them all

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.310 
trying to figure out how to put them all
back<00:03:32.860> together<00:03:33.460> and<00:03:33.850> through<00:03:34.720> process<00:03:35.200> of

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:35.320 
back together and through process of

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.690 
back together and through process of
elimination<00:03:35.440> we're<00:03:36.160> trying<00:03:36.370> to<00:03:36.430> figure<00:03:36.670> it

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
elimination we're trying to figure it

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.950 
elimination we're trying to figure it
out<00:03:36.850> but<00:03:37.500> as<00:03:38.500> you<00:03:38.710> can<00:03:38.830> see<00:03:39.010> here<00:03:39.840> we're<00:03:40.840> not

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:40.960 
out but as you can see here we're not

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:46.770 
out but as you can see here we're not
getting<00:03:41.290> too<00:03:41.440> far<00:03:41.650> very<00:03:41.950> fast<00:03:45.450> the<00:03:46.450> barren

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
getting too far very fast the barren

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.560 
getting too far very fast the barren
wires<00:03:46.960> DWR<00:03:47.710> guy<00:03:47.860> was<00:03:47.950> looking<00:03:48.040> at<00:03:48.220> everything

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
wires DWR guy was looking at everything

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:52.860 
wires DWR guy was looking at everything
bass-ackwards<00:03:49.650> kind<00:03:50.650> of<00:03:50.740> like<00:03:51.660> you<00:03:52.660> know<00:03:52.690> a

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:52.870 
bass-ackwards kind of like you know a

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.870 
bass-ackwards kind of like you know a
nice<00:03:53.140> sound<00:03:53.440> system<00:03:53.590> that<00:03:54.510> so<00:03:55.510> now

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
nice sound system that so now

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.330 
nice sound system that so now
calculations<00:03:57.880> are<00:03:58.060> correct

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
calculations are correct

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:05.910 
calculations are correct
everything<00:04:00.790> should<00:04:01.000> work

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:11.649 

yeah<00:04:06.980> another<00:04:07.400> one<00:04:07.749> yeah<00:04:08.749> four<00:04:09.530> ways<00:04:10.659> all
