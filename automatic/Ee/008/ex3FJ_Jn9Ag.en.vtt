00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.119 

so<00:00:00.840> about<00:00:00.960> a<00:00:01.020> week<00:00:01.260> ago<00:00:01.380> I<00:00:01.500> put<00:00:01.740> up<00:00:01.800> a<00:00:01.829> video<00:00:01.949> on

00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:02.129 
so about a week ago I put up a video on

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:04.730 
so about a week ago I put up a video on
the<00:00:02.370> j2m<00:00:02.850> 3<00:00:03.149> were<00:00:03.300> it<00:00:04.110> was<00:00:04.230> my<00:00:04.350> first<00:00:04.589> time

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
the j2m 3 were it was my first time

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.590 
the j2m 3 were it was my first time
playing<00:00:05.040> I<00:00:05.250> didn't<00:00:05.460> have<00:00:05.609> upgraded<00:00:05.850> belts<00:00:06.450> or

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
playing I didn't have upgraded belts or

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.080 
playing I didn't have upgraded belts or
any<00:00:06.720> performance<00:00:07.410> upgrades<00:00:07.799> and<00:00:08.700> I<00:00:08.790> said<00:00:09.000> I

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
any performance upgrades and I said I

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.970 
any performance upgrades and I said I
thought<00:00:09.210> the<00:00:09.330> plane<00:00:09.510> was<00:00:09.540> pretty<00:00:09.990> fair<00:00:10.620> and

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
thought the plane was pretty fair and

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.039 
thought the plane was pretty fair and
they<00:00:11.580> had<00:00:11.730> a<00:00:11.759> good<00:00:11.940> battle<00:00:12.210> rating<00:00:12.660> and<00:00:12.870> a

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
they had a good battle rating and a

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:14.390 
they had a good battle rating and a
bunch<00:00:13.230> of<00:00:13.290> other<00:00:13.410> kind<00:00:13.679> of<00:00:13.710> nonsense<00:00:14.160> things

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
bunch of other kind of nonsense things

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.919 
bunch of other kind of nonsense things
and<00:00:14.639> why<00:00:14.700> people<00:00:15.000> said<00:00:15.150> you<00:00:15.330> don't<00:00:15.450> know<00:00:15.690> and

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
and why people said you don't know and

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.599 
and why people said you don't know and
they<00:00:15.990> point<00:00:16.199> out<00:00:16.289> some<00:00:16.470> bugs<00:00:16.680> was<00:00:16.890> playing<00:00:17.130> and

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
they point out some bugs was playing and

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.900 
they point out some bugs was playing and
holy<00:00:18.480> crap<00:00:18.690> I<00:00:18.869> didn't<00:00:19.230> know<00:00:19.400> so<00:00:20.400> the<00:00:20.730> first

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
holy crap I didn't know so the first

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.130 
holy crap I didn't know so the first
problem<00:00:21.060> I<00:00:21.180> think<00:00:21.359> of<00:00:21.420> this<00:00:21.510> plane<00:00:21.720> is<00:00:21.869> that<00:00:22.020> it

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
problem I think of this plane is that it

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.439 
problem I think of this plane is that it
gets<00:00:22.350> an<00:00:22.560> air<00:00:22.769> spawn<00:00:23.100> every<00:00:23.760> map<00:00:23.939> I<00:00:24.090> played<00:00:24.330> it

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
gets an air spawn every map I played it

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.279 
gets an air spawn every map I played it
on<00:00:25.820> there<00:00:26.820> are<00:00:26.939> a<00:00:26.970> few<00:00:27.240> maps<00:00:27.599> for<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:27.930> Japanese

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
on there are a few maps for the Japanese

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:30.349 
on there are a few maps for the Japanese
who<00:00:28.410> actually<00:00:28.560> get<00:00:28.830> ground<00:00:29.789> spawns<00:00:30.060> with

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
who actually get ground spawns with

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.840 
who actually get ground spawns with
their<00:00:30.570> army<00:00:30.869> planes<00:00:31.109> but<00:00:31.500> I<00:00:31.800> haven't<00:00:32.460> had<00:00:32.700> it

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
their army planes but I haven't had it

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.850 
their army planes but I haven't had it
yet<00:00:32.880> in<00:00:33.059> this<00:00:33.180> plane<00:00:33.390> so<00:00:33.630> I<00:00:34.200> always<00:00:34.440> get<00:00:34.680> this

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
yet in this plane so I always get this

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.650 
yet in this plane so I always get this
lovely<00:00:35.430> air<00:00:35.700> spawn<00:00:35.969> and<00:00:36.180> you<00:00:36.239> can<00:00:36.360> see<00:00:36.450> all<00:00:36.540> the

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
lovely air spawn and you can see all the

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.209 
lovely air spawn and you can see all the
Americans<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.350> British<00:00:37.410> take<00:00:37.800> off<00:00:37.950> over

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
Americans and British take off over

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.970 
Americans and British take off over
there<00:00:38.399> to<00:00:39.120> my<00:00:39.300> left<00:00:39.329> with<00:00:39.899> their<00:00:40.170> ground<00:00:40.739> spawn

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
there to my left with their ground spawn

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.470 
there to my left with their ground spawn
so<00:00:41.250> I<00:00:41.280> immediately<00:00:41.460> have<00:00:41.910> a<00:00:41.940> huge<00:00:42.239> advantage

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
so I immediately have a huge advantage

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.080 
so I immediately have a huge advantage
there<00:00:42.719> plus<00:00:43.440> this<00:00:43.649> thing<00:00:43.710> climbs<00:00:44.399> like<00:00:44.969> the

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
there plus this thing climbs like the

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.299 
there plus this thing climbs like the
dickens<00:00:45.300> it<00:00:46.200> will<00:00:46.440> overheat<00:00:46.920> though<00:00:47.100> if<00:00:47.219> you

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
dickens it will overheat though if you

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.470 
dickens it will overheat though if you
keep<00:00:47.460> it<00:00:47.579> on<00:00:47.640> wet<00:00:47.850> but<00:00:48.030> it<00:00:48.120> doesn't<00:00:48.360> really

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
keep it on wet but it doesn't really

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.270 
keep it on wet but it doesn't really
need<00:00:48.690> it<00:00:48.840> you're<00:00:49.050> always<00:00:49.200> above<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.680> p-51s

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
need it you're always above the p-51s

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.689 
need it you're always above the p-51s
the<00:00:50.489> Bearcats<00:00:50.969> The<00:00:51.600> Tempest<00:00:52.379> I've<00:00:53.129> never<00:00:53.489> been

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
the Bearcats The Tempest I've never been

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.430 
the Bearcats The Tempest I've never been
out<00:00:53.850> climbed<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:54.420> a<00:00:54.449> match<00:00:54.899> per<00:00:55.110> se

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
out climbed to a match per se

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.630 
out climbed to a match per se
I'm<00:00:55.559> not<00:00:55.680> even<00:00:55.829> climbing<00:00:56.070> really<00:00:56.280> well<00:00:56.489> this

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
I'm not even climbing really well this

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.220 
I'm not even climbing really well this
map<00:00:56.850> map<00:00:57.120> I'm<00:00:57.270> actually<00:00:57.570> laying<00:00:57.719> off<00:00:57.899> and<00:00:58.109> take

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
map map I'm actually laying off and take

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.420 
map map I'm actually laying off and take
it<00:00:58.320> easy<00:00:59.059> because<00:01:00.059> it's<00:01:00.899> not<00:01:01.079> worth<00:01:01.230> it<00:01:01.440> every

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
it easy because it's not worth it every

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.149 
it easy because it's not worth it every
time<00:01:02.699> I've<00:01:03.149> actually<00:01:03.449> tried<00:01:03.989> to<00:01:04.199> climb<00:01:04.860> and

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
time I've actually tried to climb and

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.120 
time I've actually tried to climb and
outperform<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:06.090> other<00:01:06.119> team<00:01:06.570> I'm<00:01:06.810> five<00:01:07.740> ten

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
outperform the other team I'm five ten

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.130 
outperform the other team I'm five ten
fifteen<00:01:08.700> thousand<00:01:09.119> feet<00:01:09.270> above<00:01:09.360> them<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:09.810> I

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
fifteen thousand feet above them and I

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.050 
fifteen thousand feet above them and I
don't<00:01:10.320> get<00:01:10.439> any<00:01:10.530> kills<00:01:10.710> so<00:01:11.610> I<00:01:11.640> actually<00:01:11.790> have

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
don't get any kills so I actually have

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.660 
don't get any kills so I actually have
to<00:01:12.150> climb<00:01:12.420> at<00:01:12.630> their<00:01:12.780> level<00:01:13.049> two<00:01:13.860> people

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
to climb at their level two people

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.490 
to climb at their level two people
pointed<00:01:15.000> out<00:01:15.090> that<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.540> flaps<00:01:15.990> on<00:01:16.170> this<00:01:16.290> plane

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
pointed out that the flaps on this plane

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.800 
pointed out that the flaps on this plane
do<00:01:16.650> not<00:01:16.799> break<00:01:17.009> off<00:01:17.220> and<00:01:17.460> I<00:01:17.520> have<00:01:17.909> abused<00:01:18.540> it<00:01:18.689> to

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
do not break off and I have abused it to

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.330 
do not break off and I have abused it to
try<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.049> see<00:01:19.380> if<00:01:19.619> I<00:01:19.740> could<00:01:19.890> ever<00:01:19.979> break<00:01:20.159> him

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
try and see if I could ever break him

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.850 
try and see if I could ever break him
off<00:01:20.520> I<00:01:20.880> pulled<00:01:21.810> eight<00:01:21.960> nine<00:01:22.140> G's<00:01:22.409> three

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
off I pulled eight nine G's three

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.200 
off I pulled eight nine G's three
hundred<00:01:23.130> plus<00:01:23.189> miles<00:01:23.490> an<00:01:23.610> hour<00:01:23.729> I<00:01:23.820> still<00:01:24.060> have

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
hundred plus miles an hour I still have

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.480 
hundred plus miles an hour I still have
broken<00:01:24.509> these<00:01:24.600> flaps<00:01:24.900> off<00:01:25.110> I've<00:01:25.979> noticed<00:01:26.369> that

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
broken these flaps off I've noticed that

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:27.850 
broken these flaps off I've noticed that
with<00:01:26.580> other<00:01:26.729> planes<00:01:26.970> too<00:01:27.210> so<00:01:27.390> it's<00:01:27.509> not<00:01:27.570> just

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
with other planes too so it's not just

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.620 
with other planes too so it's not just
this<00:01:28.860> plane<00:01:29.130> that<00:01:29.159> has<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.670> bug<00:01:29.880> flaps<00:01:30.210> since

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
this plane that has the bug flaps since

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:32.899 
this plane that has the bug flaps since
the<00:01:30.869> patch<00:01:31.369> so<00:01:32.369> you<00:01:32.460> can<00:01:32.549> see<00:01:32.670> there's<00:01:32.850> a

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
the patch so you can see there's a

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.340 
the patch so you can see there's a

Bearcat in front of me last thing I'll
say<00:01:34.380> real<00:01:34.680> quick<00:01:34.890> is<00:01:35.159> I've<00:01:35.549> messed<00:01:35.970> her<00:01:36.090> off

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
say real quick is I've messed her off

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.630

the<00:01:36.270> belts<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.780> belts<00:01:37.770> used<00:01:37.979> on<00:01:38.100> this<00:01:38.189> guy<00:01:38.400> are

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
the belts the belts used on this guy are

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.490 
the belts the belts used on this guy are
obviously<00:01:39.119> the<00:01:39.360> tracer<00:01:39.900> belts<00:01:40.140> which<00:01:40.290> gives

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
obviously the tracer belts which gives

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.690 
obviously the tracer belts which gives
you<00:01:40.590> high<00:01:40.740> explosive<00:01:41.280> I<00:01:41.460> think<00:01:41.610> it's

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
you high explosive I think it's

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.910 
you high explosive I think it's
fragmentation<00:01:42.210> tracer<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:43.530> armor-piercing

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920

Bearcat<00:01:57.750> looks<00:01:57.869> like<00:01:57.960> a<00:01:57.990> zoom<00:01:58.200> climbing<00:01:58.439> so

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
Bearcat looks like a zoom climbing so

00:01:58.619 --> 00:01:59.330

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.190 

all<00:02:34.760> right<00:02:34.880> let's<00:02:35.000> get<00:02:35.090> in<00:02:35.180> behind<00:02:35.330> I'll<00:02:36.050> see

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.200 
all right let's get in behind I'll see

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.780 
all right let's get in behind I'll see
if<00:02:36.410> I<00:02:36.530> want<00:02:36.680> that<00:02:36.830> we're<00:02:37.280> like<00:02:37.400> to<00:02:37.520> kill<00:02:37.670> that

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
if I want that we're like to kill that

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:38.890 
if I want that we're like to kill that
Bearcat<00:02:38.180> cuz<00:02:38.360> it's<00:02:38.480> probably<00:02:38.750> when<00:02:38.840> the

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
Bearcat cuz it's probably when the

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.490 
Bearcat cuz it's probably when the
better<00:02:39.050> planes<00:02:39.350> here<00:02:40.540> might<00:02:41.540> be<00:02:41.690> some<00:02:41.930> Griffon

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
better planes here might be some Griffon

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.180 
better planes here might be some Griffon
spits<00:02:44.080> that<00:02:45.080> bear<00:02:45.230> gets<00:02:45.440> way<00:02:45.620> too<00:02:45.650> low<00:02:45.890> for<00:02:46.070> me

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
spits that bear gets way too low for me

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:51.340 
spits that bear gets way too low for me
now<00:02:46.340> so<00:02:47.240> I<00:02:47.270> have<00:02:47.570> a<00:02:47.600> Spitfire<00:02:50.230> front<00:02:51.230> of<00:02:51.290> me

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:51.350 
now so I have a Spitfire front of me

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.200 
now so I have a Spitfire front of me
let's<00:02:51.500> see<00:02:51.590> if<00:02:51.650> I<00:02:51.710> can<00:02:51.830> hit<00:02:51.950> that<00:02:51.980> p-51<00:02:52.670> achieve

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:53.210 
let's see if I can hit that p-51 achieve

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:54.670 
let's see if I can hit that p-51 achieve
that<00:02:53.360> p-51<00:02:53.840> our<00:02:53.930> Spitfire<00:02:54.290> let's<00:02:54.470> see<00:02:54.560> which

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
that p-51 our Spitfire let's see which

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.640 
that p-51 our Spitfire let's see which
one<00:02:54.890> that<00:02:55.840> Spitfires<00:02:56.840> going<00:02:57.080> whoa<00:02:57.260> so<00:02:57.470> let's

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
one that Spitfires going whoa so let's

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.920 
one that Spitfires going whoa so let's
stay<00:02:57.860> with<00:02:58.460> that<00:02:58.490> p-51<00:02:59.480> right<00:02:59.630> there<00:02:59.810> looks

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
stay with that p-51 right there looks

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.070 
stay with that p-51 right there looks
like<00:03:00.050> he's<00:03:00.200> circling<00:03:00.590> back<00:03:00.920> maybe<00:03:01.900> hope<00:03:02.900> that

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:03.080 
like he's circling back maybe hope that

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.750 
like he's circling back maybe hope that
Spitfire<00:03:03.440> struck<00:03:03.650> from<00:03:03.710> my<00:03:03.830> wing<00:03:03.980> man<00:03:04.160> here<00:03:04.670> we

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:04.760 
Spitfire struck from my wing man here we

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:05.790 
Spitfire struck from my wing man here we
go

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800 
go

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.110 
go
so<00:03:06.800> 400<00:03:07.040> miles<00:03:07.340> an<00:03:07.400> hour<00:03:07.550> I'm<00:03:07.730> able<00:03:07.940> to<00:03:07.970> do<00:03:08.090> a

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
so 400 miles an hour I'm able to do a

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.540 
so 400 miles an hour I'm able to do a
deflection<00:03:08.630> shot<00:03:08.810> and<00:03:09.140> then<00:03:10.010> right<00:03:10.160> back<00:03:10.310> up

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
deflection shot and then right back up

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.470 
deflection shot and then right back up
like<00:03:10.730> nothing<00:03:10.880> this<00:03:11.270> plane<00:03:11.600> just<00:03:13.480> it's

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
like nothing this plane just it's

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:23.440 
like nothing this plane just it's
probably<00:03:14.840> I<00:03:14.870> need<00:03:14.990> some<00:03:15.140> adjustments

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.729 

look<00:03:24.050> at<00:03:24.140> that<00:03:24.230> and<00:03:24.410> two<00:03:25.180> so<00:03:26.200> right<00:03:27.200> there<00:03:27.410> easy

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:27.739 
look at that and two so right there easy

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:28.540 
look at that and two so right there easy
as<00:03:28.190> can<00:03:28.370> be

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:28.550 
as can be

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:31.449 
as can be
I've<00:03:29.349> no<00:03:30.349> no<00:03:30.470> I'm<00:03:30.680> not<00:03:30.860> challenging<00:03:31.130> this

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
I've no no I'm not challenging this

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:32.710 
I've no no I'm not challenging this
point<00:03:31.670> to<00:03:31.760> spatter<00:03:31.970> rating<00:03:32.270> I<00:03:32.390> think<00:03:32.599> it

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:32.720 
point to spatter rating I think it

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.040 
point to spatter rating I think it
should<00:03:32.930> be<00:03:33.080> facing<00:03:33.290> more<00:03:34.630> Bearcats<00:03:35.630> maybe

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:36.050 
should be facing more Bearcats maybe

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:39.220 
should be facing more Bearcats maybe
some<00:03:36.440> Gryphon<00:03:36.800> spits<00:03:37.870> maybe<00:03:38.870> they'll<00:03:39.110> be

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
some Gryphon spits maybe they'll be

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:40.360

want<00:05:42.120> to<00:05:42.180> fly<00:05:42.300> it<00:05:42.419> I<00:05:42.569> want<00:05:42.719> to<00:05:42.779> be<00:05:42.839> good<00:05:42.960> at<00:05:43.110> it

00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:43.699 
want to fly it I want to be good at it

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:46.790 
want to fly it I want to be good at it
why<00:05:44.699> is<00:05:44.759> that<00:05:44.969> poor<00:05:45.180> thing<00:05:45.419> seeing<00:05:45.800> constant

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800 
why is that poor thing seeing constant

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.689 
why is that poor thing seeing constant
maps<00:05:46.949> like<00:05:47.129> this<00:05:49.129> let's<00:05:50.129> see<00:05:50.249> if<00:05:50.339> I<00:05:50.400> can<00:05:50.550> roll

00:05:50.689 --> 00:05:50.699 
maps like this let's see if I can roll

00:05:50.699 --> 00:05:54.519 
maps like this let's see if I can roll
over<00:05:50.990> try<00:05:51.990> to<00:05:52.020> go<00:05:52.199> higher<00:05:52.439> get<00:05:53.159> c12<00:05:53.669> head<00:05:54.060> on<00:05:54.210> me

00:05:54.519 --> 00:05:54.529 
over try to go higher get c12 head on me

00:05:54.529 --> 00:06:00.230 
over try to go higher get c12 head on me
so<00:05:55.529> I'm<00:05:55.830> going<00:05:56.099> way<00:05:56.279> too<00:05:56.339> fast<00:05:56.639> here<00:05:57.229> and<00:05:59.240> I'm

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 
so I'm going way too fast here and I'm

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.209 
so I'm going way too fast here and I'm
not<00:06:00.389> going<00:06:00.539> to<00:06:00.629> continue<00:06:00.779> that<00:06:01.050> churn<00:06:01.319> I'm<00:06:02.039> not

00:06:02.209 --> 00:06:02.219 
not going to continue that churn I'm not

00:06:02.219 --> 00:06:05.929 
not going to continue that churn I'm not
suicidal<00:06:03.800> just<00:06:04.800> like<00:06:04.979> my<00:06:05.189> other<00:06:05.550> teammates

00:06:05.929 --> 00:06:05.939 
suicidal just like my other teammates

00:06:05.939 --> 00:06:08.480 
suicidal just like my other teammates
are<00:06:06.120> on<00:06:06.210> am<00:06:06.300> I'm<00:06:06.389> gonna<00:06:06.509> roll<00:06:06.779> back<00:06:07.370> cut<00:06:08.370> my

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:08.490 
are on am I'm gonna roll back cut my

00:06:12.379 --> 00:06:12.389 
speed down gonna roll let's see if I get

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:15.439 
speed down gonna roll let's see if I get
him<00:06:12.509> right<00:06:12.629> here<00:06:12.870> this<00:06:13.050> looks<00:06:13.259> good<00:06:14.449> he'll

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:15.449 
him right here this looks good he'll

00:06:15.449 --> 00:06:19.790 
him right here this looks good he'll
blacked<00:06:15.659> out<00:06:16.099> right<00:06:17.099> here<00:06:17.219> maybe<00:06:17.599> No<00:06:18.800> well

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:19.800 
blacked out right here maybe No well

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:23.059 
blacked out right here maybe No well
there<00:06:19.919> we<00:06:20.009> go<00:06:20.039> very<00:06:20.939> nice<00:06:21.349> so<00:06:22.349> as<00:06:22.710> you<00:06:22.830> can<00:06:22.919> see

00:06:23.059 --> 00:06:23.069 
there we go very nice so as you can see

00:06:23.069 --> 00:06:26.240 
there we go very nice so as you can see
this<00:06:23.219> thing<00:06:23.569> handles<00:06:24.569> at<00:06:24.810> high<00:06:24.930> speeds<00:06:25.319> pretty

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:26.250 
this thing handles at high speeds pretty

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:27.559 
this thing handles at high speeds pretty
well<00:06:26.399> it<00:06:26.610> still<00:06:26.759> has<00:06:26.909> a<00:06:26.939> little<00:06:27.120> bit<00:06:27.240> of<00:06:27.419> rudder

00:06:27.559 --> 00:06:27.569 
well it still has a little bit of rudder

00:06:27.569 --> 00:06:28.909 
well it still has a little bit of rudder
issue<00:06:27.719> like<00:06:27.960> I<00:06:28.080> mentioned<00:06:28.409> but<00:06:28.500> the<00:06:28.589> more<00:06:28.740> time

00:06:28.909 --> 00:06:28.919 
issue like I mentioned but the more time

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:29.929 
issue like I mentioned but the more time
you<00:06:29.039> fly<00:06:29.189> the<00:06:29.250> more<00:06:29.520> you<00:06:29.639> learn<00:06:29.759> how<00:06:29.909> to

00:06:29.929 --> 00:06:29.939 
you fly the more you learn how to

00:06:29.939 --> 00:06:41.290 
you fly the more you learn how to
compensate<00:06:30.479> for<00:06:30.629> that

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:41.300 

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:43.110
