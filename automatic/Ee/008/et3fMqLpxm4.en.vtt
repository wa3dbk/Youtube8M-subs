00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:05.600
 do not 

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:08.130
 do not 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.050
 one 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.970
 Now everyone is welcome one day 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.559
 more to my channel in this video I'm going to 

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.630
 teach my second proposals for 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.480
 nail designs for this Christmas end 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.720
 of the year of 2012 in this case the design 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.760
 of nails is this is a gradient in tone 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.759
 black and gray with a print too 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.669
 in black this I see it more suitable for 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:32.250
 end of the year but good to like the 

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:34.320
 colors at the end of the video I'm going to 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.239
 leave a link to the latest videos that 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.250
 I have uploaded those related to what is 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:40.830
 the theme of Christmas because with this 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:43.200
 change of youtube because there is someone who does not 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:45.390
 the new videos come out then the 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.070
 I'll leave it at the end of the video so that 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.620
 you can click if you have not seen them 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.450
 still and nothing you like so to speak 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.980
 I'll remind you that here 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.960
 in the information box I'm going to 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.760
 leave the blog post where I will put 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.220
 All products used and more 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.930
 Design photos I will also leave you in 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.690
 the social networks through which you can 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.949
 follow and my discounts and nothing then if 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.040
 you want to see how it is done 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.979
 fixed my hardener and two layers of 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.170
 this silver mars that is mercadona 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.020
 of those who got out to do 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.790
 the craquelure we let it dry very well 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.130
 and now I'm going to arrange to make a 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:26.659
 degraded in black tone and I will use 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:28.819
 this mac from de kiko that is number 275 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:30.909
 for the gradient I will use this 

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:34.479
 makeup sponge 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:37.479
 and a plastic lid or anything 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:39.369
 where to put the tie what I do is 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:41.079
 put a few drops of enamel on the 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:43.959
 cover and with the sponge I will go 

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:46.740
 taking the tapping and downloading 

00:01:43.959 --> 00:01:46.740
 the espresso 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:52.900
 and now I start tapping on the nail 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:55.080
 from the tip of the nail upwards 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.730
 and in my case how do I want to create a 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.490
 degraded that is irregular because I'm going 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:02.910
 moving the sponge to create the drawing 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.910
 what do I want 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:20.299
 Y 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:25.879
 good now that we have our nails 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:28.420
 with the black tips we will soften 

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:30.530
 the cut between black and silver 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.480
 doing the same gradient technique 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.100
 but this time using the same color of 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:38.460
 silver base that was before 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:40.940
 I put a little on silver Mars here in 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:45.590
 the cover and with a piece of sponge 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:48.140
 I'm going to take quantity and I'm going 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.640
 to download products here in the 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.069
 own cover because I do not want that 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:56.170
 paint too much and now I'm going 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:58.690
 these sponges by the edge cited 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.210
 to integrate the reign of a color with 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.220
 the other 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:05.580
 this time to clean me in the 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:08.220
 nails I'm going to use two ways the 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.080
 first is to use a toothpick 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.680
 teeth with a little cotton on the 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.439
 tip 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.359
 as we have already taught other times and 

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:19.349
 I will also use a brush 

00:03:16.359 --> 00:03:21.819
 Special for nail design with acetone 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:24.129
 I'm going to use these two forms because 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:27.069
 in this design we pretty much stained the 

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:29.500
 fingers and the most part to stain the 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:32.219
 fingers I'm going to erase with this and the 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.219
 part of the cuticle 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:51.709
 we could leave it like that already perfectly 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:54.200
 give it a layer of brightness and we'll have 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:57.230
 our nails finished but I for 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:59.150
 a touch more for decoration 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.040
 I'm going to make a small drawing of 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.900
 stamping good last and only 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.540
 is to give a layer of brightness to 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:08.410
 protect the design I will use the 6 bit 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.410
 as usual 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:22.810
 I think you can see it better is that it has 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:25.389
 So much shine that makes me a lot 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.980
 of reflection in the camera but let's 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:28.930
 could hang photos on the blog 

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:30.580
 explaining well all the materials that 

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.680
 I have used 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:35.139
 and I hope you liked it 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:36.490
 an end of years hand up and remember 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:38.110
 that you can follow me on facebook and 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.919
 instagram and see you in the next 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.919
