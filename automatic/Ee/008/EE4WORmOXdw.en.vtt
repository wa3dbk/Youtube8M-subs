00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 because even today's film follows 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:08.700
 karate space nonsense and one 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:11.190
 real jurassic park welcome 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.410
 for the fourth episode film lang on the 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.450
 film factory with your house we start 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.940
 with the filmtips today movies come 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.800
 are very dialogue-intensive and mostly 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.539
 without visual action comes the clear 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.300
 first movie I would like to recommend you 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.640
 This is the debut film of the 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.619
 cult director kevin smith yours 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.900
 maybe as a silent bob fights or 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.809
 as the director of films like dogma 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.550
 chasing amy and red state in principle 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.920
 it's just about a day in the life 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.850
 of two unmotivated mid-twenties 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.100
 slow-moving items 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.920
 the over comics comics and so on 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.079
 speak and that's it very much 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.850
 good movie and block 2 is also very 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.649
 recommended second comes 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.719
 Absolutely classic, too 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.949
 mentioned in my favorite movies 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.600
 the twelve sworn ones of 1957 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:59.489
 Although the published film is almost 60 years old 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.370
 years old but director sidney lumet 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.690
 have a relaxing time here 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.700
 entertaining and challenging work 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.250
 created for eternity the entire 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.740
 movie or at least 99 percent of it 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.930
 play in a single room in the 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.939
 an american jury about one 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.130
 Murder case decides henry fonda has im 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.350
 Contrary to the other jurors doubt 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.360
 The culprit was the young accused 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.770
 and he tries her from his view 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.270
 convincing sounds at first 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.670
 look maybe not so exciting though 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:29.390
 one must have the twelve sworn ones 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.100
 have seen like a real masterpiece 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:34.470
 In 2005 Hard Candy came with Patrick Wilson 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.990
 and ellen page in the main roles in the 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:39.180
 Cinemas are certainly not 100% of the film 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.320
 pure dialog like in clerks or the 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.360
 twelve sworn ones 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.270
 nevertheless, they make up the lion's share of the 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.350
 films and the dialogues are 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.210
 fantastic in particular ellen page 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.520
 I liked a hard candy unbelievable 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.560
 good even as a male viewer 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.840
 the film is incredibly depressing in it 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.090
 is about the teenager haley the 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.880
 Attempts chefs pedophile intentions too 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.460
 apparently tough tobak but a very very 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.799
 good movie 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.900
 Write screenplays is hard very 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:07.760
 very very heavy and accordingly 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.759
 Even the best are flowing 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.380
 again and again mistakes and plateaus of 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.569
 the week we introduce you to such 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.880
 Logic error within famous movie 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:18.800
 actions and ask you 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.959
 your opinion because her is a teenie 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.819
 the pretty brutal of the cobra kai 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:24.920
 is bullied are cobra kai a 

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:28.010
 Karate club led by one 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.050
 unfair merciless bitterness 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.420
 vietnam veteran for you start 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.920
 to a certain miyagi karate 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.470
 learn to fight back and 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.959
 We are just figuring out next 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:40.700
 karate kid but what is the plot at the end 

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:43.100
 the film comes to the big showdown 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.470
 between daniel and the cobra no 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.510
 student johnny and johnny beats 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.730
 always on daniel and that 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.800
 pretty brutal but everything else 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.360
 within the rules for now creates 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.040
 it sometime then in the crane 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.040
 position johnny in the face 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.800
 and wins he gets the cup and is 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.959
 the big hero probably credits but stop 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:05.630
 a few minutes before was in the film 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:08.060
 officially loud and clearly said that 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:10.430
 treads on the face are not allowed 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.200
 and it will lead to disqualification 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.480
 absolutely not explained why 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.030
 main moment in the main fight 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:19.820
 in the main scene of the film like that 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.799
 a clear rule violation tolerated 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:22.610
 what will you think is a fat one 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:24.769
 movie error 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.360
 Did anyone sleep or am I? 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:28.250
 just stupid and do not understand it 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.010
 just write your opinion in 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.209

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.250
 I put my opinion 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:36.019
 personal opinion of which I 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.440
 Do not think that they are many people 

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:38.239
 divide 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.880
 so I have your hate in the beautiful 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:42.079
 Read comments today 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.940
 Breaking Bad I'm Breaking Bad 

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:45.019
 started to look directly as it in 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.370
 the usa appeared 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:48.320
 I have the first two or three 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:49.850
 followed and afterwards for a whole 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.230
 So be really relaxed for one 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:53.090
 or two years not further 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.250
 looked because not action and Lynx like that 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.989
 did not even pack today 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.959
 i pretty bad that breaking bad 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:02.359
 weak starts and only very slowly 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:03.620
 at some point will break 

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:05.390
 Bad then really one of the 

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:07.010
 best series of all times even if I 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:08.660
 find that in season three a very 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.790
 is a very long thirsty stretch and understand 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:13.639
 Do not get me wrong I really like the series 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:16.100
 but because the beginning, I find real 

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:17.750
 not there, what do you think? 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.970
