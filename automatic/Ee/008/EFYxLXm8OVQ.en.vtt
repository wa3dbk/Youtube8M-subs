for<00:03:29.599> me<00:03:29.810> this<00:03:30.019> year<00:03:30.080> I<00:03:30.560> really<00:03:31.160> like<00:03:31.370> the<00:03:31.519> fact

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
for me this year I really like the fact

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:33.729 
for me this year I really like the fact
you<00:03:32.030> get<00:03:32.209> to<00:03:32.330> conduct<00:03:32.660> your<00:03:32.810> own<00:03:32.840> experiments

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:33.739 
you get to conduct your own experiments

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:35.589 
you get to conduct your own experiments
do<00:03:34.160> all<00:03:34.280> your<00:03:34.430> own<00:03:34.580> calculations<00:03:35.300> but<00:03:35.510> you

00:03:35.589 --> 00:03:35.599 
do all your own calculations but you

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:37.059 
do all your own calculations but you
still<00:03:35.900> know<00:03:36.110> that<00:03:36.319> there's<00:03:36.470> that<00:03:36.650> support

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:37.069 
still know that there's that support

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:39.100 
still know that there's that support
there<00:03:37.280> and<00:03:37.489> so<00:03:38.180> if<00:03:38.269> you<00:03:38.330> like<00:03:38.480> a<00:03:38.540> challenge<00:03:38.660> and
