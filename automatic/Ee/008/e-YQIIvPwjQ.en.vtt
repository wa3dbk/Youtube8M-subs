00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 
this is a chestnut stallion who I met in

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.289 
this is a chestnut stallion who I met in
Portugal<00:00:04.230> and<00:00:04.410> he<00:00:05.370> was<00:00:05.549> on<00:00:05.670> his<00:00:05.700> last<00:00:05.970> chance

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
Portugal and he was on his last chance

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:08.270 
Portugal and he was on his last chance
he'd<00:00:06.720> come<00:00:06.899> to<00:00:07.020> this<00:00:07.140> yard<00:00:07.440> because<00:00:07.680> he<00:00:07.890> was<00:00:08.040> so

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
he'd come to this yard because he was so

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.070 
he'd come to this yard because he was so
aggressive<00:00:08.460> and<00:00:09.000> even<00:00:09.599> they<00:00:09.690> wouldn't<00:00:09.900> lead

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
aggressive and even they wouldn't lead

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.540 
aggressive and even they wouldn't lead
him<00:00:10.200> anywhere<00:00:10.469> without<00:00:10.620> a<00:00:10.800> schooling<00:00:11.309> whip

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
him anywhere without a schooling whip

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.209 
him anywhere without a schooling whip
because<00:00:11.730> they<00:00:12.090> tended<00:00:12.660> to<00:00:13.040> be<00:00:14.040> quite

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
because they tended to be quite

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:16.550 
because they tended to be quite
aggressive<00:00:14.370> towards<00:00:14.910> people<00:00:15.299> what<00:00:16.199> I<00:00:16.230> found

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
aggressive towards people what I found

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.980

fascinating<00:00:17.220> about<00:00:18.000> this<00:00:18.300> horse<00:00:18.539> was<00:00:18.810> that

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
fascinating about this horse was that

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.720 
fascinating about this horse was that
despite<00:00:19.320> his<00:00:19.500> history<00:00:19.949> he<00:00:20.310> was<00:00:20.340> still

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
despite his history he was still

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.240 
despite his history he was still
desperate<00:00:21.480> for<00:00:21.630> human<00:00:21.779> interaction<00:00:22.560> and<00:00:22.710> I

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
desperate for human interaction and I

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.920 
desperate for human interaction and I
only<00:00:23.340> went<00:00:23.519> over<00:00:23.820> to<00:00:23.939> his<00:00:24.060> stable<00:00:24.390> because<00:00:24.750> he

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
only went over to his stable because he

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.509 
only went over to his stable because he
was<00:00:25.109> watching<00:00:25.380> me<00:00:25.650> intently<00:00:25.980> when<00:00:26.250> I<00:00:26.310> was

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519

working with another horse on the yard

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:32.930 
working with another horse on the yard
so<00:00:31.019> we<00:00:31.140> didn't<00:00:31.349> film<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.679> first<00:00:32.430> time<00:00:32.730> I<00:00:32.759> went

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
so we didn't film the first time I went

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.819 
so we didn't film the first time I went
over<00:00:33.210> to<00:00:33.360> him<00:00:33.540> but<00:00:33.750> this<00:00:33.989> was<00:00:34.140> the<00:00:34.260> second<00:00:34.680> and

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
over to him but this was the second and

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:36.889 
over to him but this was the second and
you<00:00:34.950> can<00:00:34.980> see<00:00:35.370> that<00:00:35.520> he<00:00:35.700> still<00:00:35.969> his<00:00:36.600> first

00:00:36.889 --> 00:00:36.899 
you can see that he still his first

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.299 
you can see that he still his first
reaction<00:00:37.350> is<00:00:37.469> to<00:00:37.500> go<00:00:37.739> and<00:00:37.829> knit<00:00:38.010> people

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
reaction is to go and knit people

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:44.440 
reaction is to go and knit people
whenever<00:00:38.460> they<00:00:38.760> put<00:00:38.910> their<00:00:39.120> hand<00:00:39.300> up<00:00:41.660> so

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:44.450 
whenever they put their hand up so

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.360 
whenever they put their hand up so

because he was after the interaction he

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.860 
because he was after the interaction he
got<00:00:47.520> a<00:00:47.550> stroke<00:00:47.789> on<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.059> nose<00:00:48.210> for<00:00:48.239> every<00:00:48.660> time
