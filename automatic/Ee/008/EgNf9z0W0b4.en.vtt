their<00:00:36.750> own<00:00:36.780> capacity<00:00:37.769> within<00:00:37.949> themselves

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:45.900 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.040 

I<00:00:47.000> believe<00:00:48.000> that<00:00:48.030> we<00:00:48.420> need<00:00:48.450> to<00:00:48.660> bring<00:00:48.780> passion

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
I believe that we need to bring passion

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.260 
I believe that we need to bring passion
back<00:00:49.410> in<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.680> classroom<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.400> often<00:00:51.240> times

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
back in the classroom and often times

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.880 
back in the classroom and often times
teachers<00:00:51.690> feel<00:00:52.050> that<00:00:52.230> they're<00:00:52.350> teaching<00:00:52.590> to<00:00:52.860> a

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
teachers feel that they're teaching to a

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.160 
teachers feel that they're teaching to a
test<00:00:52.950> and<00:00:53.640> there's<00:00:54.360> nothing<00:00:54.870> better<00:00:55.050> than

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
test and there's nothing better than

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.410 
test and there's nothing better than
discovery<00:00:55.980> when<00:00:56.280> it<00:00:56.430> a<00:00:56.700> young<00:00:56.970> person<00:00:57.300> can

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
discovery when it a young person can

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.290 
discovery when it a young person can
pick<00:00:57.630> up<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:57.840> book<00:00:58.020> and<00:00:58.230> find<00:00:59.040> themselves<00:00:59.310> and

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
pick up a book and find themselves and

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.090 
pick up a book and find themselves and
so<00:01:00.510> with<00:01:00.660> these<00:01:00.750> 12<00:01:01.050> books<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:01.530> me<00:01:01.800> on<00:01:01.980> the

record series i'm hoping that kids find
themselves<00:01:04.800> and<00:01:05.160> teachers<00:01:05.730> are<00:01:05.850> able<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:06.150> ask

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
themselves and teachers are able to ask

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.360 
themselves and teachers are able to ask
provocative<00:01:06.990> questions<00:01:07.380> and<00:01:07.680> there's

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:08.370 
provocative questions and there's

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:10.820 
provocative questions and there's
discussion<00:01:09.090> and<00:01:09.420> there's<00:01:09.930> banter<00:01:10.530> and

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.770 
discussion and there's banter and
there's<00:01:11.550> critical<00:01:11.940> thinking<00:01:12.240> i<00:01:12.420> think<00:01:12.660> that's

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
there's critical thinking i think that's

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.660 
there's critical thinking i think that's
the<00:01:12.930> most<00:01:13.110> important<00:01:13.560> thing<00:01:13.590> that<00:01:13.740> that

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
the most important thing that that

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.340 
the most important thing that that
teachers<00:01:15.030> allow<00:01:15.390> kids<00:01:15.720> to<00:01:15.840> critically<00:01:16.320> think

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
teachers allow kids to critically think

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.650 
teachers allow kids to critically think
and<00:01:16.770> each<00:01:17.460> of<00:01:17.670> these<00:01:17.820> books<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.420> on<00:01:18.540> the

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:18.660 
and each of these books and on the

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.020 
and each of these books and on the
record<00:01:19.040> truly<00:01:20.040> are<00:01:20.130> about<00:01:20.310> getting<00:01:20.700> kids<00:01:20.910> to

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
record truly are about getting kids to

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:28.190 
record truly are about getting kids to
critically<00:01:21.450> think

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.170 

I<00:01:28.259> think<00:01:29.159> what's<00:01:29.280> so<00:01:29.430> exciting<00:01:29.670> about<00:01:29.850> on<00:01:30.060> the

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
I think what's so exciting about on the

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.800 
I think what's so exciting about on the
record<00:01:30.450> is<00:01:30.659> it's<00:01:31.229> truly<00:01:31.710> a<00:01:31.740> complement<00:01:32.340> to<00:01:32.810> the

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
record is it's truly a complement to the

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.810 
record is it's truly a complement to the
curriculum<00:01:34.350> at<00:01:34.590> or<00:01:34.770> it<00:01:34.860> exists<00:01:35.189> in<00:01:35.460> middle

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
curriculum at or it exists in middle

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.749 
curriculum at or it exists in middle
schools<00:01:36.229> it<00:01:37.229> is<00:01:37.560> a<00:01:37.740> building<00:01:38.070> block<00:01:38.219> it's

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
schools it is a building block it's

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.919 
schools it is a building block it's
provocative<00:01:39.420> it's<00:01:40.100> thought-provoking<00:01:41.100> and<00:01:41.929> I

00:01:42.919 --> 00:01:42.929 
provocative it's thought-provoking and I

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:45.289 
provocative it's thought-provoking and I
think<00:01:43.229> it's<00:01:43.350> also<00:01:43.530> phenomenal<00:01:43.860> for<00:01:44.429> teachers

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
think it's also phenomenal for teachers

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.660 
think it's also phenomenal for teachers
who<00:01:45.420> use<00:01:45.479> Allen<00:01:45.960> sustained<00:01:46.289> reading<00:01:46.530> or<00:01:46.920> they

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
who use Allen sustained reading or they

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.639 
who use Allen sustained reading or they
may<00:01:47.819> already<00:01:47.970> have<00:01:48.090> a<00:01:48.240> curriculum<00:01:49.200> throughout

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
may already have a curriculum throughout

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.770 
may already have a curriculum throughout
the<00:01:49.770> year<00:01:50.130> but<00:01:50.729> at<00:01:50.850> any<00:01:50.969> time<00:01:51.240> they<00:01:51.390> can<00:01:51.420> dive

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780

in a classroom inspiration say I too can

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:34.290 
in a classroom inspiration say I too can
overcome<00:02:32.290> any<00:02:32.590> obstacle<00:02:33.130> I<00:02:33.310> too<00:02:33.730> can<00:02:34.209> be

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:34.300 
overcome any obstacle I too can be

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.040 
overcome any obstacle I too can be
anything<00:02:34.690> or<00:02:35.200> go<00:02:35.530> anywhere<00:02:35.560> or<00:02:36.540> be<00:02:37.540> anything<00:02:37.780> I

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
anything or go anywhere or be anything I

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:39.690 
anything or go anywhere or be anything I
choose<00:02:38.290> just<00:02:38.890> like<00:02:39.010> the<00:02:39.130> people<00:02:39.250> I<00:02:39.400> read<00:02:39.610> about

choose just like the people I read about
and<00:02:40.060> so<00:02:40.180> I<00:02:40.239> think<00:02:40.300> that's<00:02:40.480> really<00:02:40.780> exciting

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
and so I think that's really exciting

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:43.410 
and so I think that's really exciting
that<00:02:41.290> these<00:02:42.010> people<00:02:42.160> are<00:02:42.310> real<00:02:42.580> in<00:02:42.970> their

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
that these people are real in their

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.510 
that these people are real in their
tangible<00:02:43.959> and<00:02:44.170> they're<00:02:45.130> very<00:02:45.160> aspirational

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
tangible and they're very aspirational

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:51.790 
tangible and they're very aspirational
for<00:02:46.150> young<00:02:46.239> people<00:02:46.540> look<00:02:46.690> up<00:02:46.810> to
