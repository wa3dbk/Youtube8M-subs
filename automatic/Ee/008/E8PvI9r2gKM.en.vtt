00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
work on the interior first in terms of

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.690

gain<00:01:33.630> that<00:01:33.869> that<00:01:34.320> oval<00:01:34.770> set<00:01:35.070> up<00:01:35.220> and<00:01:35.460> then<00:01:35.549> I'll

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
gain that that oval set up and then I'll

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.450 
gain that that oval set up and then I'll
work<00:01:35.939> later<00:01:36.210> on<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.689> outer<00:01:37.079> rim<00:01:37.439> of<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:37.770> hat

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
work later on the outer rim of the hat

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.840 
work later on the outer rim of the hat
not<00:01:39.299> filing<00:01:39.600> done<00:01:39.810> with<00:01:39.930> my<00:01:40.049> zombie<00:01:40.500> head<00:01:40.850> I'm

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
not filing done with my zombie head I'm

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.969 
not filing done with my zombie head I'm
still<00:01:42.360> trying<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.659> determine<00:01:42.869> like<00:01:43.409> what<00:01:43.770> kind

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
still trying to determine like what kind

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.710 
still trying to determine like what kind
of<00:01:44.009> material<00:01:44.549> to<00:01:44.670> use<00:01:44.700> to<00:01:45.090> build<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.360> Hat<00:01:45.540> and

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
of material to use to build the Hat and

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.660 
of material to use to build the Hat and
so<00:01:45.930> I<00:01:45.960> said<00:01:46.229> I'll<00:01:46.530> just<00:01:46.770> build<00:01:47.159> it<00:01:47.250> out<00:01:47.369> of<00:01:47.399> wood

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
so I said I'll just build it out of wood

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.969 
so I said I'll just build it out of wood
first<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.299> perhaps<00:01:48.659> later<00:01:49.049> on<00:01:49.259> I'll<00:01:49.500> change

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
first and perhaps later on I'll change

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.590 
first and perhaps later on I'll change
it<00:01:50.159> but<00:01:50.310> I<00:01:50.369> actually<00:01:50.520> don't<00:01:50.790> end<00:01:51.030> up<00:01:51.180> changing

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
it but I actually don't end up changing

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.080 
it but I actually don't end up changing
it<00:01:51.840> at<00:01:51.930> all<00:01:52.079> so<00:01:53.070> I<00:01:53.100> make<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.850> rim<00:01:54.000> around

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
it at all so I make the the rim around

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.630 
it at all so I make the the rim around
the<00:01:54.360> head<00:01:54.570> just<00:01:55.170> to<00:01:55.350> get<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.710> the<00:01:56.250> sizing

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
the head just to get the the sizing

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.249

man I am rusty at building like I've

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.750 
man I am rusty at building like I've
been<00:02:01.619> feeling<00:02:01.770> a<00:02:01.920> lot<00:02:02.159> of<00:02:02.340> T<00:02:02.520> of<00:02:02.610> two

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:03.760 
been feeling a lot of T of two

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.030 
been feeling a lot of T of two
I<00:02:03.820> just<00:02:04.540> had<00:02:04.660> a<00:02:04.690> really<00:02:05.020> hard<00:02:05.230> time<00:02:05.530> making

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.040 
I just had a really hard time making

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.400 
I just had a really hard time making
this<00:02:06.250> hat<00:02:06.570> well<00:02:07.570> I<00:02:07.630> think<00:02:07.720> your<00:02:07.930> problem<00:02:08.110> is

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
this hat well I think your problem is

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.040 
this hat well I think your problem is
that<00:02:08.680> Kabul<00:02:09.250> heads<00:02:09.460> aren't<00:02:09.760> square<00:02:10.600> like<00:02:10.869> that

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
that Kabul heads aren't square like that

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.900 
that Kabul heads aren't square like that
like<00:02:11.290> I<00:02:11.500> I<00:02:11.620> don't<00:02:12.100> think<00:02:12.250> they<00:02:12.340> fit<00:02:12.550> nice<00:02:12.760> day

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
like I I don't think they fit nice day

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.300 
like I I don't think they fit nice day
they're<00:02:13.120> more<00:02:13.390> old<00:02:13.570> Lee<00:02:13.870> and<00:02:14.050> so<00:02:14.230> that's<00:02:14.980> sort

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
they're more old Lee and so that's sort

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.240 
they're more old Lee and so that's sort
of<00:02:15.460> why<00:02:15.640> I<00:02:15.670> think<00:02:16.480> my<00:02:17.440> hat<00:02:17.650> looks<00:02:17.800> a<00:02:17.890> little<00:02:18.040> bit

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
of why I think my hat looks a little bit

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.820 
of why I think my hat looks a little bit
better<00:02:18.430> I<00:02:18.810> started<00:02:19.810> with<00:02:19.930> the<00:02:20.020> oval<00:02:20.320> base<00:02:20.530> and

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:20.830 
better I started with the oval base and

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.830 
better I started with the oval base and
it's<00:02:21.190> just<00:02:21.430> easy<00:02:21.610> to<00:02:21.760> stack<00:02:22.180> up<00:02:22.390> and<00:02:22.570> work<00:02:22.690> your

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
it's just easy to stack up and work your

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:25.290 
it's just easy to stack up and work your
way<00:02:22.900> up<00:02:23.020> but<00:02:23.560> yeah<00:02:23.890> I<00:02:24.130> also<00:02:24.280> agree<00:02:24.490> about<00:02:24.760> tf2

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:50.470 
going on random so any mod makers out

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.320 
going on random so any mod makers out
there<00:03:50.530> if<00:03:50.830> you're<00:03:50.980> watching<00:03:51.010> you'd<00:03:52.000> be<00:03:52.150> like

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
back and forth on this for some reason I

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.560 
back and forth on this for some reason I
just<00:04:07.930> don't<00:04:08.769> quite<00:04:09.070> get<00:04:09.340> it<00:04:09.400> right<00:04:09.790> and<00:04:10.060> it

was a really good detail on my part
again<00:04:39.310> you<00:04:39.520> know<00:04:39.610> you<00:04:39.670> might<00:04:39.940> be<00:04:39.970> thinking<00:04:40.210> to

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:40.420 
again you know you might be thinking to

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:42.000 
again you know you might be thinking to
yourself<00:04:40.480> oh<00:04:40.810> yeah<00:04:41.080> that's<00:04:41.320> so<00:04:41.440> obvious<00:04:41.710> you

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.010 
yourself oh yeah that's so obvious you

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:44.040 
yourself oh yeah that's so obvious you
know<00:04:42.340> in<00:04:42.550> that<00:04:42.670> cowboy<00:04:43.060> voice<00:04:43.300> that<00:04:43.570> you<00:04:43.630> might

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:44.050 
know in that cowboy voice that you might

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:46.500 
know in that cowboy voice that you might
have<00:04:44.260> but<00:04:45.040> we<00:04:45.910> don't<00:04:46.090> know<00:04:46.210> what<00:04:46.360> we're

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:46.510 
have but we don't know what we're

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:49.140 
have but we don't know what we're
building<00:04:46.630> so<00:04:47.260> it's<00:04:47.470> really<00:04:47.650> hard<00:04:48.010> to<00:04:48.850> figure

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:49.150 
building so it's really hard to figure

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.260 
building so it's really hard to figure
it<00:04:49.360> out<00:04:49.450> and<00:04:49.780> yeah<00:04:50.290> it's<00:04:50.440> really<00:04:50.650> easy<00:04:50.800> to<00:04:50.860> copy

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:51.270 
it out and yeah it's really easy to copy

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.910 
it out and yeah it's really easy to copy
one<00:04:52.270> of<00:04:52.390> our<00:04:52.510> builds<00:04:52.870> after<00:04:53.230> we<00:04:53.350> do<00:04:53.470> it<00:04:53.650> but<00:04:53.890> if

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:53.920 
one of our builds after we do it but if

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.410 
one of our builds after we do it but if
you're<00:04:54.370> just<00:04:54.610> like<00:04:54.760> yeah<00:04:54.970> you<00:04:55.030> got<00:04:55.210> to<00:04:55.240> build

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:55.420 
you're just like yeah you got to build

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:59.520 
you're just like yeah you got to build
this<00:04:55.540> not<00:04:56.380> so<00:04:56.620> easy<00:04:56.830> so<00:04:57.400> I<00:04:58.060> hope<00:04:58.840> that<00:04:58.930> you<00:04:59.230> guys
