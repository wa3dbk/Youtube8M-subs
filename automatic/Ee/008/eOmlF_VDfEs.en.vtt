is<00:01:19.280> going<00:01:19.430> to<00:01:19.490> download<00:01:19.670> the<00:01:20.119> firmware<00:01:20.659> from

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
is going to download the firmware from

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.260 
is going to download the firmware from
the<00:01:21.350> garment<00:01:21.530> server<00:01:21.979> to<00:01:22.310> your<00:01:22.610> desktop<00:01:22.909> and

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
the garment server to your desktop and

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.500 
the garment server to your desktop and
then<00:01:23.630> transfer<00:01:24.200> that<00:01:24.430> to<00:01:25.430> the<00:01:25.640> device<00:01:25.940> so<00:01:26.330> this

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:26.510 
then transfer that to the device so this

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.740 
then transfer that to the device so this
might<00:01:26.720> take<00:01:26.750> a<00:01:26.900> few<00:01:26.990> minutes<00:01:28.360> so<00:01:29.360> now<00:01:29.479> with

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
might take a few minutes so now with

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.600 
might take a few minutes so now with
that<00:01:30.020> done<00:01:30.320> we<00:01:30.530> can<00:01:30.799> disconnect<00:01:31.189> the<00:01:31.490> device

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
that done we can disconnect the device

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.359 
that done we can disconnect the device
from<00:01:31.970> the<00:01:32.030> computer<00:01:32.570> and<00:01:32.810> we<00:01:33.350> can<00:01:33.380> restart<00:01:33.979> the

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:34.369 
from the computer and we can restart the

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:36.340 
from the computer and we can restart the
GPS<00:01:34.790> so<00:01:34.970> let's<00:01:35.119> flip<00:01:35.210> over<00:01:35.450> and<00:01:35.780> finish<00:01:36.170> the

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
GPS so let's flip over and finish the

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.700 
GPS so let's flip over and finish the
task<00:01:37.150> alright<00:01:38.150> so<00:01:38.299> we<00:01:38.420> can<00:01:38.540> see<00:01:38.689> here<00:01:38.900> that<00:01:39.080> the

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
task alright so we can see here that the

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.200 
task alright so we can see here that the
device<00:01:39.979> turned<00:01:40.280> itself<00:01:40.549> off<00:01:40.790> so<00:01:41.060> we're<00:01:41.180> just

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
device turned itself off so we're just

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.410 
device turned itself off so we're just
going<00:01:41.450> to<00:01:41.510> unplug<00:01:41.780> the<00:01:41.930> USB<00:01:42.110> cable<00:01:42.970> and<00:01:43.970> we'll

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
going to unplug the USB cable and we'll

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:49.149 
going to unplug the USB cable and we'll
restart<00:01:45.170> it<00:01:45.380> and<00:01:47.290> from<00:01:48.290> there<00:01:48.500> we<00:01:48.650> should<00:01:48.710> see

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:49.159 
restart it and from there we should see

00:01:49.159 --> 00:02:04.590 
restart it and from there we should see
the<00:01:49.490> rest<00:01:49.880> of<00:01:50.119> the<00:01:50.240> firmware<00:01:50.659> update<00:01:51.229> process

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.600 

so<00:02:05.230> for<00:02:05.560> a<00:02:05.590> loader<00:02:05.830> and<00:02:06.159> we<00:02:06.250> should<00:02:06.400> see<00:02:06.580> a

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:06.610 
so for a loader and we should see a

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:21.960 
so for a loader and we should see a
progress<00:02:06.909> bar<00:02:07.360> at<00:02:08.170> some<00:02:08.410> point

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:32.350 

and<00:02:22.510> now<00:02:22.720> the<00:02:22.780> system<00:02:23.320> will<00:02:23.620> reboot

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.730 

and<00:02:33.360> there<00:02:33.480> you<00:02:33.570> go<00:02:33.690> we've<00:02:34.110> updated<00:02:34.410> our

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
and there you go we've updated our

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.560 
and there you go we've updated our
firmware<00:02:35.010> successfully<00:02:35.790> and<00:02:36.030> now<00:02:36.150> we<00:02:36.210> can
