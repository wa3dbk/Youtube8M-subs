 and this time we are here to talk about 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.800
 the tops the tops something very important and 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.750
 first of all I want you to leave your 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.210
 like serbian many likes in this video 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.680
 of support and good that you give him to 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.050
 to share what you do as 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.000
 more people better because I'll do a live 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.769
 shortly speaking further of 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.330
 these all where you are we can all 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.609
 share opinions as almost always 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.560
 We do and see more things 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.929
 this is an information video about 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.450
 the tops about when they're supposed to go 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.600
 to come out that are the tops and everything else 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.309
 but if you want us to do a direct 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.710
 with what would come to be the 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.450
 predictions of all the equipment of the 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.210
 year that are all the teams of the 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.250
 year then there are enough likes as it 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.950
 will do so that nothing goes there that are the 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.110
 tops as the tops are like the 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.239
 top and what is the team of the year because 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.110
 two are the team of the season team 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.090
 of decision 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.980
 team of the season the English that is the 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:02.460
 team of the season 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.860
 in Spanish, it's those blue letters 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.710
 similar to the two but with different 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.600
 with a touch there is good yellow according to the 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.850
 royalty they are have one color or another 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.300
 but you'll be seeing how they are 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.460
 in what you have seen the miniature and others 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:23.369
 and as they are right now I am going to leave you 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:26.729
 a capture of a forum that was her 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.830
 he said he answered to this question a water 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.789
 who asked when the 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:34.410
 tops then in the forum of idea of ​​usa 

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:35.970
 he said there could be an error with this 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:38.310
 but that they have thought to do it 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.770
 well and they have thought that the tops come out 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.240
 of the world community tots that are before 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.310
 to leave tweets every day always 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.820
 a team from each major league comes out 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.649
 a team of all comes out so before 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.750
 leave the top of each league they leave 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.640
 ones from the rest of the world to call it 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.890
 well or of the community because those of 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.929
 rest of the world are others who are therefore 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.840
 of players because they are also in 

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:02.880
 the top of which x leagues but not all 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.550
 they will be in each one so to speak 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.860
 the community touch goal 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.900
 they are, because they are all of many gold 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.090
 leagues that have also come out 

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:15.680
 example was speculating that going out to hunt 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:17.640
 that came out of players like that there's also 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.690
 predictions that have been made in the forum 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.490
 of many that it seems that 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.220
 that have come out for example I'm going to 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.480
 put some catch of those who have 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.490
 predicted that they will come out here are you 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.590
 watching a catch are not going to be these 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.910
 but it's so you can see how good it is 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.770
 suppose that they are not going to be these are the 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:37.670
 man divisions they said in the forum 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:38.900
 from there in the USA but that's good 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.200
 they have to be these are a 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:44.540
 prediction just because they are like you see leagues 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:47.360
 European as for example you see you are 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:50.540
 watching here then I ratti and marchisio 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:53.570
 jackson martínez then many players 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:56.090
 here in marcelo are predictions but it is 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:59.060
 so you can see that those who can leave 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:01.880
 in the gold tops of the community 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.500
 they are European leagues that do not all go 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.870
 to go out with these leagues are not all going to 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.920
 have all then then they will put yes 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.270
 who will see then the would be by 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.830
 example although this and marchisio yes that 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:11.480
 will be the bbva league although it is in 

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:15.530
 marcelo but there are other leagues like 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:17.360
 example the Greek league or the Russian league 

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:19.520
 I think that he will not have all of them either and 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.260
 that comes out in this also accompanied by 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.400
 others of strategies like marcelo that 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:27.170
 can be matic and others but they are good 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.240
 are all these are predictions 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.530
 theories that you have about which 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:31.790
 they can be those first all but not 

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:35.989
 there is nothing confirmed from this of what 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:37.160
 it is confirmed it is that Diaz can 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:39.290
 come out that is the only thing he has said to 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.840
 she that I can continue so the day 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:44.870
 6 may the gold ones come out those of 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:46.790
 silver and the bronze community tots that 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:50.150
 they are therefore what of European days 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:53.000
 They may leave on May 6 and 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:54.920
 well this is not 100% confirmed but it is 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.440
 Something he said was that the role was safe 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.900
 they would leave these days on the 6th they knew 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.319
 then then there will be the top of the 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.840
 barclays possibly on May 13 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:07.250
 of good 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:10.190
 then those of the football league tot that 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:13.069
 is those of the second English league that 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:15.140
 they would leave from day 15 to 18 because those of 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:16.220
 the brand and they leave from 13 to 20 so 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:19.820
 while there are those of the barclays 

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:21.229
 would leave for two days these two of 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.790
 the second English football 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:25.460
 readers that tend to be almost always 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:26.750
 of silver and bronze then they start when 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:29.240
 those of the boatman and those of the 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:31.310
 bundesliga as always then the series 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.950
 then the lic 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:35.570
 French and then as always the 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:36.980
 last those in the bbva league because 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:39.590
 tend to be the best ones that come out 

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:41.510
 Christian-Messi and others and then they leave 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.580
 two specials that are usually those of 

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:45.910
 rest of the world the two of the rest of the 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:50.140
 they are from other leagues 

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:52.120
 and also the ace fcc fcc all that 

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:54.940
 last year if I'm not wrong they were 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:57.610
 of a combined of the ms and other leagues 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:05:00.700
 also that they are not European and well that 

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:02.470
 it remains to be seen what they are so 

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:05.170
 this is the only thing we know about the 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:07.180
 tops for now say they have confirmed but 

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:08.740
 yes that is what he said today that we 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:11.620
 let me know this is a video of 

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:13.870
 information that they that I come to you 

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:17.050
 What do you think? 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:19.200
 that that everything is all 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:21.280
 doubts that you have about the tops and others 

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:22.870
 I'm going to leave you here also some 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:25.180
 catches for example last year the 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:27.850
 last year the tops came out on day 23 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:30.280
 April many people said that also 

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:32.110
 They would leave on April 23 this time but now 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:33.940
 you see that not last year they left before 

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:35.770
 that how it was on April 23 because 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:37.480
 there was the world cup and there were letters 

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:40.030
 exclusives of the world cup but this year to 

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:41.680
 not having a world cup nor a eurocopa and nothing 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:43.060
 of selections like this in summer because it's going 

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.370
 to do as the rest of years to our 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:47.050
 steer nothing either then it is supposed 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:49.000
 that will be like the other years because 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:51.820
 from day 6 

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:55.120
 we have here as well as listen 

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:57.040
 of gold predictions here we have one of 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:58.750
 silver are all sorry but they sold in 

00:05:57.040 --> 00:06:01.270
 the forum and so that you can see better 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:02.650
 these are the community tots that we have 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:04.000
 here revive it for example can be 

00:06:02.650 --> 00:06:06.100
 interesting but aníbal everyone would be 

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.170
 a pass also I want you to tell me 

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:09.700
 that if you believe that these all 

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:11.410
 They will all be in the market 

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:14.140
 but because this year with the ranges of 

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:16.570
 price is quite difficult thing and 

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:18.010
 we will see to see if all the truth comes out 

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:20.110
 to the market so I do not expect anything 

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:21.640
 has solved many doubts about the 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:23.980
 tones that a lot of people were asking 

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:25.180
 about what were the touch wanted if they are going to 

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:27.430
 get out then this is what is known of 

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:28.720
 moment and you know if there are many likes 

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:30.070
 all the doubts leave me for the 

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:32.200
 comments everything you want to know 

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:33.520
 about the toyos and I will try to answer 

00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:35.500
 all these years of experience that 

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:37.510
 I have the other ultimate team and everything 

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:39.460
 what has happened to the tops that I will do 

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:42.070
 me when I leave not before doing what is 

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:43.660
 the logical thing was to sell everything for now with 

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:45.700
 the price ranges is not going to 

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:46.990
 change the thing a lot so all the 

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:48.760
 I doubt you have to leave me for the 

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:51.940
 comments and you know there are many likes 

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:53.950
 here I will do a live trying to predict 

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:55.540
 according to my opinions and then try 

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:57.490
 to listen or to try is to say all 

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:58.630
 the samples about the two that can 

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:00.880
 leave so 

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:05.210
 direct to less with more youtubers than 

00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:08.030
 I will invite and in which we will try 

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:10.190
 and say what they are going to be like 

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:12.130
 predictions the top of all the leagues 

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:14.150

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:15.949
