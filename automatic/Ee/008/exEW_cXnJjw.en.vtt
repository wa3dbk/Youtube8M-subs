00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.740
 hi to all the boys and welcome back up 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.720
 those two on the server with a fucking blog 

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.570
 as you like dog 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:11.309
 like it so much lately and we there 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.860
 we give and give them away and separate them from 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:16.020
 wisdom and interculture turn with 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.029
 then they take little time and then who they give 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.189
 the opportunity to investigate certain things 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.470
 that maybe 10 in a superficial way 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.570
 in short, during a review I am 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.760
 nice because they give the opportunity to 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.840
 enter a little deeper than it is 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.899
 we are speaking in the sense that today 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:36.030
 let's delve into the exclusive issue 

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:39.059
 exact in the review on plus tofas 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.460
 we wanted to give the accent 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.489
 on the fact that the exclusives are not a 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.430
 product to make the counterparty drink 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:50.430
 console or pc from the base 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.960
 born to make gamers PCs wee and then 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.480
 the result was to make them 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.160
 rosicare is another matter, however, a 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.980
 play like history because it is born 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.620
 as exclusive because it has been studied and 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.530
 structured for playstation hardware 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.600
 in the sense that we know that on PC it would be 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.670
 gone ten thousand times this better 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.979
 they also know the walls in the walls 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.290
 etc. etc. 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:15.000
 but they had to try to do so 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.110
 optimize that game for the 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.990
 playstation 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.390
 ok that's what they did and we have to say 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.299
 we have to do a round of applause to naughty dog 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.430
 because she managed to squeeze like a 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:30.270
 ripe lemon the hardware of the 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:33.450
 playstation 3 then the exclusives have 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.810
 meaning yes but only if they are of a high standard 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.869
 is accurate in the sense that if you do the 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.689
 play on unity or on a blend I was up 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:46.560
 any graphic engine and decide 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:48.689
 to make it run only on smartphones 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.430
 you will have a limited audience 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.950
 smartphone 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.040
 take unheard because it comes into you 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.040
 mind 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:00.810
 joke that you all know by now 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:03.270
 no the one you find it on everything you do 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.520
 that is, it can but that is also everything 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.750
 you can have in the living room in the studio for 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.459
 everything 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.950
 those, however, what they did if they did 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.269
 they are screwed to do the exclusive 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.599
 also because it will not be cagata 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:16.319
 no exclusive woman in bed 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:19.769
 let's throw it everywhere 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:21.840
 Exactly and they spread the copies of 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:24.330
 this unbeaten around the world 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.280
 earning in my opinion a net of 500 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.099
 euros in all 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.420
 now that is a very long operation 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:32.810
 wrong because you made a game of 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:35.700
 shit and it's also cross-platform 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.739
 the exclusivity gives you the possibility of us 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.269
 we also review the exclusive and pc and le 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:42.540
 exclusives give you the chance to 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:43.620
 to know a priori what the hardware of will be 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.269
 competence 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.010
 now on pc and a little more complex because 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:48.420
 everyone has different hardware but has 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.700
 the exclusive and console 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.860
 they are much much more solid because 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.900
 because you know which hardware while up 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.940
 here there are different bands of different PCs 

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.519
 video cards different types of process 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.709
 there is everything different in children's consoles 

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:02.130
 exclusives are not just stuff 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:05.400
 so 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:08.700
 yes exactly a test on all of them is infamous 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.859
 and consoles we've tested and referred to 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:15.180
 we liked the graphics a lot 

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:17.609
 also being an open world anyway and 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.359
 if we can have the screen many 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:23.459
 elements there are no drops in framerates 

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:25.709
 obvious and indeed the game works a lot 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.540
 well for what it is that can be 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:29.130
 the playstation 4 hardware because like the 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:32.459
 let's put it off of one 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:34.049
 playstation 4 is still low compared 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:36.060
 to the computer of a thousand euros 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:38.190
 yes but with an exclusive with a game 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.260
 studied on that hardware then get 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.389
 the results you will get on a good pc 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.290
 from gaming and this thing is not from 

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:45.239
 underestimate 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:49.079
 the move by Microsoft is terrible 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:51.989
 to put a titan crowd on the old gen 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:54.209
 next gen and also on pc because why a 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:56.340
 Castrated game on all fronts 

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:58.950
 exact and this is the thing 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:03.090
 main that we want them to understand 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:09.030
 if there is a nice game ok that could 

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:09.540
 give so much on console next gen and pc dx 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.930
 January 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:17.400
 because the end does not have a genre the 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:20.579
 let's say pc because bring it back up 

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:22.830
 to an xbox 360 knowing you will 

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:25.590
 use to make it go well on 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:29.460
 360 a graphic engine dating back to ten 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:31.169
 years before and knowing that on pc the 

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:34.139
 result will be that of ten years 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:35.760
 first of all we guys know they are 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:37.440
 we are marketing mechanisms 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.900
 speaking in a small room we are two 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.940
 boys in their thirties dealing 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:45.120
 to make videos so maybe we are not 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:46.440
 in the complex world of marketing though 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.020
 when we see a game that could 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:51.090
 give 10 and from four we don't recognize you 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:54.060
 it's another important thing to 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:57.030
 stress is that indeed if 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:05:01.590
 we also want PCs have exclusives 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:04.289
 we can talk about amd then hardware 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:06.210
 of videos with md and license plates 

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:09.660
 nvidia there was a period of the year 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:12.330
 last succeeded only games were 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:15.389
 optimized to the maximum with envy 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:17.250
 because they ran thanks to the physics e 

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:19.440
 this is a very important thing to 

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:21.570
 say why because there are these 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:23.789
 exclusive in the sense that with a hardware 

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:26.070
 that costs a lot less you run of the 

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:28.110
 young people with another hardware 

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:29.940
 would require an effort 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:33.120
 economic double the largest 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:35.430
 in fact we tested crisis 3 with 

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:38.370
 our nvidia 780 from ios are 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:40.650
 video cards obviously roar game 

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:42.210
 it turns very well but we have remained 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:44.940
 of putty when we tried it on 

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:46.830
 of the mid-range amd and the game 

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:49.440
 the exact same was fine 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:52.380
 let's talk about video cards maybe 

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:55.979
 cost 150 euros and other video cards 

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:58.050
 which cost 600 700 800 however changes 

00:05:55.979 --> 00:06:00.000
 the brand changes the optimization that it is 

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:02.010
 was made because crysis was 

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.100
 optimized for md 

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:05.560
 and here you come back 

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:07.240
 everything comes back it's all a fact is ready 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:08.290
 so guys when you talk about 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:10.720
 exclusive 

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:13.930
 eye because we never talk about a 

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:17.170
 despite what a software house does to you 

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:19.300
 to your friends makes you talk pc games 

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:22.090
 always of mechanisms and which can 

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:25.150
 compromising the quality of the title e 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:26.800
 which therefore must be taken and as such indeed 

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:28.630
 we advise you in buying one 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:30.640
 console in particular is a console 

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:32.590
 old as a playstation 3 of 

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:34.660
 focus on what are 

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:37.380
 exclusive because they are multi-platform 

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:39.940
 play on pc there is no to play on pc 

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:42.370
 concentrated and what planando xbox 

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:44.010
 nintendo wii u rai playstation 3 

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:47.700
 beware of exclusives 

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:47.700
 so you save me
