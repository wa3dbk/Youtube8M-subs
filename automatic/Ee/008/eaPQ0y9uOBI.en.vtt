so<00:00:48.670> next<00:00:48.910> I'm<00:00:49.150> going<00:00:49.180> to<00:00:49.420> show<00:00:49.570> you<00:00:49.600> bias<00:00:50.080> bound

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:50.470 
so next I'm going to show you bias bound

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.760 
so next I'm going to show you bias bound
seems<00:00:50.890> and<00:00:51.310> biased<00:00:52.120> on<00:00:52.300> seams<00:00:52.660> are<00:00:53.110> scenes

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:53.770 
seems and biased on seams are scenes

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:55.980 
seems and biased on seams are scenes
that<00:00:53.890> have<00:00:54.250> been<00:00:54.580> bound<00:00:54.970> with<00:00:55.270> a<00:00:55.300> separate

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:55.990 
that have been bound with a separate

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:58.380 
that have been bound with a separate
piece<00:00:56.440> of<00:00:56.470> fabric<00:00:57.400> that's<00:00:57.760> been<00:00:57.970> cut<00:00:58.210> on<00:00:58.240> the

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:58.390 
piece of fabric that's been cut on the

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:00.300 
piece of fabric that's been cut on the
bias<00:00:58.540> it's<00:00:58.960> it's<00:00:59.170> what's<00:00:59.470> called<00:00:59.680> a<00:00:59.830> bias

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:00.310 
bias it's it's what's called a bias

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.210 
bias it's it's what's called a bias
binding<00:01:00.700> you<00:01:01.150> can<00:01:01.330> buy<00:01:01.650> bias<00:01:02.650> binding<00:01:02.950> in

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:03.220 
binding you can buy bias binding in

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.970 
binding you can buy bias binding in
different<00:01:03.670> sizes<00:01:04.210> it<00:01:04.720> comes<00:01:04.900> in<00:01:05.020> a<00:01:05.050> package<00:01:05.350> in

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:05.980 
different sizes it comes in a package in

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:09.840 
different sizes it comes in a package in
the<00:01:06.160> fabric<00:01:06.460> store<00:01:06.750> so<00:01:07.750> we're<00:01:08.500> using<00:01:08.740> in<00:01:09.610> this

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
the fabric store so we're using in this

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.820 
the fabric store so we're using in this
example<00:01:10.180> we're<00:01:10.450> using<00:01:10.480> 1/2<00:01:11.020> inch<00:01:11.260> wide<00:01:11.380> bias

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:11.830 
example we're using 1/2 inch wide bias

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.040 
example we're using 1/2 inch wide bias
binding<00:01:12.130> the<00:01:12.580> package<00:01:13.000> that<00:01:13.030> I<00:01:13.210> have<00:01:13.510> here<00:01:13.900> is

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:14.050 
binding the package that I have here is

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.410 
binding the package that I have here is
7/8<00:01:15.040> of<00:01:15.160> an<00:01:15.250> inch<00:01:15.370> wide<00:01:15.670> so<00:01:15.940> it<00:01:16.030> comes<00:01:16.210> in<00:01:16.330> a

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
7/8 of an inch wide so it comes in a

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.440 
7/8 of an inch wide so it comes in a
wide<00:01:16.630> variety<00:01:16.810> of<00:01:17.170> widths<00:01:18.130> it<00:01:19.090> comes<00:01:19.270> in<00:01:19.390> a

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
wide variety of widths it comes in a

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.359 
wide variety of widths it comes in a
variety<00:01:19.570> of<00:01:19.840> colors<00:01:20.260> so<00:01:20.500> you<00:01:21.010> can<00:01:21.160> kind<00:01:21.310> of

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:21.369 
variety of colors so you can kind of

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:23.760 
variety of colors so you can kind of
pick<00:01:21.550> and<00:01:21.729> choose<00:01:21.910> what<00:01:22.150> you<00:01:22.180> like<00:01:22.590> one<00:01:23.590> of<00:01:23.680> the

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
pick and choose what you like one of the

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.480 
pick and choose what you like one of the
ways<00:01:23.950> that<00:01:24.690> it's<00:01:25.690> nice<00:01:26.080> to<00:01:26.380> use<00:01:26.590> bias<00:01:27.160> binding

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
ways that it's nice to use bias binding

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.000 
ways that it's nice to use bias binding
is<00:01:27.910> for<00:01:28.210> example<00:01:28.330> this<00:01:28.720> is<00:01:28.780> an<00:01:28.990> unlined<00:01:29.380> jacket

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.010 
is for example this is an unlined jacket

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.430 
is for example this is an unlined jacket
so<00:01:30.610> we<00:01:30.850> use<00:01:31.000> bias<00:01:31.360> binding<00:01:31.570> this<00:01:31.930> is<00:01:32.050> actually

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:32.440 
so we use bias binding this is actually

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.980 
so we use bias binding this is actually
bias<00:01:32.950> that<00:01:33.160> I<00:01:33.220> made<00:01:33.460> so<00:01:34.300> I<00:01:34.330> was<00:01:34.540> able<00:01:34.660> to<00:01:34.810> use<00:01:34.960> a

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
bias that I made so I was able to use a

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.670 
bias that I made so I was able to use a
print<00:01:35.740> to<00:01:36.220> to<00:01:36.610> make<00:01:37.479> the<00:01:37.600> bias<00:01:37.810> but<00:01:38.350> this<00:01:38.530> is

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:38.680 
print to to make the bias but this is

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.219 
print to to make the bias but this is
bias<00:01:38.920> finding<00:01:39.400> that<00:01:39.790> finishes<00:01:40.509> the<00:01:40.690> edge<00:01:40.900> of

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:41.229 
bias finding that finishes the edge of

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:43.499 
bias finding that finishes the edge of
the<00:01:41.380> facing<00:01:41.800> on<00:01:41.979> this<00:01:42.250> jacket<00:01:42.700> so<00:01:42.850> that's<00:01:43.300> one

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:43.509 
the facing on this jacket so that's one

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:45.240 
the facing on this jacket so that's one
way<00:01:43.630> that<00:01:43.660> you<00:01:43.810> could<00:01:43.990> use<00:01:44.020> it<00:01:44.320> if<00:01:45.009> you're

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
way that you could use it if you're

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.270 
way that you could use it if you're
making<00:01:46.470> let's<00:01:47.470> see<00:01:47.650> I<00:01:47.680> would<00:01:47.950> say<00:01:48.100> it's

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
making let's see I would say it's

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.960 
making let's see I would say it's
probably<00:01:48.429> good<00:01:48.940> to<00:01:49.210> use<00:01:49.390> bias<00:01:49.720> binding<00:01:50.050> on

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
probably good to use bias binding on

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.790 
probably good to use bias binding on
maybe<00:01:51.970> very<00:01:52.210> bulky<00:01:52.539> fabrics<00:01:53.200> if<00:01:53.470> you<00:01:53.619> use<00:01:53.770> a

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:53.800 
maybe very bulky fabrics if you use a

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.070 
maybe very bulky fabrics if you use a
very<00:01:54.009> lightweight<00:01:54.369> binding<00:01:55.270> to<00:01:55.509> finish<00:01:55.780> it<00:01:55.929> I

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080 
very lightweight binding to finish it I

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.380 
very lightweight binding to finish it I
wouldn't<00:01:56.440> use<00:01:56.590> it<00:01:56.619> on<00:01:56.979> very<00:01:57.429> sheer<00:01:57.850> or<00:01:58.119> thin

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
wouldn't use it on very sheer or thin

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.300 
wouldn't use it on very sheer or thin
fabrics<00:01:58.929> because<00:01:59.259> it<00:01:59.410> is<00:01:59.530> going<00:01:59.770> to<00:01:59.860> add<00:01:59.979> some

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:00.310 
fabrics because it is going to add some

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.809 
fabrics because it is going to add some
bulk<00:02:00.550> to<00:02:01.030> the<00:02:01.450> finished<00:02:01.780> scene<00:02:02.490> so<00:02:03.490> with<00:02:03.700> that

00:02:03.809 --> 00:02:03.819 
bulk to the finished scene so with that

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:07.590 
bulk to the finished scene so with that
in<00:02:04.000> mind<00:02:04.740> we've<00:02:05.740> sewed<00:02:06.160> our<00:02:06.640> seam<00:02:07.179> with<00:02:07.420> our

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
in mind we've sewed our seam with our

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.150 
in mind we've sewed our seam with our
with<00:02:07.990> the<00:02:08.020> right<00:02:08.259> sides<00:02:08.530> of<00:02:08.679> our<00:02:08.800> fabric

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
with the right sides of our fabric

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.550 
with the right sides of our fabric
together<00:02:09.539> and<00:02:10.539> press<00:02:10.750> the<00:02:10.929> seam<00:02:11.140> allowances

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
together and press the seam allowances

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:12.090 
together and press the seam allowances
open

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
open

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.040 
open
I<00:02:12.130> have<00:02:12.640> again<00:02:12.910> 1/2<00:02:13.210> inch<00:02:13.390> seam<00:02:13.480> allowances

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
I have again 1/2 inch seam allowances

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.610 
I have again 1/2 inch seam allowances
here<00:02:14.350> I'm<00:02:14.530> using<00:02:15.040> again<00:02:15.490> 1/2<00:02:15.940> inch<00:02:16.210> wide

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
here I'm using again 1/2 inch wide

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.480 
here I'm using again 1/2 inch wide
binding<00:02:17.620> and<00:02:17.800> that's<00:02:17.920> going<00:02:18.130> to<00:02:18.220> give<00:02:18.310> me<00:02:18.460> a

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:18.490 
binding and that's going to give me a

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.030 
binding and that's going to give me a
finished<00:02:19.030> width<00:02:19.960> of<00:02:20.200> the<00:02:20.319> binding<00:02:20.650> of<00:02:20.710> 1/4

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
finished width of the binding of 1/4

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.630 
finished width of the binding of 1/4
inch<00:02:21.250> so<00:02:21.610> if<00:02:21.850> so<00:02:22.180> you'll<00:02:22.390> get<00:02:22.569> half<00:02:23.500> of<00:02:23.800> the<00:02:24.010> the

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
inch so if so you'll get half of the the

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.309 
inch so if so you'll get half of the the
width<00:02:24.850> of<00:02:25.030> the<00:02:25.180> actual<00:02:25.540> binding<00:02:25.720> when<00:02:26.200> you're

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:26.319 
width of the actual binding when you're

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:29.309 
width of the actual binding when you're
all<00:02:26.440> finished<00:02:26.470> so<00:02:27.100> to<00:02:27.610> get<00:02:27.760> started<00:02:28.230> I'm<00:02:29.230> just

00:02:29.309 --> 00:02:29.319 
all finished so to get started I'm just

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:32.100 
all finished so to get started I'm just
going<00:02:29.709> to<00:02:29.770> sew<00:02:30.069> or<00:02:30.310> I'm<00:02:30.430> going<00:02:30.610> to<00:02:30.640> pin<00:02:30.910> the<00:02:31.120> one

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
going to sew or I'm going to pin the one

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.720 
going to sew or I'm going to pin the one
edge<00:02:32.319> of<00:02:32.500> the<00:02:32.560> binding<00:02:32.740> I<00:02:33.010> sort<00:02:33.250> of<00:02:33.310> press<00:02:33.550> this

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
edge of the binding I sort of press this

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.340 
edge of the binding I sort of press this
open<00:02:33.940> a<00:02:34.120> little<00:02:34.330> bit<00:02:34.480> so<00:02:34.810> that<00:02:34.959> it<00:02:35.050> was<00:02:35.140> easy

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
open a little bit so that it was easy

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.240 
open a little bit so that it was easy
for<00:02:35.650> me<00:02:35.709> to<00:02:35.740> handle<00:02:36.190> just<00:02:36.880> pin<00:02:37.860> the<00:02:38.860> edge<00:02:39.040> of

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
for me to handle just pin the edge of

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.040 
for me to handle just pin the edge of
the<00:02:39.310> binding<00:02:39.459> to<00:02:40.060> the<00:02:40.270> right<00:02:40.510> side<00:02:40.810> of<00:02:40.959> the

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
the binding to the right side of the

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:45.500 
the binding to the right side of the
seam<00:02:41.260> allowance

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.450 

okay<00:02:46.510> so<00:02:47.110> once<00:02:47.350> this<00:02:47.560> is<00:02:47.770> pinned<00:02:48.070> now<00:02:48.340> I'm

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:48.460 
okay so once this is pinned now I'm

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:49.860 
okay so once this is pinned now I'm
going<00:02:48.670> to<00:02:48.730> move<00:02:48.820> over<00:02:49.090> to<00:02:49.120> the<00:02:49.270> sewing<00:02:49.450> machine

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
going to move over to the sewing machine

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.550 
going to move over to the sewing machine
and<00:02:50.080> I'm<00:02:50.860> going<00:02:50.890> to<00:02:51.190> sew<00:02:51.400> this<00:02:51.610> with<00:02:52.030> a<00:02:52.560> quarter

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
and I'm going to sew this with a quarter

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.490 
and I'm going to sew this with a quarter
inch<00:02:53.710> seam<00:02:53.770> allowance<00:02:54.310> right<00:02:54.580> in<00:02:55.420> that<00:02:55.780> crease

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.180 

that's<00:02:59.500> really<00:02:59.830> easy<00:02:59.950> to<00:03:00.130> see<00:03:00.490> that<00:03:01.890> as<00:03:02.890> you're

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:03.190 
that's really easy to see that as you're

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.610 
that's really easy to see that as you're
sewing<00:03:03.430> you'll<00:03:03.850> be<00:03:03.970> able<00:03:04.090> to<00:03:04.270> see<00:03:04.620> just

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
sewing you'll be able to see just

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.410 
sewing you'll be able to see just
exactly<00:03:05.770> where<00:03:06.280> that<00:03:06.400> crease<00:03:06.700> is<00:03:06.910> if<00:03:07.180> you<00:03:07.270> want

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:07.420 
exactly where that crease is if you want

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.600 
exactly where that crease is if you want
to<00:03:07.450> go<00:03:07.570> a<00:03:07.600> little<00:03:07.900> bit<00:03:08.200> narrower<00:03:08.530> and<00:03:08.980> just<00:03:09.280> to

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
to go a little bit narrower and just to

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.420 
to go a little bit narrower and just to
the<00:03:09.730> right<00:03:09.910> of<00:03:09.970> the<00:03:10.270> crease<00:03:11.070> that<00:03:12.070> will<00:03:12.280> work

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:12.430 
the right of the crease that will work

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:14.370 
the right of the crease that will work
out<00:03:12.640> pretty<00:03:12.790> well<00:03:13.030> too<00:03:13.270> because<00:03:13.810> you<00:03:14.140> actually

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
out pretty well too because you actually

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:15.900 
out pretty well too because you actually
need<00:03:14.680> a<00:03:14.710> little<00:03:15.100> bit<00:03:15.250> of<00:03:15.340> fabric<00:03:15.640> to<00:03:15.790> get

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
need a little bit of fabric to get

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:17.640 
need a little bit of fabric to get
around<00:03:16.210> the<00:03:16.570> curve<00:03:16.780> I'll<00:03:16.990> show<00:03:17.200> you<00:03:17.290> that<00:03:17.440> in<00:03:17.590> a

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
around the curve I'll show you that in a

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:19.770 
around the curve I'll show you that in a
minute
