 you are not going to walk on the street like that 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:16.340
 and us because they may touch it or 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:19.250
 something like that but that's the idea 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.930
 of this product hip hop guys 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.200

 and they feel good you can use it 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:30.260
 normal and at the same time let's say that already 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.940
 you are at home or on a plane is 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:34.340
 the best to use it when you have it 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.120
 an airplane you put it on your face and 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.930
