 that's good too that's for many 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.670
 seldom really the case 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.789
 next we still have the floor 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.369
 plane is a heavy very robust 

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:28.440
 floor plan and not like some 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.830
 cheap times a plane at each 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:35.190
 windfall immediately so flies so 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:39.630
 really a good plan for the bag 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:41.690
 we have the bars from bramfeld here 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.819
 You can not say much 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.530
 and then we'll come to those really 

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:50.450

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:57.330
 Let's come to a round of the 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:02:01.590
 tent as we see the tent is a 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:04.950
 burn six bars and has 17 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:07.289
 year, we look at the pages 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.319
 you really see the design is 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:13.680
 visually also very nice 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:15.629
 We have a stem from the tent 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.000
 should be ahead of rain and stronger 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:20.129
 Sunlight protect that too 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.170
 optimally made for when it rains 

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:24.720
 that you also have time to be open 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.980
 can not let that complete 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.980
 are the tent flutes 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.019
 now we are already at present 

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:35.390
 arrived at the front of the tent has 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:37.150
 a multifunctional window like here 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.129
 to be able to see 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.290
 here is a mosquito net right now 

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:43.640
 built-in 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.989
 but it is also clear with one 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.599
 view window that you can effortlessly 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:50.209
 can attach 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:52.549
 next to the multifunctional window would have 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:56.420
 We also have two next to windows on the 

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:59.230
 right side on the left side here 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:04.519
 A mosquito net is also attached 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:08.180
 You can see the animals both from below 

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:12.650
 from above to make the 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:15.109
 Zips are stable and there you go 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.700
 really nothing breaks you can 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:21.379
 also the complete front 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:23.569
 take that out practically just like that 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:25.669
 Something like one has decided now 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:28.069
 we are inside the eagle 

00:03:25.669 --> 00:03:29.150
 it really is enough space 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:31.519
 we can see here 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:35.389
 you can effortlessly lay two carp 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:36.859
 in the tent at 13 it is already a 

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:38.510
 a bit tighter but for that 

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:40.209
 it is two and a half team 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:42.769
 actually already optimal 

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:45.169
 worth mentioning here would be the tent 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:48.939
 sewn and glued from the inside 

00:03:45.169 --> 00:03:48.939
 if up here can see 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:57.849
 and that additionally supports the 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:04:01.090
 dissipation of moisture the 

00:03:57.849 --> 00:04:05.170
 The water column of the tent is 10,000 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:08.049
 millimeter, now we will be too 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:11.319
 When you arrive at the river you can to 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:27.580
 conclusion only say the tent is attached 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:29.199
