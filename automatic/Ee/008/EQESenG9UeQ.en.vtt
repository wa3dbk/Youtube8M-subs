little<00:03:02.150> candle<00:03:02.360> holder<00:03:02.780> but<00:03:02.960> I'm<00:03:03.080> actually

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
little candle holder but I'm actually

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.110 
little candle holder but I'm actually
going<00:03:03.590> to<00:03:03.680> use<00:03:03.710> it<00:03:03.950> to<00:03:03.980> hold<00:03:04.220> my<00:03:04.730> makeup

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
going to use it to hold my makeup

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:11.240 
going to use it to hold my makeup
brushes<00:03:05.360> because<00:03:05.690> it's<00:03:06.020> just<00:03:06.230> that<00:03:06.440> adorable

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.040 

the<00:03:11.790> next<00:03:12.060> thing<00:03:12.150> I<00:03:12.270> picked<00:03:12.480> up<00:03:12.600> was<00:03:12.660> this

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
the next thing I picked up was this

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.380 
the next thing I picked up was this
cupcake<00:03:13.320> container<00:03:13.920> which<00:03:14.640> I<00:03:14.940> thought<00:03:15.210> was

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
cupcake container which I thought was

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.060 
cupcake container which I thought was
pretty<00:03:15.450> awesome<00:03:15.990> you<00:03:16.620> know<00:03:16.710> it's<00:03:16.860> not<00:03:17.010> the

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:17.070 
pretty awesome you know it's not the

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:19.190 
pretty awesome you know it's not the
thickest<00:03:17.580> plastic<00:03:18.120> but<00:03:18.360> it<00:03:18.390> actually<00:03:18.660> snapped

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
thickest plastic but it actually snapped

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:24.320 
thickest plastic but it actually snapped
and<00:03:20.330> I<00:03:21.330> know<00:03:21.780> it<00:03:22.020> has<00:03:22.200> like<00:03:22.650> the<00:03:23.280> holes<00:03:23.520> to<00:03:23.970> fit

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
and I know it has like the holes to fit

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:25.760 
and I know it has like the holes to fit
cupcakes<00:03:24.840> in<00:03:25.020> but<00:03:25.200> I<00:03:25.230> thought<00:03:25.440> this<00:03:25.620> would

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:25.770 
cupcakes in but I thought this would

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:27.920 
cupcakes in but I thought this would
just<00:03:25.890> be<00:03:26.010> a<00:03:26.400> good<00:03:26.850> item<00:03:27.060> to<00:03:27.270> have<00:03:27.480> any<00:03:27.720> time

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:27.930

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
but as soon as you rub it into your skin

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.670

it<00:03:56.430> goes<00:03:56.610> away<00:03:56.790> pretty<00:03:57.390> quickly<00:03:57.690> the<00:03:58.320> only

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680
