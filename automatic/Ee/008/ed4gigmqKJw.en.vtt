00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:49.720 
music I haven't integrated a lot of an

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.830 
music I haven't integrated a lot of an
external<00:00:50.110> GPS<00:00:50.500> antenna<00:00:51.149> and<00:00:52.149> the<00:00:52.390> other

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:52.840 
external GPS antenna and the other

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.990 
external GPS antenna and the other

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.000 
antenna above it is a software-defined

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.360 
antenna above it is a software-defined
radio<00:00:55.630> so<00:00:56.440> it's<00:00:56.590> basically<00:00:56.860> like<00:00:56.980> a<00:00:57.100> police

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:57.370 
radio so it's basically like a police

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.520 
radio so it's basically like a police
scanner<00:00:58.230> can<00:00:59.230> track<00:00:59.440> airplanes<00:00:59.890> with<00:01:00.130> it<00:01:00.309> and

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
scanner can track airplanes with it and

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.990 
scanner can track airplanes with it and
I<00:01:02.530> can<00:01:02.800> also<00:01:02.950> watch<00:01:03.160> a<00:01:03.250> live<00:01:03.430> TV<00:01:03.670> with<00:01:03.880> this

can you know create a log of my rpms the
map<00:02:01.940> usage<00:02:02.390> that's<00:02:03.050> pretty<00:02:03.260> cool<00:02:03.380> called<00:02:03.800> log

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:03.950 
map usage that's pretty cool called log

map usage that's pretty cool called log
works<00:02:04.220> by<00:02:04.400> n<00:02:04.550> avoid<00:02:04.790> innovate<00:02:05.240> lc1<00:02:05.750> and<00:02:06.880> it's

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
works by n avoid innovate lc1 and it's

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:17.380 
works by n avoid innovate lc1 and it's
also<00:02:08.149> a<00:02:14.440> software-defined<00:02:15.440> radio<00:02:16.120> so<00:02:17.120> this<00:02:17.270> is

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
also a software-defined radio so this is

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:18.640 
also a software-defined radio so this is
basically<00:02:17.720> I<00:02:17.810> can<00:02:18.080> monitor<00:02:18.350> every<00:02:18.620> single

basically I can monitor every single
like<00:02:18.980> pls<00:02:19.430> channel<00:02:19.790> if<00:02:19.850> they're<00:02:19.970> not

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
like pls channel if they're not

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.160 
like pls channel if they're not
encrypted<00:02:20.540> I<00:02:21.290> can<00:02:22.690> you<00:02:23.690> know<00:02:23.750> it's<00:02:23.900> basically

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
encrypted I can you know it's basically

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:25.560 
encrypted I can you know it's basically
I<00:02:24.260> can<00:02:24.350> list<00:02:24.470> all<00:02:24.590> the<00:02:24.620> ham<00:02:24.830> radio<00:02:25.160> signals

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
I can list all the ham radio signals

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.720 
I can list all the ham radio signals
listen<00:02:26.570> to<00:02:26.630> the<00:02:26.690> airplanes<00:02:27.110> I<00:02:28.010> can<00:02:28.310> also<00:02:28.430> track

there's also dinner app on here you can
actually<00:03:13.880> track<00:03:14.150> our<00:03:14.360> planes<00:03:14.570> like<00:03:14.870> with<00:03:15.650> a

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
actually track our planes like with a

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.810 
actually track our planes like with a
map<00:03:17.890> don't<00:03:18.890> have<00:03:19.070> on<00:03:19.220> there<00:03:19.400> but<00:03:19.520> yeah<00:03:19.610> this<00:03:19.730> is

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
map don't have on there but yeah this is

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:20.949 
map don't have on there but yeah this is
a<00:03:19.880> pretty<00:03:20.060> cool<00:03:20.150> little<00:03:20.239> setup<00:03:20.480> and<00:03:20.750> this<00:03:20.870> is

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
a pretty cool little setup and this is

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:24.670 
a pretty cool little setup and this is
my<00:03:21.200> 1966<00:03:22.100> Bronco<00:03:22.489> and<00:03:23.470> so<00:03:24.470> when<00:03:24.590> I'm

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
my 1966 Bronco and so when I'm

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.920 
my 1966 Bronco and so when I'm
off-roading<00:03:25.040> I<00:03:25.220> have<00:03:25.370> a<00:03:25.400> full-blown<00:03:26.239> GPS<00:03:26.720> in

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
off-roading I have a full-blown GPS in

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.320 
off-roading I have a full-blown GPS in
here<00:03:27.110> and<00:03:27.290> I<00:03:27.800> can<00:03:28.489> store<00:03:28.670> the<00:03:28.790> maps<00:03:29.000> offline

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.330 
here and I can store the maps offline

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.460 
here and I can store the maps offline
which<00:03:29.750> is<00:03:29.900> cool<00:03:30.080> that's<00:03:31.810> so<00:03:32.810> I<00:03:32.840> can<00:03:33.230> either<00:03:33.320> do

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
which is cool that's so I can either do

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.650 
which is cool that's so I can either do
a<00:03:33.500> combination<00:03:33.800> of<00:03:34.040> both<00:03:34.190> or<00:03:34.330> but<00:03:35.330> typically

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
a combination of both or but typically

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.060 
a combination of both or but typically
it's<00:03:35.840> on<00:03:35.930> this<00:03:36.140> thing<00:03:36.290> but<00:03:36.440> what<00:03:36.620> I<00:03:36.650> usually<00:03:36.890> do

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:37.070 
it's on this thing but what I usually do

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:38.740 
it's on this thing but what I usually do
is<00:03:37.190> when<00:03:37.280> I'm<00:03:37.370> stopping<00:03:37.760> all<00:03:37.880> I'll<00:03:38.420> have<00:03:38.570> my

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
is when I'm stopping all I'll have my

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.259 
is when I'm stopping all I'll have my
GPS<00:03:39.260> running<00:03:39.769> on<00:03:39.830> my<00:03:40.010> phone<00:03:40.370> but<00:03:41.060> then<00:03:41.180> I'll

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:41.269 
GPS running on my phone but then I'll

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:42.640 
GPS running on my phone but then I'll
have<00:03:41.360> all<00:03:41.480> my<00:03:41.510> gauge<00:03:41.870> cluster<00:03:42.290> going<00:03:42.470> on<00:03:42.560> this

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
have all my gauge cluster going on this

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:43.570 
have all my gauge cluster going on this
thing<00:03:42.709> so<00:03:43.010> I<00:03:43.070> can<00:03:43.100> see<00:03:43.340> what's<00:03:43.489> actually

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:43.580
