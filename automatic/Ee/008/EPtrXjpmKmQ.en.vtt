00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.360 
one is the Spinosaurus and it also comes
with<00:00:09.360> parts<00:00:09.840> for<00:00:10.139> the<00:00:10.290> boss<00:00:10.620> of<00:00:10.830> sorts<00:00:11.219> so

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
let's check it out so here is the

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.730 
let's check it out so here is the
Spinosaurus<00:00:15.120> which<00:00:15.570> I<00:00:15.780> think<00:00:16.109> looks<00:00:16.170> really

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
Spinosaurus which I think looks really

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.370 
Spinosaurus which I think looks really
cool<00:00:17.010> and<00:00:17.250> you<00:00:17.580> can<00:00:17.820> kind<00:00:18.420> of<00:00:18.600> a<00:00:18.840> little<00:00:19.199> bit

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
cool and you can kind of a little bit

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.439 
cool and you can kind of a little bit
open<00:00:19.800> and<00:00:19.980> close<00:00:20.189> its<00:00:20.430> mouth<00:00:20.609> not<00:00:20.970> all<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.420> way

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
open and close its mouth not all the way

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:24.109 
open and close its mouth not all the way
because<00:00:21.930> the<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.680> jaw<00:00:22.920> is<00:00:23.130> kind<00:00:23.340> of<00:00:23.490> shaped<00:00:23.939> a

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
because the the jaw is kind of shaped a

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.599 
because the the jaw is kind of shaped a
little<00:00:24.269> odd<00:00:24.630> for<00:00:25.260> that<00:00:25.560> but<00:00:26.160> it<00:00:26.340> still<00:00:26.580> looks

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
little odd for that but it still looks

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.759 
little odd for that but it still looks
really<00:00:27.090> cool<00:00:27.330> it's<00:00:27.570> really<00:00:28.140> really<00:00:28.439> brightly

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
really cool it's really really brightly

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.339 
really cool it's really really brightly
colored<00:00:29.340> kind<00:00:29.910> of<00:00:30.000> reminds<00:00:30.539> me<00:00:30.660> of<00:00:30.779> a<00:00:30.960> peacock

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
colored kind of reminds me of a peacock

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.220 
colored kind of reminds me of a peacock
though<00:00:31.529> it's<00:00:31.800> colored<00:00:32.160> but<00:00:32.820> anyway<00:00:33.239> I<00:00:33.450> think

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
though it's colored but anyway I think

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.959 
though it's colored but anyway I think
this<00:00:34.320> is<00:00:34.380> a<00:00:34.500> really<00:00:34.710> cool<00:00:34.980> Dino<00:00:35.250> and<00:00:35.460> of<00:00:35.700> course

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
go and give it fins instead make it make

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.550 
go and give it fins instead make it make
it<00:01:10.170> basically<00:01:10.680> look<00:01:10.950> like<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.159> half<00:01:11.880> water

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
it basically look like a half water

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.870 
it basically look like a half water
water<00:01:13.670> reptile<00:01:14.670> here<00:01:15.630> kind<00:01:16.140> of<00:01:16.729> kind<00:01:17.729> of

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
water reptile here kind of kind of

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.609 
water reptile here kind of kind of
really<00:01:18.090> looks<00:01:18.299> odd<00:01:18.570> like<00:01:18.900> that<00:01:19.110> but<00:01:19.320> you<00:01:19.439> can

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
really looks odd like that but you can

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.710 
really looks odd like that but you can
continue<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.220> switch<00:01:20.460> it<00:01:20.640> out<00:01:20.790> as<00:01:20.939> you<00:01:21.360> can<00:01:21.509> see

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
continue to switch it out as you can see

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:24.800 
continue to switch it out as you can see
and<00:01:21.900> change<00:01:22.470> it<00:01:22.619> out<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:23.430> be<00:01:23.790> kind<00:01:24.330> of<00:01:24.479> whatever

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
and change it out to be kind of whatever

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.010 
and change it out to be kind of whatever
dinosaur<00:01:25.740> or<00:01:26.040> water<00:01:26.759> reptile<00:01:27.270> you'd<00:01:27.630> like<00:01:27.810> it

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
dinosaur or water reptile you'd like it

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.380 
dinosaur or water reptile you'd like it
to<00:01:28.049> be<00:01:28.320> which<00:01:29.250> i<00:01:29.460> think<00:01:29.490> is<00:01:29.700> really<00:01:29.970> cool<00:01:30.150> and

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
to be which i think is really cool and

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.499 
to be which i think is really cool and
this<00:01:31.350> is<00:01:31.560> awesome<00:01:32.040> it<00:01:32.250> also<00:01:32.520> comes<00:01:32.909> with<00:01:33.180> the

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
this is awesome it also comes with the

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.190 
this is awesome it also comes with the
Mosasaurus<00:01:33.960> head<00:01:34.729> which<00:01:35.729> is<00:01:36.060> just<00:01:36.540> a<00:01:36.720> water

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
Mosasaurus head which is just a water

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.170 
Mosasaurus head which is just a water
reptile<00:01:37.710> not<00:01:38.009> actually<00:01:38.369> a<00:01:38.400> dinosaur

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
reptile not actually a dinosaur

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.240 
reptile not actually a dinosaur
unfortunately<00:01:40.049> I<00:01:40.259> would<00:01:40.799> still<00:01:41.040> like<00:01:41.220> to

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
unfortunately I would still like to

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.609 
unfortunately I would still like to
refer<00:01:41.579> to<00:01:41.790> it<00:01:41.880> as<00:01:41.939> a<00:01:42.000> dino<00:01:42.299> but<00:01:42.720> it's<00:01:43.409> not

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
refer to it as a dino but it's not

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.789 
refer to it as a dino but it's not
technically<00:01:44.280> so<00:01:44.790> anyway<00:01:45.299> but<00:01:46.020> you<00:01:46.200> can<00:01:46.439> you

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
technically so anyway but you can you

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.310 
technically so anyway but you can you
know<00:01:46.920> swap<00:01:47.490> out<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.880> head<00:01:48.119> so<00:01:48.840> you<00:01:48.869> can<00:01:48.990> really

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
know swap out the head so you can really

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.710 
know swap out the head so you can really
make<00:01:49.619> this<00:01:49.860> whatever<00:01:50.310> kind<00:01:50.759> of<00:01:50.880> dinosaur<00:01:51.240> you

want<00:01:51.990> it<00:01:52.049> to<00:01:52.200> be<00:01:52.430> like<00:01:53.430> I<00:01:53.549> said<00:01:53.579> I<00:01:54.030> think<00:01:54.960> it's

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
want it to be like I said I think it's
