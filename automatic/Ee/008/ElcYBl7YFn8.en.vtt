00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.120
 of wii well you can see that they have better 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:44.090
 graphics and all this touching the plastic 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:44.090
 to see what happened with the paranoia code 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.710
 calls propagandas weird things a 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.500
 little book 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.680
 basically having the games this is 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.680
 of 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:07.210
 good that presented nice game 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.210
 one thing we are going to see and important 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:14.720
 this is the art book that also 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.720
 comes 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:24.680
 when we have 80 quantities 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:41.720
 to believe it 8 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:46.520

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:50.770

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:53.229
 well they will have are quite in minigames 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:57.530
 if they come here more with a carlos ones 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:59.150
 14,000 at stake or something like that I think they are 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.680
 but you will also have a video of each 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:05.510

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:23.190
 with the normal console is also the 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:26.280
 I urge that it is the one that has more memory 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:31.130
 still it has quite a time 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.130

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:43.680

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.230

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:27.069
 to evil 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:35.290

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.290

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:18.180

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:54.689
 be to put it like this 

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:04.210
