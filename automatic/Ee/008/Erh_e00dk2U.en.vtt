00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.100
 week to join the crowd and drink 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:06.629
 that cold beer 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.540
 even though the alcoholic beverage is more 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:11.460
 from Brazil, the country is far from 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.440
 be one of the first places in consumption 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.580
 in the world and since there are so many people 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.049
 beer fan 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.270
 nothing better than knowing a little more 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.310
 about the subject and also taste some 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:24.050
 Then stay tuned. 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.050
 although take one with us 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.710
 Good people, today 's talk is about beer. 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:39.890
 this is why you have the 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:42.560
 brunette and head take over and also with the 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.840
 advertising paulo navas that has as 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.310
 hobby craft brewing 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.990
 First of all, I wanted to thank the 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:51.640
 presence of both of you 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:53.809
 start with bia the first women 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.150
 first of all was as the 

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:58.129
 the manufacturing process of 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.750
 beer is different from one type of 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:03.230
 good beer 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:05.059
 basically no process results from the 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:07.460
 beer we start with the 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:11.960
 ingredients that are basically 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:13.550
 four water malt hops and yeast 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.610
 We want these ingredients to people. 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:18.320
 Can make several types of beer 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.229
 I'll decide what my revenue is. 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.750
 first you as I will know is what 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:26.410
 style of beer I want to do and there it is 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.410
 good for manufacturing 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:41.620
 this time more or less type of preparation 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:44.200
 of beer takes more or less how it looks 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.520
 here in a factory is regional that people 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.150
 has a very large difference between 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.800
 craft beer if you travel menstrue 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:55.479
 We call it commercial beers. 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:56.950
 in a factory around 28-30 days and 

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:59.740
 with more or less the ability to 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.960
 production of a handicraft factory as 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.300
 you not only to the factory as the 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:08.489
 colorado has a monthly production 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:10.690
 it reaches up to 100 thousand liters of beer 

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:13.600
 spent a little on the other side of the table 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:16.000
 now as paulo nabas totally spoke 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.580
 He is an advertising man but he 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.400
 branch of craft beer paulo 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:24.610
 what led you to want to produce your 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:27.190
 Even my own beer was not 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:28.560
 I began to know the various types of 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.209
 beer right? 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.450
 then I was curious to know how 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:36.730
 Is it the legal proposal that works? 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:37.660
 maybe looking for a course I talked to 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.110
 a friend 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:43.299
 They told me there number is going against the 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.760
 things will search the internet low 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:49.480
 video takes books that are cooler than 

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:51.790
 that is suddenly you make a short is 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.730
 The course is valid for sure. 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.450
 but the discovery was interesting. 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.060
 huh 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:01.300
 quite early but then normal 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:03.580
 a hurry team is and then I started 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.349
 I bought equipment purchase I started 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.620
 make you neither venture with 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:11.170
 this bia is beyond the ingredients that 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.569
 Have you mentioned any business? 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:15.550
 inside these bottles is also what 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:18.310
 are the other ingredients that go into this 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:21.459
 line of beers have enough 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:24.310
 agribusiness natal iinn that opened if the 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:27.250
 people will have manpower in the area 

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:30.519
 people are going to have honey in India that 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:34.209
 You'll have brown sugar in the illness and I 

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:37.540
 I'll have coffee in the guanabara not having 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:40.599
 burned rapadura in the horseshoe victim of 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:43.660
 new and this is actually a series 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:45.489
 special that address 6 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.440
 it's not going to be a week in any series 

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:48.600
 special colorado 

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:51.210
 did for another blow that does not go much 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:54.090
 brewer of the famous of são paulo 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:56.880
 It is what you're looking for a beer b 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.990
 When you sit down to enjoy some 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.090
 some kind 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:03.510
 in my case I had I went through several 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:07.350
 phases so mc cann but I already had mine 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:10.260
 phase in wheat there I had the given phase 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:14.490
 size and even you and I only drank port 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:16.830
 currently is in phase i is so 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:18.390
 but it 's what 's coolest you discover 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:20.640
 the flavors in beer 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:24.000
 The day I felt the taste of a clove 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:25.620
 beer with our day nobody tava 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.850
 feeling the taste but I do not know why 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.610
 is to search 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:31.800
 There you are talking about the tastes of 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:34.050
 clove does not begin to discover the eta 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:37.320
 22 days of ballooning in blindness 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:39.840
 but instead of banana it has a scent 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:42.050
 neighborhood and there are more things and he has 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.540
 much more to discover that yet 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:48.870
 they do not have the taste of Bahia for example 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:51.480
 you can not get an ipa and sit 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:54.120
 with your friends on a barbecue in 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:56.100
 take all the small but usually 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.040
 also occurs in the classroom the singer of 

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:00.969
 61 61 61 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:04.659
 see nearly twice 

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:09.219
 but it is very striking out the flavor right 

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:12.789
 so this is an experience for us 

00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:15.309
 close this chat how to propose a 

00:05:12.789 --> 00:05:18.639
 bit of practice in this whole story already 

00:05:15.309 --> 00:05:20.919
 We have a brewmaster in the harvest. 

00:05:18.639 --> 00:05:23.079
 you can still learn to be the cause of the disease 

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:26.610
 she talks later to try the 

00:05:23.079 --> 00:05:26.610
 beer is paulo navas 

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:42.189
 no problem had with expo message 

00:05:38.499 --> 00:05:47.580
 this discovery is a remarkable achievement in this 

00:05:42.189 --> 00:05:47.580
 into account the point in favor 

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:58.590
 well balanced I think I could even have 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:02.400
 that carry a little more in the curriculum 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:04.740
 that this is the most obvious thing with itu 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:07.620
 sp and believes once again to thank the 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:11.190
 presence of the bia on him is 

00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:14.550
 also from paulo navas who is an advertiser 

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:17.760
 but now master brewer lodged 

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:19.590
