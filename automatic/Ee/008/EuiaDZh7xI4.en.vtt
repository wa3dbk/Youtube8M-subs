00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:12.870 
when we feel like releasing the math if

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.440 
when we feel like releasing the math if
that<00:00:13.049> ever<00:00:13.259> happens<00:00:13.380> though<00:00:13.980> ok<00:00:14.790> cool<00:00:15.210> we're

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
like this l-shaped building I'm going

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.680 
like this l-shaped building I'm going
yeah<00:02:22.310> we<00:02:23.310> did<00:02:23.519> the<00:02:23.670> l-shaped<00:02:24.180> building<00:02:24.360> kind

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
yeah we did the l-shaped building kind

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.320 
yeah we did the l-shaped building kind
of<00:02:24.810> there<00:02:25.590> and<00:02:26.099> at<00:02:26.340> the<00:02:26.489> end<00:02:26.519> so<00:02:27.000> will<00:02:27.120> the<00:02:27.209> end

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.330 
of there and at the end so will the end

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.880 
of there and at the end so will the end
one<00:02:27.690> makes<00:02:27.989> more<00:02:28.170> sense<00:02:28.410> because<00:02:28.530> you<00:02:28.769> know

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
one makes more sense because you know

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.150 
one makes more sense because you know
just<00:02:29.099> the<00:02:29.340> end<00:02:29.489> it<00:02:29.700> closes<00:02:30.239> it<00:02:30.360> off<00:02:30.480> but<00:02:31.160> here

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
just the end it closes it off but here

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.680 
just the end it closes it off but here
i'll<00:02:32.700> be<00:02:32.910> honest<00:02:33.150> i<00:02:33.269> don't<00:02:33.330> know<00:02:33.480> what<00:02:33.599> you

have you guys worked out like a way to
do<00:02:55.049> the<00:02:55.489> the<00:02:56.489> run<00:02:57.060> right<00:02:57.329> through<00:02:57.569> the<00:02:57.840> thing

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
do the the run right through the thing

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:05.330 
do the the run right through the thing
in<00:03:00.720> for<00:03:01.019> the<00:03:01.110> movie<00:03:01.230> any<00:03:01.819> actor<00:03:02.819> I<00:03:04.340> remember

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
in for the movie any actor I remember

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.930 
in for the movie any actor I remember
just<00:03:05.549> I<00:03:05.760> use<00:03:05.970> low<00:03:06.209> clip<00:03:07.099> no<00:03:08.099> cuz<00:03:08.610> that<00:03:08.790> would

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
just I use low clip no cuz that would

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.930 
just I use low clip no cuz that would
look<00:03:09.120> shoddy<00:03:09.420> i<00:03:09.569> think<00:03:09.930> but<00:03:10.170> um<00:03:10.610> we<00:03:11.610> do<00:03:11.790> have

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
look shoddy i think but um we do have

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.460 
look shoddy i think but um we do have
you<00:03:12.090> know<00:03:12.120> the<00:03:12.329> pressure<00:03:12.540> plates<00:03:12.870> and<00:03:13.230> all<00:03:13.349> the

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470 
you know the pressure plates and all the

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.680 
you know the pressure plates and all the
door<00:03:13.650> so<00:03:13.980> i<00:03:14.250> think<00:03:14.430> the<00:03:15.000> hardest<00:03:15.329> part<00:03:15.450> would

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
door so i think the hardest part would

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.559 
door so i think the hardest part would
be<00:03:15.750> the<00:03:15.870> turning<00:03:16.670> between<00:03:17.670> you<00:03:17.940> know<00:03:18.060> all<00:03:18.359> the

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:18.569 
be the turning between you know all the

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:23.120 
be the turning between you know all the
seats<00:03:19.170> yeah<00:03:21.260> you<00:03:22.260> like<00:03:22.500> to<00:03:22.590> run<00:03:22.620> right<00:03:22.889> through

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
seats yeah you like to run right through

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:26.300 
seats yeah you like to run right through
the<00:03:23.840> little<00:03:24.840> brick<00:03:25.049> pillar<00:03:25.709> and<00:03:26.040> then<00:03:26.160> they
