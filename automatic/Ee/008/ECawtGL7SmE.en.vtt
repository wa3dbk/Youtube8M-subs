00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.920
 Hi, I'm Ana Paula, teacher. 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.020
 mathematics from the state of rio de janeiro and 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.340
 of the municipality of itaboraÃ­ south formed 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:21.710
 by the Faculty of Education 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.330
 teachers UERJ University 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.980
 state of rio de janeiro and does 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:27.020
 graduate in uff university 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.640
 Federal Fluminense 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.919
 I'll bring you some 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.170
 questions with courses beginning with 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:35.900
 fire department competition that was 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.180
 which happened in 2008 of the state of the river 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.860
 of January 

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:46.610
 It's my first videotape I hope 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:48.590
 do you like question 21 the network store 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.110
 baby on a lightning promotion is 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:54.170
 offering a 20% discount on all 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:56.060
 his goods and took an interest in 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:59.270
 a couch and paid for the same value 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:02.060
 $ 400 the original value of the sofa without 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:03.920
 20 percent discount was good 

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:06.439
 still had a 20 percent discount 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.880
 means that she paid 80 percent of the 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:19.220
 value of this sofa 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:22.640
 Let's see items 480 520 540 and 560 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.740
 generally the contests is every question 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.710
 have five items and you choose one 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.780
 proves each answer card 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:31.400
 Well this question is simple and she 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:36.680
 resolved from the rule of three 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:40.570
 simple let's get the solution still paid 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:42.620
 400 reais that it actually does to 80% 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.020
 of the sofa's value 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:46.700
 note that here I do not put the symbol 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.070
 percentage of why I'm doing the 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.820
 calculation and I do not need to 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.420
 symbol 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:56.930
 I'll call it the corresponding value 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:58.790
 to the total value of the couch that is the 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.979
 would pay without the discount 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.960
 well I'm using x but you too 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.729
 can use any other letter because 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.310
 also this is not a must is 

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:12.110
 really boots the letter to 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:14.390
 symbolize the value of this well-known 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:17.510
 the x is the total value of the couch then 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:21.240
 corresponds to 100% 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.920
 we obviously use it talking about whether it is 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.350
 mine is more for drawing attention 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.470
 call of creed cross 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:31.050
 but it is actually a 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:34.050
 proportion between witch between two fractions 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:39.990
 and we multiply in x 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:42.570
 come on 80 times xl 80 x equals 400 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:46.200
 times when it's 40 thousand 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:49.020
 here you can think of a number that x 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.340
 80 of 40 thousand 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:55.380
 but if you do not think that way 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:03:00.150
 you divide 40 thousand by 80 will stay 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:04.770
 so x equals 40 thousand / 80 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:07.980
 that you also apply if you want 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:09.690
 divide 40,000 direct by 80 can more 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.000
 here you can also simplify this 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.990
 fraction to get better to be 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.900
 resolved 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:18.120
 you can take 10 from above with 10 from 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:21.180
 what it means to invest 10 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:27.710
 numerator with 10 of denominator 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:33.960
 That's how you get 4 thousand / 8 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:40.260
 note that 4410 forms 40 which is a 

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:45.750
 multiple of eight the number that x 8 of 40 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:49.680
 then 40/8 of five then we can 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:53.430
 make this division 1 5 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:56.700
 Only that there are still 2060 you go 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:04:00.150
 then add end result in 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:02.130
 real acts and has b our question 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:04.920
 I hope you have enjoyed it and 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:09.410
