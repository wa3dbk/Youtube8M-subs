00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.380 
in my opinion I just suck at doing henna
and<00:01:07.799> just<00:01:08.010> need<00:01:08.189> to<00:01:08.400> practice<00:01:08.670> a<00:01:09.030> little<00:01:09.270> bit

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
and just need to practice a little bit

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.630 
and just need to practice a little bit
more<00:01:09.570> which<00:01:10.110> is<00:01:10.290> why<00:01:10.500> my<00:01:10.860> lines<00:01:11.159> are<00:01:11.340> kind<00:01:11.549> of

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
more which is why my lines are kind of

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.450 
more which is why my lines are kind of
thicker<00:01:11.909> but<00:01:12.240> I<00:01:12.270> feel<00:01:12.600> like<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:13.460> applicator

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
thicker but I feel like the applicator

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.580 
thicker but I feel like the applicator
it<00:01:14.640> came<00:01:14.850> with<00:01:15.030> it<00:01:15.330> you're<00:01:15.990> able<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.380> get

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
it came with it you're able to get

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.679 
it came with it you're able to get
really<00:01:16.920> thin<00:01:17.130> lines<00:01:17.369> if<00:01:17.610> you<00:01:17.670> just<00:01:18.150> practice

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
really thin lines if you just practice

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.160 
really thin lines if you just practice
