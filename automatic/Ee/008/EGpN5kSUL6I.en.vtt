any of my houses with like skylights in

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.420 
any of my houses with like skylights in
them<00:03:19.390> will<00:03:19.630> not<00:03:20.200> work<00:03:20.470> since<00:03:20.770> skylights<00:03:21.310> are

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
them will not work since skylights are

them will not work since skylights are
technically<00:03:21.760> just<00:03:22.000> not<00:03:22.360> a<00:03:22.540> roof<00:03:22.840> and<00:03:23.110> when<00:03:23.440> you

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
technically just not a roof and when you

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:24.840 
technically just not a roof and when you
don't<00:03:23.620> have<00:03:23.680> a<00:03:23.740> roof<00:03:24.010> kind<00:03:24.490> of<00:03:24.580> lets<00:03:24.730> the

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:24.850 
don't have a roof kind of lets the

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.060 
don't have a roof kind of lets the
weather<00:03:25.030> in<00:03:25.330> so<00:03:25.750> that<00:03:25.780> could<00:03:26.230> be<00:03:26.260> a<00:03:26.440> problem<00:03:26.680> I

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070 
weather in so that could be a problem I

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:29.160 
weather in so that could be a problem I
recommend<00:03:27.760> just<00:03:28.030> placing<00:03:28.330> floor<00:03:28.570> tiles<00:03:28.840> in

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
recommend just placing floor tiles in

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:31.830 
recommend just placing floor tiles in
the<00:03:29.230> spaces<00:03:29.710> where<00:03:30.070> the<00:03:30.220> roof<00:03:31.090> the<00:03:31.420> big

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
the spaces where the roof the big

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.230 
the spaces where the roof the big
skylights<00:03:32.350> used<00:03:32.530> to<00:03:32.620> be<00:03:32.740> and<00:03:32.980> that<00:03:33.970> should

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:34.240 
skylights used to be and that should

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.610 
skylights used to be and that should
