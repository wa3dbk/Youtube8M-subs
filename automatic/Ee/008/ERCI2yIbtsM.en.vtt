um kind of soaks into my hair a little

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.570 
um kind of soaks into my hair a little
bit<00:03:19.020> better<00:03:19.230> but<00:03:19.620> this<00:03:19.890> stuff<00:03:20.070> is<00:03:20.250> really<00:03:20.460> good

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
bit better but this stuff is really good

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.570 
bit better but this stuff is really good
as<00:03:20.880> well<00:03:20.910> um<00:03:21.390> the<00:03:22.260> differences<00:03:22.800> in<00:03:22.950> color<00:03:23.250> are

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
as well um the differences in color are

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.220 
as well um the differences in color are
the<00:03:23.820> different<00:03:24.240> there's<00:03:24.540> a<00:03:24.630> difference<00:03:24.810> in

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:25.230 
the different there's a difference in

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:28.520 
the different there's a difference in
color<00:03:25.500> this<00:03:26.430> is<00:03:26.670> like<00:03:26.850> a<00:03:26.880> red<00:03:27.210> color<00:03:27.540> and<00:03:27.930> the

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
color this is like a red color and the

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.520 
color this is like a red color and the
Moroccan<00:03:29.040> oils<00:03:29.340> like<00:03:29.580> a<00:03:29.820> golden<00:03:30.480> color<00:03:31.170> so

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:31.530 
Moroccan oils like a golden color so

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.790 
Moroccan oils like a golden color so
anyway<00:03:32.190> I<00:03:32.400> think<00:03:32.670> it<00:03:32.940> depends<00:03:33.350> on<00:03:34.350> the<00:03:34.590> day

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
anyway I think it depends on the day

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.450 
anyway I think it depends on the day
what<00:03:35.580> I<00:03:35.610> feel<00:03:35.910> like<00:03:36.180> using<00:03:37.070> what<00:03:38.070> my<00:03:38.250> hair
