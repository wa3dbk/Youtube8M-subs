00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.230
 years old 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:23.970
 the game is even older than the world of warcraft in 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.009

 let's start here with this box inside 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:50.030
 likely to be discs unlockable 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:51.760
 one-two-three unexpectedly but a disk here in 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.660
 Generally it is not a fact in 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:56.000
 average collectibles here 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:59.059
 right here here is the drive in the center 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.280
 recording symphonies iv but we do not lose heart 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:03.379
 because there are three more plastic 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.500
 cards with codes can be obtained 

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:09.229
 I kiss a lot of in-game items for 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.740
 most and online this is a golden pilot 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.550
 capsules 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:16.009

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:25.240
 which are reflected 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:29.360
 momentous events of the first 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:31.940
 decades and online for dust 514 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.220

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:37.250
 Templar Armor Kit 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.500
 the last card is mysterious she 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.990
 opens one gift from random 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.390
 someone will get plex lei 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.670
 online to someone cybernetic hand for 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.520
 character and someone pulls a fighter 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.549
 templar mark2 prototype for the game and in 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.290
 valkyrie so far she is still in development 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:56.270
 another code on a small booklet with 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.950
 instructions for activating cards 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.280
 it allows you to create a new account

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.600
 disposal 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.670
 the next we get metal 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.610
 a box with a board game day grater 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:15.580
 judging by the sticker made in china 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.920
 inside the heap is writing cubes bag 

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.020
 silica gel and u can't eat sea 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:23.080
 cards of different sizes and among them 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:25.000
 there is a pretty little book with 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.670
 rules that like the game itself 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.130
 the purest English and here still 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.710
 have a thick wad of fake dollars in 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:35.320
 a portrait of a grandmother instead of a president 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:38.920
 interesting fact is the output of this 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:40.870
 board game in 1998 allowed 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.390
 raise funds to develop first 

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:48.490
 versions and online here's such 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:51.250
 so drag the historical further from 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:53.380
 The boxes seemed who the boat if 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.810

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.820
 part-time it is a usb hub for 4 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.650

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:05.560
 computer well sorry for the lower titanium but 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:08.080
 titanium find such a thing is possible and 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:12.550
 wait another ten years 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:14.800
 the next item is expanding aaa this 

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:16.989

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.900
 fit it laid separately 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:21.730
 the last thing left is a thick book in 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.770
 separate plastic bag 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.880
