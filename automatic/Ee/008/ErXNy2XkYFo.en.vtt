indeed maple neck is a one-piece maple
neck<00:03:33.350> on<00:03:33.560> the<00:03:34.030> black<00:03:35.030> one<00:03:35.150> for<00:03:35.480> a<00:03:35.510> gross<00:03:35.660> one

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
neck on the black one for a gross one

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.170 
neck on the black one for a gross one
okay<00:03:36.590> one-piece<00:03:36.920> maple<00:03:37.070> neck<00:03:37.340> and<00:03:37.640> this<00:03:37.820> is<00:03:37.940> a

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
okay one-piece maple neck and this is a

00:03:38.180 --> 00:04:10.750 
okay one-piece maple neck and this is a
skunk<00:03:38.600> stripe<00:03:38.780> dropping<00:03:39.200> yes<00:03:39.500> indeed<00:03:39.830> yeah

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:10.760 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.270 

or<00:04:11.450> the<00:04:11.659> reasoning<00:04:12.019> behind<00:04:12.140> one<00:04:12.530> available<00:04:13.040> TV

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 
or the reasoning behind one available TV

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.360 
or the reasoning behind one available TV
version<00:04:13.549> is<00:04:13.879> because<00:04:14.180> they<00:04:14.840> have<00:04:15.110> the<00:04:15.409> ESP

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
version is because they have the ESP

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:18.969 
version is because they have the ESP
vintage<00:04:16.760> Plus<00:04:17.060> which<00:04:17.810> pretty<00:04:18.590> much<00:04:18.709> the<00:04:18.829> same

00:04:18.969 --> 00:04:18.979 
vintage Plus which pretty much the same

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:20.860 
vintage Plus which pretty much the same
models<00:04:19.340> except<00:04:19.880> I<00:04:20.060> say<00:04:20.239> that<00:04:20.419> they<00:04:20.540> don't<00:04:20.720> have

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
models except I say that they don't have

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.050 
models except I say that they don't have

a floor goes on on the vintage bus on

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:25.420 
a floor goes on on the vintage bus on

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430 
the ESP ones but they have a distress

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:27.919 
one vintage plus is possibly one of my

well<00:05:02.850> this<00:05:03.360> is<00:05:03.660> a<00:05:03.720> nice<00:05:04.200> slim<00:05:06.230> r/c<00:05:07.230> shape

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
well this is a nice slim r/c shape

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:11.030 
well this is a nice slim r/c shape
s-type<00:05:08.430> neck<00:05:08.820> the<00:05:09.720> fretboard<00:05:10.020> is<00:05:10.290> practically

s-type neck the fretboard is practically
flat<00:05:11.370> it<00:05:11.730> really<00:05:12.030> is<00:05:12.360> a<00:05:12.390> very<00:05:12.480> very<00:05:12.900> shallow

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:13.290 
flat it really is a very very shallow

flat it really is a very very shallow
radius<00:05:13.740> on<00:05:13.830> this<00:05:13.970> and<00:05:14.970> it's<00:05:15.540> very<00:05:16.170> easy<00:05:16.410> to

radius on this and it's very easy to

00:05:16.500 --> 00:06:07.470 
radius on this and it's very easy to
plan<00:05:16.770> how<00:05:16.890> to<00:05:16.920> say

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:07.480 

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:11.470

if you want that ST guitar that means

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:12.940 
if you want that ST guitar that means
the<00:06:11.600> brain<00:06:11.690> wants<00:06:11.900> to<00:06:12.020> go<00:06:12.140> for<00:06:12.470> excellent

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:12.950 
the brain wants to go for excellent

but one thing about ESP is that they
originated

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:36.090 
originated

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:38.180
