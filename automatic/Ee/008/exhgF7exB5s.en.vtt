few players in this Vista Krakoff who

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.460 
few players in this Vista Krakoff who
coaches<00:01:08.479> who<00:01:09.479> puts<00:01:09.750> players<00:01:09.899> into<00:01:10.320> their

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:16.410 
difficult situations the only thing is

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.290

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
for a long time Marco your value of each

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.029 
for a long time Marco your value of each
yesterday<00:02:02.579> was<00:02:02.759> out<00:02:03.000> because<00:02:03.920> he<00:02:04.920> was

00:02:05.029 --> 00:02:05.039 
yesterday was out because he was

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:07.039 
yesterday was out because he was
training<00:02:05.219> for<00:02:05.340> five<00:02:05.610> minutes<00:02:05.850> and<00:02:06.149> he<00:02:06.840> was

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
training for five minutes and he was

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.229 
training for five minutes and he was
just<00:02:07.320> feeling<00:02:07.560> it<00:02:07.740> too<00:02:07.890> much<00:02:08.009> so<00:02:08.340> there's<00:02:09.090> no

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
just feeling it too much so there's no

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:11.600 
just feeling it too much so there's no
chance<00:02:09.269> of<00:02:09.660> him<00:02:09.840> like<00:02:10.560> I<00:02:10.679> said<00:02:10.739> so<00:02:11.009> Valesky<00:02:11.400> can

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
chance of him like I said so Valesky can

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.240 
chance of him like I said so Valesky can
play<00:02:11.880> but<00:02:12.570> then<00:02:13.530> you<00:02:13.620> take<00:02:13.829> the<00:02:13.860> risk<00:02:14.130> that

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
play but then you take the risk that

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.520 
play but then you take the risk that
he's<00:02:14.489> going<00:02:14.640> to<00:02:14.700> be<00:02:14.790> out<00:02:14.820> for<00:02:15.180> very<00:02:16.019> long<00:02:16.260> time

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
he's going to be out for very long time

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:19.509 
he's going to be out for very long time
so<00:02:17.370> we<00:02:17.549> have<00:02:17.640> to<00:02:17.760> see<00:02:17.940> how<00:02:18.120> that<00:02:18.299> how<00:02:18.750> that<00:02:18.780> goes

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:19.519 
so we have to see how that how that goes

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:22.670 
so we have to see how that how that goes
who<00:02:20.519> knows<00:02:20.700> our<00:02:20.910> same<00:02:21.299> thing<00:02:21.510> maybe<00:02:22.170> it's<00:02:22.440> okay

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
who knows our same thing maybe it's okay

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.090 
who knows our same thing maybe it's okay
and<00:02:23.720> and<00:02:24.720> the<00:02:24.840> rest<00:02:25.019> is<00:02:25.140> fit<00:02:25.290> you<00:02:25.500> see<00:02:25.709> sweat<00:02:25.950> on
