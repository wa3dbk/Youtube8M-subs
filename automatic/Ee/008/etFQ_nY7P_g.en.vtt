monorail<00:02:28.120> also<00:02:28.810> uses<00:02:29.250> regenerative<00:02:30.250> braking

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
monorail also uses regenerative braking

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:31.830 
monorail also uses regenerative braking
to<00:02:30.940> save<00:02:31.240> power

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
to save power

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.230 
to save power
however<00:02:32.620> unlike<00:02:33.220> an<00:02:33.400> electric<00:02:33.790> car<00:02:34.030> the

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
monorail has no battery pack so the

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.750 
monorail has no battery pack so the
power<00:02:37.360> is<00:02:37.690> returned<00:02:38.290> to<00:02:38.410> the<00:02:38.530> grid<00:02:38.830> where<00:02:39.459> the

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
power is returned to the grid where the

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.670 
power is returned to the grid where the
next<00:02:40.150> train<00:02:40.360> coming<00:02:40.690> along<00:02:40.930> can<00:02:41.230> pick<00:02:41.440> it<00:02:41.560> up

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
next train coming along can pick it up

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.479 
next train coming along can pick it up
and<00:02:41.890> use<00:02:42.070> it<00:02:43.590> the<00:02:44.590> main<00:02:44.739> thing<00:02:44.920> is<00:02:45.040> the<00:02:45.160> safety

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
and use it the main thing is the safety

here was a huge piece of kit that looks
straight<00:03:09.489> out<00:03:09.670> of<00:03:09.700> a<00:03:09.910> sci-fi<00:03:10.150> movie<00:03:10.360> set<00:03:10.870> but

was<00:03:26.530> very<00:03:26.890> cooperative<00:03:27.190> and<00:03:27.640> we<00:03:28.060> gotta<00:03:28.329> run

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
was very cooperative and we gotta run

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:33.600 
was very cooperative and we gotta run
all<00:03:28.870> the<00:03:29.320> waiters<00:03:29.500> ad<00:03:31.680> so<00:03:32.680> VBox<00:03:33.100> booted<00:03:33.459> up

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
all the waiters ad so VBox booted up

all the waiters ad so VBox booted up
long<00:03:34.269> straight<00:03:34.660> ahead<00:03:34.989> we<00:03:35.500> hit<00:03:35.769> the<00:03:35.920> trigger

the three drops blow we can feel the

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:11.850 
fast it is the monorail is the future

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.360 
fast it is the monorail is the future
public<00:04:12.330> transportation<00:04:13.020> and<00:04:13.200> we<00:04:13.830> absolutely

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
public transportation and we absolutely

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.300 
public transportation and we absolutely
love<00:04:15.030> it
