00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.480
 in our kickbox training for children 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.310
 we offer kickboxing as well 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.450
 self-defense and self-assertion 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.830
 so that the children are easy in theirs 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:23.350
 social environment a bit 

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:26.340
 can show a little bit more safely 

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:26.340
 to get self-confidence 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.200
 With us you can already with four years 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:45.629
 start with the kick box training 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.030
 it's all a bit more based then 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.190
 Do not play with contact of course 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.809
 and the older children are seven to 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.730
 Twelve years then it 's already on 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:58.040
 a bit with gloves and also with 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.040
 contact is then wrestled and fought 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.780
 Yes 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.939
 So to the children's training here too 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:16.100
 You do not really need to do that 

00:01:13.939 --> 00:01:17.630
 special physical abilities that 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.340
 is one who taught me get 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.869
 the children here make many children 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.259
 by the way also other sports 

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:26.240
 but most of all, the children learn each other 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:27.140
 Here, of course, to move the condition 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.450
 to train 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.560
 the reaction the balance and the 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.560
 is taught in all here 

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.430
 instead of 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.409
 the action factor at our 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.000
 Childrens training is very high we have 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:52.280
 many games we work with 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.409
 many tools with ropes 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.270
 You can always practice that way 

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:57.710
 make sure that the children are completely fix and 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.970
 everyone is one but it can also be relaxed 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.649
 and very technical 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.159
 that will always be alternated in 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:03.159
 best case 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.970
 Of course we pay attention to child training 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.760
 that the risk of injury 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.470
 minimal means that we do not go 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.790
 on contact the children are allowed of course 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.260
 do not hit the face 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:28.349
 It can happen that a child 

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.349
 but this is relatively rare 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.720
 we teach the children very clearly 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.730
 that the things you learn here 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.560
 not to be applied at the schoolyard 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:49.510
 if they prove they can walk around and 

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:52.510
 any other members or 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.910
 other students beat the children 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:55.870
 learn to say loud no we learn 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.250
 running away 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.530
 you learn the most important emergency numbers 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:03.750
 and so what in emergency situations or 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.750
 sweetmeat situation is helpful 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:21.980
 special clothes are needed by the children 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.320
 not just normal with us 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.670
 t shirt normal sports pants that you are 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.500
 we can exercise without moving 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:29.180
 shoes and also without socks have the 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.890
 children better stop on the ground here 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.890
 It's better not to be able to bring the kids anything with them 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:50.090
 children who start here will become 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:52.540
 most likely no kick 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:54.590
 boxing professionals and later standing in the ring and 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:57.230
 get the tens of thousands for a fight 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:58.940
 Parents do not get that far 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.290
 investment in euros again but 

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:02.920
 hopefully then at home too 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.920
 behavior of the child
