 This tutorial will show how to attach the braid to the earflap hat on the cover. 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.512

00:00:11.512 --> 00:00:15.548
 I work with spinning yarns. 

00:00:15.548 --> 00:00:19.248
 There are approximately 40 inches. 

00:00:19.248 --> 00:00:21.989
 102 centimeters. 

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:25.960
 You can make them as long as you wish. 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.096
 I work with six branches altogether. 

00:00:29.096 --> 00:00:31.464
 I want to wrap it in half. 

00:00:31.464 --> 00:00:36.338
 The ends will meet at first. 

00:00:36.338 --> 00:00:44.512
 I'm going to find the center down here in the ear section and put my crochet through like this. 

00:00:44.512 --> 00:00:51.317
 And they all may not pass at once. So you may have to do it individually. 

00:00:51.317 --> 00:01:02.758
 Pull the point halfway through and then just pull through one such side. 

00:01:02.758 --> 00:01:16.075
 You will need to equate them and make sure the ends are identical. The ends do not have to be perfect. 

00:01:16.075 --> 00:01:20.180
 You can cut them off until later. 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:28.621
 The yarn will be divided into four sections. 

00:01:28.621 --> 00:01:32.959
 There is the first section, there is the second section, this is the third. 

00:01:32.959 --> 00:02:13.467
 And then they will start braiding them. 

00:02:13.467 --> 00:02:16.070
 Now I'm down here at the end. 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:24.358
 What I'm going to do is make a knot and I just fold the ends over. 

00:02:24.358 --> 00:02:31.117
 And put it through like this. 

00:02:31.117 --> 00:02:38.104
 Then make a knot like that. 

00:02:38.104 --> 00:02:45.298
 Then pull it warm. 

00:02:45.298 --> 00:02:48.335
 Then you can cut all of the ends off up. 

00:02:48.335 --> 00:02:53.012
 Some of the mines are not up but that's all right. 

00:02:53.012 --> 09:59:59.000
 that simple !
