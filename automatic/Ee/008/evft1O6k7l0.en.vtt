00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:04.250
 ah 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.330
 very good kids we started with a 

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:18.820
 new minecraft video and today I'm going to 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:21.130
 show you how to use them the commands 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.810
 to put in creative mode then 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.939
 to be able to use such commands what 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:27.939
 what we have to do is when we 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:30.220
 we create a new world activate the 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:32.200
 tricks as you see here in this tab you 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:34.000
 We accept that we will create a new 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.730
 world then in survival mode and 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.380
 we are going to put tricks activated by 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.380
 example of title tricks 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.090
 assets 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.850
 ok we give you to create a new world 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.630
 We wait a second I hope not 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:54.110
 late, let's see 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:57.680
 come generate you is that when you are recording 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:01:00.110
 it always always takes a little bit longer 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.590
 perfect and we are already generated 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:05.170
 a new world 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.090
 and now if we give the key as 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.650
 You see, the creative mode is not set 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:13.990
 but if we press the t key 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.540
 then we use the button bar 7 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:18.880
 this bar lying to the right and 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:22.060
 we write everything together and in lowercase 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:25.119
 game mode 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.380
 space and a 1 we give to enter and it puts 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:28.210
 Your game mode has been updated 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:32.350
 then and now I give to the 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:35.399
 I am as you see it creatively if 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:38.900
 what I want is to put in mode 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:41.060
 adventures I give to the tea 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:46.850
 I give it to the bar and write 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:50.420
 again game mode and space a 2 and 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:52.310
 with this I am in the adventure mode that 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.460
 it's this mode where I can only break 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.560
 certain things for example this I can 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.230
 break the grass I can break the 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.120
 leaves I think of the trees not the leaves 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:05.000
 not for example can I break the grass 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:06.980
 certain things and others not as is the 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.390
 case of certain servers for example 

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:10.910
 of the 'hunger games ' that are in 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:14.080
 that way is worth what happens if I want 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:17.810
 return to normal mode to survival mode 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:19.340
 it is worth again I give it to beats and 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.140
 you will be saying good but it is 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.750
 that I scratch enough to have to write 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.660
 every time I want to change mode 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.860
 Well, if you hit the little arrows 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.600
 our keyboard you give up 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.060
 so he puts the last you have been 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.860
 If you give again the only previous 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.680
 you will have to change this one for a 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:39.440
 zero and with this you will go to the mode 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.910
 You can also do survival with the 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.640
 key s 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:46.340
 So if you use a zero as s is 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.710
 It updates you again and you get 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.020
 the survival mode as you see now 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:53.750
 I can break the blocks is perfect 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:57.650
 but many of you will be thinking and what happens 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:03:00.050
 If I already have a created world and I have not 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:03.500
 activated the tricks when when I generate 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:05.000
 that world is worth it for that I'm going to 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.070
 explain now what you will have to do 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.340
 so what I'm going to do is one thing 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:12.800
 I will save and exit and I will create a 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.810
 new world but this time without tricks 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:19.330
 as you see here the tricks are 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.330
 deactivated okay then let's create 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:27.420
 a world without tricks world without tricks 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:29.300
 It is worth creating a new world we hope for a 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:32.820
 I hope it does not take long 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:34.380
 let's see come hurry I'm 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:37.070
 recording 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.070
 come on 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:43.590
 perfect, since we're in a new 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:46.569
 world would make it a tad because it is 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:49.870
 logical is generating perfect vale 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:52.719
 well after this brief screenshot 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:58.180
 let's check that the 

00:03:52.719 --> 00:04:00.310
 tricks then gamen mode 1 you do not have 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.810
 permission to use this command is worth 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.599
 obviously you do not have permission because 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.250
 As we have seen, I do not have activated 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:09.430
 the tricks then I have to do 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:12.969
 I give to escape and here where it says open 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:16.269
 in land I give to allow tricks and 

00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:21.190
 start a world in land is it worth now 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:23.060
 I give the key t and write the 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:25.070
 command from before 

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:27.080
 your game mode is updated and how 

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:28.970
 you see I'm already in creative mode and I have not 

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:31.280
 had to generate a new world so 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:34.040
 that I can take advantage of the world that 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.750
 had to play in creative mode without 

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:39.350
 have to lose all things and 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:42.800
 start again fine as you have seen 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:45.180
 I managed to activate the tricks with the 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:48.690
 option is to open 

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:50.789
 open the game on land that is something that 

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:52.830
 I will explain in the next video and 

00:04:50.789 --> 00:04:54.840
 that with this option we can play with 

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.669
 other friends who are in the same room 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.780
 that we sharing the router without 

00:04:56.669 --> 00:05:01.210
 Need to 

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.800
 to use any server that is 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.720
 when you play with your friends in your 

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:07.570
 house you do not need to create a server 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:10.150
 you can play in the cndh using 

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:11.830
 your own router could then 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.900
 explain it in this video but maybe 

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:15.520
 be messy and apart that people 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.950
 usually looking for things by the 

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:19.870
 title of the video for example you want 

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:22.360
 know how to put in creative well how 

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:25.840
 put in creative mode as well 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:28.930
 surely what you read is the title that 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:30.550
 of the video that puts that and if in some 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:32.350
 another video says it in the middle but not 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:36.610
 He puts it in the title because people are not 

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:38.650
 guess and he's not going to see the 

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:40.480
 infinite videos that there are no hanging 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:42.880
 on youtube from minecraft so it has 

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:44.289
 it seemed more reasonable that I make a video 

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:47.069
 separated 

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:50.649
 to explain well how you can do 

00:05:47.069 --> 00:05:52.809
 to play in multiplayer without need 

00:05:50.649 --> 00:05:55.149
 of server as long as then 

00:05:52.809 --> 00:05:57.219
 you find in the same room as you and your 

00:05:55.149 --> 00:06:00.009
 friends who want to play everything is good 

00:05:57.219 --> 00:06:02.169
 If you have been interested in this thing that I have 

00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:03.849
 commented on playing in multiplayer 

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:06.099
 this way we are looking forward to the next 

00:06:03.849 --> 00:06:08.529
 video and nothing with this I 'm going to 

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:10.930
 dismiss I hope you liked this 

00:06:08.529 --> 00:06:13.089
 video I hope you have been great 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:14.740
 help and nothing that we see in the next 

00:06:13.089 --> 00:06:18.039
 videos that tell me any questions 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:20.169
 that you have or if you know of some trick or 

00:06:18.039 --> 00:06:21.909
 anything like something that serves to 

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:23.919
 make a tutorial some ship some 

00:06:21.909 --> 00:06:26.289
 glitch or others so do not hesitate 

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:30.059
 tell me in comments and that nothing 

00:06:26.289 --> 00:06:30.059
 see you in future videos bye bye
