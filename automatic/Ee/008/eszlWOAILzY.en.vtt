the<00:00:44.920> gold<00:00:45.100> standard<00:00:45.339> that's<00:00:45.699> what<00:00:45.909> I<00:00:45.940> would

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.030 
the gold standard that's what I would

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.090 
the gold standard that's what I would
certainly<00:00:46.809> favor<00:00:47.230> the<00:00:47.469> other<00:00:47.589> way<00:00:47.739> of<00:00:47.769> sort<00:00:48.039> of

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:48.100 
certainly favor the other way of sort of

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.559 
certainly favor the other way of sort of
chaos<00:00:48.429> where<00:00:48.699> there's<00:00:48.909> sort<00:00:49.149> of<00:00:49.239> sequential

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:49.569 
chaos where there's sort of sequential

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:51.630 
chaos where there's sort of sequential
collapse<00:00:50.050> of<00:00:50.559> paper<00:00:50.829> currencies<00:00:51.370> and<00:00:51.519> then

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:51.640 
collapse of paper currencies and then

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.669 
collapse of paper currencies and then
you<00:00:51.730> go<00:00:51.879> to<00:00:51.940> gold<00:00:52.179> on<00:00:52.359> a<00:00:52.390> more<00:00:52.629> emergency<00:00:53.260> basis

00:00:53.669 --> 00:00:53.679 
you go to gold on a more emergency basis

00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:55.559 
you go to gold on a more emergency basis
but<00:00:54.339> either<00:00:54.460> way<00:00:54.699> you've<00:00:54.850> got<00:00:54.879> to<00:00:55.120> reconcile

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:55.569 
but either way you've got to reconcile

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:57.750 
but either way you've got to reconcile
the<00:00:55.780> price<00:00:56.170> of<00:00:56.350> gold<00:00:56.379> to<00:00:56.679> the<00:00:56.829> to<00:00:57.489> the<00:00:57.519> money

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
the price of gold to the to the money

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.579 
the price of gold to the to the money
supply<00:00:57.940> and<00:00:58.149> it's<00:00:58.899> it's<00:00:59.199> eighth-grade<00:00:59.559> math

00:00:59.579 --> 00:00:59.589 
supply and it's it's eighth-grade math

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:01.049 
supply and it's it's eighth-grade math
there's<00:00:59.979> nothing<00:01:00.190> complicated<00:01:00.339> about<00:01:00.729> it<00:01:00.879> but

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:01.059 
there's nothing complicated about it but

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:02.489 
there's nothing complicated about it but
when<00:01:01.149> you<00:01:01.239> do<00:01:01.329> those<00:01:01.449> ratios<00:01:01.690> those<00:01:02.350> are<00:01:02.469> the

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:02.499 
when you do those ratios those are the

00:01:02.499 --> 00:01:04.170 
when you do those ratios those are the
prices<00:01:02.739> you<00:01:02.949> get<00:01:03.219> but<00:01:03.429> in<00:01:03.519> the<00:01:03.609> Jim<00:01:03.850> Rickards

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.039 
States will still have euros and in
Europe<00:02:51.430> and<00:02:51.610> yuan<00:02:51.940> and<00:02:52.150> China<00:02:52.420> and<00:02:52.630> so<00:02:52.750> forth<00:02:52.989> I

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:53.049 
Europe and yuan and China and so forth I

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:54.300 
Europe and yuan and China and so forth I
think<00:02:53.079> that<00:02:53.380> will<00:02:53.530> continue<00:02:53.560> to<00:02:54.040> be<00:02:54.160> the<00:02:54.280> case

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
think that will continue to be the case

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.880 
think that will continue to be the case
but<00:02:55.120> it'll<00:02:55.420> be<00:02:55.450> backed<00:02:55.750> by<00:02:55.900> gold<00:02:56.170> at<00:02:56.470> some

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
but it'll be backed by gold at some

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.430 
but it'll be backed by gold at some
level<00:02:57.160> or<00:02:57.310> I<00:02:57.640> think<00:02:58.150> what<00:02:58.299> the<00:02:58.510> what<00:02:58.989> the<00:02:59.019> IMF

00:02:59.430 --> 00:02:59.440 
level or I think what the what the IMF

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.830 
level or I think what the what the IMF
you<00:02:59.590> think<00:02:59.769> we're<00:02:59.890> going<00:03:00.040> back<00:03:00.660> it's<00:03:01.660> one

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
you think we're going back it's one

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.300 
you think we're going back it's one
possibility<00:03:02.319> i<00:03:02.500> think<00:03:02.709> what<00:03:02.860> the<00:03:03.010> the

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
possibility i think what the the

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:05.160 
possibility i think what the the
apparently<00:03:03.730> truly<00:03:04.060> one<00:03:04.239> is<00:03:04.450> is<00:03:04.629> the<00:03:04.840> SDR

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.170 
apparently truly one is is the SDR

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:06.990 
apparently truly one is is the SDR
standard<00:03:05.709> which<00:03:06.280> is<00:03:06.400> the<00:03:06.519> basket<00:03:06.910> of

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
standard which is the basket of

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.699 
standard which is the basket of
currencies<00:03:07.180> the<00:03:07.660> groundworks<00:03:08.260> already<00:03:08.590> been

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:10.289 
currencies the groundworks already been
laid<00:03:08.799> by<00:03:08.860> the<00:03:09.040> IMF<00:03:09.220> there<00:03:09.640> you<00:03:09.730> had<00:03:09.849> a<00:03:09.879> paper<00:03:10.120> in

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:10.299 
laid by the IMF there you had a paper in

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:12.569 
laid by the IMF there you had a paper in
january<00:03:10.780> giving<00:03:11.500> the<00:03:11.590> complete<00:03:11.950> architecture

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:14.500 
who the issuer should be who the buyer

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.380 
who the issuer should be who the buyer
should<00:03:14.829> be<00:03:15.010> settlement<00:03:15.670> clearance<00:03:16.060> if<00:03:16.209> you

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
should be settlement clearance if you

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:17.789 
should be settlement clearance if you
actually<00:03:16.480> look<00:03:16.660> at<00:03:16.900> the<00:03:16.989> the<00:03:17.379> paper<00:03:17.620> you

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
actually look at the the paper you

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:19.350 
actually look at the the paper you
probably<00:03:18.010> have<00:03:18.129> seen<00:03:18.310> it<00:03:18.489> they're<00:03:18.849> diagrams

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 
probably have seen it they're diagrams

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.970 
probably have seen it they're diagrams
showing<00:03:19.599> how<00:03:19.810> do<00:03:20.109> you<00:03:20.200> do<00:03:20.350> all<00:03:20.500> this<00:03:20.650> and<00:03:20.859> then

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
showing how do you do all this and then

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.580 
showing how do you do all this and then
leave<00:03:21.130> and<00:03:21.250> recommend<00:03:21.670> a<00:03:21.760> 200<00:03:22.209> billion<00:03:22.510> SDR<00:03:23.500> as

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
leave and recommend a 200 billion SDR as

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:24.840 
leave and recommend a 200 billion SDR as
per<00:03:23.769> your<00:03:23.920> issue<00:03:24.100> and<00:03:24.430> so<00:03:24.579> they<00:03:24.670> had<00:03:24.760> an

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:24.850 
per your issue and so they had an

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:26.250 
per your issue and so they had an
issuance<00:03:25.180> program<00:03:25.600> so<00:03:25.720> it's<00:03:25.870> a<00:03:25.930> complete

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
issuance program so it's a complete

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.559 
issuance program so it's a complete
blueprint<00:03:26.680> for<00:03:27.280> global<00:03:27.340> currency<00:03:28.209> was<00:03:28.359> less

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:28.569 
blueprint for global currency was less

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:30.569 
blueprint for global currency was less
than<00:03:28.750> the<00:03:28.870> I<00:03:28.900> uh<00:03:28.959> had<00:03:29.889> a<00:03:29.920> blueprint<00:03:30.310> that

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:30.579 
than the I uh had a blueprint that

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:35.490 
than the I uh had a blueprint that
finally<00:03:31.359> worked<00:03:31.540> out<00:03:32.609> that's<00:03:33.609> well<00:03:34.569> in<00:03:35.290> time

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
finally worked out that's well in time

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.140 
finally worked out that's well in time
is<00:03:36.389> well<00:03:37.389> they<00:03:37.510> have<00:03:38.049> the<00:03:38.139> feudal<00:03:38.709> system<00:03:39.150> but

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
is well they have the feudal system but

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.300 
is well they have the feudal system but
your<00:03:40.299> overall<00:03:40.660> point<00:03:40.959> is<00:03:41.200> I<00:03:41.230> like<00:03:42.130> how<00:03:42.250> you

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.310 
your overall point is I like how you

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:43.410 
your overall point is I like how you
approach<00:03:42.579> it<00:03:42.609> you<00:03:42.819> approach<00:03:43.090> it<00:03:43.120> from<00:03:43.239> a

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
approach it you approach it from a

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.150 
approach it you approach it from a
supply<00:03:43.750> perspective<00:03:44.380> if<00:03:44.470> the<00:03:44.620> world<00:03:44.799> is<00:03:45.010> awash

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:45.160 
supply perspective if the world is awash

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.250 
supply perspective if the world is awash
with<00:03:45.400> liquidity<00:03:46.000> as<00:03:46.299> many<00:03:46.569> of<00:03:46.720> the<00:03:46.870> Bulls<00:03:47.049> used

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260

to say but the world's really awash with

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.390 
to say but the world's really awash with
liquidity<00:03:49.329> of<00:03:49.569> fiat<00:03:49.989> currencies<00:03:50.620> but<00:03:50.919> you

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
liquidity of fiat currencies but you

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.849 
liquidity of fiat currencies but you
have<00:03:51.669> to<00:03:51.910> look<00:03:52.299> at<00:03:52.480> the<00:03:52.510> alternative<00:03:53.500> of<00:03:53.620> the

have to look at the alternative of the

have to look at the alternative of the
fiat<00:03:54.099> currency<00:03:54.579> and<00:03:54.760> then<00:03:55.180> the

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:55.299 
fiat currency and then the

you think it's gold or SD ours from the

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.530 
you think it's gold or SD ours from the
IMF<00:03:59.139> the<00:03:59.680> point<00:03:59.919> is<00:04:00.099> that<00:04:00.130> if<00:04:00.639> you've<00:04:00.819> abused<00:04:01.299> a

IMF the point is that if you've abused a

huge percentage of the total basket

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:04.920 
huge percentage of the total basket
you're<00:04:03.970> gonna<00:04:04.090> pay<00:04:04.329> for<00:04:04.569> it<00:04:04.599> and<00:04:04.720> there<00:04:04.780> will

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
you're gonna pay for it and there will

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.289 
you're gonna pay for it and there will

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.599 
whose economies are not being managed
well<00:04:13.959> so<00:04:14.230> but<00:04:14.500> isn't<00:04:14.650> the<00:04:14.769> SDR<00:04:15.040> just<00:04:15.400> another

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:15.609 
well so but isn't the SDR just another

00:04:15.609 --> 00:04:17.460 
well so but isn't the SDR just another
way<00:04:15.880> of<00:04:15.910> rearranging<00:04:16.780> the<00:04:16.900> deck<00:04:17.079> chairs<00:04:17.109> on
