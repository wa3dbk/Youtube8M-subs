a strong party though strong party you
can't<00:01:12.479> do<00:01:12.630> with<00:01:12.780> randoms<00:01:13.200> unless<00:01:13.950> all<00:01:14.189> y'all

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
can't do with randoms unless all y'all

can't do with randoms unless all y'all
talk<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:15.119> communicate<00:01:15.360> about<00:01:15.840> it<00:01:15.990> but<00:01:16.710> most

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
talk and communicate about it but most

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:18.830 
talk and communicate about it but most
likely<00:01:17.549> if<00:01:17.820> you<00:01:17.880> try<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.090> do<00:01:18.180> it<00:01:18.299> randoms<00:01:18.689> it's
