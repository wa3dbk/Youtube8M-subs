something<00:02:47.160> you<00:02:47.940> will<00:02:48.180> probably<00:02:48.420> not<00:02:48.810> find<00:02:49.520> so

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
something you will probably not find so

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:53.270

quickly<00:02:50.880> again<00:02:51.090> in<00:02:51.239> another<00:02:51.720> family<00:02:52.140> but<00:02:53.010> I

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
quickly again in another family but I

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.250 
quickly again in another family but I
think<00:02:54.060> it's<00:02:54.180> a<00:02:54.239> combination<00:02:54.510> that<00:02:54.780> you<00:02:54.989> you

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
think it's a combination that you you

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.140 
think it's a combination that you you
know<00:02:55.380> you<00:02:55.440> will<00:02:55.739> never<00:02:55.950> succeed<00:02:56.700> in<00:02:56.940> what<00:02:57.060> you

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
know you will never succeed in what you

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.270 
know you will never succeed in what you
do<00:02:57.239> if<00:02:57.360> you<00:02:57.420> don't<00:02:57.620> practice<00:02:58.620> or<00:02:58.980> have

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.569 
rebellion I started with the piano so
that<00:03:30.480> was<00:03:30.689> my<00:03:30.810> first<00:03:30.959> instrument<00:03:31.439> and<00:03:31.650> I<00:03:32.370> still

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:32.579 
that was my first instrument and I still

00:03:32.579 --> 00:03:34.759 
that was my first instrument and I still
do<00:03:32.790> play<00:03:33.000> a<00:03:33.030> piano<00:03:33.390> I<00:03:33.480> enjoy<00:03:34.409> that<00:03:34.530> very<00:03:34.590> much

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:34.769 
do play a piano I enjoy that very much

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:36.860 
do play a piano I enjoy that very much
and<00:03:35.430> then<00:03:35.849> my<00:03:36.030> second<00:03:36.329> interment<00:03:36.599> was<00:03:36.720> the

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
and then my second interment was the

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.660 
and then my second interment was the
cello<00:03:37.079> actually<00:03:37.650> so<00:03:37.769> the<00:03:37.859> clarinet<00:03:38.189> was<00:03:38.340> the

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:38.670 
cello actually so the clarinet was the

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:43.250 
cello actually so the clarinet was the
last<00:03:38.939> stop<00:03:39.810> for<00:03:39.840> me<00:03:40.170> I<00:03:41.450> hope<00:03:42.450> so<00:03:42.659> you<00:03:43.109> never

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:43.260 
last stop for me I hope so you never

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.129 
last stop for me I hope so you never
know<00:03:43.500> what's<00:03:43.680> what's<00:03:43.859> gonna<00:03:44.010> come<00:03:44.189> next<00:03:44.250> but

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:45.139 
know what's what's gonna come next but

00:03:45.139 --> 00:03:48.140 
know what's what's gonna come next but
so<00:03:46.139> it<00:03:46.260> was<00:03:46.409> for<00:03:46.709> me<00:03:46.799> was<00:03:46.980> more<00:03:47.220> journey<00:03:47.549> to<00:03:47.970> the

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
so it was for me was more journey to the

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.330 
so it was for me was more journey to the
clarinet<00:03:48.510> than<00:03:48.689> now<00:03:49.379> correct<00:03:49.889> me<00:03:50.040> if<00:03:50.189> I'm

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:50.340 
clarinet than now correct me if I'm

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.550 
clarinet than now correct me if I'm
wrong<00:03:50.370> but<00:03:50.909> I<00:03:51.180> believe<00:03:51.209> there<00:03:51.780> aren't<00:03:52.230> that

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
wrong but I believe there aren't that

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.399 
wrong but I believe there aren't that
many<00:03:52.620> pieces<00:03:53.280> solo<00:03:53.790> pieces<00:03:54.329> for<00:03:54.629> the<00:03:54.720> clarinet

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
actually there are a lot in comparison

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.159 
actually there are a lot in comparison
to<00:04:02.340> of<00:04:02.760> course<00:04:03.000> the<00:04:03.120> piano<00:04:03.359> or<00:04:03.659> the<00:04:03.689> violin

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
voice that it's it's a small amount of

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:09.080 
voice that it's it's a small amount of
pieces<00:04:07.139> but<00:04:07.290> if<00:04:07.919> you<00:04:08.069> look<00:04:08.220> at<00:04:08.340> it<00:04:08.459> you<00:04:08.970> will
