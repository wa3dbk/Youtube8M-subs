00:00:06.919 --> 00:00:11.269
 we walk absent-mindedly 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:15.030
 then suddenly something attracts us 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:16.980
 what struck us beautiful bodies 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.550
 profiles and details that trigger 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.060
 adrenaline 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:23.880
 objects that we don't know of which though 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.340
 let's imagine performance 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.489
 these models are the mercedes benz 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:34.500
 also vision granturismo driven by a 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:39.620
 570 seven horse amg v8 engine is the 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.620
 secret racing 50 vision gt concept 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.329
 already passed these elegant dresses to the 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:49.930
 at the same time aggressive what is 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:56.260
 it hides like a fast boat did 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:58.269
 indeed very fast the hull must be 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.820
 very solid imagine what it means 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:03.220
 impact the waves at over 200 kilometers 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.820
 times at that speed the water e 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.820
 cement 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:11.940
 the pretty one must also be very stiff 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.590
 like the chassis of a car because of the 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:17.360
 deformations produced by speed 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.360
 they would cause an energy loss 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.590
 there is a fundamental physical principle from 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.780
 respect the boat is so much faster 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.880
 the longer its length is 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.460
 smaller its width 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:36.970
 this model is more than 15 meters long 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.970
 but it is just 240 two centimeters wide 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:43.700
 these are the basic steps 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.890
 in a racing boat already but where they must 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.110
 be positioned as an inclination 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.940
 they must have what they must all be 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.430
 to answer these questions it is necessary 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:56.710
 a great technical ability so much 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:56.710
 intuition and then endless trials 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.280
 what they are for we must not forget 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.420
 that water is a glue so we have to 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.369
 detach it from the exchange at speed 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.860
 the water does not touch this area 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.420
 here it is vaporized ie to install ae 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.200
 hence hydrodynamic resistance 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.200
 decreases 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.280
 let's go to the deep and sharp av 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.230
 serves to sell water even better at 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.600
 reduce the pitch and if it were more 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.830
 wide the waves would raise it for the 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.900
 greater importance and then it 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.110
 they would drop into the vault making it 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.110
 beat 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.950
 another battle is fought at the stern 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:41.870
 you have to make sure that the whole 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.500
 engine power and torque are 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.500
 make the most of it 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:52.090
 first, propulsion is needed 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.010
 able to withstand performance with 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.750
 thousands of horses the gears of the 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:03:03.550
 stern feet crumble quickly 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:05.110
 it takes special products which is the 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:06.670
 right finger position which 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.190
 distance must be put to which one 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:10.750
 height with which inclination between water 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.480
 when it no longer finds the pressure of the 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:16.150
 hull rises and at some point the flow 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:19.560
 it becomes more compact and faster there 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.560
 that needs to be polished 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.250
 a pitch of the helix that is the distance that 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.349
 travels in a complete rotation is 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:30.060
 fundamental for speed if we use 

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:32.040
 one step too short we don't go 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.870
 pretty fast if we use a step 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:37.670
 too long of an engine fails to 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:41.540
 reach maximum power 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:41.540
 it's just a step away from 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.830
 tell her what's in the engine 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:51.500
 car between the engine and the wheels there is the 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:53.720
 change but in pleasure boats not 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:56.090
 you use must choose only one 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.770
 relationship with which to glide the 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:02.050
 boat to bring it to maximum speed 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:02.050
 it is very difficult to find the right one 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.160
 relative to the ratio of the engines with 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:11.410
 the hull must be emphasized that it is good 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:13.720
 you believe they are very close to each other 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:15.760
 however, since the engines are large then 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:19.650
 you have to mount them this way 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:19.650
 spreads that are staggered 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:27.039
 then it is necessary that there is in the engine room 

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:30.310
 a large amount of air not just for 

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:33.129
 refresh these engines from 1,650 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:35.770
 horses each but to feed them think 

00:04:33.129 --> 00:04:38.759
 that in every minute they had dozens of 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:38.759
 thousands of liters of air 

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.160
 we have seen how complex it is 

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:10.090
 make a fast hull a know how 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.680
 completely different from that 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:12.490
 necessary for the realization of one 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.440
 yacht 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:16.870
 here the furniture makers and carpenters work 

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:18.400
 little the most important task ce 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:20.500
 have the testers who do a 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:23.310
 fun but also a lot of work 

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.310
 risky 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:30.539
 let's not forget the risk that yes 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:34.030
 runs to go fast cigarette 50 with 

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:38.229
 3,300 horses reaches 120 two knots 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:40.590
 which correspond exactly to 225 km 

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:40.590
 speed schedules 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:45.300
 the performance that is equivalent to launching 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:48.110
 a car on the track at least 400 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.110
 kilometers per hour 

00:05:48.569 --> 00:05:53.009
 having said that well if I had a million e 

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:55.580
 half dollars 

00:05:53.009 --> 00:05:55.580
 I'd buy it
