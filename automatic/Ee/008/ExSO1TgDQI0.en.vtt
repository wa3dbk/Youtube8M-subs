00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 the staff is now starting another 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.490
 Top table tips here in the fishing program 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.379
 stop for you 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.110
 this picture that he is rightly 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.519
 for it takes a bit of information to 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.259
 those people who are just 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.139
 starting then we need that 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.850
 information is to improve your 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.590
 performance in the fishery 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.580
 We're going to talk about pressure today. 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:26.760
 atmospheric is I have had getting some and 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.250
 mails from some fishermen and stayed in 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.980
 doubt in some videos that I commented 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.530
 that the fish was not attacking with 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.590
 very easy at atmospheric pressure 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.629
 was varying a lot and the staff 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.070
 asked embroidery what do you explain if 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.070
 a little bit about it 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:47.700
 good is there are some studies people who 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:50.070
 show that the very large variation in 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.730
 atmospheric pressure influencing the 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.079
 not only of the fish but also of the 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.710
 other species 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:01.770
 ie are you fishing then you 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.140
 you have to pay attention to what 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.260
 atmospheric pressure that you normally 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.689
 take a lot of haggling and come on let's go 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:13.890
 assume some atmospheric pressure in 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:17.810
 1015 then you wake up in the early morning hours the 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:20.490
 Your mythological bar is watching there 1010 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:24.570
 you will probably have a fishery 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:26.659
 11 a fishery with little attack 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.180
 fish will not be feeding well 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:33.840
 so really the influence that this 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:36.210
 atmospheric pressure causes us in the bugs 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.310
 are feeding it is too large 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:42.990
 how do you measure this 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:45.990
 Some sensors have some 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.520
 clocks that comes with a barometer is this 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.479
 is a given is the priest who comes with the 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:57.740
 barometer it has thermometer has compass 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:02:01.770
 climate barometer altimeter watch is 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:05.610
 water resistant then there are the 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:08.670
 market already several that can help you 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:11.640
 so the fisherman will talk like that not only 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.100
 de sea â€‹â€‹bass but that guy who asks 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.500
 let her work 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:18.200
 well that the sea bass is a fish that 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:21.800
 when the pressure 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:23.690
 atmospheric pressure that is stabilized and 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.930
 is that common pressure for that 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:28.730
 local it is becoming clear that it is 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:31.130
 There are places in Brazil that 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.320
 good pressures so they are different 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:37.130
 in the skin of the south and north have a 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:39.860
 very big difference but are you have 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:42.560
 that always notice the active on the day is 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.060
 excellent fishing and caught lots of fish 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.540
 So what was the impression that you 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:49.310
 I think as I've been so good in 2014 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:53.120
 so I know that the atmospheric pressure 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:55.880
 I fish there and 1,014 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.580
 It's something else that's good for us. 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:01.910
 pay close attention to I do not have 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:07.010
 a barometer I do not have is how to measure this 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:09.320
 pressure is I learned from riverside 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.570
 there is also a way for you to perceive 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.760
 whether the fish are feeding or not 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:16.850
 if you are experiencing any pressure problem 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:20.240
 it is only you to realize if the 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:22.670
 herons are eating s johara the people 

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:24.980
 not feeding if the bird is 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.990
 singing sometimes you arrive at 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.770
 fishing boat you see 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:30.710
 Bird 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:33.290
 spends feeding on the water by eating a 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:36.110
 bird singing then you already realize 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:38.390
 that the pressure is stabilized is good 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:41.420
 then probably the fish is also 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:43.340
 if fed but if you leave in the morning 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:47.960
 with a boat this has already happened a lot 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:51.050
 with me you see the stag 

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:53.930
 the guarÃ¡ also stopped everything listens 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:57.290
 no bird noise because some 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:04:00.760
 strange thing then probably the 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:03.380
 atmospheric pressure is not good and 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.990
 you 're hardly going to make a good 

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:08.540
 fishery then woke up in the morning already 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:11.540
 begins to realize past singing is 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:13.970
 seagull eating spends eating guar 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:15.400
 fear the pension would likely 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:18.049
 fish are also feeding 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:20.930
 woke up early in the morning, no noise from 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:23.690
 bird no expense collected guarÃ¡ 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:24.800
 collected Gull hardly commendation 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:27.139
 you will do 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.419
 I think there but I advise you of course 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:31.940
 buy a watch that has a sensor that 

00:04:29.419 --> 00:04:35.240
 You can always measure this. 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:37.759
 is that it is atmospheric pressure that 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:40.490
 will help a lot in your fishery 

00:04:37.759 --> 00:04:42.259
 Okay so this was another tip week 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:43.220
 Come on, we have more tips here. 

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:45.620
 foot prepare 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:50.150
 remembering if you want more 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:53.030
 fishing access there www.youtube.com bar 

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:56.120
 fishing boats are more than 250 tips and 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:58.479
 videos for you until next Saturday 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.479
 bye
