from<00:00:47.570> the<00:00:47.750> ground<00:00:47.870> to<00:00:51.940> the<00:00:52.940> lowest<00:00:53.480> part<00:00:53.750> on

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:53.900 
from the ground to the lowest part on

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.550 
from the ground to the lowest part on
the<00:00:53.990> frame<00:00:54.230> right<00:00:54.800> here<00:00:55.750> this<00:00:56.750> particular<00:00:57.320> one

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:57.560 
the frame right here this particular one

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:03.999 
the frame right here this particular one
is<00:00:58.720> 265<00:00:59.720> millimeters<00:01:01.570> so<00:01:02.570> next<00:01:02.870> you're<00:01:03.860> going

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:04.009 
is 265 millimeters so next you're going

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:07.389 
is 265 millimeters so next you're going
to<00:01:04.070> get<00:01:04.220> your<00:01:04.339> kickstand<00:01:04.789> and<00:01:05.890> your<00:01:06.890> kickstand

to get your kickstand and your kickstand

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:10.359 
to get your kickstand and your kickstand
is<00:01:07.520> graduated<00:01:08.240> on<00:01:08.390> the<00:01:08.960> back<00:01:09.140> so<00:01:10.130> you're<00:01:10.249> going

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 
is graduated on the back so you're going

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:12.389 
is graduated on the back so you're going
to<00:01:10.429> go<00:01:10.520> down<00:01:10.640> to<00:01:10.789> 265<00:01:11.749> millimeters

00:01:12.389 --> 00:01:12.399 
to go down to 265 millimeters

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:14.770 
to go down to 265 millimeters
approximately<00:01:13.399> right<00:01:13.640> there<00:01:13.939> and<00:01:14.179> with<00:01:14.749> a

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
approximately right there and with a

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.539 
approximately right there and with a
hacksaw<00:01:15.049> you're<00:01:15.590> going<00:01:15.710> to<00:01:15.770> cut<00:01:16.009> it<00:01:16.130> off<00:01:16.280> at

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:16.549 
hacksaw you're going to cut it off at

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:35.709 
hacksaw you're going to cut it off at
that<00:01:16.609> point

00:01:35.709 --> 00:01:35.719 

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:38.539 

now<00:01:36.719> when<00:01:36.899> you<00:01:36.990> cut<00:01:37.200> that<00:01:37.319> with<00:01:37.590> with<00:01:38.429> the

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
now when you cut that with with the

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.749 
now when you cut that with with the
hacksaw<00:01:38.899> these<00:01:39.899> lines<00:01:40.350> are<00:01:40.740> on<00:01:40.950> an<00:01:41.069> angle<00:01:41.579> and

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
hacksaw these lines are on an angle and

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.359 
hacksaw these lines are on an angle and
you<00:01:41.789> want<00:01:42.299> to<00:01:42.390> try<00:01:42.569> to<00:01:42.630> cut<00:01:43.049> to<00:01:43.770> follow<00:01:44.039> that

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
you want to try to cut to follow that

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.870 
you want to try to cut to follow that
angle<00:01:44.819> alright<00:01:45.689> so<00:01:45.840> once<00:01:46.049> you're<00:01:46.200> cut<00:01:46.409> off

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
angle alright so once you're cut off

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:53.260 
angle alright so once you're cut off
then<00:01:49.939> you<00:01:50.939> want<00:01:51.090> to<00:01:51.149> get<00:01:51.299> your<00:01:51.450> kickstand<00:01:51.929> and
