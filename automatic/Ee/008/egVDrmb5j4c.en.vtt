was supposed to the whole idea behind

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.710 
was supposed to the whole idea behind
Prozac<00:01:48.190> was<00:01:48.610> that<00:01:48.760> it<00:01:48.880> would<00:01:49.000> block<00:01:49.390> the

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
Prozac was that it would block the

Prozac was that it would block the

the<00:02:30.700> brain<00:02:30.910> doesn't<00:02:31.180> like<00:02:31.600> to<00:02:32.140> have<00:02:32.320> the

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
the brain doesn't like to have the

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.390 
the brain doesn't like to have the
serotonin<00:02:33.870> puddling<00:02:34.870> in<00:02:35.200> its<00:02:35.350> synapses<00:02:36.190> and

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:36.400 
serotonin puddling in its synapses and

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.950 
serotonin puddling in its synapses and
the<00:02:36.910> brain<00:02:37.210> responds<00:02:37.900> by<00:02:38.850> stopping<00:02:39.960> producing

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:40.960 
the brain responds by stopping producing

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:45.330 
the brain responds by stopping producing
serotonin<00:02:42.090> it<00:02:43.170> responds<00:02:44.170> by<00:02:44.530> increasing<00:02:45.220> its

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
serotonin it responds by increasing its

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.900 
serotonin it responds by increasing its
ability<00:02:45.850> to<00:02:46.000> remove<00:02:46.560> serotonin<00:02:47.560> it<00:02:48.040> responds

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
ability to remove serotonin it responds

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.810 
ability to remove serotonin it responds
by<00:02:49.090> becoming<00:02:49.540> less<00:02:49.900> sensitive<00:02:50.590> to<00:02:50.830> serotonin

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
by becoming less sensitive to serotonin

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.690 
by becoming less sensitive to serotonin
so<00:02:52.360> from<00:02:52.720> the<00:02:52.870> beginning<00:02:53.500> it<00:02:53.620> was<00:02:53.650> a<00:02:53.800> flim-flam

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
so from the beginning it was a flim-flam

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.110 
so from the beginning it was a flim-flam
it<00:02:55.209> was<00:02:55.540> a<00:02:55.570> PR<00:02:56.140> claim<00:02:57.010> that<00:02:57.730> you<00:02:57.940> got

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
it was a PR claim that you got

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.440 
it was a PR claim that you got
biochemical<00:02:59.020> imbalances<00:02:59.800> and<00:03:00.330> prozac's

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
biochemical imbalances and prozac's

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.390 
biochemical imbalances and prozac's
gonna<00:03:02.130> fix<00:03:03.130> it<00:03:03.720> so<00:03:04.980> what<00:03:05.980> do<00:03:06.040> you<00:03:06.160> conclude

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
gonna fix it so what do you conclude

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.410 
gonna fix it so what do you conclude
from<00:03:06.640> this<00:03:07.860> people<00:03:08.860> who<00:03:09.400> have<00:03:09.670> emotional

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.070 
our brains and if we do if some day some

our brains and if we do if some day some
of<00:03:21.190> these<00:03:21.310> problems<00:03:21.670> turn<00:03:22.510> out<00:03:22.690> to<00:03:22.900> be<00:03:22.930> caused

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
of these problems turn out to be caused

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:25.680 
of these problems turn out to be caused
by<00:03:24.100> something<00:03:24.640> going<00:03:24.940> on<00:03:25.090> in<00:03:25.300> our<00:03:25.420> brains

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
by something going on in our brains

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.039 
by something going on in our brains
rather<00:03:26.440> than<00:03:26.860> in<00:03:27.010> our<00:03:27.130> lives<00:03:27.459> in<00:03:27.940> our<00:03:28.269> emotions

in our hearts in our feelings if it

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.170 
in our hearts in our feelings if it
turns<00:03:31.570> out<00:03:31.780> to<00:03:31.989> be<00:03:32.019> so<00:03:32.549> then<00:03:33.549> psychiatric

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
turns out to be so then psychiatric

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.030 
turns out to be so then psychiatric
drugs<00:03:34.450> aren't<00:03:34.750> fixing<00:03:35.140> them<00:03:35.230> because

drugs aren't fixing them because

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.490 
drugs aren't fixing them because
psychiatric<00:03:36.910> drugs<00:03:37.239> are<00:03:37.600> causing

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
they get into the normal brain and they

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.030 
they get into the normal brain and they
change<00:03:44.140> it<00:03:44.430> whether<00:03:45.430> it's<00:03:45.959> nicotine<00:03:47.040> that

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040
