00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:08.250
 hello and welcome to a new video of 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.510
 engadget in Spanish I am elena enrÃ­quez and 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.519
 right now I am in the 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.830
 presentation in madrid of the new one in x 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.119
 300 this camera is not an authentic 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.490
 unknown to us because the 

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:19.289
 we saw in him during the past month but 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.660
 good taking advantage of his presentation in 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.099
 madrid we wanted to teach them a little bit 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.800
 more is true right now I find myself 

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:27.720
 with daniel molero that will teach us 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.659
 because they are the main characteristics 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:34.130
 of the new mirrorless house when 

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:37.800
 you want and here we have again in x 300 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:41.280
 Easy and fast sensor to PSC of 20.3 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.290
 megapixels we see obviously benefits 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.600
 differentials and that's why we were seeing 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.880
 a Usain Bolt and a camera with which 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.260
 we say that we shoot very fast and that 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.480
 we share even faster we shoot 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.640
 fast because we offer 16 thousand at the level 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.810
 of speed and up to 8.6 frames per 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.220
 second 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.170
 this combination together with a high 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.760
 sensitivity up to 25 thousand 600 convert 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.110
 this camera in a very high camera 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.940
 benefits within the segment of 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.350
 cameras without mirror or compact line 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.369
 change 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:10.890
 we also incorporate a screen amoled 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:12.840
 where we not only offer the 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.060
 possibility of defeating it but we offer 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.830
 also the possibility of shooting but 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.690
 a shot where we are going to behave 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.720
 not as if we had a camera 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:24.060
 semi-professional or professional 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.680
 really as if we had a cell phone and 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.710
 here we will see it directly with 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:32.270
 Usain where easily 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:35.990
 a mobile account in focus will select 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:37.729
 approach and is that thanks to the approach 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.250
 hybrid we incorporate the speed 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:41.570
 approach is very fast and also the 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.400
 surface giving a capacity of 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.590
 coverage of more than 100 points 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.360
 I told you that we shoot fast what 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.880
 we have tried but we are going to also 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.740
 Share fast share fast 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.630
 means today shared between 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.850
 devices we are going simply to 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.620
 connect 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.370
 the function of auto be 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:04.860
 lying 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:04.860
 let's shrink our tablet 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:12.050
 and let's activate the samsung application 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.050
 smart camera 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.920
 right now I would be connected now let's 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.960
 Testing usability is a bit challenging 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.130
 when with one hand but we're going to 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:26.850
 see , we shot him 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.850
 we wait 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:33.500
 we hope and as you can see in the 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.750
 tablet automatically they are 

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.640
 transmitting images images in 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.159
 the maximum resolution with a speed 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.450
 very high very easy because then at level 

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:43.400
 of gallery will always be a 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.230
 folder that is called auto be with the 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.540
 which we will be able to work identify 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.790
 easily an official more than what 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.319
 is smart card activity connectivity 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.790
 quick easy 

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:54.560
 with any device since the 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:58.030
 smara application is available both 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.030
 for android as for set today 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:04.040
 the million dollar question how much 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.120
 We're going to have to pay man the truth 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.780
 is that a camera with these benefits 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:11.480
 that incorporates the objective 1855 inside 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:13.300
 of the package also incorporates a small 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.549
 shoe flash to be able to 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.230
 retain the option in case of situations 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:20.810
 of low luminosity to be able to do 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:23.180
 Photo is available for sale by 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:25.099
 699 euros which is I think it's a 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:28.120
 Pretty appetizing price for all 

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:28.120
 those applied to photographs
