00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.100
your eyes are still

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.140
your smile, frozen

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.100
an absent meeting

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.740
that fills nothingness

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.700
every whisper...

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:27.520
...i hope for your voice

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:34.140
every whisper...

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:41.960
i hope for your voice

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.300
crying womb

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.260

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.560
let her slip in to my arms

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:37.480
let her come

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:44.380
every whisper...

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:50.360
...i hope for your voice

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:56.140
every whisper...

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:06.260
...i hope for your voice
