00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
got a tune I don't really understand

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.900 
got a tune I don't really understand
quite<00:00:06.960> what<00:00:07.140> that<00:00:07.170> does<00:00:07.560> a<00:00:07.859> volume<00:00:08.610> that<00:00:08.670> makes

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
quite what that does a volume that makes

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.259 
quite what that does a volume that makes
the<00:00:09.030> effing<00:00:09.510> loud<00:00:10.160> you<00:00:11.160> stop<00:00:11.490> switch<00:00:11.910> and<00:00:12.179> then

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
the effing loud you stop switch and then

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:13.940 
the effing loud you stop switch and then
the<00:00:12.420> 3-way<00:00:12.809> switch<00:00:13.080> which<00:00:13.259> I<00:00:13.410> also<00:00:13.590> don't

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
the 3-way switch which I also don't

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.230 
the 3-way switch which I also don't
really<00:00:14.160> understand<00:00:14.820> but<00:00:14.910> it<00:00:15.120> definitely

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
really understand but it definitely

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.000 
really understand but it definitely
makes<00:00:15.630> it<00:00:15.780> sound<00:00:15.960> different<00:00:16.170> the<00:00:16.920> other

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
makes it sound different the other

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.560 
makes it sound different the other

this<00:00:30.360> is<00:00:30.539> a<00:00:30.570> top<00:00:31.350> switch<00:00:31.680> on<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:32.009> Mantis

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:16.720 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.290 

you<00:01:17.680> can<00:01:17.800> see<00:01:17.950> it's<00:01:18.070> important<00:01:18.520> to<00:01:18.580> you<00:01:18.760> played

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:19.300 
you can see it's important to you played

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.990 
you can see it's important to you played
very<00:01:19.510> cleanly<00:01:19.810> and<00:01:20.470> pretty<00:01:21.130> chaotic<00:01:21.370> even<00:01:21.910> if

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.000 
very cleanly and pretty chaotic even if

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.330 
very cleanly and pretty chaotic even if
you<00:01:22.120> do<00:01:22.270> this<00:01:23.110> is<00:01:23.320> the<00:01:23.530> middle<00:01:23.860> position<00:01:23.980> with

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:24.340 
you do this is the middle position with

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:32.540 
you do this is the middle position with
a<00:01:24.370> certain<00:01:24.670> life

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:32.550 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:02:05.370 

it's<00:01:32.970> pretty<00:01:33.210> good

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:30.550 

position<00:02:06.380> three<00:02:06.649> on<00:02:06.829> the<00:02:06.950> 3wa

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.230 

if<00:02:31.560> you<00:02:31.650> play<00:02:31.860> cards<00:02:32.250> it<00:02:32.370> just<00:02:32.520> goes<00:02:32.670> into<00:02:32.819> pure

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
if you play cards it just goes into pure

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:55.500 
if you play cards it just goes into pure
chaos<00:02:33.480> basically

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.760 

but<00:02:56.510> the<00:02:56.600> really<00:02:56.810> cool<00:02:56.840> thing<00:02:57.020> i<00:02:57.290> found<00:02:57.500> is<00:02:57.650> if

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:57.770 
but the really cool thing i found is if

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:59.380 
but the really cool thing i found is if
you<00:02:57.890> use<00:02:58.040> this<00:02:58.190> filter<00:02:58.670> and<00:02:58.700> i<00:02:59.000> any

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
you use this filter and i any

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.360 
you use this filter and i any
sample-and-hold<00:02:59.900> ado<00:03:00.380> this<00:03:00.500> is<00:03:00.710> just<00:03:01.040> all<00:03:01.190> I

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
sample-and-hold ado this is just all I

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:24.850 
sample-and-hold ado this is just all I
have

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.080 

obviously<00:03:25.860> that's<00:03:26.010> a<00:03:26.100> little<00:03:26.250> random<00:03:26.430> -<00:03:26.820> but

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
obviously that's a little random - but

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:32.200 
obviously that's a little random - but
that's<00:03:27.270> not<00:03:27.510> fun<00:03:27.720> home<00:03:28.940> I'm<00:03:29.940> gonna<00:03:30.060> turn<00:03:30.240> it

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:32.210 
that's not fun home I'm gonna turn it

00:03:32.210 --> 00:04:39.429 
that's not fun home I'm gonna turn it
off

00:04:39.429 --> 00:04:39.439 

00:04:39.439 --> 00:05:16.550 

really<00:04:40.439> changes<00:04:40.889> the<00:04:41.009> operation

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.220 

those<00:05:17.560> are<00:05:17.740> two<00:05:17.890> and<00:05:17.980> all<00:05:18.070> the<00:05:18.160> way<00:05:18.220> down

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:19.230 
those are two and all the way down

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:25.530 
those are two and all the way down
slightly<00:05:20.230> more<00:05:21.000> I<00:05:22.000> don't<00:05:22.840> know<00:05:23.020> control
