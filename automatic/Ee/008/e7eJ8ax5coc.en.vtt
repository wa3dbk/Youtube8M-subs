welcome<00:00:08.130> to<00:00:08.250> my<00:00:08.340> unboxing<00:00:08.639> of<00:00:08.940> the<00:00:09.059> 990<00:00:09.660> x8<00:00:10.050> ud3

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
welcome to my unboxing of the 990 x8 ud3

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.190 
welcome to my unboxing of the 990 x8 ud3
this<00:00:11.129> is<00:00:11.280> a<00:00:11.370> 2011<00:00:12.059> performance<00:00:12.450> motherboard

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
this is a 2011 performance motherboard

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.499 
this is a 2011 performance motherboard
see<00:00:13.469> very<00:00:14.129> strange<00:00:14.549> way<00:00:14.730> to<00:00:14.760> brand<00:00:15.030> it<00:00:15.269> given

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
see very strange way to brand it given

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.870 
see very strange way to brand it given
that<00:00:15.719> the<00:00:16.439> bulldozer<00:00:16.770> CPUs<00:00:17.430> are<00:00:17.640> fully

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
that the bulldozer CPUs are fully

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.200 
that the bulldozer CPUs are fully
supported<00:00:18.390> by<00:00:18.420> this<00:00:18.570> particular<00:00:19.230> board<00:00:19.500> so

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:20.210 
supported by this particular board so

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.380 
supported by this particular board so
it'll<00:00:21.210> perform<00:00:21.390> just<00:00:21.720> fine<00:00:21.810> in<00:00:22.140> 2012<00:00:22.800> as<00:00:22.980> well

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:23.390 
it'll perform just fine in 2012 as well

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.200 
it'll perform just fine in 2012 as well
so<00:00:24.390> yeah<00:00:24.510> ok<00:00:24.900> moving<00:00:25.590> on<00:00:25.830> unlock<00:00:26.670> performance

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
so yeah ok moving on unlock performance

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.970 
so yeah ok moving on unlock performance

try and get that over there there
alright<00:01:58.020> let's<00:01:58.440> have<00:01:58.530> a<00:01:58.650> look<00:01:58.830> at<00:01:59.010> the

00:01:59.210 --> 00:01:59.220 
alright let's have a look at the

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.120 
alright let's have a look at the
motherboard<00:01:59.670> itself<00:02:00.270> so<00:02:00.900> this<00:02:01.110> is<00:02:01.650> a<00:02:01.830> pretty

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
motherboard itself so this is a pretty

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.090 
motherboard itself so this is a pretty
typical<00:02:02.370> gigabyte<00:02:03.229> AMD<00:02:04.229> platforms

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
typical gigabyte AMD platforms

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.610 
typical gigabyte AMD platforms
motherboards<00:02:05.760> color<00:02:06.000> scheme<00:02:06.360> so<00:02:06.870> we<00:02:07.049> have<00:02:07.320> a

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:07.620 
motherboards color scheme so we have a

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:12.229 
motherboards color scheme so we have a
blue<00:02:08.069> PCB<00:02:09.019> with<00:02:10.019> white<00:02:11.009> and<00:02:11.280> how<00:02:11.819> does<00:02:11.879> the

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
blue PCB with white and how does the

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:13.480 
blue PCB with white and how does the
looks

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
looks

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.290 
looks
there<00:02:14.240> we<00:02:14.360> go<00:02:14.750> slots<00:02:15.710> there<00:02:16.280> we<00:02:16.460> are<00:02:16.490> so<00:02:17.060> we

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
there we go slots there we are so we

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.380 
there we go slots there we are so we
have<00:02:17.390> a<00:02:17.420> black<00:02:18.610> CPU<00:02:19.610> socket<00:02:20.060> that<00:02:20.210> means

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
have a black CPU socket that means

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.080 
have a black CPU socket that means
