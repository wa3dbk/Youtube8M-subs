the<00:00:02.790> first<00:00:02.970> time<00:00:03.179> I've<00:00:03.300> written<00:00:03.449> this<00:00:03.659> GSR

00:00:04.599 --> 00:00:04.609 
the first time I've written this GSR

00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:06.980 
the first time I've written this GSR
it's<00:00:05.609> got<00:00:05.730> a<00:00:05.759> very<00:00:05.940> similar<00:00:06.210> riding<00:00:06.629> position

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
it's got a very similar riding position

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.810 
it's got a very similar riding position
to<00:00:07.109> metal<00:00:07.410> oh<00:00:07.500> no<00:00:07.740> it's<00:00:07.919> so<00:00:08.189> it's<00:00:08.519> quite<00:00:08.700> an

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
to metal oh no it's so it's quite an

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.820 
to metal oh no it's so it's quite an
aggressive<00:00:08.910> riding<00:00:09.540> position<00:00:10.050> for<00:00:10.230> a<00:00:10.290> naked

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
aggressive riding position for a naked

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.629 
aggressive riding position for a naked
I<00:00:11.960> think<00:00:12.960> the<00:00:13.080> Bandit<00:00:13.469> 650b<00:00:14.070> a<00:00:14.250> little<00:00:14.519> bit

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
I think the Bandit 650b a little bit

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.129 
I think the Bandit 650b a little bit
more<00:00:14.790> comfortable<00:00:15.240> but<00:00:15.570> this<00:00:15.690> has<00:00:15.809> got<00:00:15.960> the

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
more comfortable but this has got the

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.670 
more comfortable but this has got the
slightly<00:00:16.619> higher<00:00:16.890> pegs<00:00:17.250> and<00:00:18.320> the<00:00:19.320> slightly

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
slightly higher pegs and the slightly

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.759 
slightly higher pegs and the slightly
lower<00:00:19.949> VARs<00:00:20.480> but<00:00:21.480> the<00:00:21.630> engines<00:00:22.020> silky<00:00:22.500> smooth

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
lower VARs but the engines silky smooth

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.640 
lower VARs but the engines silky smooth
on<00:00:22.949> it<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.460> gearbox<00:00:23.970> is<00:00:24.150> fantastic<00:00:24.869> the

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
on it the gearbox is fantastic the

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.019 
on it the gearbox is fantastic the
brakes<00:00:25.949> are<00:00:26.130> phenomenal<00:00:26.640> but<00:00:26.760> it's<00:00:26.880> also

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
brakes are phenomenal but it's also

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.150 
brakes are phenomenal but it's also
quite<00:00:27.420> an<00:00:27.539> easy<00:00:27.689> bike<00:00:28.050> to<00:00:28.289> ride<00:00:28.470> I'm<00:00:28.769> surprised

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
quite an easy bike to ride I'm surprised

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.580 
quite an easy bike to ride I'm surprised
I<00:00:29.550> thought<00:00:30.330> it<00:00:30.480> would<00:00:30.599> be<00:00:30.660> a<00:00:30.689> lot<00:00:30.869> sharper<00:00:31.199> and

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
I thought it would be a lot sharper and

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.080 
I thought it would be a lot sharper and
aggressive<00:00:32.009> than<00:00:32.160> the<00:00:32.309> more<00:00:32.610> shot<00:00:32.880> for<00:00:32.910> an

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
aggressive than the more shot for an

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.670 
aggressive than the more shot for an
aggressive<00:00:33.300> than<00:00:33.600> this<00:00:33.719> but<00:00:33.870> it's<00:00:34.050> not<00:00:36.680> the

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
aggressive than this but it's not the

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.819 
aggressive than this but it's not the
clutch<00:00:37.920> is<00:00:38.070> nice<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.610> lights<00:00:38.730> on<00:00:38.969> it<00:00:39.829> say

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
clutch is nice and the lights on it say

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.959 
clutch is nice and the lights on it say
the<00:00:40.950> gearbox<00:00:41.340> is<00:00:41.489> really<00:00:41.850> really<00:00:42.090> sweet

00:00:43.959 --> 00:00:43.969 
the gearbox is really really sweet

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:46.340 
the gearbox is really really sweet
enough<00:00:44.969> to<00:00:45.120> see<00:00:45.270> what<00:00:45.390> it's<00:00:45.510> like<00:00:45.629> on<00:00:45.870> par<00:00:46.110> when

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
enough to see what it's like on par when

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.840 
enough to see what it's like on par when
I<00:00:46.379> open<00:00:46.649> it<00:00:46.770> up<00:00:46.860> I<00:00:47.100> think<00:00:47.309> these<00:00:47.430> have<00:00:47.610> got<00:00:47.730> over

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
I open it up I think these have got over

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.660 
I open it up I think these have got over
90<00:00:48.329> horsepower<00:00:48.450> which<00:00:49.020> is<00:00:49.200> about<00:00:50.070> 20<00:00:50.550> more

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
90 horsepower which is about 20 more

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.430 
90 horsepower which is about 20 more
than<00:00:50.879> the<00:00:50.940> 650<00:00:51.480> bandy<00:00:51.809> that's<00:00:51.989> quite<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.199> lot<00:00:52.410> of

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
than the 650 bandy that's quite a lot of

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:58.189 
than the 650 bandy that's quite a lot of
power<00:00:56.000> you<00:00:57.000> know<00:00:57.030> I<00:00:57.149> might<00:00:57.360> buy<00:00:57.539> myself<00:00:57.750> a<00:00:58.020> mini

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
power you know I might buy myself a mini

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.480 
power you know I might buy myself a mini
ball<00:00:58.379> so<00:00:58.590> can<00:00:58.770> use<00:00:58.920> boss<00:00:59.129> wings

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:02.490 

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:04.440 

because<00:01:03.490> the<00:01:03.610> writing<00:01:03.790> position<00:01:04.059> is<00:01:04.330> more

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:04.450 
because the writing position is more

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:06.960 
because the writing position is more
forward<00:01:04.930> as<00:01:05.050> well<00:01:05.260> I<00:01:05.410> tend<00:01:05.650> to<00:01:05.710> be<00:01:05.920> sitting<00:01:06.910> a

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:06.970 
forward as well I tend to be sitting a

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:08.100 
forward as well I tend to be sitting a
bit<00:01:07.120> more<00:01:07.300> over<00:01:07.600> the<00:01:07.690> bars

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.110 
bit more over the bars

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:09.930 
bit more over the bars
it<00:01:08.530> makes<00:01:08.830> the<00:01:08.980> steering<00:01:09.250> just<00:01:09.700> that<00:01:09.850> little

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:09.940 
it makes the steering just that little

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.490 
it makes the steering just that little
bit<00:01:10.150> more<00:01:10.480> light

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
bit more light

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.820 
bit more light
not<00:01:12.250> necessarily<00:01:12.640> twitchy<00:01:13.030> but<00:01:13.420> bit<00:01:13.690> light

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.950 

this<00:01:17.830> bite<00:01:18.130> though<00:01:18.340> is<00:01:18.490> just<00:01:18.700> so<00:01:19.000> smooth<00:01:19.450> it's

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
this bite though is just so smooth it's

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:25.380 
this bite though is just so smooth it's
just<00:01:20.580> it's<00:01:21.580> hard<00:01:21.700> to<00:01:21.910> explain<00:01:24.060> you<00:01:25.060> can<00:01:25.210> feel

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
just it's hard to explain you can feel

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:26.760 
just it's hard to explain you can feel
it<00:01:25.540> ever<00:01:25.690> is<00:01:25.840> a<00:01:25.870> slight<00:01:26.260> little<00:01:26.440> bit<00:01:26.650> of

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
it ever is a slight little bit of

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.380 
it ever is a slight little bit of
feedback<00:01:26.950> through<00:01:27.400> the<00:01:27.430> bars<00:01:27.730> and<00:01:27.910> the<00:01:28.060> the

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
feedback through the bars and the the

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.469 
feedback through the bars and the the
foot<00:01:28.570> pegs<00:01:28.810> but<00:01:28.990> it's<00:01:29.110> not<00:01:29.490> so<00:01:30.490> much<00:01:30.700> vibration

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
foot pegs but it's not so much vibration

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:40.680 
foot pegs but it's not so much vibration
very<00:01:34.479> nice<00:01:34.690> I<00:01:37.619> can<00:01:38.619> see<00:01:38.800> why<00:01:39.010> ah<00:01:39.280> I<00:01:40.150> hate

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
a wars' the butt brakes got a lot of

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.620 
a wars' the butt brakes got a lot of
feeling<00:03:14.760> it<00:03:14.850> as<00:03:14.940> well<00:03:15.120> because<00:03:15.300> you<00:03:15.480> know<00:03:15.540> I

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
feeling it as well because you know I

feeling it as well because you know I
only<00:03:15.840> use<00:03:15.990> with<00:03:16.110> that<00:03:16.260> brake<00:03:16.470> of<00:03:16.620> slow<00:03:16.830> speeds

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
only use with that brake of slow speeds

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:18.890 
only use with that brake of slow speeds
anyway<00:03:17.520> that's<00:03:17.910> got<00:03:18.120> quite<00:03:18.300> a<00:03:18.420> nice<00:03:18.540> bit<00:03:18.810> of

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
anyway that's got quite a nice bit of

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.210 
anyway that's got quite a nice bit of
feel<00:03:19.050> to<00:03:19.080> it<00:03:21.380> slow<00:03:22.380> speeds<00:03:22.710> nice<00:03:22.980> on<00:03:23.190> it

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
feel to it slow speeds nice on it

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.370 
feel to it slow speeds nice on it
steering's<00:03:24.180> just<00:03:24.570> that<00:03:24.690> little<00:03:24.810> bit<00:03:25.020> lighter

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
steering's just that little bit lighter

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.910 
steering's just that little bit lighter
though<00:03:26.690> so<00:03:27.690> it<00:03:27.990> just<00:03:28.200> tends<00:03:28.410> to<00:03:28.470> be<00:03:28.560> a<00:03:28.620> little

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
though so it just tends to be a little

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.650 
though so it just tends to be a little
bit<00:03:29.160> more<00:03:29.310> twitchy<00:03:29.580> on<00:03:29.760> the<00:03:29.850> steering<00:03:30.120> at<00:03:30.360> very

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
bit more twitchy on the steering at very

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.900 
bit more twitchy on the steering at very
slow<00:03:30.900> down<00:03:31.230> speeds<00:03:31.620> I<00:03:34.580> definitely<00:03:35.580> say<00:03:35.760> the

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
slow down speeds I definitely say the

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.700 
slow down speeds I definitely say the
650<00:03:36.420> is<00:03:36.480> more<00:03:36.630> comfortable<00:03:37.020> it's<00:03:37.470> got<00:03:37.680> a

650 is more comfortable it's got a
