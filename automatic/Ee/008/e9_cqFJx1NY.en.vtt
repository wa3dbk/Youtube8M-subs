cats and then just mowing guys down soon
as<00:01:05.420> I<00:01:05.509> get<00:01:05.630> on<00:01:05.660> the<00:01:05.780> rover<00:01:06.110> I'm<00:01:06.229> just<00:01:06.470> trying<00:01:06.680> to

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:06.800 
as I get on the rover I'm just trying to

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.710 
as I get on the rover I'm just trying to
remind<00:01:07.340> myself<00:01:07.490> let's<00:01:07.940> keep<00:01:08.090> it<00:01:08.240> simple<00:01:08.690> let's

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
remind myself let's keep it simple let's

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.359 
remind myself let's keep it simple let's
just<00:01:08.990> make<00:01:09.170> good<00:01:09.380> pitches<00:01:09.650> and<00:01:10.040> quality

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:10.369 
just make good pitches and quality

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:13.570 
just make good pitches and quality
pitches<00:01:10.790> three<00:01:11.660> pitches<00:01:12.170> one<00:01:12.410> out<00:01:12.590> that

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.580 
pitches three pitches one out that

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.280 
pitches three pitches one out that
sequence<00:01:14.090> is<00:01:14.300> the<00:01:14.330> mark<00:01:14.660> of<00:01:14.750> a<00:01:14.869> pretty<00:01:15.080> good

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
sequence is the mark of a pretty good

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:16.870 
sequence is the mark of a pretty good
pitcher<00:01:15.680> and<00:01:15.860> I<00:01:15.890> think<00:01:16.160> that's<00:01:16.369> just<00:01:16.520> one<00:01:16.729> way

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
pitcher and I think that's just one way

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.730 
pitcher and I think that's just one way
of<00:01:16.910> being<00:01:17.420> able<00:01:17.630> to<00:01:17.750> stay<00:01:17.960> focused<00:01:18.170> is<00:01:18.560> just

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
of being able to stay focused is just

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.740 
of being able to stay focused is just
keeping<00:01:19.040> things<00:01:19.250> simple<00:01:19.460> I<00:01:19.850> think<00:01:20.330> mark<00:01:20.540> does

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
keeping things simple I think mark does

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.780 
keeping things simple I think mark does
a<00:01:20.780> good<00:01:20.990> job<00:01:21.050> of<00:01:21.259> repeating<00:01:21.860> his<00:01:22.009> mechanics<00:01:22.550> I

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
a good job of repeating his mechanics I

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:24.249 
a good job of repeating his mechanics I
think<00:01:23.119> when<00:01:23.270> you<00:01:23.360> do<00:01:23.509> that<00:01:23.690> you're<00:01:23.899> gonna<00:01:23.990> see

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:24.259 
think when you do that you're gonna see

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:26.170 
think when you do that you're gonna see
your<00:01:24.410> location<00:01:24.920> get<00:01:25.130> better<00:01:25.340> you<00:01:25.910> know<00:01:26.000> that's

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
your location get better you know that's

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.670 
your location get better you know that's
why<00:01:26.360> he's<00:01:26.509> able<00:01:26.660> to<00:01:26.869> pitch<00:01:27.050> as<00:01:27.229> well<00:01:27.380> as<00:01:27.560> he

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
why he's able to pitch as well as he

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.080 
why he's able to pitch as well as he
does<00:01:27.860> because<00:01:28.250> he<00:01:28.430> does<00:01:28.610> have<00:01:28.850> a<00:01:28.880> good

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
does because he does have a good

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.200 
does because he does have a good
mechanic<00:01:29.270> saying<00:01:29.840> he<00:01:29.929> does<00:01:30.110> repeat

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.850 

it's<00:01:33.480> fun<00:01:33.750> touching<00:01:34.110> with<00:01:34.200> a<00:01:34.290> guy<00:01:34.410> I<00:01:34.440> mean<00:01:34.710> he's
