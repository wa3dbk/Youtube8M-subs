00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:12.810
 yo everyone so today we get 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.880
 found a presentation of a 

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:17.220
 of my colonies I never have your 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.800
 show on video again so that's my 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:23.580
 colony of the half-sister barbarous so 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:25.160
 frozen now for two years so that's 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.890
 I start to do a little bit with 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:31.949
 so down this colo suffered heavy 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.110
 losses bastani we went from pretty much 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.620
 200 individuals 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:40.140
 fifty after so the colony 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.640
 navarro is just starting to resume a 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.190
 little staff so I'm going to show you 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.510
 the convent and or after so I you 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.520
 presents a little unbalanced wood of 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.870
 wagons ranking tube again for a 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.780
 better development so 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:55.500
 anticipation this ut alcohol so a 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:57.930
 50/50 mixture of alcohol and taxes 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.320
 we attach we take care of the 90 degrees 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.270
 celsius 70 ° so that I say about 90 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.979
 the proof that it's a story 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.110
 when I read that you have a file this 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.690
 that you have available so then 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.570
 the substrate I can move a little 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.220
 the substrate is the rabbi 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.540
 house that I made goes for but 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.150
 the hours of the coup I use it for 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.590
 the iphone too so after you can 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.330
 see so I'm going to show you a little 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.180
 little any nonzero seed we 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:28.860
 have there so starting from the end so 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:33.210
 here dandelion blue poppy mix for 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:36.270
 canary my name is more lembras his 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.890
 wheat these weapons and who do I have 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.710
 reminds more than anything of the tum 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:43.409
 years I remembered so here is in 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.190
 all we have pretty much if I remember 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.920
 well 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:52.050
 very kind of ain so here is so 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:55.110
 otherwise for the 2 c I got a little 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.310
 worst month just for the decor and you read 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.200
 for their last sweet liquids 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.030
 so I really give some time to 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.400
 other because the main 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.270
 low feed and seeds and 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:08.940
 insects 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:09.330
 I'm drawing a tube pan so there is 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.150
 will ask 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:15.720
 ok it was said to go up and do the 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:21.120
 focus on the study of the crew who 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:22.290
 look for the tube so this tube is the 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.810
 info tube as you can see 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:28.140
 there are full full full giving all 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:31.290
 this part there tomorrow and after we can 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.030
 see no media and minors because 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.460
 the peculiarity goes in this species 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.100
 it's the presence of three castes so 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:39.930
 minor media is major so there is no 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:43.260
 will suffer no misfortune and that media 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:45.090
 and minors so he's eminently the 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.680
 recognize my because they are small and 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.560
 the media are starting to have their heads 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.450
 reddish so that's a non media 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.430
 second there wearing a no there is 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.870
 different sizes of mediapart that 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.060
 depends how they were fed to at 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.940
 the larval state 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:03.510
 so that's it for the first tube I'm going 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:07.440
 to rest quietly spent at 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:10.290
 second which is a little bigger the 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:14.000
 first tube is this and cm long 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:16.170
 on insists wide and that to some 18 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:21.959
 that a little bigger there is also 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:24.150
 more people so I do not know if he's going 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:30.450
 see well but in this tube binds the arena 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:31.650
 but she's not going to move you do not 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.670
 what is I so not so new 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:38.670
 So the power to have a presence 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.640
 no caste so that there is a 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:42.670
 thing in there 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.940
 you know hide me the red queen a 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:48.610
 little bit I know of this costume that can 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:51.700
 you can see her go there that's the 

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:53.080
 big sea ​​that moves so the same 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.300
 all we have larvae that will surely 

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.310
 give major that they are very 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:00.130
 well fed 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:02.860
 there was also a number of media and that's it 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.750
 the main the size of the colony 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.520
 who is with the queen to protect her 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.040
 there are seeds to make bread 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:10.120
 bottom it's also one of the most 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.260
 dry 

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:24.760
 others go on gentle that are pretty 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:28.840
 wet so here I laid the tube and 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:30.340
 compost other void tube i is the world 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.390
 use and who just served as a 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.760
 hangman who serves until tomorrow for 

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:36.310
 see so we can see some vale 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.570
 funds but that drink on them so 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:40.450
 the third wooden tube is not yet 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:41.830
 used so originally planned the video I 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:43.169
 told you about a workforce of 200 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:46.840
 workers you saw what's left of it 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:49.390
 so I was problem already had to my 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:52.030
 neither too good for the colony there have been any 

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:55.000
 mite problems too so really 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:57.250
 the colony case not been very lucky one 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.250
 is going to say so so here's how 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:01.860
 it started well so I hope will have 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:05.950
 good growth next year 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:08.950
 so this is this species if not for 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:10.570
 talk about it a bit south 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:13.360
 from France so at the base and comes 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:15.580
 from Africa but has taken up residence in 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:17.290
 the south of France so it's a 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.150
 low climber species with presence of 

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:21.970
 castrums as I say them bah in the 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:24.850
 video whose cascio feed my 

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:27.940
 main seed of one is that she 

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:31.630
 like everything that comes the mullet and 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:32.260
 fly so mainly so for 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:34.419
 maintenance 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.380
 we can heat or it's really 

00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:36.669
 passionate have a better 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:37.780
 development 

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:40.030
 but suddenly the life of 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:44.260
 workers also reduced so the fair 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:46.520
 middle this would be for at 25 26 degrees the 

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:48.860
 posed dia 

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:50.120
 I counselors and advisers that 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:52.580
 depends a bit on the state of your 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:54.080
 colleague saw that she has more 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:56.479
 of manpower I will not make a gap to 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:58.159
 to have a development this winter 

00:05:56.479 --> 00:06:00.949
 but next year I'll make one 

00:05:58.159 --> 00:06:04.940
 to make him see you again at the stop 

00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:06.680
 so for these times so here is so 

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:08.330
 not if you have questions by 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:10.340
 report to this species you can 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:12.620
 post down in the comments but 

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:14.930
 never mind I sir you liked the 

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:16.340
 video is to subscribe so we get 

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:18.979
 not find for a next video of 

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:20.060
 presentation low on my second colony 

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:20.509
 but know how to love his 

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:21.949
 instructors 

00:06:20.509 --> 00:06:26.319
 so we end up for the second 

00:06:21.949 --> 00:06:26.319
 fucking video to the east no more 

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.440
 Oh
