about a quarter inch in and you just cut

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.210 
about a quarter inch in and you just cut
up<00:01:05.339> to<00:01:05.610> about<00:01:05.850> where<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.270> tab<00:01:06.600> is<00:01:07.049> and<00:01:07.409> stop

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
and then go to the other side and do the

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.859 
and then go to the other side and do the
same<00:01:15.450> thing<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.380> then<00:01:16.920> just<00:01:17.159> bend<00:01:17.400> that<00:01:17.880> like

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
so and that's going to cause a you can

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.609 
so and that's going to cause a you can
make<00:01:26.670> a<00:01:26.700> little<00:01:27.000> pop<00:01:27.210> up<00:01:27.450> with<00:01:27.630> that<00:01:27.840> so<00:01:28.409> this

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
make a little pop up with that so this

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.920 
make a little pop up with that so this
will<00:01:28.799> pop<00:01:29.930> forward<00:01:30.930> and<00:01:32.150> that<00:01:33.150> heart<00:01:33.509> will<00:01:33.659> pop

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
will pop forward and that heart will pop

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.450 
will pop forward and that heart will pop
backwards<00:01:34.670> now<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:36.329> make<00:01:36.659> our<00:01:37.020> frogs<00:01:37.920> stick

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460
