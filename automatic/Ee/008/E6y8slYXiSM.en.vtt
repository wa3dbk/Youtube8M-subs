00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:07.800 

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.010 

hey<00:00:08.490> I'm<00:00:08.670> wrong<00:00:08.880> with<00:00:09.120> mobile<00:00:09.480> geeks<00:00:09.750> and<00:00:09.900> what

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:10.020 
hey I'm wrong with mobile geeks and what

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:11.540 
hey I'm wrong with mobile geeks and what
we<00:00:10.140> have<00:00:10.320> right<00:00:10.440> here<00:00:10.500> is<00:00:10.680> the<00:00:10.800> new<00:00:11.070> asus

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
we have right here is the new asus

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.820 
we have right here is the new asus
fonepad<00:00:11.580> 7<00:00:12.380> the<00:00:13.380> device<00:00:13.620> is<00:00:13.770> called<00:00:13.980> fe<00:00:15.080> 375<00:00:16.080> cg

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
fonepad 7 the device is called fe 375 cg

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.700 
fonepad 7 the device is called fe 375 cg
and<00:00:17.070> that<00:00:17.820> one<00:00:17.970> is<00:00:18.000> actually<00:00:18.390> based<00:00:18.810> on<00:00:19.050> a<00:00:19.500> new

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
and that one is actually based on a new

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.830 
and that one is actually based on a new
merrifield<00:00:20.460> platform<00:00:20.970> so<00:00:21.180> that<00:00:21.210> thing<00:00:21.660> is

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
merrifield platform so that thing is

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.830 
merrifield platform so that thing is
definitely<00:00:22.470> running<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:23.189> new<00:00:23.570> Intel<00:00:24.570> chips

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
definitely running the new Intel chips

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.409 
definitely running the new Intel chips
right<00:00:25.020> there<00:00:25.259> it's<00:00:26.250> running<00:00:26.460> at<00:00:26.640> one<00:00:26.880> and<00:00:27.239> up

00:00:27.409 --> 00:00:27.419 
right there it's running at one and up

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:29.450 
right there it's running at one and up
to<00:00:27.599> 1.8<00:00:28.140> three<00:00:28.410> gigahertz<00:00:28.680> I<00:00:28.980> think<00:00:29.220> the<00:00:29.310> base

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
to 1.8 three gigahertz I think the base

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.999 
to 1.8 three gigahertz I think the base
become<00:00:30.029> speed<00:00:30.599> should<00:00:30.869> be<00:00:30.930> 1.2<00:00:31.710> gigahertz

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
become speed should be 1.2 gigahertz

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.680 
become speed should be 1.2 gigahertz
it's<00:00:32.790> combined<00:00:33.270> with<00:00:33.510> one<00:00:33.899> gig<00:00:34.050> of<00:00:34.200> ram<00:00:34.260> and

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:35.690 
it's combined with one gig of ram and

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.990 
it's combined with one gig of ram and
let<00:00:36.690> me<00:00:36.780> see<00:00:37.079> 8<00:00:37.410> or<00:00:37.739> 16<00:00:38.220> gigs<00:00:38.430> of<00:00:38.579> flash<00:00:38.970> storage

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
let me see 8 or 16 gigs of flash storage

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.420 
let me see 8 or 16 gigs of flash storage
the<00:00:39.989> whole<00:00:40.140> thing<00:00:40.350> is<00:00:40.559> a<00:00:40.590> really<00:00:41.160> interesting

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
the whole thing is a really interesting

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.029 
the whole thing is a really interesting
device<00:00:42.239> because<00:00:42.600> this<00:00:42.780> is<00:00:42.960> lte-capable<00:00:43.649> and

00:00:44.029 --> 00:00:44.039 
device because this is lte-capable and

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:46.250 
device because this is lte-capable and
it's<00:00:44.160> basically<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.879> new<00:00:45.300> merrifield<00:00:45.899> atom

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
it's basically the new merrifield atom

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.470 
it's basically the new merrifield atom
that<00:00:46.379> is<00:00:46.440> going<00:00:46.890> into<00:00:47.010> phones<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:48.449> whole

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:30.510 
much anti-fingerprint coated so it's for

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.090 
much anti-fingerprint coated so it's for
one<00:01:30.660> it's<00:01:30.870> a<00:01:30.990> matte<00:01:31.140> cover<00:01:31.380> on<00:01:31.620> the<00:01:31.740> back<00:01:31.860> and

definitely doing a good job pretty much
because<00:01:43.380> this<00:01:43.680> thing

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.010 
because this thing

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:45.430 
because this thing
has<00:01:44.070> been<00:01:44.250> grabbed<00:01:44.520> by<00:01:44.670> a<00:01:44.730> lot<00:01:45.000> of<00:01:45.120> people

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
another thing I noticed is that this is

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.350 
another thing I noticed is that this is
using<00:01:49.290> two<00:01:49.620> front<00:01:49.950> speakers<00:01:50.340> right<00:01:50.550> here<00:01:50.820> so

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
using two front speakers right here so

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.700 
using two front speakers right here so
definitely<00:01:51.720> an<00:01:52.140> interesting<00:01:52.380> development

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
definitely an interesting development

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.710 
definitely an interesting development
from<00:01:53.130> Asus<00:01:53.490> they're<00:01:53.670> moving<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.360> speakers<00:01:54.690> to

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
from Asus they're moving the speakers to

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.750 
from Asus they're moving the speakers to
the<00:01:54.930> front<00:01:55.140> let's<00:01:55.350> go<00:01:55.530> check<00:01:55.740> out<00:01:55.920> which

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:56.760 
the front let's go check out which
