00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:18.050 
is going to be able to deal with these
Marauders<00:03:16.049> just<00:03:16.590> fine<00:03:16.980> and<00:03:17.250> the<00:03:17.700> void<00:03:17.910> ray

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
Marauders just fine and the void ray

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.000 
Marauders just fine and the void ray
also<00:03:18.239> coming<00:03:18.569> in<00:03:18.660> oh<00:03:18.810> it<00:03:19.230> looks<00:03:19.410> like<00:03:19.620> the

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
also coming in oh it looks like the

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.190 
also coming in oh it looks like the
dropship<00:03:20.850> got<00:03:21.000> tooken<00:03:21.209> out<00:03:21.389> by<00:03:21.540> a<00:03:21.569> feedback

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
dropship got tooken out by a feedback

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.170 
dropship got tooken out by a feedback
there<00:03:22.440> and<00:03:22.650> that<00:03:23.190> was<00:03:23.340> great<00:03:23.670> of<00:03:23.790> course<00:03:23.940> from

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
there and that was great of course from

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.660 
there and that was great of course from
sock<00:03:24.450> killing<00:03:25.260> off<00:03:25.410> the<00:03:25.799> threat<00:03:26.280> of<00:03:26.459> the

dropship looming overhead from the
Protoss<00:03:29.579> mean<00:03:30.030> so<00:03:30.750> now<00:03:31.049> let's<00:03:31.319> take<00:03:31.440> a<00:03:31.500> look<00:03:31.590> at

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:31.739 
Protoss mean so now let's take a look at

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:33.680 
Protoss mean so now let's take a look at
Zach<00:03:31.980> he's<00:03:32.190> now<00:03:32.370> trying<00:03:32.430> to<00:03:32.730> secure<00:03:33.030> a<00:03:33.120> fourth

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
Zach he's now trying to secure a fourth

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.240 
Zach he's now trying to secure a fourth
base<00:03:33.989> which<00:03:34.260> is<00:03:34.290> going<00:03:34.620> to<00:03:34.709> put<00:03:34.829> him<00:03:34.920> in<00:03:35.010> about

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
base which is going to put him in about

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.300 
base which is going to put him in about
three<00:03:35.639> mining<00:03:36.060> bases<00:03:36.420> his<00:03:36.780> income<00:03:37.380> is<00:03:37.620> still

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
three mining bases his income is still

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.520 
three mining bases his income is still
pretty<00:03:38.730> much<00:03:38.940> a<00:03:39.150> still<00:03:39.959> higher<00:03:40.139> than<00:03:40.200> the

talk see the threat coming from the
south<00:03:55.410> these<00:03:55.859> void<00:03:56.130> ray<00:03:56.250> is<00:03:56.310> gonna<00:03:56.489> try<00:03:56.639> to<00:03:56.730> go

00:03:56.839 --> 00:03:56.849 
south these void ray is gonna try to go

00:03:56.849 --> 00:03:58.159 
south these void ray is gonna try to go
in<00:03:56.940> and<00:03:57.060> do<00:03:57.120> some<00:03:57.269> damage<00:03:57.419> about<00:03:57.630> Brad<00:03:57.930> talk

00:03:58.159 --> 00:03:58.169 
in and do some damage about Brad talk

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:00.349 
in and do some damage about Brad talk
wisely<00:03:58.769> getting<00:03:58.889> some<00:03:59.220> turrets<00:03:59.639> here<00:04:00.150> to

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:00.359 
wisely getting some turrets here to

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:02.960 
wisely getting some turrets here to
defend<00:04:00.540> his<00:04:01.319> planetary<00:04:02.160> fortress<00:04:02.549> from<00:04:02.790> the

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
defend his planetary fortress from the

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.680 
defend his planetary fortress from the
void<00:04:03.180> rays<00:04:03.450> and<00:04:03.660> I<00:04:03.989> think<00:04:04.370> the<00:04:05.370> the<00:04:05.760> the<00:04:06.209> air<00:04:06.389> is

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:06.690 
void rays and I think the the the air is

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.050 
void rays and I think the the the air is
going<00:04:06.959> to<00:04:07.049> be<00:04:07.139> warded<00:04:07.470> away<00:04:07.650> by<00:04:08.280> the<00:04:08.340> missile

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
going to be warded away by the missile

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:10.580 
going to be warded away by the missile
turrets<00:04:09.389> Brad<00:04:09.630> talk<00:04:09.810> also<00:04:10.019> has<00:04:10.319> some

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
turrets Brad talk also has some

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:12.979 
turrets Brad talk also has some
Marauders<00:04:11.160> and<00:04:11.430> ghosts<00:04:12.209> he's<00:04:12.359> still<00:04:12.720> just

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
Marauders and ghosts he's still just

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:14.780 
Marauders and ghosts he's still just
walking<00:04:13.470> around<00:04:13.560> the<00:04:13.799> base<00:04:13.950> with<00:04:14.250> his<00:04:14.459> army

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
walking around the base with his army

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.520 
walking around the base with his army
and<00:04:15.000> it<00:04:15.389> looks<00:04:15.540> like<00:04:15.690> the<00:04:15.840> turrets<00:04:16.169> are<00:04:16.349> gonna

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:16.530 
and it looks like the turrets are gonna

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.219 
and it looks like the turrets are gonna
ward<00:04:17.160> away<00:04:17.280> these<00:04:17.519> void<00:04:17.820> rays<00:04:18.060> so<00:04:18.239> saw<00:04:18.450> trying

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229 
ward away these void rays so saw trying

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:20.599 
ward away these void rays so saw trying
to<00:04:19.349> transition<00:04:19.680> into<00:04:19.919> void<00:04:20.160> rays<00:04:20.310> to<00:04:20.430> make

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
to transition into void rays to make

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:21.830 
to transition into void rays to make
something<00:04:20.880> happen<00:04:20.969> but<00:04:21.299> it<00:04:21.419> isn't<00:04:21.719> really

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:21.840 
something happen but it isn't really

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.420 
something happen but it isn't really
going<00:04:22.079> to<00:04:22.169> be<00:04:22.260> all<00:04:22.409> that<00:04:22.560> effective<00:04:22.650> also<00:04:23.250> some

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
going to be all that effective also some

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.770 
going to be all that effective also some
marines<00:04:23.700> coming<00:04:24.030> in<00:04:24.150> to<00:04:24.630> push<00:04:24.930> these<00:04:25.140> away

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
marines coming in to push these away

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.080 
marines coming in to push these away
and<00:04:25.930> I<00:04:26.380> think<00:04:26.650> for<00:04:26.950> now<00:04:27.100> Brad<00:04:27.400> top<00:04:27.580> is<00:04:27.760> gonna

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
and I think for now Brad top is gonna

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:30.390 
and I think for now Brad top is gonna
hold<00:04:28.270> on<00:04:28.480> to<00:04:28.690> this<00:04:29.200> last<00:04:29.530> command<00:04:30.070> center<00:04:30.280> and

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
hold on to this last command center and

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.550 
hold on to this last command center and
this<00:04:30.520> is<00:04:30.670> really<00:04:30.910> if<00:04:31.240> he<00:04:31.330> loses<00:04:31.600> this<00:04:31.960> then

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:32.560 
this is really if he loses this then

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.020 
this is really if he loses this then
he's<00:04:32.710> pretty<00:04:33.100> much<00:04:33.340> out<00:04:33.550> of<00:04:33.610> this<00:04:33.850> game

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
he's pretty much out of this game

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:36.270 
he's pretty much out of this game
because<00:04:34.389> his<00:04:34.600> natural<00:04:35.200> is<00:04:35.320> nearly<00:04:35.710> mind<00:04:36.100> out

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 
because his natural is nearly mind out

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:39.210 
because his natural is nearly mind out
so<00:04:36.760> he<00:04:36.880> has<00:04:37.150> to<00:04:37.419> hold<00:04:37.540> on<00:04:37.840> to<00:04:38.080> this<00:04:38.200> base<00:04:38.470> but<00:04:39.100> of

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:39.220 
so he has to hold on to this base but of

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.570 
so he has to hold on to this base but of
course<00:04:39.460> Wow<00:04:39.910> my<00:04:40.240> goodness<00:04:40.900> sake<00:04:41.200> now<00:04:41.410> at<00:04:41.620> 71

is going to be his sixth base total so

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:01.110 
is going to be his sixth base total so
he's<00:06:59.470> really<00:06:59.710> in<00:07:00.010> a<00:07:00.310> firm<00:07:00.610> position<00:07:00.790> of

he's really in a firm position of

00:07:15.750 --> 00:07:15.760 
needs to take out this prism if he wants

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:17.910 
needs to take out this prism if he wants

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:44.350 
that brad talk is going to be able to

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:45.750 
that brad talk is going to be able to
snipe<00:07:44.650> out<00:07:44.830> this<00:07:45.010> nexus<00:07:45.340> because<00:07:45.670> the
