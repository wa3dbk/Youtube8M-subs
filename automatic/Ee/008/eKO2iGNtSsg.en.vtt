00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.310 
working with it the clot isn't super
strong<00:01:59.979> it<00:02:00.979> is<00:02:01.520> I<00:02:01.760> believe<00:02:01.909> the<00:02:02.720> strength<00:02:03.020> is

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
strong it is I believe the strength is

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.899 
strong it is I believe the strength is
kind<00:02:03.740> of<00:02:03.890> mattering<00:02:04.490> on<00:02:05.830> gravity<00:02:06.830> so<00:02:07.310> far<00:02:07.640> is

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:07.909 
kind of mattering on gravity so far is

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:11.260 
kind of mattering on gravity so far is
what<00:02:08.239> it<00:02:08.420> seems<00:02:08.659> like<00:02:09.220> however<00:02:10.220> once<00:02:10.729> I<00:02:10.970> start

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
what it seems like however once I start

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:12.670 
what it seems like however once I start
working<00:02:11.330> with<00:02:11.600> it<00:02:11.870> I<00:02:11.959> might<00:02:12.140> be<00:02:12.319> able<00:02:12.380> to<00:02:12.560> get

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
working with it I might be able to get

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.710 
working with it I might be able to get
it<00:02:12.800> stronger<00:02:13.250> but<00:02:13.910> for<00:02:14.060> right<00:02:14.209> now<00:02:14.270> I'm<00:02:14.630> just

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
it stronger but for right now I'm just

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.360 
it stronger but for right now I'm just
going<00:02:14.840> to<00:02:14.930> keep<00:02:15.080> it<00:02:15.230> the<00:02:15.350> way<00:02:15.380> it<00:02:15.590> is<00:02:15.680> and<00:02:15.980> see

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
going to keep it the way it is and see

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.180 
going to keep it the way it is and see
but<00:02:16.459> I<00:02:16.489> can<00:02:16.730> win<00:02:16.909> so<00:02:17.900> hopefully<00:02:18.620> I<00:02:18.680> can<00:02:18.799> film

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
but I can win so hopefully I can film

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.850 
but I can win so hopefully I can film
this<00:02:19.370> right<00:02:19.720> but<00:02:20.720> I'm<00:02:21.049> going<00:02:21.230> to<00:02:21.290> play<00:02:21.500> here

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
this right but I'm going to play here

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.399 
this right but I'm going to play here
and<00:02:22.540> see<00:02:23.540> what<00:02:23.720> happens

00:02:24.399 --> 00:02:24.409 
and see what happens

00:02:24.409 --> 00:02:28.119 
and see what happens
so<00:02:24.620> and<00:02:24.980> also<00:02:25.489> you<00:02:25.730> can<00:02:26.620> you<00:02:27.620> can<00:02:27.769> fill<00:02:28.010> the

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:28.129 
so and also you can you can fill the

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:30.910 
so and also you can you can fill the
machine<00:02:28.459> by<00:02:28.610> opening<00:02:29.000> this<00:02:29.150> up<00:02:29.650> this<00:02:30.650> is<00:02:30.799> how

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
machine by opening this up this is how

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.420 
machine by opening this up this is how
you<00:02:30.980> get<00:02:31.190> inside<00:02:31.670> the<00:02:31.909> machine<00:02:32.299> and<00:02:33.430> do

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
you get inside the machine and do

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.520 
you get inside the machine and do
whatever<00:02:35.620> this<00:02:36.620> pops<00:02:37.099> right<00:02:37.400> down<00:02:37.750> and<00:02:38.750> then

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
whatever this pops right down and then

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.149 
whatever this pops right down and then
also<00:02:39.829> inside<00:02:40.700> here<00:02:41.980> hopefully<00:02:42.980> there's

00:02:43.149 --> 00:02:43.159 
also inside here hopefully there's

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:47.199 
also inside here hopefully there's
enough<00:02:43.489> light<00:02:43.760> in<00:02:43.819> here<00:02:44.030> um<00:02:44.450> so<00:02:45.819> this<00:02:46.819> here<00:02:47.090> is

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 
enough light in here um so this here is

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:49.740 
enough light in here um so this here is
that<00:02:47.329> I<00:02:47.450> kind<00:02:47.659> of<00:02:47.720> the<00:02:47.840> control<00:02:48.260> board<00:02:48.530> and

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
that I kind of the control board and

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.130 
that I kind of the control board and
just<00:02:50.750> some<00:02:50.959> other<00:02:50.989> wires<00:02:51.530> and<00:02:52.040> like<00:02:52.280> this<00:02:52.489> is<00:02:52.700> a

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
just some other wires and like this is a

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.509 
just some other wires and like this is a
honestly<00:02:54.140> this<00:02:54.290> is<00:02:54.470> the<00:02:54.859> battery<00:02:55.340> that<00:02:55.489> powers

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
honestly this is the battery that powers

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:58.539 
honestly this is the battery that powers
the<00:02:56.090> machine<00:02:56.480> um<00:02:56.950> and<00:02:57.950> then<00:02:58.160> we<00:02:58.190> have<00:02:58.519> a

00:02:58.539 --> 00:02:58.549 
the machine um and then we have a

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:01.390 
the machine um and then we have a
speaker<00:02:59.299> right<00:02:59.329> here<00:02:59.569> too<00:03:00.049> you<00:03:00.890> can<00:03:01.069> adjust

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 
speaker right here too you can adjust

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:08.589 
speaker right here too you can adjust
the<00:03:01.549> volume<00:03:06.670> so<00:03:07.670> yeah<00:03:07.819> I<00:03:07.849> don't<00:03:08.209> know<00:03:08.299> I<00:03:08.329> might

00:03:08.589 --> 00:03:08.599 
the volume so yeah I don't know I might

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:10.750 
the volume so yeah I don't know I might
get<00:03:08.750> a<00:03:08.810> put<00:03:09.379> tape<00:03:09.590> over<00:03:09.799> that<00:03:10.099> if<00:03:10.310> it<00:03:10.430> gets<00:03:10.579> too

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
get a put tape over that if it gets too

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.729 
get a put tape over that if it gets too
annoying<00:03:10.970> because<00:03:11.239> that<00:03:11.480> song<00:03:12.109> gets<00:03:12.349> stuck<00:03:12.620> in

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 
annoying because that song gets stuck in

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:16.119 
annoying because that song gets stuck in
my<00:03:12.829> head<00:03:13.040> and<00:03:13.549> then<00:03:14.090> uh<00:03:14.620> there's<00:03:15.620> a<00:03:15.769> power

00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:16.129 
my head and then uh there's a power

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:18.789 
my head and then uh there's a power
button<00:03:16.670> right<00:03:16.700> there<00:03:17.109> shows<00:03:18.109> you<00:03:18.140> the<00:03:18.470> coin

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:18.799 
button right there shows you the coin

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:24.759 
button right there shows you the coin
and<00:03:20.739> prize<00:03:21.739> count<00:03:22.160> right<00:03:22.519> there<00:03:22.880> I<00:03:23.769> can't

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:24.769 
and prize count right there I can't

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:27.729 
and prize count right there I can't
focus<00:03:24.919> it<00:03:25.250> with<00:03:25.370> one<00:03:25.549> hand<00:03:25.579> side<00:03:26.319> so<00:03:27.319> yeah<00:03:27.500> that

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:44.389 
nope stabbed it is pretty weak so might

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:49.780 
nope stabbed it is pretty weak so might
be<00:03:44.540> harder<00:03:44.840> to<00:03:45.109> win<00:03:45.199> fun<00:03:47.980> make<00:03:48.980> sure<00:03:49.160> its<00:03:49.310> focus
