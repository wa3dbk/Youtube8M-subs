00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.840
 Overlapping metal plywood・・・! come on! Our super battery combination・・・! 

00:00:15.108 --> 00:00:17.708
・・・I can’t stand it anymore. If it goes on like this, it will be sooner or later... 

00:00:18.996 --> 00:00:22.996
 Hello・・・ Your current manufacturing equipment is for me! 

00:00:25.677 --> 00:00:29.037
 Volt, you guy, I want to die with it! If you give it to me... 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.200
 Ah, maybe...・But there is no other way... 

00:00:34.123 --> 00:00:35.123
 but··· 

00:00:35.211 --> 00:00:37.731
 Let two different metals touch 

00:00:37.891 --> 00:00:39.731
 Will produce a weak current 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.550
 If you put a piece of cloth wet with salt water in the middle 

00:00:43.669 --> 00:00:45.509
 The current intensity will change dramatically! 

00:00:45.685 --> 00:00:49.285
 Then, two or three such devices are superimposed. 

00:00:49.401 --> 00:00:52.832
 The intensity of the current is increased by 2 or 3 times 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:54.090
 It should be like this. 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:55.930
 The danger is too high 

00:00:56.103 --> 00:00:58.423
 But it’s better than dying like this. 

00:01:07.247 --> 00:01:10.247
 Volt, you always tell us 

00:01:10.514 --> 00:01:12.514
 Even if the world has come to an end, 

00:01:12.622 --> 00:01:15.982
 There are also planets we can return 

00:01:16.303 --> 00:01:19.303
 Forgotten, so long-term things 

00:01:19.435 --> 00:01:22.995
 volt! Here is the planet we can return! 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.615
 This has a world of veterans 

00:01:26.633 --> 00:01:29.273
 Even this planet is not our hometown 

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.640
 We must also swear to protect! 

00:01:31.895 --> 00:01:33.895
 You guys 

00:01:35.205 --> 00:01:37.645
 Will not let you die will never let you die! volt! 

00:01:37.805 --> 00:01:40.405
 If you say something nasty, you guys 

00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:44.639
 come on! This is our strongest ultimate weapon! ! 

00:01:46.508 --> 00:01:47.268
 merge! 

00:01:48.748 --> 00:01:51.908
 2 times the energy is not enough! ! 

00:01:52.045 --> 00:01:53.885
 And this one of mine 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.690
啊 Energy 3 ・・`倍・・・

00:01:58.859 --> 00:01:59.859
 volt·· 

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:01.919
 Then there is this guy 

00:02:02.173 --> 00:02:05.173
 The energy left by the guy took it 

00:02:07.643 --> 00:02:11.323
 That guy, your fighting spirit, I have received it. 

00:02:11.407 --> 00:02:14.087
 4 times the energy 

00:02:14.307 --> 00:02:17.307
 Go ahead 

00:02:19.043 --> 00:02:24.043
 Super battery combined with volts ultimate battery 

00:02:43.654 --> 00:02:46.654
 If they overlap, the current will become stronger? 

00:02:46.843 --> 00:02:50.403
 When two different batteries are in contact, a current is generated 

00:02:50.563 --> 00:02:55.003
 Putting paper soaked in salt water in the middle will generate a stronger current 

00:02:55.287 --> 00:02:58.287
 Then stack multiple such devices together 

00:02:58.529 --> 00:03:01.529
 It will produce stronger and stronger current. Volt found this phenomenon 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.160
 This is the world’s first battery invented by Volt. 

00:03:06.224 --> 00:03:08.224
 After this, after many people's improvement 

00:03:08.485 --> 00:03:11.165
 The battery has developed into what everyone is using now. 

00:03:11.345 --> 00:03:14.345
 Volt, great! Great, volt!
