00:00:01.159 --> 00:00:04.309 

hi<00:00:02.159> I'm<00:00:02.639> not<00:00:02.820> even<00:00:03.120> a<00:00:03.240> hunter<00:00:03.570> and<00:00:03.840> this<00:00:03.959> is<00:00:04.170> the

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
hi I'm not even a hunter and this is the

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:10.220 
hi I'm not even a hunter and this is the
good<00:00:04.589> neighbors<00:00:05.100> cube<00:00:07.550> and<00:00:08.630> the<00:00:09.630> reason<00:00:10.019> I

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
good neighbors cube and the reason I

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.169 
good neighbors cube and the reason I
called<00:00:10.559> this<00:00:10.679> puzzle<00:00:11.309> the<00:00:11.490> good<00:00:11.820> neighbors

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
called this puzzle the good neighbors

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.369 
called this puzzle the good neighbors
cube<00:00:12.509> is<00:00:12.690> because<00:00:14.330> adjacent<00:00:15.330> faces<00:00:15.540> of<00:00:16.049> this

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
cube is because adjacent faces of this

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.650 
cube is because adjacent faces of this
puzzle<00:00:16.650> interact<00:00:17.250> with<00:00:17.430> each<00:00:17.550> other<00:00:17.699> you<00:00:18.449> see

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
puzzle interact with each other you see

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.560 
puzzle interact with each other you see
the<00:00:19.199> little<00:00:19.470> stripe<00:00:20.460> here<00:00:20.789> this<00:00:21.000> really

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
the little stripe here this really

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.410 
the little stripe here this really
fights<00:00:21.960> a<00:00:22.619> protrusion<00:00:23.369> that's<00:00:23.760> internal<00:00:24.330> in

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
fights a protrusion that's internal in

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.720 
fights a protrusion that's internal in
the<00:00:24.480> mechanism<00:00:25.019> it's<00:00:25.289> really<00:00:25.560> hard<00:00:25.800> to<00:00:25.920> see<00:00:26.099> so

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
the mechanism it's really hard to see so

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.839 
the mechanism it's really hard to see so
I<00:00:26.760> won't<00:00:27.150> show<00:00:27.359> you<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.630> mechanism<00:00:27.800> but<00:00:28.849> since

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
I won't show you the mechanism but since

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.970 
I won't show you the mechanism but since
the<00:00:30.060> little<00:00:30.210> stripe<00:00:30.660> is<00:00:30.990> aiming<00:00:31.740> in<00:00:31.830> this

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
the little stripe is aiming in this

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.030 
the little stripe is aiming in this
direction<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:33.149> yellow<00:00:33.450> stripe<00:00:34.020> I<00:00:34.350> can<00:00:34.649> turn

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
direction the yellow stripe I can turn

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.660 
direction the yellow stripe I can turn
this<00:00:35.840> this<00:00:36.840> way<00:00:37.079> but<00:00:37.680> I<00:00:37.710> can't<00:00:38.100> turn<00:00:38.309> it<00:00:38.489> any

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
this this way but I can't turn it any

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.020 
this this way but I can't turn it any
further<00:00:38.969> because<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:40.110> two<00:00:40.590> stripes<00:00:41.030> here

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
further because the two stripes here

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.029 
further because the two stripes here
shouldn't<00:00:42.719> be<00:00:42.899> in<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.440> same<00:00:43.680> direction<00:00:44.430> so

00:00:46.029 --> 00:00:46.039 
shouldn't be in the same direction so

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:49.880 
shouldn't be in the same direction so
this<00:00:47.039> one<00:00:47.309> blocks<00:00:47.969> like<00:00:48.629> a<00:00:48.660> good<00:00:48.960> neighbor<00:00:49.170> but

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
this one blocks like a good neighbor but

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.490 
this one blocks like a good neighbor but
I<00:00:50.309> can't<00:00:50.789> turn<00:00:51.030> this<00:00:51.480> one<00:00:52.039> like<00:00:53.039> this<00:00:53.280> but<00:00:54.239> then

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
I can't turn this one like this but then

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.680 
I can't turn this one like this but then
the<00:00:55.500> green<00:00:55.739> will<00:00:55.980> block<00:00:56.250> on<00:00:56.550> the<00:00:56.699> yellow<00:00:56.969> so<00:00:57.210> it

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
the green will block on the yellow so it

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.639 
the green will block on the yellow so it
blocks<00:00:57.930> and<00:00:58.289> this<00:00:59.190> is<00:00:59.399> really<00:00:59.730> a<00:00:59.850> confusing

00:01:00.639 --> 00:01:00.649 
blocks and this is really a confusing

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:04.060 
blocks and this is really a confusing
rubik's<00:01:01.649> cube<00:01:01.949> that's<00:01:02.539> internally

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
rubik's cube that's internally

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.130 
rubik's cube that's internally
completely<00:01:05.070> bandits<00:01:05.519> so<00:01:06.180> it's<00:01:06.330> sort<00:01:06.930> of<00:01:07.020> a

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
completely bandits so it's sort of a

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.030 
completely bandits so it's sort of a
nightmare<00:01:07.380> cube<00:01:07.979> but<00:01:08.479> since<00:01:09.479> you<00:01:10.200> can<00:01:10.439> see<00:01:10.680> the

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
nightmare cube but since you can see the

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.520 
nightmare cube but since you can see the
mechanism<00:01:11.220> at<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.760> outside<00:01:12.150> we<00:01:12.420> fight<00:01:12.750> in<00:01:13.320> his

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
mechanism at the outside we fight in his

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.350 
mechanism at the outside we fight in his
little<00:01:13.799> stripe<00:01:14.070> I<00:01:14.310> call<00:01:14.760> it<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.240> good

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
little stripe I call it the good

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.219 
little stripe I call it the good
neighbors<00:01:15.830> cube<00:01:17.240> so<00:01:18.240> here's<00:01:18.570> my<00:01:18.750> question<00:01:19.020> to

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
neighbors cube so here's my question to

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:27.020 
neighbors cube so here's my question to
you<00:01:22.310> if<00:01:23.310> you<00:01:23.580> randomly<00:01:23.960> assemble<00:01:25.850> the<00:01:26.850> good

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
you if you randomly assemble the good

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.120 
you if you randomly assemble the good
neighbors<00:01:27.390> cube<00:01:27.689> or<00:01:27.900> not<00:01:28.020> randomly<00:01:28.409> my

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
neighbors cube or not randomly my

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.090 
neighbors cube or not randomly my
question<00:01:29.579> to<00:01:29.759> you<00:01:29.909> is<00:01:29.939> how<00:01:30.840> many

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
question to you is how many

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.469 
question to you is how many
fundamentally<00:01:32.100> different<00:01:32.520> ways<00:01:32.729> are<00:01:33.270> there

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
fundamentally different ways are there

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.780 
fundamentally different ways are there
to<00:01:33.780> assemble<00:01:34.560> the<00:01:34.920> good<00:01:35.070> neighbors<00:01:35.460> cube

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
to assemble the good neighbors cube

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.960 
to assemble the good neighbors cube
where<00:01:36.450> its<00:01:37.140> center<00:01:37.770> has<00:01:37.950> a<00:01:37.979> protrusion<00:01:38.460> that

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
where its center has a protrusion that

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.690 
where its center has a protrusion that
can<00:01:39.630> be<00:01:40.350> oriented<00:01:40.680> in<00:01:41.009> each<00:01:41.250> of<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:41.520> four

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
can be oriented in each of the four

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.600 
can be oriented in each of the four
directions<00:01:42.240> the<00:01:42.750> two<00:01:42.960> protrusions<00:01:43.399> cannot<00:01:44.399> be

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
directions the two protrusions cannot be

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.600 
directions the two protrusions cannot be
at<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.030> same<00:01:45.240> directions<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:46.430> this<00:01:47.430> is<00:01:47.579> a

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
at the same directions and this is a

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.149 
at the same directions and this is a
hard<00:01:47.880> challenge<00:01:48.240> I<00:01:48.899> don't<00:01:49.110> know<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.470> answer

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
hard challenge I don't know the answer

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.429 
hard challenge I don't know the answer
myself<00:01:50.340> so<00:01:51.299> there<00:01:51.479> are<00:01:51.630> extra<00:01:52.049> bonus<00:01:52.380> points
