00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:08.910
 to write and read in Spanish with 

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:12.309
 veronica vargas 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.559
 I am verÃ³nica vargas and in this video 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:16.750
 We will continue to see other exercises 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:17.770
 very practical that will help you 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.080
 use it 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.170
 so you can write this kind of 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.840
 happy letter 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:26.060
 as I told you in the previous video we're going 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.190
 to keep practicing now let's see 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.230
 Other exercises you can do to 

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:31.990
 go loosing the doll to go loosing 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.800
 hand 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:38.489
 let's make circles all circles in 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.489
 circles 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.570
 all you have to do is 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:47.470
 circles in circular motion in this 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:49.310
 type of writing is basic circles and 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:52.400
 more circles 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:54.700
 circles circles and complete lines and 

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:59.400
 lines with circles 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:02.320
 circles are basic in this type of 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:06.040
 writing then there are many circles 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:08.920
 that is one other 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:11.370
 does this movement try to do this 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:15.140
 movement like this 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.140
 you go through what you've done 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:22.189
 and so you go through what you have done and 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.189
 you come back like this 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:29.260
 so many times 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.630
 this one out there looks more complicated but 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:34.210
 if you follow the steps and thus copies such 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.140
 which I am doing is not difficult because 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.890
 is 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.890
 you go up there 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.409
 turn 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.850
 at the same time 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:51.300
 you get to a point and go back down 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.610
 by the same line 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:56.950
 this is another of the exercises that 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.030
 you can do that is very useful 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.100
 if you want 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:04.330
 instead of doing this first you can 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.330
 do this alone 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:11.190
 that can be practical too 

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:11.190
 that alone 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:17.310
 for this side and then for the other side 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:22.290
 for the other side and many times 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.950
 for the right open to the right 

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:29.340
 and many times open towards 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.510
 left 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.510
 so you see 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:39.409
 many times the same 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:42.439
 the key in learning any 

00:02:39.409 --> 00:02:44.420
 thing but on the subject of writing it is 

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:48.140
 you have to repeat many times what 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:50.340
 same the same thing then this is 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:54.200
 another exercise 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.960
 another thing you can do is this 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.900
 is 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:00.930
 this seems messy appear 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.329
 curlers 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:05.519
 but this is giving you the practice to 

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:07.730
 that later you can write everything followed 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.730
 you see 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.980
 another exercise you can do is this 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:20.549
 It seems simple really is simple for 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.840
 there if you do not have practice writing 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:23.459
 it makes you complicated 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.959
 some of these exercises but not 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:28.220
 matter what what you have to do 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.220
 is to practice what is 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.560
 another is this 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:39.440
 they are like little balls 

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:45.710
 many of these balls many 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.739
 many balls 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:59.330
 the others are lines down 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:08.590
 down down down 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:14.200
 lines 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:18.459
 so oblique three oblique lines many 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:20.880
 oblique lines lines that go towards 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:20.880
 the right 

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:28.180
 so high 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:28.180
 chiquititas 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:41.220
 they are curved lines all 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:41.220
 curves like that 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:48.030
 lines 

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:50.810
 lines 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.810
 curves 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.650
 curves 

00:04:56.129 --> 00:05:02.460
 these are all exercises that are going to 

00:04:58.709 --> 00:05:05.960
 go helping to squeeze all the letters 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.960
 another you can do 

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:10.500
 low 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:17.110
 low 

00:05:13.599 --> 00:05:17.110
 and low 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:24.669
 and low 3 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:27.560
 all these things all these exercises 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:30.530
 they are very useful and practical I'll 

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:32.930
 I advise you to do it and repeat it and 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:34.850
 repeat many times until you already 

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:36.410
 leave or until your hand is already 

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:38.419
 agile 

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:40.400
 I invite you to then practice one and 

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:42.229
 again so that when it starts to 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.430
 writing the letters makes it easier for you 

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:45.560
 all 

00:05:43.430 --> 00:05:48.160
 try to do it and then you tell me 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:48.160
 how did it go
