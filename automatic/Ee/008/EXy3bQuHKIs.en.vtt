00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:26.300 
some crude language apparently sometimes
some<00:02:23.610> salty<00:02:24.000> language<00:02:24.030> and<00:02:24.810> chose<00:02:25.020> to<00:02:25.290> to<00:02:25.830> say

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
some salty language and chose to to say

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.000 
some salty language and chose to to say
that<00:02:26.550> I<00:02:26.760> listen<00:02:27.330> he<00:02:27.510> is<00:02:27.660> the<00:02:28.080> prerogative<00:02:28.260> I

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
that I listen he is the prerogative I

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:32.150 
that I listen he is the prerogative I
guess<00:02:29.250> to<00:02:29.520> to<00:02:30.150> say<00:02:30.840> those<00:02:31.110> things<00:02:31.860> when

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
guess to to say those things when

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.790 
guess to to say those things when
talking<00:02:32.430> about<00:02:32.760> racism<00:02:33.030> from<00:02:33.660> his<00:02:33.810> personal

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
talking about racism from his personal

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.460 
talking about racism from his personal
knowledge<00:02:35.010> and<00:02:35.430> and<00:02:35.700> and<00:02:36.390> it<00:02:36.840> has<00:02:37.050> a<00:02:37.080> unique

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
knowledge and and and it has a unique

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:38.960 
knowledge and and and it has a unique
perspective<00:02:37.770> obviously<00:02:38.550> as<00:02:38.640> the<00:02:38.790> first

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
perspective obviously as the first

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.270 
perspective obviously as the first
african-american<00:02:39.690> president<00:02:39.810> but<00:02:40.590> I<00:02:40.770> think

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
african-american president but I think

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.970 
african-american president but I think
it'll<00:02:42.000> raise<00:02:42.180> some<00:02:42.390> eyebrows<00:02:42.750> and<00:02:43.050> you'll

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
it'll raise some eyebrows and you'll

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.140 
it'll raise some eyebrows and you'll
probably<00:02:44.070> have<00:02:44.370> the<00:02:44.430> White<00:02:44.550> House<00:02:44.730> response

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
probably have the White House response

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.670 
probably have the White House response
sure<00:02:45.390> there's<00:02:45.630> many<00:02:45.780> people<00:02:45.960> wondering<00:02:46.410> if<00:02:46.560> it

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
sure there's many people wondering if it

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.290 
sure there's many people wondering if it
was<00:02:46.770> only<00:02:47.040> there<00:02:47.250> that<00:02:47.400> he<00:02:47.520> would<00:02:47.670> say<00:02:47.880> it<00:02:48.090> and

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
was only there that he would say it and

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.870 
was only there that he would say it and
not<00:02:48.540> perhaps<00:02:48.930> in<00:02:49.320> a<00:02:49.590> State<00:02:50.010> of<00:02:50.040> the<00:02:50.160> Union<00:02:50.250> or<00:02:50.820> a

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
not perhaps in a State of the Union or a

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.150 
not perhaps in a State of the Union or a
more<00:02:51.150> public<00:02:51.510> address<00:02:51.840> if<00:02:52.200> he's<00:02:52.350> only<00:02:52.680> doing

more public address if he's only doing

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:54.740 
more public address if he's only doing
