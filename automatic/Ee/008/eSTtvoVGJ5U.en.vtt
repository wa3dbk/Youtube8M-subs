came up with and then once this is gone
I<00:01:24.900> can<00:01:25.860> possibly<00:01:26.549> plant<00:01:27.090> it<00:01:27.210> with<00:01:27.330> some<00:01:27.659> herbs

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
spinach is done or the beets are done

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.730 
spinach is done or the beets are done
maybe<00:01:33.509> I'll<00:01:33.720> still<00:01:33.990> have<00:01:34.110> time<00:01:34.409> to<00:01:34.439> put

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
maybe I'll still have time to put

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.560 
maybe I'll still have time to put
something<00:01:34.979> else<00:01:35.130> in<00:01:35.340> there<00:01:35.400> later<00:01:36.090> on<00:01:36.329> in<00:01:36.479> the

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
something else in there later on in the

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.550 
something else in there later on in the
season<00:01:37.939> now<00:01:38.939> that's<00:01:39.540> not<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.840> only<00:01:40.229> container

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
season now that's not the only container

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.539 
season now that's not the only container
I<00:01:40.770> started<00:01:41.369> I<00:01:41.490> got<00:01:41.729> three<00:01:42.240> more<00:01:42.479> little<00:01:43.200> ones

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549 
I started I got three more little ones

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:47.389 
I started I got three more little ones
so<00:01:44.549> I<00:01:44.579> figure<00:01:44.909> I'll<00:01:45.000> show<00:01:45.210> you<00:01:45.299> those<00:01:45.450> too<00:01:46.399> this

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
so I figure I'll show you those too this

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.760 
so I figure I'll show you those too this
one<00:01:48.229> and<00:01:49.229> when<00:01:49.500> we<00:01:49.560> bring<00:01:49.770> you<00:01:49.950> in<00:01:50.009> close<00:01:51.770> again

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
one and when we bring you in close again

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.980 
one and when we bring you in close again
with<00:01:52.979> this<00:01:53.130> one<00:01:53.340> I<00:01:53.369> put<00:01:53.670> radishes<00:01:54.600> in<00:01:54.780> the

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
with this one I put radishes in the

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.690 
with this one I put radishes in the
middle<00:01:55.259> and<00:01:55.439> I<00:01:55.530> believe<00:01:55.740> these<00:01:55.920> are<00:01:55.979> icicle

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
middle and I believe these are icicle

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.260 
middle and I believe these are icicle
radishes<00:01:57.090> if<00:01:57.420> I<00:01:57.540> recall<00:01:57.719> correctly<00:01:58.140> and<00:01:59.270> then

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
radishes if I recall correctly and then

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.060 
radishes if I recall correctly and then
down<00:02:00.540> each<00:02:00.719> side<00:02:01.140> I<00:02:01.969> planted<00:02:02.969> lettuce<00:02:04.070> so

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
down each side I planted lettuce so

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.670 
down each side I planted lettuce so
again<00:02:05.399> what<00:02:05.700> will<00:02:05.790> happen<00:02:06.119> here<00:02:06.479> is<00:02:06.680> the

came<00:03:17.220> out<00:03:17.430> a<00:03:17.700> couple<00:03:17.850> weeks<00:03:18.329> ago<00:03:18.510> and<00:03:18.810> knock

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
came out a couple weeks ago and knock

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.770 
came out a couple weeks ago and knock
this<00:03:19.320> thing<00:03:19.380> over<00:03:19.829> almost<00:03:20.760> all<00:03:21.150> the<00:03:21.299> dirt<00:03:21.510> fell

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
this thing over almost all the dirt fell

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.569 
this thing over almost all the dirt fell
out<00:03:21.959> so<00:03:22.230> I<00:03:22.290> just<00:03:22.350> scooped<00:03:22.890> the<00:03:23.010> dirt<00:03:23.190> up<00:03:23.400> and

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579 
out so I just scooped the dirt up and

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:26.090 
out so I just scooped the dirt up and
just<00:03:23.760> threw<00:03:24.090> it<00:03:24.180> in<00:03:24.299> there<00:03:24.540> all<00:03:24.690> loose<00:03:24.959> and<00:03:25.260> the

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
just threw it in there all loose and the

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:31.930 
just threw it in there all loose and the
very<00:03:26.280> next<00:03:26.459> day<00:03:26.720> the<00:03:29.720> dill<00:03:30.720> started<00:03:31.170> sprouting

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
very next day the dill started sprouting

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.850 
very next day the dill started sprouting
so<00:03:32.940> I<00:03:32.970> guess<00:03:33.239> I<00:03:33.420> was<00:03:33.600> being<00:03:34.019> too<00:03:34.200> nice<00:03:34.410> with<00:03:34.650> it

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:36.740 
so I guess I was being too nice with it
and<00:03:35.010> those<00:03:35.130> cats<00:03:35.459> kind<00:03:35.820> of<00:03:35.910> did<00:03:36.060> me<00:03:36.209> a<00:03:36.239> favor<00:03:36.510> by

and those cats kind of did me a favor by
knocking<00:03:37.140> it<00:03:37.260> over<00:03:38.570> and<00:03:39.570> I'll<00:03:39.660> give<00:03:39.840> you<00:03:39.989> a

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
guys last year when I first started I

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.009 
guys last year when I first started I
said<00:03:47.250> we<00:03:47.549> don't<00:03:47.670> get<00:03:47.910> a<00:03:47.940> lot<00:03:48.120> of<00:03:48.269> light<00:03:48.480> and<00:03:48.750> the

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.659 
seems to crack and I don't know if
that's<00:05:01.840> because<00:05:02.230> it's<00:05:02.380> got<00:05:02.560> too<00:05:02.800> much<00:05:02.830> clay<00:05:03.460> in

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:13.810 
up when it dries out if you have a

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:17.719 
up when it dries out if you have a
