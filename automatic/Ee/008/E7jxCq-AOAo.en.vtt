problem one of the things you'll see

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.819 
problem one of the things you'll see
first<00:00:54.030> behave<00:00:54.600> worse<00:00:54.989> problems<00:00:55.530> as<00:00:55.620> far<00:00:55.649> as

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
first behave worse problems as far as

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.639 
first behave worse problems as far as
lack<00:00:56.370> of<00:00:56.520> power<00:00:57.050> you<00:00:58.050> have<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.289> go<00:00:58.410> through<00:00:58.590> a

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
lack of power you have to go through a

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.170 
lack of power you have to go through a
couple<00:00:58.800> steps<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.430> be<00:00:59.609> able<00:00:59.699> to<00:00:59.789> properly

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
couple steps to be able to properly

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.910 
couple steps to be able to properly
diagnose<00:01:00.629> this<00:01:00.809> problem<00:01:01.230> such<00:01:01.680> as<00:01:01.710> looking

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
diagnose this problem such as looking

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.929 
diagnose this problem such as looking
for<00:01:02.190> leaks<00:01:02.960> cracked<00:01:03.960> hoses<00:01:04.640> broken<00:01:05.640> hoses

that's<00:01:06.150> how<00:01:06.240> I<00:01:06.270> came<00:01:06.450> across<00:01:06.570> this<00:01:06.840> problem

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
that's how I came across this problem

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.370 
that's how I came across this problem
here<00:01:07.590> now<00:01:08.600> because<00:01:09.600> of<00:01:09.750> the<00:01:09.869> failure<00:01:10.350> of

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
here now because of the failure of

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:11.990 
here now because of the failure of
injection<00:01:10.890> well<00:01:10.979> obviously<00:01:11.220> is<00:01:11.610> not<00:01:11.760> going<00:01:11.909> to

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
injection well obviously is not going to

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.130 
injection well obviously is not going to
start<00:01:13.820> so<00:01:14.820> first<00:01:15.330> we<00:01:15.450> have<00:01:15.570> to<00:01:15.659> do<00:01:15.810> is<00:01:15.930> we<00:01:16.049> have

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
start so first we have to do is we have

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.020 
start so first we have to do is we have
to<00:01:16.259> diagnose<00:01:16.710> it<00:01:16.950> so<00:01:17.130> he<00:01:17.250> did<00:01:17.430> that<00:01:17.640> now<00:01:17.970> we

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
to diagnose it so he did that now we

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.270 
to diagnose it so he did that now we
have<00:01:18.240> to<00:01:18.479> pull<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.439> injection<00:01:19.530> pump<00:01:20.070> out

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
have to pull the injection pump out

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.820 
have to pull the injection pump out
replace<00:01:20.880> it<00:01:21.270> see<00:01:21.990> if<00:01:22.080> it<00:01:22.170> runs<00:01:22.320> then<00:01:22.619> we<00:01:22.680> can

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
replace it see if it runs then we can

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.190 
replace it see if it runs then we can
move<00:01:22.920> forward<00:01:22.979> from<00:01:23.369> there

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
move forward from there

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.420 
move forward from there
one<00:01:25.200> of<00:01:25.259> another<00:01:25.409> main<00:01:25.770> concerns<00:01:26.130> we<00:01:26.250> came

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
one of another main concerns we came

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.160 
one of another main concerns we came
across<00:01:26.520> is<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.060> battery<00:01:27.390> is<00:01:27.509> not<00:01:27.689> being<00:01:27.960> tied

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
across is the battery is not being tied

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.980 
across is the battery is not being tied
down<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:28.770> also<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.729> TCM<00:01:30.420> is<00:01:30.600> not<00:01:30.750> anchored

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
down and also the TCM is not anchored

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.780 
down and also the TCM is not anchored
down<00:01:31.170> either<00:01:31.470> as<00:01:32.159> you<00:01:32.250> can<00:01:32.400> see<00:01:32.610> it's<00:01:32.759> just

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
down either as you can see it's just

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.350 
down either as you can see it's just
sitting<00:01:33.150> in<00:01:33.299> here<00:01:33.509> being<00:01:34.110> held<00:01:34.350> down<00:01:34.530> by<00:01:34.560> the

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
sitting in here being held down by the

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.060 
sitting in here being held down by the
bird<00:01:36.360> nests<00:01:36.570> of<00:01:36.720> wires<00:01:36.960> they'll<00:01:37.710> see<00:01:37.950> the

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
bird nests of wires they'll see the

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.670 
bird nests of wires they'll see the
batteries<00:01:38.430> sitting<00:01:39.329> here<00:01:39.450> loose<00:01:39.659> as<00:01:40.380> long<00:01:40.560> as

as well as they didn't hook up a wait to
start<00:02:13.700> light<00:02:13.940> so<00:02:14.780> there's<00:02:14.990> no<00:02:15.110> way<00:02:15.230> that<00:02:15.380> you

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
start light so there's no way that you

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.140 
start light so there's no way that you
even<00:02:15.710> know<00:02:15.860> that<00:02:15.890> these<00:02:16.250> codes<00:02:16.490> are<00:02:16.670> popping

even know that these codes are popping

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:19.930 
even know that these codes are popping
it's<00:02:17.780> kind<00:02:17.960> of<00:02:17.990> a<00:02:18.080> hidden<00:02:18.230> thing<00:02:18.560> that<00:02:18.940> people

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
it's kind of a hidden thing that people

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.400 
it's kind of a hidden thing that people
that<00:02:20.060> don't<00:02:20.270> know<00:02:20.360> how<00:02:20.450> to<00:02:20.480> wire<00:02:20.750> it<00:02:20.990> do<00:02:21.200> when

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
that don't know how to wire it do when

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.560 
that don't know how to wire it do when
they<00:02:21.500> do<00:02:21.620> these<00:02:21.740> conversions<00:02:22.370> another<00:02:23.360> thing

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
they do these conversions another thing

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.360 
they do these conversions another thing
is<00:02:23.750> that<00:02:23.780> they<00:02:23.990> use<00:02:24.200> the<00:02:24.500> wrong<00:02:24.860> throttle

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
is that they use the wrong throttle

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.090 
is that they use the wrong throttle
pedal<00:02:25.520> for<00:02:26.510> this<00:02:26.660> vehicle<00:02:27.470> it<00:02:27.709> will<00:02:27.860> make<00:02:27.980> the

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
pedal for this vehicle it will make the

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.340 
pedal for this vehicle it will make the
car<00:02:28.280> go<00:02:28.550> down<00:02:28.820> the<00:02:29.150> road<00:02:29.330> however<00:02:29.930> it<00:02:30.230> will

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
car go down the road however it will

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.140 
car go down the road however it will
continue<00:02:30.830> to<00:02:30.950> throw<00:02:31.190> a<00:02:31.459> check<00:02:31.820> engine<00:02:32.000> light

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
continue to throw a check engine light

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:38.080 
continue to throw a check engine light
so<00:02:33.140> it's<00:02:33.770> not<00:02:33.950> correctly<00:02:34.760> done<00:02:36.850> another<00:02:37.850> main

the galvanized metal is going to rust
eventually<00:04:15.460> and<00:04:15.870> it's<00:04:16.870> going<00:04:16.989> to<00:04:17.049> contaminate

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:17.709 
eventually and it's going to contaminate

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:19.800

the entire cooling system now what

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:21.120 
the entire cooling system now what
happens<00:04:20.110> is<00:04:20.230> when<00:04:20.380> you<00:04:20.410> contaminate<00:04:21.040> the

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
happens is when you contaminate the

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.040 
happens is when you contaminate the
cooling<00:04:21.700> system<00:04:21.940> you<00:04:22.360> could<00:04:22.510> clog<00:04:22.780> up<00:04:22.960> the

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
cooling system you could clog up the

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:24.300 
cooling system you could clog up the
radiator<00:04:23.380> which<00:04:23.560> is<00:04:23.680> going<00:04:23.860> to<00:04:23.920> cause<00:04:24.100> an

something<00:04:30.100> like<00:04:30.190> that<00:04:30.430> and<00:04:30.670> that's<00:04:31.090> could

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:31.390 
something like that and that's could

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:33.120 
something like that and that's could
cause<00:04:31.570> a<00:04:31.600> catastrophic<00:04:31.990> failure<00:04:32.380> as<00:04:32.860> far<00:04:33.040> as

like that

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:42.150 
like that
now<00:04:39.490> we<00:04:39.550> also<00:04:39.850> came<00:04:40.150> across<00:04:40.480> this<00:04:40.860> when<00:04:41.860> we<00:04:41.980> did

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160 
now we also came across this when we did

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:44.640 
now we also came across this when we did
the<00:04:42.310> front<00:04:42.550> clip<00:04:42.960> that<00:04:43.960> wasn't<00:04:44.530> done<00:04:44.620> properly

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:44.650 
the front clip that wasn't done properly

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.880 
the front clip that wasn't done properly
that<00:04:45.610> they<00:04:45.760> remove<00:04:46.270> the<00:04:46.450> lower<00:04:46.630> section<00:04:47.140> of<00:04:47.560> it

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:47.890 
that they remove the lower section of it

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:50.130 
that they remove the lower section of it
now<00:04:48.130> what<00:04:48.400> happens<00:04:48.760> when<00:04:48.940> they<00:04:49.660> had<00:04:49.810> made<00:04:50.020> the

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:50.140 
now what happens when they had made the

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:52.170 
now what happens when they had made the
impact<00:04:50.500> sensor<00:04:50.980> right<00:04:51.100> here<00:04:51.160> for<00:04:51.670> the<00:04:51.730> air<00:04:51.910> bag

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.180 
impact sensor right here for the air bag

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.630 
impact sensor right here for the air bag
and<00:04:52.330> I<00:04:52.450> put<00:04:52.630> it<00:04:52.720> on<00:04:52.750> the<00:04:52.990> bumper<00:04:53.350> which<00:04:53.920> could

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:54.640 
and I put it on the bumper which could

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.330 
and I put it on the bumper which could
be<00:04:54.730> pretty<00:04:55.390> dangerous<00:04:55.630> we<00:04:56.170> get<00:04:56.710> to<00:04:56.920> the<00:04:57.040> small

00:04:57.330 --> 00:04:57.340 
be pretty dangerous we get to the small

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:59.400 
be pretty dangerous we get to the small
fender<00:04:57.610> bender<00:04:57.850> or<00:04:57.880> bumping

00:04:59.400 --> 00:04:59.410 
fender bender or bumping

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:06.360 
fender bender or bumping
we<00:04:59.500> could<00:04:59.680> set<00:04:59.890> up<00:05:00.360> prematurely<00:05:05.370> in

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 
we could set up prematurely in

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:07.920 
we could set up prematurely in
conclusion<00:05:06.940> basically<00:05:07.120> we<00:05:07.510> went<00:05:07.690> through<00:05:07.840> the

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:07.930 
conclusion basically we went through the
