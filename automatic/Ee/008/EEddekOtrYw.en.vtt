00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:12.960
 8 bit guys and stunned office 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:17.869
 today let's see how to flash one 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:22.860
 custom rom on the tim view recovery 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:29.910
 or better than the tv recovery project ok 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:34.080
 let's go wake up the phone 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:37.050
 we go into recovery using them quick 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:40.220
 boot to enter the recovery find 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.780
 quite comfortable though 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:45.690
 within the Roma it should be 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.500
 enabled advanced reboot menu o 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.970
 which is perfect 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.820
 at this point he finds me inside 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:55.530
 of recovery this time unlike 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:58.199
 of my other usual guides on the flash 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.680
 of the Roma I welded directly into the 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.989
 external memory of the tg in the news my 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.530
 roma da frecciare then I go to 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.530
 to insert 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.109
 at this point I see if it has been detected 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.439
 in a very simple way 

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:22.619
 I go to see if there was or what is perfect 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:25.890
 been mounted I make sure almost every 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:28.320
 systematically to have before 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.859
 delete all of having the rom that you 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:35.789
 in this case it is necessary to use the optimus 

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:37.229
 g3 version 1.1 for lg g2 but this one 

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:39.630
 guide is universal for everyone 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.789
 I've already done a guide on how 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.979
 make a nandroid backup then in the 

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:45.149
 in case something goes wrong 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:49.170
 come back quietly 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:52.619
 so do a nando first from here ok 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:56.340
 always do it before we get to the point 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:02:00.569
 let's grow this rome let's go to do the 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:04.710
 wipe then wipe in this case we can 

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:07.380
 choose the factory reset wipe data that 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.390
 exits end al vic 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.989
 excluding internal memory 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:15.310
 let's take a look ok anyway 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:18.489
 I always select 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:21.640
 I recommend non internal storace 

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:24.430
 otherwise we make an ok swipe casino 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:29.340
 to wipe then at this point 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:33.340
 doing the wipe of the whole system 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:36.670
 expect a little ok perfect ha 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.620
 all done back we come back 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.920
 to the main screen at this point 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:44.530
 we install our rom for those 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:47.650
 were to install a rom for lg 2 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:51.870
 I recommend you install arrowheads first 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:56.739
 the baseband specific android land 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:59.530
 4.4.2 ok let's go do install let's go 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:02.200
 to look for our Rome 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:07.349
 at this point it is very simple to swipe to 

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:10.420
 flash confirmations so let's go flash 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:14.530
 in this specific case it should 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:18.090
 leave the roma installer and get me 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:20.099
 select the whole so let's say that 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.709
 it should be very simple in this 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:27.120
 In case I go this is a procedure 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:28.830
 specific for lg g2 but normally yes 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:34.370
 should come directly to the end 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:37.640
 flash dl without this screen 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:41.580
 without these ok screens we go on 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:44.849
 select 802 installation 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:47.040
 our device what we want 

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:52.190
 add I always add the task 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:55.440
 manager the file manager lg yes or no 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:59.790
 perfect boot animation I leave the stock 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:00.690
 on the contrary I leave the one there 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:04.410
 developer 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:06.000
 I go ahead to this point 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:09.450
 rom installation 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.099
 I repeat in normal conditions see 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.980
 you will remain on the main screen 

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:15.780
 of recovery on the classic screen 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.340
 recovery or see you too much 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:22.350
 because it takes some time for 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:24.960
 wrap this specific rom ok ha 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:27.720
 finished the flash of the rom as you can 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:30.620
 see through the roma installer in 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:35.910
 In this case we can save the lodz 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:38.700
 yes in case it should serve to the 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:42.050
 developer I call next 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:46.860
 at this point the Roma and barb 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:50.520
 ribotta your device now ends and I have 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:54.570
 having made this point our rom is beautiful 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:56.910
 it's flamboyant we obviously have to wait 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:59.760
 starting the system to get the 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:02.910
 certain that everything went well 

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:06.380
 well and hopefully that's it 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:06.380
 especially for me 

00:05:07.629 --> 00:05:20.659
 and already a good sign seems to have gone 

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:22.610
 all good but this was comfortable 

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:26.030
 flash the roma directly 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:27.889
 from external memory from chigi 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:29.240
 I thought there might be some 

00:05:27.889 --> 00:05:31.550
 problem 

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:34.250
 the first blow is always a little more 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:38.389
 long than normal because it has to load 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:41.169
 the whole system is all with the 

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:41.169
 nice company 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:46.750
 then guys come and visit us anyway 

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:49.840
 on the forum 

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:51.490
 out off beat the android globe forum 

00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.410
 let us ask you if you want some 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:54.700
 video in particular I don't know I am 

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:57.010
 thinking a little about everything he can 

00:05:54.700 --> 00:05:59.620
 serve in addition to the classic videos 

00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:02.520
 reviews of the Roma in this case 

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:06.970
 now seen a little more throwing on 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:10.300
 how to use the recovery that is always a 

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:11.860
 a bit strange 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:15.580
 i don't know let me know what you do 

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:21.280
 you want enough that you don't ask me for videos 

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:24.120
 hard no video art starts st romano 

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:24.120
 moments of panic 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:30.940
 in the end it could be a boot too 

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:34.720
 loop and therefore not boot boot loop 

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:36.820
 means that it always loads the boot like that 

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:40.930
 to the initial animation and then not 

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:50.800
 restart that this is one of those cases 

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:51.479
 a little patience patience and 

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:54.430
 confidence 

00:06:51.479 --> 00:06:57.100
 perfect and everything went ok, all right 

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:59.919
 i'm safe guys 

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:02.260
 nothing ok I now flash I finish 

00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:04.780
 to set up all my new rom 

00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:07.750
 thank you I recommend you come to 

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:10.169
 find it on the forum and make the requests 

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:11.740
