everything<00:00:13.510> let's<00:00:14.510> get<00:00:14.720> started<00:00:14.780> i<00:00:15.349> will<00:00:15.620> be

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:15.769 
everything let's get started i will be

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:17.919 
everything let's get started i will be
demonstrating<00:00:15.920> this<00:00:16.519> with<00:00:16.849> the<00:00:17.060> moto<00:00:17.329> g<00:00:17.720> 8

00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:17.929 
demonstrating this with the moto g 8

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:21.579 
demonstrating this with the moto g 8
gigabyte<00:00:18.619> version<00:00:18.999> i'll<00:00:19.999> be<00:00:20.390> using<00:00:20.589> speed

00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:21.589 
gigabyte version i'll be using speed

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:23.710 
gigabyte version i'll be using speed
test<00:00:21.919> to<00:00:22.159> check<00:00:22.489> the<00:00:22.880> speed<00:00:23.239> that<00:00:23.419> you<00:00:23.539> could

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:23.720 
test to check the speed that you could

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.040 
test to check the speed that you could
get<00:00:23.929> I<00:00:24.169> did<00:00:24.859> fast<00:00:25.159> forward<00:00:25.579> the<00:00:25.730> video<00:00:25.880> and<00:00:26.390> the

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:27.050 
get I did fast forward the video and the

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.290 
get I did fast forward the video and the
speed<00:00:27.380> is<00:00:27.529> really<00:00:27.949> not<00:00:28.130> consistent<00:00:29.060> as<00:00:29.149> you

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:29.300 
speed is really not consistent as you

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.839 
speed is really not consistent as you
could<00:00:29.479> see<00:00:29.509> right<00:00:29.749> here<00:00:30.319> it's<00:00:30.710> 13<00:00:31.339> megabyte

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:31.849 
could see right here it's 13 megabyte

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:33.700 
could see right here it's 13 megabyte
that<00:00:32.090> that's<00:00:32.780> not<00:00:32.960> the<00:00:33.020> speed<00:00:33.410> that<00:00:33.560> you

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710 
that that's not the speed that you

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.400 
that that's not the speed that you
usually<00:00:33.950> get<00:00:34.430> I<00:00:34.640> always<00:00:35.180> getting<00:00:35.660> around<00:00:36.020> one

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:36.410 
usually get I always getting around one

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:38.860 
usually get I always getting around one
megabyte<00:00:36.920> down<00:00:37.250> and<00:00:37.610> one<00:00:37.850> megabyte<00:00:38.330> upload

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:38.870 
megabyte down and one megabyte upload

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:41.320 
megabyte down and one megabyte upload
it's<00:00:39.530> not<00:00:39.770> really<00:00:39.980> consistent<00:00:40.820> just<00:00:41.090> for<00:00:41.300> a

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:41.330 
it's not really consistent just for a

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.210 
it's not really consistent just for a
comparison<00:00:41.870> i'm<00:00:42.140> going<00:00:42.320> to<00:00:42.410> also<00:00:42.560> test<00:00:43.010> my

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:43.220 
comparison i'm going to also test my

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.910 
comparison i'm going to also test my
wife<00:00:43.580> I'd<00:00:43.850> plan<00:00:44.390> just<00:00:45.050> to<00:00:45.200> show<00:00:45.410> you<00:00:45.440> what<00:00:45.560> I

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
wife I'd plan just to show you what I

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.280 
wife I'd plan just to show you what I
get<00:00:46.340> I<00:00:46.370> have<00:00:46.730> the<00:00:46.910> AT&amp;T<00:00:47.300> high-speed<00:00:47.990> wireless

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:48.290 
get I have the AT&amp;T high-speed wireless

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:51.430 
get I have the AT&amp;T high-speed wireless
I<00:00:48.710> believe<00:00:49.520> it's<00:00:49.700> the<00:00:49.880> second<00:00:50.300> tier<00:00:50.630> so<00:00:51.140> I<00:00:51.200> get

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
I believe it's the second tier so I get

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.690 
I believe it's the second tier so I get
about<00:00:51.560> 10<00:00:52.100> megabyte<00:00:52.610> down<00:00:52.940> and<00:00:53.240> one<00:00:53.780> make<00:00:54.079> up

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:54.700 
about 10 megabyte down and one make up

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.670 
about 10 megabyte down and one make up
so<00:00:55.700> with<00:00:55.940> the<00:00:56.090> 3g<00:00:56.510> plan<00:00:56.810> i'll<00:00:57.079> just<00:00:57.440> show<00:00:57.650> you

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.680 
so with the 3g plan i'll just show you

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.830 
so with the 3g plan i'll just show you
how<00:00:58.100> what<00:00:58.790> kind<00:00:59.000> of<00:00:59.060> performance<00:00:59.390> you<00:00:59.690> could

00:00:59.830 --> 00:00:59.840 
how what kind of performance you could

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.780 
how what kind of performance you could
expect<00:01:00.230> so<00:01:00.920> right<00:01:01.130> here<00:01:01.160> i'm<00:01:01.489> scrolling

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:01.790 
expect so right here i'm scrolling

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:18.189 
netflix also running in high quality

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:21.309 
netflix also running in high quality
netflix<00:01:19.189> also<00:01:19.520> runs<00:01:19.700> very<00:01:20.030> well<00:01:20.179> in<00:01:20.539> 3d<00:01:21.109> data

00:01:21.309 --> 00:01:21.319 
netflix also runs very well in 3d data

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:24.010 
netflix also runs very well in 3d data
plan<00:01:21.759> so<00:01:22.759> now<00:01:22.969> let's<00:01:23.240> do<00:01:23.389> a<00:01:23.420> real<00:01:23.749> world

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
plan so now let's do a real world

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.830 
plan so now let's do a real world
comparison<00:01:24.799> between<00:01:24.979> 3g<00:01:25.490> and<00:01:25.700> Wi-Fi<00:01:25.909> i'm

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
comparison between 3g and Wi-Fi i'm

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.260 
comparison between 3g and Wi-Fi i'm
going<00:01:27.020> to<00:01:27.109> be<00:01:27.200> loading<00:01:27.560> the<00:01:27.740> verge<00:01:28.039> calm<00:01:28.759> the

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
going to be loading the verge calm the

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.449 
going to be loading the verge calm the
verge<00:01:29.569> is<00:01:29.810> really<00:01:30.229> intensive<00:01:30.859> there<00:01:31.069> is<00:01:31.159> a<00:01:31.189> lot

00:01:31.449 --> 00:01:31.459 
verge is really intensive there is a lot

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:34.300 
verge is really intensive there is a lot
of<00:01:31.490> text<00:01:32.060> there's<00:01:32.270> a<00:01:32.359> lot<00:01:32.600> of<00:01:32.630> images<00:01:33.079> so<00:01:34.039> as

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
of text there's a lot of images so as

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.209 
of text there's a lot of images so as
you<00:01:34.459> can<00:01:34.579> see<00:01:34.819> from<00:01:34.969> the<00:01:35.179> time<00:01:35.740> 3g<00:01:36.740> speed<00:01:37.009> is

00:01:37.209 --> 00:01:37.219 
you can see from the time 3g speed is

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:40.029 
you can see from the time 3g speed is
about<00:01:37.340> twice<00:01:37.819> as<00:01:38.090> long<00:01:38.329> as<00:01:38.569> Wi-Fi<00:01:39.139> so<00:01:39.770> that's

00:01:40.029 --> 00:01:40.039 
about twice as long as Wi-Fi so that's

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:42.879 
about twice as long as Wi-Fi so that's
not<00:01:40.189> really<00:01:40.429> bad<00:01:40.850> bad<00:01:41.259> so<00:01:42.259> you<00:01:42.350> get<00:01:42.619> unlimited
