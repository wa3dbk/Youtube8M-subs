00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:06.430
 on the night of June 5-6, activists 

00:00:04.569 --> 00:00:08.230
 public traffic road control 

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:10.150
 together with an anti-trafficking committee 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:12.459
 corruption held another raid on 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:14.559
 activists watched the streets of simferopol 

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:16.170
 what happens on city roads like 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:18.279
 traffic police officers behave 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.500
 the Crimean capital and helped 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:22.570
 motorists cases if inspectors 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.609
 traffic police violated the law or subjected 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.859
 health hazards and lives of participants 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:28.749
 traffic about it happens this 

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:30.699
 quite often our film crew 

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:32.770
 joined the activists to 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:34.710
 fix possible violations 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.300
 or malpractice 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.220
 traffic police officers leaving the city street 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.780
 we saw a patrolman in front of us 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.940
 car which is already a few 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.100
 minutes created an emergency 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.750
 abruptly reorganized the activists' car 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.730
 barely managed to slow down otherwise 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.770
 collision would not be avoided 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:53.020
 to questions about the reason for such maneuvers 

00:00:50.770 --> 00:01:01.980
 traffic police officer began to be rude and said that 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:01:01.980
 he does not know what I am talking about 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:11.280
 peels off us we then drove you 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.280
 stopped in front of a stalin and deck 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.630
 well, how did you tell us yourself 

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:18.979
 members of the social movement 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.990
 road control 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:22.399
 traffic police officers not only ignore 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.319
 Traffic Laws 

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:26.390
 but also supposedly collaborate with 

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:28.250
 a group of individuals whose activists are very 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.500
 often seen alongside inspectors 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.299
 these are a few dozen people who 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.479
 regularly hamper activities 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:36.740
 road control on blocked 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:38.899
 here on the franc who is there side by side 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.829
 drive up beha it's worth it but we don't 

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:41.829
 we can just drive 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.520
 road control thinks these people 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.740
 are an organized group which 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.050
 constantly helps traffic policemen 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.270
 illegal methods of making money 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:59.580
 drunk drivers subscribe to 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.890
 protocols as witnesses and perform 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.420
 other assignments such as a car with 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.520
 Our crew tried 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.619
 cut blocked the road in order 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.020
 so we could not go for the crew of the traffic police 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.790
 for what purposes it was needed remains 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.400
 just guess after more than two 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.230
 hours of observation patrol cars one 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.300
 after another they began to go out of town in 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.980
 side of the vine supposedly for 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.890
 distraction of members of the social movement 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:26.060
 from the building of traffic police and committing 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.060
 unlawful acts 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:39.850
 she leaves us about this somewhere 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.920
 she got rid of and sharply 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:43.900
 we ask law enforcement agencies 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.180
 pay attention to what methods 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.770
 Simferopol inspectors decide their 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:50.170
 problems and whether they are worthy
