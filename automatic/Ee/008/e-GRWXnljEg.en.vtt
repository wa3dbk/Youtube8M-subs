 concrete floor for a start we extinct 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.399
 vodka water level 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:43.129
 introductory level is something unusual 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:45.200
 quite ordinary is flexible flexible tube

 This is the capacity of the wooden floor in the lag 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:02.390
 moisture is a beautiful word 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:09.530
 and what does it mean however now we all 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:11.360
 smart moisture is just bars from 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.400
 which consists of a frame for alignment 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.580
 floor for lag should not be applied 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.470
 planed boards 2 and 3 varieties and healthy 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:22.820
 softwood and softwood 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.240
 rocks of the board can have a dumb overview without 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.950
 bark 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.590
 moisture and pads must be 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.630
 moisture antiseptic follows 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.299
 lay across the direction of light from 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:34.880
 windows so that the boards are located 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:37.100
 along these directions between lags and 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:40.570
 walls should not leave a gap of width 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.570
 20 30 millimeters 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:49.229
 The owner must touch soundproof 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:53.100
 layer without gaps 12 glue and the flag should 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.869
 be at least 2 meters uneven 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.890
 surface should be at overlapping 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:02:00.509
 align laying under grandma's lags 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:04.880
 the height of the underground floor space on 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.880
 overlap of at least 10 millimeters 

00:02:12.359 --> 00:02:18.599
 lags attached to the floor with anchors 

00:02:15.249 --> 00:02:20.469
 in places where planted bosses 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:21.939
 the surface of all goods follows 

00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:24.189
 have one plane 

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:27.189
 evenness of laying the lag is checked in all 

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:30.760
 directions two meter rail 43 

00:02:27.189 --> 00:02:34.060
 should touch without a gap all the flag well 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:37.180

 this site wooden bars height 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:12.879
 lengthened 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:14.650
 it seems like two levels I did 

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:17.530
 then plywood shut 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.389

 continue 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:42.030
 underground space before laying 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.340
 cover boards must be cleared of 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.980
