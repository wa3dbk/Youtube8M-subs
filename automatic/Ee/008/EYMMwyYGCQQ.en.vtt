00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
made a cone shape or a triangle shape

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.260 
made a cone shape or a triangle shape
and<00:00:45.450> as<00:00:46.440> you<00:00:46.590> can<00:00:46.739> see<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.399> dress<00:00:48.059> is

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.250 
measuring out at about 33 inches now
let's<00:00:53.010> create<00:00:53.219> a<00:00:53.640> curved<00:00:54.090> shape<00:00:54.120> um<00:00:54.899> you<00:00:55.110> can

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
let's create a curved shape um you can

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.049 
let's create a curved shape um you can
either<00:00:55.440> chalk<00:00:55.710> this<00:00:55.920> out<00:00:56.100> or<00:00:56.340> use<00:00:56.550> measuring

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
either chalk this out or use measuring

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.069 
either chalk this out or use measuring
tape<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.600> you<00:00:57.960> want<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:58.170> cut<00:00:58.379> along<00:00:58.530> that<00:00:58.890> line

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:00.079 
tape and you want to cut along that line

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:03.439 
tape and you want to cut along that line
okay<00:01:01.079> so<00:01:01.140> as<00:01:01.410> I<00:01:01.530> cut<00:01:01.829> my<00:01:02.039> curve<00:01:02.399> I<00:01:02.670> fold<00:01:03.059> it<00:01:03.180> as<00:01:03.329> I

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
okay so as I cut my curve I fold it as I

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.950 
okay so as I cut my curve I fold it as I
go<00:01:03.660> to<00:01:03.719> make<00:01:04.140> sure<00:01:04.170> that<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.559> curve<00:01:04.799> is<00:01:04.979> even

cone shape that we have cut out and here
are<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.850> folded<00:01:21.450> sides<00:01:21.780> together<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:23.159> we're

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
are the folded sides together and we're

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.149 
are the folded sides together and we're
going<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.090> cut<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.840> top<00:01:25.049> of<00:01:25.259> our<00:01:25.409> triangle<00:01:25.860> off

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
going to cut the top of our triangle off

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.249 
going to cut the top of our triangle off
base<00:01:26.580> off<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:26.850> measurement<00:01:27.600> of<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.810> bus<00:01:28.049> that

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
base off the measurement of the bus that

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.030 
base off the measurement of the bus that
you<00:01:28.290> took

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
you took

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.510 
you took
I<00:01:30.439> suggest<00:01:31.439> cutting<00:01:31.650> it<00:01:31.860> a<00:01:31.920> little<00:01:32.130> smaller

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
I suggest cutting it a little smaller

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.630 
I suggest cutting it a little smaller
because<00:01:32.790> this<00:01:33.150> is<00:01:33.299> a<00:01:33.329> stretch<00:01:33.689> of<00:01:33.720> your<00:01:33.930> fabric

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
because this is a stretch of your fabric

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.039 
because this is a stretch of your fabric
alright<00:01:35.640> based<00:01:35.850> upon<00:01:36.090> your<00:01:36.270> bust<00:01:36.540> measurement
