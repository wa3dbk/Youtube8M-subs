00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:06.450
 good how to mount the introduction for example 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:08.639
 if we had how we have conflicts in Syria 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:13.170
 or the fall in interest rates from the last few days to 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:15.120
 people would be very risky until 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.880
 I received this question I thought about riding 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.470
 an introduction and then I said people are 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.880
 very risky if I do it because 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:26.519
 looks only at the last in the last 11 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.949
 We had to go through the 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.660
 online more than two thousand people 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.329
 already wondered if two thousand people 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.059
 to place a copy of the 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.940
 introduction I wrote 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.460
 if by chance it is really a theme 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.879
 how does the interest rate decrease and I 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:48.210
 I write an introduction with a well done 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.640
 and well organized with the drop in interest 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.100
 and then two thousand people attend solve 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.719
 copying this will be collective zero for 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.410
 everyone because they will realize that 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.360
 it's copy 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.550
 the first made the second made the third 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.309
 made then it is extremely risky to 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.260
 people riding one is not always talking about this 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:06.390
 I have horror of these structures that the 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.250
 people rides that they are ready because 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.630
 have the tendency to copy and the text has 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.549
 what to be yours 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.040
 so it does not really matter what theme 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.200
 no matter if it is the conflict in syria 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.600
 no matter whether it is the decline in interest rates of 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.119
 last days it does not matter if it's the 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.630
 difficulty a frontier work of the 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:27.659
 the federal police or whether it is the 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.990
 security in internet banking all 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:33.030
 introduction of basic form that you know 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.470
 it will not drag if it does it goes 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.549
 be composed of what I said in the 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:42.320
 corner theme and thesis theme is a subject 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:47.939
 that I'm going to work thesis is the opinion 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:51.210
 that I will defend is the opinion is the 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:54.510
 point of view that will be defended 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.850
 text then the interest 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:02:03.330
 was needed was no longer time to 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:06.750
 this is a thesis or must have 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:09.690
 careful down pa interest of 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.570
 because there are major problems in 

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:16.620
 relation to the employee 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:22.680
 this is a thesis the fiat car is good the 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:24.810
 fiat car is bad and this is thesis is 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.330
 possible to do a good job in the 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:30.120
 borders of the country even with a 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:33.930
 minor of police 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.940
 this is opinion thesis point of view what 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.110
 can not miss in its introduction is the 

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.780
 your thesis 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.570
 and she can not be mine she can not 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.800
 be from the writing book it has to be 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:47.940
 your 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:50.520
 You have to create your thesis. 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:53.130
 from the theme then you will read the 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:55.110
 Topic understand what he gave you the theme 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.610
 and from the moment you understand the 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:01.530
 theme, you 're going to question what I 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:03.570
 I think of the subject what you think it is 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.580
 your thesis 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:07.680
 and this is what you will put in your 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.820
 introduction that is what will be defended 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.820
 in your text
