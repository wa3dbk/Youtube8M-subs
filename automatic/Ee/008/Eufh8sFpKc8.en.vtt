00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
kids that did so you widen up until you

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.219 
kids that did so you widen up until you
have<00:01:33.920> eight<00:01:34.920> little<00:01:35.390> spit<00:01:36.390> balls<00:01:36.630> so<00:01:36.869> to<00:01:36.930> speak

and then once you have that you just

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.740 
and then once you have that you just
take<00:01:41.400> them<00:01:41.490> one<00:01:41.640> by<00:01:41.670> one<00:01:41.790> and<00:01:42.030> be<00:01:42.299> careful<00:01:42.600> with

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.260 
take them one by one and be careful with
them<00:01:42.869> because<00:01:42.990> they're<00:01:43.229> damp<00:01:44.000> and<00:01:45.000> if<00:01:45.119> you're

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
them because they're damp and if you're

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.840 
them because they're damp and if you're
using<00:01:45.450> paper<00:01:45.869> not<00:01:46.229> cardstock<00:01:46.829> they're<00:01:47.100> you

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
using paper not cardstock they're you

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.660 
using paper not cardstock they're you
know<00:01:49.100> fairly<00:01:50.100> fragile<00:01:50.610> and<00:01:51.259> then<00:01:52.259> you<00:01:53.220> open<00:01:53.430> up

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
know fairly fragile and then you open up

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.959 
know fairly fragile and then you open up
all<00:01:53.850> eight<00:01:54.240> of<00:01:54.270> them<00:01:54.600> and<00:01:55.399> just<00:01:56.399> stack<00:01:56.700> them<00:01:56.880> on

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
all eight of them and just stack them on

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.330 
all eight of them and just stack them on
top<00:01:57.030> of<00:01:57.240> each<00:01:57.479> other<00:01:57.710> they<00:01:58.710> don't<00:01:58.829> have<00:01:59.070> to<00:01:59.189> be

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
top of each other they don't have to be

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.240 
top of each other they don't have to be
lined<00:01:59.909> up<00:02:00.180> in<00:02:01.189> any<00:02:02.189> particular<00:02:02.549> order<00:02:03.149> and

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:04.250 
lined up in any particular order and

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.150 
lined up in any particular order and
then<00:02:05.250> I<00:02:05.310> just<00:02:05.549> take<00:02:05.820> my<00:02:05.880> whole<00:02:06.740> paper<00:02:07.740> piercer

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
then I just take my whole paper piercer

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.680 
then I just take my whole paper piercer
and<00:02:09.709> Pierce<00:02:10.709> a<00:02:10.890> hole<00:02:11.330> through<00:02:12.330> the<00:02:12.450> little

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
and Pierce a hole through the little

and Pierce a hole through the little
stack

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
stack

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.550 
stack
and<00:02:14.520> just<00:02:14.910> kind<00:02:15.090> of<00:02:15.120> wiggle<00:02:15.540> it<00:02:15.630> around<00:02:15.720> just

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
and just kind of wiggle it around just

one of the nice things too about

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.410 
one of the nice things too about
dampening<00:03:22.530> the<00:03:22.830> paper<00:03:23.130> before<00:03:23.880> you<00:03:24.090> do<00:03:24.300> it

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 
dampening the paper before you do it

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.710 
dampening the paper before you do it
when<00:03:24.660> the<00:03:25.620> flower<00:03:25.890> is<00:03:26.190> finished<00:03:26.490> and<00:03:27.000> the

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:27.720 
when the flower is finished and the

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.110 
when the flower is finished and the
paper<00:03:27.930> dries<00:03:28.260> it<00:03:28.680> holds<00:03:29.100> that<00:03:29.220> shape<00:03:29.580> really

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
paper dries it holds that shape really

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.670 
paper dries it holds that shape really
really<00:03:30.720> well<00:03:30.900> and<00:03:31.140> then<00:03:31.350> what<00:03:31.530> I<00:03:31.560> did

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
really well and then what I did

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.330 
really well and then what I did
afterwards<00:03:32.459> is<00:03:32.720> just<00:03:33.950> sprayed<00:03:34.950> the<00:03:35.100> finish

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.160 
afterwards is just sprayed the finish
blossom<00:03:36.060> with<00:03:36.240> some<00:03:36.450> glimmer<00:03:36.660> mist<00:03:36.810> just<00:03:37.020> to

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
blossom with some glimmer mist just to

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.860 
blossom with some glimmer mist just to
give<00:03:37.290> it<00:03:37.320> a<00:03:37.410> little<00:03:37.560> extra<00:03:37.680> shimmer<00:03:38.810> so<00:03:39.810> I'm

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
give it a little extra shimmer so I'm

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.530 
give it a little extra shimmer so I'm
almost<00:03:40.110> done

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 
almost done

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.520 
almost done
squishing<00:03:42.540> my<00:03:42.660> flower<00:03:42.900> petals<00:03:43.430> and<00:03:45.530> something

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
squishing my flower petals and something

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.170 
squishing my flower petals and something
else<00:03:46.680> that<00:03:46.890> the<00:03:46.980> water<00:03:47.190> does<00:03:47.459> I<00:03:47.760> tried<00:03:48.000> making

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
else that the water does I tried making

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:49.280 
else that the water does I tried making
something<00:03:48.480> with<00:03:48.660> them<00:03:48.780> without<00:03:48.870> the<00:03:49.110> water

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
something with them without the water

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.380 
something with them without the water
and<00:03:49.530> I<00:03:49.590> actually<00:03:49.830> like<00:03:50.220> using<00:03:50.580> the<00:03:50.850> water<00:03:51.060> even

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
and I actually like using the water even

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:55.160 
and I actually like using the water even
with<00:03:51.720> paper<00:03:52.430> not<00:03:53.430> just<00:03:53.670> a<00:03:53.760> card<00:03:54.000> stock<00:03:54.300> because

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
with paper not just a card stock because

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:57.770 
with paper not just a card stock because
it<00:03:55.410> gives<00:03:55.620> the<00:03:55.860> flowers<00:03:56.340> that<00:03:56.370> kind<00:03:57.330> of<00:03:57.420> worn

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:57.780 
it gives the flowers that kind of worn

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.590
