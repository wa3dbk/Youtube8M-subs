minimalist and very soft flat themes and

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:48.669 
minimalist and very soft flat themes and
I<00:00:47.390> think<00:00:47.839> they're<00:00:47.899> pretty<00:00:48.019> nice<00:00:48.289> but<00:00:48.499> just

00:00:48.669 --> 00:00:48.679 
I think they're pretty nice but just

00:00:48.679 --> 00:00:50.049 
I think they're pretty nice but just
bear<00:00:48.829> in<00:00:48.920> mind<00:00:48.949> that<00:00:49.190> for<00:00:49.370> the<00:00:49.489> time<00:00:49.609> being<00:00:49.910> so

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:50.059 
bear in mind that for the time being so

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:51.910 
bear in mind that for the time being so
they'll<00:00:50.210> be<00:00:50.300> printing<00:00:50.659> more<00:00:50.809> of<00:00:50.929> reviews<00:00:51.800> to

they'll be printing more of reviews to

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.319 
they'll be printing more of reviews to
come<00:00:52.129> to<00:00:52.280> stay<00:00:52.460> tuned<00:00:52.670> to<00:00:52.789> the<00:00:52.879> channel<00:00:52.909> for

00:00:53.319 --> 00:00:53.329 
come to stay tuned to the channel for

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:55.209

taking<00:00:55.489> a<00:00:55.699> look<00:00:55.820> at<00:00:55.969> is<00:00:56.120> one<00:00:56.300> called<00:00:56.480> fret<00:00:56.749> 7

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
make everything a little bit smaller and

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.570 
make everything a little bit smaller and
I<00:02:11.900> do<00:02:11.960> think<00:02:12.320> that<00:02:12.470> where<00:02:13.070> I've<00:02:13.130> been<00:02:13.220> using<00:02:13.400> a

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
I do think that where I've been using a

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.100 
I do think that where I've been using a
theme<00:02:13.760> for<00:02:13.790> a<00:02:13.940> long<00:02:14.090> time<00:02:14.300> on<00:02:14.480> all<00:02:14.660> my<00:02:14.780> iOS

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
devices the the stock APPL icons I do

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.810 
devices the the stock APPL icons I do
feel<00:02:18.020> a<00:02:18.050> little<00:02:18.350> bit<00:02:18.500> too<00:02:18.680> big<00:02:18.950> and<00:02:19.190> so

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 
feel a little bit too big and so

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.130 
feel a little bit too big and so
something<00:02:20.120> like<00:02:20.150> this<00:02:20.420> just<00:02:20.480> makes<00:02:20.780> them<00:02:20.989> look

redesign ok guys so next up we're taking
a<00:02:34.610> look<00:02:34.670> at<00:02:34.790> a<00:02:34.820> thing<00:02:34.880> called<00:02:35.330> any<00:02:35.570> con<00:02:35.870> again

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
a look at a thing called any con again

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.170 
a look at a thing called any con again
these<00:02:37.040> all<00:02:37.280> these<00:02:37.580> things<00:02:37.760> are<00:02:37.880> kind<00:02:38.090> of

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
these all these things are kind of

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.490 
these all these things are kind of
similar<00:02:38.330> but<00:02:38.660> i<00:02:38.720> think<00:02:39.020> this<00:02:39.140> one<00:02:39.350> in

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
similar but i think this one in

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.230 
similar but i think this one in
particular<00:02:39.560> is<00:02:39.920> really<00:02:40.550> nice<00:02:40.730> again<00:02:41.030> just

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:41.240 
particular is really nice again just

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.360 
particular is really nice again just
because<00:02:41.360> i<00:02:41.660> think<00:02:42.050> it<00:02:42.290> resizes<00:02:42.680> the<00:02:42.920> icon<00:02:43.250> to

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
because i think it resizes the icon to

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.580 
because i think it resizes the icon to
be<00:02:43.430> the<00:02:43.550> perfect<00:02:43.790> size<00:02:44.150> and<00:02:44.420> just<00:02:45.140> some<00:02:45.260> really

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:45.590 
be the perfect size and just some really

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.980 
be the perfect size and just some really
nice<00:02:45.800> icons<00:02:46.310> here<00:02:46.520> just<00:02:46.760> give<00:02:46.940> them<00:02:47.240> go<00:02:47.780> hard

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:47.990
