00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
for some reason I just think the either

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.999 
for some reason I just think the either
it's<00:02:08.640> just<00:02:09.539> too<00:02:09.899> hard<00:02:10.110> for<00:02:10.229> them<00:02:10.470> to<00:02:10.500> spawn

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
it's just too hard for them to spawn

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.190 
it's just too hard for them to spawn
them<00:02:11.190> just<00:02:11.819> too<00:02:11.940> many<00:02:12.060> people<00:02:12.360> in<00:02:12.510> the<00:02:12.989> same

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
them just too many people in the same

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.910 
them just too many people in the same

over head and it
funny<00:04:26.650> I<00:04:27.280> thought<00:04:27.670> I<00:04:28.150> didn't<00:04:28.450> think<00:04:28.630> they

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:33.930 
would spawn on the sides I think and
they<00:04:30.910> do<00:04:31.110> it's<00:04:32.110> just<00:04:32.350> that<00:04:32.550> when<00:04:33.550> you<00:04:33.640> kill

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:57.930 
kill somebody in front of you they're
probably<00:05:56.170> going<00:05:56.410> to<00:05:56.500> expand<00:05:56.860> adjacent<00:05:57.730> like<00:05:57.850> I

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:57.940 
probably going to expand adjacent like I

00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:59.220 
probably going to expand adjacent like I
killed<00:05:58.180> that<00:05:58.240> guy<00:05:58.420> he's<00:05:58.900> probably<00:05:58.990> gonna

00:05:59.220 --> 00:05:59.230 
killed that guy he's probably gonna

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:01.890 
killed that guy he's probably gonna
spawn<00:05:59.530> in<00:05:59.890> the<00:06:00.010> corner<00:06:00.430> on<00:06:00.610> the<00:06:01.540> other<00:06:01.690> side<00:06:01.870> of

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:01.900 
spawn in the corner on the other side of

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:03.960 
spawn in the corner on the other side of
the<00:06:02.050> map<00:06:02.200> so<00:06:03.100> that's<00:06:03.280> what<00:06:03.460> I<00:06:03.490> looked<00:06:03.730> at<00:06:03.850> on

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:03.970 
the map so that's what I looked at on

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:05.760 
the map so that's what I looked at on
the<00:06:04.060> overhead<00:06:04.360> I<00:06:04.420> started<00:06:04.930> noticing<00:06:04.960> that<00:06:05.470> and

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:05.770 
the overhead I started noticing that and

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:08.400 
the overhead I started noticing that and
I<00:06:06.130> was<00:06:06.670> like<00:06:06.760> pretty<00:06:07.120> weird<00:06:07.450> but<00:06:08.050> that's<00:06:08.200> just

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:08.410 
I was like pretty weird but that's just

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:10.380 
I was like pretty weird but that's just
the<00:06:08.530> way<00:06:08.740> it<00:06:08.920> works<00:06:09.040> in<00:06:09.310> these<00:06:09.430> bonds<00:06:09.700> I<00:06:09.910> mean

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:10.390 
the way it works in these bonds I mean

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:11.550 
the way it works in these bonds I mean
there's<00:06:10.570> really<00:06:10.720> nothing<00:06:11.050> you<00:06:11.080> could<00:06:11.260> do<00:06:11.380> it's

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:11.560 
there's really nothing you could do it's

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:14.580 
there's really nothing you could do it's
not<00:06:11.800> really<00:06:12.130> a<00:06:12.160> big<00:06:12.370> map<00:06:12.870> this<00:06:13.870> particular<00:06:14.230> map

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:14.590 
not really a big map this particular map

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:16.860 
not really a big map this particular map
is<00:06:14.770> just<00:06:14.980> won<00:06:15.220> the<00:06:15.340> last<00:06:15.580> square<00:06:16.030> it<00:06:16.420> just

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:16.870 
is just won the last square it just

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:18.540 
is just won the last square it just
looks<00:06:17.140> big<00:06:17.410> because<00:06:17.680> everything<00:06:17.980> is<00:06:18.070> vertical

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:18.550 
looks big because everything is vertical

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:21.870 
looks big because everything is vertical
it's<00:06:18.730> not<00:06:18.940> really<00:06:19.240> that<00:06:19.360> big<00:06:20.580> look<00:06:21.580> I<00:06:21.700> got

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:21.880 
it's not really that big look I got

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:24.780 
it's not really that big look I got
knifed<00:06:22.120> and<00:06:22.420> I<00:06:22.600> had<00:06:22.780> to<00:06:23.020> end<00:06:23.620> before<00:06:24.370> that<00:06:24.760> I

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:24.790 
knifed and I had to end before that I

00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:26.790 
knifed and I had to end before that I
had<00:06:24.970> two<00:06:25.300> guys<00:06:25.540> that<00:06:25.810> were<00:06:25.930> right<00:06:26.170> by<00:06:26.380> me<00:06:26.620> and

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:26.800 
had two guys that were right by me and

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.520 
had two guys that were right by me and
then<00:06:27.280> I<00:06:27.460> get<00:06:27.760> knifed<00:06:28.000> and<00:06:28.450> then<00:06:29.200> all<00:06:29.410> of<00:06:29.440> a

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:29.530 
then I get knifed and then all of a

00:06:29.530 --> 00:06:33.060 
then I get knifed and then all of a
sudden<00:06:29.560> I<00:06:31.020> could<00:06:32.020> have<00:06:32.110> had<00:06:32.200> my<00:06:32.530> streaks<00:06:32.860> come

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:33.070 
sudden I could have had my streaks come

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:35.610 
sudden I could have had my streaks come
but<00:06:33.340> did<00:06:33.730> see<00:06:34.030> there's<00:06:34.390> just<00:06:34.570> nowhere<00:06:35.290> to<00:06:35.440> hide

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:35.620 
but did see there's just nowhere to hide

got<00:06:41.420> to<00:06:41.450> do<00:06:41.660> so<00:06:42.620> but<00:06:43.190> anyways<00:06:43.460> the<00:06:43.760> ump<00:06:43.970> I<00:06:44.240> would

00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:44.600 
got to do so but anyways the ump I would

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:46.660 
got to do so but anyways the ump I would
say<00:06:44.810> it's<00:06:44.870> not<00:06:45.260> the<00:06:45.530> best<00:06:45.740> of<00:06:46.070> weapons<00:06:46.490> here

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:46.670 
say it's not the best of weapons here

00:06:46.670 --> 00:06:49.930 
say it's not the best of weapons here
because<00:06:47.350> it's<00:06:48.350> just<00:06:48.410> not<00:06:48.620> fast<00:06:49.040> off<00:06:49.340> the<00:06:49.370> hip<00:06:49.730> I

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:49.940 
because it's just not fast off the hip I

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:52.590 
because it's just not fast off the hip I
mean<00:06:50.060> you're<00:06:50.150> going<00:06:50.300> to<00:06:50.360> need<00:06:50.600> a<00:06:50.630> fast<00:06:51.290> medium

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:52.600 
mean you're going to need a fast medium

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:58.360 
mean you're going to need a fast medium
weapon<00:06:53.600> and<00:06:53.870> I<00:06:54.350> don't<00:06:54.680> know<00:06:54.830> like<00:06:55.990> I<00:06:57.370> would

00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:58.370 
weapon and I don't know like I would

00:06:58.370 --> 00:07:00.430 
weapon and I don't know like I would
it's<00:06:58.790> got<00:06:59.030> to<00:06:59.150> be<00:06:59.240> an<00:06:59.330> SMG<00:06:59.660> so<00:07:00.080> the<00:07:00.200> best

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:00.440 
it's got to be an SMG so the best

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:03.170 
classification I said of mp7 until they

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:05.410 
classification I said of mp7 until they
