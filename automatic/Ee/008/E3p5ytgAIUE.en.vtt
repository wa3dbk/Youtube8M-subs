00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.770
 the perfect screen welcome them in 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:09.300
 this new video then chatted Turks 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:11.639
 great visitors of my channel 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.009
 you already have 2000 mac 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:17.880
 so today I simply want to make you 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:21.630
 see a small overview of mine 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:24.740
 location as you see here and a small one 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:28.170
 let's review my mac mini 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:33.030
 so stay connected 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:36.110
 after the initials you will see it 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.110
 I forgot the acronym 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:56.079
 they forget about the newcomer Gianni Si 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:01:01.360
 gianni mail called gianni perfetto later 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:03.160
 have already shown very well 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.950
 see this my little one here 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:10.259
 two months' dog two and a half months 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:13.500
 so 3 big is called gianni mela 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:17.200
 days from sending the lyric one 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:22.360
 okay then after having redone see 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:28.000
 this I would say we can start with 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:34.300
 the station and with the mac nil then the 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:41.619
 my mac mini to a 2013 mac mini is a 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:45.610
 mac mini i7 with 16gb of ram and ssd 840 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:49.930
 of the samsung or connected an apple 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:51.700
 thunderbolt 27-inch display and how 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:54.340
 you have seen in the previous images ha 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:59.409
 had to install under the mini one 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:02.229
 a x2 master cooler to cool it 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:03.200
 but I don't think it's still going much 

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:06.439
 well why 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:09.769
 in hindle at 48 degrees more ho 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:13.730
 installed a sundisk card reader 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:16.670
 usb3 a noble blues I'm with 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.510
 registering a porsche hard disk now 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:23.269
 design 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:26.720
 the net 3 3 terabyte usb3 and others 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:30.230
 four hard drives connected via a 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.120
 unhcr usb 3 hub which i have to say it is 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.390
 very good although not much 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:39.049
 known type in stores that extra 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:44.900
 connected a bus system appear 3 

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:46.880
 series 2 another earth thing that has me 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.500
 driven to take this computer a 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.329
 computing power 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:54.410
 as you have seen it is also very fast in 

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:58.700
 all processes like open final cut 

00:02:54.410 --> 00:03:02.000
 so other things now for example I'm in 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:05.150
 rendering a hobby of a dwarf 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.389
 leasing of optical flow and as you can see 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:11.480
 obviously it takes quite a little 

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:12.799
 times may vary but it is anyway 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:17.660
 very fast in these processes 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:22.770
 quite heavy anyway 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:27.150
 I say this official rendering in 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:32.850
 optical flop was performed by a con 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:36.390
 then a 1080p clip of 30 seconds then 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:38.820
 fast enough to be a mac 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:41.670
 mini which is not a machine anyway 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:45.300
 strictly professional and as you can see 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:50.750
 also the preview is very, very much 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:53.610
 fluid however passing to another 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:55.920
 I have to recommend this mac mini 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:58.680
 practically everyone they want 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:01.440
 take a mac and don't want to own it 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.790
 spend a lot perhaps the only flaw 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.380
 is that there is no graphics card 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.410
 dedicated 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:11.340
 but if you don't use da vinci resort that is 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:15.480
 a program of color correction 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:17.669
 very advanced this difference between 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:21.390
 integrated graphics card and card 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:23.490
 external graphics are therefore not visible 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:25.680
 This mac mini recommend all 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:28.430
 especially for the quality ratio 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:32.910
 price that is very, very cheap 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:34.320
 to something I didn't say in the video 

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:38.210
 I'm sorry if I keep changing 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.210
 location for the videos but
