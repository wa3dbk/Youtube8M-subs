00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:08.320 
welcome to Professor pincushion and this

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:09.690 
welcome to Professor pincushion and this
tutorial<00:00:08.469> I'm<00:00:08.920> going<00:00:09.040> to<00:00:09.129> be<00:00:09.219> talking<00:00:09.460> about

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:09.700 
tutorial I'm going to be talking about

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:10.410 
tutorial I'm going to be talking about
ease

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:10.420 
ease

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.959 
ease
what<00:00:10.930> is<00:00:11.110> ease<00:00:11.559> I'm<00:00:12.219> going<00:00:12.490> to<00:00:12.550> be<00:00:12.639> discussing

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:12.969 
what is ease I'm going to be discussing

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:14.669 
what is ease I'm going to be discussing
the<00:00:13.179> answer<00:00:13.510> to<00:00:13.660> that<00:00:13.690> and<00:00:14.050> also<00:00:14.410> how<00:00:14.650> it

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:14.679 
the answer to that and also how it

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:16.049 
the answer to that and also how it
relates<00:00:15.190> to<00:00:15.309> the<00:00:15.519> finished<00:00:15.849> garment

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:16.059 
relates to the finished garment

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:18.060 
relates to the finished garment
measurements<00:00:16.689> so<00:00:17.259> let's<00:00:17.470> go<00:00:17.590> ahead<00:00:17.710> and<00:00:17.980> get

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:18.070 
measurements so let's go ahead and get

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.109 
measurements so let's go ahead and get
started<00:00:19.259> first<00:00:20.259> let's<00:00:20.470> talk<00:00:20.619> about<00:00:20.950> ease<00:00:21.340> so

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:22.119 
started first let's talk about ease so

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:23.310 
started first let's talk about ease so
when<00:00:22.360> you're<00:00:22.540> taking<00:00:22.750> your<00:00:22.960> body

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:23.320 
when you're taking your body

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:24.990 
when you're taking your body
measurements<00:00:23.919> what<00:00:24.070> you're<00:00:24.189> trying<00:00:24.460> to<00:00:24.550> do<00:00:24.759> is

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:25.000 
measurements what you're trying to do is

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.170 
measurements what you're trying to do is
determine<00:00:25.239> your<00:00:25.779> size<00:00:26.369> but<00:00:27.369> the<00:00:27.520> problem<00:00:27.939> is

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:28.180 
determine your size but the problem is

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:30.600 
determine your size but the problem is
is<00:00:28.450> that<00:00:28.779> most<00:00:29.439> clothes<00:00:29.890> or<00:00:30.070> some<00:00:30.309> clothes

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:30.610 
is that most clothes or some clothes

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.840 
is that most clothes or some clothes
aren't<00:00:31.210> meant<00:00:31.450> to<00:00:31.540> be<00:00:31.689> a<00:00:31.989> second<00:00:32.649> skin<00:00:33.010> so<00:00:33.640> what

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:33.850 
aren't meant to be a second skin so what

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.520 
aren't meant to be a second skin so what
pattern<00:00:34.210> makers<00:00:34.510> do<00:00:34.660> or<00:00:34.809> what<00:00:34.989> you<00:00:35.140> do<00:00:35.350> when

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:35.530 
pattern makers do or what you do when

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:37.380 
pattern makers do or what you do when
you<00:00:35.649> create<00:00:35.829> your<00:00:36.010> own<00:00:36.040> pattern<00:00:36.489> is<00:00:36.670> is<00:00:36.880> you

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:37.390 
you create your own pattern is is you

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:39.480 
you create your own pattern is is you
add<00:00:37.840> a<00:00:37.870> little<00:00:38.410> bit<00:00:38.590> of<00:00:38.680> measurement<00:00:39.220> to<00:00:39.460> the

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:39.490 
add a little bit of measurement to the

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:41.640 
add a little bit of measurement to the
original<00:00:40.240> measurement<00:00:40.660> in<00:00:40.810> order<00:00:41.230> to<00:00:41.380> make<00:00:41.530> it

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:41.650 
original measurement in order to make it

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.910 
original measurement in order to make it
a<00:00:41.800> little<00:00:42.070> bit<00:00:42.250> looser<00:00:43.380> the<00:00:44.380> measurement

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:44.920 
a little bit looser the measurement

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.460 
a little bit looser the measurement
added<00:00:45.370> to<00:00:46.060> a<00:00:46.090> garment<00:00:46.720> in<00:00:46.870> order<00:00:47.110> to<00:00:47.230> make<00:00:47.350> it

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:47.470 
added to a garment in order to make it

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:49.260 
added to a garment in order to make it
comfortable<00:00:47.710> to<00:00:47.980> move<00:00:48.190> is<00:00:48.370> called<00:00:48.580> functional

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:49.270 
comfortable to move is called functional

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.780 
comfortable to move is called functional
ease<00:00:49.660> this<00:00:50.260> is<00:00:50.410> so<00:00:50.560> you<00:00:50.620> can<00:00:50.710> raise<00:00:51.070> your<00:00:51.100> arms

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:51.790 
ease this is so you can raise your arms

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.270 
ease this is so you can raise your arms
twist<00:00:52.240> bend<00:00:52.600> over<00:00:52.930> sit<00:00:53.230> down<00:00:53.470> all<00:00:53.770> without

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:54.280 
twist bend over sit down all without

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.540 
twist bend over sit down all without
busting<00:00:54.760> a<00:00:54.790> seam<00:00:55.090> of<00:00:56.010> course<00:00:57.010> depending<00:00:57.460> on

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:57.550 
busting a seam of course depending on

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.400 
busting a seam of course depending on
the<00:00:57.610> fabric<00:00:57.910> some<00:00:58.510> garments<00:00:58.750> need<00:00:59.140> less

00:00:59.400 --> 00:00:59.410 
the fabric some garments need less

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:01.860 
the fabric some garments need less
functional<00:00:59.950> ease<00:01:00.190> than<00:01:00.550> others<00:01:00.940> take<00:01:01.630> for

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:01.870 
functional ease than others take for

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.109 
functional ease than others take for
example<00:01:01.900> a<00:01:02.500> fabric<00:01:03.070> like<00:01:03.340> knit<00:01:03.610> or<00:01:03.820> lycra

00:01:04.109 --> 00:01:04.119 
example a fabric like knit or lycra

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:06.539 
example a fabric like knit or lycra
these<00:01:04.869> fabrics<00:01:05.379> have<00:01:05.530> built<00:01:05.799> in<00:01:05.979> ease<00:01:06.250> because

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:06.549 
these fabrics have built in ease because

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:08.670 
these fabrics have built in ease because
of<00:01:06.729> its<00:01:07.000> stretchiness<00:01:07.420> so<00:01:08.170> something<00:01:08.530> like<00:01:08.560> a

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 
of its stretchiness so something like a

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.920 
of its stretchiness so something like a
bathing<00:01:08.979> suit<00:01:09.310> doesn't<00:01:09.700> need<00:01:09.940> any<00:01:10.150> ease<00:01:10.420> built

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 
bathing suit doesn't need any ease built

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.660 
bathing suit doesn't need any ease built
into<00:01:11.470> the<00:01:11.560> pattern<00:01:11.890> because<00:01:12.310> it<00:01:12.340> stretch

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:12.670 
into the pattern because it stretch

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.840 
into the pattern because it stretch
takes<00:01:13.030> care<00:01:13.270> of<00:01:13.300> it<00:01:14.070> this<00:01:15.070> is<00:01:15.130> also<00:01:15.460> why<00:01:15.820> you

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:15.850 
takes care of it this is also why you

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.149 
takes care of it this is also why you
can't<00:01:16.270> simply<00:01:16.600> interchange<00:01:17.500> one<00:01:17.860> type<00:01:18.130> of

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:18.159 
can't simply interchange one type of

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:19.920 
can't simply interchange one type of
fabric<00:01:18.640> for<00:01:18.850> another<00:01:19.120> when<00:01:19.510> the<00:01:19.600> pattern

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:19.930 
fabric for another when the pattern

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.800 
fabric for another when the pattern
specifically<00:01:20.620> asks<00:01:20.979> for<00:01:21.159> one<00:01:21.400> type<00:01:21.700> so<00:01:22.450> if<00:01:22.630> for

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:22.810 
specifically asks for one type so if for

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.300 
specifically asks for one type so if for
example<00:01:22.870> I'm<00:01:23.350> doing<00:01:23.650> something<00:01:23.979> like<00:01:24.010> this

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
example I'm doing something like this

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.280 
example I'm doing something like this
which<00:01:24.549> is<00:01:24.580> a<00:01:24.760> tank<00:01:25.090> top<00:01:25.270> normally<00:01:26.049> it's<00:01:26.170> going

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:26.290 
which is a tank top normally it's going

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:28.460 
which is a tank top normally it's going
to<00:01:26.380> ask<00:01:26.530> for<00:01:27.010> a<00:01:27.070> knit<00:01:27.460> or<00:01:27.640> a<00:01:27.700> stretchy<00:01:28.180> fabric

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
to ask for a knit or a stretchy fabric

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.410 
to ask for a knit or a stretchy fabric
so<00:01:29.470> if<00:01:29.620> I<00:01:29.710> decide<00:01:30.100> I<00:01:30.130> want<00:01:30.280> to<00:01:30.520> use<00:01:30.610> a<00:01:30.640> woven<00:01:31.000> I'm

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
so if I decide I want to use a woven I'm

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.030 
so if I decide I want to use a woven I'm
definitely<00:01:31.930> going<00:01:32.049> to<00:01:32.170> have<00:01:32.350> to<00:01:32.380> do<00:01:32.650> some

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 
definitely going to have to do some

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.399 
definitely going to have to do some
modifications<00:01:33.369> to<00:01:34.150> the<00:01:34.240> pattern<00:01:34.600> or<00:01:35.049> else<00:01:35.290> I

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:35.409 
modifications to the pattern or else I

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:36.660 
modifications to the pattern or else I
won't<00:01:35.619> even<00:01:35.740> be<00:01:35.920> able<00:01:35.979> to<00:01:36.100> get<00:01:36.220> the<00:01:36.369> tank<00:01:36.549> top

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:36.670 
won't even be able to get the tank top

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.450 
won't even be able to get the tank top
on<00:01:37.060> without<00:01:37.390> a<00:01:37.600> fastener<00:01:38.229> or<00:01:38.470> it'll<00:01:39.130> be<00:01:39.250> too

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:39.460 
on without a fastener or it'll be too

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:41.520 
on without a fastener or it'll be too
loose<00:01:39.670> or<00:01:39.970> there'll<00:01:40.270> be<00:01:40.299> no<00:01:40.390> darts<00:01:41.020> in<00:01:41.170> it<00:01:41.290> to

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
loose or there'll be no darts in it to

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.350 
loose or there'll be no darts in it to
shape<00:01:41.770> it<00:01:42.010> the<00:01:42.040> way<00:01:42.250> that<00:01:42.549> the<00:01:42.670> knit<00:01:42.909> normally

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
shape it the way that the knit normally

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.410 
shape it the way that the knit normally
fits<00:01:43.690> and<00:01:43.990> the<00:01:44.500> reverse<00:01:44.830> is<00:01:44.979> also<00:01:45.130> true<00:01:45.430> so<00:01:46.000> if

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
fits and the reverse is also true so if

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.270 
fits and the reverse is also true so if
I'm<00:01:46.570> making<00:01:46.600> a<00:01:46.960> woven<00:01:47.290> shirt<00:01:47.560> and<00:01:47.770> I<00:01:47.890> decide<00:01:48.250> to

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:48.280 
I'm making a woven shirt and I decide to

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.179 
I'm making a woven shirt and I decide to
use<00:01:48.460> a<00:01:48.850> stretchy<00:01:49.210> fabric<00:01:49.330> like<00:01:49.960> knit<00:01:50.380> it<00:01:50.619> may

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:51.189 
use a stretchy fabric like knit it may

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:53.880 
use a stretchy fabric like knit it may
be<00:01:51.250> loose-fitting<00:01:52.030> and<00:01:52.450> not<00:01:52.900> hang<00:01:53.290> exactly

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
be loose-fitting and not hang exactly

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.690 
be loose-fitting and not hang exactly
right<00:01:55.080> next<00:01:56.080> let's<00:01:56.110> talk<00:01:56.380> about<00:01:56.710> design<00:01:57.159> II<00:01:57.430> so

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
right next let's talk about design II so

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.130 
right next let's talk about design II so
when<00:01:57.820> a<00:01:57.850> pattern<00:01:58.119> maker<00:01:58.330> is<00:01:58.659> creating<00:01:59.049> a

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140 
when a pattern maker is creating a

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.980 
when a pattern maker is creating a
pattern<00:01:59.380> they<00:02:00.100> always<00:02:00.430> have<00:02:00.580> to<00:02:00.610> consider

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
pattern they always have to consider

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.359 
pattern they always have to consider
functional<00:02:01.990> ease<00:02:02.290> because<00:02:02.590> it<00:02:02.950> needs<00:02:03.159> to<00:02:03.280> be

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369 
functional ease because it needs to be

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:04.679 
functional ease because it needs to be
comfortable<00:02:03.640> for<00:02:04.030> you<00:02:04.119> to<00:02:04.150> move<00:02:04.360> around<00:02:04.479> in

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:04.689 
comfortable for you to move around in

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:06.510 
comfortable for you to move around in
the<00:02:04.750> garment<00:02:05.140> but<00:02:05.560> then<00:02:05.740> they<00:02:05.860> have<00:02:06.040> design

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
the garment but then they have design

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.399 
the garment but then they have design
ease<00:02:06.790> in<00:02:07.090> order<00:02:07.420> to<00:02:07.540> play<00:02:07.930> with

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:08.409 
ease in order to play with

00:02:08.409 --> 00:02:10.649 
ease in order to play with
so<00:02:08.769> if<00:02:08.830> with<00:02:09.009> that<00:02:09.250> they<00:02:09.549> may<00:02:09.759> add<00:02:09.970> extra

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:10.659 
so if with that they may add extra

00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:13.110 
so if with that they may add extra
inches<00:02:11.170> in<00:02:11.439> order<00:02:12.099> to<00:02:12.250> create<00:02:12.489> a<00:02:12.579> look<00:02:12.879> that

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
inches in order to create a look that

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.959 
inches in order to create a look that
they're<00:02:13.569> trying<00:02:13.870> to<00:02:14.010> design<00:02:15.010> so<00:02:15.549> in<00:02:15.730> the<00:02:15.819> case

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:15.969 
they're trying to design so in the case

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:17.490 
they're trying to design so in the case
of<00:02:16.180> this<00:02:16.299> tunic

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
of this tunic

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.320 
of this tunic
stead<00:02:17.620> of<00:02:17.650> being<00:02:17.770> just<00:02:18.130> a<00:02:18.250> form-fitting<00:02:19.000> tank

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330

stead of being just a form-fitting tank
top<00:02:19.570> it<00:02:20.200> has<00:02:20.410> extra<00:02:21.010> ease<00:02:21.160> built<00:02:21.760> in<00:02:22.000> in<00:02:22.210> order

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
to give it a less structured more flowy

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.350 
to give it a less structured more flowy
and<00:02:24.970> soft<00:02:25.060> appearance<00:02:26.040> if<00:02:27.040> we<00:02:27.850> take<00:02:28.000> a<00:02:28.060> look<00:02:28.240> at

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
and soft appearance if we take a look at

this chart you can definitely see the

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.550 
this chart you can definitely see the

lot of design ease built into it as

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.280 
lot of design ease built into it as
opposed<00:02:37.150> to<00:02:37.270> this<00:02:37.420> one<00:02:37.690> which<00:02:38.050> is<00:02:38.080> a

if you're looking at the description of

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.070 
if you're looking at the description of
a<00:02:45.880> pattern<00:02:46.209> envelope<00:02:46.390> and<00:02:46.810> it's<00:02:46.930> just

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
a pattern envelope and it's just

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.340 
a pattern envelope and it's just
something<00:02:47.260> like<00:02:47.850> loose-fitting<00:02:48.850> top<00:02:49.270> we<00:02:50.200> can

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
something like loose-fitting top we can

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.260 
something like loose-fitting top we can
look<00:02:50.560> at<00:02:50.680> this<00:02:50.920> this<00:02:51.220> is<00:02:51.280> loose-fitting<00:02:51.880> and

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
look at this this is loose-fitting and

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:54.449 
look at this this is loose-fitting and
it<00:02:52.420> kind<00:02:52.630> of<00:02:52.690> gives<00:02:52.840> you<00:02:52.959> an<00:02:53.080> idea<00:02:53.200> on<00:02:53.500> how<00:02:53.800> much

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
it kind of gives you an idea on how much

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:57.690 
it kind of gives you an idea on how much
ease<00:02:54.760> they're<00:02:55.510> adding<00:02:55.900> into<00:02:56.290> the<00:02:56.380> pattern<00:02:56.770> so

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
ease they're adding into the pattern so

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.090 
ease they're adding into the pattern so
for<00:02:58.150> a<00:02:58.180> dress<00:02:58.720> of<00:02:58.870> four<00:02:59.080> atop<00:02:59.410> the<00:02:59.739> bustline

for a dress of four atop the bustline

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.449 
for a dress of four atop the bustline
may<00:03:00.940> add<00:03:01.120> anywhere<00:03:01.630> from<00:03:01.780> 5<00:03:02.380> to<00:03:02.770> 8<00:03:02.800> inches

may add anywhere from 5 to 8 inches
extra<00:03:03.850> of<00:03:04.180> ease<00:03:04.630> and<00:03:05.470> then<00:03:05.560> they<00:03:05.770> have<00:03:05.950> down

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
extra of ease and then they have down

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:09.900 
extra of ease and then they have down

measurements and this is usually located

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.010 
measurements and this is usually located
on<00:03:15.520> the<00:03:15.580> back<00:03:15.730> of<00:03:15.760> the<00:03:15.910> envelope<00:03:16.090> sometimes<00:03:16.840> in

on the back of the envelope sometimes in
the<00:03:17.110> directions<00:03:17.350> and<00:03:17.650> if<00:03:17.739> you<00:03:17.830> can't<00:03:18.130> find<00:03:18.370> it

the directions and if you can't find it
in<00:03:18.670> either<00:03:18.820> of<00:03:19.000> those<00:03:19.180> spots<00:03:19.950> definitely<00:03:20.950> look

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
in either of those spots definitely look

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:23.310 
in either of those spots definitely look
on<00:03:21.489> the<00:03:21.820> pattern<00:03:22.209> pieces<00:03:22.450> themselves<00:03:22.780> so<00:03:23.230> you

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:23.320 
on the pattern pieces themselves so you

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:24.990 
on the pattern pieces themselves so you
can<00:03:23.560> see<00:03:23.709> here<00:03:24.010> the<00:03:24.190> marking<00:03:24.519> the<00:03:24.610> waistline

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
can see here the marking the waistline

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.070 
can see here the marking the waistline
and<00:03:25.269> they're<00:03:25.360> telling<00:03:25.540> you<00:03:25.720> what<00:03:25.930> the

finished measurement of the waist lines
are<00:03:27.940> going<00:03:28.330> to<00:03:28.570> be<00:03:29.310> now<00:03:30.310> this<00:03:30.760> measurement<00:03:31.299> has

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:32.080 
are going to be now this measurement has

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:34.800 
are going to be now this measurement has
all<00:03:32.530> the<00:03:32.860> ease<00:03:33.040> built<00:03:33.670> in<00:03:33.910> that's<00:03:34.269> why<00:03:34.480> this<00:03:34.540> is

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
all the ease built in that's why this is

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.520 
all the ease built in that's why this is
important<00:03:35.370> so<00:03:36.370> if<00:03:36.610> I<00:03:36.760> look<00:03:37.090> at<00:03:37.390> this<00:03:37.959> size<00:03:38.230> this

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
important so if I look at this size this

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.090 
important so if I look at this size this
happens<00:03:38.920> to<00:03:39.040> be<00:03:39.070> a<00:03:39.190> size<00:03:39.519> 10<00:03:40.000> for<00:03:40.360> this<00:03:40.510> top<00:03:41.100> the

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.100 
happens to be a size 10 for this top the

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.880 
happens to be a size 10 for this top the
body<00:03:42.340> measurement<00:03:43.000> for<00:03:43.209> size<00:03:43.510> 10<00:03:43.840> is<00:03:44.049> 32<00:03:44.680> and<00:03:44.860> a

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:44.890 
body measurement for size 10 is 32 and a

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:47.069 
body measurement for size 10 is 32 and a
half<00:03:45.130> and<00:03:45.459> you<00:03:45.489> can<00:03:45.940> see<00:03:46.180> the<00:03:46.600> finished

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:47.079 
half and you can see the finished

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:50.310 
half and you can see the finished
measurement<00:03:47.739> of<00:03:47.890> the<00:03:48.340> bustline<00:03:48.700> is<00:03:49.150> 37<00:03:50.019> and<00:03:50.170> a

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:50.320 
measurement of the bustline is 37 and a

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.259 
measurement of the bustline is 37 and a
half<00:03:50.350> so<00:03:51.220> that's<00:03:51.340> telling<00:03:51.610> you<00:03:51.850> that<00:03:52.120> you're

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:52.269 
half so that's telling you that you're

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:55.319 
half so that's telling you that you're
getting<00:03:52.540> a<00:03:52.900> 5<00:03:53.320> inch<00:03:53.880> increase<00:03:54.880> in<00:03:55.180> the

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:55.329 
getting a 5 inch increase in the

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:58.890 
getting a 5 inch increase in the
measurement<00:03:55.780> in<00:03:55.930> the<00:03:56.079> bustline<00:03:57.480> by<00:03:58.480> looking

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
measurement in the bustline by looking

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.780 
measurement in the bustline by looking
at<00:03:59.079> the<00:03:59.260> finished<00:03:59.620> garment<00:03:59.860> measurements<00:04:00.549> we

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:00.790 
at the finished garment measurements we

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:02.100 
at the finished garment measurements we
can<00:04:00.940> actually<00:04:01.090> get<00:04:01.329> an<00:04:01.450> idea<00:04:01.570> on<00:04:01.870> how

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:02.110 
can actually get an idea on how

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:03.960 
can actually get an idea on how
something<00:04:02.350> is<00:04:02.590> going<00:04:02.769> to<00:04:02.980> fit<00:04:03.220> before<00:04:03.579> we've

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
something is going to fit before we've

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.509 
something is going to fit before we've
made<00:04:04.450> it<00:04:04.630> so<00:04:05.170> if<00:04:05.350> I'm<00:04:05.530> looking<00:04:05.680> at<00:04:05.980> a<00:04:06.040> top<00:04:06.310> and

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:06.519 
made it so if I'm looking at a top and

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:08.819 
made it so if I'm looking at a top and
for<00:04:06.790> my<00:04:07.000> size<00:04:07.299> it<00:04:07.720> says<00:04:07.930> the<00:04:08.110> bustline<00:04:08.440> is

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:08.829 
for my size it says the bustline is

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:11.130 
for my size it says the bustline is
going<00:04:09.130> to<00:04:09.280> end<00:04:09.459> up<00:04:09.670> being<00:04:09.910> 37<00:04:10.570> and<00:04:10.900> a<00:04:10.959> half

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
going to end up being 37 and a half

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:12.539 
going to end up being 37 and a half
inches<00:04:11.650> finished

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:12.549 
inches finished

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:15.509 
inches finished
I<00:04:12.640> can<00:04:13.450> use<00:04:13.630> some<00:04:13.660> a<00:04:13.930> tape<00:04:14.170> measure<00:04:14.380> go<00:04:15.220> around

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:15.519 
I can use some a tape measure go around

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:17.099 
I can use some a tape measure go around
the<00:04:15.640> corresponding<00:04:16.390> area<00:04:16.690> which<00:04:16.870> in<00:04:17.019> this

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109 
the corresponding area which in this

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:20.449 
the corresponding area which in this
case<00:04:17.350> would<00:04:17.590> be<00:04:17.620> the<00:04:17.890> bustline<00:04:18.190> and<00:04:18.600> mark<00:04:19.600> off

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
case would be the bustline and mark off

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.880 
case would be the bustline and mark off
37<00:04:21.459> and<00:04:21.729> a<00:04:21.910> half<00:04:22.120> inches<00:04:22.750> so<00:04:23.290> this<00:04:23.500> is<00:04:23.680> going<00:04:23.830> to

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:23.890 
37 and a half inches so this is going to

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:26.760 
37 and a half inches so this is going to
show<00:04:24.100> me<00:04:24.130> or<00:04:24.610> give<00:04:24.790> me<00:04:24.820> an<00:04:25.030> idea<00:04:25.210> and<00:04:25.720> how<00:04:26.410> big

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:26.770 
show me or give me an idea and how big

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.790 
show me or give me an idea and how big
this<00:04:26.919> area<00:04:27.130> is<00:04:27.370> going<00:04:27.640> to<00:04:27.760> be<00:04:27.880> in<00:04:28.090> a<00:04:28.360> spot<00:04:28.690> so<00:04:28.990> in

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
this area is going to be in a spot so in

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.439 
this area is going to be in a spot so in
this<00:04:29.919> case<00:04:30.160> I<00:04:30.370> would<00:04:30.490> be<00:04:30.520> looking<00:04:30.910> at<00:04:31.090> a

00:04:31.439 --> 00:04:31.449 
this case I would be looking at a

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:33.299 
this case I would be looking at a
fitting<00:04:31.900> top<00:04:32.139> so<00:04:32.830> this<00:04:33.009> is<00:04:33.129> especially

00:04:33.299 --> 00:04:33.309 
fitting top so this is especially

00:04:33.309 --> 00:04:36.239 
fitting top so this is especially
helpful<00:04:33.789> if<00:04:34.300> you're<00:04:34.749> between<00:04:34.990> sizes<00:04:35.259> you<00:04:36.219> can

00:04:36.239 --> 00:04:36.249 
helpful if you're between sizes you can

00:04:36.249 --> 00:04:37.980 
helpful if you're between sizes you can
use<00:04:36.520> the<00:04:36.669> finish<00:04:36.909> measurements<00:04:37.389> to<00:04:37.479> decide<00:04:37.809> to

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
use the finish measurements to decide to

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.679 
use the finish measurements to decide to
go<00:04:38.110> with<00:04:38.259> one<00:04:38.469> size<00:04:38.680> or<00:04:39.039> the<00:04:39.219> other<00:04:39.370> or<00:04:39.759> if<00:04:40.479> you

00:04:40.679 --> 00:04:40.689 
go with one size or the other or if you

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:43.230 
go with one size or the other or if you
definitely<00:04:40.870> have<00:04:41.409> a<00:04:41.680> different<00:04:42.460> size<00:04:42.699> for<00:04:43.120> the

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
definitely have a different size for the

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:45.540 
definitely have a different size for the
bustline<00:04:43.539> than<00:04:44.110> you<00:04:44.229> do<00:04:44.469> for<00:04:44.800> the<00:04:45.039> waistline

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:45.550 
bustline than you do for the waistline

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:48.390 
bustline than you do for the waistline
so<00:04:46.360> you<00:04:46.419> can<00:04:46.659> decide<00:04:46.930> either<00:04:47.259> if<00:04:47.559> one<00:04:47.919> size<00:04:48.189> is

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
so you can decide either if one size is

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:50.429 
so you can decide either if one size is
going<00:04:48.580> to<00:04:48.699> work<00:04:49.150> or<00:04:49.389> if<00:04:49.449> you<00:04:50.050> need<00:04:50.199> to<00:04:50.319> make

00:04:50.429 --> 00:04:50.439 
going to work or if you need to make

00:04:50.439 --> 00:04:52.709 
going to work or if you need to make
further<00:04:50.770> pattern<00:04:51.370> alterations<00:04:52.089> these<00:04:52.569> are

00:04:52.709 --> 00:04:52.719 
further pattern alterations these are

00:04:52.719 --> 00:04:54.749 
further pattern alterations these are
all<00:04:52.900> good<00:04:53.169> things<00:04:53.199> to<00:04:53.529> consider<00:04:54.099> when<00:04:54.699> making
