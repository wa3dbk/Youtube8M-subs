here for a number of reasons but the

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.080 
here for a number of reasons but the
main<00:01:02.730> one<00:01:03.030> is<00:01:03.059> that<00:01:03.539> I<00:01:04.410> can<00:01:04.800> then<00:01:04.949> apply<00:01:05.489> this<00:01:05.820> C

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
so you want it to sound like that and

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.950 
so you want it to sound like that and
the<00:01:13.050> way<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.259> do<00:01:13.470> it<00:01:13.649> is<00:01:14.179> to<00:01:15.179> play<00:01:15.420> that<00:01:15.630> chord

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
the way to do it is to play that chord

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:30.850 
the way to do it is to play that chord
just<00:01:16.590> before<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:16.979> downbeat<00:01:26.390> one<00:01:27.409> two<00:01:28.640> one<00:01:29.640> two

just before the downbeat one two one two

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:38.990 
just before the downbeat one two one two
one<00:01:31.860> two<00:01:32.360> one<00:01:34.130> two<00:01:35.130> one<00:01:35.570> two<00:01:37.729> so<00:01:38.729> you're<00:01:38.850> going

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
one two one two one two so you're going

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.030 
one two one two one two so you're going
to<00:01:39.030> need<00:01:39.240> to<00:01:39.360> change<00:01:39.630> on<00:01:39.899> the<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.170> of<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.829> beat

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
to need to change on the and of the beat

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.100 
to need to change on the and of the beat
two<00:01:41.430> of<00:01:41.729> the<00:01:41.909> previous<00:01:42.299> beat<00:01:42.509> before<00:01:42.780> the

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
two of the previous beat before the

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.109 
two of the previous beat before the
chord<00:01:43.409> and<00:01:43.649> it's<00:01:44.399> going<00:01:44.490> to<00:01:44.549> sound<00:01:44.759> something

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
chord and it's going to sound something

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.299 
chord and it's going to sound something
like<00:01:45.149> this
