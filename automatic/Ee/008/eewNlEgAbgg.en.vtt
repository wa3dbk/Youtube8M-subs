00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 Dominik asks how does he think the how 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.450
 do you think about the current state of 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:10.139
 team and where do you see your role 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.519
 in the team yes I think my role in the team 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.120
 Of course, there is one of them 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.730
 He wants to be here and 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.750
 just for the young players too 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:22.500
 assume role model function 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.550
 and yes and she could stand up to date 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.830
 run a little better 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.619
 we have many points at home 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.640
 let down by our lack of 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.120
 chance recycling 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.920
 ok rico asks which player was for 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:41.460
 you the most unpleasant player so far 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:42.840
 a dll and for germany so in 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.129
 the ddr 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:51.690
 if we do not really have a spontaneous right now 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:55.230
 unpleasant opponent on in the nhl 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:58.170
 is probably an alexander 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:02.820
 body game combines everything Ovechkin 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:06.210
 with technology and speed and up 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.490
 international level I remember 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.340
 at my beginning of the 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.110
 national team there were michael mühl 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.220
 under the sweden one 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:19.060
 had incredible control and the 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.030
 one very hard 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.890
 something could follow in its own third 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.930
 it is conceivable that you can ask for it 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.700
 the end of his nhl career again 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.640
 wants to krefeld in play del 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.380
 yes it is definitely conceivable me 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.920
 my still a long time until mine 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.770
 contract in buffalo expires though 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.960
 that would definitely not exclude 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.970
 Andreas would ask you in yours 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:46.470
 Career if he does that 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.470
 Cell walls can turn back time 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.420
 no not not necessarily i think 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.110
 My career is very good so far 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.049
 ran 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:00.759
 the only thing I would like to have again 

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:03.459
 would be a second chance in the seventh game 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:05.130
 in stanley-cup-final that we against 

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:09.039
 lost boston 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:11.200
 Andreas asks what has been up to now 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:14.790
 better experience in ice hockey as a pro 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:18.400
 both as a young player and as a TV player 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:20.110
 The best experience so far was in 2003 the 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.750
 championship with with the penguin too 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:26.019
 if you win the last one in the end 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.670
 game of the season wins and with his 

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:30.430
 Colleagues with whom you spend a lot during the 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.630
 song by then makes the trophy in the 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.790
 that can be stretched sky is that a whole 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.190
 special feeling 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.340
 René asks who is an example or of 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:44.280
 who did you learn the most and on 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:49.840
 and as meant next to the ice 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:52.569
 I would say my parents have many 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:55.780
 to do my career they had to do me 

00:02:52.569 --> 00:02:58.739
 Driving every day for training and many 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:01.709
 to endure hours in the cold 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:05.980
 on the ice, of course 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:07.959
 my coach they started it 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.569
 taught to skate with the skate 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:11.859
 and then from each trainer 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:13.680
 I actually had it 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:15.760
 probably a bit taken and 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.680
 That's why everyone has their small share 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.030
 it 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.250
 iris wants to know how are you 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.109
 I've come to ice hockey at all 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.840
 to come because my sister has 

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:27.400
 made skating and there I was 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.510
 a bit on the ice and then 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.129
 I have a single game on TV 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:32.620
 I saw that to my parents 

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:37.500
 I would like to do and then I am 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:41.849
 came immediately after beetles and since then 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:48.669
 I was the one I have ice hockey 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:50.620
 feverishly beloved would you ask 

00:03:48.669 --> 00:03:52.359
 if you had a son and with the 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.819
 experiences that you have collected yourself 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:56.409
 this one today at a hockey club 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:04:00.579
 of yours 

00:03:56.409 --> 00:04:02.139
 yes of course but that would have been lying 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:06.069
 also put on my son 

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:09.879
 whether he wants to do it or not 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:11.699
 no child can force that into the now 

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:13.569
 but to step off the father's footsteps 

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:15.750
 if he wants to , I would like you 

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:19.150
 Of course we give all possibilities 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:21.039
 also to exercise the hockey sport me 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.139
 asked why did you want it? 

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:27.729
 to play for krefeld and why 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:31.780
 you have no money until the first part 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:33.460
 I only wanted to play for graphics because 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:35.229
 I am at home here handle is mine 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:38.110
 Herzensverein as I said I have 

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:40.919
 started with ice hockey and that's why 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:43.599
 It was actually the only one for me 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:45.800
 option 

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:51.310
 Of course I would also like money 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:51.310
 But for the penguins it already is 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:56.479
 the insurance sum is pretty heavy 

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:58.550
 for me and that's why 

00:04:56.479 --> 00:04:58.819
 I am very happy that I play here 

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.240
 can 

00:04:58.819 --> 00:05:04.699
 ok and last question from lukas eck is 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:07.039
 you with one of the kv players before 

00:05:04.699 --> 00:05:07.729
 or a kfz kv time friends 

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:10.550
 been 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:12.229
 yes I know some players already 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:14.659
 very long, for example, end 

00:05:12.229 --> 00:05:17.180
 martin schimanski with that I have 

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:21.080
 earlier in the summer times together 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:23.479
 trained and daniel pietta or one 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:26.780
 the ferry I already know from the 

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:28.430
 kfv offspring too and I am too 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:30.050
 every year in the training camp here 

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:31.870
 that's why the other players are me 

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:34.870
 not unknown either 

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:34.870
 Thank you very much
