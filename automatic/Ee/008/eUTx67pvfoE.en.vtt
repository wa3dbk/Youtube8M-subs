00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
start of the second wasn't expecting two

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:54.270 
start of the second wasn't expecting two
quick<00:02:52.180> goals<00:02:52.210> off<00:02:52.570> the<00:02:52.690> bat<00:02:52.900> you<00:02:53.530> know<00:02:53.560> being

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
quick goals off the bat you know being

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:55.560 
quick goals off the bat you know being
the<00:02:54.340> all-star<00:02:54.760> game<00:02:54.940> there's<00:02:55.180> not<00:02:55.300> a<00:02:55.330> lot<00:02:55.540> of

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
the all-star game there's not a lot of

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:58.380 
the all-star game there's not a lot of
defensive<00:02:56.530> strategy<00:02:57.070> or<00:02:57.340> even<00:02:57.640> defensive<00:02:58.120> try

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
defensive strategy or even defensive try

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.350 
defensive strategy or even defensive try
cuz<00:02:58.720> it's<00:02:58.870> kind<00:02:59.020> of<00:02:59.080> a<00:02:59.170> showcase<00:02:59.380> for<00:02:59.740> the<00:02:59.830> fans

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
cuz it's kind of a showcase for the fans

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.570 
cuz it's kind of a showcase for the fans
so<00:03:01.470> yeah<00:03:02.470> I<00:03:02.500> think<00:03:02.590> that<00:03:02.950> we<00:03:03.160> could<00:03:03.280> have<00:03:03.400> tried

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
so yeah I think that we could have tried

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:04.770 
so yeah I think that we could have tried
a<00:03:03.640> little<00:03:03.790> harder<00:03:03.940> when<00:03:04.270> we<00:03:04.360> were<00:03:04.450> out<00:03:04.570> there

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
a little harder when we were out there

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.810 
a little harder when we were out there
and<00:03:05.080> you<00:03:05.980> know<00:03:06.070> we<00:03:06.130> didn't<00:03:06.340> expect<00:03:06.550> the<00:03:06.670> first

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
and you know we didn't expect the first

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.310 
and you know we didn't expect the first
one<00:03:07.090> then<00:03:07.300> we<00:03:07.360> certainly<00:03:07.690> didn't<00:03:07.930> expect<00:03:08.020> the

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320 
one then we certainly didn't expect the

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.960 
one then we certainly didn't expect the
second<00:03:08.680> one<00:03:08.770> right<00:03:08.800> off<00:03:08.950> the<00:03:09.160> faceoff<00:03:09.610> and

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
second one right off the faceoff and

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.480 
second one right off the faceoff and
sure<00:03:10.870> enough<00:03:10.900> I<00:03:11.230> was<00:03:11.350> back<00:03:11.560> to<00:03:11.709> even<00:03:12.070> at<00:03:12.280> the

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:12.490 
sure enough I was back to even at the

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:14.460 
sure enough I was back to even at the
start<00:03:12.730> of<00:03:12.790> second<00:03:13.209> and<00:03:13.390> then<00:03:13.510> it's<00:03:14.110> Gordon
