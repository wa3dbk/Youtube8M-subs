00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:48.840 
starts up putting this all together got
our<00:01:47.590> honeydew<00:01:47.860> or<00:01:48.190> cantaloupe<00:01:48.640> and<00:01:48.730> our

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
our honeydew or cantaloupe and our

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.210 
our honeydew or cantaloupe and our
watermelon<00:01:49.150> got<00:01:49.870> approximately<00:01:50.260> about<00:01:50.830> a<00:01:50.950> cup

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.220 
watermelon got approximately about a cup

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.370 
watermelon got approximately about a cup
and<00:01:51.280> a<00:01:51.370> half<00:01:51.400> of<00:01:51.670> each<00:01:51.850> okay<00:01:52.330> so<00:01:52.930> we're<00:01:53.260> gonna

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
and a half of each okay so we're gonna

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.130 
and a half of each okay so we're gonna
layer<00:01:53.710> it<00:01:53.740> or<00:01:54.100> we<00:01:54.250> not<00:01:54.460> mix<00:01:54.760> it<00:01:54.910> all<00:01:55.030> in<00:01:55.140> well

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
layer it or we not mix it all in well

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.410 
layer it or we not mix it all in well
I've<00:01:56.590> done<00:01:56.920> it<00:01:57.070> both<00:01:57.250> ways<00:01:57.520> actually<00:01:57.880> and<00:01:58.330> I

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
I've done it both ways actually and I

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.480 
I've done it both ways actually and I
find<00:01:58.900> that<00:01:59.140> it's<00:01:59.770> more<00:02:00.040> visually<00:02:00.460> appealing

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
find that it's more visually appealing

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.400 
find that it's more visually appealing
to<00:02:01.120> actually<00:02:01.450> have<00:02:01.600> three<00:02:01.810> different<00:02:02.080> bands

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:02.410 
to actually have three different bands

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:03.810 
to actually have three different bands
three<00:02:02.740> different<00:02:03.010> layers<00:02:03.190> show<00:02:03.430> you<00:02:03.550> the<00:02:03.640> same

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
three different layers show you the same

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.690 
three different layers show you the same
flavor<00:02:04.150> so<00:02:04.510> sure<00:02:04.930> certainly<00:02:05.710> so<00:02:06.370> what's<00:02:06.550> uh

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
flavor so sure certainly so what's uh

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.419

that's it okay if I can looks good it's
pretty<00:02:56.690> sharp<00:02:57.220> then<00:02:58.220> all<00:02:58.400> we<00:02:58.430> do<00:02:58.700> is<00:02:58.730> add<00:02:59.120> one

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
pretty sharp then all we do is add one

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.500 
pretty sharp then all we do is add one
liter<00:02:59.660> of<00:02:59.750> vodka<00:03:00.550> chill<00:03:01.550> it<00:03:01.670> for<00:03:01.700> two<00:03:02.270> days

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
liter of vodka chill it for two days

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.380 
liter of vodka chill it for two days
minimum<00:03:03.220> but<00:03:04.220> this<00:03:04.460> will<00:03:04.700> get<00:03:04.880> better<00:03:05.060> with

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
minimum but this will get better with

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.900 
minimum but this will get better with
time<00:03:05.650> longer<00:03:06.650> you<00:03:06.740> infuse<00:03:07.160> it<00:03:07.310> the<00:03:07.430> longer<00:03:07.790> its

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
time longer you infuse it the longer its

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:09.850 
time longer you infuse it the longer its
chilled<00:03:08.240> in<00:03:08.420> a<00:03:08.480> cooler<00:03:08.720> the<00:03:09.410> better<00:03:09.680> it<00:03:09.800> will

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 
chilled in a cooler the better it will

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.520 
chilled in a cooler the better it will
become<00:03:10.220> the<00:03:11.000> strong<00:03:11.420> taste<00:03:11.900> of<00:03:12.020> the<00:03:12.080> block<00:03:12.290> it

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:12.530 
become the strong taste of the block it

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.250 
become the strong taste of the block it
will<00:03:12.710> basically<00:03:13.520> be<00:03:13.850> gone<00:03:14.300> after<00:03:14.570> about<00:03:14.930> two

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
will basically be gone after about two

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:17.560 
will basically be gone after about two
and<00:03:15.380> a<00:03:15.440> half<00:03:15.470> to<00:03:15.680> three<00:03:15.710> weeks<00:03:16.180> so<00:03:17.180> that's<00:03:17.390> it

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:17.570 
and a half to three weeks so that's it

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:19.840 
and a half to three weeks so that's it
now<00:03:18.140> does<00:03:18.350> that<00:03:18.380> yeah<00:03:18.770> the<00:03:19.100> fruit<00:03:19.310> can't<00:03:19.520> brown

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
now does that yeah the fruit can't brown

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:21.910 
now does that yeah the fruit can't brown
since<00:03:20.300> the<00:03:20.540> it<00:03:20.780> covered<00:03:21.110> the<00:03:21.260> vodka<00:03:21.590> covered

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
since the it covered the vodka covered

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:23.590 
since the it covered the vodka covered
all<00:03:22.070> the<00:03:22.280> fruit<00:03:22.490> is<00:03:22.610> that<00:03:22.730> correct<00:03:23.000> you're

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:32.210 
52 acts like a preservative so it'll

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:34.780 
52 acts like a preservative so it'll
keep<00:03:32.390> it<00:03:32.600> much<00:03:33.380> much<00:03:33.830> the<00:03:34.040> color<00:03:34.250> and<00:03:34.490> it<00:03:34.610> has

keep it much much the color and it has

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.900 
keep it much much the color and it has
right<00:03:35.060> here<00:03:35.330> certain<00:03:36.230> fruits<00:03:36.470> do<00:03:36.740> brown<00:03:37.130> even
