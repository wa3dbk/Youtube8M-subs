00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.840 

so<00:00:00.870> far<00:00:01.140> we<00:00:01.410> have<00:00:01.530> discussed<00:00:01.680> how<00:00:02.399> to<00:00:02.460> generate

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850 
so far we have discussed how to generate

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.360 
so far we have discussed how to generate
sound<00:00:03.179> in<00:00:03.510> the<00:00:03.659> timber<00:00:03.990> section<00:00:04.350> as<00:00:04.500> well<00:00:05.190> as

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
sound in the timber section as well as

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.099 
sound in the timber section as well as
to<00:00:05.549> treat<00:00:05.790> those<00:00:06.000> sounds<00:00:06.390> using<00:00:06.870> the

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
to treat those sounds using the

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.440 
to treat those sounds using the
parameters<00:00:07.560> available<00:00:08.130> to<00:00:08.250> you<00:00:08.370> also<00:00:08.760> in<00:00:09.300> the

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
parameters available to you also in the

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.140 
parameters available to you also in the
timber<00:00:09.750> section<00:00:10.160> we<00:00:11.160> have<00:00:11.309> also<00:00:11.610> had<00:00:11.910> a<00:00:11.940> look

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
timber section we have also had a look

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.999 
timber section we have also had a look
at<00:00:12.450> some<00:00:12.690> of<00:00:12.780> the<00:00:12.870> intensive<00:00:13.410> filtering

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
at some of the intensive filtering

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.880 
at some of the intensive filtering
options<00:00:14.460> and<00:00:14.670> harmless<00:00:15.089> and<00:00:15.870> in<00:00:16.320> this<00:00:16.560> video

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
options and harmless and in this video

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.340 
options and harmless and in this video
we<00:00:17.460> are<00:00:17.520> going<00:00:17.760> to<00:00:17.850> look<00:00:18.000> at<00:00:18.210> using<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:18.869> unity

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
we are going to look at using the unity

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.939 
we are going to look at using the unity
module<00:00:19.590> to<00:00:20.070> add<00:00:20.220> some<00:00:20.550> bodies<00:00:20.939> to<00:00:21.270> your<00:00:21.449> sound

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:21.949 
module to add some bodies to your sound

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:24.590 
module to add some bodies to your sound
for<00:00:22.949> those<00:00:23.130> that<00:00:23.340> do<00:00:23.460> not<00:00:23.490> know<00:00:23.670> what<00:00:24.119> unison

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
for those that do not know what unison

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.099 
for those that do not know what unison
is<00:00:24.840> or<00:00:25.140> does<00:00:25.970> unison<00:00:26.970> is<00:00:27.119> generally<00:00:27.599> used<00:00:27.869> to

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
is or does unison is generally used to

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.919 
is or does unison is generally used to
add<00:00:28.260> thickness<00:00:28.859> or<00:00:29.010> body<00:00:29.429> to<00:00:30.029> your<00:00:30.150> sound<00:00:30.449> by

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
add thickness or body to your sound by

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.290 
add thickness or body to your sound by
splitting<00:00:31.410> it<00:00:31.590> and<00:00:31.769> then<00:00:32.070> applying<00:00:32.579> a<00:00:32.790> slight

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
splitting it and then applying a slight

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.840 
splitting it and then applying a slight
detuning<00:00:33.930> to<00:00:34.410> one<00:00:34.559> or<00:00:34.770> more<00:00:35.160> of<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.579> split

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
detuning to one or more of the split

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.350 
detuning to one or more of the split
sources<00:00:36.360> before<00:00:36.930> being<00:00:37.350> mixed<00:00:37.590> back<00:00:37.890> together

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:38.360 
sources before being mixed back together

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.600 
sources before being mixed back together
this<00:00:39.360> process<00:00:39.989> of<00:00:40.110> detuning<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.950> audio<00:00:41.340> is

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
this process of detuning the audio is

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.490 
this process of detuning the audio is
what<00:00:42.090> results<00:00:42.600> in<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.930> appearance<00:00:43.320> of

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
what results in the appearance of

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.979 
what results in the appearance of
multiple<00:00:44.129> sources<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:45.300> increased<00:00:45.629> body

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
multiple sources and the increased body

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.950 
multiple sources and the increased body
to<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.590> sound<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.329> unison<00:00:48.329> module<00:00:48.780> in

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
to the sound the unison module in

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.439 
to the sound the unison module in
harmless<00:00:49.440> is<00:00:49.649> activated<00:00:50.520> by<00:00:50.760> telling<00:00:51.180> it<00:00:51.300> how

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
harmless is activated by telling it how

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.240 
harmless is activated by telling it how
many<00:00:51.719> voices<00:00:52.110> you<00:00:52.440> want<00:00:52.649> to<00:00:52.800> sound<00:00:53.039> to<00:00:53.160> be

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
many voices you want to sound to be

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.119 
many voices you want to sound to be
split<00:00:53.550> into<00:00:53.899> which<00:00:54.899> is<00:00:55.079> set<00:00:55.289> by<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.680> order

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
split into which is set by the order

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.750 
split into which is set by the order
parameter<00:00:56.370> up<00:00:57.300> to<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:57.570> maximum<00:00:58.109> of<00:00:58.230> nine<00:00:58.649> voices

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:01.760 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.460 

obviously<00:01:02.760> here<00:01:03.149> the<00:01:03.270> more<00:01:03.690> voices<00:01:03.870> you<00:01:04.229> have

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
obviously here the more voices you have

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.219 
obviously here the more voices you have
the<00:01:04.860> thicker<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.369> sound<00:01:05.610> will<00:01:05.790> be<00:01:06.049> but<00:01:07.049> for

the thicker the sound will be but for

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.500 
the thicker the sound will be but for
some<00:01:07.439> sounds<00:01:07.950> only<00:01:08.369> a<00:01:08.400> few<00:01:08.670> voices<00:01:08.939> will<00:01:09.479> be

some sounds only a few voices will be

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:15.350 
some sounds only a few voices will be
needed<00:01:13.250> you<00:01:14.250> can<00:01:14.400> hear<00:01:14.640> a<00:01:14.670> difference<00:01:15.119> as<00:01:15.299> soon

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
needed you can hear a difference as soon

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.870 
needed you can hear a difference as soon
as<00:01:15.930> I<00:01:16.110> activated<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.799> unison<00:01:17.280> module<00:01:17.700> and

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
as I activated the unison module and

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.550 
as I activated the unison module and
added<00:01:18.299> a<00:01:18.390> few<00:01:18.570> voices<00:01:19.110> I<00:01:20.840> should<00:01:21.840> add<00:01:22.080> that<00:01:22.110> the

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
added a few voices I should add that the

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.010 
added a few voices I should add that the
more<00:01:22.770> voices<00:01:23.040> you<00:01:23.430> use<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:24.299> more<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.659> hit<00:01:24.869> of

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
more voices you use the more the hit of

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.920 
more voices you use the more the hit of
your<00:01:25.110> CPU<00:01:25.710> will<00:01:25.920> be<00:01:26.150> which<00:01:27.150> should<00:01:27.479> not<00:01:27.689> be<00:01:27.900> a
