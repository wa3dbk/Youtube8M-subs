believe they should all be the same
across<00:00:28.289> all<00:00:28.529> regions<00:00:32.870> so<00:00:33.870> what<00:00:34.170> I'm<00:00:34.260> gonna<00:00:34.350> do

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
across all regions so what I'm gonna do

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.139 
across all regions so what I'm gonna do
is<00:00:34.649> I'm<00:00:34.770> going<00:00:34.860> to<00:00:34.920> take<00:00:35.130> this<00:00:35.340> dry<00:00:35.700> but<00:00:35.910> it's<00:00:36.059> a

is I'm going to take this dry but it's a

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.470 
is I'm going to take this dry but it's a
little<00:00:36.360> different<00:00:36.690> than<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.460> then<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.579> CEC

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480

hg1 that I've got here
you<00:00:42.570> cannot<00:00:42.960> just<00:00:43.410> lift<00:00:43.829> this<00:00:44.129> thing<00:00:44.190> out<00:00:44.610> and

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
you cannot just lift this thing out and

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.130 
you cannot just lift this thing out and
just<00:00:45.149> pull<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.480> data<00:00:45.629> cable<00:00:46.110> out<00:00:46.170> because<00:00:48.140> the

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
just pull the data cable out because the

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.779 
just pull the data cable out because the
data<00:00:49.350> came<00:00:49.680> to<00:00:49.800> us<00:00:50.010> underneath<00:00:50.399> the<00:00:50.610> power

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
data came to us underneath the power

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:56.299 
data came to us underneath the power
supply<00:00:51.300> so<00:00:51.890> you<00:00:54.710> have<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:55.829> take<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:56.070> power

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
supply so you have to take the power

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.599 
supply so you have to take the power
supply<00:00:56.640> out<00:00:57.649> start<00:00:58.649> by<00:00:58.800> taking<00:00:59.129> this<00:00:59.370> little

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
supply out start by taking this little

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:05.200 
supply out start by taking this little
cable<00:01:00.000> off<00:01:00.359> and<00:01:02.480> taking<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.570> cable<00:01:03.960> for<00:01:04.170> the

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
cable off and taking the cable for the

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:11.960 
cable off and taking the cable for the
AC<00:01:06.210> power<00:01:06.600> off<00:01:09.290> that's<00:01:10.290> that<00:01:10.729> you<00:01:11.729> don't<00:01:11.850> need

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
AC power off that's that you don't need

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.609 
AC power off that's that you don't need
to<00:01:12.090> worry<00:01:12.270> about<00:01:12.330> this<00:01:12.689> ground<00:01:12.960> here<00:01:13.260> that<00:01:13.320> can

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
to worry about this ground here that can

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.450 
to worry about this ground here that can
stay<00:01:13.890> on<00:01:15.380> now<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.439> main<00:01:16.650> thing<00:01:16.979> here<00:01:17.430> is

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
stay on now the main thing here is

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.310 
stay on now the main thing here is
you've<00:01:17.820> got<00:01:19.759> two<00:01:20.759> different<00:01:20.970> types<00:01:21.299> of<00:01:21.810> screws

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
and then you got two different links

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.530 
and then you got two different links
you've<00:01:28.590> got<00:01:28.770> these<00:01:28.979> regular<00:01:29.520> screws<00:01:29.939> that<00:01:30.329> are

but the screw here and the screw over
here<00:02:18.280> are<00:02:19.280> longer<00:02:20.270> than<00:02:20.690> this<00:02:20.960> screw<00:02:21.500> down

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
here are longer than this screw down

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:24.700 
here are longer than this screw down
here<00:02:22.250> that's<00:02:22.460> right<00:02:23.090> on<00:02:23.240> the<00:02:23.330> metal<00:02:23.720> so<00:02:24.680> you

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:24.710 
here that's right on the metal so you

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:28.210 
here that's right on the metal so you
need<00:02:24.920> to<00:02:25.040> take<00:02:25.220> this<00:02:25.820> one<00:02:26.170> these<00:02:27.170> two<00:02:27.680> screws

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
need to take this one these two screws

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.020 
need to take this one these two screws
and<00:02:29.680> these<00:02:30.680> two<00:02:30.950> screws<00:02:31.310> out<00:02:31.490> to<00:02:31.760> get<00:02:31.910> the

in the center you kind of want to be

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:28.000 
in the center you kind of want to be
careful<00:07:25.610> because<00:07:25.760> if<00:07:26.720> you<00:07:27.170> don't<00:07:27.410> do<00:07:27.650> it<00:07:27.770> right

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:28.010 
careful because if you don't do it right

00:07:28.010 --> 00:07:32.080 
careful because if you don't do it right
there<00:07:28.310> are<00:07:29.950> here<00:07:30.950> on<00:07:31.130> this<00:07:31.370> side<00:07:31.610> on<00:07:31.880> the<00:07:32.060> left

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:32.090 
there are here on this side on the left

00:07:32.090 --> 00:07:36.070 
there are here on this side on the left
side<00:07:32.710> there<00:07:33.710> are<00:07:33.740> these<00:07:33.950> two<00:07:34.310> gears<00:07:35.080> that

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:36.080 
side there are these two gears that

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:39.760 
side there are these two gears that
actually<00:07:36.800> draw<00:07:37.040> the<00:07:37.100> disc<00:07:37.430> in<00:07:38.140> if<00:07:39.140> you're<00:07:39.620> not

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:39.770 
actually draw the disc in if you're not

00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:42.100 
actually draw the disc in if you're not
careful<00:07:40.070> with<00:07:40.490> this<00:07:40.700> you<00:07:41.510> could<00:07:41.660> pop<00:07:41.870> these

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:42.110 
careful with this you could pop these

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:48.340 
careful with this you could pop these
out<00:07:43.150> so<00:07:45.040> in<00:07:46.180> fact<00:07:47.180> that's<00:07:47.390> why<00:07:47.780> I'm<00:07:47.900> doing<00:07:48.230> this

00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:48.350 
out so in fact that's why I'm doing this

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:51.700 
out so in fact that's why I'm doing this
video<00:07:48.740> is<00:07:49.160> because<00:07:49.810> somebody's<00:07:50.810> out<00:07:51.020> there<00:07:51.050> he

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:51.710 
video is because somebody's out there he
