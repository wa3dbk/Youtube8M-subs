drum samples on independent drum racks
my<00:00:14.730> question<00:00:15.179> is<00:00:15.389> how<00:00:16.020> do<00:00:16.080> i<00:00:16.379> trigger<00:00:17.130> the

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
my question is how do i trigger the

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.220 
my question is how do i trigger the
samples<00:00:17.910> as<00:00:18.029> if<00:00:18.180> they're<00:00:18.330> on<00:00:18.449> the<00:00:18.480> same<00:00:18.630> drum

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
samples as if they're on the same drum

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.400 
samples as if they're on the same drum
rack<00:00:19.500> and<00:00:19.800> also<00:00:20.640> record<00:00:21.060> them<00:00:21.410> independently

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
rack and also record them independently

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.830 
rack and also record them independently
so<00:00:22.890> first<00:00:23.100> let<00:00:23.279> me<00:00:23.310> just<00:00:23.400> kind<00:00:23.699> of<00:00:23.820> give<00:00:24.689> an

as far as we're recording the drum

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
samples on independent tracks now when

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.549 
samples on independent tracks now when
you<00:00:36.329> go<00:00:36.450> to<00:00:36.480> make<00:00:36.660> your<00:00:36.809> drum<00:00:36.989> tracks<00:00:37.230> you<00:00:37.410> may

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
you go to make your drum tracks you may

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.440 
you go to make your drum tracks you may
just<00:00:37.800> throw<00:00:37.980> all<00:00:38.190> of<00:00:38.219> your<00:00:38.489> drum<00:00:38.730> samples<00:00:39.210> into

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
just throw all of your drum samples into

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.170 
just throw all of your drum samples into
a<00:00:40.050> single<00:00:40.440> drum<00:00:40.649> rack<00:00:40.890> and<00:00:41.250> go<00:00:41.460> from<00:00:41.670> there<00:00:41.910> now

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
a single drum rack and go from there now

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.490 
a single drum rack and go from there now
the<00:00:42.239> reason<00:00:42.570> why<00:00:42.660> I<00:00:42.690> like<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:43.020> separate<00:00:43.379> them

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
the reason why I like to separate them

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.040 
the reason why I like to separate them
ahead<00:00:43.620> of<00:00:43.890> time<00:00:44.070> is<00:00:44.399> for<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:45.510> mixing<00:00:45.899> process

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
ahead of time is for the mixing process

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.720 
ahead of time is for the mixing process
that<00:00:46.739> way<00:00:46.890> if<00:00:47.010> I<00:00:47.100> want<00:00:47.219> to<00:00:47.340> put<00:00:47.460> certain

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
that way if I want to put certain

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.010 
that way if I want to put certain
effects<00:00:48.000> on<00:00:48.149> my<00:00:48.239> snare<00:00:48.510> I<00:00:48.539> want<00:00:48.809> to<00:00:48.870> put

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
effects on my snare I want to put

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.770 
effects on my snare I want to put
certain<00:00:49.640> panning<00:00:50.640> or<00:00:50.760> delay<00:00:51.090> I<00:00:51.120> want<00:00:51.510> to<00:00:51.600> do

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
certain panning or delay I want to do

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.840 
certain panning or delay I want to do
certain<00:00:52.260> things<00:00:52.289> to<00:00:52.800> certain<00:00:53.280> samples<00:00:53.789> I

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
certain things to certain samples I

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.299 
certain things to certain samples I
already<00:00:54.120> have<00:00:54.300> them<00:00:54.800> separated<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:56.039> then

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
already have them separated and then

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.400 
already have them separated and then

just gives me a lot more flexibility
when<00:01:06.630> I<00:01:06.659> go<00:01:06.840> from<00:01:07.020> a<00:01:07.080> mixing<00:01:07.500> it<00:01:07.590> doesn't

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.910 
snare and drag it into the C sharp one
cell<00:01:35.340> so<00:01:36.299> now<00:01:36.420> I<00:01:36.450> just<00:01:36.540> armed<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:36.990> track<00:01:37.290> and<00:01:37.560> I

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
cell so now I just armed the track and I

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.560 
cell so now I just armed the track and I
can<00:01:38.130> trigger<00:01:38.400> both<00:01:38.610> of<00:01:38.790> these<00:01:38.909> samples<00:01:39.390> from

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
can trigger both of these samples from

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:47.630 
can trigger both of these samples from
my<00:01:39.720> MPD<00:01:40.079> 32<00:01:40.500> controller<00:01:46.100> so<00:01:47.100> in<00:01:47.220> order<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.490> go

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
my MPD 32 controller so in order to go

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.120 
my MPD 32 controller so in order to go
ahead<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:47.939> separate<00:01:48.329> these<00:01:48.680> these<00:01:49.680> samples

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
ahead and separate these these samples

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.560 
ahead and separate these these samples
and<00:01:50.310> two<00:01:50.369> independent<00:01:50.939> track<00:01:51.149> what<00:01:51.360> I'm<00:01:51.450> going

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
and two independent track what I'm going

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.899

drum rack so now if I click on kick
you're<00:02:04.920> going<00:02:04.950> to<00:02:05.130> see<00:02:05.250> that<00:02:05.369> the<00:02:05.610> kick<00:02:05.820> is<00:02:05.969> nt1

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
you're going to see that the kick is nt1

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.119 
you're going to see that the kick is nt1
and<00:02:06.719> I<00:02:06.840> click<00:02:07.020> on<00:02:07.049> snare<00:02:07.439> and<00:02:07.770> I've<00:02:07.829> got<00:02:08.009> my

separate<00:02:10.379> drum<00:02:10.590> rack<00:02:10.910> so<00:02:11.910> now<00:02:12.030> that<00:02:12.180> I<00:02:12.209> have<00:02:12.390> my

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
separate drum rack so now that I have my

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.869 
separate drum rack so now that I have my
drum<00:02:12.870> sample<00:02:13.260> separated<00:02:13.890> the<00:02:14.069> whole<00:02:14.220> idea<00:02:14.580> is

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:14.879 
drum sample separated the whole idea is

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:16.699 
drum sample separated the whole idea is
to<00:02:15.180> trigger<00:02:15.629> both<00:02:15.900> of<00:02:16.080> these<00:02:16.170> samples<00:02:16.590> at<00:02:16.650> the

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
to trigger both of these samples at the

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:18.890 
to trigger both of these samples at the
same<00:02:16.980> time<00:02:17.280> as<00:02:17.580> if<00:02:17.730> they're<00:02:17.910> on<00:02:18.120> a<00:02:18.150> single<00:02:18.629> drum

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
same time as if they're on a single drum

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.070 
same time as if they're on a single drum
rack<00:02:19.110> so<00:02:19.440> to<00:02:19.500> do<00:02:19.860> that<00:02:19.890> all<00:02:20.640> I<00:02:20.700> do<00:02:21.060> is<00:02:21.510> make<00:02:22.020> sure

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
rack so to do that all I do is make sure

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.100 
rack so to do that all I do is make sure
that<00:02:22.230> I<00:02:22.379> armed<00:02:22.709> both<00:02:23.340> of<00:02:23.610> these<00:02:24.540> drum<00:02:24.870> racks

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
that I armed both of these drum racks

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.020 
that I armed both of these drum racks
for<00:02:25.290> recording<00:02:25.770> you<00:02:26.489> can<00:02:26.520> do<00:02:26.700> that<00:02:26.879> by<00:02:27.000> a

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
for recording you can do that by a

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.259 
for recording you can do that by a
simple<00:02:27.420> control<00:02:27.840> click<00:02:28.819> so<00:02:29.819> now<00:02:29.970> I<00:02:30.000> can

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:30.269 
simple control click so now I can

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:34.100 
simple control click so now I can
trigger<00:02:30.540> my<00:02:30.840> MPD<00:02:31.170> 32<00:02:31.650> my<00:02:32.239> cc1<00:02:33.239> and<00:02:33.480> C<00:02:33.629> sharp<00:02:33.840> one

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
trigger my MPD 32 my cc1 and C sharp one

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.570 
trigger my MPD 32 my cc1 and C sharp one
trigger<00:02:34.650> both<00:02:34.830> of<00:02:35.010> those<00:02:35.069> samples<00:02:35.459> at<00:02:35.550> the

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
trigger both of those samples at the

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:49.430 
trigger both of those samples at the
same<00:02:35.790> time

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.140 

now<00:02:50.440> since<00:02:50.650> I<00:02:50.740> only<00:02:50.890> have<00:02:50.980> one<00:02:51.340> sample<00:02:51.700> per

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
now since I only have one sample per

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:53.970 
now since I only have one sample per
drum<00:02:52.510> rack<00:02:52.750> some<00:02:53.320> of<00:02:53.440> this<00:02:53.530> MIDI<00:02:53.770> information

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
drum rack some of this MIDI information

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.040 
drum rack some of this MIDI information
is<00:02:54.580> just<00:02:54.790> blank<00:02:55.030> many<00:02:55.330> information<00:02:55.930> it's<00:02:56.020> not

is just blank many information it's not

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.620 
is just blank many information it's not
actually<00:02:56.470> triggering<00:02:57.100> any<00:02:57.340> sample<00:02:57.940> one<00:02:58.510> of

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
actually triggering any sample one of

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:59.970 
actually triggering any sample one of
the<00:02:58.690> things<00:02:58.840> I<00:02:58.960> like<00:02:59.110> to<00:02:59.140> do<00:02:59.350> just<00:02:59.380> sort<00:02:59.770> of<00:02:59.830> as

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
the things I like to do just sort of as

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.850 
the things I like to do just sort of as
a<00:03:00.010> cleanup<00:03:00.400> process<00:03:01.330> is<00:03:01.570> just<00:03:02.110> delete<00:03:02.620> the

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
a cleanup process is just delete the

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.560 
a cleanup process is just delete the
blank<00:03:03.130> MIDI<00:03:03.490> information<00:03:03.670> that's<00:03:04.270> in<00:03:04.390> there

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:04.570 
blank MIDI information that's in there

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:06.960 
blank MIDI information that's in there
so<00:03:04.600> for<00:03:04.900> my<00:03:05.050> kick<00:03:05.320> I<00:03:05.530> would<00:03:05.770> basically<00:03:06.430> delete

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:06.970 
so for my kick I would basically delete

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:11.300 
so for my kick I would basically delete
the<00:03:07.540> the<00:03:07.870> blank<00:03:08.200> snare<00:03:09.130> MIDI<00:03:09.610> info<00:03:10.330> and<00:03:10.600> then

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
the the blank snare MIDI info and then

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.040 
the the blank snare MIDI info and then
the<00:03:12.310> same<00:03:12.580> for<00:03:13.000> the<00:03:13.120> snare<00:03:13.390> I<00:03:13.420> would<00:03:13.630> go<00:03:13.750> in<00:03:13.900> and

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:14.050 
the same for the snare I would go in and

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.380 
the same for the snare I would go in and
delete<00:03:14.200> the<00:03:14.650> kick<00:03:14.920> if<00:03:15.160> you<00:03:15.640> leave<00:03:15.880> it<00:03:16.030> in<00:03:16.180> it's

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
delete the kick if you leave it in it's

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:17.700 
delete the kick if you leave it in it's
not<00:03:16.570> going<00:03:16.840> to<00:03:16.900> make<00:03:17.050> a<00:03:17.080> difference<00:03:17.560> as<00:03:17.680> long

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:17.710 
not going to make a difference as long

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:19.710 
not going to make a difference as long
as<00:03:18.010> you're<00:03:18.130> not<00:03:18.190> loading<00:03:18.640> samples<00:03:19.180> in<00:03:19.330> those

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
as you're not loading samples in those

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.500 
as you're not loading samples in those
those<00:03:20.620> cells<00:03:20.950> it<00:03:21.490> just<00:03:21.820> kind<00:03:22.000> of<00:03:22.060> for<00:03:22.240> me<00:03:22.330> is<00:03:22.450> a

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
those cells it just kind of for me is a

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:23.550 
those cells it just kind of for me is a
cleanup<00:03:22.780> that<00:03:23.110> way<00:03:23.230> there's<00:03:23.410> no<00:03:23.470> confusion

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
cleanup that way there's no confusion

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.950 
cleanup that way there's no confusion
down<00:03:24.520> the<00:03:24.700> road<00:03:24.910> when<00:03:25.210> I'm<00:03:25.300> making<00:03:25.480> the<00:03:25.690> track

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:25.960 
down the road when I'm making the track

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:28.260 
down the road when I'm making the track
so<00:03:26.410> this<00:03:26.530> is<00:03:26.620> really<00:03:26.830> the<00:03:26.920> whole<00:03:27.040> idea<00:03:27.400> in<00:03:27.700> wait
