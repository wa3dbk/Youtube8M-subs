00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.590
 good debris of society 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.230
 welcome to a new video of the 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.690
 playlist tutorials this time it 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.630
 it's about how to make a draft down 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.760
 we're going to see it with search 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.199
 to have two options a manual our 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.199
 and another done with shown 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.110
 do not bens she is the first option 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.289
 manual 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:32.759
 for the menu-to-manual option 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.129
 I will teach you first the 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:39.579
 behavior and it's going to be that we're going to 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:42.039
 have a title here about 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:43.239
 a menu let's say and a content of the 

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:45.219
 page 

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:47.320
 let's say that here the behavior is 

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:49.299
 that when we pass over a 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:52.510
 option with drop-down menu is displayed 

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:54.190
 if we pass to another the previous one is hidden 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.600
 drag down and this is shown when 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.220
 We click anywhere in the 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:01.640
 page hides the menu 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:03.560
 as we have done this very easy we have 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.080
 put here the coding of the page 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:07.300
 to that 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:10.680
 here we have a main bed where 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:14.080
 we center the content with this width 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:17.920
 we have a few rows let's say that each 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:21.550
 line of the page is within 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.620
 this layer with the row class and let's say that 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:26.200
 here we modify the behavior of 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:30.090
 the listings and we tell you that the 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:33.890
 elements of them do not have 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:36.409
 style in the listing 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.950
 and have left float and 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:41.880
 set aside a little margin to the left 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:46.390
 we also give the option that if 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:49.100
 we have an option to list 

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:52.700
 class draft none 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:55.850
 the list that can be inside have 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:58.630
 an absolute position with the letter of 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:02.510
 white color and black background 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:07.340
 with opacity at 1 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:09.080
 and the options of these menus no longer 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:14.580
 we want you to have a float to the 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:17.450
 left and we remove the floating 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.450
 in agreement 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:24.170
 It's also worth doing in the listings 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:27.800
 in the listings in the lines we make the 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:31.120
 clear voice so that when the 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:34.160
 list of the flotation because it does not remain 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:37.160
 let's say the following line does not remain 

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:40.880
 above this, notice if I remove this 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:44.210
 option when I reload the page here 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:46.190
 content of the page I like it 

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:50.800
 and then we want this therefore 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:53.320
 we make clear voice in all 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:56.670
 in all the lines and we already have one 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:03:00.110
 below the other on each line 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:03.890
 it's worth separate here we have the content 

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:09.690
 let's say here we have the menu that in each 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:13.170
 option that has a submenu we put you 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:16.770
 in the draft-down class and listed with 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:18.540
 the options of it and if it does not have 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:20.970
 data so you do not need to put anything 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:24.390
 what is the yoga script here we put 

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:29.000
 same and you do not need to do it without 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:29.000
 64 but it makes life a lot easier 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:36.560
 here we put all the menu options 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:38.380
 the class assigned to the class 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.870
 drop down 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:44.230
 the mode designates this variable and then 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:46.510
 all the big devils the menus 

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:47.940
 we put them in this other 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:51.300
 variable 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:53.760
 or we count all the menus and we make 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:57.210
 in the options that have drive yet 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:04:00.890
 when you pass the mouse over all 

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:05.630
 the other data that may have 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:07.610
 visible and we show the current 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:09.920
 and when we click anywhere 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:12.920
 of the page because we hide all the 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:15.170
 drag down and this is the behavior and 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.060
 here to note that if there is content below 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:19.430
 of the mouse shows that a bit weird 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.190
 this is solved by putting an image 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:24.600
 background 

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:27.120
 with that, it would be solved 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.740
 let's see the option with yours with 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.380
 your weight a simpler 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:34.350
 we put the options to like the 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:38.610
 options were 500 of yours that are 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:42.540
 here in the stylesheet 

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:45.520
 you need i 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:48.930
 the scripts file like also 

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:52.320
 the meaning 

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:54.040
 here we work already we do not put styles 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:57.820
 of any kind 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:59.560
 and we use a ballet system with road 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:03.600
 let's say the columns that in this case 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:06.730
 as we only have one we put one and here 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:09.960
 now is to teach all this from the menu how 

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:13.270
 it works but let's see it first 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:15.190
 working here we have already see that with 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:19.800
 a fucking page comes out something 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:22.979
 fairly decent here we have the 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:27.590
 the title we have here the options of 

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:27.590
 menu a menu title and here a draft 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:32.600
 so 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:35.810
 how is this menu done? 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:37.910
 same we make a line and here we put 

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:40.840
 the nakba 

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:45.440
 with a container flow so that if 

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:49.470
 we make this smaller this suit 

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:53.910
 and here we have the collapse 

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:55.590
 here we do the collapse let's say this 

00:05:53.910 --> 00:06:01.130
 when the page becomes small and not 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:06:01.130
 fit the menu this is going to come out of here 

00:06:01.639 --> 00:06:04.210
 I have taught 

00:06:05.569 --> 00:06:09.110
 for this from here 

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:16.240
 and this and this we say that you have to 

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:19.630
 let's say you have to put 

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:22.750
 from here I had the collapse and the target 

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:25.860
 the idea of â€‹â€‹the menu that you want to show 

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:30.569
 when the collapse occurs 

00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:33.000
 and here we have the menu with the option 

00:06:30.569 --> 00:06:34.830
 1 option 2 and a mouse how it is done 

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.490
 more or less the same as what was done in 

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:38.219
 the other 

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:39.960
 we put an online class in the 

00:06:38.219 --> 00:06:42.600
 menu 

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:46.380
 we make this a link with the 

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:50.550
 google in track none and here we put another 

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:53.039
 List with class abdomen as 

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:55.860
 the other options that we want here 

00:06:53.039 --> 00:07:00.030
 even I have put a good divider 

00:06:55.860 --> 00:07:02.610
 two really good splitters easy as 

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:04.849
 well up here is everything I hope you 

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:04.849
 serve
