blemishes or the problem areas that you
had<00:05:37.020> then<00:05:38.020> I<00:05:38.349> found<00:05:39.070> that<00:05:39.310> the<00:05:39.550> first<00:05:39.700> time

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:39.910 
had then I found that the first time

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:43.980 
had then I found that the first time
using<00:05:40.120> this<00:05:40.270> it<00:05:40.450> would<00:05:40.599> drip<00:05:40.870> and<00:05:42.090> I<00:05:43.090> was<00:05:43.479> not

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:43.990 
using this it would drip and I was not

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:47.969 
using this it would drip and I was not
into<00:05:44.560> that<00:05:44.740> and<00:05:45.160> get<00:05:45.550> on<00:05:45.669> my<00:05:45.760> clothes<00:05:46.229> just<00:05:47.229> mmm

00:05:47.969 --> 00:05:47.979 
into that and get on my clothes just mmm

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:50.370 
into that and get on my clothes just mmm
I<00:05:48.160> found<00:05:48.700> a<00:05:48.789> solution<00:05:48.910> so<00:05:49.510> to<00:05:49.900> prevent<00:05:50.169> it<00:05:50.349> from

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:50.380 
I found a solution so to prevent it from

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:52.440 
I found a solution so to prevent it from
dripping<00:05:50.680> what<00:05:50.979> I<00:05:51.010> would<00:05:51.190> do<00:05:51.310> is<00:05:51.460> take<00:05:51.669> cotton

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:52.450 
dripping what I would do is take cotton

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:56.879 
dripping what I would do is take cotton
pads<00:05:52.690> and<00:05:53.400> I<00:05:54.400> would<00:05:54.789> tear<00:05:55.090> it<00:05:55.120> in<00:05:55.300> half<00:05:55.889> like

00:05:56.879 --> 00:05:56.889 
pads and I would tear it in half like

00:05:56.889 --> 00:05:58.710 
pads and I would tear it in half like
this<00:05:56.919> just<00:05:57.520> so<00:05:57.639> you<00:05:57.700> have<00:05:58.000> a<00:05:58.030> thin<00:05:58.419> cotton

00:05:58.710 --> 00:05:58.720 
this just so you have a thin cotton

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:03.540 
this just so you have a thin cotton
layer<00:05:59.050> and<00:05:59.380> place<00:06:00.130> it<00:06:00.430> on<00:06:00.610> my<00:06:01.180> face<00:06:02.020> um<00:06:02.520> where<00:06:03.520> I

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:03.550 
layer and place it on my face um where I

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:05.700 
layer and place it on my face um where I
have<00:06:03.849> applied<00:06:04.030> the<00:06:04.660> honey<00:06:04.810> so<00:06:05.110> if<00:06:05.260> it<00:06:05.590> can

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:05.710 
have applied the honey so if it can

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:07.080 
have applied the honey so if it can
prevent<00:06:05.919> it<00:06:06.099> from<00:06:06.130> sticking<00:06:06.400> you<00:06:06.729> would<00:06:06.880> soak

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:07.090 
prevent it from sticking you would soak

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:09.390 
prevent it from sticking you would soak
it<00:06:07.240> up<00:06:07.330> and<00:06:07.510> it<00:06:08.470> would<00:06:08.620> prevent<00:06:09.160> it<00:06:09.370> from

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:09.400 
it up and it would prevent it from

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.670 
it up and it would prevent it from
dropping<00:06:09.849> onto<00:06:10.419> your<00:06:10.690> clothes<00:06:10.990> and<00:06:11.470> it<00:06:11.590> was

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:11.680 
dropping onto your clothes and it was

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:14.159 
dropping onto your clothes and it was
just<00:06:11.919> a<00:06:12.160> perfect<00:06:12.880> solution<00:06:13.060> to<00:06:13.270> that<00:06:13.389> so<00:06:13.720> if

00:06:14.159 --> 00:06:14.169 
just a perfect solution to that so if

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:15.810 
just a perfect solution to that so if
you<00:06:14.260> don't<00:06:14.380> want<00:06:14.530> to<00:06:14.590> use<00:06:14.680> honey<00:06:14.950> because<00:06:15.669> it's

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:15.820 
you don't want to use honey because it's

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:17.969 
you don't want to use honey because it's
sticky<00:06:16.030> and<00:06:16.300> it<00:06:16.389> drips<00:06:16.780> everywhere<00:06:16.930> take<00:06:17.740> on
