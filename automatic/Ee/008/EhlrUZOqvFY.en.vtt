dexterity that's very similar to human

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.249 
dexterity that's very similar to human
we<00:01:53.400> went<00:01:53.580> to<00:01:53.670> r2<00:01:54.060> we<00:01:54.300> increase<00:01:54.690> that<00:01:54.930> we

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
we went to r2 we increase that we

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.370 
we went to r2 we increase that we
increase<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.950> speed<00:01:56.520> at<00:01:56.729> which<00:01:56.759> we<00:01:57.060> could

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
increase the speed at which we could

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.080 
increase the speed at which we could
perform<00:01:58.380> tasks<00:01:58.920> and<00:01:59.310> we<00:01:59.430> increase<00:01:59.670> the<00:01:59.700> level

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
perform tasks and we increase the level

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.880 
perform tasks and we increase the level
of<00:02:00.149> dexterity<00:02:00.360> so<00:02:01.080> that<00:02:01.229> we<00:02:01.320> can<00:02:01.470> even<00:02:01.649> perform

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
of dexterity so that we can even perform

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:07.600 
of dexterity so that we can even perform
more<00:02:02.310> tasks<00:02:02.820> than<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.300> original<00:02:03.660> or<00:02:03.750> one<00:02:04.020> can
