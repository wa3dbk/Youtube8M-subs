00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940 
three plug sockets if you like and you

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.630 
three plug sockets if you like and you
get<00:00:52.149> a<00:00:52.359> controller<00:00:53.050> now<00:00:53.590> taking<00:00:54.070> a<00:00:54.219> look<00:00:54.250> and

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:54.640 
get a controller now taking a look and

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:55.889 
get a controller now taking a look and
taking<00:00:54.969> these<00:00:55.030> things<00:00:55.270> out<00:00:55.449> of<00:00:55.480> the<00:00:55.570> box<00:00:55.780> you

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:55.899 
taking these things out of the box you

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:57.810 
taking these things out of the box you
can<00:00:56.020> see<00:00:56.170> that<00:00:56.379> the<00:00:56.500> build<00:00:57.129> quality<00:00:57.340> is<00:00:57.699> very

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:57.820 
can see that the build quality is very

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.189 
can see that the build quality is very
nice<00:00:58.149> that's<00:00:58.390> another<00:00:58.539> reason<00:00:58.840> why<00:00:58.960> I<00:00:58.989> like

00:00:59.189 --> 00:00:59.199 
nice that's another reason why I like

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:01.139 
nice that's another reason why I like
the<00:00:59.410> home<00:00:59.620> easy<00:00:59.920> sets<00:01:00.399> I<00:01:00.609> will<00:01:00.730> also<00:01:00.940> think<00:01:01.059> the

00:01:01.139 --> 00:01:01.149 
the home easy sets I will also think the

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:02.910 
the home easy sets I will also think the
home<00:01:01.510> easy<00:01:01.690> set<00:01:01.899> in<00:01:02.019> the<00:01:02.079> description<00:01:02.530> there

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
home easy set in the description there

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.619 
home easy set in the description there
is<00:01:03.010> cheaper<00:01:03.280> options<00:01:03.550> available<00:01:03.670> guys<00:01:04.119> but

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629 
is cheaper options available guys but

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:05.850 
is cheaper options available guys but
take<00:01:04.780> a<00:01:04.809> look<00:01:04.989> at<00:01:05.140> the<00:01:05.320> controller<00:01:05.679> you<00:01:05.770> can

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:05.860 
take a look at the controller you can

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.609 
take a look at the controller you can
see<00:01:06.070> that<00:01:06.220> we<00:01:06.310> have<00:01:06.490> about<00:01:07.479> 8<00:01:08.050> buttons<00:01:08.320> there

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:08.619 
see that we have about 8 buttons there

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:09.930 
see that we have about 8 buttons there
and<00:01:08.890> you<00:01:08.950> probably<00:01:09.070> think<00:01:09.250> at<00:01:09.369> 8<00:01:09.520> buttons<00:01:09.729> for

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:09.940 
and you probably think at 8 buttons for

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.270 
and you probably think at 8 buttons for
3<00:01:10.119> controllers<00:01:10.660> well<00:01:10.840> you've<00:01:11.619> got<00:01:11.740> three<00:01:12.039> two

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
3 controllers well you've got three two

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.580 
3 controllers well you've got three two
and<00:01:12.460> one<00:01:12.640> on<00:01:12.880> and<00:01:13.450> off<00:01:13.600> so<00:01:13.960> that<00:01:13.990> is<00:01:14.229> for<00:01:14.440> each

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.839 
plugged into the wall and you also have
a<00:01:19.869> ground<00:01:20.229> which<00:01:20.500> is<00:01:20.530> going<00:01:20.830> to<00:01:21.069> pretty<00:01:21.640> much

00:01:21.839 --> 00:01:21.849 
a ground which is going to pretty much

00:01:21.849 --> 00:01:23.460 
a ground which is going to pretty much
turn<00:01:22.090> everything<00:01:22.450> on<00:01:22.780> and<00:01:22.929> off<00:01:23.020> if<00:01:23.259> you<00:01:23.349> guys

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:23.470 
turn everything on and off if you guys

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:24.839 
turn everything on and off if you guys
didn't<00:01:23.740> already<00:01:23.830> guess<00:01:24.069> that<00:01:24.280> and<00:01:24.459> it's<00:01:24.729> just

00:01:24.839 --> 00:01:24.849 
didn't already guess that and it's just

00:01:24.849 --> 00:01:26.219 
didn't already guess that and it's just
powered<00:01:25.090> by<00:01:25.179> a<00:01:25.209> little<00:01:25.420> button<00:01:25.630> cell<00:01:25.810> battery

00:01:26.219 --> 00:01:26.229 
powered by a little button cell battery

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:27.930 
powered by a little button cell battery
now<00:01:26.679> as<00:01:26.800> you<00:01:26.860> can<00:01:26.920> see<00:01:27.009> the<00:01:27.190> build<00:01:27.399> quality<00:01:27.520> is

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:27.940 
now as you can see the build quality is

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:29.729 
now as you can see the build quality is
absolutely<00:01:28.179> phenomenal<00:01:28.660> on<00:01:29.170> these<00:01:29.349> units

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:29.739 
absolutely phenomenal on these units

00:01:29.739 --> 00:01:31.380 
absolutely phenomenal on these units
they<00:01:29.890> are<00:01:29.920> fully<00:01:30.369> plastic<00:01:30.849> but<00:01:31.090> it's<00:01:31.239> a<00:01:31.270> good

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
they are fully plastic but it's a good

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:32.940 
they are fully plastic but it's a good
plastic<00:01:31.599> it's<00:01:32.050> really<00:01:32.289> nice<00:01:32.410> you<00:01:32.440> could<00:01:32.739> drop

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
plastic it's really nice you could drop

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.410 
plastic it's really nice you could drop
it<00:01:33.160> on<00:01:33.280> concrete<00:01:33.759> and<00:01:33.880> it<00:01:33.940> wouldn't<00:01:34.149> crack

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
it on concrete and it wouldn't crack

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.449 
it on concrete and it wouldn't crack
