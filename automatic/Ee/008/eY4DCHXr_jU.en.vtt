00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
unusable this machine cuts holes inside

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.229 
unusable this machine cuts holes inside
the<00:02:43.680> fascinating<00:02:44.400> thing<00:02:44.580> is<00:02:44.610> it's<00:02:44.879> doing<00:02:45.120> it

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:45.239 
the fascinating thing is it's doing it

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:46.850 
the fascinating thing is it's doing it
in<00:02:45.360> a<00:02:45.450> mirrored<00:02:45.900> fashion

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
in a mirrored fashion

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.190 
in a mirrored fashion
it<00:02:47.730> looks<00:02:47.940> beautiful<00:02:48.660> like<00:02:48.780> it's<00:02:48.989> made<00:02:49.170> of

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
it looks beautiful like it's made of

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.910 
it looks beautiful like it's made of
some<00:02:49.950> sign<00:02:50.160> of<00:02:50.280> water<00:02:51.110> but<00:02:52.110> it's<00:02:52.260> not<00:02:52.500> it's

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
some sign of water but it's not it's

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.820 
some sign of water but it's not it's
solid<00:02:53.580> wooden<00:02:54.000> clog<00:02:54.510> material<00:02:55.349> and<00:02:55.620> here

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
solid wooden clog material and here

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.130 
solid wooden clog material and here
comes<00:02:56.040> with<00:02:56.190> others<00:02:56.580> to<00:02:56.790> make<00:02:56.819> Pringles<00:02:57.450> lock

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
comes with others to make Pringles lock

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.210 
comes with others to make Pringles lock
up<00:02:58.349> your<00:02:58.379> daughters<00:03:00.620> so<00:03:01.620> they<00:03:01.830> cut<00:03:02.099> the

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
up your daughters so they cut the

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.750 
up your daughters so they cut the
unnecessary<00:03:02.370> no<00:03:03.180> buff<00:03:03.420> at<00:03:03.630> this<00:03:03.810> point<00:03:04.760> may

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
unnecessary no buff at this point may

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.339 
unnecessary no buff at this point may
have<00:03:05.880> taken<00:03:06.060> a<00:03:06.269> little<00:03:06.420> too<00:03:06.690> much<00:03:06.900> off<00:03:07.110> there

00:03:07.339 --> 00:03:07.349 
have taken a little too much off there

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:11.420 
have taken a little too much off there
but<00:03:07.739> who's<00:03:08.340> gonna<00:03:08.519> notice<00:03:09.230> yes<00:03:10.260> it's<00:03:11.069> not<00:03:11.220> like

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
but who's gonna notice yes it's not like

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:13.270 
but who's gonna notice yes it's not like
you're<00:03:11.610> gonna<00:03:11.760> want<00:03:12.360> to<00:03:12.450> mmm

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
you're gonna want to mmm

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.740 
you're gonna want to mmm
then<00:03:14.280> do<00:03:14.430> the<00:03:14.580> same<00:03:14.730> again<00:03:15.090> on<00:03:15.239> the<00:03:15.390> other<00:03:15.510> one

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
then do the same again on the other one

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.990 
then do the same again on the other one
so<00:03:16.140> this<00:03:16.349> isn't<00:03:16.530> a<00:03:16.799> mirrored<00:03:17.099> process<00:03:17.670> and

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
so this isn't a mirrored process and

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.940 
so this isn't a mirrored process and
this<00:03:18.480> is<00:03:18.540> the<00:03:18.750> dangerous<00:03:19.230> bit<00:03:19.440> because<00:03:19.620> this

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
this is the dangerous bit because this

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.520 
this is the dangerous bit because this
is<00:03:20.130> where<00:03:20.310> the<00:03:20.430> shoes<00:03:20.670> could<00:03:21.660> become<00:03:21.840> very

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
is where the shoes could become very

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.319 
is where the shoes could become very
very<00:03:23.069> different<00:03:24.650> yes<00:03:25.650> if<00:03:26.010> you<00:03:26.610> messed<00:03:26.910> up<00:03:27.060> here

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:27.329 
very different yes if you messed up here

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:30.199 
very different yes if you messed up here
is<00:03:27.599> all<00:03:27.810> down<00:03:28.110> the<00:03:28.440> drain<00:03:28.470> really<00:03:29.130> exactly<00:03:30.000> no
