underneath<00:00:23.609> that<00:00:23.730> is<00:00:24.119> the<00:00:24.300> bouncing<00:00:24.840> options

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
underneath that is the bouncing options

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.009 
underneath that is the bouncing options
we<00:00:25.859> can<00:00:25.890> have<00:00:26.130> it<00:00:26.250> bounce<00:00:26.460> on<00:00:26.730> launch<00:00:27.180> or<00:00:27.449> on

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
we can have it bounce on launch or on

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.259 
we can have it bounce on launch or on
notification<00:00:28.949> and<00:00:29.099> then<00:00:29.490> you<00:00:29.609> can<00:00:29.789> change<00:00:29.820> the

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
notification and then you can change the

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.209 
notification and then you can change the
bouncing<00:00:30.720> interval<00:00:31.140> below<00:00:31.470> that<00:00:31.710> so<00:00:32.160> I'm

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
bouncing interval below that so I'm

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.400 
bouncing interval below that so I'm
going<00:00:32.340> to<00:00:32.369> go<00:00:32.460> ahead<00:00:32.579> here<00:00:32.969> and<00:00:33.180> turn<00:00:33.719> it<00:00:33.899> on<00:00:34.110> to

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
going to go ahead here and turn it on to

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.229 
going to go ahead here and turn it on to
every<00:00:34.770> launch<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:35.399> every<00:00:35.790> time<00:00:35.820> that<00:00:36.030> I

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
every launch and every time that I

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.660 
every launch and every time that I
launch<00:00:36.600> an<00:00:36.809> application<00:00:36.989> it<00:00:37.800> will<00:00:38.100> bounce<00:00:38.430> a

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:38.670 
launch an application it will bounce a

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.760 
launch an application it will bounce a
few<00:00:38.879> times<00:00:39.180> and<00:00:39.450> then<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:39.989> light<00:00:40.200> indicator

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
few times and then the light indicator

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.250 
few times and then the light indicator
will<00:00:41.100> pop<00:00:41.340> up<00:00:41.370> underneath<00:00:42.180> that<00:00:42.600> now<00:00:43.079> this

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
will pop up underneath that now this

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.049 
will pop up underneath that now this
will<00:00:43.379> notify<00:00:43.680> me<00:00:44.010> when<00:00:44.040> an<00:00:44.370> application<00:00:44.820> is

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
will notify me when an application is

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.729 
will notify me when an application is
being<00:00:45.239> launched<00:00:45.719> in<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:45.899> background<00:00:46.530> and

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
being launched in the background and

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.130 
being launched in the background and
applications<00:00:47.700> being<00:00:47.969> launched<00:00:48.480> or<00:00:48.629> their

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.590 
applications being launched or their
unread<00:00:49.590> messages<00:00:50.129> now<00:00:50.579> this<00:00:50.760> is<00:00:50.910> just<00:00:50.940> like<00:00:51.390> an

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
unread messages now this is just like an

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.750 
unread messages now this is just like an
OS<00:00:51.930> X<00:00:52.170> on<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.469> max<00:00:52.710> every<00:00:53.039> time<00:00:53.219> you<00:00:53.370> open<00:00:53.399> up

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
OS X on the max every time you open up

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.580 
OS X on the max every time you open up
an<00:00:53.910> application<00:00:54.030> it<00:00:54.690> will<00:00:54.750> bounce<00:00:55.230> a<00:00:55.440> little

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
an application it will bounce a little

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.380 
an application it will bounce a little
bit<00:00:55.890> and<00:00:56.070> then<00:00:56.399> if<00:00:56.520> you<00:00:56.610> quit<00:00:56.879> it<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.149> light

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
bit and then if you quit it the light

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.660 
bit and then if you quit it the light
indicator<00:00:57.930> will<00:00:58.230> go<00:00:58.440> away<00:00:58.590> so<00:00:59.340> here's<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.550> nice

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
indicator will go away so here's a nice

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.130 
indicator will go away so here's a nice
little<00:00:59.730> close-up<00:01:00.210> that<00:01:00.570> shows<00:01:00.750> you<00:01:00.960> the

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140

little close-up that shows you the
little<00:01:01.350> light<00:01:01.559> indicator<00:01:02.070> underneath<00:01:02.940> it<00:01:03.149> and

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
little light indicator underneath it and

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.750 
little light indicator underneath it and
this<00:01:03.719> works<00:01:03.960> with<00:01:04.170> ox<00:01:04.409> 0<00:01:04.589> as<00:01:04.739> well<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:05.309> if<00:01:05.640> I

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
this works with ox 0 as well and if I

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.460 
this works with ox 0 as well and if I
were<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:06.060> kill<00:01:06.299> all<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.689> apps<00:01:06.840> running<00:01:07.110> in<00:01:07.290> my

background you'll notice that all the
light<00:01:09.420> indicators<00:01:10.110> will<00:01:10.439> go<00:01:10.680> away<00:01:10.799> showing

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
light indicators will go away showing

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.580 
light indicators will go away showing
that<00:01:11.700> none<00:01:11.939> of<00:01:11.970> the<00:01:12.119> apps<00:01:12.270> are<00:01:12.570> running<00:01:13.080> now

that none of the apps are running now

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.499 
that none of the apps are running now
you<00:01:13.650> can<00:01:14.010> have<00:01:14.250> this<00:01:14.430> on<00:01:14.640> every<00:01:15.030> notification

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
you can have this on every notification

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.660 
you can have this on every notification
and<00:01:16.229> I'm<00:01:16.650> going<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:16.830> go<00:01:16.890> ahead<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:17.159> change<00:01:17.369> the

and I'm going to go ahead and change the
bounce<00:01:17.909> every<00:01:18.479> just<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.020> keep<00:01:19.170> it<00:01:19.320> constant

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
bounce every just to keep it constant

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.070 
bounce every just to keep it constant
for<00:01:20.009> this<00:01:20.100> video<00:01:20.460> tutorial<00:01:20.670> so<00:01:21.630> every<00:01:21.840> time

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
for this video tutorial so every time

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.490 
for this video tutorial so every time
that<00:01:22.259> I<00:01:22.320> would<00:01:22.650> open<00:01:23.369> up<00:01:23.490> a<00:01:24.259> application<00:01:25.259> now

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
that I would open up a application now

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.550 
that I would open up a application now
you'll<00:01:26.130> see<00:01:26.369> that<00:01:26.580> it<00:01:26.909> will<00:01:27.090> bounce<00:01:27.439> since<00:01:28.439> the

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
you'll see that it will bounce since the

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.560 
you'll see that it will bounce since the
notification<00:01:29.130> is<00:01:29.280> coming<00:01:29.670> in<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:30.030> if<00:01:30.329> I<00:01:30.420> go

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
notification is coming in and if I go

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:31.969 
notification is coming in and if I go
ahead<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:30.750> click<00:01:30.960> on<00:01:31.140> it<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.380> bouncing<00:01:31.770> will

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
ahead and click on it the bouncing will

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.890 
ahead and click on it the bouncing will
stop<00:01:32.310> now<00:01:33.030> if<00:01:33.180> I<00:01:33.240> go<00:01:33.270> ahead<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:33.509> send<00:01:33.810> myself

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
stop now if I go ahead and send myself

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.319 
stop now if I go ahead and send myself
another<00:01:34.380> application<00:01:34.920> here<00:01:35.400> this<00:01:35.850> works<00:01:36.119> if

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
another application here this works if

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.090
