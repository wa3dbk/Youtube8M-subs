00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:06.729
 hello today we are going to make a visit that already 

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:10.200
 you know that the kitchen of spoonfuls of 

00:00:06.729 --> 00:00:13.660
 love it and it's one of the stews that are 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:17.050
 classics in my kitchen that is the stew of 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:20.860
 noodles with in this case today I'm going to 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:23.289
 make clams and prawns we can 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.360
 do with any seafood thing that 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:26.920
 have unity I have here I am going to 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.360
 use I will not do much amount 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:31.150
 because nothing more for three people 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:34.989
 then I will use prawns that 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:37.520
 I have peeled and I tell you what it is that 

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:41.270
 I have in the fire I have 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.360
 the waterfalls and heads of prawns that 

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:46.370
 look 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:50.060
 I have it on with a little 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:53.600
 not much oil 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:55.910
 and come out then I have it I'm already I've 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.540
 given the turns a turn then 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:02.110
 now and now what I'm going to cover 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.110
 with water 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.910
 as the noodles are going to be not much 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.650
 amount costs a little needs so much 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:13.660
 but now you probably amount 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:17.100
 I put more what I want is to be seen 

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.100
 then now 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.200
 and I'm going to leave it cooking because I do not know 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:26.400
 around like 10 minutes while 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.890
 so much I have oil here a little bit of 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:32.280
 oil the quantities today will then be 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.530
 in the recipe in kitchen wine I have oil 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.330
 heating a saucepan in a saucepan 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.700
 where you but you have to do it 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:42.450
 so I'm going to fry it, I'm going to do the 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:45.090
 sofrito the sofrito for this stew all 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.659
 the partners are more or less but for 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.659
 supposed 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.460
 the onion 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:01.190
 the combo ring 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.880
 I'm just going to put tomato tomato is 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.520
 natural 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.090
 I've peeled it and I've stung it but 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:11.400
 you can also put natural tomato 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:14.610
 tempered canning that also gives a 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.980
 very rich result and I put a 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.599
 as you will see there is not much 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:22.319
 pepper I can put the pepper 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:27.530
 down green pepper is simply for 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:27.530
 give me and give it the flavor 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:35.520
 then I will now leave this to 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:39.930
 fire very strong but yes fire cheerful 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.930
 until it is at a certain point 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:46.480
 good to see this is going on the point 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:50.660
 I like 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:52.450
 already sofrito is already going as you want 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.360
 paste 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:59.230
 and then that's when I've already resumed 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:01.959
 start to take out all the sugars that 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.819
 is when it seems to me that it is in its 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:08.590
 point I have indicating 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:12.409
 as I said I'm going to turn it off and 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:15.459
 now I have put out the fire that was not 

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:18.459
 but nothing happens it is put back and 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:18.459
 so 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.730
 I have my broth 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:27.730
 duels 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:29.680
 I have more or less calculated 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.920
 the amount that I have of panel 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:36.099
 then as you will see it is very hot 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:40.390
 what facilitates me facilitates me 

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:42.670
 because this continues to continue boiling 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:46.140
 then I put a little leaf of 

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:50.760
 laurel or two as you want 

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:50.760
 essential saffron strands 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:56.790
 the cooked and inside and gives it that flavor 

00:03:54.320 --> 00:04:00.120
 characteristic impressive as you see 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:03.480
 the noodles I like yellow because I 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:07.320
 I put a coloring dummy and a 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:09.800
 that I have here made of agito and 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.800
 parsley 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:17.510
 with salt now and this lowered a little bit the 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:20.269
 fire diluted it here a little 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:24.740
 and I'm throwing it 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:27.410
 because raw garlic to the casserole text 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:31.590
 stew so you are very Mediterranean 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:33.210
 it gives a great mind then now 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:37.680
 how is this going to start boiling 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:41.870
 right away because it was already very hot 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:44.740
 I'm going to incorporate the noodles 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:49.010
 and at 5 minutes I will incorporate 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:52.750
 clams and prawns and then the 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:52.750
 last last minute 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:59.870
 good look at your website and what feeds 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:02.870
 Now I have the noodles because 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:04.670
 practically I have it with 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:07.100
 a great little color a consistency 

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:10.490
 ideal then now I put the 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:14.570
 clams the clams know that they open 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:17.090
 or opened quickly then immediately 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:20.840
 immediately after the clams start 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:24.220
 open it incorporated the prawns and 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:26.660
 prawns know what is seen and not seen 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:29.180
 immediately the prawn changes from 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:31.340
 I turn the fire off because 

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:33.650
 simply with that warmth that has 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:38.520
 inside the stew they are going to finish 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:42.680
 then make the clams 

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:47.400
 they are already wanting to start opening 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:52.490
 I will incorporate the prawns good this 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:52.490
 stew you do not know how delicious it is 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:59.180
 you can vary you can also put it in 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:01.100
 Instead of clams and prawns a 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:04.250
 Monkfish pieces are also going 

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:06.800
 fantastic and then look what to me 

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:09.530
 like to make the noodles in the end I 

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:11.870
 I always have dried peppermint that 

00:06:09.530 --> 00:06:15.529
 I have crumble and it's like that it's chopped 

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:18.109
 at the end of the stew I put 

00:06:15.529 --> 00:06:22.389
 sprinkle it with the mint and done 

00:06:18.109 --> 00:06:26.419
 It makes it taste a flavor 

00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:28.459
 wonderful then look at the prawn the 

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:33.550
 I have the shrimp open if it is 

00:06:28.459 --> 00:06:37.150
 already changing the color then now 

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:41.110
 it's time to cover it off the fire 

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:43.800
 and in one or two minutes and I served it 

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:43.800
 I teach it 

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:54.289
 good look at what this painting has visited 

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:57.949
 please is that he is saying com m 

00:06:54.289 --> 00:07:00.169
 so I encourage you that the met eyes 

00:06:57.949 --> 00:07:02.809
 in the kitchen and prepare it is to get 

00:07:00.169 --> 00:07:04.930
 the good one and if you have a twig of 

00:07:02.809 --> 00:07:09.120
 fresh peppermint 

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:09.120
 is that it is the ideal complement
