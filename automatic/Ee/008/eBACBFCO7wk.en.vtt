 human relations are very complicated 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:31.669
 third World 

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:36.400
 already has a whole complexity but in the set of people under one roof 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.790
 consumes the same source 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.790
 I believe they always fund them.

 on the internet, parents have less until I consider it to be very 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.580
 family 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.570

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.780
 sitting on the catwalks we try to 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.640
 the problem and try to help 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.890
 parents mainly 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.229
 But there must be these things that we sometimes do not wait for. 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.240
 people almost does not exist accept what happens with parents not the psychiatrist 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.479
 and writer and certainly exist in porto alegre launching his new book family 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:33.210
 high performance 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.850
 in his work he advocates 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.440
 the world of so many crisis modifications is necessary that the author is approved 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:44.909

 through high-performance what are the most common common problems 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.390
 in our family context

 first phase 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.420
 the fall of the product and with that 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.190
 to favor one of them I can not say 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.450
 The azure of these is a love. 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.049
 but that works more fully 

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:12.089
 impaired kipman 

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:15.149

 knows how to do 

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:29.659
 and I thought 

00:02:29.659 --> 00:02:31.299
 so everyone has their own 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:35.229
 When I say I do all the parents think they're doing the best I can 

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:39.629
 but this can only be father and mother is not enough 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:42.629
 to be educators for a world 

00:02:43.499 --> 00:02:45.959
 so it's important that parents 

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:51.099

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:11.679
 which causes therapy to separate 

00:03:11.679 --> 00:03:15.079
 people separation may be the best way out 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:16.499
 because lives together 

00:03:16.499 --> 00:03:19.069
 two people who are impossible to live with 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:23.229
 really will not mess up the other and not compose will not destroy the other
