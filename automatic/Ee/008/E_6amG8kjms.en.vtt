00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:20.460
 good morning sports fans from the alb 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:24.240
 gold games for wii sports and you are 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:27.539
 back to the third part of the biggest one 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.519
 Laying and lying our mainstream 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:33.809
 nutrition and today are our concern 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.700
 everyone should talk about cereals 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.210
 and eating cereal products 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.910
 Well, cereals and cereal products are 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.739
 to some extent problematic 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.010
 but we know that ours 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:50.149
 traditional nutritional pyramid out 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.289
 a basis of principle 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:56.309
 cereal products and still exists today 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:59.340
 almost always recommended 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:02.609
 but very much grain is enough to feed 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:05.100
 that does not necessarily mean in his 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:07.110
 Original form which we certainly already 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.580
 a whole while as a human being 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.979
 but of course far 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.840
 processed and there we come to one 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.880
 part of the whole problem 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.369
 So let's take a look at a few 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:20.060
 the evolutionary we humans 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:24.240
 have the homo sapiens since about 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:27.060
 Roughly 100,000 years of these 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:32.130
 100 thousand years we have between 90 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:34.350
 and about 95 1000 years ago 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.420
 Neolithic revolution Neolithic 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.840
 revolution with europe 10,000 years ago 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.610
 may offer 3,000 in the past 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.530
 Principle of the period in which we are 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.439
 have been settled therefore and 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.790
 an agricultural culture so one 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:48.180
 agriculture and livestock 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.270
 to have 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.619
 so now we can see that when 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.659
 huge time ahead of time 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.880
 hamburger at all great grain 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.799
 production has taken yes we have 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.330
 Carbohydrates are already there too 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.040
 have taken clear before the have 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:08.320
 also quite considerable share 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:10.570
 between 20 and 30 percent say the 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.940
 energy was already out then 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:15.070
 The carbohydrates basically swell 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.120
 were, of course, according to 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:19.270
 woods miss 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.950
 everything you can collect and yourself 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:24.580
 take note we already are channel 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:27.250
 at the processing level namely the 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:30.730
 Pure natural product in comparison to 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:33.460
 processing grade today okay now 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.900
 it's two big problems crops 

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.910
 and above all things soon 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.430
 processed cereals have one thing 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.720
 the so-called gluten is just that 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.430
 first nothing bad is gluten 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:46.240
 even a protein is one 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.680
 so-called klebereiweiß and it can in 

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:50.320
 consumed large quantities too 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.850
 feel incompatibilities and to do so 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.820
 cause that in principle we are big 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.410
 problems come nutrients get the 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:59.560
 to absorb nutrients 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:02.410
 the second is the leads him acid leads 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.360
 acid can in the sense also again 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:07.570
 many many processes in the body 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:10.500
 block and we have a shortage of 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:13.360
 micronutrients invite processed 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.070
 cereal products if needed with these 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.739
 Of course we want to cover 

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:20.800
 vegetables and fruit products very much 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:22.870
 much better and that does not mean 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.220
 that in principle we have no cholera there 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:27.040
 to take us and ourselves 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.790
 Cereal products are not in this sense 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.160
 the devil 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:33.459
 the amount in quotation marks makes that 

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:36.010
 poison it is wrong to say that is 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:38.110
 the basis of our daily diet 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:41.950
 because we see the result of that 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:43.390
 mostly on the street to run 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.400
 should be called people easy 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:48.760
 are overweight and not 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:50.680
 necessarily because eat poorly 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.700
 but maybe even like that 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:56.140
 the nutritional pyramid says ok 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.370
 summarized pretty short and 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.709
 crisp friends 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:02.580
 it is not that man 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:04.150
 in principle rely on it 

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:07.090
 Cereal products and above all things 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.720
 their processed forms but 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:10.480
 as 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:12.700
 come from one area of ​​one 

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:14.400
 condition in the fat ours 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:17.500
 main source of energy was 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.750
 Contrary to today where just carbohydrates 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:22.590
 our main source of energy too 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:25.030
 for the course of the day are that is 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.650
 just check for yourself how 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.560
 maybe your diet and yours 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.850
 guys composition looks 

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:34.000
 more detailed information also to 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:35.980
 Topic gluten anti nutrients and leads 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.590
 Of course you can find him in that 

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:40.540
 extensive article on facebook like 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:43.060
 always in the description linked and 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:43.780
 There are even more articles of this kind 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:45.940
 looking forward 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:48.400
 but today we keep it short and 

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:51.600
 crisp nutritional lie and myth 

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.140
 Number three everyone should have a lot 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:58.030
 eating cereal products 

00:04:53.140 --> 00:05:00.130
 I would say that was it 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.530
 a short summary for asia 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:06.510
 sports 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:06.510
 until next time dragon slayer
