00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 mr people today is about the plug-in 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.940
 ritually a really simple method 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.600
 with other players on the server too 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.280
 act 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.349
 there will be no shops and no money 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.910
 system needed you can just do that 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.799
 player you wanted to trade with 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.509
 act on a ship plus right click 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.190
 or do it with an incoming one 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.990
 the other player accepts these 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.160
 trade invitation and already appears 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.720
 our trade window 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.640
 there we can now our items 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.740
 exchange the items we exchange 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.300
 we want to click or place 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.699
 see our page in the inventory 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.439
 Trade windows are both sides 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.270
 agree so must on the green 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:34.800
 if you press the button 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.960
 wanted to cancel trading so you can 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.969
 also press the red button around the 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.350
 trade would have to accept again 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.820
 press the green button 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.129
 then the trade is completed 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.500
 the user parties then have the 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.079
 Items from each other to the trade 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:51.180
 The only drawback was given 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.070
 the communication is either on the phone 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.289
 via skype or teamspeak or trade 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.210
 beforehand in ingame chat from what you 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.250
 because wanted to exchange exactly because if I 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.020
 to insert a diamond tip is the 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.030
 others not only a stone block ins 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.710
 inventory put the balance you have to 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.270
 be found between the users 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.130
 Nevertheless, this plug-in is one 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.750
 wonderful extension so falls now 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.640
 the old one just has to go to the floor 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.189
 hope that the analysis of the 1 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.689
 get out load the plug-in 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.650
 underneath and just add it to yours 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.270
 plugin to a da 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.740
 is the server charged then, in 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.170
 plugins folder found a folder 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.100
 the rhi trade is called in the config 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.350
 we can now the individual 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.909
 text blocks still around German in the 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.400
 options we will find three more 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:31.619
 Hiring options week trading 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.600
 if this is worth crusoe on 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.790
 this activates the user the other user 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.990
 we can shift and right-click on one 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.939
 but then a per 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.369
 Mission used and indeed trade point 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.320
 gnutrade you have a server where it 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.729
 Maybe that would not be so beneficial 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.409
 as an option 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.670
 so you best leave it on wood 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.159
 we still have the possibility 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.659
 user with creative or border on the 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.130
 allow trade as well 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.350
 But this should be a good reason 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.060
 because if the user has the creative mob 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.070
 own is the plug-in yes anyway 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.409
 but something superfluous can but 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.340
 Simply put the items on mars into the market 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.320
 throw windows 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.969
 So choose wisely if he has this 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.950
 to set option or not 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.569
 best you leave it on wood 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.140
 otherwise there are no others 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.550
 mix 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.710
 In that we have a few more orders 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.570
 to act on a user we give / 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:18.700
 trade and in player names 1 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:21.670
 The opposite no invitation now with 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.620
 to accept straight and in player names 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.600
 if they are not traded on 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.850
 so can / critique only 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.680
 be entered so that all incoming 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.350
 trade requests are rejected 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:35.080
 with / travelload we reward the whole 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.910
 flicker okay with further questions 

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.380
 Comment the penner me and if that's it 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:42.270
 I would say again 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.270
 I'll see you in the next video
