another<00:01:06.600> thing<00:01:06.900> that<00:01:06.930> draws<00:01:07.350> me<00:01:07.409> to<00:01:08.070> creating

another thing that draws me to creating

another thing that draws me to creating
panoramic<00:01:09.060> mergers<00:01:09.450> is<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.780> complexity<00:01:10.500> of

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
panoramic mergers is the complexity of

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.620 
panoramic mergers is the complexity of
creating<00:01:11.159> them<00:01:11.340> it's<00:01:11.670> really<00:01:12.090> more<00:01:12.450> of<00:01:12.540> an

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
creating them it's really more of an

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.890 
creating them it's really more of an

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
photography that that forces you to

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.179 
photography that that forces you to
really<00:01:18.689> meter<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.259> scene<00:01:19.560> as<00:01:19.799> a<00:01:19.830> whole

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.170 
have a lot of fine details in the trees
that's<00:04:17.859> why<00:04:18.009> I've<00:04:18.099> zoomed<00:04:18.370> in<00:04:18.639> to<00:04:18.789> sort<00:04:19.000> of<00:04:19.060> see

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.899 
that's why I've zoomed in to sort of see
all<00:04:19.299> these<00:04:19.419> small<00:04:19.599> branches<00:04:20.259> i<00:04:20.440> can<00:04:21.159> i<00:04:21.370> can<00:04:21.639> add

00:04:21.899 --> 00:04:21.909 
all these small branches i can i can add

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:24.839 
all these small branches i can i can add
contrast<00:04:22.599> in<00:04:22.960> just<00:04:23.139> those<00:04:23.260> fine<00:04:23.710> detail<00:04:24.430> areas

reflections meet the water and and you

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:54.990 
reflections meet the water and and you
know<00:04:52.510> again<00:04:52.840> I<00:04:52.990> could<00:04:53.140> overdo<00:04:53.590> it<00:04:53.790> it's<00:04:54.790> also

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.000 
know again I could overdo it it's also

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.850 
know again I could overdo it it's also
going<00:04:55.180> to<00:04:55.240> affect<00:04:55.630> the<00:04:55.990> finer<00:04:56.260> details<00:04:56.410> a

going to affect the finer details a

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.710 
going to affect the finer details a
little<00:04:56.890> bit<00:04:57.340> but<00:04:57.520> but<00:04:57.790> mainly<00:04:58.150> it's<00:04:58.420> just

00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.720 
little bit but but mainly it's just

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:00.450 
little bit but but mainly it's just
working<00:04:59.110> in<00:04:59.230> the<00:04:59.380> area<00:04:59.560> that<00:04:59.800> image<00:05:00.250> that<00:05:00.280> I

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:03.690 
working in the area that image that I

want to play with here I'm going to tone

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:05.970 
want to play with here I'm going to tone
that<00:05:03.880> down<00:05:03.940> just<00:05:04.120> a<00:05:04.450> little<00:05:04.630> bit<00:05:04.750> if<00:05:05.350> we<00:05:05.950> zoom

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:05.980 
that down just a little bit if we zoom

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:08.340 
that down just a little bit if we zoom
back<00:05:06.490> out<00:05:06.760> and<00:05:07.180> we<00:05:07.420> look<00:05:07.630> at<00:05:07.750> this<00:05:07.870> image<00:05:08.080> as<00:05:08.320> a

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:08.350 
back out and we look at this image as a

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:13.200 
back out and we look at this image as a
whole<00:05:08.680> if<00:05:09.390> it<00:05:10.390> had<00:05:10.770> more<00:05:11.770> detail<00:05:12.520> in<00:05:12.820> the<00:05:12.910> sky

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:13.210 
whole if it had more detail in the sky

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:14.910 
whole if it had more detail in the sky
if<00:05:13.420> it<00:05:13.540> was<00:05:13.630> a<00:05:13.660> less<00:05:13.960> foggy<00:05:14.320> day<00:05:14.620> if<00:05:14.740> they<00:05:14.860> were

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:14.920 
if it was a less foggy day if they were

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.160 
if it was a less foggy day if they were
block<00:05:15.220> your<00:05:15.460> bulkier<00:05:15.880> clouds<00:05:16.180> then<00:05:16.540> the<00:05:16.690> large

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:17.170 
block your bulkier clouds then the large

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:18.510 
block your bulkier clouds then the large
details<00:05:17.740> would<00:05:17.980> make<00:05:18.130> more<00:05:18.340> of<00:05:18.400> a<00:05:18.490> difference

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:18.520 
details would make more of a difference

effect I just think it's it's a warmer
it's<00:06:39.800> more<00:06:39.980> pleasing<00:06:40.370> look<00:06:41.530> and<00:06:42.530> to<00:06:42.890> just<00:06:43.100> add

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:45.350 
one more a little bit of finishing

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:46.600 
one more a little bit of finishing
detail<00:06:45.710> to<00:06:45.800> this<00:06:45.950> image<00:06:46.100> I'm<00:06:46.310> going<00:06:46.340> to<00:06:46.490> add

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:46.610

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:48.910 
detail to this image I'm going to add
one<00:06:46.940> more<00:06:47.240> filter<00:06:47.690> to<00:06:47.960> my<00:06:48.050> filter<00:06:48.380> stack<00:06:48.620> and

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:48.920 
one more filter to my filter stack and

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:51.940 
one more filter to my filter stack and
that's<00:06:49.640> going<00:06:49.880> to<00:06:49.940> be<00:06:50.150> a<00:06:50.180> big<00:06:51.080> soft<00:06:51.500> evening

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:51.950 
that's going to be a big soft evening

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:54.610 
that's going to be a big soft evening
yet<00:06:52.220> I<00:06:52.520> love<00:06:53.510> the<00:06:53.690> way<00:06:53.810> that<00:06:53.840> that<00:06:54.140> sometimes

00:06:54.610 --> 00:06:54.620 
yet I love the way that that sometimes

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:56.980 
yet I love the way that that sometimes
focuses<00:06:55.310> the<00:06:55.460> eye<00:06:55.490> in<00:06:55.910> on<00:06:56.150> what's<00:06:56.360> important

00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:56.990 
focuses the eye in on what's important

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:59.710 
focuses the eye in on what's important
in<00:06:57.170> the<00:06:57.290> image<00:06:57.590> and<00:06:57.800> again<00:06:58.790> this<00:06:58.970> effect<00:06:59.390> there

00:06:59.710 --> 00:06:59.720 
in the image and again this effect there

00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:01.420 
in the image and again this effect there
we've<00:07:00.020> got<00:07:00.050> it<00:07:00.320> darkening<00:07:00.920> the<00:07:01.070> edges<00:07:01.400> a

00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:01.430 
we've got it darkening the edges a

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:03.220 
we've got it darkening the edges a
little<00:07:01.520> bit<00:07:01.790> I<00:07:01.820> think<00:07:01.910> it's<00:07:02.180> a<00:07:02.270> little<00:07:02.750> extreme

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:03.230 
little bit I think it's a little extreme

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:04.750 
little bit I think it's a little extreme
so<00:07:03.560> I'm<00:07:03.650> going<00:07:03.800> to<00:07:03.830> change<00:07:04.250> I'm<00:07:04.460> going<00:07:04.580> to<00:07:04.640> get

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:04.760 
so I'm going to change I'm going to get

00:07:04.760 --> 00:07:06.790 
so I'm going to change I'm going to get
rid<00:07:04.850> of<00:07:04.940> this<00:07:05.060> blending<00:07:05.480> option<00:07:05.810> site<00:07:06.020> I<00:07:06.260> can
