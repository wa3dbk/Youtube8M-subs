00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
makes it not as bad anymore is that when

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.260 
makes it not as bad anymore is that when
you<00:01:38.040> do<00:01:38.220> get<00:01:38.610> a<00:01:38.670> duplicate

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
you do get a duplicate

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.690 
you do get a duplicate
yet<00:01:39.630> you<00:01:39.840> makes<00:01:40.079> their<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:41.070> next<00:01:41.490> ability

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
yet you makes their the next ability

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.789 
yet you makes their the next ability
even<00:01:42.030> stronger<00:01:42.479> so<00:01:43.170> that's<00:01:43.409> one<00:01:43.590> good<00:01:43.770> thing

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
even stronger so that's one good thing

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.499 
even stronger so that's one good thing
about<00:01:43.979> before<00:01:44.460> getting<00:01:44.759> dufus<00:01:45.149> names<00:01:45.329> it's

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
about before getting dufus names it's

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.719 
about before getting dufus names it's
literally<00:01:45.810> a<00:01:45.840> waste<00:01:46.229> but<00:01:47.040> now<00:01:47.189> it's<00:01:47.369> not<00:01:47.520> so

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
literally a waste but now it's not so

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:48.889 
literally a waste but now it's not so
much<00:01:47.820> of<00:01:47.880> a<00:01:48.060> waste<00:01:48.180> and<00:01:48.360> now<00:01:48.450> we<00:01:48.509> can<00:01:48.659> actually

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
much of a waste and now we can actually

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.539 
much of a waste and now we can actually
make<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.140> elbow<00:01:49.290> catches<00:01:49.500> even<00:01:50.250> stronger

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
make the elbow catches even stronger

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.069 
make the elbow catches even stronger
