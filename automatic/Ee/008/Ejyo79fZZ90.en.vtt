00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
this but if you're hosting you have to

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.070 
this but if you're hosting you have to
wait<00:01:23.939> for<00:01:23.970> everyone<00:01:24.360> to<00:01:24.479> connect<00:01:24.869> first

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
wait for everyone to connect first

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.050 
wait for everyone to connect first
before<00:01:25.470> it's<00:01:25.950> a<00:01:26.070> good<00:01:26.220> idea<00:01:26.369> to<00:01:26.580> get<00:01:26.850> going

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
before it's a good idea to get going

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.390 
before it's a good idea to get going
because<00:01:27.470> onslaught<00:01:28.470> mode<00:01:28.530> is<00:01:28.860> really<00:01:29.189> about

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
because onslaught mode is really about

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.499 
because onslaught mode is really about
teamwork<00:01:30.619> so<00:01:31.619> far<00:01:31.860> I've<00:01:32.159> played<00:01:32.939> every<00:01:33.180> map

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
and if you complete them you get an

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.770 
and if you complete them you get an
achievement<00:01:34.770> for<00:01:35.189> every<00:01:35.400> map<00:01:35.610> and<00:01:35.850> at<00:01:36.689> the

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
essential in this game mode that

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.860 
essential in this game mode that
everyone<00:02:32.460> chooses<00:02:32.700> a<00:02:32.820> different<00:02:32.910> class<00:02:33.420> so

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
everyone chooses a different class so

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.050

about<00:02:34.710> the<00:02:34.860> first<00:02:35.040> half<00:02:35.250> of<00:02:35.340> the<00:02:35.430> game<00:02:35.459> we<00:02:35.850> have

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
about the first half of the game we have

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.080 
about the first half of the game we have
no<00:02:36.270> magic<00:02:36.480> which<00:02:37.160> isn't<00:02:38.160> the<00:02:38.250> smartest<00:02:38.430> idea

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
no magic which isn't the smartest idea

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.610 
no magic which isn't the smartest idea
you<00:02:39.270> usually<00:02:39.420> want<00:02:39.630> to<00:02:39.720> have<00:02:39.810> a<00:02:39.870> medic<00:02:40.170> on<00:02:40.290> hold

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
don't work as a team so for example of

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.060 
don't work as a team so for example of
the<00:02:49.110> maps<00:02:49.320> you've<00:02:49.530> played<00:02:49.770> the<00:02:49.950> most

the maps you've played the most

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:51.620 
the maps you've played the most
difficult<00:02:50.640> would<00:02:50.820> have<00:02:50.940> to<00:02:51.030> be<00:02:51.120> Atacama

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
difficult would have to be Atacama

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.350 
difficult would have to be Atacama
Desert<00:02:51.900> that<00:02:52.590> one<00:02:53.120> requires<00:02:54.120> the<00:02:54.300> most

Desert that one requires the most

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.699 
Desert that one requires the most
teamwork<00:02:54.810> spending<00:02:55.110> the<00:02:55.170> map<00:02:55.350> and<00:02:55.560> it's<00:02:55.650> the

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
teamwork spending the map and it's the

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.270 
teamwork spending the map and it's the
most<00:02:55.890> difficult<00:02:56.430> is<00:02:56.970> extremely<00:02:57.810> hard<00:02:58.280> it's

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
most difficult is extremely hard it's

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.699 
most difficult is extremely hard it's
not<00:02:59.370> fun<00:03:00.020> atacama<00:03:01.020> desert<00:03:01.200> i<00:03:01.410> don't<00:03:01.560> think

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
not fun atacama desert i don't think

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.490 
not fun atacama desert i don't think
i'll<00:03:01.830> be<00:03:01.890> replaying<00:03:02.280> that<00:03:02.370> one<00:03:02.670> very<00:03:02.850> much<00:03:03.500> and

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
i'll be replaying that one very much and

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:05.870 
i'll be replaying that one very much and
then<00:03:04.650> from<00:03:04.860> level<00:03:05.130> of<00:03:05.190> difficulty<00:03:05.490> next

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
then from level of difficulty next

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.840 
then from level of difficulty next
hardest<00:03:06.240> one<00:03:06.450> i<00:03:06.480> would<00:03:06.750> say<00:03:06.959> i<00:03:07.500> would<00:03:08.400> say<00:03:08.820> i

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
hardest one i would say i would say i

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.790 
hardest one i would say i would say i
guess<00:03:09.120> would<00:03:09.360> be<00:03:09.390> a<00:03:09.510> nice<00:03:10.140> laying<00:03:10.320> constant

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:10.800 
guess would be a nice laying constant

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.520 
guess would be a nice laying constant
ace<00:03:10.980> that<00:03:11.370> one<00:03:11.580> is<00:03:11.880> a<00:03:11.910> bit<00:03:12.180> a<00:03:12.420> bit<00:03:13.110> difficult

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:13.530 
ace that one is a bit a bit difficult

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.440 
ace that one is a bit a bit difficult
though<00:03:14.100> once<00:03:14.519> you<00:03:14.610> get<00:03:14.730> it<00:03:14.850> down<00:03:14.880> it's<00:03:15.239> pretty

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
though once you get it down it's pretty

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.479 
though once you get it down it's pretty
easy<00:03:15.600> i<00:03:16.050> took<00:03:16.380> us<00:03:16.590> two<00:03:16.739> tries<00:03:16.950> for<00:03:17.160> that<00:03:17.250> map

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
easy i took us two tries for that map

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.180 
easy i took us two tries for that map
auto<00:03:18.420> combi<00:03:18.690> desert<00:03:18.959> took<00:03:19.080> us<00:03:19.170> two<00:03:19.769> tries<00:03:20.010> as

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
auto combi desert took us two tries as

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.009 
auto combi desert took us two tries as
well<00:03:20.370> except<00:03:20.760> the<00:03:20.850> first<00:03:21.000> try<00:03:21.209> we<00:03:21.390> spent<00:03:21.660> 15

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
well except the first try we spent 15

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:23.600 
well except the first try we spent 15
minutes<00:03:22.200> and<00:03:22.410> then<00:03:22.470> died<00:03:22.709> second<00:03:23.220> try<00:03:23.370> we

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
minutes and then died second try we

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.600 
minutes and then died second try we
spent<00:03:23.820> 20<00:03:24.120> minutes<00:03:24.269> and<00:03:24.860> the<00:03:25.860> first<00:03:26.220> map<00:03:26.459> we

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
spent 20 minutes and the first map we

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.610 
spent 20 minutes and the first map we
did<00:03:26.760> ballots<00:03:27.090> paraiso<00:03:27.390> that<00:03:27.870> one<00:03:28.110> is<00:03:28.290> actually

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:28.620 
did ballots paraiso that one is actually

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:29.960 
did ballots paraiso that one is actually
not<00:03:28.709> that<00:03:28.769> hard<00:03:29.010> at<00:03:29.160> all<00:03:29.220> almost<00:03:29.580> pretty<00:03:29.760> easy

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
not that hard at all almost pretty easy

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.310 
not that hard at all almost pretty easy
it<00:03:30.180> just<00:03:30.239> takes<00:03:30.540> a<00:03:30.660> while<00:03:30.690> to<00:03:31.019> beat<00:03:31.200> because

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
it just takes a while to beat because

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.280 
it just takes a while to beat because
it's<00:03:31.530> very<00:03:31.650> long<00:03:32.540> by<00:03:33.540> far<00:03:33.870> this<00:03:33.900> is<00:03:34.170> the

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
it's very long by far this is the

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:35.900 
it's very long by far this is the
shortest<00:03:34.709> one<00:03:34.920> this<00:03:35.070> is<00:03:35.190> nelson<00:03:35.430> bay<00:03:35.700> this

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
shortest one this is nelson bay this

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:37.880 
shortest one this is nelson bay this
one's<00:03:36.150> probably<00:03:36.540> the<00:03:36.989> easiest<00:03:37.320> but<00:03:37.590> is<00:03:37.739> the

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
one's probably the easiest but is the

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:39.380 
one's probably the easiest but is the
last<00:03:38.130> one<00:03:38.340> in<00:03:38.459> the<00:03:38.519> list<00:03:38.700> we<00:03:38.910> went<00:03:39.090> through<00:03:39.239> the

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
last one in the list we went through the

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.449 
last one in the list we went through the
lists<00:03:39.780> Maps<00:03:40.050> this<00:03:40.290> game<00:03:40.440> type<00:03:40.590> in<00:03:40.769> order<00:03:41.100> so

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
lists Maps this game type in order so

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:44.360 
lists Maps this game type in order so
and<00:03:41.820> the<00:03:42.810> key<00:03:43.200> to<00:03:43.350> onslaught<00:03:43.739> mode<00:03:43.800> is<00:03:44.250> you

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
and the key to onslaught mode is you

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:45.890 
and the key to onslaught mode is you
want<00:03:44.580> to<00:03:44.700> clear<00:03:44.850> all<00:03:45.090> the<00:03:45.180> enemies<00:03:45.330> in<00:03:45.630> an<00:03:45.720> area

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
want to clear all the enemies in an area

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.620 
want to clear all the enemies in an area
and<00:03:46.230> the<00:03:47.190> reason<00:03:47.489> for<00:03:47.519> that<00:03:47.670> is<00:03:47.970> you<00:03:48.150> cannot

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
and the reason for that is you cannot

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.870 
and the reason for that is you cannot
capture<00:03:49.410> the<00:03:49.769> point<00:03:50.040> until<00:03:50.370> the<00:03:50.519> area<00:03:50.790> is

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
capture the point until the area is

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.360 
capture the point until the area is
clear<00:03:51.090> which<00:03:52.080> makes<00:03:52.320> it<00:03:52.380> very<00:03:52.500> hard<00:03:52.590> on<00:03:52.980> map

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
clear which makes it very hard on map

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:54.949 
clear which makes it very hard on map
like<00:03:53.580> autocom<00:03:54.000> a<00:03:54.030> desert<00:03:54.390> for<00:03:54.540> example<00:03:54.870> which

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
like autocom a desert for example which

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:56.780 
like autocom a desert for example which
is<00:03:55.019> the<00:03:55.080> most<00:03:55.200> difficult<00:03:55.320> one<00:03:55.739> enemies<00:03:56.640> will

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
is the most difficult one enemies will

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.280 
is the most difficult one enemies will
constantly<00:03:57.150> respond<00:03:57.600> very<00:03:57.810> close<00:03:58.110> to<00:03:58.260> the

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
constantly respond very close to the

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:59.900 
constantly respond very close to the
flag<00:03:58.620> so<00:03:58.920> unless<00:03:59.070> you<00:03:59.220> can<00:03:59.250> hold<00:03:59.549> them<00:03:59.760> back

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
flag so unless you can hold them back

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:01.850 
flag so unless you can hold them back
from<00:04:00.209> their<00:04:00.360> spawn<00:04:00.600> points<00:04:00.989> they<00:04:01.620> will

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
from their spawn points they will

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.160 
from their spawn points they will
immediately<00:04:02.459> run<00:04:02.940> into<00:04:03.180> the<00:04:03.299> flag<00:04:03.540> area<00:04:03.930> and

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
immediately run into the flag area and

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.560 
immediately run into the flag area and
stop<00:04:04.560> you're<00:04:04.860> capturing<00:04:05.430> process<00:04:06.299> which<00:04:06.450> is

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570 
stop you're capturing process which is

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:10.370 
stop you're capturing process which is
kind<00:04:06.780> of<00:04:06.900> annoying<00:04:07.080> but<00:04:07.610> whatever<00:04:08.660> and<00:04:09.660> as<00:04:09.870> you

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:10.380 
kind of annoying but whatever and as you

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:11.570 
kind of annoying but whatever and as you
can<00:04:10.530> see

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580 
can see

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.060 
can see
as<00:04:11.640> you<00:04:12.390> can<00:04:12.480> see<00:04:12.660> the<00:04:13.140> the<00:04:13.350> weather<00:04:13.590> effects

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.070 
as you can see the the weather effects

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:17.020 
as you can see the the weather effects
are<00:04:14.250> changed<00:04:14.730> for<00:04:15.150> each<00:04:15.600> map<00:04:15.930> so<00:04:16.590> for<00:04:16.799> example

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
are changed for each map so for example

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:18.890 
are changed for each map so for example
nelson<00:04:18.030> bay<00:04:18.120> is<00:04:18.180> normally<00:04:18.630> a<00:04:18.660> night

on this map the choppers are the hardest
enemies<00:04:32.310> to<00:04:32.460> take<00:04:32.640> down<00:04:32.850> they'll<00:04:33.450> fly<00:04:33.990> around

there would have been a smaller little
look<00:06:15.750> like<00:06:15.930> garage<00:06:16.290> type<00:06:16.650> building<00:06:17.720> for<00:06:18.720> rush

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:18.960 
look like garage type building for rush

the maps have vehicles it's the only one
I<00:06:26.069> could<00:06:26.190> think<00:06:26.250> of<00:06:26.400> the<00:06:26.520> has<00:06:26.639> like<00:06:26.789> enemy

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:27.060 
I could think of the has like enemy

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:30.439 
I could think of the has like enemy
buggies<00:06:27.590> but<00:06:28.590> my<00:06:28.949> friend<00:06:29.160> mal<00:06:29.370> runs<00:06:29.879> up<00:06:30.120> to<00:06:30.150> it

00:06:30.439 --> 00:06:30.449 
buggies but my friend mal runs up to it

00:06:30.449 --> 00:06:32.360 
buggies but my friend mal runs up to it
with<00:06:30.569> an<00:06:30.690> m60<00:06:31.199> and<00:06:31.349> kills<00:06:31.710> all<00:06:31.860> passengers

with an m60 and kills all passengers
within<00:06:32.639> it<00:06:33.000> so<00:06:33.300> then<00:06:33.840> give<00:06:34.050> us<00:06:34.080> much<00:06:34.289> of<00:06:34.319> a

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:34.470 
within it so then give us much of a

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:37.610 
within it so then give us much of a
problem<00:06:34.680> if<00:06:35.520> you<00:06:36.419> if<00:06:36.750> you<00:06:36.930> don't<00:06:37.110> have<00:06:37.379> an

playing<00:06:42.449> a<00:06:42.599> different<00:06:42.870> class<00:06:43.069> so<00:06:44.069> we<00:06:44.759> actually

00:06:44.899 --> 00:06:44.909 
playing a different class so we actually

00:06:44.909 --> 00:06:47.170 
playing a different class so we actually
had<00:06:45.150> to<00:06:45.240> have<00:06:45.330> our<00:06:45.509> snipers<00:06:45.960> try<00:06:46.139> to<00:06:46.199> kill<00:06:46.530> the

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:47.180

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:48.990 
pilots of the helicopter the sniper

00:06:48.990 --> 00:06:51.710 
pilots of the helicopter the sniper
rifle<00:06:49.379> which<00:06:49.500> was<00:06:49.680> not<00:06:50.099> too<00:06:50.400> easy<00:06:51.389> it<00:06:51.629> was

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:51.720 
rifle which was not too easy it was

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:54.649 
rifle which was not too easy it was
pretty<00:06:51.900> difficult<00:06:53.180> but<00:06:54.180> as<00:06:54.300> you<00:06:54.419> can<00:06:54.479> see<00:06:54.569> the

00:06:54.649 --> 00:06:54.659 
pretty difficult but as you can see the

00:06:54.659 --> 00:06:55.879 
pretty difficult but as you can see the
maps<00:06:54.840> are<00:06:54.960> pretty<00:06:55.139> much<00:06:55.229> unchanged<00:06:55.800> from

00:06:55.879 --> 00:06:55.889 
maps are pretty much unchanged from

00:06:55.889 --> 00:06:57.649 
maps are pretty much unchanged from
multiplayer<00:06:56.400> there<00:06:56.610> just<00:06:56.729> a<00:06:56.819> few<00:06:56.849> building

00:06:57.649 --> 00:06:57.659 
multiplayer there just a few building

00:06:57.659 --> 00:07:01.430 
multiplayer there just a few building
rearrangements<00:06:58.500> and<00:06:59.690> time<00:07:00.690> of<00:07:00.840> day<00:07:00.960> changes

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:01.440 
rearrangements and time of day changes

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:03.589 
rearrangements and time of day changes
but<00:07:01.680> other<00:07:01.800> than<00:07:01.919> that<00:07:02.039> it's<00:07:02.880> the<00:07:03.300> same

00:07:03.589 --> 00:07:03.599 
but other than that it's the same

00:07:03.599 --> 00:07:05.570 
but other than that it's the same
multiplayer<00:07:04.110> maps<00:07:04.380> just<00:07:04.680> in<00:07:04.770> a<00:07:04.830> coop<00:07:05.159> setting

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:05.580 
multiplayer maps just in a coop setting

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:07.490 
multiplayer maps just in a coop setting
which<00:07:05.729> is<00:07:05.940> it<00:07:06.240> feels<00:07:06.479> kind<00:07:06.690> of<00:07:06.750> strange<00:07:06.870> but<00:07:07.440> I

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:07.500 
which is it feels kind of strange but I

00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:10.189 
which is it feels kind of strange but I
like<00:07:08.069> it<00:07:08.250> it<00:07:08.400> makes<00:07:08.580> them<00:07:08.699> feel<00:07:08.759> new<00:07:09.060> but<00:07:09.360> they

00:07:10.189 --> 00:07:10.199 
like it it makes them feel new but they

00:07:10.199 --> 00:07:11.809 
like it it makes them feel new but they
have<00:07:10.319> yet<00:07:10.349> to<00:07:10.590> actually<00:07:10.680> make<00:07:11.099> new<00:07:11.340> maps<00:07:11.580> for

00:07:11.809 --> 00:07:11.819

this<00:07:11.909> game<00:07:12.090> which<00:07:12.270> is<00:07:12.389> kind<00:07:12.569> of<00:07:12.599> disappointing

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:12.750 
this game which is kind of disappointing

00:07:12.750 --> 00:07:15.709 
this game which is kind of disappointing
but<00:07:13.349> and<00:07:13.729> so<00:07:14.729> we<00:07:14.849> can<00:07:14.969> just<00:07:15.120> hide<00:07:15.479> in<00:07:15.630> this

00:07:15.709 --> 00:07:15.719
