00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.150 
because I think there was only like a

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.440 
because I think there was only like a
million<00:01:09.150> made<00:01:09.540> in<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:09.840> world<00:01:10.049> so<00:01:11.000> there's<00:01:12.000> you

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
million made in the world so there's you

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
million made in the world so there's you
can<00:01:12.570> see<00:01:12.659> that<00:01:12.780> there<00:01:12.960> there's<00:01:13.200> my<00:01:13.409> number

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470
