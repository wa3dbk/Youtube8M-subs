360 did well from this image here we can

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.710 
360 did well from this image here we can
see<00:03:15.540> that<00:03:15.720> the<00:03:15.840> Xbox<00:03:16.230> one<00:03:16.410> has<00:03:16.560> a<00:03:16.680> gigantic

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
see that the Xbox one has a gigantic

see that the Xbox one has a gigantic
external<00:03:18.720> power<00:03:18.959> supply<00:03:19.350> I<00:03:19.620> mean<00:03:19.890> that<00:03:20.040> thing

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
external power supply I mean that thing

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.150 
external power supply I mean that thing
is<00:03:20.459> as<00:03:20.970> big<00:03:21.329> as<00:03:21.450> a<00:03:21.480> console<00:03:21.989> itself<00:03:22.470> so

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
is as big as a console itself so

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.640 
is as big as a console itself so
actually<00:03:23.579> I<00:03:23.640> suppose<00:03:23.820> the<00:03:24.150> the<00:03:24.600> Xbox<00:03:25.110> one<00:03:25.350> is<00:03:25.590> a

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
actually I suppose the the Xbox one is a

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.319 
actually I suppose the the Xbox one is a
bit<00:03:26.010> better<00:03:26.190> value<00:03:26.670> for<00:03:26.700> money<00:03:26.970> now

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:27.329 
bit better value for money now

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:29.330 
bit better value for money now

for the price of one and how Sony

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:36.380 
for the price of one and how Sony
managed<00:03:33.750> to<00:03:33.930> get<00:03:34.140> their<00:03:34.980> power<00:03:35.310> supply<00:03:35.730> inside
