00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 years people what is going on and cordial 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.250
 welcome to another video from 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.420
 I and I would say we see each other 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.420
 right after the commercial break 

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:19.740
 yes and that is exactly why it should be today 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.880
 are about advertising and a small one 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.050
 I have to find an incision for it 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.550
 I first thought the comparison 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.109
 television advertising with the youtube 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.670
 diagonally advertised and that 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.750
 it is so I really look very whole 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.250
 rarely tv but if i am 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.080
 watch TV watch tv then made to 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.369
 and what do i see go directly to application 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.870
 also because i have some short advertising 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:35.610
 as is often the case, for example 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.070
 no advertising lasts five minutes 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.480
 ten minutes and there just a half 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.250
 Eternity and you see things that I 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.600
 just be interested in whether youtube 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.710
 however, it looks quite different from me 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.600
 find five seconds who mosimann 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.550
 skipping can not bother 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.870
 and of course every 20 30 seconds 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.860
 it gets really annoying but 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.030
 I think you can do that too 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.960
 cope when you consider times 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.219
 that one actually does not work on the 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.719
 youtuber paid for that as well 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.190
 only source of income is I am 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:57.149
 none said year switched off netbook 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.559
 because basically it actually has to 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.300
 everyone knows but I am just 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.399
 today with you just about this 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.750
 Talking about the topic is lately 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.670
 It's very much on that very many youtube 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.500
 logic base and operate precisely 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.540
 because the advertising is not the reason 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.280
 more for your earning potential 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.110
 sufficient so I find product placement 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.150
 also personally okay I think it's okay 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.619
 as long as the one advertising for that 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.180
 product makes use of the product itself 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.439
 and also for good can because 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.640
 you just advertising for every shit has 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.409
 as I partly already experienced 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.490
 then I really want that critically 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.200
 that is, for example, with display 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.820
 Advertising for a key store makes me 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.140
 that's absolutely legit. I mean why then 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.460
 not if he plays your own 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.780
 buys if he gets discounts if 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.110
 we get discount on it 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.670
 page 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.049
 but then all but have two of them 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.280
 Suggest a beauty youtuber advertising for 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.630
 a product is something for example right 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.590
 unhealthy and shit is then you have to 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.850
 Of course, the whole thing again 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.960
 superior but that it just the way 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.400
 you instead of point and again 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.560
 to come back to it as it is with 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.630
 the advertising is in front of videos or just in 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.799
 video ads finds that absolutely in 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.240
 okay if you down a little 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.380
 display on plot if I have a 5 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.159
 seconds advertising in the beginning about 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.780
 can skip 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.280
 and if only 20 or 30 alone 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.869
 seconds who gets it just me 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.280
 short of the window do something else 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.180
 then comes back or they have indeed 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.530
 already happy and I know that 

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.860
 just the youtuber to support that 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.299
 wanted 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.469
 which has earned it and if I do that 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.909
 he with the tv movie light where just 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.320
 just a movie is really there now 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.549
 Not too much effort for the station 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.060
 It was clear he had the right and shopping 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.740
 Etc 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.149
 Photo not yet showing partially in 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.770
 the show on knock then I find 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.420
 that really really borderline and 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.770
 then really invent that as disturbing 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.970
 So make yourself easy in any case 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:17.040
 let's think about product 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.410
 placement about advertising on tv about 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.060
 advertising on youtube and write yours 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.739
 point of view in the comments I 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.849
 I now have my point a little bit 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.530
 get closer to me sometimes interested 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:26.760
 what you think and understand now 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.270
 I'm pretty wrong now none of the 

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.950
 he says 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:31.110
 block out because it itches me personally 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.880
 Sure little, at least, or away 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.880
 his or hers will shoot until next time
