00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.969
 very good to everyone I say very good to 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.379
 all guys and girls how am I poker 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.759
 and today I bring you the next episode of 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.669
 the weapons guide we enter with move 

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:22.289
 of the dead with the uci pistol 

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:24.060
 machine gun that we can get in 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.489
 enough parts of the map to be 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.200
 exact I think that in two that was one and the 

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:30.180
 another is where we buy it 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.700
 where is the prestidigitation drink 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:35.070
 a little bit before we're going to see 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.920
 features so flip slope 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.020
 1500 the 750 gun recharge ammunition without 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.789
 improve and ammo improved 4,500 this 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.430
 it is usually something typical of call of duty 

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:47.070
 the zombies and well let's start with 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:48.720
 the theme of how it goes in short rounds without 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.890
 no kind of good life counting here 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:51.690
 the double shot since you already know that 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.310
 increases the cadence and increases the damage of 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.360
 each one of the bullets but some I have 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:55.590
 to say that being a gun 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.460
 machine gun the truth that goes pretty 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.140
 cheto goes well, characteristics that 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.399
 they are very light as you are seeing in 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.780
 this ball here is like 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.670
 we were running practically with 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.560
 the m19 11 that to say it some way 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:11.140
 it would be one of the most 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.869
 little heavy or lighter this new 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.299
 video but good if we count the uc that 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:19.570
 has 25 bullets of main loaders 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:20.950
 and 275 additional we put ourselves with 300 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.780
 bullets with a weapon that also serves us 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.250
 to make balls that really we 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.289
 can save us from trouble and we have to 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.570
 do some kind of facing the trainer 

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:31.060
 escape some situation enough 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.829
 uncomfortable with the truth that we could come 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.970
 pretty good let's see how it is 

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:35.409
 begins to behave in rounds a 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.759
 little taller you know I have the 

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:38.950
 double shot this situation quite 

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:40.929
 advisable in practically each 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.200
 of the lives of each of the guide of 

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:44.909
 weapons of this 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.119
 in general the move on the dead or of 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.289
 any other map as it is quite 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:51.060
 essential to carry the two more than 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:53.009
 nothing because they increase the cadence and the 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.390
 damage and of course the recharge more 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.619
 fast so I failed but with ais 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.869
 Apparently they not even give me time 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.420
 escape but well we improve it and it happens to 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.399
 call yourself uncle walt and you see what name 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.229
 they expose you but you 're going to have 25 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.869
 300 main load bullets 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:09.780
 secondary and let's be realistic we just 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.430
 they give 25 more bullets that is to say that could 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.379
 have been to give us double the 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.209
 loaders but not real come 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:16.739
 busy without improving remember that 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:20.010
 to win pasta because it's practically 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:21.299
 of the best and kills pretty well kills 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.370
 quite well has a very good cadence 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:25.079
 high shooting as I say and I insist 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.360
 very easy to put zombies with her is that 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:29.069
 they weigh practically nothing and serve us 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.900
 enough for it today is released 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:32.610
 the round of 17 is not that it's a weapon 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.040
 to climb rounds is rather to be 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.319
 between a round 10 and 20 more or less 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.940
 rounds so it's perfect those rounds 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:41.370
 to take money and this weapon the truth 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.140
 who can give it to us, let's see also 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.360
 how does he behave with shooting from the 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.700
 hip 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:48.920
 it is very reliable that is, they are not going to see 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.440
 how to see her my little girl occupies very little and 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.030
 the one that we practically point to the neck 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.190
 the shots that you do well because it will not 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:56.750
 head or trunk not then 

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.490
 pointing from the hip to the neck the 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:00.800
 it's true that he also earns a lot 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:02.570
 we need the daiquiri so that 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.800
 this weapon is better because with the 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.420
 only daiquiri that we are going to do is 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.500
 waste bullets and with the cadence is 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.370
 Of course he has then we would lose 

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:11.270
 enough so up to here the guide 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.100
 recommended as I tell you 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:14.840
 entrance round 10 every 20 to our 

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.200
 let's have a strategy with traps 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.459
 close to one of this one of the 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.320
 areas of purchase of this weapon then 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:23.090
 it would come pretty well so nothing 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.770
 guys here I leave you I hope that I have 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.780
 like this first episode again 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:28.820
 of extra products of new weapons 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.650
 new measurements and so on so nothing a 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.840
 kiss for all be happy see you 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.020
 in upcoming videos 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.020
 bye 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.970
 Quick 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.970
