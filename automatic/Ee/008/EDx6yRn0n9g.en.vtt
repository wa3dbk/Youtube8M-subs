00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:16.299 
I was in high school so I and I'd play

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:19.300 
games all my life I got my PhD in

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.450 
games all my life I got my PhD in
underwater<00:00:19.990> robotics<00:00:20.439> we're<00:00:21.130> actually<00:00:21.310> using

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:21.460 
underwater robotics we're actually using

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.730 
underwater robotics we're actually using
an<00:00:21.790> underwater<00:00:22.090> robot<00:00:22.540> to<00:00:22.750> track<00:00:23.020> fish<00:00:23.349> and<00:00:23.680> to

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:23.740 
an underwater robot to track fish and to

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.710 
an underwater robot to track fish and to
build<00:00:23.890> maps<00:00:24.279> of<00:00:24.490> the<00:00:24.580> ocean<00:00:24.849> floor<00:00:25.150> you<00:00:25.599> know

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:25.720 
build maps of the ocean floor you know

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.269 
build maps of the ocean floor you know
the<00:00:25.840> thing<00:00:25.869> I<00:00:26.020> remember<00:00:26.349> most<00:00:26.680> is<00:00:27.009> when<00:00:27.160> we

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:27.279 
the thing I remember most is when we

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:28.740 
the thing I remember most is when we
launched<00:00:27.580> I<00:00:27.699> toy<00:00:27.910> because<00:00:28.180> that's<00:00:28.420> the<00:00:28.570> thing

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:28.750 
launched I toy because that's the thing

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:30.929 
launched I toy because that's the thing
that<00:00:28.779> I<00:00:28.990> was<00:00:29.109> most<00:00:29.320> involved<00:00:29.770> with<00:00:29.920> taking<00:00:30.730> I

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:30.939 
that I was most involved with taking I

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:33.630 
that I was most involved with taking I
toy<00:00:31.270> from<00:00:31.630> research<00:00:32.260> project<00:00:32.890> to<00:00:33.129> a<00:00:33.309> final

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:33.640 
toy from research project to a final

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.549 
toy from research project to a final
product<00:00:33.940> without<00:00:34.570> way<00:00:34.900> we<00:00:35.019> really<00:00:35.260> wanted<00:00:35.500> to

00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:35.559 
product without way we really wanted to

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:37.410 
product without way we really wanted to
explore<00:00:35.890> new<00:00:35.949> gaming<00:00:36.400> possibilities<00:00:37.120> so<00:00:37.300> we

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:37.420 
explore new gaming possibilities so we

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:38.460 
explore new gaming possibilities so we
tried<00:00:37.660> different<00:00:37.870> things<00:00:38.019> where<00:00:38.320> you<00:00:38.379> use

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:38.470 
tried different things where you use

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.200 
tried different things where you use
your<00:00:38.590> body<00:00:38.800> in<00:00:38.980> different<00:00:39.250> ways<00:00:39.370> some<00:00:39.970> things

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.210 
your body in different ways some things

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:41.820 
your body in different ways some things
using<00:00:40.420> your<00:00:40.629> head<00:00:40.840> some<00:00:41.199> things<00:00:41.379> using<00:00:41.590> your

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:41.830 
using your head some things using your

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:44.100 
using your head some things using your
hands<00:00:42.220> lots<00:00:42.610> of<00:00:42.699> kind<00:00:43.000> of<00:00:43.090> moving<00:00:43.480> your<00:00:43.690> arms

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:44.110 
hands lots of kind of moving your arms

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:46.049 
hands lots of kind of moving your arms
about<00:00:44.380> some<00:00:45.340> things<00:00:45.550> where<00:00:45.700> you<00:00:45.790> can<00:00:45.910> actually

00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:46.059 
about some things where you can actually

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:48.720 
about some things where you can actually
select<00:00:46.390> something<00:00:46.780> more<00:00:47.469> precisely<00:00:47.860> so<00:00:48.340> we're

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:48.730 
select something more precisely so we're

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:49.889 
select something more precisely so we're
really<00:00:48.880> looking<00:00:49.120> at<00:00:49.329> a<00:00:49.360> lot<00:00:49.480> of<00:00:49.540> different

00:00:49.889 --> 00:00:49.899 
really looking at a lot of different

00:00:49.899 --> 00:01:06.230 
really looking at a lot of different
avenues<00:00:50.020> of<00:00:50.260> what<00:00:50.559> people<00:00:50.829> might<00:00:50.860> like

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.880 

seemed<00:01:07.240> that<00:01:07.420> we<00:01:07.750> kept<00:01:07.990> running<00:01:08.320> into<00:01:08.380> a<00:01:08.620> kind

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
seemed that we kept running into a kind

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.080 
seemed that we kept running into a kind
of<00:01:08.979> a<00:01:09.070> limit<00:01:09.400> of<00:01:09.490> the<00:01:09.610> kind<00:01:09.820> of<00:01:09.909> game

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.090 
of a limit of the kind of game

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:11.880 
of a limit of the kind of game
experiences<00:01:10.720> you<00:01:10.840> could<00:01:10.960> do<00:01:11.140> with<00:01:11.350> just<00:01:11.710> your

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:11.890 
experiences you could do with just your

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.070 
experiences you could do with just your
body<00:01:12.070> we've<00:01:12.610> had<00:01:12.850> some<00:01:13.060> really<00:01:13.210> fun<00:01:13.540> things

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080 
body we've had some really fun things

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:15.390 
body we've had some really fun things
you<00:01:14.229> could<00:01:14.350> do<00:01:14.440> but<00:01:14.590> they<00:01:14.740> tended<00:01:15.220> to<00:01:15.310> be

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:15.400 
you could do but they tended to be

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.310 
you could do but they tended to be
shallow<00:01:15.700> and<00:01:16.090> kind<00:01:16.240> of<00:01:16.330> mini<00:01:16.510> game<00:01:16.750> like<00:01:17.020> aight

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:17.320 
shallow and kind of mini game like aight

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:18.780 
shallow and kind of mini game like aight
when<00:01:17.530> we<00:01:17.680> had<00:01:17.800> the<00:01:18.070> ability<00:01:18.280> to<00:01:18.550> select

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:18.790 
when we had the ability to select

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:20.190 
when we had the ability to select
buttons<00:01:19.119> with<00:01:19.240> just<00:01:19.450> your<00:01:19.540> hands<00:01:19.960> and<00:01:20.080> that

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
buttons with just your hands and that

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.870 
buttons with just your hands and that
was<00:01:20.320> kind<00:01:20.500> of<00:01:20.530> neat<00:01:20.800> and<00:01:21.010> magical<00:01:21.520> but<00:01:21.790> it

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:21.880 
was kind of neat and magical but it

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.520 
was kind of neat and magical but it
actually<00:01:22.000> got<00:01:22.240> pretty<00:01:22.300> steyr<00:01:22.750> Simic<00:01:23.110> what<00:01:23.229> we

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
actually got pretty steyr Simic what we

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.290 
actually got pretty steyr Simic what we
discover<00:01:23.890> his<00:01:24.009> people<00:01:24.280> like<00:01:24.490> some<00:01:25.090> of<00:01:25.210> the

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:25.300 
discover his people like some of the

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:26.790 
discover his people like some of the
demos<00:01:25.570> we<00:01:25.780> had<00:01:25.960> where<00:01:26.170> you<00:01:26.259> actually<00:01:26.410> held

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:26.800 
demos we had where you actually held

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.140 
demos we had where you actually held
something<00:01:27.040> your<00:01:27.280> hand<00:01:27.520> and<00:01:27.640> it<00:01:27.700> was<00:01:27.790> tracking

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:28.150 
something your hand and it was tracking

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.030 
something your hand and it was tracking
that<00:01:28.300> more<00:01:28.479> precisely<00:01:28.869> these<00:01:29.409> experiences

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.040 
that more precisely these experiences

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.399 
that more precisely these experiences
gave<00:01:30.250> us<00:01:30.400> more<00:01:30.700> gameplay<00:01:31.000> opportunities<00:01:31.810> so

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:32.409 
gave us more gameplay opportunities so

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:33.990 
gave us more gameplay opportunities so
if<00:01:32.530> we<00:01:32.619> could<00:01:32.770> actually<00:01:32.920> make<00:01:33.220> a<00:01:33.430> controller

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 
if we could actually make a controller

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.070 
if we could actually make a controller
that<00:01:34.180> you<00:01:34.300> held<00:01:34.479> your<00:01:34.570> hand<00:01:34.690> and<00:01:34.930> that

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:35.080 
that you held your hand and that

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.780 
that you held your hand and that
combined<00:01:35.500> with<00:01:35.590> the<00:01:35.800> camera<00:01:36.190> we<00:01:36.490> felt<00:01:36.729> that

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 
combined with the camera we felt that

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:42.480 
combined with the camera we felt that
would<00:01:37.030> be<00:01:37.150> the<00:01:37.270> best<00:01:37.450> thing<00:01:37.600> we<00:01:37.720> could<00:01:37.840> make<00:01:41.490> so

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
would be the best thing we could make so

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.370 
would be the best thing we could make so
the<00:01:42.520> biggest<00:01:43.090> advantages<00:01:43.960> we<00:01:44.110> get<00:01:44.259> with

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
the biggest advantages we get with

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.560 
the biggest advantages we get with
PlayStation<00:01:44.890> Move<00:01:45.039> are<00:01:45.340> that<00:01:45.880> it<00:01:46.149> can<00:01:46.479> be

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
PlayStation Move are that it can be

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.359 
PlayStation Move are that it can be
tracked<00:01:46.810> very<00:01:47.170> precisely<00:01:47.680> unlike<00:01:48.100> trying<00:01:48.310> to

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:48.369 
tracked very precisely unlike trying to

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:50.040 
tracked very precisely unlike trying to
track<00:01:48.550> somebody's<00:01:48.910> body<00:01:49.119> everybody's<00:01:49.750> body

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:50.050 
track somebody's body everybody's body

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:51.690 
track somebody's body everybody's body
is<00:01:50.289> a<00:01:50.320> little<00:01:50.530> different<00:01:50.890> the<00:01:51.310> move<00:01:51.520> is

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
is a little different the move is

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.700 
is a little different the move is
exactly<00:01:52.210> the<00:01:52.360> same<00:01:52.570> in<00:01:52.780> every<00:01:52.869> way<00:01:53.140> it<00:01:53.410> also

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:53.710 
exactly the same in every way it also

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.130 
exactly the same in every way it also
works<00:01:53.890> in<00:01:54.369> the<00:01:54.460> dark<00:01:54.700> perfectly<00:01:55.479> and<00:01:55.660> we<00:01:56.020> have

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
works in the dark perfectly and we have

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.900 
works in the dark perfectly and we have
sensors<00:01:56.590> inside<00:01:57.009> the<00:01:57.220> move<00:01:57.399> which<00:01:57.610> gives<00:01:57.789> us

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:57.910 
sensors inside the move which gives us

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:59.790 
sensors inside the move which gives us
even<00:01:58.179> more<00:01:58.210> kind<00:01:58.990> of<00:01:59.050> responsiveness<00:01:59.590> and

00:01:59.790 --> 00:01:59.800 
even more kind of responsiveness and

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.440 
even more kind of responsiveness and
precision<00:02:00.310> if<00:02:00.490> you<00:02:00.550> have<00:02:00.729> the<00:02:01.000> buttons<00:02:01.300> that

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:01.450 
precision if you have the buttons that

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:02.820 
precision if you have the buttons that
you're<00:02:01.570> holding<00:02:01.929> in<00:02:02.020> your<00:02:02.050> hand<00:02:02.289> so<00:02:02.470> not<00:02:02.679> only

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:02.830 
you're holding in your hand so not only

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:04.410 
you're holding in your hand so not only
can<00:02:02.979> you<00:02:03.130> do<00:02:03.369> these<00:02:03.520> spatial<00:02:04.030> things<00:02:04.240> by

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
can you do these spatial things by

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.270 
can you do these spatial things by
moving<00:02:04.690> the<00:02:05.080> move<00:02:05.229> around<00:02:05.470> but<00:02:05.800> we<00:02:06.130> can

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
moving the move around but we can

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:07.950 
moving the move around but we can
actually<00:02:06.399> select<00:02:06.729> things<00:02:07.060> very<00:02:07.270> quickly<00:02:07.450> by

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
actually select things very quickly by

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:09.120 
actually select things very quickly by
using<00:02:08.170> the<00:02:08.350> buttons<00:02:08.649> if<00:02:08.890> you<00:02:08.950> take

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
using the buttons if you take

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.250 
using the buttons if you take
PlayStation<00:02:09.700> Move<00:02:09.850> and<00:02:10.149> combine<00:02:10.570> it<00:02:10.600> with<00:02:10.750> 3d

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
PlayStation Move and combine it with 3d

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.319 
PlayStation Move and combine it with 3d
glasses<00:02:11.590> you<00:02:11.950> get<00:02:12.100> a<00:02:12.130> completely<00:02:12.760> new<00:02:12.940> kind<00:02:13.239> of

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:13.329 
glasses you get a completely new kind of

00:02:13.329 --> 00:02:15.030 
glasses you get a completely new kind of
experience<00:02:14.200> because<00:02:14.440> you<00:02:14.560> can<00:02:14.680> actually<00:02:14.860> see

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
experience because you can actually see

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.920 
experience because you can actually see
a<00:02:15.370> 3d<00:02:15.730> world<00:02:16.030> around<00:02:16.269> you<00:02:16.510> and<00:02:16.600> then<00:02:16.720> reach

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
a 3d world around you and then reach

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:19.050 
a 3d world around you and then reach
into<00:02:17.290> that<00:02:17.320> 3d<00:02:17.769> world<00:02:18.100> and<00:02:18.310> directly<00:02:18.549> interact

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
into that 3d world and directly interact

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.830 
into that 3d world and directly interact
with<00:02:19.239> it

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.750 

we've<00:02:23.680> learned<00:02:23.890> a<00:02:23.980> lot<00:02:24.099> over<00:02:24.160> the<00:02:24.430> last<00:02:24.459> 10

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:24.760 
we've learned a lot over the last 10

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.160 
we've learned a lot over the last 10
years<00:02:24.790> looking<00:02:25.209> at<00:02:25.300> different<00:02:25.690> ways<00:02:25.720> to<00:02:25.840> play

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
years looking at different ways to play

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.720 
years looking at different ways to play
games<00:02:26.440> we<00:02:26.920> looked<00:02:27.129> at<00:02:27.220> what<00:02:27.340> we<00:02:27.430> could<00:02:27.550> do<00:02:27.640> with

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
games we looked at what we could do with

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.190 
games we looked at what we could do with
just<00:02:28.000> the<00:02:28.090> camera<00:02:28.510> and<00:02:28.660> now<00:02:28.750> we're<00:02:28.900> looking<00:02:29.019> at

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
just the camera and now we're looking at

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.420 
just the camera and now we're looking at
what<00:02:29.349> we<00:02:29.440> can<00:02:29.560> do<00:02:29.650> with<00:02:29.739> a<00:02:29.800> camera<00:02:30.069> combined

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
what we can do with a camera combined

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.580 
what we can do with a camera combined
with<00:02:30.580> the<00:02:30.670> controller<00:02:31.060> combine<00:02:31.900> that<00:02:31.930> with<00:02:32.110> 3d

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
with the controller combine that with 3d

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:34.530 
with the controller combine that with 3d
we<00:02:32.830> expect<00:02:33.160> to<00:02:33.190> see<00:02:33.250> even<00:02:33.610> more<00:02:33.790> possibilities

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
we expect to see even more possibilities

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.350 
we expect to see even more possibilities
so<00:02:35.110> by<00:02:35.620> studying<00:02:36.519> all<00:02:36.790> these<00:02:36.879> different<00:02:37.090> ways

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
so by studying all these different ways

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:39.030 
so by studying all these different ways
we<00:02:37.629> expect<00:02:37.959> that<00:02:38.080> we<00:02:38.140> can<00:02:38.290> create<00:02:38.470> even<00:02:38.800> better

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
we expect that we can create even better

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.790 
we expect that we can create even better
ways<00:02:39.250> in<00:02:39.430> the<00:02:39.489> future
