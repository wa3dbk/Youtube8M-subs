 Hi, this is his souza and this is one more 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.849
 life and 160 of multipoint with Christmas and 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.630
 new year for me is synonymous with food 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.279
 bittersweet 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.080
 usually at this time of year 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.910
 Heat then has nothing better than a 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.359
 creamy salad and full of flavor like 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.970
 That 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:28.320
 let's go to the great floods a cup of 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:31.949

 salt, parsley and pepper to taste 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.449
 before you get started you first need 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.730
 cook the chicken so I've cooked in 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.860
 normal panel only with water and if it 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.829
 big piece so do not stray 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.899
 to make second thigh filler 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.629
 step is to break the nuts is or not 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:06.270
 any one because it's supposed to give a 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:09.330
 detail a crunch but if you want 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:13.130

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.130

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.930

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.770

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:43.640
