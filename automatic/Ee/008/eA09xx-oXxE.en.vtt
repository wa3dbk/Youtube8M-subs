00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.810
 hello, it's summer 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:10.620
 sales and wolf decided to listen to the user 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:13.950
 but rather gamers though this is the same thing 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.929
 nevertheless they made the game pozhasta 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.160
 asked for the last time selling the game from 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:22.410
 you play the game 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.160
 in fact, this game has some 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.390
 events 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:30.480
 type there win 20,000 shipments 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.809
 today will open a new ski-doo 100 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.700
 the game 

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:37.770
 either he is the one or the other i honestly face 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.430
 quite understood well no no they are completely not 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:46.289
 what is important about this game 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:51.170
 actually this monster game monster itself 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:55.350
 arch in Russian translation translated as 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:59.719
 a monstrous game about how you click 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:03.899
 click on the monster click click and 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:05.400
 Type all need to flow no unnecessary 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.560
 with whom to compete questioning call out 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:11.400
 monster 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:15.570
 here is a click to very much and it is many 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.220
 push me for example but how come 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.350
 all this situation other people they just 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:25.950
 they just have the type of mouse there 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:27.750
 And photos from 7 budget mouse ska on 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.479
 which is of type like this 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.600
 turbo button that's so short she 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:35.310
 just you harvest and she calls out cracking 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.740
 liquid we can create macros easier 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.520
 In short, everyone uses shorter 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.520
 rule by this 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:50.990
 well if you are a person like you and me 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:52.640
 was it their family mouse she broke 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.860
 a month later thrown in the trash 

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:59.210
 returned to the old 100 rubles mouse 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:02:00.680
 who has been living for almost 10 years 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:02.870
 which is not of course these 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:09.710
 there are no macros on this button itself 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:11.720
 there is nothing to do well no matter 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:14.240
 In general, there are some options 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:17.540
 solutions to coal and I offer you my 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:22.010
 solution option is generally say so 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:24.020
 answer wife does not answer as if instead of steam 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.770
 discounts and wanted perry sting discounts but 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:32.600
 damn it kill me you are afraid to cut everything 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:33.320
 read this cut pro pro lightning 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.170
 discounts 

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:43.220
 what can there be in the game at 12 o'clock 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:48.380
 days for daily discounts yes too like that 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:49.880
 not really + pretty summer sale 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:54.050
 long will not last so much 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:54.739
 time to cut along so generally not 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:56.420
 options 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:59.780
 so I decided to fill this gap 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.790
 let's say so in summer sales here these 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:05.570
 vidos 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:08.510
 This utility I described probably 

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:11.180
 hour the funniest thing is that the meat itself 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:14.239
 that is something that she 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.680
 designed and wrote minutes 5 and here for 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:17.120
 to put it in order for 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:21.049
 to me for this video 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:24.680
 need somewhere but somewhere half an hour husband 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:27.290
 -45 only in general for quite a long time 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.930
 I did this in fact I'm here 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.000
 there is when you turn on you 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.660
 must hold the club because 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.150
 she right there 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:38.600
 on the spot on the spot 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:42.590
 eat your processor on and time 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:45.980
 the plague is why did I write it at all and 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:49.290
 just autoclick on the left mouse button 

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.880
 just here is nothing more here we see 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.640
 delay is naturally delayed in 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.260
 milliseconds after starting the program 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.150
 natural and this video delays 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.490
 milliseconds we can increase 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.440
 reduce unfortunately manually change 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:04.730
 this parameter could not be made 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:07.800
 so I made such buttons 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:10.440
 can increase decrease but less 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:12.840
 10 seconds you do not make a millisecond not 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:18.510
 do because the delay is too 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:21.510
 few why everything is very simple less than 10 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:23.669
 seconds is it even if you make a delay 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:28.410
 for example, do not delay at all 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:32.460
 for example, it will slow you down 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:33.660
 that you will be extremely hard for this 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:37.200
 program so I removed this 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:41.520
 possibility of installing 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:43.979
 delays less than 10 milliseconds 10 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:46.530
 milliseconds basically ok but with 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:49.830
 this already has problems 10 milliseconds 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:52.919
 quite a damn ok that's what 

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:54.390
 Generally a monster by the way now on 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:57.810
 run all the same game show 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:59.940
 demonstrate yet where to press first 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:01.260
 there is nothing natural about you 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:03.600
 it truly works 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:07.020
 live processor is not temporarily not working 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:08.910
 she just checks the button that you 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:13.870
 need to do to make this whole thing 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:18.760
 worked just press the b button 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:21.190
 English button b and which one more 

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.850
 well, or in Russian and in general it is 1 

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:25.480
 same 

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:29.470
 and large and I appear here 

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:34.390
 actually in the game yes i click 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:37.540
 you work with flour and here you are, well, I 

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:41.040
 died because all sanctuary upgrades 

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:45.160
 length 1 is unclear why natural 

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:47.050
 while 96 you threw me back 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:48.850
 gosh plaster do it at 30 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:50.740
 milliseconds principle everything will be 

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:52.240
 work more or less normal why and 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:55.150
 recommend 10 milliseconds 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:57.280
 because sooner or later steam in 

00:05:55.150 --> 00:05:58.710
 helper that is it is an internal browser 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:01.600
 if you set 10 milliseconds 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:06.550
 In short, where will you all poke so 

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:08.080
 quickly what gets into that helper style 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:09.250
 will just start to eat the drain 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:12.760
 random access memory 

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:16.090
 what about the result then i'm fast especially 

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:19.480
 quickly release them in short everything 

00:06:16.090 --> 00:06:22.570
 will hang on you have to load when 

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:24.310
 this one with him in the printer but this one 

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:27.910
 dying to the full yet 

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:30.100
 Here we press 30 milliseconds in principle from 

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:30.850
 you even more 9 I started almost took 

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:37.150
 buttons 

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:40.000
 rather, hands from everything, everything goes by itself 

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:42.850
 please all work would click all 

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.470
 back to square one would suggest all 

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:46.800
 go 

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:52.930
 extremely comfortable and saves your muscles on 

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:58.180
 fingers saves your money on the mouse and 

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:58.860
 all such and also deceives geiba such 

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:02.330
 here 

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:04.979
 cakes link to the sample is in the description 

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:09.389
 you can always like that download 

00:07:04.979 --> 00:07:12.379
 direct link everything is no problem 

00:07:09.389 --> 00:07:15.719
 also iâ€™m sure there is a pretty chunk 

00:07:12.379 --> 00:07:16.879
 counting from virustotal to all sorts of assholes 

00:07:15.719 --> 00:07:19.379
 didn't scream 

00:07:16.879 --> 00:07:22.259
 viruses are easier to harmonize if 

00:07:19.379 --> 00:07:25.259
 the video will become popular so try 

00:07:22.259 --> 00:07:31.400
 and take care of yours
