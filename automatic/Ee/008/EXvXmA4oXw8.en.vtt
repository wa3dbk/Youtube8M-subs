00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:06.009
 my name is genesis and today 

00:00:03.089 --> 00:00:08.760
 I will teach you the technique of graffiti 

00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:11.790
 nails with water 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.150
 for this technique we need water to 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.170
 temperature 

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:21.900
 wooden sticks 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:25.170
 and enamels and a tape and tape 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.660
 The first thing we do is paint the 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.759
 nails with a white base and surround those of 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.970
 the adhesive tape so they do not get damaged 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:35.480
 by inserting your finger into the water with the 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.480
 normal 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:44.829
 and then we take the drops of enamels 

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:48.430
 one by one one on the other to be able 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:50.100
 achieve a design 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:52.820
 in water 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.820
 all right 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.550
 i 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.829
 all right 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.140
 ah 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.700
 and 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:37.350
 yes 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.640
 the painting 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.640
 putting in the design that we want 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.369
 then we proceed to 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:13.950
 put the nail in the water 

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:15.959
 and when we take out the nail we will see that 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.650
 we will have to remove all the remains 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.650
 that are left 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:28.610
 so that they do not get damaged and that the style that 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.610
 we put him 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.349
 Y 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.010
 finish 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.730
 yes
