00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.770
 hello girls welcome to my channel my 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.810
 name is marta for those who do not 

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:16.940

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:18.560
 Monday and Thursday this time 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.500
 I bring a video of two treatments 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.630
 natural for our nails when 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.850
 we have our yellow nails and 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.920
 we have very brittle I hope that they 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:30.020
 help and let's start with the good pib 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.789
 girls for the first treatment when 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.699
 we have our yellow nails 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:39.110
 we're going to need half of a milk 

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:41.690
 lemon and something something like that to put 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.870
 can put your hand we will put the 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.870
 letter 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:51.670
 let's put half of the lemon what 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.670
 let's mix 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:59.390
 let's put our nails like this and 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:03.480
 we will have here 10 to 15 minutes 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:05.070
 We can do this 2 to 3 times 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.900
 week 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.520
 good girls remember that every time 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.190
 let's go paint our nails 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.040
 we must use a base to create a 

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:16.080
 layer between our nail and the enamel for 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.030
 that we do not get yellow air 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.850
 different brand I'm going to show you 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:25.520
 the ones that I have in which I use myself 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.520
 use these these two use this 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.710
 for the second treatment when 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.829
 we have our nails very brittle and 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.600
 we do not grow this treatment is something 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:40.049
 super easy what we are going to need 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.750
 because we all have it at home what 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:45.860
 first thing we're going to need is oil 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.860
 extra virgin olive 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:51.850
 a clove of garlic because this is the most 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:54.670
 great that me and I have but if it has 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.740
 one bigger one because it's better and a 

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.409
 little pot of these of the enamels 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:02.259
 so we can clean it we can do it 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:04.390
 with nail polish remover and what we're going to do 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:06.860
 First, split the garlic into pieces 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:10.000
 I would say in little 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.000
 that they remain like this 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.659
 and we will uncover the bottle 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.569
 let's put the we're going to put all 

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:20.939
 everyone in here I left them a little 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:23.189
 great but you can leave them 

00:02:20.939 --> 00:02:25.500
 a little bit smaller so that for 

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:28.500
 make it easier to put them 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.750
 here since we have garlic like this here in 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.140
 the bottle is going to put oil 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.140
 olive 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:44.240
 this is going to be stored in the fridge 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:47.480
 four days after those four days 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:50.750
 we're going to start using it no longer 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:53.260
 I'm going to smell so much down when 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.260
 we make 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:59.170
 we can use it 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:01.030
 and leave us 15 minutes or after 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:04.989
 that you have applied your enamel also what 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:06.639
