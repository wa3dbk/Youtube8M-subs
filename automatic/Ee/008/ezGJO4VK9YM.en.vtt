that<00:01:03.340> I'll<00:01:03.580> be<00:01:04.000> a<00:01:04.030> little<00:01:04.210> part<00:01:04.479> of<00:01:04.570> it<00:01:04.660> but<00:01:04.900> the

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
that I'll be a little part of it but the

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.500 
that I'll be a little part of it but the
what<00:01:06.220> I<00:01:06.250> got<00:01:06.430> the<00:01:06.610> last<00:01:06.790> couple<00:01:07.090> weeks<00:01:07.240> so<00:01:07.420> I'm

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:07.510 
what I got the last couple weeks so I'm

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:08.910 
what I got the last couple weeks so I'm
hoping<00:01:07.900> that's<00:01:08.140> not<00:01:08.290> the<00:01:08.530> case<00:01:08.710> and<00:01:08.830> I<00:01:08.890> don't

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
hoping that's not the case and I don't

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.710 
hoping that's not the case and I don't
think<00:01:09.190> it<00:01:09.280> will<00:01:09.400> be<00:01:09.580> because<00:01:09.910> I<00:01:10.180> was<00:01:10.330> a<00:01:10.360> look<00:01:10.570> I

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:10.720

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
never would have even imagined this you

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.260 
never would have even imagined this you

this perception that

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:16.980 
this perception that
