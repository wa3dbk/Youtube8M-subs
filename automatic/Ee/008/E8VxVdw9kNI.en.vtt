00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:13.740
 a boxing of a train model in the 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:16.890

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.920
 that comes with a cap to put it in the 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:23.760
 via or nail it with a screw that I already 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:27.720
 come here once this is going to start 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:30.060
 to open them anything that is 318 of renfe in 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:34.890
 the pretty old locomotive is was 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:41.219
 before an a319 to see renfe taxi 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:48.350
 renfe merchandise front altaria arch and 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:48.350
 is of the scale h 0 12 points 87 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.239
 germany 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.290
 so let's see it 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.980
 and let's open it 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.040
 two 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:19.330
 here we have it 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:22.580
 a in perfect condition at first hand if 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:25.190
 they had not said there was only one hand 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:28.030
 of first-hand second-hand but not like that 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.030
 let's get it out 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.690
 here we have 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:41.490
 318 is quite unique the truth is 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.060
 which has a good green-silver color and 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:48.020
 I want a design 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:56.210
 quite unique has enough lights 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:58.899
 lights 1 2 3 4 5 4 1 1 2 3 4 448 vale 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:01.510
 It also has a sound sensor 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:03.880
 accuracy of the buff 

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:06.530
 a sound sensor that we have here 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:11.200
 the wheels 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.200
 the doors that would not open will open 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:19.190
 the collectors or hooks and I 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:24.209
 I ask this what is it that is a buyer 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:28.580
 something bumps these would not be the buffers and 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:32.630
 back we have some and with the caps 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:35.290
 I mean these ceilings there are two types 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.290
 of buffers 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:42.459
 the caps 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:46.810
 and a whole screw that yes what 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:50.200
 we could nail in him there was except that 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:53.500
 here we have a kind of hole that 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.870
 we should cut a little bit we could 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.000
 cut around here but this is what 

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:02.650
 we will see in another moment and from the brand 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.569
 martÃ­n the good brand of buffers and it is very 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:08.310
 singular the truth is that here in a 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:08.310
 hospital in l'hospitalet station 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:14.330
 they already had it when they were still 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:18.020
 Talgo had not retreated but adif 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:20.569
 He said that because I renew 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:24.350
 the top is left, it was said that 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:28.580
 let us renew that they renew them as it happens in 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:33.350
 Plaza de Sants at its Molins station 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:36.350

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:47.860
 the edges madrid-atocha ferrol and a 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:47.860
 all is Spain all catalonia everything but 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:54.910
 Catalonia has two railway networks 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:59.300
 different is one is renfe and another would be 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:04:04.000
 rodalies of catalunya with those glories 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:06.860

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:10.040
 6 6 

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:13.220
 we go out there and good is advertising 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:17.140
 of this is that it has a fan a 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.140
 fan that when you turn it on 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:23.139
 well it works look gentlemen 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.960
 and there is also another curiosity that 

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:34.479
 here 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:36.200

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:38.510
 what he puts 

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:42.860
 it's not the unit but it's a 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:46.790
 curiosity that goes on tends to 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:48.620
 of this and if I can in another video that does not

 I will speak them but they will be 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:56.780
 moving in a few models will turn on 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:59.510
 this and the truth is that pretty cool and 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:02.360
 in other types of models to see this is 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:05.870
 a model then there are others that are the 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:09.050

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:11.090
 two east models and the yellow green no 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:12.260
 green green spot with stripes 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:16.090
