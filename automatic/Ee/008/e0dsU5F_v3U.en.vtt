routine and a very basic rule in fitness
and<00:02:27.950> bodybuilding<00:02:28.129> is<00:02:28.700> that<00:02:28.879> you<00:02:29.030> don't

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:29.269 
and bodybuilding is that you don't

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:31.360 
and bodybuilding is that you don't
workout<00:02:29.780> the<00:02:29.989> same<00:02:30.200> muscle<00:02:30.590> group<00:02:30.799> two<00:02:31.099> days

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
workout the same muscle group two days

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.240 
workout the same muscle group two days
in<00:02:31.640> a<00:02:31.819> row<00:02:31.849> and<00:02:32.299> if<00:02:32.870> possible<00:02:33.200> also<00:02:33.829> not

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
in a row and if possible also not

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.339 
in a row and if possible also not
indirectly<00:02:35.000> so<00:02:35.299> if<00:02:35.420> you<00:02:35.569> have<00:02:35.720> done<00:02:35.959> a<00:02:35.989> chest

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:36.349 
indirectly so if you have done a chest

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:38.710 
indirectly so if you have done a chest
workout<00:02:36.890> today<00:02:37.159> then<00:02:37.670> you<00:02:37.940> shouldn't<00:02:38.450> do<00:02:38.690> a

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
workout today then you shouldn't do a

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.160 
workout today then you shouldn't do a
triceps<00:02:39.560> workout<00:02:40.069> tomorrow<00:02:40.690> because<00:02:41.690> for

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:42.170 
triceps workout tomorrow because for

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:44.920 
triceps workout tomorrow because for
most<00:02:42.409> chest<00:02:42.829> exercises<00:02:43.459> you<00:02:43.970> also<00:02:44.209> use<00:02:44.900> your

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
most chest exercises you also use your

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.420 
most chest exercises you also use your
triceps<00:02:45.799> and<00:02:46.930> that<00:02:47.930> brings<00:02:48.200> me<00:02:48.379> to<00:02:48.650> step<00:02:48.709> four

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
triceps and that brings me to step four

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.089 
triceps and that brings me to step four
and<00:02:49.760> for<00:02:50.090> that<00:02:50.329> this<00:02:50.629> step<00:02:50.989> you<00:02:51.170> want<00:02:51.410> to<00:02:51.500> first

00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:52.099 
and for that this step you want to first

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:54.460 
and for that this step you want to first
of<00:02:52.250> all<00:02:52.370> know<00:02:52.430> what<00:02:52.910> your<00:02:53.120> goals<00:02:53.390> were<00:02:53.569> at<00:02:54.019> step

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
of all know what your goals were at step

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.430 
of all know what your goals were at step
one<00:02:54.859> because<00:02:55.129> this<00:02:55.819> indirectly<00:02:56.569> determines

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
one because this indirectly determines

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.190 
one because this indirectly determines
what<00:02:57.950> exercises<00:02:58.700> you<00:02:58.819> want<00:02:59.030> to<00:02:59.180> do<00:02:59.359> in<00:02:59.720> order

down the days that I can work out and

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.860 
down the days that I can work out and
then<00:04:18.349> determine<00:04:19.310> what<00:04:19.699> muscle<00:04:20.239> groups<00:04:20.479> I<00:04:20.630> work

out on what they and as you can see in

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.750 
out on what they and as you can see in
the<00:04:23.419> example<00:04:23.539> I<00:04:24.229> make<00:04:24.950> sure<00:04:25.219> that<00:04:25.460> I'd

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:25.760 
the example I make sure that I'd

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.330 
the example I make sure that I'd
to<00:04:25.970> work<00:04:26.120> out<00:04:26.360> the<00:04:26.690> same<00:04:26.900> muscle<00:04:27.290> group<00:04:27.950> two

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
to work out the same muscle group two

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.670 
to work out the same muscle group two
days<00:04:28.580> in<00:04:28.790> a<00:04:28.880> row<00:04:28.910> or<00:04:29.300> that<00:04:29.810> I<00:04:29.840> didn't<00:04:30.260> work<00:04:30.470> it

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
days in a row or that I didn't work it

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.880 
days in a row or that I didn't work it
out<00:04:30.800> indirectly<00:04:31.730> so<00:04:32.150> my<00:04:32.450> arms<00:04:32.780> workout<00:04:33.260> is<00:04:33.620> on

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:58.190 
you can see I already started with

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:01.570 
you can see I already started with
deciding<00:04:59.120> what<00:04:59.300> exercises<00:04:59.870> I<00:05:00.140> will<00:05:00.530> do<00:05:00.800> so<00:05:01.250> for

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.580 
deciding what exercises I will do so for

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.880 
deciding what exercises I will do so for
the<00:05:01.940> sets<00:05:02.240> and<00:05:02.510> reps<00:05:02.840> it<00:05:03.170> is<00:05:03.380> not<00:05:03.560> really

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:03.890 
the sets and reps it is not really

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:05.920 
the sets and reps it is not really
difficult<00:05:03.920> because<00:05:04.490> I<00:05:04.820> already<00:05:05.000> determined

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 
difficult because I already determined

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:08.290 
difficult because I already determined
how<00:05:06.170> many<00:05:06.380> sets<00:05:06.830> and<00:05:07.070> traps<00:05:07.310> I<00:05:07.460> would<00:05:07.670> be<00:05:07.850> doing

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:08.300 
how many sets and traps I would be doing

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.110 
how many sets and traps I would be doing
but<00:05:08.930> you<00:05:09.200> will<00:05:09.320> need<00:05:09.560> to<00:05:09.800> know<00:05:09.980> what<00:05:10.340> exercises

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.120 
but you will need to know what exercises

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.540 
but you will need to know what exercises
you<00:05:11.240> will<00:05:11.390> be<00:05:11.630> doing<00:05:12.080> so<00:05:12.440> for<00:05:13.040> that<00:05:13.220> it<00:05:13.400> is

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550 
you will be doing so for that it is

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.300 
you will be doing so for that it is
important<00:05:14.300> to<00:05:14.360> watch<00:05:14.660> different<00:05:14.990> videos<00:05:15.350> also

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310 
important to watch different videos also

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:18.640 
important to watch different videos also
from<00:05:16.640> other<00:05:16.880> people<00:05:17.450> to<00:05:17.690> see<00:05:17.900> what<00:05:18.110> exercises

like to do yourself
finally<00:05:23.330> Wednesday<00:05:23.810> workout<00:05:24.440> I<00:05:24.470> decided<00:05:25.070> to

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:25.340 
finally Wednesday workout I decided to

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:27.610 
finally Wednesday workout I decided to
combine<00:05:25.970> the<00:05:26.360> shoulders<00:05:26.810> and<00:05:27.140> the<00:05:27.440> ABS

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:27.620 
combine the shoulders and the ABS

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:30.610 
combine the shoulders and the ABS
because<00:05:28.280> those<00:05:28.760> don't<00:05:29.000> really<00:05:29.180> require<00:05:29.900> the

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:30.620 
because those don't really require the

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:32.860 
because those don't really require the
use<00:05:30.890> of<00:05:31.130> each<00:05:31.280> other<00:05:31.550> so<00:05:31.940> if<00:05:32.210> I<00:05:32.390> work<00:05:32.600> out<00:05:32.810> my

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:32.870 
use of each other so if I work out my

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:35.110 
use of each other so if I work out my
shoulders<00:05:33.560> I<00:05:33.740> don't<00:05:33.980> really<00:05:34.340> need<00:05:34.670> my

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:35.120 
shoulders I don't really need my

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.360 
shoulders I don't really need my
abdominals<00:05:35.870> that<00:05:36.080> much<00:05:36.290> and<00:05:36.680> if<00:05:36.800> I<00:05:36.950> work<00:05:37.160> out

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:37.370 
abdominals that much and if I work out

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:40.450 
abdominals that much and if I work out
my<00:05:37.430> abdominals<00:05:38.000> I<00:05:38.480> won't<00:05:38.840> be<00:05:39.260> tired<00:05:39.590> from<00:05:40.040> my

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:40.460 
my abdominals I won't be tired from my

Friday I didn't plan any workout so that

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:04.689 
Friday I didn't plan any workout so that
they<00:07:02.900> wouldn't<00:07:03.229> be<00:07:03.410> a<00:07:03.440> big<00:07:03.710> problem<00:07:04.310> for<00:07:04.370> me

00:07:04.689 --> 00:07:04.699 
they wouldn't be a big problem for me

00:07:04.699 --> 00:07:08.469 
they wouldn't be a big problem for me
although<00:07:05.449> on<00:07:06.080> Thursday<00:07:07.039> I<00:07:07.069> decided<00:07:08.000> to<00:07:08.270> work

00:07:08.469 --> 00:07:08.479 
although on Thursday I decided to work

00:07:08.479 --> 00:07:10.779 
although on Thursday I decided to work
had<00:07:08.720> my<00:07:08.930> arms<00:07:09.349> which<00:07:09.620> means<00:07:09.919> that<00:07:10.190> my<00:07:10.550> martial

00:07:10.779 --> 00:07:10.789 
had my arms which means that my martial

00:07:10.789 --> 00:07:12.969 
had my arms which means that my martial
arts<00:07:11.180> workout<00:07:11.840> might<00:07:12.199> be<00:07:12.409> a<00:07:12.440> little<00:07:12.740> bit

00:07:12.969 --> 00:07:12.979 
arts workout might be a little bit

00:07:12.979 --> 00:07:15.010 
arts workout might be a little bit
different<00:07:13.220> difficult<00:07:13.970> for<00:07:14.270> me<00:07:14.479> when<00:07:14.810> I<00:07:14.840> have

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:15.020 
different difficult for me when I have

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:17.350 
different difficult for me when I have
to<00:07:15.169> do<00:07:15.289> a<00:07:15.319> lot<00:07:15.530> of<00:07:15.560> punches<00:07:16.250> or<00:07:16.490> grappling<00:07:17.180> or

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:17.360 
to do a lot of punches or grappling or

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:19.240 
to do a lot of punches or grappling or
stuff<00:07:17.720> like<00:07:17.750> that<00:07:17.960> so<00:07:18.590> that<00:07:18.919> is<00:07:19.069> also

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:19.250 
stuff like that so that is also

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:22.629 
stuff like that so that is also
something<00:07:19.460> you<00:07:20.120> ask<00:07:20.330> new<00:07:20.509> consider<00:07:21.400> if<00:07:22.400> you

00:07:22.629 --> 00:07:22.639 
something you ask new consider if you

00:07:22.639 --> 00:07:24.490 
something you ask new consider if you
notice<00:07:23.000> that<00:07:23.030> it<00:07:23.300> is<00:07:23.419> too<00:07:23.690> difficult<00:07:24.259> or<00:07:24.440> too

00:07:24.490 --> 00:07:24.500 
notice that it is too difficult or too

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:26.320 
notice that it is too difficult or too
heavy<00:07:24.949> for<00:07:25.069> you<00:07:25.400> you<00:07:25.610> will<00:07:25.729> have<00:07:25.970> to<00:07:26.120> make<00:07:26.300> some

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:26.330 
heavy for you you will have to make some

00:07:26.330 --> 00:07:29.499 
heavy for you you will have to make some
adjustments<00:07:26.720> like<00:07:27.560> for<00:07:28.159> example<00:07:28.669> on<00:07:28.940> Saturday

00:07:29.499 --> 00:07:29.509 
adjustments like for example on Saturday

00:07:29.509 --> 00:07:31.930 
adjustments like for example on Saturday
I<00:07:29.539> decided<00:07:30.110> to<00:07:30.409> do<00:07:30.650> some<00:07:31.009> pull-ups<00:07:31.430> 10

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:31.940 
I decided to do some pull-ups 10

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:34.450 
I decided to do some pull-ups 10
repetitions<00:07:32.210> but<00:07:32.930> instead<00:07:33.319> I<00:07:33.380> would<00:07:33.740> do<00:07:33.919> the

00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:34.460 
repetitions but instead I would do the

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:37.120 
repetitions but instead I would do the
maximum<00:07:34.940> amount<00:07:35.180> of<00:07:35.389> repetitions<00:07:36.080> and<00:07:36.319> after

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:37.130 
maximum amount of repetitions and after

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:39.490 
maximum amount of repetitions and after
trying<00:07:37.520> out<00:07:37.759> the<00:07:38.030> abdominal<00:07:38.599> workout<00:07:39.110> routine

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:39.500 
trying out the abdominal workout routine

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:41.830 
trying out the abdominal workout routine
I<00:07:39.530> noticed<00:07:40.130> that<00:07:40.430> windshield<00:07:41.060> cleaners

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:41.840 
I noticed that windshield cleaners

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:44.950 
I noticed that windshield cleaners
should<00:07:42.259> be<00:07:42.500> performed<00:07:43.430> second<00:07:44.030> after<00:07:44.300> the

00:07:44.950 --> 00:07:44.960 
should be performed second after the

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:46.899 
should be performed second after the
weighted<00:07:45.440> crunch<00:07:45.800> otherwise<00:07:46.370> it<00:07:46.669> would<00:07:46.880> be

00:07:46.899 --> 00:07:46.909 
weighted crunch otherwise it would be

00:07:46.909 --> 00:07:49.330 
weighted crunch otherwise it would be
too<00:07:47.300> difficult<00:07:47.479> for<00:07:47.870> me<00:07:48.229> to<00:07:48.469> perform<00:07:48.889> the<00:07:49.159> the

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:49.340 
too difficult for me to perform the the

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:52.390 
too difficult for me to perform the the
