think that I would go

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.600 
think that I would go

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610 
go to that stage I think a bill words a

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.600 
go to that stage I think a bill words a
pretty<00:01:57.790> dope<00:01:57.970> idea<00:01:58.200> but<00:01:59.200> if<00:01:59.530> I<00:02:00.070> could<00:02:00.130> do<00:02:00.340> it<00:02:00.370> I

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
pretty dope idea but if I could do it I

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.640
