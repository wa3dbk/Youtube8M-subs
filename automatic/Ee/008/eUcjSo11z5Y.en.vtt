these snacks so if you don't have a
dehydrator<00:02:26.799> just<00:02:27.099> don't<00:02:27.340> add<00:02:27.579> any<00:02:28.000> water<00:02:28.269> and

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 
dehydrator just don't add any water and

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:30.149 
dehydrator just don't add any water and
we're<00:02:29.109> going<00:02:29.230> to<00:02:29.260> go<00:02:29.379> straight<00:02:29.620> into<00:02:29.799> the<00:02:29.889> next

00:02:30.149 --> 00:02:30.159 
we're going to go straight into the next

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:34.770 
we're going to go straight into the next
step<00:02:30.310> which<00:02:30.519> is<00:02:30.549> honey<00:02:31.859> so<00:02:32.859> now<00:02:33.120> I've<00:02:34.120> already

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
step which is honey so now I've already

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.440 
step which is honey so now I've already
mix<00:02:35.560> all<00:02:35.769> the<00:02:35.920> ingredients<00:02:35.950> together<00:02:36.730> for<00:02:37.359> the

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
mix all the ingredients together for the

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.959 
mix all the ingredients together for the
two<00:02:37.659> different<00:02:37.870> types<00:02:38.379> of<00:02:38.650> bars<00:02:39.459> that<00:02:39.790> we're

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:39.969 
two different types of bars that we're

00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:42.179 
two different types of bars that we're
making<00:02:40.120> or<00:02:40.659> balls<00:02:40.989> or<00:02:41.439> ever<00:02:41.680> they're<00:02:41.980> going<00:02:42.129> to

00:02:42.179 --> 00:02:42.189 
making or balls or ever they're going to

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:44.879 
making or balls or ever they're going to
turn<00:02:42.579> out<00:02:42.819> and<00:02:43.060> now<00:02:44.049> I'm<00:02:44.079> going<00:02:44.590> to<00:02:44.709> go<00:02:44.859> ahead

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:44.889 
turn out and now I'm going to go ahead

00:02:44.889 --> 00:02:50.940 
turn out and now I'm going to go ahead
and<00:02:45.340> add<00:02:45.459> honey<00:02:45.970> to<00:02:46.120> each<00:02:46.419> of<00:02:46.629> them<00:02:49.590> okay<00:02:50.590> so

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:50.950 
and add honey to each of them okay so

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:52.500 
and add honey to each of them okay so
you<00:02:51.010> can<00:02:51.099> see<00:02:51.459> what<00:02:51.700> we're<00:02:51.849> doing<00:02:52.150> here<00:02:52.329> now

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
you can see what we're doing here now

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.390 
you can see what we're doing here now
we've<00:02:53.260> already<00:02:53.530> mixed<00:02:53.950> all<00:02:54.159> of<00:02:54.189> our

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:54.400 
we've already mixed all of our

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:57.690 
we've already mixed all of our
ingredients<00:02:54.489> with<00:02:54.970> our<00:02:55.120> honey<00:02:56.219> included<00:02:57.219> and

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
ingredients with our honey included and

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.890 
ingredients with our honey included and
now<00:02:58.180> we're<00:02:58.569> just<00:02:58.599> placing<00:02:59.169> all<00:02:59.409> of<00:02:59.709> our<00:03:00.219> little

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
now we're just placing all of our little

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.729 
now we're just placing all of our little
patties<00:03:01.900> which<00:03:02.139> are<00:03:02.260> going<00:03:02.379> to<00:03:02.439> be<00:03:02.530> something

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:02.739 
patties which are going to be something

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:05.429 
patties which are going to be something
like<00:03:03.010> you<00:03:03.519> know<00:03:03.549> what<00:03:03.760> a<00:03:03.790> protein<00:03:04.209> bar<00:03:04.419> you<00:03:04.810> on

00:03:05.429 --> 00:03:05.439 
like you know what a protein bar you on

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:07.709 
like you know what a protein bar you on
2<00:03:05.829> r.d<00:03:05.980> hundred<00:03:06.400> I<00:03:06.519> guess<00:03:07.060> these<00:03:07.389> are<00:03:07.450> going<00:03:07.659> to

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:07.719 
2 r.d hundred I guess these are going to

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:10.679 
2 r.d hundred I guess these are going to
be<00:03:07.780> baked<00:03:08.169> ones<00:03:08.500> so<00:03:09.189> I<00:03:09.219> mean<00:03:09.579> not<00:03:10.120> baked<00:03:10.419> ones

00:03:10.679 --> 00:03:10.689 
be baked ones so I mean not baked ones

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:12.929 
be baked ones so I mean not baked ones
they're<00:03:11.139> dehydrated<00:03:11.560> ones<00:03:12.099> so<00:03:12.609> we're<00:03:12.790> leaving

00:03:12.929 --> 00:03:12.939 
they're dehydrated ones so we're leaving

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:14.610 
they're dehydrated ones so we're leaving
all<00:03:13.239> the<00:03:13.510> enzymes<00:03:13.870> intact<00:03:14.290> because<00:03:14.409> we're

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
all the enzymes intact because we're

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.319 
all the enzymes intact because we're
going<00:03:14.709> to<00:03:14.769> dehydrate<00:03:14.950> them<00:03:15.489> at<00:03:15.730> less<00:03:16.299> than

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:16.329 
going to dehydrate them at less than

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:20.189 
going to dehydrate them at less than
underneath<00:03:17.639> probably<00:03:18.639> about<00:03:18.790> 115<00:03:19.780> degrees

00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:20.199 
underneath probably about 115 degrees

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:25.319 
underneath probably about 115 degrees
and<00:03:22.019> we're<00:03:23.019> going<00:03:23.139> to<00:03:23.169> get<00:03:23.349> lots<00:03:24.099> of<00:03:24.329> benefit

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:25.329 
and we're going to get lots of benefit

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:28.500 
and we're going to get lots of benefit
from<00:03:25.569> doing<00:03:25.810> it<00:03:26.079> that<00:03:26.319> way<00:03:26.349> so<00:03:27.220> these<00:03:27.370> are<00:03:27.510> this

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
from doing it that way so these are this

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:33.000 
from doing it that way so these are this
is<00:03:28.780> how<00:03:29.260> these<00:03:30.220> patties<00:03:30.519> look<00:03:31.109> before<00:03:32.109> we

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
is how these patties look before we

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.099 
is how these patties look before we
dehydrate<00:03:33.760> them<00:03:34.269> you<00:03:34.479> probably<00:03:34.599> won't<00:03:35.049> be

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:35.109 
dehydrate them you probably won't be

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:37.619 
dehydrate them you probably won't be
able<00:03:35.139> to<00:03:35.349> see<00:03:35.439> a<00:03:35.470> big<00:03:35.889> difference<00:03:36.220> on<00:03:36.629> this

00:03:37.619 --> 00:03:37.629 
able to see a big difference on this

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:40.170 
able to see a big difference on this
camera<00:03:38.019> right<00:03:38.349> here<00:03:38.409> the<00:03:39.250> ingredients<00:03:39.579> are

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:13.419 
of using pecans and almonds we used

00:04:13.419 --> 00:04:16.259 
of using pecans and almonds we used
three<00:04:13.930> quarters<00:04:14.379> of<00:04:14.409> a<00:04:14.829> cup<00:04:14.859> of<00:04:15.069> cashews<00:04:15.970> and

three quarters of a cup of cashews and

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:21.449 
three quarters of a cup of cashews and
three<00:04:16.900> quarters<00:04:17.349> of<00:04:17.380> a<00:04:17.739> cup<00:04:17.769> of<00:04:18.099> coconut<00:04:20.459> so

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459 
three quarters of a cup of coconut so

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:24.760 
three quarters of a cup of coconut so
you<00:04:21.519> can<00:04:21.729> see<00:04:21.969> these<00:04:22.840> are<00:04:22.900> the<00:04:23.590> bars<00:04:23.860> that

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:24.770 
you can see these are the bars that

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:27.430 
you can see these are the bars that
not<00:04:25.069> made<00:04:25.430> with<00:04:25.849> water<00:04:26.300> so<00:04:27.050> you<00:04:27.080> don't<00:04:27.169> need

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
not made with water so you don't need

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:28.869 
not made with water so you don't need
the<00:04:27.530> water<00:04:27.710> and<00:04:28.190> these<00:04:28.400> ones<00:04:28.580> are<00:04:28.669> fast

00:04:28.869 --> 00:04:28.879 
the water and these ones are fast

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:30.129 
the water and these ones are fast
obviously<00:04:29.360> don't<00:04:29.509> have<00:04:29.569> to<00:04:29.720> wait<00:04:29.840> for<00:04:29.870> them<00:04:30.110> to

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:30.139 
obviously don't have to wait for them to

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:31.540 
obviously don't have to wait for them to
dehydrate<00:04:30.560> and<00:04:30.590> personally<00:04:31.190> I<00:04:31.220> think<00:04:31.280> they

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
dehydrate and personally I think they

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.760 
dehydrate and personally I think they
taste<00:04:31.759> better<00:04:32.090> this<00:04:32.599> way<00:04:32.840> and<00:04:33.169> they're

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
taste better this way and they're

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:35.350 
taste better this way and they're
storable<00:04:34.190> for<00:04:34.370> a<00:04:34.400> longer<00:04:34.580> because<00:04:35.090> they<00:04:35.210> have

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
storable for a longer because they have

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.930 
storable for a longer because they have
