00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
venice sights i'm not holding any of

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.270 
venice sights i'm not holding any of
their<00:01:33.960> sticks<00:01:34.229> for<00:01:34.439> the<00:01:34.470> recoil<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:35.100> a<00:01:35.159> fill

their sticks for the recoil and a fill

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.890 
their sticks for the recoil and a fill
out<00:01:35.520> but<00:01:35.670> you<00:01:35.759> can<00:01:35.909> get<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:36.240> idea<00:01:36.540> that<00:01:36.570> it

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
out but you can get the idea that it

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.319 
out but you can get the idea that it
borrows<00:01:37.799> it<00:01:37.950> a<00:01:37.979> really<00:01:38.310> good<00:01:38.460> speed<00:01:38.790> just

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
borrows it a really good speed just

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:40.819 
borrows it a really good speed just
apply<00:01:39.450> more<00:01:39.479> than<00:01:39.630> that<00:01:39.900> so<00:01:40.380> it<00:01:40.439> turns<00:01:40.650> it<00:01:40.799> from

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
apply more than that so it turns it from

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:42.710 
apply more than that so it turns it from
