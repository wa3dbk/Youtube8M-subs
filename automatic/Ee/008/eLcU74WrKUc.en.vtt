00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:01.830 
considering yesterday was all about our

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.370 
considering yesterday was all about our
grants<00:04:02.070> and<00:04:02.459> today<00:04:03.060> don't<00:04:03.720> know<00:04:03.840> where<00:04:04.080> they

didn't<00:04:04.590> even<00:04:04.650> get<00:04:04.830> a<00:04:04.860> podium<00:04:05.100> placing<00:04:05.730> so<00:04:05.970> I'm

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
didn't even get a podium placing so I'm

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.449 
didn't even get a podium placing so I'm
sure<00:04:06.720> they're<00:04:06.900> very<00:04:06.930> disappointed<00:04:07.680> but<00:04:08.400> I

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:08.459 
sure they're very disappointed but I

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:10.880 
sure they're very disappointed but I
mean<00:04:08.700> that's<00:04:09.450> the<00:04:09.540> way<00:04:09.660> race<00:04:09.840> and<00:04:10.020> goes<00:04:10.140> how

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
mean that's the way race and goes how

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.090 
mean that's the way race and goes how
would<00:04:11.010> you<00:04:11.040> sum<00:04:11.280> up<00:04:11.310> the<00:04:11.520> final<00:04:11.730> then<00:04:12.030> to<00:04:12.150> close

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:13.100 
would you sum up the final then to close

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:15.860 
would you sum up the final then to close
but<00:04:14.100> I<00:04:14.130> think<00:04:14.160> today<00:04:14.430> we<00:04:14.790> today<00:04:15.300> was<00:04:15.570> pretty

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
but I think today we today was pretty

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.050 
but I think today we today was pretty
spectacular<00:04:16.169> in<00:04:16.739> that<00:04:16.950> we<00:04:17.190> saw<00:04:17.520> in<00:04:17.970> the

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
spectacular in that we saw in the

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:22.279 
spectacular in that we saw in the
sammies<00:04:19.100> both<00:04:20.100> data<00:04:20.370> and<00:04:20.750> savoia<00:04:21.750> come<00:04:22.140> outta

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:22.289 
sammies both data and savoia come outta

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:23.990 
sammies both data and savoia come outta
nowhere<00:04:22.350> I<00:04:22.860> mean<00:04:23.340> they<00:04:23.460> were<00:04:23.550> expected<00:04:23.970> to

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:24.000 
nowhere I mean they were expected to

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.910 
nowhere I mean they were expected to
probably<00:04:24.330> make<00:04:24.419> it<00:04:24.450> true<00:04:24.660> the<00:04:24.840> final<00:04:25.260> but

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:25.920 
probably make it true the final but

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.490 
probably make it true the final but
I<00:04:25.980> mean<00:04:26.310> savoia<00:04:27.120> one<00:04:27.390> is<00:04:27.540> final<00:04:27.900> and<00:04:28.020> even<00:04:28.320> he

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
I mean savoia one is final and even he

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:29.870 
I mean savoia one is final and even he
ran<00:04:28.650> out<00:04:28.770> of<00:04:28.860> fuel<00:04:29.010> on<00:04:29.190> the<00:04:29.280> last<00:04:29.460> lap<00:04:29.640> he

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
ran out of fuel on the last lap he

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.310 
ran out of fuel on the last lap he
didn't<00:04:30.030> even<00:04:30.180> finish<00:04:30.330> it<00:04:30.570> so<00:04:31.020> I<00:04:31.050> was<00:04:31.200> pretty

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:31.320
