00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.880
 kids and remember v2 and good what 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.369
 promised is no debt and here I bring you 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.670
 that video where I'm going to draw coins 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:23.580
 for every player that touches me good of 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.859
 moment in this envelope touches me carrick and 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.510
 well what you are going to see is that in each 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.130
 about you have touched something to me 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.529
 edited I have removed all the straw because 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.930
 otherwise the video would last about 5 hours or 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.850
 betas altube hunton then what I have 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.890
 fact has been to take let's say the best 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:41.370
 moments where I have touched some 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.980
 player already from isa and I played carrick and in 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.809
 this envelope let's see what we get good 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.200
 then we get two players worth 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:51.989
 squares and linfield if a guy like that 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.059
 say that's good, we have three 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.070
 players for each 10,000 player 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:59.160
 coins so we're going 30 thousand coins 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:01.379
 I'm going to draw and I advance you to the 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.870

 crossing out and all that 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:18.600
 so it's good that you have to do 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.390
 to participate that I think I have not 

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:23.730

 leave the comment and you want but 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:35.370
 important to lay the video and then it 's 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:38.480
 search leave on the cover in my profile 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:41.370
 from twitter I'll leave a tweet where 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:44.489
 you will have to retweet 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.470
 So to make it easier and more 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:48.569
 clear so that everyone can see 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.920
 because it is random, it is worth to me 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:51.750
 it does not matter who wins wins 100 thousand coins 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:56.670
 I just want what I want 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:59.340
 participate and I already say this Friday 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:01.230
 this Friday will be at 11 in the best 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.930
 day of the week again 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.280
 we change the schedule at 10 but good 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.989
 how it matches the match 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.800
 Spain-Holland so that nobody can 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:11.560
 Lost the match 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:14.140
 and nobody miss the best of the week 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:18.250
 this Friday will be again at 11 o'clock 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:21.040
 is that after the live draw and nothing 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:22.930
 from that page that we have for everything 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:25.930
 the world that I made retweet aldridge 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:28.600
 So logically good, well, yes, 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:30.910
 will have a chance to win those 100,000 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:33.580
 coins so you could see them 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:36.670
 secular the video resurrected it to the tweet that 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:39.160
