00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.790
 good in this tutorial we're going to put two 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.529
 things the first is how to activate or 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.450
 disable any user and the 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.400
 second is how to change the password of 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.650
 any user but through this 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.360
 half the symbol of the system let's 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.240
 start by how to activate or deactivate 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.539
 any user to start we have 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:24.020
 that go start and here we write cmd and 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:26.690
 we press enter 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:29.180
 ok this is for versions of 

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:31.820
 windows seen onwards but for the 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.110
 versions of windows xp and earlier 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.880
 we have to let press the key 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.760
 windows of the keyboard that is the one that opens 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.500
 this bar and we press the key 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.559
 windows + r so that we do not open 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:45.260
 run here likewise we write cmd 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:48.620
 and we press accept as we have 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:50.059
 open the system symbol as 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.879
 can see this in the leo user 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:54.440
 I'm here in the leo user 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:56.660
 but I want to see what other accounts I have 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.390
 open I have on my computer for that 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.100
 let's write this command that is net 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:04.070
 and users that shows us all the 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.320
 users here we have user accounts 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.950
 from my computer that is lion we have 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:12.619
 guest administrator and I read in this 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.990
 case we get administrator guest and I read 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:16.009
 because it's in English but if you 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:18.740
 he has in Spanish he will leave 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:20.180
 guest administrator and read here 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.040
 all the accounts that you 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.470
 have if they have five accounts with Maria 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.090
 Juan Pancha will also leave those 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.770
 bills 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:30.740
 but in this case but I have the one of leo 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.909
 the administrator and the guest well here 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.280
 let's select the one that we 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:36.170
 we want to activate attractive in this case 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:40.939
 I'm going to section the administrator 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:44.959
 for that we're going to write net and usher and 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:48.130
 usher without sy and users like the name 

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:51.770
 that must be the same here 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:54.110
 administrator there is already that we have 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.700
 we press enter 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.460
 as you can see here it does not come out quite 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.630
 information about this user does not come out 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:02.150
 the name of the user that is 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.340
 administrator if the account is active or 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.410
 not in this case it is not active but the 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.179
 let's activate says the account 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.490
 never expires because he is an administrator and 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.290
 account is never expired in this case the 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:15.380
 last password change was on 12 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.570
 January 2013 at 3 50 p.m. component 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.209
 its seconds the contraction and it expires 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:22.280
 never in case we change it with 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:23.709
 required sign as well because if you need 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.990
 password to enter that user 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:28.640
 but we will change it right now 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.630
 nothing more late 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.880
 and good for 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:34.410
 to activate this user as they can 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:35.970
 see here I know it is not activated anymore what 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.250
 we saw right now to activate it 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:41.130
 we have to type this command another 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:42.600
 once we write net and usher and the user 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:46.350
 that you chose in my case 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:50.700
 discovered administrator administrator 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:55.440
 and here we go a bar then the ips and 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:57.980
 we wrote active active 2 active points 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.980
 two points 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:04.950
 and we wrote 10 to reactivate it activate 

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:06.720
 if we press enter those commands 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.550
 they have to be like that I care about science in 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.890
 English good computer student has 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:13.050
 to go active 2 points 10 can not go 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:16.380
 activate the points if it does not have to be 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:18.120
 in English active 2.10 good as can 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.220
 see leave the command has been completed 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:24.680
 correctly let's see if it's true 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.680
 again again let's type net 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:29.680
 usher 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:31.689
 administrator 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:35.170
 here is not going to leave all this and here 

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:36.819
 we see 50 active if you can see here 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:40.390
 after activating it says if it is 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:42.730
 active let's go up with him the key 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:45.849
 shown further back and active account 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:49.870
 that no but like here when we activate it says 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:53.200
 which is active active account yes good 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:57.609
 says that the contraction we change the 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:04:01.510
 12 in 2013 at 3 50 p.m. 36 seconds 

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:02.620
 let's change it let's move on to how 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.409
 change the condition of any 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:08.829
 user for that again we're going to 

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:11.319
 net and usher to see which users 

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:12.909
 we have as we have seen we have these three 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:14.290
 I'm going to betray him again 

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:15.509
 administrator who is the one I want 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:20.940
 change Password 

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:20.940
 let's see net and usher 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.300
 administrator and to walk with 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.889
 traction we have to give after 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.710
 write the user 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:31.360
 we give a space and we wanted 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:34.330
 compose is asterisk and we press 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.830
 enter as you can see says I write what 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.690
 they do not teach for the user 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:40.710
 here one writes whatever we want in this 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:43.840
 case I will write leo let's put leo 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:45.340
 and enter press enter again 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.910
 I'll write your acquaintance again 

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:50.199
 confirm we wrote them I read in this 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:51.850
 case you can not show here the 

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:53.430
 password because then it would be 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:56.790
 saying tÃ©lam 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:58.140

 the only ones who pay those who are 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:01.170
 writing there I know that I'm 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:03.330
 writing laws but if I am 

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:05.250
 saying since we have written the one 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:07.080
 it's not going to show but on the keyboard if 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:09.180
 it is being written we press people and 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.250
 afterwards -between them he has completed 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.740
 command correctly let's see if it is 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:15.840
 true here said that the password 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:18.660
 may change on January 12, 2013 to 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:22.760
