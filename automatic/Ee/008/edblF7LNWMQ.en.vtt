00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:13.680
 Y 

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:13.680
 and 

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:19.600
 I have been observing throughout my 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:21.970
 training how discrimination affects 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.700
 to people in the depths of their 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.260
 lives the motivation of the center 

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:28.600
 investigation must be peaceful for 

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:31.330
 investigate discrimination in the 

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:33.280
 Peru today is associated with our interest 

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.720
 historical in what are topics of 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.030
 social inclusion and equality of 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.350
 opportunities I think almost all or 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.850
 virtually all in Peru 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.790
 we would like there to be equality 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.379
 opportunities plenty of anecdotes from 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.449
 write action in this or that case 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:47.890
 mental current context but we do not have 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:50.220
 a quantification of the beauty of 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.220
 problem 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.460
 no more of the speculation there is no 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:58.050
 studies that show that for 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.590
 same positions and with the same 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:05.180
 qualifications or human capital 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.800
 women receive less money less 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.570
 income that males there are also 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.750
 some experimental works where we have 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.490
 sent rÃ©sumÃ©s and job notices 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.890
 with people with different names 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.619
 surnames photos if for example a 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.930
 person of last name clearly white 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:24.930
 You send ten CVs when you have 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.030
 success the labor market the person of 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.790
 Andean last name has to send 18 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.800
 resumes to have the same success 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:35.670
 we find in another in another chapter that 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:37.440
 minority ethnic groups have 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.910
 problems of access to services 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:45.360
 basic public are studies that we 

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:48.780
 they provide lights on what nobody wants 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:51.180
 know us what we wanted with 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.700
 these investigations is to call the 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.829
 attention of 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.380
 these problems still exist 

00:01:54.829 --> 00:02:03.289
 information to studies and conclusions 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:05.420
 which is very important to talk about the 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:08.360
 reality of Peruvians and the 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:11.470
 capacity that we have and the obligation 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.470
 we have to live better
