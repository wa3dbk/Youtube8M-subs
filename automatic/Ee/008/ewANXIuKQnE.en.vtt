00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
spiders right I'm not a scientist I'm

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.950 
spiders right I'm not a scientist I'm
sure<00:02:38.730> Stanley<00:02:39.090> wasn't<00:02:39.390> either<00:02:39.570> so<00:02:39.840> it's

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 
sure Stanley wasn't either so it's

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.600 
sure Stanley wasn't either so it's
probably<00:02:40.200> just<00:02:40.320> left<00:02:40.500> a<00:02:40.650> little<00:02:40.800> bit<00:02:41.040> but<00:02:41.190> so

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
probably just left a little bit but so

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:43.400 
probably just left a little bit but so
we<00:02:42.030> that<00:02:42.480> this<00:02:42.630> is<00:02:42.720> where<00:02:42.840> the<00:02:42.930> origin<00:02:43.230> story

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
we that this is where the origin story

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:44.900 
we that this is where the origin story
of<00:02:43.530> course<00:02:43.650> with<00:02:43.770> spider-man<00:02:44.010> comes<00:02:44.280> from<00:02:44.520> and

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
of course with spider-man comes from and

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:47.180 
of course with spider-man comes from and
it's<00:02:45.030> at<00:02:45.120> this<00:02:45.210> point<00:02:45.300> that<00:02:45.690> that<00:02:46.290> the<00:02:46.920> spider

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
it's at this point that that the spider

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.030 
it's at this point that that the spider
kind<00:02:47.490> of<00:02:47.670> comes<00:02:48.270> back<00:02:48.510> right<00:02:49.260> the<00:02:49.830> spider

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
kind of comes back right the spider

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.370 
kind of comes back right the spider
doesn't<00:02:50.190> die<00:02:50.459> spider<00:02:50.970> who's<00:02:51.270> back<00:02:51.570> yeah<00:02:51.870> beat

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
him run climb back in the turret right

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:55.040 
him run climb back in the turret right
exactly

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
exactly

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.300 
exactly
this<00:02:55.530> is<00:02:55.650> the<00:02:55.709> part<00:02:55.860> I<00:02:55.920> left<00:02:56.070> out<00:02:56.190> that's

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
this is the part I left out that's

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.800 
this is the part I left out that's
really<00:02:56.400> important<00:02:56.820> is<00:02:56.910> that<00:02:56.940> that<00:02:57.209> Peter

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
really important is that that Peter

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.420 
really important is that that Peter
doesn't<00:02:58.170> know<00:02:58.320> what<00:02:58.740> bit<00:02:58.920> him<00:02:58.980> he<00:02:59.100> has<00:02:59.220> this

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
doesn't know what bit him he has this

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:00.920 
doesn't know what bit him he has this
