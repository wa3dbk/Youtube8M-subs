the<00:00:03.689> major<00:00:03.929> nutrient<00:00:04.560> that<00:00:04.710> is<00:00:04.859> the<00:00:05.310> most

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
the major nutrient that is the most

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.000 
the major nutrient that is the most
deficient<00:00:06.509> of<00:00:06.660> any<00:00:06.960> all<00:00:07.259> across<00:00:07.680> the<00:00:07.859> country

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
deficient of any all across the country

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.490 
deficient of any all across the country

in corn soybeans and many other crops is

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.490 
in corn soybeans and many other crops is
not<00:00:10.650> nitrogen<00:00:11.250> it's<00:00:11.460> not<00:00:11.639> phosphorus<00:00:12.150> its

not nitrogen it's not phosphorus its
potassium<00:00:13.500> we've<00:00:13.740> conducted<00:00:14.070> some<00:00:14.340> major

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
potassium we've conducted some major

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.140 
potassium we've conducted some major
studies<00:00:15.269> in<00:00:15.540> 2004<00:00:16.440> and<00:00:16.650> in<00:00:16.800> 2008<00:00:17.580> really<00:00:18.029> to

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
studies in 2004 and in 2008 really to

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.939 
studies in 2004 and in 2008 really to
back<00:00:18.330> up<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:18.690> claim<00:00:18.930> that<00:00:18.960> Bryan's<00:00:19.529> making

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
back up the claim that Bryan's making

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.980 
back up the claim that Bryan's making
and<00:00:20.100> potassium<00:00:20.400> has<00:00:20.820> shown<00:00:21.029> up<00:00:21.180> to<00:00:21.359> be<00:00:21.539> the

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
and potassium has shown up to be the

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.109 
and potassium has shown up to be the
nutrient<00:00:22.470> that's<00:00:22.560> most<00:00:22.980> deficient<00:00:23.640> on<00:00:23.730> farms

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
nutrient that's most deficient on farms

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.400 
nutrient that's most deficient on farms
across<00:00:24.240> the<00:00:24.539> Western<00:00:24.840> Corn<00:00:25.109> Belt

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
across the Western Corn Belt

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.980 
across the Western Corn Belt
well<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:25.710> studies<00:00:26.010> we<00:00:26.189> ran<00:00:26.430> in<00:00:26.580> 2004<00:00:27.390> and<00:00:27.480> 2008

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
well the studies we ran in 2004 and 2008

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.050 
well the studies we ran in 2004 and 2008
were<00:00:28.199> in<00:00:28.349> corn<00:00:28.769> but<00:00:29.010> we<00:00:29.279> find<00:00:29.580> the<00:00:29.760> same<00:00:30.000> thing

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
were in corn but we find the same thing

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.540 
were in corn but we find the same thing
to<00:00:30.449> be<00:00:30.539> true<00:00:30.750> in<00:00:31.019> soybeans<00:00:31.590> wheat<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.399> many

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
to be true in soybeans wheat and many

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.549 
to be true in soybeans wheat and many
other<00:00:32.730> crops<00:00:33.000> too<00:00:33.329> a<00:00:33.540> lot<00:00:33.750> of<00:00:33.899> people<00:00:34.170> think

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
other crops too a lot of people think

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.319 
other crops too a lot of people think
that<00:00:34.770> just<00:00:35.219> because<00:00:35.340> there<00:00:35.820> is<00:00:35.940> potassium

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
that just because there is potassium

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.540 
that just because there is potassium
naturally<00:00:37.320> in<00:00:37.469> the<00:00:37.590> soil<00:00:37.620> that<00:00:38.370> oh<00:00:38.399> that

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
naturally in the soil that oh that

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.610 
naturally in the soil that oh that
should<00:00:39.090> get<00:00:39.270> into<00:00:39.510> our<00:00:39.660> plants<00:00:40.170> but

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
should get into our plants but

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.010 
should get into our plants but
unfortunately<00:00:41.520> it<00:00:41.820> just<00:00:41.910> doesn't<00:00:42.719> work<00:00:42.960> that

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
unfortunately it just doesn't work that

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.170 
unfortunately it just doesn't work that
way<00:00:43.469> I<00:00:43.500> mean<00:00:43.890> yes<00:00:44.100> some<00:00:44.399> of<00:00:44.520> it<00:00:44.670> does<00:00:44.820> get<00:00:45.030> into

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
way I mean yes some of it does get into

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.790 
way I mean yes some of it does get into
the<00:00:45.329> plants<00:00:45.629> I'm<00:00:45.750> not<00:00:45.899> saying<00:00:46.170> that<00:00:46.379> but<00:00:46.620> what

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
the plants I'm not saying that but what

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.560 
the plants I'm not saying that but what
I'm<00:00:46.950> saying<00:00:47.219> is<00:00:47.489> if<00:00:47.730> you<00:00:48.059> start<00:00:48.360> raising

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
I'm saying is if you start raising

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.170 
I'm saying is if you start raising
big-time<00:00:49.260> yields<00:00:49.920> you<00:00:50.219> need<00:00:50.399> a<00:00:50.430> lot<00:00:50.940> of

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
big-time yields you need a lot of

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.760 
big-time yields you need a lot of
potassium<00:00:51.449> getting<00:00:52.079> into<00:00:52.260> your<00:00:52.350> plant<00:00:52.620> and

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
potassium getting into your plant and

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:53.779 
potassium getting into your plant and
that's<00:00:53.010> what<00:00:53.160> we<00:00:53.280> wanted<00:00:53.520> to<00:00:53.579> talk<00:00:53.760> about

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
that's what we wanted to talk about

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.639 
that's what we wanted to talk about
today<00:00:54.300> let's<00:00:54.690> talk<00:00:54.899> about<00:00:54.960> this<00:00:55.289> because<00:00:55.469> you

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
today let's talk about this because you

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.830 
today let's talk about this because you
can<00:00:56.039> actually<00:00:56.309> see<00:00:56.550> potassium<00:00:57.270> deficiency

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
can actually see potassium deficiency

00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:59.840 
can actually see potassium deficiency
symptoms<00:00:58.050> right<00:00:58.590> now<00:00:58.800> in<00:00:59.039> corn<00:00:59.280> and<00:00:59.460> soybeans

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
symptoms right now in corn and soybeans

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.270 
symptoms right now in corn and soybeans
in<00:01:00.180> soybeans<00:01:00.780> for<00:01:01.020> example<00:01:01.530> we<00:01:01.620> just<00:01:01.649> saw<00:01:02.039> some

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
in soybeans for example we just saw some

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.189 
in soybeans for example we just saw some
soybeans<00:01:02.699> again<00:01:03.059> last<00:01:03.329> week<00:01:03.539> I<00:01:03.840> know<00:01:03.899> there's

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
soybeans again last week I know there's

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.780 
soybeans again last week I know there's
some<00:01:04.379> just<00:01:04.559> a<00:01:04.650> few<00:01:04.920> miles<00:01:05.100> up<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.369> road<00:01:05.519> from

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
some just a few miles up the road from

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.520 
some just a few miles up the road from
our<00:01:06.000> farm<00:01:06.330> as<00:01:06.479> well<00:01:06.510> where<00:01:07.170> we've<00:01:07.320> got

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
our farm as well where we've got

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.710 
our farm as well where we've got
yellowing<00:01:08.310> around<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.820> outside<00:01:09.299> edges<00:01:09.570> of

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
yellowing around the outside edges of

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.390 
yellowing around the outside edges of
the<00:01:09.930> leaves<00:01:10.140> if<00:01:10.439> you're<00:01:10.650> seeing<00:01:10.979> that<00:01:11.100> in

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
the leaves if you're seeing that in

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.550 
the leaves if you're seeing that in
soybeans<00:01:11.909> it<00:01:12.360> could<00:01:12.630> be<00:01:12.810> a<00:01:12.840> few<00:01:13.140> different

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
soybeans it could be a few different

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.890 
soybeans it could be a few different
things<00:01:13.710> but<00:01:14.130> one<00:01:14.490> of<00:01:14.520> them<00:01:14.880> that<00:01:15.270> it<00:01:15.420> probably

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
things but one of them that it probably

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.109 
things but one of them that it probably
is<00:01:16.080> is<00:01:16.380> potassium<00:01:17.070> deficiency<00:01:17.790> the<00:01:17.909> same

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
is is potassium deficiency the same

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.030 
is is potassium deficiency the same
thing<00:01:18.330> in<00:01:18.479> corn<00:01:18.810> it's<00:01:19.110> yellowing<00:01:19.680> on<00:01:19.830> the

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
thing in corn it's yellowing on the

it<00:01:37.020> is<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:37.320> you<00:01:37.590> can<00:01:37.770> see<00:01:38.159> a<00:01:38.189> nutrient

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
it is and you can see a nutrient

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.730 
it is and you can see a nutrient
deficiency<00:01:38.790> you've<00:01:39.630> already<00:01:39.840> lost<00:01:40.140> major

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740

yield probably 25 to 50% of your yield
is<00:01:43.979> already<00:01:44.399> gone<00:01:44.670> so<00:01:44.970> you<00:01:45.600> don't<00:01:45.750> want<00:01:45.990> to<00:01:46.079> let

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
is already gone so you don't want to let

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.780

it<00:01:46.229> get<00:01:46.439> that<00:01:46.619> far<00:01:46.680> for<00:01:47.280> sure

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
it get that far for sure

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.030 
it get that far for sure
but<00:01:48.000> how<00:01:48.420> do<00:01:48.479> you<00:01:48.659> know<00:01:48.810> if<00:01:48.960> you're<00:01:49.110> 10%<00:01:49.799> short

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
but how do you know if you're 10% short

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.980 
but how do you know if you're 10% short
of<00:01:50.159> potassium<00:01:50.700> or<00:01:50.820> 15%<00:01:51.210> how<00:01:51.750> are<00:01:51.810> you<00:01:51.869> gonna

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
of potassium or 15% how are you gonna

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.510 
of potassium or 15% how are you gonna
ever<00:01:52.140> figure<00:01:52.439> that<00:01:52.470> that's<00:01:52.770> not<00:01:53.009> gonna<00:01:53.250> show

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
ever figure that that's not gonna show

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.670 
ever figure that that's not gonna show
up<00:01:53.670> on<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:53.970> plant<00:01:54.240> until<00:01:54.720> you're<00:01:54.899> really

was last fall I expect it to continue

was last fall I expect it to continue
coming<00:03:11.769> down<00:03:11.920> nobody's<00:03:12.370> buying<00:03:12.610> it<00:03:12.790> at<00:03:12.910> these

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
coming down nobody's buying it at these

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.940 
coming down nobody's buying it at these
levels<00:03:13.300> so<00:03:14.080> you<00:03:14.410> know<00:03:14.530> if<00:03:14.590> we<00:03:14.680> can<00:03:14.860> get

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
levels so you know if we can get

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:18.270 
levels so you know if we can get

once again potassium is a major problem
on<00:03:37.000> farms<00:03:37.390> all<00:03:37.630> over<00:03:37.930> the<00:03:38.049> country<00:03:38.410> we're

on farms all over the country we're

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.620 
on farms all over the country we're
finding<00:03:39.010> that<00:03:39.190> usually<00:03:39.790> about<00:03:40.000> half<00:03:40.060> the

farms weren't on they have big-time
potassium<00:03:43.480> issues<00:03:43.750> take<00:03:44.170> a<00:03:44.200> look<00:03:44.440> on<00:03:44.530> your

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
potassium issues take a look on your

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:46.110 
potassium issues take a look on your
farm<00:03:44.980> the<00:03:45.190> biggest<00:03:45.549> thing<00:03:45.670> you<00:03:45.760> want<00:03:45.940> to<00:03:46.000> look

for<00:03:46.360> is<00:03:46.510> the<00:03:46.720> soil<00:03:46.989> test<00:03:47.260> if<00:03:47.500> your<00:03:47.650> bass

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:47.829 
for is the soil test if your bass

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:50.009 
for is the soil test if your bass
saturation<00:03:48.489> on<00:03:48.640> K<00:03:48.910> is<00:03:48.970> below<00:03:49.329> four<00:03:49.630> percent

saturation on K is below four percent

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:52.050 
saturation on K is below four percent
and<00:03:50.140> you<00:03:50.290> need<00:03:50.470> more<00:03:50.709> K<00:03:50.920> and<00:03:51.160> we<00:03:51.340> also<00:03:51.489> suggest

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
and you need more K and we also suggest

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:53.789 
and you need more K and we also suggest
you<00:03:52.180> do<00:03:52.299> plant<00:03:52.600> tissue<00:03:52.870> analysis<00:03:53.350> just<00:03:53.650> to

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:53.799 
you do plant tissue analysis just to

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:56.160 
you do plant tissue analysis just to
confirm<00:03:54.280> what<00:03:54.760> we<00:03:54.940> are<00:03:55.180> seeing<00:03:55.480> with<00:03:55.750> the<00:03:55.810> soil

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 
confirm what we are seeing with the soil

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:58.590 
confirm what we are seeing with the soil
test<00:03:56.470> well<00:03:56.950> fertility<00:03:57.370> is<00:03:57.700> one<00:03:57.910> big<00:03:58.120> issue<00:03:58.269> but

00:03:58.590 --> 00:03:58.600 
test well fertility is one big issue but

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.210 
test well fertility is one big issue but
so<00:03:58.840> is<00:03:58.989> weed<00:03:59.230> control<00:03:59.410> we'll<00:03:59.829> show<00:03:59.980> you<00:04:00.010> how<00:04:00.130> to

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
so is weed control we'll show you how to

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.009 
so is weed control we'll show you how to
control<00:04:00.610> our<00:04:00.790> wheat<00:04:01.030> of<00:04:01.150> the<00:04:01.209> week<00:04:01.360> coming<00:04:01.840> up

00:04:02.009 --> 00:04:02.019 
control our wheat of the week coming up

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:04.220 
control our wheat of the week coming up
next

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230
