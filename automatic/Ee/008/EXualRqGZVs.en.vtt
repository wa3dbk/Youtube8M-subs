we<00:01:28.550> obviously<00:01:28.790> have<00:01:29.180> seen<00:01:29.330> a<00:01:29.390> lot<00:01:29.720> of

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
we obviously have seen a lot of

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.180 
we obviously have seen a lot of
colleagues<00:01:30.020> before<00:01:30.380> this<00:01:30.680> I<00:01:30.830> believe<00:01:30.950> it<00:01:31.100> was

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:31.190 
colleagues before this I believe it was

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.700 
colleagues before this I believe it was
in<00:01:31.220> black<00:01:31.430> ops<00:01:31.670> 2<00:01:31.850> I<00:01:31.880> think<00:01:32.000> mw3<00:01:32.570> and<00:01:32.780> mw2

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
in black ops 2 I think mw3 and mw2

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.560 
in black ops 2 I think mw3 and mw2
at<00:01:34.280> least<00:01:34.430> there's<00:01:34.640> versions<00:01:35.000> of<00:01:35.150> the<00:01:35.240> vector

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
at least there's versions of the vector

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.780 
at least there's versions of the vector
and<00:01:35.840> you<00:01:36.680> know<00:01:36.800> it's<00:01:36.979> never<00:01:37.220> been<00:01:37.460> exactly

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:37.790 
and you know it's never been exactly

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:39.580 
and you know it's never been exactly
that<00:01:38.030> top<00:01:38.300> limit<00:01:38.570> its<00:01:38.810> bracket<00:01:39.080> I<00:01:39.260> think<00:01:39.470> this

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
that top limit its bracket I think this

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.290 
that top limit its bracket I think this
may<00:01:39.740> be<00:01:39.770> the<00:01:39.860> Call<00:01:40.130> of<00:01:40.159> Duty<00:01:40.460> that<00:01:40.610> is<00:01:40.880> at<00:01:41.150> its

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:41.300 
may be the Call of Duty that is at its

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
is an interesting weapon to try out at

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.140 
is an interesting weapon to try out at
least<00:02:33.270> now<00:02:33.930> let's<00:02:34.110> get<00:02:34.230> to<00:02:34.350> the<00:02:34.440> k7<00:02:35.340> it<00:02:35.520> has<00:02:36.000> an

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
least now let's get to the k7 it has an

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.700 
least now let's get to the k7 it has an
integrated<00:02:36.390> silencer<00:02:37.050> what<00:02:37.260> it<00:02:37.380> means<00:02:37.590> by

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
integrated silencer what it means by

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.080 
integrated silencer what it means by
integrate<00:02:38.070> is<00:02:38.190> that<00:02:38.430> there's<00:02:38.640> a<00:02:38.700> permanent

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
integrate is that there's a permanent

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:40.850 
integrate is that there's a permanent
silencer<00:02:39.420> on<00:02:39.600> there<00:02:39.870> does<00:02:40.260> not<00:02:40.470> count<00:02:40.710> as

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
silencer on there does not count as

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.050 
silencer on there does not count as
attachment<00:02:41.460> so<00:02:41.550> you<00:02:41.640> can<00:02:41.760> put<00:02:41.910> other

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
attachment so you can put other

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.730 
attachment so you can put other
attachments<00:02:42.570> on<00:02:42.690> it<00:02:42.840> so<00:02:43.080> say<00:02:43.350> if<00:02:43.410> you<00:02:43.590> only

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
attachments on it so say if you only

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.920 
attachments on it so say if you only
have<00:02:43.950> space<00:02:44.310> for<00:02:44.340> maybe<00:02:44.700> one<00:02:44.880> attachment<00:02:45.180> for

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
have space for maybe one attachment for

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.360 
have space for maybe one attachment for
your<00:02:46.170> submachine<00:02:47.070> gun

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
your submachine gun

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.370 
your submachine gun
the<00:02:47.700> silencer<00:02:48.300> will<00:02:48.480> not<00:02:48.690> count<00:02:48.960> because<00:02:49.230> it's

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
the silencer will not count because it's

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:50.960 
the silencer will not count because it's
already<00:02:49.590> on<00:02:49.740> it<00:02:49.920> and<00:02:50.040> you<00:02:50.100> cannot<00:02:50.370> take<00:02:50.580> it<00:02:50.730> off

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
already on it and you cannot take it off

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.820 
already on it and you cannot take it off
so<00:02:51.660> you<00:02:51.750> may<00:02:51.870> want<00:02:52.110> to<00:02:52.140> add<00:02:52.290> you<00:02:52.560> can<00:02:52.590> add

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.840 
very interesting weapon I just I think
it<00:03:10.440> looks<00:03:10.620> very<00:03:10.740> nice<00:03:10.980> in<00:03:11.190> this<00:03:11.280> gameplay<00:03:11.550> but

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
it looks very nice in this gameplay but

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.040 
it looks very nice in this gameplay but
I<00:03:11.910> just<00:03:12.150> don't<00:03:12.360> think<00:03:12.570> it's<00:03:12.660> gonna<00:03:12.780> be<00:03:12.900> one<00:03:13.020> of

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
I just don't think it's gonna be one of

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:14.870 
I just don't think it's gonna be one of
the<00:03:13.170> top<00:03:13.410> weapons<00:03:13.860> in<00:03:14.040> Call<00:03:14.190> of<00:03:14.250> Duty<00:03:14.580> ghosts

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
the top weapons in Call of Duty ghosts

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.640 
the top weapons in Call of Duty ghosts
you<00:03:15.750> know<00:03:15.870> I<00:03:15.900> think<00:03:16.170> there's<00:03:16.320> just<00:03:16.470> better

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
you know I think there's just better

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.190 
you know I think there's just better
submachine<00:03:17.310> guns<00:03:17.550> and<00:03:17.790> you<00:03:18.570> guys<00:03:18.780> will<00:03:19.050> find

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
submachine guns and you guys will find

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.600 
submachine guns and you guys will find
this<00:03:19.350> gameplay<00:03:19.590> to<00:03:19.800> be<00:03:19.920> very<00:03:20.100> interesting

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
this gameplay to be very interesting

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.130 
this gameplay to be very interesting
just<00:03:20.760> because<00:03:20.820> it<00:03:21.060> looks<00:03:21.270> very<00:03:21.360> powerful<00:03:21.690> it

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
just because it looks very powerful it

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:23.570 
just because it looks very powerful it
does<00:03:22.350> look<00:03:22.500> powerful<00:03:22.740> but<00:03:23.070> this<00:03:23.190> is<00:03:23.340> once

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
does look powerful but this is once

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:25.790 
does look powerful but this is once
again<00:03:23.670> I<00:03:23.790> guess<00:03:23.940> is<00:03:24.120> against<00:03:24.450> bots<00:03:24.750> and<00:03:24.990> I

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
again I guess is against bots and I

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:27.200 
again I guess is against bots and I
don't<00:03:26.460> think<00:03:26.640> we've<00:03:26.760> seen<00:03:26.790> a<00:03:27.000> lot<00:03:27.180> of

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:27.210 
don't think we've seen a lot of

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:29.510 
don't think we've seen a lot of
weaknesses<00:03:27.720> others<00:03:28.020> weapon<00:03:28.380> yet<00:03:28.650> but<00:03:29.340> we'll

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:29.520 
weaknesses others weapon yet but we'll

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:30.860 
weaknesses others weapon yet but we'll
have<00:03:29.640> to<00:03:29.760> see<00:03:29.940> but<00:03:29.970> I<00:03:30.150> don't<00:03:30.450> think<00:03:30.660> it's<00:03:30.750> going

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
have to see but I don't think it's going

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.060 
have to see but I don't think it's going
to<00:03:30.900> all<00:03:31.020> the<00:03:31.110> top<00:03:31.290> of<00:03:31.410> weapons<00:03:31.680> now<00:03:31.830> let's<00:03:31.980> get

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
to all the top of weapons now let's get

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.310 
to all the top of weapons now let's get
to<00:03:32.130> the<00:03:32.310> mtar<00:03:32.850> X<00:03:33.060> obviously<00:03:33.300> in<00:03:33.690> black<00:03:33.900> ops<00:03:34.140> 2

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
to the mtar X obviously in black ops 2

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:35.450 
to the mtar X obviously in black ops 2
we<00:03:34.410> thought<00:03:34.620> this<00:03:34.740> was<00:03:34.920> gonna<00:03:35.010> be<00:03:35.160> one<00:03:35.280> of<00:03:35.370> the

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:35.460 
we thought this was gonna be one of the

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:37.430 
we thought this was gonna be one of the
best<00:03:35.700> weapons<00:03:35.910> at<00:03:36.150> least<00:03:36.390> I<00:03:36.480> did<00:03:36.840> personally

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
best weapons at least I did personally

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.220 
best weapons at least I did personally
and<00:03:37.890> it<00:03:37.980> sadly<00:03:38.310> was<00:03:38.580> not<00:03:38.790> and<00:03:39.060> is<00:03:39.660> a<00:03:39.930> fully

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
mtar actually once again I am sadly

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.200 
mtar actually once again I am sadly
gonna<00:04:02.130> have<00:04:02.280> to<00:04:02.400> say<00:04:02.520> it's<00:04:02.700> gonna<00:04:02.790> be<00:04:02.880> one<00:04:03.120> of

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:03.210 
gonna have to say it's gonna be one of

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:04.760 
gonna have to say it's gonna be one of
the<00:04:03.270> best<00:04:03.420> I<00:04:03.630> think<00:04:03.660> it<00:04:04.080> is<00:04:04.230> gonna<00:04:04.440> be<00:04:04.560> one<00:04:04.680> of

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:04.770 
the best I think it is gonna be one of

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:07.130 
the best I think it is gonna be one of
the<00:04:04.830> best<00:04:05.480> for<00:04:06.480> a<00:04:06.510> submachine<00:04:06.930> gun<00:04:07.050> I<00:04:07.080> think

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
the best for a submachine gun I think

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:08.630 
the best for a submachine gun I think
this<00:04:07.350> is<00:04:07.410> gonna<00:04:07.500> be<00:04:07.590> the<00:04:07.800> best<00:04:07.920> range<00:04:08.250> weapon

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
this is gonna be the best range weapon

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.100 
this is gonna be the best range weapon
so<00:04:08.790> if<00:04:08.850> you're<00:04:09.000> on<00:04:09.210> one<00:04:09.390> of<00:04:09.450> those<00:04:09.570> bigger<00:04:09.840> Maps

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:10.110 
so if you're on one of those bigger Maps

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:11.720 
so if you're on one of those bigger Maps
I<00:04:10.260> think<00:04:10.500> you'll<00:04:10.590> be<00:04:10.680> able<00:04:10.860> to<00:04:10.950> use<00:04:11.130> this<00:04:11.280> a<00:04:11.520> lot

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
I think you'll be able to use this a lot

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.220 
I think you'll be able to use this a lot
better<00:04:12.060> than<00:04:12.210> some<00:04:12.480> of<00:04:12.570> the<00:04:12.630> other<00:04:12.810> weapons

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
better than some of the other weapons

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.220 
better than some of the other weapons
that<00:04:13.530> have<00:04:13.950> some<00:04:14.760> smaller<00:04:15.480> range<00:04:15.810> I<00:04:15.960> guess<00:04:16.109> you

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:16.230 
that have some smaller range I guess you

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:18.710 
that have some smaller range I guess you
could<00:04:16.350> say<00:04:16.380> but<00:04:17.090> mtar<00:04:18.090> X<00:04:18.270> it<00:04:18.390> looks<00:04:18.420> very

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720 
could say but mtar X it looks very

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.539 
could say but mtar X it looks very
impressive<00:04:19.350> so<00:04:19.590> far<00:04:19.620> but<00:04:20.130> anything<00:04:20.460> could

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
impressive so far but anything could

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:22.460 
impressive so far but anything could
change<00:04:20.760> with<00:04:20.880> a<00:04:20.940> patch<00:04:21.180> or<00:04:21.390> an<00:04:21.450> update<00:04:21.630> but

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:22.470 
change with a patch or an update but

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:23.810 
change with a patch or an update but
right<00:04:22.680> now<00:04:22.800> I<00:04:22.830> do<00:04:23.010> think<00:04:23.160> it's<00:04:23.460> going<00:04:23.610> to<00:04:23.700> on

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
right now I do think it's going to on

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:24.780 
right now I do think it's going to on
the<00:04:23.910> better<00:04:24.090> ones<00:04:24.360> but

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:24.790 
the better ones but

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:27.180 
the better ones but
submachine<00:04:25.420> guns<00:04:25.600> to<00:04:25.750> use<00:04:25.990> now<00:04:26.560> -<00:04:26.620> a<00:04:26.830> weapon

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:27.190 
submachine guns to use now - a weapon

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:28.620 
submachine guns to use now - a weapon
that<00:04:27.280> we<00:04:27.370> do<00:04:27.490> not<00:04:27.610> have<00:04:27.850> very<00:04:27.880> much<00:04:28.300> gameplay

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
that we do not have very much gameplay

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:30.600 
that we do not have very much gameplay
of<00:04:29.050> I<00:04:29.350> don't<00:04:29.680> think<00:04:30.010> we<00:04:30.070> actually<00:04:30.100> have<00:04:30.490> any

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 
of I don't think we actually have any

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.070 
of I don't think we actually have any
gameplay<00:04:30.850> at<00:04:31.120> all<00:04:31.270> we<00:04:31.630> just<00:04:31.810> have<00:04:31.930> some

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:32.080 
gameplay at all we just have some

EMS<00:05:26.170> is<00:05:26.380> very<00:05:26.680> impressive

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:27.700 
EMS is very impressive

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:29.970 
EMS is very impressive
it<00:05:27.910> looks<00:05:28.540> at<00:05:28.660> exactly<00:05:29.110> like<00:05:29.260> the<00:05:29.380> mp7<00:05:29.620> I

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:29.980 
it looks at exactly like the mp7 I

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:30.990 
it looks at exactly like the mp7 I
thought<00:05:30.190> it<00:05:30.280> would<00:05:30.400> be<00:05:30.520> like<00:05:30.670> one<00:05:30.850> of<00:05:30.880> the

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:31.000 
thought it would be like one of the

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.200 
thought it would be like one of the
black<00:05:31.210> ops<00:05:31.420> 1<00:05:31.990> submachine<00:05:32.680> guns<00:05:32.890> which<00:05:33.550> really

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.210 
black ops 1 submachine guns which really

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.300 
black ops 1 submachine guns which really
weren't<00:05:34.480> impressive<00:05:35.140> I<00:05:35.380> think<00:05:35.740> what<00:05:36.010> was<00:05:36.130> the

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:36.310 
weren't impressive I think what was the

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:38.970 
weren't impressive I think what was the
PM<00:05:36.550> 9<00:05:36.730> but<00:05:37.360> it<00:05:37.540> looks<00:05:37.780> a<00:05:37.900> lot<00:05:38.140> like<00:05:38.290> the<00:05:38.410> mp7<00:05:38.650> it

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:38.980 
PM 9 but it looks a lot like the mp7 it

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:40.740 
PM 9 but it looks a lot like the mp7 it
has<00:05:39.160> a<00:05:39.370> looks<00:05:39.850> like<00:05:39.970> the<00:05:40.090> bullet<00:05:40.270> damage<00:05:40.630> is

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:40.750 
has a looks like the bullet damage is

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:43.290 
has a looks like the bullet damage is
very<00:05:40.810> very<00:05:41.590> easy<00:05:41.770> to<00:05:41.920> kill<00:05:42.130> somebody<00:05:42.400> with<00:05:42.700> so

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:43.300 
very very easy to kill somebody with so

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:44.790 
very very easy to kill somebody with so
I<00:05:43.510> do<00:05:43.570> think<00:05:44.020> this<00:05:44.110> will<00:05:44.320> be<00:05:44.440> one<00:05:44.470> of<00:05:44.710> the

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:44.800 
I do think this will be one of the

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.500 
I do think this will be one of the
better<00:05:44.980> submachine<00:05:45.760> guns<00:05:45.940> and<00:05:46.060> college<00:05:46.360> ID

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:46.510 
better submachine guns and college ID

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:49.080 
better submachine guns and college ID
ghosts<00:05:46.840> even<00:05:47.500> the<00:05:47.650> I<00:05:47.680> die<00:05:48.370> something<00:05:48.820> tells<00:05:49.000> me

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:49.090 
ghosts even the I die something tells me

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:50.460 
ghosts even the I die something tells me
we're<00:05:49.270> gonna<00:05:49.360> see<00:05:49.570> a<00:05:49.600> patch<00:05:49.870> with<00:05:50.080> this<00:05:50.230> just

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:50.470 
we're gonna see a patch with this just

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:51.300 
we're gonna see a patch with this just
because<00:05:50.650> it<00:05:50.770> looks<00:05:50.800> a<00:05:51.070> little<00:05:51.160> bit

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:51.310 
because it looks a little bit

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:53.130 
because it looks a little bit
overpowered<00:05:51.910> it's<00:05:52.630> just<00:05:52.810> my<00:05:52.900> initial

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:53.140 
overpowered it's just my initial

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:55.920 
overpowered it's just my initial
reaction<00:05:53.520> but<00:05:54.520> the<00:05:54.640> CBJ<00:05:55.120> MS<00:05:55.390> I<00:05:55.510> think<00:05:55.750> that

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:55.930 
reaction but the CBJ MS I think that

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:57.450 
reaction but the CBJ MS I think that
could<00:05:56.080> be<00:05:56.110> the<00:05:56.290> surprise<00:05:56.590> weapon<00:05:57.190> of<00:05:57.280> Col

00:05:57.450 --> 00:05:57.460 
could be the surprise weapon of Col

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:59.010 
could be the surprise weapon of Col
Diego<00:05:57.760> so<00:05:57.880> you<00:05:57.970> see<00:05:58.120> a<00:05:58.150> lot<00:05:58.390> of<00:05:58.420> people<00:05:58.570> using

00:05:59.010 --> 00:05:59.020 
Diego so you see a lot of people using

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:01.770 
Diego so you see a lot of people using
now<00:05:59.830> guys<00:06:00.130> to<00:06:00.400> the<00:06:00.490> roundup<00:06:00.970> of<00:06:01.000> this<00:06:01.150> video<00:06:01.450> I

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:01.780 
now guys to the roundup of this video I

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:05.220 
now guys to the roundup of this video I
do<00:06:02.140> think<00:06:02.590> the<00:06:02.710> vector<00:06:03.100> CRB<00:06:03.480> will<00:06:04.480> be<00:06:04.660> the<00:06:04.870> best

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:05.230 
do think the vector CRB will be the best

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:07.170 
do think the vector CRB will be the best
submachine<00:06:05.920> gun<00:06:06.070> in<00:06:06.100> Call<00:06:06.520> of<00:06:06.550> Duty<00:06:06.910> ghosts

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:07.180 
submachine gun in Call of Duty ghosts

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:09.960 
submachine gun in Call of Duty ghosts
but<00:06:07.420> I<00:06:07.450> do<00:06:07.570> think<00:06:08.050> that<00:06:08.170> the<00:06:08.380> CB<00:06:08.740> JM<00:06:09.250> s<00:06:09.490> does

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:09.970 
but I do think that the CB JM s does

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:12.510 
but I do think that the CB JM s does
have<00:06:10.270> a<00:06:10.300> chance<00:06:10.840> of<00:06:11.200> holding<00:06:11.710> that<00:06:11.950> top<00:06:12.190> spot

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:12.520 
have a chance of holding that top spot

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:14.430 
have a chance of holding that top spot
as<00:06:12.730> this<00:06:12.940> best<00:06:13.270> submachine<00:06:13.900> gun<00:06:14.080> I<00:06:14.230> think

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:14.440 
as this best submachine gun I think

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:16.560 
as this best submachine gun I think
those<00:06:14.830> two<00:06:15.280> weapons<00:06:15.850> will<00:06:16.030> be<00:06:16.150> battling

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:16.570 
those two weapons will be battling

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:18.300 
those two weapons will be battling
against<00:06:16.960> each<00:06:17.050> other<00:06:17.290> kind<00:06:17.620> of<00:06:17.650> like<00:06:17.710> an<00:06:17.890> mw3

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:18.310 
against each other kind of like an mw3

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:21.360 
against each other kind of like an mw3
where<00:06:18.610> we<00:06:18.700> had<00:06:18.820> the<00:06:18.990> pp90m1<00:06:19.990> and<00:06:20.740> the<00:06:21.040> mp7

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:21.370 
where we had the pp90m1 and the mp7

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:23.040 
where we had the pp90m1 and the mp7
battling<00:06:22.030> against<00:06:22.330> each<00:06:22.390> other<00:06:22.630> I<00:06:22.690> think<00:06:22.810> that

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:23.050 
battling against each other I think that

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:24.600 
battling against each other I think that
we'll<00:06:23.140> be<00:06:23.290> seeing<00:06:23.500> the<00:06:23.770> these<00:06:24.220> two<00:06:24.460> weapons

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:24.610 
we'll be seeing the these two weapons

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:26.040 
we'll be seeing the these two weapons
battling<00:06:25.090> against<00:06:25.390> each<00:06:25.480> other<00:06:25.720> unless

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:26.050 
battling against each other unless

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:27.930 
battling against each other unless
there's<00:06:26.290> updates<00:06:26.710> and<00:06:26.860> patches<00:06:26.980> where<00:06:27.430> you

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:27.940 
there's updates and patches where you

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:29.340 
there's updates and patches where you
know<00:06:28.060> who<00:06:28.240> they<00:06:28.390> who<00:06:28.660> the<00:06:28.780> hell<00:06:28.900> knows<00:06:29.080> what's

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:29.350 
know who they who the hell knows what's

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:30.440 
know who they who the hell knows what's
gonna<00:06:29.470> happen<00:06:29.530> because<00:06:29.980> we<00:06:30.220> know<00:06:30.370> that

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:30.450 
gonna happen because we know that

00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:33.000 
gonna happen because we know that
activision<00:06:31.450> had<00:06:31.810> well<00:06:32.260> Activision<00:06:32.800> and

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:33.010 
activision had well Activision and

00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:34.770 
activision had well Activision and
Treyarch<00:06:33.340> had<00:06:33.760> their<00:06:33.910> little<00:06:34.150> thing<00:06:34.330> in<00:06:34.540> black

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:34.780 
Treyarch had their little thing in black

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:37.200 
Treyarch had their little thing in black
ops<00:06:35.020> 2<00:06:35.200> or<00:06:35.320> they<00:06:35.410> made<00:06:35.530> the<00:06:35.680> PDW<00:06:36.340> awful<00:06:36.880> I<00:06:37.030> mean

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:37.210 
ops 2 or they made the PDW awful I mean

00:06:37.210 --> 00:06:38.640 
ops 2 or they made the PDW awful I mean
day<00:06:37.600> 1<00:06:37.810> PDW

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:38.650 
day 1 PDW

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:40.560 
day 1 PDW
amazing<00:06:38.919> weapon<00:06:39.250> and<00:06:39.460> then<00:06:39.940> maybe<00:06:40.150> two<00:06:40.449> months

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:40.570 
amazing weapon and then maybe two months

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:42.900 
amazing weapon and then maybe two months
later<00:06:40.900> it<00:06:41.199> was<00:06:41.259> just<00:06:41.590> it<00:06:41.919> was<00:06:41.949> very<00:06:42.070> bad<00:06:42.550> it<00:06:42.790> was

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:42.910 
later it was just it was very bad it was

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:44.909 
later it was just it was very bad it was
probably<00:06:43.449> one<00:06:43.570> of<00:06:43.600> the<00:06:43.720> bottom<00:06:44.020> smg's<00:06:44.500> so

00:06:44.909 --> 00:06:44.919 
probably one of the bottom smg's so

00:06:44.919 --> 00:06:46.230 
probably one of the bottom smg's so
we'll<00:06:45.070> have<00:06:45.160> to<00:06:45.250> see<00:06:45.400> what<00:06:45.550> exactly<00:06:45.639> happens

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:46.240 
we'll have to see what exactly happens

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:47.820 
we'll have to see what exactly happens
with<00:06:46.360> patches<00:06:46.750> and<00:06:46.840> updates<00:06:46.990> but<00:06:47.320> the<00:06:47.470> initial

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:47.830 
with patches and updates but the initial

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:49.650 
with patches and updates but the initial
reaction<00:06:48.250> is<00:06:48.340> that<00:06:48.520> these<00:06:48.669> two<00:06:48.880> weapons<00:06:49.030> will

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:49.660 
reaction is that these two weapons will

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:50.850 
reaction is that these two weapons will
be<00:06:49.690> the<00:06:49.870> best<00:06:50.080> submachine<00:06:50.470> guns<00:06:50.620> on<00:06:50.740> the

00:06:50.850 --> 00:06:50.860 
be the best submachine guns on the

00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:52.770 
be the best submachine guns on the
flipside<00:06:51.370> what<00:06:51.970> is<00:06:52.060> gonna<00:06:52.180> be<00:06:52.270> the<00:06:52.360> worst

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:52.780 
flipside what is gonna be the worst

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:54.840 
flipside what is gonna be the worst
submachine<00:06:53.380> gun<00:06:53.590> I<00:06:53.770> think<00:06:54.220> that<00:06:54.370> the<00:06:54.520> Vepr

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:54.850 
submachine gun I think that the Vepr

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:56.279 
submachine gun I think that the Vepr
will<00:06:55.120> be<00:06:55.210> at<00:06:55.330> the<00:06:55.449> bottom<00:06:55.840> of<00:06:55.960> Call<00:06:56.169> of<00:06:56.199> Duty

00:06:56.279 --> 00:06:56.289 
will be at the bottom of Call of Duty

00:06:56.289 --> 00:06:57.960 
will be at the bottom of Call of Duty
ghosts<00:06:56.770> although<00:06:57.100> this<00:06:57.250> weapon<00:06:57.610> does<00:06:57.820> look

00:06:57.960 --> 00:06:57.970 
ghosts although this weapon does look

00:06:57.970 --> 00:06:59.670 
ghosts although this weapon does look
interesting<00:06:58.419> and<00:06:58.479> have<00:06:58.660> a<00:06:58.690> cod4<00:06:59.050> feeling

00:06:59.670 --> 00:06:59.680 
interesting and have a cod4 feeling

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.650 
interesting and have a cod4 feeling
towards<00:07:00.009> it<00:07:00.190> and<00:07:00.310> it<00:07:01.150> kind<00:07:01.419> of<00:07:01.509> looks

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:01.660 
towards it and it kind of looks

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:03.719 
towards it and it kind of looks
versatile<00:07:02.110> it<00:07:02.289> just<00:07:02.470> doesn't<00:07:02.889> really<00:07:03.039> have<00:07:03.610> as

00:07:03.719 --> 00:07:03.729 
versatile it just doesn't really have as

00:07:03.729 --> 00:07:05.189 
versatile it just doesn't really have as
much<00:07:03.910> power<00:07:04.270> as<00:07:04.360> the<00:07:04.539> other<00:07:04.660> submachine<00:07:05.110> gun

00:07:05.189 --> 00:07:05.199 
much power as the other submachine gun

00:07:05.199 --> 00:07:06.930 
much power as the other submachine gun
so<00:07:05.320> you<00:07:05.380> look<00:07:05.560> at<00:07:05.650> the<00:07:05.770> gameplay<00:07:06.009> it<00:07:06.729> just

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:06.940 
so you look at the gameplay it just

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:08.460 
so you look at the gameplay it just
looks<00:07:07.090> like<00:07:07.180> it<00:07:07.330> takes<00:07:07.479> more<00:07:07.750> bullets<00:07:08.139> to<00:07:08.320> do

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:08.470 
looks like it takes more bullets to do

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:10.680 
looks like it takes more bullets to do
damage<00:07:08.770> and<00:07:09.190> with<00:07:09.970> the<00:07:10.090> other<00:07:10.240> submachine

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:10.690 
damage and with the other submachine

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:11.969 
damage and with the other submachine
guns<00:07:10.870> you<00:07:10.960> saw<00:07:11.110> that<00:07:11.260> there<00:07:11.470> was<00:07:11.530> instant

00:07:11.969 --> 00:07:11.979 
guns you saw that there was instant

00:07:11.979 --> 00:07:13.650 
guns you saw that there was instant
kills<00:07:12.190> going<00:07:12.460> on<00:07:12.610> and<00:07:12.850> the<00:07:13.000> rate<00:07:13.180> of<00:07:13.210> fire<00:07:13.479> the

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:13.660 
kills going on and the rate of fire the

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:15.450 
kills going on and the rate of fire the
Vepr<00:07:13.810> looks<00:07:14.080> higher<00:07:14.320> than<00:07:14.560> the<00:07:14.650> others<00:07:14.949> and<00:07:15.310> I

00:07:15.450 --> 00:07:15.460 
Vepr looks higher than the others and I

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:16.800 
Vepr looks higher than the others and I
think<00:07:15.669> that's<00:07:15.820> gonna<00:07:15.970> be<00:07:16.030> the<00:07:16.150> main<00:07:16.389> problem

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:16.810 
think that's gonna be the main problem

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:19.050 
think that's gonna be the main problem
of<00:07:16.870> this<00:07:16.990> weapon<00:07:17.289> so<00:07:18.039> we'll<00:07:18.190> have<00:07:18.340> to<00:07:18.460> see<00:07:18.490> but

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:19.060 
of this weapon so we'll have to see but

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:20.730 
of this weapon so we'll have to see but
I<00:07:19.090> just<00:07:19.360> don't<00:07:19.539> see<00:07:19.780> it<00:07:19.870> as<00:07:19.990> being<00:07:20.020> the

00:07:20.730 --> 00:07:20.740 
I just don't see it as being the

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:22.409 
I just don't see it as being the
top-notch<00:07:21.160> weapon<00:07:21.550> that<00:07:21.669> it<00:07:21.820> could<00:07:22.030> have<00:07:22.150> been

00:07:22.409 --> 00:07:22.419 
top-notch weapon that it could have been

00:07:22.419 --> 00:07:25.170 
top-notch weapon that it could have been
so<00:07:23.110> in<00:07:23.979> my<00:07:24.160> opinion<00:07:24.550> that<00:07:24.580> is<00:07:24.789> gonna<00:07:24.880> be<00:07:25.060> the

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:25.180 
so in my opinion that is gonna be the

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:27.060 
so in my opinion that is gonna be the
worst<00:07:25.389> and<00:07:25.780> then<00:07:25.870> there's<00:07:26.020> also<00:07:26.260> the<00:07:26.919> other

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:27.070 
worst and then there's also the other

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:29.670 
worst and then there's also the other
weapons<00:07:27.430> like<00:07:27.550> the<00:07:27.669> k7<00:07:28.270> the<00:07:28.330> mtar<00:07:28.690> X<00:07:28.960> the<00:07:29.139> bazan

00:07:29.670 --> 00:07:29.680 
weapons like the k7 the mtar X the bazan

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:31.290 
weapons like the k7 the mtar X the bazan
those<00:07:30.010> are<00:07:30.190> toss-up<00:07:30.610> weapons<00:07:30.910> I<00:07:31.030> think<00:07:31.060> they

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:31.300 
those are toss-up weapons I think they

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:32.730 
those are toss-up weapons I think they
could<00:07:31.449> be<00:07:31.570> great<00:07:31.810> weapons<00:07:32.139> but<00:07:32.320> I<00:07:32.349> also<00:07:32.500> think

00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:32.740 
could be great weapons but I also think

00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:34.560 
could be great weapons but I also think
that<00:07:32.770> they<00:07:32.949> could<00:07:33.010> go<00:07:33.310> for<00:07:33.340> the<00:07:33.580> worst<00:07:33.789> but

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:34.570 
that they could go for the worst but

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:36.270 
that they could go for the worst but
anyway<00:07:34.900> guys<00:07:35.050> that<00:07:35.320> is<00:07:35.440> my<00:07:35.620> opinion<00:07:35.860> make<00:07:36.160> sure
