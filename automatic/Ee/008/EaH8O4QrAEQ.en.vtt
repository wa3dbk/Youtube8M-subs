00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:10.830
 soccer-second division red white Ahlen was finally able to win last weekend 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.879
 celebrate his first season home win 

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:17.480
 after the 1 0 success over Oberhausen much all participants red and white one 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.820
 whole rock wall from the heart 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.270
 even though the three points against taillight in the table always 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:23.490
 stronger 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.579
 secretary 

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:29.579
 hol 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.900
 this was confirmed by Captain Marcel Busch 

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:35.730
 Sfar 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.210
 a huge step and you could tell that everything was just about everyone comfort 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:43.210
 to have won once is a better mood in the cabin 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.620
 from a now initiated turn which the full-back but not 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.560
 speak 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.000
 I had started all the profit of the post office with the 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.100
 St Pauli performed poorly and delivered a first match 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.890
 Although we lost but it was really good and there you saw the 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.300
 Kaiserslautern to have been continued 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.250
 2 actually synonymous clear if they can retrieve this every week to have 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.810
 Sometime normal food what Countable is implemented 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.440
 and it's not just happy that it worked out that way now 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.770
 Share of recent success 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.970
 certainly have the winter entrances 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:17.570
 Goalkeeper Sascha Kirschstein 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.490
 is satisfied with them so far 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.680
 when natural before the wood 19 in Hama at home we German the last 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:24.500
 three games 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.430
 The bottom line is that percent demanded individual small improvements 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.520
 led lying because yours was so 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.770
 His goal has some of the photos who wins to fill his spirits 

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.840
 the hot additional offers Moria 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.610
 the only contender has suffered under the home win against Oberhausen 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.840
 because the lawn in the Wersestadion 

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.000
 after all, he can now rest for a week because red white Ahlen occurs 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.680
 next Monday at 1860 Munich in the alliance-arena 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.590
 Marcel Busch but he is quite optimistic 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:58.799
 mm 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.670
 he becomes the first major to percentage points 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.490
 Pauli win every game except for it 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.319
 certainly in the Allianz Arena to stand up rifle at home against Oberhausen 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:11.420
 but go there and hope that we have three points but then follow suit 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.629
 Gameplay will see if maybe only one but also 

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:15.910
 with us or we could win
