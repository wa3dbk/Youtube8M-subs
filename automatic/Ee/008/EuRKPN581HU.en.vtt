00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:06.390
 let's learn how to do now 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:08.569
 decoration in general with paper tubes 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.569
 hygienic 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:15.720
 way of decorating is very simple 

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:17.720
 a tube is crushed 

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:20.450
 until it is flat 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:26.950
 and then 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:26.950
 or using the rule and marking 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:33.440
 Well, no 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.440
 normal that are one centimeter 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.900
 one kilometer here we mark the 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:42.310
 centimeter also down here back 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.800
 until 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:46.150
 and we can cut them can be done with 

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.160
 rule or it can be done by cutting 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:51.650
 directly we are left 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.070
 these pieces that are the modules that 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:54.070
 We are going to use 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.750
 we start with the basic form if 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:05.199
 we started using glue is so 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:08.039
 simple as giving a little glue 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:08.039
 at the base 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.290
 go hitting 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.540
 another little 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:27.060
 so that we get to get 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:29.380
 Well with 7 or 8 modules something like that 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.480
 closes 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.420
 and it becomes you 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.250
 in our stars 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.080
 stars that then good can 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:42.140
 decorate it 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:45.310
 pressing for example like that with a bit of 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.850
 glue inside and squeezing 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.369
 he is giving 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.830
 different ways we can also 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.610
 get 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:02:00.740
 the star but instead of leaving it as 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:04.260
 was thus crushing the tips that 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:06.390
 it is more like that type flower 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:10.020
 and we do not want to use glue 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:12.810
 then we can intertwine the piece 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.160
 number one enters inside the piece 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.240
 number 2 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.450
 two 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:23.370
 Now let's say it's 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:26.819
 food for the piece number 3 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:29.560
 and finally the piece number 4 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:33.060
 3 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.060
 and it's food for the first 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:39.360
 we just have to throw 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:42.780
 of each of the pieces to have 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:45.360
 let's say the base star can be done 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.290
 with four good I'm going to close it 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.230
 completely 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:53.019
 although it is not necessary to close it 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.380
 they can make figures without this closing 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:57.319
 completely 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:59.569
 this would be a star 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:01.080
 with two closed stars we get 

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:03.450
 this 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:06.190
 shines because then I gave it here that 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:09.700
 it serves to stick 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:11.500
 without closing and using 6 you can 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:14.130
 get stars just as is 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.130
 hexagonal 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:21.830
 This is the same but closed 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.830
 I mean by squeezing the extremes 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:29.510
 to another 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.510
 it's the same but completely open 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:33.310
 this would be the process 

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.040
 then you can get things like that 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:46.099
 and then it depends on the imagination 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:48.580
 throwing a little bit of idea 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:48.580
 we would have 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:54.819
 piece like this 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:58.109
 to which we have introduced a necklace 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:58.109
 and taking it to the extreme 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.160
 giving it a little color
