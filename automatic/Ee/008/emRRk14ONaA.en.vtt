00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 hello everybody, I hope everything is fine 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.759
 with you 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:08.849
 Steve is a different climate and I will 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:12.420
 tell me why you will tell stories 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:17.420
 of my life go then already to remember of 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:20.520
 one on a day that arish and another 10 am 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.660
 which is what I do every day, and I 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.390
 I do not remember 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.630
 half an hour before picking up the 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:31.619
 I did not even read the alarm clock. 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:34.350
 normal hours, I fell asleep 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:38.100
 when the curve there already is just missing 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.899
 five minutes to catch the 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.829
 bus and 19 I got enough 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:46.140
 satisfied because I learned that 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:48.270
 I could be late and it's a 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.820
 discipline that today that they have this 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.789
 bar lobby was was i was very pleased 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.250
 So what goes in five minutes an hour? 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.340
 to take the bus travels along the 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:02.039
 I was very fashionable and I was very 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.409
 I woke up feeling much calmer and 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:07.770
 up to take advantage and color goal vehicle 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.990
 Beautiful red foot on the corner of the bed that 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.299
 by chance has she already does every day 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.390
 by chance I talk to every day have 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:20.130
 an approved standard on a bed corner 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.930
 to me to wake up is that it is to take care of it 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.640
 were it not the owner will be through the time 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.549
 already happened before 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.829
 so I'm very calm as I said a lot 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.720
 Calm down to this day it's calm and it was not so much 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:33.479
 yesterday took this sweater to 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.490
 otherwise it is that I was very 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.520
 satisfied, is she arriving late? 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.680
 when I called and it was because the 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.930
 time I had no longer gave 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.270
 to take breakfast and was made 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.409
 because because the naval already a few days ago 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:51.810
 and try to cut down on meals because a 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:54.420
 mechanism was that I was in a situation 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:58.200
 overweight and that I had to lose weight 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.030
 and notes the yo-yo year yeah pretty board 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.399
 and why I'm worth I was already 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:05.180
 I tried a few days ago to start my 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:09.950
 diet was the day the mayor 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:10.670
 get out there and ready to like it , I'm fine. 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.650
 House 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:17.540
 he estimates that in the quiet trial and 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:19.250
 and the collection is no coincidence that so that by 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.930
 Was it even fortunate that I think it is 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.920
 to stop the bus until 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:26.840
 past is the first goal even more is the 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.540
 my situation I already had probability 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.550
 being late is not and then 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.220
 I would change because I already passed 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:36.290
 is and still improved the situation and I 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:38.450
 so I had seven kilometers to 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:41.239
 walk on foot and it was even the port 

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:45.050
 because it was raining and I was 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:49.760
 so I started walking on the sidewalk is not 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:51.920
 I'm going out and I was not sure what it is 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.080
 so every year is a magistrate ready to 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:54.830
 road that is the lake in the year 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.670
 past 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:00.950
 the road is to come is not yet but when it is 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.290
 to have to be close to the bird 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:08.870
 road and starts to turn a slight curve 

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:10.730
 down is that sometimes even in the 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.170
 end up on this curve, you have to 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:15.830
 little figures want to drip water 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:19.780
 when it rains as needed 

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:22.310
 but in this area and had not had there 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:24.980
 water holes to drain 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:27.130
 The water would go there on this curve and 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:30.560
 even in the right strategy right moves 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:32.720
 approach the tour is to do if a 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.390
 slight curve down and water starts 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:38.900
 to assemble yours, and happened to the 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:41.420
 that what I really love and that even now 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:44.720
 Do you have any wishes to happen some time? 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:49.070
 that was is so I was going to pass and he 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:52.940
 do not pass it is not and was a car is and this 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:55.670
 this water is not ee pass and the brutal 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:59.420
 Look what you do not take a lot of fish in 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:01.730
 and is the tre-pa could have given a towel 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:04.040
 It's also for the full 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:06.079
 I found it fuller already, but it was already 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.390
 have burnt so much that a 

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:09.350
 towel but only met later at the time 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.590
 was wrong 

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:15.200
 so continue I read very well all 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:17.690
 wet is not only was so good by 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.610
 children themselves because I liked them 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:22.430
 by the same taste of the bar with water on top 

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:25.790
 how to have fantastic consequences 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:28.160
 I, for example, constitute, but not 

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:30.620
 was something very serious because there were 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.810
 I then went to the pharmacy to buy a bottle 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:34.160
 because I have always heard that the 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:37.160
 time heals everything 

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:39.620
 and it's been three weeks since I walked like this 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:42.080
 It was good finally getting to school. 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:44.630
 I was there running around knocking on the fla 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.820
 door and was the natural option asked me 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:48.350
 Who is right or late and I? 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:50.420
 naturally because these people 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:52.730
 I astonished her to be very understanding and 

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:54.050
 not have or lack and I then sit down 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:55.760
 attend class 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:57.890
 father I was even interesting it 

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:00.320
 It was so interesting, the interesting thing is 

00:04:57.890 --> 00:05:02.810
 that when I left the room without her having 

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:04.580
 past the kitchen also only had 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:08.260
 arrived and it was two minutes 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:11.390
 finish and I was half was it was a 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:17.570
 It was spectacular, it's what I saw. 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:20.090
 That morning was very good, that 's what I think 

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:25.880
 that's all you want more ? 

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:28.700
 videos within this genre is I recorded and 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:32.690
 I lived with her husband. 

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:36.200
 I can go there and get a home if you 

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:38.780
 want more videos of chandler uÃ© I 

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:40.640
 I can bring maggi this year and I hope 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:43.160
 that you have been holding the channel 

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:47.530
 which has very interesting things between 

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:50.810
 which no door will be well 

00:05:47.530 --> 00:06:00.669
 little greetings and kisses beach kisses 

00:05:50.810 --> 00:06:00.669
 arms to them and today 

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:04.500
 play her
