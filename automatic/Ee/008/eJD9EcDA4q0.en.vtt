you can do this very quickly like it is
in<00:01:11.470> the<00:01:11.500> in<00:01:12.220> the<00:01:12.400> tab<00:01:12.640> and<00:01:12.940> that's<00:01:13.630> a<00:01:13.840> grace

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080 
in the in the tab and that's a grace

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.620 

more<00:01:23.470> slowly

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.770 

okay<00:01:28.630> as<00:01:28.840> you<00:01:29.290> like<00:01:29.530> and<00:01:29.880> then<00:01:30.880> we<00:01:31.480> have<00:01:31.750> a

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
okay as you like and then we have a

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.440 
okay as you like and then we have a
measure<00:01:32.380> number<00:01:32.830> three<00:01:33.100> and<00:01:33.310> four<00:01:33.370> this<00:01:34.180> is<00:01:34.420> a

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
measure number three and four this is a

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.390 
measure number three and four this is a
very<00:01:35.040> useful<00:01:36.040> run<00:01:36.610> you<00:01:37.510> can<00:01:37.720> use<00:01:37.960> whenever<00:01:38.680> you

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:39.400 
very useful run you can use whenever you

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.830 
very useful run you can use whenever you
are<00:01:39.490> holding<00:01:39.880> a<00:01:40.060> G<00:01:40.270> chord<00:01:40.410> F<00:01:41.410> or<00:01:42.190> four<00:01:42.880> for<00:01:43.810> a

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
are holding a G chord F or four for a

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.630 
are holding a G chord F or four for a
few<00:01:44.080> measures<00:01:44.470> and<00:01:44.770> you're<00:01:45.040> not<00:01:45.220> moving<00:01:45.370> to

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
few measures and you're not moving to

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:51.020 
few measures and you're not moving to
another<00:01:46.030> chord<00:01:46.450> so<00:01:46.690> this<00:01:46.900> is<00:01:47.110> very<00:01:47.350> useful

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:55.580 

just<00:01:51.330> use<00:01:51.600> your<00:01:51.630> index

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.840 

okay<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.490> then<00:01:57.210> let's<00:01:57.390> keep<00:01:57.780> moving<00:01:58.579> then<00:01:59.579> we

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
okay and then let's keep moving then we

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.050 
okay and then let's keep moving then we
have<00:02:00.090> a<00:02:00.119> little<00:02:01.079> run<00:02:01.290> to<00:02:02.000> D<00:02:03.000> to<00:02:03.299> the<00:02:03.420> D<00:02:03.450> chord

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
have a little run to D to the D chord

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:15.790 
have a little run to D to the D chord
you're<00:02:06.060> just<00:02:06.299> using<00:02:06.539> the<00:02:06.840> index<00:02:07.320> finger<00:02:07.740> here

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.820 

and<00:02:15.980> this<00:02:16.760> and<00:02:17.060> this<00:02:17.540> is<00:02:17.600> kind<00:02:17.930> of<00:02:18.110> short-run

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:18.830 
and this and this is kind of short-run

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.810 
and this and this is kind of short-run
originals<00:02:20.500> okay<00:02:21.500> and<00:02:21.770> then<00:02:22.010> measure<00:02:22.340> number

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
originals okay and then measure number

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.240 
originals okay and then measure number
eight<00:02:23.060> we<00:02:23.570> have<00:02:23.780> a<00:02:23.810> longer<00:02:24.290> run<00:02:24.530> three<00:02:25.040> notes

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:25.250 
eight we have a longer run three notes

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:31.180 
eight we have a longer run three notes
run<00:02:27.340> the<00:02:28.340> fingering<00:02:28.850> is<00:02:29.060> that<00:02:29.810> is<00:02:30.080> this<00:02:30.740> run<00:02:31.040> is

run the fingering is that is this run is
taking<00:02:31.370> us<00:02:31.700> back<00:02:31.940> to<00:02:31.970> G<00:02:32.390> and<00:02:32.570> the<00:02:32.930> fingering<00:02:33.440> is

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
taking us back to G and the fingering is

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.460 
taking us back to G and the fingering is
open<00:02:34.850> index<00:02:35.840> middle<00:02:36.200> finger<00:02:36.430> middle<00:02:37.430> finger

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
open index middle finger middle finger

okay<00:02:39.470> sounds<00:02:39.710> like<00:02:39.830> this

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:42.520 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:47.080

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:51.180 
okay okay now we have another idea

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:54.610 
okay okay now we have another idea
over<00:02:52.079> the<00:02:52.260> G<00:02:52.439> chord<00:02:52.709> this<00:02:53.069> is<00:02:53.129> very<00:02:53.610> similar<00:02:53.970> to

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
over the G chord this is very similar to

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.699 
over the G chord this is very similar to
what<00:02:55.620> you<00:02:55.950> played<00:02:56.720> at<00:02:57.720> measure<00:02:58.079> three<00:02:58.560> and

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
what you played at measure three and

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.030 
what you played at measure three and
four<00:02:59.150> we<00:03:00.150> are<00:03:00.269> just<00:03:00.480> adding<00:03:00.780> hammer<00:03:01.349> ons<00:03:01.590> to<00:03:01.920> it

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
four we are just adding hammer ons to it

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:14.720 
four we are just adding hammer ons to it
so<00:03:05.299> so<00:03:06.299> we<00:03:06.420> can<00:03:06.629> either<00:03:06.959> go<00:03:07.290> like

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.980 

okay<00:03:15.330> then<00:03:15.540> we<00:03:15.690> have<00:03:15.840> a<00:03:15.870> C<00:03:16.140> card

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:17.990 
okay then we have a C card

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:22.990 
okay then we have a C card
and<00:03:18.950> this<00:03:19.850> is<00:03:20.030> a<00:03:20.060> very<00:03:20.450> very<00:03:21.080> nice<00:03:21.730> it<00:03:22.730> has<00:03:22.970> a

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
and this is a very very nice it has a

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:29.200 
and this is a very very nice it has a
rolling<00:03:23.630> effect<00:03:24.040> very<00:03:25.040> nice<00:03:25.310> better<00:03:27.970> so<00:03:28.970> make

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:29.210 
rolling effect very nice better so make

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
rolling effect very nice better so make
sure<00:03:29.240> that<00:03:29.600> you<00:03:30.440> have<00:03:30.680> a<00:03:30.710> base<00:03:31.040> strong<00:03:31.880> base<00:03:32.750> a

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
sure that you have a base strong base a

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.090 
sure that you have a base strong base a
little<00:03:33.860> upstroke<00:03:35.050> doesn't<00:03:36.050> matter<00:03:36.260> it<00:03:36.500> can<00:03:36.920> be

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100 
little upstroke doesn't matter it can be

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:39.370 
little upstroke doesn't matter it can be
either<00:03:37.490> the<00:03:37.850> third<00:03:38.150> or<00:03:38.510> the<00:03:38.570> fourth<00:03:39.020> string

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:39.380 
either the third or the fourth string

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.800 
either the third or the fourth string
that's<00:03:39.740> not<00:03:39.950> the<00:03:40.130> point<00:03:40.370> just<00:03:41.090> a<00:03:41.240> nap<00:03:41.480> struck

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:41.810

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.030 
that's not the point just a nap struck
and<00:03:42.260> anyway<00:03:43.040> base<00:03:43.880> up<00:03:44.330> strum<00:03:44.720> and<00:03:45.050> strum<00:03:45.110> down

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:46.040 
and anyway base up strum and strum down

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:46.980 
and anyway base up strum and strum down
up

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:46.990 
up

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:52.370 
up
so<00:03:47.990> again<00:03:48.440> slowly

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.840 

and<00:03:53.390> you<00:03:54.390> can<00:03:54.630> use<00:03:55.260> the<00:03:55.440> same<00:03:55.650> pattern<00:03:56.100> for<00:03:56.310> any

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
and you can use the same pattern for any

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.390 
and you can use the same pattern for any
chord<00:03:57.270> this<00:03:57.720> is<00:03:57.780> the<00:03:58.110> same<00:03:58.320> pattern<00:03:58.740> over<00:03:58.890> a<00:03:59.160> G

00:03:59.390 --> 00:03:59.400 
chord this is the same pattern over a G

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.470 
chord this is the same pattern over a G
chord

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:11.030 

over<00:04:05.200> D<00:04:05.440> chord

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:11.040 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.179 

okay<00:04:11.700> it's<00:04:12.420> a<00:04:12.510> very<00:04:12.540> nice<00:04:13.019> and<00:04:13.319> useful<00:04:13.500> pattern

00:04:14.179 --> 00:04:14.189 
okay it's a very nice and useful pattern

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:20.659 
okay it's a very nice and useful pattern
and<00:04:14.969> then<00:04:15.750> we<00:04:15.870> have<00:04:16.079> a<00:04:16.109> quick<00:04:16.530> run<00:04:17.070> to<00:04:17.430> D

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:24.850 

so<00:04:21.359> so<00:04:22.349> this<00:04:22.620> is<00:04:22.889> this<00:04:23.340> is<00:04:23.400> bringing<00:04:23.939> up<00:04:24.150> some

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
so so this is this is bringing up some

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.700 
so so this is this is bringing up some
variations<00:04:25.860> to<00:04:26.129> our<00:04:27.050> baselines<00:04:28.050> because

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:28.710 
variations to our baselines because

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.640 
variations to our baselines because
we've<00:04:29.069> been<00:04:29.310> using<00:04:29.610> quarter<00:04:30.599> notes<00:04:30.840> so<00:04:31.110> far

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
we've been using quarter notes so far

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.999 
we've been using quarter notes so far
and<00:04:32.689> to<00:04:33.689> play<00:04:33.900> the<00:04:34.110> bass<00:04:34.289> runs<00:04:34.590> and<00:04:34.830> now<00:04:34.949> we

00:04:34.999 --> 00:04:35.009 
and to play the bass runs and now we

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:41.150 
and to play the bass runs and now we
have<00:04:35.400> eighth<00:04:35.729> notes

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:41.160 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:46.430 

okay<00:04:42.160> and<00:04:42.340> then<00:04:42.520> for<00:04:42.970> the<00:04:43.150> for<00:04:43.540> the<00:04:43.630> decoy<00:04:44.190> lady

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
okay and then for the for the decoy lady

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:52.660 
okay and then for the for the decoy lady
and<00:04:46.680> I'm<00:04:46.890> using<00:04:47.130> my<00:04:47.370> thumb<00:04:47.670> here<00:04:48.210> and<00:04:49.520> the<00:04:50.520> last

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:52.670 
and I'm using my thumb here and the last

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:56.870 
and I'm using my thumb here and the last
and<00:04:53.670> the<00:04:54.170> last<00:04:55.170> run<00:04:55.500> is<00:04:55.800> called<00:04:56.100> G<00:04:56.400> running

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 
and the last run is called G running

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.500 
and the last run is called G running
this<00:04:57.030> is<00:04:57.270> the<00:04:57.420> most<00:04:57.660> famous<00:04:58.020> one<00:04:58.470> and<00:04:59.330> and<00:05:00.330> I'm

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:00.510 
this is the most famous one and and I'm

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:03.830 
this is the most famous one and and I'm
sure<00:05:00.720> that<00:05:00.930> you<00:05:01.350> heard<00:05:02.160> this<00:05:02.490> many<00:05:03.240> many<00:05:03.480> times

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:03.840 
sure that you heard this many many times

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:07.100 
sure that you heard this many many times
and<00:05:05.000> it's<00:05:06.000> a<00:05:06.120> little<00:05:06.330> bit<00:05:06.420> tricky<00:05:06.690> to<00:05:06.840> play

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110 
and it's a little bit tricky to play

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:12.230 
and it's a little bit tricky to play
correctly<00:05:07.590> so<00:05:08.190> so<00:05:09.120> here<00:05:10.110> we<00:05:10.290> have<00:05:10.530> a<00:05:11.240> hammer

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 
correctly so so here we have a hammer

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.870 
correctly so so here we have a hammer
round

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:13.880 
round

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.810 
round
okay<00:05:14.880> I'm<00:05:15.470> resting<00:05:16.470> my<00:05:16.500> pick<00:05:16.980> on<00:05:17.220> the<00:05:17.430> fourth

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:17.820 
okay I'm resting my pick on the fourth

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:22.120 
okay I'm resting my pick on the fourth
string<00:05:18.030> here<00:05:19.130> then<00:05:20.130> you<00:05:20.220> play<00:05:20.460> it<00:05:20.610> up<00:05:20.820> and<00:05:21.240> down

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:22.130 
string here then you play it up and down

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:25.220 
string here then you play it up and down
and<00:05:23.130> you<00:05:23.340> rest<00:05:23.670> your<00:05:24.120> string<00:05:24.480> on<00:05:24.690> the<00:05:24.960> 3rd

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:25.230 
and you rest your string on the 3rd

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:29.240 
and you rest your string on the 3rd
string<00:05:25.560> and<00:05:25.740> then<00:05:26.520> you<00:05:26.610> play<00:05:26.820> the<00:05:26.850> g<00:05:27.150> string<00:05:28.250> so

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.250 
string and then you play the g string so

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:35.240 
string and then you play the g string so
slowly<00:05:29.640> goes<00:05:30.000> like<00:05:30.240> this

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:35.250 

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:37.640 

okay<00:05:36.030> so<00:05:36.090> it's<00:05:36.420> a<00:05:36.540> little<00:05:36.750> bit<00:05:36.840> awkward<00:05:37.050> to

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:37.650 
okay so it's a little bit awkward to

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:41.600 
okay so it's a little bit awkward to
play<00:05:37.860> a<00:05:37.890> rest<00:05:38.310> stroke<00:05:39.290> and<00:05:40.290> then<00:05:40.890> you<00:05:41.190> have<00:05:41.430> to

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:41.610 
play a rest stroke and then you have to

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:43.740 
play a rest stroke and then you have to
play<00:05:41.850> a<00:05:41.880> nap

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:43.750 
play a nap

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:45.990 
play a nap
on<00:05:44.140> the<00:05:44.380> same<00:05:44.620> string<00:05:44.950> you<00:05:45.310> rest<00:05:45.670> on<00:05:45.880> the

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:46.000 
on the same string you rest on the

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.420 
on the same string you rest on the
fourth<00:05:46.240> string<00:05:46.540> and<00:05:47.110> then<00:05:47.650> you<00:05:47.770> play<00:05:47.950> enough

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:51.430 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:58.440 

so<00:05:52.060> this<00:05:52.210> is<00:05:52.389> up<00:05:52.540> to<00:05:52.570> speed

00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:58.450 

00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:01.140 

and<00:05:59.260> that's<00:05:59.470> the<00:05:59.710> G<00:05:59.920> R<00:05:59.950> and<00:06:00.190> the<00:06:00.310> famous<00:06:00.520> G<00:06:00.910> run

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:01.150 
and that's the G R and the famous G run

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:05.820 
and that's the G R and the famous G run
so<00:06:01.450> hope<00:06:02.230> you<00:06:02.440> like<00:06:03.090> this<00:06:04.090> lesson<00:06:04.440> for<00:06:05.440> rolling
