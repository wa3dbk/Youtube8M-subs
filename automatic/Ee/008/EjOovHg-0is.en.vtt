00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:18.330
 hello to all if florian for the site 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.860
 tahiti knows today we are 

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.160
 found to see how to add a 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:25.710
 user to every pc of the domain in 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.529
 as a local administrator so for 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.320
 so we will start from a server 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.480
 active directory already installed and a 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.540
 windows client 8 points to 32 bits and 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.040
 already integrated into this same domain 

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.930
 so the goal is to have a 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.690
 user who will automatically 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.750
 added as a local administrator 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:49.049
 of all the domain machine of course 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.400
 we can limit the impact by applying 

00:00:49.049 --> 00:00:52.769
 the group strategy that we will create 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:55.559
 only on some units in 

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:57.989
 of organization that allows to have a 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.220
 greater flexibility to still have 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.930
 greater flexibility 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.449
 we will rather than add a 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.460
 user automatically to the group 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.650
 local postal administrators 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.840
 customers recreate a group in 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.610
 the directory active directory and it is this 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.710
 group that we will add as 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.659
 as a local administrator of all 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.060
 machines like that if we want to add 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.940
 additional users who 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.860
 have to become local admin of all 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.870
 pc it will be enough to add in the night 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.970
 active directory the user in the 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:32.220
 group will gain flexibility 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:34.890
 so to get started 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:39.180
 so we will create on our activity 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:41.280
 rectorie in the egg administrators a 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.230
 new group that we want to name 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:49.000
 for example administrators 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:51.370
 local so all the users who 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.800
 will be put in this group will become 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:55.530
 automatically local admin of any 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:59.110
 the domain machine 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:01.780
 so we will add the forian user 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:07.590
 burnel which is for the moment the only 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:09.580
 who can become local admin that's ok 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.290
 so now we're going to tackle the 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.870
 creating a group strategy for 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.310
 deploy this configuration are 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.770
 automatically on all machines 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.140
 of the domain so for that it's very 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:21.790
 simple one opens the management console 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.780
 group strategies that you can 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.780
 find in the administration tools 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:36.600
 as part of this video i'm going 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:39.460
 for my part create a new gp object at 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.850
 I'm going to position it at the level of 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:41.410
 field 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:43.150
 so I'm going to right click on the 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.670
 domain created a gpu object in this 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.450
 domain and link it here I want to name 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:48.450
 administrator 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:55.300
 here you can very well added 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.410
 that includes in a train of doing at 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.100
 within a group strategy 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.040
 existing 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:03.940
 the goal is not to make a 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:06.280
 multitude of strategies for very few 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:11.200
 settings have cut a right click have 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:13.470
 does modify so this applies to 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.180
 level 2 the computer 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:17.680
 I unfolded it's a little bit 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:21.670
 applies at level 2 the computer 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:30.310
 then in settings policies 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:31.989
 windows security settings and group 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.500
 therefore restricted to groups 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:34.090
 restricted 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.730
 we will right click in the area 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:40.770
 right added a group 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.770
 and there we told the group 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.890
 this is this administrators group 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:53.270
 local 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:55.970
 ok so now we're going to add this 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:57.830
 group in a group 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:00.650
 so this group and member of 

00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:02.690
 administrators do not translate by the 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:05.480
 local administrators group in the domain 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:08.630
 active directory alti connect point 

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:11.210
 local and member of directors and 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:13.610
 administrator is a group 

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:15.620
 local on a machine we will do a 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:17.120
 added have it traveled because 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:20.239
 if we run it, it will propose us 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.200
 choosing a group that is so store 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:24.100
 in the directory while it's not 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:26.090
 our case so we'll grab it by hand 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.580
 administrators with an ace doing 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:31.580
 be careful with the spelling 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:33.800
 valid with oak is applied ok 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:36.290
 so that's the strategy she's 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:38.030
 finished you see it's very fast and 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:41.080
 very simple so now for 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:46.220
 check that it is well taken into account 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:50.090
 we just go on the machine 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:51.860
 client made an update of the 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:05:00.190
 Group Policy which is a gp update 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:05:00.190
 loose force this is how 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:08.470
 so here after a few seconds so 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:11.860
 the friend the group strategy this but 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:14.050
 well up to date on the client machine or what 

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:16.630
 now make a right click to wax 

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:19.150
 in the computer management see if 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:21.940
 the local administrators group the 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:25.450
 domain and well add in the group 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:27.040
 local administrator of the machine so 

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:29.260
 then on the left - of which 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:30.820
 the user and plots to the group 

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:32.680
 my double click on the group 

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:36.280
 administrator no who is the group 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:38.950
 local and there we have the pleasant surprise of 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:41.560
 regain our group and it is therefore 

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:43.030
 from the admin domain 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.710
 local so who is the group we 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:44.979
 that we defined in the strategy of the 

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:47.590
 group 

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:49.630
 so here you can be sure that all 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:51.669
 administrators group members 

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:54.010
 your domain will be 

00:05:51.669 --> 00:05:56.370
 automatically administrators 

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:56.370
 machinery 

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:02.200
 here you have seen it's a 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:03.810
 very fast configuration but who can 

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:06.729
 save you time and have a 

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:07.630
 a homogeneous configuration on your 

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:09.729
 IT infrastructure 

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:12.160
 after to you to see if you prefer 

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:14.830
 use a group or a user 

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:16.630
 it's as you wish but 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:18.130
 know that if you have questions 

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:20.169
 could very well deposit on our 

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:21.760
 forum leave us a comment on 

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:24.340
 on the video on youtube 

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:26.340
 Thank you 

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:26.340
