r-tx<00:00:44.070> in<00:00:44.430> the<00:00:44.520> FTX<00:00:45.059> before<00:00:45.870> that's<00:00:46.500> on<00:00:46.680> one<00:00:46.770> of

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
r-tx in the FTX before that's on one of

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.799 
r-tx in the FTX before that's on one of
my<00:00:46.980> other<00:00:47.100> videos<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:48.000> thing<00:00:48.210> was<00:00:48.329> so<00:00:48.480> bright

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
my other videos the thing was so bright

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.069 
my other videos the thing was so bright
it<00:00:49.020> bit<00:00:49.200> my<00:00:49.350> head<00:00:49.500> off<00:00:49.559> but<00:00:50.039> uh<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.750> guys<00:00:51.899> at

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
it bit my head off but uh the guys at

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.990 
it bit my head off but uh the guys at
EMG<00:00:52.440> told<00:00:52.680> me<00:00:52.739> to<00:00:52.860> try<00:00:53.070> these<00:00:53.370> this<00:00:53.699> is<00:00:53.879> the

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
EMG told me to try these this is the

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.850 
EMG told me to try these this is the
original<00:00:54.510> they're<00:00:55.140> supposed<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.500> be<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:55.649> lot

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
original they're supposed to be a lot

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.849 
original they're supposed to be a lot
smoother<00:00:56.340> I<00:00:56.780> got<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.930> ivory<00:00:58.109> thinking<00:00:58.739> it'd

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
smoother I got the ivory thinking it'd

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.349 
smoother I got the ivory thinking it'd
be<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.100> coolest<00:00:59.430> thing<00:00:59.640> in<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.760> world<00:01:00.030> but

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
be the coolest thing in the world but

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.660 
be the coolest thing in the world but
it's<00:01:01.289> kind<00:01:01.530> of<00:01:01.590> hard<00:01:01.649> to<00:01:01.859> match<00:01:02.100> up<00:01:02.430> when<00:01:02.640> you

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
it's kind of hard to match up when you

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.100 
it's kind of hard to match up when you
get<00:01:02.850> off<00:01:02.969> the<00:01:03.149> beaten<00:01:03.300> path<00:01:03.449> with<00:01:03.870> color

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
get off the beaten path with color

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.890 
get off the beaten path with color
although<00:01:04.589> it<00:01:04.769> looks<00:01:04.920> good<00:01:05.070> with<00:01:05.220> that<00:01:05.369> black

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:05.900 
although it looks good with that black

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.710 
although it looks good with that black
that<00:01:06.900> looks<00:01:07.020> pretty<00:01:07.229> cool<00:01:08.150> and<00:01:09.150> then<00:01:09.390> I've<00:01:09.510> got

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
that looks pretty cool and then I've got

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.630 
that looks pretty cool and then I've got
the<00:01:09.900> stock<00:01:10.140> bridge<00:01:10.439> but<00:01:10.740> I<00:01:10.770> put<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.070> Wilkinson

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
the stock bridge but I put the Wilkinson

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.440 
the stock bridge but I put the Wilkinson
saddles<00:01:12.119> on<00:01:12.330> it<00:01:13.159> those<00:01:14.159> big<00:01:14.549> barrel<00:01:15.150> brass

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
saddles on it those big barrel brass

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.480 
saddles on it those big barrel brass
saddles<00:01:16.049> I've<00:01:16.380> had<00:01:16.619> these<00:01:16.770> before<00:01:16.830> I<00:01:17.250> think

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
saddles I've had these before I think

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.130 
saddles I've had these before I think
these<00:01:17.729> are<00:01:17.790> great<00:01:18.000> saddles<00:01:18.600> I<00:01:18.750> like<00:01:18.990> them

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
these are great saddles I like them

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.690 
these are great saddles I like them
better<00:01:19.259> than<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.619> Barden's<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:20.280> they're

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
better than the Barden's and they're

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.179 
better than the Barden's and they're
cheaper<00:01:21.150> because<00:01:21.960> Wilkinson<00:01:22.650> doesn't<00:01:22.979> really

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
cheaper because Wilkinson doesn't really

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.649 
cheaper because Wilkinson doesn't really
sell<00:01:23.520> that<00:01:23.549> well<00:01:23.909> on<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.150> Internet<00:01:24.509> you<00:01:24.630> can

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
sell that well on the Internet you can

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.320 
sell that well on the Internet you can
get<00:01:24.900> these<00:01:25.020> cheap

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
get these cheap

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.020 
get these cheap
so<00:01:26.990> it's<00:01:27.110> just<00:01:27.230> the<00:01:27.410> stock<00:01:27.760> ashtray<00:01:28.760> bridge

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
so it's just the stock ashtray bridge

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.920 
so it's just the stock ashtray bridge
with<00:01:29.270> the<00:01:29.390> four<00:01:29.630> brass<00:01:29.930> tally<00:01:31.600> and<00:01:32.600> of<00:01:32.750> course

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
with the four brass tally and of course

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.470 
with the four brass tally and of course
EMG<00:01:33.470> I<00:01:33.740> get<00:01:34.490> a<00:01:34.550> brand<00:01:34.790> new<00:01:34.880> 5<00:01:35.210> way<00:01:35.450> switch

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:35.480 
EMG I get a brand new 5 way switch

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:40.390 
EMG I get a brand new 5 way switch
that'll<00:01:36.020> work<00:01:36.200> I<00:01:36.910> have<00:01:37.910> all<00:01:38.060> the<00:01:38.180> wires<00:01:39.400> I've

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 
that'll work I have all the wires I've

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.020 
that'll work I have all the wires I've
got<00:01:40.640> two<00:01:41.080> really<00:01:42.080> good<00:01:42.290> quality<00:01:42.730> 25k<00:01:43.730> pots

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:44.030 
got two really good quality 25k pots

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.270 
got two really good quality 25k pots
they<00:01:44.360> even<00:01:44.600> give<00:01:44.750> you<00:01:44.870> a<00:01:44.900> solid<00:01:45.350> shaft<00:01:45.590> so<00:01:46.220> you

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
they even give you a solid shaft so you

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.490 
they even give you a solid shaft so you
can<00:01:46.490> use<00:01:46.640> your<00:01:46.790> dome<00:01:47.030> knobs<00:01:47.300> on<00:01:47.570> there<00:01:47.870> without

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 
can use your dome knobs on there without

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.250 
can use your dome knobs on there without
them<00:01:48.830> being<00:01:48.980> crooked<00:01:49.490> and<00:01:50.000> I'm<00:01:50.870> kind<00:01:51.110> of<00:01:51.200> just

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:51.260 
them being crooked and I'm kind of just

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.590 
them being crooked and I'm kind of just
using<00:01:51.560> spare<00:01:51.890> parts<00:01:52.280> so<00:01:52.460> I<00:01:52.490> pulled<00:01:53.210> out<00:01:53.330> this

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
using spare parts so I pulled out this

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.700 
using spare parts so I pulled out this
gold<00:01:54.340> this<00:01:55.340> is<00:01:55.400> actually<00:01:55.940> brass<00:01:56.470> that's<00:01:57.470> been

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:57.710 
gold this is actually brass that's been

anything I'm sure it has nothing to do
with<00:02:05.510> your<00:02:05.720> tone<00:02:05.960> but<00:02:06.710> I<00:02:06.740> like<00:02:07.040> I<00:02:07.630> like<00:02:08.630> heavy

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:08.840 
with your tone but I like I like heavy

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.080 
metal so yeah I'm gonna button that up
and<00:02:12.830> then<00:02:13.640> we'll<00:02:14.090> see<00:02:14.390> if<00:02:14.510> these<00:02:14.660> EMGs<00:02:15.200> are<00:02:15.440> as

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
and then we'll see if these EMGs are as

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.240 
and then we'll see if these EMGs are as
warm<00:02:17.090> as<00:02:17.240> the<00:02:17.270> vintage<00:02:17.630> ones<00:02:17.950> like<00:02:18.950> I<00:02:19.040> said<00:02:19.220> I

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:19.250 
warm as the vintage ones like I said I
