00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:09.670 
American white wave bodybuilding
champion<00:00:07.759> today<00:00:08.750> I'm<00:00:09.049> going<00:00:09.170> to<00:00:09.260> talk<00:00:09.469> about

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:09.680 
champion today I'm going to talk about

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.400 
champion today I'm going to talk about
the<00:00:10.190> best<00:00:10.550> mass<00:00:10.969> building<00:00:11.389> performance<00:00:11.750> of

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:12.410 
the best mass building performance of

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.150 
the best mass building performance of
2014<00:00:13.509> it's<00:00:14.509> really<00:00:14.840> not<00:00:14.960> that<00:00:15.019> complicated<00:00:15.530> if

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:16.160 
2014 it's really not that complicated if

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.130 
2014 it's really not that complicated if
you<00:00:16.340> saw<00:00:16.520> the<00:00:16.580> video<00:00:16.910> on<00:00:16.939> the<00:00:17.360> side<00:00:17.750> effects<00:00:18.050> of

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:18.140 
you saw the video on the side effects of

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:19.900 
you saw the video on the side effects of
her<00:00:18.259> hormones<00:00:18.649> I<00:00:18.919> mean<00:00:19.250> is<00:00:19.399> the<00:00:19.489> same<00:00:19.669> chart

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:19.910 
her hormones I mean is the same chart

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:21.190 
her hormones I mean is the same chart
because<00:00:20.210> it<00:00:20.270> was<00:00:20.360> easy<00:00:20.540> for<00:00:20.720> people<00:00:20.840> to<00:00:20.989> follow

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:21.200 
because it was easy for people to follow

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.019 
because it was easy for people to follow
along<00:00:21.439> but<00:00:22.070> I<00:00:22.099> have<00:00:22.310> some<00:00:22.489> people<00:00:22.669> a<00:00:22.700> graphic

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:23.029 
along but I have some people a graphic

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:24.700 
along but I have some people a graphic
representation<00:00:23.360> of<00:00:23.750> what<00:00:23.869> I'm<00:00:23.960> talking<00:00:24.110> about

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:24.710 
representation of what I'm talking about

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.940 
representation of what I'm talking about
so<00:00:25.489> for<00:00:26.300> building<00:00:26.660> mass<00:00:26.840> you<00:00:27.590> need<00:00:27.739> to

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:27.950 
so for building mass you need to

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:29.350 
so for building mass you need to
basically<00:00:28.160> have<00:00:28.610> some<00:00:28.820> type<00:00:28.970> of<00:00:29.000> testosterone

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:29.360 
basically have some type of testosterone

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.389 
basically have some type of testosterone
derivative<00:00:30.050> devine<00:00:30.770> of<00:00:30.950> the<00:00:31.009> androgen

00:00:31.389 --> 00:00:31.399 
derivative devine of the androgen

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:34.690 
derivative devine of the androgen
receptors<00:00:32.200> you<00:00:33.200> can<00:00:33.380> also<00:00:33.620> benefit<00:00:34.250> from<00:00:34.309> some

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:34.700 
receptors you can also benefit from some

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.330 
receptors you can also benefit from some
estrogen<00:00:35.210> because<00:00:35.510> estrogen<00:00:36.100> alpha<00:00:37.100> and<00:00:37.250> beta

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:37.340 
estrogen because estrogen alpha and beta

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.120 
estrogen because estrogen alpha and beta
receptors<00:00:37.910> both<00:00:38.240> built<00:00:38.630> muscle<00:00:38.900> IGF<00:00:39.740> wanted

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:40.130 
receptors both built muscle IGF wanted

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.040 
receptors both built muscle IGF wanted
satellite<00:00:40.910> cell<00:00:41.090> migration<00:00:41.240> occurred<00:00:41.840> from

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 
satellite cell migration occurred from

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.180 
satellite cell migration occurred from
estrogen<00:00:42.530> which<00:00:43.130> is<00:00:43.340> relatively<00:00:44.270> unknown

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.190 
estrogen which is relatively unknown

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.030 
estrogen which is relatively unknown
that's<00:00:46.190> why<00:00:46.490> certain<00:00:47.270> whet<00:00:47.690> steroids<00:00:48.650> work

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:49.040 
that's why certain whet steroids work

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.700 
that's why certain whet steroids work
better<00:00:49.340> so<00:00:49.940> the<00:00:50.240> old<00:00:50.420> test<00:00:50.840> decade'<00:00:51.470> ball

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
better so the old test decade' ball

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.520 
better so the old test decade' ball
stack<00:00:52.130> those<00:00:52.940> are<00:00:53.120> pretty<00:00:53.630> wet<00:00:53.870> steroids<00:00:54.410> they

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:54.530 
stack those are pretty wet steroids they

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.350 
stack those are pretty wet steroids they
all<00:00:54.650> convert<00:00:54.980> to<00:00:55.070> estrogen<00:00:55.280> or<00:00:55.550> cause<00:00:56.150> some

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.360 
all convert to estrogen or cause some

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.240 
all convert to estrogen or cause some
type<00:00:56.510> of<00:00:56.540> bloating<00:00:57.020> some<00:00:57.680> type<00:00:57.800> of<00:00:57.829> estrogen

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
type of bloating some type of estrogen

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.220 
type of bloating some type of estrogen
conversion<00:00:58.730> that's<00:00:59.300> why<00:00:59.630> they<00:00:59.840> work<00:01:00.020> better

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
conversion that's why they work better

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.200 
conversion that's why they work better
for<00:01:00.470> mass<00:01:00.980> flow<00:01:01.190> because<00:01:01.640> the<00:01:01.670> estrogen

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
for mass flow because the estrogen

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.170 
for mass flow because the estrogen
receptors<00:01:02.690> alpha<00:01:03.140> and<00:01:03.230> beta<00:01:03.909> so<00:01:04.909> we<00:01:05.030> don't

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
receptors alpha and beta so we don't

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.050 
receptors alpha and beta so we don't
want<00:01:05.329> to<00:01:05.390> use<00:01:05.540> overly<00:01:06.049> dry<00:01:06.350> cycles<00:01:06.950> for<00:01:07.490> mass

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
want to use overly dry cycles for mass

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.969 
want to use overly dry cycles for mass
building<00:01:08.330> we<00:01:08.630> want<00:01:08.750> to<00:01:08.870> use<00:01:09.020> relatively<00:01:09.770> wet

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979 
building we want to use relatively wet

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:12.550 
building we want to use relatively wet
or<00:01:10.220> neutral<00:01:10.610> cycles<00:01:11.030> now<00:01:11.600> the<00:01:11.659> best<00:01:12.020> compound

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
or neutral cycles now the best compound

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.250 
or neutral cycles now the best compound
of<00:01:12.680> all<00:01:12.830> is<00:01:13.070> the<00:01:13.280> one<00:01:13.520> AD<00:01:13.909> or<00:01:14.330> 1<00:01:14.659> and<00:01:14.900> Rho<00:01:15.050> or<00:01:15.229> I

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:15.260 
of all is the one AD or 1 and Rho or I

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:16.960 
of all is the one AD or 1 and Rho or I
want<00:01:15.500> to<00:01:15.560> inter<00:01:15.710> standalone<00:01:16.070> that<00:01:16.670> converts

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
want to inter standalone that converts

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:18.789 
want to inter standalone that converts
into<00:01:17.180> one<00:01:17.390> test<00:01:17.630> one<00:01:17.810> test<00:01:18.140> doesn't<00:01:18.560> convert

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:18.799 
into one test one test doesn't convert

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:20.080 
into one test one test doesn't convert
into<00:01:18.950> the<00:01:19.010> HD<00:01:19.370> doesn't<00:01:19.670> convert<00:01:19.909> into

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
into the HD doesn't convert into

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:21.760 
into the HD doesn't convert into
estrogen<00:01:20.479> so<00:01:20.900> it's<00:01:21.020> a<00:01:21.080> straight<00:01:21.350> androgen

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
estrogen so it's a straight androgen

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.590 
estrogen so it's a straight androgen
receptor<00:01:21.860> binder<00:01:22.520> it's<00:01:23.030> just<00:01:23.240> about<00:01:23.479> as

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
receptor binder it's just about as

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.230 
receptor binder it's just about as
purely<00:01:23.900> a<00:01:24.049> Impala<00:01:24.830> kiss<00:01:25.040> as<00:01:25.159> can<00:01:25.400> be<00:01:25.580> also

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:26.240 
purely a Impala kiss as can be also

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:27.820 
purely a Impala kiss as can be also
known<00:01:26.390> as<00:01:26.510> a<00:01:26.540> selective<00:01:26.990> androgen<00:01:27.470> receptor

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:27.830 
known as a selective androgen receptor

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.610 
known as a selective androgen receptor
modulator<00:01:28.299> um<00:01:29.299> if<00:01:29.900> we<00:01:30.080> went<00:01:30.290> with<00:01:30.380> something

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:30.620 
modulator um if we went with something

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.560 
modulator um if we went with something
like<00:01:30.830> 480<00:01:31.130> which<00:01:31.970> converts<00:01:32.390> into

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:32.570 
like 480 which converts into

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.030 
like 480 which converts into
testosterone<00:01:33.290> testosterone<00:01:33.409> is<00:01:33.890> gonna

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 
testosterone testosterone is gonna

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:35.710 
testosterone testosterone is gonna
function<00:01:34.250> just<00:01:35.000> like<00:01:35.119> it<00:01:35.299> would<00:01:35.479> a<00:01:35.510> normal

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
function just like it would a normal

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.680 
function just like it would a normal
parent<00:01:36.200> hormone<00:01:36.560> by<00:01:37.460> baby<00:01:37.880> converts<00:01:38.479> into

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:38.690 
parent hormone by baby converts into

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.710 
parent hormone by baby converts into
estrogen<00:01:39.140> and<00:01:39.440> testosterone<00:01:39.909> so<00:01:40.909> 580<00:01:41.360> which

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
estrogen and testosterone so 580 which

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.109 
estrogen and testosterone so 580 which
is<00:01:41.840> also<00:01:42.080> known<00:01:42.200> as<00:01:42.290> just<00:01:42.530> DHEA<00:01:43.130> is<00:01:43.460> gonna<00:01:44.000> be

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:44.119 
is also known as just DHEA is gonna be

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:46.210 
is also known as just DHEA is gonna be
relatively<00:01:44.570> wet<00:01:44.960> as<00:01:45.140> far<00:01:45.320> as<00:01:45.409> Pro<00:01:45.619> hormones<00:01:45.979> go

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
relatively wet as far as Pro hormones go

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.850 
relatively wet as far as Pro hormones go
also<00:01:46.970> good<00:01:47.150> for<00:01:47.360> all<00:01:47.659> wet<00:01:48.229> ball<00:01:48.439> cannot

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
also good for all wet ball cannot

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.649 
also good for all wet ball cannot
necessarily<00:01:49.040> good<00:01:49.490> for<00:01:49.670> a<00:01:49.700> lean<00:01:49.970> mass<00:01:50.240> builder

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:50.659 
necessarily good for a lean mass builder

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:55.630 
necessarily good for a lean mass builder
at<00:01:50.780> dry<00:01:50.960> bulk<00:01:51.260> or<00:01:52.010> also<00:01:52.340> yeah<00:01:52.729> romesco<00:01:53.140> now<00:01:54.640> we

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:55.640 
at dry bulk or also yeah romesco now we

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.219 
at dry bulk or also yeah romesco now we
want<00:01:55.820> to<00:01:55.909> stay<00:01:56.060> away<00:01:56.270> from<00:01:56.330> all<00:01:56.600> the<00:01:56.720> dry<00:01:56.900> stuff

00:01:57.219 --> 00:01:57.229 
want to stay away from all the dry stuff

00:01:57.229 --> 00:01:59.350 
want to stay away from all the dry stuff
that's<00:01:57.439> stuff<00:01:57.560> that<00:01:57.590> converts<00:01:57.979> DHT<00:01:58.640> the<00:01:59.150> stuff

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
that's stuff that converts DHT the stuff

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.539 
that's stuff that converts DHT the stuff
that<00:01:59.509> inhibits<00:02:00.020> aroma<00:02:00.350> taste<00:02:00.650> because<00:02:01.400> then

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:01.549 
that inhibits aroma taste because then

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:04.600 
that inhibits aroma taste because then
you<00:02:01.640> lose<00:02:01.670> the<00:02:02.000> estrogens<00:02:02.420> benefit<00:02:02.869> a<00:02:03.520> lot<00:02:04.520> of

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
you lose the estrogens benefit a lot of

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:05.890 
you lose the estrogens benefit a lot of
the<00:02:04.670> reasons<00:02:04.939> why<00:02:05.060> people<00:02:05.299> get<00:02:05.390> sloppy<00:02:05.689> and

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:05.900 
the reasons why people get sloppy and

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.800 
the reasons why people get sloppy and
wet<00:02:06.049> on<00:02:06.409> the<00:02:06.979> alking<00:02:07.939> cycles<00:02:08.450> is<00:02:08.629> because

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
wet on the alking cycles is because

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.659 
wet on the alking cycles is because
they're<00:02:08.959> eating<00:02:09.289> like<00:02:09.439> garbage<00:02:09.890> and<00:02:10.129> so<00:02:10.549> they

00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:10.669 
they're eating like garbage and so they

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:13.390 
they're eating like garbage and so they
have<00:02:10.789> all<00:02:10.999> types<00:02:11.359> of<00:02:11.540> issues<00:02:11.689> but<00:02:12.079> sodium<00:02:12.620> fat

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
have all types of issues but sodium fat

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.280 
have all types of issues but sodium fat
and<00:02:13.730> water<00:02:13.909> accumulation<00:02:14.749> and<00:02:14.840> causing

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
and water accumulation and causing

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:16.380 
and water accumulation and causing
bloating<00:02:15.769> and<00:02:15.980> skin

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
bloating and skin

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.870 
bloating and skin
stretching<00:02:16.780> stretch<00:02:17.500> marks<00:02:17.920> most<00:02:18.580> of<00:02:18.730> that's

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
stretching stretch marks most of that's

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.730 
stretching stretch marks most of that's
diet<00:02:19.150> but<00:02:19.630> some<00:02:19.870> of<00:02:19.960> it<00:02:20.080> could<00:02:20.200> be<00:02:20.319> estrogen

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
diet but some of it could be estrogen

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:22.620 
diet but some of it could be estrogen
later<00:02:20.950> so<00:02:21.700> if<00:02:21.819> you're<00:02:21.970> doing<00:02:22.060> a<00:02:22.240> lean<00:02:22.420> mass

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
later so if you're doing a lean mass

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.030 
later so if you're doing a lean mass
build<00:02:22.930> and<00:02:23.110> you<00:02:23.170> want<00:02:23.410> to<00:02:23.530> be<00:02:23.620> able<00:02:23.709> to<00:02:23.860> stay

going to be even better than most

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.220
