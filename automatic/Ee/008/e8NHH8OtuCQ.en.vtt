00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
start the fight because um we basically

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.009

with you know Tsunade and the rest I'm
just<00:00:32.669> planning<00:00:32.850> out<00:00:33.180> what<00:00:33.840> they're<00:00:33.960> going<00:00:34.079> to

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
just planning out what they're going to

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.760 
just planning out what they're going to
do<00:00:34.790> for<00:00:35.790> basically<00:00:36.180> next<00:00:36.600> episode<00:00:37.020> now<00:00:37.260> I<00:00:37.559> was

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
do for basically next episode now I was

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.450 
do for basically next episode now I was
expected<00:00:38.219> a<00:00:38.250> little<00:00:38.340> bit<00:00:38.520> more<00:00:38.730> maybe<00:00:39.600> cuz<00:00:40.079> I

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:40.460 
expected a little bit more maybe cuz I

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.790 
expected a little bit more maybe cuz I
mean<00:00:41.460> they<00:00:42.030> cancel<00:00:42.450> next<00:00:43.020> why'd<00:00:43.469> they<00:00:43.649> cancel

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
mean they cancel next why'd they cancel

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.350 
mean they cancel next why'd they cancel
it<00:00:44.129> for<00:00:44.160> this<00:00:44.579> I<00:00:44.820> mean<00:00:44.940> it's<00:00:45.120> kind<00:00:45.300> of

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
it for this I mean it's kind of

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.790 
it for this I mean it's kind of
pointless<00:00:46.050> because<00:00:46.610> all<00:00:47.610> we<00:00:47.940> saw<00:00:48.180> was<00:00:48.800> done

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
pointless because all we saw was done

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.430 
pointless because all we saw was done
planning<00:00:50.690> what<00:00:51.690> were<00:00:51.809> they<00:00:51.989> planning<00:00:52.199> I

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
planning what were they planning I

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.010 
planning what were they planning I
really<00:00:52.680> basically<00:00:53.190> a<00:00:53.550> way<00:00:54.270> to<00:00:54.329> get<00:00:54.570> I<00:00:54.780> guess

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
really basically a way to get I guess

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.529 
really basically a way to get I guess
get<00:00:55.920> to<00:00:56.070> them<00:00:56.219> without<00:00:57.829> getting<00:00:59.539> involved

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
get to them without getting involved

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:01.849 
get to them without getting involved
they're<00:01:00.960> trying<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.289> plan<00:01:01.469> a<00:01:01.500> way<00:01:01.710> they<00:01:01.829> can

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
they're trying to plan a way they can

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.429 
they're trying to plan a way they can
take<00:01:02.190> them<00:01:02.340> out<00:01:02.489> pretty<00:01:02.730> much<00:01:02.820> easily<00:01:03.439> cuz

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
take them out pretty much easily cuz

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.920 
take them out pretty much easily cuz
those<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.729> people<00:01:06.060> that<00:01:06.360> survived<00:01:06.750> is

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
those the people that survived is

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.230 
those the people that survived is
basically<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.500> sookie<00:01:07.770> cat<00:01:07.950> the<00:01:08.100> kages<00:01:08.520> some

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
basically the sookie cat the kages some

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.820 
basically the sookie cat the kages some
of<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.420> older<00:01:09.630> guys<00:01:09.659> like<00:01:09.840> cars<00:01:10.260> dead<00:01:10.619> and<00:01:10.799> a

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
of the older guys like cars dead and a

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.010 
of the older guys like cars dead and a
couple<00:01:11.040> others<00:01:11.430> so<00:01:12.000> they're<00:01:12.180> not<00:01:12.330> anybody

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
couple others so they're not anybody

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.039 
couple others so they're not anybody

time<00:01:37.799> i<00:01:38.009> was<00:01:38.130> just<00:01:38.310> wondering<00:01:38.460> why<00:01:38.939> they

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
time i was just wondering why they

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.749 
time i was just wondering why they
canceled<00:01:39.930> it<00:01:40.280> biggest<00:01:41.280> problem<00:01:41.369> because<00:01:41.700> i

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
canceled it biggest problem because i

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:43.190 
canceled it biggest problem because i
don't<00:01:42.119> see<00:01:42.270> why<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.450> council<00:01:42.810> for<00:01:42.840> this<00:01:43.079> i

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
don't see why the council for this i

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.450 
don't see why the council for this i
could<00:01:43.320> see<00:01:43.409> if<00:01:43.530> it<00:01:43.619> was<00:01:43.680> a<00:01:43.920> lot<00:01:44.100> of<00:01:44.130> planning

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
could see if it was a lot of planning

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.660 
could see if it was a lot of planning
but<00:01:44.820> hopefully<00:01:45.780> next<00:01:46.649> week<00:01:46.979> they<00:01:47.460> don't

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
but hopefully next week they don't

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.940 
but hopefully next week they don't
cancel<00:01:47.820> we<00:01:48.090> have<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:49.049> closure<00:01:49.290> of<00:01:49.470> this<00:01:49.680> and

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:51.590
