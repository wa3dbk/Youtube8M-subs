been to Anfield and you never will and
that's<00:05:17.289> pretty<00:05:17.469> sad<00:05:17.710> some<00:05:17.949> people<00:05:17.979> it<00:05:18.340> that

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:18.490 
that's pretty sad some people it that

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:21.119 
that's pretty sad some people it that
far<00:05:18.729> away<00:05:18.849> that<00:05:19.000> their<00:05:19.300> circumstances<00:05:20.129> will

00:05:21.119 --> 00:05:21.129 
far away that their circumstances will

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:24.080 
far away that their circumstances will
prepping<00:05:21.460> probably<00:05:21.909> never<00:05:22.150> allow<00:05:22.539> them<00:05:22.840> to<00:05:23.289> go

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.090 
prepping probably never allow them to go

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:27.390 
prepping probably never allow them to go
so<00:05:25.090> I<00:05:25.599> genuinely<00:05:26.379> when<00:05:26.919> I<00:05:26.949> do<00:05:27.069> with<00:05:27.280> those

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:27.400 
so I genuinely when I do with those

00:07:21.529 --> 00:07:23.649 
I don't think he's as safe as he thinks
and<00:07:21.679> some<00:07:21.799> people<00:07:22.129> think<00:07:22.339> and<00:07:22.999> I'm<00:07:23.239> not<00:07:23.389> saying

00:07:23.649 --> 00:07:23.659 
and some people think and I'm not saying

00:07:23.659 --> 00:07:25.179 
and some people think and I'm not saying
one<00:07:24.109> way<00:07:24.229> I<00:07:24.259> think<00:07:24.499> about<00:07:24.679> what<00:07:24.889> should<00:07:25.069> happen

00:07:25.179 --> 00:07:25.189

but<00:07:25.999> I<00:07:26.029> think<00:07:26.239> the<00:07:26.360> transfer<00:07:26.719> window<00:07:26.899> this

00:07:27.189 --> 00:07:27.199 
but I think the transfer window this

00:07:27.199 --> 00:07:29.259 
but I think the transfer window this
month<00:07:27.439> might<00:07:27.679> dictate<00:07:28.459> a<00:07:28.729> little<00:07:28.999> bit<00:07:29.119> of<00:07:29.149> that

00:07:29.259 --> 00:07:29.269 
month might dictate a little bit of that
