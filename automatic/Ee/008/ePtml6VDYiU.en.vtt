00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.779
 welcome once again to criticism this 

00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:07.660
 video we will learn how to prepare your 

00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:09.580
 mouth or end-of- month kinchil are the 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:12.450
 entities that are needed to prepare the 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:12.450
 Quinche you define 

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:20.500
 we start with two small cucumbers 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.500
 you can use a big cucumber 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:25.450
 The first thing we are going to do is cut 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.450
 the tips 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:34.670
 and then we make a cut 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:37.520
 vertical but do not cut up down 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:40.550
 they have to leave a space like 1 or 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:43.160
 2 centimeters now we make another cut 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.530
 to create as an X remember not 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.449
 cut up down 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.750
 As I was saying, they have to leave more or 

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:52.280
 less a space of 1 or 2 centimeters 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.710
 so they can see the cut of them 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.690
 Now what we are going to do is put them 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.000
 salt the cucumbers around a 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.790
 spoonful so that the process starts 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.640
 Massera maceration is like marina 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:08.360
 but this is in fruits and vegetables as well 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:10.549
 what would be macerating this process is very 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:13.580
 important since it's going to allow the 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:16.660
 cucumber will stay crunchy once 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:19.550
 the cucumber is fermented like kinchil 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.840
 we let him stay for 20 minutes 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:23.200
 while we explain the others 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.200
 ingredients 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.790
 now we can apply an onion 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.590
 green in the original subtraction it says that 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.000
 you have to use chives I hope if 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.890
 you can not find scallions 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.890
 You can replace it with an onion 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.950
 now to peel a cross only what 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:50.979
 hit a little with the flat part of the 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:54.060
 knife and the shell comes out easily and 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:54.060
 we are going to finely chop it 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:13.190
 Now we are going to use two tablespoons of 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.110
 sugar you please use sugar 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.300
 white alone that I did not have and had to 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.730
 use of this two brown sugar 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:22.069
 teaspoons of sugar 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.819
 then we add 2 teaspoons 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:24.819
 chilli powder 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.480
 and finally we add 2 teaspoons of 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:41.430
 fish seasoning then you 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:45.020
 can add soy sauce or 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.020
 they can simply add salt 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.519
 we stir well 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:02.740
 and add to the mixture of 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.740
 onions with garlic 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.980
 and we'll come back until we get something 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:16.730
 that looks 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.730
 A) Yes 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:30.189
 once the 20 minutes have passed 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:32.730
 then we are going to add the mixture of 

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:36.299
 chili with onion to the two wines 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.299
 we open the divine 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:44.340
 and we make sure that the mixture stays 

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:44.340
 inside the cucumber 

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:49.280
 if you show you can use 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.760
 gloves so that our in Chile in 

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.760
 hands 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.010
 and we repeat with the same cucumber 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:12.240
 As you can see there was not much sauce left 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:14.340
 surplus as the first time 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:17.130
 they are probably going to make these recipes 

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:19.500
 it is important not to make a very 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.870
 great to see first if you are going to 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:24.150
 like later as a check 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.160
 end is ready then you will see if 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:28.290
 they like it or not and can increase the 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.770
 amounts to make rations more 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:30.770
 big 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:43.610
 now we let him be in fine chitre 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:45.430
 ferment at room temperature or if 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:49.069
 they want they can put it in the refrigerator 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:51.439
 once you have passed at least one 

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:55.210
 hour or a day of precedent then the 

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:55.210
 Cucumber kimchi is ready 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:02.430
 they can serve it that way and use it 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:06.830
 as an accompaniment with a meal already 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.830
 be cool or just with rice 

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:14.149
 in this case I'm going to start mine in 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:16.489
 francis the smallest can break it 

00:05:14.149 --> 00:05:18.799
 everything if they like or just chop what 

00:05:16.489 --> 00:05:21.219
 they go to eat every time they go to 

00:05:18.799 --> 00:05:21.219
 use 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:41.820
 I hope you liked this recipe 

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:45.540
 it can be stored in the refrigerator 

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:48.930
 Corked preference and Kimchi among more 

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:50.520
 have time is better because they get sick 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:52.830
 is more but I recommend you not 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:54.720
 leave him more than a month in his 

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:56.520
 refrigerator I hope this result 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:58.350
