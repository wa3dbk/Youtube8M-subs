00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
it now it's essentially the same process

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.820 
it now it's essentially the same process
as<00:00:17.700> before<00:00:17.730> you<00:00:18.720> just<00:00:18.900> simply<00:00:19.260> don't<00:00:19.560> cut<00:00:19.710> off

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830

the bangle I mean the bobbin you know
what<00:00:21.840> I<00:00:21.900> mean

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:22.369 
what I mean

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:26.200 
what I mean
make<00:00:23.369> sure<00:00:23.550> it's<00:00:23.700> about<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:23.939> right<00:00:24.180> size

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.210 
make sure it's about the right size

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.510 
make sure it's about the right size
there<00:00:27.210> we<00:00:27.419> go<00:00:27.770> wrap<00:00:28.770> around<00:00:28.950> now<00:00:29.220> I'm<00:00:29.369> gonna

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:29.520 
there we go wrap around now I'm gonna

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.210 
there we go wrap around now I'm gonna
make<00:00:29.700> this<00:00:29.880> one<00:00:30.060> be<00:00:30.210> a<00:00:30.239> multi<00:00:30.599> strand<00:00:30.960> but<00:00:31.710> as<00:00:32.040> I

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:32.220 
make this one be a multi strand but as I

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.380 
make this one be a multi strand but as I
said<00:00:32.279> it's<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.759> exact<00:00:33.270> same<00:00:33.420> idea<00:00:33.890> either<00:00:34.890> way

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:35.390 
said it's the exact same idea either way

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.750 
said it's the exact same idea either way
so<00:00:36.390> you<00:00:36.510> wrap<00:00:36.690> around<00:00:36.840> till<00:00:37.770> you<00:00:37.800> return<00:00:38.280> back

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
so you wrap around till you return back

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.500 
so you wrap around till you return back
to<00:00:38.970> the<00:00:39.060> end<00:00:39.240> where<00:00:39.630> your<00:00:40.020> bobbin<00:00:40.860> is<00:00:41.040> that<00:00:41.510> you

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510

to the end where your bobbin is that you
want<00:00:42.630> your<00:00:42.690> bobbin<00:00:43.050> to<00:00:43.140> be<00:00:43.290> nice<00:00:43.560> and<00:00:43.770> tucked

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:47.970 
bottom off you do cut this into the wire

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:51.170

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
next you have to line up the bobbins

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.630 
next you have to line up the bobbins
together<00:00:57.120> like<00:00:57.840> so<00:00:58.140> for<00:00:59.010> making<00:00:59.280> a<00:00:59.340> multi

so<00:02:08.340> it's<00:02:08.960> gonna<00:02:09.960> be<00:02:10.350> I'm<00:02:10.560> gonna<00:02:10.650> do<00:02:10.890> three

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
so it's gonna be I'm gonna do three

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.710 
so it's gonna be I'm gonna do three
wraps<00:02:11.610> here<00:02:11.910> you<00:02:12.180> know<00:02:12.300> I'm<00:02:12.420> doing<00:02:12.660> a

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
wraps here you know I'm doing a

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.120 
wraps here you know I'm doing a
different<00:02:12.990> pattern<00:02:13.200> it's<00:02:13.500> not<00:02:13.740> going<00:02:13.950> to<00:02:14.040> be

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
different pattern it's not going to be

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:15.290 
different pattern it's not going to be
symmetric<00:02:14.370> I'm<00:02:14.670> going<00:02:14.820> to<00:02:14.880> start<00:02:15.090> with<00:02:15.180> this

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
symmetric I'm going to start with this

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.390 
symmetric I'm going to start with this
big<00:02:15.570> bead<00:02:15.780> here<00:02:16.110> and<00:02:16.320> then<00:02:16.770> work<00:02:16.920> my<00:02:16.950> way<00:02:17.130> over

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
big bead here and then work my way over

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.600 
big bead here and then work my way over
towards<00:02:17.850> smaller<00:02:18.180> bees<00:02:18.710> put<00:02:19.710> this<00:02:19.890> up<00:02:20.130> over

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
towards smaller bees put this up over

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:28.960 
towards smaller bees put this up over
here<00:02:21.680> slide<00:02:22.680> it<00:02:22.710> down

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.440 

rolled<00:02:29.570> it<00:02:29.780> over<00:02:30.880> now<00:02:31.880> I'm<00:02:31.970> gonna<00:02:32.090> do<00:02:32.300> that

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
rolled it over now I'm gonna do that

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:33.970 
rolled it over now I'm gonna do that
thing<00:02:32.690> again<00:02:32.780> where<00:02:33.110> I<00:02:33.140> kind<00:02:33.350> of<00:02:33.410> make<00:02:33.590> a<00:02:33.620> frame

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
thing again where I kind of make a frame

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.340 
thing again where I kind of make a frame
around<00:02:34.010> the<00:02:34.490> bead<00:02:34.700> so<00:02:35.540> you<00:02:35.630> see<00:02:35.810> I'll<00:02:35.930> wrap<00:02:36.200> it

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
around the bead so you see I'll wrap it

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:43.210 
around the bead so you see I'll wrap it
around<00:02:36.470> here<00:02:36.890> one<00:02:37.690> two<00:02:41.320> three<00:02:42.320> few<00:02:43.010> times

around here one two three few times

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:48.100 
around here one two three few times
there<00:02:43.720> like<00:02:44.720> so<00:02:45.850> and<00:02:46.850> then<00:02:47.420> I'll<00:02:47.840> keep

I started with the red I'm gonna have

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:39.729 
I started with the red I'm gonna have
one<00:03:37.519> bead<00:03:37.760> dumb<00:03:38.030> up<00:03:38.180> in<00:03:38.329> red<00:03:38.510> and<00:03:39.290> the<00:03:39.470> others

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:39.739 
one bead dumb up in red and the others

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:41.860 
one bead dumb up in red and the others
in<00:03:39.920> this<00:03:40.040> pretty<00:03:40.280> copper<00:03:40.670> color<00:03:40.879> so<00:03:41.810> we'll

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
in this pretty copper color so we'll

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:47.460 
in this pretty copper color so we'll
hold<00:03:42.019> the<00:03:42.170> copper<00:03:42.500> there<00:03:44.799> start<00:03:46.359> wrapping

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
hold the copper there start wrapping

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:52.710 
hold the copper there start wrapping
right<00:03:48.470> next<00:03:48.799> to<00:03:48.889> my<00:03:49.040> red

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:52.720 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:56.960 

I'll<00:03:53.050> come<00:03:53.320> through<00:03:53.650> with<00:03:53.920> my<00:03:54.190> gold<00:03:55.150> pearl<00:03:55.860> and

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
I'll come through with my gold pearl and

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:00.660 
I'll come through with my gold pearl and
now<00:03:57.970> I'm<00:03:58.150> going<00:03:58.450> to<00:03:58.600> continue<00:03:59.580> wrapping<00:04:00.580> the

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
now I'm going to continue wrapping the

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:06.150 
now I'm going to continue wrapping the
wire<00:04:00.700> I<00:04:03.270> think<00:04:04.270> I'm<00:04:04.420> gonna<00:04:04.600> add<00:04:04.930> one<00:04:05.380> more

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
wire I think I'm gonna add one more

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:13.380 
wire I think I'm gonna add one more
little<00:04:06.340> dude<00:04:06.670> here<00:04:11.670> I'm<00:04:12.670> not<00:04:12.820> sure<00:04:13.000> if<00:04:13.090> I<00:04:13.210> like

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390 
little dude here I'm not sure if I like

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:18.360 
little dude here I'm not sure if I like
this<00:04:13.570> or<00:04:13.720> not<00:04:13.780> but<00:04:15.930> it<00:04:16.930> shows<00:04:17.290> you<00:04:17.530> the<00:04:17.860> process

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
this or not but it shows you the process

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
this or not but it shows you the process
and<00:04:18.550> that's<00:04:18.640> the<00:04:18.880> point

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:19.390 
and that's the point

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:21.900 
and that's the point
now<00:04:20.110> clearly<00:04:20.709> I've<00:04:20.950> got<00:04:21.100> these<00:04:21.250> ends<00:04:21.520> here

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
now clearly I've got these ends here

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:23.490 
now clearly I've got these ends here
which<00:04:22.210> needs<00:04:22.690> something<00:04:23.080> done<00:04:23.200> with<00:04:23.350> them

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
which needs something done with them

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:24.810 
which needs something done with them
because<00:04:23.680> you<00:04:23.800> don't<00:04:23.920> want<00:04:24.190> them<00:04:24.310> hugging<00:04:24.550> you

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
because you don't want them hugging you

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:26.730 
because you don't want them hugging you
so<00:04:25.750> I'm<00:04:25.810> going<00:04:25.930> to<00:04:26.020> come<00:04:26.170> through<00:04:26.380> and<00:04:26.620> as

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
so I'm going to come through and as

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.850 
so I'm going to come through and as
close<00:04:27.010> as<00:04:27.190> possible<00:04:27.340> to<00:04:27.670> the<00:04:27.850> beading<00:04:28.180> I<00:04:28.860> will

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
close as possible to the beading I will

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:32.430 
close as possible to the beading I will
cut<00:04:30.040> it<00:04:30.130> off<00:04:30.690> find<00:04:31.690> out<00:04:31.840> where<00:04:31.990> this<00:04:32.110> one<00:04:32.320> is

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:32.440 
cut it off find out where this one is

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:40.950 
cut it off find out where this one is
right<00:04:33.070> here<00:04:39.060> just<00:04:40.060> so<00:04:40.150> we<00:04:40.210> got<00:04:40.330> tangled<00:04:40.570> up<00:04:40.780> I

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 
right here just so we got tangled up I

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:45.990 
right here just so we got tangled up I
gotta<00:04:41.260> push<00:04:41.470> it<00:04:41.590> through<00:04:41.770> here<00:04:44.580> there<00:04:45.580> we<00:04:45.670> go

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
gotta push it through here there we go

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.230 
gotta push it through here there we go
this<00:04:46.150> one's<00:04:46.480> right<00:04:46.660> here

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:54.050 

it's<00:04:51.690> also<00:04:51.810> kind<00:04:52.320> of<00:04:52.380> difficult<00:04:52.800> to<00:04:52.889> cut<00:04:53.070> maybe

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
it's also kind of difficult to cut maybe

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.610 
it's also kind of difficult to cut maybe
I<00:04:54.210> should<00:04:54.389> have<00:04:54.479> planned<00:04:54.840> this<00:04:55.110> through<00:04:55.350> a<00:04:55.380> bit

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
I should have planned this through a bit

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.770 
I should have planned this through a bit
more<00:04:55.800> before<00:04:55.979> making<00:04:56.460> the<00:04:56.550> video<00:04:56.820> you<00:04:57.509> know<00:04:57.630> oh

00:04:57.770 --> 00:04:57.780 
more before making the video you know oh

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.469 
more before making the video you know oh
well<00:04:58.250> and<00:04:59.250> I'm<00:04:59.550> just<00:04:59.759> gonna<00:04:59.850> keep<00:05:00.060> wrapping

00:05:00.469 --> 00:05:00.479 
well and I'm just gonna keep wrapping

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:02.060 
well and I'm just gonna keep wrapping
and<00:05:00.600> wrapping<00:05:00.630> until<00:05:01.139> I've<00:05:01.440> covered<00:05:01.680> up<00:05:01.860> the

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.070 
and wrapping until I've covered up the

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:06.499 
and wrapping until I've covered up the
cut<00:05:02.280> ends<00:05:02.520> of<00:05:02.699> the<00:05:02.820> guitar<00:05:03.060> string<00:05:05.330> hold<00:05:06.330> the

00:05:06.499 --> 00:05:06.509 
cut ends of the guitar string hold the

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:09.740 
cut ends of the guitar string hold the
end<00:05:06.630> over<00:05:07.639> now<00:05:08.639> I'm<00:05:08.820> thinking<00:05:09.270> for<00:05:09.509> a<00:05:09.539> bit<00:05:09.630> of

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:09.750 
end over now I'm thinking for a bit of

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:11.749 
end over now I'm thinking for a bit of
visual<00:05:10.110> balance<00:05:10.380> I<00:05:10.770> might<00:05:10.949> try<00:05:11.100> putting<00:05:11.190> some

00:05:11.749 --> 00:05:11.759 
visual balance I might try putting some

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:14.870 
visual balance I might try putting some
of<00:05:11.789> that<00:05:12.560> golden<00:05:13.560> copper<00:05:13.860> color<00:05:14.190> over<00:05:14.520> here<00:05:14.550> by

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 
of that golden copper color over here by

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:23.530 
of that golden copper color over here by
all<00:05:15.000> my<00:05:15.150> bobbins

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:23.540 

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:38.999 

tada<00:05:24.500> it's<00:05:25.780> not<00:05:26.780> perfect<00:05:27.610> but<00:05:28.610> there<00:05:28.790> you<00:05:28.880> go

00:05:38.999 --> 00:05:39.009 

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:40.990 

all<00:05:40.009> right<00:05:40.159> so<00:05:40.280> my<00:05:40.370> dad<00:05:40.580> just<00:05:40.610> came<00:05:40.939> through

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:41.000 
all right so my dad just came through

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.760 
all right so my dad just came through
all<00:05:41.360> I<00:05:41.389> was<00:05:41.629> filming<00:05:41.960> and<00:05:42.199> said<00:05:42.379> how<00:05:42.500> weird

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:42.770 
all I was filming and said how weird

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:44.909 
all I was filming and said how weird
that<00:05:42.889> bracelet<00:05:43.490> looked<00:05:43.669> so<00:05:43.819> I<00:05:43.879> decided<00:05:44.270> I

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:44.919 
that bracelet looked so I decided I

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:47.350 
that bracelet looked so I decided I
should<00:05:45.919> probably<00:05:46.219> make<00:05:46.669> another<00:05:46.969> one<00:05:47.180> with

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:47.360 
should probably make another one with

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.550 
should probably make another one with
the<00:05:47.479> bangle<00:05:47.810> to<00:05:47.900> show<00:05:48.080> you<00:05:48.139> what<00:05:48.379> it<00:05:48.469> can

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:48.560 
the bangle to show you what it can

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:49.809 
the bangle to show you what it can
actually<00:05:48.830> look<00:05:49.219> like<00:05:49.280> when<00:05:49.580> you<00:05:49.669> do<00:05:49.789> it

00:05:49.809 --> 00:05:49.819 
actually look like when you do it

00:05:49.819 --> 00:05:52.270 
actually look like when you do it
correctly<00:05:50.449> that<00:05:50.780> looks<00:05:51.110> pretty<00:05:51.349> and<00:05:51.620> I'm<00:05:52.099> only

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:52.280 
correctly that looks pretty and I'm only

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:53.950 
correctly that looks pretty and I'm only
going<00:05:52.520> to<00:05:52.550> do<00:05:52.699> a<00:05:52.729> single<00:05:53.210> strand<00:05:53.479> one<00:05:53.689> and<00:05:53.870> I'm

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:53.960 
going to do a single strand one and I'm

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:55.149 
going to do a single strand one and I'm
not<00:05:54.110> going<00:05:54.259> to<00:05:54.319> do<00:05:54.409> any<00:05:54.590> beading<00:05:54.919> because

00:05:55.149 --> 00:05:55.159 
not going to do any beading because

00:05:55.159 --> 00:05:57.820 
not going to do any beading because
that's<00:05:55.310> a<00:05:55.400> lot<00:05:55.550> faster<00:05:56.080> but<00:05:57.080> just<00:05:57.289> to<00:05:57.590> show<00:05:57.770> you

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:57.830 
that's a lot faster but just to show you

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:01.240 
that's a lot faster but just to show you
how<00:05:58.069> this<00:05:58.189> can<00:05:58.250> be<00:05:58.490> done<00:05:59.590> I'm<00:06:00.590> going<00:06:00.919> to<00:06:01.069> wrap

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:01.250 
how this can be done I'm going to wrap

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:04.510 
how this can be done I'm going to wrap
all<00:06:01.490> the<00:06:01.610> way<00:06:01.639> around<00:06:02.740> make<00:06:03.740> my<00:06:03.889> bangle<00:06:04.310> size

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:04.520 
all the way around make my bangle size

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:05.950 
all the way around make my bangle size
and<00:06:04.879> make<00:06:04.969> it<00:06:05.060> a<00:06:05.120> little<00:06:05.270> smaller<00:06:05.569> than<00:06:05.689> my

00:06:05.950 --> 00:06:05.960 
and make it a little smaller than my

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:08.770 
and make it a little smaller than my
rest<00:06:06.229> so<00:06:06.500> that<00:06:06.530> it<00:06:06.770> can<00:06:06.949> fit<00:06:07.280> other<00:06:07.490> people<00:06:07.909> all

all right now if I weren't in such a
rush<00:06:59.199> I<00:06:59.349> probably<00:06:59.620> would<00:07:00.009> have<00:07:00.099> thought

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:00.160 
rush I probably would have thought

00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:01.950 
rush I probably would have thought
through<00:07:00.610> the<00:07:00.729> fact<00:07:00.940> that<00:07:01.030> I<00:07:01.150> like<00:07:01.389> putting<00:07:01.810> the

through the fact that I like putting the

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:04.230 
through the fact that I like putting the
wire<00:07:02.139> a<00:07:02.169> lot<00:07:02.530> closer<00:07:02.770> to<00:07:03.009> the<00:07:03.099> bangle<00:07:03.490> but<00:07:04.180> I

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:04.240 
wire a lot closer to the bangle but I

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:05.879 
wire a lot closer to the bangle but I
didn't<00:07:04.539> so<00:07:04.660> the<00:07:04.750> bangle<00:07:05.020> kinda<00:07:05.349> I<00:07:05.560> mean<00:07:05.650> not
