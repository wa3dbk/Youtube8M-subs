00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
vehicle and make it out somewhat up in

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.840 
vehicle and make it out somewhat up in
the<00:01:51.780> aerial<00:01:52.200> you'll<00:01:52.439> be<00:01:52.560> alright<00:01:52.740> alright<00:01:53.670> so

loose<00:02:09.750> kanyon<00:02:10.080> see<00:02:10.590> I<00:02:10.619> got<00:02:10.830> it<00:02:10.860> right<00:02:11.069> there

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
loose kanyon see I got it right there

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.559 
loose kanyon see I got it right there
just<00:02:11.520> for<00:02:11.610> going<00:02:11.790> under<00:02:11.970> that<00:02:12.000> bridge

00:02:12.559 --> 00:02:12.569 
just for going under that bridge

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:14.449 
just for going under that bridge
normally<00:02:13.290> you<00:02:13.439> wouldn't<00:02:13.709> do<00:02:13.799> that<00:02:13.830> but<00:02:14.159> I<00:02:14.220> just

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
normally you wouldn't do that but I just

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:16.100 
normally you wouldn't do that but I just
tried<00:02:14.640> to<00:02:14.670> be<00:02:14.849> slick<00:02:15.090> and<00:02:15.120> doing<00:02:15.989> a<00:02:16.019> little

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
tried to be slick and doing a little

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.360 
tried to be slick and doing a little
different<00:02:16.560> because<00:02:16.620> I've<00:02:16.860> played<00:02:16.950> this<00:02:17.159> one

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
different because I've played this one

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:18.860 
different because I've played this one
several<00:02:17.670> times<00:02:17.909> because<00:02:18.150> this<00:02:18.420> has<00:02:18.510> come<00:02:18.720> up<00:02:18.840> a

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
several times because this has come up a

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:20.569 
several times because this has come up a
couple<00:02:19.319> times<00:02:19.409> on<00:02:19.769> these<00:02:19.890> daily<00:02:20.159> objectives

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:20.579 
couple times on these daily objectives

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:24.649 
couple times on these daily objectives
here<00:02:20.760> I<00:02:21.680> was<00:02:22.680> just<00:02:22.890> trying<00:02:23.549> to<00:02:23.640> try<00:02:24.269> something

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:24.659 
here I was just trying to try something

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:26.929 
here I was just trying to try something
different<00:02:24.959> here<00:02:25.140> and<00:02:25.829> you<00:02:26.400> see<00:02:26.549> how<00:02:26.700> well<00:02:26.909> that

00:02:26.929 --> 00:02:26.939 
different here and you see how well that

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:30.979 
different here and you see how well that
worked<00:02:27.269> out<00:02:27.420> for<00:02:27.480> me<00:02:29.180> if<00:02:30.180> you<00:02:30.390> plan<00:02:30.569> on<00:02:30.599> doing

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
worked out for me if you plan on doing

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:32.690 
worked out for me if you plan on doing
this<00:02:31.140> air<00:02:31.440> race<00:02:31.650> right<00:02:31.860> here<00:02:31.890> I<00:02:32.159> definitely

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
this air race right here I definitely

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.490 
this air race right here I definitely
wouldn't<00:02:32.940> recommend<00:02:33.239> using<00:02:33.629> this<00:02:33.870> plane

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
wouldn't recommend using this plane

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.390 
wouldn't recommend using this plane
right<00:02:34.680> here<00:02:34.829> I<00:02:34.860> think<00:02:34.920> it's<00:02:35.159> called<00:02:35.310> the

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
right here I think it's called the

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.069 
right here I think it's called the
Duster<00:02:35.790> or<00:02:35.849> something<00:02:36.420> like<00:02:36.540> that<00:02:36.599> what<00:02:36.870> is<00:02:36.959> it

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:37.079 
Duster or something like that what is it

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:39.530 
Duster or something like that what is it
it's<00:02:37.290> a<00:02:37.379> crop<00:02:37.620> duster<00:02:37.650> is<00:02:38.010> what<00:02:38.159> it<00:02:38.280> is<00:02:38.480> but<00:02:39.480> I

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
it's a crop duster is what it is but I

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.420 
it's a crop duster is what it is but I
really<00:02:39.659> love<00:02:40.230> these<00:02:40.470> dual<00:02:40.709> wing<00:02:40.890> planes<00:02:41.250> they

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
really love these dual wing planes they

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.890 
really love these dual wing planes they
just<00:02:41.849> think<00:02:41.909> they<00:02:42.060> look<00:02:42.239> cool<00:02:42.420> looks<00:02:42.689> like<00:02:42.810> the

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
just think they look cool looks like the

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.020 
just think they look cool looks like the
Red<00:02:43.079> Baron<00:02:43.109> I<00:02:43.470> went<00:02:43.620> ahead<00:02:43.680> and<00:02:43.799> went<00:02:44.129> with<00:02:44.940> the

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
Red Baron I went ahead and went with the

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.819 
Red Baron I went ahead and went with the
red<00:02:45.209> paint<00:02:45.450> job<00:02:45.690> here<00:02:45.900> just<00:02:46.200> trying<00:02:46.560> to<00:02:46.680> make

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:46.829 
red paint job here just trying to make

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:48.280 
red paint job here just trying to make
it<00:02:46.950> look<00:02:47.099> more<00:02:47.129> like<00:02:47.400> the<00:02:47.489> Red<00:02:47.640> Baron<00:02:47.670> I

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
it look more like the Red Baron I

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.149 
it look more like the Red Baron I
thought<00:02:49.290> which<00:02:49.379> they<00:02:49.530> would<00:02:49.709> have<00:02:49.799> made<00:02:49.920> it<00:02:50.040> a

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:50.159 
thought which they would have made it a

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:52.069 
thought which they would have made it a
lot<00:02:50.370> cooler<00:02:50.609> because<00:02:51.180> I<00:02:51.329> mean<00:02:51.480> this<00:02:51.659> plane<00:02:51.900> is

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:52.079 
lot cooler because I mean this plane is

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:54.440 
lot cooler because I mean this plane is
just<00:02:52.109> awesome<00:02:52.409> but<00:02:53.190> it<00:02:53.519> doesn't<00:02:53.879> fly<00:02:54.209> worth

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
just awesome but it doesn't fly worth

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.149 
just awesome but it doesn't fly worth
the<00:02:54.569> shit<00:02:54.810> you<00:02:54.989> can't<00:02:55.230> go<00:02:55.379> upside-down<00:02:55.680> and

00:02:56.149 --> 00:02:56.159 
the shit you can't go upside-down and

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:57.619 
the shit you can't go upside-down and
control<00:02:56.730> it<00:02:56.849> like<00:02:56.970> you<00:02:57.090> can't<00:02:57.299> some<00:02:57.510> of<00:02:57.540> those

00:02:57.619 --> 00:02:57.629 
control it like you can't some of those

00:02:57.629 --> 00:02:59.059 
control it like you can't some of those
other<00:02:57.870> jets<00:02:58.139> some<00:02:58.319> of<00:02:58.379> those<00:02:58.470> other<00:02:58.650> jets<00:02:58.920> were

00:02:59.059 --> 00:02:59.069 
other jets some of those other jets were

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:01.729 
other jets some of those other jets were
just<00:02:59.280> so<00:03:00.120> so<00:03:00.450> more<00:03:00.720> superior<00:03:01.079> than<00:03:01.290> this<00:03:01.530> one

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
just so so more superior than this one

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:04.309 
just so so more superior than this one
