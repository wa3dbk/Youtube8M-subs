00:00:00.989 --> 00:00:06.221
 Hi, I'm Raquel DomÃ­nguez from www.operacionbikini.es and today I'll tell you 5 reasons why 

00:00:06.221 --> 00:00:08.260
 Running makes you look more handsome. 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:13.200
 There is no doubt that running makes us feel good, in fact many times after the closing 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:19.039
 the well-known rush of the corridor is produced, it is a very pleasant sensation because our 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:25.449
 brain is literally flooded with endorphins, but it also makes us feel good, 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:27.460
 It also helps us to see each other very well. 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.500
 In addition to help us control the weight if we need it, a series is produced 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.970
 of physical changes that will make you much more handsome. 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:41.250
 When you run you'll get long and toned legs, because when running we tone up 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:47.210
 the quadriceps, the hamstring and the muscles of the front of the hip. 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:54.710
 Also if you run on the slope you will get some very strong twins and a rear of scandal. 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.600
 Running you're going to get a firm butt, and running is a perfect exercise for 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:05.229
 tone your buttocks, and if you add a few sprints or slopes to those runs, 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:09.180
 As we said before, your ass will thank you. 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.940
 If you run frequently you will get a flat stomach. 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:18.890
 When running as it happens with many cardiovascular sports we are going to lose a lot of 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:24.180
 of abdominal fat, so let's make our abdomen look much flatter 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.289
 and we will wear waist. 

00:01:25.289 --> 00:01:28.159
 When running you will get a radiant skin. 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:33.090
 And is that running, in addition to eliminating toxins through sweat we will also increase 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.929
 blood circulation and that makes our skin look much more resplendent 

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:43.319
 and much prettier, yes, if you are going to go running during the day it is essential that you use 

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:50.159
 sunscreen, it does not matter if it's cloudy, it's winter or you think you do not need it, 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.479
 The sunscreen is your ally. 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:57.549
 And if you're a woman, you better go running without makeup, with your face clean to sweat 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:01:58.549
 best. 

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:02.490
 Running also helps you have much firmer arms. 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.810
 We tend to think that when running, only the legs move, but it is a lie, when running we have 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.630
 a swing with the arms that helps us fortify the biceps and the trifas, with 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:18.920
 What we end up with that hated downloadable effect that often occurs in this area. 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.440
