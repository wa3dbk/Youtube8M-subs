 the students have the opportunity to 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:31.170
 reflect and if there is something that does not 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.720

 complement ordinary education as 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:54.780
 in this California elementary school

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.170
 the future no need or buildings 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.480

 classic schools facilitate a 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.360
 direct exchange something that the 

00:03:43.049 --> 00:03:48.090
 online teaching still can not offer 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:51.030
 although it may be possible in the future 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:53.120
 no doubt the students in the USA would take
