00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:15.600
 hello to all in this new son vi 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:20.090
 I'll show you how to make smurfs in 

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:22.820
 george j color's house will serve me 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:28.020
 monophasic in this case use 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:31.320
 infinite of passions nails a white a 

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:35.100
 white day a bottle of gel 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.500
 empty a jar one thing for 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.739
 mix in this case use this 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.469
 I have found nothing else is a palette of 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.809
 use eye shadows this can be 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:53.600
 purchased on ebay he paid her on 30 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:55.950
 180 euro colors and so today I believe that 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:59.670
 will create a purple 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:03.329
 I will use this which is not urgent 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.979
 color then before using a 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.530
 eyeshadow I tell you that not everyone goes 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.610
 good in the sense that you have to check 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.440
 the lynx if the eyeshadows are without 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.179
 talc is fine 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:19.080
 you cannot use eye shadows with the 

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:21.360
 talc because they create lifts itself 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.869
 what for enamels if you want to mix 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.119
 of glazes with gel you have to buy 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:31.140
 the plasma you are without accept or in 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:33.119
 meaning those of kiko are fine that 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.399
 after having said this I will show you 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:41.569
 then I take this bottle of frost 

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:46.800
 bring and go get my cell 

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:51.110
 infiniti use this and put three of 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.110
 these beads so of jazz 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:03.730
 then obviously you can't create the 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.730
 quantity you prefer 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:34.079
 after putting the beautiful monophasic one 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:39.810
 puntina says white not much the only one 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:42.450
 dot to do it to put this 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:46.319
 because you have to put it so that you don't 

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:49.489
 create with the transparency layer 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:49.489
 here's then there is robben 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:07.980
 now I'm going to take the color after that 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:09.900
 having mixed the white I with a 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.430
 beat I went to take this vi 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.879
 in the water how to see you in fact there is the 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:22.230
 small hole in the script to crumble a 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:25.250
 little over this thing here and I go to 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.250
 promise it in here 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.930
 michelle or for good 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.910
 the color is ready in one off realized 

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.130
 very 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.870
 nothing from the stand anyway I wanted you 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:01.360
 say that for every three pearls of 

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:04.900
 monophasic hand cooking file for the 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:09.480
 small of white this is the quantity 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:13.350
 right and with which one knows they are not created 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.350
 no lifting or anything like that 

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:31.210
 paul and mary already very well and lasts a 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:34.750
 month like a normal day is never 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:47.289
 nobody died so mostly a 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:50.650
 normal thing were half catalyze now 

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:53.620
 I show you this second method which is here 

00:04:50.650 --> 00:05:00.520
 glazes precisely this smaltino of 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:05:02.590
 this brand here that without acetone e 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:05.710
 so it's great 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:11.139
 same thing applies to here other usage 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:13.710
 pontine of it was designed by ger 1 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:13.710
 phasic 

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:33.360
 but I do not add the elected white man 

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:40.140
 directly two bottles of this 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:43.530
 Enamel here is a very beautiful color 

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:45.840
 I've already tested this I don't know for sure 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:51.090
 that does not create any kind of disease 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:53.420
 the nail the things like that is 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:53.420
 ending 

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:07.600
 blend well 

00:06:14.249 --> 00:06:19.619
 it is not that much oar because this 

00:06:16.259 --> 00:06:20.549
 color just ready sky then 

00:06:19.619 --> 00:06:22.649
 I don't need it 

00:06:20.549 --> 00:06:25.109
 I 'm doing it just to do it for you 

00:06:22.649 --> 00:06:27.439
 see, however, not the girl we study it 

00:06:25.109 --> 00:06:27.439
 together 

00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:02.940
 I start to catalyze lamp also 

00:06:58.810 --> 00:07:05.380
 this can be the final result 

00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:08.500
 this is what I made with 

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:10.320
 the eyeshadow as you see or degrease without 

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:14.310
 no problem 

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:14.310
 I didn't have any problems 

00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:25.690
 instead it is this and that done that 

00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:29.440
 enamel also reassigned this without 

00:07:25.690 --> 00:07:31.380
 problems and no guys i hope that 

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:34.120
