00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:13.510 
we leaned the bus over as far as we

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:16.289 
we leaned the bus over as far as we
possibly<00:00:13.540> can<00:00:14.170> and<00:00:14.530> the<00:00:15.129> plan<00:00:15.340> is<00:00:15.580> that<00:00:15.610> I<00:00:15.790> run

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:16.299 
possibly can and the plan is that I run

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:19.410 
possibly can and the plan is that I run
up<00:00:16.990> the<00:00:17.260> main<00:00:17.440> sort<00:00:17.740> and<00:00:18.100> then<00:00:18.760> jump<00:00:19.060> off<00:00:19.240> the

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:19.420 
up the main sort and then jump off the

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.570 
up the main sort and then jump off the
top<00:00:19.630> into<00:00:20.110> the<00:00:20.230> water<00:00:20.410> and<00:00:20.830> I<00:00:20.920> get<00:00:20.980> there<00:00:21.250> the

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:21.580 
top into the water and I get there the

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.490 
top into the water and I get there the
mass<00:00:21.760> is<00:00:21.970> 30<00:00:22.240> meters<00:00:22.720> tall<00:00:22.960> which<00:00:23.260> is<00:00:23.290> an

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:23.500 
mass is 30 meters tall which is an

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.450 
mass is 30 meters tall which is an
equivalent<00:00:23.860> of<00:00:23.890> a<00:00:23.980> ten-story<00:00:24.010> building<00:00:26.460> Hugo

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:30.940 
we thought that would be appropriate to

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:37.150 
we thought that would be appropriate to
wear<00:00:31.090> for<00:00:31.300> this<00:00:31.390> one

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.160 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.950 

there's<00:00:37.790> so<00:00:37.940> many<00:00:38.060> little<00:00:38.270> things<00:00:38.360> that<00:00:38.720> can

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 
there's so many little things that can

there's so many little things that can
go<00:00:39.110> wrong<00:00:39.530> the<00:00:39.590> mass<00:00:39.830> is<00:00:40.040> incredibly<00:00:40.460> long<00:00:40.700> the

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:40.910 
go wrong the mass is incredibly long the

go wrong the mass is incredibly long the
wind<00:00:41.150> forces<00:00:41.540> are<00:00:41.930> pushing<00:00:42.200> and<00:00:42.500> pulling<00:00:42.650> the

boat sizes right itself make him as he

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.060 
boat sizes right itself make him as he
loses<00:00:47.300> grip<00:00:47.780> and<00:00:48.200> come<00:00:48.410> down<00:00:48.620> and<00:00:48.800> obviously

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.070 
loses grip and come down and obviously

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:56.590 
loses grip and come down and obviously
hit<00:00:49.190> the<00:00:49.280> deck<00:00:54.430> the<00:00:55.430> absolute<00:00:55.790> worst<00:00:55.820> scenario

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
hit the deck the absolute worst scenario

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.930 
hit the deck the absolute worst scenario
for<00:00:56.780> me<00:00:56.810> is<00:00:57.170> if<00:00:57.410> we<00:00:57.560> crash<00:00:57.860> tack<00:00:58.100> when<00:00:58.640> we<00:00:58.730> start

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:58.940 
for me is if we crash tack when we start

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.090 
for me is if we crash tack when we start
this<00:00:59.120> will<00:00:59.420> put<00:00:59.600> the<00:00:59.630> boat<00:00:59.870> and<00:01:00.290> the<00:01:00.410> master<00:01:00.770> 60

Aleks will start running up the mast if
there's<00:01:04.280> a<00:01:04.370> change<00:01:04.610> in<00:01:04.880> the<00:01:05.000> wind<00:01:05.210> the<00:01:05.900> mark

there's a change in the wind the mark
looking<00:01:06.440> violently<00:01:06.830> broach<00:01:07.130> and<00:01:07.490> the<00:01:07.580> mass

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:07.760 
looking violently broach and the mass

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.940 
looking violently broach and the mass
comes<00:01:08.030> up<00:01:08.180> right<00:01:08.360> so<00:01:09.140> unless<00:01:09.320> he<00:01:09.500> can<00:01:09.650> hold<00:01:09.770> on

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
comes up right so unless he can hold on

comes up right so unless he can hold on
the<00:01:10.250> only<00:01:10.400> way<00:01:10.490> is<00:01:10.550> going<00:01:10.880> is<00:01:11.000> towards<00:01:11.270> the

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
the only way is going is towards the

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.910 
the only way is going is towards the
water<00:01:14.020> we've<00:01:15.020> got<00:01:15.140> a<00:01:15.170> lot<00:01:15.350> of<00:01:15.380> sailing<00:01:15.800> and

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
water we've got a lot of sailing and

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.830 
water we've got a lot of sailing and
this<00:01:16.040> is<00:01:16.160> something<00:01:16.520> really<00:01:17.180> far<00:01:17.420> out<00:01:17.630> there

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
this is something really far out there

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.749 
this is something really far out there
and<00:01:18.050> pretty<00:01:18.560> dangerous<00:01:19.040> I<00:01:19.250> think<00:01:19.460> it's<00:01:19.550> a<00:01:19.610> bit

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:19.759 
and pretty dangerous I think it's a bit

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:21.940 
and pretty dangerous I think it's a bit
nuts<00:01:19.970> we've<00:01:20.360> had<00:01:20.540> a<00:01:20.570> few<00:01:20.810> near<00:01:21.229> misses<00:01:21.710> in<00:01:21.860> the

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
nuts we've had a few near misses in the

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.160 
nuts we've had a few near misses in the
past<00:01:22.160> so<00:01:22.520> it's<00:01:23.360> gonna<00:01:23.509> be<00:01:23.720> tight<00:01:23.900> whether

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
past so it's gonna be tight whether

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:48.060 
past so it's gonna be tight whether
Alice<00:01:24.470> can<00:01:24.650> do<00:01:24.770> this

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:48.070 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:49.420

we<00:02:47.599> knew<00:02:47.810> there<00:02:48.170> were<00:02:48.319> moments<00:02:48.590> where<00:02:48.890> we

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
we knew there were moments where we

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.710 
we knew there were moments where we
would<00:02:49.220> have<00:02:49.370> full<00:02:49.670> control<00:02:49.940> about<00:02:50.270> and<00:02:50.480> there

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
would have full control about and there

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.540 
would have full control about and there
would<00:02:50.840> be<00:02:50.870> a<00:02:50.989> border<00:02:51.349> line<00:02:51.380> where<00:02:51.739> the<00:02:52.190> control

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550 
would be a border line where the control

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.370 
would be a border line where the control
could<00:02:52.790> get<00:02:53.000> lost<00:02:53.150> very<00:02:53.390> quickly<00:02:53.450> at<00:02:54.110> the<00:02:54.230> boat
