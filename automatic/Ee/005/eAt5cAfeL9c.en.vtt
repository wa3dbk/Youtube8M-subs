demonstration video with 704 wolves of
the<00:00:07.290> Pacific<00:00:08.090> this<00:00:09.090> one<00:00:09.389> I<00:00:09.599> will<00:00:09.809> be<00:00:09.929> tracking

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
the Pacific this one I will be tracking

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.509 
the Pacific this one I will be tracking
and<00:00:10.940> destroying<00:00:11.940> hopefully<00:00:12.690> a<00:00:13.160> target<00:00:14.160> using

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
and destroying hopefully a target using

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.650 
and destroying hopefully a target using
nothing<00:00:14.700> but<00:00:14.880> sonar<00:00:16.970> sonar<00:00:17.970> in<00:00:18.150> the<00:00:18.240> map<00:00:18.390> and

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
nothing but sonar sonar in the map and

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.450 
nothing but sonar sonar in the map and
all<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:18.869> tools<00:00:19.080> on<00:00:19.260> the<00:00:19.289> map<00:00:19.529> you<00:00:20.130> get<00:00:20.340> the

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
all the tools on the map you get the

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.210 
all the tools on the map you get the
gist<00:00:20.640> of<00:00:20.760> it<00:00:21.109> so<00:00:22.109> we<00:00:22.590> are<00:00:22.680> well<00:00:23.010> below

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
gist of it so we are well below

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.240 
gist of it so we are well below
periscope<00:00:23.970> depth

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
periscope depth

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.910 

just

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
just

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.620 
just
very

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:31.630 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:36.330 

well<00:00:32.020> we<00:00:32.920> just<00:00:32.950> got<00:00:33.160> a<00:00:33.280> contact<00:00:33.910> on<00:00:34.240> sonar<00:00:35.310> so<00:00:36.310> I

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:36.340 
well we just got a contact on sonar so I

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.430 
well we just got a contact on sonar so I
will<00:00:36.550> order<00:00:36.880> my<00:00:37.060> sonar<00:00:37.480> operator<00:00:37.930> to<00:00:38.140> track

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:38.440 
will order my sonar operator to track

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.790 
will order my sonar operator to track
him

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.590 

double-check<00:00:41.670> everything<00:00:42.000> on<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.270> map<00:00:42.450> it

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
double-check everything on the map it

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.540 
double-check everything on the map it
looks<00:00:42.630> like<00:00:42.960> we're<00:00:43.140> already<00:00:43.320> stopped<00:00:43.920> which

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
looks like we're already stopped which

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:46.959 
looks like we're already stopped which
is<00:00:44.700> perfect

00:00:46.959 --> 00:00:46.969 
is perfect

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:52.389 
is perfect
so<00:00:47.949> he<00:00:48.949> is<00:00:49.809> probably<00:00:50.809> out<00:00:51.050> of<00:00:51.199> range<00:00:51.440> but<00:00:51.890> just

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:52.399 
so he is probably out of range but just

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:55.000 
so he is probably out of range but just
to<00:00:52.489> confirm<00:00:53.140> we'll<00:00:54.140> go<00:00:54.289> to<00:00:54.350> the<00:00:54.500> sonar<00:00:54.739> station

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
to confirm we'll go to the sonar station

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.790 
to confirm we'll go to the sonar station
bump<00:00:55.760> the<00:00:55.969> bearing<00:00:56.300> up<00:00:56.449> to<00:00:56.600> 86<00:00:57.110> degrees<00:00:57.199> and

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
bump the bearing up to 86 degrees and

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.880 
bump the bearing up to 86 degrees and
send<00:00:58.010> out<00:00:58.129> a<00:00:58.159> pain

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.880 

once<00:01:02.490> again<00:01:02.610> I<00:01:02.940> did<00:01:03.270> design<00:01:03.570> this<00:01:03.780> myself<00:01:04.290> so

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
once again I did design this myself so

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.320 
once again I did design this myself so
it's<00:01:05.489> a<00:01:06.050> little<00:01:07.050> simplistic<00:01:07.560> no<00:01:08.490> pain<00:01:08.700> back<00:01:08.970> so

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
it's a little simplistic no pain back so

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.400 
it's a little simplistic no pain back so
he's<00:01:09.720> on<00:01:09.930> a<00:01:09.960> range<00:01:10.610> it's<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:11.700> little<00:01:11.940> simplistic

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:12.410 
he's on a range it's a little simplistic

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:14.440 
he's on a range it's a little simplistic
but

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:14.450 
but

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.480 
but
I<00:01:14.539> did<00:01:15.170> it<00:01:15.289> to<00:01:15.409> teach<00:01:15.560> myself<00:01:15.829> how<00:01:16.070> to<00:01:16.159> do<00:01:16.340> this

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:16.490 
I did it to teach myself how to do this

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.030 
I did it to teach myself how to do this
and<00:01:17.049> I<00:01:18.049> think<00:01:18.590> I<00:01:18.710> learned<00:01:19.280> pretty<00:01:19.520> well

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:21.040 
and I think I learned pretty well

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.520 
and I think I learned pretty well
and<00:01:21.130> despite<00:01:22.030> being<00:01:22.450> simplistic<00:01:22.960> I'm<00:01:23.290> going

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
and despite being simplistic I'm going

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.920 
and despite being simplistic I'm going
to<00:01:23.620> be<00:01:23.680> doing<00:01:23.920> all<00:01:24.100> the<00:01:24.220> work<00:01:24.370> right<00:01:24.400> here<00:01:24.970> so

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
to be doing all the work right here so

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:27.210 
to be doing all the work right here so
it's<00:01:26.080> not<00:01:26.230> like<00:01:26.410> I'm<00:01:26.590> going<00:01:26.830> to<00:01:26.980> have<00:01:27.130> an

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:27.220 
it's not like I'm going to have an

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:28.800 
it's not like I'm going to have an
advantage<00:01:27.520> because<00:01:27.730> I<00:01:28.180> already<00:01:28.300> know<00:01:28.570> what

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
advantage because I already know what

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:35.710 
advantage because I already know what
everything<00:01:29.050> does<00:01:29.520> even<00:01:30.520> though<00:01:30.610> I<00:01:30.640> do

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.180 

I'm<00:01:35.870> going<00:01:36.020> to<00:01:36.110> plug<00:01:36.380> in<00:01:36.530> a<00:01:36.620> couple<00:01:37.010> things

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:37.190 
I'm going to plug in a couple things

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.730 
I'm going to plug in a couple things
just<00:01:37.550> to<00:01:37.700> make<00:01:37.820> my<00:01:37.970> work<00:01:38.180> a<00:01:38.300> little<00:01:38.420> easier<00:01:38.960> in

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
just to make my work a little easier in

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.440 
just to make my work a little easier in
the<00:01:40.010> future

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.450 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.540

bearing once wool that's already up as
we<00:01:54.130> just<00:01:54.310> discovered<00:01:54.820> he's<00:01:55.000> at<00:01:55.150> 86<00:01:55.690> degrees<00:01:56.369> so

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 
we just discovered he's at 86 degrees so

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:01.780 
we just discovered he's at 86 degrees so
he<00:01:58.000> is<00:01:58.090> somewhere<00:01:58.600> along<00:01:58.900> this<00:01:59.229> line

what we need to do right now is wait

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.050 
what we need to do right now is wait
until<00:02:06.590> we<00:02:06.920> can<00:02:07.070> get<00:02:07.280> a<00:02:07.310> good<00:02:07.610> reading<00:02:07.910> on

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
until we can get a good reading on

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.630 
until we can get a good reading on
bring<00:02:10.630> up<00:02:10.750> my<00:02:10.899> watch<00:02:11.080> just<00:02:11.830> to<00:02:12.490> make

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
bring up my watch just to make

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.760 
bring up my watch just to make
everything<00:02:12.940> easier

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
everything easier

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.720 
everything easier
and<00:02:15.160> then<00:02:15.370> we'll<00:02:15.580> wait<00:02:15.700> I<00:02:16.080> wait<00:02:17.080> until<00:02:17.370> 7:10<00:02:18.370> on

better<00:02:31.570> that<00:02:32.080> being<00:02:32.230> said<00:02:32.560> it's<00:02:32.710> still<00:02:32.800> kind

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
better that being said it's still kind

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.000 
better that being said it's still kind
of<00:02:33.370> slow<00:02:33.550> isn't

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:46.899 

bump<00:02:36.610> this<00:02:36.760> up<00:02:36.940> to<00:02:37.000> 85<00:02:37.540> see<00:02:38.140> what<00:02:38.260> we<00:02:38.379> can<00:02:38.530> get

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
looks like he's still out of range

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:52.680 
looks like he's still out of range
so<00:02:50.770> we<00:02:50.950> are<00:02:51.250> going<00:02:51.520> to<00:02:51.760> wait<00:02:51.910> a<00:02:52.150> little<00:02:52.420> bit

so we are going to wait a little bit

00:02:52.690 --> 00:03:08.369 
so we are going to wait a little bit
longer

00:03:08.369 --> 00:03:08.379 

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:10.649

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:42.510 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.170 

we'll<00:03:42.960> go<00:03:43.080> ahead<00:03:43.230> and<00:03:43.319> wait<00:03:43.620> 15<00:03:44.370> minutes<00:03:44.910> or<00:03:45.030> so

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
we'll go ahead and wait 15 minutes or so

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:50.940

since<00:03:45.420> he's<00:03:45.690> going<00:03:46.080> very<00:03:46.530> slowly

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:50.950 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:54.500 

very

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:54.510 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.490 

84<00:03:55.470> degrees<00:03:55.620> only<00:03:56.129> now

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
84 degrees only now

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:59.820 
84 degrees only now
that's<00:03:58.010> pretty<00:03:58.400> slow

00:03:59.820 --> 00:03:59.830 
that's pretty slow

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:01.970 
that's pretty slow
go<00:04:00.130> ahead<00:04:00.280> and<00:04:00.400> hop<00:04:00.520> in<00:04:00.580> our<00:04:00.790> sonar<00:04:01.210> station

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
go ahead and hop in our sonar station

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:16.390 
go ahead and hop in our sonar station
pump<00:04:02.980> that<00:04:03.190> up<00:04:03.220> to<00:04:03.490> 84

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:19.030 

is<00:04:16.910> not<00:04:17.209> even<00:04:17.389> in<00:04:17.630> range<00:04:17.870> of<00:04:18.079> multiple<00:04:18.650> loops

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:19.040 
is not even in range of multiple loops

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.039 
is not even in range of multiple loops
of<00:04:19.250> this

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
of this

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:34.530 
of this
so<00:04:21.650> once<00:04:22.550> again<00:04:22.789> we<00:04:23.690> wait

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:34.540 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:36.540 

since<00:04:35.200> he<00:04:35.350> is<00:04:35.500> going<00:04:35.770> so<00:04:36.010> slow<00:04:36.220> we'll<00:04:36.370> just

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
since he is going so slow we'll just

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.709 
since he is going so slow we'll just
skip<00:04:36.910> it<00:04:37.000> right<00:04:37.210> past<00:04:37.390> the<00:04:37.660> 5-minute<00:04:37.870> mark

00:04:39.709 --> 00:04:39.719 
skip it right past the 5-minute mark

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:41.999 
skip it right past the 5-minute mark
after<00:04:40.719> this<00:04:40.960> one<00:04:41.199> actually<00:04:41.590> I'll<00:04:41.740> show<00:04:41.770> you

00:04:41.999 --> 00:04:42.009 
after this one actually I'll show you

00:04:42.009 --> 00:04:44.309 
after this one actually I'll show you
the<00:04:42.249> weather<00:04:42.430> outside<00:04:42.729> and<00:04:43.389> why<00:04:43.780> we<00:04:44.020> are<00:04:44.139> doing

00:04:44.309 --> 00:04:44.319 
the weather outside and why we are doing

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:50.090 
the weather outside and why we are doing
it<00:04:44.620> like<00:04:44.860> this

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.190 

it<00:04:50.760> might<00:04:50.970> seem<00:04:51.240> a<00:04:51.270> little<00:04:51.360> bit<00:04:51.690> cumbersome

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:52.200 
it might seem a little bit cumbersome

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:55.790 
it might seem a little bit cumbersome
which<00:04:52.410> it<00:04:52.740> can<00:04:53.070> be<00:04:53.370> but<00:04:54.140> this<00:04:55.140> is<00:04:55.320> still<00:04:55.590> pretty

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
which it can be but this is still pretty

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.490 
which it can be but this is still pretty
helpful<00:04:56.370> to<00:04:56.520> be<00:04:56.610> able<00:04:56.640> to<00:04:56.820> know<00:04:57.140> in<00:04:58.140> case<00:04:58.320> you

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
helpful to be able to know in case you

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:03.230 
helpful to be able to know in case you
ever<00:04:58.590> run<00:04:58.920> into<00:04:58.980> something<00:04:59.880> like<00:05:00.680> this<00:05:02.240> where

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 
ever run into something like this where

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:06.310 
ever run into something like this where
we<00:05:03.480> can't<00:05:03.870> even<00:05:04.020> see<00:05:04.320> the<00:05:04.470> horizon<00:05:04.980> right<00:05:05.130> now

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:06.320 
we can't even see the horizon right now

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.070 
we can't even see the horizon right now
there's<00:05:07.320> rain<00:05:07.650> fog<00:05:08.310> cloudy<00:05:08.910> sky<00:05:09.360> it's<00:05:09.780> just

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
there's rain fog cloudy sky it's just

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:13.220 
there's rain fog cloudy sky it's just
pretty<00:05:10.650> much<00:05:11.210> the<00:05:12.210> worst<00:05:12.450> conditions<00:05:13.050> you

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:13.230 
pretty much the worst conditions you

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:16.939 
pretty much the worst conditions you
could<00:05:13.350> have<00:05:13.560> for<00:05:13.800> that

00:05:16.939 --> 00:05:16.949 

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:20.719
