 on your mine 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:55.030

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:50.900
 but 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.599
 and this should be avoided 

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:01.600
 like they shoot at us the opposite is 

00:05:04.009 --> 00:05:06.669

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:34.030
 other enemy lasers charge and three 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:37.960
 summer and we need to exercise 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:37.960
 to avoid them 

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:44.430
 almost doing shot 

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:57.820

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:14.160

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:20.850
 aolla nights 

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:26.420
 who knew 

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:35.599
 we don't get 

00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:49.440
 bath is too much to tie 

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:52.850
 simply called 

00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:52.850
 epileptic drops 

00:07:04.649 --> 00:07:12.539

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:33.400
 funny what to say funny we went 

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:33.400
 perhaps the first level 

00:07:34.510 --> 00:07:43.360
 I think that for some reason this is for me. 

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:47.290
 more than enough if you have 

00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:49.690
 epilepsy no this is definitely not your option 

00:07:47.290 --> 00:07:51.760
 can't play me if not then why not 

00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:53.830
 no basically funny we kill in 

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:58.950
 the end of the main boss then the game rolls 

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:58.950
 back and we go from the end to the beginning 

00:07:59.110 --> 00:08:04.819
 at least thought idea pretty pretty 

00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:07.009
