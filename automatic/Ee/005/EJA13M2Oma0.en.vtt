00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
well yeah one of the benefits of this of

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.190 
well yeah one of the benefits of this of
X<00:00:31.470> over<00:00:31.800> zero<00:00:32.279> is<00:00:32.610> that<00:00:33.360> he's<00:00:33.450> a<00:00:33.480> little<00:00:33.630> easier

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
X over zero is that he's a little easier

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.590 
X over zero is that he's a little easier
to<00:00:34.380> pose<00:00:34.649> he's<00:00:35.430> a<00:00:35.460> little<00:00:35.760> stronger<00:00:36.090> but<00:00:36.239> once

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
to pose he's a little stronger but once

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.860 
to pose he's a little stronger but once
again<00:00:36.750> just<00:00:37.110> like<00:00:37.230> zero<00:00:38.010> another<00:00:38.820> paper<00:00:39.570> clip

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
again just like zero another paper clip

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.040 
again just like zero another paper clip
is<00:00:40.520> impossible<00:00:41.520> to<00:00:42.059> build<00:00:42.360> you<00:00:42.750> have<00:00:42.780> to

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
is impossible to build you have to

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.049 
is impossible to build you have to
modify<00:00:43.350> myself<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:44.160> the<00:00:44.610> difference<00:00:44.910> between

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
modify myself and the difference between

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.920 
modify myself and the difference between
X<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:45.989> zero<00:00:46.230> is<00:00:46.379> that<00:00:46.620> X<00:00:47.280> has<00:00:48.210> shiny<00:00:48.629> blue

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930

X and zero is that X has shiny blue
balls<00:00:52.399> this<00:00:53.399> is<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.579> parse<00:00:53.789> that<00:00:53.940> came<00:00:54.120> with<00:00:54.239> X

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
balls this is the parse that came with X

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:57.049 
balls this is the parse that came with X
this<00:00:54.690> is<00:00:54.840> X<00:00:55.050> is<00:00:55.260> read<00:00:55.590> harm<00:00:55.890> red<00:00:56.280> helmet<00:00:56.699> the

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
this is X is read harm red helmet the

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.270 
this is X is read harm red helmet the
alternate<00:00:57.510> colors<00:00:57.780> they're<00:00:58.590> zeros<00:00:58.980> blue

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
alternate colors they're zeros blue

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.990

armor<00:00:59.699> there's<00:01:00.090> X's<00:01:00.920> other<00:01:01.920> arm<00:01:02.460> piece<00:01:02.820> I

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
armor there's X's other arm piece I

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.700 
armor there's X's other arm piece I
guess<00:01:03.120> since<00:01:03.600> I<00:01:03.780> have<00:01:03.930> the<00:01:03.989> Buster<00:01:04.320> and<00:01:04.470> one<00:01:04.589> of

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
guess since I have the Buster and one of

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.620 
guess since I have the Buster and one of
his<00:01:04.799> awesome<00:01:05.040> jeans<00:01:05.189> on

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630

his awesome jeans on
oh<00:01:06.659> that's<00:01:07.619> Nero's<00:01:08.040> blue<00:01:08.310> helmets<00:01:08.700> I<00:01:08.939> think

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
oh that's Nero's blue helmets I think

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:10.910 
oh that's Nero's blue helmets I think
you<00:01:09.900> guys<00:01:10.020> can<00:01:10.170> see<00:01:10.260> that<00:01:10.290> right<00:01:10.500> there<00:01:10.710> and

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
you guys can see that right there and

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.560 
you guys can see that right there and
there's<00:01:11.130> zeros<00:01:11.729> blue<00:01:11.909> hair<00:01:12.090> for<00:01:12.270> some<00:01:12.390> strange

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.179 
there's zeros blue hair for some strange
reason<00:01:12.630> I<00:01:13.080> didn't<00:01:13.650> think<00:01:13.799> his<00:01:13.860> hair<00:01:14.070> would

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
reason I didn't think his hair would

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.859 
reason I didn't think his hair would
change<00:01:14.400> colors<00:01:14.610> since<00:01:15.030> he<00:01:15.240> changed<00:01:15.420> armor<00:01:15.780> as

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
change colors since he changed armor as

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.580 
change colors since he changed armor as

such<00:03:36.250> a<00:03:36.280> big<00:03:36.640> difference<00:03:36.820> between<00:03:37.270> the<00:03:37.330> two<00:03:37.480> of

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:37.510 
such a big difference between the two of

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:39.240 
such a big difference between the two of
them<00:03:37.720> they<00:03:38.020> basically<00:03:38.380> have<00:03:38.590> the<00:03:38.680> same<00:03:38.709> joints

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
them they basically have the same joints

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.160 
them they basically have the same joints
they<00:03:39.340> gave<00:03:39.520> me<00:03:39.610> the<00:03:39.730> exact<00:03:40.030> same<00:03:40.209> parts<00:03:40.570> that

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:26.229 
now there's a clear piece right there

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:29.700 
now there's a clear piece right there
that<00:04:26.919> is<00:04:27.250> a<00:04:27.310> piece<00:04:27.729> of<00:04:28.050> wire<00:04:29.050> I<00:04:29.229> have<00:04:29.439> a<00:04:29.469> piece

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
that is a piece of wire I have a piece

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:30.839 
that is a piece of wire I have a piece
of<00:04:29.830> that<00:04:29.919> wire<00:04:30.069> right<00:04:30.340> here<00:04:30.400> that<00:04:30.669> I<00:04:30.699> can<00:04:30.819> show

00:04:30.839 --> 00:04:30.849 
of that wire right here that I can show

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:34.679 
of that wire right here that I can show
you<00:04:31.060> guys<00:04:31.210> what<00:04:31.960> I<00:04:31.990> use<00:04:32.259> I<00:04:32.560> use<00:04:33.330> these<00:04:34.330> kind<00:04:34.629> of

00:04:34.679 --> 00:04:34.689 
you guys what I use I use these kind of

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:38.670 
you guys what I use I use these kind of
wire<00:04:36.659> if<00:04:37.659> you<00:04:37.780> guys<00:04:37.870> can<00:04:38.110> see<00:04:38.199> that<00:04:38.229> that's

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
wire if you guys can see that that's

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.230 
wire if you guys can see that that's
basically<00:04:39.129> the<00:04:39.460> wire<00:04:39.610> they<00:04:39.819> give<00:04:40.000> you<00:04:40.120> with

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
basically the wire they give you with

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.209 
basically the wire they give you with
random<00:04:40.689> toys<00:04:40.930> when<00:04:41.229> you<00:04:41.319> want<00:04:41.469> box<00:04:41.680> them<00:04:41.949> these

00:04:42.209 --> 00:04:42.219 
random toys when you want box them these

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:44.010 
random toys when you want box them these
are<00:04:42.400> the<00:04:42.490> wire<00:04:42.669> that<00:04:42.849> kinda<00:04:43.689> holds<00:04:43.930> them

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.020 
are the wire that kinda holds them

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:46.860 
are the wire that kinda holds them
together<00:04:44.139> in<00:04:44.409> the<00:04:44.500> case<00:04:45.479> this<00:04:46.479> wire<00:04:46.719> is

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
together in the case this wire is

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.499 
together in the case this wire is
actually<00:04:47.550> this<00:04:48.550> wire<00:04:48.789> is<00:04:48.909> actually<00:04:49.060> pretty

00:04:49.499 --> 00:04:49.509 
actually this wire is actually pretty

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:52.320 
actually this wire is actually pretty
strong<00:04:49.750> and<00:04:49.960> pretty<00:04:50.020> flexible<00:04:50.530> but<00:04:51.180> it<00:04:52.180> will

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 
strong and pretty flexible but it will

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.409 
strong and pretty flexible but it will
break<00:04:52.569> after<00:04:52.930> a<00:04:52.960> while<00:04:53.199> but<00:04:53.620> that's<00:04:53.800> like<00:04:54.009> I

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:54.419 
break after a while but that's like I

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:56.249 
break after a while but that's like I
tested<00:04:55.419> it<00:04:55.479> to<00:04:55.599> see<00:04:55.629> how<00:04:55.810> long<00:04:55.960> it<00:04:56.020> would<00:04:56.229> take

00:04:56.249 --> 00:04:56.259 
tested it to see how long it would take

00:04:56.259 --> 00:04:59.550 
tested it to see how long it would take
and<00:04:56.529> that's<00:04:56.650> at<00:04:56.770> least<00:04:57.060> 600<00:04:58.060> bends<00:04:58.779> till<00:04:59.409> it

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
and that's at least 600 bends till it

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.580 
and that's at least 600 bends till it
actually<00:05:00.069> rips<00:05:00.279> apart<00:05:00.569> but<00:05:01.569> I<00:05:01.599> doubt<00:05:01.689> you<00:05:02.560> guys

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:02.590
