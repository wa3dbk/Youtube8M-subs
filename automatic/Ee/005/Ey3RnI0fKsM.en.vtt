00:04:41.589 --> 00:04:43.139 
around my skill sets personally I find
that<00:04:41.709> it<00:04:41.860> also<00:04:41.979> was<00:04:42.279> around<00:04:42.550> for<00:04:42.729> most<00:04:42.969> of<00:04:43.089> the

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:43.149 
that it also was around for most of the

00:04:43.149 --> 00:04:44.339 
that it also was around for most of the
other<00:04:43.300> cast<00:04:43.509> some<00:04:43.839> of<00:04:43.929> them<00:04:44.050> were<00:04:44.169> a<00:04:44.229> little

00:04:44.339 --> 00:04:44.349 
other cast some of them were a little

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:46.769 
other cast some of them were a little
more<00:04:44.559> exaggerated<00:04:45.099> but<00:04:45.509> basically<00:04:46.509> it's<00:04:46.659> just

00:04:46.769 --> 00:04:46.779 
more exaggerated but basically it's just

00:04:46.779 --> 00:04:49.350 
more exaggerated but basically it's just
an<00:04:47.319> exaggeration<00:04:47.979> of<00:04:48.249> our<00:04:48.429> own<00:04:48.580> skill<00:04:48.939> set<00:04:48.969> so

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:49.360 
an exaggeration of our own skill set so

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.939 
an exaggeration of our own skill set so
