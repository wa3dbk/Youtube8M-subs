00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:16.059
 the coefficient is worth 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:18.620
 the highest value of coefficients 

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:21.659
 118 

00:00:21.659 --> 00:00:23.880
 OK then 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.939
 everyday 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:28.939
 that exceeds 100 that day and that out on track 

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:33.160
 that day you have to leave stinks 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.360
 let's see for example 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.720
 percent 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:40.340
 let's see for example 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.210
 this high coefficient day is worth 82 which was 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.210
 the first cabbage last we opened 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.520
 now we are 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.750
 in last Wednesday 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.940
 see the difference 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:58.020
 the amplitude as the worst coefficient 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.560
 the jump 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.820
 the co the amplitude between the tides is high 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.980
 what happens with the tidal coefficients 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.500
 that as we are in the Mediterranean that add 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.100
 closed tides 1 affect both 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:16.870
 in open seas 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:19.990
 Cadiz type and little 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.700
 12 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.940
 the days when the amplitude of the before the tide that there is a lot of difference 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.780
 between 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.410
 between low tide and high tide 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.140
 it's worth those days 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.730
 you have to go fishing, paper money, let's suppose 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:39.730
 from which chick we went fishing 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:41.480
 what schedule 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.450
 It would be that he who would interest us 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.230
 and then you support 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:49.530
 today for example I'm going out fishing early morning buoy 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.300
 and I will leave from six in the morning 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.020
 until noon 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.510
 for example 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:57.590
 OK 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.390
 but it would be more advisable to leave in the afternoon from 2 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:03.650
 until 9 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:05.640
 or from 2 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.340
 as we see there 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:08.979
 until five or six 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.039
 that time slot 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.539
 it will be more effective 

00:02:13.539 --> 00:02:16.969
 I for example would come out of two 

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:22.099
 or two hanway goal this top point means the highest point of 

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:23.139
 the 

00:02:23.139 --> 00:02:24.979
 they call you 

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:27.979
 ys the lowest point of the low tide 

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:31.729
 me in this case if I had to leave today 

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:34.729
 would leave as he commented from 2 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.099
 until 9 and in this strip ja of 2 to 4 

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:43.019
 all the artillery stuffed and 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:45.489
 the best evo I ask the 

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:48.189
 all the artillery there 

00:02:48.189 --> 00:02:53.069
 as best we have country the country and concentrated all the artillery 

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:56.269
 well civil 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:57.419
 as you see 

00:02:57.419 --> 00:02:59.409
 percent 

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:00.550
 these dates 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.349
 they are very important 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:06.139
 At the time I chose, it's much more 

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:08.049
 it was and above all 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:09.700
 our hour 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:10.759
 dt 

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:14.209
 malet because many people have gone many times 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.669
 certainly affects us 

00:03:17.669 --> 00:03:20.499
 because he validates them on Saturday 

00:03:20.499 --> 00:03:25.039
 stinks it may be I do not know if in the morning or in the afternoon a job 

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:29.819
 power we look at it for the best on Saturday it does not matter to go fishing 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:31.579
 to reverse 

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:34.959
 a few months over here 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:37.269
 let's see for example with destination 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:40.979
 pomeranz p this Sunday 9 we are 

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:43.819
 I want to go out to Salvador fixed 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:45.279
 I'm interested 

00:03:45.279 --> 00:03:48.309
 I'm interested in leaving this Saturday either 

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:49.570
 do not care 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:51.949
 I went neither Saturday nor Sunday 

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:56.400
 in this case we are going to assume we would have interested this weekend I would not 

00:03:56.399 --> 00:04:00.809
 I would have left but let's see if we got in this Friday 

00:04:02.219 --> 00:04:05.359
 this Friday for example 

00:04:05.359 --> 00:04:09.819
 - sacyr amplitude of Maria would not have interested me either 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:12.509
 ep go fishing at dawn 

00:04:12.509 --> 00:04:15.759
 rubiales interested will open the evening efe veis 

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:20.199
 and in this time slot not from the uv not 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:22.249
 at 4 

00:04:22.249 --> 00:04:25.729
 mounted artillery and inside 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:30.150
 of three that drags and we arrived we mounted shovels four to have all the artillery 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:30.800
 full 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:31.740
 and gentlemen 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.740
 at 7 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.120
 OK 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.069
 bilbo- let's plan for example 

00:04:41.069 --> 00:04:44.210
 the month 

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:45.999
 we'll see 

00:04:45.999 --> 00:04:48.499
 look look what my mother appears ni 

00:04:48.499 --> 00:04:50.129
 look these days 

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:51.700
 no 27 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:53.680
 and in all and I feel 3 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.680
 these three days you have to leave 

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:02.669
 of these three days for example I would advise leaving 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:05.349
 the 

00:05:05.349 --> 00:05:07.009
 this sport because 

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:10.009
 because these days the fish has already eaten 

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.380
 here would come out let's see let's see for example 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:17.139
 this day the 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:20.139
 Wed Wednesday 19 

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:26.529
 look at the amplitude of the tides 

00:05:26.529 --> 00:05:28.029
 here for example 20 

00:05:28.029 --> 00:05:30.849
 It would be interesting to leave also 

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:32.439
 at these hours 

00:05:32.439 --> 00:05:38.279
 It is not always in the afternoon, always in the morning depending on the months 

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:40.939
 in which we are 

00:05:40.939 --> 00:05:43.789
 we will have more concentration in the first hour 

00:05:43.789 --> 00:05:47.020
 or in the middle of the day or at the end of the day 

00:05:47.999 --> 00:05:49.870
 set yourself this day for example 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:52.870
 mortal from one until eight 

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:56.460
 this day is mortal from 8 o'clock 

00:05:56.969 --> 00:05:59.969
 do not care 

00:06:02.719 --> 00:06:05.909
 and nothing 

00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:08.619
 I hope that 

00:06:08.619 --> 00:06:10.809
 quesada 

00:06:10.809 --> 00:06:12.220
 helped 

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:15.199
 this video and especially what 

00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:18.199
 that has ignored what I wanted to transmit 

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:21.710
 now 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:24.710
 now there is viedma 

00:06:25.349 --> 00:06:28.180
 the patient looked for a lot of affection 

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:31.180
 and I hope that 

00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:35.080
 has been helpful and as always you know 

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:37.379
 Saragossa 

00:06:37.379 --> 00:06:41.110
 his body costa efe fed up with the pony video 

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:44.379
 josÃ© pedraza 

00:06:44.379 --> 00:06:44.929
 a greeting
