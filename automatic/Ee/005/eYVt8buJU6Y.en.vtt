Raceway

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.960 
Raceway
we<00:00:16.350> took<00:00:16.529> parts<00:00:16.920> of<00:00:17.039> this<00:00:17.190> thing<00:00:17.430> and<00:00:17.609> built

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:17.970 
we took parts of this thing and built

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:20.570 
we took parts of this thing and built
our<00:00:18.180> own<00:00:18.240> trap<00:00:19.020> here<00:00:19.439> you<00:00:19.619> got<00:00:19.830> the

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
our own trap here you got the

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.220 
our own trap here you got the
straightaway<00:00:21.180> all<00:00:21.420> the<00:00:21.689> way<00:00:21.810> through<00:00:22.050> it's

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
straightaway all the way through it's

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.830 
straightaway all the way through it's
like<00:00:22.320> a<00:00:22.410> drag<00:00:22.680> strip<00:00:22.890> and<00:00:23.160> it<00:00:24.029> has<00:00:24.210> a<00:00:24.240> booster

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
these car can go through one loop and

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.720 
these car can go through one loop and
drag<00:00:37.079> all<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.500> way<00:00:37.559> through<00:00:37.890> at<00:00:38.219> the<00:00:38.399> end<00:00:38.579> of
