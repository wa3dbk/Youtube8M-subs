creative reviews today we're going to be
doing<00:00:03.659> an<00:00:03.899> aesthetic<00:00:04.470> comparison<00:00:05.130> between

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:05.310 
doing an aesthetic comparison between

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.660 
doing an aesthetic comparison between
the<00:00:05.549> apple<00:00:06.150> ipad<00:00:06.779> air<00:00:07.410> first<00:00:07.919> generation<00:00:08.490> and

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
the apple ipad air first generation and

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.140 
the apple ipad air first generation and
the<00:00:09.240> apple<00:00:09.780> ipad<00:00:09.960> air<00:00:10.469> 2<00:00:10.700> here<00:00:11.700> we<00:00:11.910> have<00:00:12.030> them

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
the apple ipad air 2 here we have them

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.910 
the apple ipad air 2 here we have them
both<00:00:12.300> on<00:00:13.730> let's<00:00:14.730> take<00:00:14.849> a<00:00:14.910> look<00:00:15.089> at<00:00:15.179> the<00:00:15.240> bottom

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:15.920 
both on let's take a look at the bottom

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.410 
both on let's take a look at the bottom
first<00:00:16.920> thing<00:00:17.130> you<00:00:17.220> can<00:00:17.340> probably<00:00:17.609> see<00:00:17.789> here<00:00:18.300> is

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
first thing you can probably see here is

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.810 
first thing you can probably see here is
the<00:00:18.869> thickness<00:00:19.500> of<00:00:19.830> the<00:00:20.130> device<00:00:20.369> and<00:00:20.400> go<00:00:20.699> as

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
the thickness of the device and go as

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.420 
the thickness of the device and go as
low<00:00:21.060> as<00:00:21.090> I<00:00:21.330> possibly<00:00:21.600> can<00:00:22.050> on<00:00:22.289> your<00:00:22.890> left<00:00:23.220> is

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
low as I possibly can on your left is

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.259 
low as I possibly can on your left is
the<00:00:23.880> old<00:00:24.210> iPad<00:00:25.140> air<00:00:25.470> and<00:00:25.740> on<00:00:25.890> your<00:00:26.189> right<00:00:26.269> we

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
the old iPad air and on your right we

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.950 
the old iPad air and on your right we
have<00:00:27.630> the<00:00:28.170> brand-new<00:00:28.650> iPad<00:00:29.310> air<00:00:29.910> 2<00:00:29.939> and<00:00:30.480> you

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
have the brand-new iPad air 2 and you

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.659 
have the brand-new iPad air 2 and you
can<00:00:31.140> see<00:00:31.410> the<00:00:31.560> difference<00:00:31.949> in<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.369> thickness

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
can see the difference in the thickness

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.000 
can see the difference in the thickness
not<00:00:33.570> only<00:00:33.780> as<00:00:33.930> a<00:00:34.020> thinner<00:00:34.260> it<00:00:34.530> is<00:00:34.649> lighter

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
not only as a thinner it is lighter

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.389 
not only as a thinner it is lighter
while<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.880> ipad<00:00:36.180> air<00:00:36.329> was<00:00:36.450> a<00:00:36.480> pound<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:37.649> ipad

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
while the ipad air was a pound the ipad

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.270 
while the ipad air was a pound the ipad
air<00:00:38.640> 2<00:00:38.690> ways<00:00:39.690> even<00:00:39.930> less<00:00:40.410> than<00:00:40.440> that<00:00:40.649> in<00:00:40.980> it<00:00:41.129> you

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
air 2 ways even less than that in it you

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.130 
air 2 ways even less than that in it you
can<00:00:41.309> definitely<00:00:41.969> feel<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.450> difference<00:00:42.960> i've

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
can definitely feel the difference i've

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.810 
can definitely feel the difference i've
been<00:00:43.320> told<00:00:43.530> its<00:00:43.770> hold<00:00:43.980> just<00:00:44.280> like<00:00:44.399> holding<00:00:44.700> the

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
been told its hold just like holding the

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.000 
been told its hold just like holding the
screen<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.329> I<00:00:45.750> can<00:00:45.780> definitely<00:00:46.170> see<00:00:46.559> that<00:00:46.590> I

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
screen and I can definitely see that I

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.729 
screen and I can definitely see that I
can<00:00:48.000> definitely<00:00:48.300> feel<00:00:48.450> it<00:00:48.510> as<00:00:48.750> well<00:00:48.930> on<00:00:49.590> the

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
can definitely feel it as well on the

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.229 
can definitely feel it as well on the
bottom<00:00:50.039> you<00:00:50.070> have<00:00:50.190> your<00:00:50.610> lightning<00:00:50.850> port

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
bottom you have your lightning port

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.189 
bottom you have your lightning port
stays<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.750> same<00:00:52.010> you<00:00:53.010> have<00:00:53.280> your<00:00:53.550> two<00:00:53.820> rows<00:00:54.059> of

00:00:54.189 --> 00:00:54.199 
stays the same you have your two rows of

00:00:54.199 --> 00:00:57.040 
stays the same you have your two rows of
speaker<00:00:55.199> grills<00:00:55.500> here<00:00:55.770> but<00:00:55.920> on<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.129> new<00:00:56.250> one

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 
speaker grills here but on the new one

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.290 
speaker grills here but on the new one
it's<00:00:58.050> only<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.350> single<00:00:58.649> row<00:00:58.920> I<00:00:59.300> definitely

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
it's only a single row I definitely

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.240 
it's only a single row I definitely
assume<00:01:00.690> that's<00:01:00.930> because<00:01:01.289> of<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.859> thickness

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
assume that's because of the thickness

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.399 
assume that's because of the thickness
itself<00:01:02.670> as<00:01:02.879> we're<00:01:03.510> on<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.629> bottom<00:01:03.809> here<00:01:04.199> the

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
itself as we're on the bottom here the

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:07.640 
itself as we're on the bottom here the
new<00:01:04.559> too<00:01:04.830> has<00:01:05.100> touch<00:01:05.519> ID<00:01:06.020> while<00:01:07.020> the<00:01:07.290> first

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
new too has touch ID while the first

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.840 
new too has touch ID while the first
generation<00:01:08.189> of<00:01:08.369> course<00:01:08.640> does<00:01:09.180> not<00:01:10.220> are<00:01:11.220> on<00:01:11.549> the

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
generation of course does not are on the

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.690 
generation of course does not are on the
front<00:01:12.299> of<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.750> device<00:01:12.840> key<00:01:13.740> key<00:01:14.130> thing<00:01:14.430> it's

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
front of the device key key thing it's

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.410 
front of the device key key thing it's
the<00:01:14.909> screen<00:01:15.420> there's<00:01:16.080> a<00:01:16.170> brand-new<00:01:16.619> laminated

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
the screen there's a brand-new laminated

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:20.420 
the screen there's a brand-new laminated
screen<00:01:18.420> on<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:19.049> two<00:01:19.290> and<00:01:19.619> it<00:01:20.130> is<00:01:20.250> not

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
screen on the two and it is not

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.240 
screen on the two and it is not
laminated<00:01:21.150> on<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:22.140> first<00:01:22.590> generation<00:01:23.100> so

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
laminated on the first generation so

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.590 
laminated on the first generation so
what<00:01:23.400> we're<00:01:23.520> going<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.700> do<00:01:23.790> here<00:01:23.820> is<00:01:24.060> go<00:01:24.240> as<00:01:24.360> low

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
what we're going to do here is go as low

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.590 
what we're going to do here is go as low
as<00:01:24.630> we<00:01:24.840> possibly<00:01:25.049> can<00:01:25.500> here<00:01:25.890> and<00:01:26.119> you're<00:01:27.119> you

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
as we possibly can here and you're you

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.749 
as we possibly can here and you're you
can<00:01:27.750> actually<00:01:28.170> even<00:01:28.290> see<00:01:28.650> my<00:01:28.860> fingerprints<00:01:29.610> on

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
can actually even see my fingerprints on

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.670 
can actually even see my fingerprints on
here<00:01:30.180> but<00:01:30.689> you<00:01:30.780> can<00:01:30.930> also<00:01:31.079> see<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.470> separation

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
here but you can also see the separation

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.609 
here but you can also see the separation
how<00:01:32.310> this<00:01:32.610> knot<00:01:32.850> is<00:01:33.030> not<00:01:33.390> looking<00:01:33.720> as<00:01:33.960> clear<00:01:34.470> as

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
how this knot is not looking as clear as

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:37.819 
how this knot is not looking as clear as
it<00:01:34.680> once<00:01:35.159> did<00:01:35.430> from<00:01:36.299> this<00:01:36.960> optimal<00:01:37.619> viewing

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
it once did from this optimal viewing

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.929 
it once did from this optimal viewing
angle<00:01:38.840> so<00:01:39.840> unfortunately<00:01:40.400> it<00:01:41.400> becomes<00:01:41.700> hard

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
angle so unfortunately it becomes hard

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:44.389 
angle so unfortunately it becomes hard
to<00:01:42.060> see<00:01:42.329> at<00:01:42.780> different<00:01:43.439> angles<00:01:43.590> with<00:01:43.979> this<00:01:44.159> one

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
to see at different angles with this one

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.200 
to see at different angles with this one
it's<00:01:45.149> a<00:01:45.329> lot<00:01:45.659> better<00:01:46.549> both<00:01:47.549> of<00:01:47.700> these<00:01:47.790> by<00:01:48.149> the

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
it's a lot better both of these by the

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.719 
it's a lot better both of these by the
way<00:01:48.329> are<00:01:48.390> really<00:01:49.110> bright<00:01:49.500> lights<00:01:49.920> as<00:01:50.250> you<00:01:50.579> can

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
way are really bright lights as you can

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.139 
way are really bright lights as you can
definitely<00:01:50.880> see<00:01:51.210> here<00:01:51.509> and<00:01:52.430> while<00:01:53.430> it<00:01:53.670> also

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
definitely see here and while it also

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.639 
definitely see here and while it also
dims<00:01:54.509> you<00:01:55.290> can<00:01:55.470> definitely<00:01:55.770> see<00:01:56.159> clear<00:01:56.729> images

00:01:57.639 --> 00:01:57.649 
dims you can definitely see clear images

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:59.870 
dims you can definitely see clear images
here<00:01:58.649> you<00:01:58.890> can<00:01:59.040> definitely<00:01:59.250> see<00:01:59.579> what<00:01:59.729> you're

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
here you can definitely see what you're

camera and you can also probably see the
camera<00:03:18.030> looks<00:03:18.359> different<00:03:18.750> itself<00:03:19.470> so<00:03:20.190> you

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
camera looks different itself so you

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.879 
camera looks different itself so you
have<00:03:20.489> here<00:03:20.819> for<00:03:21.239> the<00:03:21.329> front<00:03:21.690> and<00:03:21.959> here<00:03:22.590> for<00:03:22.829> the

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
back and here nothing on the top again

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:36.289 
back and here nothing on the top again
we're<00:03:35.129> going<00:03:35.220> to<00:03:35.310> set<00:03:35.519> this<00:03:35.609> up<00:03:35.669> here<00:03:36.060> so<00:03:36.209> you

00:03:36.289 --> 00:03:36.299 
we're going to set this up here so you

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:42.009 
we're going to set this up here so you
can<00:03:36.419> see<00:03:36.449> a<00:03:36.689> comparison<00:03:37.519> how<00:03:38.519> thin<00:03:38.909> that<00:03:38.939> is

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:44.960 

you<00:03:43.019> can<00:03:43.199> definitely<00:03:43.769> see<00:03:44.340> the<00:03:44.370> difference<00:03:44.489> up

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
you can definitely see the difference up

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.110 
you can definitely see the difference up
here<00:03:45.180> on<00:03:45.689> the<00:03:45.930> top<00:03:45.959> not<00:03:46.379> much<00:03:46.620> has<00:03:46.799> changed<00:03:47.120> you

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
here on the top not much has changed you

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.469 
here on the top not much has changed you
still<00:03:48.419> have<00:03:48.629> your<00:03:48.810> sleep<00:03:49.590> turn<00:03:50.489> on<00:03:50.699> power<00:03:51.209> off

00:03:51.469 --> 00:03:51.479 
still have your sleep turn on power off

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:55.159 
still have your sleep turn on power off
button<00:03:52.189> same<00:03:53.189> here<00:03:53.579> but<00:03:54.540> of<00:03:54.629> course<00:03:54.870> it<00:03:55.049> is

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:55.169 
button same here but of course it is

00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:59.149 
button same here but of course it is
thinner<00:03:56.040> here's<00:03:56.669> the<00:03:56.879> original<00:03:57.560> there<00:03:58.560> is<00:03:58.859> the

00:03:59.149 --> 00:03:59.159 
thinner here's the original there is the

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:07.280 
thinner here's the original there is the
two<00:04:00.650> and<00:04:01.650> finally<00:04:02.459> as<00:04:02.639> we<00:04:02.699> see<00:04:06.019> the<00:04:07.019> camera

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
two and finally as we see the camera

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.349 
two and finally as we see the camera
looks<00:04:07.680> a<00:04:07.829> little<00:04:08.280> bit<00:04:08.459> different<00:04:08.819> it<00:04:08.970> has<00:04:09.239> gone

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:09.359 
looks a little bit different it has gone

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:11.960 
looks a little bit different it has gone
from<00:04:09.599> a<00:04:09.780> 5<00:04:10.109> megapixel<00:04:10.379> in<00:04:10.889> the<00:04:10.979> original<00:04:11.159> to<00:04:11.849> an

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:11.970 
from a 5 megapixel in the original to an

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.420 
from a 5 megapixel in the original to an
8<00:04:12.239> megapixel<00:04:12.419> but<00:04:13.319> personally<00:04:13.769> I<00:04:13.949> kind<00:04:14.370> of

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
8 megapixel but personally I kind of

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.210 
8 megapixel but personally I kind of
like<00:04:14.549> that<00:04:14.669> ring<00:04:15.000> around<00:04:15.180> the<00:04:16.079> original<00:04:16.590> as

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
like that ring around the original as

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.270 
like that ring around the original as
you<00:04:17.370> can<00:04:17.489> see<00:04:17.669> here<00:04:18.169> this<00:04:19.169> one<00:04:19.470> does<00:04:20.039> not<00:04:20.220> have

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
you can see here this one does not have

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.339 
you can see here this one does not have
that<00:04:20.669> same<00:04:20.940> ring<00:04:21.209> it<00:04:21.630> kind<00:04:21.870> of<00:04:21.900> just<00:04:22.079> looks<00:04:22.260> a

00:04:22.339 --> 00:04:22.349 
that same ring it kind of just looks a

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:24.140 
that same ring it kind of just looks a
little<00:04:22.770> bit<00:04:22.950> cheap<00:04:23.219> like<00:04:23.460> it<00:04:23.580> was<00:04:23.700> just<00:04:23.789> place

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:24.150 
little bit cheap like it was just place

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.590 
little bit cheap like it was just place
there<00:04:24.510> but<00:04:25.500> um<00:04:25.909> yeah<00:04:26.909> it<00:04:27.180> is

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
there but um yeah it is

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.500 
there but um yeah it is
camera<00:04:28.080> and<00:04:28.260> it<00:04:28.320> definitely<00:04:28.560> does<00:04:28.980> help<00:04:29.220> a<00:04:30.090> key

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
camera and it definitely does help a key

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.540 
camera and it definitely does help a key
thing<00:04:30.780> about<00:04:30.810> the<00:04:31.200> microphone<00:04:31.770> when<00:04:32.190> you<00:04:32.280> do

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
thing about the microphone when you do

thing about the microphone when you do
hold<00:04:32.880> the<00:04:33.090> ipad<00:04:33.510> like<00:04:33.840> so<00:04:34.200> which<00:04:34.890> is<00:04:35.100> how

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:35.850 
hold the ipad like so which is how

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:38.300 
hold the ipad like so which is how
you'll<00:04:36.060> probably<00:04:36.360> do<00:04:36.780> it<00:04:36.860> when<00:04:37.860> you<00:04:37.950> record

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:38.310 
you'll probably do it when you record

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:39.650 
you'll probably do it when you record
something<00:04:38.370> it's<00:04:38.790> covering<00:04:39.090> the<00:04:39.210> microphone

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
something it's covering the microphone

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.340 
something it's covering the microphone
now<00:04:40.650> when<00:04:40.920> you<00:04:41.010> hold<00:04:41.250> it<00:04:41.780> it's<00:04:42.780> not<00:04:42.990> covering

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:43.350 
now when you hold it it's not covering

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:48.350 
now when you hold it it's not covering
anything<00:04:43.470> and<00:04:43.890> that<00:04:44.010> helps<00:04:44.400> a<00:04:44.580> lot<00:04:46.760> but<00:04:47.760> yeah

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
anything and that helps a lot but yeah

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.970 
anything and that helps a lot but yeah

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:49.980 
that's pretty much it there's the

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:52.570 
that's pretty much it there's the
aesthetic<00:04:50.640> comparisons<00:04:51.390> that<00:04:51.540> we<00:04:51.750> have

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
aesthetic comparisons that we have

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:56.600
