00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.029
 good morning good afternoon good night 

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:06.980
 I am queen of chaos and I love you 

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:10.550
 share this information that came to me 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:13.940
 yesterday it was difficult to find 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:17.000
 for my friend because there he found it in 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:20.180
 different internet blogs and in English not 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.600
 well here I share the information 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:26.840
 that gave me in a matter of how they are 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:29.930
 some artists 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:32.500
 in a matter of good work already without 

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:36.170
 macho, the news is here 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.940
 while many cartoon cartons 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.520
 Networks are unique 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.680
 cartoon network producers now of 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.260
 adventure has been the only one that has been 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:47.870
 allowed to create its own creative group 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:52.210
 based on fan jobs and a 

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:52.210
 community of interested animators 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:58.770
 here the issue was reversed in 2012 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:01.320
 cartoon network did not want to continue giving 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.989
 accommodate business partners like hasbro 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:06.750
 so he did not accept to transmit two 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.990
 series of them since their signature is with 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:13.290
 mattel why miley tripoli did not happen in 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.590
 cartoon network lauren went to warner 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.180
 brothers to work on my little pony 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:22.750
 but since they did not give the production 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:26.590
 she resigned and went to disney with her husband 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:29.170
 really ideal 0 it was a money thing 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.780
 all this cartoon networks pulled his 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:34.150
 husband because the man did not want to innovate 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.550
 since in cartoon network he entered the 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:39.520
 generation check-in that is his fifth 

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:41.500
 generation of producers and he did not stay 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.560
 as a leader like the previous two 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.840
 generations and the gentleman went to disney 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.210
 for that reason under the pretext that 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:53.260
 they oppressed their creativity and logically 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:56.630
 I find his wife, that is, they two already 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:59.770
 they work for the disney nazis 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:02.960
 cartoon networks depends on three brands 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:07.520
 torner communications inc owner 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:10.099
 channel apart from the tnt and it is well cartoon 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:14.420
 multimedia network study studies 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:17.220
 of long cardboard and the warner brothers of 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:21.450
 s media company 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:24.140
 these three brands decided not to do 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:28.100
 the series of the hasbro franchise 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.100
 opting for mattel 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:33.160
 conspiracy against producers of 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:35.400
 cartoon network there is no contrary 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.810
 they are trying to be more 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:41.290
 decentralized and give more rein to 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:43.750
 new people since 2011 there is a 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:46.150
 annual contest at the University of 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:49.000
 california animation where the winner 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.799
 you can produce your pilot in cartoon 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.660
 networks 

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:54.010
 Well this is an information medium 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.890
 enemy 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:59.799

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:02.140

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:05.860
 that I can so if you do not understand then 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:08.620
 Do not hesitate to ask this happened in the 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:11.980
 year 2012 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:14.019
 interview with thief fault file this 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.870
 it does not have much to do with my trick and 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:18.819
 although I talk a little about it but it does 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:21.250
 little spoke fault was interviewed 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:22.120
 about the next series that will premiere the 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:25.629
 next month 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:28.120
 laron fault has enchanted us with its 

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:31.180
 work in power point first and in 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:34.390
 marifil puts the magic of friendship and 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:37.060
 now she is immersed in the universe with 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:40.239
 a new series of shorts called super 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:43.209
 best friends forever in which bad girl 

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:46.390
 super see and wonder world come together and 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:48.670
 fight super villains when false 

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:52.120
 I was creating magnitude pony she 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:55.359
 originally wanted me to have to 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:58.150
 had one more tone of adventures already 

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:59.900
 she is excited to have more of that 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:02.989
 here 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:05.569
 have to have fights in a series of 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:08.299
 superheroes says she's not there 

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:10.730
 absolutely not a fight in mali type 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:12.620
 neither she was not upset nor 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:14.930
 disappointed that the aspects of 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:18.709
 action-adventure were minimized 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:21.289
 fagot and it's more like the project 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:24.380
 evolved while she collaborated in 

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:28.460
 he is happy to do more than 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:31.789
 that's here super betts friends forever 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:34.130
 will have a little more adventure a bit 

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:36.740
 more action higher risks and 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:40.760
 higher emotions but still the 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:43.210
 same mood and the same heart of that is 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:46.360
 Cardboard language 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:48.729
 because of scenes john is in charge of 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:52.569
 Jim Lee is a direct producer of 

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:55.000
 dc and best mate got a place 

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:58.240
 of his short films and the project of 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:01.120
 tita index gob in fact they were suspended 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:03.970
 four cartons of blow because of 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:07.750
 scenes john does not agree to do 

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:11.199
 very complex contents since they would lower 

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:15.300
 selling his comics then now 

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:15.300
 they do more fun services than nothing 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:22.030
 well after reading this 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:25.600
 information my friend passed me 

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:28.060
 can conclude that hasbro is there 

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:30.790
 lost if the batteries are not turned on or 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:35.470
 if you do not hire someone just as good 

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:38.410
 that lauren and his collaborators because not 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:42.200
 I doubt very much that we see a fourth 

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:44.930
 sincerely decent season 

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:46.910
 but it's because he did more things more 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:50.500
 that nothing because it had been done well 

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:54.290
 the toys as mandates celestia 

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:57.470
 I would continue to earn no and more if I know 

00:05:54.290 --> 00:06:00.380
 were products conscious benefits 

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:02.020
 to the environment what do I know 

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:04.690
 not this 

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:09.340
 doing things right really no longer 

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:12.819
 you suffer for things like this is not your 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:16.460
 rival mattel what funny I can not 

00:06:12.819 --> 00:06:20.090
 believe it but but yes 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:23.630
 and then it is not that it is voted laure no 

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:26.479
 is that really hasbro already showed us the 

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:30.449
 ability that you have with your with your 

00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:34.139
 movie is a matter of ars 

00:06:30.449 --> 00:06:37.439
 that although they do not want to see it is down 

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:40.110
 of what is acceptable is very bad and if we 

00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:43.620
 they gave this as a movie I can not imagine 

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:45.120
 the fourth season sincerely good 

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:49.699
 you make your own conclusions 

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:49.699
 of this information that I just gave you 

00:06:49.849 --> 00:06:57.770
 and then we talk more at ease going to 

00:06:54.889 --> 00:07:03.550
