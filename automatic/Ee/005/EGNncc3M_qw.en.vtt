00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.520 
beauty supply because I wasn't here my
house<00:02:01.799> I<00:02:02.159> was<00:02:02.520> somewhere<00:02:03.299> else

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
house I was somewhere else

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:18.920 
house I was somewhere else
and<00:02:06.530> this<00:02:12.260> sorry<00:02:13.260> this<00:02:14.060> is<00:02:15.319> awesome<00:02:17.120> and<00:02:18.120> it's

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
smaller it would come up but I think

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.290 
smaller it would come up but I think
it's<00:02:22.440> alright<00:02:22.709> now

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
I was reading the back because it's

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:35.300
