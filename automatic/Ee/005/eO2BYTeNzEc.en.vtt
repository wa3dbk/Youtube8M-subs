to<00:00:19.740> dock<00:00:20.039> your<00:00:20.250> ships<00:00:20.550> then<00:00:20.850> on<00:00:21.300> a<00:00:21.359> shipyard

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:22.189 
to dock your ships then on a shipyard

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:26.170 
to dock your ships then on a shipyard
this<00:00:23.189> is<00:00:23.340> based<00:00:23.640> from<00:00:23.850> a<00:00:24.449> shipyard<00:00:25.050> from

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:26.180 
this is based from a shipyard from

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:28.670 
this is based from a shipyard from
homeworld<00:00:27.180> to<00:00:27.449> a<00:00:27.630> really<00:00:28.050> good<00:00:28.230> game<00:00:28.439> if

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
homeworld to a really good game if

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.360 
homeworld to a really good game if
you're<00:00:29.099> into<00:00:29.630> space<00:00:30.630> RTS<00:00:31.619> games<00:00:32.099> I<00:00:32.930> added<00:00:33.930> some

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:34.370 
you're into space RTS games I added some

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.290 
you're into space RTS games I added some
turrets<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:36.000> defend<00:00:36.390> it<00:00:36.690> from<00:00:38.120> Pirates<00:00:39.120> and

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
turrets to defend it from Pirates and

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.810 
turrets to defend it from Pirates and
other<00:00:39.450> bodies<00:00:39.840> I<00:00:40.110> also<00:00:40.829> have<00:00:41.070> some<00:00:41.250> houses<00:00:41.489> up

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
other bodies I also have some houses up

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.310 
other bodies I also have some houses up
here<00:00:41.850> which<00:00:42.210> are<00:00:42.329> currently<00:00:42.629> empty<00:00:42.930> but<00:00:43.290> I

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
here which are currently empty but I

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.100 
here which are currently empty but I
might<00:00:43.800> fill<00:00:44.040> them<00:00:44.280> with<00:00:44.539> shields<00:00:45.539> or<00:00:45.750> power

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
might fill them with shields or power

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.670 
might fill them with shields or power
blocks<00:00:46.410> and<00:00:47.570> if<00:00:48.570> we<00:00:48.660> go<00:00:48.809> underneath<00:00:49.140> there's

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
blocks and if we go underneath there's

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.389 
blocks and if we go underneath there's
four<00:00:50.039> fighters<00:00:50.340> docked<00:00:51.030> and<00:00:52.160> these<00:00:53.160> fighters

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
four fighters docked and these fighters

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:56.779 
four fighters docked and these fighters
are<00:00:53.610> quick<00:00:53.969> but<00:00:54.270> they<00:00:54.480> have<00:00:54.719> no<00:00:55.020> firepower<00:00:55.789> so

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
are quick but they have no firepower so

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.549 
are quick but they have no firepower so
they're<00:00:56.969> good<00:00:57.120> for<00:00:57.270> traveling<00:00:57.719> not<00:00:58.170> so<00:00:58.350> very

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
they're good for traveling not so very

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.040 
they're good for traveling not so very
good<00:00:58.890> for<00:00:59.190> taking<00:00:59.850> our<00:00:59.969> pilots<00:01:00.359> some<00:01:00.840> more

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050

and if we go to the other and off the
shipyard<00:02:10.229> I<00:02:10.410> will<00:02:10.709> show<00:02:10.920> you<00:02:10.979> what<00:02:11.220> this<00:02:11.459> on

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
shipyard I will show you what this on

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.290 
shipyard I will show you what this on
that<00:02:11.879> side

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
that side

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.090 
that side

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
going to the ship got to travel bit

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.270 
going to the ship got to travel bit
faster<00:02:16.810> that<00:02:17.810> is<00:02:18.110> Plex<00:02:18.530> lifters<00:02:19.010> in<00:02:19.160> the

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
faster that is Plex lifters in the
