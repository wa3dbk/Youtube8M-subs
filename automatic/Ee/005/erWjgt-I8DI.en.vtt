00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:14.380
 halo has friend flavio simonetti here 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:16.449
 a few months ago I last 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:18.489
 made a book review that is how 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:20.259
 When the book is spoken that more 

00:00:18.489 --> 00:00:21.819
 exceptionally well-liked had the 

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:23.710
 book that has in hand now has that 

00:00:21.819 --> 00:00:26.529
 I'm a bit surprised that I am so 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.630
 as a favorite my last ten books 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:30.339
 selected for one 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.079
 of which I do not normally people 

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:33.340
 I have kept a lot 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:35.800
 but with a lot of recommendations 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:38.950
 said good problem that anyway 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:41.050
 and it's about donald trump there 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:44.260
 Trump may know another one 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:46.780
 a billionaire in new york 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.790
 real estate transactions has become rich 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:51.160
 and he has also defeated some 

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:53.200
 that means he has become more of him 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.420
 through real estate and then there was one 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.430
 real estate crisis and heart accomplished with 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.440
 a billion in the chalk 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.940
 So I believe most of us 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.269
 they already have massive difficulties 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.719
 times 10 100 1000 euro in difficulties 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:07.119
 become 

00:01:04.719 --> 00:01:10.359
 he did it for a billion 

00:01:07.119 --> 00:01:12.579
 to show the thing and the whole 

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:13.929
 to bring back into the plus-range 

00:01:12.579 --> 00:01:16.619
 not just a few million should then 

00:01:13.929 --> 00:01:19.270
 to become the media again so 50 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:22.929
 a really interesting history to it 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:26.530
 You are a very extrovert person 

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:29.079
 the one who goes out strong and one 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.069
 it does not circumscribe 

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:32.740
 for each 

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:34.749
 nevertheless I got and was 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.659
 really surprised because he has one here 

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:42.819
 book written zenga zenga is one 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:44.469
 the seminars give seminars 

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:48.759
 and then he has a bit here 

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:50.619
 tells how he with ontram volley inside 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:52.779
 have read a book said people 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:55.240
 Germany I definitely want as 

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:57.369
 have a speaker at a seminar and 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:01.179
 his seminars were not really big 

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:04.319
 world expo is I think I do not know 

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:06.950
 As the seminar at is definitely 

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:09.899
 learning and learning 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.490
 and then donald trump polen where 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.260
 then the 10,000 started i believe 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.240
 20,000 euros 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.450
 the cgt mean sorry then 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:20.930
 hundreds of thousands through 250,000 first 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.670
 million has said that 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.560
 secretary, so to speak, and has agreed 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.330
 the concern passed on 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.280
 and when he finally donald trump on 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.690
 Apparat said so managed 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:35.100
 he did not really know again 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:36.420
 a young boy has indeed for 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.970
 People are talking there at all 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.100
 but he has in common with 2000 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.860
 maybe okay after the start 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:46.380
 if we believe 20 130 thousand people 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:49.880
 we'll talk about or we'll talk 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.930
 then we have a goal or talk 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.790
 Of course you want something 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.100
 Firstly, it does not overwhelm anyone millions 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.790
 was had and secondly, it was Seminars 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:01.380
 relatively small so relatively I say 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.540
 Thousands of people were already 2000 that is 

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:05.519
 very good number and then had to 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.319
 He suddenly starts to think about calling 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:09.209
 get over half donald trump 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:12.110
 and he ultimately 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:15.090
 managed a typical American 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:17.489
 tell her the whole story, of course 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.570
 makes interesting again but has it 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:21.570
 Finally it did it 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:23.970
 these 20 to 30,000 people on one 

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:26.209
 to get an event and that was 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.260
 before the quantum leap in the life of 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:30.720
 schenker probably noticed what it was 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:32.160
 actually means thinking big and 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.440
 donald trump has a little bit of it for him 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.600
 Germany has some here 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.190
 govern what you can do to live 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.910
 very many to become successful 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.350
 Examples 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.989
 I do not sign everything 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:45.390
 automatically but I think most of it 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:47.070
 definitely good and can do the most 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.380
 Sign in any case and this 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:51.810
 Buch really helped me with that 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:54.180
 not to think big again all vision 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.980
 only for one to think on two 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:59.820
 three levels further than that is it 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:01.380
 forth much easier and the people 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.269
 Now I say yes I want your idea 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:05.400
 invest in it to win if I have 

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:07.260
 start to have a little idea and 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.680
 big people in front of a small vision 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.629
 then I can tell 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.400
 people do not like that and that 

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:14.859
 Buch really helped me with that 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:18.669
 think again to remember what it is 

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:21.910
 means to have this other level 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:25.960
 Consider a billion - is 1000 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:27.370
 million and most of them 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.289
 from us if you are much earlier 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:32.169
 in the head just through and now 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:34.630
 managed that big thinking that again 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:36.009
 whole worthwhile to bring and that is so 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:38.050
 that interesting so if the big one 

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:40.419
 then you have to think about difficulties 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.880
 what do you have to do around the whole thing again 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:44.710
 to steer around here again 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:47.050
 to become successful and there it is 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:48.970
 book of gold frame very good if you 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.280
 do you realize you're a tweak I get 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:54.130
 I need more motivation and wants 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:57.099
 it really learns how it goes on 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:59.080
 what is needed to succeed 

00:04:57.099 --> 00:05:00.789
 and there I find this book also from 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.680
 I do not like the title at all 

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:04.599
 do not blob cuddle for you really 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:10.030
 stupid and then, despite that, was on the 

00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:12.099
 piste say is a angeber billionaire 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:13.990
 but the book comes over me 

00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:16.750
 surprised and that's why I have it 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:19.860
 four and a half out of five stars where I say 

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:21.970
