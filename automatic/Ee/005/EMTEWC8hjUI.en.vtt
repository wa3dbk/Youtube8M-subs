00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.880 
you want to play and there's a fairly
large<00:01:54.299> library<00:01:54.869> so<00:01:55.110> I<00:01:55.140> can<00:01:55.380> almost<00:01:55.500> assume

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
large library so I can almost assume

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.139 
large library so I can almost assume
that<00:01:56.070> if<00:01:56.130> you<00:01:56.189> think<00:01:56.610> of<00:01:56.759> it<00:01:56.880> you'll<00:01:57.000> probably

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
that if you think of it you'll probably

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.880 
that if you think of it you'll probably
find<00:01:57.479> it<00:01:58.310> but<00:01:59.310> uh<00:02:00.140> yeah<00:02:01.140> this<00:02:01.290> games<00:02:01.530> a<00:02:01.680> lot

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
find it but uh yeah this games a lot

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.700 
find it but uh yeah this games a lot
more<00:02:02.189> difficult<00:02:02.670> when<00:02:03.180> you're<00:02:03.990> commentating

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:09.809 

but

00:02:09.809 --> 00:02:09.819 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:13.890 

yeah<00:02:10.560> so<00:02:11.560> I<00:02:11.950> guess<00:02:12.459> no<00:02:12.819> really<00:02:13.599> have<00:02:13.720> anything

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:13.900

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.030 
yeah so I guess no really have anything

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
background it's actually a really cool

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.610 
background it's actually a really cool
video<00:02:18.519> if<00:02:19.000> you've<00:02:19.299> ever<00:02:19.540> if<00:02:20.170> you<00:02:20.349> haven't

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:20.620 
video if you've ever if you haven't

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.309 
video if you've ever if you haven't
looked<00:02:20.980> it<00:02:21.159> up<00:02:21.870> there<00:02:22.870> we<00:02:22.959> go

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
looked it up there we go

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:26.880 
looked it up there we go
I<00:02:23.579> had<00:02:24.579> to<00:02:24.640> move<00:02:24.760> my<00:02:24.819> arm<00:02:25.470> it's<00:02:26.470> a<00:02:26.530> really<00:02:26.769> cool

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
I had to move my arm it's a really cool

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.059 
I had to move my arm it's a really cool
video<00:02:27.099> it<00:02:27.489> starts<00:02:28.120> off<00:02:28.269> with<00:02:28.299> an<00:02:29.110> apple<00:02:29.950> and

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
video it starts off with an apple and

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:32.280 
video it starts off with an apple and
that's<00:02:30.190> why<00:02:30.280> I<00:02:30.340> felt<00:02:30.610> that<00:02:30.849> Apple<00:02:31.209> but<00:02:32.049> it<00:02:32.260> uh

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
that's why I felt that Apple but it uh

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:37.589 
that's why I felt that Apple but it uh
it<00:02:32.829> slowly<00:02:34.319> uses<00:02:35.319> this<00:02:35.769> very<00:02:36.190> thing<00:02:37.030> almost

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599 
it slowly uses this very thing almost

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:42.180 
it slowly uses this very thing almost
beautiful<00:02:39.060> shader<00:02:40.439> not<00:02:41.439> shader<00:02:41.709> but<00:02:41.980> like

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
beautiful shader not shader but like

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.069 
beautiful shader not shader but like
shading<00:02:42.819> system<00:02:43.030> where<00:02:43.510> everything's<00:02:43.870> just

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:44.079 
shading system where everything's just

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:50.059 
shading system where everything's just
black<00:02:44.260> and<00:02:44.440> white<00:02:44.730> but<00:02:45.730> it'll<00:02:46.299> start<00:02:46.569> off<00:02:47.129> and

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
black and white but it'll start off and

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:54.080 
black and white but it'll start off and
every<00:02:51.069> transition<00:02:51.519> is<00:02:52.260> from<00:02:53.260> the<00:02:53.409> previous

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
every transition is from the previous

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.369 
every transition is from the previous
every<00:02:55.090> transition<00:02:55.629> to<00:02:55.750> the<00:02:55.840> next<00:02:55.959> kind<00:02:56.230> of

00:02:56.369 --> 00:02:56.379 
every transition to the next kind of

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:59.970 
every transition to the next kind of
scene<00:02:56.709> so<00:02:57.340> to<00:02:57.400> say<00:02:57.609> it<00:02:58.569> goes<00:02:59.109> right<00:02:59.379> on<00:02:59.560> to<00:02:59.799> the

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
scene so to say it goes right on to the

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:07.379 
scene so to say it goes right on to the
next<00:03:02.040> okay<00:03:03.040> it<00:03:03.670> goes<00:03:03.790> on<00:03:04.000> to<00:03:04.150> the<00:03:04.180> next<00:03:06.299> kind<00:03:07.299> of

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:07.389 
next okay it goes on to the next kind of

00:03:07.389 --> 00:03:12.539 
next okay it goes on to the next kind of
picture<00:03:07.720> thing<00:03:09.000> from<00:03:10.000> the<00:03:10.120> one<00:03:10.269> see<00:03:11.549> but

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:12.549 
picture thing from the one see but

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:14.670 
picture thing from the one see but
that's<00:03:13.359> that's<00:03:13.959> not<00:03:14.139> the<00:03:14.260> only<00:03:14.319> thing<00:03:14.470> I

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:14.680 
that's that's not the only thing I

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.879 
that's that's not the only thing I
actually<00:03:14.889> find<00:03:15.489> cool<00:03:15.760> that<00:03:16.169> it<00:03:17.169> still<00:03:17.769> has

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:17.889 
actually find cool that it still has

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:21.059 
actually find cool that it still has
this<00:03:18.040> also<00:03:18.310> like<00:03:19.109> 3d<00:03:20.109> feel<00:03:20.410> even<00:03:20.829> though<00:03:20.919> it's

00:03:21.059 --> 00:03:21.069 
this also like 3d feel even though it's

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:22.890 
this also like 3d feel even though it's
just<00:03:21.220> black<00:03:21.519> and<00:03:21.699> white<00:03:21.819> so<00:03:22.389> there's<00:03:22.569> a<00:03:22.629> lot<00:03:22.780> of

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
just black and white so there's a lot of

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.490 
just black and white so there's a lot of
depth<00:03:23.220> involved<00:03:24.220> in<00:03:24.370> it

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
depth involved in it

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:28.750 
depth involved in it
this<00:03:27.500> video<00:03:27.740> is<00:03:27.800> gonna<00:03:27.950> be<00:03:28.070> fairly<00:03:28.460> short
