00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:13.060 
then you basically need to make the

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:16.260 
then you basically need to make the
diaphragm<00:00:13.660> which<00:00:14.500> is<00:00:14.710> the<00:00:14.890> balloon<00:00:15.220> with<00:00:15.730> the

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:16.270 
diaphragm which is the balloon with the

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.920 
diaphragm which is the balloon with the
pop<00:00:16.450> lid<00:00:16.690> on<00:00:16.810> it<00:00:16.990> and<00:00:17.460> on<00:00:18.460> the<00:00:18.490> inside<00:00:19.420> of<00:00:19.450> the

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:19.930 
pop lid on it and on the inside of the

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:23.340 
pop lid on it and on the inside of the
balloon<00:00:20.200> there's<00:00:20.740> um<00:00:21.130> the<00:00:21.700> little<00:00:22.420> square<00:00:22.900> the

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:23.350 
balloon there's um the little square the

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:24.900 
balloon there's um the little square the
that's<00:00:23.680> up<00:00:23.830> from<00:00:23.920> a<00:00:24.070> bike<00:00:24.220> inner<00:00:24.460> tube<00:00:24.490> and

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:24.910 
that's up from a bike inner tube and

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.740 
that's up from a bike inner tube and
it's<00:00:26.730> just<00:00:27.730> a<00:00:27.820> small<00:00:28.090> square<00:00:28.330> you'll<00:00:28.509> see<00:00:28.660> on

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:28.750 
it's just a small square you'll see on

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:30.420 
it's just a small square you'll see on
the<00:00:28.840> website<00:00:28.990> it's<00:00:29.529> a<00:00:29.619> small<00:00:29.830> square<00:00:30.099> it<00:00:30.279> goes

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:30.430 
the website it's a small square it goes

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:31.920 
the website it's a small square it goes
in<00:00:30.580> the<00:00:30.669> middle<00:00:30.970> of<00:00:31.090> the<00:00:31.150> balloon<00:00:31.540> on<00:00:31.869> the

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:31.930 
in the middle of the balloon on the

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:33.800 
in the middle of the balloon on the
other<00:00:32.529> side<00:00:32.740> you<00:00:32.829> super<00:00:33.130> glue<00:00:33.310> it<00:00:33.430> and<00:00:33.460> then

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:33.810 
other side you super glue it and then

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:37.290 
other side you super glue it and then
once<00:00:34.810> you<00:00:34.990> have<00:00:35.110> glued<00:00:35.590> the<00:00:36.040> pop<00:00:36.670> lid<00:00:36.910> on<00:00:37.060> to

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:37.300 
once you have glued the pop lid on to

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.750 
once you have glued the pop lid on to
the<00:00:37.390> top<00:00:37.570> of<00:00:37.600> that<00:00:37.810> you<00:00:38.320> just<00:00:38.440> take<00:00:38.560> a<00:00:38.760> needle

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:39.760 
the top of that you just take a needle

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.610 
the top of that you just take a needle
basically<00:00:40.510> the<00:00:40.570> needle<00:00:40.870> through<00:00:40.900> there<00:00:41.320> and

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:41.620 
basically the needle through there and

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.350 
basically the needle through there and
that<00:00:42.040> creates<00:00:42.340> the<00:00:42.490> hole<00:00:42.670> for<00:00:42.880> this<00:00:43.000> fishing

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:43.360 
that creates the hole for this fishing

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.340 
that creates the hole for this fishing
line<00:00:43.390> which<00:00:43.960> will<00:00:44.170> connect<00:00:44.590> to<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:46.390> steel

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.350 
line which will connect to the steel

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:50.340 
line which will connect to the steel
wool<00:00:47.590> which<00:00:48.460> is<00:00:48.610> wired<00:00:48.820> on<00:00:49.030> the<00:00:49.120> inside<00:00:49.510> and

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 
wool which is wired on the inside and

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.350 
wool which is wired on the inside and
once<00:00:50.560> again<00:00:50.680> I<00:00:50.920> mean<00:00:51.160> this<00:00:51.850> is<00:00:52.030> just<00:00:52.060> a<00:00:52.240> basic

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:52.360 
once again I mean this is just a basic

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:53.970 
once again I mean this is just a basic
run<00:00:52.720> through<00:00:52.930> you'll<00:00:53.110> see<00:00:53.260> all<00:00:53.380> the<00:00:53.500> specific

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:53.980 
run through you'll see all the specific

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:55.950 
run through you'll see all the specific
steps<00:00:54.220> on<00:00:54.430> the<00:00:54.550> website<00:00:54.970> if<00:00:55.390> you<00:00:55.600> choose<00:00:55.810> to

steps on the website if you choose to
build<00:00:56.140> one<00:00:59.430> once<00:01:00.430> you<00:01:00.580> have<00:01:00.760> the<00:01:01.120> diaphragm

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:01.660 
build one once you have the diaphragm

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.900 
build one once you have the diaphragm
made<00:01:01.900> it<00:01:02.080> fits<00:01:02.590> over<00:01:02.800> it's<00:01:03.040> just<00:01:03.250> a<00:01:03.400> regular

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:03.910 
made it fits over it's just a regular

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:10.990 
them out of it off and then you stretch

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:12.990 
them out of it off and then you stretch
it<00:01:11.020> over<00:01:11.200> the<00:01:11.500> the<00:01:12.070> balloon<00:01:12.400> to<00:01:12.729> glue<00:01:12.880> the

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.749 
the steel wool and it's got a hook on it
and<00:01:25.869> it's<00:01:26.020> going<00:01:26.140> to<00:01:26.200> spool<00:01:26.740> at<00:01:26.859> the<00:01:26.950> bottom<00:01:27.219> so

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:27.759 
and it's going to spool at the bottom so

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:30.029 
and it's going to spool at the bottom so
that<00:01:27.840> the<00:01:28.840> the<00:01:29.229> fishing<00:01:29.499> line<00:01:29.530> is<00:01:29.649> attached

00:01:30.029 --> 00:01:30.039 
that the the fishing line is attached

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:31.980 
that the the fishing line is attached
that<00:01:30.249> wire<00:01:30.520> and<00:01:30.880> it<00:01:30.969> causes<00:01:31.210> the<00:01:31.450> whole<00:01:31.689> thing

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
that wire and it causes the whole thing

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.870 
that wire and it causes the whole thing
to<00:01:32.140> move<00:01:32.289> up<00:01:32.469> and<00:01:32.649> down<00:01:32.740> as<00:01:33.159> this<00:01:33.399> moves<00:01:33.670> up<00:01:33.789> and

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
to move up and down as this moves up and

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.410 
to move up and down as this moves up and
down<00:01:35.460> the<00:01:36.460> hardest<00:01:36.850> part<00:01:36.999> of<00:01:37.149> this<00:01:37.210> project

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
down the hardest part of this project

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.029 
down the hardest part of this project
was<00:01:38.229> making<00:01:38.590> the<00:01:38.679> crank<00:01:38.950> system<00:01:39.159> and<00:01:39.639> I<00:01:40.060> I<00:01:41.039> used

00:01:42.029 --> 00:01:42.039 
was making the crank system and I I used

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:44.550 
was making the crank system and I I used
tire<00:01:43.030> spokes<00:01:43.450> which<00:01:43.689> the<00:01:43.869> website<00:01:44.229> that<00:01:44.439> you

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 
tire spokes which the website that you

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.859 
tire spokes which the website that you
said<00:01:44.859> you<00:01:44.979> could<00:01:45.189> I<00:01:45.460> didn't<00:01:46.240> have<00:01:46.359> any<00:01:46.539> copper

00:01:46.859 --> 00:01:46.869 
said you could I didn't have any copper

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:48.510 
said you could I didn't have any copper
wire<00:01:47.049> on<00:01:47.319> me<00:01:47.350> that<00:01:47.889> was<00:01:48.039> the<00:01:48.159> right<00:01:48.280> thickness

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:48.520 
wire on me that was the right thickness

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.389 
wire on me that was the right thickness
and<00:01:48.880> if<00:01:49.659> you<00:01:49.840> if<00:01:50.109> you<00:01:50.259> do<00:01:50.380> it<00:01:50.469> yourself<00:01:50.530> use<00:01:51.189> the

00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:51.399 
and if you if you do it yourself use the

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:52.919 
and if you if you do it yourself use the
copper<00:01:51.670> wire<00:01:51.850> it's<00:01:52.060> a<00:01:52.149> lot<00:01:52.329> easier<00:01:52.359> to<00:01:52.780> work

00:01:52.919 --> 00:01:52.929 
copper wire it's a lot easier to work

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:55.080 
copper wire it's a lot easier to work
with<00:01:52.990> they<00:01:53.350> say<00:01:53.590> and<00:01:53.829> the<00:01:54.310> spokes<00:01:54.609> was<00:01:54.819> very

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
with they say and the spokes was very

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.789 
with they say and the spokes was very
hard<00:01:55.299> to<00:01:55.359> work<00:01:55.539> with<00:01:55.689> it's<00:01:55.959> one<00:01:56.649> of<00:01:56.740> the

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:56.799 
hard to work with it's one of the

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:58.649 
hard to work with it's one of the
reasons<00:01:56.889> why<00:01:57.159> my<00:01:57.340> my<00:01:57.729> cocaine<00:01:58.240> engine<00:01:58.509> doesn't

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:58.659 
reasons why my my cocaine engine doesn't

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:01.789 
reasons why my my cocaine engine doesn't
work<00:01:58.899> as<00:01:59.079> well<00:01:59.109> as<00:01:59.319> I<00:01:59.560> would<00:01:59.829> like<00:02:00.009> for<00:02:00.069> it<00:02:00.310> to

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
work as well as I would like for it to

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.539 
work as well as I would like for it to
the<00:02:02.799> crank<00:02:03.039> system<00:02:03.219> is<00:02:03.639> made<00:02:05.009> you<00:02:06.009> you<00:02:06.310> drill

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:06.549 
the crank system is made you you drill

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:09.109 
the crank system is made you you drill
holes<00:02:06.789> through<00:02:06.969> this<00:02:07.569> pop<00:02:07.869> lid<00:02:08.140> so<00:02:08.560> that<00:02:08.590> thick

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
holes through this pop lid so that thick

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.340 
holes through this pop lid so that thick
the<00:02:10.119> crank<00:02:10.420> can<00:02:10.600> go<00:02:10.720> through<00:02:10.899> there<00:02:11.080> and<00:02:11.230> then

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:11.350 
the crank can go through there and then

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:12.900 
the crank can go through there and then
the<00:02:11.500> hole<00:02:11.860> in<00:02:12.010> the<00:02:12.069> middle<00:02:12.190> of<00:02:12.370> it<00:02:12.520> so<00:02:12.700> that

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
the hole in the middle of it so that

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:14.760 
the hole in the middle of it so that
your<00:02:13.569> fishing<00:02:13.930> line<00:02:14.050> can<00:02:14.230> go<00:02:14.319> through<00:02:14.500> it<00:02:14.560> and

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
your fishing line can go through it and

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.000 
your fishing line can go through it and
then<00:02:15.730> that<00:02:16.150> is<00:02:16.360> connected<00:02:16.660> by<00:02:17.230> these<00:02:17.290> little

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
then that is connected by these little

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.210 
then that is connected by these little
things<00:02:18.040> to<00:02:18.370> these<00:02:18.489> electrical<00:02:19.150> connectors

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
things to these electrical connectors

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.440 
things to these electrical connectors
is<00:02:20.400> what<00:02:20.640> they're<00:02:20.760> called<00:02:20.940> you<00:02:21.120> can<00:02:21.270> order

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
is what they're called you can order

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.900 
is what they're called you can order
them<00:02:21.630> off<00:02:21.780> of<00:02:21.930> Google<00:02:22.380> if<00:02:23.130> you<00:02:23.250> just<00:02:23.400> type<00:02:23.520> in<00:02:23.760> I

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
them off of Google if you just type in I

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.240 
them off of Google if you just type in I
think<00:02:24.120> like<00:02:24.240> electrical<00:02:24.950> connector<00:02:25.950> terminal

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
think like electrical connector terminal

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.010 
think like electrical connector terminal

a<00:02:36.450> comic<00:02:36.690> like<00:02:36.810> 15<00:02:37.140> or<00:02:37.200> 16<00:02:37.850> no<00:02:38.850> more<00:02:39.120> than<00:02:39.180> that

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
a comic like 15 or 16 no more than that

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:40.370 
a comic like 15 or 16 no more than that
oh<00:02:39.330> it'll<00:02:39.600> come<00:02:39.750> with<00:02:39.810> quite<00:02:39.990> a<00:02:40.050> few<00:02:40.080> of<00:02:40.230> those

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
oh it'll come with quite a few of those

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.140 
oh it'll come with quite a few of those
little<00:02:40.590> ones<00:02:40.770> but<00:02:41.280> you<00:02:41.340> only<00:02:41.520> need<00:02:41.700> four<00:02:42.060> of

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
little ones but you only need four of

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.080 
little ones but you only need four of
them<00:02:42.330> I<00:02:42.590> had<00:02:43.590> to<00:02:43.710> use<00:02:43.740> probably<00:02:44.190> 10<00:02:44.670> or<00:02:44.700> 12

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
them I had to use probably 10 or 12

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.040 
them I had to use probably 10 or 12
because<00:02:45.210> I<00:02:45.360> kept<00:02:45.570> breaking<00:02:45.810> them<00:02:45.840> when<00:02:46.020> I

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
because I kept breaking them when I

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.080 
because I kept breaking them when I
drilled<00:02:46.440> and<00:02:47.040> what<00:02:47.160> you'll<00:02:47.310> do<00:02:47.430> with<00:02:47.550> those<00:02:47.760> is

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
drilled and what you'll do with those is

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.620 
drilled and what you'll do with those is
you'll<00:02:48.300> see<00:02:48.480> they<00:02:48.630> come<00:02:48.870> like<00:02:49.350> that<00:02:49.710> and<00:02:50.010> then

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
you'll see they come like that and then

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.940 
you'll see they come like that and then
that<00:02:51.630> one's<00:02:51.810> that<00:02:51.930> sounds<00:02:52.410> a<00:02:52.470> full<00:02:52.680> when<00:02:52.830> it's

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
that one's that sounds a full when it's

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:54.530 
that one's that sounds a full when it's
going<00:02:53.070> to<00:02:53.130> hole<00:02:53.310> in<00:02:53.430> it<00:02:53.550> put<00:02:53.790> them<00:02:53.940> up<00:02:54.060> here<00:02:54.090> you

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
going to hole in it put them up here you

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:55.910 
going to hole in it put them up here you
can<00:02:54.660> see<00:02:54.810> those<00:02:55.020> ones<00:02:55.170> have<00:02:55.290> holes<00:02:55.590> drilled<00:02:55.860> in

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
can see those ones have holes drilled in

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.530 
can see those ones have holes drilled in
them<00:02:56.100> so<00:02:56.400> that<00:02:56.430> the<00:02:56.610> crank<00:02:56.910> can<00:02:57.209> run<00:02:57.330> through

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
them so that the crank can run through

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.650 
them so that the crank can run through
there<00:02:58.430> so<00:02:59.430> you'll<00:02:59.610> need<00:02:59.730> to<00:02:59.790> connect<00:03:00.360> all<00:03:00.600> of

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
there so you'll need to connect all of

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:05.690 
there so you'll need to connect all of
the<00:03:01.370> the<00:03:02.370> cranks<00:03:03.800> they<00:03:04.800> that<00:03:05.280> you<00:03:05.400> can<00:03:05.550> put

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
the the cranks they that you can put

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:06.800 
the the cranks they that you can put
them<00:03:05.790> right<00:03:05.880> in<00:03:06.000> the<00:03:06.030> in<00:03:06.180> and<00:03:06.330> screw<00:03:06.510> those<00:03:06.630> on

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
them right in the in and screw those on

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.860 
them right in the in and screw those on
so<00:03:07.080> that's<00:03:07.590> how<00:03:07.800> that<00:03:07.860> is<00:03:08.100> connected<00:03:08.550> and<00:03:08.640> then

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
so that's how that is connected and then

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.880 
so that's how that is connected and then
once<00:03:09.870> again<00:03:10.140> you'll<00:03:10.410> find<00:03:10.650> step-by-step

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:10.890 
once again you'll find step-by-step

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:13.699 
once again you'll find step-by-step
process<00:03:11.790> of<00:03:11.880> how<00:03:12.000> to<00:03:12.060> bend<00:03:12.690> the<00:03:12.810> crank<00:03:13.110> and<00:03:13.290> you

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
process of how to bend the crank and you

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:14.900 
process of how to bend the crank and you
want<00:03:13.860> to<00:03:13.920> be<00:03:14.010> really<00:03:14.160> precise<00:03:14.610> when<00:03:14.790> you've

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
want to be really precise when you've

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.190 
want to be really precise when you've
been<00:03:15.030> that<00:03:15.209> crank<00:03:15.450> because<00:03:15.750> that's<00:03:15.930> another

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
been that crank because that's another

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.410 
been that crank because that's another
room<00:03:16.410> for<00:03:16.620> error<00:03:16.740> that<00:03:16.920> I<00:03:16.950> have<00:03:17.240> it's<00:03:18.240> not

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
room for error that I have it's not

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.000 
room for error that I have it's not
quite<00:03:18.690> straight<00:03:19.080> and<00:03:19.290> so<00:03:19.410> it<00:03:19.560> causes<00:03:19.770> friction

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
quite straight and so it causes friction

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:22.070 
quite straight and so it causes friction
when<00:03:20.670> it's<00:03:20.760> trying<00:03:20.940> to<00:03:21.000> turn<00:03:21.180> and<00:03:21.420> that<00:03:21.540> stops

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
when it's trying to turn and that stops

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.970 
when it's trying to turn and that stops
it<00:03:22.260> from<00:03:22.290> turning<00:03:22.530> as<00:03:22.740> well<00:03:23.600> so<00:03:24.739> there's<00:03:25.739> two

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:25.980 
it from turning as well so there's two

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:27.350 
it from turning as well so there's two
separate<00:03:26.280> cranks<00:03:26.580> and<00:03:26.640> they're<00:03:26.790> connected<00:03:27.239> by

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:27.360 
separate cranks and they're connected by

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.290 
separate cranks and they're connected by
the<00:03:27.420> wires<00:03:27.920> you'll<00:03:28.920> see<00:03:29.040> i<00:03:29.070> use<00:03:29.280> tire<00:03:29.910> spokes

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
the wires you'll see i use tire spokes

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:31.790 
the wires you'll see i use tire spokes
for<00:03:30.510> all<00:03:30.660> of<00:03:30.810> it<00:03:30.930> it<00:03:31.080> was<00:03:31.200> hard<00:03:31.380> to<00:03:31.440> work<00:03:31.620> with

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 
for all of it it was hard to work with

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.860 
for all of it it was hard to work with
but<00:03:32.160> it<00:03:32.550> did<00:03:33.120> work<00:03:33.390> pretty<00:03:33.660> well<00:03:34.430> and<00:03:35.430> then<00:03:35.870> i

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
but it did work pretty well and then i

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.280 
but it did work pretty well and then i
also<00:03:36.900> use<00:03:37.290> this<00:03:37.910> the<00:03:38.910> what<00:03:39.360> what's<00:03:39.690> running

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
also use this the what what's running

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.210 
also use this the what what's running
through<00:03:40.620> the<00:03:41.010> big<00:03:42.080> sprocket<00:03:43.080> the<00:03:43.800> whatever

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
through the big sprocket the whatever

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.120 
through the big sprocket the whatever
it's<00:03:44.340> called<00:03:44.459> it<00:03:45.000> is<00:03:45.390> a<00:03:46.019> stroke<00:03:46.500> nipple<00:03:46.860> from<00:03:47.040> a

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
it's called it is a stroke nipple from a

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:48.380 
it's called it is a stroke nipple from a
tire<00:03:47.370> and<00:03:47.400> what<00:03:47.880> you<00:03:47.940> have<00:03:48.060> to<00:03:48.120> do<00:03:48.209> is<00:03:48.300> you<00:03:48.360> have

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
tire and what you have to do is you have

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.120 
tire and what you have to do is you have
to<00:03:48.510> take<00:03:48.630> the<00:03:48.750> inner<00:03:48.959> tube<00:03:49.230> off<00:03:49.410> of<00:03:49.560> a<00:03:49.650> tire<00:03:49.890> and

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:50.130 
to take the inner tube off of a tire and

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.130 
to take the inner tube off of a tire and
then<00:03:50.820> you'll<00:03:51.299> see<00:03:51.480> just<00:03:51.510> a<00:03:51.780> bunch<00:03:51.959> of<00:03:52.019> they

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
then you'll see just a bunch of they

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:53.810 
then you'll see just a bunch of they
almost<00:03:52.290> look<00:03:52.470> like<00:03:52.530> screws<00:03:53.010> but<00:03:53.610> they're

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
almost look like screws but they're

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:54.949 
almost look like screws but they're
they've<00:03:54.120> got<00:03:54.269> you<00:03:54.420> know<00:03:54.450> their<00:03:54.630> Hall<00:03:54.780> on<00:03:54.930> the

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
they've got you know their Hall on the

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:56.870 
they've got you know their Hall on the
inside<00:03:55.260> so<00:03:55.380> that<00:03:55.440> spokeo<00:03:55.680> engine<00:03:56.010> unscrew

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
inside so that spokeo engine unscrew

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:58.880 
inside so that spokeo engine unscrew
those<00:03:57.090> and<00:03:57.510> then<00:03:58.019> you'll<00:03:58.290> have<00:03:58.380> to<00:03:58.590> use<00:03:58.739> your

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
those and then you'll have to use your

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:03.080 
those and then you'll have to use your
drill<00:03:59.250> to<00:03:59.519> drill<00:03:59.549> those<00:03:59.880> two<00:04:00.180> and<00:04:01.820> that<00:04:02.820> is

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:03.090 
drill to drill those two and that is

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:05.240 
drill to drill those two and that is
what<00:04:03.299> it<00:04:03.510> runs<00:04:03.750> through<00:04:03.870> you've<00:04:04.650> got<00:04:04.890> then

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
what it runs through you've got then

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.670 
what it runs through you've got then
you've<00:04:05.400> got<00:04:05.580> you<00:04:06.120> buy<00:04:06.269> a<00:04:06.299> dowel<00:04:06.630> and<00:04:06.959> like<00:04:07.620> I

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
you've got you buy a dowel and like I

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:08.780 
you've got you buy a dowel and like I
said<00:04:07.769> on<00:04:07.890> the<00:04:07.950> website<00:04:08.070> the<00:04:08.400> doll<00:04:08.549> was<00:04:08.730> a

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
said on the website the doll was a

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.150 
said on the website the doll was a
little<00:04:09.090> bit<00:04:09.209> too<00:04:09.360> big<00:04:09.540> for<00:04:09.780> the<00:04:09.900> cds<00:04:10.260> which<00:04:11.010> is

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:11.160 
little bit too big for the cds which is

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:13.850 
little bit too big for the cds which is
what<00:04:11.310> the<00:04:11.489> wing<00:04:11.970> mechanism<00:04:12.510> is<00:04:12.680> so<00:04:13.680> you'll

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
what the wing mechanism is so you'll

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.030 
what the wing mechanism is so you'll
have<00:04:13.950> to<00:04:14.040> sand<00:04:14.459> at<00:04:14.700> the<00:04:14.790> del<00:04:15.320> you<00:04:16.320> know<00:04:16.350> just<00:04:16.890> I

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 
have to sand at the del you know just I

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.070 
have to sand at the del you know just I
usually<00:04:17.669> I<00:04:17.700> hand<00:04:18.090> sanded<00:04:18.450> it<00:04:18.540> which<00:04:18.690> took<00:04:18.870> a

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:19.080 
usually I hand sanded it which took a

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:21.320 
usually I hand sanded it which took a
long<00:04:19.320> time<00:04:19.350> and<00:04:19.950> I<00:04:20.459> just<00:04:20.669> twisted<00:04:20.940> the<00:04:21.180> doll

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:21.330 
long time and I just twisted the doll

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:23.150 
long time and I just twisted the doll
back<00:04:21.359> and<00:04:21.630> forth<00:04:21.840> and<00:04:22.109> you<00:04:22.620> can<00:04:22.800> see<00:04:22.890> I've<00:04:23.010> got

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
back and forth and you can see I've got

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.640 
back and forth and you can see I've got
three<00:04:23.430> CDs<00:04:23.880> hot<00:04:24.270> glued<00:04:24.479> together<00:04:24.690> and<00:04:25.140> then

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:25.650 
three CDs hot glued together and then

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:30.170 
three CDs hot glued together and then
they're<00:04:25.800> hot<00:04:26.040> glued<00:04:26.310> onto<00:04:26.580> the<00:04:26.940> Dow<00:04:27.180> and<00:04:29.180> so

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
they're hot glued onto the Dow and so

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:32.310 
they're hot glued onto the Dow and so
you've<00:04:30.750> got<00:04:30.780> all<00:04:31.260> of<00:04:31.320> that

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 
you've got all of that

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:34.200 
you've got all of that
and<00:04:32.410> then<00:04:32.560> basically<00:04:33.250> the<00:04:33.640> last<00:04:33.790> thing<00:04:33.970> I<00:04:34.060> made

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:34.210 
and then basically the last thing I made

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:38.010 
and then basically the last thing I made
was<00:04:34.420> the<00:04:34.630> heating<00:04:34.990> 10<00:04:35.260> which<00:04:36.040> is<00:04:36.070> just<00:04:36.400> I<00:04:37.020> don't

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
was the heating 10 which is just I don't

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.730 
was the heating 10 which is just I don't
know<00:04:38.140> being<00:04:38.530> a<00:04:38.710> bean<00:04:38.950> tin<00:04:39.280> and<00:04:39.600> I<00:04:40.600> poke<00:04:41.380> hole<00:04:41.620> on

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
know being a bean tin and I poke hole on

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.590 
know being a bean tin and I poke hole on
the<00:04:41.830> top<00:04:41.890> so<00:04:42.460> that<00:04:42.490> when<00:04:42.880> I<00:04:42.940> said<00:04:43.180> it<00:04:43.210> here<00:04:43.450> the

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:43.600 
the top so that when I said it here the

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.360 
the top so that when I said it here the
heat<00:04:43.750> would<00:04:43.840> go<00:04:43.990> straight<00:04:44.050> to<00:04:44.410> the<00:04:44.440> the<00:04:45.130> bottom

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
heat would go straight to the the bottom

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:46.860 
heat would go straight to the the bottom
I<00:04:45.460> can<00:04:45.670> it<00:04:45.790> would<00:04:45.850> heat<00:04:46.060> it<00:04:46.090> up<00:04:46.210> pretty<00:04:46.450> well<00:04:46.510> I

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:46.870 
I can it would heat it up pretty well I

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:49.440 
I can it would heat it up pretty well I
kind<00:04:47.770> of<00:04:47.860> you<00:04:48.010> know<00:04:48.190> so<00:04:48.370> I<00:04:48.430> can<00:04:48.460> slide<00:04:48.940> candles

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:49.450 
kind of you know so I can slide candles

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:52.530 
kind of you know so I can slide candles
into<00:04:49.660> there<00:04:49.840> and<00:04:50.610> basically<00:04:51.610> then<00:04:52.030> to<00:04:52.210> get<00:04:52.390> the

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:52.540 
into there and basically then to get the

00:04:52.540 --> 00:04:54.960 
into there and basically then to get the
engine<00:04:52.960> running<00:04:53.280> you<00:04:54.280> need<00:04:54.490> to<00:04:54.640> get<00:04:54.790> your

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:54.970 
engine running you need to get your

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:57.990 
engine running you need to get your
candles<00:04:55.510> um<00:04:55.780> I<00:04:56.290> use<00:04:57.130> two<00:04:57.370> or<00:04:57.400> three<00:04:57.610> usually<00:04:57.880> my

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:03.550 
light them slide them in there once it

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.250 
light them slide them in there once it
once<00:05:03.820> and<00:05:04.060> what's<00:05:04.600> the<00:05:04.810> the<00:05:05.530> can<00:05:05.770> heats<00:05:06.040> up<00:05:06.250> the

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:07.260 
once and what's the the can heats up the

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.450 
once and what's the the can heats up the
balloon<00:05:08.260> will<00:05:08.500> start<00:05:08.740> to<00:05:08.920> it<00:05:09.100> will<00:05:09.190> fill<00:05:09.370> up

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:09.460 
balloon will start to it will fill up

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:10.860 
balloon will start to it will fill up
with<00:05:09.520> air<00:05:09.700> and<00:05:09.760> once<00:05:10.150> you<00:05:10.450> just<00:05:10.600> got<00:05:10.720> to<00:05:10.750> give

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:10.870 
with air and once you just got to give

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:14.580 
with air and once you just got to give
it<00:05:11.110> a<00:05:11.170> kick<00:05:11.440> so<00:05:12.370> you<00:05:13.330> basically<00:05:13.540> just<00:05:13.930> have<00:05:14.230> to

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:14.590 
it a kick so you basically just have to

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:16.920 
it a kick so you basically just have to
start<00:05:15.190> at<00:05:15.310> spinning<00:05:15.670> you<00:05:16.030> just<00:05:16.240> spin<00:05:16.780> it<00:05:16.810> like

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:16.930 
start at spinning you just spin it like

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:19.670 
start at spinning you just spin it like
this<00:05:17.170> and<00:05:17.410> once<00:05:18.220> it's<00:05:18.520> heated<00:05:18.790> up<00:05:19.000> in<00:05:19.150> there

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 
this and once it's heated up in there

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:24.210 
this and once it's heated up in there
it'll<00:05:20.680> go<00:05:20.800> up<00:05:20.830> and<00:05:21.100> down<00:05:21.280> and<00:05:21.610> it<00:05:22.140> mine<00:05:23.220> mine

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:24.220 
it'll go up and down and it mine mine

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:25.830 
it'll go up and down and it mine mine
will<00:05:24.400> work<00:05:24.970> for<00:05:25.150> a<00:05:25.180> little<00:05:25.270> while<00:05:25.450> and<00:05:25.630> then<00:05:25.690> it

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:25.840 
will work for a little while and then it

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.060 
will work for a little while and then it
will<00:05:25.930> start<00:05:26.080> to<00:05:26.140> the<00:05:26.380> friction<00:05:26.740> will<00:05:26.860> catch<00:05:27.040> it

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:27.070 
will start to the friction will catch it

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:28.890 
will start to the friction will catch it
and<00:05:27.220> it'll<00:05:27.460> start<00:05:27.670> to<00:05:27.700> catch<00:05:27.970> I<00:05:28.180> owe

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:28.900 
and it'll start to catch I owe

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:30.570 
and it'll start to catch I owe
everything<00:05:29.500> so<00:05:29.830> that<00:05:29.860> would<00:05:30.040> go<00:05:30.160> better<00:05:30.340> and

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:30.580 
everything so that would go better and

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:31.920 
everything so that would go better and
you<00:05:30.700> really<00:05:31.060> have<00:05:31.210> two<00:05:31.330> loyal<00:05:31.420> that<00:05:31.600> fishing

00:05:31.920 --> 00:05:31.930 
you really have two loyal that fishing

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:33.240 
you really have two loyal that fishing
line<00:05:31.960> otherwise<00:05:32.260> it<00:05:32.500> will<00:05:32.560> get<00:05:32.680> caught<00:05:32.950> in<00:05:33.190> the

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:33.250 
line otherwise it will get caught in the

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:35.520 
line otherwise it will get caught in the
balloon<00:05:33.550> and<00:05:33.790> not<00:05:34.030> work<00:05:34.180> as<00:05:34.300> well<00:05:34.330> so<00:05:35.170> that's

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:35.530 
balloon and not work as well so that's

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:36.810 
balloon and not work as well so that's
all<00:05:35.650> talk<00:05:35.800> about<00:05:35.890> now<00:05:36.100> some<00:05:36.340> things<00:05:36.550> that

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:36.820 
all talk about now some things that

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:38.430 
all talk about now some things that
didn't<00:05:37.090> go<00:05:37.180> as<00:05:37.330> well<00:05:37.360> as<00:05:37.540> I<00:05:37.840> would<00:05:37.900> like<00:05:38.080> for<00:05:38.140> it

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:38.440 
didn't go as well as I would like for it

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.590 
didn't go as well as I would like for it
to<00:05:38.530> them<00:05:38.770> to<00:05:38.950> have<00:05:39.150> be<00:05:40.150> careful<00:05:40.420> with<00:05:40.510> the

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:40.600 
to them to have be careful with the

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.170 
to them to have be careful with the
balloon<00:05:40.900> maybe<00:05:41.440> buy<00:05:41.680> a<00:05:41.760> thicker<00:05:42.760> style<00:05:43.060> of

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:43.180 
balloon maybe buy a thicker style of

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:44.670 
balloon maybe buy a thicker style of
balloon<00:05:43.450> don't<00:05:44.020> go<00:05:44.110> for<00:05:44.230> the<00:05:44.260> cheap<00:05:44.500> ones

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:44.680 
balloon don't go for the cheap ones

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.560 
balloon don't go for the cheap ones
because<00:05:45.040> you<00:05:45.610> can<00:05:45.730> see<00:05:45.850> even<00:05:46.000> on<00:05:46.210> this<00:05:46.330> one<00:05:46.540> now

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:46.570 
because you can see even on this one now

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:48.840 
because you can see even on this one now
which<00:05:46.840> is<00:05:46.870> my<00:05:47.080> third<00:05:47.500> or<00:05:47.710> fourth<00:05:47.920> balloon<00:05:48.100> it's

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:48.850 
which is my third or fourth balloon it's

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:51.600 
which is my third or fourth balloon it's
starting<00:05:49.180> to<00:05:49.240> get<00:05:49.330> a<00:05:49.390> hole<00:05:49.660> and<00:05:49.990> that<00:05:50.830> stops<00:05:51.430> it

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:51.610 
starting to get a hole and that stops it

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:52.650 
starting to get a hole and that stops it
from<00:05:51.640> being<00:05:51.910> airtight<00:05:52.270> and<00:05:52.390> if<00:05:52.510> it's<00:05:52.630> not

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:52.660 
from being airtight and if it's not

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:54.570 
from being airtight and if it's not
airtight<00:05:52.900> then<00:05:53.410> it<00:05:53.650> won't<00:05:53.920> go<00:05:54.130> up<00:05:54.160> and<00:05:54.430> down

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:54.580 
airtight then it won't go up and down

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:57.330 
airtight then it won't go up and down
when<00:05:54.940> it<00:05:55.030> heats<00:05:55.210> up<00:05:55.420> and<00:05:56.010> that's<00:05:57.010> one<00:05:57.190> of<00:05:57.220> the

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:57.340 
when it heats up and that's one of the

00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:59.250 
when it heats up and that's one of the
problems<00:05:57.400> I<00:05:57.640> had<00:05:57.820> I<00:05:57.850> had<00:05:57.940> to<00:05:58.210> replace<00:05:58.900> two<00:05:59.170> or

00:05:59.250 --> 00:05:59.260 
problems I had I had to replace two or

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:01.260 
problems I had I had to replace two or
three<00:05:59.440> balloons<00:05:59.820> just<00:06:00.820> towards<00:06:01.030> the<00:06:01.120> end<00:06:01.210> of

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:01.270 
three balloons just towards the end of

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:03.390 
three balloons just towards the end of
the<00:06:01.330> project<00:06:01.510> which<00:06:02.470> is<00:06:02.650> not<00:06:02.920> it's<00:06:03.100> not<00:06:03.220> easy

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:03.400 
the project which is not it's not easy

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:04.380 
the project which is not it's not easy
because<00:06:03.490> you<00:06:03.610> have<00:06:03.700> to<00:06:03.790> take<00:06:03.940> the<00:06:03.970> whole<00:06:04.180> thing

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:04.390 
because you have to take the whole thing

00:06:04.390 --> 00:06:07.260 
because you have to take the whole thing
apart<00:06:05.160> so<00:06:06.160> be<00:06:06.370> careful<00:06:06.700> with<00:06:06.790> the<00:06:06.880> balloon<00:06:07.150> you

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:07.270 
apart so be careful with the balloon you

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:10.950 
apart so be careful with the balloon you
use<00:06:07.450> and<00:06:07.840> also<00:06:08.970> try<00:06:09.970> to<00:06:10.000> try<00:06:10.360> to<00:06:10.420> be<00:06:10.540> easy<00:06:10.750> with

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:10.960 
use and also try to try to be easy with

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.200 
use and also try to try to be easy with
it<00:06:11.080> so<00:06:11.170> you<00:06:11.260> don't<00:06:11.290> get<00:06:11.470> holes<00:06:11.680> in<00:06:11.830> it<00:06:12.210> another

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:13.210 
it so you don't get holes in it another

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:14.700 
it so you don't get holes in it another
thing<00:06:13.420> i<00:06:13.540> found<00:06:13.750> was<00:06:13.930> difficult<00:06:14.500> was

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:14.710 
thing i found was difficult was

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:17.090 
thing i found was difficult was
obviously<00:06:15.070> getting<00:06:15.280> the<00:06:15.370> cranks<00:06:15.910> the<00:06:16.360> right

00:06:17.090 --> 00:06:17.100 
obviously getting the cranks the right

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:22.530 
obviously getting the cranks the right
shape<00:06:19.350> once<00:06:20.350> once<00:06:20.800> you<00:06:21.010> have<00:06:21.040> that<00:06:21.160> the<00:06:21.820> if<00:06:22.420> you

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:22.540 
shape once once you have that the if you

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:23.730 
shape once once you have that the if you
can<00:06:22.630> get<00:06:22.750> them<00:06:22.870> the<00:06:22.960> right<00:06:23.080> shape<00:06:23.350> it'll<00:06:23.620> turn

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:23.740 
can get them the right shape it'll turn

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:27.240 
can get them the right shape it'll turn
a<00:06:23.800> lot<00:06:23.920> easier<00:06:24.690> also<00:06:25.690> you<00:06:26.380> can<00:06:26.410> see<00:06:26.710> these<00:06:26.860> the

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:27.250 
a lot easier also you can see these the

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:29.940 
a lot easier also you can see these the
little<00:06:27.460> terminal<00:06:27.820> connectors<00:06:28.690> that<00:06:28.720> are<00:06:29.080> used

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:29.950 
little terminal connectors that are used

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:35.310 
little terminal connectors that are used
as<00:06:30.190> the<00:06:30.430> gears<00:06:31.320> as<00:06:32.320> the<00:06:33.180> sprockets<00:06:34.180> they<00:06:34.810> are

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:35.320 
as the gears as the sprockets they are

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:37.320 
as the gears as the sprockets they are
very<00:06:35.380> fragile<00:06:36.280> and<00:06:36.760> when<00:06:36.970> you're<00:06:37.090> drilling

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:37.330 
very fragile and when you're drilling

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:38.190 
very fragile and when you're drilling
them<00:06:37.570> you've<00:06:37.690> got<00:06:37.840> to<00:06:37.900> be<00:06:37.960> really<00:06:38.170> careful

00:06:38.190 --> 00:06:38.200 
them you've got to be really careful

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:41.340 
them you've got to be really careful
because<00:06:38.910> you<00:06:39.910> you<00:06:40.360> can<00:06:40.570> you<00:06:40.960> break<00:06:41.200> them

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:41.350 
because you you can you break them

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:43.140 
because you you can you break them
pretty<00:06:41.530> easily<00:06:41.560> you<00:06:42.370> can<00:06:42.490> smash<00:06:42.760> with<00:06:43.000> your

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:43.150 
pretty easily you can smash with your

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:44.159 
pretty easily you can smash with your
pliers<00:06:43.360> and

00:06:44.159 --> 00:06:44.169 
pliers and

00:06:44.169 --> 00:06:45.450 
pliers and
so<00:06:44.319> when<00:06:44.439> you're<00:06:44.560> screwing<00:06:44.830> them<00:06:44.949> in<00:06:45.099> I<00:06:45.340> don't

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:45.460 
so when you're screwing them in I don't

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:47.640 
so when you're screwing them in I don't
know<00:06:45.550> if<00:06:45.610> you<00:06:45.669> can<00:06:45.789> see<00:06:46.029> but<00:06:46.270> this<00:06:46.840> one<00:06:47.050> here<00:06:47.469> on

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:47.650 
know if you can see but this one here on

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:49.589 
know if you can see but this one here on
the<00:06:48.009> back<00:06:48.219> and<00:06:48.460> you<00:06:48.520> can't<00:06:48.999> you<00:06:49.120> can't<00:06:49.419> really

00:06:49.589 --> 00:06:49.599 
the back and you can't you can't really

00:06:49.599 --> 00:06:51.570 
the back and you can't you can't really
tell<00:06:49.900> it's<00:06:50.529> got<00:06:50.680> a<00:06:50.710> crack<00:06:51.069> running<00:06:51.279> down<00:06:51.490> the

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:51.580 
tell it's got a crack running down the

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:53.010 
tell it's got a crack running down the
back<00:06:51.699> of<00:06:51.759> it<00:06:51.909> because<00:06:52.150> I<00:06:52.240> try<00:06:52.599> to<00:06:52.629> screw<00:06:52.900> it<00:06:52.990> a

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:53.020 
back of it because I try to screw it a

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:54.059 
back of it because I try to screw it a
little<00:06:53.110> bit<00:06:53.289> too<00:06:53.379> tight<00:06:53.409> so<00:06:53.620> that<00:06:53.770> it<00:06:53.949> wouldn't

00:06:54.059 --> 00:06:54.069 
little bit too tight so that it wouldn't
