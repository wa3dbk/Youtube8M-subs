when<00:00:33.230> I<00:00:33.260> originally<00:00:33.820> did<00:00:34.820> too<00:00:35.149> hot<00:00:35.329> to<00:00:35.510> handle

00:00:35.709 --> 00:00:35.719 
when I originally did too hot to handle

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:38.860 
when I originally did too hot to handle
a<00:00:35.960> I<00:00:36.170> did<00:00:36.949> it<00:00:37.100> in<00:00:37.219> New<00:00:37.399> York<00:00:37.699> at<00:00:37.909> Avery<00:00:38.809> Fisher

00:00:47.099 --> 00:00:47.109 

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:50.200 

started<00:00:48.109> thinking<00:00:48.769> about<00:00:48.879> handle<00:00:49.879> in<00:00:50.059> the

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
started thinking about handle in the

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.789 
started thinking about handle in the
Messiah<00:00:50.539> and<00:00:51.070> the<00:00:52.070> fact<00:00:52.309> that<00:00:52.750> Mozart<00:00:53.750> did<00:00:54.619> his

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:54.799 
Messiah and the fact that Mozart did his

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:56.289 
Messiah and the fact that Mozart did his
own<00:00:54.979> arrangement<00:00:55.670> of<00:00:55.789> Handel's<00:00:56.149> Messiah

people<00:00:57.019> who<00:00:57.140> might<00:00:57.500> not<00:00:57.680> know<00:00:57.859> that<00:00:57.890> and<00:00:58.760> I

00:00:58.959 --> 00:00:58.969 
people who might not know that and I

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:01.000 
people who might not know that and I
started<00:00:59.269> thinking<00:00:59.659> about<00:00:59.750> how<00:01:00.019> it<00:01:00.589> really

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
started thinking about how it really

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:10.120 
started thinking about how it really
could<00:01:01.549> lend<00:01:01.879> itself<00:01:02.329> to<00:01:02.750> be<00:01:02.899> updated<00:01:09.130> we

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
could lend itself to be updated we

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.430 
could lend itself to be updated we
started<00:01:10.549> talking<00:01:10.940> about<00:01:10.970> this<00:01:11.600> idea<00:01:11.840> of

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:12.440 
started talking about this idea of

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.630 
started talking about this idea of
really<00:01:13.509> keeping<00:01:14.509> the<00:01:14.929> bones<00:01:15.200> so<00:01:15.619> the<00:01:15.770> DNA<00:01:16.369> of

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
really keeping the bones so the DNA of

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:18.850 
really keeping the bones so the DNA of
the<00:01:16.759> piece<00:01:16.970> remains<00:01:17.569> the<00:01:17.810> same<00:01:18.080> you<00:01:18.500> know<00:01:18.649> the

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:18.860 
the piece remains the same you know the

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.609 
the piece remains the same you know the
the<00:01:19.369> melodies<00:01:19.909> are<00:01:20.209> the<00:01:20.330> same<00:01:20.569> the<00:01:21.110> harmonies

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:21.619 
the melodies are the same the harmonies

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:24.340 
the melodies are the same the harmonies
are<00:01:21.649> the<00:01:21.979> same<00:01:22.250> the<00:01:22.909> structure<00:01:23.450> the<00:01:23.780> text<00:01:24.229> is

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
are the same the structure the text is

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.990 
are the same the structure the text is
the<00:01:24.380> same<00:01:24.530> but<00:01:25.520> it's<00:01:25.700> all<00:01:25.850> treated<00:01:26.209> different

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:29.000 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.640 

the<00:01:30.000> instrumentation<00:01:30.870> of<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.050> orchestra's

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
the instrumentation of the orchestra's

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.740 
the instrumentation of the orchestra's
completely<00:01:32.220> different<00:01:32.610> in<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.210> original<00:01:33.600> its

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
completely different in the original its

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.430 
completely different in the original its
small<00:01:34.190> extremes<00:01:35.510> and<00:01:36.510> harpsichord

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:37.440 
small extremes and harpsichord

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.550 
small extremes and harpsichord
so<00:01:37.650> this<00:01:37.800> has<00:01:38.010> absolutely<00:01:39.110> full-blown<00:01:40.110> rhythm

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
so this has absolutely full-blown rhythm
