00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
thing the gameplay itself just feels

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.350 
thing the gameplay itself just feels
kind<00:02:19.590> of<00:02:19.709> clunky<00:02:19.950> like<00:02:20.370> there's<00:02:20.880> a<00:02:20.970> strange

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
kind of clunky like there's a strange

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.420 
kind of clunky like there's a strange
pause<00:02:21.660> between<00:02:21.959> you<00:02:22.440> pressing<00:02:22.920> the<00:02:23.070> button<00:02:23.340> to

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
attack and the attack actually happening

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.860 
attack and the attack actually happening
it's<00:02:25.890> like<00:02:25.980> the<00:02:26.550> attackee<00:02:26.850> animation<00:02:27.420> lasts

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
it's like the attackee animation lasts

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.540 
it's like the attackee animation lasts
half<00:02:28.080> a<00:02:28.230> second<00:02:28.620> longer<00:02:28.800> than<00:02:29.070> it<00:02:29.160> should<00:02:29.190> or

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
half a second longer than it should or

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.520 
half a second longer than it should or
something<00:02:29.850> and<00:02:30.240> as<00:02:30.330> a<00:02:30.450> result<00:02:30.810> it's<00:02:31.260> pretty

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
something and as a result it's pretty

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.230 
something and as a result it's pretty
easy<00:02:31.680> to<00:02:31.830> lose<00:02:32.070> health<00:02:32.310> in<00:02:32.459> this<00:02:32.580> game<00:02:32.820> you<00:02:33.120> get

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:33.240 
easy to lose health in this game you get

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:34.790 
easy to lose health in this game you get
hit<00:02:33.450> a<00:02:33.480> lot<00:02:33.690> because<00:02:34.080> of<00:02:34.200> the<00:02:34.320> weird<00:02:34.470> timing

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
hit a lot because of the weird timing

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.699 
hit a lot because of the weird timing
actually<00:02:35.610> not<00:02:36.180> only<00:02:36.360> that<00:02:36.630> but<00:02:36.840> the<00:02:37.470> cheap

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
actually not only that but the cheap

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:39.800 
actually not only that but the cheap
enemies<00:02:38.100> they<00:02:38.640> just<00:02:38.820> swarm<00:02:39.180> you<00:02:39.330> sometimes

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
enemies they just swarm you sometimes

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:54.449 
enemies they just swarm you sometimes
especially<00:02:40.050> on<00:02:40.470> the<00:02:40.560> escort<00:02:40.980> missions

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:57.699 

so<00:02:55.459> the<00:02:55.819> movement<00:02:56.390> just<00:02:56.510> feels<00:02:57.049> a<00:02:57.170> bit<00:02:57.200> off<00:02:57.500> in

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
so the movement just feels a bit off in

00:02:57.709 --> 00:02:59.289 
so the movement just feels a bit off in
this<00:02:57.829> game<00:02:58.099> that<00:02:58.459> obviously<00:02:58.939> makes<00:02:59.180> the

00:02:59.289 --> 00:02:59.299 
this game that obviously makes the

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:01.209 
this game that obviously makes the
platforming<00:02:59.870> a<00:02:59.959> little<00:03:00.170> tough<00:03:00.379> but<00:03:00.859> even<00:03:01.099> in

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:01.219 
platforming a little tough but even in

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:03.250 
platforming a little tough but even in
general<00:03:01.609> this<00:03:02.209> is<00:03:02.329> just<00:03:02.480> a<00:03:02.569> frustrating<00:03:03.230> game

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
general this is just a frustrating game

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.050 
general this is just a frustrating game
it's<00:03:03.650> way<00:03:03.890> more<00:03:04.159> difficult<00:03:04.370> than<00:03:04.640> it<00:03:04.819> looks

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:05.060 
it's way more difficult than it looks

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.539 
it's way more difficult than it looks
and<00:03:05.299> not<00:03:05.599> for<00:03:05.840> amazing<00:03:06.200> like<00:03:06.379> clever<00:03:07.280> level
