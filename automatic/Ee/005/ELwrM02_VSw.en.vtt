00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:06.750
 sown 90 we are in the company of carlo 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:09.389
 good morning good morning then today comes 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.080
 a little dark because the gloomy day 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:15.509
 even though we are at the end of June 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:21.150
 then we are on board of peugeot bipper 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:23.880
 reaper tpt ptp because tp the tp are i 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.250
 practically commercial vehicles for the 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.199
 people transport 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:33.180
 practically the logic of the 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:35.610
 commercial vehicle to make cars from 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.440
 every day exactly, so let's say 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.239
 that all the advantages of 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.210
 in cargo cars they do not then become in 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.770
 car transport people then 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.739
 let's take a look at it since we're here 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:51.000
 to the interior what you can do to me 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:53.640
 say then machine quite simple 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.810
 because obviously there are the be all 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:01:01.650
 uCI 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:04.300
 there are here are the lever of 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:07.690
 wiper below we have a 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.590
 lever for cruise control because I am looking for 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.080
 to arrive 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.120
 here he is, take care of the fight on this one 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:16.750
 version that the top version 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:20.260
 electric windows are fitted as standard 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:26.350
 solidarity front and then there are the various 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:29.680
 radio climate control keys ok let's say 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:34.000
 that there is everything without saying 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:35.470
 let's take special precautions like this 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.660
 optional however there is really everything 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:40.390
 so let's say manual climate control but 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:45.900
 there are those who are not rigid but there is therefore 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:48.940
 radio already integrated with cd mp3 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:53.900
 what are the classics that will be six 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:56.480
 classic 66 bases in short, the maximum of 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.700
 of the possibility for quality for 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:00.080
 listen to the music or see it anyway 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.880
 lots of space here in front 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.190
 yes this is a conceived machine 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:07.660
 just to have the space from all the 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:10.070
 parts are a series of storage compartments 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:13.640
 practically everywhere therefore for the 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:15.170
 glasses the keys or maybe for i 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.270
 mobile phones and so on 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.670
 inside this machine inside her 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:22.960
 things are lost 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:26.540
 here we are not seeing him because he is dark and 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.470
 opaque and not in a large drawer 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.510
 glove 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.820
 then I also look here on the side 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:35.570
 of the door so there are others 

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:38.180
 thus elegant storage for the 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:40.010
 ability to carry drawn e 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.670
 here in front of the gearbox this is a change 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:46.610
 5 speed manual are obviously all the 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.780
 there is 5-speed manual gearboxes on twitter 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.650
 the possibility also of having a 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.810
 candidate 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.850
 we speculated that we 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.430
 we tell how many versions on request 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.830
 are my three sets, let's say 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.769
 which are two 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:02.720
 this is the top if there is no le active 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:05.000
 two engines are always a 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.040
 gasoline and a diesel this in which 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.340
 we find then a love is a diesel 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.300
 let's take a look at engine displacements 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.190
 my four displacements for what 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:16.250
 regards the 1300 petrol for how much 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:21.830
 concerns diesel and petrol and methane 

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:25.760
 both the car and the vehicle are absolutely 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:28.670
 Commercial vehicle are medan able or 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:31.370
 let's say transformable to gpl or from a 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:33.610
 look at those that are spaces 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:36.590
 also behind then three comfortable seats 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.660
 a lot then we will also see the part of the 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:41.480
 luggage that one of the points I think 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:42.920
 strength of the car which is a car 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.200
 in short, that can go quietly 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:47.090
 in the garage because it is not 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.250
 absolutely long be one 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:52.460
 machine that is 4 meters shorter then 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:54.050
 it is a small car so both for the 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:56.030
 fat that also for parking because 

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:57.800
 not in the city is very convenient is one 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.680
 machine that lends itself very well to 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:03.290
 daily use of maximum versatility 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:06.590
 or as regards the sessions in 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:09.140
 absolutely no fabric fabric I see 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:13.280
 here a particular design with this one 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:15.560
 yellow finish that exalts a 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:19.810
 little bit what is the proper part 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:23.120
 where you lean and comfortable 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:26.930
 registration there is an armrest then 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:29.090
 in very little space but a lot 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:32.690
 giving so much content 

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:34.850
 practicality or I am looking towards that 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:37.510
 there is the mirror or rather the mirrors 

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:41.630
 they are electrically adjustable electric 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:43.040
 just place the joystick on one 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:45.260
 part rather than the other so 

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:49.730
 that a right hand rule rather 

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:52.460
 sinister fine that I for now you 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:53.840
 thank you and make an appointment for a test 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.370
 drive to learn more in 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.570
 dealership or why not on ours 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.740
 social channels 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:59.740
 see you soon bye bye
