00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:17.150
 the previous form I will show you about which I 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:19.640
 made from monster high 

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:23.390
 I called her stacy 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.390
 cool beauty 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:47.460
 In general, today's video I want 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:50.260
 devote to the trampoline which I promised 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:53.739
 made a lego master class previous 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:57.360
 video here is such a wonderful trampoline 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:57.360
 flew today 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:10.960
 to create a trampoline we need 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:22.979
 tightly colored cardboard all reading paper 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:25.770
 which stretches that is compasses scissors 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.860
 nail file 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:36.880
 pencil or pen 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:43.600
 sushi sticks and hot glue take 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:45.399
 compass and cardboard i will draw on paper 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.550
 draw a circle 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:54.539
 any diameter is important to this one 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:54.539
 the shell was exactly 1 centimeter 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:10.750
 we cut out such details we need 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:15.890
 two 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:20.030
 I already cut them further take net 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:23.410
 material that will be a little more 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:27.980
 the diameter of the district 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:34.760
 a little bit and glue on hot glue i 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:39.850
 it has already done and from this side also 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.850
 glue on top of another cardboard 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.880
 if i do 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:13.960
 we apply glue on all sides 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:13.960
 hot and neatly glue on top 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.740
 we press 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.970
 and trim 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:31.530
 so here we should get 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:42.570
 battles are almost ready to be beautiful 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:45.780
 we cut edges which climbs 

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.780
 small tongues 

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:02.020
 I'm in a row now not a row of skis 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:17.820
 so here I cut 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:20.690
 we cut the cut further 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.690
 sushi sticks 

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:32.930
 cut off 6 parts 

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:32.930
 at seven centimeters 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:50.880
 such details on the required 6 and here at 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:56.520
 the doors glued together like this 

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:58.220
 there will be legs for us in the trampoline now 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:02.610
 make an even triangle 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:05.120
 glue our legs trampoline using 

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:05.120
 hot glue 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:22.509
 glue and wait either 

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:53.399
 when the legs dry up and then ready 

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:59.610
 So 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:04.610
 beaches they can project 

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:30.190
