 internal memory d.lgl 3 to 16 gigabytes e 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:13.920
 without the root because you don't need to 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:17.609
 doing the roots instead of n9 I will also do the 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:21.030
 tutorial on how to root and then how 

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:21.950
 expand the internal memory up to 32 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.119
 gigabyte 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:33.619

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:33.619
 n9 we do it and we turn it off 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.720
 spem i ok 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.780
 we are waiting for it to go out 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:59.600
 when it does vibration it means 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:02:10.450
 nonexistent let's see if 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:12.230
 here we see we see the body 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:17.270
 see on battery 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:23.090
 if you have the micro sd to avoid 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:28.760
 lose the data and the sim card 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:31.110
 now we put the battery is also the 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:37.690
 cover 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:41.830
 and then to do the reset you need to 

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:47.709
 simultaneously press two of the three 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:51.459
 keys excuse the volume button down 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:56.860
 central home button and the key 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:03:01.360
 ignition after when the logo appears 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:04.780
 lg release the power button now vi 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:08.140
 I show and continue to press i 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:13.420
 two keys let see the three position 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:15.790
 keys and press all together as 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:20.769
 see now I leave you and keep the two 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:26.880
 here pressed keys and the back will start 

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:34.090
 up that is three sets after this process the 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:35.569
 phone excuse the line now I think 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:38.299
 goes well 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:40.849
 the phone will become as good as new now 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:43.420
 had to reboot again 

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:43.420
 here it is 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:52.470
 the two keys that light up are 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.610
 because I also installed mag recovery 

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:57.850
 then I will also make a video on how 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:04:01.420
 install recovery because it is used for 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:03.870
 increase the internal memory up to 32 

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:03.870
 gigabyte 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:13.270
 so naturally we wait for the first one 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:29.550
 ignition takes more because how 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:29.550
 if we would buy it again we wait 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:38.320
 here are the two virtual keys are 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:38.320
 appeared 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.450
 a few more seconds 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:06.550

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:12.500
 here is the configuration 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:16.700

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:19.540
