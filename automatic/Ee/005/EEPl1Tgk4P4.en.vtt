00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.680
 hello dear friends today i would 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.799
 I wanted to talk about a new game that 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:11.639
 created ah ji called she year 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.960
 guard I understand that this game if for 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.960
 some other game of you 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.730
 another manufacturer yes but me in 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.460
 In principle, the game is unknown I am not in it 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.119
 played and in general is nothing bad or 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.760
 good 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.650
 I can not tell you the plot of the game 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.410
 principle just have just buy 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:31.740
 ancient greek such a heap of heroes 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:35.610
 Antic on the fact that there are some Achilles 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:38.399
 Cerberus someone vector hercules to that 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.379
 like in general, so I understand 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:45.420
 opened up someone opened the pandora's box 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:46.829
 general summoned neither good money and technician with 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.140
 which we have in principle 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.120
 fight but in principle there is enough 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.690
 a simple toy like you see 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.699
 there are several elite cards here 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:01.800
 ok and a few, respectively 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:04.309
 the stages they came all look like here i wanted 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.320
 would show for example the battle on the first 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:10.020
 level as you can see yes I have now 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:13.260
 several heroes at the beginning are given three 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.750
 hero in my this one this one and this one 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.630
 hero too heroes are subdivided into 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.509
 different so to speak rank yes that's it 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.790
 the hero who stand in front 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.520
 composition, well, I'll explain a little bit now 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.020
 it's in the center and behind 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.420
 respectively the front member can 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.689
 call them tanks I give those who are behind them 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.119
 weaker for attack probably type 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:38.790
 bugs in the center of such type I do not know you 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.759
 thresholds perhaps something but when compared with 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:45.360
 other games and that's basically built 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:48.600
 the battle is quite simple then there is 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.700
 you can control or press the machine 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.340
 automatic on auto control up 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.579
 respectively in each of these cards 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:58.890
 which pressing there are three stages 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:02:00.300
 they definitely succeed in gold and 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.730
 clothes in general 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:05.250
 each card has its own clothes except 

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:07.200
 You can also use it super 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.170
 abilities of heroes as you can see here i am 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.790
 now clicked on a girl with with snakes and 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.240
 accordingly, everyone did something there 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.730
 killed 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:19.500
 This is the first stage. 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.430
 as here is experience 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.190
 so classic 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.350
 lpg than i liked her first 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.020
 she seemed 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:29.820
 something like know there are a bunch of games 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.920
 where you need to collect cards then them 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.320
 stack each other there improve 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:38.030
 the characters here are a little different here 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:42.570
 There is a mod that stands out from various 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:44.550
 cards yes this is not very good 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:47.400
 Let's take an example of probably some sort of 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:49.380
 yes example firstly need level 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.980
 hero 25 secondly as you can see here and 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:54.540
 gives you some 100 you definitely this 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:57.690
 cloak here and accordingly to his 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.210
 collect need to collect for him 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.190
 Ingredients 

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:03.630
 An example of this is the ring to which for 

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.209
 which also needs a certain 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:09.360
 ingredients to collect but here was 20 rda to 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:12.660
 example as you can see by clicking on it 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.510
 see in which part it falls well 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.980
 here is no third probably I will not 

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.820
 difficult enough well here's the second part 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.400
 you are shown 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:23.940
 from which card from which card does it fall out 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.530
 here it is possible and this stage has already passed 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.060
 so you can skip it 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.660
 Respectively press skip bye 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:32.430
 will not fall out 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:34.280
 me this soccer bolt so well here it is 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:37.560
 probably did not fall out 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:39.900
 wait for energy in general such a system 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:43.770
 unfortunately it turned out to show but I would 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:47.520
 it still can not collect at least from 

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:51.270
 just collect all equip on hero so 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:53.820
 An example here I have 4 things collected door 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:54.690
 you need to still collect and then click 

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:58.500
 on his 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:01.170
 and he changes his stats first 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.330
 you hero blue on gray just here 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:06.739
 see me framed so green 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:08.220
 color and plus one apisto 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:10.620
 gray heroes 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.190
 at Heroes Skill open only 1 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.650
 level 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:15.060
 the pen to strike here then heroes 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:18.170
 turn green 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:22.110
 In my opinion they open the second level 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:23.700
 abilities then green + 1 in their 

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:28.860
 principle, nothing opens then they 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:30.780
 turn blue that is every time 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:34.710
 when you upgrade a hero you need 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:36.030
 collect on it new clothes completely 6 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:39.510
 varieties should be crammed 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:40.920
 and here I have already turned into a hero 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:42.720
 me two stars is also some 

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:45.300
 star system i'm not really 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:47.450
 I understood it so he became 

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:50.370
 Of course, increased more 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:51.960
 life, in general, wealth heap who here 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:53.220
 these tsiferki with these tsiferkami 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.650
 bother you enough 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:58.590
 interestingly increases the life of the village and 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:00.660
 that sort of thing and besides on blue 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:02.910
 the hero opens up the third ability then 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:05.070
 it is also written what she does, I understand 

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:06.810
 that all these abilities of the hero 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:07.980
 use during the battle automatically 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:10.440
 that is, not what I clicked on 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:12.060
 superpower but just during the fight 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:15.390
 when he pleases he'll just start 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:18.270
 This starts to a tornado or something like that then 

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:21.540
 do save 100 rubles to run the principle and 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:23.870
 So I understand that the next stage is already 

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:26.160
 i will be a purple hero maybe 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:28.470
 through through the stage and accordingly 

00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:30.830
 open the last of his passive 

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:33.360
 skill yes but I understand it here 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:35.790
 his resists are increasing 

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:38.850
 each character their skills in addition 

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:40.980
 what more interesting is that 

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:43.710
 don't rock that is how you see here it is 

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:46.530
 bottle throws as I understand it and puts 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:49.350
 damage click on the skill with us 

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:51.120
 increases the damage spent on it 

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:53.520
 money is also spent on this skill 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:55.800
 point and each skill point requires 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.690
 apparently two minutes or how much a minute 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:01.530
 fifty to recover but in any 

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:05.340
 If I am here I will be missing more than 

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:06.870
 skill point of so such a game 

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:08.850
 of course I got attracted and now 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:09.400
 mountain pumping system 

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:12.400
 to 

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:15.280
 that you can knock things out on 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:16.810
 heroes and things like that in general as well 

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:19.030
 in principle, a simple time killer 

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:23.770
 especially this 20 these cards yes they are 

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:26.800
 In principle, everything seems to just fall out 

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:28.570
 there are no different things besides 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:29.169
 such that you may have several 

00:06:28.570 --> 00:06:32.080
 heroes 

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:36.190
 identical, respectively, as you can see 

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:40.570
 here all the characters are unique and for everyone 

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:42.699
 hero need to collect a certain puzzle 

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:45.250
 so in the next video probably already 

00:06:42.699 --> 00:06:47.740
 I will also tell you if you allow 

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:51.160
 there is that hero some kind of let’s say 

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:53.979
 this girl with snakes and them too 

00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:55.600
 you can collect puzzles to press accent but 

00:06:53.979 --> 00:06:58.050
 I honestly do not know what he gives 

00:06:55.600 --> 00:07:02.250
 maybe he adds one star 

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:05.770
 most likely yes well, also of the type 

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:07.449
 crossbreed got the cards a little bit different 

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:13.270
 way well, in fact, so far for me 

00:07:07.449 --> 00:07:15.940
 I like the game so far I have tasks 

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:17.710
 can say so here is the game honestly 

00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:20.880
 Of course it is not given here, too, there is such 

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:23.590
 something like roll heroes yes that is for 

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:26.260
 gold but it can be compared 

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:29.440
 castles battle for the honor of icons 

00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:31.990
 crystal here is even more expensive amount 

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:35.650
 This need is not yet visible 

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:39.550
 and also there are arena and other locations I 

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:42.490
 They will talk about later next 

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:44.770
 video here, in principle, join here 

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:48.699
 one english server but nothing 

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:50.830
 difficult and in it is not in principle 

00:07:48.699 --> 00:07:52.840
 everything is clear so if something is 

00:07:50.830 --> 00:07:54.610
 questions you will be on the mechanics of the game I 

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:58.090
 Of course, he himself has not fully figured out 

00:07:54.610 --> 00:08:01.090
 but explained will try in the answers in 

00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:04.300
 comments or the game already answer you 

00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:06.340
 here is not all I 'll write again 

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:08.199
 comments link to the game title 

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:11.490
 games you can download to watch and 

00:08:08.199 --> 00:08:11.490
 play maybe hell you 

00:08:11.510 --> 00:08:15.790
 it seems interesting at me all around 

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:15.790
 thank
