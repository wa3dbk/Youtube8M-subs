00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
really bad in lane but you can manage to

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.740 
really bad in lane but you can manage to

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:32.600 
here for a while so I use yeah I didn't

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.970 
here for a while so I use yeah I didn't
really<00:00:33.600> know<00:00:33.780> that<00:00:33.809> MIT<00:00:34.230> will<00:00:34.440> do<00:00:34.559> on<00:00:34.680> me<00:00:34.800> that

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
really know that MIT will do on me that

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.290 
really know that MIT will do on me that
how<00:00:35.040> much<00:00:35.190> I<00:00:35.280> could<00:00:35.460> take<00:00:35.640> on<00:00:35.790> everything<00:00:36.030> and

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
how much I could take on everything and

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.170 
how much I could take on everything and
he<00:00:36.870> is<00:00:36.960> kimmy<00:00:37.230> 101<00:00:37.649> and<00:00:37.800> after<00:00:38.219> that<00:00:38.399> it<00:00:38.879> wasn't

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
he is kimmy 101 and after that it wasn't

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.119 
he is kimmy 101 and after that it wasn't
over<00:00:39.270> but<00:00:39.570> there<00:00:39.840> was<00:00:40.230> so<00:00:40.410> much<00:00:40.530> better<00:00:40.770> they

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
over but there was so much better they

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.830 
over but there was so much better they
had<00:00:41.280> Rumble<00:00:41.700> not<00:00:42.090> chewing<00:00:42.329> a<00:00:42.420> feast<00:00:42.660> which

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
had Rumble not chewing a feast which

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.920 
had Rumble not chewing a feast which
could<00:00:43.050> go<00:00:43.320> in<00:00:43.500> on<00:00:43.649> me<00:00:44.040> or<00:00:44.219> pusu<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:44.910> once<00:00:45.629> at<00:00:45.780> us

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
could go in on me or pusu and once at us

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.170 
could go in on me or pusu and once at us
their<00:00:46.770> self<00:00:47.039> was<00:00:47.160> better<00:00:47.370> and<00:00:47.550> we<00:00:47.670> lost<00:00:47.789> early

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
their self was better and we lost early

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.299 
their self was better and we lost early
so<00:00:48.210> it<00:00:48.450> was<00:00:48.570> for<00:00:49.020> sure<00:00:49.170> over<00:00:49.440> after<00:00:49.739> 20<00:00:50.160> minutes

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
so it was for sure over after 20 minutes

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.639 
so it was for sure over after 20 minutes
I<00:00:50.550> think<00:00:50.660> wyd<00:00:51.660> a<00:00:51.690> choice<00:00:51.989> to<00:00:52.020> go<00:00:52.320> for<00:00:52.530> that

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
I think wyd a choice to go for that

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.979 
I think wyd a choice to go for that
setup<00:00:52.980> in<00:00:53.760> contrast<00:00:54.239> to<00:00:54.300> what<00:00:54.390> you<00:00:54.600> want<00:00:54.750> four

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
setup in contrast to what you want four

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.139 
setup in contrast to what you want four
in<00:00:55.110> Game<00:00:55.350> one<00:00:55.379> was<00:00:56.160> it<00:00:56.309> kind<00:00:56.460> of<00:00:56.520> like<00:00:56.699> we<00:00:57.000> got

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
in Game one was it kind of like we got

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.860 
in Game one was it kind of like we got
this<00:00:57.300> anyway<00:00:57.660> or<00:00:57.960> yeah<00:00:58.829> well<00:00:59.270> it<00:01:00.270> was<00:01:00.539> to<00:01:00.690> try

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
this anyway or yeah well it was to try

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.840 
this anyway or yeah well it was to try
like<00:01:01.079> like<00:01:01.410> I<00:01:01.559> said<00:01:01.770> if<00:01:01.890> I<00:01:02.010> did<00:01:02.160> if<00:01:02.309> I<00:01:02.399> plenty<00:01:02.760> of

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
like like I said if I did if I plenty of

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.100 
like like I said if I did if I plenty of
better<00:01:03.030> I<00:01:03.120> think<00:01:03.270> we'll<00:01:03.480> go<00:01:03.600> I<00:01:03.629> won<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.930> game

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
better I think we'll go I won the game

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.460 
better I think we'll go I won the game
because<00:01:04.589> I<00:01:05.280> would<00:01:06.090> have<00:01:06.330> died<00:01:06.479> 101<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.290> fish

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
because I would have died 101 the fish

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.929 
because I would have died 101 the fish
way<00:01:07.590> I<00:01:07.619> had<00:01:07.799> get<00:01:07.920> ahead<00:01:08.159> i<00:01:08.220> would<00:01:08.460> have<00:01:08.580> farmed

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
way I had get ahead i would have farmed

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.510 
way I had get ahead i would have farmed
even<00:01:09.299> more<00:01:09.450> than<00:01:09.600> him<00:01:09.780> at<00:01:09.900> some<00:01:10.080> point<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.530> i

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
even more than him at some point and i

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.550 
even more than him at some point and i
caught<00:01:11.790> get<00:01:12.210> gang<00:01:12.390> sicily<00:01:12.810> like<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.200> only<00:01:13.290> gun

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
caught get gang sicily like the only gun

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.320 
caught get gang sicily like the only gun
guy<00:01:13.740> almost<00:01:13.890> got<00:01:14.070> embarrassed<00:01:14.790> but<00:01:15.060> history

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
guy almost got embarrassed but history

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.330 
guy almost got embarrassed but history
by<00:01:15.509> so<00:01:15.570> it<00:01:15.720> was<00:01:15.810> really<00:01:15.930> bad<00:01:16.170> in<00:01:16.710> a<00:01:16.860> normal<00:01:17.040> game

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
by so it was really bad in a normal game

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.190 
by so it was really bad in a normal game
with<00:01:17.670> if<00:01:17.939> I<00:01:18.060> was<00:01:18.210> more<00:01:18.360> confident<00:01:18.780> with<00:01:18.840> TF<00:01:19.110> I

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
with if I was more confident with TF I

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.780 
with if I was more confident with TF I
think<00:01:19.409> I<00:01:19.439> will<00:01:19.530> have<00:01:19.590> at<00:01:20.250> least<00:01:20.430> one<00:01:20.640> or<00:01:20.759> two

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
think I will have at least one or two

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.999 
think I will have at least one or two
kills<00:01:21.150> you<00:01:21.299> sweetie<00:01:21.630> pea<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.470> if<00:01:22.590> I<00:01:22.680> don't<00:01:22.740> die

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
kills you sweetie pea and if I don't die

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.260 
kills you sweetie pea and if I don't die
then<00:01:23.220> they<00:01:23.340> can<00:01:23.490> kind<00:01:23.610> of<00:01:23.700> snowball<00:01:24.000> from<00:01:24.090> that

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
then they can kind of snowball from that

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.719 
then they can kind of snowball from that
but<00:01:24.479> yeah<00:01:24.960> I<00:01:25.140> think<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.560> our<00:01:26.040> pics<00:01:26.549> were

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
but yeah I think the our pics were

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.609 
but yeah I think the our pics were
decent<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.479> win<00:01:27.630> early<00:01:27.930> but<00:01:28.080> we<00:01:28.110> didn't<00:01:28.470> play

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
decent to win early but we didn't play

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.340 
decent to win early but we didn't play
as<00:01:28.710> good<00:01:28.860> and<00:01:29.240> then<00:01:30.240> of<00:01:30.390> course<00:01:30.420> it<00:01:30.960> comes<00:01:31.079> down

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
as good and then of course it comes down

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.530 
as good and then of course it comes down
to<00:01:31.590> game<00:01:31.860> 3<00:01:32.159> is<00:01:32.430> this<00:01:32.700> where<00:01:32.909> you<00:01:32.939> excel

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
to game 3 is this where you excel

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
pretty much a good team that has to

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.609 
pretty much a good team that has to
engage<00:01:50.399> tanks<00:01:51.090> initiate<00:01:51.659> counter<00:01:52.079> engage<00:01:52.350> and

that's<00:01:52.979> what<00:01:53.130> we<00:01:53.250> did<00:01:53.310> and<00:01:53.670> after<00:01:54.180> the<00:01:54.479> level<00:01:54.750> 1

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
that's what we did and after the level 1

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.289 
that's what we did and after the level 1
the<00:01:55.140> game<00:01:55.409> was<00:01:55.560> like<00:01:55.770> really<00:01:56.090> really<00:01:57.090> in<00:01:57.270> your

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
the game was like really really in your

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.090 
the game was like really really in your
favor<00:01:57.570> so<00:01:57.689> that<00:01:58.200> level<00:01:58.469> one<00:01:58.619> was<00:01:58.740> really<00:01:58.890> good

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
favor so that level one was really good

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.499 
favor so that level one was really good
to<00:01:59.310> have<00:01:59.460> two<00:01:59.610> kills<00:01:59.820> in<00:01:59.969> your<00:02:00.060> advantage

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
to have two kills in your advantage

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.420 
to have two kills in your advantage
meant<00:02:00.810> that<00:02:01.020> we<00:02:01.469> had<00:02:01.500> to<00:02:01.799> not<00:02:02.009> throw<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.280> game

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
meant that we had to not throw the game

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.940 
meant that we had to not throw the game
and<00:02:02.700> that's<00:02:03.060> really<00:02:03.299> see<00:02:03.570> normally<00:02:03.869> not<00:02:04.740> throw

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
and that's really see normally not throw

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.350 
and that's really see normally not throw
the<00:02:05.070> game<00:02:05.189> really<00:02:05.399> easy<00:02:05.610> not<00:02:05.820> for<00:02:05.969> every<00:02:06.149> team

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
the game really easy not for every team

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.260 
the game really easy not for every team
but<00:02:07.069> next<00:02:08.069> round<00:02:08.340> you'll<00:02:08.580> be<00:02:08.729> going<00:02:09.030> up

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
but next round you'll be going up

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.920 
but next round you'll be going up
against<00:02:09.720> royale<00:02:10.200> or<00:02:10.520> OMG<00:02:11.520> is<00:02:11.760> there<00:02:12.629> something

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
against royale or OMG is there something

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.670 
against royale or OMG is there something
inside<00:02:13.140> you<00:02:13.260> that<00:02:13.290> says

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
inside you that says

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.440 
inside you that says
I<00:02:13.709> just<00:02:14.250> want<00:02:14.489> to<00:02:14.579> become<00:02:14.849> that<00:02:15.000> champion

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
I just want to become that champion

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.020 
I just want to become that champion
again<00:02:15.950> of<00:02:16.950> course<00:02:17.250> I<00:02:17.430> think<00:02:17.790> we<00:02:17.849> had<00:02:18.000> good

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
again of course I think we had good

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.550 
again of course I think we had good
chances<00:02:18.150> which<00:02:18.659> was<00:02:18.810> the<00:02:18.930> steam<00:02:19.140> actually

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
chances which was the steam actually

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.190 
chances which was the steam actually
like<00:02:20.069> even<00:02:20.430> more<00:02:20.579> than<00:02:20.640> then<00:02:21.450> that<00:02:21.900> team<00:02:22.049> and

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
like even more than then that team and

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.479 
like even more than then that team and
the<00:02:22.319> most<00:02:22.500> afraid<00:02:22.680> of<00:02:22.829> is<00:02:22.980> probably<00:02:23.099> ask<00:02:23.400> a

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
the most afraid of is probably ask a

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.849 
the most afraid of is probably ask a
telecom<00:02:23.909> but<00:02:24.599> besides<00:02:25.019> that<00:02:25.290> the<00:02:25.530> other<00:02:25.680> teams

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:25.859 
telecom but besides that the other teams

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:27.020 
telecom but besides that the other teams
that<00:02:26.099> heat<00:02:26.219> I<00:02:26.400> think<00:02:26.579> we<00:02:26.670> have<00:02:26.790> a<00:02:26.819> good<00:02:26.969> chance

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
that heat I think we have a good chance

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.530 
that heat I think we have a good chance
they<00:02:27.480> are<00:02:27.689> not<00:02:28.019> worse<00:02:28.379> than<00:02:28.730> not<00:02:29.730> c9<00:02:30.060> CNN<00:02:30.359> is<00:02:30.450> a

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
they are not worse than not c9 CNN is a

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.209 
they are not worse than not c9 CNN is a
really<00:02:30.719> good<00:02:30.870> team<00:02:31.049> and<00:02:31.200> I<00:02:31.290> think<00:02:31.500> the<00:02:31.650> Royal

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:32.219 
really good team and I think the Royal

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:33.949 
really good team and I think the Royal
OMG<00:02:32.579> will<00:02:32.760> play<00:02:32.939> same<00:02:33.209> as<00:02:33.329> them<00:02:33.540> maybe<00:02:33.840> I've

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:33.959 
OMG will play same as them maybe I've

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:35.179 
OMG will play same as them maybe I've
been<00:02:33.989> more<00:02:34.200> crazy<00:02:34.439> because<00:02:34.799> they<00:02:35.069> go

00:02:35.179 --> 00:02:35.189 
been more crazy because they go

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:37.250 
been more crazy because they go
aggressive<00:02:35.459> all<00:02:35.700> the<00:02:35.790> time<00:02:35.969> but<00:02:36.200> besides<00:02:37.200> that

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 
aggressive all the time but besides that

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.599 
aggressive all the time but besides that
I<00:02:37.409> think<00:02:37.650> they<00:02:37.739> are<00:02:37.829> a<00:02:37.859> strong<00:02:38.129> team<00:02:38.159> and<00:02:38.340> it

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:38.609 
I think they are a strong team and it

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:41.740 
I think they are a strong team and it
will<00:02:38.790> be<00:02:38.849> seen<00:02:39.060> I<00:02:39.120> we<00:02:39.269> can<00:02:39.420> beat<00:02:39.599> the<00:02:39.719> rest<00:02:40.370> okay

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
will be seen I we can beat the rest okay

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.910 
will be seen I we can beat the rest okay
