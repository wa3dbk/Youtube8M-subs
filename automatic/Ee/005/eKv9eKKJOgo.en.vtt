00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:05.670
 friends of your official sos what a pleasure 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.140
 I can say hello on the third day of the 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.210
 preseason of pachuca on land 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.130
 mexiquense is triple session wednesday 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.599
 the first at 7:30 in the morning where 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.280
 the Hidalgo team worked with the 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.380
 ball on the court of the hotel avándaro 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.840
 later at 11:30 they worked 

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:20.730
 strength under a rainy climate the 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.710
 reinforcements are becoming more adapted and 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.579
 here we listen to matías alústiza that 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.579
 he talks about his preseason 

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.240
 yes the truth yes the truth we are 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.220
 working very hard was very intense 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:34.070
 Well, three weeks ago we came 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:37.040
 well but since we got to Avándaro 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.660
 has been been strong but very happy 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.010
 because the truth is we are working very 

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.420
 well the group is very well and that's what 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.830
 important already as an experience 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.449
 matías that you could tell the young 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:46.430
 who are living their first according to the 

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:47.720
 preseason good usually I 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.030
 like to talk a lot with them to 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.100
 help him support him to tell them what 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.230
 it's about this out there sometimes they are 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:59.340
 guys and they're in other things 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:02.340
 when they start to stay lift it and 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.290
 help him support the truth that there 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.470
 how good an excellent group is knitted 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.830
 If you listen to them and they have many 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.690
 eager to learn 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.820
 one of the players who returns after 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:17.200
 of one year to loan is avilés stolen and 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.200
 here we listen to the Colombian 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.660
 notice that every day I feel very much 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:24.000
 better I think a very compact group and 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.710
 well let's hope to be informed to 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.050
 the tournament grows start from the best 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.260
 way is the most difficult stage or more 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.110
 tired 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:34.870
 yes but here everything will be taken 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.760
 with great joy the group very happy 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:38.020
 very united then nothing I think that 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.910
 they went fast these days and well 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.350
 we want to be in shape these 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:44.470
 trainings is when you look for the 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.320
 ownership yes I also think that there is 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.510
 work very hard because there is a group 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.700
 who is fighting important things 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:54.970
 they all work very well and can 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.140
 very important players players who 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.150
 are going through a good time and 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.760
 Well let's hope to be ready for 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:02.230
 compete with one 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:03.880
 as is already a custom in the 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:05.100
 preseason youth young players who 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.960
 they are getting their first chance 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:10.090
 they received their hazing that we heard 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.050
 Ivan ochoa minutes before changing 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.690
 look 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:17.270
 more than anything to have the adaptation that 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.970
 you need to work here well it 's 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.680
 a strong drudgery but from the 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.000
 basis to start the tournament first 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.930
 have the opportunity to play now in 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.090
 the league 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:27.890
 let's say with kaka and he has won us a 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.110
 since you do not know what we are here 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:32.090
 those we have been coming to demonstrate 

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.980
 everything here we won a place that already 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.740
 I was carrying the whole process you could not imagine 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.950
 reach 18 and first team one 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:41.540
 preseason to be well with the friction with 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.250
 because it is always an objective that they put you 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.450
 I do not believe since you get here, it's like 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.060
 that mentality of reaching the first 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:48.770
 equipment as soon as possible is at most 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.480
 quick as you can but always 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.610
 we respect the processes and of course 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.530
 Well, nothing touched me around 2020 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.880
 came pre-season that although that's not 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.220
 means to be here hopefully and if we 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:00.290
 Let 's meet is what you want 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.270
 this one go fixed cam first edition but 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.430
 but if I always respect the 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:07.390
 processes depending on what the 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.390
 managers and coaches 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.780
 pachuca culminated his day with a 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.340
 triple training session a 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.260
 media day wednesday where the 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.940
 national press could approach the 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.420
 players to know their impressions 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:21.099
 of this pre-season towards the opening 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:23.049
