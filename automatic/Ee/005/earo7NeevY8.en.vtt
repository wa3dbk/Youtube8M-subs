00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:04.190 
I'm dr. Jim will take a look at hip pain
today<00:00:02.340> particularly<00:00:02.879> in<00:00:03.210> runners<00:00:03.540> there's<00:00:04.110> a

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
today particularly in runners there's a

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.440 
today particularly in runners there's a
lot<00:00:04.350> of<00:00:04.380> focus<00:00:04.740> given<00:00:05.670> on<00:00:05.790> muscle<00:00:06.210> muscle

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
lot of focus given on muscle muscle

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.720 
lot of focus given on muscle muscle
strength<00:00:06.960> but<00:00:07.710> a<00:00:07.770> lot<00:00:07.890> of<00:00:07.919> times<00:00:08.130> actual<00:00:08.519> hip

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
strength but a lot of times actual hip

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.879 
strength but a lot of times actual hip
joint<00:00:09.090> is<00:00:09.210> jammed<00:00:09.480> up<00:00:09.719> when<00:00:10.110> you<00:00:10.230> put<00:00:10.590> a<00:00:10.620> lot<00:00:10.830> of

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
joint is jammed up when you put a lot of

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.640 
joint is jammed up when you put a lot of
mileage<00:00:11.190> on<00:00:11.610> the<00:00:12.030> joint<00:00:12.240> one<00:00:12.840> of<00:00:12.929> the<00:00:13.019> easy<00:00:13.290> and

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
mileage on the joint one of the easy and

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.630 
mileage on the joint one of the easy and
quick<00:00:13.950> ways<00:00:14.190> to<00:00:14.219> assess<00:00:14.790> is<00:00:15.440> having<00:00:16.440> a<00:00:16.640> patient

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
quick ways to assess is having a patient

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.240 
quick ways to assess is having a patient
laying<00:00:18.000> on<00:00:18.570> their<00:00:18.810> belly<00:00:19.050> bend<00:00:19.920> their<00:00:20.039> knees

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
laying on their belly bend their knees

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.370 
laying on their belly bend their knees
to<00:00:20.580> 90<00:00:20.850> degrees<00:00:20.939> then<00:00:21.480> you<00:00:21.600> let<00:00:21.750> them<00:00:21.840> hang<00:00:22.199> out

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
to 90 degrees then you let them hang out

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.009 
to 90 degrees then you let them hang out
to<00:00:22.529> the<00:00:22.619> side<00:00:23.240> if<00:00:24.240> you<00:00:24.330> see<00:00:24.539> an<00:00:24.600> asymmetry

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
to the side if you see an asymmetry

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.349 
to the side if you see an asymmetry
between<00:00:25.320> the<00:00:25.710> two<00:00:25.859> sides<00:00:26.099> as<00:00:26.939> you<00:00:27.000> can<00:00:27.180> see

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
between the two sides as you can see

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.870 
between the two sides as you can see
here<00:00:27.599> her<00:00:27.750> left<00:00:28.080> as<00:00:28.439> a<00:00:29.070> good<00:00:29.400> bit<00:00:29.550> of<00:00:29.580> motion

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
here her left as a good bit of motion

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.040 
here her left as a good bit of motion
but<00:00:29.970> her<00:00:30.119> right<00:00:31.309> is<00:00:32.309> pretty<00:00:32.640> limited<00:00:33.050> what

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
but her right is pretty limited what

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.170 
but her right is pretty limited what
that<00:00:34.230> means<00:00:34.500> is<00:00:34.890> the<00:00:35.130> hip<00:00:35.309> is<00:00:35.430> not<00:00:35.610> internally

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
that means is the hip is not internally

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.330 
that means is the hip is not internally
rotating<00:00:36.750> which<00:00:36.870> is<00:00:36.989> very<00:00:37.200> important<00:00:37.800> when

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
rotating which is very important when

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.430 
rotating which is very important when
you're<00:00:38.489> running<00:00:38.760> to<00:00:39.329> take<00:00:39.540> stress<00:00:39.960> off<00:00:39.989> the

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
you're running to take stress off the

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.530 
you're running to take stress off the
hip<00:00:40.620> joint<00:00:40.649> so<00:00:41.100> it's<00:00:41.219> essentially<00:00:41.640> constantly

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
hip joint so it's essentially constantly

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.110 
hip joint so it's essentially constantly
stuck<00:00:43.320> in<00:00:43.620> an<00:00:43.950> externally<00:00:44.340> rotate<00:00:44.670> position

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
stuck in an externally rotate position

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.299 
stuck in an externally rotate position
which<00:00:45.600> puts<00:00:45.870> a<00:00:45.960> lot<00:00:46.140> of<00:00:46.170> force<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:46.800> stress<00:00:47.100> on

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
which puts a lot of force and stress on

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:49.430 
which puts a lot of force and stress on
the<00:00:47.460> joint<00:00:47.730> when<00:00:48.719> you're<00:00:48.840> constantly<00:00:49.170> running

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
the joint when you're constantly running

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.380 
the joint when you're constantly running
putting<00:00:49.710> all<00:00:49.920> that<00:00:49.950> mileage<00:00:50.550> in<00:00:50.940> that

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
putting all that mileage in that

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.540 
putting all that mileage in that
position<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:52.350> force<00:00:52.649> goes<00:00:53.039> right<00:00:53.309> through

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
position the force goes right through

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.029 
position the force goes right through
the<00:00:53.670> hip<00:00:53.940> a<00:00:54.239> lot<00:00:54.600> of<00:00:54.690> times<00:00:54.870> wears<00:00:55.199> down<00:00:55.500> at<00:00:55.890> an

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
the hip a lot of times wears down at an

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.380 
the hip a lot of times wears down at an
area<00:00:56.309> called<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.610> SI<00:00:56.940> joint<00:00:56.969> of<00:00:57.360> the

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
area called the SI joint of the

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.779 
area called the SI joint of the
sacroiliac<00:00:57.870> joint<00:00:58.469> that<00:00:59.039> refers<00:00:59.430> pain

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
sacroiliac joint that refers pain

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.290 
sacroiliac joint that refers pain
anywhere<00:01:00.660> from<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.989> back<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:02.430> the<00:01:02.460> front<00:01:02.730> you

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
anywhere from the back to the front you

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.380 
anywhere from the back to the front you
can<00:01:03.420> actually<00:01:03.690> have<00:01:03.780> pain<00:01:04.199> right<00:01:04.860> in<00:01:05.390> here

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
can actually have pain right in here

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.840 
can actually have pain right in here
which<00:01:06.780> is<00:01:06.990> mostly<00:01:07.860> called<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.220> hip<00:01:08.369> flexors

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
which is mostly called the hip flexors

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.270 
which is mostly called the hip flexors
problem<00:01:09.810> is<00:01:09.990> you<00:01:10.439> try<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:10.680> stretch<00:01:10.979> it<00:01:11.159> out

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
problem is you try to stretch it out

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.450 
problem is you try to stretch it out
comes<00:01:12.000> right<00:01:12.090> back<00:01:12.560> chances<00:01:13.560> are<00:01:13.740> it's<00:01:14.220> that

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
comes right back chances are it's that

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.789 
comes right back chances are it's that
hip<00:01:14.700> joint<00:01:15.020> causing<00:01:16.020> stress<00:01:16.229> on<00:01:16.290> that<00:01:16.439> side

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
hip joint causing stress on that side

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.160 
hip joint causing stress on that side
joint<00:01:17.100> causing<00:01:18.030> that<00:01:18.119> referral<00:01:18.509> pain<00:01:18.720> so<00:01:19.140> a

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
joint causing that referral pain so a

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.780 
joint causing that referral pain so a
lot<00:01:19.350> of<00:01:19.439> times<00:01:19.619> when<00:01:20.009> you<00:01:20.130> come<00:01:20.310> in<00:01:20.460> with<00:01:20.490> this

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
lot of times when you come in with this

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.539 
lot of times when you come in with this
kind<00:01:21.000> of<00:01:21.090> pain<00:01:21.360> by<00:01:21.930> the<00:01:21.990> time<00:01:22.259> you<00:01:22.439> have<00:01:22.650> pain

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
kind of pain by the time you have pain

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.789 
kind of pain by the time you have pain
in<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.090> back<00:01:24.560> especially<00:01:25.560> if<00:01:25.619> you're<00:01:25.770> a

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
in the back especially if you're a

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.100 
in the back especially if you're a
runner<00:01:26.009> it's<00:01:26.549> usually<00:01:27.000> too<00:01:27.180> late<00:01:27.420> so<00:01:27.930> a<00:01:27.960> lot<00:01:28.080> of

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
runner it's usually too late so a lot of

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.480 
runner it's usually too late so a lot of
times<00:01:28.320> it<00:01:28.470> actually<00:01:28.740> starts<00:01:29.040> at<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.189> hip<00:01:29.369> and

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
times it actually starts at the hip and

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.999 
times it actually starts at the hip and
the<00:01:29.549> force<00:01:29.820> causes<00:01:30.329> pain<00:01:30.630> in<00:01:30.930> that<00:01:31.650> in<00:01:31.920> the

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
the force causes pain in that in the

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.069 
the force causes pain in that in the
back<00:01:32.220> area<00:01:32.549> and<00:01:32.909> you<00:01:33.420> hear<00:01:33.630> a<00:01:33.659> lot<00:01:33.780> of<00:01:33.900> times

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
back area and you hear a lot of times

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.289 
back area and you hear a lot of times
referral<00:01:34.590> pain<00:01:34.860> or<00:01:35.040> radiating<00:01:35.460> pain<00:01:35.790> there's

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
referral pain or radiating pain there's

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.819 
referral pain or radiating pain there's
slightly<00:01:36.540> different<00:01:36.930> things<00:01:37.110> radiating<00:01:37.619> pain

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
slightly different things radiating pain

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.830 
slightly different things radiating pain
is<00:01:38.040> usually<00:01:38.159> coming<00:01:38.579> from<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.790> spine<00:01:39.150> where

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
is usually coming from the spine where

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.200 
is usually coming from the spine where
the<00:01:39.960> nerves<00:01:40.430> come<00:01:41.430> out<00:01:41.520> of<00:01:41.640> next<00:01:42.060> to<00:01:42.119> the

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
the nerves come out of next to the

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.149 
the nerves come out of next to the
joints<00:01:42.689> and<00:01:42.930> if<00:01:43.110> there's<00:01:43.290> impingement<00:01:43.829> of<00:01:44.009> the

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
joints and if there's impingement of the

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.530 
joints and if there's impingement of the
nerve<00:01:44.310> right<00:01:44.610> and<00:01:44.790> like<00:01:44.909> that<00:01:45.090> that<00:01:45.299> nerve
