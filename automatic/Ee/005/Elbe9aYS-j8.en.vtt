I'm<00:00:00.269> gonna<00:00:00.480> talk<00:00:00.750> at<00:00:00.900> first<00:00:00.979> about<00:00:01.979> portal

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
I'm gonna talk at first about portal

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.220 
I'm gonna talk at first about portal
harmony<00:00:02.760> which<00:00:03.120> is<00:00:03.330> most<00:00:03.780> of<00:00:03.929> you<00:00:04.020> probably

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230 
harmony which is most of you probably

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.019 
harmony which is most of you probably
know<00:00:04.560> that<00:00:04.920> that's<00:00:05.130> when<00:00:05.460> you<00:00:05.549> stack<00:00:05.819> things

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:06.029 
know that that's when you stack things

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.220 
know that that's when you stack things
and<00:00:06.330> fourths<00:00:07.160> if<00:00:08.160> I<00:00:08.309> take<00:00:08.490> a<00:00:08.519> scale<00:00:08.849> and<00:00:09.210> I<00:00:09.450> if<00:00:10.080> I

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
and fourths if I take a scale and I if I

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:11.990 
and fourths if I take a scale and I if I
start<00:00:10.500> with<00:00:10.530> a<00:00:10.650> C<00:00:10.980> for<00:00:11.190> example<00:00:11.280> on<00:00:11.730> the<00:00:11.820> g

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
start with a C for example on the g

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.230 
start with a C for example on the g
string<00:00:12.030> here<00:00:13.019> and<00:00:13.320> I<00:00:13.830> go<00:00:14.009> down<00:00:14.219> 1/4<00:00:14.610> I'd<00:00:14.969> get<00:00:15.210> a

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
string here and I go down 1/4 I'd get a

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.680 
string here and I go down 1/4 I'd get a
G<00:00:16.250> and<00:00:17.250> then<00:00:17.400> if<00:00:17.520> I<00:00:17.609> go<00:00:17.760> down<00:00:17.789> another<00:00:18.240> fourth<00:00:18.539> I

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
G and then if I go down another fourth I

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.689 
G and then if I go down another fourth I
get<00:00:18.840> a<00:00:18.869> D<00:00:19.170> that's<00:00:19.529> a<00:00:19.740> chordal<00:00:20.100> voicing<00:00:20.490> or<00:00:20.580> a

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
get a D that's a chordal voicing or a

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:23.420 
get a D that's a chordal voicing or a
fourth<00:00:20.970> chord<00:00:21.240> voicing<00:00:22.070> what<00:00:23.070> I'm<00:00:23.189> going<00:00:23.400> to

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
fourth chord voicing what I'm going to

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.099 
fourth chord voicing what I'm going to
do<00:00:23.580> is<00:00:23.699> I'm<00:00:23.850> going<00:00:24.029> to<00:00:24.119> walk<00:00:24.330> up<00:00:24.600> the<00:00:24.720> C<00:00:24.930> major

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
do is I'm going to walk up the C major

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.970 
do is I'm going to walk up the C major
scale<00:00:25.609> using<00:00:27.260> essentially<00:00:28.260> that<00:00:28.380> shape<00:00:28.740> or

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
scale using essentially that shape or

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.030 
scale using essentially that shape or
using<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.490> notes<00:00:30.119> from<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.359> C<00:00:30.539> major<00:00:30.689> scale

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:31.040 
using the notes from the C major scale

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.780 
using the notes from the C major scale
so<00:00:32.040> if<00:00:32.130> I<00:00:32.250> have<00:00:32.520> D<00:00:32.730> G<00:00:32.969> C<00:00:33.000> I<00:00:34.190> will<00:00:35.190> walk<00:00:35.399> up<00:00:35.610> and

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
so if I have D G C I will walk up and

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:42.410 
so if I have D G C I will walk up and
play<00:00:35.969> community<00:00:37.550> and<00:00:38.550> then<00:00:38.760> FBE<00:00:40.790> know<00:00:41.790> FB<00:00:42.180> is

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
play community and then FBE know FB is

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.600 
play community and then FBE know FB is
actually<00:00:42.870> sometimes<00:00:43.110> referred<00:00:43.680> to<00:00:43.710> as<00:00:43.890> an

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
actually sometimes referred to as an

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.490 
actually sometimes referred to as an
Augmented<00:00:44.969> fourth<00:00:45.360> chord<00:00:45.690> or<00:00:45.870> in<00:00:46.020> perfect

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
Augmented fourth chord or in perfect

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.139 
Augmented fourth chord or in perfect
fourth<00:00:46.739> chord<00:00:47.010> because<00:00:47.640> there's<00:00:47.879> an

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
fourth chord because there's an

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.459 
fourth chord because there's an
Augmented<00:00:48.629> fourth<00:00:48.809> in<00:00:49.020> there<00:00:49.170> which<00:00:49.320> is

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
Augmented fourth in there which is

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.650 
Augmented fourth in there which is
erased<00:00:49.770> for<00:00:50.719> between<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.930> a<00:00:53.629> normally<00:00:54.629> a

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
erased for between the a normally a

erased for between the a normally a
fourth<00:00:54.960> is<00:00:55.110> F<00:00:55.289> to<00:00:55.440> be<00:00:55.559> flat<00:00:55.860> but<00:00:56.129> B<00:00:56.699> flat<00:00:56.940> isn't

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
fourth is F to be flat but B flat isn't

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.150 
fourth is F to be flat but B flat isn't
contained<00:00:57.719> in<00:00:57.870> the<00:00:57.960> C<00:00:58.140> major<00:00:58.170> scale<00:00:58.500> this<00:00:59.010> is

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
contained in the C major scale this is

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.439 
contained in the C major scale this is
all<00:00:59.309> diatonic<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.059> C<00:01:00.239> major<00:01:00.420> so<00:01:01.379> I<00:01:01.440> have<00:01:01.559> F<00:01:01.739> PE

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:02.449 
all diatonic to C major so I have F PE

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:09.700 
all diatonic to C major so I have F PE
and<00:01:03.449> then<00:01:03.629> you<00:01:03.930> see<00:01:04.170> F<00:01:04.350> a<00:01:04.890> d<00:01:05.790> g<00:01:06.500> b<00:01:07.500> EA<00:01:07.740> gu<00:01:08.400> c<00:01:09.360> FB

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
and then you see F a d g b EA gu c FB

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.170 
and then you see F a d g b EA gu c FB
and<00:01:10.710> I'm<00:01:10.920> back<00:01:11.159> where<00:01:11.369> I<00:01:11.400> started<00:01:11.490> but<00:01:11.939> an

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
and I'm back where I started but an

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.170 
and I'm back where I started but an
octave<00:01:12.330> higher<00:01:12.540> on<00:01:12.960> D<00:01:13.200> G<00:01:13.409> C<00:01:13.820> have<00:01:14.820> you<00:01:14.939> put<00:01:15.090> it

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
octave higher on D G C have you put it

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:23.060 
octave higher on D G C have you put it
all<00:01:15.270> together<00:01:19.460> G<00:01:20.460> on<00:01:20.640> top<00:01:20.939> and<00:01:21.240> then<00:01:21.450> D<00:01:22.229> G<00:01:22.500> C<00:01:22.530> my

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
all together G on top and then D G C my

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:32.780 
all together G on top and then D G C my
name<00:01:23.509> you<00:01:24.509> put<00:01:24.720> all<00:01:24.810> that<00:01:24.930> together<00:01:25.110> it's<00:01:31.790> okay

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
name you put all that together it's okay

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.670 
name you put all that together it's okay
now<00:01:33.000> we<00:01:33.299> can<00:01:33.479> add<00:01:33.659> something<00:01:33.930> to<00:01:34.200> that<00:01:34.229> to<00:01:34.530> make

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
now we can add something to that to make

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.319 
now we can add something to that to make
it<00:01:34.710> a<00:01:34.860> little<00:01:34.979> bit<00:01:35.220> more<00:01:35.400> interesting<00:01:35.880> if<00:01:36.150> I

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
it a little bit more interesting if I

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.960 
it a little bit more interesting if I
was<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.540> take<00:01:36.720> this<00:01:36.869> cord<00:01:37.200> first<00:01:37.829> one<00:01:38.130> what<00:01:38.939> I

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
was to take this cord first one what I

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.390 
was to take this cord first one what I
can<00:01:39.180> do<00:01:39.270> is<00:01:39.390> play<00:01:39.570> a<00:01:39.869> diatonic<00:01:40.470> sequence<00:01:41.040> on

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
can do is play a diatonic sequence on

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.319 
can do is play a diatonic sequence on
top<00:01:41.759> melodically<00:01:42.479> so<00:01:42.750> from<00:01:42.960> a<00:01:43.820> if<00:01:44.820> I<00:01:44.970> go<00:01:45.149> up<00:01:45.240> a

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
top melodically so from a if I go up a

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.270 
top melodically so from a if I go up a
third<00:01:45.600> in<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:45.899> C<00:01:46.079> major<00:01:46.110> scale<00:01:46.439> it's<00:01:47.189> a<00:01:47.369> same

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280 
third in the C major scale it's a same

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.940 
third in the C major scale it's a same
so<00:01:50.280> what<00:01:50.399> I<00:01:50.460> can<00:01:50.640> do<00:01:50.729> is<00:01:50.850> I<00:01:51.000> can<00:01:51.060> keep<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.540> court

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
so what I can do is I can keep the court

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.380 
so what I can do is I can keep the court
sustained<00:01:53.299> and<00:01:54.299> just<00:01:54.509> change<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.930> ia

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
sustained and just change the ia

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.570 
sustained and just change the ia
up<00:01:56.570> to<00:01:56.780> see<00:01:57.140> and<00:01:57.470> if<00:01:57.650> I<00:01:57.770> want<00:01:57.979> I<00:01:58.070> can<00:01:58.190> actually

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:58.580 
up to see and if I want I can actually

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.560 
up to see and if I want I can actually
pick<00:01:58.790> the<00:01:58.909> note<00:01:59.229> or<00:02:00.229> I<00:02:00.320> can<00:02:00.560> hammer<00:02:00.770> on<00:02:01.570> and

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:02.570 
pick the note or I can hammer on and

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.149 
pick the note or I can hammer on and
then<00:02:02.720> what<00:02:02.870> I<00:02:02.900> do<00:02:02.990> is<00:02:03.200> just<00:02:03.229> walk<00:02:03.590> up<00:02:03.800> the<00:02:03.890> scale

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 
then what I do is just walk up the scale

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:05.980 
then what I do is just walk up the scale
and<00:02:04.190> do<00:02:04.580> the<00:02:04.670> same<00:02:04.909> thing<00:02:05.180> so<00:02:05.390> the<00:02:05.510> next<00:02:05.720> chord

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
and do the same thing so the next chord

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:12.370 
and do the same thing so the next chord
would<00:02:06.080> have<00:02:06.229> B<00:02:06.440> on<00:02:06.470> top<00:02:07.780> up<00:02:08.780> to<00:02:09.020> T<00:02:09.940> and<00:02:10.940> then<00:02:11.720> FBE

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
would have B on top up to T and then FBE
