00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:04.070
 but 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:16.110
 honour 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.930
 2 times a day dear friends of me 

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:30.850
 name is Vladislav and glad to welcome you 

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:32.920
 on the review mods for the game spintires here with 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:36.280
 him literally a few hours ago 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.000
 came out for this game 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.570
 truck 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.930
 mango heisst from the movie Fast and the Furious 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.340
 This is how it is in stock 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.830
 he zil-130 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:50.309
 but now let's check see 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:53.850
 what addons does he have 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:56.680
 what this car is and 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:00.010
 so here we have 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:04.110
 addons are all your own and sound 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:06.610
 by the way too so here we have a munga bad 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.549
 here it is a regular 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:15.659
 her platform can be mounted yet 

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:20.640
 cards with a tap like this it's all done 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:25.180
 let's remove now we have a munga in 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.200
 one of us, he already comes with features that is 

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:30.399
 first is 300 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:33.820
 repair points and secondly this 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:35.969
 here is the board that opens and 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:35.969
 closes 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:42.590
 also we have bad one manga too 300 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:47.470
 repair points gives 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:47.470
 and this time there are already two abortions 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:57.229
 farther we go beat this one from us 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:02.570
 adds driver 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:06.290
 let's add it I think you know more 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:08.200
 on the demo some modders put 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:11.540
 him in his car 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:16.130
 next we have medium log trailer well 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:18.770
 it is essentially a trailer dissolution 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:26.090
 that is, we need to add a screech card 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:30.170
 rain and then dissolution itself let's it 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:33.130
 Now we ’ll remove all business from our wheels 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:36.200
 all wheels, too, again own 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:41.480
 Here we stand the most common for those 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:47.050
 here heavy duty is essentially wheels 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:52.630
 tractor t-150 then double me too 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:55.630
 t-150 and the last we already go otmaza 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.630
 7310 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:02.069
 that's actually 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:05.560
 by addon, that's it for now 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:11.319
 so say load this car 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:15.760
 logs and when i get to the logger I 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:20.860
 continue recording and so here i am on 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:22.470
 logging I took b3 manga and into it we 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:26.380
 we can download 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:31.720
 short logs let's do it here 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:34.270
 when the whole thing looks like this let's 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:36.370
 we will start the car just time we rewind 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:39.070
 start up the car this way 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:41.250
 no need to wait how everything is done very much 

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.250
 quickly 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:47.430
 I also want to say that the car is not 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:50.030
 very fast even if increased fleece 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.030
 will be that is 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:55.170
 he rides he 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.170
 slowly say so 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:01.360
 Well I will continue recording when doedu 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:04.890
 Sawmill 

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.750
 to show how implemented 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:07.400
 unloading 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:12.590
 Does not pass or does not occur 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:15.160
 manhole bugs it will literally be through 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:15.160
 couple of seconds 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:20.530
 so dear friends i got to 

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:25.690
 sawmills 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:25.690
 let's actually unload and 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:32.030
 so as a result of sea trials 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.760
 identify the pros and cons of this 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:36.410
 car from the pros want to note 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:40.190
 good cross 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:41.870
 as well as damage ie they 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.830
 normally applied that is, they 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:45.920
 are present 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:49.210
 but from cons I want to note big 

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:53.360
 fuel consumption ie without differential 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:55.940
 he eats 20 liters per minute 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:05:02.210
 and with the differential this number comes to 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:05:04.880
 5 acres 47 48 so somewhere also that 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:07.580
 I want to say that when I rode it was damaged 

00:05:04.880 --> 00:05:10.220
 a little and now this one began to twitch 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:14.420
 Now the board, I think that this is connected with 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:18.680
 damage yes that is also necessary 

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:23.090
 na reflected well then on this pine 

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:26.840
 saying you can and finish my review if 

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:31.490
 you support the idea of ​​reviewing mods with 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:36.020
 voice put like comment and I 

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:38.530
 I wish you a good mood and to new 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:38.530
 meeting
