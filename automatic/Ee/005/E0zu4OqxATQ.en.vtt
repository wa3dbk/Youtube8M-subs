start with all the bullet points present

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.789 
start with all the bullet points present
on<00:01:04.500> your<00:01:05.220> screen<00:01:05.689> first<00:01:06.689> thing<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:07.049> do<00:01:07.200> is<00:01:07.650> you

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
on your screen first thing to do is you

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.330 
on your screen first thing to do is you
have<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:08.159> change<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:09.030> color<00:01:09.270> of<00:01:09.920> your<00:01:10.920> bullet

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.510 
have to change the color of your bullet
points<00:01:11.729> to<00:01:11.880> a<00:01:12.030> color<00:01:12.869> code<00:01:13.200> with<00:01:14.130> less

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
points to a color code with less

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.320 
points to a color code with less
contrast<00:01:15.060> so<00:01:15.420> with<00:01:15.869> a<00:01:15.900> conscious<00:01:16.380> or<00:01:17.090> or<00:01:18.090> with

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
contrast so with a conscious or or with

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.609 
contrast so with a conscious or or with
the<00:01:18.420> color<00:01:18.630> quite<00:01:18.960> similar<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.500> the

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
the color quite similar to the

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.700 
the color quite similar to the
background<00:01:20.210> what<00:01:21.210> you<00:01:21.360> do<00:01:21.509> is<00:01:21.750> right-click<00:01:22.080> on

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
background what you do is right-click on

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.880 
background what you do is right-click on
the<00:01:22.860> port<00:01:23.130> points<00:01:23.520> change<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:24.000> font<00:01:24.240> and<00:01:24.479> you

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
the port points change the font and you

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.890 
the port points change the font and you
continue<00:01:25.890> two<00:01:26.040> more<00:01:26.250> colors<00:01:26.520> this<00:01:27.450> has<00:01:27.869> a

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
continue two more colors this has a

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.390 
continue two more colors this has a
reason<00:01:28.409> it<00:01:28.560> might<00:01:28.710> become<00:01:28.920> a<00:01:29.100> little<00:01:29.250> bit

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
reason it might become a little bit

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.710 
reason it might become a little bit
clearer<00:01:29.640> when<00:01:29.820> you<00:01:30.000> see<00:01:30.240> it<00:01:30.329> later

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
clearer when you see it later

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.429 
clearer when you see it later
so<00:01:31.320> what<00:01:31.860> I'll<00:01:31.950> choose<00:01:32.340> here<00:01:32.640> is<00:01:32.850> a<00:01:32.990> light<00:01:33.990> gray

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
so what I'll choose here is a light gray

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:40.420 
so what I'll choose here is a light gray
and<00:01:35.689> I'll<00:01:36.689> apply<00:01:37.680> this<00:01:37.829> for<00:01:38.790> my<00:01:39.119> bullet<00:01:39.960> points

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:40.430 
and I'll apply this for my bullet points

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.609 
and I'll apply this for my bullet points
now<00:01:41.430> you<00:01:41.490> have<00:01:41.729> to<00:01:41.880> add<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.180> animation<00:01:42.619> for

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
now you have to add the animation for

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.359 
now you have to add the animation for
this<00:01:43.770> you<00:01:44.460> again<00:01:45.680> select<00:01:46.680> your<00:01:47.040> bullet<00:01:47.340> points

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:47.690 
how this looks like so you get your
slides<00:03:43.470> and<00:03:44.989> by<00:03:45.989> continuing<00:03:46.410> bullet<00:03:47.190> for

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
slides and by continuing bullet for

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.870 
slides and by continuing bullet for
bullet<00:03:48.079> only<00:03:49.079> the<00:03:49.739> present<00:03:50.400> bullet<00:03:50.669> is

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
I'll go back to our PowerPoint

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:03.680 
I'll go back to our PowerPoint
presentation<00:03:59.040> to<00:03:59.489> the<00:03:59.930> working<00:04:00.930> area<00:04:02.329> now<00:04:03.329> the

presentation to the working area now the

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.559 
presentation to the working area now the
second<00:04:04.139> option<00:04:04.230> is<00:04:04.769> a<00:04:05.220> little<00:04:05.700> bit<00:04:05.819> easier<00:04:06.299> you
