- Hi Everybody

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.500
Today, we are going to learn how to make 'gotgamssam'

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.320
it's a traditional Korean dessert, or snack

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.520
very easy and using all natural ingredients

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.740
walnuts and dried persimmons

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:26.680
Let's start!

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.340
Large sided walnuts, I prepared

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:31.760
Dried Persimmons, it's very soft

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.160
This is imported from Korea, Semi-dried

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.360
First, I am going to show how to make this with this dried Persimmon

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.360
Top part, cut it like this

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:43.660
clean

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.980
also, this part here

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:55.140
and, cut this in like a half, but don't go through because we are going to open this guy

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.580
so open it, the inside, there are some seeds

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.280
this part also, trim this

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:06.160
it's a nice, beautiful shape

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.420
so, open it

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.320
here is seed

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.020
wrinkly part is going to the bottom, like this

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.020
okay so, whole one walnut...

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.720
two...

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:25.860
three.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.080
and then roll

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:42.940
press this all together

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.480
We did six dried persimmons. We made this, three rolls

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.920
and then keep these in the plastic bag, like this

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.120
keep in the freezer

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.200
when you need it, you take it out, one by one and slice this and serve with tea!

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:05.880
okay, and then i'm going to show you how to make this with this type of dried Persimmon.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.260
use your knife and cut this way

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.460
and...

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.600
take off this part

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.600
and open.

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.980
as you part, also, let's trim this

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.980
roll it

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:03.220
and press this.. okay

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.900
You guys may watch this video and may think 'oh, what should I do, we don't have dried Persimmons!'

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:19.420
don't worry!

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.360
So, apricot. dried apricots really turns out good and... pretty colour!

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.260
So i'm going to show you how to do it. Same method!

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:30.200
First, I make it smooth. Like this...

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.140
Let's cut all these things first

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:43.480
open...

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:51.800
so here, the leftovers

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.120
a little stretch like this!

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:03.500
and..

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.860
okay, close this

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:27.140
if there is a gap, use your fingers and press this

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:41.020
keep this in the freezer until you need it.

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.980
So let's slice this!

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.380
okay, my last one...

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.380
take it out

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:37.680
Okay, this is one box of six dried persimmons, I made this

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:41.200
Dried Persimmon and it's going to be a large size

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:57.160
okay, beautiful!

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:04.260
I'm so happy about this. So I didn't fail any, one dried persimmon

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:06.960
so it's really, really pretty isn't it?

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:09.580
so, apricot...

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:14.440
when this is a little frozen, you see, more easily, you can cut it

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:32.680
Apricot and Dried Persimmons, two kinds of Dried Persimmons

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:34.800

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:37.720
