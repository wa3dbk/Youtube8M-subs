00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
no matter where they're from it's really

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.150 
no matter where they're from it's really
great<00:01:40.020> because<00:01:40.080> there's<00:01:40.500> a<00:01:40.620> really<00:01:40.860> heavily

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:41.160 
great because there's a really heavily

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.180 
great because there's a really heavily
focused<00:01:42.150> on<00:01:42.480> theoretical<00:01:43.410> background<00:01:43.800> that

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:44.190 
focused on theoretical background that

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:45.590 
focused on theoretical background that
helps<00:01:44.520> them<00:01:44.580> go<00:01:44.760> back<00:01:44.940> to<00:01:45.150> wherever<00:01:45.330> they're

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
helps them go back to wherever they're

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.810 
helps them go back to wherever they're
from<00:01:45.630> I<00:01:46.140> suppose<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.100> big<00:01:47.250> difference<00:01:47.610> that<00:01:47.790> I

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
from I suppose the big difference that I

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.690 
from I suppose the big difference that I
noticed<00:01:48.240> from<00:01:48.450> coming<00:01:48.780> back<00:01:48.810> home<00:01:49.170> is<00:01:49.700> that

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
noticed from coming back home is that

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.310 
noticed from coming back home is that
over<00:01:50.940> there<00:01:51.090> all<00:01:51.300> tests<00:01:51.660> are<00:01:51.780> written<00:01:52.110> and

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
over there all tests are written and

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.740 
over there all tests are written and
hear<00:01:52.590> their<00:01:52.770> oral<00:01:53.220> which<00:01:54.090> makes<00:01:54.330> it<00:01:54.450> actually

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
hear their oral which makes it actually

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.960 
hear their oral which makes it actually
really<00:01:54.960> stressful<00:01:55.590> because<00:01:56.160> you<00:01:56.490> really<00:01:56.820> have

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
really stressful because you really have

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:58.310 
really stressful because you really have
to<00:01:57.150> learn<00:01:57.270> everything<00:01:57.510> in<00:01:57.870> order<00:01:57.990> to<00:01:58.170> get<00:01:58.290> a

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
to learn everything in order to get a

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.230 
to learn everything in order to get a
good<00:01:58.500> mark<00:01:58.710> and

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
good mark and

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.270 
good mark and
let's<00:02:00.750> say<00:02:00.869> we<00:02:00.900> didn't<00:02:01.710> really<00:02:01.799> like<00:02:02.009> that<00:02:02.159> at

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
let's say we didn't really like that at

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.410 
let's say we didn't really like that at
the<00:02:02.369> beginning<00:02:02.460> but<00:02:02.790> we've<00:02:02.970> noticed<00:02:03.270> that

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
the beginning but we've noticed that

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.600 
the beginning but we've noticed that
it's<00:02:03.540> it's<00:02:03.899> really<00:02:04.170> it<00:02:04.920> really<00:02:04.950> helps<00:02:05.520> you

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
it's it's really it really helps you

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:06.800 
it's it's really it really helps you
learn<00:02:05.790> and<00:02:06.060> I<00:02:06.090> really<00:02:06.299> makes<00:02:06.450> sure<00:02:06.600> that<00:02:06.630> you
