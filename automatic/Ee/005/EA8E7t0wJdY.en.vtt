00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:10.530
 Singing without sad heat without color 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.030
 Burning your dry leaf to pain 

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:18.530
 Hands that are not, sad but they are 

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.530
 Broken but dry in the sun 

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:26.530
 I sing that at the end whispering goes 

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:31.030
 His riddled soul moved 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:35.030
 To my heart that without decision 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.030
 It started to rain winter tears 

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.030
 But when my voice is covered in your voice 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.030
 Singing is our great link 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.030
 The earth wrote furrows with its voice 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.030
 The sad verse of his song 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.330
 Scar to the sun seeks its color 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:07.030
 Marks that I leave a day a love 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.830
 Far but it's close but it's going 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.530
 Scar to the time his steps 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.030
 That to his heart, that when looking back 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.530
 He remained quiet and dry his voice 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.330
 But if your voice gets entangled in your voice 

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.830
 I can imagine our wings in the sun 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.530
 Flying pain, leaving without voice 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.530
 Flying pain 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.530
 Song of that sea burst again 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.030
 Your waves wait for your color 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.030
 But this one exclaimed because his pain 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.030
 I keep it in the background e 'your heart 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.030
 Far but it's close but it's going 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.830
 Scar to the time his steps 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.030
 This whisper so soft that the wind made him sing 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.030
 With great emotion 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.530
 That color finally found its voice 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.030
 As a vine in his years 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.630
 That the years are time of your voice 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.530
 That our eternal hands are 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.530
 Flying pain, leaving without voice 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:49.030
 Fly the pain my heart 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.430
 Flying pain, leaving without voice 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:57.030
 Flying pain 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:15.530
 If in my laments the wind sounds caressing my pain 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:24.030
 I would tear her out of that story to lose me with her voice 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:31.730
 And if I was very awake I would cry that pain 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:39.530
 But if that dream were to end it would scream with my voice 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:42.530
 My voice, your voice 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:48.330
 If in my laments the wind sounds caressing my pain 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:58.030
 I would tear her out of that story to lose me with her voice 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:04.530
 And if I was very awake I would cry that pain 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:14.530
 But if that dream were to end he would go back to his nest 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:39.030
 Song of that sea 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:51.030
 Go back to your nest
