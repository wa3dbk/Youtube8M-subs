00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:44.500
 difficult or impossible but it is not impossible 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:47.770
 it's very easy and good is ten minutes and 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:51.400

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:53.350
 application that is such a big bite code and 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:01:00.450

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:17.200

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:27.830
 here we have what would be normal 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:30.610
 local andrÃ©s or what would be in 0.5 we go 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.610
 to delete this folder 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:39.410
 we have to open the 0.10 point 5 and 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:41.750
 let's go disappear from this that 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:45.050
 will be four folders that is art assets 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:47.000
 lime times and rest and good they all have 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.979
 At the end of a slice we have to go to the 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.430
 three below and the first one that is 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:54.920
 Android manifested point xml 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.950
 we have to go there and we are not going to change 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.860
 nothing we have to lower I can but not 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:03.399
 change anything here where it says only 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:06.649
 here where it says 

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:09.080
 page manifested with point mollar 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:11.720
 minecraft and cheesemaking here not here not 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.640
 get out of there the only thing that is not going to 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.260
 do nothing the only thing they are going to do is 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:19.379
 add an other 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.689
 Well now when they have to give it to 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:27.510
 behind 

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:30.959
 ok ok and now we have to wait for 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:33.680
 everything is good we have to wait 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:36.530
 expect to wait and there are no classes thank you 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:39.329
 and well, the truth is that this 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:42.060
 florence are some friends tell me 

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:44.579
 let's meet five whips points the 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.140
 customers a few months download in the 

00:02:44.579 --> 00:02:48.540
 two versions and I tell you that you can not 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.670
 it tells me if it can be clear 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:54.299
 let's say the video they like the 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:56.760
 This option on how to do it already and 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:59.310
 then what now as you can see maybe 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:03.000
 the sip applies them and 0.3 points 5 the 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:05.340
 first that will be the one applying this one that goes 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:10.980
 to come out like that at point zero points point 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:13.739
 five why good because it's fast and 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:16.799
 Well, the day of the chat in this case 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:19.319
 of a chip and 0.5 pecan in simple and 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:22.349
 complete the five points apk 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:26.069
 and here on the contrary the one that we change 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:28.560
 I would say point means now what 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:30.920
 we have to go is the operator of 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.920
 records 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.010
 in this case 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:46.760
 and you have to go to the same folder in the 

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:49.250
 who edited the apply in this case 

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:51.320
 I also know from my favorite we're going to 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:57.220
 down down down and then here and 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:57.220
 we have what would be better 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:10.470
 but good for you to see that you have to 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:12.060
 do the second bodily we have 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.120
 that our second pressure to see 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:18.420
 If it is rename, we will not renew it 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:22.230
 only and as the goal without him and good 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:24.810
 well now trying to install they go to 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:27.000
 can see that in this case through this 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:28.950
 Goalkeeper I do not have this version installed 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.070
 I already have both of you for us 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:34.140
 decant not this but it's very easy I'm 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:35.610
 at pleasure of lay with many that I have more 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:37.940

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.940
