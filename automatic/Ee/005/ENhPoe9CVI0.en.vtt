keeping the fan Friday shenanigans going
with<00:00:04.200> a<00:00:04.350> stump<00:00:04.830> Fisk<00:00:05.069> all<00:00:05.460> right<00:00:05.670> and<00:00:05.940> I<00:00:06.180> also

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
with a stump Fisk all right and I also

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:07.880 
with a stump Fisk all right and I also
like<00:00:06.540> the<00:00:06.660> rest<00:00:06.810> of<00:00:06.870> this<00:00:06.990> team<00:00:07.200> as<00:00:07.379> well<00:00:07.560> and

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
like the rest of this team as well and

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.860 
like the rest of this team as well and
the<00:00:08.309> opponent's<00:00:08.639> also<00:00:08.849> potentially<00:00:09.660> bringing

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
the opponent's also potentially bringing

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.749 
the opponent's also potentially bringing
mega<00:00:10.139> steelix<00:00:10.349> most<00:00:10.889> likely<00:00:11.219> so<00:00:11.429> this<00:00:11.580> could

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
mega steelix most likely so this could

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:13.940 
mega steelix most likely so this could
be<00:00:12.300> a<00:00:12.330> really<00:00:12.690> nice<00:00:12.840> battle<00:00:13.139> to<00:00:13.349> watch<00:00:13.469> now

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
be a really nice battle to watch now

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.070 
be a really nice battle to watch now
Berto<00:00:14.460> I<00:00:14.639> believe<00:00:14.940> it's<00:00:15.420> one<00:00:15.599> that<00:00:15.719> started

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080 
Berto I believe it's one that started

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.720 
Berto I believe it's one that started
using<00:00:16.320> stump<00:00:16.680> this<00:00:16.859> can<00:00:17.010> well<00:00:17.130> go<00:00:17.340> or<00:00:17.460> at<00:00:17.550> least

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
using stump this can well go or at least

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.519 
using stump this can well go or at least
showed<00:00:17.970> me<00:00:18.090> something<00:00:18.480> about<00:00:18.570> it<00:00:18.720> we<00:00:19.410> know

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
showed me something about it we know

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.590 
showed me something about it we know
Berto<00:00:19.980> torkoal<00:00:20.400> guy<00:00:20.580> and<00:00:20.850> it<00:00:21.210> was<00:00:21.300> more<00:00:21.420> of<00:00:21.480> a

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
Berto torkoal guy and it was more of a

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.660 
Berto torkoal guy and it was more of a
singles<00:00:21.990> set<00:00:22.500> but<00:00:22.800> this<00:00:23.010> this<00:00:23.490> could<00:00:23.609> be

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
singles set but this this could be

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:24.920 
singles set but this this could be
interesting<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:24.210> almost<00:00:24.480> like<00:00:24.539> is<00:00:24.689> it<00:00:24.810> going

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
interesting and almost like is it going

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.570 
interesting and almost like is it going
to<00:00:25.080> support<00:00:25.380> cradle<00:00:25.769> E<00:00:25.800> is<00:00:26.070> it<00:00:26.189> going<00:00:26.400> to<00:00:26.490> be

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
to support cradle E is it going to be

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.540 
to support cradle E is it going to be
like<00:00:26.609> some<00:00:27.060> kind<00:00:27.300> of<00:00:27.390> hidden<00:00:27.900> carry<00:00:28.320> high<00:00:29.189> jump

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
like some kind of hidden carry high jump

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.810 
like some kind of hidden carry high jump
kick<00:00:29.609> that<00:00:29.910> was<00:00:30.029> going<00:00:30.210> to<00:00:30.300> lead<00:00:30.539> and<00:00:30.779> destroy

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:31.820 
kick that was going to lead and destroy

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.100 
kick that was going to lead and destroy
cradling<00:00:32.820> not<00:00:33.059> quite<00:00:33.360> knocking<00:00:33.719> out<00:00:33.870> but

cradling not quite knocking out but

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.459 
cradling not quite knocking out but
leaving<00:00:34.500> it<00:00:34.649> with<00:00:35.130> very<00:00:35.489> little<00:00:35.730> hit<00:00:35.940> points

00:00:36.459 --> 00:00:36.469 
leaving it with very little hit points

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:39.740 
leaving it with very little hit points
not<00:00:37.469> good<00:00:37.680> right<00:00:37.860> there<00:00:38.129> and<00:00:38.910> stump<00:00:39.390> fisk<00:00:39.600> is

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
not good right there and stump fisk is

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.060 
not good right there and stump fisk is
going<00:00:39.989> to<00:00:40.050> go<00:00:40.110> flat<00:00:40.290> surf<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:40.710> that's<00:00:40.890> what<00:00:41.040> I

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
going to go flat surf and that's what I

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.740 
going to go flat surf and that's what I
was<00:00:41.219> wondering<00:00:41.340> like<00:00:41.790> are<00:00:42.210> we<00:00:42.270> going<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:42.600> see

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
was wondering like are we going to see

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.420 
was wondering like are we going to see
that<00:00:42.780> surf<00:00:43.140> from<00:00:43.320> the<00:00:43.469> stump<00:00:43.739> is<00:00:43.920> it<00:00:44.219> has<00:00:44.399> a

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
that surf from the stump is it has a

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.279 
that surf from the stump is it has a
crazy<00:00:44.730> little<00:00:45.120> move<00:00:45.300> set<00:00:45.510> for<00:00:45.719> what<00:00:45.840> typing<00:00:46.200> it

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
crazy little move set for what typing it

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.340 
crazy little move set for what typing it
has<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:46.680> then<00:00:47.160> it's<00:00:47.579> going<00:00:47.789> to<00:00:47.910> boost<00:00:48.350> cradle

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
has and then it's going to boost cradle

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.529 
has and then it's going to boost cradle
e<00:00:49.469> with<00:00:49.920> that<00:00:50.070> storm<00:00:50.370> drain<00:00:50.489> dust<00:00:50.879> nor<00:00:51.210> going

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
e with that storm drain dust nor going

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.260 
e with that storm drain dust nor going
for<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.989> trick<00:00:52.410> room<00:00:52.649> though<00:00:52.860> I<00:00:53.190> don't<00:00:54.000> think

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
for the trick room though I don't think

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.240 
for the trick room though I don't think
that<00:00:54.420> was<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.719> best<00:00:54.899> play<00:00:55.289> because<00:00:55.739> that

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
that was the best play because that

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.590 
that was the best play because that

cradle e has a chance of surviving so
that's<00:01:02.670> going<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:03.000> be<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.420> surf<00:01:03.719> coming<00:01:03.989> in

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.770 
there that's too much on that special
and<00:03:14.599> on<00:03:15.560> all<00:03:16.220> that<00:03:16.519> boosting<00:03:16.970> it's<00:03:17.209> pretty

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
and on all that boosting it's pretty

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.720 
and on all that boosting it's pretty
much<00:03:17.900> done<00:03:18.230> so<00:03:18.799> now<00:03:18.920> cradle<00:03:19.280> II<00:03:19.370> know<00:03:19.489> it<00:03:19.609> that

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
much done so now cradle II know it that

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:21.729 
much done so now cradle II know it that
Giga<00:03:20.120> Drain<00:03:20.299> sustains<00:03:20.750> coming<00:03:21.049> through<00:03:21.170> with

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
Giga Drain sustains coming through with

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:23.650 
Giga Drain sustains coming through with
the<00:03:21.769> surf<00:03:22.100> set<00:03:22.370> up<00:03:22.519> and<00:03:23.120> I<00:03:23.269> think<00:03:23.329> that's

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
the surf set up and I think that's

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:26.770 
the surf set up and I think that's
pretty<00:03:24.049> cool<00:03:24.230> right<00:03:24.290> there<00:03:24.790> so<00:03:25.790> we<00:03:26.510> know<00:03:26.660> it

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
pretty cool right there so we know it

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.300 
pretty cool right there so we know it
does<00:03:26.930> someone's<00:03:27.200> go<00:03:27.290> down<00:03:27.829> to<00:03:27.980> pretty<00:03:28.220> much

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
does someone's go down to pretty much

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:29.620 
does someone's go down to pretty much
anything<00:03:28.639> by<00:03:28.880> this<00:03:28.940> point<00:03:29.150> twisted

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
anything by this point twisted

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.420 
anything by this point twisted
dimensions<00:03:29.959> return<00:03:30.260> normal<00:03:30.620> and<00:03:30.859> that's<00:03:31.280> a

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
dimensions return normal and that's a

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.789 
dimensions return normal and that's a
forfeit<00:03:32.000> right<00:03:32.209> there<00:03:32.450> so<00:03:33.049> pretty

00:03:33.789 --> 00:03:33.799 
forfeit right there so pretty

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:35.050 
forfeit right there so pretty
interesting<00:03:34.040> didn't<00:03:34.730> even<00:03:34.819> need<00:03:35.000> the

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
interesting didn't even need the

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:36.910 
interesting didn't even need the
superior<00:03:35.630> or<00:03:35.780> the<00:03:35.900> guard<00:03:36.079> war<00:03:36.260> and<00:03:36.680> I<00:03:36.709> think

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
superior or the guard war and I think

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.199 
superior or the guard war and I think
that<00:03:37.040> the<00:03:37.160> superior<00:03:37.579> guard<00:03:37.760> war<00:03:37.940> has<00:03:38.060> some

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
that the superior guard war has some

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:39.879 
that the superior guard war has some
