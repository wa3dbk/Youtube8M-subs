00:00:01.249 --> 00:00:03.050
 good Sunday to all 

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:06.380
 yesterday how and perhaps some of you will know I was 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:08.479
 in Milan 

00:00:08.479 --> 00:00:12.009
 and I did some fairly moderate shopping in short 

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:16.470
 as usual I promise myself not to buy anything but I can't do it then 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.919
 let's say I got it - thank you for speed 

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:22.269
 I was by car 

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:25.220
 and I bought 4 questions 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:26.439
 I took 2 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:29.439
 of these smart 600 eye shadows 

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:34.620
 that I had never seen sincerely and there are very nice though 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.160
 I chose these two colors 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.160
 it is a peach color 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.030
 it's a dead and a color 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:47.960
 female hello 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.860
 than in the sun e 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.330
 we highlight brown infinity 

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:57.740
 motomix then excel on offer say that corrective in you 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.740
 pension survivor and that you love friends you know 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:02.660
 and I don't 

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:05.830
 I was attracted to this 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.560
 ah you live I hope it's clear 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.560
 I never had the political cycle, since I often have 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.580
 pimples or how many TV series 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.100
 I thought to 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.410
 to try it in the package 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:25.110
 micro duvet 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.940
 and then the classical guitar package 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:29.250
 salt shaker 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.280
 the color is very equal cute the summer tour 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.460
 for omnia 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.399
 I really liked the fact that all of them will decide one 

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:39.740
 but if I'm not mistaken, a closer one is pink 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.170
 has a plant 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.170
 I don't remember the skill shots any more 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.719
 belieber the antinati in short 

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:50.160
 - highly proteic the whole face 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.510
 but therefore I am 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:56.720
 they intrigued me and I wanted to try t max used for tomorrow morning is a pencil 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.590
 that I was advised by my comfortable life now on the net 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:02.590
 the gazette of noon hello 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.640
 and interesting because it's called you never know nor part 2 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:11.940
 will not be seen 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.940
 I don't think either 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:20.129
 a flesh-colored pencil 

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:23.189
 since I bought that year 

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:26.189
 of the beta patty clutch serial number and the chromography 

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:32.169
 and I really liked it a lot I thought I'd look for a subspecies of 

00:02:32.169 --> 00:02:35.169
 this is not exactly the same in the same key 

00:02:36.469 --> 00:02:38.009
 does the same job e 

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:43.299
 meeting between post lovers now I remember 15 16 euros this post a 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:47.009
 90 euros and his work does it perfectly I don't know if you see here 

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:48.729
 trick with today 

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:50.079
 summit name 

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:51.430
 inside the eye 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.430
 now the absurd ball 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:59.279
 and still support then say that this 

00:02:59.279 --> 00:03:02.559
 it can be a great substitute for the earth but I miss nothing then I am 

00:03:02.559 --> 00:03:04.730
 passed by crazy obviously er 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.630
 peugeot released to the nuns of brera the new summer collection into the the 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:10.489
 wombats 

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:14.980
 but I do not know if I already have a million things millions of colors 

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:20.749
 you are really nice but there is nothing that particularly struck me 

00:03:20.749 --> 00:03:21.409
 way 

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:22.380
 Chiambretti 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.289
 d mineral aiesec 

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:26.179
 divided into three strips 

00:03:26.179 --> 00:03:29.839
 they make beautiful colors but like all mineral assemblies they don't write 

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:32.179
 fact therefore they are not worth the price you 

00:03:32.179 --> 00:03:33.289
 what are they? 

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:35.829
 they were very nice carving gas 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:37.189
 n contributions 

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:40.189
 but the infinite in color in bioenergy 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.389
 lipstick issue 

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:44.369
 rita and colors 

00:03:44.369 --> 00:03:45.609
 they didn't pull me 

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:47.039
 almost for nothing 

00:03:47.039 --> 00:03:49.170
 and yes there was a beautiful gu 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.500
 mine murderous instincts in the PCs of the enlightened 

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:56.699
 the athletic hotmail we are a lot but on the other hand I already have one on the tones 

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:58.539
 of pink I will finish charlie 

00:03:58.539 --> 00:04:01.309
 not to go out just feel like people 

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:05.349
 then decided the method of francesco monte and after sending the Phoenicians - 

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:07.979
 and too few for neymar 

00:04:07.979 --> 00:04:10.979
 and then I bought the two two two 

00:04:11.969 --> 00:04:14.809
 brush v to fade 

00:04:14.809 --> 00:04:17.099
 eh already dirty that I used it this morning 

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:20.099
 mail and destiny that I show you only for restaurants 

00:04:20.629 --> 00:04:23.059
 and it is a brush to blend venus 

00:04:23.059 --> 00:04:24.759
 I have no batteries now 

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:29.180
 your 17 for comparison but if you know the web 17 is shorter 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:30.180
 it's wider 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.240
 mind these being l 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.199
 sorry sorry but you 

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:38.270
 ends more pinned even a little more rigid 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:42.420
 in the sector and therefore a more precise work can be done 

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:44.879
 many people 

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:47.050
 I'm sorry, I got 2 on 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:49.020
 eye shadows and rows 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.020
 a color that I never thought of buying 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.499
 let's avoid wearing today 

00:04:55.499 --> 00:04:58.259
 water of both 

00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:00.759
 with everybody beautiful 

00:05:00.759 --> 00:05:04.099
 I usually know you don't use every autumn 

00:05:04.099 --> 00:05:05.080
 the blues 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:08.689
 jaundice but I let myself be convinced because this really beautiful color 

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:12.629
 and then a color for a second child later 

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.710
 me amber 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:17.409
 bronzed 

00:05:17.409 --> 00:05:20.409
 metallic 

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:27.969
 sorry I already have the window open for ipad and petalismo then 

00:05:27.969 --> 00:05:31.240
 they will feel like they were from Nuremberg 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.610
 however this is amber aids 

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.449
 who is beautiful and in we say that 

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:39.449
 It's been a while since I called this sad and now it does 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:44.620
 and from marco finished I was really good xd 

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:49.620
 since we were around here we stopped 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:52.339
 supplements we stopped at the essence 

00:05:52.339 --> 00:05:53.470
 ansa ruby 

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:57.280
 see the ss and there too the collection is 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:59.979
 I didn't prefer guardialfiera 

00:05:59.979 --> 00:06:03.219
 practically it was lazialita there was nothing left for the exhibitor 

00:06:03.219 --> 00:06:06.330
 absolutely wanna maybe I still turned it off 

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:08.800
 so I bought myself some more nail polish 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:11.710
 because I don't have enough 

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:12.979
 this of the 

00:06:12.979 --> 00:06:15.979

00:06:21.529 --> 00:06:23.650
 blur album 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:26.800
 then this of the line dissolving thugs made a breach 

00:06:27.979 --> 00:06:29.949
 beautiful purple 

00:06:29.949 --> 00:06:32.949
 metallic with reflections 

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:40.119
 teams I took a transparent base 

00:06:40.119 --> 00:06:42.520
 whitening because lately 

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:45.699

00:07:05.169 --> 00:07:08.589
 and the birds are immediately 

00:07:08.589 --> 00:07:10.129
 the very latest purchase 

00:07:10.129 --> 00:07:12.129
