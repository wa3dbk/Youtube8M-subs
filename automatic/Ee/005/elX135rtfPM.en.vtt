00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:07.589
 hello everyone from pharmacies arthur and today 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:10.080
 We will be the next video by 59 16 in 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.840
 this time I am at the bottom of the list just 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.780
 the fight that did not want to get 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.279
 most of the players 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.770
 which one is pumping this tank and 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.750
 trying to get married faster 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:25.320
 getting into such a rainbow for the more we 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.539
 here we are on the city map and how 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.320
 we know light tanks urban 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:33.180
 terrain fought especially difficult usually 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.200
 commit or ritual suicide 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:39.660
 light centered or just no good 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.489
 doesn't bring much to your team here 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.469
 need to clearly know a certain position 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:47.309
 for flashes in this case on ensk 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:49.379
 you can become right in the middle of 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.780
 porsche stereo tubes try to somehow 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.699
 will find an opponent of course this is not 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.730
 always brings which is better 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.930
 super results but often it turns out 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.600
 thereby 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.660
 counter a couple of medium tanks if 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.939
 you will be on time and the dances will be 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.549
 any more so that they 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.830
 well lit up this time like 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.659
 see it for the light brings no 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.119
 good but i don’t despair 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:17.369
 I only see that they lit up the center and 12 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.409
 I don't go there, but now I stand 100 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:22.409
 while I'm in the scrap from whom I cut out about 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:24.990
 move on the main thing in such battles 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.240
 this is here to catch this wave here 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.780
 there is a main thing not to rush ahead of time 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.400
 as soon as you understand what your team is 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.500
 starts to win on someone flank 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.210
 you should move there, too, it 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.070
 for example, riding on Zelenka and see 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.680
 that the city is beginning to press ours actively 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.960
 you must or how there 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:45.509
 it would seem why he is a city cat because 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.030
 that it will always come in handy because 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.890
 LT is always useful as an active 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:52.260
 support that is 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.270
 if you work from behind your back 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.909
 Allies are necessarily unnecessary. 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.340
 interfere with eat you don't have to ride 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.229
 right next to your tanks you should 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.070
 be at the distance at which 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.450
 you can apply 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:05.820
 where use has been applied 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.810
 deliver on caterpillars distract 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.740
 the enemy and at the right moment when 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.959
 phase is coming 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:15.240
 normal skirmish im melee phase 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:18.510
 active you must be very close 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:22.020
 in time to pounce on defenseless 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:24.660
 feed your opponents and distract them 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.970
 damage them and believe me there is nothing 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.230
 worse it up to play on a heavy tank and on 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.660
 you out steam cynics 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.959
 This is when it comes to you asked 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:36.739
 scale as it is now ns 50f 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:39.000
 who can't decide on that 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:42.269
 mean shoot or is he just now on 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.180
 recharge steal hopeless situation 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:47.150
 Here he found a throw and if it were not for me 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.820
 he would calmly make out the seven 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.560
 but since I'm here I was in the area 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.750
 clean eaten do not have time normally 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.870
 shoot and it's certainly for him very much 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:01.500
 sad tasteless and pleasant as 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:03.470
 throw on a ten and right now 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.400
 when it is already clear that we have an account 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.500
 slowly leveling in our favor 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.709
 although we lost completely Zelenka 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:13.500
 but at the expense of this quick rush 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:15.390
 the city we pushed through and now we are going to 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:18.450
 seize the enemy base and mustache and 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:20.280
 there is no time left for enemy Fri 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.140
 to take our base, he needs 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.450
 run run give your 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.390
 in this case, the first thing to do 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.380
 are you suffering 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.739
 of course you can try to stand on 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.900
 capture 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:32.260
 but it may be better to lower costs 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.690
 someone more slowly 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:37.670
 you somehow lt-shke still fly 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:40.970
 will not fly over determined 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:43.280
 try 3 detect and drink here 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:47.209
 I drove until he sacrifices video back batchat 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:49.400
 and would not be afraid to put their own 

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:51.709
 bang that I have quite successfully 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.200
 it turns out and right after that I take on 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:57.170
 avtopritsel artillery hid here for 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:59.000
 such a small house and started a pony 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:01.000
 of course I don’t really 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.550
 it turns out by not to cause damage back 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.760
 only I understand that now I will be 

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:07.900
 counter 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:10.670
 I ’m leaving now because 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.850
 it's time to take revenge on the heights of 50 foursomes 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:18.410
 for stupid on cumulative 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:20.510
 my feed is not necessary so of course not in vain 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:23.570
 me wortell attention but too much 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:26.410
 late if opponents used to be against me 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:28.840
 notice and start us goal this 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:31.310
 it is quite possible that they would have time 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:35.030
 shoot more in particular this 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:38.690
 concerns the enemy 50b 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:39.470
 and here is such a flying fight nothing 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:43.250
 special 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:46.490
 thoughts of the movie more flexible this is what I love 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:47.210
 light tanks i.e. this is never 

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:50.810
 straining 

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:52.150
 it's always nice to have fun like this 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:54.680
 to pound 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:57.770
 I think everyone should try this 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:59.630
 gameplay and don't give up on this one 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:02.479
 Nagu course you can lose 

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:05.840
 any indicators on average there 

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:08.570
 overall damage or moderate survival 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:10.160
 for me it is not particularly important therefore I 

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:13.250
 calmly everyone on these machines 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:15.400
 I will move in general who liked nagib
