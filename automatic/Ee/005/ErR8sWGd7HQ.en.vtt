switch that we mounted up here in the
corner<00:01:40.140> near<00:01:40.259> this<00:01:40.470> engine<00:01:40.829> nozzle<00:01:41.189> I<00:01:41.220> just

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
corner near this engine nozzle I just

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:42.950 
corner near this engine nozzle I just
waved<00:01:41.670> this<00:01:41.909> magnet<00:01:42.360> over<00:01:42.600> it<00:01:42.689> and<00:01:42.810> will

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
waved this magnet over it and will

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.260 
waved this magnet over it and will
change<00:01:43.170> speed<00:01:43.500> so<00:01:43.619> let<00:01:43.740> me<00:01:43.829> do<00:01:43.950> this<00:01:44.130> and<00:01:44.369> we

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
change speed so let me do this and we

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.580 
change speed so let me do this and we
can<00:01:45.420> go<00:01:45.509> faster<00:01:45.960> and<00:01:46.079> faster<00:01:46.229> and<00:01:46.500> faster<00:01:46.560> here

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:48.590 
can go faster and faster and faster here

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:50.569 
can go faster and faster and faster here
try<00:01:49.590> it<00:01:49.619> once<00:01:49.829> more<00:01:49.920> we're<00:01:50.280> getting<00:01:50.430> a<00:01:50.460> little

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
try it once more we're getting a little

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:58.789 
try it once more we're getting a little
bit<00:01:50.729> faster<00:01:54.259> and<00:01:55.259> faster<00:01:55.500> still<00:01:57.649> you've<00:01:58.649> got

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
bit faster and faster still you've got

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.260 
bit faster and faster still you've got
to<00:01:58.920> hit<00:01:59.009> that<00:01:59.070> thing<00:01:59.399> just<00:01:59.640> right<00:01:59.939> I'm<00:02:00.090> trying

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
to hit that thing just right I'm trying

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.630 
to hit that thing just right I'm trying
to<00:02:00.390> get<00:02:00.509> it<00:02:00.600> to<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:00.950> go<00:02:01.950> to<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.100> top<00:02:02.340> speed

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
to get it to the go to the top speed

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.230 
to get it to the go to the top speed
there<00:02:02.820> we<00:02:02.909> go

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
there we go

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.630 
there we go
going<00:02:03.860> pretty<00:02:04.860> good<00:02:05.100> clip<00:02:05.340> and<00:02:05.520> then<00:02:05.579> we'll

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
going pretty good clip and then we'll

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.770 
going pretty good clip and then we'll
hit<00:02:05.759> it<00:02:05.880> once<00:02:06.030> more<00:02:06.210> it<00:02:06.360> should<00:02:06.509> go<00:02:06.600> really

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
hit it once more it should go really

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.770 
hit it once more it should go really
fast<00:02:07.079> there<00:02:07.530> we<00:02:07.649> go<00:02:08.119> you<00:02:09.119> can<00:02:09.179> see<00:02:09.450> it's<00:02:09.569> got<00:02:09.750> a

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
fast there we go you can see it's got a

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.839 
fast there we go you can see it's got a
beautiful<00:02:09.989> effect<00:02:10.560> all<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:10.860> way<00:02:11.069> around<00:02:11.370> the

painted on this match that up to the

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.960 
painted on this match that up to the
model<00:02:38.820> like<00:02:39.030> I<00:02:39.150> said<00:02:39.360> from<00:02:39.720> the<00:02:39.780> film<00:02:40.340> so<00:02:41.340> we

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
model like I said from the film so we

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.699 
model like I said from the film so we
had<00:02:42.090> a<00:02:42.120> lot<00:02:42.300> of<00:02:42.330> fun<00:02:42.570> with<00:02:42.720> this<00:02:42.840> one<00:02:43.050> it<00:02:43.500> took

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.020 
us a while but we were we were working

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.449 
us a while but we were we were working
on<00:02:46.110> several<00:02:46.500> other<00:02:46.620> projects<00:02:47.070> at<00:02:47.160> the<00:02:47.220> same

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
on several other projects at the same

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.760 
on several other projects at the same
time<00:02:47.760> and<00:02:48.180> we're<00:02:49.080> going<00:02:49.200> to<00:02:49.230> be<00:02:49.350> sending<00:02:49.560> this

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
time and we're going to be sending this

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.410 
time and we're going to be sending this
one<00:02:49.920> out<00:02:50.040> to<00:02:50.220> Ralph<00:02:50.430> now<00:02:50.700> at<00:02:50.820> tenant<00:02:51.090> controls

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
one out to Ralph now at tenant controls

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:52.699 
one out to Ralph now at tenant controls
I<00:02:51.630> think<00:02:51.840> then<00:02:51.959> he's<00:02:52.110> going<00:02:52.230> to<00:02:52.290> send<00:02:52.530> it<00:02:52.620> over

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
I think then he's going to send it over

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:56.360 
I think then he's going to send it over
to<00:02:53.060> Tony<00:02:54.060> over<00:02:54.269> at<00:02:54.480> fantastic<00:02:54.810> plastics<00:02:55.530> so<00:02:55.709> we

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370
