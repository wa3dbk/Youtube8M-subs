 i'm talking about the dlc this patch what 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.999
 what it will do basically will be to touch many 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:00.469
 many errors the list you have in the 

00:00:58.999 --> 00:01:02.059
 description if you want to switch to 

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:04.250
 see it and such is quite long but good 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:05.600
 say the most important of what is most 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.560
 the users were complaining the input 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.850
 the people 3 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.470
 It has always been a problem with 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:13.100
 battlefield 3 discomfort return it to 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:15.409
 improve to touch it again have always 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.909
 tried to touch it and touch it touch it with 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:18.289
 each patch and hopefully this time it's 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:20.420
 the definitive one put them so that 

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:22.310
 understand people is the delay that 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.659
 between you give him the button and what 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.429
 does the doll on screen really 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:26.899
 it's a pretty important thing not 

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:30.289
 many times in importance due to 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:35.119
 even thickness TV on the signal in 

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:37.939
 sometimes the exact time of nothingness 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:40.340
 time is a lot of luxury online ie 

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:41.869
 a lot in a game really still 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.520
 many people do not pass them but in 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:45.200
 Generally, it usually happens, but not 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.909
 happens that sometimes because I do not know they are not in 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.310
 the human eye for saying one way but 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:50.810
 we are that aside, maybe we can 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.270
 have one in a game as this is 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.470
 a pretty bitch thing not in the 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.610
 stability today or is it also going to 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.170
 touch to say that someone 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.360
 lost in the audio suddenly or the 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.220
 micros or things like that and well they're also going to 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.229
 touch the go to rebalance and this for 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.209
 few I said were for ps3 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:08.989
 then the rebalancing of some weapons already 

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:11.030
 everyone will play the n-400 16 the l 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:15.080
 85 a 2 law bar 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:20.360
 the fame is the ag-53 the bucket 95 sees the 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:23.420

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:28.069
 bugs of some of some weapons there is no 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.660
 many more things about some maps 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:31.489
 as well as with the description I had this 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.600
