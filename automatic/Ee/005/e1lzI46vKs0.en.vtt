00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:04.190 
so here's my lovely bike my ducati 749

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:06.980 
so here's my lovely bike my ducati 749
I'm<00:00:05.190> making<00:00:05.520> this<00:00:05.609> video<00:00:05.759> to<00:00:06.240> show<00:00:06.600> you<00:00:06.629> where

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
I'm making this video to show you where

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.540 
I'm making this video to show you where
I<00:00:07.020> place<00:00:07.440> the<00:00:08.480> GoPro<00:00:09.480> to<00:00:09.750> hero<00:00:10.370> which<00:00:11.370> I

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:11.550 
I place the GoPro to hero which I

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.010 
I place the GoPro to hero which I
mounted<00:00:11.969> on<00:00:12.090> the<00:00:12.450> rear<00:00:12.719> swingarm<00:00:13.380> of<00:00:13.920> my<00:00:14.280> bike

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:15.020 
mounted on the rear swingarm of my bike

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:17.660 
mounted on the rear swingarm of my bike
located<00:00:16.020> on<00:00:16.109> the<00:00:16.170> spool<00:00:16.619> where<00:00:17.100> you<00:00:17.250> put<00:00:17.460> the

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
located on the spool where you put the

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.179 
located on the spool where you put the
rear<00:00:18.240> stand<00:00:18.510> it's<00:00:19.380> really<00:00:19.590> not<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:19.980> greatest

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
rear stand it's really not the greatest

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.609 
rear stand it's really not the greatest
place<00:00:20.550> to<00:00:20.910> place<00:00:21.359> it<00:00:21.539> because<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:22.199> swingarm

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
place to place it because the swingarm

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.650 
place to place it because the swingarm
adjust<00:00:23.039> to<00:00:23.189> the<00:00:23.310> conditions<00:00:23.760> of<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.060> road<00:00:24.269> and

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
adjust to the conditions of the road and

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.410 
adjust to the conditions of the road and
so<00:00:25.289> you<00:00:26.010> will<00:00:26.130> see<00:00:26.189> some<00:00:26.550> vibrations<00:00:27.150> in<00:00:27.330> the

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
so you will see some vibrations in the

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.080 
so you will see some vibrations in the
video<00:00:27.720> but<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:29.010> most<00:00:29.400> important<00:00:29.849> thing<00:00:29.880> I

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
video but the most important thing I

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.729 
video but the most important thing I

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
just purchased this mic over am I co ve

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.130 
just purchased this mic over am I co ve
are<00:00:35.040> and<00:00:35.340> what<00:00:35.969> it<00:00:36.059> basically<00:00:36.090> does<00:00:36.540> it

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
are and what it basically does it

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.850 
are and what it basically does it
reduces<00:00:37.829> the<00:00:38.250> wind<00:00:39.000> noise<00:00:39.350> that<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.500> camera

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
reduces the wind noise that the camera

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:45.709 
reduces the wind noise that the camera
picks<00:00:41.129> up<00:00:41.280> as<00:00:41.520> is<00:00:41.760> recording<00:00:42.300> so<00:00:43.489> i<00:00:44.510> made<00:00:45.510> two

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
picks up as is recording so i made two

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.729 
picks up as is recording so i made two
videos<00:00:45.870> one<00:00:46.140> video<00:00:47.010> has<00:00:47.579> it<00:00:47.969> without<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:48.739> the

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
videos one video has it without and the

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.040 
videos one video has it without and the
other<00:00:49.890> video<00:00:50.219> has<00:00:50.520> it<00:00:50.789> with<00:00:51.030> so<00:00:51.360> you'll<00:00:51.840> be

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
other video has it with so you'll be

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.080 
other video has it with so you'll be
able<00:00:52.079> to<00:00:52.320> hear<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.770> difference<00:00:53.219> between<00:00:53.370> with

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
able to hear the difference between with

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:57.380 
able to hear the difference between with
it<00:00:54.329> with<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.020> mic<00:00:55.289> over<00:00:55.440> on<00:00:55.829> and<00:00:56.309> with<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.180> mic

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
it with the mic over on and with the mic

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.000 
it with the mic over on and with the mic
rover<00:00:57.840> off<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:59.750> you<00:01:00.750> make<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.289> decision<00:01:01.829> on

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
rover off and you make the decision on

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.479 
rover off and you make the decision on
if<00:01:02.250> if<00:01:02.879> it<00:01:03.180> works<00:01:03.480> or<00:01:03.690> if<00:01:03.809> it<00:01:03.930> doesn't<00:01:04.260> work

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
if if it works or if it doesn't work

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
worked really well the wind noise was

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.240 
worked really well the wind noise was
reduced<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:10.049> lot<00:01:10.619> and<00:01:12.020> i<00:01:13.020> just<00:01:13.740> want<00:01:13.799> to<00:01:13.979> put<00:01:14.220> a

00:05:29.209 --> 00:05:29.219 
unfortunately the the whole holes or the

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:31.369 
unfortunately the the whole holes or the
openings<00:05:29.759> are<00:05:29.940> actually<00:05:30.539> on<00:05:30.659> the<00:05:30.690> top<00:05:30.990> and<00:05:31.229> the

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:34.939 
openings are actually on the top and the
bottom<00:05:31.729> so<00:05:32.729> if<00:05:33.150> you<00:05:33.330> place<00:05:33.599> this<00:05:33.930> on<00:05:34.229> here<00:05:34.500> it

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:34.949 
bottom so if you place this on here it

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:39.559 
bottom so if you place this on here it
wouldn't<00:05:35.400> wouldn't<00:05:36.270> do<00:05:36.509> anything<00:05:38.000> I<00:05:39.000> was

00:05:39.559 --> 00:05:39.569 
wouldn't wouldn't do anything I was

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:41.209 
wouldn't wouldn't do anything I was
thinking<00:05:39.930> about<00:05:40.050> purchasing<00:05:40.650> another<00:05:40.889> one<00:05:41.129> of

00:05:41.209 --> 00:05:41.219 
thinking about purchasing another one of

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:44.330 
thinking about purchasing another one of
these<00:05:41.509> actually<00:05:42.509> cutting<00:05:43.229> it<00:05:43.500> in<00:05:43.650> half<00:05:43.680> and

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:44.340 
these actually cutting it in half and

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:49.580 
these actually cutting it in half and
placing<00:05:44.819> it<00:05:44.909> along<00:05:45.300> the<00:05:46.189> long<00:05:47.189> edges<00:05:48.229> but<00:05:49.229> I

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:49.590 
placing it along the long edges but I

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:52.879 
placing it along the long edges but I
don't<00:05:49.979> know<00:05:51.110> debating<00:05:52.110> on<00:05:52.229> doing<00:05:52.469> that<00:05:52.590> or<00:05:52.740> not

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:52.889 
don't know debating on doing that or not

00:05:52.889 --> 00:06:01.600 
don't know debating on doing that or not
but<00:05:53.419> it's<00:05:54.419> actually<00:05:54.779> used<00:05:55.289> for<00:05:59.120> flat<00:06:00.120> version

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:01.610 
but it's actually used for flat version
