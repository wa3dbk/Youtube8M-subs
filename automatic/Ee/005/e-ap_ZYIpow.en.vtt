00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
that's a acids in my an android phone so

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.880 
that's a acids in my an android phone so
I<00:01:59.460> can<00:01:59.579> skip<00:02:00.000> to<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.299> next<00:02:00.329> song<00:02:02.570> or<00:02:03.649> pause<00:02:04.649> it

I can skip to the next song or pause it

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.389 
I can skip to the next song or pause it
you<00:02:05.280> know<00:02:05.340> if<00:02:05.640> it<00:02:05.729> is<00:02:05.850> a<00:02:05.909> call<00:02:06.299> come<00:02:06.540> in<00:02:07.399> so

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
you know if it is a call come in so

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.070 
you know if it is a call come in so
that's<00:02:08.610> a<00:02:08.729> provider<00:02:09.090> convenience<00:02:09.720> so<00:02:10.020> you

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
that's a provider convenience so you

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.330 
that's a provider convenience so you
don't<00:02:10.289> need<00:02:10.379> to<00:02:10.440> take<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:10.890> phone<00:02:11.069> out<00:02:11.099> of<00:02:11.250> your

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
don't need to take the phone out of your

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.610 
don't need to take the phone out of your
pocket

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
pocket

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.869 
pocket
so<00:02:13.620> another<00:02:14.430> example<00:02:14.640> is<00:02:15.180> that<00:02:15.680> let<00:02:16.680> me<00:02:16.879> stop

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:17.879 
so another example is that let me stop

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:25.520 
so another example is that let me stop
this<00:02:20.239> ok<00:02:23.420> so<00:02:24.420> another<00:02:24.540> function<00:02:25.050> is<00:02:25.170> in<00:02:25.349> turn

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
this ok so another function is in turn

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.089 
this ok so another function is in turn
of<00:02:25.680> the<00:02:25.860> security<00:02:26.519> so<00:02:27.290> you<00:02:28.290> can<00:02:28.560> show<00:02:28.709> you<00:02:28.769> is

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
of the security so you can show you is

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:37.339 
of the security so you can show you is
to<00:02:29.700> such<00:02:30.090> function<00:02:34.880> ok<00:02:35.880> one<00:02:36.599> first<00:02:37.050> function

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:37.349 
to such function ok one first function

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:40.610 
to such function ok one first function
is<00:02:37.440> the<00:02:37.500> keyless<00:02:37.890> a<00:02:37.920> function<00:02:38.670> that<00:02:39.500> when<00:02:40.500> the

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
is the keyless a function that when the

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.670 
is the keyless a function that when the
phone<00:02:40.799> is<00:02:40.830> nearby<00:02:41.660> your<00:02:42.660> droid<00:02:43.379> android

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
phone is nearby your droid android

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.339 
phone is nearby your droid android
device<00:02:43.950> so<00:02:44.640> you<00:02:44.670> actually<00:02:44.940> don't<00:02:45.239> need<00:02:45.330> to<00:02:45.690> you

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:46.349 
device so you actually don't need to you

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:50.809
