you<00:04:00.290> think<00:04:00.530> it's<00:04:00.739> not<00:04:00.920> going<00:04:01.130> to<00:04:01.220> flow<00:04:01.370> up<00:04:01.430> the

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:01.610 
you think it's not going to flow up the

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:06.340 
you think it's not going to flow up the
entire<00:04:01.820> path<00:04:02.120> and<00:04:02.750> swish<00:04:03.200> it<00:04:04.750> tap<00:04:05.750> it<00:04:05.780> so<00:04:06.200> that

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:06.350 
entire path and swish it tap it so that

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:12.670 
entire path and swish it tap it so that
there's<00:04:06.530> no<00:04:10.989> maybe<00:04:11.989> I<00:04:12.049> should<00:04:12.200> tap<00:04:12.380> it<00:04:12.530> on<00:04:12.620> the

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
there's no maybe I should tap it on the

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:14.380 
there's no maybe I should tap it on the
hard<00:04:12.950> counter<00:04:13.489> that<00:04:13.670> would<00:04:13.820> work<00:04:13.970> out<00:04:14.120> better

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390 
hard counter that would work out better

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:26.310 
hard counter that would work out better
one<00:04:14.690> in<00:04:14.840> it<00:04:20.769> just<00:04:21.769> put<00:04:21.979> it<00:04:22.010> and<00:04:22.970> let<00:04:23.390> it<00:04:23.419> take

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:30.260 

set<00:04:27.320> the<00:04:27.440> timer

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.590 

and<00:04:31.050> voila<00:04:31.760> so<00:04:32.760> we'll<00:04:32.880> check<00:04:33.150> back<00:04:33.210> at<00:04:33.510> this

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:33.600 
and voila so we'll check back at this

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.930 
and voila so we'll check back at this
