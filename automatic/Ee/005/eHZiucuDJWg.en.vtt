00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:07.170
 harry fail beauty are not now 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.179
 more a personal video shocked revealed 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.530
 report telling them how much they 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.570
 They got how much they 're doing well. 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.250
 that year the ground team five in 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.470
 several other games in which they released this 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.820
 year and in this report also gave us the 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.560
 I do not know if this report was 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.130
 more together with thorium diesel 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.750
 they broke the news and that our dear 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:27.599
 involves being produced by 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.519
 creators the iof was deferred to 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.380
 February 10 , 2015 what was 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.610
 to be now at the end of the year and was 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.200
 postponed and will have to wait another 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.660
 little but not closed 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.100
 enough time between a thousand and more of the game 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.350
 of the magnitude he is training in 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.750
 size he is I think so in the 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.059
 my humble opinion is good news 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.559
 he was postponed because the game was 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.690
 A very big rap is on. 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.789
 lots of cool stuff happened too is 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.430
 new game mode is connected is a 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:56.129
 multiplayer that is 5 people 4 against 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.870
 one such a very new thing the owner is not 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.600
 obviously there are games that make this 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.340
 kind of game is gameplay i know you 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.140
 But I think it promises the crowd that 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.729
 more hardcore and know more 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.500
 something that I already knew some kind of 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.460
 the game but with the postponement of the 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.010
 play is to make them able to 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.150
 further explore not only the 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.680
 graph of the game but my part of 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.500
 gameplay and bring new things and 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.600
 cool thing'm on the game and left 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.939
 increasingly round as a proposal 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.220
 new problem they can go wrong and have 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.200
 much more chances of making mistakes 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.220
 so I think the postponement of the game will 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.290
 get them to get 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.119
 concentrate better and get type accept 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.280
 the things that probably were 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.320
 no pendant is connected also 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.420
 the alpha of the game that was going to have been now 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.460
 was going to be now in July and so on. 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.799
 June / July you had that inscription 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.810
 and nanny appears too late if you notice it 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.979
 It was delayed 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.270
 it seems like it will roll even more and more 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.189
 forward and so they decided 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.630
 delay because they still do not think 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.790
 finalized the way they want a 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.409
 game but I hope it will be a throw 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.939
 You think it's going to be you think 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.740
 it was a good game the expression bad game 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.270
 several trailers have here in the description of 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.549

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.469
 game place let edil you think 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.210
 be a good or bad game and neither would 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.469
 leave it there and cover yours by signing up
