00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
in the appearance of the cube so first I

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.980 
in the appearance of the cube so first I
did<00:00:22.080> about<00:00:22.320> 50<00:00:22.800> Sol's<00:00:23.100> around<00:00:23.789> there<00:00:24.029> before

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
did about 50 Sol's around there before

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.259 
did about 50 Sol's around there before
moving<00:00:25.310> lubing<00:00:26.310> and<00:00:26.550> tensioning<00:00:27.150> and

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
moving lubing and tensioning and

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.480 
moving lubing and tensioning and
stickering<00:00:27.779> and<00:00:28.109> then<00:00:28.740> I<00:00:28.769> lived<00:00:29.189> and

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
stickering and then I lived and

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.620 
stickering and then I lived and
stickered<00:00:29.970> it<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:30.330> a<00:00:31.700> lube<00:00:32.700> tension<00:00:33.210> Sicard

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
stickered it and a lube tension Sicard

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.139 
stickered it and a lube tension Sicard
it<00:00:33.750> got<00:00:34.079> better<00:00:34.350> did<00:00:34.710> about<00:00:34.950> 200<00:00:35.520> solves<00:00:35.940> and

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
it got better did about 200 solves and

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.639 
it got better did about 200 solves and
it<00:00:36.870> is<00:00:37.050> where<00:00:37.290> it<00:00:37.410> is<00:00:37.500> now<00:00:37.800> so<00:00:39.170> also<00:00:40.170> the

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.900 
shades which are pretty nice and but the
good<00:00:51.539> part<00:00:51.930> about<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:53.160> stickers<00:00:53.550> on<00:00:53.730> this

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
good part about the the stickers on this

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.020 
good part about the the stickers on this
at<00:00:54.149> out<00:00:54.629> of<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.840> box<00:00:55.050> are<00:00:55.980> that<00:00:56.190> they're<00:00:56.550> cut

at out of the box are that they're cut

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.650 
at out of the box are that they're cut
so<00:00:57.780> that<00:00:58.020> is<00:00:58.260> a<00:00:58.500> plus<00:00:58.949> you<00:00:59.430> may<00:00:59.850> want<00:01:00.629> to

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
so that is a plus you may want to

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.689 
so that is a plus you may want to
consider<00:01:01.020> not<00:01:01.260> even<00:01:01.590> restricting<00:01:01.980> it<00:01:02.399> they're

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
consider not even restricting it they're

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.620 
consider not even restricting it they're
pretty<00:01:03.270> nice<00:01:03.480> but<00:01:03.809> I<00:01:03.840> got<00:01:04.140> a<00:01:04.170> free<00:01:04.500> set<00:01:04.799> so<00:01:05.630> I

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
pretty nice but I got a free set so I

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.320 
pretty nice but I got a free set so I
replaced<00:01:07.260> it<00:01:07.549> yeah<00:01:08.549> if<00:01:08.700> you're<00:01:08.909> wondering

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.179 
replaced it yeah if you're wondering
half-bred<00:01:09.780> suppose<00:01:10.110> deep<00:01:10.350> blue<00:01:10.560> but<00:01:10.950> that

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
half-bred suppose deep blue but that

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.090 
half-bred suppose deep blue but that
doesn't<00:01:11.580> matter<00:01:11.780> okay<00:01:12.780> so<00:01:13.290> to<00:01:13.350> start<00:01:13.710> off<00:01:13.890> the

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
doesn't matter okay so to start off the

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.620 
doesn't matter okay so to start off the
review<00:01:14.549> I'll<00:01:14.939> quickly<00:01:15.600> do<00:01:15.780> some<00:01:16.080> turns<00:01:16.979> and

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
review I'll quickly do some turns and

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.700 
review I'll quickly do some turns and
also<00:01:18.630> solves<00:01:19.500> will<00:01:19.710> be<00:01:19.860> popping<00:01:20.430> up<00:01:20.850> over

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
also solves will be popping up over

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:25.130 
also solves will be popping up over
there<00:01:22.710> I<00:01:22.740> think<00:01:22.950> I'm<00:01:23.880> not<00:01:24.090> sure<00:01:24.150> but<00:01:24.960> I'm

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
there I think I'm not sure but I'm

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.620 
there I think I'm not sure but I'm
pretty<00:01:25.560> sure<00:01:25.799> it'll<00:01:26.130> be<00:01:26.400> in<00:01:26.549> split<00:01:26.939> screen<00:01:27.119> so

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
pretty sure it'll be in split screen so

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.069 
pretty sure it'll be in split screen so
just<00:01:28.400> you'll<00:01:29.400> see<00:01:29.729> what<00:01:30.180> I<00:01:30.210> mean<00:01:30.329> all<00:01:30.689> right<00:01:30.720> so

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
just you'll see what I mean all right so

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:45.190 
just you'll see what I mean all right so
I'll<00:01:31.229> do<00:01:31.439> some<00:01:31.619> turns

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.990 

okay<00:01:46.200> so<00:01:47.130> as<00:01:47.490> you<00:01:48.000> could<00:01:48.240> see<00:01:48.560> probably<00:01:50.000> you

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
okay so as you could see probably you

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.179 
okay so as you could see probably you
could<00:01:51.210> tell<00:01:51.420> that<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:51.810> turning<00:01:52.320> was<00:01:52.860> very

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
could tell that the turning was very

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.840 
could tell that the turning was very
fluent<00:01:54.030> right<00:01:54.930> there<00:01:55.229> and<00:01:55.500> very<00:01:56.009> smooth<00:01:56.549> with

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
fluent right there and very smooth with

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.170 
fluent right there and very smooth with
minimal<00:01:57.420> lockups<00:01:57.920> but<00:01:58.920> and<00:01:59.190> solve<00:01:59.549> sometimes

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
minimal lockups but and solve sometimes

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.679 
minimal lockups but and solve sometimes
on<00:02:00.600> lll<00:02:01.440> since<00:02:02.430> you're<00:02:02.580> going<00:02:02.700> full<00:02:03.119> speed<00:02:03.330> it

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
on lll since you're going full speed it

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.690 
on lll since you're going full speed it
locks<00:02:03.930> up<00:02:04.229> and<00:02:04.530> you<00:02:04.740> can't<00:02:05.009> turn<00:02:05.280> for<00:02:05.580> some

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
locks up and you can't turn for some

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.969 
locks up and you can't turn for some
reason<00:02:06.060> I<00:02:06.270> don't<00:02:06.750> really<00:02:07.170> know<00:02:07.380> why<00:02:07.530> that<00:02:07.560> is

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
reason I don't really know why that is

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:13.550 
reason I don't really know why that is

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.640 
cuber
has<00:02:14.700> the<00:02:14.910> same<00:02:15.150> problem<00:02:15.600> as<00:02:15.750> I'd<00:02:15.930> you<00:02:16.110> so<00:02:16.319> I<00:02:16.350> am

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
has the same problem as I'd you so I am

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:18.759 
has the same problem as I'd you so I am
not<00:02:16.890> completely<00:02:17.489> sure<00:02:17.700> what<00:02:18.090> that<00:02:18.150> is<00:02:18.360> but

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:18.769 
not completely sure what that is but

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:22.490 
not completely sure what that is but
yeah<00:02:19.769> it<00:02:20.010> gets<00:02:20.220> kind<00:02:20.459> of<00:02:20.549> annoying<00:02:21.500> but

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
yeah it gets kind of annoying but

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.330 
yeah it gets kind of annoying but
otherwise<00:02:22.830> the<00:02:23.310> turnings<00:02:23.730> pretty<00:02:24.060> nice<00:02:25.340> the

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
otherwise the turnings pretty nice the

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.270 
otherwise the turnings pretty nice the
feeling<00:02:26.819> out<00:02:27.000> of<00:02:27.030> the<00:02:27.150> box<00:02:27.440> was<00:02:28.440> very<00:02:28.980> very

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
feeling out of the box was very very

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.210 
feeling out of the box was very very
similar<00:02:29.610> to<00:02:29.880> an<00:02:30.000> a<00:02:30.090> su<00:02:30.420> now<00:02:31.290> that<00:02:31.709> feeling

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
similar to an a su now that feeling

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.580 
similar to an a su now that feeling
after<00:02:32.459> looming<00:02:33.360> intent<00:02:33.750> lubing<00:02:34.380> and

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
after looming intent lubing and

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:36.259 
after looming intent lubing and
tensioning<00:02:35.130> that<00:02:35.310> feeling<00:02:35.730> has<00:02:35.850> gone<00:02:36.090> away

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
tensioning that feeling has gone away

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:41.330 
tensioning that feeling has gone away
and<00:02:37.910> it's<00:02:38.910> feeling<00:02:39.900> more<00:02:40.290> like<00:02:40.530> my<00:02:40.890> way<00:02:41.100> long

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
and it's feeling more like my way long

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.750 
and it's feeling more like my way long
v1<00:02:41.940> you<00:02:42.660> know<00:02:42.780> more<00:02:43.080> of<00:02:43.230> a<00:02:43.410> bumpy<00:02:44.250> feeling

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
v1 you know more of a bumpy feeling

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.979 
v1 you know more of a bumpy feeling
smooth<00:02:46.160> but<00:02:47.160> it's<00:02:47.549> not<00:02:47.850> as<00:02:48.030> quite<00:02:48.390> as<00:02:48.570> slushy

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
smooth but it's not as quite as slushy

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:52.370 
smooth but it's not as quite as slushy
and<00:02:49.200> it's<00:02:49.650> also<00:02:49.920> not<00:02:50.430> as<00:02:50.820> it's<00:02:51.690> not<00:02:51.900> a<00:02:51.959> swishy

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
and it's also not as it's not a swishy

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.650 
and it's also not as it's not a swishy
assassin<00:02:53.100> and<00:02:53.220> it's<00:02:53.340> not<00:02:53.549> as<00:02:53.670> Bakke<00:02:53.970> as<00:02:54.209> my<00:02:54.450> way

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
assassin and it's not as Bakke as my way

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.349 
assassin and it's not as Bakke as my way
long<00:02:54.930> so<00:02:55.380> yeah<00:02:56.130> I'd<00:02:56.459> say<00:02:56.670> right<00:02:56.910> in<00:02:56.970> the<00:02:57.120> middle

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:57.359 
long so yeah I'd say right in the middle

00:02:57.359 --> 00:02:59.270 
long so yeah I'd say right in the middle
more<00:02:57.780> towards<00:02:58.200> the<00:02:58.410> way<00:02:58.560> long<00:02:58.769> do<00:02:59.010> you<00:02:59.070> want

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
more towards the way long do you want

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:05.900 
more towards the way long do you want
though<00:03:01.010> the<00:03:02.010> speed<00:03:02.400> is<00:03:03.329> very<00:03:03.630> very<00:03:04.380> fast<00:03:05.070> it's

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
though the speed is very very fast it's

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.870 
though the speed is very very fast it's
similar<00:03:06.600> to<00:03:06.780> the<00:03:07.130> speed<00:03:08.130> of<00:03:08.160> the<00:03:08.430> other<00:03:08.640> way

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:08.880 
similar to the speed of the other way

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:09.819 
similar to the speed of the other way
Long's

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:09.829 
Long's

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:13.810 
Long's
yeah<00:03:10.829> the<00:03:11.459> Ling<00:03:12.150> Long's<00:03:12.420> are<00:03:12.750> normally<00:03:13.320> fast

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820 
yeah the Ling Long's are normally fast

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.819 
yeah the Ling Long's are normally fast
most<00:03:14.820> of<00:03:15.000> you<00:03:15.150> probably<00:03:15.359> have<00:03:15.630> them<00:03:15.959> but<00:03:16.170> yeah

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:16.829 
most of you probably have them but yeah

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:21.860 
most of you probably have them but yeah
this<00:03:17.010> cube<00:03:17.340> is<00:03:17.670> very<00:03:18.030> fast<00:03:19.940> so<00:03:20.940> lock<00:03:21.180> ups<00:03:21.450> occur

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
this cube is very fast so lock ups occur

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:25.400 
this cube is very fast so lock ups occur
occasionally<00:03:22.290> for<00:03:22.890> me<00:03:23.010> on<00:03:23.640> this<00:03:24.060> cube<00:03:24.359> of<00:03:24.630> do

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
occasionally for me on this cube of do

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.960 
occasionally for me on this cube of do
to<00:03:25.560> over<00:03:25.920> shooting<00:03:27.230> because<00:03:28.519> of<00:03:29.519> the<00:03:29.760> very

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
to over shooting because of the very

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:32.449 
to over shooting because of the very
fast<00:03:30.329> speed<00:03:30.540> and<00:03:31.109> I'm<00:03:31.230> not<00:03:31.410> used<00:03:31.950> to<00:03:32.190> fast

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
fast speed and I'm not used to fast

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:36.319 
fast speed and I'm not used to fast
cubes<00:03:32.880> but<00:03:33.209> I<00:03:33.450> can<00:03:34.049> control<00:03:34.680> it<00:03:34.950> but<00:03:35.519> it<00:03:36.030> just

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:36.329 
cubes but I can control it but it just

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:38.840 
cubes but I can control it but it just
when<00:03:36.959> you're<00:03:37.170> going<00:03:37.470> full<00:03:37.680> speed<00:03:38.010> on<00:03:38.040> ll<00:03:38.609> outs

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
when you're going full speed on ll outs

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:43.400 
when you're going full speed on ll outs
it<00:03:39.239> just<00:03:39.600> overshoots<00:03:40.319> so<00:03:41.150> yeah<00:03:42.150> the<00:03:42.750> Fen<00:03:43.049> kind

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
it just overshoots so yeah the Fen kind

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:48.050 
it just overshoots so yeah the Fen kind
takes<00:03:43.769> a<00:03:43.920> lot<00:03:44.130> more<00:03:44.160> force<00:03:45.109> to<00:03:46.109> turn<00:03:46.819> so<00:03:47.819> that's

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
takes a lot more force to turn so that's

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.080 
takes a lot more force to turn so that's
probably<00:03:48.360> why<00:03:48.750> but<00:03:49.140> I'm<00:03:49.620> sure<00:03:50.010> if<00:03:50.159> you're<00:03:50.400> used

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
probably why but I'm sure if you're used

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.630 
probably why but I'm sure if you're used
to<00:03:51.269> fast<00:03:51.540> cubes<00:03:51.959> this<00:03:52.230> this<00:03:53.069> wouldn't<00:03:53.340> be<00:03:53.519> an

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
to fast cubes this this wouldn't be an

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:54.020 
to fast cubes this this wouldn't be an
issue

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:54.030 
issue

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:59.780 
issue
you<00:03:54.890> yeah<00:03:57.200> so<00:03:58.200> corner<00:03:58.740> cutting<00:03:58.980> on<00:03:59.250> this<00:03:59.400> cube

00:03:59.780 --> 00:03:59.790 
you yeah so corner cutting on this cube

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.860 
you yeah so corner cutting on this cube
is<00:04:00.120> pretty<00:04:00.870> good<00:04:01.080> so<00:04:01.860> I<00:04:02.430> have<00:04:03.300> my<00:04:03.480> keep<00:04:03.690> on

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
is pretty good so I have my keep on

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.830 
is pretty good so I have my keep on
pretty<00:04:04.380> tight<00:04:04.470> tension<00:04:05.069> so<00:04:05.490> it's<00:04:06.150> slightly

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
pretty tight tension so it's slightly

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.820 
pretty tight tension so it's slightly
less<00:04:07.260> than<00:04:07.290> 45<00:04:08.100> degrees<00:04:09.410> but<00:04:10.410> you<00:04:10.650> don't

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:10.830 
less than 45 degrees but you don't

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:16.340 
less than 45 degrees but you don't
really<00:04:11.010> need<00:04:11.280> more<00:04:11.489> than<00:04:11.670> that<00:04:14.450> oh<00:04:15.450> wow<00:04:16.079> it's

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.350 
really need more than that oh wow it's

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:19.009 
really need more than that oh wow it's
going<00:04:16.590> pretty<00:04:16.769> far<00:04:17.010> yeah<00:04:17.820> okay<00:04:18.570> and<00:04:18.780> then

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:19.019 
going pretty far yeah okay and then

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:21.740 
going pretty far yeah okay and then
reverse<00:04:19.829> corner<00:04:20.310> cutting<00:04:20.400> is<00:04:20.880> around<00:04:21.239> three

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
reverse corner cutting is around three

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.500 
reverse corner cutting is around three
quarters<00:04:22.500> of<00:04:22.530> a<00:04:22.800> Cuby<00:04:23.250> I'd<00:04:23.430> say<00:04:23.700> I'm<00:04:23.940> loose

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
quarters of a Cuby I'd say I'm loose

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.890 
quarters of a Cuby I'd say I'm loose
tensions<00:04:25.080> it's<00:04:26.040> up<00:04:26.430> to<00:04:26.730> here<00:04:27.150> and<00:04:27.360> then<00:04:27.630> on

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
tensions it's up to here and then on

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.830 
tensions it's up to here and then on
it's<00:04:28.350> up<00:04:28.740> to<00:04:28.950> here<00:04:29.250> normally<00:04:29.790> on<00:04:30.030> ya<00:04:30.690> know

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
it's up to here normally on ya know

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:33.950 
it's up to here normally on ya know
sentence<00:04:31.470> but<00:04:31.710> it<00:04:32.460> just<00:04:32.760> kept<00:04:33.030> that<00:04:33.240> so<00:04:33.510> corner

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
sentence but it just kept that so corner

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.659 
sentence but it just kept that so corner
cutting<00:04:34.230> is<00:04:34.350> really<00:04:34.830> good<00:04:34.980> even<00:04:35.160> on<00:04:35.400> tight

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:35.669 
cutting is really good even on tight

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:39.770 
cutting is really good even on tight
tension<00:04:36.150> so<00:04:37.040> popping<00:04:38.040> popping<00:04:38.760> is<00:04:39.300> very

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
tension so popping popping is very

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:45.020 
tension so popping popping is very
minimal<00:04:40.080> I<00:04:42.530> yeah<00:04:43.560> I'm<00:04:43.770> fairly<00:04:44.160> tight<00:04:44.520> tensions

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:45.030 
minimal I yeah I'm fairly tight tensions

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:49.060 
minimal I yeah I'm fairly tight tensions
my<00:04:45.270> cube<00:04:45.570> hasn't<00:04:45.900> even<00:04:45.990> come<00:04:46.290> close<00:04:46.650> at<00:04:47.580> all

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
my cube hasn't even come close at all

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:52.909 
my cube hasn't even come close at all
but<00:04:50.070> Romney<00:04:51.060> also<00:04:51.600> known<00:04:51.780> as<00:04:51.930> insane<00:04:52.410> cuber

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:52.919 
but Romney also known as insane cuber

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:55.010 
but Romney also known as insane cuber
has<00:04:53.160> told<00:04:53.460> me<00:04:53.580> he<00:04:53.790> has<00:04:53.940> gotten<00:04:54.300> some<00:04:54.510> pops<00:04:54.750> with

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
has told me he has gotten some pops with

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.740 
has told me he has gotten some pops with
this<00:04:55.200> cube<00:04:55.530> but<00:04:55.770> I<00:04:56.010> know<00:04:56.580> that<00:04:56.970> he<00:04:57.180> likes<00:04:57.419> loose

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 
this cube but I know that he likes loose

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:01.700 
this cube but I know that he likes loose
tensions<00:04:58.380> so<00:04:58.830> that<00:04:59.220> is<00:04:59.570> probably<00:05:00.570> why<00:05:01.260> he's

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:01.710 
tensions so that is probably why he's

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:06.469 
tensions so that is probably why he's
getting<00:05:01.890> some<00:05:02.250> pops<00:05:02.490> so<00:05:03.050> yeah<00:05:04.820> yeah<00:05:05.820> so<00:05:06.180> the

00:05:06.469 --> 00:05:06.479 
getting some pops so yeah yeah so the

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:09.500 
getting some pops so yeah yeah so the
mechanism<00:05:07.229> the<00:05:07.410> center<00:05:07.680> caps<00:05:07.950> are<00:05:08.370> very<00:05:08.700> very

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:09.510 
mechanism the center caps are very very

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:15.080 
mechanism the center caps are very very
similar<00:05:11.090> to<00:05:12.090> the<00:05:12.240> other<00:05:12.390> way<00:05:12.630> Long's<00:05:12.900> so<00:05:14.090> they

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:15.090 
similar to the other way Long's so they

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:17.630 
similar to the other way Long's so they
they'll<00:05:15.570> never<00:05:15.840> pop<00:05:16.260> up<00:05:16.530> they<00:05:16.979> stay<00:05:17.310> in<00:05:17.460> there

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:17.640 
they'll never pop up they stay in there

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:21.920 
they'll never pop up they stay in there
pretty<00:05:17.850> well<00:05:18.740> corners<00:05:19.740> have<00:05:20.100> an<00:05:20.220> extra<00:05:20.850> lip<00:05:21.180> so

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:21.930 
pretty well corners have an extra lip so

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:25.060 
pretty well corners have an extra lip so
I'm<00:05:22.229> not<00:05:22.380> really<00:05:22.590> sure<00:05:23.010> what<00:05:23.250> that<00:05:23.280> does<00:05:23.760> but

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:25.070 
I'm not really sure what that does but

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:27.710 
I'm not really sure what that does but
yeah<00:05:26.070> I<00:05:26.400> don't<00:05:26.640> know<00:05:26.850> if<00:05:27.060> it<00:05:27.240> helps<00:05:27.600> with

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:27.720 
yeah I don't know if it helps with

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:32.770 
yeah I don't know if it helps with
popping<00:05:28.320> or<00:05:28.470> what<00:05:28.680> but<00:05:29.039> you<00:05:29.310> know<00:05:30.800> the<00:05:31.800> edges

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:32.780 
popping or what but you know the edges

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:36.460 
popping or what but you know the edges
have<00:05:33.780> an<00:05:33.990> extra<00:05:34.470> wing<00:05:34.770> which<00:05:35.550> i<00:05:35.760> can<00:05:35.970> assume

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:36.470 
have an extra wing which i can assume

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:40.159 
have an extra wing which i can assume
helps<00:05:37.470> with<00:05:38.090> popping<00:05:39.090> anti<00:05:39.660> popping

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:40.169 
helps with popping anti popping

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:46.550 
helps with popping anti popping
mechanism<00:05:40.830> yeah<00:05:41.669> so<00:05:44.300> so<00:05:45.300> the<00:05:45.720> final<00:05:46.080> verdict

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560 
mechanism yeah so so the final verdict

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:49.370 
mechanism yeah so so the final verdict
is<00:05:46.890> in<00:05:46.950> my<00:05:47.520> opinion<00:05:48.030> this<00:05:48.450> cube<00:05:48.930> is<00:05:49.169> better

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:49.380 
is in my opinion this cube is better

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:53.270 
is in my opinion this cube is better
than<00:05:49.650> the<00:05:50.100> other<00:05:50.370> way<00:05:50.640> Long's<00:05:51.650> it<00:05:52.650> has<00:05:52.890> a<00:05:52.919> nice

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:53.280 
than the other way Long's it has a nice

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:55.520 
than the other way Long's it has a nice
feeling<00:05:53.640> great<00:05:54.150> corner<00:05:54.539> cutting<00:05:54.780> good<00:05:55.110> speed

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:55.530 
feeling great corner cutting good speed

00:05:55.530 --> 00:06:00.380 
feeling great corner cutting good speed
awesome<00:05:56.010> stickers<00:05:56.520> and<00:05:56.820> it<00:05:56.910> never<00:05:57.120> pops<00:05:59.390> the

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:00.390 
awesome stickers and it never pops the

00:06:00.390 --> 00:06:02.450 
awesome stickers and it never pops the
only<00:06:00.660> thing<00:06:00.930> that's<00:06:01.200> holding<00:06:01.410> me<00:06:01.680> back<00:06:02.070> from

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:02.460 
only thing that's holding me back from

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:04.680 
only thing that's holding me back from
making<00:06:02.700> this<00:06:03.090> my<00:06:03.390> main<00:06:03.599> is
