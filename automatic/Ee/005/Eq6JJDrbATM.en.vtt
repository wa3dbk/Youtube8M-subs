with<00:02:09.479> these<00:02:09.780> the<00:02:10.560> pros<00:02:10.860> being<00:02:11.280> that<00:02:11.640> I

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
with these the pros being that I

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.690 
with these the pros being that I
I've<00:02:12.239> never<00:02:12.450> owned<00:02:12.810> a<00:02:13.019> quality<00:02:13.650> glass<00:02:14.069> and

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
I've never owned a quality glass and

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.830 
I've never owned a quality glass and
this<00:02:15.420> glass<00:02:15.480> is<00:02:16.290> so<00:02:16.709> crystal<00:02:17.670> clear<00:02:17.700> that<00:02:18.329> to

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
this glass is so crystal clear that to

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.050 
this glass is so crystal clear that to
me<00:02:19.019> it<00:02:19.200> feels<00:02:19.379> like<00:02:19.530> you<00:02:19.829> have<00:02:19.859> more<00:02:20.340> optical

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
me it feels like you have more optical

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.479 
me it feels like you have more optical
zoom<00:02:21.239> than<00:02:21.689> you<00:02:21.810> really<00:02:22.079> do<00:02:22.260> it<00:02:22.920> makes<00:02:23.250> it<00:02:23.370> feel

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:23.489 
zoom than you really do it makes it feel

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.399 
zoom than you really do it makes it feel
like<00:02:23.730> you're<00:02:23.909> looking<00:02:24.090> through<00:02:24.450> like<00:02:24.750> a<00:02:24.780> 6<00:02:25.170> X

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:25.409 
like you're looking through like a 6 X

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:28.009 
like you're looking through like a 6 X
instead<00:02:25.859> of<00:02:25.920> a<00:02:26.099> 4<00:02:26.370> X<00:02:26.609> just<00:02:26.939> because<00:02:27.329> of<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:27.659> the

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:28.019 
instead of a 4 X just because of the the

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:30.349 
instead of a 4 X just because of the the
quality<00:02:28.409> of<00:02:28.680> the<00:02:28.769> glass<00:02:29.219> it<00:02:29.549> is<00:02:29.579> amazing

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:30.359 
quality of the glass it is amazing

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:32.780 
quality of the glass it is amazing
another<00:02:31.349> Pro<00:02:31.709> to<00:02:31.769> me<00:02:32.129> would<00:02:32.370> be<00:02:32.489> that<00:02:32.639> it's

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
another Pro to me would be that it's

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.209 
another Pro to me would be that it's
short<00:02:33.299> it's<00:02:33.540> it's<00:02:33.840> not<00:02:34.019> big<00:02:34.469> it's<00:02:34.500> not<00:02:34.889> bulky

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:35.219 
short it's it's not big it's not bulky

00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:37.879 
short it's it's not big it's not bulky
it's<00:02:35.609> short<00:02:36.060> and<00:02:36.269> it<00:02:36.719> and<00:02:36.959> it<00:02:37.139> provides<00:02:37.680> a

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:37.889 
it's short and it and it provides a

00:02:37.889 --> 00:02:42.349 
it's short and it and it provides a
short<00:02:38.239> scope<00:02:39.239> with<00:02:39.540> amazing<00:02:39.989> clarity<00:02:41.359> I'm

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:42.359 
short scope with amazing clarity I'm

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:44.089 
short scope with amazing clarity I'm
really<00:02:42.840> digging<00:02:43.230> it<00:02:43.349> I<00:02:43.530> like<00:02:43.739> that<00:02:43.769> it's

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
really digging it I like that it's

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:47.750 
really digging it I like that it's
Bullock<00:02:44.519> drop<00:02:45.060> compensated<00:02:46.099> this<00:02:47.099> thing<00:02:47.370> I'd

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
Bullock drop compensated this thing I'd

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.509 
Bullock drop compensated this thing I'd
like<00:02:48.750> to<00:02:48.870> get<00:02:48.959> one<00:02:49.109> of<00:02:49.200> my<00:02:49.230> own<00:02:49.319> put<00:02:50.189> it<00:02:50.280> on<00:02:50.400> the

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
like to get one of my own put it on the

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:52.399 
like to get one of my own put it on the
AR<00:02:50.909> and<00:02:51.180> I<00:02:51.239> think<00:02:51.450> it<00:02:51.599> would<00:02:51.689> make<00:02:51.870> a<00:02:52.109> really

00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:52.409 
AR and I think it would make a really

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:55.429 
AR and I think it would make a really
good<00:02:52.560> scope<00:02:52.919> for<00:02:53.280> coyote<00:02:53.760> hunting<00:02:54.060> and<00:02:54.439> that

00:02:55.429 --> 00:02:55.439 
good scope for coyote hunting and that

00:02:55.439 --> 00:02:57.890 
good scope for coyote hunting and that
would<00:02:55.799> be<00:02:55.919> my<00:02:56.099> intended<00:02:56.459> use<00:02:56.790> for<00:02:56.819> this<00:02:57.209> being

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
would be my intended use for this being

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.979 
would be my intended use for this being
a<00:02:57.989> civilian<00:02:59.180> for<00:03:00.180> any<00:03:00.329> of<00:03:00.419> you<00:03:00.540> guys<00:03:00.629> out<00:03:00.959> there

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
a civilian for any of you guys out there

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:03.140 
a civilian for any of you guys out there
looking<00:03:01.260> you<00:03:02.040> probably<00:03:02.400> know<00:03:02.579> what<00:03:02.760> the<00:03:02.909> con

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
looking you probably know what the con

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.750 
looking you probably know what the con
is<00:03:03.480> the<00:03:03.510> con<00:03:04.019> would<00:03:04.319> be<00:03:04.349> the<00:03:04.620> cost<00:03:04.950> these

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
is the con would be the cost these

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.300 
is the con would be the cost these
things<00:03:06.090> are<00:03:06.329> simply<00:03:06.930> expensive<00:03:07.769> very

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
things are simply expensive very

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.690 
things are simply expensive very
expensive<00:03:09.530> and<00:03:10.530> really<00:03:11.189> that's<00:03:11.280> about<00:03:11.519> the

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:11.700 
expensive and really that's about the

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.490 
expensive and really that's about the
only<00:03:11.730> thing<00:03:12.090> I<00:03:12.389> could<00:03:12.540> think<00:03:12.569> of<00:03:12.930> for<00:03:13.169> a<00:03:13.230> con

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
only thing I could think of for a con

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.709 
only thing I could think of for a con
other<00:03:14.159> than<00:03:14.430> the<00:03:14.519> fact<00:03:14.730> if<00:03:14.969> you<00:03:15.090> want<00:03:15.450> more

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:15.719 
other than the fact if you want more

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:18.800 
other than the fact if you want more
optical<00:03:16.139> zoom<00:03:16.430> then<00:03:17.430> you're<00:03:18.359> not<00:03:18.629> really

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
optical zoom then you're not really

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.300 
optical zoom then you're not really
gonna<00:03:19.019> get<00:03:19.229> it<00:03:19.349> through<00:03:19.530> this<00:03:19.709> cuz<00:03:19.979> it's<00:03:20.159> a

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
gonna get it through this cuz it's a

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.050 
gonna get it through this cuz it's a
fixed<00:03:20.909> 4x<00:03:21.470> I<00:03:22.470> gotta<00:03:23.129> say<00:03:23.400> that<00:03:23.639> the<00:03:23.790> fiber

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
fixed 4x I gotta say that the fiber

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:27.349 
fixed 4x I gotta say that the fiber
optic<00:03:24.540> tube<00:03:24.930> on<00:03:25.379> these<00:03:25.590> this<00:03:26.489> model<00:03:27.150> with<00:03:27.239> the

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:27.359 
optic tube on these this model with the

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:29.599 
optic tube on these this model with the
fiber<00:03:27.569> optic<00:03:27.959> tube<00:03:28.199> probably<00:03:29.040> suggested

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:29.609 
fiber optic tube probably suggested

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:31.219 
fiber optic tube probably suggested
because<00:03:29.909> if<00:03:30.060> it's<00:03:30.209> bright<00:03:30.479> outside<00:03:30.720> and

00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:31.229 
because if it's bright outside and

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:32.360 
because if it's bright outside and
you're<00:03:31.349> looking<00:03:31.650> off<00:03:31.769> something<00:03:31.979> with<00:03:32.129> a<00:03:32.220> lot

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
you're looking off something with a lot

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.729 
you're looking off something with a lot
of<00:03:32.400> glare<00:03:32.729> it'll<00:03:33.479> collect<00:03:33.750> more<00:03:34.049> light<00:03:34.109> here

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:34.739 
of glare it'll collect more light here

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:37.909 
of glare it'll collect more light here
and<00:03:34.919> mix<00:03:35.609> the<00:03:35.790> tritium<00:03:36.180> glow<00:03:36.479> brighter<00:03:36.919> very

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:37.919 
and mix the tritium glow brighter very

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:38.659 
and mix the tritium glow brighter very
cool

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:38.669 
cool

22lr<00:04:06.239> ammo<00:04:06.449> through<00:04:07.049> this<00:04:07.169> and<00:04:07.530> that<00:04:08.459> was<00:04:08.849> a

00:04:08.869 --> 00:04:08.879 
22lr ammo through this and that was a

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:11.149 
22lr ammo through this and that was a
blast<00:04:09.209> in<00:04:09.540> itself<00:04:09.900> if<00:04:10.530> I<00:04:10.650> could<00:04:10.799> afford<00:04:10.889> to

00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:11.159 
blast in itself if I could afford to

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:12.890 
blast in itself if I could afford to
have<00:04:11.280> one<00:04:11.340> of<00:04:11.609> these<00:04:11.699> on<00:04:11.909> my<00:04:12.030> two<00:04:12.090> to<00:04:12.359> three<00:04:12.659> and

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
have one of these on my two to three and

have one of these on my two to three and
my<00:04:13.259> 22<00:04:13.829> I'd<00:04:14.250> probably<00:04:14.669> do<00:04:14.970> it<00:04:15.000> but<00:04:15.359> I<00:04:15.629> can't

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
my 22 I'd probably do it but I can't

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.390 
my 22 I'd probably do it but I can't
even<00:04:16.229> have<00:04:16.470> one<00:04:16.500> myself<00:04:16.799> right<00:04:17.159> now

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400

even have one myself right now
maybe<00:04:17.940> once<00:04:18.180> when<00:04:18.389> I<00:04:18.419> maybe<00:04:18.989> once<00:04:19.320> I<00:04:19.440> get<00:04:19.590> done

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
maybe once when I maybe once I get done

maybe once when I maybe once I get done
with<00:04:19.889> school<00:04:20.389> I'll<00:04:21.389> have<00:04:21.539> to<00:04:21.659> think<00:04:21.810> about<00:04:21.959> it

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:22.289 
with school I'll have to think about it

00:04:22.289 --> 00:04:24.720 
with school I'll have to think about it
because<00:04:22.440> these<00:04:23.310> things<00:04:23.490> are<00:04:23.729> very<00:04:23.760> cool
