 Urban talking about the subject 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.690
 the world cup of this era was held in 

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:39.370

 this world cup was the most seen in all the 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.860
 history of world championships 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.110

 thanks to social networks and they went through 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.649
 endless things some good and 

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:04.299
 others because not as good as 

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:04.900
 season the elimination of the champion 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:07.000

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.400
 before holland 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.110
 and if we talk about a team that 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.910
 he was quite surprised we have to talk 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:18.890
 of the Costa Rica national team that left 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.660
 back to great teams like italy and 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.370
 that almost reached the semifinals 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.200
 but holland won them in penalties 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.000
 but the performance of costa rica and 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.000
 so many criticisms fell 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.400

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.390
 won the golden boot I think to others 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.270
 players also gave them boots but 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.310
 rubber 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.230
 Neymar was one of the best players 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:15.790
 of this world but in the end it was 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.680
 injured that was one of the tragedies 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.960
 of Brazilian football that's not to mention 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:23.410
 the holy thrashing they received 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:25.420

00:02:45.719 --> 00:02:51.030
 say two things you 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:55.210

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:58.630
 put a goal for my team but 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:03:03.380
 then I felt like a leg that 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:05.890
 He was nailing his back and then 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:05.890
 Y 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:15.700
 but I have the guilty 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:21.070
 then I fell I felt the grass on my face 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:21.070
 ugly on the side was difficult 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:27.850
 it hurt me a lot 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:31.210
 also good vibes for asking you and 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:35.100
 there is a greeting to the urban 

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:35.100
 and the byron voice of city 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:42.620
 what if 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.480
 the dutch player ruben got a 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.100
 missing and a penalty thanks to a dive 

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.810
 that was cast was that Mexico ended 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:52.110
 eliminated all the Mexican fans 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:54.270
 protested with the hashtag was not criminal 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.920
 the player from Uruguay Luis Suarez 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:57.990
 It also has a great show but 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.270
 with his teeth when biting a player 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:02.250
 Italian receiving sanctions from part 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:05.069
 of the fifa same Don Luis you have to pay 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:07.019
 the consequences of your acts 

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:08.579
 guatemala was also in the world 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:10.769
 but not as teams but 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:12.749
 represented by the silver pin giving it a 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:15.090
 award to messi I would like to be 

00:04:12.749 --> 00:04:17.459
 as a silver pin 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:19.019
 david luiz scored a free kick 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:20.850
 and he gave us a great example in this 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:22.860
 world when his team lost against 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.300
 Germany knelt down and thanked him 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.870
 God in good times and in bad 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:29.669
 we always have to thank God 

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:31.440
 those who watched the games the 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:34.460
 we enjoyed and some took the paper 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.460
 of the technical director 

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.720
 but others still in the stages 

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:41.850
 they did not enjoy it like mick jagger that 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.100
 I was yawning while your son was luking 

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:46.740
 enjoyed the match between germany 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:48.750
 and Argentina and others and they enjoyed it 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:53.009
 they even took a picture these big 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:55.080
 football kaka pelé de camps 

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:56.909
 something that was very criticized in my this 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.379
 world was when a month and it did not make 

00:04:56.909 --> 00:05:00.569
 case to a child who approached him to 

00:04:58.379 --> 00:05:02.430
 greet him the child is originally from here 

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:04.529
 of guatemala won a prize along with his 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.479
 father and traveled to Brazil to see 

00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:08.309
 your football idol that I do not greet 

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:11.020
 those things are not done to children 

00:05:08.309 --> 00:05:13.780
 that's why they become gang members 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:15.639
 this world cup was full of emotions and 

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:18.370
 what to say about the final that in the end what 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:20.740
 won to germany thinking argentina 1 to 0 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:22.659
 taking the gold glove this can ché 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:24.970
 the goalkeeper of germany and the golden ball 

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:26.680
 he earned doing messi player 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:28.150
 most valuable of this world although 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.129
 after this many 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:31.780
 criticism that that prize did not deserve 

00:05:30.129 --> 00:05:33.789
 in here that there is not as well 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:36.080
 that is the other thing in the end they gave it to him 

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:38.960
 what can we do 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:40.400
 good already finished the world-2014 now 

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:42.229

 next but they know how global can 

00:05:42.229 --> 00:05:46.340
 become more exciting then when 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:48.169

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:49.699

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:04.070

 very hungry I had not eaten in three 

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:09.140
 days and then to the one that hunger calls you not 

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:11.480
 it's true that you like the track 

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:13.340
