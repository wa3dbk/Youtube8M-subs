00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.350
 so people get so sad 

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:07.629
 Rilke helps me install my heads 

00:00:08.679 --> 00:00:11.679
 since men have not pointed to argument 

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:13.619
 as i 

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:18.619
 to have the game from the first Potro Tracker and still insist game come 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:22.260
 it is thought to make sure that it is too bad 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.260
 so that everything can be pictorially presented 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:28.839
 so they are also allowed to enter 

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:30.060
 rather 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:31.680
 have to expand now 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.150
 what he was there from the description 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:36.780
 download the game 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.780
 Kalinka turn down shown 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.700
 to receive after the first days «So far, no 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.900
 all that went wrong my body 1 points 1 point two underlined 0 1 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.840
 Board members 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.219
 last year 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.990
 available to the game 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:57.350
 the point you could 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.110
 so you can play the game 

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.200
 this could be the game in the States 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.000
 that are 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.390
 around 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.050
 then this is already in the pact of March game constantly has my account 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.050
 I think much higher does not make sense 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.470
 he has to carry out «first step» how to proceed, whether city council 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.580
 and thrive percent 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:26.960
 APA starter percent between all this confirms okay now you have to 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.440
 you more in the pot 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:30.710
 to find application cards 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.710
 on Vista or Windows 7 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:36.190
 Rockerbanden had to eat Rome in Cologne 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:38.890
 dülmen 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.770
 as he copies it represents helper 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.040
 the file point Michel almost always crooked anti 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.870
 Comet or application data Ortner Rheine 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.250
 so now 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.020
 it drew easy play around braised debris 

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:10.050
 here is beautiful high so yes ca so sensible in detail not yet go 

00:02:11.639 --> 00:02:14.829
 now her game has but i could not do it 

00:02:14.829 --> 00:02:16.469
 IBAN de quotes 

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:19.469
 for the most recent launch on 

00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:23.239
 the more that counts 1 away 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:24.559
 I use 

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:27.559
 March in Internet Explorer is my favorite 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:31.819
 7 others 

00:02:34.609 --> 00:02:36.879
 Search internet browser users 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:38.980
 Cheek how is going a lot 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.579
 Point my help 

00:02:41.579 --> 00:02:44.979
 copied 

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:48.139
 should be on the main page of mine could 

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:50.709
 she is doing it 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:52.749
 my forces Alfa 

00:02:52.749 --> 00:02:55.749
 why will 

00:02:56.999 --> 00:03:00.049
 I think it's a pleasure to see this page here 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:03.859
 You now have to decide for yourself which system claims it exists 

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:05.349
 there Windows 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:07.369
 Cobbler Melzer 

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:10.839
 and for Linux too 

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:14.769
 Vietze my case Windows I think most of them own here too 

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:17.619
 when the US 

00:03:17.619 --> 00:03:20.599
 in the long run only 2 5 points AXA 

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:23.599
 stores it on your desktop 

00:03:24.249 --> 00:03:27.249
 or any other places from but under no circumstances escape 

00:03:27.839 --> 00:03:31.809
 we are the groundsman and the connection data of destiny roaming 

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:32.939
 Ortner 

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:35.989
 under the puck Maigret 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:39.319
 because the game will not work anyway 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:42.189
 there is nothing to give us 

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:44.519
 so wet listed 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:45.979
 my can 

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:49.229
 You can not start during this time had no change 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:52.559
 you have to decide now 

00:03:52.559 --> 00:03:53.919
 to write here 

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:56.639
 write after Michaele Hustedt point 

00:03:56.639 --> 00:03:59.870
 is set to go so it must be Michel more complex 

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:02.439
 to confirm 

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:06.170
 and 9 now steers can the ps3 be executed 

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:11.589
 to be confirmed for his room in front of the factory Türkheimer is yours 

00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:12.269
 all over 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:14.879
 how he does it follows 

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:17.879
 from mistakes 

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:21.870
 more starts at Schaeffler between a compact so 

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:24.849
 because I would know then 

00:04:24.849 --> 00:04:28.180
 free Akon window the Chechens 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:29.830
 exactly the educators 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.419
 here Rossmeisl sells just selling it had Steenblock Hünfeld 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:39.610
 Battles cells but a paddock influx more on lan parties is not that 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.610
 now and Russians want to play 

00:04:43.999 --> 00:04:47.659
 and here you can see the game starts as usual with me 

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:51.659
 Christensen the coach go 

00:04:51.659 --> 00:04:54.939
 accordingly continue to play position as usual 

00:04:56.439 --> 00:04:59.439
 so borders 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:04.240
 and it has to go 

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.260
 how does it almost say a crash from me 

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:13.099
 Thank you for watching and a little side note Kaiser Schröder 

00:05:13.099 --> 00:05:17.949
 why I did not have this loud already with the archive Reiz coffers 

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:20.949
 the reason is simply because Yemen is turning off 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:24.020
 Percent it allows smarter 

00:05:24.020 --> 00:05:27.039
 AUD BZ means he 

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:30.370
 is out of date and the game can not be done anymore 

00:05:30.369 --> 00:05:33.369
 while singing are always new controllers 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:38.169
 again very short index place I will today 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:42.540
 Turn two or three parks and upload sites notified in the morning 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:46.409
 and 

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:49.409
 he has and then the latest information by authorities 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:54.120
 Well, the wars already from my side, I hope I could help you 

00:05:56.139 --> 00:06:00.660
 and 4 then finally fits again heard in mid-April 

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:03.309
 and that will be 10 9 counters 

00:06:03.309 --> 00:06:03.749
