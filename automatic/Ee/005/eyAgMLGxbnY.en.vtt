 and then beauty folks who start with more 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:14.700
 a video and in this video I'll explain the 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:17.640
 why the valve has not only reflects 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:21.180
 three all my crazy theories that 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:25.350

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:29.070
 real may reflect 3 can be released 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:32.579

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:40.290
 he declared himself thus saying the for 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:42.600
 that still have no reflection 3 my channel 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.539
 ended up being directed reflects 13 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.980
 general matters is inadvertently 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.890
 I've always wanted to talk about games. 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.629
 fps but as we are now on the way and 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:56.129
 reflects why I'm not very fan 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:59.070
 then the olhanense game new boss 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.109
 master the master jib in the valve box 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.949
 creator of steam affleck portal rogue 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:07.920
 4 spoke to the newspaper today at a post that 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:10.650
 reflects three has not been released that one 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.200
 reflex sequence was not released by 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.170
 that they are focusing on other things 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.110
 other things as well the beginning of the 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:23.340
 valve was remainder lazio beauty 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:25.830
 only that 's flash was kind of a boost to 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.470
 valve is recognized to be a 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:32.189
 great company of respect as well 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:35.460
 understood following the micro hair fly f1 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.770
 excellent great game for everyone 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.890
 for most people at that time 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.740
 get the game and know that it involves 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.619
 never have focus on the funk world so far 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.810
 created and arrow né so we know 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.229
 she knew today at that time and 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.570
 with this recognition for the work 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:58.110
 they could focus on other 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.460
 things like austin and also the purchase of 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.340
 other games like multiplayer games 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.619
 light type for 10 j 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.450
 tim doors the three games I quoted 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:08.030
 they are not back 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.780
 a valve com 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.940
 or their rights focused on that focused 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:17.120
 in multiplayer is so much that we see today 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:19.130
 dota 2 team fortress as the most games 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.800
 currently played in Steam 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:24.650
 so I'll simplify jibril said with 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.450
 these words when we started were 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.550
 a gaming company focused on the 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.130
 experience for a player who could 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:32.989
 who could have been very successful doing 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:35.600
 simply hijack sequence of 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:37.760
 replanting understood they did not want 

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.680
 continue to reflect why they 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.230
 chose something else 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.510
 in fact the game also said that the 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.209
 idea of ​​steam was his but the 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.860
 employees of the valley at that time 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:51.290
 wanted to focus on live f1 because they did not 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.750
 had faith hope had us that 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.860
 type season 2004 is why we should 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:58.850
 reflect 2 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:01.190
 the episode of 12 in 2003 when it is 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.930
 released is just valve games as well 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:05.560
 they had to have a disclosure and 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:10.010
 so they want s2 and the continuations 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:12.860
 49 box but by 2007 he has already opened the 50 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:15.620
 party companies exploded today in 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:18.530
 day we have to 70 million users 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.360
 besides the valve it has a small seat 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:22.519
 she is a big company 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:25.730
 but she has certain employees 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:29.090
 for which they have no fixed posts or 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:31.100
 they focus on supporting the team coffers 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.799
 from cs in steam 

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:36.799
 or they focus on creating a new 

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:39.140
 sequence to fit in and I would be very 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:41.780
 difficult to get the right team to 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.100
 create this particular game because the 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.220
 officials back in an 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.959
 peculiarity with vacation medical things 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:51.260
 which is also not fixed 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:53.959
 he also did not rule out the hypothesis of 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:56.540
 creation of fs 3 as well as slave 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:04:00.109
 portal 2 everyone was waiting for the gate 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:03.079
 12 f lot 3 can be released yes but not 

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:06.470
 there is nothing at all nothing at all 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:09.560
 determined because now with the watch 

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:12.200
 machine being focused on work I 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:15.109
 I think I 'm a 2016 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:17.690
 I'm serious only in 2016 apodi e 

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:19.700
 arrow stay at the table talk like this, let's go 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:20.870
 do a sequence because how are you? 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.910
 focused on 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:25.040
 the creation of this year's machining to 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:27.740
 people he estimates will be released 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:31.550
 next year must be resolved. 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:33.710
 words of support and only in 2016 will 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:36.320
 something is determined to reflect 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:38.510
 understood and there is not going to be any type either 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:40.250
 a blow to create reflects 3 exclusive 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:42.350
 to get hurt everybody knows 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:45.050
 machine will not have this now said that 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:47.240
 she would not make such an atrocity with 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.729
 words because she wants all the 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:52.220
 players from all platforms 

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:52.790
 took advantage of the game the 59 did with the portal 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.580
 2 

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:58.639
 so that my video on reflects 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:02.660
 three scene is near if it is going to arrive 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:05.150
 It will arrive but it is not close. 

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:06.949
 this answer I have to the ocean 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:10.310
 I have no idea 

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:12.080
 nobody knows the whole crazy way back but I 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:13.070
 I trust her because in the company that has 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.530
 currently 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:17.240
 if you are in doubt about what you said 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:19.970
 here the source said 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:22.449
 we let 5 million source inscription 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:25.160
 This request is strong because you 

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:26.990
 so the staff is this news 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.340
 disappointing for some people 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:30.020
 I do not think because the ball made a 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:32.479
 Work magnificent steam champion 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:35.330
 creating the service and multiplayer as 

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:36.919
 note that the officer notes creating steam 

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:40.280
 with the best platform with the best 

00:05:36.919 --> 00:05:43.849
 support that exists here between reality 

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:47.510
 of the turn that created the sting services 

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:50.360
 multiplayer is creating this machine or 

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:53.240
 the parallel universe where volvo creates a 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:55.910
 a million refugees it is obvious that the profile 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:57.440
 virtual beauty, this was the 

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:59.720
 video with my opinions with the 

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:03.580
 news go to the bridges of the inscription 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:03.580
 Okay, so I guess.
