okay<00:00:02.070> now<00:00:02.909> when<00:00:03.419> we're<00:00:03.629> rounding<00:00:03.990> numbers<00:00:05.180> the

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:06.180 
okay now when we're rounding numbers the

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.490 
okay now when we're rounding numbers the
first<00:00:06.359> thing<00:00:06.629> we<00:00:06.720> need<00:00:06.870> to<00:00:06.899> do<00:00:07.080> is<00:00:07.200> we<00:00:07.350> need<00:00:07.410> to

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:07.500 
first thing we need to do is we need to

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.890 
first thing we need to do is we need to
find<00:00:07.770> out<00:00:08.040> what<00:00:08.790> number<00:00:09.179> we're<00:00:09.360> rounding<00:00:09.599> to

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
find out what number we're rounding to

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.980 
find out what number we're rounding to
now<00:00:10.889> this<00:00:11.130> says<00:00:11.400> rounding<00:00:11.910> to<00:00:12.030> the<00:00:12.150> thousands

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
now this says rounding to the thousands

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.870 
now this says rounding to the thousands
which<00:00:13.650> number<00:00:14.160> is<00:00:14.309> in<00:00:14.490> the<00:00:14.639> thousands<00:00:15.360> place

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:16.880 
which number is in the thousands place

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:17.990 
which number is in the thousands place
hmm

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
hmm

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.580 
hmm
Darrien<00:00:19.189> the<00:00:20.189> one<00:00:20.520> so<00:00:21.359> my<00:00:21.600> first<00:00:22.109> step<00:00:22.380> is

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
Darrien the one so my first step is

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.470 
Darrien the one so my first step is
going<00:00:22.710> to<00:00:22.769> be<00:00:23.630> I'm<00:00:24.630> going<00:00:24.900> to<00:00:24.960> underline<00:00:26.480> step

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
going to be I'm going to underline step

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.460 
going to be I'm going to underline step
one<00:00:28.550> underline<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:30.300> number<00:00:30.660> we<00:00:30.840> are<00:00:30.990> rounding

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
one underline the number we are rounding

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:41.240 
one underline the number we are rounding
to

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:50.910 

we<00:00:42.250> are<00:00:46.200> rounding<00:00:48.030> to<00:00:49.030> okay<00:00:49.650> because<00:00:50.650> we're

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:50.920 
we are rounding to okay because we're

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.710 
we are rounding to okay because we're
rounding<00:00:51.190> to<00:00:51.699> the<00:00:51.730> thousands<00:00:52.360> place<00:00:52.590> then

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:54.720 
rounding to the thousands place then

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:03.840 
rounding to the thousands place then
what<00:00:55.720> I<00:00:55.750> need<00:00:56.110> to<00:00:56.260> do<00:00:56.440> is<00:00:57.059> step<00:00:58.059> two<00:01:00.510> is<00:01:02.579> look<00:01:03.579> at

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
what I need to do is step two is look at

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.170 
what I need to do is step two is look at
the<00:01:04.119> digit<00:01:05.130> directly<00:01:06.130> to<00:01:06.369> the<00:01:06.490> right<00:01:06.729> of<00:01:06.970> the

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:07.180 
the digit directly to the right of the

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.680 
the digit directly to the right of the
underlined<00:01:07.720> number<00:01:08.229> okay<00:01:09.130> so<00:01:10.030> we<00:01:10.270> need<00:01:10.479> to

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:10.690 
underlined number okay so we need to

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:31.580 
underlined number okay so we need to
step<00:01:11.080> to<00:01:16.020> look<00:01:18.750> at<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:23.020> digit<00:01:27.390> to<00:01:28.390> the<00:01:30.090> right

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
step to look at the digit to the right

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:44.830 
step to look at the digit to the right
of<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:38.340> underlined

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:53.569 

digit<00:01:48.740> okay<00:01:51.590> what<00:01:52.590> is<00:01:52.770> that<00:01:52.799> number<00:01:53.369> to<00:01:53.549> the

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
digit okay what is that number to the

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:59.569

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:37.950 

if<00:02:22.330> the<00:02:23.140> number<00:02:25.740> if<00:02:26.740> that<00:02:27.450> number<00:02:28.450> is<00:02:36.330> zero<00:02:37.330> to

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:37.960 
if the number if that number is zero to

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:43.770 
if the number if that number is zero to
four<00:02:38.760> okay<00:02:41.670> the<00:02:42.670> underlined<00:02:43.210> number<00:02:43.510> stays

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
four okay the underlined number stays

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:54.599 
four okay the underlined number stays
the<00:02:43.810> same

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:54.609 

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:58.390

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
guess what all these other numbers

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:06.640 
guess what all these other numbers
become<00:03:03.980> they<00:03:04.250> become<00:03:04.670> what<00:03:05.230> they<00:03:06.230> become

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
become they become what they become

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:18.960 
become they become what they become
zeros<00:03:07.129> yeah<00:03:07.519> all<00:03:09.610> others<00:03:13.690> become<00:03:16.060> oops

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:18.970 
zeros yeah all others become oops

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:27.880 
zeros yeah all others become oops
all<00:03:19.970> others<00:03:20.569> are<00:03:21.970> zeros<00:03:25.870> what<00:03:26.870> happens<00:03:27.500> if

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:27.890 
all others are zeros what happens if

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:37.330 
all others are zeros what happens if
this<00:03:28.760> number<00:03:29.120> is<00:03:33.760> five<00:03:34.760> or<00:03:35.660> more<00:03:35.900> so<00:03:36.769> if<00:03:36.980> that

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:37.340 
this number is five or more so if that

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:45.610 
this number is five or more so if that
number<00:03:39.250> is<00:03:42.129> five<00:03:43.129> to<00:03:43.640> nine<00:03:44.049> what<00:03:45.049> happens<00:03:45.500> to

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
number is five to nine what happens to

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:55.449 
number is five to nine what happens to
the<00:03:45.739> underlined<00:03:46.190> number<00:03:48.790> hmm

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:59.069 

yeah<00:03:56.209> the<00:03:56.569> underlined<00:03:57.109> number<00:03:57.650> goes<00:03:57.980> up<00:03:58.280> one

00:03:59.069 --> 00:03:59.079 
yeah the underlined number goes up one

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:20.140 
yeah the underlined number goes up one
the<00:04:06.099> underlined<00:04:07.719> digit<00:04:11.139> goes<00:04:14.230> up<00:04:16.389> one<00:04:17.410> and<00:04:19.150> all

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
the underlined digit goes up one and all

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:30.659 
the underlined digit goes up one and all
others<00:04:20.479> are<00:04:20.630> zeros<00:04:25.840> others<00:04:26.840> are<00:04:29.199> zero

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:30.669 
others are zeros others are zero

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:37.510 
others are zeros others are zero
okay<00:04:31.669> so<00:04:32.509> I<00:04:32.870> have<00:04:35.020> 1674<00:04:36.050> and<00:04:36.259> I<00:04:36.770> am<00:04:36.919> going<00:04:37.310> to

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:37.520 
okay so I have 1674 and I am going to

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.710 
okay so I have 1674 and I am going to
round<00:04:37.849> to<00:04:38.479> the<00:04:38.960> nearest<00:04:39.099> thousandths<00:04:40.099> place<00:04:40.160> I

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:40.720 
round to the nearest thousandths place I

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.180 
round to the nearest thousandths place I
underlined<00:04:41.720> my<00:04:42.110> number<00:04:42.650> in<00:04:42.710> the<00:04:42.770> thousands

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:43.190 
underlined my number in the thousands

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:45.430 
underlined my number in the thousands
place<00:04:43.449> then<00:04:44.449> I<00:04:44.479> looked<00:04:44.870> at<00:04:45.020> the<00:04:45.050> number

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 
place then I looked at the number

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:49.689 
place then I looked at the number
directly<00:04:45.830> to<00:04:46.009> the<00:04:46.130> right<00:04:46.280> of<00:04:46.340> it<00:04:47.199> it's<00:04:48.280> a<00:04:49.280> six

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:49.699 
directly to the right of it it's a six

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:51.610 
directly to the right of it it's a six
is<00:04:49.970> that<00:04:50.780> mean<00:04:50.960> I'm<00:04:51.139> going<00:04:51.320> to<00:04:51.380> move<00:04:51.560> my

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
is that mean I'm going to move my

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.339 
is that mean I'm going to move my
thousand<00:04:52.370> up<00:04:52.550> one<00:04:52.910> or<00:04:53.180> is<00:04:53.870> it<00:04:53.990> going<00:04:54.110> to<00:04:54.169> stay

00:04:54.339 --> 00:04:54.349 
thousand up one or is it going to stay

00:04:54.349 --> 00:04:57.700 
thousand up one or is it going to stay
the<00:04:54.530> same<00:04:55.960> I'm<00:04:56.960> going<00:04:57.139> to<00:04:57.199> move<00:04:57.320> it<00:04:57.440> up<00:04:57.500> well

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.710 
the same I'm going to move it up well

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.040 
the same I'm going to move it up well
what's<00:04:57.889> my<00:04:58.070> new<00:04:58.250> number<00:04:58.550> going<00:04:58.699> to<00:04:58.759> be<00:04:59.050> two

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
what's my new number going to be two

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:01.779 
what's my new number going to be two
thousand<00:05:00.500> because<00:05:00.590> this<00:05:01.010> underlined<00:05:01.639> digit

00:05:01.779 --> 00:05:01.789 
thousand because this underlined digit

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:07.920 
thousand because this underlined digit
goes<00:05:02.630> up<00:05:02.900> one<00:05:03.289> and<00:05:04.389> all<00:05:05.389> these<00:05:05.659> others<00:05:06.490> become
