00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.050 
specification wise
to<00:02:16.440> be<00:02:16.530> pretty<00:02:16.860> reasonable<00:02:17.100> especially

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:18.060 
to be pretty reasonable especially

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:19.340 
to be pretty reasonable especially
compared<00:02:18.480> to<00:02:18.570> some<00:02:18.780> of<00:02:18.870> the<00:02:18.900> specs<00:02:19.200> I've

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
compared to some of the specs I've

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.890 
compared to some of the specs I've
revealed<00:02:19.590> for<00:02:19.830> you<00:02:19.920> guys<00:02:20.130> home<00:02:20.520> remember<00:02:21.030> not

revealed for you guys home remember not

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.660 
revealed for you guys home remember not
too<00:02:22.080> long<00:02:22.230> ago<00:02:22.290> doing<00:02:22.770> the<00:02:22.920> specifications

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:23.670 
too long ago doing the specifications

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.040 
too long ago doing the specifications
for<00:02:24.060> Metro<00:02:24.750> last<00:02:25.020> light<00:02:25.290> and<00:02:25.920> how<00:02:26.280> the

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
for Metro last light and how the

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:29.150 
for Metro last light and how the
recommended<00:02:28.050> specs<00:02:28.350> for<00:02:28.590> that<00:02:28.710> was<00:02:28.830> actually

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
recommended specs for that was actually

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.340 
recommended specs for that was actually
an<00:02:29.250> NVIDIA<00:02:29.700> Titan<00:02:30.330> which<00:02:30.510> just<00:02:30.750> made<00:02:30.960> my<00:02:31.080> jaw

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
an NVIDIA Titan which just made my jaw

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:34.040 
an NVIDIA Titan which just made my jaw
hit<00:02:31.530> the<00:02:31.590> floor<00:02:31.680> a<00:02:31.950> little<00:02:32.160> bit<00:02:32.310> but<00:02:33.090> despite

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
hit the floor a little bit but despite

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.470 
hit the floor a little bit but despite
the<00:02:34.440> impressive<00:02:35.400> graphics<00:02:35.820> that<00:02:36.180> we<00:02:36.300> have

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
the impressive graphics that we have

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.450 
the impressive graphics that we have
seen<00:02:36.660> previewed<00:02:37.140> in<00:02:37.320> various<00:02:37.710> trailers<00:02:37.980> demos

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
seen previewed in various trailers demos

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.970 
seen previewed in various trailers demos
and<00:02:38.670> so<00:02:38.820> forth<00:02:39.120> for<00:02:39.720> total<00:02:39.990> war<00:02:40.020> Rome<00:02:40.200> -<00:02:40.680> it

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
and so forth for total war Rome - it

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.700 
and so forth for total war Rome - it
seems<00:02:41.400> like<00:02:41.580> you<00:02:42.060> should<00:02:42.300> be<00:02:42.780> able<00:02:42.870> to<00:02:43.080> run

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
seems like you should be able to run

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:46.610 
seems like you should be able to run
this<00:02:43.950> game<00:02:44.250> on<00:02:44.810> pretty<00:02:45.810> much<00:02:46.020> anything<00:02:46.320> it's<00:02:46.590> a

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
this game on pretty much anything it's a

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.440 
this game on pretty much anything it's a
little<00:02:46.800> bit<00:02:46.920> strange<00:02:47.280> how<00:02:47.640> it<00:02:47.670> does<00:02:47.940> support<00:02:48.120> a

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
little bit strange how it does support a

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:50.600 
little bit strange how it does support a
single<00:02:48.960> core<00:02:49.200> processor<00:02:49.830> it's<00:02:50.160> not<00:02:50.250> something

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
single core processor it's not something

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.340 
single core processor it's not something
I've<00:02:50.730> seen<00:02:50.970> and<00:02:51.210> quite<00:02:51.390> some<00:02:51.600> time<00:02:51.810> usually

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
I've seen and quite some time usually

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.670 
I've seen and quite some time usually
its<00:02:52.890> dual<00:02:53.220> core<00:02:53.520> minimum<00:02:54.270> for<00:02:55.170> these<00:02:55.290> kind<00:02:55.590> of

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
its dual core minimum for these kind of

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.740 
its dual core minimum for these kind of
games<00:02:55.920> but<00:02:56.460> obviously<00:02:56.880> they<00:02:57.210> put<00:02:57.450> in<00:02:57.630> some

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
games but obviously they put in some

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.260 
games but obviously they put in some
optimization<00:02:58.410> so<00:02:58.560> people<00:02:58.860> have<00:02:58.980> a<00:02:59.270> machine

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
optimization so people have a machine

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.660 
optimization so people have a machine
that's<00:03:00.330> kind<00:03:00.810> of<00:03:00.840> old<00:03:01.050> or<00:03:01.440> just<00:03:02.010> maybe<00:03:02.310> not<00:03:02.550> as

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
that's kind of old or just maybe not as

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.610 
that's kind of old or just maybe not as
powerful<00:03:02.880> can<00:03:03.510> actually<00:03:03.870> run<00:03:04.050> this<00:03:04.200> game<00:03:04.410> on

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
powerful can actually run this game on

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.670 
powerful can actually run this game on
the<00:03:04.740> lower<00:03:04.920> settings<00:03:05.840> so<00:03:06.840> yeah<00:03:07.170> not<00:03:07.440> too<00:03:07.650> bad

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
the lower settings so yeah not too bad

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.820 
the lower settings so yeah not too bad
at<00:03:08.100> all<00:03:08.190> it's<00:03:08.520> a<00:03:08.990> huge<00:03:09.990> amount<00:03:10.260> of<00:03:10.350> hard<00:03:10.560> drive

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
at all it's a huge amount of hard drive

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.490 
at all it's a huge amount of hard drive
space<00:03:10.980> I<00:03:11.310> mean<00:03:11.460> honestly<00:03:11.880> 35<00:03:12.750> gigs<00:03:13.230> is

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
space I mean honestly 35 gigs is

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.830 
space I mean honestly 35 gigs is
actually<00:03:14.070> massive<00:03:14.670> and<00:03:14.880> I'm<00:03:15.480> sure<00:03:15.630> that's

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:15.840 
actually massive and I'm sure that's

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.720 
actually massive and I'm sure that's
gonna<00:03:15.930> discover<00:03:16.620> some<00:03:16.950> people's<00:03:17.250> hopes<00:03:17.520> of

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
gonna discover some people's hopes of

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.290 
gonna discover some people's hopes of
actually<00:03:18.090> putting<00:03:18.300> this<00:03:18.540> game<00:03:18.780> on<00:03:19.020> an<00:03:19.200> SSD<00:03:19.530> and

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.300 
actually putting this game on an SSD and

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.240 
actually putting this game on an SSD and
while<00:03:21.300> getting<00:03:22.230> those<00:03:22.410> loading<00:03:22.830> time<00:03:23.070> was

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
while getting those loading time was

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.130 
while getting those loading time was
reduced<00:03:23.580> but<00:03:23.760> I<00:03:23.820> doubt<00:03:23.970> many<00:03:24.750> of<00:03:24.930> you<00:03:25.020> are

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
reduced but I doubt many of you are

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.630 
reduced but I doubt many of you are
going<00:03:25.290> to<00:03:25.380> have<00:03:25.500> an<00:03:25.650> SSD<00:03:25.950> with<00:03:26.250> that<00:03:26.370> kind<00:03:26.580> of

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:26.640 
going to have an SSD with that kind of

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:28.670 
going to have an SSD with that kind of
memory<00:03:26.850> because<00:03:27.060> it's<00:03:27.300> very<00:03:27.510> expensive<00:03:28.380> I'm

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
memory because it's very expensive I'm

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.710 
memory because it's very expensive I'm
sure<00:03:29.040> some<00:03:29.310> people<00:03:29.670> out<00:03:29.820> there<00:03:30.030> do<00:03:30.240> but<00:03:30.540> I

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
sure some people out there do but I

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:32.420 
sure some people out there do but I
think<00:03:30.930> a<00:03:30.990> lot<00:03:31.170> of<00:03:31.200> people<00:03:31.530> have<00:03:31.620> had<00:03:31.770> their<00:03:31.920> SSD

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:32.430 
think a lot of people have had their SSD

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:35.720 
think a lot of people have had their SSD
hopes<00:03:32.670> will<00:03:33.480> basically<00:03:34.100> squash<00:03:35.100> the<00:03:35.280> pieces

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:35.730 
hopes will basically squash the pieces
