00:00:01.239 --> 00:00:05.559
 is standing with Peter Maffay tonight on the big bet that 

00:00:05.559 --> 00:00:08.790
 Many know them all most of them know them all 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.549
 Dreiergespann so to speak together 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:15.240
 but here now to soloing Mandy Capristo Page hereby free me 

00:00:15.239 --> 00:00:18.050
 hi i also ask myself a little luck 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:23.310
 dapd Tabaluga that's your own a story a fairy tale that's been around 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.429
 already 30 years clock gives up to 23 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:33.350
 21 explains 21 percent So there is longer term but there 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:34.860
 Did you grow up with it? 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.390
 yes, which is quite funny and not more than ten years ago, the Kiddy Contest 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.020
 At that time Erich Engel won 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.020
 and then had appearances among others at Tabaluga tivi 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.870
 and of course I did not know then that I would be one now 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:48.460
 will work together 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.930
 and he and spouses that will occur with it and percent 

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.720
 exactly and around 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.180
 So my first attempts with Tabaluga and then sat quite small 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.980
 Ehlert lifts Heidi Stolzenwald to meet Tabaluga and it was mine 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.450
 first big meeting with Tabaluga 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.600
 Interviewed by Peter Hacks SGCI has this collaboration 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.780
 over again new friends who have said "He is someone 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:19.000
 the fight what was that feeling as Peter Maffay suddenly the damage 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.840
 he said he would like to work with her 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.310
 importantly, humanity itself is currently in the studio for my album and 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.000
 then get a call and you do not feel like percent 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.040
 the perpetrators do not work together 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.150
 I think again 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:35.720
 that was right for the time being for the time being, it's going to be tremendous and then it has 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.880
 in terms of gifts he got sent and was 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.060
 important from the beginning percent 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.740
 Improving Quality explains Peter Teuber Howard Hay 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.549
 and 5 what do I do then rather by the great love 

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:50.439
 From parents in vogue but only vacated it went all the way Melchert Winston 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:54.130
 he told me Berg is too nervous 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:55.650
 sometimes scenes 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.930
 and Sam and then everything went very fast to reach the deciduous trees 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.810
 Get a warning and you are SG Wallau 1 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.460
 started everything and until when he Haiti 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.060
 there you can already role in the far away lady or wait for Bozzetto 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:12.560
 so you had to go one far, I did not know them all right of course 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.259
 I knew it was the league but I never had it 

00:02:15.259 --> 00:02:18.519
 in which also older than I have it then not so with exception 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:21.879
 set but it went very quickly so I was then 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:23.299
 into the story 

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:26.689
 Of course, history is cleverly telling information because I found it 

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:29.019
 very deep from the beginning Dasinger Journey 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:32.799
 a big problem is the only investor centrally doing the same things to me 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:36.390
 and Leyer that's why it's it's so much fun it's not that 

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:39.189
 I feel it is not insane 

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:42.729
 Tabaluga and the signs of the times "it says so it is about the time now 

00:02:42.729 --> 00:02:47.009
 up to 21 means that you have a lot of time left before you 

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:49.029
 yes me seriously it's funny because 

00:02:49.029 --> 00:02:52.029
 I missed all my youth in the band so to speak and so on 

00:02:52.679 --> 00:02:56.789
 around 50 15 has gone to the casting has become in power 16 exactly 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:01.399
 has spent five years in all the knowledge and if people then me 

00:03:01.399 --> 00:03:04.349
 Questions how old have you been since age 21? 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:07.849
 that's for the Lighting Ette singers, the heroes are what it already is 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:09.870
 five years in the band, how does it work? 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.540
 but for me it is just fine which just because there are too many I know now 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.690
 even that I measure exactly what's wrong 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.690
 further finds the scenes what's going on 

00:03:20.369 --> 00:03:23.959
 but I'm still young he can not mess it up well so I already have 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:27.399
 small advantage if very grateful that I started so early 

00:03:27.399 --> 00:03:30.689
 So you have to be part of the tour next year 

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:34.839
 Autumn is exciting to be with people like Rufus Beck or you 

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:36.529
 Hanning sees everything he really does 

00:03:36.529 --> 00:03:41.019
 the cream de la creme as king equals has a press report his encounter 

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:43.900
 from the 1 they put on election day like the big performance 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.950
 It is a very cool energy and his mood on the set 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.050
 It has all met and everyone is totally relaxed and everyone is totally 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:54.690
 relaxed and though it's stressful all the world is simply happy 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.629
 It's a nice project and that's why it's all about working with everyone 

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:01.199
 single from now dancer is or just the well-known 

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:05.139
 it's just something completely Traders and it makes me it's never a nice solo 

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:07.249
 instead and just gives me a lot of power 

00:04:07.249 --> 00:04:11.249
 for all that is coming now how has your life changed its time 

00:04:11.249 --> 00:04:14.229
 Diverge from Manos mm 

00:04:14.229 --> 00:04:16.469
 it will work more quietly for me 

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:20.069
 very good with me for the first time had the moment to realize what 

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:21.509
 actually happened 

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:24.379
 in the last five years and of course if you are in quiet moment 

00:04:24.379 --> 00:04:27.830
 What's going to happen to you first, you've got something like that 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.740
 Sullenberger Halle was that you think you have to do every day and teamwork 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.740
 and I came down there 

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:36.840
 I try to take care of my life for a lot of things 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:37.949
 a lot of time in Mainz 

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:40.729
 have a contract 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:44.749
 made quite normal things and at SOSO long wait actually not 

00:04:44.749 --> 00:04:48.020
 already signed my first contracts and here I am older 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.629
 quickly it was then a working day in the nice that so half 

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:54.110
 Year in between, that was one time down 

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:55.809
 Kontron could just think so 

00:04:55.809 --> 00:05:00.369
 why Eni why where do you stand in your life what do you want both is whole 

00:05:00.369 --> 00:05:01.740
 important that you just know 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.839
 these are my goals and goals 

00:05:03.839 --> 00:05:05.520
 Yes and 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.710
 Also calls a good time as definitely needed now to accommodate 

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:10.259
 and may do nothing 

00:05:10.259 --> 00:05:13.729
 So the gasoline time so take the time for yourself 

00:05:13.729 --> 00:05:17.660
 but do you still have contact with his career equally good friends too 

00:05:17.659 --> 00:05:21.009
 the Hornets I am in contact with as it was before quite a few hits 1 

00:05:21.009 --> 00:05:21.889
 To take receipt 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:25.749
 we'll call each other off and on with him last week and I phoned it 

00:05:25.749 --> 00:05:27.069
 is also very important to me 

00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:29.729
 So I'm interested but synonymous if I do not notice that the 

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:32.729
 We always like to do girls in a row directly 

00:05:33.559 --> 00:05:37.309
 but it's just free for the championship stain not quite Damsgaard 

00:05:37.309 --> 00:05:40.860
 Too bad that everyone can be easy with their own path 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:45.529
 Now we have to be a compromise too and around 

00:05:45.529 --> 00:05:48.919
 but we are still friends in Bonn more money and I mean 

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:51.919
 Whole youth has spent with these people and that's why 

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:55.189
 Do not let valets out of your mind and, above all, on your heart 

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:59.560
 yes, but there is only for truly intergenerational for the 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:02.630
 small ones for adults and, above all, over 

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:04.970
 long time with grown 

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:08.410
 is this really a chance maybe somehow more of a new target group 

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:09.360
 to reach 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.499
 definitely with you around 

00:06:11.499 --> 00:06:14.499
 I have not accepted the project thought there spanked 

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:19.360
 "Maybe Farfans will be happy with a completely different ride 

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:23.850
 because I was from the beginning, so Watson did not think of Sofian Apitz from Peter 

00:06:23.849 --> 00:06:25.790
 the one of this whole one project 

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:29.630
 Hertha he can do so many things on 1 2 which I in my position as 

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:31.520
 Victory bonus did not fly 

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:35.190
 and also as a recent that my solo career also be something completely different 

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:35.930
 becomes 

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:38.860
 and by itself it is 

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:42.150
 it's just a lot of sure that just stop the words 

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:44.449
 maybe the hits are just so nice 

00:06:44.449 --> 00:06:48.300
 that sounds fantastic I definitely want to have a lot of success for the first time 

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:52.240
 Performance this evening and of course a lot of fun with another cross 

00:06:52.240 --> 00:06:57.379
 KLB buy solo experience everything sent live the tires eighth time
