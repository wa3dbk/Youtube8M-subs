language was active when he prayed in

quiet when he prayed in tongues when

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:57.570 
quiet when he prayed in tongues when
they're<00:04:56.060> actually<00:04:56.389> engaged<00:04:56.810> in<00:04:56.990> this<00:04:57.169> whole

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.339 
they're actually engaged in this whole

00:05:00.339 --> 00:05:00.349 
very intense spiritual practice

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:02.170 
very intense spiritual practice
religious<00:05:00.740> practice<00:05:01.190> for<00:05:01.370> them<00:05:01.490> their

religious practice for them their
frontal<00:05:02.510> lobes<00:05:02.570> tend<00:05:02.990> to<00:05:03.110> go<00:05:03.199> down<00:05:03.229> in

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.650 
frontal lobes tend to go down in

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:05.050 
frontal lobes tend to go down in
activity<00:05:04.190> but<00:05:04.669> I<00:05:04.699> think<00:05:04.910> it's<00:05:05.000> very

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:05.060 
activity but I think it's very

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:06.909 
activity but I think it's very
consistent<00:05:05.690> with<00:05:05.780> the<00:05:05.840> kind<00:05:06.169> of<00:05:06.289> experience

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:06.919 
consistent with the kind of experience

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:08.620 
consistent with the kind of experience
that<00:05:07.010> they<00:05:07.250> have<00:05:07.460> because<00:05:07.910> they<00:05:08.090> say<00:05:08.330> that

they're not in charge there it's the
