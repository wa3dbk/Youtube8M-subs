00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
and make it lighter and I only did the

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.190 
and make it lighter and I only did the
top<00:01:20.939> half<00:01:21.150> of<00:01:21.240> my<00:01:21.299> head<00:01:21.509> because<00:01:21.720> I<00:01:21.869> have<00:01:22.020> like

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
top half of my head because I have like

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.630 
top half of my head because I have like
so<00:01:22.409> much<00:01:22.530> hair<00:01:22.770> my<00:01:22.920> hair<00:01:23.100> is<00:01:23.189> like<00:01:23.340> really

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
so much hair my hair is like really

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.570 
so much hair my hair is like really
thick<00:01:23.939> and<00:01:24.439> I<00:01:25.439> figured<00:01:26.220> it<00:01:26.280> would<00:01:26.369> just<00:01:26.490> be

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
thick and I figured it would just be

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.090 
thick and I figured it would just be
easier<00:01:26.610> just<00:01:27.210> to<00:01:27.600> do<00:01:27.780> half<00:01:28.110> my<00:01:28.380> hair<00:01:28.560> and<00:01:28.920> leave

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
easier just to do half my hair and leave

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.609 
easier just to do half my hair and leave
like<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.490> underneath<00:01:30.119> part<00:01:30.329> darker<00:01:30.930> and<00:01:31.229> not

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
like the underneath part darker and not

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.289 
like the underneath part darker and not
only<00:01:31.829> going<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:32.040> look<00:01:32.159> too<00:01:32.310> bad<00:01:34.670> so<00:01:35.670> yeah<00:01:35.880> now<00:01:36.270> I

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
only going to look too bad so yeah now I

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.960 
only going to look too bad so yeah now I
just<00:01:36.420> have<00:01:36.720> to<00:01:36.810> wait<00:01:37.020> like<00:01:37.820> probably<00:01:38.820> gonna
