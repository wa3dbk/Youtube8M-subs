00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
dies with a match stamps with a matching

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.490 
dies with a match stamps with a matching
die<00:02:14.270> you<00:02:14.330> can<00:02:14.810> just<00:02:14.959> go<00:02:15.050> ahead<00:02:15.140> and<00:02:15.350> use<00:02:15.470> that

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
die you can just go ahead and use that

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.050

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 
this one I cut out earlier I'm just

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.170 
this one I cut out earlier I'm just
gonna<00:02:18.380> use<00:02:18.560> that<00:02:18.800> and<00:02:19.160> I'm<00:02:19.790> going<00:02:19.940> to<00:02:20.000> layer

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
gonna use that and I'm going to layer

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.510 
gonna use that and I'm going to layer
that<00:02:20.390> on<00:02:20.450> top<00:02:20.720> of<00:02:20.780> my<00:02:20.900> scalloped<00:02:21.380> circle<00:02:21.410> in<00:02:22.190> a

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
that on top of my scalloped circle in a

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.699 
that on top of my scalloped circle in a
poke<00:02:22.730> a<00:02:22.940> little<00:02:22.970> hole<00:02:23.270> with<00:02:23.750> my<00:02:23.900> scissors<00:02:24.200> or

poke a little hole with my scissors or

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:26.860 
poke a little hole with my scissors or
you<00:02:24.830> can<00:02:24.980> use<00:02:25.190> a<00:02:25.430> needle<00:02:25.760> tool<00:02:25.910> I<00:02:26.150> find<00:02:26.569> it's<00:02:26.720> so

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
you can use a needle tool I find it's so

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.510 
you can use a needle tool I find it's so
much<00:02:27.020> easier<00:02:27.050> to<00:02:27.380> do<00:02:27.620> that<00:02:27.650> than<00:02:27.830> to<00:02:28.190> try<00:02:28.490> to

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
much easier to do that than to try to

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.740 
much easier to do that than to try to
force<00:02:28.970> a<00:02:29.150> brad<00:02:29.450> through<00:02:30.260> the<00:02:30.410> paper<00:02:31.750> alright

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
force a brad through the paper alright

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.030 
force a brad through the paper alright

anything in bulk you really ought to

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.030 
anything in bulk you really ought to

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
pare down the steps and this is easy

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.070 
pare down the steps and this is easy
enough<00:02:46.250> that<00:02:46.400> your<00:02:46.580> kids<00:02:46.850> can<00:02:46.970> totally<00:02:47.959> help

I'm going to fumble with this a bit

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.350 
I'm going to fumble with this a bit
probably<00:02:51.190> let's<00:02:52.190> go<00:02:52.340> through<00:02:52.580> each<00:02:52.790> layer<00:02:53.209> at

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:53.360 
probably let's go through each layer at

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.820 
probably let's go through each layer at
a<00:02:53.420> time

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
a time

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.110

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.360 
bit flimsier and they you know they're a
little<00:03:00.230> bit<00:03:00.440> weaker<00:03:00.680> so<00:03:00.800> you<00:03:00.890> have<00:03:00.980> to<00:03:01.069> be<00:03:01.190> I

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
little bit weaker so you have to be I

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:02.920 
little bit weaker so you have to be I
maybe<00:03:01.580> just<00:03:01.700> poke<00:03:02.090> a<00:03:02.120> hole<00:03:02.239> in<00:03:02.390> there<00:03:02.630> just<00:03:02.780> to

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
maybe just poke a hole in there just to

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.340 
maybe just poke a hole in there just to
be<00:03:03.489> on<00:03:04.489> the<00:03:04.640> safe<00:03:04.819> side<00:03:04.850> and<00:03:05.810> so<00:03:06.019> this<00:03:06.230> is<00:03:06.290> just

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
be on the safe side and so this is just

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.100 
be on the safe side and so this is just
a<00:03:06.470> foam<00:03:06.620> at<00:03:06.920> there<00:03:07.190> that<00:03:07.430> I'm<00:03:07.519> using<00:03:07.700> to<00:03:08.110> keep

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 
a foam at there that I'm using to keep

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:10.509 
a foam at there that I'm using to keep
everything<00:03:09.680> to<00:03:09.920> make<00:03:10.040> it<00:03:10.160> poke<00:03:10.310> through

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
everything to make it poke through

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:12.160 
everything to make it poke through
easily<00:03:10.670> and<00:03:11.060> this<00:03:11.569> way<00:03:11.750> you<00:03:11.840> could<00:03:11.930> actually

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
easily and this way you could actually

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.470 
easily and this way you could actually
you<00:03:13.069> know<00:03:13.100> twirl<00:03:13.550> the<00:03:13.850> little<00:03:14.120> pinwheel

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
you know twirl the little pinwheel

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.420 
you know twirl the little pinwheel
around<00:03:14.840> is<00:03:15.200> long<00:03:15.410> you<00:03:15.620> know<00:03:15.709> if<00:03:15.769> you<00:03:15.860> don't<00:03:16.010> put

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 
you were doing the gumballs you can

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.120 
you were doing the gumballs you can
always<00:04:05.720> have<00:04:05.900> them<00:04:05.989> open<00:04:06.260> at<00:04:06.380> the<00:04:06.470> bottom<00:04:06.620> and

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.130 
always have them open at the bottom and

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:09.250 
always have them open at the bottom and

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
then and then they don't even have to

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.110 
then and then they don't even have to
take<00:04:09.410> it<00:04:09.500> apart<00:04:09.799> to<00:04:10.070> get<00:04:10.280> the<00:04:10.400> goodies<00:04:10.670> out<00:04:10.820> and

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
take it apart to get the goodies out and

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.000

then<00:04:11.959> what<00:04:12.109> I<00:04:12.140> like<00:04:12.290> to<00:04:12.380> do<00:04:12.470> is<00:04:12.560> actually<00:04:12.680> bend

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
then what I like to do is actually bend

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:14.620 
then what I like to do is actually bend
both<00:04:13.160> the<00:04:13.340> front<00:04:13.609> and<00:04:13.850> the<00:04:13.970> back<00:04:14.000> so<00:04:14.180> I<00:04:14.390> can

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:14.630 
both the front and the back so I can

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:17.080 
both the front and the back so I can
line<00:04:14.810> up<00:04:14.840> my<00:04:15.079> edges<00:04:15.530> and<00:04:15.890> just<00:04:15.950> squeeze<00:04:16.910> them

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090 
line up my edges and just squeeze them

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.270 
line up my edges and just squeeze them
together<00:04:17.750> on<00:04:18.200> the<00:04:18.260> side<00:04:18.590> and<00:04:18.769> it<00:04:18.890> gives<00:04:19.070> it<00:04:19.190> a

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:19.280 
together on the side and it gives it a

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:23.200 
together on the side and it gives it a
little<00:04:19.430> bit<00:04:19.640> of<00:04:19.729> dimension<00:04:19.880> and<00:04:21.909> you<00:04:22.909> can<00:04:22.940> even

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:23.210 
little bit of dimension and you can even

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:25.120 
little bit of dimension and you can even
twirl<00:04:23.630> your<00:04:23.840> little<00:04:24.110> embellishment<00:04:24.680> around<00:04:24.830> a
