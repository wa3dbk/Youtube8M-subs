00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:27.769
 Hello everyone, today you see it as 

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:30.710
 make other letters of the alphabet 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:34.280
 using the wire technique I will show you 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:36.950
 therefore where to realize letter mmae d 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.510
 to do this I chose to use the 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.090
 2 mm thick aluminum sheet 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.000
 of the silver population but sometimes 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:45.350
 use any other type of wire 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.150
 therefore more often and also in others 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.920
 colors with time I tried to 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.420
 make all the others of the design 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.350
 or in any case to make the most 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.970
 common 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.190
 let me know which letters you would like 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.440
 see first and bucks you will find 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.720
 as always, all in and close them 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.730
 the need to analyze this work is 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.620
 as always, doubtful problems are needed 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.080
 ideas tips and advice 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.700
 leave a comment below this video 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.290
 let me see how you read you work 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.300
 of the kind with a myth of answer to 

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.060
 this video or with a photo on 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.890
 facebook or by email 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.900
 so I hope you enjoy this video 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.350
 there may be one of slow inspiration 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:23.270
 so good vision 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.100
 like the other videos I preferred for 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.360
 practicality to report on a piece of 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.909
 paper to the letters we're going to 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:32.210
 achieve so as to have a sort of 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:35.440
 guide for for the form of fishing letters 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.940
 but this is not strictly necessary 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:41.740
 at this point we take a little sniff 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:44.720
 aluminum this is silver and 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.700
 dispersed 2 mm but clearly are fine 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.610
 other colors and types of 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.560
 smaller thicknesses this larger 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.720
 I bought it from the ball at the beach of 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.180
 roma I leave you the link to the info box of 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.220
 this video but surely after 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.530
 find this kind of thread in many 

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:01.250
 other online stores but also stores 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.520
 physical 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:06.950
 at this point we help each other with pliers 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.539
 pointed toe cones which is also with hands 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.689
 and therefore we realize these 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.689
 letters 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:06.819
 when then the form satisfies us 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:09.480
 let's cut some thread with pliers 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:09.480
 another a mess 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.220
 in the same way therefore we realize 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.220
 loyalty and letters 

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:36.720
 then letters not terminals 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:39.060
 nothing remains but to decorate them and to do 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:42.060
 this used for pearl lines 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:44.310
 swarovski also rose in resin and 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:46.350
 decorated as in the other videos mentioned 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:48.570
 I will leave the link in the info box of 

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:50.430
 this video to that leap into the hands 

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:52.530
 other than using these letters as 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:54.870
 pendants either for lilies or maybe for 

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:56.700
 necklaces and whatever else does not remain 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:59.010
 other than maybe applying a ribbon 

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:01.650
 a chain and then use these 

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:03.650
 pendants so I hope this video 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:05.850
 He enjoyed he was useful and 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:10.190
 inspirations for your actions 

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:10.190
 so at the next job, hello to everyone
