00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
doesn't really seem interested so that's

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.330 
doesn't really seem interested so that's
just<00:01:23.670> probably<00:01:24.000> oh<00:01:24.320> he's<00:01:25.320> ready<00:01:25.470> rushing<00:01:26.189> out

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340

toward is he know he's pushing okay for
a<00:01:32.340> second<00:01:32.640> I<00:01:32.670> thought<00:01:32.790> he<00:01:32.909> was<00:01:33.030> actually<00:01:33.329> about

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540

that I am on a 1.3 and gas unfortunately
the<00:01:58.560> iron<00:01:58.770> golems<00:01:59.159> doesn't<00:01:59.549> fight<00:02:00.149> the<00:02:00.840> cost<00:02:01.110> I

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
the iron golems doesn't fight the cost I

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.889 
the iron golems doesn't fight the cost I
have<00:02:01.409> tried<00:02:02.040> my<00:02:02.219> best<00:02:02.250> so<00:02:02.759> we<00:02:03.390> gotta<00:02:03.600> end<00:02:03.659> this

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
have tried my best so we gotta end this

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.410 
have tried my best so we gotta end this
he's<00:02:04.200> actually<00:02:04.380> pushing<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:05.280> guns<00:02:06.000> but<00:02:06.329> he's

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
he's actually pushing the guns but he's

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.469 
he's actually pushing the guns but he's
not<00:02:06.570> attacking<00:02:06.869> it<00:02:07.079> so<00:02:07.640> maybe<00:02:08.640> maybe<00:02:09.209> when

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
not attacking it so maybe maybe when

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:10.940 
not attacking it so maybe maybe when
they<00:02:09.569> actually<00:02:10.050> release<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.319> full<00:02:10.739> release

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
they actually release the full release

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.369 
they actually release the full release
of<00:02:11.160> the<00:02:11.280> 1.3<00:02:11.879> maybe<00:02:12.599> they're<00:02:12.900> going<00:02:13.080> to<00:02:13.170> extra

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:13.379 
of the 1.3 maybe they're going to extra

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:13.790 
of the 1.3 maybe they're going to extra
start

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
start

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.340 
start
fighting<00:02:14.280> the<00:02:14.400> gas<00:02:14.580> but<00:02:15.260> at<00:02:16.260> the<00:02:16.470> moment<00:02:16.650> no

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
fighting the gas but at the moment no

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.310 
fighting the gas but at the moment no
nothing<00:02:19.610> nothing<00:02:20.610> at<00:02:20.730> all<00:02:20.910> so<00:02:21.240> I<00:02:21.540> think<00:02:22.170> we're

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
nothing nothing at all so I think we're

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.680 
nothing nothing at all so I think we're
going<00:02:22.470> to<00:02:22.620> do<00:02:22.740> one<00:02:23.040> things<00:02:23.280> like<00:02:23.580> usual<00:02:24.090> when<00:02:24.660> a

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
going to do one things like usual when a

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.720 
going to do one things like usual when a
battle<00:02:25.050> fails<00:02:25.470> like<00:02:25.740> this<00:02:25.950> so<00:02:26.250> we<00:02:26.400> only<00:02:26.550> have

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
battle fails like this so we only have

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:33.530 
battle fails like this so we only have
one<00:02:26.760> solution<00:02:27.240> is<00:02:30.320> 1<00:02:31.320> 2<00:02:31.530> 3<00:02:31.560> and<00:02:32.180> let<00:02:33.180> the<00:02:33.330> battle

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
one solution is 1 2 3 and let the battle

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:39.200 
one solution is 1 2 3 and let the battle
go<00:02:33.810> off<00:02:36.470> so<00:02:37.470> this<00:02:38.310> is<00:02:38.490> pretty<00:02:38.730> much<00:02:38.820> the<00:02:39.180> only

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
go off so this is pretty much the only

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.450 
go off so this is pretty much the only
solution<00:02:39.900> these<00:02:40.110> things<00:02:40.530> are<00:02:40.680> still<00:02:41.010> going<00:02:41.250> on

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:41.460 
solution these things are still going on

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.030 
solution these things are still going on
we<00:02:42.120> had<00:02:42.360> to<00:02:42.390> finish<00:02:42.810> or<00:02:43.050> end<00:02:43.290> it<00:02:43.560> this<00:02:43.680> battle

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
we had to finish or end it this battle

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.860 
we had to finish or end it this battle
in<00:02:44.160> one<00:02:44.310> way<00:02:44.490> or<00:02:44.640> another<00:02:44.700> like<00:02:45.240> usual<00:02:45.690> guys

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
in one way or another like usual guys

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.200 
in one way or another like usual guys
this<00:02:46.470> is<00:02:46.620> the<00:02:46.740> last<00:02:46.950> of<00:02:47.130> virus<00:02:47.550> I<00:02:47.760> think<00:02:48.030> I'm

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.210
