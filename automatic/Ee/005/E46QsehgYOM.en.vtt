could Bank this five energy and save it

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.979 
could Bank this five energy and save it
for<00:03:22.560> later<00:03:22.739> so<00:03:23.220> that<00:03:23.250> way<00:03:23.640> every<00:03:24.600> hour<00:03:24.810> you

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989

start<00:03:28.019> out<00:03:28.140> with<00:03:28.230> five<00:03:28.560> so<00:03:29.519> that<00:03:29.700> way<00:03:29.790> you're

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
start out with five so that way you're

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.759 
start out with five so that way you're
not<00:03:30.000> wasting<00:03:30.390> it<00:03:30.750> you<00:03:30.959> can<00:03:31.109> come<00:03:31.320> back<00:03:31.470> and<00:03:31.680> you

point battling other players might do me

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.520 
point battling other players might do me
better<00:06:43.240> whereas<00:06:44.240> if<00:06:44.300> i<00:06:44.600> get<00:06:44.930> higher<00:06:45.169> up<00:06:45.200> in

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:45.530

levels and i choose to be a leveller it
might<00:06:47.870> be<00:06:47.990> better<00:06:48.169> to<00:06:48.289> battle<00:06:48.740> npc<00:06:49.220> creatures

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:49.700 
might be better to battle npc creatures

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:52.270 
might be better to battle npc creatures
