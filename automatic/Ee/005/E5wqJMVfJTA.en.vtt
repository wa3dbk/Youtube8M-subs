00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:09.800
 to keep our mouth healthy is 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:12.080
 fundamental to know the techniques of 

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:15.200
 proper hygiene and always apply 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.970
 after each meal that will not only 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.220
 ensure that we enjoy some 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.420
 healthy teeth for many years but 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:22.850
 which is also a requirement 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.650
 essential to be able to maintain 

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:26.780
 dental treatments that we have 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.270
 made the forecast of said 

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:31.789
 treatments and their duration throughout 

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:34.780
 the years is closely linked to a 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:34.780
 correct oral hygiene 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:40.150
 to simplify the sequence of 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:43.060
 brushed we will divide the mouth in four 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:45.460
 quadrants in this way we will find 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:48.000
 simpler and we will avoid forgetting 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:50.040
 some area 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.739
 we will place a small amount of 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.480
 toothpaste on the brush if we 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.489
 We exceed in the amount of toothpaste 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.770
 a lot of foam will be generated during the 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.190
 brushing what is uncomfortable and 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.809
 It can even cause nausea 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:07.050
 we will start at the top in the 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:10.090
 quadrant 1 first brush 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:12.429
 We have the external faces of the teeth 

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.710
 for this we will place the brush 

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:17.020
 slightly perpendicular to the tooth 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.030
 inclined towards the gum we will approximate 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.039
 the brush and we will make a movement 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.369
 descending gently turning the 

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:25.719
 brush until you reach the end of the tooth 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.329
 then we will separate the brush and 

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:29.679
 we will return to the initial position 

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:31.990
 repeating the same movement several 

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:34.569
 Sometimes brushing should always be 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.719
 from the gum to the tooth and never 

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:36.719
 upside down 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.780
 Once the brushing of the 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.390
 external faces 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:52.230
 we will go to brush the internal faces 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.230
 using the same technique 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.220
 finally we will catch your faces 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.800
 crushed tea 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.540
 for this we will make movements 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.870
 horizontals forward and towards 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.870
 behind 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.760
 finished brushing quadrant 1 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:34.840
 we will go to quadrant 2 brushing the 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:38.569
 in the same way for the bottom 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:40.700
 we will start with quadrant 3 as well 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:42.609
 that in the superior we will begin with the 

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:45.230
 external faces of the teeth 

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:47.030
 we will place the brush perpendicular to 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.760
 tooth slightly tilted toward the 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.670
 gum we will approximate the brush and 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.560
 we will make ascending movements 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:58.209
 gently turning the brush and always 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.209
 from the gum to the tooth 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:16.969
 after the external faces we will pass 

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:16.969
 to the internal faces 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:40.310
 finally we will catch your faces 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.550
 crush teas with movements 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.550
 horizontal 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:53.170
 finished the brushing of quadrant 3 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:56.379
 we will go to quadrant 4 and catch 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.959
 in the same way once the 

00:03:56.379 --> 00:04:01.300
 brushing all the quadrants 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:03.220
 we will go to brush the tongue for it 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:05.319
 we will take out the language and we will place the 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.239
 brush perpendicularly in the part 

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:09.190
 later then 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:11.319
 we will perform sweeps towards the part 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:14.130
 anterior of the tongue always from behind 

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:14.130
 forwards 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:20.130
 to maintain good hygiene is 

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:22.950
 It is essential to keep the brush in 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:25.290
 good condition and free of dirt for it 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:28.010
 we must change it regularly every two 

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:28.010
 or three months
