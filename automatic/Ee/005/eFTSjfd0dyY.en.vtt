00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.570
 before starting the video I wanted to tell you 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.550
 that if you are having problems 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.260
 download any game or any of my 

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:09.180
 races that you know that the social club 

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:10.890
 is having quibbles and so 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:13.170
 a user called facu told me 

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:15.300
 Gauna to be able to download the games 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.789
 you have to go to the social club change the 

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.440
 language and put it in English the language is 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.600
 it changes down completely on the page and 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.130
 Well, you change it to English to English 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.960
 you put the race or whatever 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.060
 you want to download and download it and if you 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.080
 It seems that it should give us problems 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.239
 finally said that we started with the video 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:35.570
 very good all are equal all 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:37.850
 when 747 are box my god just me 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.230
 lend right over in the end in this 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.150
 I'm even going to try to take off 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.260
 a good one may tempt to draw one but 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.360
 I think I will not get it 

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.650
 because there is one out there in the end 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.480
 this game is simply so that 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:49.160
 download this game so if you want 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.769
 try these planes with your friends 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.350
 or whoever it will also be for ps3 

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:55.910
 this time I do not usually have 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.250
 departures in presents because it was not a 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:59.510
 ps3 but I've noticed that time has 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.699
 done this race to the echo also 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.070
 for ps3 since it's simply because of 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:05.540
 the airplanes I've searched for is the 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.270
 I will put in the description also if 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.190
 I can be right now I do not know if I have it 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.200
 but in order to climb you have to 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.510
 put you down here there are not any 

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.330
 key point you put here in a 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:19.640
 moment giving and then you will end up going 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.920
 I hope that does not kill me or something because 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:25.500

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.660
