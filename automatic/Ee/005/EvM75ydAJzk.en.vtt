00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:23.570
 well I threw the advantage he was thinking 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:27.590
 some that have windows computer 

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:31.210

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:34.670
 start in the game normally kraft and 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:37.460
 he says a message that says pad cars and 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:40.670
 of something like that and well that means that 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:44.480
 has low low performance of the 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:48.350

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:52.340
 hub to this is the solution for all 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:54.650
 problems good since it 's for the 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:59.809
 habbany is the same game the mini cremá 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:01:02.240
 which is for the java and so I will not ask 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:06.710
 no error message and nothing like that 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:09.300
 good start with the video I leave the 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:13.280
 link in the video description 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:17.030
 kissimmee from kraft hui 2013 rap point 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.030
 when they download it 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:24.590
 missing two minutes 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.590
 Well I canceled it because I already have it 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:36.850
 when they had something like that of meters 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:36.850
 right click and extract here 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.900
 we will have a folder with the same 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:49.900
 first name 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:56.080
 ministers initiators ministers and a 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.080
 text document 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.259
 this as regards 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:07.430
 and good eye for what they have windows 7 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:10.940
 already when they open one of these and if they do not 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:13.970
 wants to open up what windows have 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.620
 7 do this go away the beginning tells us 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:20.660
 as a team to look for those things 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:25.190
 programs with the good and the sign of s 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:27.700
 of percentage and write app data and other 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:31.209
 time the sign 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:34.150
 of percentage and that will no longer come out as 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:36.489
 a folder I do not know how they say the folder 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:39.790
 and drag what I knitted mini grace 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:42.910
 in that folder and you can play it but 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:45.190
 what you have in windows xp because I hate not 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:47.110
 you do not get to do anything, I'm just going to 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.800
 teach starts now 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:52.340
 well I once done that 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:56.360
 let's go back 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:03:01.129
 and what I have 17 they will know this 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:05.200
 mock batch file cms 2 then 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:07.150
 they open what they have windows 7 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.660
 and this can also raise what I have 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:12.280
 27 or else can what exist 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.810
 for which I made an error these to 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:16.540
 things but that you program more for the 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.060
 game have to have that left came 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.660
 grade 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:24.770
 7 that is java file we open it 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.770
 double-clicking on it 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:33.150
 and I am fire 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:40.400
 for good to show you that you do not have 

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:40.400
 error or nothing the game because it is already good 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:47.019
 and I will leave the normal 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:58.810
 and here is no red tea of ​​it 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:02.140
 and if the game is in English where it says 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:05.049
 lava option options came out language or 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:06.790
 language will come out and they choose 100 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:10.900
 they choose Spanish 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:15.159
 the mx who is spanish mexico is ready and 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:17.350
 ready a player won and there you can and they 

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:18.940
 they give in creating new world and there I go to 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:20.890
 make your motor 

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:23.740
 when I have mine that is super 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:27.270
 Noise seems to us that it makes more clients and 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:27.270
 play very selected ones 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.220
 i 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:43.870
 as you can see if they run me well you see 

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:54.770
 and it could be that good 

00:05:04.999 --> 00:05:15.229
 tools like good things the 

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:15.229

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:39.449
 and to exit the game or to return it 

00:05:36.379 --> 00:05:42.840
 good to set it up this way 

00:05:39.449 --> 00:05:44.909
 We are options and there is for what 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:47.639
