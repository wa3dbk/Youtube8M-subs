 rating you chose perfectly this video 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:31.410
 excellent very interesting would add more 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:33.320
 what buns don't even know what you can 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:36.600
 add something to the side 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:39.000
 simple and for a very expensive something like 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:45.630
 2 lives that's how elevated at once 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:48.750
 buy also 2 buy in about 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:52.290
 half an hour to go there is no dawn then a little 

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:59.280
 I already have I thought you were five thousand 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:04:02.160
 it is only necessary that it would not be beneficial 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:06.900
 it would be profitable to buy why life so 

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:10.410
 you for so expensive ok that's much 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:13.320
 easier well, just stupidly just to survive 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:20.250
 one time than tobago jump and 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:25.580
 I just have my principle already thousands 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:25.580
 three were accumulated over all periods . 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:34.560
 300 was probably spent on g-1 for 100 

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:37.789
 dollars now I have not been to 300 for 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:39.780
 all the time I fell into two levels 

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:44.000
 want everyone to jump 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:46.319
 I stopped abruptly and I also failed 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.879
 Do you understand this date janka 

00:04:46.319 --> 00:04:49.680
 they are not always convenient because you 

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:53.460
 remember about them top when you start 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:54.930
 fall already very late but if used 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:57.780
 Only there can possibly be, and that's 

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:59.789
 Now I knew that I would fall 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:03.680
 can say so and used on 

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:03.680
 the side that they did not help me to 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:13.349
 it's good that I don't spend the money on the paus myself 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:15.090
 at the bottom level chopra cool what 

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:16.680
 here is not just giving so ten coins 

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:22.669
 start up just played for how much you 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:24.810
 held out here if you would hope 

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:28.789
 sorry here you can not rent a server 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:28.789
 to hold even a championship in jumping 

00:05:29.509 --> 00:05:35.639

00:05:32.129 --> 00:05:37.409
