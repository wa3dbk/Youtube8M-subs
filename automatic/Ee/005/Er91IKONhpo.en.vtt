00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:13.760
 and I even came in wanting to tell 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:16.309
 You about flowers in the cage 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:19.700
 I listened to this reflection and reflection 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:21.050
 He played a lot with me and I wish 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:26.240
 some way she touches your heart 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:30.860
 also look here at the small cage and 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:33.890
 flowers are many flowers not 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:36.020
 agreed to stay here inside the cage 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:40.280
 they are looking for more space are 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:43.070
 Seeing they are here, look at them coming out. 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:46.660
 want freedom because it's not legal 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:49.520
 get stuck in the cage no people 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.480
 I think this is true for our 

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.440
 life 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:58.520
 sometimes we are too 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:01.370
 our violates our dreams are all 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:03.230
 trapped inside a cage 

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:06.890
 sometimes what you want so much 

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:08.240
 realize that the moment of his life was 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.189
 so big 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.659
 some people have told you that 

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:14.720
 you were not able 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:16.090
 And then you locked this dream inside the 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.190
 cage 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.140
 I think like the flowers that are 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.810
 gorgeous 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:27.560
 You're also capable of attacking this one of yours. 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.850
 freedom goes going looking here has 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.369
 a white people that she is 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:36.110
 insisting on leaving here 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:39.290
 look flower is a greater minor little 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:44.110
 colors but they want to leave 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:47.530
 Look I want to say this to you today. 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:50.980
 also leave your cage do not get 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:53.680
 words and things they said 

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:57.280
 suddenly hurt and disrupted all the 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.540
 your dreams do not get stuck do not believe 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.820
 in their potential 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.350
 Believe you have God inside. 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.320
 Do you know how to be a person? 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:08.350
 enthusiasm is to be a person full of 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:12.010
 God then goes there in the background 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:15.160
 look for enthusiasm that everyone has 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.230
 activate enthusiasm from you and do as the 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.110
 flowers goes looking for their freedom 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:22.380
 but coming out of the cage is doing his 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.380
 best
