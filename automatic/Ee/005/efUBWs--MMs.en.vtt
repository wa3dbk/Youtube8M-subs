00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:07.439
 how about friends this is soccer for the 

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:11.460
 smaller in this occasion we will see 

00:00:07.439 --> 00:00:14.910
 some exercises for children of 4 and 5 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:21.089
 years that are conducting a driving 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:23.939
 simple between four plates or buoys fits 

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:25.890
 note that this distance is appropriate 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.949
 for them that is approximately one 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:31.890
 separation of one meter between each plate 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.899
 and at a distance of 10 meters but it does 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.149
 true action on the left it 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:39.539
 recommends working towards both 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:41.250
 profiles so that over time go on 

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:43.260
 perfection and that of the lawyers rose in 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.329
 address repeated in the possibility of 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.249
 do it with both profiles 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:49.930
 the firing of the card will be a 

00:00:48.249 --> 00:00:52.840
 small goal of 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.790
 one and a half meters two meters to one 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.540
 greater distance 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:57.540
 8 meters 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:06.060
 repetition is the basis of success for 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:07.950
 therefore we must always wait 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.570
 with your exercise and do it from the 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.909
 better way 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.060
 Above all we must have patience 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.060
 remember that we must have patience 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:21.060
 they are young children who are learning 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:23.490
 First you have to make your body known 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:27.110
 to move with the strange object that in 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.110
 this case is the ball 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.590
 the fun first and foremost should be the 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:33.760
 first day 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.270
 the child must have 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:39.130
 note that at the end of an exercise 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.430
 will be congratulated for the effort 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.430
 accomplished 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.600
 deny it 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.600
 we make 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.880
 is important in these groups of children 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.840
 small do not have more than five elements 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.020
 per row 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:08.619
 It is recommended to do this with several 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:11.709
 circuits at a time to prevent them from 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:15.569
 distracted and have less 

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:19.290
 repetitions in the practice time 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:22.870
 I am your friend Rafael Capi Garcia and 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:25.690
 I see in the next video 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:29.400
 thank you very much remember hand up 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.400
 if you like them until later
