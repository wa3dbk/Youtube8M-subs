well<00:00:09.510> it's<00:00:09.540> from<00:00:09.870> Tings<00:00:10.230> construction<00:00:10.889> but

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
well it's from Tings construction but

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.490 
well it's from Tings construction but
it's<00:00:11.160> in<00:00:11.280> big<00:00:11.550> diggings<00:00:11.969> and<00:00:12.090> all<00:00:12.269> amongst<00:00:12.660> so

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
it's in big diggings and all amongst so

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.350 
it's in big diggings and all amongst so
who<00:00:13.710> get<00:00:13.830> your<00:00:13.980> materials<00:00:14.460> you<00:00:14.700> Sharona<00:00:15.089> lies

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
who get your materials you Sharona lies

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.230 
who get your materials you Sharona lies
some<00:00:15.540> class<00:00:15.839> for<00:00:16.139> this<00:00:16.699> because<00:00:17.699> you<00:00:17.910> require

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
some class for this because you require

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.010 
some class for this because you require
a<00:00:18.570> longer<00:00:18.869> tank<00:00:19.050> and<00:00:19.350> some<00:00:20.070> other<00:00:20.220> stuff

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:21.020 
a longer tank and some other stuff

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:26.060 
a longer tank and some other stuff
anyway<00:00:22.189> you<00:00:23.189> require<00:00:23.490> a<00:00:23.550> base<00:00:23.970> of<00:00:24.269> 3<00:00:25.170> by<00:00:25.350> 3<00:00:25.710> so

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
anyway you require a base of 3 by 3 so

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.429 
anyway you require a base of 3 by 3 so
that<00:00:26.189> equivalence<00:00:27.029> to<00:00:27.300> 9<00:00:27.840> bricks

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
that equivalence to 9 bricks

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.299 
that equivalence to 9 bricks
well<00:00:29.070> I<00:00:29.390> complete<00:00:30.390> bricks<00:00:31.160> really<00:00:32.160> should

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
well I complete bricks really should

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.540 
well I complete bricks really should
have<00:00:32.430> grabbed<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.730> problem<00:00:33.120> then<00:00:34.130> it<00:00:35.130> has<00:00:35.340> to

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
have grabbed the problem then it has to

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.310 
have grabbed the problem then it has to
be<00:00:35.700> the<00:00:36.710> bricks<00:00:37.710> to<00:00:37.950> actually<00:00:38.280> work<00:00:39.050> then<00:00:40.050> you

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
be the bricks to actually work then you

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.500 

okay<00:01:47.250> I<00:01:47.400> don't<00:01:47.520> think<00:01:47.820> I<00:01:47.880> have<00:01:47.970> enough<00:01:48.030> blocks

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:48.510 
okay I don't think I have enough blocks

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:56.270 
okay I don't think I have enough blocks
but<00:01:52.340> now<00:01:53.340> you're<00:01:53.880> quiet<00:01:54.180> 3x3<00:01:54.960> base<00:01:55.170> so<00:01:56.070> just

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
but now you're quiet 3x3 base so just

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:03.610 
but now you're quiet 3x3 base so just
get<00:01:57.740> 3x3<00:01:58.740> sunblocks<00:01:59.400> out<00:02:00.560> put<00:02:01.560> them<00:02:01.680> down<00:02:01.920> now

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:03.620 
get 3x3 sunblocks out put them down now

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:07.430 
get 3x3 sunblocks out put them down now
you<00:02:04.620> require<00:02:04.770> to<00:02:05.280> build<00:02:05.580> these<00:02:06.510> things<00:02:06.840> around

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:07.440 
you require to build these things around

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:08.900 
you require to build these things around
the<00:02:07.650> base<00:02:07.830> so<00:02:08.130> you<00:02:08.190> need<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.490> smelts<00:02:08.850> you

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
the base so you need the smelts you

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.760 
the base so you need the smelts you
control<00:02:09.270> any<00:02:09.540> level<00:02:09.929> of<00:02:10.020> us<00:02:10.140> put<00:02:10.290> it<00:02:10.380> there<00:02:10.590> and

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
control any level of us put it there and

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.010 
control any level of us put it there and
then<00:02:10.830> you<00:02:11.430> need<00:02:11.610> a<00:02:11.820> lava<00:02:12.090> tank<00:02:12.420> on<00:02:12.600> the<00:02:12.690> exact

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
then you need a lava tank on the exact

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.590 
then you need a lava tank on the exact
same<00:02:13.170> level<00:02:13.440> for<00:02:13.710> it<00:02:13.800> to<00:02:13.860> actually<00:02:14.010> work<00:02:14.600> put

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
same level for it to actually work put

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.690 
same level for it to actually work put
the<00:02:15.690> seed<00:02:15.870> windows<00:02:16.170> down<00:02:16.400> I'll<00:02:17.400> need<00:02:17.610> your

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
now that should light up when it's

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.540 
now that should light up when it's
complete<00:02:51.630> a<00:02:51.750> nice<00:02:51.930> beat<00:02:52.230> up<00:02:52.380> by<00:02:52.650> two<00:02:52.709> you<00:02:53.310> can

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
complete a nice beat up by two you can

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.310 
complete a nice beat up by two you can
actually<00:02:53.700> increase<00:02:54.090> the<00:02:54.420> white<00:02:54.660> the<00:02:54.989> width<00:02:55.200> of

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:55.320 
actually increase the white the width of

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.750 
actually increase the white the width of
it<00:02:55.470> and<00:02:56.100> then<00:02:56.220> your<00:02:56.400> action<00:02:56.640> when<00:02:56.730> you

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
it and then your action when you

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:04.430 
it and then your action when you
increase<00:02:57.120> it<00:02:57.300> upwards<00:02:58.310> some<00:02:59.310> lava<00:03:03.290> where<00:03:04.290> is

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
on the lava tank and it will slowly fill

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:17.990 
on the lava tank and it will slowly fill
up<00:03:16.110> actually<00:03:17.010> i<00:03:17.070> just<00:03:17.100> fill<00:03:17.430> up<00:03:17.549> very<00:03:17.790> quickly

the<00:03:18.780> other<00:03:18.930> guys<00:03:19.140> it's<00:03:19.350> a<00:03:19.410> one<00:03:19.560> block<00:03:19.769> of<00:03:20.010> it

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
the other guys it's a one block of it

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.979 
the other guys it's a one block of it
and<00:03:20.280> then<00:03:20.519> you<00:03:20.670> require<00:03:21.090> some<00:03:21.390> stuff<00:03:21.690> to<00:03:21.870> put

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
and then you require some stuff to put

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:22.610 
and then you require some stuff to put
into<00:03:22.170> it

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
into it

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.770 
into it
don't<00:03:23.370> forget<00:03:23.580> your<00:03:23.730> faucet<00:03:24.120> which<00:03:24.420> should

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
don't forget your faucet which should

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.009 
don't forget your faucet which should
something<00:03:25.410> new<00:03:25.620> into<00:03:25.920> it<00:03:26.570> now<00:03:27.570> that<00:03:27.780> you

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
something new into it now that you

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:30.710 
something new into it now that you
require<00:03:28.380> some<00:03:29.370> materials<00:03:30.000> to<00:03:30.120> do<00:03:30.299> this<00:03:30.480> and<00:03:30.660> i

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
require some materials to do this and i

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.860 
require some materials to do this and i
should<00:03:30.900> just<00:03:30.930> go<00:03:31.230> get<00:03:31.709> sonata<00:03:31.950> mike<00:03:32.310> bank<00:03:32.840> okay

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
should just go get sonata mike bank okay

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:39.020 
should just go get sonata mike bank okay
now<00:03:34.440> to<00:03:35.040> make<00:03:35.250> a<00:03:35.959> ingot<00:03:36.959> cast<00:03:37.799> you<00:03:38.489> actually

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
now to make a ingot cast you actually

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.780 
now to make a ingot cast you actually
need<00:03:39.269> to<00:03:39.299> make<00:03:39.540> a<00:03:39.930> special<00:03:40.830> formula<00:03:41.310> thing<00:03:41.519> in

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
need to make a special formula thing in

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.789 
need to make a special formula thing in
here<00:03:42.150> which<00:03:42.810> is<00:03:43.160> equivalent<00:03:44.160> to<00:03:44.489> it<00:03:45.000> is<00:03:45.840> one

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
here which is equivalent to it is one

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:48.830 
here which is equivalent to it is one
copper<00:03:47.130> two<00:03:47.370> three<00:03:47.580> aluminium<00:03:48.120> but<00:03:48.600> there

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
copper two three aluminium but there

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:54.770 
copper two three aluminium but there
that's<00:03:49.110> count<00:03:49.380> as<00:03:49.470> ingots<00:03:49.950> so<00:03:51.140> if<00:03:52.140> you<00:03:52.709> put<00:03:52.980> in

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
that's count as ingots so if you put in

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:58.080 
that's count as ingots so if you put in
one<00:03:55.780> copper<00:03:56.170> or<00:03:56.349> it<00:03:56.650> correlates<00:03:57.189> to<00:03:57.370> say<00:03:57.939> your

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
one copper or it correlates to say your

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:03.420 
one copper or it correlates to say your
PI<00:03:58.329> put<00:03:58.510> in<00:03:59.040> three<00:04:00.040> ingots<00:04:01.439> three<00:04:02.439> to<00:04:03.220> get<00:04:03.340> the

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
PI put in three ingots three to get the

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:06.509 
PI put in three ingots three to get the
same<00:04:03.640> amount<00:04:03.760> of<00:04:04.030> out<00:04:04.739> to<00:04:05.739> get<00:04:05.920> its<00:04:06.250> own

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:06.519 
same amount of out to get its own

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:11.339 
same amount of out to get its own
mixture<00:04:07.390> cold<00:04:07.780> and<00:04:08.519> Lebanon<00:04:09.519> brass<00:04:10.239> ingot<00:04:10.780> I'd

00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:11.349 
mixture cold and Lebanon brass ingot I'd

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:13.380 
mixture cold and Lebanon brass ingot I'd
spell<00:04:11.650> pronounced<00:04:12.340> that<00:04:12.430> incorrectly<00:04:12.549> but<00:04:13.209> so

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390 
spell pronounced that incorrectly but so

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.690 
spell pronounced that incorrectly but so
what<00:04:13.599> what<00:04:14.140> you<00:04:14.379> put<00:04:14.920> it<00:04:15.010> in<00:04:15.069> there<00:04:15.280> and<00:04:15.459> it

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700 
what what you put it in there and it

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.020 
what what you put it in there and it
slowly<00:04:15.939> heats<00:04:16.269> up<00:04:16.769> now<00:04:17.769> once<00:04:18.009> it<00:04:18.190> goes<00:04:18.340> full<00:04:18.729> if

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
slowly heats up now once it goes full if

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:21.479 
slowly heats up now once it goes full if
you<00:04:19.120> actually<00:04:19.269> notice<00:04:19.690> in<00:04:19.810> the<00:04:19.900> bottom<00:04:20.489> you

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:21.489 
you actually notice in the bottom you

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:23.670 
you actually notice in the bottom you
can<00:04:21.639> see<00:04:21.669> the<00:04:21.820> oil<00:04:22.120> and<00:04:22.419> one<00:04:22.900> once<00:04:23.500> it's

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
can see the oil and one once it's

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.950 
can see the oil and one once it's
complete<00:04:24.070> the<00:04:24.880> old<00:04:25.090> will<00:04:25.270> turn<00:04:25.479> into<00:04:25.630> a<00:04:25.720> liquid

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
complete the old will turn into a liquid

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.990 
complete the old will turn into a liquid
as<00:04:26.680> you<00:04:26.710> can<00:04:26.979> see<00:04:27.130> the<00:04:27.250> lava<00:04:27.430> just<00:04:27.699> went<00:04:27.850> down

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:31.780 
now comput it's a little bit longer to

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:38.370 
now comput it's a little bit longer to
do<00:04:31.930> than<00:04:32.400> aluminium<00:04:34.199> and<00:04:35.199> so<00:04:35.470> what<00:04:35.710> I<00:04:37.110> can<00:04:38.110> do

00:06:07.049 --> 00:06:07.059 
now to actually increase its capacity

00:06:07.059 --> 00:06:09.689
