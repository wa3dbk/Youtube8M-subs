the<00:00:23.010> advantages<00:00:23.640> of<00:00:23.699> 0<00:00:24.060> le<00:00:24.300> d<00:00:24.689> are<00:00:25.430> that<00:00:26.430> it<00:00:26.820> has

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
the advantages of 0 le d are that it has

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.689 
the advantages of 0 le d are that it has
an<00:00:27.359> infinite<00:00:27.720> contrast<00:00:28.140> ratio<00:00:28.859> because<00:00:29.550> we're

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
an infinite contrast ratio because we're

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.400 
an infinite contrast ratio because we're
not<00:00:29.730> utilizing<00:00:30.390> a<00:00:30.480> back<00:00:30.689> light<00:00:30.900> through<00:00:31.380> a

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
not utilizing a back light through a

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.459 
not utilizing a back light through a
pixel<00:00:32.219> panel<00:00:32.809> it's<00:00:33.809> a<00:00:33.930> self<00:00:34.230> illuminating

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
pixel panel it's a self illuminating

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.510 
pixel panel it's a self illuminating
display<00:00:35.309> so<00:00:35.969> by<00:00:36.450> increasing<00:00:37.410> our<00:00:37.829> contrast<00:00:38.370> to

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
display so by increasing our contrast to

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.220 
display so by increasing our contrast to
infinite<00:00:38.940> we're<00:00:39.149> able<00:00:39.300> to<00:00:39.570> deliver<00:00:39.809> a<00:00:39.960> wider

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
infinite we're able to deliver a wider

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.690 
infinite we're able to deliver a wider
color<00:00:40.620> gamut<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:41.579> the<00:00:41.700> viewer<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:43.160> also<00:00:44.160> were

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
color gamut to the viewer and also were

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.540 
color gamut to the viewer and also were
able<00:00:44.760> to<00:00:45.450> increase<00:00:45.930> our<00:00:46.260> viewing<00:00:46.590> angle<00:00:47.100> so

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
able to increase our viewing angle so

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.910 
able to increase our viewing angle so
there's<00:00:47.760> no<00:00:47.940> backlight<00:00:48.739> inhibiting<00:00:49.739> our

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
there's no backlight inhibiting our

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.069 
there's no backlight inhibiting our
viewing<00:00:50.430> range<00:00:50.760> so<00:00:51.210> we<00:00:51.360> have<00:00:51.480> a<00:00:51.510> free<00:00:51.780> viewing

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
viewing range so we have a free viewing

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.549 
viewing range so we have a free viewing
angle<00:00:52.500> across<00:00:52.590> a<00:00:53.100> wider<00:00:54.110> horizontal<00:00:55.110> distance

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
angle across a wider horizontal distance

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.220 
angle across a wider horizontal distance
side<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.730> side<00:00:56.760> then<00:00:57.239> a<00:00:57.270> traditional<00:00:57.809> backlit

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
side to side then a traditional backlit

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.849 
side to side then a traditional backlit
LED<00:00:58.410> display<00:00:59.010> then<00:01:00.000> when<00:01:00.180> you<00:01:00.300> get<00:01:00.449> into<00:01:00.859> the

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
LED display then when you get into the

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.240 
LED display then when you get into the
actual<00:01:02.670> abilities<00:01:03.239> of<00:01:03.420> this<00:01:03.600> TV<00:01:03.960> it's<00:01:04.250> not

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
actual abilities of this TV it's not

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.340

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
only a superb TV TV with the infinite

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.500 
only a superb TV TV with the infinite
contrast<00:01:07.560> but<00:01:08.100> it<00:01:08.220> also<00:01:08.400> is<00:01:08.580> based<00:01:08.909> off<00:01:09.150> of<00:01:09.210> our

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
contrast but it also is based off of our

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.380 
contrast but it also is based off of our
cinema<00:01:09.960> 3d<00:01:10.200> platform<00:01:10.890> so<00:01:11.430> it<00:01:11.640> is<00:01:11.670> using<00:01:12.180> our
