00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.819 
used to be jeans but the jeans were too
short<00:00:30.230> so<00:00:30.290> I<00:00:30.680> just<00:00:30.950> cut<00:00:31.220> them

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:33.829 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:35.439 

and<00:00:33.920> then<00:00:34.670> you<00:00:34.789> will<00:00:34.879> just<00:00:34.940> need<00:00:35.120> some

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:45.810 
you want to take your scissors and cut a

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.920 
you want to take your scissors and cut a
split<00:00:46.680> into<00:00:47.040> your<00:00:47.190> jeans<00:00:47.490> or<00:00:47.730> shorts<00:00:47.940> and<00:00:48.270> make

split into your jeans or shorts and make

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.950 
split into your jeans or shorts and make
sure<00:00:48.960> you<00:00:49.410> only<00:00:49.620> cut<00:00:50.580> like<00:00:51.150> the<00:00:51.420> very<00:00:51.600> top

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
sure you only cut like the very top

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.080 
sure you only cut like the very top
layer<00:00:52.260> and<00:00:52.530> it<00:00:52.650> doesn't<00:00:52.950> go<00:00:53.010> through<00:00:53.090> like

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
layer and it doesn't go through like

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.870 
layer and it doesn't go through like
your<00:00:54.300> whole<00:00:54.510> jeans<00:00:54.990> or<00:00:55.200> shorts<00:00:55.380> obviously<00:00:56.100> so

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:56.880 
your whole jeans or shorts obviously so

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.640 
your whole jeans or shorts obviously so
it<00:00:57.150> looks<00:00:57.330> like<00:00:57.390> I'm<00:00:57.600> cutting<00:00:57.870> a<00:00:58.020> lot<00:00:58.200> that<00:00:58.440> I'm

00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:58.650 
it looks like I'm cutting a lot that I'm

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.390 
it looks like I'm cutting a lot that I'm
actually<00:00:59.100> just<00:00:59.520> cutting<00:00:59.820> a<00:00:59.910> little<00:00:59.940> slit<00:01:00.600> and

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:01.400 
actually just cutting a little slit and

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.600 
actually just cutting a little slit and
it<00:01:02.400> looks<00:01:02.580> just<00:01:02.880> like<00:01:03.000> that<00:01:03.240> and<00:01:03.860> then<00:01:04.860> you<00:01:05.460> can

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
it looks just like that and then you can

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.730 
it looks just like that and then you can
use<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.910> same<00:01:06.120> scissors<00:01:06.540> but<00:01:06.840> I<00:01:07.110> find<00:01:07.620> it

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
use the same scissors but I find it

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.400 
use the same scissors but I find it
easier<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:08.130> use<00:01:08.400> smaller<00:01:08.760> scissors<00:01:09.270> I'm<00:01:09.480> just

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:10.410 
easier to use smaller scissors I'm just

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.430 
easier to use smaller scissors I'm just
going<00:01:10.740> to<00:01:10.890> cut<00:01:11.670> another<00:01:11.910> slit<00:01:12.660> right<00:01:12.900> on<00:01:13.110> top

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:13.440 
going to cut another slit right on top

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.740 
going to cut another slit right on top
of<00:01:13.470> that<00:01:13.830> so<00:01:14.400> they're<00:01:14.760> kind<00:01:14.910> of<00:01:15.030> like<00:01:15.210> parallel

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
of that so they're kind of like parallel

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.730 
of that so they're kind of like parallel
and<00:01:16.050> it<00:01:16.470> makes<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.280> little<00:01:17.550> loop

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
and it makes a little loop

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.190 
and it makes a little loop
and<00:01:19.829> then<00:01:20.640> I'm<00:01:20.759> just<00:01:20.909> cutting<00:01:21.210> another<00:01:21.750> split

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
and then I'm just cutting another split

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:30.540 
and then I'm just cutting another split
on<00:01:22.350> top<00:01:22.680> of<00:01:22.860> that

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:30.550 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:36.780 

you

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.910 

so<00:01:37.600> that's<00:01:37.930> what<00:01:38.110> mine<00:01:38.260> looks<00:01:38.440> like<00:01:38.590> you<00:01:38.740> can

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
so that's what mine looks like you can

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.980 
so that's what mine looks like you can
obviously<00:01:39.340> cut<00:01:39.910> more<00:01:40.120> slits<00:01:40.360> if<00:01:40.480> you<00:01:40.600> want<00:01:40.810> it

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
obviously cut more slits if you want it

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.680 
obviously cut more slits if you want it
to<00:01:41.230> be<00:01:41.350> more<00:01:41.500> distressed<00:01:41.950> and<00:01:42.190> so<00:01:43.150> this<00:01:43.480> is<00:01:43.660> a

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:43.690 
to be more distressed and so this is a

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:45.600 
to be more distressed and so this is a
kind<00:01:43.900> of<00:01:44.080> complicated<00:01:44.680> part<00:01:44.950> you<00:01:45.400> want<00:01:45.550> to

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:45.610 
kind of complicated part you want to

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.210 
kind of complicated part you want to
take<00:01:45.760> your<00:01:45.910> tweezers<00:01:46.390> and<00:01:46.710> there<00:01:47.710> are<00:01:48.040> these

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
take your tweezers and there are these

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:49.920 
take your tweezers and there are these
blue<00:01:48.700> strings<00:01:49.030> I<00:01:49.180> run<00:01:49.390> up<00:01:49.600> and<00:01:49.780> down<00:01:49.840> your

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
blue strings I run up and down your

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.470 
blue strings I run up and down your
jeans<00:01:50.200> and<00:01:50.470> you<00:01:50.620> just<00:01:50.830> want<00:01:51.070> to<00:01:51.160> pull<00:01:51.850> one<00:01:52.330> of

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:52.480 
jeans and you just want to pull one of

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.630 
jeans and you just want to pull one of
them<00:01:52.630> out<00:01:52.840> and<00:01:53.170> it<00:01:53.740> will<00:01:53.950> be<00:01:54.100> a<00:01:54.340> little

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
them out and it will be a little

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.520 
them out and it will be a little
difficult<00:01:54.970> to<00:01:55.270> pull<00:01:55.570> the<00:01:55.720> first<00:01:55.960> one<00:01:56.140> out<00:01:56.170> but

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:56.530 
difficult to pull the first one out but

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:58.380 
difficult to pull the first one out but
once<00:01:57.040> you<00:01:57.160> get<00:01:57.280> like<00:01:57.460> the<00:01:57.610> first<00:01:57.850> three<00:01:58.240> out

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
once you get like the first three out

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:08.550 
once you get like the first three out
the<00:01:58.600> rest<00:01:58.810> of<00:01:58.930> them<00:01:59.080> come<00:01:59.440> out<00:01:59.530> so<00:01:59.920> easy

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.260 

you

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.330 

so<00:02:12.840> you<00:02:12.900> can<00:02:13.140> already<00:02:13.350> probably<00:02:13.830> see<00:02:14.310> the

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
so you can already probably see the

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.970 
so you can already probably see the
distress<00:02:14.970> look<00:02:15.240> going<00:02:15.450> on<00:02:15.690> there<00:02:15.960> so<00:02:16.440> I'm<00:02:16.770> just

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
distress look going on there so I'm just

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.380 
distress look going on there so I'm just
going<00:02:17.130> to<00:02:17.220> finish<00:02:17.490> up<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:17.940> rest<00:02:18.090> of<00:02:18.300> the

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
going to finish up the rest of the

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:26.650 
going to finish up the rest of the
strings

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660
