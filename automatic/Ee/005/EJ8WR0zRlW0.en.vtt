00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:56.510 
years so what happened is it hasn't been
hasn't<00:00:51.930> started<00:00:52.469> so<00:00:53.750> basically<00:00:54.980> the<00:00:55.980> thing<00:00:56.250> is

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
hasn't started so basically the thing is

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.849 
hasn't started so basically the thing is
a<00:00:58.940> lot<00:00:59.940> of<00:01:00.000> gunk<00:01:00.329> built<00:01:00.780> up<00:01:01.050> here<00:01:01.379> in<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.590> carb

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
a lot of gunk built up here in the carb

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.070 
a lot of gunk built up here in the carb
and<00:01:02.250> I<00:01:02.640> already<00:01:02.940> went<00:01:03.120> ahead<00:01:03.239> and<00:01:03.570> cleaned

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
and I already went ahead and cleaned

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.710 
and I already went ahead and cleaned
that<00:01:04.229> out<00:01:04.430> so<00:01:05.430> I<00:01:05.460> took<00:01:05.700> apart<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.000> carb<00:01:06.330> here

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
that out so I took apart the carb here

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.109 
that out so I took apart the carb here
and<00:01:06.869> on<00:01:07.380> these<00:01:07.619> models<00:01:08.340> here<00:01:09.000> you<00:01:10.189> have<00:01:11.189> inside

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
and on these models here you have inside

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.719 
and on these models here you have inside
this<00:01:12.270> carb<00:01:12.600> here<00:01:12.869> it's<00:01:13.080> all<00:01:13.260> plastic<00:01:13.729> so

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
this carb here it's all plastic so

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.550 
this carb here it's all plastic so
basically<00:01:15.210> what<00:01:15.420> I<00:01:15.450> suggest<00:01:15.900> to<00:01:15.990> do<00:01:16.140> is<00:01:16.290> remove

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
basically what I suggest to do is remove

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.300 
basically what I suggest to do is remove
all<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.920> seals<00:01:17.220> remove<00:01:17.909> the<00:01:18.240> needle<00:01:19.310> shoot

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
all the seals remove the needle shoot

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.230 
all the seals remove the needle shoot
everything<00:01:20.580> with<00:01:20.909> carb<00:01:21.240> cleaner<00:01:21.890> then<00:01:22.890> again

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
everything with carb cleaner then again

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.100 
everything with carb cleaner then again
different<00:01:24.240> models<00:01:24.509> might<00:01:24.720> have<00:01:24.869> different

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
different models might have different

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.130 
different models might have different
seals<00:01:25.530> other<00:01:25.920> where<00:01:26.360> sometimes<00:01:27.360> here<00:01:27.930> around

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
seals other where sometimes here around

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.819 
seals other where sometimes here around
the<00:01:28.729> the<00:01:29.729> tube<00:01:29.970> so<00:01:30.390> you<00:01:30.420> gotta<00:01:30.810> be<00:01:31.229> careful<00:01:31.409> not

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
the the tube so you gotta be careful not

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.850 
the the tube so you gotta be careful not
to<00:01:32.640> put<00:01:32.850> brake<00:01:33.150> cleaner<00:01:33.450> on<00:01:33.659> that<00:01:33.869> or<00:01:34.079> did<00:01:34.350> the

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
to put brake cleaner on that or did the

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.480 
to put brake cleaner on that or did the
seals<00:01:35.189> will<00:01:35.579> kind<00:01:36.420> of<00:01:36.770> expand<00:01:37.770> so<00:01:38.130> you<00:01:38.340> don't

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
seals will kind of expand so you don't

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.069 
seals will kind of expand so you don't
want<00:01:38.640> to<00:01:38.729> do<00:01:38.850> that<00:01:39.030> so<00:01:39.600> what<00:01:39.720> I<00:01:39.750> went<00:01:39.990> ahead

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079

everything temporarily back together
just<00:01:46.979> to<00:01:47.280> see<00:01:47.460> if<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:47.670> machine<00:01:47.939> would<00:01:48.149> start

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
just to see if the machine would start

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.510 
just to see if the machine would start
then<00:01:49.369> what<00:01:50.369> I<00:01:50.399> would<00:01:50.670> do<00:01:50.820> next<00:01:51.030> is<00:01:52.250> now<00:01:53.250> that<00:01:53.430> I

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
then what I would do next is now that I

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.520 
then what I would do next is now that I

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
the spark plug change the oil and change

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.880 
the spark plug change the oil and change
the<00:01:59.759> gas<00:01:59.969> just<00:02:00.840> to<00:02:00.990> make<00:02:01.140> sure<00:02:01.170> that<00:02:01.649> the

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
the gas just to make sure that the

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.149 
the gas just to make sure that the
customer<00:02:02.520> gets<00:02:02.700> a<00:02:02.790> product<00:02:03.180> in<00:02:03.360> great<00:02:04.159> working

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
customer gets a product in great working

condition<00:02:05.880> so<00:02:06.509> I'm<00:02:06.600> gonna<00:02:06.780> go<00:02:06.960> here<00:02:07.200> and<00:02:07.350> do<00:02:07.469> a

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
condition so I'm gonna go here and do a

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.550 
condition so I'm gonna go here and do a
test<00:02:07.770> run<00:02:08.039> and<00:02:08.819> leave<00:02:09.270> it<00:02:09.390> like<00:02:09.420> this<00:02:09.780> and<00:02:10.080> then

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
test run and leave it like this and then

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:38.390 
test run and leave it like this and then
we'll<00:02:10.770> put<00:02:11.039> it<00:02:11.129> back<00:02:11.160> together

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.500 

so<00:02:39.400> now<00:02:39.549> that<00:02:39.670> we<00:02:39.790> know<00:02:39.819> this<00:02:40.060> machine<00:02:40.269> is

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
so now that we know this machine is

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.080 
so now that we know this machine is
working<00:02:40.689> fine<00:02:41.110> I'm<00:02:42.040> gonna<00:02:42.280> go<00:02:42.400> ahead<00:02:42.549> and<00:02:42.819> put

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
working fine I'm gonna go ahead and put

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.059 
working fine I'm gonna go ahead and put
things<00:02:43.360> back<00:02:43.569> together<00:02:43.780> and<00:02:44.200> I'm<00:02:44.620> gonna<00:02:44.920> try

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:45.069

to<00:02:45.129> put<00:02:45.370> them<00:02:45.459> back<00:02:45.610> together<00:02:45.819> a<00:02:46.060> bit<00:02:46.299> showing

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:46.569 
to put them back together a bit showing
