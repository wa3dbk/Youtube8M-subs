No

00:00:03.809 --> 00:00:03.819 

00:00:03.819 --> 00:00:06.429 

so<00:00:04.819> we're<00:00:05.090> here<00:00:05.359> with<00:00:05.509> Neil<00:00:05.720> Olsen<00:00:05.960> right<00:00:06.290> now

00:00:06.429 --> 00:00:06.439 
so we're here with Neil Olsen right now

00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:08.499 
so we're here with Neil Olsen right now
who<00:00:06.830> is<00:00:07.099> going<00:00:07.250> to<00:00:07.340> show<00:00:07.490> us<00:00:07.609> how<00:00:07.729> to<00:00:07.760> do<00:00:07.939> a<00:00:08.179> very

00:00:08.499 --> 00:00:08.509 
who is going to show us how to do a very

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:10.810 
who is going to show us how to do a very
fancy<00:00:08.950> time-lapse<00:00:09.950> technique<00:00:10.370> where<00:00:10.670> the

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:10.820 
fancy time-lapse technique where the

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:21.489 
fancy time-lapse technique where the
camera<00:00:11.210> moves<00:00:11.510> during<00:00:12.080> a<00:00:12.200> time<00:00:12.380> lapse<00:00:20.499> most

00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:21.499 
camera moves during a time lapse most

00:00:21.499 --> 00:00:26.800 
camera moves during a time lapse most
important<00:00:22.210> this<00:00:23.210> is<00:00:23.509> a<00:00:24.220> rail<00:00:25.220> that<00:00:25.579> the<00:00:26.359> camera

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:26.810 
important this is a rail that the camera

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:28.779 
important this is a rail that the camera
is<00:00:26.960> going<00:00:27.109> to<00:00:27.199> move<00:00:27.349> along<00:00:27.619> as<00:00:28.130> the<00:00:28.339> time<00:00:28.519> lapse

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:28.789 
is going to move along as the time lapse

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:31.509 
is going to move along as the time lapse
progresses<00:00:29.419> we<00:00:29.929> can<00:00:30.050> do<00:00:30.229> a<00:00:30.259> time<00:00:30.560> lapse<00:00:30.589> and<00:00:31.159> we

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:31.519 
progresses we can do a time lapse and we

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:33.610 
progresses we can do a time lapse and we
can<00:00:31.699> make<00:00:32.329> the<00:00:32.480> camera<00:00:32.660> move<00:00:33.020> just<00:00:33.320> like<00:00:33.410> it

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:33.620 
can make the camera move just like it

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.520 
can make the camera move just like it
would<00:00:33.800> in<00:00:33.880> a<00:00:34.880> moving<00:00:35.180> shot<00:00:35.360> on<00:00:35.540> a<00:00:35.570> dolly<00:00:35.870> or<00:00:36.200> on

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:36.530 
would in a moving shot on a dolly or on

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:38.650 
would in a moving shot on a dolly or on
a<00:00:36.560> crane<00:00:36.890> except<00:00:37.370> much<00:00:37.610> much<00:00:37.910> slower<00:00:38.150> to

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:38.660 
a crane except much much slower to

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.480 
a crane except much much slower to
accommodate<00:00:39.290> the<00:00:39.380> time<00:00:39.590> lapse<00:00:39.830> did<00:00:40.280> you<00:00:40.370> get

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:40.490 
accommodate the time lapse did you get

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:43.390 
accommodate the time lapse did you get
this<00:00:40.670> Neil<00:00:41.410> we<00:00:42.410> ordered<00:00:42.800> it<00:00:42.950> from<00:00:43.070> a<00:00:43.220> company

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:43.400 
this Neil we ordered it from a company

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.630 
this Neil we ordered it from a company
called<00:00:43.640> dynamic<00:00:44.180> perception<00:00:45.170> which<00:00:46.100> makes

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
called dynamic perception which makes

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.160 
called dynamic perception which makes
these<00:00:46.880> time-lapse<00:00:47.420> setups<00:00:47.720> that's<00:00:47.900> all<00:00:48.020> they

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 
these time-lapse setups that's all they

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.490 
these time-lapse setups that's all they
do

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 
do

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.450 
do
so<00:00:49.070> how<00:00:49.460> much<00:00:49.910> was<00:00:50.120> this<00:00:50.300> aesthetic<00:00:51.230> it's<00:00:52.040> I

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
so how much was this aesthetic it's I

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.630 
so how much was this aesthetic it's I
think<00:00:52.700> it<00:00:52.790> runs<00:00:52.970> about<00:00:53.740> $900<00:00:54.740> so<00:00:55.070> it's<00:00:55.460> not

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:55.640 
think it runs about $900 so it's not

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.480 
think it runs about $900 so it's not
cheap<00:00:56.000> but<00:00:56.530> really<00:00:57.530> gives<00:00:58.010> us<00:00:58.130> some<00:00:58.310> cool

00:00:58.480 --> 00:00:58.490 
cheap but really gives us some cool

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:00.520 
cheap but really gives us some cool
results<00:00:58.970> so<00:00:59.090> I<00:00:59.120> think<00:00:59.240> it's<00:00:59.480> worth<00:00:59.630> it<00:00:59.840> but<00:01:00.440> I

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
results so I think it's worth it but I

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.170 
results so I think it's worth it but I
am<00:01:00.650> a<00:01:00.680> little<00:01:01.160> bit<00:01:01.250> jealous<00:01:01.460> I<00:01:01.700> wish<00:01:01.820> I<00:01:01.940> had<00:01:02.060> one

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.180 
am a little bit jealous I wish I had one

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:03.160 
am a little bit jealous I wish I had one
of<00:01:02.270> these<00:01:02.360> this<00:01:02.660> is<00:01:02.720> what's<00:01:02.989> going<00:01:03.110> to

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
of these this is what's going to

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:04.780 
of these this is what's going to
actually<00:01:03.410> control<00:01:03.829> the<00:01:03.980> camera<00:01:04.430> and<00:01:04.640> the

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
actually control the camera and the

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.460 
actually control the camera and the
movement<00:01:05.239> this<00:01:05.390> is<00:01:05.449> the<00:01:05.689> motion<00:01:05.900> controller

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
movement this is the motion controller

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.749 
movement this is the motion controller
little<00:01:06.859> computer<00:01:07.249> in<00:01:07.340> there<00:01:09.340> and<00:01:10.340> it<00:01:10.729> is

00:01:10.749 --> 00:01:10.759 
little computer in there and it is

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:13.870 
little computer in there and it is
powered<00:01:11.420> by<00:01:11.600> this<00:01:11.659> battery<00:01:12.170> pack<00:01:12.670> cameras<00:01:13.670> set

powered by this battery pack cameras set
up<00:01:14.200> now<00:01:15.200> one<00:01:15.530> important<00:01:15.979> thing<00:01:16.159> is<00:01:17.229> manual

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
up now one important thing is manual

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:21.489 
up now one important thing is manual
exposure<00:01:18.590> and<00:01:19.509> manual<00:01:20.509> white<00:01:20.749> balance<00:01:20.780> on

00:01:21.489 --> 00:01:21.499 
exposure and manual white balance on

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:24.219 
exposure and manual white balance on
time<00:01:21.950> lapses<00:01:22.369> because<00:01:22.609> otherwise<00:01:22.909> the<00:01:23.840> camera

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
time lapses because otherwise the camera

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:25.870 
time lapses because otherwise the camera
is<00:01:24.289> going<00:01:24.380> to<00:01:24.439> make<00:01:24.590> its<00:01:24.770> own<00:01:24.859> decisions<00:01:24.920> and

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
is going to make its own decisions and

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.010 
is going to make its own decisions and
your<00:01:26.119> shots<00:01:26.329> are<00:01:26.450> going<00:01:26.569> to<00:01:26.630> look<00:01:26.749> a<00:01:26.869> little

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
your shots are going to look a little

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.330 
your shots are going to look a little
bit<00:01:27.200> different<00:01:27.560> from<00:01:27.649> one<00:01:27.859> shot<00:01:28.069> to<00:01:28.100> the<00:01:28.249> next

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
bit different from one shot to the next

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:29.950 
bit different from one shot to the next
you<00:01:28.670> want<00:01:28.819> all<00:01:29.030> them<00:01:29.240> to<00:01:29.359> have<00:01:29.450> the<00:01:29.569> same<00:01:29.719> look

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
you want all them to have the same look

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.090 
you want all them to have the same look
so<00:01:30.200> that<00:01:30.319> you<00:01:30.380> can<00:01:30.499> put<00:01:30.649> them<00:01:30.770> all<00:01:30.889> together

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
so that you can put them all together

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.270 
so that you can put them all together
into<00:01:31.399> one<00:01:31.490> smooth<00:01:32.479> video<00:01:33.109> sequence<00:01:33.709> well<00:01:34.219> I'm

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
into one smooth video sequence well I'm

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.819 
into one smooth video sequence well I'm
going<00:01:34.429> to<00:01:34.459> hook<00:01:34.609> this<00:01:34.850> up<00:01:35.119> hook<00:01:35.990> controller<00:01:36.530> up

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:36.829 
going to hook this up hook controller up

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:38.889 
going to hook this up hook controller up
to<00:01:36.950> the<00:01:37.039> camera<00:01:37.310> and<00:01:37.609> then<00:01:37.939> we<00:01:38.030> should<00:01:38.240> should

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:38.899 
to the camera and then we should should

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:40.170 
to the camera and then we should should
be<00:01:39.049> ready

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 
be ready

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:45.630 
be ready
three<00:01:41.110> seconds<00:01:41.710> between<00:01:42.490> shots<00:01:42.730> and<00:01:44.640> I'm

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
three seconds between shots and I'm

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.380 
three seconds between shots and I'm
going<00:01:45.790> to<00:01:45.820> move<00:01:46.110> about<00:01:47.110> 1/10<00:01:47.890> of<00:01:48.070> an<00:01:48.220> inch

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
going to move about 1/10 of an inch

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.650 
going to move about 1/10 of an inch
between<00:01:49.390> each<00:01:49.630> shot<00:01:49.770> up<00:01:50.770> that<00:01:51.010> way<00:01:51.420> other<00:01:52.420> time

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:52.660 
between each shot up that way other time

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.080 
between each shot up that way other time
lapses<00:01:53.140> because<00:01:53.860> when<00:01:54.460> you<00:01:54.580> start<00:01:54.790> a<00:01:54.820> time

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.090 
lapses because when you start a time

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.210 
lapses because when you start a time
lapse<00:01:55.330> you're<00:01:55.960> technically<00:01:56.500> working<00:01:56.830> but

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:57.220 
lapse you're technically working but

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:58.530 
lapse you're technically working but
then<00:01:57.370> you<00:01:57.460> just<00:01:57.640> get<00:01:57.730> a<00:01:57.790> sit<00:01:58.000> back<00:01:58.210> and<00:01:58.450> like

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 
then you just get a sit back and like

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.720 
then you just get a sit back and like
eat<00:01:58.750> lunch<00:01:58.900> or<00:01:59.080> something<00:01:59.410> all<00:01:59.860> right<00:01:59.920> it's

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:00.730 
eat lunch or something all right it's

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:05.610 
eat lunch or something all right it's
going<00:02:02.640> and<00:02:03.640> I<00:02:03.760> just<00:02:03.790> want<00:02:04.060> to<00:02:04.090> make<00:02:04.240> sure<00:02:04.620> that

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:05.620 
going and I just want to make sure that
