00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:06.090 

we're<00:00:04.240> going<00:00:04.390> to<00:00:04.450> talk<00:00:04.600> about<00:00:04.750> explore<00:00:05.649> or<00:00:05.859> how

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:06.100 
we're going to talk about explore or how

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:07.829 
we're going to talk about explore or how
to<00:00:06.160> use<00:00:06.340> the<00:00:06.520> explore<00:00:06.880> and<00:00:07.180> this<00:00:07.330> is<00:00:07.479> a<00:00:07.510> very

00:00:07.829 --> 00:00:07.839 
to use the explore and this is a very

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:09.690 
to use the explore and this is a very
important<00:00:08.350> PE<00:00:08.500> to<00:00:08.770> me<00:00:08.920> because<00:00:09.219> if<00:00:09.340> you<00:00:09.460> don't

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:09.700 
important PE to me because if you don't

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.850 
important PE to me because if you don't
know<00:00:09.850> how<00:00:09.969> to<00:00:10.059> explore<00:00:10.450> you're<00:00:11.200> not<00:00:11.500> going<00:00:11.770> to

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:11.860 
know how to explore you're not going to

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:14.100 
know how to explore you're not going to
be<00:00:11.920> highly<00:00:12.100> successful<00:00:12.400> with<00:00:13.180> anything<00:00:13.780> that

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:14.110 
be highly successful with anything that

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:16.260 
be highly successful with anything that
you<00:00:14.199> do<00:00:14.379> and<00:00:14.889> all<00:00:15.070> instrumentation<00:00:15.910> kind<00:00:16.209> of

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:16.270 
you do and all instrumentation kind of

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:18.210 
you do and all instrumentation kind of
follows<00:00:16.570> after<00:00:16.779> a<00:00:16.960> good<00:00:17.260> exploration

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:18.220 
follows after a good exploration

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.460 
follows after a good exploration
technique<00:00:18.609> so<00:00:18.880> really<00:00:19.270> get<00:00:19.420> this<00:00:19.600> down<00:00:19.840> but

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:20.470 
technique so really get this down but

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.470 
technique so really get this down but
we're<00:00:20.710> gonna<00:00:20.830> have<00:00:20.980> Christy<00:00:21.340> again<00:00:21.640> show<00:00:22.270> us

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:22.480 
we're gonna have Christy again show us

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.540 
we're gonna have Christy again show us
how<00:00:22.900> to<00:00:22.960> identify<00:00:23.350> the<00:00:23.740> correct<00:00:24.010> and<00:00:24.310> o'the

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:24.550 
how to identify the correct and o'the

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.240 
how to identify the correct and o'the
Explorer<00:00:25.170> when<00:00:26.170> you're<00:00:26.680> working<00:00:27.010> on<00:00:27.100> the

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:27.250 
Explorer when you're working on the

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.750 
Explorer when you're working on the
anterior<00:00:27.700> teeth<00:00:28.230> you<00:00:29.230> can<00:00:29.410> see<00:00:29.619> when<00:00:29.980> you<00:00:30.100> hold

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:30.760 
anterior teeth you can see when you hold

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.959 
anterior teeth you can see when you hold
the<00:00:30.940> Explorer<00:00:31.300> flat<00:00:31.720> against<00:00:32.379> the<00:00:32.969> facial

00:00:33.959 --> 00:00:33.969 
the Explorer flat against the facial

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:36.780 
the Explorer flat against the facial
surface<00:00:34.120> you<00:00:34.420> can<00:00:34.570> see<00:00:34.780> that<00:00:35.620> the<00:00:36.370> tip<00:00:36.579> can

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:36.790 
surface you can see that the tip can

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:38.940 
surface you can see that the tip can
almost<00:00:37.000> curves<00:00:37.360> into<00:00:37.870> the<00:00:38.020> tooth<00:00:38.290> whereas<00:00:38.829> if

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:38.950 
almost curves into the tooth whereas if

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:41.479 
almost curves into the tooth whereas if
you<00:00:39.100> hold<00:00:39.340> the<00:00:39.460> opposite<00:00:40.060> or<00:00:40.780> the<00:00:40.810> wrong<00:00:41.140> side

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
you hold the opposite or the wrong side

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.300 
you hold the opposite or the wrong side
it's<00:00:42.489> gonna<00:00:42.670> be<00:00:42.940> a<00:00:43.180> pretty<00:00:43.810> voice<00:00:44.200> over<00:00:44.560> and<00:00:44.890> so

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:45.310 
it's gonna be a pretty voice over and so

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:46.350 
it's gonna be a pretty voice over and so
you<00:00:45.399> don't<00:00:45.489> want<00:00:45.610> that<00:00:45.850> because<00:00:45.970> then<00:00:46.180> it's

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:46.360 
you don't want that because then it's

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:47.790 
you don't want that because then it's
going<00:00:46.540> to<00:00:46.660> welcome

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:47.800 
going to welcome

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.889 
going to welcome
but<00:00:48.460> can<00:00:48.640> I<00:00:48.730> mention<00:00:48.940> one<00:00:49.390> thing<00:00:49.540> that<00:00:49.720> Chris

00:00:49.889 --> 00:00:49.899 
but can I mention one thing that Chris

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:51.960 
but can I mention one thing that Chris
is<00:00:50.050> doing<00:00:50.380> extremely<00:00:50.620> well<00:00:50.950> here<00:00:51.340> go<00:00:51.579> ahead

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:51.970 
is doing extremely well here go ahead

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.510 
is doing extremely well here go ahead
she's<00:00:52.450> starting<00:00:53.020> out<00:00:53.200> when<00:00:53.559> she<00:00:53.800> when<00:00:54.309> she's

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:54.520 
she's starting out when she when she's

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.229 
she's starting out when she when she's
checking<00:00:55.180> her<00:00:55.329> tip<00:00:55.600> with<00:00:56.200> a<00:00:56.530> grasp<00:00:57.309> that<00:00:57.820> keeps

00:00:58.229 --> 00:00:58.239 
checking her tip with a grasp that keeps

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:00.150 
checking her tip with a grasp that keeps
her<00:00:58.420> instrument<00:00:58.780> perpendicular<00:00:59.770> to<00:00:59.800> their

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:00.160 
her instrument perpendicular to their

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.459 
her instrument perpendicular to their
clouseau<00:01:00.430> plane<00:01:00.790> so<00:01:01.660> that's<00:01:01.899> important

00:01:02.459 --> 00:01:02.469 
clouseau plane so that's important

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:04.049 
clouseau plane so that's important
because<00:01:02.530> a<00:01:02.710> lot<00:01:02.800> of<00:01:02.980> students<00:01:03.430> will<00:01:03.670> start<00:01:03.879> out

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
because a lot of students will start out

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:05.969 
because a lot of students will start out
like<00:01:04.239> this<00:01:04.509> this<00:01:04.899> is<00:01:05.079> what<00:01:05.229> I<00:01:05.259> call<00:01:05.500> being<00:01:05.619> flat

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:05.979 
like this this is what I call being flat

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:07.800 
like this this is what I call being flat
on<00:01:06.219> your<00:01:06.369> phone<00:01:06.579> see<00:01:07.240> what<00:01:07.390> that<00:01:07.539> looks<00:01:07.749> like

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
on your phone see what that looks like

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.559 
on your phone see what that looks like
you<00:01:08.499> can<00:01:08.530> almost<00:01:08.859> make<00:01:09.159> the<00:01:09.700> tip<00:01:09.939> work<00:01:10.270> if

00:01:10.559 --> 00:01:10.569 
you can almost make the tip work if

00:01:10.569 --> 00:01:12.719 
you can almost make the tip work if
you're<00:01:10.869> starting<00:01:11.170> now<00:01:11.409> incorrectly<00:01:12.039> so<00:01:12.700> I

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:12.729 
you're starting now incorrectly so I

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:15.029 
you're starting now incorrectly so I
love<00:01:13.090> that<00:01:13.119> she's<00:01:13.600> up<00:01:13.869> up<00:01:14.049> up<00:01:14.229> on<00:01:14.439> her<00:01:14.560> fulcrum

00:01:15.029 --> 00:01:15.039 
love that she's up up up on her fulcrum

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:16.919 
love that she's up up up on her fulcrum
and<00:01:15.249> that<00:01:15.459> the<00:01:15.609> instrument<00:01:16.060> is<00:01:16.179> parallel<00:01:16.899> with

00:01:16.919 --> 00:01:16.929 
and that the instrument is parallel with

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:18.480 
and that the instrument is parallel with
the<00:01:17.139> line<00:01:17.409> you're<00:01:17.619> just<00:01:17.770> gonna<00:01:17.950> come<00:01:18.219> in<00:01:18.249> and

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.490 
the line you're just gonna come in and

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.609 
the line you're just gonna come in and
make<00:01:18.609> sure<00:01:18.819> that<00:01:19.329> you<00:01:19.450> place<00:01:19.659> the<00:01:19.899> tip<00:01:19.929> a<00:01:20.469> few

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:20.619 
make sure that you place the tip a few

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:22.769 
make sure that you place the tip a few
millimeters<00:01:21.159> under<00:01:21.549> so<00:01:22.450> you<00:01:22.509> feel<00:01:22.749> a

00:01:22.769 --> 00:01:22.779 
millimeters under so you feel a

00:01:22.779 --> 00:01:25.019 
millimeters under so you feel a
resistance<00:01:22.990> and<00:01:23.889> then<00:01:24.159> you're<00:01:24.279> gonna<00:01:24.429> wrap

00:01:25.019 --> 00:01:25.029 
resistance and then you're gonna wrap

00:01:25.029 --> 00:01:26.849 
resistance and then you're gonna wrap
that<00:01:25.240> all<00:01:25.359> the<00:01:25.509> way<00:01:25.600> around<00:01:25.899> the<00:01:26.049> tooth<00:01:26.229> you

00:01:26.849 --> 00:01:26.859 
that all the way around the tooth you

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:28.019 
that all the way around the tooth you
know<00:01:26.889> what<00:01:27.069> Krista<00:01:27.399> you've<00:01:27.579> really<00:01:27.909> been

00:01:28.019 --> 00:01:28.029 
know what Krista you've really been

00:01:28.029 --> 00:01:29.849 
know what Krista you've really been
taught<00:01:28.240> well<00:01:28.479> I<00:01:28.779> have<00:01:28.959> not<00:01:29.170> had<00:01:29.469> a<00:01:29.679> lot<00:01:29.829> of

00:01:29.849 --> 00:01:29.859 
taught well I have not had a lot of

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:31.109 
taught well I have not had a lot of
experience<00:01:30.310> of<00:01:30.399> her<00:01:30.520> but<00:01:30.700> she's<00:01:30.909> already

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:31.119 
experience of her but she's already

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:33.749 
experience of her but she's already
astir<00:01:31.889> because<00:01:32.889> what<00:01:33.099> I<00:01:33.130> like<00:01:33.399> that<00:01:33.579> she's

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:33.759 
astir because what I like that she's

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:35.519 
astir because what I like that she's
doing<00:01:33.939> is<00:01:34.209> she<00:01:34.389> is<00:01:34.509> up<00:01:34.719> on<00:01:34.869> her<00:01:34.929> fulcrum<00:01:35.349> but

00:01:35.519 --> 00:01:35.529 
doing is she is up on her fulcrum but

00:01:35.529 --> 00:01:37.769 
doing is she is up on her fulcrum but
also<00:01:35.709> she's<00:01:36.130> leading<00:01:36.369> with<00:01:36.670> that<00:01:36.700> toe<00:01:37.090> because

00:01:37.769 --> 00:01:37.779 
also she's leading with that toe because

00:01:37.779 --> 00:01:39.269 
also she's leading with that toe because
if<00:01:37.899> you're<00:01:38.020> gonna<00:01:38.109> go<00:01:38.289> sub<00:01:38.499> gingival<00:01:38.920> you<00:01:39.069> want

00:01:39.269 --> 00:01:39.279 
if you're gonna go sub gingival you want

00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:40.769 
if you're gonna go sub gingival you want
that<00:01:39.459> toe<00:01:39.700> to<00:01:39.909> be<00:01:40.029> the<00:01:40.149> first<00:01:40.359> thing<00:01:40.539> that's

00:01:40.769 --> 00:01:40.779 
that toe to be the first thing that's

00:01:40.779 --> 00:01:42.330 
that toe to be the first thing that's
the<00:01:41.259> answer<00:01:41.469> is<00:01:41.709> I'd<00:01:41.889> like<00:01:42.039> great<00:01:42.219> you're

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:42.340 
the answer is I'd like great you're

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.120 
the answer is I'd like great you're
doing<00:01:42.369> before<00:01:42.990> I<00:01:43.990> think<00:01:44.499> it<00:01:44.709> needs<00:01:44.859> to<00:01:44.920> be<00:01:45.009> the

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
doing before I think it needs to be the

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:46.529 
doing before I think it needs to be the
first<00:01:45.310> thing<00:01:45.520> that<00:01:45.549> enters<00:01:45.939> the<00:01:46.090> gingiva<00:01:46.479> and

00:01:46.529 --> 00:01:46.539 
first thing that enters the gingiva and

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:48.599 
first thing that enters the gingiva and
the<00:01:46.719> last<00:01:46.959> thing<00:01:47.289> out<00:01:47.590> so<00:01:48.099> what<00:01:48.249> Kristi's

00:01:48.599 --> 00:01:48.609 
the last thing out so what Kristi's

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:51.209 
the last thing out so what Kristi's
doing<00:01:48.909> well<00:01:49.149> is<00:01:49.539> she's<00:01:49.959> not<00:01:50.169> rocking<00:01:50.590> this<00:01:51.009> to

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:51.219 
doing well is she's not rocking this to

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:54.719 
doing well is she's not rocking this to
it<00:01:51.310> like<00:01:51.490> this<00:01:52.469> it's<00:01:53.469> weird<00:01:53.770> the<00:01:54.099> toe<00:01:54.279> goes<00:01:54.520> in

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:54.729 
it like this it's weird the toe goes in

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:56.459 
it like this it's weird the toe goes in
first<00:01:54.969> but<00:01:55.329> then<00:01:55.509> it's<00:01:55.689> the<00:01:55.779> first<00:01:56.020> thing<00:01:56.229> out

00:01:56.459 --> 00:01:56.469 
first but then it's the first thing out

00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:58.199 
first but then it's the first thing out
and<00:01:56.979> I<00:01:57.099> don't<00:01:57.189> know<00:01:57.399> if<00:01:57.490> you<00:01:57.579> can<00:01:57.729> even<00:01:57.819> see<00:01:57.939> is

00:01:58.199 --> 00:01:58.209 
and I don't know if you can even see is

00:01:58.209 --> 00:02:00.599 
and I don't know if you can even see is
my<00:01:58.359> hand<00:01:58.569> in<00:01:58.719> the<00:01:58.810> way<00:01:59.039> but<00:02:00.039> yeah<00:02:00.219> you<00:02:00.279> want<00:02:00.549> to

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:00.609 
my hand in the way but yeah you want to

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:02.639 
my hand in the way but yeah you want to
lead<00:02:00.819> in<00:02:01.060> and<00:02:01.389> then<00:02:01.569> and<00:02:01.899> then<00:02:02.079> come<00:02:02.289> out<00:02:02.319> like

00:02:02.639 --> 00:02:02.649 
lead in and then and then come out like

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:04.319 
lead in and then and then come out like
this<00:02:02.889> which<00:02:03.099> is<00:02:03.130> exactly<00:02:03.369> what<00:02:03.789> she's<00:02:03.969> doing

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:04.329 
this which is exactly what she's doing

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:06.209 
this which is exactly what she's doing
a<00:02:04.479> lot<00:02:04.929> of<00:02:04.959> students<00:02:05.439> get<00:02:05.590> around<00:02:05.859> to<00:02:06.099> the

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:06.219 
a lot of students get around to the

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:08.529 
a lot of students get around to the
interproximal<00:02:06.549> and<00:02:07.090> then<00:02:07.239> they<00:02:07.419> go<00:02:07.539> like<00:02:07.689> this

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
interproximal and then they go like this

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.649 
interproximal and then they go like this
which<00:02:09.500> seems<00:02:09.769> weird<00:02:10.090> because<00:02:11.090> you're<00:02:11.360> doing

00:02:11.649 --> 00:02:11.659 
which seems weird because you're doing

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:13.509 
which seems weird because you're doing
it<00:02:11.780> so<00:02:11.930> nicely<00:02:12.140> but<00:02:12.530> I<00:02:12.739> am<00:02:12.890> I<00:02:13.040> can't<00:02:13.280> tell<00:02:13.459> you

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:13.519 
it so nicely but I am I can't tell you

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:15.970 
it so nicely but I am I can't tell you
how<00:02:13.640> many<00:02:13.700> people<00:02:13.879> write<00:02:14.720> the<00:02:14.959> instrument<00:02:15.440> so

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
how many people write the instrument so

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.619 
how many people write the instrument so
I<00:02:16.010> love<00:02:16.280> that<00:02:16.459> she's<00:02:16.640> doing<00:02:16.940> it<00:02:17.060> that<00:02:17.209> way

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:17.629 
I love that she's doing it that way

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:19.960 
I love that she's doing it that way
show<00:02:18.409> us<00:02:18.560> then<00:02:18.830> how<00:02:19.129> you<00:02:19.190> would<00:02:19.400> determine<00:02:19.549> for

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
show us then how you would determine for

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.030 
show us then how you would determine for
the<00:02:20.030> posterior<00:02:20.390> here<00:02:20.690> when<00:02:21.680> you<00:02:21.799> want<00:02:21.950> to

the posterior here when you want to

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.009 
the posterior here when you want to
check<00:02:22.220> in<00:02:22.430> for<00:02:22.670> the<00:02:22.730> dislike<00:02:23.420> going<00:02:23.750> up<00:02:23.870> with

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:29.599 
want to make sure that it's

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:32.229 
want to make sure that it's
perpendicular<00:02:30.290> with<00:02:31.160> the<00:02:31.340> tooth<00:02:31.580> what's<00:02:31.970> it

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
perpendicular with the tooth what's it

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:34.960 
perpendicular with the tooth what's it
the<00:02:32.989> terminals<00:02:33.379> change<00:02:33.709> so<00:02:34.549> you<00:02:34.610> want<00:02:34.819> to<00:02:34.879> make

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
the terminals change so you want to make

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.490 
the terminals change so you want to make
sure<00:02:35.000> like<00:02:35.209> with<00:02:35.599> this<00:02:35.810> one<00:02:36.049> you<00:02:36.140> can<00:02:36.200> kinda

sure like with this one you can kinda
see<00:02:36.680> that<00:02:36.829> it's<00:02:36.980> bending<00:02:37.599> around<00:02:38.599> sorry<00:02:39.409> cuz<00:02:39.739> I

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:39.829

see that it's bending around sorry cuz I
can't<00:02:40.099> see<00:02:40.280> so<00:02:40.790> at<00:02:40.940> this<00:02:41.090> one<00:02:41.360> it<00:02:41.959> just<00:02:42.049> stays

can't see so at this one it just stays

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.530 
can't see so at this one it just stays
completely<00:02:43.280> perpendicular<00:02:44.090> which<00:02:44.239> is<00:02:44.390> what

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
completely perpendicular which is what

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.839 
completely perpendicular which is what
you're<00:02:44.690> leaning<00:02:45.379> from<00:02:45.590> here<00:02:45.890> to<00:02:46.010> here<00:02:46.160> yes

terminal shape so you start oh and look

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:57.670 
terminal shape so you start oh and look
again<00:02:50.120> she's<00:02:50.359> leaning<00:02:50.540> with<00:02:50.750> the<00:02:50.900> toe<00:02:56.680> and

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
just a tiny bit of the toe and then

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.460 
just a tiny bit of the toe and then
she's<00:03:00.109> turning<00:03:00.530> turning<00:03:00.739> turning<00:03:00.920> to<00:03:01.640> come

she's turning turning turning to come
anterior<00:03:03.609> to<00:03:04.609> the<00:03:05.829> anterior<00:03:06.829> part<00:03:07.069> of<00:03:07.190> the

anterior to the anterior part of the
tooth<00:03:07.519> hmm

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:08.329 
tooth hmm

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:10.660 
tooth hmm
light<00:03:08.660> pressure<00:03:08.959> again<00:03:09.920> go<00:03:10.220> ahead<00:03:10.430> and<00:03:10.579> do

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
light pressure again go ahead and do

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.789 
light pressure again go ahead and do
your<00:03:10.879> exploratory<00:03:11.239> stroke<00:03:11.690> again<00:03:12.019> we<00:03:12.530> want<00:03:12.709> to

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:12.799 
your exploratory stroke again we want to

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:14.440 
your exploratory stroke again we want to
make<00:03:13.040> sure<00:03:13.069> that<00:03:13.459> we<00:03:13.639> could<00:03:13.910> remove<00:03:14.299> the

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
make sure that we could remove the

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:15.759 
make sure that we could remove the
instrument<00:03:14.900> from<00:03:15.019> her<00:03:15.230> grasp

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:15.769 
instrument from her grasp

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:17.620 
instrument from her grasp
while<00:03:16.010> she<00:03:16.190> was<00:03:16.250> doing<00:03:16.400> that<00:03:16.730> it<00:03:17.180> needs<00:03:17.389> to<00:03:17.510> be

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
while she was doing that it needs to be

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.750 
while she was doing that it needs to be
that<00:03:17.810> light<00:03:18.139> and<00:03:18.470> she's<00:03:19.099> keeping<00:03:19.459> her<00:03:19.549> toe

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
that light and she's keeping her toe

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:25.389 
that light and she's keeping her toe
down<00:03:19.970> and<00:03:20.030> gently<00:03:20.750> walking<00:03:22.090> very<00:03:23.090> nice
