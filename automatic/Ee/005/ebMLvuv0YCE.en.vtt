what a beautiful piece of spalted maple

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.819 
what a beautiful piece of spalted maple
crotch<00:00:12.719> I've<00:00:13.049> got<00:00:13.259> a<00:00:13.500> lathe<00:00:14.009> here<00:00:14.339> until<00:00:15.829> we

00:00:16.819 --> 00:00:16.829 
crotch I've got a lathe here until we

00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:19.130 
crotch I've got a lathe here until we
get<00:00:16.980> right<00:00:17.220> there<00:00:17.520> now<00:00:17.970> one<00:00:18.689> of<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:18.900> things

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
get right there now one of the things

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.870 
get right there now one of the things
that<00:00:19.349> makes<00:00:19.529> spalting<00:00:20.099> happen<00:00:20.520> is<00:00:20.699> that

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
that makes spalting happen is that

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.409 
that makes spalting happen is that
material<00:00:21.539> sits<00:00:21.750> on<00:00:21.989> the<00:00:22.140> ground<00:00:22.349> gets<00:00:23.070> wet

00:00:23.409 --> 00:00:23.419 
material sits on the ground gets wet

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:25.490 
material sits on the ground gets wet
Spalding<00:00:24.419> is<00:00:24.540> actually<00:00:24.899> a<00:00:24.930> fungus<00:00:25.320> that

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
Spalding is actually a fungus that

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.339 
Spalding is actually a fungus that
starts<00:00:25.919> growing<00:00:26.189> into<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:26.489> wood<00:00:26.759> so<00:00:27.090> this<00:00:28.020> can

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
starts growing into the wood so this can

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.109 
starts growing into the wood so this can
be<00:00:28.500> a<00:00:28.529> byproduct<00:00:29.009> of<00:00:29.340> that<00:00:29.489> which<00:00:29.669> is<00:00:29.879> what

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
be a byproduct of that which is what

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.970 
be a byproduct of that which is what
gets<00:00:30.360> wet<00:00:30.599> and<00:00:30.629> it<00:00:30.809> starts<00:00:31.169> to<00:00:31.320> rot<00:00:31.500> or<00:00:31.829> get

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
gets wet and it starts to rot or get

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.490 
gets wet and it starts to rot or get
punky<00:00:32.399> like<00:00:32.789> this<00:00:33.000> don't<00:00:33.719> despair

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
punky like this don't despair

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.810 
punky like this don't despair
we<00:00:34.800> don't<00:00:34.920> want<00:00:35.039> to<00:00:35.129> throw<00:00:35.219> the<00:00:35.370> baby<00:00:35.550> out<00:00:35.670> with

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
we don't want to throw the baby out with

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.819 
we don't want to throw the baby out with
the<00:00:35.940> bathwater<00:00:36.210> here<00:00:36.840> and<00:00:36.989> get<00:00:37.469> rid<00:00:37.620> of<00:00:37.680> this

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
the bathwater here and get rid of this

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.250

beautiful<00:00:38.309> Bowl<00:00:38.489> blank<00:00:38.789> only<00:00:39.360> because<00:00:39.750> we

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
beautiful Bowl blank only because we

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.590 
beautiful Bowl blank only because we
have<00:00:40.410> that<00:00:40.620> bad<00:00:40.829> spot<00:00:41.190> so<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:42.000> answer<00:00:42.360> to<00:00:42.390> this

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
have that bad spot so the answer to this

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.950 
have that bad spot so the answer to this
is<00:00:42.870> ca<00:00:43.200> gloop<00:00:43.650> cyanoacrylate<00:00:44.390> what<00:00:45.390> we<00:00:45.510> can<00:00:45.720> do

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
is ca gloop cyanoacrylate what we can do

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.430 
is ca gloop cyanoacrylate what we can do
with<00:00:46.140> this<00:00:46.440> is<00:00:47.510> support<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.720> spot

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
with this is support the spot

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.770 
with this is support the spot
fill<00:00:50.010> it<00:00:50.190> in<00:00:50.340> build<00:00:50.820> it<00:00:50.940> up<00:00:51.030> a<00:00:51.180> little<00:00:51.270> bit<00:00:51.540> and

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
fill it in build it up a little bit and

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.710 
fill it in build it up a little bit and
with<00:00:52.410> that<00:00:52.770> we're<00:00:53.579> gonna<00:00:53.640> stabilize<00:00:54.090> the

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:54.720 
with that we're gonna stabilize the

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.810 
with that we're gonna stabilize the
turning<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.710> be<00:00:55.890> able<00:00:55.980> to<00:00:56.100> finish<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.670> bowl

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
turning and be able to finish the bowl

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:59.299 
turning and be able to finish the bowl
so<00:00:57.149> I'm<00:00:57.809> just<00:00:57.989> gonna<00:00:58.110> let<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.530> glue<00:00:58.770> flow<00:00:59.160> I'm

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
so I'm just gonna let the glue flow I'm

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.590 
so I'm just gonna let the glue flow I'm
using<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.670> medium<00:01:00.210> viscosity<00:01:02.329> thin<00:01:03.329> enough

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
using a medium viscosity thin enough

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.730 
using a medium viscosity thin enough
that<00:01:03.630> it'll<00:01:03.989> flow<00:01:04.890> down<00:01:05.159> into<00:01:05.460> any<00:01:05.610> voids

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:06.740 
that it'll flow down into any voids

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.080 
that it'll flow down into any voids
thick<00:01:07.740> enough<00:01:08.009> that<00:01:08.280> it's<00:01:08.430> not<00:01:08.610> running<00:01:09.060> like

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
thick enough that it's not running like

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:17.989 
thick enough that it's not running like
water<00:01:09.570> off<00:01:10.500> of<00:01:10.560> the<00:01:10.829> turning<00:01:16.729> now<00:01:17.729> this<00:01:17.880> is

00:01:17.989 --> 00:01:17.999 
water off of the turning now this is

00:01:17.999 --> 00:01:19.489 
water off of the turning now this is
going<00:01:18.149> to<00:01:18.209> take<00:01:18.359> a<00:01:18.389> couple<00:01:18.659> applications<00:01:19.409> so

00:01:19.489 --> 00:01:19.499 
going to take a couple applications so

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:21.739 
going to take a couple applications so
I'm<00:01:19.590> going<00:01:19.740> to<00:01:19.799> put<00:01:19.979> this<00:01:20.159> layer<00:01:20.459> on<00:01:20.759> give<00:01:21.719> that

00:01:21.739 --> 00:01:21.749 
I'm going to put this layer on give that

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:24.499 
I'm going to put this layer on give that
the<00:01:22.079> opportunity<00:01:22.709> to<00:01:22.829> dry<00:01:23.100> come<00:01:23.939> back<00:01:24.179> to

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
the opportunity to dry come back to

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.749 
the opportunity to dry come back to
another<00:01:24.749> layer<00:01:25.020> another<00:01:25.409> layer<00:01:25.829> until<00:01:26.579> I've

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
another layer another layer until I've

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.580 
another layer another layer until I've
got<00:01:26.999> these<00:01:27.209> voids<00:01:27.569> filled<00:01:27.929> that<00:01:28.319> area

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
got these voids filled that area

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.800 
got these voids filled that area
stabilized<00:01:29.130> that'll<00:01:29.729> prevent<00:01:29.999> the<00:01:30.179> bowl<00:01:30.450> from

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
stabilized that'll prevent the bowl from

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.539 
stabilized that'll prevent the bowl from
blowing<00:01:31.049> up<00:01:31.350> when<00:01:31.709> I<00:01:31.740> start<00:01:32.069> working<00:01:32.249> on<00:01:32.429> it

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
blowing up when I start working on it

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.650 
blowing up when I start working on it
again

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:35.660 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.540 

I've<00:01:36.660> got<00:01:36.930> our<00:01:37.080> bull<00:01:37.350> completely<00:01:38.250> turned

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:38.550 
I've got our bull completely turned

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:40.730 
I've got our bull completely turned
flipped<00:01:39.030> around<00:01:39.240> finished<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.200> bottom<00:01:40.590> off

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
flipped around finished the bottom off

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.100 
flipped around finished the bottom off
here<00:01:41.130> just<00:01:41.790> doing<00:01:41.940> a<00:01:42.090> little<00:01:42.180> polish<00:01:42.720> on<00:01:42.930> the

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
here just doing a little polish on the

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.320 
here just doing a little polish on the
finish<00:01:45.890> now<00:01:46.890> let's<00:01:47.070> rotate<00:01:47.340> around<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:48.060> where

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:48.330 
finish now let's rotate around to where

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.200 
finish now let's rotate around to where
the<00:01:48.479> bad<00:01:48.630> spot<00:01:48.960> was<00:01:49.170> that's<00:01:49.380> it<00:01:49.620> right<00:01:49.890> there

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
the bad spot was that's it right there

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:51.560 
the bad spot was that's it right there
now

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
now

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.719 
now
one<00:01:51.780> of<00:01:51.900> the<00:01:51.960> things<00:01:52.200> that's<00:01:52.350> cool<00:01:52.710> is<00:01:53.400> that

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
one of the things that's cool is that

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.630 
one of the things that's cool is that
the<00:01:54.240> glue<00:01:54.510> really<00:01:54.780> just<00:01:55.140> adds<00:01:55.410> a<00:01:55.590> little<00:01:55.740> dark

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
the glue really just adds a little dark

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.000 
the glue really just adds a little dark
to<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.270> bowl<00:01:57.630> well<00:01:58.200> there's<00:01:58.380> dark<00:01:58.680> in<00:01:58.860> there

00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.010 
to the bowl well there's dark in there

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.880 
to the bowl well there's dark in there
already<00:01:59.400> so<00:02:00.060> doesn't<00:02:00.750> cost<00:02:01.080> us<00:02:01.290> a<00:02:01.440> thing<00:02:01.650> as

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
already so doesn't cost us a thing as

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.590 
already so doesn't cost us a thing as
far<00:02:02.070> as<00:02:02.190> any<00:02:02.310> kind<00:02:02.490> of<00:02:02.610> a<00:02:02.700> compromise<00:02:03.180> on<00:02:03.300> the

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
far as any kind of a compromise on the

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.740 
far as any kind of a compromise on the
bowl<00:02:03.810> now<00:02:04.020> what<00:02:04.590> I<00:02:04.619> want<00:02:04.920> to<00:02:05.070> do<00:02:05.190> is<00:02:05.479> get<00:02:06.479> it<00:02:06.600> off

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
bowl now what I want to do is get it off

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.810 
bowl now what I want to do is get it off
of<00:02:06.900> this<00:02:06.990> mounting<00:02:07.470> system<00:02:07.920> so<00:02:08.399> you<00:02:08.459> can<00:02:08.550> have

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:08.820 
of this mounting system so you can have

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:10.460 
of this mounting system so you can have
a<00:02:08.850> look<00:02:09.090> at<00:02:09.209> the<00:02:09.300> entire<00:02:09.570> finished<00:02:10.050> product

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470
