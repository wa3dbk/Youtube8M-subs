00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
because they're not that fast they're

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.170 
because they're not that fast they're
not<00:01:33.509> very<00:01:33.659> strong<00:01:33.990> on<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.229> ball<00:01:34.939> I'd<00:01:35.939> say

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
not very strong on the ball I'd say

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.730 
not very strong on the ball I'd say
they're<00:01:36.329> both<00:01:36.479> decent<00:01:36.930> at<00:01:36.990> skill<00:01:37.259> moves<00:01:37.470> i

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
they're both decent at skill moves i

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.770 
they're both decent at skill moves i
guess<00:01:37.979> but<00:01:38.220> they're<00:01:38.369> not<00:01:38.490> very<00:01:38.670> strong<00:01:39.030> so

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
guess but they're not very strong so

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.330 
guess but they're not very strong so
just<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.079> lot<00:01:40.290> of<00:01:40.409> problems<00:01:40.829> there<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.280> they

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
just a lot of problems there and they

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.010 
just a lot of problems there and they
just<00:01:41.460> don't<00:01:41.670> get<00:01:41.729> forward<00:01:42.180> as<00:01:42.329> well<00:01:42.689> as<00:01:42.869> i

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
just don't get forward as well as i

consistent for me even though they gave

consistent for me even though they gave
him<00:03:17.180> a<00:03:17.269> really<00:03:17.450> powerful<00:03:17.630> shot<00:03:18.200> I<00:03:18.470> hope<00:03:19.370> you

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
done this so far in the in a series

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:30.400 
done this so far in the in a series
they're<00:03:29.209> not<00:03:29.389> a<00:03:29.420> tier<00:03:29.690> 3<00:03:29.720> squad<00:03:30.139> they're<00:03:30.290> going

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
they're not a tier 3 squad they're going

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.949 
they're not a tier 3 squad they're going
to<00:03:30.470> be<00:03:30.530> a<00:03:30.560> tier<00:03:30.739> 4<00:03:31.130> squad<00:03:31.489> now<00:03:31.730> and<00:03:32.030> that's<00:03:32.840> just

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:32.959 
to be a tier 4 squad now and that's just

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:34.509 
to be a tier 4 squad now and that's just
because<00:03:33.170> I<00:03:33.620> don't<00:03:34.040> think<00:03:34.190> they're<00:03:34.370> for

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:34.519 
because I don't think they're for

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:36.580
