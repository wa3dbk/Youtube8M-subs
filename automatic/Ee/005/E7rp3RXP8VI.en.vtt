00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 hello welcome in this new video les 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.280
 I will teach how it can be done 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.800
 perfect drawing with compositions 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.809
 precise we are going to create an effect of 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.059
 embarking that is called star effect 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.699
 it is perfect among them a bacanerÃ­a 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.070
 so follow my steps first let 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.080
 take a yellow color 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.470
 yellow 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:28.110
 and what we are going to do is a star 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:30.950
 a triangle out there and then we will 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:33.500
 do what is this part 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:36.340
 what we are going to do is 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.340
 place there 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:44.310
 then we will create more more creation 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.620
 so 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:49.500
 what we are going to do is go to the 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.020
 Then look how you can see 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.710
 drawings then for me we are not going to 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:58.350
 apply people and this is to modify a 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:06.350
 color for exported to the area 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:06.350
 are to apply them there and there 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:14.510
 [Music] 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:14.510
 and is that the star 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:21.509
 sixth would be being answered 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.509
 [Music] 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.509
 but 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.740
 it will end 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:39.600
 and well I hope once I've done this 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.840
 We are going to put a text of any 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.840
 colour 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.530
 and we are going to put him for example to give me 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:02:07.190
 as the most effective ones out there how 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:09.530
 will apply and then we can also 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.970
 apply nothing else but have 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.970
 personally it is a star 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.660
 a star 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:23.240
 then we can also apply for you 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.240
 example other effects like wing co 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:29.030
 how can we explain for example a 

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:30.860
 letter 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:35.380
 or 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.380
 but different 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.860
 my life 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:48.630
 and learn we will apply if 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:53.390
 then he says pm and the name you and alex 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:53.390
 and we put a sex that is hd 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.340
 h 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.460
 and then use apply the student on 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:06.540
 photoshop 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:06.540
 we try to apply the same 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:17.000
 and look and see how the drawing looked 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:21.640
 of h tutorials so you can create 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.640
