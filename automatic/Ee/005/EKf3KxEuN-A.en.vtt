00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
game the pieces the cards here's the

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.130 
game the pieces the cards here's the
tray<00:02:02.219> they<00:02:02.399> were<00:02:02.549> talking<00:02:02.820> about<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.509> here's

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
tray they were talking about and here's

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.969 
tray they were talking about and here's
the<00:02:04.320> blocks<00:02:04.590> see

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
the blocks see

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:08.820 
the blocks see
so<00:02:06.880> there's<00:02:07.090> the<00:02:07.240> five<00:02:07.420> colors<00:02:07.899> looks<00:02:08.530> like<00:02:08.709> we

got red blue green yellow and just a
natural<00:02:13.300> block<00:02:19.530> well<00:02:20.530> if<00:02:20.650> you<00:02:20.739> love<00:02:20.860> building

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
natural block well if you love building

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.580 
natural block well if you love building
then<00:02:21.610> you'll<00:02:22.090> love<00:02:22.269> this<00:02:22.450> kind<00:02:22.720> of<00:02:22.810> game<00:02:22.989> let

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
me show you some of the cards so as they

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:34.470 
me show you some of the cards so as they
said<00:02:29.950> now<00:02:32.310> you're<00:02:33.310> actually<00:02:33.760> competing<00:02:34.150> to

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:34.480 
said now you're actually competing to

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:36.210 
said now you're actually competing to
build<00:02:34.720> now<00:02:35.500> it<00:02:35.590> looks<00:02:35.769> like<00:02:35.830> there's<00:02:36.069> no

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
build now it looks like there's no

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.160 
build now it looks like there's no
necessary<00:02:36.430> color<00:02:37.000> variations<00:02:37.780> on<00:02:37.959> these

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
necessary color variations on these

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.550 
necessary color variations on these
let's<00:02:39.069> check<00:02:39.340> this<00:02:39.519> side<00:02:40.260> looks<00:02:41.260> like<00:02:41.319> our

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
let's check this side looks like our

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:43.289 
let's check this side looks like our
carts<00:02:41.920> are<00:02:42.069> a<00:02:42.099> little<00:02:42.400> messed<00:02:42.670> up<00:02:42.880> there's<00:02:43.150> the

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:43.299 
carts are a little messed up there's the

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:49.319 
carts are a little messed up there's the
red<00:02:43.450> side<00:02:43.720> card<00:02:44.049> and<00:02:44.349> then<00:02:45.010> this<00:02:45.640> side<00:02:46.769> see<00:02:48.329> the

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:49.329 
red side card and then this side see the

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:51.330 
red side card and then this side see the
little<00:02:49.569> builders<00:02:49.870> there<00:02:50.079> now<00:02:50.799> all<00:02:50.980> the<00:02:51.099> blocks

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
little builders there now all the blocks

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:52.650 
little builders there now all the blocks
are<00:02:51.519> the<00:02:51.610> same<00:02:51.849> size<00:02:52.180> so<00:02:52.420> you're<00:02:52.540> not

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
are the same size so you're not

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.660 
are the same size so you're not
competing<00:02:53.200> with<00:02:53.230> you<00:02:53.650> know<00:02:53.980> odd<00:02:54.220> shaped

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
competing with you know odd shaped

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.539 
competing with you know odd shaped
blocks<00:02:55.000> or<00:02:55.239> anything<00:02:55.390> like<00:02:55.630> that<00:02:55.690> so<00:02:56.250> I<00:02:57.250> guess

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:57.549 
blocks or anything like that so I guess

00:02:57.549 --> 00:02:58.860 
blocks or anything like that so I guess
for<00:02:57.700> little<00:02:57.940> ones<00:02:58.090> it<00:02:58.239> is<00:02:58.269> easier<00:02:58.750> because

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
for little ones it is easier because

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.059 
for little ones it is easier because
let's<00:02:59.290> just<00:02:59.500> say<00:02:59.680> they<00:03:00.400> have<00:03:00.640> to<00:03:00.790> build<00:03:00.940> this

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
let's just say they have to build this

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:04.380 
let's just say they have to build this
so<00:03:03.069> they're<00:03:03.220> going<00:03:03.310> to<00:03:03.370> put<00:03:03.579> this<00:03:03.760> in<00:03:04.120> their

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
so they're going to put this in their

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.770 
so they're going to put this in their
towel<00:03:04.690> and<00:03:05.019> their<00:03:05.200> card<00:03:05.590> holder<00:03:05.890> like<00:03:06.040> that

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
towel and their card holder like that

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.870 
towel and their card holder like that
sorry<00:03:07.780> for<00:03:07.989> the<00:03:08.049> fire<00:03:08.260> and<00:03:08.470> there<00:03:09.400> was<00:03:09.489> two<00:03:09.730> on

the bottom one on the side to standing
up<00:03:19.200> then<00:03:20.200> one<00:03:20.530> on<00:03:20.680> top<00:03:22.290> okay<00:03:24.450> see

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.330 

let's<00:03:28.980> look<00:03:29.159> at<00:03:29.340> another<00:03:29.459> one<00:03:29.760> so<00:03:30.120> this<00:03:30.239> is<00:03:30.300> a

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
let's look at another one so this is a

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.820 
let's look at another one so this is a
triple<00:03:32.340> stack<00:03:33.260> here<00:03:34.260> let<00:03:34.409> me<00:03:34.440> show<00:03:34.530> you<00:03:34.680> the

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
triple stack here let me show you the

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:39.199 
triple stack here let me show you the
blocks<00:03:35.040> there<00:03:35.340> would<00:03:37.670> they're<00:03:38.670> not<00:03:38.819> too<00:03:39.000> big

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
blocks there would they're not too big

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.690 
blocks there would they're not too big
they're<00:03:39.390> about<00:03:39.540> two<00:03:39.750> inches<00:03:40.049> tall<00:03:40.349> so<00:03:40.700> it's

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
they're about two inches tall so it's

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.240 
they're about two inches tall so it's
three<00:03:42.000> on<00:03:42.150> the<00:03:42.299> bottom<00:03:42.420> and<00:03:42.870> then<00:03:43.830> one<00:03:44.069> in<00:03:44.220> the

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
three on the bottom and then one in the

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.300 
three on the bottom and then one in the
middle<00:03:44.580> and<00:03:45.650> two<00:03:46.650> so<00:03:46.890> you've<00:03:47.010> got<00:03:47.129> a<00:03:47.160> little

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
middle and two so you've got a little

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:48.500 
middle and two so you've got a little
Tower<00:03:47.610> there<00:03:47.879> so<00:03:48.030> that's<00:03:48.239> what<00:03:48.299> you're

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
Tower there so that's what you're

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.809 
Tower there so that's what you're
building<00:03:48.950> get<00:03:49.950> it<00:03:50.129> I<00:03:50.840> think<00:03:51.840> you<00:03:51.959> do<00:03:52.489> I'm<00:03:53.489> sure

00:03:53.809 --> 00:03:53.819 
building get it I think you do I'm sure

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:54.949 
building get it I think you do I'm sure
it's<00:03:53.970> some<00:03:54.090> of<00:03:54.180> them<00:03:54.299> are<00:03:54.420> harder<00:03:54.720> than<00:03:54.840> others

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
it's some of them are harder than others

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:56.800 
it's some of them are harder than others
let's<00:03:55.620> look<00:03:55.829> at<00:03:55.950> one<00:03:56.099> more

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:56.810 
let's look at one more
