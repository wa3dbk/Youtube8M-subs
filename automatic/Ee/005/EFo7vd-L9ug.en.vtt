00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:02.820 
hello this is West from Bad Seed games

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:03.980 
hello this is West from Bad Seed games
and<00:00:03.060> today<00:00:03.240> we're<00:00:03.389> going<00:00:03.480> to<00:00:03.570> be<00:00:03.629> going<00:00:03.810> over

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:03.990 
and today we're going to be going over

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.769 
and today we're going to be going over
the<00:00:04.319> setting<00:00:04.680> of<00:00:04.740> a<00:00:05.339> condition<00:00:05.819> manager<00:00:06.450> for<00:00:06.750> a

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
the setting of a condition manager for a

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.190 
the setting of a condition manager for a
basic<00:00:07.230> AI<00:00:07.440> system<00:00:08.150> this<00:00:09.150> system<00:00:09.690> will<00:00:09.840> be<00:00:09.960> set

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
basic AI system this system will be set

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.100 
basic AI system this system will be set
up<00:00:10.230> to<00:00:10.349> handle<00:00:10.590> three<00:00:11.070> states<00:00:11.730> first<00:00:12.690> will<00:00:13.019> be

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
up to handle three states first will be

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.530 
up to handle three states first will be
a<00:00:13.139> line-of-sight<00:00:13.740> second<00:00:14.670> will<00:00:14.790> be<00:00:14.910> proximity

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
a line-of-sight second will be proximity

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.200 
a line-of-sight second will be proximity
and<00:00:15.719> third<00:00:16.470> will<00:00:16.680> be<00:00:16.770> a<00:00:16.800> cone<00:00:17.070> of<00:00:17.220> vision<00:00:17.250> so

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
and third will be a cone of vision so

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.510 
and third will be a cone of vision so
let's<00:00:18.390> get<00:00:18.510> started<00:00:18.779> right<00:00:19.100> now<00:00:20.100> in<00:00:20.279> this

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
let's get started right now in this

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.060 
let's get started right now in this
scene<00:00:20.789> I've<00:00:20.970> got<00:00:21.150> the<00:00:21.330> base<00:00:21.539> setup<00:00:22.050> as<00:00:22.260> well<00:00:22.769> as

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
scene I've got the base setup as well as

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.099 
scene I've got the base setup as well as
two<00:00:23.279> walls<00:00:23.580> that<00:00:23.730> will<00:00:23.939> be<00:00:24.119> used<00:00:24.359> later<00:00:24.750> in<00:00:25.019> the

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
two walls that will be used later in the

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.290 
two walls that will be used later in the
tutorial<00:00:25.890> but<00:00:26.400> for<00:00:26.609> now<00:00:26.730> we're<00:00:26.910> not<00:00:26.939> going<00:00:27.269> to

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
tutorial but for now we're not going to

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.880 
tutorial but for now we're not going to
need<00:00:27.480> them<00:00:27.599> so<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.199> first<00:00:28.439> thing<00:00:28.619> we<00:00:28.740> need<00:00:28.859> to

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
need them so the first thing we need to

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.600 
need them so the first thing we need to
do<00:00:29.070> is<00:00:29.160> we<00:00:29.279> need<00:00:29.429> to<00:00:29.580> set<00:00:29.789> up<00:00:30.060> the<00:00:30.269> two<00:00:31.399> the<00:00:32.399> two

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
do is we need to set up the two the two

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.490 
do is we need to set up the two the two
objects<00:00:33.059> that<00:00:33.180> are<00:00:33.329> going<00:00:33.480> to<00:00:33.630> be<00:00:33.719> interacting

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
objects that are going to be interacting

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.470 
objects that are going to be interacting
with<00:00:34.620> each<00:00:34.680> other<00:00:34.980> now<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:35.730> first<00:00:35.940> object<00:00:36.390> is

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
with each other now the first object is

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.209 
with each other now the first object is
going<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:36.750> be<00:00:36.840> a<00:00:36.960> cube<00:00:37.260> so<00:00:37.800> let's<00:00:37.980> create

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
going to be a cube so let's create

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.950 
going to be a cube so let's create
another<00:00:38.840> cube<00:00:40.399> let's<00:00:41.399> scale<00:00:42.329> it<00:00:42.360> up<00:00:42.600> and

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
another cube let's scale it up and

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:52.639 
another cube let's scale it up and
position<00:00:43.770> it<00:00:44.190> just<00:00:44.610> so<00:00:45.030> and<00:00:51.350> I'm<00:00:52.350> going<00:00:52.620> to

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
position it just so and I'm going to

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.200 
position it just so and I'm going to
color<00:00:52.949> this<00:00:53.250> red<00:00:54.649> just<00:00:55.649> for<00:00:55.920> ease<00:00:56.190> of<00:00:56.219> making

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
color this red just for ease of making

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.360 
color this red just for ease of making
sure<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.420> see<00:00:57.600> it<00:00:57.690> easily<00:00:57.930> so<00:00:58.440> let's<00:00:59.010> call<00:00:59.219> it

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
sure to see it easily so let's call it

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.009 
sure to see it easily so let's call it
basic<00:01:00.120> enemy<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:02.390> the<00:01:03.390> next<00:01:03.660> object<00:01:03.960> that

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
basic enemy and the next object that

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.390 
basic enemy and the next object that
we're<00:01:04.170> going<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.409> set<00:01:04.619> up<00:01:04.650> is<00:01:04.890> going<00:01:05.100> to<00:01:05.189> be<00:01:05.369> a

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
we're going to set up is going to be a

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.160 
we're going to set up is going to be a
sphere<00:01:05.519> now<00:01:06.119> this<00:01:06.299> we're<00:01:06.450> going<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:06.689> be<00:01:06.810> using

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
sphere now this we're going to be using

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.609 
sphere now this we're going to be using
as<00:01:07.350> our<00:01:07.590> target<00:01:08.479> for<00:01:09.479> interacting<00:01:10.409> with<00:01:10.439> the

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
as our target for interacting with the

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.090 
as our target for interacting with the
object<00:01:10.850> now<00:01:11.900> you<00:01:12.900> can<00:01:13.080> use<00:01:13.290> for<00:01:13.619> example<00:01:13.680> any

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
object now you can use for example any

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.980 
object now you can use for example any
player<00:01:14.400> to<00:01:14.430> player<00:01:15.180> character<00:01:15.720> type<00:01:15.960> of

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
player to player character type of

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.710 
player to player character type of
object<00:01:16.560> if<00:01:16.770> you<00:01:16.920> really<00:01:17.220> want<00:01:17.400> to<00:01:17.610> but<00:01:18.360> for<00:01:18.630> the

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
object if you really want to but for the

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.929 
object if you really want to but for the
purposes<00:01:19.170> of<00:01:19.350> this<00:01:19.500> tutorial<00:01:20.310> we're<00:01:20.520> going<00:01:20.790> to

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
purposes of this tutorial we're going to

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.590 
purposes of this tutorial we're going to
just<00:01:21.360> use<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.200> sphere<00:01:23.030> and<00:01:24.030> let's<00:01:24.420> call<00:01:24.540> it

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
just use a sphere and let's call it

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.870 
just use a sphere and let's call it
target<00:01:24.930> all<00:01:25.890> right<00:01:26.009> now<00:01:26.130> first<00:01:26.400> off<00:01:26.640> we<00:01:26.850> need

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
target all right now first off we need

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.870 
target all right now first off we need
to<00:01:27.060> tell<00:01:27.390> the<00:01:27.930> target<00:01:28.350> how<00:01:28.560> to<00:01:28.619> behave<00:01:29.070> so<00:01:29.400> what

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
to tell the target how to behave so what

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.490 
to tell the target how to behave so what
we're<00:01:30.030> going<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.240> for<00:01:30.810> this<00:01:30.900> tutorial<00:01:31.110> we're

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
we're going to for this tutorial we're

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.550 
we're going to for this tutorial we're
going<00:01:31.680> to<00:01:31.770> get<00:01:31.950> it<00:01:32.040> to<00:01:32.189> follow<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.640> mouse

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
going to get it to follow the mouse

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.999 
going to get it to follow the mouse
wherever<00:01:34.560> it<00:01:34.799> is<00:01:34.979> on<00:01:35.509> the<00:01:36.509> screen<00:01:36.630> so<00:01:37.170> for<00:01:37.829> that

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
wherever it is on the screen so for that

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.929 
wherever it is on the screen so for that
we're<00:01:38.310> going<00:01:38.490> to<00:01:38.610> need<00:01:38.790> a<00:01:38.820> few<00:01:39.090> things<00:01:40.850> okay<00:01:41.850> so

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
we're going to need a few things okay so

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.429 
we're going to need a few things okay so
the<00:01:42.119> first<00:01:42.360> thing<00:01:42.540> we<00:01:42.780> need<00:01:42.930> to<00:01:42.960> add<00:01:43.170> a<00:01:43.200> new

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
the first thing we need to add a new

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.710 
the first thing we need to add a new
state<00:01:43.710> a<00:01:44.090> finite<00:01:45.090> state<00:01:45.240> machine<00:01:46.340> and<00:01:47.600> this<00:01:48.600> is

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
state a finite state machine and this is

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.330 
state a finite state machine and this is
going<00:01:48.899> to<00:01:49.020> be<00:01:49.140> constantly<00:01:49.710> running<00:01:49.950> but<00:01:50.189> we're

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
going to be constantly running but we're

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.030 
going to be constantly running but we're
going<00:01:50.549> to<00:01:50.640> be<00:01:50.729> doing<00:01:50.909> two<00:01:51.329> main<00:01:51.990> things<00:01:52.290> first

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
going to be doing two main things first

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.230 
going to be doing two main things first
thing<00:01:53.250> that<00:01:53.369> we're<00:01:53.520> going<00:01:53.640> to<00:01:53.700> be<00:01:53.820> doing<00:01:53.970> is

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
thing that we're going to be doing is

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.770 
thing that we're going to be doing is
we're<00:01:54.689> going<00:01:54.840> to<00:01:54.930> tell<00:01:55.140> it<00:01:55.170> to<00:01:55.369> raycast

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
we're going to tell it to raycast

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.340 
we're going to tell it to raycast
actually<00:01:57.780> no<00:01:57.899> mouse<00:01:58.770> pick

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
actually no mouse pick

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.330 
actually no mouse pick
because<00:02:01.350> we're<00:02:01.560> going<00:02:01.740> to<00:02:01.800> be<00:02:01.920> using<00:02:02.250> the

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
because we're going to be using the

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.610 
because we're going to be using the
mouse<00:02:02.490> and<00:02:03.080> since<00:02:04.080> it's<00:02:04.229> going<00:02:04.380> to<00:02:04.500> be

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:04.620 
mouse and since it's going to be

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:07.370 
mouse and since it's going to be
happening<00:02:05.130> all<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.370> time<00:02:06.240> let's<00:02:06.570> click<00:02:06.810> every

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
happening all the time let's click every

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.390 
happening all the time let's click every
frame<00:02:08.690> for<00:02:09.690> we're<00:02:09.929> going<00:02:10.080> to<00:02:10.350> tell<00:02:10.619> it<00:02:10.770> to<00:02:10.950> cast

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
frame for we're going to tell it to cast

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.640 
frame for we're going to tell it to cast
array<00:02:11.940> into<00:02:12.300> the<00:02:12.420> scene<00:02:12.630> from<00:02:12.870> the<00:02:12.990> camera<00:02:13.500> and

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
array into the scene from the camera and

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.100 
array into the scene from the camera and
where<00:02:14.400> it<00:02:14.520> hits<00:02:14.819> we<00:02:15.209> want<00:02:15.480> to<00:02:15.569> store<00:02:15.840> that

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
where it hits we want to store that

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.340 
where it hits we want to store that
point<00:02:16.560> so<00:02:17.400> storing<00:02:18.240> a<00:02:18.330> point<00:02:18.600> this<00:02:18.870> takes<00:02:19.140> a

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
point so storing a point this takes a

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.350 
point so storing a point this takes a
vector3<00:02:19.860> variable<00:02:20.690> so<00:02:21.690> let's<00:02:23.240> call<00:02:24.240> it

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
vector3 variable so let's call it

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:33.020 
vector3 variable so let's call it
location<00:02:27.860> add<00:02:29.959> store<00:02:30.959> point<00:02:31.400> location<00:02:32.400> and

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
location add store point location and

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.580 
location add store point location and
the<00:02:33.150> next<00:02:33.390> one<00:02:33.540> is<00:02:33.660> going<00:02:33.840> to<00:02:33.930> be<00:02:34.170> we're<00:02:34.440> going

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
the next one is going to be we're going

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.759 
the next one is going to be we're going
to<00:02:34.709> tell<00:02:34.890> it<00:02:35.040> to<00:02:35.090> set<00:02:36.090> the<00:02:36.120> position<00:02:36.450> of<00:02:36.989> the

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:37.769 
to tell it to set the position of the

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:42.250 
to tell it to set the position of the
green<00:02:37.980> sphere<00:02:38.540> wherever<00:02:39.540> that<00:02:40.130> point<00:02:41.130> is<00:02:41.400> so

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
green sphere wherever that point is so

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.560 
green sphere wherever that point is so
set<00:02:43.790> position<00:02:45.200> find<00:02:46.200> this<00:02:46.290> in<00:02:46.440> the<00:02:46.470> transform

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 
set position find this in the transform

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.780 
set position find this in the transform
subsection<00:02:48.570> and<00:02:49.320> it's<00:02:50.130> going<00:02:50.340> to<00:02:50.430> be<00:02:50.489> using

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
subsection and it's going to be using

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:52.340 
subsection and it's going to be using
itself<00:02:51.150> and<00:02:51.420> the<00:02:51.510> vector<00:02:51.840> that<00:02:51.930> it's<00:02:52.110> going<00:02:52.260> to

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
itself and the vector that it's going to

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.860 
itself and the vector that it's going to
be<00:02:52.500> going<00:02:52.650> to<00:02:52.769> is<00:02:53.100> the<00:02:53.370> location<00:02:53.940> and<00:02:54.300> again

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
be going to is the location and again

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.900 
be going to is the location and again
we're<00:02:55.080> going<00:02:55.290> to<00:02:55.380> be<00:02:55.680> doing<00:02:55.980> this<00:02:56.100> every<00:02:56.310> frame

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
we're going to be doing this every frame

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.960 
we're going to be doing this every frame
so<00:02:57.510> let's<00:02:57.890> turn<00:02:58.890> this<00:02:59.100> on<00:02:59.340> and<00:02:59.580> see<00:02:59.820> what

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
so let's turn this on and see what

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:06.500 
so let's turn this on and see what
happens<00:03:04.610> ok<00:03:05.610> now<00:03:06.000> we've<00:03:06.180> just<00:03:06.209> encountered

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
happens ok now we've just encountered

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.039 
happens ok now we've just encountered
one<00:03:07.079> particular<00:03:07.709> issue<00:03:07.920> and<00:03:08.480> that<00:03:09.480> means<00:03:09.720> that

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
one particular issue and that means that

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:12.080 
one particular issue and that means that
it's<00:03:10.290> coming<00:03:11.100> towards<00:03:11.370> us<00:03:11.459> now<00:03:11.640> the<00:03:11.700> reason

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
it's coming towards us now the reason

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.580 
it's coming towards us now the reason
why<00:03:12.180> it's<00:03:12.360> happening<00:03:12.690> is<00:03:12.840> that<00:03:12.959> as<00:03:13.140> its

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
why it's happening is that as its

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.440 
why it's happening is that as its
casting<00:03:14.070> the<00:03:14.190> Ray<00:03:14.310> into<00:03:14.640> the<00:03:14.730> scene<00:03:15.000> every

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
casting the Ray into the scene every

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.680 
casting the Ray into the scene every
frame<00:03:15.780> it<00:03:16.019> picks<00:03:16.739> off<00:03:16.980> of<00:03:17.459> any<00:03:17.700> geometry<00:03:18.600> that

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
frame it picks off of any geometry that

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.650 
frame it picks off of any geometry that
it<00:03:18.840> hits<00:03:19.049> and<00:03:19.290> the<00:03:19.860> target<00:03:20.280> is<00:03:20.430> geometry<00:03:21.209> now

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
it hits and the target is geometry now

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:22.640 
it hits and the target is geometry now
there<00:03:21.810> are<00:03:21.900> two<00:03:22.019> ways<00:03:22.230> that<00:03:22.350> you<00:03:22.410> can<00:03:22.500> change

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
there are two ways that you can change

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.039 
there are two ways that you can change
that<00:03:22.980> one<00:03:23.940> would<00:03:24.269> be<00:03:24.299> to<00:03:24.540> turn<00:03:24.690> the<00:03:24.720> sphere

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
that one would be to turn the sphere

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:26.960 
that one would be to turn the sphere
Collider<00:03:25.380> off<00:03:25.590> but<00:03:26.250> that<00:03:26.459> could<00:03:26.700> cause<00:03:26.940> some

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
Collider off but that could cause some

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.270 
Collider off but that could cause some
issues<00:03:27.269> because<00:03:27.570> the<00:03:27.840> sphere<00:03:28.140> Collider<00:03:28.440> will

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
issues because the sphere Collider will

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.259 
issues because the sphere Collider will
be<00:03:29.489> what's<00:03:30.000> required<00:03:30.329> to<00:03:30.660> interact<00:03:31.670> so<00:03:32.670> other

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
be what's required to interact so other

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.870 
be what's required to interact so other
way<00:03:33.510> of<00:03:33.660> doing<00:03:33.900> it<00:03:34.019> is<00:03:34.200> to<00:03:34.530> go<00:03:34.890> into<00:03:34.920> the<00:03:35.579> States

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
way of doing it is to go into the States

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.250 
way of doing it is to go into the States
and<00:03:37.340> in<00:03:38.340> the<00:03:38.430> mouse<00:03:38.640> pick<00:03:38.970> see<00:03:39.750> you<00:03:39.810> down<00:03:40.019> here

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
and in the mouse pick see you down here

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.350 
and in the mouse pick see you down here
where<00:03:40.410> it<00:03:40.470> says<00:03:40.500> layer<00:03:40.860> mask<00:03:41.190> it<00:03:42.030> basically

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:42.360 
where it says layer mask it basically

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.090 
where it says layer mask it basically
means<00:03:42.660> that<00:03:42.750> we<00:03:42.900> can<00:03:43.079> filter<00:03:43.350> out<00:03:43.470> to

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
means that we can filter out to

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.190 
means that we can filter out to
determine<00:03:44.519> what<00:03:44.760> layer<00:03:45.209> we<00:03:45.780> want<00:03:45.930> it<00:03:46.079> to

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:46.200 
determine what layer we want it to

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.710 
determine what layer we want it to
interact<00:03:46.620> with<00:03:46.709> to<00:03:47.400> create<00:03:47.760> a<00:03:47.820> layer<00:03:48.030> go<00:03:48.510> into

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
interact with to create a layer go into

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.020 
interact with to create a layer go into
the<00:03:48.840> inspector<00:03:49.320> and<00:03:49.500> in<00:03:50.459> here<00:03:50.670> you<00:03:50.790> see<00:03:50.910> this

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
the inspector and in here you see this

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.650 
the inspector and in here you see this
pull<00:03:51.269> down<00:03:52.670> I've<00:03:53.670> already<00:03:54.000> got<00:03:54.150> one<00:03:54.180> set<00:03:54.540> up

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
pull down I've already got one set up

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:56.690 
pull down I've already got one set up
for<00:03:54.959> the<00:03:55.079> target<00:03:55.470> but<00:03:55.709> if<00:03:55.890> you<00:03:56.100> wanted<00:03:56.430> to<00:03:56.519> add

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
for the target but if you wanted to add

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.759 
for the target but if you wanted to add
a<00:03:56.730> layer<00:03:57.120> all<00:03:57.450> you<00:03:57.690> have<00:03:57.810> to<00:03:57.900> do<00:03:57.989> is<00:03:58.170> open<00:03:58.380> that

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
a layer all you have to do is open that

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:02.650 
a layer all you have to do is open that
up<00:03:58.980> and<00:03:59.160> choose<00:04:00.000> any<00:04:00.180> empty<00:04:00.510> spot<00:04:00.780> click<00:04:01.739> there

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
up and choose any empty spot click there

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:05.690 
up and choose any empty spot click there
it<00:04:03.660> should<00:04:03.900> show<00:04:04.170> you<00:04:04.230> a<00:04:04.350> text<00:04:04.890> entry<00:04:05.040> field

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
it should show you a text entry field

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:07.280 
it should show you a text entry field
and<00:04:06.299> you<00:04:06.420> just<00:04:06.600> call<00:04:06.750> it<00:04:06.870> whatever<00:04:07.019> you<00:04:07.170> want

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
and you just call it whatever you want

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.559 
and you just call it whatever you want
but<00:04:07.709> since<00:04:08.610> we've<00:04:08.819> already<00:04:09.000> got<00:04:09.239> it<00:04:09.360> set<00:04:09.540> up

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:09.569 
but since we've already got it set up

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:10.770 
but since we've already got it set up
let's<00:04:09.959> go<00:04:10.200> ahead

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
let's go ahead

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.930 
let's go ahead
and<00:04:13.290> tell<00:04:14.290> it<00:04:14.319> to<00:04:14.590> be<00:04:14.890> in<00:04:15.190> the<00:04:15.400> target<00:04:15.790> layer

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
and tell it to be in the target layer

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:20.490 
and tell it to be in the target layer
now<00:04:16.810> in<00:04:17.049> the<00:04:17.230> layer<00:04:17.410> mask<00:04:17.700> this<00:04:18.700> is<00:04:19.019> you<00:04:20.019> two<00:04:20.230> in

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
now in the layer mask this is you two in

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.230 
now in the layer mask this is you two in
this<00:04:20.650> field<00:04:20.950> you<00:04:21.130> tell<00:04:21.310> it<00:04:21.430> how<00:04:21.639> many<00:04:21.700> masks

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:22.240 
this field you tell it how many masks

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.240 
this field you tell it how many masks
you<00:04:22.360> want<00:04:22.540> so<00:04:22.750> if<00:04:22.840> you<00:04:22.900> want<00:04:22.960> one<00:04:23.320> mask<00:04:23.620> or<00:04:23.980> two

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
you want so if you want one mask or two

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.120 
you want so if you want one mask or two
masks<00:04:24.900> but<00:04:25.900> for<00:04:26.080> our<00:04:26.200> purposes<00:04:26.650> we<00:04:26.800> just<00:04:26.980> need

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
masks but for our purposes we just need

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:30.300 
masks but for our purposes we just need
one<00:04:27.340> and<00:04:27.840> we're<00:04:28.840> going<00:04:28.990> to<00:04:29.050> tell<00:04:29.230> it<00:04:29.350> to<00:04:29.380> use

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
one and we're going to tell it to use

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:32.340 
one and we're going to tell it to use
the<00:04:30.669> target<00:04:31.030> now<00:04:31.180> this<00:04:31.570> is<00:04:31.750> all<00:04:31.930> well<00:04:32.110> and<00:04:32.139> good

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.350 
the target now this is all well and good

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:34.950 
the target now this is all well and good
but<00:04:32.530> the<00:04:32.830> problem<00:04:33.220> is<00:04:33.370> is<00:04:33.580> that<00:04:33.639> right<00:04:34.389> now<00:04:34.690> as

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
but the problem is is that right now as

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:39.060 
but the problem is is that right now as
it<00:04:35.350> is<00:04:35.680> it<00:04:36.100> will<00:04:36.700> only<00:04:37.260> interact<00:04:38.260> with<00:04:38.440> the

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.070 
it is it will only interact with the

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:41.480 
it is it will only interact with the
target<00:04:39.460> we<00:04:39.790> want<00:04:39.970> it<00:04:40.030> to<00:04:40.150> be<00:04:40.300> the<00:04:40.419> opposite<00:04:41.110> so

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
target we want it to be the opposite so

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.570 
target we want it to be the opposite so
invert<00:04:42.490> mask<00:04:42.700> and<00:04:43.180> that<00:04:43.710> should<00:04:44.710> now<00:04:44.950> ignore

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580 
invert mask and that should now ignore

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.750 
invert mask and that should now ignore
this<00:04:46.390> item<00:04:47.050> or<00:04:47.230> any<00:04:47.830> other<00:04:48.070> items<00:04:48.460> in<00:04:48.640> the

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:48.760 
this item or any other items in the

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:56.220 
this item or any other items in the
target<00:04:49.120> layer<00:04:49.330> so<00:04:49.990> let's<00:04:50.020> try<00:04:50.320> it<00:04:54.780> okay<00:04:55.780> so<00:04:56.020> it

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:56.230 
target layer so let's try it okay so it

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:57.600 
target layer so let's try it okay so it
looks<00:04:56.380> like<00:04:56.440> it's<00:04:56.680> doing<00:04:56.800> what<00:04:57.040> we<00:04:57.160> need<00:04:57.340> it<00:04:57.430> to

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 
looks like it's doing what we need it to

00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:00.120 
looks like it's doing what we need it to
and<00:04:57.870> in<00:04:58.870> the<00:04:58.960> next<00:04:59.140> video<00:04:59.320> we're<00:04:59.590> going<00:04:59.770> over

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:00.130 
and in the next video we're going over

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:01.680 
and in the next video we're going over
going<00:05:00.370> to<00:05:00.460> be<00:05:00.610> going<00:05:00.880> over<00:05:01.000> setting<00:05:01.450> up<00:05:01.540> the

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:01.690 
going to be going over setting up the

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:03.930 
going to be going over setting up the
first<00:05:01.870> of<00:05:02.080> the<00:05:02.200> conditional<00:05:02.680> statements<00:05:03.190> but

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:03.940 
first of the conditional statements but

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:05.700 
first of the conditional statements but
until<00:05:04.270> then<00:05:04.479> I<00:05:04.690> hope<00:05:04.990> that's<00:05:05.229> answered<00:05:05.410> a<00:05:05.590> few

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
until then I hope that's answered a few

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:06.960 
until then I hope that's answered a few
