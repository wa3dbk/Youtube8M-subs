00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:35.980 
to cut to release this tank because when

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.210 
to cut to release this tank because when
i<00:00:36.010> installed<00:00:36.550> everything<00:00:37.000> as<00:00:37.530> i<00:00:38.530> saw<00:00:38.920> that<00:00:39.129> i

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:39.220 
i installed everything as i saw that i

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.729 
i installed everything as i saw that i
installed<00:00:39.640> the<00:00:39.790> plumbing<00:00:40.269> and<00:00:40.360> glue<00:00:41.110> fittings

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:41.739 
installed the plumbing and glue fittings

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:45.600 
installed the plumbing and glue fittings
in<00:00:42.250> place<00:00:43.059> so<00:00:43.989> i'll<00:00:44.440> have<00:00:44.650> to<00:00:44.830> cut<00:00:45.040> some<00:00:45.309> stuff

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:45.610 
in place so i'll have to cut some stuff

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.200 
in place so i'll have to cut some stuff
out<00:00:46.559> but<00:00:47.559> that's<00:00:47.860> not<00:00:48.040> that<00:00:48.219> big<00:00:48.430> of<00:00:48.489> a<00:00:48.670> deal<00:00:48.879> I

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.210 
out but that's not that big of a deal I

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.100 
out but that's not that big of a deal I
anticipated<00:00:49.809> that<00:00:50.290> so<00:00:51.570> it's<00:00:52.570> just<00:00:52.780> a<00:00:52.930> matter

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:53.110 
anticipated that so it's just a matter

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:56.479 
anticipated that so it's just a matter
of<00:00:53.289> pulling<00:00:53.649> all<00:00:53.920> the<00:00:54.070> rest<00:00:54.280> of<00:00:54.399> the<00:00:54.460> water<00:00:54.670> out

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
of pulling all the rest of the water out

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:05.369 
of pulling all the rest of the water out
getting<00:00:57.489> everything<00:00:57.700> moved<00:01:03.930> this<00:01:04.930> right<00:01:05.170> here

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:05.379 
getting everything moved this right here

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:07.800 
getting everything moved this right here
is<00:01:05.410> just<00:01:05.590> some<00:01:06.030> actually<00:01:07.030> what<00:01:07.210> it<00:01:07.300> is<00:01:07.450> is<00:01:07.660> when

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
is just some actually what it is is when

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.410 
is just some actually what it is is when
i<00:01:07.840> got<00:01:08.080> my<00:01:08.110> swimming<00:01:08.680> pool<00:01:08.979> this<00:01:09.700> is<00:01:09.880> the<00:01:10.090> happy

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
i got my swimming pool this is the happy

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.770 
i got my swimming pool this is the happy
bottom<00:01:10.979> from<00:01:11.979> my<00:01:12.130> swimming<00:01:12.460> pool<00:01:12.820> i'll<00:01:13.450> put<00:01:13.690> it

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
bottom from my swimming pool i'll put it

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.930 
bottom from my swimming pool i'll put it
behind<00:01:13.930> the<00:01:14.289> tank<00:01:14.500> to<00:01:14.770> kind<00:01:15.009> of<00:01:15.070> multiple<00:01:15.729> some

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:15.940 
behind the tank to kind of multiple some

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.270 
behind the tank to kind of multiple some
of<00:01:16.030> the<00:01:16.119> sound<00:01:16.450> but<00:01:17.229> all<00:01:17.380> it<00:01:17.560> is<00:01:17.590> is<00:01:17.740> just<00:01:18.190> a

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:18.280 
of the sound but all it is is just a

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.559 
of the sound but all it is is just a
little<00:01:19.590> like<00:01:20.590> styrofoam<00:01:20.950> or<00:01:21.550> something<00:01:22.390> I

00:01:22.559 --> 00:01:22.569 
little like styrofoam or something I

00:01:22.569 --> 00:01:25.980 
little like styrofoam or something I
used<00:01:23.470> it<00:01:23.619> to<00:01:23.649> muffle<00:01:24.220> down<00:01:24.399> sound<00:01:24.970> of<00:01:25.780> the

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:25.990 
used it to muffle down sound of the

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:27.270 
used it to muffle down sound of the
trickling<00:01:26.259> water<00:01:26.740> and<00:01:26.950> everything<00:01:27.009> you

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:27.280 
trickling water and everything you

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.430 
trickling water and everything you
worked<00:01:27.459> pretty<00:01:27.700> good<00:01:27.970> so<00:01:28.170> I'll<00:01:29.170> probably

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:29.440 
worked pretty good so I'll probably

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.710 
worked pretty good so I'll probably
reuse<00:01:30.220> it<00:01:30.429> because<00:01:30.640> it's<00:01:30.819> cut<00:01:31.030> out<00:01:31.179> for<00:01:31.539> the

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 
reuse it because it's cut out for the

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.290 
reuse it because it's cut out for the
tank<00:01:31.959> I'll<00:01:32.860> just<00:01:33.099> install<00:01:33.729> it<00:01:33.759> a<00:01:34.000> little<00:01:34.119> bit

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:34.300 
tank I'll just install it a little bit

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:50.240 
tank I'll just install it a little bit
better<00:01:34.450> to<00:01:34.720> start

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:56.640 

okay<00:01:53.100> all<00:01:54.100> in<00:01:54.340> one<00:01:54.580> piece<00:01:54.910> so<00:01:55.870> I<00:01:55.900> won't<00:01:56.290> have<00:01:56.440> to

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:56.650 
okay all in one piece so I won't have to

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:00.630 
okay all in one piece so I won't have to
cut<00:01:57.040> it<00:01:57.070> you<00:01:57.700> know<00:01:57.760> such<00:01:58.090> it<00:01:58.270> got<00:01:59.190> okay<00:02:00.190> this<00:02:00.430> is

cut it you know such it got okay this is
my<00:02:02.040> DIY<00:02:03.040> overflow<00:02:04.020> if<00:02:05.020> you<00:02:05.170> want<00:02:05.350> to<00:02:05.410> come<00:02:05.470> a

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530 
my DIY overflow if you want to come a

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:11.310 
my DIY overflow if you want to come a
little<00:02:05.710> closer<00:02:06.010> I<00:02:06.480> can<00:02:07.480> show<00:02:07.750> you<00:02:10.260> right<00:02:11.260> here

little closer I can show you right here

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:16.020 
little closer I can show you right here
it's<00:02:12.160> just<00:02:12.490> just<00:02:12.730> inch<00:02:12.970> and<00:02:13.150> a<00:02:13.180> half<00:02:13.210> PVC<00:02:14.110> and<00:02:15.030> I

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:16.030 
it's just just inch and a half PVC and I

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.030 
it's just just inch and a half PVC and I
mean<00:02:16.270> check<00:02:16.780> out<00:02:16.930> a<00:02:16.960> lot<00:02:17.200> of<00:02:17.290> other<00:02:17.440> videos<00:02:17.860> on

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
mean check out a lot of other videos on

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.370 
mean check out a lot of other videos on
how<00:02:18.220> to<00:02:18.250> make<00:02:18.520> the<00:02:18.550> overflow<00:02:19.210> it's<00:02:19.930> really

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
how to make the overflow it's really

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.700 
how to make the overflow it's really
easy<00:02:20.500> to<00:02:20.620> think<00:02:20.890> my<00:02:21.070> very<00:02:21.400> first<00:02:21.900> song<00:02:22.900> video<00:02:23.350> I

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:23.710 
easy to think my very first song video I

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:25.530 
easy to think my very first song video I
made<00:02:23.950> a<00:02:24.010> small<00:02:24.430> one<00:02:24.670> out<00:02:24.790> of<00:02:24.880> three<00:02:25.090> quarter

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
made a small one out of three quarter

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.190 
made a small one out of three quarter
just<00:02:26.260> up<00:02:26.470> the<00:02:26.680> size<00:02:27.150> what<00:02:28.150> I<00:02:28.180> actually<00:02:28.450> did<00:02:28.990> as

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
just up the size what I actually did as

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.290 
just up the size what I actually did as
i<00:02:29.320> went<00:02:29.500> with<00:02:29.680> inch<00:02:29.950> and<00:02:30.160> a<00:02:30.280> half<00:02:30.310> think<00:02:31.150> this

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
i went with inch and a half think this

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.320 
i went with inch and a half think this
is<00:02:31.420> inch<00:02:31.630> and<00:02:31.810> a<00:02:31.840> half<00:02:31.870> for<00:02:32.320> inch<00:02:32.470> and<00:02:32.590> quarter

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
is inch and a half for inch and quarter

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:40.860 
is inch and a half for inch and quarter
PVC<00:02:35.520> it<00:02:36.520> actually<00:02:37.680> outperforms<00:02:39.330> my<00:02:40.330> return

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
PVC it actually outperforms my return

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.050 
PVC it actually outperforms my return
pump<00:02:41.260> and<00:02:41.530> that's<00:02:42.190> kind<00:02:42.490> of<00:02:42.550> what<00:02:42.670> you<00:02:42.730> want

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
pump and that's kind of what you want

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.250 
pump and that's kind of what you want
you<00:02:43.270> want<00:02:43.480> something<00:02:43.840> that's<00:02:43.960> going<00:02:44.200> to

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
you want something that's going to

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.860 
you want something that's going to
outperform<00:02:44.740> their<00:02:45.250> return<00:02:45.640> pump<00:02:46.620> because<00:02:47.850> if

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
outperform their return pump because if

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.970 
outperform their return pump because if
you<00:02:49.870> don't<00:02:50.110> outperform<00:02:50.980> your<00:02:51.160> return<00:02:52.090> pump

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
you don't outperform your return pump

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.420 
you don't outperform your return pump
then<00:02:53.980> you<00:02:54.670> have<00:02:54.880> a<00:02:54.959> problem<00:02:55.959> with<00:02:56.430> dialing

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
then you have a problem with dialing

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.720 
then you have a problem with dialing
back<00:02:57.700> your<00:02:58.060> overflow<00:02:58.630> this<00:02:59.560> way<00:02:59.920> you<00:03:00.700> don't

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:00.730 
back your overflow this way you don't

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.620 
back your overflow this way you don't
have<00:03:00.940> to<00:03:01.090> dial<00:03:01.450> back<00:03:01.600> the<00:03:02.550> overflow<00:03:03.550> or<00:03:03.850> the

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
have to dial back the overflow or the

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:07.830 
have to dial back the overflow or the
return<00:03:04.959> pump<00:03:05.320> you<00:03:06.220> just<00:03:06.459> let<00:03:06.880> that<00:03:07.060> pump<00:03:07.390> pump

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
return pump you just let that pump pump

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.729 
return pump you just let that pump pump
and<00:03:08.110> if<00:03:08.200> the<00:03:08.380> pump<00:03:08.590> pumps<00:03:09.070> not<00:03:09.850> 100<00:03:10.239> gallons<00:03:10.739> an

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
and if the pump pumps not 100 gallons an

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:14.520 
and if the pump pumps not 100 gallons an
hour<00:03:11.940> that<00:03:12.940> it<00:03:13.120> pumps<00:03:13.540> 900<00:03:14.020> gallons<00:03:14.140> an<00:03:14.440> hour

hour that it pumps 900 gallons an hour
this<00:03:14.890> thing<00:03:15.190> can<00:03:15.370> handle<00:03:15.790> it<00:03:15.850> the<00:03:16.030> pipe<00:03:16.209> is<00:03:16.239> so

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
this thing can handle it the pipe is so

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.890 
this thing can handle it the pipe is so
big<00:03:16.870> and<00:03:17.140> this<00:03:18.100> piece<00:03:18.370> up<00:03:18.610> here<00:03:18.640> is<00:03:19.600> a<00:03:19.660> little

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
big and this piece up here is a little

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.560 
big and this piece up here is a little
custom<00:03:20.350> piece<00:03:20.590> what<00:03:21.250> it<00:03:21.370> was<00:03:21.580> was<00:03:21.880> a<00:03:21.910> 3-inch

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:22.570 
custom piece what it was was a 3-inch

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:28.229 
custom piece what it was was a 3-inch
pipe<00:03:23.670> to<00:03:25.230> inch<00:03:26.230> and<00:03:26.470> a<00:03:26.500> half<00:03:26.530> pipe<00:03:27.070> and<00:03:27.760> all<00:03:28.090> it

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
pipe to inch and a half pipe and all it

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:30.750 
pipe to inch and a half pipe and all it
did<00:03:28.270> was<00:03:28.450> cut<00:03:28.780> a<00:03:28.810> bunch<00:03:28.989> of<00:03:29.200> slots<00:03:29.560> in<00:03:29.890> it<00:03:30.070> so

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
did was cut a bunch of slots in it so

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:33.930 
did was cut a bunch of slots in it so
the<00:03:30.880> water<00:03:31.120> can<00:03:31.239> go<00:03:31.959> in<00:03:32.140> but<00:03:32.950> it<00:03:33.100> stops<00:03:33.550> the

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
the water can go in but it stops the

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:35.760 
the water can go in but it stops the
little<00:03:34.300> hermit<00:03:34.480> crabs<00:03:34.870> like<00:03:35.170> this<00:03:35.350> one<00:03:35.560> guy

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:35.770 
little hermit crabs like this one guy

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:39.590 
little hermit crabs like this one guy
got<00:03:35.980> stuck<00:03:36.480> so<00:03:37.480> you<00:03:37.600> probably<00:03:37.980> needed<00:03:38.980> make<00:03:39.370> it

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
got stuck so you probably needed make it

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:46.560 
got stuck so you probably needed make it
but<00:03:40.600> uh<00:03:42.060> but<00:03:43.060> I<00:03:43.360> mean<00:03:44.110> this<00:03:44.440> this<00:03:45.390> worked<00:03:46.390> out

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:46.570 
but uh but I mean this this worked out

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:48.390 
but uh but I mean this this worked out
great<00:03:46.750> but<00:03:47.020> look<00:03:47.290> at<00:03:47.440> the<00:03:47.560> algae<00:03:48.100> that<00:03:48.130> it

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
great but look at the algae that it

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:53.430 
great but look at the algae that it
collects<00:03:48.880> I<00:03:50.220> mean<00:03:51.220> that's<00:03:51.400> crazy<00:03:52.080> but<00:03:53.080> it's<00:03:53.230> so

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
collects I mean that's crazy but it's so

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.630 
collects I mean that's crazy but it's so
close<00:03:53.709> to<00:03:53.950> the<00:03:54.070> light<00:03:55.019> but<00:03:56.019> it<00:03:56.950> works<00:03:57.220> really

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:57.640 
close to the light but it works really

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.630 
close to the light but it works really
really<00:03:57.820> good<00:03:58.950> I've<00:03:59.950> never

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:00.640 
really good I've never

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.760 
really good I've never
and<00:04:00.790> I've<00:04:01.360> never<00:04:01.569> had<00:04:01.810> any<00:04:02.020> problems<00:04:02.500> with<00:04:02.590> it

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:02.770 
and I've never had any problems with it

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:05.040 
and I've never had any problems with it
clogging<00:04:03.190> up<00:04:03.520> especially<00:04:03.819> a<00:04:04.240> pipe<00:04:04.510> this<00:04:04.750> size

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:05.050 
clogging up especially a pipe this size

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:09.300 
clogging up especially a pipe this size
never<00:04:05.980> clogged<00:04:06.400> up<00:04:06.870> however<00:04:07.870> I<00:04:08.170> did<00:04:08.980> have<00:04:09.280> a

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:09.310 
never clogged up however I did have a

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:15.420 
never clogged up however I did have a
problem<00:04:10.470> when<00:04:11.550> your<00:04:12.660> powerheads<00:04:14.040> catch<00:04:15.040> air

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
problem when your powerheads catch air

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.380 
problem when your powerheads catch air
all<00:04:15.970> the<00:04:16.239> little<00:04:16.480> air<00:04:16.600> bubbles<00:04:17.250> sometimes

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:18.390 
all the little air bubbles sometimes

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:21.180 
all the little air bubbles sometimes
maybe<00:04:19.390> this<00:04:19.600> might<00:04:19.750> happen<00:04:20.049> I<00:04:20.500> guess<00:04:20.829> the<00:04:20.980> tank

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
maybe this might happen I guess the tank

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:22.500 
maybe this might happen I guess the tank
was<00:04:21.340> set<00:04:21.549> up<00:04:21.669> for<00:04:21.700> about<00:04:21.970> a<00:04:22.030> year<00:04:22.330> and<00:04:22.419> a<00:04:22.480> half

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
was set up for about a year and a half

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:26.909 
was set up for about a year and a half
or<00:04:22.870> so<00:04:22.900> maybe<00:04:23.260> and<00:04:25.350> all<00:04:26.350> the<00:04:26.620> little<00:04:26.740> air

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:26.919 
or so maybe and all the little air

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:29.130 
or so maybe and all the little air
bubbles<00:04:27.340> get<00:04:27.520> caught<00:04:28.360> in<00:04:28.540> it<00:04:28.690> and<00:04:28.870> it<00:04:28.960> goes

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:29.140 
bubbles get caught in it and it goes

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.190 
bubbles get caught in it and it goes
down<00:04:29.410> but<00:04:30.070> then<00:04:30.250> they<00:04:30.430> stop<00:04:30.940> right<00:04:31.270> here<00:04:31.570> so

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:32.200 
down but then they stop right here so

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:34.230 
down but then they stop right here so
this<00:04:32.590> guy<00:04:32.860> right<00:04:33.100> here<00:04:33.160> Prime's<00:04:33.669> the<00:04:33.880> pump

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
this guy right here Prime's the pump

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.800 
this guy right here Prime's the pump
that<00:04:35.020> way<00:04:35.200> it<00:04:35.380> can<00:04:35.560> start<00:04:35.830> cycling<00:04:36.480> but<00:04:37.480> every

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
that way it can start cycling but every

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.420 
that way it can start cycling but every
once<00:04:37.990> in<00:04:38.110> a<00:04:38.140> while<00:04:38.320> you<00:04:38.350> have<00:04:38.530> to<00:04:38.680> suck<00:04:39.070> the<00:04:39.220> air

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:39.430 
once in a while you have to suck the air

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:41.250 
once in a while you have to suck the air
out<00:04:39.460> of<00:04:39.700> this<00:04:39.940> top<00:04:40.270> piece<00:04:40.540> because<00:04:40.960> then<00:04:41.140> it

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:41.260 
out of this top piece because then it

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.440 
out of this top piece because then it
will<00:04:41.380> get<00:04:41.500> air<00:04:41.770> locked<00:04:42.070> and<00:04:42.400> then<00:04:42.970> it<00:04:43.090> stops

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:43.450 
will get air locked and then it stops

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:46.020 
will get air locked and then it stops
overflowing<00:04:44.410> and<00:04:44.560> then<00:04:45.160> you<00:04:45.280> pump<00:04:45.490> just<00:04:45.820> fill

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
overflowing and then you pump just fill

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:47.790 
overflowing and then you pump just fill
the<00:04:46.240> tank<00:04:46.480> up<00:04:46.660> fills<00:04:46.960> the<00:04:47.080> tank<00:04:47.230> up<00:04:47.500> and<00:04:47.650> then

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
the tank up fills the tank up and then

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.490 
the tank up fills the tank up and then
it<00:04:48.220> will<00:04:48.430> start<00:04:48.669> spilling<00:04:49.120> out<00:04:49.240> everywhere

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
it will start spilling out everywhere

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.710 
it will start spilling out everywhere
but<00:04:50.500> like<00:04:50.919> i<00:04:51.070> said<00:04:51.100> this<00:04:51.550> size<00:04:51.820> pipe<00:04:52.240> I've

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
but like i said this size pipe I've

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.080 
but like i said this size pipe I've
never<00:04:53.110> had<00:04:53.410> any<00:04:53.620> real<00:04:53.860> major<00:04:54.310> problems<00:04:54.940> with

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:55.090 
never had any real major problems with

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:59.970 
never had any real major problems with
it<00:04:55.419> this<00:04:55.900> is<00:04:56.050> a<00:04:56.080> great<00:04:56.470> design<00:04:56.980> and<00:04:58.560> it<00:04:59.560> just

00:04:59.970 --> 00:04:59.980 
it this is a great design and it just

00:04:59.980 --> 00:05:01.530 
it this is a great design and it just
worked<00:05:00.190> out<00:05:00.310> great<00:05:00.520> this<00:05:00.790> cap<00:05:01.060> right<00:05:01.270> here<00:05:01.330> I

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:01.540 
worked out great this cap right here I

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:03.990 
worked out great this cap right here I
put<00:05:01.810> some<00:05:01.990> little<00:05:02.140> cotton<00:05:02.650> swabs<00:05:02.919> to<00:05:03.640> muffle

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.000 
put some little cotton swabs to muffle
