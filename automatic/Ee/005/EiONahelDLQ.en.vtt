00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
quite simple to work out what the

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:26.900 
quite simple to work out what the
differences<00:00:25.920> are<00:00:26.130> by<00:00:26.369> looking<00:00:26.699> at<00:00:26.820> the

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
differences are by looking at the

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.179 
differences are by looking at the
letters<00:00:27.269> at<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.510> end<00:00:27.660> of<00:00:27.960> the<00:00:28.019> model<00:00:28.170> name<00:00:28.439> the

letter n which is on all eight

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:33.260 
letter n which is on all eight
variations<00:00:31.769> denotes<00:00:32.489> the<00:00:32.640> fact<00:00:32.820> that<00:00:32.910> every

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
variations denotes the fact that every

model has network connectivity the
letter<00:00:35.670> D<00:00:35.940> indicates<00:00:36.390> that<00:00:36.750> those<00:00:36.960> models

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
letter D indicates that those models

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.380 
letter D indicates that those models
will<00:00:37.559> double<00:00:37.800> size<00:00:37.980> prints<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:39.090> letters

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
will double size prints and the letters

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.840 
will double size prints and the letters
T<00:00:39.629> and<00:00:39.930> C<00:00:40.230> lets<00:00:40.829> you<00:00:40.980> know<00:00:41.100> that<00:00:41.280> those<00:00:41.430> models

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
T and C lets you know that those models

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.900 
T and C lets you know that those models
have<00:00:41.910> an<00:00:42.120> extra<00:00:42.420> 530<00:00:43.260> sheet<00:00:43.530> paper<00:00:43.950> tray<00:00:44.129> and<00:00:44.370> a

have an extra 530 sheet paper tray and a

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.360 
have an extra 530 sheet paper tray and a
cabinet<00:00:45.329> to<00:00:45.510> make<00:00:45.660> it<00:00:45.840> floor<00:00:46.110> standing<00:00:46.649> the

cabinet to make it floor standing the

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.520 
cabinet to make it floor standing the
real<00:00:47.579> confusion<00:00:48.270> is<00:00:48.420> how<00:00:48.600> to<00:00:48.660> determine<00:00:49.110> which

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
real confusion is how to determine which

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.229 
real confusion is how to determine which
of<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.860> three<00:00:49.890> models<00:00:50.520> to<00:00:50.700> go<00:00:50.820> for<00:00:51.090> in<00:00:51.180> the

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
of the three models to go for in the

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.299 
of the three models to go for in the
first<00:00:51.390> place<00:00:51.600> hopefully<00:00:52.530> the<00:00:52.920> next<00:00:53.039> few

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
first place hopefully the next few

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.770 
first place hopefully the next few
minutes<00:00:53.399> will<00:00:53.730> help<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:54.030> make<00:00:54.149> that<00:00:54.329> decision

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
minutes will help to make that decision

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.319 
minutes will help to make that decision
a<00:00:55.079> little<00:00:55.260> clearer<00:00:55.829> now<00:00:56.610> all<00:00:56.789> three<00:00:57.120> models

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
a little clearer now all three models

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.840 
a little clearer now all three models
look<00:00:57.690> identical<00:00:57.870> from<00:00:58.620> the<00:00:58.770> outside<00:00:59.309> will

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
look identical from the outside will

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.270 
look identical from the outside will
have<00:00:59.969> a<00:01:00.030> different<00:01:00.570> internal<00:01:01.050> spec<00:01:01.559> this

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
have a different internal spec this

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.060 
have a different internal spec this
