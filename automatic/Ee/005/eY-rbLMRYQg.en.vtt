00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:29.449
 the first death justifies the second 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:32.449
 the second glorify the third 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.660
 damn the king body for bringing terror to these lands 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.440
 It is said that one day it was in Murcia that he was a warlord some time ago 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.030
 of power that relentlessly destroyed everything you wanted 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.080
 I think he has hell 

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.780
 the earth that you step on 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.810
 breathes a scorching hatred 

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:01.180
 a hate so alive that it could consume all humanity 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.370
 salvation 

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:09.280
 hope 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.280
 it came from heaven 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.680
 A soldier 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.910
 full of righteous anger and so powerful as to face the harbor king 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:23.910
 a celestial warrior 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.910
 that will guide the man towards the last battle 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:29.830
 and a German 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.830
 bright and in the horror 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.170
 when the battle ended 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.780
 and our world was safe 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.780
 the celestial warrior disappeared 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.780
 he just left his bow 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.640
 thus was born the legend belhaj everly his art 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.960
 hundreds would die for it
