00:01:02.349 --> 00:01:02.359 
guys for HP fire I will be disappointed

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:04.630 
guys for HP fire I will be disappointed
but<00:01:02.750> we're<00:01:03.109> at<00:01:03.230> the<00:01:03.260> lower<00:01:04.070> end<00:01:04.280> of<00:01:04.339> the<00:01:04.399> ladder

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
but we're at the lower end of the ladder

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:10.960 
but we're at the lower end of the ladder
so<00:01:05.119> it's<00:01:05.420> possible<00:01:09.100> then<00:01:10.100> we<00:01:10.190> go<00:01:10.280> for<00:01:10.460> rocks<00:01:10.670> I

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:10.970 
so it's possible then we go for rocks I

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.570 
so it's possible then we go for rocks I
think<00:01:11.240> that's<00:01:11.360> the<00:01:11.479> right<00:01:11.630> play<00:01:12.399> taking<00:01:13.399> a

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.580

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:15.100 
think that's the right play taking a
