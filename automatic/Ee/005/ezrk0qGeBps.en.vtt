00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:16.500
 come to us from all patient-hire 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.570
 the joint complaints have whereby one 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.369
 always have to pay attention that we only 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.769
 treat patients 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.869
 so you have the arthritis 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.939
 joint swellings have joint 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.529
 have warming but we can not 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.619
 Patients treated the one pure 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:34.219
 Arthrosis is therefore a pure wear 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:34.219
 have a certain length 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.970
 We have a patient here 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.750
 example with a rheumatoid 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:47.610
 arthritis of a definite verdikt 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.710
 sanding mucous membrane has seen 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.750
 here this typical masked 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.300
 inflammatory mucous membrane the 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.880
 Increased liquid produces what then 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.770
 in the following consequence leads to pain 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.930
 in the second picture we see now 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.630
 the course of therapy it is with 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.300
 a thin needle of tiny microparticles 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:08.850
 injected into the joint we see 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:11.640
 here at this microparticle it is one 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:14.040
 radioactive radiation bound the 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.830
 distribute themselves completely uniformly 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.830
 in the entire joint fluid in the 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.650
 further course these become radioactive 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.940
 marked micro edition took place once 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.630
 Indian modified mucosa 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.830
 recorded here we see this is this 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.750
 typical throughout the mucosa 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.540
 distribute and then can in the further 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.420
 the course lasts up to six months 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.610
 this radioactive radiation is itself 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.860
 along mucous membrane cells destroy so 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.840
 that the joints thickened mucus has 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.270
 come back to a normal size 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.460
 that the battery education is declining 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.670
 and most of all, patient of his 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:53.490
 pain is liberated the expiration of 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.470
 Therapy corresponds in the course of one 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.929
 normal joint function is or as that 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:02.399
 normal knee disinfected and then 

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:04.770
 gets right behind the kneecap this 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.910
 radioactive particles in the 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.200
 Injected joint 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:11.280
 first we inject something 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.840
 contrast agent in the joint so we 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.540
 are also quite sure that this 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.569
 Radioactivity is also in the joint 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.940
 distributed we use a c arc 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:22.349
 That's a fluoroscopy device like 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:23.940
 we core it from radiology 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:26.520
 now you can see that very nice 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.950
 needle and how it contrasts this 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:32.520
 with a total total knee joint 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.230
 is distributed homogeneously below 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.270
 then this radioactive radiant 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.430
 substance directly into the knee joint 

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.800
 injected you see that is a very 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.770
 short little painful process 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:46.769
 After that you will slow down something steroids 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:50.159
 it sprays the liquid well 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:51.840
 distributed in the joint and also the patient 

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:53.879
 immediately felt a pain relief 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:57.569
 and then we are already with them 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:03:00.900
 finished therapy is important that that 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:03.209
 joint moved again after the therapy 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.159
 So it will be as good as possible 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.560
 then the joint is distributed 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:09.900
 Settled for over 48 hours with one 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.879
 normal rail and after 48 hours 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.409
 can because that the rail is removed 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:17.400
 and then the joints are back 

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:19.409
 largely normal load and you say 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:23.069
 in general that a therapy success 

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:25.760
 in 70 to 80 percent of patients too 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:25.760
 is watching
