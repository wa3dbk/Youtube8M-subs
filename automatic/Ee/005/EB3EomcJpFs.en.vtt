00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:06.750
 so in this exercise we have to 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.090
 to build with diamonds we remember 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.380
 rhombus it 's a quad and the earth in 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.960
 the four sides are the same 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.700
 wavelength 1.2 in abc of texts 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.430
 that notice someone from centimeters and to 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.140
 sega 706 m then as usual for 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.289
 to imagine things well we can 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:25.550
 to make a show a scheme the lifting so 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.550
 for this rhombus 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:38.670
 so he's going to obke you abcd and you 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:42.110
 know that ab so we have 10 4 cm and its 7 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:46.969
 cm so pretty here it's a diagonal 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:50.210
 here diamond 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:52.620
 so this reminder when you want 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.750
 build a diamond 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.610
 you have to use one of these 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.070
 diagonals so in this case to that we 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:02.070
 know if that's okay we'll 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.320
 start is traced right here the segment 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:08.689
 enough and then basically it comes down to 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:13.920
 then build two isosceles triangle 

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:18.920
 gift that will be started with enough 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.920
 many at 10.7 cm 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:30.880
 here is 6.7 cm so always with 

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:32.320
 our dream 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.820
 this time we take our good step 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.679
 more than that we will build two 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.149
 triangles and so for everything better at 

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:39.399
 every time we have to use our 

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:45.490
 fight we sting in water and 3d 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:49.390
 need here 4 cm with will not find 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.350
 not we postpone this length your 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.030
 tickets here we have 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.299
 and then you make a first bow of 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:57.759
 circle you sting in c and you do 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:02:01.090
 a second pack or circles the only one to 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:02.530
 give you your point b we will even 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.599
 enjoy doing one thing from the other 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:08.170
 more legible side and many are the 

00:02:04.599 --> 00:02:10.420
 same so I fill that in art and I 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.950
 am another call from the service there is the 

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:13.950
 same thing on stage on the other side 

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:21.700
 the intersection here it's going to give you 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:25.989
 your point from here not the point break and 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:31.359
 saw it remains to trace the segments 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:42.430
 so staying here the segment b the segment 

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:45.120
 b it is the segment bc is the segment 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.120
 air 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:55.459
 as in our diagram we will complete 

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:57.080
 here with the codings for well-appointed 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:59.599
 we are dealing with a colleague on the ground at 4 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:04.220
 left side when so there ie 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:05.299
 diamond is here that attentive and that 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.489
 let this reconstruction 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:12.110
 we can notice that we had two 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:15.950
 repeated with salt the triangle here adc and 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:17.599
 then the triangle abc since that was the 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.670
 second question asks you to name 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:27.609
 the isosceles triangle so we'll say that 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:34.430
 the triangles yielded and lowered his 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:35.930
 innocence they tell themselves oh this way there 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.209
 so I still want to clarify a 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.879
 thing in principle when you are given 

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:42.200
 the name a rhombus the letters are only 

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:43.099
 not obliged to be in order 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.810
 alphabetical 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:49.870
 that is, you can very well 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:53.690
 have a rhombus that he's named air to 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.290
 ts and yet we do not have an order here 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:04:01.700
 alphabetical 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:04:05.109
 so if I'm not like that even my ts 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:07.720
 if I start with the letter then 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:14.060
 you have choice either you do next 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:18.200
 rst or tsr so even earlier 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:21.620
 like that w like that we are sure no 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:29.840
 problem so suppose you name it 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:33.410
 the wsr it's going that's bothering me too we're gonna 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:37.639
 take I think the injury to 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:40.130
 hips air awd you saw no matter 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:44.150
 where I take my first point to the 

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:45.860
 lamp the point here we do not have in 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.340
 politics because if you have to 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.510
 here imposes on the oral 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:50.430
 that we would have the country that will be 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:51.240
 second position and double in 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.639
 Last Position 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:56.540
 hence the extract in third position 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:59.490
 okay so when we saw a figure 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:01.949
 there is not necessarily one in the 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:04.500
 gallery of letters but in principle 

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:06.060
 we give you the world figure 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:08.190
 usually takes is the first is 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:10.320
 of the alphabet and after that have 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:12.479
 dropped but I'm talking 

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:15.030
 on the basis of exercises one can very 

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:17.040
 well see figure where we have a rafah 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:18.570
 mythical but remember how we 

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:22.110
 name a weight of the earth for example 

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:23.760
 you leave north then when you 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:25.320
 shave thin and month to each other well 

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:27.270
 you then put the other windows 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.800
 in uppercase 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:31.040
 so that was all for this chapter 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:35.930
 since it was the last exercise 

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:35.930
 especially what is the rule and the compass
