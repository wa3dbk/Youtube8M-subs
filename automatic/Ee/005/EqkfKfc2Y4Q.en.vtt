major<00:01:17.060> hull<00:01:17.360> damage<00:01:17.600> I<00:01:19.390> did<00:01:20.390> not<00:01:20.660> believe<00:01:20.870> that

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:21.050 
major hull damage I did not believe that

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:23.590 
major hull damage I did not believe that
the<00:01:21.440> sound<00:01:21.830> of<00:01:22.190> that<00:01:22.340> that<00:01:22.670> was<00:01:22.850> how<00:01:23.060> it<00:01:23.450> was

really<00:01:24.260> something<00:01:24.470> like<00:01:24.800> we're<00:01:25.040> mostly

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:25.370 
really something like we're mostly

looking I'm saying cosmetic yeah we were
expecting<00:01:28.100> gel<00:01:28.310> chipping<00:01:28.700> and<00:01:28.820> we<00:01:28.940> got

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 
expecting gel chipping and we got

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:30.550 
expecting gel chipping and we got
honestly<00:01:29.390> a<00:01:29.540> lot<00:01:29.720> less<00:01:29.960> than<00:01:30.140> I<00:01:30.200> thought<00:01:30.380> we

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
honestly a lot less than I thought we

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.350 
honestly a lot less than I thought we
would<00:01:30.590> this<00:01:30.860> is<00:01:31.010> probably<00:01:31.400> more<00:01:31.640> grinding<00:01:32.240> it

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
would this is probably more grinding it

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.270 
would this is probably more grinding it
bounced<00:01:32.570> three<00:01:32.930> times<00:01:33.229> yeah<00:01:33.530> yeah<00:01:33.740> went<00:01:34.130> back

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
bounced three times yeah yeah went back

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.430 
bounced three times yeah yeah went back
and<00:01:34.460> forth<00:01:34.670> and<00:01:34.910> you<00:01:35.420> know<00:01:35.450> we<00:01:35.600> had<00:01:35.750> a<00:01:35.780> fabulous

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:36.440

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:38.290 
and forth and you know we had a fabulous
bond<00:01:36.920> obviously<00:01:37.460> between<00:01:37.610> the<00:01:37.850> resin<00:01:38.119> and<00:01:38.240> the

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:38.300 
bond obviously between the resin and the

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:39.820 
bond obviously between the resin and the
Jo<00:01:38.510> coats<00:01:38.750> and<00:01:38.960> I<00:01:39.020> mean<00:01:39.170> it<00:01:39.290> really<00:01:39.320> can<00:01:39.680> held

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:39.830 
Jo coats and I mean it really can held

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:41.830 
Jo coats and I mean it really can held
up<00:01:39.979> well<00:01:40.190> and<00:01:40.850> then<00:01:41.210> you<00:01:41.420> can<00:01:41.450> see<00:01:41.630> right<00:01:41.810> there

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
up well and then you can see right there

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.570 
up well and then you can see right there
at<00:01:42.020> the<00:01:42.140> keel<00:01:42.350> and<00:01:42.590> sure<00:01:42.740> we<00:01:42.860> had<00:01:42.979> a<00:01:43.009> corner<00:01:43.430> low

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:43.580 
at the keel and sure we had a corner low

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.490 
at the keel and sure we had a corner low
two<00:01:43.640> point<00:01:44.030> load<00:01:44.180> right<00:01:44.420> there<00:01:44.630> but<00:01:45.140> it<00:01:45.259> still

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
two point load right there but it still

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.469 
two point load right there but it still
it<00:01:45.680> held<00:01:45.860> up<00:01:46.009> incredibly<00:01:46.340> well<00:01:46.640> very<00:01:47.300> very

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479

can see we got in excess of 75 G's of
the<00:01:51.440> Chuck<00:01:51.680> load<00:01:53.259> after<00:01:54.259> mounting<00:01:54.619> the

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:54.740 
the Chuck load after mounting the

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:56.290 
the Chuck load after mounting the
engines<00:01:55.100> on<00:01:55.250> the<00:01:55.340> tee<00:01:55.520> top<00:01:55.790> we<00:01:56.030> put<00:01:56.240> her

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:56.300 
engines on the tee top we put her

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.660 
engines on the tee top we put her
through<00:01:56.330> her<00:01:56.630> paces<00:01:56.869> the<00:01:57.710> smooth<00:01:58.009> ride<00:01:58.280> after

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
through her paces the smooth ride after

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.460 
through her paces the smooth ride after
our<00:01:58.790> extreme<00:01:59.149> drop<00:01:59.390> test<00:01:59.690> gave<00:01:59.930> me<00:02:00.050> all<00:02:00.200> the

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:00.470 
our extreme drop test gave me all the

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:01.930 
our extreme drop test gave me all the
confidence<00:02:00.619> a<00:02:01.100> sea<00:02:01.310> hunter<00:02:01.550> can<00:02:01.700> handle

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:01.940 
confidence a sea hunter can handle

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.920 
confidence a sea hunter can handle
anything<00:02:02.330> to<00:02:02.630> seek<00:02:02.869> a<00:02:03.020> dish<00:02:03.200> out<00:02:04.690> and<00:02:05.690> now<00:02:05.869> the

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:05.930 
anything to seek a dish out and now the

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.580 
anything to seek a dish out and now the
real<00:02:06.350> test

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
real test

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:10.979 
real test
broke<00:02:08.769> out<00:02:08.950> the<00:02:09.129> sauce<00:02:09.369> and<00:02:09.819> chopped<00:02:10.300> the<00:02:10.690> hull

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:10.989 
broke out the sauce and chopped the hull

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:18.510 
broke out the sauce and chopped the hull
into<00:02:11.709> the<00:02:12.670> crime

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.040 

so<00:02:19.520> it<00:02:19.700> was<00:02:19.880> back<00:02:20.150> to<00:02:20.180> the<00:02:20.360> water<00:02:20.630> to<00:02:20.840> prove

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
so it was back to the water to prove

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.810 
so it was back to the water to prove
once<00:02:21.380> and<00:02:21.530> for<00:02:21.740> all<00:02:21.770> a<00:02:21.890> sea<00:02:22.220> hundred<00:02:22.490> boat<00:02:22.640> is

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
once and for all a sea hundred boat is

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.020 
once and for all a sea hundred boat is
unsinkable<00:02:23.240> and<00:02:23.660> built<00:02:24.260> to<00:02:24.440> take<00:02:24.620> a<00:02:24.680> beating

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
unsinkable and built to take a beating

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.430 
unsinkable and built to take a beating
it's<00:02:26.030> not<00:02:26.180> nearly<00:02:26.420> as<00:02:26.510> scary<00:02:26.720> as<00:02:27.050> I<00:02:27.140> thought<00:02:27.170> it

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:27.440 
it's not nearly as scary as I thought it

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.910 
it's not nearly as scary as I thought it
was<00:02:27.500> going<00:02:27.710> to<00:02:27.770> be<00:02:27.860> yes<00:02:28.850> it<00:02:29.000> is<00:02:29.830> after<00:02:30.830> an

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
was going to be yes it is after an

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.280 
was going to be yes it is after an
impact<00:02:31.340> it<00:02:31.550> registered<00:02:31.970> over<00:02:32.150> 100<00:02:32.720> genes<00:02:32.960> and

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
impact it registered over 100 genes and

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.010 
impact it registered over 100 genes and
after<00:02:33.920> cutting<00:02:34.190> it<00:02:34.400> in<00:02:34.490> half<00:02:34.540> the<00:02:35.540> sea<00:02:35.780> hunter

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
after cutting it in half the sea hunter

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:37.630 
after cutting it in half the sea hunter
hull<00:02:36.230> proves<00:02:36.560> seaworthy<00:02:37.100> and<00:02:37.130> yet<00:02:37.400> another

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.640 
hull proves seaworthy and yet another

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.710 
hull proves seaworthy and yet another
test<00:02:38.000> drive<00:02:39.850> at<00:02:40.850> least<00:02:41.030> half<00:02:41.210> of<00:02:41.390> it<00:02:41.540> did

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
test drive at least half of it did

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:47.730
