some of the view

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.090 
some of the view
but<00:02:14.210> nonetheless<00:02:14.390> it<00:02:14.840> is<00:02:14.870> there<00:02:15.230> can't<00:02:16.010> really

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
but nonetheless it is there can't really

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.950 
but nonetheless it is there can't really
change<00:02:16.400> anything<00:02:16.700> about<00:02:16.850> it<00:02:17.150> just<00:02:17.360> gotta<00:02:17.510> you

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:17.960 
change anything about it just gotta you

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.650 
change anything about it just gotta you
know<00:02:18.080> take<00:02:18.830> up<00:02:18.950> the<00:02:19.070> great<00:02:19.340> grain<00:02:19.940> of<00:02:20.060> salt<00:02:20.180> it

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
know take up the great grain of salt it

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.960 
know take up the great grain of salt it
is<00:02:20.720> that<00:02:21.560> sea<00:02:21.890> but<00:02:22.100> it's<00:02:22.220> quite<00:02:22.400> nice<00:02:22.520> building

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
is that sea but it's quite nice building

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.760 
is that sea but it's quite nice building
I<00:02:23.090> mean<00:02:23.210> there's<00:02:23.720> worse<00:02:24.140> buildings<00:02:24.530> to<00:02:24.620> look

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
I mean there's worse buildings to look

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.770 
I mean there's worse buildings to look
at<00:02:24.890> in<00:02:24.980> GTA<00:02:25.250> 5<00:02:25.490> so<00:02:25.730> this<00:02:26.210> is<00:02:26.360> one<00:02:26.510> of<00:02:26.540> the<00:02:26.660> better

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
at in GTA 5 so this is one of the better

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.680 
at in GTA 5 so this is one of the better
views<00:02:27.080> but<00:02:27.560> that<00:02:28.010> building<00:02:28.370> still<00:02:28.610> a<00:02:28.640> cap<00:02:28.910> so

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
views but that building still a cap so

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.260 
views but that building still a cap so
that's<00:02:29.870> why<00:02:30.140> it<00:02:30.650> isn't<00:02:30.980> that<00:02:31.070> bad<00:02:31.460> and<00:02:31.940> that's

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
that's why it isn't that bad and that's

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.050 
that's why it isn't that bad and that's
one<00:02:32.660> of<00:02:32.720> the<00:02:32.780> reasons<00:02:32.990> why<00:02:33.140> I<00:02:33.170> have<00:02:33.260> it

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
one of the reasons why I have it

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.250 
one of the reasons why I have it
downstairs<00:02:35.060> views<00:02:35.540> are<00:02:35.690> just<00:02:35.720> the<00:02:35.990> same<00:02:36.200> as
