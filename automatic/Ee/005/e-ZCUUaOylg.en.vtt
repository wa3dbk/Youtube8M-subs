and<00:02:10.870> strong<00:02:11.870> in<00:02:12.700> here<00:02:13.700> because<00:02:14.510> it<00:02:14.780> was<00:02:14.930> too

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
and strong in here because it was too

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.660 
and strong in here because it was too
hard<00:02:15.410> not<00:02:15.709> so<00:02:15.920> I<00:02:16.010> played<00:02:16.310> and<00:02:17.269> then<00:02:17.810> 24

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:41.300 

like<00:02:21.670> this<00:02:22.030> here<00:02:22.950> great<00:02:23.950> let's<00:02:24.939> hear<00:02:25.150> it

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:47.210 

yeah<00:02:42.330> then<00:02:43.330> I'm<00:02:43.420> going<00:02:43.600> to<00:02:43.690> adjust<00:02:43.960> the<00:02:44.110> speed

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:53.070 

the<00:02:48.220> tempo<00:02:48.730> is<00:02:49.500> going<00:02:50.500> somewhere<00:02:50.800> around<00:02:52.080> 110

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:53.080 
the tempo is going somewhere around 110

00:02:53.080 --> 00:03:06.220 
the tempo is going somewhere around 110
I<00:02:53.110> think<00:02:54.120> this<00:02:55.920> we<00:02:56.920> can<00:02:57.070> hear<00:02:57.370> it<00:02:57.460> again

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:06.230 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:14.060 

fine<00:03:08.780> as<00:03:09.980> a<00:03:10.980> note<00:03:11.340> are<00:03:11.610> right<00:03:11.850> now<00:03:12.800> all<00:03:13.800> the

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
fine as a note are right now all the

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.580 
fine as a note are right now all the
note<00:03:14.280> in<00:03:14.490> each<00:03:14.730> code<00:03:15.090> are<00:03:15.360> played<00:03:15.840> at<00:03:15.870> exactly

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:16.590 
note in each code are played at exactly

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.680 
note in each code are played at exactly
the<00:03:16.710> same<00:03:16.740> time<00:03:17.030> what<00:03:18.030> I'm<00:03:18.150> going<00:03:18.180> to<00:03:18.360> do<00:03:18.540> is

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
the same time what I'm going to do is

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.450 
the same time what I'm going to do is
that<00:03:18.900> I'm<00:03:19.050> gonna<00:03:19.440> move<00:03:19.680> them<00:03:19.920> a<00:03:20.010> little<00:03:20.040> around

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:20.460 
that I'm gonna move them a little around

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:24.170 
that I'm gonna move them a little around
so<00:03:21.210> they<00:03:21.450> sound<00:03:21.780> more<00:03:21.870> human<00:03:22.530> I<00:03:22.940> like<00:03:23.940> this

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
so they sound more human I like this

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:30.170 
so they sound more human I like this
here<00:03:24.510> and<00:03:25.260> this<00:03:25.950> this<00:03:27.290> yes<00:03:28.290> I<00:03:28.560> think<00:03:28.710> that<00:03:29.490> will

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
here and this this yes I think that will

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:38.410 
here and this this yes I think that will
do<00:03:30.360> it

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:52.610 

you

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:52.620 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.680 

you
