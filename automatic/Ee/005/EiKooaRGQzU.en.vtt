at least once every month I get this ask
this<00:00:05.339> question<00:00:05.850> I<00:00:06.350> have<00:00:07.350> guys<00:00:07.740> that<00:00:07.820> race<00:00:08.820> it<00:00:08.970> a

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:09.030 
this question I have guys that race it a

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.629 
this question I have guys that race it a
few<00:00:09.210> racetracks<00:00:09.719> where<00:00:09.809> they<00:00:10.080> have<00:00:10.639> rules

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
few racetracks where they have rules

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:12.770 
few racetracks where they have rules
where<00:00:11.880> they're<00:00:12.030> trying<00:00:12.210> to<00:00:12.360> level<00:00:12.660> the

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
where they're trying to level the

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.690 
where they're trying to level the
competition<00:00:13.380> by<00:00:13.559> using<00:00:13.889> restrictor<00:00:14.460> plates

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:14.700 
competition by using restrictor plates

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.840 
competition by using restrictor plates
and<00:00:15.420> all<00:00:16.289> in<00:00:16.529> all<00:00:16.619> restrictor<00:00:17.250> plate<00:00:17.430> racing

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
and all in all restrictor plate racing

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.810 
and all in all restrictor plate racing
on<00:00:17.970> short<00:00:18.300> tracks<00:00:18.539> for<00:00:19.050> you<00:00:19.500> know<00:00:19.650> lower<00:00:19.890> ranks

on short tracks for you know lower ranks

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.490 
on short tracks for you know lower ranks
I<00:00:22.310> don't<00:00:23.310> see<00:00:23.609> it<00:00:23.730> as<00:00:23.970> being<00:00:24.330> a<00:00:24.539> bad<00:00:24.689> idea<00:00:24.750> a<00:00:25.320> lot

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
I don't see it as being a bad idea a lot

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.230 
I don't see it as being a bad idea a lot
of<00:00:25.560> people<00:00:25.920> would<00:00:26.070> argue<00:00:26.099> that<00:00:26.609> restrictor

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
of people would argue that restrictor

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.269 
of people would argue that restrictor
plates<00:00:27.480> on<00:00:27.630> super<00:00:27.930> speedways<00:00:28.320> and<00:00:28.560> NASCAR<00:00:28.949> is

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
plates on super speedways and NASCAR is

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.339 
plates on super speedways and NASCAR is
makes<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:30.000> racing<00:00:30.390> horrible<00:00:31.080> and

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
makes the racing horrible and

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.010 
makes the racing horrible and

but<00:00:34.020> I<00:00:34.050> think<00:00:34.380> on<00:00:34.530> a<00:00:34.559> you<00:00:35.340> know<00:00:35.489> for<00:00:35.700> a<00:00:35.730> local

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
but I think on a you know for a local

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.540 
but I think on a you know for a local
racer<00:00:36.420> on<00:00:36.630> a<00:00:36.719> local<00:00:37.020> level

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:37.550 
racer on a local level

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.520 
racer on a local level
in<00:00:38.550> a<00:00:38.730> street<00:00:39.000> stop<00:00:39.239> a<00:00:39.570> restrictor<00:00:40.320> plate

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
in a street stop a restrictor plate

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.880 
in a street stop a restrictor plate
could<00:00:40.860> actually<00:00:41.160> be<00:00:41.610> something<00:00:41.640> that<00:00:42.239> kind<00:00:42.510> of

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
could actually be something that kind of

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.500 
could actually be something that kind of
really<00:00:43.890> does<00:00:44.100> help<00:00:44.309> to<00:00:44.579> level<00:00:44.879> the<00:00:44.940> field<00:00:46.430> and

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:47.510 
really does help to level the field and

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.569 
really does help to level the field and
for<00:00:48.510> obvious<00:00:48.899> reasons<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:50.070> when<00:00:50.460> you're

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
for obvious reasons and when you're

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.090 
for obvious reasons and when you're
taking<00:00:51.090> horsepower<00:00:51.719> away<00:00:52.020> from<00:00:52.230> cars<00:00:52.469> on<00:00:52.739> on

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
taking horsepower away from cars on on

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.600 
taking horsepower away from cars on on
short<00:00:53.460> tracks<00:00:53.699> you're<00:00:53.969> doing<00:00:54.300> just<00:00:54.480> that<00:00:55.579> so<00:00:56.579> I

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
short tracks you're doing just that so I

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.549 
short tracks you're doing just that so I
always<00:00:56.910> get<00:00:57.180> asked<00:00:57.539> a<00:00:57.600> question<00:00:57.750> what<00:00:58.260> what

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
always get asked a question what what

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.540 
always get asked a question what what
should<00:00:58.739> we<00:00:58.890> do<00:00:59.100> to<00:00:59.399> combat<00:01:00.379> the<00:01:01.379> downside<00:01:02.370> to

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
should we do to combat the downside to

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.000 
should we do to combat the downside to
the<00:01:02.640> restrictor<00:01:03.090> plates<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.600> does<00:01:04.049> the<00:01:04.769> less

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
the restrictor plates the does the less

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.700 
the restrictor plates the does the less
air<00:01:05.250> that<00:01:05.580> gets<00:01:05.760> drawn<00:01:06.210> into<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.600> motor<00:01:06.810> which

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
air that gets drawn into the motor which

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.280 
air that gets drawn into the motor which
ultimately<00:01:08.159> means<00:01:08.760> less<00:01:09.090> fuel<00:01:09.390> which<00:01:09.840> means

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
ultimately means less fuel which means

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.969 
ultimately means less fuel which means
less<00:01:10.530> horsepower<00:01:11.990> so<00:01:12.990> let's<00:01:13.260> just<00:01:13.650> look<00:01:13.799> at<00:01:13.950> a

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
less horsepower so let's just look at a

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.530 
less horsepower so let's just look at a
couple<00:01:14.159> of<00:01:14.340> other<00:01:14.460> things<00:01:14.970> first<00:01:15.299> the

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
couple of other things first the

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.830 
couple of other things first the
reasoning<00:01:16.700> behind<00:01:17.700> using<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.390> restrictor

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
reasoning behind using the restrictor

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.890 
reasoning behind using the restrictor
plate<00:01:19.220> the<00:01:20.220> main<00:01:20.400> idea<00:01:20.820> that<00:01:21.360> I<00:01:21.390> heard<00:01:21.720> from

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
plate the main idea that I heard from

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.080 
plate the main idea that I heard from
most<00:01:22.140> promoters<00:01:22.619> is<00:01:22.770> that<00:01:22.950> they<00:01:23.159> chose<00:01:23.520> to<00:01:23.580> do

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
most promoters is that they chose to do

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.450 
most promoters is that they chose to do
the<00:01:24.240> restrictor<00:01:24.689> plate<00:01:24.900> to<00:01:25.259> cut<00:01:25.680> down<00:01:25.860> on<00:01:26.159> guys

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
the restrictor plate to cut down on guys

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.460 
the restrictor plate to cut down on guys
spending<00:01:26.939> 20<00:01:27.299> and<00:01:27.420> 30<00:01:27.600> thousand<00:01:28.049> dollars<00:01:28.080> on

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
spending 20 and 30 thousand dollars on

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.690 
spending 20 and 30 thousand dollars on
an<00:01:28.590> engine<00:01:29.030> which<00:01:31.100> is<00:01:32.100> probably<00:01:32.460> not<00:01:32.610> gonna

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
an engine which is probably not gonna

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.280 
an engine which is probably not gonna
happen<00:01:32.970> somebody<00:01:33.450> that<00:01:33.570> wants<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:33.780> win<00:01:34.020> is

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
happen somebody that wants to win is

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.780 
happen somebody that wants to win is
going<00:01:34.470> to<00:01:34.650> spend<00:01:34.950> as<00:01:35.040> much<00:01:35.189> money<00:01:35.250> as<00:01:35.640> they<00:01:35.759> can

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
going to spend as much money as they can

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.140 
going to spend as much money as they can
spend<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.950> to<00:01:37.950> win<00:01:38.159> at<00:01:38.340> whatever<00:01:38.490> cost<00:01:38.729> that's

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
spend to to win at whatever cost that's

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.969 
spend to to win at whatever cost that's
what<00:01:39.360> it<00:01:39.479> is<00:01:39.630> win<00:01:39.930> at<00:01:40.049> whatever<00:01:40.200> cost

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
what it is win at whatever cost

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.010 
what it is win at whatever cost
so<00:01:41.850> I<00:01:42.270> don't<00:01:42.810> think<00:01:43.049> it<00:01:43.140> really<00:01:43.259> cuts<00:01:43.649> down<00:01:43.740> on

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
so I don't think it really cuts down on

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.300 
so I don't think it really cuts down on
what<00:01:46.020> people<00:01:46.200> are<00:01:46.439> going<00:01:46.560> to<00:01:46.619> spend<00:01:46.950> what<00:01:47.189> it

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
what people are going to spend what it

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.789 
what people are going to spend what it
does<00:01:47.549> cut<00:01:47.880> down<00:01:47.909> on<00:01:48.360> is<00:01:49.079> it's<00:01:49.320> going<00:01:49.500> to<00:01:49.590> cut

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
does cut down on is it's going to cut

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.850 
does cut down on is it's going to cut
down<00:01:49.829> on<00:01:50.250> wear<00:01:50.460> and<00:01:50.610> tear<00:01:50.820> on<00:01:50.970> engines<00:01:51.860> it's

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
down on wear and tear on engines it's

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.850 
down on wear and tear on engines it's
not<00:01:53.130> going<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.430> allow<00:01:53.670> a<00:01:53.700> guy<00:01:53.970> that<00:01:54.270> has<00:01:54.479> a

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:54.860 
not going to allow a guy that has a

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:59.480 
not going to allow a guy that has a
$20,000<00:01:56.270> $30,000<00:01:57.270> 430<00:01:57.930> for<00:01:58.200> example<00:01:58.680> to<00:01:59.340> go

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
$20,000 $30,000 430 for example to go

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.840 
$20,000 $30,000 430 for example to go
out<00:01:59.670> there<00:01:59.909> and<00:02:00.210> blow<00:02:00.869> the<00:02:01.079> tires<00:02:01.320> off<00:02:01.649> and

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:01.850 
out there and blow the tires off and

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:04.719 
out there and blow the tires off and
disintegrate<00:02:02.850> an<00:02:03.000> engine

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
disintegrate an engine

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:06.850 
disintegrate an engine
and<00:02:04.939> then<00:02:05.540> have<00:02:05.720> to<00:02:05.869> go<00:02:05.960> back<00:02:05.990> and<00:02:06.350> build

and then have to go back and build

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.919 
and then have to go back and build
another<00:02:07.159> one<00:02:07.369> it's<00:02:07.610> gonna<00:02:07.790> limit<00:02:08.149> basically

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
another one it's gonna limit basically

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.410 
another one it's gonna limit basically
how<00:02:09.470> much<00:02:09.679> throttle<00:02:10.069> they<00:02:10.310> can<00:02:10.459> apply<00:02:10.700> to<00:02:11.120> the

teams<00:02:15.440> have<00:02:15.770> different<00:02:16.250> ideas<00:02:16.580> about<00:02:17.150> how<00:02:17.450> to

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
teams have different ideas about how to

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.460 
teams have different ideas about how to
combat<00:02:18.500> the<00:02:18.739> restrictor<00:02:19.220> plate<00:02:19.989> I've<00:02:20.989> never

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
combat the restrictor plate I've never

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.570 
combat the restrictor plate I've never
once<00:02:21.890> heard<00:02:22.780> anyone<00:02:23.780> say<00:02:24.230> that<00:02:25.010> they<00:02:25.190> wanted

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
once heard anyone say that they wanted

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.100 
once heard anyone say that they wanted
to<00:02:25.819> limit<00:02:26.600> the<00:02:27.380> air<00:02:27.819> that<00:02:28.819> goes<00:02:29.060> into<00:02:29.360> the<00:02:29.660> into

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.110 
to limit the air that goes into the into

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.100 
to limit the air that goes into the into
the<00:02:30.230> motor<00:02:31.150> so<00:02:32.150> you<00:02:32.239> have<00:02:32.390> to<00:02:32.510> look<00:02:32.690> at<00:02:32.810> it<00:02:32.930> like

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
the motor so you have to look at it like

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.360 
the motor so you have to look at it like
this<00:02:33.350> the<00:02:34.040> restrictor<00:02:34.519> plate<00:02:34.760> is<00:02:34.970> basically

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
this the restrictor plate is basically

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.040 
this the restrictor plate is basically
limiting<00:02:37.370> how<00:02:37.610> far<00:02:38.000> you<00:02:38.209> can<00:02:38.420> push<00:02:38.450> down<00:02:38.660> the

first<00:02:41.930> start<00:02:42.290> to<00:02:42.620> come<00:02:43.130> combat<00:02:43.730> that<00:02:43.940> problem

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:44.920 
first start to come combat that problem

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.110 
first start to come combat that problem
if<00:02:45.920> it<00:02:46.069> was<00:02:46.190> me<00:02:46.370> I<00:02:46.400> would<00:02:46.610> approach<00:02:46.850> it<00:02:46.910> by

if it was me I would approach it by

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.000 
if it was me I would approach it by
looking<00:02:47.239> at<00:02:47.480> the<00:02:47.630> intake<00:02:47.959> first<00:02:48.319> control<00:02:48.799> your

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
you didn't have a restrictor plate so

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.030 
you didn't have a restrictor plate so
