00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:28.880 
hope that we will be win against Russia

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.240 
hope that we will be win against Russia
because<00:00:29.270> this<00:00:29.689> game<00:00:29.869> is<00:00:29.930> for<00:00:30.830> us<00:00:30.980> very

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:31.250 
because this game is for us very

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.700 
because this game is for us very
important<00:00:31.789> so<00:00:32.180> this<00:00:32.750> game<00:00:32.989> was<00:00:33.020> important

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710 
important so this game was important

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:35.710 
important so this game was important
because<00:00:33.860> of<00:00:34.100> the<00:00:34.220> fence<00:00:34.430> you<00:00:35.059> also<00:00:35.210> play

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:35.720 
because of the fence you also play

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.780 
because of the fence you also play
ingress<00:00:36.320> of<00:00:36.440> against<00:00:37.010> Poland<00:00:37.430> this<00:00:37.550> is<00:00:37.699> the

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:37.790 
ingress of against Poland this is the

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:39.549 
ingress of against Poland this is the
last<00:00:37.940> game<00:00:38.210> would<00:00:38.510> we<00:00:38.660> expect<00:00:39.020> before<00:00:39.320> the

00:00:39.549 --> 00:00:39.559 
last game would we expect before the

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:42.549 
last game would we expect before the
last<00:00:39.710> game<00:00:40.090> with<00:00:41.090> Poland<00:00:41.449> you'll<00:00:41.930> see<00:00:42.110> we<00:00:42.379> will

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:42.559 
last game with Poland you'll see we will

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:44.470 
last game with Poland you'll see we will
see<00:00:42.680> i<00:00:42.710> think<00:00:43.010> that<00:00:43.160> the<00:00:43.520> Poland<00:00:43.820> will<00:00:44.180> be<00:00:44.330> the

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480 
see i think that the Poland will be the

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:45.939 
see i think that the Poland will be the
very<00:00:44.690> strong<00:00:44.960> team<00:00:45.170> because<00:00:45.650> they<00:00:45.770> have<00:00:45.920> a

00:00:45.939 --> 00:00:45.949 
very strong team because they have a

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:48.700 
very strong team because they have a
very<00:00:46.309> good<00:00:46.460> place<00:00:46.670> from<00:00:46.850> Dortmund<00:00:47.329> so<00:00:47.930> they

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:48.710 
very good place from Dortmund so they

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.000 
very good place from Dortmund so they
they<00:00:49.100> will<00:00:49.310> be<00:00:49.430> play<00:00:49.640> home<00:00:49.820> so<00:00:50.660> I<00:00:50.989> expect<00:00:51.890> that

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
they will be play home so I expect that

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.069 
they will be play home so I expect that
this<00:00:52.370> game<00:00:52.579> will<00:00:52.730> be<00:00:52.880> very<00:00:53.059> very<00:00:53.239> difficult<00:00:53.420> if

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:54.079 
this game will be very very difficult if

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:56.049 
this game will be very very difficult if
you<00:00:54.230> would<00:00:54.410> have<00:00:54.440> to<00:00:54.739> say<00:00:54.920> the<00:00:55.220> strongest<00:00:55.670> and

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
you would have to say the strongest and

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:57.639 
you would have to say the strongest and
weakest<00:00:56.390> points<00:00:56.690> of<00:00:56.780> check<00:00:57.079> team<00:00:57.320> right<00:00:57.620> now

00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:57.649 
weakest points of check team right now

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:02.020 
weakest points of check team right now
just<00:00:58.100> a<00:00:58.489> week<00:00:58.850> before<00:00:58.880> euro<00:00:59.680> not<00:01:00.680> that<00:01:00.800> I<00:01:01.309> think

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
just a week before euro not that I think

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:03.520 
just a week before euro not that I think
that<00:01:02.149> we<00:01:02.300> are<00:01:02.420> reveals<00:01:02.840> drunk<00:01:03.079> like<00:01:03.200> a<00:01:03.260> team

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
that we are reveals drunk like a team

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.830 
that we are reveals drunk like a team
that<00:01:04.100> we<00:01:04.580> don't<00:01:04.729> have<00:01:04.850> this<00:01:05.000> some<00:01:05.210> biggest

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
that we don't have this some biggest

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.230 
that we don't have this some biggest
players<00:01:06.080> just<00:01:06.560> resist<00:01:07.040> can<00:01:07.220> borrow<00:01:07.460> rarest

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
players just resist can borrow rarest

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.480 
players just resist can borrow rarest
and<00:01:08.450> check<00:01:08.930> so<00:01:09.710> we<00:01:09.740> must<00:01:10.040> play<00:01:10.190> like<00:01:10.340> a<00:01:10.369> team

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
and check so we must play like a team

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.930 
and check so we must play like a team
and<00:01:10.820> I<00:01:11.090> think<00:01:11.390> that<00:01:11.540> we<00:01:12.070> pass<00:01:13.070> for<00:01:13.640> the<00:01:13.729> Europe

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:13.940 
and I think that we pass for the Europe

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.840 
and I think that we pass for the Europe
because<00:01:14.720> of<00:01:14.899> this<00:01:15.020> and<00:01:15.950> what<00:01:16.220> do<00:01:16.310> you<00:01:16.460> expect

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
because of this and what do you expect

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.090 
because of this and what do you expect
from<00:01:17.390> rostov<00:01:18.020> has<00:01:18.140> a<00:01:18.170> host<00:01:18.380> city<00:01:18.740> you<00:01:18.920> gotta

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
from rostov has a host city you gotta

from rostov has a host city you gotta
stay<00:01:19.340> there<00:01:19.549> for<00:01:19.820> maybe<00:01:20.119> more<00:01:20.600> than<00:01:20.810> a<00:01:21.049> week

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700

and so we will be success that on the

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.950 
and so we will be success that on the
last<00:01:40.159> think<00:01:40.549> about<00:01:40.760> the<00:01:40.909> team<00:01:41.090> it<00:01:41.450> seems<00:01:41.750> like

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.330 
the the biggest concern now is if

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.680 
the the biggest concern now is if
receipts<00:01:44.750> ki<00:01:44.900> will<00:01:45.049> come<00:01:45.290> back<00:01:45.439> to<00:01:45.590> the<00:01:45.710> game
