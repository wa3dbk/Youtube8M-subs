00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
it's missing in a minute when I pull it

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.680 
it's missing in a minute when I pull it
down<00:01:56.990> into<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.110> light<00:01:58.290> better

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.600 

okay<00:02:01.680> let's<00:02:02.010> move<00:02:02.250> them<00:02:02.520> down<00:02:04.130> these<00:02:05.130> first

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
okay let's move them down these first

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.170 
okay let's move them down these first
two<00:02:05.820> units<00:02:06.330> i<00:02:06.570> have<00:02:06.900> DCC<00:02:07.710> decoders<00:02:08.369> in<00:02:08.640> them<00:02:08.760> so

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:09.180 
two units i have DCC decoders in them so

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:12.680 
two units i have DCC decoders in them so
i'm<00:02:09.869> running<00:02:10.260> it<00:02:10.380> on<00:02:10.730> variable<00:02:11.730> DC<00:02:11.970> so<00:02:12.540> it

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
i'm running it on variable DC so it

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.170 
i'm running it on variable DC so it
takes<00:02:12.930> like<00:02:13.410> four<00:02:14.070> or<00:02:14.220> five<00:02:14.280> volts<00:02:14.940> in<00:02:15.090> the

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
takes like four or five volts in the

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.660 
takes like four or five volts in the
track<00:02:15.480> before<00:02:15.870> it<00:02:16.140> wakes<00:02:16.290> them<00:02:16.590> up<00:02:16.770> so

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
track before it wakes them up so

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.160 
track before it wakes them up so
sometimes<00:02:18.270> I<00:02:18.450> have<00:02:18.600> a<00:02:18.630> little<00:02:18.840> trouble

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
sometimes I have a little trouble

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.850 
sometimes I have a little trouble
getting<00:02:19.470> them<00:02:19.680> going<00:02:19.710> here<00:02:21.170> there<00:02:22.170> we<00:02:22.470> go<00:02:22.620> yep

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
getting them going here there we go yep

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.400 
getting them going here there we go yep
see<00:02:23.220> how<00:02:23.310> the<00:02:23.370> lights<00:02:23.670> blinking<00:02:24.240> there<00:02:25.080> we<00:02:25.260> go

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
see how the lights blinking there we go

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.320 
see how the lights blinking there we go
the<00:02:26.250> last<00:02:26.520> one<00:02:26.880> is<00:02:28.040> does<00:02:29.040> not<00:02:29.070> have<00:02:29.520> DCC<00:02:30.180> it's

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
the last one is does not have DCC it's

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.120 
the last one is does not have DCC it's
just<00:02:30.540> regular<00:02:30.720> DC<00:02:31.730> but<00:02:32.730> you<00:02:33.120> can<00:02:33.360> see<00:02:33.660> the<00:02:34.130> some
