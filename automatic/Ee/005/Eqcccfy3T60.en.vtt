couple days ago I've been waiting for
this<00:00:09.929> system<00:00:10.290> for<00:00:10.469> a<00:00:10.530> few<00:00:10.620> years<00:00:11.130> now<00:00:11.219> and<00:00:11.550> so<00:00:11.940> I

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
this system for a few years now and so I

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.700 
this system for a few years now and so I
got<00:00:12.150> the<00:00:12.269> ps4<00:00:12.570> and<00:00:13.080> I<00:00:13.139> had<00:00:13.290> it<00:00:13.410> for<00:00:13.590> about

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
got the ps4 and I had it for about

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
going to explain my particular problem I

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.189 
going to explain my particular problem I
think<00:00:17.760> my<00:00:17.970> problem<00:00:18.420> is<00:00:18.449> kind<00:00:18.779> of<00:00:18.869> targeted

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
think my problem is kind of targeted

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.290 
think my problem is kind of targeted
towards<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.500> HDMI<00:00:20.189> port<00:00:20.550> which<00:00:20.730> a<00:00:21.029> lot<00:00:21.210> of

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
towards the HDMI port which a lot of

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.120 
towards the HDMI port which a lot of
people<00:00:21.539> are<00:00:21.630> having<00:00:21.960> so<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.410> system<00:00:22.740> boots<00:00:22.949> up

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
people are having so the system boots up

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.160 
people are having so the system boots up
like<00:00:23.369> normally<00:00:23.820> and<00:00:23.970> it<00:00:24.060> works<00:00:24.359> I<00:00:24.600> can<00:00:24.630> eject

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
like normally and it works I can eject

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.990 
like normally and it works I can eject
the<00:00:25.320> disc<00:00:25.560> I<00:00:25.680> can<00:00:25.830> put<00:00:25.949> a<00:00:25.980> disc<00:00:26.220> in<00:00:26.430> I<00:00:26.640> mean<00:00:26.910> it

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
the disc I can put a disc in I mean it

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.670 
the disc I can put a disc in I mean it
works<00:00:27.300> but<00:00:27.570> it's<00:00:27.660> just<00:00:27.779> not<00:00:27.960> sending<00:00:28.289> any<00:00:28.470> type

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
works but it's just not sending any type

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.669 
works but it's just not sending any type
of<00:00:28.710> signal<00:00:29.220> to<00:00:29.400> my<00:00:29.580> HDTV<00:00:30.150> via<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.109> HDMI<00:00:31.230> port

where there's a vent little piece of

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.080 
where there's a vent little piece of
metal<00:00:35.160> inside<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.550> port<00:00:35.790> that<00:00:35.850> you<00:00:35.969> actually

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
metal inside the port that you actually

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.520 
metal inside the port that you actually
need<00:00:36.329> to<00:00:36.390> get<00:00:36.480> in<00:00:36.600> there<00:00:36.719> with<00:00:37.140> the<00:00:37.260> pin<00:00:37.500> and

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.920 
luck with that or they'll probably send
you<00:01:16.110> on<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.290> box<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:16.890> ship<00:01:17.070> your<00:01:17.670> ps4<00:01:18.210> back<00:01:18.720> to

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
you on a box to ship your ps4 back to

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.240 
you on a box to ship your ps4 back to
them<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.290> they're<00:01:19.380> gonna<00:01:19.530> repair<00:01:20.009> it<00:01:20.130> I'm

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
them and they're gonna repair it I'm

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:21.890 
them and they're gonna repair it I'm
thinking<00:01:20.520> not<00:01:21.030> replacing<00:01:21.570> but<00:01:21.689> just<00:01:21.810> go<00:01:21.869> ahead

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
thinking not replacing but just go ahead

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.600 
thinking not replacing but just go ahead
and<00:01:22.080> repair<00:01:22.380> it<00:01:22.530> and<00:01:22.680> send<00:01:22.890> it<00:01:23.009> back<00:01:23.250> to<00:01:23.280> you

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
and repair it and send it back to you

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.149 
and repair it and send it back to you
and<00:01:24.330> I'll<00:01:24.689> probably<00:01:24.930> take<00:01:25.140> around<00:01:25.350> 30<00:01:25.590> days<00:01:25.890> at

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
and I'll probably take around 30 days at

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.859 
and I'll probably take around 30 days at
least<00:01:26.520> for<00:01:26.759> that<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:27.030> happen<00:01:27.180> so<00:01:27.420> bottom<00:01:27.750> line

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869
