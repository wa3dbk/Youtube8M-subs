00:00:00.879 --> 00:00:04.850
 As you know, I dedicate myself more to commenting on videos and I only make videos 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:08.249
 for imbeciles who do not have the fucking idea of ​​what they're talking about 

00:00:08.249 --> 00:00:11.619
 I just watched the video of ya much superbike 

00:00:11.619 --> 00:00:13.549
 sorry super saiyan 

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:16.949
 and it upset me that he said the anime is not caricature 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.570
 we'll see 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:21.910
 a caricature of the Italian caricare 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:26.750
 that is to exaggerate is a portrait that exaggerates or distorts the appearance 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.650
 Physics of one person or several to create a resemblance easily 

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:32.600
 identifiable 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.750
 and generally humorous 

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:37.260
 It can also be allegories 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.650
 the usual technique of caricature is based on collecting the most marked features 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:46.710
 of a person eyebrow lips and so on and exaggerate the way they cause 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.800
 comedy 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.290
 thing that the manga also does 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.180
 the caricature as an artistic genre is usually a portrait of another 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:59.359
 humorous representation that exaggerates physical or facial features 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:02.709
 the dress ovi in ​​behavioral aspects or manners 

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:07.220
 characteristic of an individual in order to produce a brothers effect 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.000
 the caricature can also be the means of ridiculing situations 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.350
 social or religious political institutions and acts of groups or 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.910
 social classes 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:22.260
 although the term caricature is extendable to exaggerations by means of 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.180
 of the verbal description its use that gives generally restricted to the 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.290
 graphic representations 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:30.700
 or a drawing 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.110
 the drawing is a visual art in which various means are used to represent 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.950
 something in a medium that tim in senate 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.590
 The most common materials are graphite pencils the pen 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.590
 fountain pen you will be charcoal etc. 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.690
 more than a graphic technique based on the use of the line the drawing is the 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.080
 expression of an image that is done manually that is to say the hand is used 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:54.360
 to do it 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.840
 The materials that can be used are as many as the surface where 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.080
 Can be done 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:03.830
 the most used are paper as a support and the pencil as the instrument 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.710
 but currently the computer is used using an optical pen or a 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:11.169
 mouse 

00:02:11.169 --> 00:02:14.809
 and so you know and wide and I think it's a little bit of chavalillo 

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:19.779
 all that is the anime cartoon manga carpani tuft caricature like 

00:02:19.779 --> 00:02:21.929
 you call him or we call him all 

00:02:21.929 --> 00:02:26.089
 has its origin of the stroke in the role of an image is really the same or 

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:30.369
 distorted to highlight effects either by achieving amazement as I said before 

00:02:30.369 --> 00:02:34.189
 comic and is globally and call caricature to all drawing 

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:38.469
 although the most appropriate term for your anime and western cartoons is 

00:02:38.469 --> 00:02:40.179
 the same 

00:02:40.179 --> 00:02:42.539
 that is, cartoons 

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:46.539
 since the anime is not anything different from the simpsons according to you say what 

00:02:46.539 --> 00:02:50.779
 opposite, since only the different techniques and ideas are the same 

00:02:50.779 --> 00:02:55.009
 they express each one has different themes only that you think that by the 

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:56.539
 sea ​​is anime is something else 

00:02:56.539 --> 00:02:59.539
 but at the end of the day it's just a cartoon 

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:04.959
 anime is the term that groups cartoons of Japanese origin 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:08.319
 and to a certain degree the related elements 

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:12.429
 outside of Japan the term can refer to what was said above but 

00:03:12.429 --> 00:03:16.059
 within this country the term is taken to refer to the animation in 

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:19.789
 general or as I told you before cartoon cocoon 

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:24.409
 the term anime comes from the abbreviation of the transcript 

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:27.309
 Japanese of the English word animation 

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:31.809
 in japan is the word animation is read anime chon and his writing in letters 

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:33.449
 latinas is 

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:37.769
 however in English the word animation can not be abbreviated anime 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:40.769
 since the in is not part of the original word 

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:45.409
 for this reason in the West it was deduced that it should come from another language 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:50.340
 and this is how the theory of the French anime term is born animated 

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:56.099
 in one way or another the Latin word animal that say soul and drift in 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:04:00.609
 words like animism animation and anime all related to the 

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:04.419
 idea of ​​movement or life of things that originally do not possess 

00:04:04.419 --> 00:04:07.699
 the anime story the animation genre of Japanese origin 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.409
 begins in the 20th century with a series of short films similar to 

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:17.049
 found in other countries like united states russia germany france 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:19.590
 among others 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.900
 influenced by the works of walt disney and warner the two great schools 

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:27.650
 of American animation feed this current combined with the manga 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.449
 traditional Japanese that is nothing more than the name given to comics 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:35.210
 Manga in Japanese is something like continuous drawings 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:36.580
 one of the pioneers 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.750
 mistakenly considered by many as the creator of the anime is the great 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.479
 master osamu tezuka 

00:04:43.479 --> 00:04:47.879
 creator of the famous series astro boy being the first nor issued me as 

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:48.430
 series 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:52.680
 with details that would mark history as elongated legs or large 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:53.469
 eyes 

00:04:53.469 --> 00:04:57.899
 although it was recently discovered that the first Japanese animation was in 

00:04:57.899 --> 00:05:02.929
 1907 in which you can see a child sailor who write kanji katsuhiko 

00:05:02.929 --> 00:05:05.990
 chacín taking off his hat and waving 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.760
 the same could not be said that it is an anime since it is only one 

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:12.839
 few seconds animation 

00:05:12.839 --> 00:05:16.319
 you can investigate this in 'google' if you do not believe me that wide 

00:05:16.319 --> 00:05:19.059
 but that would be all I can teach you 

00:05:19.059 --> 00:05:23.859
 or at least let you clear a painted drawing on paper with 

00:05:23.859 --> 00:05:26.830
 animation is just that a cartoon 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:30.360
 but I understand your idea for you an animation that has more resources 

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:35.370
 more financing special effects ceases to be so if you compare it to those who 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:38.469
 show on cartoon network 

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:42.620
 and good when you speak I ask you with all my heart to do it at least as 

00:05:42.619 --> 00:05:47.099
 fucking friends of yours who at least come with fundamentals but always 

00:05:47.099 --> 00:05:51.029
 wrong but at least they stand up well and come out with their heads held high 

00:05:51.029 --> 00:05:52.449
 after a video 

00:05:52.449 --> 00:05:56.330
 I say goodbye with a greeting to all my friends what numbers and if they suspend me 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:00.750
 this video is one more sample that the administre obtained they do not watch them only 

00:06:00.749 --> 00:06:04.099
 it is enough for them to be marked and 

00:06:04.099 --> 00:06:08.419
 I'll say goodbye until my next video and I hope to have 

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:12.710
 expressed well and I apologize for the lack of images in this video 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:13.280
 goodbye
