of<00:01:06.369> what<00:01:06.550> you<00:01:06.670> mean<00:01:06.820> to<00:01:06.970> this<00:01:07.090> game<00:01:07.500> well<00:01:08.500> i

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 
of what you mean to this game well i

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.109 
of what you mean to this game well i
think<00:01:08.740> it<00:01:08.979> was<00:01:09.070> obvious<00:01:09.460> from<00:01:09.490> the<00:01:09.759> start<00:01:09.790> that

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:10.119 
think it was obvious from the start that

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:11.460 
think it was obvious from the start that
there<00:01:10.330> was<00:01:10.450> going<00:01:10.630> to<00:01:10.720> be<00:01:10.750> a<00:01:10.810> bit<00:01:11.020> of<00:01:11.110> violence

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470 
there was going to be a bit of violence

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.469 
there was going to be a bit of violence
coming<00:01:11.800> particularly<00:01:12.190> i<00:01:12.400> think<00:01:12.670> from<00:01:12.820> the<00:01:13.000> the

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:13.479 
coming particularly i think from the the

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:16.109 
coming particularly i think from the the
Uruguayan's<00:01:14.200> but<00:01:14.740> at<00:01:14.920> foul<00:01:15.250> really<00:01:15.880> did

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:16.119 
Uruguayan's but at foul really did

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:18.630 
Uruguayan's but at foul really did
deserve<00:01:16.300> a<00:01:16.810> red<00:01:16.990> card<00:01:17.290> in<00:01:17.590> any<00:01:17.890> book<00:01:18.130> he'll<00:01:18.520> be

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
deserve a red card in any book he'll be

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.490 
deserve a red card in any book he'll be
disappointed<00:01:18.820> but<00:01:19.750> that's<00:01:19.930> the<00:01:20.110> way<00:01:20.200> that<00:01:20.380> the

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
disappointed but that's the way that the

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:21.719 
disappointed but that's the way that the
play<00:01:20.680> that<00:01:20.800> gave<00:01:20.979> you<00:01:21.160> they're<00:01:21.340> trying<00:01:21.640> to

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:21.729

intimidate the Scottish players from the

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:25.170 
intimidate the Scottish players from the
start<00:01:24.070> they're<00:01:24.280> trying<00:01:24.490> to<00:01:24.580> intimidate<00:01:24.850> the

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:25.180 
start they're trying to intimidate the

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:26.609 
start they're trying to intimidate the
referee<00:01:25.210> they're<00:01:25.690> even<00:01:25.899> pushing<00:01:26.200> her<00:01:26.470> out<00:01:26.500> a

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:26.619 
referee they're even pushing her out a

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:28.260 
referee they're even pushing her out a
little<00:01:26.740> bit<00:01:26.950> now<00:01:27.130> it<00:01:27.430> is<00:01:27.940> a<00:01:27.970> fantastic

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
little bit now it is a fantastic

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.480 
little bit now it is a fantastic
decision<00:01:28.990> for<00:01:29.229> the<00:01:29.350> referee<00:01:29.710> and<00:01:29.950> i<00:01:30.250> think

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
decision for the referee and i think

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.490 
decision for the referee and i think
it's<00:01:30.640> it's<00:01:30.940> great<00:01:31.390> for<00:01:31.600> world<00:01:31.810> football<00:01:32.320> if

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500
