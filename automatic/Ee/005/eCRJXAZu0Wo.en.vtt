Bournemouth<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.369> really<00:01:14.369> really<00:01:14.640> went<00:01:14.820> at

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
Bournemouth and really really went at

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.999 
Bournemouth and really really went at
them<00:01:15.210> that<00:01:15.659> will<00:01:15.810> be<00:01:15.930> one<00:01:15.960> force<00:01:16.380> change<00:01:16.740> I

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
them that will be one force change I

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.649 
them that will be one force change I
think<00:01:17.340> soul<00:01:17.549> bambor<00:01:17.909> will<00:01:18.060> make<00:01:18.240> his<00:01:18.450> debut

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
think soul bambor will make his debut

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.960 
think soul bambor will make his debut
because<00:01:19.140> Belushi's<00:01:19.619> out<00:01:19.770> for<00:01:20.040> two<00:01:20.400> games<00:01:20.670> now

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
because Belushi's out for two games now

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.490 
because Belushi's out for two games now
otherwise<00:01:21.630> I<00:01:21.750> think<00:01:21.930> they'll<00:01:22.470> be

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
otherwise I think they'll be

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.980 
otherwise I think they'll be
hard-pressed<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:23.220> making<00:01:23.490> any<00:01:23.729> changes<00:01:23.990> so

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
hard-pressed to making any changes so

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.600 
hard-pressed to making any changes so

the truth it's a big okay it's an event
when<00:02:35.459> leads<00:02:35.670> play<00:02:35.970> but<00:02:36.480> I<00:02:36.510> have<00:02:36.689> to<00:02:36.840> say<00:02:36.870> this

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
when leads play but I have to say this

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.160 
when leads play but I have to say this
it<00:02:38.010> is<00:02:38.159> about<00:02:38.370> the<00:02:38.879> victory<00:02:39.329> and<00:02:39.480> getting<00:02:39.900> back

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
it is about the victory and getting back

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.720 
it is about the victory and getting back
to<00:02:40.319> winning<00:02:40.439> ways<00:02:40.590> fully<00:02:41.099> denied<00:02:41.340> it<00:02:41.459> away

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
to winning ways fully denied it away

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:43.009 
to winning ways fully denied it away
from<00:02:41.970> homes<00:02:42.180> that's<00:02:42.450> the<00:02:42.629> important<00:02:42.989> thing

00:02:43.009 --> 00:02:43.019 
from homes that's the important thing

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:46.399 
from homes that's the important thing
and<00:02:43.290> of<00:02:43.650> course<00:02:43.680> just<00:02:44.340> moving<00:02:44.670> away<00:02:44.790> from<00:02:45.510> the

00:02:46.399 --> 00:02:46.409 
and of course just moving away from the

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:47.990 
and of course just moving away from the
perilous<00:02:46.920> position<00:02:47.069> it<00:02:47.370> looked<00:02:47.519> like<00:02:47.609> a<00:02:47.670> few<00:02:47.970> a

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
perilous position it looked like a few a

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.789 
perilous position it looked like a few a
few<00:02:48.120> weeks<00:02:48.420> ago<00:02:48.599> from<00:02:48.900> the<00:02:49.019> bottom<00:02:49.319> three<00:02:49.500> and

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
few weeks ago from the bottom three and

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:52.220 
few weeks ago from the bottom three and
so<00:02:50.639> for<00:02:50.849> me<00:02:51.000> it's<00:02:51.299> important<00:02:51.930> for<00:02:52.049> those

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
so for me it's important for those

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.809 
so for me it's important for those
reasons<00:02:52.470> like<00:02:52.799> we've<00:02:52.980> got<00:02:53.220> to<00:02:53.400> start<00:02:53.609> winning

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
reasons like we've got to start winning

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:55.129 
reasons like we've got to start winning
on<00:02:54.000> the<00:02:54.030> road<00:02:54.120> because<00:02:54.389> there's<00:02:54.720> some<00:02:54.810> big

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:55.139 
on the road because there's some big

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:58.640 
on the road because there's some big
away<00:02:55.470> long<00:02:56.159> trips<00:02:56.549> reading<00:02:57.079> bright<00:02:58.079> and<00:02:58.319> full

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
away long trips reading bright and full

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.110 
away long trips reading bright and full
of<00:02:58.709> all<00:02:58.889> to<00:02:59.040> be<00:02:59.129> done<00:02:59.250> in<00:02:59.370> midweek<00:02:59.609> and<00:02:59.819> a<00:02:59.939> trip

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
of all to be done in midweek and a trip

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.339 
of all to be done in midweek and a trip
to<00:03:00.150> Middlesbrough<00:03:00.629> as<00:03:00.720> well<00:03:00.870> so<00:03:00.989> they<00:03:01.079> need<00:03:01.230> to

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:01.349 
to Middlesbrough as well so they need to

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:02.720 
to Middlesbrough as well so they need to
start<00:03:01.560> learning<00:03:01.680> to<00:03:01.859> win<00:03:02.040> away<00:03:02.220> from<00:03:02.280> home<00:03:02.519> now

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
start learning to win away from home now

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.270 
start learning to win away from home now
so<00:03:03.150> for<00:03:03.389> the<00:03:03.480> Derby<00:03:03.870> just<00:03:04.290> identify<00:03:04.680> one<00:03:04.980> key

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
so for the Derby just identify one key

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:08.750 
so for the Derby just identify one key

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:39.359 
the rest of the season so finally who

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:41.569 
the rest of the season so finally who
needs<00:03:39.629> the<00:03:39.840> three<00:03:40.079> points<00:03:40.440> more<00:03:40.709> what<00:03:41.489> is

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
needs the three points more what is

needs the three points more what is
filled<00:03:41.790> early<00:03:42.139> I'll<00:03:43.139> take<00:03:43.470> them<00:03:43.680> when<00:03:43.829> town

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040

get<00:03:44.250> on<00:03:44.340> but<00:03:44.459> I<00:03:44.519> think<00:03:44.699> leads<00:03:44.849> need<00:03:45.150> two<00:03:45.269> points

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540
