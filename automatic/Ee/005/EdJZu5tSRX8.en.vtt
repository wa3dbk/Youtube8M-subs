00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.090
 the Mauerpark Berlin 

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:04.680
 For many a place of recreation of sports 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.670
 but also creativity 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:09.819
 on the border to friedrich-ludwig-jahn-sportpark 

00:00:09.819 --> 00:00:12.899
 stands a 200 meter long Brinkhoff DDR 

00:00:13.579 --> 00:00:17.109
 a piece of the so-called blood diamonds received is unique 

00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:21.619
 since the turn 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:25.019
 a friendly man hit Daniel Carlberg 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.130
 Karben 01 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.749
 that's Bernd Heimerl he writes 

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:31.779
 that came from the tape 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:34.559
 the district St Vienna 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.590
 but banned since this year 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.180
 it is the talk of the dead and injured 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.149
 he has spray cans left over it and even of conservation 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:49.100
 Since neither the police nor the district office can provide more accurate information remains 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.100
 affected space to speculation 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.070
 Christian Resch 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:56.600
 Chairman of Crichton Concert Hall 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.190
 Even the guesswork of the club is in public art 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:01.680
 Room 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.970
 so also for Krefeld the artists 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.130
 We end 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:07.250
 have a wall 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:08.840
 a hotel 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.940
 he speaks I tried once 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.500
 also public prayer 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.720
 but that does not care that Saleh diesel share Solinger 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.970
 and usage is released 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.140
 um has permission for this 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.810
 and everybody and Manuela can call me 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.510
 Zerbst Roman Wallner 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:26.650
 There are relatively quiet bands 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.850
 to get then for the city and the permit 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.090
 unimpressed 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.090
 explained there to Baden and Bernkastel drunk 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.130
 good with our commitment 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.820
 pm the exact reasons why now the band is cheaper in the place l 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.210
 I dont know 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.210
 It could be more imaginable that there was cleanliness there 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.979
 that the graffiti sprayers have left their garbage that keeps the city 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.410
 has annoyed 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:56.250
 m and she stops 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.940
 did not really try to find other solutions 

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.380
 the mountain slopes suffered from infection 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.890
 because worldwide 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.379
 a landmark of the city 

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:11.379
 why do you stop 

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:19.379
 Dianne Feinstein until 20 so even takes the long way from Spandau to the nature park 

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:21.379
 Schöneberg south area in purchase 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:23.219
 to enter legally 

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:27.539
 the headset broke with the situation in the tower this is the only legal room 

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:28.109
 on 

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:30.819
 and not necessarily so sparkling Dammann 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:34.349
 safe alternative way too big and mostly 

00:02:34.899 --> 00:02:38.159
 this is not the case here 

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:41.539
 What is the special charm I personally have in mind 

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:45.119
 in the most important there is different than in the larger dimension 

00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:47.989
 that can work one or two 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:50.989
 that can use colors 

00:02:51.969 --> 00:02:54.109
 I'll say that as well as 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:56.129
 also combinations 

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:58.369
 you have total freedom 

00:02:58.369 --> 00:03:01.039
 Photos as opposed to federal foundation 

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:02.569
 the legal areas 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:06.209
 Also in the export and on the Schöneberg southern area are excellent 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:07.139
 Examples 

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:08.829
 but not enough 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:10.519
 especially in winter 

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:15.340
 Rudi's Threads Ehnert very active is questionable but now that will bring 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.219
 The Mauerpark was also banned on the last remaining areas 

00:03:19.219 --> 00:03:23.640
 is internationally known for his graffiti band and therefore also 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.640
 tight carrier association is not synonymous because then 

00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:30.139
