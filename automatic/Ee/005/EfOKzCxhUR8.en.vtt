cymbidiums
they<00:01:06.680> tend<00:01:06.950> to<00:01:07.010> have<00:01:07.160> some<00:01:07.310> weight<00:01:07.520> to<00:01:07.670> them

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
they tend to have some weight to them

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.340 
they tend to have some weight to them
there's<00:01:08.300> weight<00:01:08.540> in<00:01:08.690> the<00:01:08.780> stem<00:01:09.020> there's

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:09.350

weight<00:01:09.560> in<00:01:09.710> the<00:01:09.770> flowers<00:01:10.220> so<00:01:10.400> you<00:01:10.430> want<00:01:10.700> to

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:10.760 
weight in the flowers so you want to

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.400 
weight in the flowers so you want to
make<00:01:10.880> sure<00:01:11.030> that<00:01:11.180> you<00:01:11.300> have<00:01:11.750> a<00:01:11.780> vase<00:01:12.080> that's

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
tall enough to

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.200 
tall enough to
support<00:01:14.600> them<00:01:14.810> so<00:01:15.020> what<00:01:15.920> you<00:01:16.040> do<00:01:16.190> when<00:01:17.000> you<00:01:17.120> get

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
support them so what you do when you get

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.790 
support them so what you do when you get
a<00:01:17.270> stem<00:01:17.860> is<00:01:18.860> you<00:01:19.310> take<00:01:19.820> it<00:01:19.940> out<00:01:20.060> of<00:01:20.150> the<00:01:20.210> plastic

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:20.800 
a stem is you take it out of the plastic

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:26.800 
a stem is you take it out of the plastic
obviously<00:01:24.820> I'm<00:01:25.820> gonna<00:01:25.910> cut<00:01:26.180> the<00:01:26.300> plastic<00:01:26.690> off

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
obviously I'm gonna cut the plastic off

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.650 
obviously I'm gonna cut the plastic off
here<00:01:27.310> it's<00:01:28.310> always<00:01:28.610> very<00:01:28.940> important<00:01:29.390> to<00:01:29.480> cut

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:29.660 
here it's always very important to cut

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.630 
here it's always very important to cut
the<00:01:29.780> ends<00:01:30.080> off<00:01:30.200> of<00:01:30.230> any<00:01:30.590> flower<00:01:30.920> when<00:01:31.550> you

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:31.640 
the ends off of any flower when you

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.190 
the ends off of any flower when you
bring<00:01:31.850> them<00:01:31.970> home<00:01:32.180> so<00:01:32.540> it'll<00:01:32.690> be<00:01:32.780> nice<00:01:32.960> and

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:33.200

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:40.910 
fresh so I'm actually gonna recut these

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:42.730 
fresh so I'm actually gonna recut these
to<00:01:41.060> make<00:01:41.150> them<00:01:41.300> into<00:01:41.930> an<00:01:42.020> arrangement<00:01:42.410> but

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
to make them into an arrangement but

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.410 
to make them into an arrangement but
this<00:01:42.830> is<00:01:42.980> just<00:01:43.160> to<00:01:43.250> give<00:01:43.400> you<00:01:43.490> an<00:01:43.610> idea<00:01:43.760> and

this is just to give you an idea and

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.250 
this is just to give you an idea and
oftentimes<00:01:46.390> flowers<00:01:47.390> will<00:01:47.570> come<00:01:47.600> with<00:01:48.050> this

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:48.260 
oftentimes flowers will come with this

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.370 
oftentimes flowers will come with this
flower<00:01:49.010> food<00:01:49.460> here<00:01:49.909> if<00:01:50.420> you<00:01:50.659> don't<00:01:50.870> get<00:01:51.050> it

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
flower food here if you don't get it

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:53.740 
flower food here if you don't get it
I<00:01:51.409> I've<00:01:51.980> never<00:01:52.250> done<00:01:52.460> a<00:01:52.490> side-by-side<00:01:52.790> test<00:01:53.570> to

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
I I've never done a side-by-side test to

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.590 
I I've never done a side-by-side test to
see<00:01:53.960> which<00:01:54.110> lasts<00:01:54.680> longer<00:01:55.159> but<00:01:55.940> if<00:01:56.210> you<00:01:56.360> want

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
see which lasts longer but if you want

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.450 
see which lasts longer but if you want
to<00:01:56.780> you<00:01:57.200> can<00:01:57.350> just<00:01:57.380> make<00:01:57.650> up<00:01:57.770> your<00:01:57.920> own<00:01:57.950> mixture

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
to you can just make up your own mixture
