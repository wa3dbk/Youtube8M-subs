urban toys do I mean not all of them do

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:24.420 
urban toys do I mean not all of them do
though<00:02:23.200> but<00:02:23.590> I<00:02:23.620> wasn't<00:02:23.980> expecting<00:02:24.340> the

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
though but I wasn't expecting the

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.850 
though but I wasn't expecting the
up-and-down<00:02:24.670> movement<00:02:25.150> so<00:02:25.330> I'm<00:02:25.830> glad<00:02:26.830> about

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
up-and-down movement so I'm glad about

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:32.760 
up-and-down movement so I'm glad about
that<00:02:28.770> now<00:02:29.770> with<00:02:29.950> the<00:02:30.069> sword<00:02:30.510> of<00:02:31.510> sword<00:02:32.380> it

doesn't<00:02:33.550> really<00:02:33.640> have<00:02:33.819> much<00:02:34.030> detail<00:02:34.450> but<00:02:34.660> you

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
doesn't really have much detail but you

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.059 
doesn't really have much detail but you
know<00:02:35.140> didn't<00:02:35.410> really<00:02:35.560> have<00:02:35.680> any<00:02:35.830> in<00:02:36.010> the

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069 
know didn't really have any in the

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:38.250 
know didn't really have any in the
cartoon<00:02:36.430> but<00:02:36.660> it's<00:02:37.660> a<00:02:37.750> sword<00:02:37.990> you<00:02:38.080> know<00:02:38.170> what

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
cartoon but it's a sword you know what

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.350 
cartoon but it's a sword you know what
do<00:02:38.319> you<00:02:38.380> want<00:02:38.560> I'm<00:02:39.340> just<00:02:39.550> glad<00:02:39.670> it's<00:02:39.910> not<00:02:40.060> bent

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
do you want I'm just glad it's not bent

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.000 
do you want I'm just glad it's not bent
it's<00:02:40.600> actually<00:02:40.870> very<00:02:41.140> straight<00:02:41.530> doesn't<00:02:41.830> come

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
it's actually very straight doesn't come

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.030 
it's actually very straight doesn't come
all<00:02:42.160> warped<00:02:42.630> like<00:02:43.630> most<00:02:43.990> brand-new<00:02:44.440> and

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
all warped like most brand-new and

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.840 
all warped like most brand-new and
packaged<00:02:45.959> accessories<00:02:46.959> do

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
packaged accessories do

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.480 
packaged accessories do
but<00:02:48.780> the<00:02:49.080> problem<00:02:49.440> with<00:02:49.560> the<00:02:49.890> sword<00:02:50.160> and<00:02:50.370> this

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490 
but the problem with the sword and this

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:53.870 
but the problem with the sword and this
figure<00:02:50.730> is<00:02:51.950> see<00:02:52.950> where<00:02:53.130> it<00:02:53.190> goes<00:02:53.340> in<00:02:53.640> there

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
figure is see where it goes in there

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.650 
figure is see where it goes in there
when<00:02:54.840> you<00:02:54.960> want<00:02:55.140> to<00:02:55.230> put<00:02:55.470> it<00:02:55.560> in<00:02:55.730> it<00:02:56.730> rubs<00:02:57.330> into

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
when you want to put it in it rubs into

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.880 
when you want to put it in it rubs into
his<00:02:57.780> head<00:02:58.050> so<00:02:58.440> you<00:02:59.400> gotta<00:02:59.640> turn<00:03:00.270> his<00:03:00.480> head<00:03:00.890> to

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
his head so you gotta turn his head to

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:09.670 
his head so you gotta turn his head to
allow<00:03:02.130> the<00:03:02.190> sort<00:03:02.610> to<00:03:02.760> go<00:03:02.880> in<00:03:03.710> so<00:03:04.710> there<00:03:05.670> it<00:03:05.880> is

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.750 

and<00:03:11.600> it<00:03:12.600> does<00:03:12.870> fit<00:03:13.590> somewhat<00:03:14.280> well<00:03:14.460> into<00:03:14.670> his

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
and it does fit somewhat well into his

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.630 
and it does fit somewhat well into his
hand<00:03:15.030> you<00:03:15.180> have<00:03:15.330> to<00:03:15.590> kind<00:03:16.590> of<00:03:16.680> force<00:03:17.010> it<00:03:17.220> and

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
hand you have to kind of force it and

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.490 
hand you have to kind of force it and
also<00:03:17.760> paint<00:03:18.060> a<00:03:18.180> little<00:03:18.300> easier<00:03:20.240> but<00:03:21.240> there<00:03:22.170> it

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
also paint a little easier but there it

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:30.290 
also paint a little easier but there it
is<00:03:27.020> so<00:03:28.100> it's<00:03:29.100> a<00:03:29.220> good<00:03:29.370> figure<00:03:29.820> it's<00:03:29.970> getting

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
is so it's a good figure it's getting

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:34.580 
is so it's a good figure it's getting
expensive<00:03:31.490> if<00:03:32.490> you<00:03:32.700> want<00:03:32.940> just<00:03:33.210> by<00:03:33.390> the<00:03:33.590> super

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
expensive if you want just by the super

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.250 
expensive if you want just by the super
sand<00:03:34.860> version<00:03:35.520> trunks<00:03:35.970> which<00:03:36.690> is<00:03:36.840> a<00:03:36.870> lot<00:03:37.110> more

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
sand version trunks which is a lot more

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.020 
sand version trunks which is a lot more
readily<00:03:37.560> available<00:03:38.480> and<00:03:39.480> cheaper<00:03:40.020> but<00:03:40.700> I<00:03:41.700> had

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
readily available and cheaper but I had

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.600 
readily available and cheaper but I had
to<00:03:42.150> get<00:03:42.300> this<00:03:42.420> one<00:03:42.770> for<00:03:43.770> a<00:03:43.800> certain<00:03:44.130> reason<00:03:44.280> and

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:44.610 
to get this one for a certain reason and

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:45.890 
to get this one for a certain reason and
you'll<00:03:44.820> see<00:03:45.240> why<00:03:45.420> on<00:03:45.570> my<00:03:45.660> other<00:03:45.780> channel

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
you'll see why on my other channel

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.010 
you'll see why on my other channel
eventually<00:03:47.210> but<00:03:48.210> this<00:03:48.420> is<00:03:48.480> a<00:03:48.510> good<00:03:48.600> figure<00:03:48.810> too

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:49.020 
eventually but this is a good figure too

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:52.130 
eventually but this is a good figure too
and<00:03:49.380> like<00:03:49.470> I<00:03:49.560> said<00:03:49.620> the<00:03:49.920> Jax<00:03:50.790> version<00:03:51.270> doesn't

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
and like I said the Jax version doesn't

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:53.180 
and like I said the Jax version doesn't
even<00:03:52.230> bend<00:03:52.530> in<00:03:52.650> the<00:03:52.740> legs

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
even bend in the legs

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:57.140 
even bend in the legs
and<00:03:53.490> plus<00:03:53.700> it's<00:03:53.880> so<00:03:54.030> much<00:03:54.180> taller<00:03:54.420> so<00:03:56.060> you<00:03:57.060> know

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
and plus it's so much taller so you know

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:59.090 
and plus it's so much taller so you know
this<00:03:57.330> one's<00:03:57.540> in<00:03:57.690> scale<00:03:57.960> let's<00:03:58.590> put<00:03:58.830> him<00:03:58.950> next

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
this one's in scale let's put him next

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.880 
this one's in scale let's put him next
to<00:03:59.280> his<00:03:59.430> favorite<00:03:59.760> friends

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:09.180 

you<00:04:02.980> know<00:04:03.100> it's<00:04:03.280> all<00:04:03.490> on<00:04:03.640> the<00:04:03.730> scale<00:04:03.970> even<00:04:08.190> with

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
you know it's all on the scale even with

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:18.680 
you know it's all on the scale even with
ultimate<00:04:10.560> you<00:04:11.560> know<00:04:12.810> it's<00:04:13.810> good<00:04:14.110> it<00:04:14.530> works

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690

good<00:04:20.170> figure<00:04:20.500> I'd<00:04:20.590> doesn't<00:04:20.799> recommend<00:04:21.190> them

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459 
good figure I'd doesn't recommend them

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:23.970 
good figure I'd doesn't recommend them
if<00:04:21.519> you<00:04:21.640> can<00:04:21.760> afford<00:04:21.850> it<00:04:22.120> and<00:04:22.680> fine
