00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
well I don't know I don't know doing the

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.179 
well I don't know I don't know doing the
math<00:03:48.420> fifteen<00:03:48.900> percent<00:03:49.260> or<00:03:49.620> however<00:03:49.769> much

00:03:50.179 --> 00:03:50.189 
math fifteen percent or however much

00:03:50.189 --> 00:03:51.800 
math fifteen percent or however much
it's<00:03:50.640> probably<00:03:50.879> how<00:03:50.970> I<00:03:51.030> stayed<00:03:51.329> alive<00:03:51.569> right

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
it's probably how I stayed alive right

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:57.050 
it's probably how I stayed alive right
there<00:03:53.840> kill<00:03:54.840> them<00:03:54.989> about<00:03:55.500> to<00:03:55.680> kill<00:03:55.890> him<00:03:56.060> kill

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
there kill them about to kill him kill

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.259 
there kill them about to kill him kill
the<00:03:57.209> death<00:03:57.359> knight<00:03:57.569> killed<00:03:57.900> rogue<00:03:58.879> so<00:03:59.879> I<00:03:59.909> mean

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
the death knight killed rogue so I mean

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:01.520 
the death knight killed rogue so I mean
I<00:04:00.299> guess<00:04:00.540> that<00:04:00.720> right<00:04:00.870> there<00:04:01.049> just<00:04:01.079> kept<00:04:01.470> me

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
I guess that right there just kept me

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.949 
I guess that right there just kept me
alive<00:04:01.620> not<00:04:02.250> that<00:04:02.370> these<00:04:02.549> guys<00:04:02.959> probably

00:04:03.949 --> 00:04:03.959 
alive not that these guys probably

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:05.449 
alive not that these guys probably
aren't<00:04:04.379> alized<00:04:04.709> wrong<00:04:04.920> anyway<00:04:05.220> looks<00:04:05.400> like

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
aren't alized wrong anyway looks like

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:12.440 
aren't alized wrong anyway looks like
they're<00:04:05.670> still<00:04:05.819> in<00:04:06.260> malevolent<00:04:07.260> gear<00:04:11.450> if

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
they're still in malevolent gear if

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.200 
they're still in malevolent gear if
anybody<00:04:13.019> got<00:04:13.200> the<00:04:13.349> chance<00:04:13.590> to

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:15.210 
anybody got the chance to

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:18.140 
anybody got the chance to
I<00:04:15.300> guess<00:04:16.110> I<00:04:16.410> think<00:04:16.770> last<00:04:17.130> week<00:04:17.250> everybody<00:04:17.940> had

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:18.150 
I guess I think last week everybody had

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:19.820 
I guess I think last week everybody had
the<00:04:18.270> chance<00:04:18.510> to<00:04:18.780> get<00:04:19.140> back<00:04:19.200> all<00:04:19.650> their

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:19.830 
the chance to get back all their

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:22.370 
the chance to get back all their
conquest<00:04:20.310> points<00:04:20.930> because<00:04:21.930> I<00:04:22.050> had<00:04:22.170> a<00:04:22.200> whole

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
conquest points because I had a whole

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.200 
conquest points because I had a whole
bunch<00:04:22.620> but<00:04:23.010> I<00:04:23.160> was<00:04:23.610> talking<00:04:23.820> to<00:04:23.880> someone<00:04:24.120> in

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210

this so they have like 12,000 that they

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.940 
this so they have like 12,000 that they
could<00:04:26.970> get<00:04:27.320> maybe<00:04:28.320> they're<00:04:28.620> just<00:04:28.740> super
