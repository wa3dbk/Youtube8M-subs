00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 bean soup food he was very alive had not read the book was very 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.130
 beautiful done very well his scorer had won the garrison Leon area and 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.450
 today monetary alarte then there will be good day the bride protocol and regretted that 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:16.289
 the letter has been easy is not as fine as it seems 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.359
 but it is very rich and in fact it is a good way to take advantage of the beans 

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:24.679
 that many times we use it for a gold look or for some stew if we 

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:28.480
 we are short with the recipe that we can be doing in 12 8 moacir a 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:34.510
 Sopita very very rich in fact were left to see what is magnificent nothing good 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.030
 so let's make your testazo decrease 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.780
 If you have to taste it, we are going to use, of course, the beans 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.670
 white beans long white rice that can usually be 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.000
 they usually add to the other one we also go grijalbo olive oil salt and pepper 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.570
 and we're going to use a bit of ramón corujo nicolás honest mobilize a 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.100
 little bit of raw ham as a differential ingredient but we could 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.660
 replace it at home for example by pig if it seems to you by the way 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.870
 air to support them would be a very good option kopra will replace the ham 

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:09.650
 raw has decided to use some leek abundant leek in this case 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.060
 I think very well with skeleton food ingredients 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.729
 some thyme parsley 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:18.819
 some wedding carrots and some garlic and finally some extract of 

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:22.740
 tomato or tomato a small teaspoon to continue highlighting the 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.450
 taste of our dish that what function does the tomato extract I spoke to 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.380
 give flavor to tomato tomato and in addition it is going to dye a little the estuary appearance 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.909
 tomato extract are tomatoes that were dissected concentrated and then 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.140
 process to obtain this paste with what we have a product with a lot of flavor 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.909
 a very concentrated tomato and very noble generous frasquitos from the editor but 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.250
 can keep that I have a teaspoon today I close the eyes good 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.590
 the length of a question if they can be preserved 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.060
 the best way to conserve comes in peace or in vials suffrage that come in 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:57.890
 the tuna is that the can opened 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.200
 we have to remove all the content that came to shoot it for example in a 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.040
 small bag covered in oil can go to the refrigerator and if we have it in the 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.720
 bottle for not doing exactly the same thing the bottle we covered with oil for 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.200
 what the content and the model I have to get in touch with the 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.680
 air 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.409
 and that way I can keep it on the hillside 

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:21.090
 but the best way to preserve it is in the price to be in a hurry so you can 

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:25.189
 to see is perfectly without any problem we put it in a taper 

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:29.229
 It saves the geyser and it can be used without problems when we have 

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:33.409
 you want and we do not need to cover it with oil added flights of the planes that 

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:36.319
