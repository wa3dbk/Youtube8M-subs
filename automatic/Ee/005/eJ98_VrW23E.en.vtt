00:00:02.679 --> 00:00:10.550
 we pre-diluted rum to 45 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:12.800
 percent passed a few days by the bodies 

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:17.119
 bti a terrific product will want 

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:18.830
 good she passed the smell of wort but 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:23.920
 cane sugar 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:23.920
 now we take coal here 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.440
 in this case, the phantom czech 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:35.700
 production here this here roughly 

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:42.150
 30 g 0 and fall asleep for cleaning at the rate of 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:45.680
 10 grams per liter distillate occurs 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.680
 reaction we have this interesting 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:53.110
 hold this whole thing for 3 days 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:01:09.369
 for three days periodically 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:13.300
 shaking up cleaning was more efficient 

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:13.300
 three days to filter 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:20.509
 after infusion 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:23.170
 if the tour is our future rum through 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:27.240
 destitute printing 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.240
 after we add vegetables to 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:43.810
 take 2 to 0 I take at the rate of 10 grams 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:43.810
 on 1 liter of some and falling asleep 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.710
 just and volitional take a month 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.710
 let's see what happens 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:06.640
 next stage 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:11.160
 here is a filter lesson for our future god 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:13.690
 unfortunately we did not get granules 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.410
 stand it one month on a grenade 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.220
 kept 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:22.690
 for four whole months see what 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:25.590
 get after filtering 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:28.420
 we dilute the robot by 39 percent 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.990
 add one teaspoon per liter 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:32.380
 a drink 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:34.030
 fructose and that order we got 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:38.940
 six and a half liters of finished 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.940
 product is such a beautiful color 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:45.569
 but the taste of the next video 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:52.200
 the tasting was successful drink 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.930
 I would like to correct a little 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.360
 and recipe and before falling asleep on 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.510
 Oak chips a little boil them 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:03.170
 water can even be 2 times to 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.480
 remove excessive bite pipe 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.720
 attack pretty interesting drink 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.720
 you try
