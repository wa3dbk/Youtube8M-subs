that's the air that's that okay but this

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.280 
that's the air that's that okay but this
is<00:01:28.150> the<00:01:28.210> KN<00:01:28.690> air<00:01:28.930> induction<00:01:29.290> okay<00:01:30.100> that<00:01:31.290> that

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:32.290 
is the KN air induction okay that that

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.910 
is the KN air induction okay that that
we<00:01:32.440> put<00:01:32.680> on<00:01:32.830> here<00:01:33.340> that<00:01:34.410> increases<00:01:35.410> horsepower

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
we put on here that increases horsepower

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.330 
we put on here that increases horsepower
by<00:01:36.130> 12<00:01:36.430> dyno<00:01:37.090> horsepower<00:01:37.860> so<00:01:38.860> it<00:01:39.009> gives<00:01:39.190> it<00:01:39.280> a

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
by 12 dyno horsepower so it gives it a

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.460 
by 12 dyno horsepower so it gives it a
little<00:01:39.430> bit<00:01:39.640> more<00:01:39.869> boost<00:01:40.869> if<00:01:41.080> you<00:01:41.170> want<00:01:41.320> to<00:01:41.380> go

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:44.770 
a little faster okay but the ls2 motor

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.580 
a little faster okay but the ls2 motor
will<00:01:44.950> give<00:01:45.130> you<00:01:45.250> all<00:01:45.369> you<00:01:45.490> want<00:01:46.560> so<00:01:47.560> what
