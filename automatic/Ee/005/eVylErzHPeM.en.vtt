if you guys are skating it I just

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.249 
if you guys are skating it I just
started<00:02:07.329> messing<00:02:07.479> around<00:02:07.720> with<00:02:07.959> it

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
started messing around with it

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.350 
started messing around with it
backside<00:02:08.679> 180<00:02:08.829> did<00:02:09.190> I<00:02:09.280> think<00:02:09.489> and<00:02:09.729> then<00:02:09.849> the

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:10.360 
backside 180 did I think and then the

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.120 
backside 180 did I think and then the
backside<00:02:10.750> flip<00:02:10.840> just<00:02:11.140> naturally<00:02:11.590> comes<00:02:11.829> next

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
backside flip just naturally comes next

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.339 
backside flip just naturally comes next
and<00:02:12.549> it<00:02:12.940> didn't<00:02:13.420> seem<00:02:13.540> that<00:02:13.599> difficult<00:02:13.930> I

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:14.349 
and it didn't seem that difficult I

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:15.870 
and it didn't seem that difficult I
didn't<00:02:14.620> take<00:02:14.739> that<00:02:14.769> long<00:02:15.069> to<00:02:15.130> do<00:02:15.459> so<00:02:15.489> I<00:02:15.760> was

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
didn't take that long to do so I was

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.550 
didn't take that long to do so I was
pretty<00:02:16.030> psyched<00:02:16.269> about<00:02:16.420> that<00:02:16.569> too<00:02:16.930> and<00:02:17.230> it<00:02:17.440> was

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
pretty psyched about that too and it was

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.660 
pretty psyched about that too and it was
a<00:02:17.590> fun<00:02:18.400> spot<00:02:18.840> again<00:02:19.840> I<00:02:20.200> was<00:02:20.769> most<00:02:21.099> happy<00:02:21.220> about

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670
