 [music] 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.770
 have I had before this very gelenvagen 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.710
 how would like and wanted something 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:07.220
 lower something more comfortable than 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.410
 gelenwagen since wood and 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:14.370
 naturally air suspension which 

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:17.280
 adjusts stiffness and clearance height 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:20.310
 car that is can move 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.970
 as if so comfortable and tough 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:26.580
 that is, you leave on the track 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:28.890
 modes of suspension stiffness and that is 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.140
 the car is kept as experienced as how 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.259
 subaru for example there may become so 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.270
 what is the feeling of riding this 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.900
 a car is created around the city 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.540
 vacuum 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.060
 code around the car of course 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.619
 everywhere you miss everywhere respect on 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.350
 road and 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.119
 how would a vacuum be created because when 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:51.930
 you close the door she's brought 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:55.020
 door closer and Shumka noise insulation 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:57.750
 car factory at level height 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.570
 Here you have a car tinted all in a circle 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:03.890
 there are no real numbers even 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:06.060
 mobility even police officers 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.010
 have to somehow dodge them 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.580
 look where they stand instead of money 

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:13.830
 that is, well, sometimes some let me go 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:15.900
 im saying sorry please how 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:19.549
 the exhibit I have it as it were in the garage 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:22.200
 and leaving it rarely like that 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:23.010
 all while it is impossible to me 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.169
 drive away from them 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.169
 [music] 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:39.840
 650 thousand rubles like a cake at all 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:41.370
 the minimum will be as car 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.959
 well-groomed 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.180
 All maintenance work with him 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:47.890
 constantly replaced the entire undercarriage 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:51.310
 together with racks has all 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:53.019
 work orders and well, plus more of course 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.360
 eliminated all the chips on the car 

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:57.760
 not a single scratch as far as 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.230
 It is not present on the back of well owners 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.940
 I can only wish for her 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.670
 courted and looked after because it 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:06.459
 The car is still not a Toyota mersedes 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.560
 which requires specialized 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:10.239
 service again if you fix it 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.299
 in the garage in many do not know many 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:14.739
 nuances in the car and just take care 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:16.660
 and follow the car and and nick and in 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:18.880
 no serious future 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.069
 breakdowns I have this example I was not 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:23.700
 just leaving with a million changed 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:23.700
 timely
