00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:10.490
 hello friends, well, I'm going to show you 

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:13.459
 in this video the main parts of 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:15.920
 an indispensable motorcycle so that 

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:17.900
 learn to manage 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:19.790
 here in this part we find the switch 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.270
 which is where we insert the key to 

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:24.430
 be able to start the motorcycle 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:28.220
 in the fist on the right side of the handlebar 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:30.710
 is the accelerator that is this 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.050
 in this same place we also have a 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.550
 command that in turn has a button 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.890
 Red 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:40.040
 It is a current cutter and it serves to 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:42.230
 pay the bike if this button is on no 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:46.210
 it was off because we can not tear it 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:48.129
 the drawing here indicates us 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.280
 if it is in the on position or 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:50.280
 off 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.950
 down here we also have the button 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:56.480
 march that is going to start the 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:01.420
 motorcycle 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.420
 this lever is the front brake 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:10.280
 and good regularly in this handle 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:10.280
 we will also have quarter lights and lighthouse 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.930
 now from the left side 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:21.350
 we found another command that contains 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:25.440
 regularly horn directional lights 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:29.030
 and changes of high and low lights 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.030
 we also have this lever 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.810
 which is precisely the klotz 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:40.980
 Well now I'll show you this one 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:44.090
 left side at the bottom 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:44.090
 the gear lever 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:49.260
 what is this 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.700
 as you can see here in the drawing that 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:55.920
 bring the same motorcycle 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.920
 the first speed is down 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.690
 and second fifth up 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.950
 all up to fifth 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.819
 in some models change for example 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:16.260
 they can all be down or all for 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:16.260
 up depends on the model 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.750
 Now I 'm going to show you 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:27.600
 on this right side of the motorcycle 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:32.990
 seeing it from above or mounted on it 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:32.990
 the rear brake pedal that is this 

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:43.360
 in some cases when they do not bring 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:45.790
 electric ignition bring this leg of 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:49.350
 this right side also that is the 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.350
 start pedal precisely 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:59.310
 and finally I want to show you two 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:02.420
 very important motorcycle parts 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:05.950
 one is the lawyer 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.950
 what is this that we have here 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:11.880
 so it works 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.430
 and so it is removed 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.290
 that is more than anything is for when in 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.960
 the mornings the motorcycle is very cold and 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:22.220
 he wants to start quickly with that 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.220
 we achieved that 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:31.810
 this other piece that we have here or part 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.810
 is the key to the gasoline passage 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:36.620
 in some models 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.980
 depends on where the arrow indicates 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.980
 is 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:45.700
 the normal pace of gasoline 

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:48.910
 or the reservation 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:51.610
 already in another tutorial I will also teach you 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.050
 I will explain to you how this works 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.910
 piece 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:57.280
 good friends then in our next 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:04:00.190
 videotutorial I will show you how to start 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.770
 to drive a motorcycle using together 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:05.580
 each of these parts 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:05.580
 see you soon
