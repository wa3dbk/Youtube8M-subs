this<00:01:05.250> will<00:01:05.399> be<00:01:05.489> a<00:01:05.519> preheat<00:01:05.909> fixture<00:01:06.299> but<00:01:06.450> let's

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
this will be a preheat fixture but let's

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.060 
this will be a preheat fixture but let's
go<00:01:06.750> and<00:01:06.899> take<00:01:06.990> a<00:01:07.049> look<00:01:07.170> inside<00:01:07.590> of<00:01:07.649> it<00:01:07.890> right

drove it like crazy so David blaze said

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.940 
drove it like crazy so David blaze said
this<00:01:39.659> would<00:01:39.810> be<00:01:39.930> happiest<00:01:40.409> in<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.619> 20<00:01:40.920> watt

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
this would be happiest in a 20 watt

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.270 
this would be happiest in a 20 watt
fixture<00:01:41.549> so<00:01:42.440> here's<00:01:43.440> a<00:01:43.530> hole<00:01:43.740> for<00:01:43.890> the<00:01:43.950> starter

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
fixture so here's a hole for the starter

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.850 
fixture so here's a hole for the starter
socket<00:01:44.760> well<00:01:45.150> go<00:01:45.330> ahead<00:01:45.450> let's<00:01:45.630> you<00:01:45.840> watch<00:01:46.619> me

socket well go ahead let's you watch me
knock<00:01:47.010> that<00:01:47.220> out<00:01:47.280> right<00:01:47.640> here<00:01:47.790> on<00:01:47.909> camera<00:01:48.180> here

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
knock that out right here on camera here

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.179 
knock that out right here on camera here
we<00:01:49.110> go<00:01:50.450> alright<00:01:51.450> now<00:01:51.990> this<00:01:52.500> is<00:01:52.560> ready<00:01:52.890> for<00:01:52.979> a

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.920 
we go alright now this is ready for a
fluorescent<00:01:53.790> starter<00:01:56.240> here's<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.450> existing

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
fluorescent starter here's the existing

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:04.310 
fluorescent starter here's the existing
ballast<00:01:58.350> or<00:02:00.920> teh<00:02:01.920> Robertson<00:02:02.520> I<00:02:03.200> think<00:02:04.200> it's

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
ballast or teh Robertson I think it's

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.520 
ballast or teh Robertson I think it's
from<00:02:04.409> 1979<00:02:05.689> we'll<00:02:06.689> look<00:02:06.780> at<00:02:06.930> it<00:02:07.020> after<00:02:07.259> I<00:02:07.320> take

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
from 1979 we'll look at it after I take

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:08.960 
from 1979 we'll look at it after I take
it<00:02:07.650> up<00:02:07.799> so<00:02:08.069> I'm<00:02:08.129> gonna<00:02:08.250> go<00:02:08.429> inside<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:08.759> camera

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
it up so I'm gonna go inside the camera

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.330 
it up so I'm gonna go inside the camera
on<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.090> tripod<00:02:09.179> for<00:02:09.659> now<00:02:09.830> we'll<00:02:10.830> come<00:02:10.979> back<00:02:11.159> to

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
on the tripod for now we'll come back to

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.370 
on the tripod for now we'll come back to
this<00:02:11.510> after<00:02:12.510> I<00:02:12.659> do<00:02:12.780> some<00:02:12.959> work<00:02:12.989> on<00:02:13.230> it

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.950 

all<00:02:17.340> right<00:02:17.520> the<00:02:17.640> conversion<00:02:18.150> is<00:02:18.240> complete<00:02:18.420> and

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
all right the conversion is complete and

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.480 
all right the conversion is complete and
this<00:02:19.080> is<00:02:19.200> what<00:02:19.350> I<00:02:19.380> like<00:02:19.560> to<00:02:19.590> call<00:02:19.710> the<00:02:20.010> moment

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:20.490 
this is what I like to call the moment

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.570 
this is what I like to call the moment
of<00:02:20.550> truth<00:02:20.930> so<00:02:21.930> here<00:02:22.680> we<00:02:22.830> go<00:02:23.010> you<00:02:23.070> can<00:02:23.190> see<00:02:23.460> it<00:02:23.520> in

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
of truth so here we go you can see it in

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.190 
of truth so here we go you can see it in
the<00:02:23.640> mirror<00:02:23.880> as<00:02:24.000> well<00:02:24.030> let's<00:02:24.900> see<00:02:25.050> what

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
the mirror as well let's see what

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.540 
the mirror as well let's see what
happens<00:02:25.230> when<00:02:25.590> I<00:02:25.620> apply<00:02:25.680> power<00:02:26.160> to<00:02:26.430> this

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
happens when I apply power to this

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:35.060 
happens when I apply power to this
fixture<00:02:32.300> what<00:02:33.300> looks<00:02:33.690> like<00:02:33.780> it<00:02:34.020> works<00:02:34.260> I<00:02:34.650> have

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
fixture what looks like it works I have

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.230 
fixture what looks like it works I have
successfully<00:02:35.430> converted<00:02:36.210> this<00:02:36.330> to<00:02:36.720> preheat

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:38.240 
successfully converted this to preheat

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:45.300 
however this push-button switch I'm

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.060 
however this push-button switch I'm
calling<00:03:45.690> to<00:03:45.780> replace<00:03:46.170> the<00:03:46.380> toggle<00:03:46.830> because

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
calling to replace the toggle because

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:49.370

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
furnace to come on well I can say that

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.600 
furnace to come on well I can say that
well<00:03:58.290> the<00:03:58.380> fixture<00:03:58.710> does<00:03:58.860> have<00:03:59.010> a<00:03:59.070> switch<00:03:59.340> now

00:03:59.600 --> 00:03:59.610

here's the old ballast that came out of
it<00:04:09.420> right<00:04:09.570> here<00:04:10.730> it's<00:04:11.730> a<00:04:11.910> trigger<00:04:12.330> start

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
it right here it's a trigger start

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.490 
it right here it's a trigger start
ballast<00:04:13.640> Robertson<00:04:14.640> on<00:04:15.540> the<00:04:15.690> back<00:04:15.870> don't<00:04:16.380> want

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
ballast Robertson on the back don't want

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.720 
ballast Robertson on the back don't want
to<00:04:16.560> damage<00:04:16.739> the<00:04:16.859> label<00:04:17.570> sorry<00:04:18.570> about<00:04:18.780> this

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:19.730 
to damage the label sorry about this

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:24.710 
to damage the label sorry about this
look<00:04:20.730> at<00:04:20.850> this<00:04:21.060> see<00:04:21.330> it<00:04:21.510> says<00:04:22.940> 379<00:04:23.940> so<00:04:24.150> I<00:04:24.240> guess

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
look at this see it says 379 so I guess

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.740 
look at this see it says 379 so I guess
that<00:04:24.870> means<00:04:24.960> it<00:04:25.080> was<00:04:25.200> made<00:04:25.229> in<00:04:25.470> 1979

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 
that means it was made in 1979

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.470 
that means it was made in 1979
all<00:04:27.380> right<00:04:27.620> now<00:04:28.580> we're<00:04:29.030> going<00:04:29.180> to<00:04:29.270> put<00:04:29.420> the

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.720 
I'm probably going to put a toggle on
that<00:04:59.030> switch<00:04:59.330> so<00:04:59.720> that<00:05:00.020> being<00:05:00.950> said<00:05:01.040> I<00:05:01.250> hope

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:01.730 
that switch so that being said I hope

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:04.300 
that switch so that being said I hope
you<00:05:01.880> enjoyed<00:05:02.120> this<00:05:02.240> video<00:05:02.450> and<00:05:03.070> that'll<00:05:04.070> be<00:05:04.190> it

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:05.960 
and we'll probably revisit this fixture

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:08.050 
and we'll probably revisit this fixture
at<00:05:06.020> a<00:05:06.080> later<00:05:06.230> time<00:05:06.400> all<00:05:07.400> right<00:05:07.430> let's<00:05:07.730> see<00:05:07.910> one
