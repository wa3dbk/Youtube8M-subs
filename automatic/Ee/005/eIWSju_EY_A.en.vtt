00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.259
 or not 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:19.449
 hello girls how about here I am again 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:22.750
 and today we will talk about hair there 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:25.270
 a lot of questions about how to treat 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:27.250
 natural hair receives a lot of 

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:29.859
 emails asking me what products 

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:33.250
 used as I keep the hair so 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:35.440
 you see the defined curl and many 

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.270
 things more then I'm going to take that 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.539
 I just bought a full line of 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:43.450
 products for curly hair but 

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:45.579
 specifically that I love and I'm going to 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:48.190
 take advantage and I'll talk a little bit about the 

00:00:45.579 --> 00:00:51.329
 line is that I buy and how I care 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:55.720
 my hair the line and concrete is the 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:57.610
 evercore de l'orÃ©al is the me when 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.399
 I was on the plane to Miami for the 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:03.130
 mac presentation I saw an ad for 

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:04.360
 this line that put that was new in the 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:06.340
 instyle magazine 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.880
 then I signed it and said I have to 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.979
 go to a pharmacy to look for it because 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.950
 I'm always looking for alternatives to 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:16.840
 the products that I use because I believe 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:20.139
 that there is always something better out there that 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.680
 you can get then the line is 

00:01:20.139 --> 00:01:23.680
 you bring 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:27.280
 products I specifically bought myself 5 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:30.090
 I bought the ideal search shampoo that is 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:34.580
 this well in this tube format 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:37.330
 then I bought the clean without conditions 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.710
 is a conditioner that helps you 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:42.920
 when you have curly hair you usually 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:45.110
 wash your head a lot more because the 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.590
 gray or it looks much nicer just the 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:50.240
 day you wash it then this bugle 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.400
 without shampoo as its name says it is a 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.680
 conditional forgiveness as his name what 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.660
 it says it's a conditioner that cleans 

00:01:54.680 --> 00:02:00.230
 so you can go 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:03.260
 you can alternate between the shampoo and 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:06.830
 the conditioner that is going to clean you and 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:09.260
 it's not like a shampoo that recommends 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:13.330
 use it every day then we have 

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:13.330
 the great charles living green 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:20.170
 that is and is coming with a very pop 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:23.170
 practical and we also have the scott 

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.170
 stringer 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:30.010
 what is to fix the curls a bit but 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.719
 that at the same time leave them quite 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.930
 soft and finally we have here a 

00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:38.319
 oil that comes as two-phase then 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:41.980
 you mix it and it all comes together and puts that 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:45.090
 is to untangle and illuminate the line 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:48.489
 complete puts that is 100% free 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:51.189
 sulfates that is not dry at all the 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:55.980
 Hair is really designed for the 

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:55.980
 curly hair in specific addition 

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:03.670
 It has many natural ingredients 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:07.470
 It is 100% big and the only product that I 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:10.420
 missing was the conditioner because 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.580
 I feel that is what I use the least and 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:14.590
 with everything else that I have then 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.440
 I have enough for the product to 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:20.950
 my hair I can say about this line 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:24.720
 I'm totally in love or my 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:28.450
 curls in it had never been so 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:31.150
 soft the softness that leaves you should already 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:33.970
 the shampoo when you then wash the 

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:37.630
 shampoo that from the hair so soft and 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:41.860
 then if you already add the living or the cream 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:43.930
 fixing or oil as really the 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.609
 hair is 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:50.989
 spectacular the result the curls 

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:52.909
 they remain taken smooth defined to part 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:55.879
 the oil I like to use it 

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:58.340
 the next day that the hair is not 

00:03:55.879 --> 00:04:00.230
 just like the first day you throw it and 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:03.650
 Brightens the hair because the 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:07.489
 curly hair has one thing that is that 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:10.760
 the oil always tends to be dry 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:12.530
 me and the curls are a combination 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:14.120
 perfect always if you have hair 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:17.930
 curly you always have to have some 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:19.459
 type of oil to put on to hydrate 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.829
 hair especially for the days 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:23.630
 after washing because the day of the 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:25.699
 because they are very beautiful, it looks very 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:27.590
 Brilliant is for the next day already 

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:30.289
 they lose a bit of brightness then they 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:32.800
 you throw a little and recover the brightness that 

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:35.330
 have you lost the day before 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.550
 then the prices are pretty 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:41.090
 affordable I think the most expensive the 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:46.130
 most expensive product was this and it was worth 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:49.909
 8 with 99 dollars then the others are 6 

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:52.669
 with 99 and if you really want it's price 

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:54.590
 of supermarket or in the USA do not sell in 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:58.030
 the pharmacies 

00:04:54.590 --> 00:05:02.030
 but it's a pretty affordable price 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:05.740
 for every pocket and quality 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:10.400
 that they have those products because I'm 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:12.860
 delighted that they are all specific to 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:15.440
 what I look for that is to hydrate my 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:16.910
 curls the one that does not have hair 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:20.750
 Curly does not know because this is a 

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:23.360
 constant battle against dryness 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:26.600
 because it is that the curly hair dries 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:29.390
 very much then he says that is can be 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:32.600
 use to put fourway bits 

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:33.920
 berlinger so you can use it so much 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.960
 the people who have the hair 

00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:42.360
 wavy like the people who have the 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:44.160
 gray or very very very tiny the smell is 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:47.340
 how 

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:49.920
 I remember an infusion of 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:52.800
 chamomile that they sell with honey 

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:54.590
 exactly is is the smell is what I 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:57.390
 comes to mind when it comes back to 

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:59.880
 chamomile with honey I do not know why it's a 

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:04.080
 Very nice smell and the whole line has 

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:06.420
 exactly the same smell and what I do 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:09.390
 is the following thing twice a week I 

00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:12.360
 wash the head with the shampoo if between 

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:14.760
 those days I need to wash the other time 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:16.320
 because the hair is not in the 

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:18.210
 conditions that have to be then 

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:20.490
 used the client without conditions then 

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:25.900
 after drying my hair used 

00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:29.229
 the oil and followed by this the living him 

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:32.530
 the shaping cream I am 

00:06:29.229 --> 00:06:34.419
 using for days when maybe 

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:36.370
 If you are going to take some pictures or if I am going to 

00:06:34.419 --> 00:06:38.949
 I do some pictures that I want the 

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:41.020
 hair does not move but I understand no 

00:06:38.949 --> 00:06:44.370
 abuse these products although this is 

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:46.990
 super natural and just like everyone else 

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:49.900
 I understand not to abuse the products with 

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:52.600
 fixation because I prefer that feeling 

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:55.060
 the soft hair I do not like to feel the 

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:58.090
 I scream that it is a little bit like this 

00:06:55.060 --> 00:07:01.810
 It's wonderful because it leaves hair 

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:03.490
 very soft then the next day I think 

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:06.460
 that you feel a little more that there is a 

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:09.100
 bit harder than usual I suppose but 

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:11.199
 neither is it an exaggerated thing in general 

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:13.449
 and I am delighted with these products 

00:07:11.199 --> 00:07:16.349
 I really like the smell in the 

00:07:13.449 --> 00:07:18.010
 formats come perfect and 

00:07:16.349 --> 00:07:20.370
 I will definitely follow them 

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:23.139
 buying because the relationship 

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:27.070
 price-quality has left me surprised 

00:07:23.139 --> 00:07:30.340
 I recommend that if they reach holy 

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:32.199
 try them on Sunday and if not then in 

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:32.620
 usa are available in all 

00:07:32.199 --> 00:07:35.650
 shops 

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:36.160
 and pharmacies you can get the 

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:39.090
 prices 

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:43.930
 as I told you they are very affordable so 

00:07:39.090 --> 00:07:45.850
 100 recommended good this is my has been 

00:07:43.930 --> 00:07:48.280
 all my hair routine 

00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:50.470
 I hope you liked it and helped in 

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:53.430
 something and see you in the next video 

00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:53.430

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:02.949
 now
