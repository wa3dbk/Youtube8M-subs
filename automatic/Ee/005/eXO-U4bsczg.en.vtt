myself did not come with this fire steel

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.639 
myself did not come with this fire steel
loop<00:00:49.460> and<00:00:49.640> did<00:00:49.760> not<00:00:49.940> come<00:00:50.120> with<00:00:50.210> the<00:00:50.300> belt<00:00:50.649> all

00:00:51.639 --> 00:00:51.649 
loop and did not come with the belt all

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:54.069 
loop and did not come with the belt all
am<00:00:52.280> i<00:00:52.399> doing<00:00:52.730> it<00:00:53.270> came<00:00:53.510> with<00:00:53.690> a<00:00:53.720> faux<00:00:54.050> leather

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:54.079 
am i doing it came with a faux leather

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:56.229 
am i doing it came with a faux leather
belt<00:00:54.980> loop<00:00:55.160> that<00:00:55.310> I<00:00:55.340> picked<00:00:55.640> out<00:00:55.700> myself

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 
belt loop that I picked out myself

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:58.450 
belt loop that I picked out myself
I<00:00:56.300> like<00:00:56.600> the<00:00:56.780> belt<00:00:56.989> I'll<00:00:57.710> probably<00:00:57.950> put<00:00:58.220> it<00:00:58.340> on

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:58.460 
I like the belt I'll probably put it on

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:02.889 
I like the belt I'll probably put it on
later<00:00:58.730> but<00:00:58.850> I<00:00:59.300> just<00:00:59.600> preferred<00:01:00.230> the<00:01:01.899> paracord

00:01:02.889 --> 00:01:02.899 
later but I just preferred the paracord

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:04.959 
later but I just preferred the paracord
because<00:01:03.320> it's<00:01:03.649> more<00:01:03.950> maneuverable<00:01:04.159> like<00:01:04.759> that

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:04.969 
because it's more maneuverable like that

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:07.330 
because it's more maneuverable like that
you<00:01:05.239> can<00:01:05.390> bend<00:01:05.630> it<00:01:05.750> more<00:01:05.990> and<00:01:06.229> and<00:01:07.130> this<00:01:07.219> is

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
you can bend it more and and this is

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.010 
you can bend it more and and this is
about<00:01:07.549> 20<00:01:07.909> feet<00:01:08.090> of<00:01:08.210> paracord<00:01:08.450> so<00:01:08.750> if<00:01:08.810> I<00:01:08.899> have

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:09.020 
about 20 feet of paracord so if I have

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.750 
about 20 feet of paracord so if I have
to<00:01:09.079> meet<00:01:09.170> the<00:01:09.560> paracord<00:01:10.009> in<00:01:10.310> survival

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:10.760 
to meet the paracord in survival

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.810 
to meet the paracord in survival
situation<00:01:11.240> I<00:01:11.450> got<00:01:11.930> it<00:01:12.370> so<00:01:13.370> I'm<00:01:13.490> gonna<00:01:13.580> take

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
situation I got it so I'm gonna take

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.810 
situation I got it so I'm gonna take
this<00:01:14.030> fire<00:01:14.990> steel<00:01:15.260> loop<00:01:15.470> off<00:01:15.830> and<00:01:16.549> I'll<00:01:16.610> show

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820

then<00:02:10.729> you<00:02:10.850> have<00:02:11.030> this<00:02:11.210> plastic<00:02:11.960> plate<00:02:12.290> here

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:12.680 
then you have this plastic plate here

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.930 
then you have this plastic plate here
I'm<00:02:13.190> sure<00:02:13.460> it's<00:02:13.610> actually<00:02:14.770> and<00:02:15.770> that's<00:02:16.670> what

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
I'm sure it's actually and that's what

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.810 
I'm sure it's actually and that's what
the<00:02:17.060> belt<00:02:17.300> loop<00:02:17.480> is<00:02:17.750> hooked<00:02:18.320> on<00:02:18.470> to<00:02:18.770> the<00:02:19.490> faux

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 
the belt loop is hooked on to the faux

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.460 
the belt loop is hooked on to the faux
leather<00:02:19.850> belt<00:02:20.360> loop<00:02:20.510> wrapped<00:02:20.840> around<00:02:21.050> and

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
leather belt loop wrapped around and

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.680 
leather belt loop wrapped around and
then<00:02:21.560> is<00:02:21.680> bolted<00:02:22.160> on<00:02:22.280> here<00:02:22.580> and<00:02:22.940> so<00:02:23.300> I<00:02:23.330> just

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
then is bolted on here and so I just

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.440 
then is bolted on here and so I just
unscrewed<00:02:24.680> these<00:02:24.920> it's<00:02:25.520> pretty<00:02:25.670> difficult<00:02:26.209> to

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
unscrewed these it's pretty difficult to

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.449 
unscrewed these it's pretty difficult to
unscrew<00:02:26.810> this<00:02:26.990> I<00:02:27.140> wouldn't<00:02:27.410> recommend<00:02:27.650> I<00:02:28.130> do

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
unscrew this I wouldn't recommend I do

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:30.190 
unscrew this I wouldn't recommend I do

took<00:02:35.780> it<00:02:35.900> off<00:02:36.020> and<00:02:36.800> then<00:02:36.920> I<00:02:37.070> grated<00:02:37.820> some

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
took it off and then I grated some

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.630

paracord<00:02:38.780> it's<00:02:39.530> a<00:02:39.590> ladder<00:02:39.800> rack<00:02:40.070> great<00:02:40.430> for

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
paracord it's a ladder rack great for

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:41.830 
paracord it's a ladder rack great for
anybody<00:02:40.790> that's<00:02:41.060> interested<00:02:41.330> I<00:02:41.570> don't<00:02:41.780> know

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
anybody that's interested I don't know

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.160 
anybody that's interested I don't know
if<00:02:41.900> I<00:02:42.020> said<00:02:42.230> that<00:02:42.410> and<00:02:43.100> that's<00:02:43.310> about<00:02:43.400> 20<00:02:43.820> feet

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
if I said that and that's about 20 feet

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.280 
if I said that and that's about 20 feet
now<00:02:45.170> the<00:02:45.860> belt<00:02:46.070> loop<00:02:46.340> that<00:02:46.880> came<00:02:47.060> with<00:02:47.269> it<00:02:47.480> was

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
now the belt loop that came with it was

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.530 
now the belt loop that came with it was
this<00:02:48.739> size<00:02:49.010> it's<00:02:49.340> about<00:02:49.489> I<00:02:49.790> think<00:02:50.030> I'm

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
this size it's about I think I'm

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.960 
this size it's about I think I'm
measured<00:02:51.290> it<00:02:51.440> to<00:02:52.090> 3.75<00:02:53.090> inches<00:02:54.010> full<00:02:55.010> belt

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
measured it to 3.75 inches full belt

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.600 
measured it to 3.75 inches full belt
length<00:02:56.690> and<00:02:57.410> so<00:02:57.650> you're<00:02:57.769> gonna<00:02:57.860> get<00:02:58.070> a<00:02:58.130> huge

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
length and so you're gonna get a huge

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.699 
length and so you're gonna get a huge
number<00:02:59.120> of<00:02:59.150> belts<00:02:59.510> in<00:02:59.660> there<00:02:59.870> but<00:03:00.380> if<00:03:00.500> you're<00:03:00.650> a

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
number of belts in there but if you're a

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:02.860 
number of belts in there but if you're a
guy<00:03:00.920> that<00:03:00.950> just<00:03:01.370> wears<00:03:01.610> small<00:03:01.940> leather<00:03:02.450> belts

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
guy that just wears small leather belts

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.990 
guy that just wears small leather belts
that<00:03:03.110> he<00:03:03.170> might<00:03:03.410> not<00:03:03.620> like<00:03:04.250> that<00:03:04.489> big<00:03:04.640> belt

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:05.000 
that he might not like that big belt

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.570 
that he might not like that big belt
loop<00:03:05.180> so<00:03:05.959> I<00:03:05.989> would<00:03:06.350> consider<00:03:06.680> this<00:03:06.920> a<00:03:06.980> drop<00:03:07.310> leg

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
loop so I would consider this a drop leg

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.300 
loop so I would consider this a drop leg
because<00:03:08.000> it's<00:03:08.150> it's<00:03:08.420> pretty<00:03:08.900> far<00:03:09.110> down<00:03:09.350> on<00:03:10.130> my

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
because it's it's pretty far down on my

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.550 
because it's it's pretty far down on my
leg<00:03:10.519> and<00:03:10.790> it<00:03:10.850> bounces<00:03:11.269> about<00:03:11.510> now<00:03:12.080> that's<00:03:12.260> what

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
leg and it bounces about now that's what

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.009 
leg and it bounces about now that's what
I<00:03:12.590> like<00:03:12.739> so<00:03:13.450> somebody<00:03:14.450> might<00:03:14.600> not<00:03:14.780> like<00:03:14.989> that

00:03:15.009 --> 00:03:15.019 
I like so somebody might not like that

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:17.400 
I like so somebody might not like that
and<00:03:15.440> you<00:03:15.530> might<00:03:15.709> want<00:03:15.890> to<00:03:15.920> get<00:03:16.070> the<00:03:16.160> fixed<00:03:16.489> clip

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
and you might want to get the fixed clip

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.149 
and you might want to get the fixed clip
this<00:03:18.410> is<00:03:19.030> coyote<00:03:20.030> brown<00:03:20.269> 30

00:03:22.149 --> 00:03:22.159 
this is coyote brown 30

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:24.580 
this is coyote brown 30
and<00:03:22.549> it<00:03:22.849> came<00:03:23.030> with<00:03:23.090> a<00:03:23.209> very<00:03:23.599> positive<00:03:23.959> lock

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
and it came with a very positive lock

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.280 
and it came with a very positive lock
well<00:03:25.579> I<00:03:25.609> guess<00:03:25.849> it<00:03:25.969> didn't<00:03:26.150> come<00:03:26.269> with<00:03:26.420> this<00:03:26.540> it

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
well I guess it didn't come with this it

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.009 
well I guess it didn't come with this it
was<00:03:27.439> really<00:03:27.469> tight<00:03:28.129> when<00:03:28.280> I<00:03:28.400> got<00:03:28.609> it<00:03:29.019> very

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.019 
was really tight when I got it very

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:31.420 
was really tight when I got it very
tight<00:03:30.319> and<00:03:30.499> I<00:03:30.530> had<00:03:30.680> trouble<00:03:30.859> getting<00:03:31.099> a<00:03:31.249> knife

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:31.430 
tight and I had trouble getting a knife

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.059 
tight and I had trouble getting a knife
out<00:03:31.579> so<00:03:32.299> all<00:03:32.480> I<00:03:32.510> did<00:03:32.659> I'm<00:03:33.560> not<00:03:33.590> gonna<00:03:33.829> recommend

00:03:34.059 --> 00:03:34.069 
out so all I did I'm not gonna recommend

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:35.920 
out so all I did I'm not gonna recommend
this<00:03:34.340> either<00:03:34.549> the<00:03:34.879> best<00:03:35.060> way<00:03:35.269> to<00:03:35.299> do<00:03:35.540> it<00:03:35.689> is<00:03:35.810> to

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
this either the best way to do it is to

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:37.660 
this either the best way to do it is to
get<00:03:36.079> a<00:03:36.109> heat<00:03:36.379> gun<00:03:36.590> and<00:03:36.769> heat<00:03:36.859> it<00:03:37.099> up<00:03:37.159> just<00:03:37.549> a

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
get a heat gun and heat it up just a

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:39.490 
get a heat gun and heat it up just a
little<00:03:37.700> bit<00:03:37.969> and<00:03:38.180> stretch<00:03:38.359> it<00:03:38.629> until<00:03:39.200> you<00:03:39.349> get

little bit and stretch it until you get

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.250 
little bit and stretch it until you get
a<00:03:39.560> desired<00:03:40.010> desired<00:03:40.819> lock<00:03:42.430> and<00:03:43.430> it<00:03:43.700> comes<00:03:43.969> up

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:44.260 
a desired desired lock and it comes up

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.890 
a desired desired lock and it comes up

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:49.549 
awesome thumb ring where I can use my

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:52.629 
awesome thumb ring where I can use my
knuckle<00:03:50.090> to<00:03:50.840> get<00:03:50.989> it<00:03:51.079> out<00:03:51.200> or<00:03:51.499> just<00:03:52.159> the<00:03:52.280> tip<00:03:52.519> of

00:03:59.800 --> 00:03:59.810 
both ways so all I did was right here
