00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
edible I mean that's just how I think

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.449 
edible I mean that's just how I think
you<00:02:37.900> know<00:02:38.019> it's<00:02:38.200> like<00:02:38.350> if<00:02:38.680> I'm<00:02:38.920> not<00:02:39.070> gonna<00:02:39.160> take

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
you know it's like if I'm not gonna take

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:41.070 
you know it's like if I'm not gonna take
each<00:02:39.670> ingredient<00:02:39.970> and<00:02:40.450> drink<00:02:40.720> about<00:02:40.840> a<00:02:40.959> gallon

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
each ingredient and drink about a gallon

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.199 
each ingredient and drink about a gallon
then<00:02:41.560> there's<00:02:41.709> no<00:02:41.890> reason<00:02:42.340> and<00:02:42.430> having<00:02:42.850> it<00:02:42.970> in

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
then there's no reason and having it in

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.720 
then there's no reason and having it in
a<00:02:43.360> product<00:02:43.830> because<00:02:44.830> your<00:02:45.070> skin<00:02:45.340> it<00:02:45.459> is<00:02:45.670> your

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
a product because your skin it is your

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.910 
a product because your skin it is your
largest<00:02:46.300> organ<00:02:46.780> and<00:02:46.900> we<00:02:47.019> often<00:02:47.410> forget<00:02:47.590> that

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
largest organ and we often forget that

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:49.979 
largest organ and we often forget that
like<00:02:48.100> it<00:02:48.489> needs<00:02:48.760> to<00:02:49.000> breathe<00:02:49.239> so<00:02:49.600> we<00:02:49.750> can't

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
like it needs to breathe so we can't

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:51.840
