00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:06.330
 the staff plus a video here on the channel the 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:09.360
 video this time is about curiosity 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.160
 all games gta today about 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.570
 gta curiosity of a very feedback 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.420
 Nice down the canal 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.490
 I already did two or three days of gta 5 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.990
 here in case channel wants to see apply 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.939
 these notes there that you're already going 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.800
 straight to the video and let's stop scrolling 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.800
 here though pro video 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:38.050
 The first curiosity is this the 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.540
 teco game you play today only exists 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.880
 thanks to a bug from another game 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.050
 gta would not be so well known and so 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.910
 famous as it is today 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.879
 become a donkey during the development of 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:50.830
 another game called racing team case no 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:53.379
 happened the game had a style 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:56.650
 similar to gt we know today 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:59.080
 with a difference that was possible in him 

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:02.890
 play cops or thieves 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:05.410
 the problem in quotes in this is that 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:08.110
 when you threw a bug at a thief 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:11.740
 made all the police cars 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:14.080
 at the same time they were behind the thief the 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.820
 bug ended up falling on the grace of beta 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.530
 game tester 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.110
 if you do not know what a beta test is 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:23.590
 is the following beta test is a user 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:25.570
 install a program a meta game is can 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:29.020
 be a program a game that is public 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:30.670
 or private with the function of locating 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.440
 some interface warrior in 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.959
 compatibility some other donkeys and i 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.640
 there goes 

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:39.190
 if it finds a bug or some 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.369
 problem since I said he has to 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:45.160
 immediately notify the company that 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:47.349
 produces a king in the program or some 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:50.590
 app something 5 for them 

00:01:47.349 --> 00:01:54.580
 before they launch the game. 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:56.619
 itself and soon after that buffet falls into the 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.590
 Grace of the freaks test the games 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:00.970
 open the program the game template was 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.610
 reworked to fit 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.170
 better in this dynamic and hence the gta 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.229
 soft if this failure had not 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:11.380
 gta game schedule has happened 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:14.080
 I think it does not exist today, 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.830
 there would be different what would 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.830
 be the same thing 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:22.550
 Let's go to the second curiosity of this. 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:26.120
 video the second curiosity of this video 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:27.770
 is the following map of the game gta 5 has the 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.770
 double the size of manhattan 

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.390
 today is a very fast account to 

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:35.480
 rockstar said that the size of the map of the 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:39.200
 game gta 5 is bigger than the size of the map 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:41.330
 of the red dead redemption of the game gta 4 and 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:45.200
 gta san andreas together 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:49.070
 red dead redemption in 72.4 miles 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:52.610
 gta4 square has 17.6 kilometers 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:54.110
 square and gta san andreas has 36 

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.200
 square kilometers 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:59.750
 so if we join the three there maps 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.220
 together we'll get a little over 126 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.050
 square kilometers 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:06.190
 if anything impressive compare to 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:06.190
 real world city 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:13.340
 the island of manhattan located in the state 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.360
 of New York are just 59 kilometers 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.790
 squares 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:19.100
 this means that the map of gt so in 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:22.480
 almost double the size of the map 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:24.980
 real city 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:27.950
 The third curiosity of the video is 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:30.769
 next rockstar already paid to speak 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:33.110
 bad of her curiosities have some 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:34.850
 games here on youtube talking there but 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.620
 I decided to bring the video 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:38.900
 this was part of a 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.780
 marketing rockstar paid for a 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.400
 journalist to give a helping hand 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.620
 this ended up generating a great highlight 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.959
 of the game and with this as a newspaper 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.160
 basically fulfilled another left something 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:50.870
 about gta 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:54.610
 the newspaper also made a story about 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:57.890
 GTA, I did it and so on. 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:59.630
 this all ended up creating a trick between 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.430
 the staff united states however 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:03.560
 strategy advocated since it did not 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:06.410
 I liked the game it worked the following 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:09.440
 the newspaper has been making a 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:12.140
 gta story about a people not 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:14.600
 liked the game and as it increasingly 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:16.430
 but the game was going to come smoothing the staff 

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:18.799
 I did not want the game and with that the newspapers 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.720
 it's up to talking about the game and 

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:23.270
 with that people thought this game is 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.760
 so bad when they say that I bought 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.990
 just to try and end up liking the game 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.330
 This is the marketing campaign. 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.490
 sensational without agreeing with them 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:34.759
 He used that old story to speak well. 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:39.289
 or speak badly but talk about me and 

00:04:34.759 --> 00:04:41.629
 end the game has arrived where it reached the coast 

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:43.430
 by led of the video is the following this 

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:45.560
 curiosity here if you do not know you 

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.460
 will be thinking like I never noticed 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.219
 in this before 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.930
 if you get most of the covers of gta 

00:04:49.219 --> 00:04:52.280
 She always has a helicopter in the 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.409
 upper left 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:56.900
 basically they gave a pattern to the 

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:59.199
 gta cover always put the same 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.610
 things only in some different order 

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:04.520
 except helicopter always start at 

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:06.949
 the top left after they have 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:09.050
 put things on games such as them 

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:10.490
 gta place over the cover 

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:12.800
 if you did not know about the curiosities 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:16.090
 you must be thinking now how 

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.090
 I never stopped to notice it. 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:24.840
 Now let's go to the fifth curiosity of the 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:27.720
 video gta four have more than 80 thousand 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:30.840
 lines of dialogue what they are watching 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:32.610
 the video knew this the people who already 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:35.100
 played gta knows that the game full of 

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:37.290
 interesting story characters from 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:39.540
 Famous people already dub the characters 

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:42.150
 of the game that most impresses me 

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:45.090
 and Gta 4 had an incredible amount of 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:47.790
 interaction that almost never came to an end 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:49.130
 always an interaction but every other 

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:52.350
 world knows it has an end 

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:54.570
 the script of gta 4 had more than 

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:56.070
 80,000 lines of dialogue to make a 

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:59.460
 quick comparison here 

00:05:56.070 --> 00:06:01.140
 mass effect 3 had approximately 40 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:03.210
 thousand lines of dialogue 

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:04.800
 now imagine that was the amount of 

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:06.720
 gta 4 lines 

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:09.450
 Imagine how much gt was 

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:12.650
 so you can imagine how much is going to be 

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:12.650
 Next time 

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:16.560
 So, folks this was the video if you 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:19.260
 liked the video that accompanies the work 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:21.600
 click on the taste and help me a lot if you still 

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:23.730
 You do not have to sign up for the channel. 

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:26.990
 lose another video I started here is this 

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:26.990
 there he spoke 

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:42.869
 haha ha 

00:06:39.129 --> 00:06:42.869
 already the water
