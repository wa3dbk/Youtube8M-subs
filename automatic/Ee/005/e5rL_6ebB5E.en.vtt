00:00:03.589 --> 00:00:07.230
 Hello my dear subscribers with 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.360
 you nikita nga 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.370
 and in this issue I will answer all your 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.860
 frequently asked questions that you tell me 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.049
 once left under one post and 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.060
 myself frequently asked questions from all 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.870
 when android was released and so not 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.850
 android version blitz which is unlikely 

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:25.770
 but she came out only in Europe as they say 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.820
 us developers but somehow miraculous 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:32.550
 way our players will release all the same 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.010
 get on the Russian legion on the platform 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.580
 android if you are interested in this question 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.410
 if you still don't play them put on 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:42.570
 Russian legion official version of this 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.960
 can issue this question to one of my 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:49.080
 moderators and so the very first question 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.410
 which seemed to me to be interesting 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:54.839
 Are new cards like the developers yet ? 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.860
 They said that the city ​​map is not 

00:00:54.839 --> 00:01:00.510
 going to drive after the new year and 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:03.720
 one of the most anticipated cards such 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:06.540
 dead blow barrels do not say anything 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:08.940
 about this hanover this is what's possible there 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.050
 will be moved to the blitz so everyone 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.480
 hope and believe 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.110
 answer and so proceed to the next 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.020
 the subject 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.000
 whether there will be new modes bohki about it 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.100
 developers also mentioned in one of 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.630
 your streams and and say it that they will 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:26.230
 but again after the new year along with 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:29.500
 combat missions therefore 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:31.990
 also waiting for the leg and everything that will be 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.300
 then several modes at once in one 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.370
 update because here is this mode with 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:39.460
 base and center in each currency for 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:40.060
 honestly tired want something 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.610
 new 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.960
 will be able to transfer account with 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.330
 one server to another 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:49.150
 surely the developers promised to do 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:51.730
 this function but when again they don't 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.360
 speak and judge because they arranged 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:54.820
 poll 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.850
 there are only two of them in this group 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:01.840
 or three days ago I think that at the end 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:04.260
 november or december this feature is already 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.270
 will work that is players who 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:09.040
 decided to play European first 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.550
 north and then failed to translate their 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:16.750
 data can translate everything into Russian 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:17.970
 his tanks of achievement in Russian and he and 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:22.510
 continue your 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:24.760
 will there be training functions there 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.890
 developers will certainly respond 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:29.350
 but again like everything else in 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:32.200
 next year also replays 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:35.020
 team battles combat missions and all here 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:39.010
 this is the rest the new nations will also be 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:41.890
 next year when new 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:45.010
 nation I think it makes sense to talk to you about 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.870
 This is not though for the ignorant were 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.420
 unbelievers can repeat words 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.580
 developers 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.580
 new nations promises to lead december at 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.170
 patch 1.5 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:59.000
 At the same time, and the official goes 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:01.650
 Russian version of android 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.100
 Well, we have England 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:07.830
 only with t and t t t t speak until 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:10.050
 will be like this 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:12.150
 An interesting question found influence 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.700
 equipment put on tank to send 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:17.910
 and so used to the price of its repair 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:20.130
 no it does not affect whether new ones will be introduced 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:23.000
 straight shop tanks that were sold 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:26.670
 only functions like nibbling dicker max 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.690
 pershing valentine and so on well from 6 on 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.480
 present tense 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.850
 yes sure as you see it will be all 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.130
 tanks that are sold in big brother 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:38.610
 in the main store you can buy 

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:39.850
 not only on the stock all this will be introduced 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:43.690
 with time 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:45.880
 will there be a form on in in 183 there will be but in 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:48.160
 the fifteenth year as you object 140 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:50.350
 about the drum tanks i can't 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.360
 nothing to say because it is concerned 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:54.700
 saying that this is a completely different type 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.530
 tanks you need to balance it needs 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.820
 adjust need to adjust to 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.700

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:02.920
