00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:16.309
 Let's study the music and burned tiquatira now. 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:17.910
 n 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.349
 it's a song that goes 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:22.050
 starts working hard on your left hand 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.300
 so it was 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.929
 but peacefully in China before raining the notes 

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:31.109
 It's me 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.970
 we studied a lot in the year of south rock 1 2 and 3 of the left hand 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.180
 it is this precipitation that from the compass 9 the right hand will enter 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.470
 with a key 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:47.720
 in the long - if it is going to make a minimum in the right hand while you do of the west 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.560
 left hand or a quarter note and the Scotsman in the left hand 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:56.760
 so it's important you create more if you could take pen out of the keyboard is 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.400
 ensure a standard one note the long on the right hand while the left hand 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.400
 you alternate movement 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.100
 - federation 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.640
 it was more than a nervous tad extreme this anywhere else to 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.119
 The keyboard is for you, this independence brings two hands 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.520
 so let's listen to the hospitalized osteopathy now 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.780
 murilo in 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.090
 at the 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.490
 thousands of years ago 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.490
 1 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.840
 not only this Thursday is paid 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.820
 and is 

00:02:13.869 --> 00:02:16.589
 ansa 

00:02:16.589 --> 00:02:19.109
 she 

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:20.989
 1 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:23.989
 1 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.069
 you broke up 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:31.779
 but it's forever 

00:02:31.779 --> 00:02:34.429
 bradley cooper no huse 

00:02:34.429 --> 00:02:38.269
 start the music with both hands the preparation in case the Czech had 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:40.649
 burned like I started 

00:02:40.649 --> 00:02:46.899
 the music shows and slow and I had with the 2 3 4 5 6 eight comparsas in the week 

00:02:46.899 --> 00:02:47.849
 the right to change 

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:53.480
 would give pomegranate time to have right hand resting will touch left that more 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.980
 already in advance by the seventh stage comparsa already has to bring none 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.630
 right and positioning no longer causes any delay in the time that the two hands 

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:03.519
 40 but need not touch together
