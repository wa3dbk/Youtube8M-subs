well<00:03:24.560> it's<00:03:24.680> clearly<00:03:24.980> not<00:03:25.160> a<00:03:25.310> person<00:03:25.730> in<00:03:25.820> a<00:03:25.910> suit

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
well it's clearly not a person in a suit

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:30.460 
well it's clearly not a person in a suit
its<00:03:27.739> robotic<00:03:28.269> there<00:03:29.269> is<00:03:29.420> nothing<00:03:29.810> human<00:03:30.260> about

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:30.470 
its robotic there is nothing human about

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.080 
its robotic there is nothing human about
this<00:03:30.620> whatsoever<00:03:30.890> you<00:03:31.220> can<00:03:31.400> see<00:03:31.700> you<00:03:31.850> inside

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
this whatsoever you can see you inside

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.289 
this whatsoever you can see you inside
the<00:03:32.329> suit<00:03:32.570> is<00:03:32.810> falling<00:03:33.650> apart<00:03:33.940> you<00:03:34.940> can<00:03:35.090> see

00:03:35.289 --> 00:03:35.299 
the suit is falling apart you can see

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:36.910 
the suit is falling apart you can see
the<00:03:35.480> animatronic<00:03:36.320> underneath<00:03:36.709> the

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
the animatronic underneath the

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.430 
the animatronic underneath the
endoskeleton<00:03:37.700> so<00:03:38.510> it's<00:03:38.660> definitely<00:03:39.019> not<00:03:39.200> a

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
endoskeleton so it's definitely not a

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.000 
endoskeleton so it's definitely not a
murderer<00:03:40.220> in<00:03:40.459> a<00:03:40.549> suit<00:03:40.810> it's<00:03:41.810> a<00:03:41.870> giant<00:03:42.230> gold

murderer in a suit it's a giant gold

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:48.849 
murderer in a suit it's a giant gold
evil<00:03:43.730> freaky<00:03:44.420> scarier<00:03:45.350> shit<00:03:45.620> bunny<00:03:47.859> and

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:48.859 
evil freaky scarier shit bunny and

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:50.830 
evil freaky scarier shit bunny and
obviously<00:03:49.130> if<00:03:49.459> you<00:03:49.579> look<00:03:49.760> behind<00:03:50.000> him<00:03:50.450> you<00:03:50.630> can

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
obviously if you look behind him you can

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:54.780 
obviously if you look behind him you can
see<00:03:50.870> the<00:03:51.260> box<00:03:51.530> full<00:03:51.950> of<00:03:52.310> the<00:03:52.609> toy<00:03:52.850> animatronics

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
see the box full of the toy animatronics

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.240 
see the box full of the toy animatronics
so<00:03:55.790> this<00:03:55.940> could<00:03:56.150> be<00:03:56.209> a<00:03:56.329> prequel<00:03:57.070> to<00:03:58.070> five

00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:58.250 
so this could be a prequel to five

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.410 
so this could be a prequel to five
nights<00:03:58.519> at<00:03:58.670> Freddy's<00:03:58.910> 2<00:03:59.060> and<00:03:59.750> this<00:04:00.470> is

the toy animatronics getting built this

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.850 
the toy animatronics getting built this
is<00:04:03.910> the<00:04:04.120> first<00:04:04.360> time<00:04:04.510> you<00:04:04.690> see<00:04:04.900> them<00:04:05.080> in<00:04:05.680> their
