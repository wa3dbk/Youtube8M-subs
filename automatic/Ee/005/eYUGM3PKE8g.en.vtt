only<00:00:27.449> because<00:00:27.570> I<00:00:27.869> I<00:00:27.900> can't<00:00:28.439> say<00:00:28.529> that<00:00:28.740> I<00:00:28.800> can

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
only because I I can't say that I can

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.620 
only because I I can't say that I can
review<00:00:29.250> this<00:00:29.460> tire<00:00:29.670> because<00:00:29.939> it's<00:00:30.090> a<00:00:30.179> it's

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630

brand<00:00:30.900> new<00:00:31.050> it<00:00:31.230> hasn't<00:00:31.920> been<00:00:32.099> on<00:00:32.219> my<00:00:32.340> bike<00:00:32.489> yet

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
brand new it hasn't been on my bike yet

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:39.619 
brand new it hasn't been on my bike yet
so<00:00:33.980> anyways<00:00:34.980> this<00:00:35.340> is<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:36.210> New<00:00:36.690> Haven<00:00:37.649> or<00:00:38.629> Avon

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
so anyways this is the New Haven or Avon

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.270 
so anyways this is the New Haven or Avon
however<00:00:40.020> you<00:00:40.079> want<00:00:40.230> to<00:00:40.290> say<00:00:40.469> it<00:00:40.620> it's<00:00:41.100> the

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
however you want to say it it's the

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.720 
however you want to say it it's the
storm<00:00:41.610> 3d<00:00:42.860> m3<00:00:43.860> DXM<00:00:44.489> meaning<00:00:45.239> extra<00:00:45.629> mileage

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:46.730 
storm 3d m3 DXM meaning extra mileage

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:52.490 
storm 3d m3 DXM meaning extra mileage
this<00:00:47.730> is<00:00:47.879> the<00:00:48.030> their<00:00:48.750> newest<00:00:50.930> iteration<00:00:51.930> of

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
this is the their newest iteration of

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.450 
this is the their newest iteration of
the<00:00:52.710> storm<00:00:53.309> line<00:00:53.760> so<00:00:55.039> definitely<00:00:56.039> a<00:00:56.129> different

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
the storm line so definitely a different

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.910 
the storm line so definitely a different
tire<00:00:56.640> here<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.120> reason<00:00:57.420> it's<00:00:57.600> called<00:00:57.920> the

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
tire here and the reason it's called the

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.889 
tire here and the reason it's called the
storm<00:00:59.539> 3d<00:01:00.539> is<00:01:01.370> down<00:01:02.370> inside<00:01:02.609> these<00:01:03.090> these

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
storm 3d is down inside these these

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.460 
storm 3d is down inside these these
little<00:01:04.439> rain<00:01:05.360> sipes<00:01:06.360> here<00:01:06.659> these<00:01:06.930> little<00:01:07.140> rain

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
little rain sipes here these little rain

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.899 
little rain sipes here these little rain
channels<00:01:07.890> I'm<00:01:08.010> going<00:01:08.159> to<00:01:08.220> try<00:01:08.340> to<00:01:08.369> zoom<00:01:08.670> in<00:01:08.820> on

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
channels I'm going to try to zoom in on

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.010 
channels I'm going to try to zoom in on
this<00:01:09.150> won't<00:01:09.360> believe<00:01:09.540> you're<00:01:09.630> gonna<00:01:09.689> be<00:01:09.840> able

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
this won't believe you're gonna be able

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.359 
this won't believe you're gonna be able
to<00:01:10.110> see<00:01:10.290> this<00:01:10.470> on<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.700> video<00:01:13.100> that's<00:01:14.100> right

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
to see this on the video that's right

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.140 
to see this on the video that's right
nice<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:14.790> close<00:01:16.189> little<00:01:17.189> focus<00:01:17.580> right<00:01:17.759> in<00:01:17.790> I

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
nice and close little focus right in I

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.890 
nice and close little focus right in I
think<00:01:18.330> it<00:01:18.600> is<00:01:19.820> okay<00:01:20.820> anyways<00:01:21.299> down<00:01:21.570> inside

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
think it is okay anyways down inside

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.230 
think it is okay anyways down inside
these<00:01:22.049> little<00:01:22.320> rain<00:01:22.470> channels<00:01:22.890> here<00:01:23.240> there's

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
these little rain channels here there's

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.690 
these little rain channels here there's
like<00:01:24.450> little<00:01:24.780> teeth<00:01:25.080> if<00:01:25.890> you<00:01:26.040> can<00:01:26.250> spread

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
like little teeth if you can spread

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.420 
like little teeth if you can spread
these<00:01:26.939> apart<00:01:27.439> there's<00:01:28.439> a<00:01:28.500> little<00:01:28.710> like<00:01:28.950> 3d

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
these apart there's a little like 3d

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:34.640 
these apart there's a little like 3d
teeth<00:01:29.729> that<00:01:29.970> are<00:01:30.060> down<00:01:30.240> inside<00:01:30.720> there<00:01:33.650> anyways

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
teeth that are down inside there anyways

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.020 
teeth that are down inside there anyways
the<00:01:35.430> idea<00:01:36.030> here<00:01:36.360> is<00:01:36.390> that<00:01:36.600> as<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.880> that<00:01:38.880> these

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
the idea here is that as the that these

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.240 
the idea here is that as the that these
kind<00:01:39.299> of<00:01:39.420> rub<00:01:39.869> together<00:01:40.079> and<00:01:40.530> they<00:01:40.920> help<00:01:41.130> the

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
kind of rub together and they help the

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.679 
kind of rub together and they help the
tire<00:01:41.460> to<00:01:42.240> heat<00:01:42.450> up<00:01:42.600> pretty<00:01:42.930> quick<00:01:44.299> and<00:01:45.299> as<00:01:45.570> we

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
tire to heat up pretty quick and as we

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.690 
tire to heat up pretty quick and as we
as<00:01:46.170> we<00:01:46.229> know<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.710> you<00:01:47.130> know<00:01:47.220> when<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.399> Tigers

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
as we know the you know when the Tigers

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:48.920 
as we know the you know when the Tigers
warm<00:01:47.970> that's<00:01:48.240> when<00:01:48.390> it's<00:01:48.540> going<00:01:48.630> to<00:01:48.689> be<00:01:48.810> the

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
warm that's when it's going to be the

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.179 
warm that's when it's going to be the
stickiest<00:01:49.320> when<00:01:49.560> you're<00:01:49.680> gonna<00:01:49.770> get<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.070> most

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
stickiest when you're gonna get the most

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.460 
stickiest when you're gonna get the most
traction<00:01:50.490> out<00:01:50.790> of<00:01:50.909> it<00:01:51.000> definitely<00:01:51.840> has<00:01:52.259> a<00:01:52.290> very

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
traction out of it definitely has a very

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.330 
traction out of it definitely has a very
different<00:01:53.070> profile<00:01:53.700> to<00:01:53.939> it<00:01:54.500> are<00:01:55.500> not<00:01:55.680> profiled

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
different profile to it are not profiled

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.679 
different profile to it are not profiled
this<00:01:56.520> way<00:01:56.759> but<00:01:57.570> it<00:01:57.659> has<00:01:57.689> a<00:01:57.840> very<00:01:58.020> different

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689 
this way but it has a very different

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:03.130 
this way but it has a very different
channeling<00:02:00.689> pattern<00:02:01.350> than<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.040> old<00:02:02.250> storm<00:02:02.850> -

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
channeling pattern than the old storm -

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.359 
channeling pattern than the old storm -
the<00:02:04.140> one<00:02:04.290> that<00:02:04.439> they've<00:02:04.590> are<00:02:05.070> now

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
the one that they've are now

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.660 
the one that they've are now
discontinuing<00:02:06.619> the<00:02:07.619> storm<00:02:08.250> -<00:02:08.459> ultra<00:02:09.080> so

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
discontinuing the storm - ultra so

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.080 
discontinuing the storm - ultra so
anyway<00:02:12.020> so

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
anyway so

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.990 
anyway so
other<00:02:13.330> things<00:02:13.660> here<00:02:15.010> this<00:02:15.489> is<00:02:15.610> supposed<00:02:15.819> to<00:02:15.910> be

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
other things here this is supposed to be

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.809 
other things here this is supposed to be
a<00:02:16.060> dual<00:02:16.269> compound<00:02:16.810> tire<00:02:17.340> least<00:02:18.340> I<00:02:18.430> think<00:02:18.489> the

00:02:18.809 --> 00:02:18.819 
a dual compound tire least I think the

00:02:18.819 --> 00:02:20.699 
a dual compound tire least I think the
front<00:02:19.060> tire<00:02:19.239> is<00:02:19.540> I<00:02:19.780> know<00:02:19.989> the<00:02:20.110> rear<00:02:20.290> tire<00:02:20.560> is

00:02:20.699 --> 00:02:20.709 
front tire is I know the rear tire is

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:22.290 
front tire is I know the rear tire is
going<00:02:20.739> to<00:02:20.890> be<00:02:21.010> dual<00:02:21.190> compound<00:02:21.670> for<00:02:21.940> sure

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:22.300 
going to be dual compound for sure

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.259 
going to be dual compound for sure
and<00:02:22.660> they<00:02:22.750> dual<00:02:22.930> compound<00:02:23.410> nature<00:02:23.830> of<00:02:24.819> any

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
and they dual compound nature of any

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:27.720 
and they dual compound nature of any
tire<00:02:25.540> is<00:02:25.780> that<00:02:25.810> it's<00:02:26.170> as<00:02:26.440> a<00:02:26.470> little<00:02:27.310> bit<00:02:27.400> harder

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
tire is that it's as a little bit harder

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.490 
tire is that it's as a little bit harder
rubber<00:02:28.000> right<00:02:28.209> here<00:02:28.450> in<00:02:28.510> the<00:02:28.599> center<00:02:28.900> where

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
rubber right here in the center where

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.780 
rubber right here in the center where
you<00:02:29.590> don't<00:02:29.799> need<00:02:29.980> to<00:02:30.040> have<00:02:30.280> so<00:02:30.790> much<00:02:31.000> of<00:02:31.060> the

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
you don't need to have so much of the

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.589 
you don't need to have so much of the
grip<00:02:33.840> other<00:02:34.840> than<00:02:35.140> you<00:02:35.590> know<00:02:35.680> braking<00:02:36.129> grip

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 
grip other than you know braking grip

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:39.030 
grip other than you know braking grip
but<00:02:37.599> then<00:02:37.750> it<00:02:37.870> has<00:02:37.989> a<00:02:38.019> very<00:02:38.410> soft<00:02:38.709> rubber

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
but then it has a very soft rubber

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:41.460 
but then it has a very soft rubber
compound<00:02:39.610> out<00:02:39.819> here<00:02:40.060> at<00:02:40.180> the<00:02:40.299> edges<00:02:40.660> it<00:02:41.230> gets

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
compound out here at the edges it gets

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.710 
compound out here at the edges it gets
progressively<00:02:41.650> softer<00:02:42.640> getting<00:02:43.330> all<00:02:43.510> the<00:02:43.629> way

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
progressively softer getting all the way

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.229 
progressively softer getting all the way
out<00:02:43.870> to<00:02:43.989> the<00:02:44.080> edge<00:02:44.230> so<00:02:45.190> that<00:02:45.370> you<00:02:45.459> create<00:02:45.970> the

00:02:46.229 --> 00:02:46.239 
out to the edge so that you create the

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:49.199 
out to the edge so that you create the
the<00:02:46.510> stickiest<00:02:46.959> tire<00:02:47.260> possible<00:02:47.920> player<00:02:48.730> while

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
the stickiest tire possible player while

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:50.580 
the stickiest tire possible player while
you're<00:02:49.299> going<00:02:49.450> through<00:02:49.599> hard<00:02:49.930> corners<00:02:50.410> and

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
you're going through hard corners and

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.120 
you're going through hard corners and
stuff<00:02:52.500> anyways<00:02:53.500> I<00:02:53.650> don't<00:02:53.739> know<00:02:53.890> if<00:02:53.980> they've

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
stuff anyways I don't know if they've

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.910 
stuff anyways I don't know if they've
created<00:02:54.430> like<00:02:54.849> the<00:02:55.299> best<00:02:55.450> tire<00:02:55.690> ever<00:02:55.989> only

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
created like the best tire ever only

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:00.600 
created like the best tire ever only
time<00:02:57.130> will<00:02:57.310> tell<00:02:57.340> that<00:02:57.519> you<00:02:58.030> can<00:02:58.569> use<00:02:59.579> get<00:03:00.579> a

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
time will tell that you can use get a

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.490 
time will tell that you can use get a
lot<00:03:00.790> of<00:03:00.879> use<00:03:01.060> out<00:03:01.180> of<00:03:01.269> the<00:03:01.360> taro<00:03:01.599> I'll<00:03:02.200> bring<00:03:02.379> up

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
lot of use out of the taro I'll bring up

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.009 
lot of use out of the taro I'll bring up
the<00:03:02.560> other<00:03:02.769> tire<00:03:03.040> my<00:03:03.250> old<00:03:03.400> tire<00:03:03.640> here<00:03:03.989> when<00:03:04.989> I

00:03:05.009 --> 00:03:05.019 
the other tire my old tire here when I

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:08.369 
the other tire my old tire here when I
pulled<00:03:05.319> off<00:03:05.500> of<00:03:05.530> the<00:03:05.970> off<00:03:06.970> of<00:03:07.030> the<00:03:07.239> bike<00:03:07.510> and

pulled off of the off of the bike and

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:11.729 
pulled off of the off of the bike and
you<00:03:08.470> can<00:03:08.709> kind<00:03:08.980> of<00:03:09.069> really<00:03:09.940> see<00:03:10.269> a<00:03:10.650> you<00:03:11.650> know

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:11.739 
you can kind of really see a you know

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:15.449 
you can kind of really see a you know
the<00:03:12.069> difference<00:03:12.519> here<00:03:12.790> between<00:03:14.129> the<00:03:15.129> way<00:03:15.280> the

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
the difference here between the way the

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:18.000 
the difference here between the way the
the<00:03:15.819> raine<00:03:16.239> grooves<00:03:16.569> are<00:03:16.780> on<00:03:17.109> this<00:03:17.500> tire<00:03:17.739> and

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:18.010 
the raine grooves are on this tire and

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:20.759 
the raine grooves are on this tire and
had<00:03:18.730> a<00:03:18.760> lot<00:03:18.970> of<00:03:19.060> them<00:03:19.150> that<00:03:19.450> just<00:03:19.480> came<00:03:19.810> mostly

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:20.769 
had a lot of them that just came mostly

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:22.319 
had a lot of them that just came mostly
into<00:03:20.950> the<00:03:21.069> center<00:03:21.340> they<00:03:21.519> kind<00:03:21.730> of<00:03:21.819> crossed<00:03:22.120> the

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:22.329 
into the center they kind of crossed the

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:25.789 
into the center they kind of crossed the
centerline<00:03:22.660> just<00:03:23.079> a<00:03:23.170> little<00:03:23.410> bit<00:03:23.590> here<00:03:24.060> and

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
centerline just a little bit here and

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:30.259 
centerline just a little bit here and
can<00:03:26.799> also<00:03:27.130> see<00:03:27.549> them<00:03:27.760> I<00:03:27.940> was<00:03:28.239> I<00:03:28.530> had<00:03:29.530> completely

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
can also see them I was I had completely

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:34.800 
can also see them I was I had completely
worn<00:03:31.269> out<00:03:31.450> my<00:03:32.760> worn<00:03:33.760> out<00:03:33.940> the<00:03:34.120> tire<00:03:34.299> actually

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 
went right down to the wear indicators

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:44.759 
went right down to the wear indicators
that<00:03:37.480> are<00:03:37.660> on<00:03:37.870> here<00:03:42.000> anyway<00:03:43.230> get<00:03:44.230> an<00:03:44.319> idea<00:03:44.590> what

I get a good feel for it and you know if
I<00:04:07.239> can<00:04:07.419> say<00:04:07.599> is<00:04:07.780> it<00:04:07.930> better<00:04:08.079> than<00:04:08.500> this<00:04:08.620> one

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
I can say is it better than this one

I can say is it better than this one
hopefully<00:04:11.290> yes<00:04:11.470> hopefully<00:04:11.950> it's<00:04:12.220> gonna<00:04:12.310> be
