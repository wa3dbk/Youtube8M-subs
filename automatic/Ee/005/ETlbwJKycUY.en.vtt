00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
exactly the same as this one over here

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.220 
exactly the same as this one over here
Bob<00:00:48.480> just<00:00:48.809> turn<00:00:49.800> this<00:00:49.950> one<00:00:50.129> off<00:00:50.160> because<00:00:51.230> if

you<00:00:52.350> have<00:00:52.469> a<00:00:52.500> few<00:00:52.739> running<00:00:53.070> it<00:00:53.820> makes<00:00:54.270> you<00:00:54.480> our

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
you have a few running it makes you our

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:02.540 
you have a few running it makes you our
world<00:00:54.840> lag<00:00:55.110> a<00:00:55.140> bit<00:00:58.879> so<00:01:00.109> yeah<00:01:01.550> they're

can see I got that and I got this all

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.109 
can see I got that and I got this all
underneath<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.229> floor<00:01:31.439> so<00:01:32.340> if<00:01:32.759> you're<00:01:33.000> gonna

underneath the floor so if you're gonna

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.510 
underneath the floor so if you're gonna
make<00:01:33.299> it<00:01:33.540> floor<00:01:33.900> 1<00:01:33.930> this<00:01:34.380> is<00:01:34.530> much<00:01:34.799> more<00:01:35.159> better

refer<00:01:58.320> back<00:01:58.530> to<00:01:58.590> this<00:01:58.799> one<00:01:59.040> because<00:01:59.820> I've<00:01:59.909> only

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
refer back to this one because I've only

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.340 
refer back to this one because I've only
made<00:02:00.270> it<00:02:00.420> once<00:02:00.630> so<00:02:02.060> yes<00:02:03.060> just<00:02:03.270> turn<00:02:03.750> it<00:02:03.869> off<00:02:03.990> by

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
made it once so yes just turn it off by

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.850 
made it once so yes just turn it off by
you<00:02:05.250> can<00:02:05.490> use<00:02:06.060> to<00:02:06.270> switch<00:02:06.570> right<00:02:06.990> here<00:02:08.450> but

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
you can use to switch right here but

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.550 
you can use to switch right here but
that<00:02:10.860> means<00:02:11.150> this<00:02:12.150> is<00:02:12.360> still<00:02:12.569> running

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
that means this is still running

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.320 
that means this is still running

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
yes you can't really turn it off okay so

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.290 
yes you can't really turn it off okay so
first<00:02:18.660> thing<00:02:18.840> you<00:02:18.870> want<00:02:19.050> to<00:02:19.080> do<00:02:19.230> is<00:02:19.470> get<00:02:20.280> a<00:02:20.550> one

first thing you want to do is get a one

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.850 
first thing you want to do is get a one
two<00:02:21.780> three<00:02:22.230> four

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
whoops eight eight long little platform

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.979 
whoops eight eight long little platform
so<00:02:30.959> one<00:02:31.350> two<00:02:31.770> three<00:02:32.340> four<00:02:32.790> five<00:02:33.239> six<00:02:33.569> seven

then you got a duty underground bit so
if<00:04:57.030> I<00:04:57.180> just<00:04:57.390> want<00:04:57.540> like<00:04:57.630> this<00:04:58.250> and<00:04:59.250> then<00:05:00.020> flip

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
if I just want like this and then flip

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:03.260 
if I just want like this and then flip
the<00:05:01.170> switch<00:05:01.410> like<00:05:01.740> that<00:05:01.920> it<00:05:02.220> will<00:05:02.340> all<00:05:03.090> light

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
the switch like that it will all light

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.260 
the switch like that it will all light
up<00:05:03.300> as<00:05:04.260> you<00:05:04.410> can<00:05:04.560> see<00:05:04.710> so<00:05:05.580> that's<00:05:05.850> the<00:05:06.090> top

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
up as you can see so that's the top

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:09.080 
up as you can see so that's the top
ground<00:05:06.570> top<00:05:07.110> floor<00:05:07.680> if<00:05:08.280> you<00:05:08.400> want<00:05:08.520> to<00:05:08.610> call<00:05:08.760> it

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:09.090 
ground top floor if you want to call it

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:13.460 
ground top floor if you want to call it
top<00:05:09.690> floor<00:05:09.900> bit<00:05:10.260> done<00:05:11.450> and<00:05:12.450> that's<00:05:12.690> I<00:05:13.110> always

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:13.470 
top floor bit done and that's I always

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.650 
top floor bit done and that's I always
thought<00:05:14.040> you<00:05:14.760> could<00:05:14.880> do<00:05:15.000> that<00:05:15.120> to<00:05:15.510> make<00:05:15.600> it

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:15.660 
thought you could do that to make it

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:19.040 
thought you could do that to make it
more<00:05:15.810> compact<00:05:16.700> then<00:05:17.700> this<00:05:18.360> bit<00:05:18.630> is<00:05:18.810> actually

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.050 
more compact then this bit is actually

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:23.260 
more compact then this bit is actually
quite<00:05:19.530> tricky<00:05:19.710> I<00:05:19.950> usually<00:05:20.610> get<00:05:20.700> to<00:05:20.850> say<00:05:21.030> roster

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:23.270 
quite tricky I usually get to say roster

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:26.420 
quite tricky I usually get to say roster
and<00:05:24.270> I<00:05:24.540> did<00:05:24.720> not<00:05:24.870> refer<00:05:25.170> to<00:05:25.200> a<00:05:25.410> video<00:05:25.770> to<00:05:25.860> make

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:26.430 
and I did not refer to a video to make

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:29.300 
and I did not refer to a video to make
this<00:05:28.040> yeah

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:29.310 
this yeah

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:30.890 
this yeah
it<00:05:29.580> doesn't<00:05:29.820> need<00:05:29.880> to<00:05:30.000> be<00:05:30.030> this<00:05:30.180> big<00:05:30.420> but<00:05:30.450> I

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 
it doesn't need to be this big but I

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:36.010 
it doesn't need to be this big but I
just<00:05:31.440> like<00:05:31.560> making<00:05:31.770> it<00:05:31.950> bigger<00:05:32.370> just<00:05:32.760> in<00:05:32.970> case

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:36.020 

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:37.610 

don't<00:05:37.020> do<00:05:37.170> that

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:02.490 
that's that that and then open this bit

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:05.300

up<00:06:02.640> here<00:06:02.970> as<00:06:03.180> you<00:06:03.480> see<00:06:03.690> from<00:06:03.840> over<00:06:04.020> here<00:06:04.410> you

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:05.310 
up here as you see from over here you

00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:07.970 
up here as you see from over here you
open<00:06:05.820> it<00:06:05.880> up<00:06:06.000> one<00:06:06.450> more<00:06:06.480> so<00:06:07.050> they<00:06:07.470> don't<00:06:07.740> talk

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:07.980 
open it up one more so they don't talk

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:12.370 
open it up one more so they don't talk
to<00:06:08.160> that<00:06:08.190> and<00:06:08.550> then<00:06:08.670> it<00:06:09.030> goes<00:06:09.060> like<00:06:09.330> that<00:06:09.360> so

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:12.380 

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:16.040 

didn't<00:06:13.380> you<00:06:13.500> go<00:06:13.680> to<00:06:13.710> go<00:06:14.270> like<00:06:15.270> one<00:06:15.510> along<00:06:15.810> there

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:16.050 
didn't you go to go like one along there

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:19.880 
didn't you go to go like one along there
there<00:06:16.620> there<00:06:16.860> and<00:06:17.070> there

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:19.890 

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:22.670 

and<00:06:20.660> because<00:06:21.660> they're<00:06:21.810> connecting<00:06:22.170> that<00:06:22.320> you

00:06:22.670 --> 00:06:22.680 
and because they're connecting that you

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:26.870 
and because they're connecting that you
could<00:06:22.800> just<00:06:22.950> break<00:06:23.160> that<00:06:23.400> off<00:06:23.550> there<00:06:25.460> up<00:06:26.460> again

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:26.880 
could just break that off there up again

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:31.749 
could just break that off there up again
and<00:06:28.820> that's<00:06:29.820> basically<00:06:30.210> this<00:06:30.480> bit<00:06:30.690> done

00:06:31.749 --> 00:06:31.759 
and that's basically this bit done

00:06:31.759 --> 00:06:38.760 
and that's basically this bit done
now<00:06:32.629> you<00:06:33.559> got<00:06:33.710> a<00:06:34.089> pure<00:06:35.710> power<00:06:36.710> line<00:06:36.919> up<00:06:37.099> say

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:38.770 
now you got a pure power line up say

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:42.239 
now you got a pure power line up say
that'll<00:06:39.770> be<00:06:40.749> okay

00:06:42.239 --> 00:06:42.249 
that'll be okay

00:06:42.249 --> 00:06:44.559 
that'll be okay
couple<00:06:43.249> these<00:06:43.339> in<00:06:43.520> my<00:06:43.610> parkour<00:06:43.999> videos<00:06:44.360> as

00:06:44.559 --> 00:06:44.569 
couple these in my parkour videos as

00:06:44.569 --> 00:06:47.589 
couple these in my parkour videos as
well<00:06:44.749> you<00:06:44.930> know<00:06:45.110> well<00:06:46.180> so<00:06:47.180> did<00:06:47.240> that<00:06:47.449> be<00:06:47.569> just
