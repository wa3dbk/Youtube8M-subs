play it slow for you guys so what's
happening<00:00:26.460> here<00:00:26.519> is<00:00:26.880> we're<00:00:27.300> playing<00:00:27.510> out<00:00:27.689> of

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
happening here is we're playing out of

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.099 
happening here is we're playing out of
our<00:00:27.960> a<00:00:28.740> minor<00:00:29.310> pentatonic<00:00:29.789> box<00:00:30.359> and<00:00:30.750> what

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
our a minor pentatonic box and what

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:37.700 
our a minor pentatonic box and what
we're<00:00:31.199> doing<00:00:31.230> is<00:00:31.590> take<00:00:35.360> and<00:00:36.590> because<00:00:37.590> the

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
we're doing is take and because the

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.740 
we're doing is take and because the
diminished<00:00:38.129> scale<00:00:38.340> repeats<00:00:38.820> in<00:00:39.030> minor<00:00:39.300> thirds

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
diminished scale repeats in minor thirds

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.040 
diminished scale repeats in minor thirds
we<00:00:40.170> can<00:00:40.350> move<00:00:40.469> everything<00:00:40.800> up<00:00:41.160> three<00:00:41.700> frets<00:00:42.050> so

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
we can move everything up three frets so

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.990 
we can move everything up three frets so
what<00:00:43.680> we're<00:00:43.800> doing<00:00:43.829> is<00:00:44.070> taking<00:00:44.280> this<00:00:44.550> idea<00:00:44.850> is

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
what we're doing is taking this idea is

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.389 
what we're doing is taking this idea is
using<00:00:45.510> slides<00:00:45.960> to<00:00:46.440> connect<00:00:46.860> each<00:00:47.100> of<00:00:47.309> the

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
using slides to connect each of the

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.580 
using slides to connect each of the
boxes<00:00:47.629> so<00:00:48.629> here's<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.289> first<00:00:49.469> one<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:51.590> then

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
boxes so here's the first one and then

00:00:52.590 --> 00:01:03.619 
boxes so here's the first one and then
slide<00:00:52.920> up<00:01:01.219> so<00:01:02.219> oftentimes<00:01:02.789> what<00:01:03.090> I<00:01:03.180> try<00:01:03.359> to<00:01:03.390> do

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
slide up so oftentimes what I try to do

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.020 
slide up so oftentimes what I try to do
is<00:01:03.870> use<00:01:04.290> subtle<00:01:04.739> variations<00:01:05.339> so<00:01:05.489> not<00:01:05.670> using

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
is use subtle variations so not using

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.210 
is use subtle variations so not using
the<00:01:06.090> same<00:01:06.360> thing<00:01:06.600> each<00:01:06.630> time<00:01:06.750> salt<00:01:07.290> I'll<00:01:07.500> skip

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
the same thing each time salt I'll skip

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.070 
the same thing each time salt I'll skip
one<00:01:08.490> of<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.670> hammer<00:01:08.880> ons<00:01:09.119> or<00:01:09.479> do<00:01:09.810> something

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
one of the hammer ons or do something

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:17.539 
one of the hammer ons or do something
like<00:01:10.229> like<00:01:15.439> so<00:01:16.439> trying<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:16.799> do<00:01:16.979> a<00:01:17.250> different

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
like like so trying to do a different

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.520 
like like so trying to do a different
one<00:01:17.729> on<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.299> way<00:01:18.450> up<00:01:18.600> so<00:01:18.780> as<00:01:18.900> you<00:01:19.049> move<00:01:19.229> it<00:01:19.380> up

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530 
one on the way up so as you move it up

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.440 
one on the way up so as you move it up
in<00:01:20.009> a<00:01:20.040> moving<00:01:20.340> at<00:01:20.520> least<00:01:20.729> these<00:01:20.880> patterns<00:01:21.150> so

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
in a moving at least these patterns so

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.359 
in a moving at least these patterns so
you<00:01:21.540> go<00:01:21.630> like<00:01:23.810> and<00:01:24.810> you<00:01:25.140> end<00:01:25.320> up<00:01:25.500> back<00:01:26.070> in<00:01:26.100> your

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
you go like and you end up back in your

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.740 
you go like and you end up back in your
a<00:01:26.400> minor<00:01:26.640> pentatonic<00:01:27.090> box<00:01:27.600> an<00:01:27.840> octave<00:01:28.259> higher

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
a minor pentatonic box an octave higher

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.999 
a minor pentatonic box an octave higher
so<00:01:30.750> the<00:01:30.869> important<00:01:31.320> thing<00:01:31.500> and<00:01:31.710> this<00:01:31.799> goes

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
so the important thing and this goes

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.219 
so the important thing and this goes
back<00:01:32.040> to<00:01:32.490> one<00:01:33.119> of<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.299> things<00:01:33.479> that<00:01:33.600> that<00:01:34.170> I

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
back to one of the things that that I

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.140 
back to one of the things that that I
like<00:01:34.380> to<00:01:34.500> talk<00:01:34.680> about<00:01:34.799> is<00:01:35.040> making<00:01:35.640> it<00:01:35.909> not<00:01:36.090> a

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
like to talk about is making it not a

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.810 
like to talk about is making it not a
lick<00:01:36.600> and<00:01:36.869> making<00:01:36.990> it<00:01:37.259> an<00:01:37.439> idea<00:01:37.890> or<00:01:38.100> concept<00:01:38.130> so

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
lick and making it an idea or concept so

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.760 
lick and making it an idea or concept so
coming<00:01:39.240> out<00:01:39.450> of<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.750> lick<00:01:39.900> is<00:01:40.049> very<00:01:40.290> important

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
coming out of the lick is very important

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.160 
coming out of the lick is very important
so<00:01:41.400> you<00:01:41.880> want<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.150> end<00:01:42.360> it<00:01:42.600> in<00:01:42.750> a<00:01:42.990> way<00:01:43.140> that

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
so you want to end it in a way that

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.929 
so you want to end it in a way that
sounds<00:01:43.649> musical<00:01:44.070> rather<00:01:44.220> than<00:01:44.369> just<00:01:44.549> ending

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
sounds musical rather than just ending

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.819 
sounds musical rather than just ending
it<00:01:45.060> at<00:01:45.210> the<00:01:45.630> when<00:01:45.930> you<00:01:46.049> get<00:01:46.140> to<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.350> box<00:01:46.560> so

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
it at the when you get to the box so
