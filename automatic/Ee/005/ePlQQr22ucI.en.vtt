number 53 I find this actually little

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.510 
number 53 I find this actually little
bit<00:01:38.609> light<00:01:39.240> I<00:01:39.750> know<00:01:39.990> it's<00:01:40.140> 50<00:01:40.439> dragging<00:01:40.859> from

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
bit light I know it's 50 dragging from

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.060 
bit light I know it's 50 dragging from
what<00:01:41.700> I<00:01:41.729> actually<00:01:42.479> the<00:01:42.780> dark<00:01:43.079> they<00:01:43.560> have<00:01:43.799> there

what I actually the dark they have there

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.679 
what I actually the dark they have there
so<00:01:44.700> it's<00:01:44.850> not<00:01:45.000> true<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:46.130> done<00:01:47.130> but<00:01:47.490> that's<00:01:48.329> ok

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
so it's not true to done but that's ok

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:55.010 
so it's not true to done but that's ok
we<00:01:49.409> will<00:01:49.789> blend<00:01:50.789> that<00:01:50.969> out<00:01:51.030> I<00:01:53.509> don't<00:01:54.509> like<00:01:54.719> it

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
it just looks wrong but if you blended

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.520 
it just looks wrong but if you blended
and<00:02:02.429> mix<00:02:02.640> it<00:02:02.820> out<00:02:03.079> too<00:02:04.079> bad<00:02:05.240> if<00:02:06.240> you<00:02:06.810> are<00:02:07.020> fit<00:02:07.259> is
