00:00:07.559 --> 00:00:10.200

 occasion we are back chroma for 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.219
 parkour called chest pair cheesy 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.139
 means parkour of the chest of the chest 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.689
 whatever, so we started to see ok 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.910
 says welcome is parkour map made 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:22.350
 for minecraft and mp more maps waiting 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.150
 by subscribe so remember that the 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.470
 description was left your channel or something by 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.170
 here you can see that we have a few 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:30.210
 things we have spawn eggs so 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.590
 before we start with everything we will leave 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.899
 put in this chest I do not know why but 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.090
 well we have some walls we have some 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.429
 stairs so I felt like wanting 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.749
 be parkour I do not know why it shined and 

00:00:37.429 --> 00:00:41.609
 it woke up my year parkour instinct so 

00:00:39.749 --> 00:00:43.859
 I'm going to do a little bit of parkour 

00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:45.389
 the pig the chicken the sheep and we 

00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:47.219
 we will take a francisca ok 

00:00:45.389 --> 00:00:48.690
 we leave now carlos sampling and good 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.639
 because we have rules and they say what 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.960
 next do not put it to talk blocks 

00:00:50.639 --> 00:00:53.519
 except sand 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.949
 you must sleep before playing Juan in 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:57.449
 pittsburgh thank god i like that 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.489
 map so you can also see here 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.600
 that the map itself would be of chests like this 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.999
 that here you can see that it is night 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.430
 we checkpoint and start with 

00:01:02.999 --> 00:01:06.869
 this adventure of chests so then 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.159
 remember that the description I leave you 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.810
 which is the download link so that 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.340
 you can play it and what practice is 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.200
 opening so here it says it breaks 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.030
 and then we begin to see now what we 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.530
 the destiny with the chests for the 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.390
 sand when you're ready so we're 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:21.490
 ready with a francisca of course 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.079
 as a lucky charm and 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.299
 we start with this time that it gives us 

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:28.179
 this as soon as blogs everything is very nice 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:30.069
 to see and well then clearly the map 

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:33.459
 will be on chests because a few days ago 

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:34.810
 ok says wow wow no money 

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:37.030
 anyone so you can see over here 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.159
 the map is basically from dedicated 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.840
 you take them so we jump around here and 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:42.429
 I wanted to discuss things with you today 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.950
 that more or less will be said by the 

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:47.020
 way to here says guagua like that 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.729

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.310
 for cures so I wanted to tell you 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:52.899
 also that pussy you never fall 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.340
 I had made a cobras map so 

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:56.110
 this one I'm liking are ringing me 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.399
 the fingers as always and half 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.469
 I wanted to say that today I have 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:01.390
 a lot of homework really guys if 

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:03.099
 you know how many homework I have 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:04.959
 would charge then I have homework 

00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:07.270
 accounting I have material from 

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:09.640
 math I have homework also of language 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.940
 Spanish as well as any language and 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.620
 sadly I see myself then a little 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.180
 limited to be video so well then 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.160
 they know that if I do not upload more video than some 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.520
 day is because I have a lot of homework ok 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.980
 simple 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:24.070
 something that I hate but I have to do it and 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:25.690
 I want to serve well, he says, not even 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:27.490
 the most virtuous can be saved level 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.050
 3 parkour so let's concentrate 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:30.910
 now I told you that I have a lot 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.590
 task and well then you know if I do not upload 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.110
 videos because basically they are my 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.540
 obligations that prevent me from doing it ok 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:39.640
 we have here a jump carefully we 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.710
 we concentrate here and well then 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.840
 remember to get off the map as well 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:45.700
 is really enjoying what you have cobras 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.170
 and everything is very beautiful so if there is something 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.700
 that shits me more than the sound of 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.560
 zombies man in minecraft is the sound 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.650
 of the fire that is to cover you all united 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:57.520
 and it's very castrating to see in order to see 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:03:03.670
 that we have now here says ok ops 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:06.370
 as it is and it is something very for what already 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.620
 we have more or less a pixel art to see 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.810
 that we have to be my god because it seems 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.310
 that we have the path removed and then 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.140
 nothing that you already know that I love 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.450
 make video but it's just that 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:19.750
 times that I can not and seriously I hope that 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.430
 understand me you know, I think it did not happen 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.620
 100% of the day doing videos yo 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.030
 just then because I like it and 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.470
 because I have plenty of time that way 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.910
 over here although there are times that I have to 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.459
 to say that I do it more than for the task 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.200
 then it is simply something that I should 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:34.000
 avoid doing a lot of youtube because 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:37.480
 I also have homework so we have 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.670
 here the chests and I will be able to see that 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.260
 we have is a giant goat and says a 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.600
 very short video I do not know I think it will be the 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.010
 so then I hope you like it 

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.630
 boys and well I found it 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.310
 by the eps forum and asked universe for 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:51.040
 what I decided to upload it I really liked the 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:53.709
 screen 7 then I said or why not to see 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:56.980
 we have here a jump that sees a little 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:04:00.550
 difficult me then I 'm going to concentrate 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:03.700
 now and already great then we continue to see 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:06.700
 Carefully, calm down, we're not going to 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:09.519
 to do it quiet is everything calmly other 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:11.470
 jump like this for a demon and 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:12.760
 well remember that also in the 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:15.160
 comments you can leave your bets 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.660
 as always if you think I'll pass it if 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:19.150
 do you think I 'm mad at the valve so why 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:21.040
 the moment I do not get angry usually 

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.380
 parkour is something that bothers me a lot 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:25.300
 but today I feel very relaxed despite 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.740
 that I have a lot of homework I feel very 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.050
 alright then I said why not do a 

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:30.550
 parkour jazz video and now how good 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:30.910
 It had not been going up for some time and 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.770
 felt 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:34.600
 so also remember that if you want 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.520
 more parkour let me know by 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:39.040
 twitter facebook or comments or by 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.180
 wherever and I will look for more maps and what 

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.770
 I will go up so that you can 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.450
 entertain themselves by playing also what 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.670
 to say that we know how to take care of ourselves here 

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:47.140
 I dedicate the chests are one of the blocks 

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:48.880
 what I like about minecraft in fact 

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:51.550
 so you can see that they are very pretty 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:54.040
 it's like a very unique block having 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:55.660
 basements now carefully we're going towards 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:05:00.190
 here the one that offers everything can happen in 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:05:02.260

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:06.220

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:08.830
 perfect care says the end a map 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:10.540

 your decision jumps to meet the 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:20.430
 death 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:24.460
 fuck what is this damn ya ya 

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:28.690
 clearly there is if he dies I did not believe that 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:31.110
 we would die and it would be like that 

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:33.729
 as always when you go through the lava and 

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:35.380
 damn that trolling seriously like that 

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:37.060
 that we go back a while boys so that 

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:38.650
 we see the casket and good we 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:40.810
 back here mainer yes they can see 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:42.130
 that here we have what is the chest 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:43.600
 which is very well done I like 

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:45.820
 a lot is not the biggest of all the 

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:47.979
 story but it's very beautiful so a 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:49.660
 applause for creator and I was looking 

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:51.639
 what is the ladder because it says the 

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:53.350
 cost of the network leader nation remember 

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:55.330
 how do you pronounce see the ladder but 

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:57.130
 I can not find any stairs 

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:59.169
 that then there is no other more to break 

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:01.030
 although the rule says not to break blocks 

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:02.470
 I'll have to do it for us to do 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:06.250
 inside the chest so to see here 

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:07.600
 we will put this and a little bit of this and go 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:09.580
 that he has is inside that and I do not know why 

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:10.930
 what out of nowhere I started the german 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:13.240
 craft was because the week started the 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:15.490
 ipad then I do not know ok to see what we have 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:16.990
 in this part it says above 

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:18.610
 maybe this is the ladder that I 

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:20.259
 they were asking but it's a way of 

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:23.050
 true that you can not enter or that is 

00:06:20.259 --> 00:06:25.840
 like in plan or train and good to see 

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:28.560
 what is this we go through here and I do not 

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:31.569
 say that is the beginning 

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:32.770
 Well and I think this would be it 

00:06:31.569 --> 00:06:34.389
