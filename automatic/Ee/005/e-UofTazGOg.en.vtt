wonder if still how they're gonna adapt

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.800 
wonder if still how they're gonna adapt
fast<00:01:22.350> as<00:01:22.649> the<00:01:22.829> change<00:01:23.250> of<00:01:23.429> climate<00:01:23.670> is<00:01:24.060> that's

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
fast as the change of climate is that's

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.859 
fast as the change of climate is that's
gonna<00:01:25.020> be<00:01:25.200> amazing<00:01:26.060> especially<00:01:27.060> considering

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
gonna be amazing especially considering

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.450 
gonna be amazing especially considering

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
there aren't even able to breed now

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
Everglades I still think we need a

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.949 
Everglades I still think we need a
recount<00:01:47.330> but<00:01:48.330> I<00:01:48.390> don't<00:01:48.539> want<00:01:48.659> anybody

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
yeah must be antifreeze I don't know why

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.520 
yeah must be antifreeze I don't know why
they<00:03:57.120> I<00:03:57.450> don't<00:03:57.569> know<00:03:57.750> why<00:03:57.989> they<00:03:58.170> didn't<00:03:58.379> put

they I don't know why they didn't put
that<00:03:58.560> in<00:03:58.709> the<00:03:58.890> study<00:03:59.480> there<00:04:00.480> guys<00:04:00.829> know<00:04:01.829> there

00:04:02.119 --> 00:04:02.129 
that in the study there guys know there

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:04.220 
that in the study there guys know there
are<00:04:02.250> some<00:04:02.400> frogs<00:04:02.730> in<00:04:02.970> the<00:04:03.090> South<00:04:03.629> America<00:04:04.110> that

are some frogs in the South America that

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.920 
are some frogs in the South America that
actually<00:04:04.560> did<00:04:04.739> it<00:04:04.890> well<00:04:05.819> that<00:04:06.030> guys<00:04:06.269> like<00:04:06.540> Utah

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
actually did it well that guys like Utah

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.259 
actually did it well that guys like Utah
is<00:04:07.379> that<00:04:07.590> cooler<00:04:07.890> without<00:04:08.190> marking<00:04:09.030> on<00:04:09.120> its

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
this is all this blood is all about it's

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.900 
this is all this blood is all about it's
called<00:04:18.350> c-sections<00:04:19.430> we're<00:04:20.430> ensuring<00:04:20.880> that

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
called c-sections we're ensuring that

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:22.430 
called c-sections we're ensuring that
everybody's<00:04:21.479> gonna<00:04:21.600> make<00:04:21.840> it<00:04:21.989> out<00:04:22.109> alive

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
everybody's gonna make it out alive

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.830 
everybody's gonna make it out alive
we've<00:04:22.800> been<00:04:22.949> doing<00:04:23.220> this<00:04:23.310> for<00:04:23.550> a<00:04:23.789> lot<00:04:24.419> of<00:04:24.449> years

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
we've been doing this for a lot of years

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.159 
we've been doing this for a lot of years
and<00:04:25.680> we've<00:04:25.889> have<00:04:26.100> zero<00:04:27.060> problems<00:04:27.690> with<00:04:27.840> doing

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:28.169 
and we've have zero problems with doing

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:29.629 
and we've have zero problems with doing
it<00:04:28.289> so<00:04:28.500> if<00:04:28.590> you're<00:04:28.680> wondering<00:04:28.919> why<00:04:29.160> we<00:04:29.310> do<00:04:29.490> it

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:29.639 
it so if you're wondering why we do it

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:32.270 
it so if you're wondering why we do it
it's<00:04:30.419> not<00:04:30.750> because<00:04:31.169> we<00:04:31.380> got<00:04:31.590> a<00:04:31.620> study<00:04:31.979> made

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
it's not because we got a study made

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:33.890 
it's not because we got a study made
that<00:04:32.520> said<00:04:32.699> it<00:04:32.820> was<00:04:32.910> okay<00:04:33.270> it's<00:04:33.479> because<00:04:33.750> we

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
that said it was okay it's because we

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.909 
that said it was okay it's because we
did<00:04:34.139> a<00:04:34.169> study<00:04:34.470> for<00:04:34.979> the<00:04:35.430> last<00:04:35.990> 15<00:04:36.990> 18<00:04:37.410> years<00:04:37.440> of

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:37.919 
did a study for the last 15 18 years of

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:40.250 
did a study for the last 15 18 years of
hatching<00:04:38.340> eggs<00:04:38.490> like<00:04:38.699> this<00:04:38.910> so<00:04:39.260> actually

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:40.260 
hatching eggs like this so actually

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.560
