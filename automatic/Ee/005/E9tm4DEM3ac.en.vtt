00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:09.570
 there is a breakdown of paradigms 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:11.730
 change over and create a new concept 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.730
 this new concept should become a new 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:18.150
 standard this pattern would be repeated over 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.630
 years of pavement per floor throughout 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.630
 the website 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:31.419
 and if it has already been 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.370
 retrofitados it is already new and the part of 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:34.870
 interior was that it needed a 

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.390
 complete reformulation 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:39.699
 and it was not just an aesthetic 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:42.160
 really a behavioral revolution 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:44.230
 a change of making people 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:47.559
 work the part of 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:50.280
 communication synergy of the teams 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:53.379
 teamwork and this often 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.780
 architecture changes. 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:58.180
 way people work 40 years 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.080
 ago 30 were much more works 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.519
 individual 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.470
 so people had their lines 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:04.510
 and closed time when 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.640
 meet in the meeting room if it is not 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:09.610
 more reality 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.890
 so we decreased screen height 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.470
 they had a situation that was already 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:17.710
 half open space but all biomes 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:20.049
 they were more or less one meter 41 and 60 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.150
 then you saw only the open roof 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:24.100
 people I saw each one in that 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.750
 cubicle when you need it a lot 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.430
 secrecy in a meeting room that is 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.470
 funny, we're going to work with 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:34.119
 double glazing with walls and plasterboard 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:37.719
 the double drywall is fully stuffed 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:39.670
 with glass rock wool and the factors 

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:41.829
 can also become more densely- 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:45.729
 is directly linked to the cost of 

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:47.499
 so the more acoustical a wall a 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:49.770
 little more expensive it is time to 

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:49.770
 run 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.430
 I really like to use colors when 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.110
 when the project allows and 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.900
 in the case of Bahia 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:02.540
 each segment of each business unit 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.640
 have some preferences for color then 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.560
 had the floor that used the most green had 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.509
 another floor that used more orange we 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.660
 we use a product called tri 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:13.310
 form is a product until douglas he is 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.560
 recycled pet then you have a whole 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.569
 sustainability footprint as well 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.700
 this panel allows customization 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:21.080
 that you can put inside it what 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.910
 Do you want the staff of 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.760
 agrobusiness we put inside the 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.720
 panel of seed products that they 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.300
 trade 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:33.650
 So we have a panel with grains of 

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:35.530
 coffee with seeds with rice with 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.080
 cotton 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:42.910
 we use a carpeted interface board 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:45.580
 with a suitable weight and plate 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:48.610
 because I made it high and it allows 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.170
 greater flexibility of the mezzanine to 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.090
 cabling management 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.370
 this gives great flexibility and 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:57.340
 Layout reshuffles everything but us 

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:00.370
 we use double or single partitions 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:01.390
 depending on the room were provided by 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.420
 bacterium 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:07.300
 with or without blinds and often only 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:10.030
 how to video a video 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:12.340
 we worked with furniture that was 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.560
 specially developed for them 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.370
 by a market partner who in the case 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.500
 was the record 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:19.450
 We have cabinets whose doors are 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.940
 made of material that you 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:24.370
 can write then it becomes 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.470
 small white boards 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.660
 person can leave a message for the 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.910
 colleague can write down the same 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:34.930
 reminder this was also developed from 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:38.560
 agreement and obviously the chairs is also 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:40.930
 being part of the product group 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:44.320
 that meet ergonomics some pillars 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:47.140
 Turned around briefly into shelves and 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.850
 along the windows there were 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.700
 some structures that we can not 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:53.680
 to remove and sit down 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.690
 a kind of flower pots but the flowers 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.850
 do not just happen on the pillar they 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.650
 happen along the window then the 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:03.070
 people have created throughout the 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:05.019
 facade on some floors of a system 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:07.090
 air storage even mixed with 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:09.040
 landscaping 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.140
 I think this is very cool because 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.150
 you also appropriate a little of the 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:15.190
 space and you feel that there is a little 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:18.160
 from your home we work with one of the 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:20.560
 groups where the director was a person without 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:23.020
 absolutely fantastic and brought the 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.490
 family of employees for the 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.710
 opening party without him 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.479
 I knew it and when they entered it 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.520
 all were family members each 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:33.100
 waiting for your collaborator in 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.260
 I think this is what I 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:38.880
 I believe that our greatest mission is 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:38.880
 make projects out of the curve
