comparing<00:00:13.959> the<00:00:14.049> Lumia<00:00:14.379> 920<00:00:15.009> to<00:00:15.190> the<00:00:15.309> Lumia<00:00:15.700> 900

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:16.600 
comparing the Lumia 920 to the Lumia 900

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.510 
comparing the Lumia 920 to the Lumia 900
the<00:00:16.840> Lumia<00:00:17.230> 900<00:00:17.680> was<00:00:17.860> kind<00:00:18.160> of<00:00:18.220> like<00:00:18.369> the

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:18.520 
the Lumia 900 was kind of like the

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.359 
the Lumia 900 was kind of like the
predecessor<00:00:19.240> of<00:00:20.140> course<00:00:20.470> the<00:00:20.650> 920<00:00:21.189> is<00:00:21.220> a

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:21.369 
predecessor of course the 920 is a

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:24.330 
predecessor of course the 920 is a
successor<00:00:22.119> so<00:00:22.439> I'm<00:00:23.439> gonna<00:00:23.560> go<00:00:23.769> over<00:00:23.859> a<00:00:23.920> variety

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:24.340 
successor so I'm gonna go over a variety

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:25.829 
successor so I'm gonna go over a variety
different<00:00:24.369> things<00:00:24.880> mostly<00:00:25.269> relating<00:00:25.720> to

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:25.839 
different things mostly relating to

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:28.189 
different things mostly relating to
specs<00:00:26.199> and<00:00:26.500> the<00:00:26.589> features<00:00:26.980> things<00:00:27.670> like<00:00:27.880> that

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
specs and the features things like that

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.839 
specs and the features things like that
and<00:00:29.199> let's<00:00:29.439> get<00:00:29.560> started<00:00:29.830> so<00:00:29.890> the<00:00:30.160> processor

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:30.849 
and let's get started so the processor

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:34.230 
and let's get started so the processor
on<00:00:31.119> the<00:00:31.200> 920<00:00:32.200> is<00:00:32.230> a<00:00:32.380> dual-core<00:00:33.010> 1.5<00:00:33.910> gigahertz

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:34.240 
on the 920 is a dual-core 1.5 gigahertz

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:38.010 
on the 920 is a dual-core 1.5 gigahertz
Snapdragon<00:00:35.050> s4<00:00:35.800> processor<00:00:36.280> the<00:00:37.120> Lumia<00:00:37.450> 900

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:38.020 
Snapdragon s4 processor the Lumia 900

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:39.990 
Snapdragon s4 processor the Lumia 900
has<00:00:38.170> a<00:00:38.200> single<00:00:38.649> core<00:00:38.860> 1.4<00:00:39.670> gigahertz

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.000 
has a single core 1.4 gigahertz

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.090 
has a single core 1.4 gigahertz
Snapdragon<00:00:40.719> processor<00:00:41.680> so<00:00:41.949> you're

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.100 
Snapdragon processor so you're

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.369 
Snapdragon processor so you're
definitely<00:00:42.280> getting<00:00:42.579> a<00:00:42.820> huge<00:00:43.090> bump<00:00:43.629> a<00:00:43.840> huge

00:00:44.369 --> 00:00:44.379 
definitely getting a huge bump a huge

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:47.160 
definitely getting a huge bump a huge
upgrade<00:00:44.649> with<00:00:45.129> the<00:00:45.160> 920<00:00:45.820> in<00:00:46.690> terms<00:00:46.960> of

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.170 
upgrade with the 920 in terms of

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:48.689 
upgrade with the 920 in terms of
operating<00:00:47.680> system<00:00:48.100> there's<00:00:48.280> a<00:00:48.340> bit<00:00:48.520> of<00:00:48.550> a

00:00:48.689 --> 00:00:48.699 
operating system there's a bit of a

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:51.209 
operating system there's a bit of a
difference<00:00:49.239> here<00:00:49.539> the<00:00:49.989> Lumia<00:00:50.469> 900<00:00:51.100> is

00:00:51.209 --> 00:00:51.219 
difference here the Lumia 900 is

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:54.420 
difference here the Lumia 900 is
actually<00:00:51.579> capped<00:00:51.910> off<00:00:52.210> at<00:00:52.510> Windows<00:00:53.140> Phone<00:00:53.430> 7.8

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:54.430 
actually capped off at Windows Phone 7.8

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.369 
actually capped off at Windows Phone 7.8
which<00:00:54.730> itself<00:00:55.210> is<00:00:55.449> in<00:00:55.660> a<00:00:55.719> bad<00:00:55.870> operating

00:00:56.369 --> 00:00:56.379 
which itself is in a bad operating

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:59.160 
which itself is in a bad operating
system<00:00:56.800> however<00:00:57.309> Windows<00:00:58.090> Phone<00:00:58.329> 8<00:00:58.570> is<00:00:58.899> the

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
system however Windows Phone 8 is the

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.020 
system however Windows Phone 8 is the
operating<00:00:59.590> system<00:00:59.649> you<00:01:00.100> probably<00:01:00.309> want<00:01:00.910> to

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:01.030 
operating system you probably want to

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.110 
operating system you probably want to
have<00:01:01.300> because<00:01:01.829> once<00:01:02.829> you<00:01:02.949> have<00:01:03.129> 7.8<00:01:03.850> there's

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:04.120 
have because once you have 7.8 there's

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:06.570 
have because once you have 7.8 there's
no<00:01:04.300> going<00:01:04.660> up<00:01:04.840> you're<00:01:05.170> stuck<00:01:05.530> at<00:01:05.740> 7.8<00:01:06.370> and

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:06.580 
no going up you're stuck at 7.8 and

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.120 
no going up you're stuck at 7.8 and
that's<00:01:06.790> where<00:01:07.090> the<00:01:07.240> Lumia<00:01:07.570> 900<00:01:08.049> is<00:01:08.170> therefore

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 
that's where the Lumia 900 is therefore

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.370 
that's where the Lumia 900 is therefore
you<00:01:09.580> should<00:01:09.790> probably<00:01:10.030> get<00:01:10.240> the<00:01:10.420> Lumia<00:01:10.810> 920

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
you should probably get the Lumia 920

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.590 
you should probably get the Lumia 920
because<00:01:11.770> you<00:01:12.220> little<00:01:12.640> ship<00:01:12.880> with<00:01:13.090> Windows

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
because you little ship with Windows

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.289 
because you little ship with Windows
Phone<00:01:13.630> 8<00:01:14.080> and<00:01:14.590> of<00:01:15.250> course<00:01:15.460> you'll<00:01:15.640> probably<00:01:15.820> be

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:16.299 
Phone 8 and of course you'll probably be

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:18.749 
Phone 8 and of course you'll probably be
getting<00:01:16.450> upgrades<00:01:17.049> beyond<00:01:17.470> that<00:01:17.650> as<00:01:17.799> well<00:01:18.009> in

00:01:18.749 --> 00:01:18.759 
getting upgrades beyond that as well in

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:21.060 
getting upgrades beyond that as well in
terms<00:01:18.820> of<00:01:19.180> RAM<00:01:19.390> the<00:01:19.869> 920<00:01:20.650> is<00:01:20.710> gonna<00:01:20.890> have<00:01:21.040> one

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 
terms of RAM the 920 is gonna have one

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.660 
terms of RAM the 920 is gonna have one
gig<00:01:21.520> and<00:01:21.700> the<00:01:21.970> 900<00:01:22.720> had<00:01:23.020> only<00:01:23.350> 512<00:01:24.159> megabytes

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
gig and the 900 had only 512 megabytes

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.580 
gig and the 900 had only 512 megabytes
of<00:01:24.820> RAM<00:01:25.240> and<00:01:25.570> you<00:01:25.869> also<00:01:26.020> have<00:01:26.200> to<00:01:26.320> keep<00:01:26.470> in<00:01:26.560> mind

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
of RAM and you also have to keep in mind

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:29.010 
of RAM and you also have to keep in mind
that<00:01:26.890> Windows<00:01:27.159> Phone<00:01:27.340> 8<00:01:27.610> runs<00:01:27.909> seamless<00:01:28.750> on

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
that Windows Phone 8 runs seamless on

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.130 
that Windows Phone 8 runs seamless on
low<00:01:29.710> specs<00:01:30.189> so<00:01:30.759> this<00:01:31.000> dual<00:01:31.299> core<00:01:31.630> and<00:01:31.750> this<00:01:31.899> one

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:32.140 
low specs so this dual core and this one

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.170 
low specs so this dual core and this one

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.180 
gig of ram is just gonna be like icing

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.090 
gig of ram is just gonna be like icing
on<00:01:34.270> the<00:01:34.420> cake<00:01:34.600> it's<00:01:34.840> just<00:01:35.049> gonna<00:01:35.170> make<00:01:35.439> it<00:01:35.500> run
