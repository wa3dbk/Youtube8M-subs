I don't know try and cover his arms he's

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.670 
I don't know try and cover his arms he's
he's<00:01:43.799> small<00:01:44.990> so<00:01:45.990> much<00:01:46.170> has<00:01:46.290> been<00:01:46.320> said<00:01:46.619> about

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
he's small so much has been said about

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.490 
he's small so much has been said about
how<00:01:47.670> tall<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.360> outside<00:01:48.750> linebackers<00:01:49.409> are

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
how tall the outside linebackers are

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.010 
how tall the outside linebackers are
between<00:01:49.770> you<00:01:50.040> and<00:01:50.220> Bronson<00:01:50.759> how<00:01:51.600> do<00:01:51.659> you<00:01:51.780> feel

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
between you and Bronson how do you feel

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.410 
between you and Bronson how do you feel
about<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:52.829> length<00:01:53.040> and<00:01:53.280> what<00:01:53.729> that<00:01:53.909> brings<00:01:54.119> to

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
about the length and what that brings to

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.380 
about the length and what that brings to
the<00:01:54.540> BYU<00:01:54.689> football<00:01:55.020> program<00:01:55.590> in<00:01:55.619> 2014<00:01:56.310> I<00:01:56.520> mean

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
the BYU football program in 2014 I mean

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.719 
the BYU football program in 2014 I mean
I<00:01:57.659> usually<00:01:57.990> think<00:01:58.140> I<00:01:58.320> was<00:01:58.469> like<00:01:59.100> a<00:01:59.130> little<00:01:59.549> too

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
I usually think I was like a little too

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.399 
I usually think I was like a little too
tall<00:02:00.000> to<00:02:00.149> play<00:02:00.270> outside<00:02:00.420> linebacker<00:02:00.659> but<00:02:01.229> now

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
tall to play outside linebacker but now

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.620 
tall to play outside linebacker but now
with<00:02:01.619> Bronson<00:02:02.070> there<00:02:02.280> I<00:02:02.310> kind<00:02:02.549> of<00:02:02.700> feel<00:02:03.270> short

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
with Bronson there I kind of feel short

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.240 
with Bronson there I kind of feel short
around<00:02:03.899> him<00:02:04.079> but<00:02:04.290> so<00:02:04.469> it's<00:02:04.619> good<00:02:04.799> though<00:02:05.009> but

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
around him but so it's good though but

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:06.950 
around him but so it's good though but
we're<00:02:05.909> going<00:02:06.000> to<00:02:06.090> be<00:02:06.180> knocking<00:02:06.509> down<00:02:06.570> a<00:02:06.689> lot<00:02:06.869> of

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
we're going to be knocking down a lot of

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.020 
we're going to be knocking down a lot of
balls<00:02:06.990> it's<00:02:07.590> just<00:02:07.829> going<00:02:07.979> to<00:02:08.009> be<00:02:08.099> hard<00:02:08.940> to

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
balls it's just going to be hard to

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.850 
balls it's just going to be hard to
throw<00:02:09.239> around<00:02:09.420> us<00:02:09.780> so<00:02:09.810> I<00:02:10.020> think<00:02:10.229> it<00:02:10.289> will<00:02:10.440> be<00:02:10.619> a

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
throw around us so I think it will be a

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.770 
throw around us so I think it will be a
good<00:02:11.400> addition<00:02:11.550> to<00:02:11.879> the<00:02:12.030> defense

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
good addition to the defense

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.600 
good addition to the defense
first<00:02:13.380> couple<00:02:13.709> days<00:02:13.740> of<00:02:13.950> practice<00:02:14.130> what<00:02:14.520> do

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
first couple days of practice what do

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.840 
first couple days of practice what do
you<00:02:14.700> really<00:02:14.910> hope<00:02:15.180> to<00:02:15.209> accomplish<00:02:15.770> um<00:02:16.850> just

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
you really hope to accomplish um just

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.210 
you really hope to accomplish um just
starting<00:02:18.750> out<00:02:18.840> strong<00:02:19.230> i<00:02:19.440> guess<00:02:19.650> that<00:02:19.920> there's

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
starting out strong i guess that there's

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.010 
starting out strong i guess that there's
always<00:02:20.520> like<00:02:20.700> the<00:02:21.300> question<00:02:21.720> in<00:02:21.870> your<00:02:21.900> mind

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
always like the question in your mind

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.750 
always like the question in your mind
that<00:02:22.290> caused<00:02:22.560> it<00:02:22.830> good<00:02:23.250> even<00:02:23.610> though<00:02:23.670> i've

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
that caused it good even though i've

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.640 
that caused it good even though i've
done<00:02:24.000> it<00:02:24.120> so<00:02:24.270> many<00:02:24.300> times<00:02:24.480> I'm<00:02:24.930> still<00:02:25.260> kind<00:02:25.590> of

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
done it so many times I'm still kind of

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.470 
done it so many times I'm still kind of
unsure<00:02:25.860> how<00:02:26.370> things<00:02:26.850> are<00:02:27.030> going<00:02:27.150> to<00:02:27.209> flow

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
unsure how things are going to flow

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.570 
unsure how things are going to flow
because<00:02:27.720> each<00:02:27.900> year<00:02:28.290> we<00:02:29.100> kind<00:02:29.340> of<00:02:29.400> have<00:02:29.550> a

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
because each year we kind of have a

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.240 
because each year we kind of have a
different<00:02:30.330> philosophy<00:02:30.780> of<00:02:31.470> practice<00:02:31.860> I<00:02:32.040> guess

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
different philosophy of practice I guess

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.640 
different philosophy of practice I guess
so<00:02:32.520> just<00:02:33.330> kind<00:02:33.540> of<00:02:33.600> feeling<00:02:33.840> things<00:02:34.170> out<00:02:34.350> in

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
so just kind of feeling things out in

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.550 
so just kind of feeling things out in
getting<00:02:35.640> in<00:02:35.940> a<00:02:36.239> rhythm<00:02:36.450> I<00:02:36.690> guess<00:02:36.870> so<00:02:37.080> how<00:02:37.500> does

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
getting in a rhythm I guess so how does

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.870 
getting in a rhythm I guess so how does
this<00:02:37.650> year's<00:02:37.980> practice<00:02:38.400> philosophy

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:38.880 
this year's practice philosophy

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.930 
this year's practice philosophy
differently<00:02:39.330> on<00:02:39.959> this<00:02:40.560> year<00:02:40.770> I<00:02:40.800> think<00:02:41.130> where

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
differently on this year I think where

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:43.580 
differently on this year I think where
we<00:02:42.239> shorten<00:02:42.569> practice<00:02:42.989> a<00:02:43.110> little<00:02:43.230> more<00:02:43.410> I

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
we shorten practice a little more I

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:44.780 
we shorten practice a little more I
don't<00:02:43.709> remember<00:02:43.950> I<00:02:44.370> don't<00:02:44.580> know<00:02:44.640> if<00:02:44.730> you

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
don't remember I don't know if you

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.250 
don't remember I don't know if you
remember<00:02:44.940> last<00:02:45.330> year<00:02:45.600> our<00:02:45.660> first<00:02:45.930> practice<00:02:46.080> is

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
remember last year our first practice is

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.530 
remember last year our first practice is
like<00:02:46.410> three<00:02:46.680> hours<00:02:46.709> long<00:02:47.160> so<00:02:48.060> I<00:02:48.090> think<00:02:48.239> they

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
like three hours long so I think they

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.000 
like three hours long so I think they
were<00:02:48.600> trying<00:02:48.780> to<00:02:48.930> avoid<00:02:49.170> doing<00:02:49.440> that<00:02:49.680> again

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
were trying to avoid doing that again

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.900 
were trying to avoid doing that again
but<00:02:50.810> just<00:02:51.810> I<00:02:52.050> think<00:02:52.830> we<00:02:53.340> did<00:02:53.489> a<00:02:53.550> lot<00:02:53.730> more

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
but just I think we did a lot more

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.520 
but just I think we did a lot more
learning<00:02:54.180> today<00:02:54.480> especially<00:02:54.810> with<00:02:55.260> all<00:02:55.470> the

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
learning today especially with all the

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.170 
learning today especially with all the
new<00:02:55.800> guys<00:02:55.980> because<00:02:56.310> last<00:02:56.580> year<00:02:56.760> we<00:02:56.880> had<00:02:56.910> so

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
new guys because last year we had so

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.150 
new guys because last year we had so
many<00:02:57.330> returning<00:02:57.840> starters<00:02:58.380> and<00:02:58.680> everyone

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
many returning starters and everyone

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.860 
many returning starters and everyone
kinda<00:02:59.430> already<00:02:59.580> knew<00:02:59.700> the<00:03:00.000> defense<00:03:00.420> but<00:03:00.690> now

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
kinda already knew the defense but now

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.170 
kinda already knew the defense but now
we're<00:03:01.739> kind<00:03:01.950> of<00:03:02.010> slowing<00:03:02.489> things<00:03:02.610> down<00:03:02.760> and

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
we're kind of slowing things down and

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.809 
we're kind of slowing things down and
just<00:03:03.690> kind<00:03:03.989> of<00:03:04.080> doing<00:03:05.010> the<00:03:05.190> basics<00:03:05.580> of<00:03:05.730> our

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 
just kind of doing the basics of our

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:07.340 
just kind of doing the basics of our
defense<00:03:06.000> so<00:03:06.420> what's<00:03:06.660> the<00:03:06.780> most<00:03:06.930> difficult

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
defense so what's the most difficult

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.290 
defense so what's the most difficult
thing<00:03:07.380> about<00:03:07.530> transitioning<00:03:08.400> out<00:03:08.550> of<00:03:08.580> summer

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
thing about transitioning out of summer

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:11.059 
thing about transitioning out of summer

basket<00:07:09.060> I<00:07:09.210> think<00:07:09.810> Bronson<00:07:10.740> is<00:07:10.890> like<00:07:11.160> right<00:07:11.700> at

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:12.000 
basket I think Bronson is like right at

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.360 
basket I think Bronson is like right at
the<00:07:12.150> edge<00:07:12.300> any<00:07:13.020> taller<00:07:13.380> you'd<00:07:13.800> be<00:07:14.010> kind<00:07:14.190> of

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:14.370 
the edge any taller you'd be kind of

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:17.540 
the edge any taller you'd be kind of
like<00:07:14.550> huge<00:07:15.480> but<00:07:15.870> I<00:07:16.080> think<00:07:16.320> I<00:07:16.590> don't<00:07:17.400> know<00:07:17.490> I

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:17.550 
like huge but I think I don't know I

00:07:17.550 --> 00:07:19.040 
like huge but I think I don't know I
feel<00:07:17.790> like<00:07:17.940> a<00:07:18.000> lot<00:07:18.150> of<00:07:18.300> players<00:07:18.630> are<00:07:18.870> just

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:19.050 
feel like a lot of players are just

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:20.930 
feel like a lot of players are just
getting<00:07:19.230> taller<00:07:19.500> taller<00:07:20.010> and<00:07:20.340> bigger<00:07:20.550> and

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:20.940 
getting taller taller and bigger and

00:07:20.940 --> 00:07:23.150 
getting taller taller and bigger and
