a PC and as you can see here here is the
scratch<00:00:53.280> life<00:00:53.550> folder<00:00:54.320> now<00:00:55.320> if<00:00:55.410> we<00:00:55.530> go<00:00:55.680> into

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
scratch life folder now if we go into

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.770 
scratch life folder now if we go into
this<00:00:56.100> folder<00:00:56.309> you<00:00:56.910> should<00:00:57.120> see<00:00:57.300> something

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
this folder you should see something

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.709 
this folder you should see something
like<00:00:57.899> this<00:00:58.109> should<00:00:59.070> have<00:00:59.100> a<00:00:59.420> database<00:01:00.420> file

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
like this should have a database file

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.349 
like this should have a database file
create<00:01:01.440> folder<00:01:01.800> sub<00:01:02.070> create<00:01:02.309> folder<00:01:02.579> now<00:01:03.300> we

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
create folder sub create folder now we

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.240 
create folder sub create folder now we
need<00:01:03.600> to<00:01:03.690> drag<00:01:03.930> it<00:01:04.049> back<00:01:04.199> into<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.650> sub<00:01:04.979> crate

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
need to drag it back into the sub crate

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.070 
need to drag it back into the sub crate
folder<00:01:05.610> so<00:01:05.970> let's<00:01:06.000> double<00:01:06.330> click<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:06.810> go<00:01:06.930> into

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
folder so let's double click to go into

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.050 
folder so let's double click to go into
that<00:01:07.200> folder<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:07.770> then<00:01:08.460> you<00:01:08.490> just<00:01:08.760> simply

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
that folder and then you just simply

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.789 
that folder and then you just simply
need<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.270> drag<00:01:09.630> the<00:01:09.840> create<00:01:10.170> file<00:01:10.380> from<00:01:10.650> the

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
need to drag the create file from the

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.280 
need to drag the create file from the
trash<00:01:11.040> back<00:01:11.970> into<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.540> sub<00:01:12.720> crate<00:01:12.960> folder

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
trash back into the sub crate folder

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.249 
trash back into the sub crate folder
like<00:01:13.979> so<00:01:14.299> now<00:01:15.299> that<00:01:15.360> is<00:01:15.570> far<00:01:15.780> if<00:01:15.900> you<00:01:16.020> store

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
like so now that is far if you store

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.410 
like so now that is far if you store
your<00:01:16.439> music<00:01:16.530> on<00:01:16.830> the<00:01:16.950> internal<00:01:17.400> drive<00:01:17.520> if<00:01:18.330> you

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
your music on the internal drive if you

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.149 
your music on the internal drive if you
store<00:01:18.689> your<00:01:18.840> music<00:01:18.960> on<00:01:19.290> an<00:01:19.439> external<00:01:20.040> drive

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
store your music on an external drive

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.249 
store your music on an external drive
then<00:01:20.700> you<00:01:20.820> will<00:01:20.939> have<00:01:21.090> a<00:01:21.150> scratch<00:01:21.540> live<00:01:21.840> folder

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
then you will have a scratch live folder

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.460 
then you will have a scratch live folder
also<00:01:22.530> on<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.280> root<00:01:23.490> level<00:01:23.729> of<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.990> external

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
also on the root level of the external

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.679 
also on the root level of the external
drive<00:01:25.590> and<00:01:25.920> you<00:01:26.759> just<00:01:26.939> simply<00:01:27.240> do<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.479> same

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
drive and you just simply do the same

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.420 
drive and you just simply do the same
thing<00:01:27.930> you<00:01:28.049> drag<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.470> create<00:01:28.710> file<00:01:28.860> back<00:01:29.130> into

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
thing you drag the create file back into

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.370 
thing you drag the create file back into
the<00:01:29.549> sub<00:01:29.790> great<00:01:30.030> folder<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.630> in<00:01:31.020> the<00:01:31.110> scratch

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
the sub great folder and in the scratch

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.350 
the sub great folder and in the scratch
slide<00:01:31.619> folder<00:01:31.979> on<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.280> root<00:01:32.670> level<00:01:32.850> of<00:01:33.180> your

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
slide folder on the root level of your

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.840 
slide folder on the root level of your
external<00:01:33.869> drive<00:01:34.049> and<00:01:34.229> that<00:01:34.610> is<00:01:35.610> it<00:01:35.729> basically

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
external drive and that is it basically

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.990 
external drive and that is it basically
so<00:01:36.450> let's<00:01:36.810> close<00:01:36.960> thus<00:01:37.170> windows<00:01:37.500> now<00:01:37.710> and

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
so let's close thus windows now and

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.940 
so let's close thus windows now and
let's<00:01:39.000> open<00:01:39.240> scratch<00:01:39.689> lab<00:01:39.960> again<00:01:40.320> and<00:01:40.560> we

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
let's open scratch lab again and we

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.830 
let's open scratch lab again and we
should<00:01:41.189> see<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.700> create<00:01:41.970> file<00:01:42.180> is<00:01:42.479> packed<00:01:43.350> yay

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
should see the create file is packed yay

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.139 
should see the create file is packed yay
so<00:01:45.840> that<00:01:46.439> is<00:01:46.590> how<00:01:46.710> you<00:01:46.740> put<00:01:47.189> create<00:01:47.640> files<00:01:47.850> back

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
so that is how you put create files back

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.210 
so that is how you put create files back
into<00:01:48.540> scratch<00:01:49.049> life<00:01:49.320> if<00:01:49.530> you<00:01:49.649> accidentally

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
into scratch life if you accidentally

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.910 
into scratch life if you accidentally
bleed<00:01:50.430> oh<00:01:50.899> now<00:01:51.899> to<00:01:51.960> prevent<00:01:52.590> this<00:01:52.740> from

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
bleed oh now to prevent this from

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.100 
bleed oh now to prevent this from
happening<00:01:53.189> in<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.729> first<00:01:53.880> place<00:01:54.240> you<00:01:54.930> should

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
happening in the first place you should

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.499 
happening in the first place you should
go<00:01:55.229> into<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.500> setup<00:01:55.920> menu<00:01:56.040> go<00:01:56.729> to<00:01:56.759> the<00:01:57.030> library

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
go into the setup menu go to the library

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.539 
go into the setup menu go to the library
tab<00:01:57.780> and<00:01:58.110> you'll<00:01:58.649> see<00:01:58.740> this<00:01:59.040> protect<00:01:59.430> the
