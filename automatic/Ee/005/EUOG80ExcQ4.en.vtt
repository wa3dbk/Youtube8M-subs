00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 the first thing I wanted to make clear 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:06.839
 our review of the quota series has not yet seen 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.250
 of the first two episodes of what I 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.719
 I liked what I did not like what I 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.160
 I was telling you that then. 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.160
 speak quota 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:20.340
 rafa tells a series that proposes to 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.590
 tell the source of the mann package 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.439
 written batman but with the city of 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.820
 gotham worked before there was batman and 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.250
 one thing that I like right away 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.230
 in this series is that it focuses on the 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.360
 fattening I enjoyed the actor does 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.160
 although the second character of the relationship 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.630
 his anger is good until his partner 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.860
 tell the police that he is on his way 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.210
 just got back basically 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.469
 he endorses this and now he is 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.930
 starting to know the stops at 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.329
 rot happens in note and I like it 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.160
 his relationship with anger and how-to ball 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.289
 He is the good guy, nice guy, who 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.000
 do the right thing always the executive 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.469
 for corrupt talking, my friend is not like this 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.559
 things work to make our 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.180
 way and way tomorrow is and crochet is kind 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.090
 sad relationship but I liked to see 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.739
 Even so, the first thing that 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.989
 called attention was also soon embraced the 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.700
 flec the back of the police station 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.770
 guys get stuck inside 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.510
 Sergio Tribe only has one explanation for 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.280
 This is going to make you cancer because 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.799
 but has no explanation front 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.509
 some thug caught by the cops 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.290
 without seeming beautiful the silence of 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.630
 innocent 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:24.840
 She has been there since October, aborting the 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:26.880
 stay at your friend will continue giving shooting 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.850
 in the head in two minutes 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.680
 a gentleman here do not they want this 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.110
 be a police series but it showed 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.090
 the police drama on the part of the 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.159
 you do not have a little mafia you're right 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.200
 the mafia with the falcone and one more 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.170
 There is a gallery there and I found it 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:49.229
 has a good idea but we have some 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:51.149
 there legal problems not with this action of 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.990
 marketing or other end up shovel which is the 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.579
 Penguin 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.689
 I enjoyed the actor do I liked 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.790
 a lot of how they are developing 

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:58.920
 characters as you would like to 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.659
 transformation of how he suffers 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.329
 bullying among which the inclusion of 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.040
 punishments to know the truth all good is 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:07.320
 My joke, I 'm happy to see you. 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.640
 as being represented as the 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.649
 evolution of him as a character 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.510
 happening and 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.760
 liking to see the hulk came back taking 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:15.170
 a series with him and there begins a new 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.060
 My problem with this series 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.200
 the characters are very cartoonish in the 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.000
 second episode, mainly the 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.829
 villains of the second episode are 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.079
 completely less than this type have less 

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:26.689
 fierce but they managed to get out will stay 

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:28.670
 here it is because this is who produces has 

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:30.200
 idea that in the 90's I saw a lot of 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:31.700
 animated series of the neighborhood when he was 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.519
 growing but if you like super 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.829
 heroes and the animated batman series 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:38.930
 the characters were less cartoonish than the 

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:42.650
 which were these episodes of likes until 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.909
 now this is a shame for who 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.489
 command because the character zé texeira 

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:49.129
 pinkett fear she informs bears well 

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:51.590
 forum to the top tire falcone but she is 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:53.510
 arriving there it's near the stop she does 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.069
 A lot of shit for those on top of the 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.489
 mafia in the first episode since it is 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:03:00.590
 kill the cord and complete it that kills 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:02.870
 two policemen you have to stop and 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.909
 to think a little, daughter, if you are 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.829
 Loved two policemen will surely go 

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:09.290
 bring a lot of bad for you than 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:11.120
 good thing and even the two because 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.950
 She offends money with the business they 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:16.370
 I said the mother of this attitude but I 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:18.500
 I'm fucking cagr another part that I 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.849
 they bothered because they deforested use in logo 

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.590
 in the first episode I wanted 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:24.530
 had developed by falcone speaks 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.909

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.040

 dominated the city with the relationship I 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:34.760
 I have with the falcone and shows these 

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:36.079
 things 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.790
 it is an opportunity that the instinct for 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:39.799
 first time to show something about 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.090

 fears this flame here that is what 

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:27.169
 type of molecule a business of this 

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:29.389
 It bothers me a little to know you already have a 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:30.590
 very adult attitude and a child to 

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:32.330
 warm up with this train to be 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:34.099
 part now when the child this goes 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:36.199
 so you can keep your 20's and 

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:39.229
 few years lacked a bit of themselves a 

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:40.669
 feeling that there is an empty space if you 

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:42.289
 had his parents live in his power 

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:43.909
 show his relationship with parents grow 

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:46.430
 this relationship showed above the 

00:05:43.909 --> 00:05:48.380
 with the rest of the characters and is 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:50.029
 at the end of the first season 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:52.159
 You go there and brand your parents and take this 

00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:54.650
 it is our suffering from him that since a 

00:05:52.159 --> 00:05:56.270
 lace with thick n barrio santo inacio in 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:58.550
 a child his tie because he is a 

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:00.020
 paper process hits a day , but it was 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:02.870
 any character any other series 

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:04.250
 and 13 would only care about it that is 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:05.750
 a problem and I hope I have made a 

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:06.979
 deeper stop 

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:09.169
 Do you know how to park more with the 

00:06:06.979 --> 00:06:11.900
 character and not to play just to die 

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:14.599
 now it's there we'll have something and off 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:17.120
 that they hear will not put put 

00:06:14.599 --> 00:06:19.039
 the psychologist because his father did not 

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.659
 I wanted to make more goals, let me choose 

00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:22.340
 the very good way we have 

00:06:20.659 --> 00:06:26.630
 references our pop culture that 

00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:31.060
 This is not going to work. 

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:31.060
 I sent a psychologist 

00:06:31.129 --> 00:06:35.360
 three defeats are good, I know I liked it 

00:06:33.919 --> 00:06:36.649
 main character of the series that is the 

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:38.270
 Commissioner Gordon who is not starting 

00:06:36.649 --> 00:06:40.099
 still at that time it ended up more 

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:41.899
 than although I liked the actor 

00:06:40.099 --> 00:06:44.089
 the cd how are you doing it i liked it 

00:06:41.899 --> 00:06:45.889
 how is the evolution penguin doing 

00:06:44.089 --> 00:06:47.659
 that he's having the series so far but 

00:06:45.889 --> 00:06:49.099
 the damage is many plays in the face 

00:06:47.659 --> 00:06:50.149
 I see they are trying to fix a 

00:06:49.099 --> 00:06:52.069
 thing or other 

00:06:50.149 --> 00:06:53.839
 the characters were very cartoonish 

00:06:52.069 --> 00:06:55.580
 in the second episode, especially if the 

00:06:53.839 --> 00:06:57.019
 have brought a little more of the reality I 

00:06:55.580 --> 00:06:58.669
 I was going to be a little more satisfied and 

00:06:57.019 --> 00:07:00.199
 besides I always wanted to lose 

00:06:58.669 --> 00:07:02.239
 opportunity to see something with the 

00:07:00.199 --> 00:07:04.550
 parents of the mp there is a very intimate relation of 

00:07:02.239 --> 00:07:07.009
 You care about them in those dying. 

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:08.689
 in show that they were doing in Boston but 

00:07:07.009 --> 00:07:10.610
 the series has potential 

00:07:08.689 --> 00:07:12.499
 it's worth listening to people you've been down 

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:14.149
 but ahead I can get serious 

00:07:12.499 --> 00:07:15.619
 even if talking about how it is being 

00:07:14.149 --> 00:07:16.249
 so just knew then let's wait
