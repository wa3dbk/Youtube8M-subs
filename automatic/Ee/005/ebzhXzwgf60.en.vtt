all this takes quite a bit of effort to
put<00:01:01.650> over<00:01:01.860> rather<00:01:02.370> complicated<00:01:02.850> piece<00:01:03.330> of

here<00:01:06.390> on<00:01:06.570> deck<00:01:07.130> to<00:01:08.130> attach<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.940> gear<00:01:09.180> and

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
here on deck to attach the gear and

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.080 
here on deck to attach the gear and
deploy<00:01:09.750> it<00:01:09.800> another<00:01:10.800> person<00:01:11.550> up<00:01:11.700> here<00:01:11.729> on<00:01:12.000> the

deploy it another person up here on the
next<00:01:12.360> deck<00:01:12.570> to<00:01:12.780> handle<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.200> winches<00:01:13.650> and

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
next deck to handle the winches and

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.760 
next deck to handle the winches and
finally<00:01:14.729> an<00:01:15.090> officer<00:01:15.600> up<00:01:15.840> on<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.229> bridge<00:01:16.440> deck

finally an officer up on the bridge deck

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.320 
finally an officer up on the bridge deck
to<00:01:17.010> make<00:01:17.190> sure<00:01:17.430> that<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.790> net<00:01:17.970> streams

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
to make sure that the net streams

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.090 
to make sure that the net streams
cleanly<00:01:18.870> behind<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.380> ship<00:01:19.440> and<00:01:20.070> that

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
cleanly behind the ship and that

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.820 
cleanly behind the ship and that
everything<00:01:20.460> goes<00:01:20.760> okay<00:01:21.270> once<00:01:22.170> we<00:01:22.320> get<00:01:22.440> all<00:01:22.620> the

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
everything goes okay once we get all the

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.640 
everything goes okay once we get all the
gear<00:01:23.040> out<00:01:23.310> we<00:01:24.270> let<00:01:24.450> it<00:01:24.540> sit<00:01:24.810> for<00:01:24.840> about<00:01:25.170> 30
