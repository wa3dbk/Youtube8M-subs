00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.049
 now the distinguished what to teach how 

00:00:02.209 --> 00:00:05.049
 make this lip balm 

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:14.890
 what we are going to need is labial 

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:16.330
 a container looks like we're going to put 

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:19.180
 our balm 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:22.820
 the teaspoons must pass a teaspoon 

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:26.680
 I like this for the 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.680
 for this to regulate 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:35.780
 The first thing we are going to do is grab 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.780
 and get on 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:44.270
 now what we are going to do 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.950
 that weird 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:50.490
 this part of the spoon 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:55.110
 let's leave this nothing we're going to grab 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:57.890
 the part of this and we're going to take everything 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.890
 falsely 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.860
 perhaps 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.960
 but we 're going to put a teaspoon here 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.939
 let's put it half 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.720
 prepared 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:24.720
 in the open container 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.289
 and what do we need fast for? 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.289
 grab this 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.050
 how to mix time 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:58.479
 now we grab the container 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.479
 and we put it 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.960
 and good 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.690

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.690
 ah 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.459
 do not 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:37.620

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.070
