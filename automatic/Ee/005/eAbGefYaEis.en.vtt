with the blue blue patient version this

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.699 
with the blue blue patient version this
one<00:03:05.000> that's<00:03:05.239> alright<00:03:05.450> 220

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
one that's alright 220

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:09.009 
one that's alright 220
but<00:03:07.250> it<00:03:07.370> felt<00:03:07.580> faster<00:03:08.060> probably<00:03:08.420> just<00:03:08.630> because

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
but it felt faster probably just because

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:10.870

00:06:35.589 --> 00:06:35.599 
competition mode you go through a Wandy

00:06:35.599 --> 00:06:37.600 
competition mode you go through a Wandy
bitter<00:06:35.749> road<00:06:35.960> like<00:06:36.199> this<00:06:36.379> and<00:06:36.650> it's<00:06:37.219> just<00:06:37.279> so

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:37.610 
bitter road like this and it's just so

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:39.939 
bitter road like this and it's just so
well<00:06:37.819> poised<00:06:38.150> you<00:06:38.509> know<00:06:38.629> that<00:06:38.900> I<00:06:39.110> think<00:06:39.560> you're

00:06:39.939 --> 00:06:39.949 
well poised you know that I think you're

00:06:39.949 --> 00:06:41.529 
well poised you know that I think you're
talking<00:06:40.219> about<00:06:40.370> the<00:06:40.490> design<00:06:40.819> poise<00:06:41.300> and

00:06:41.529 --> 00:06:41.539 
talking about the design poise and

00:06:41.539 --> 00:06:43.149 
talking about the design poise and
aggression<00:06:41.810> of<00:06:42.050> the<00:06:42.110> car<00:06:42.289> comes<00:06:42.650> across<00:06:42.860> when

00:06:43.149 --> 00:06:43.159 
aggression of the car comes across when

00:06:43.159 --> 00:06:44.469 
aggression of the car comes across when
you're<00:06:43.249> driving<00:06:43.460> it<00:06:43.729> the<00:06:43.999> fact<00:06:44.240> that<00:06:44.330> the

00:06:44.469 --> 00:06:44.479 
you're driving it the fact that the

00:06:44.479 --> 00:06:46.240 
you're driving it the fact that the
wheel<00:06:44.629> is<00:06:44.659> lighter<00:06:45.110> definitely<00:06:45.919> gives<00:06:46.099> you<00:06:46.189> a

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:46.250 
wheel is lighter definitely gives you a

00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:48.159 
wheel is lighter definitely gives you a
better<00:06:46.430> balance<00:06:46.849> the<00:06:47.029> cars<00:06:47.240> more<00:06:47.509> responsive

00:06:48.159 --> 00:06:48.169 
better balance the cars more responsive

00:06:48.169 --> 00:06:50.709 
better balance the cars more responsive
in<00:06:48.379> the<00:06:48.590> front<00:06:48.800> end<00:06:48.979> so<00:06:49.129> yeah<00:06:49.879> it<00:06:50.090> has<00:06:50.300> three

00:06:50.709 --> 00:06:50.719 
in the front end so yeah it has three

00:06:50.719 --> 00:06:52.899 
in the front end so yeah it has three
times<00:06:50.990> more<00:06:51.259> power<00:06:51.800> than<00:06:52.099> some<00:06:52.400> of<00:06:52.490> the<00:06:52.580> very

00:06:52.899 --> 00:06:52.909 
times more power than some of the very

00:06:52.909 --> 00:06:55.390 
times more power than some of the very
early<00:06:53.270> versions<00:06:53.750> but<00:06:54.139> the<00:06:54.560> word<00:06:54.740> refinement<00:06:55.370> I

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:55.400 
early versions but the word refinement I

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.159 
early versions but the word refinement I
keep<00:06:55.580> coming<00:06:55.789> back<00:06:55.939> to<00:06:56.090> you<00:06:56.330> because<00:06:56.479> it's<00:06:56.960> a

00:06:57.159 --> 00:06:57.169 
keep coming back to you because it's a

00:06:57.169 --> 00:06:59.439 
keep coming back to you because it's a
it's<00:06:57.409> easy<00:06:57.710> to<00:06:57.979> drive<00:06:58.219> and<00:06:58.550> it's<00:06:59.000> safe<00:06:59.240> to

00:06:59.439 --> 00:06:59.449 
it's easy to drive and it's safe to

00:06:59.449 --> 00:07:01.179 
it's easy to drive and it's safe to
drive<00:06:59.659> but<00:07:00.349> it<00:07:00.529> still<00:07:00.770> gives<00:07:00.919> you<00:07:01.039> that

the III was launched at Winterland Garth
you<00:07:13.400> tried<00:07:14.300> out<00:07:14.509> the<00:07:14.719> competition<00:07:15.020> mode<00:07:15.439> or

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:15.650 
you tried out the competition mode or

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:17.290 
you tried out the competition mode or
everything<00:07:16.219> switched<00:07:16.580> off<00:07:16.819> and<00:07:16.999> you<00:07:17.060> actually

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:17.300 
everything switched off and you actually

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:18.760 
everything switched off and you actually
found<00:07:17.509> it<00:07:17.689> quicker<00:07:17.870> with<00:07:18.050> competition<00:07:18.589> mode

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:18.770

yeah<00:07:19.159> in<00:07:19.339> full<00:07:19.550> competition<00:07:19.939> notes<00:07:20.360> I<00:07:20.509> thought

00:07:20.649 --> 00:07:20.659 
yeah in full competition notes I thought

00:07:20.659 --> 00:07:22.059 
yeah in full competition notes I thought
that<00:07:20.779> the<00:07:20.839> track<00:07:21.110> setting<00:07:21.469> the<00:07:21.680> car<00:07:21.889> was

00:07:22.059 --> 00:07:22.069 
that the track setting the car was

00:07:22.069 --> 00:07:23.230 
that the track setting the car was
faster<00:07:22.550> than<00:07:22.669> when<00:07:22.789> we<00:07:22.879> turned<00:07:23.060> everything

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:23.240 
faster than when we turned everything

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:24.909 
faster than when we turned everything
off<00:07:23.599> and<00:07:23.659> took<00:07:24.080> all<00:07:24.199> the<00:07:24.229> aids<00:07:24.439> out<00:07:24.740> of<00:07:24.860> the

00:07:24.909 --> 00:07:24.919
