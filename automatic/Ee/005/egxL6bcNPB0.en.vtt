00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.700
 so we'll be right now 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.470
 what were the main changes 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:09.489
 if you also want to happen, you said 

00:00:09.489 --> 00:00:10.389
 in rule 

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:14.080
 We're going to take a look now, this has to show us, forget the country. 

00:00:14.079 --> 00:00:17.079
 changes we'll see 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:25.890
 but did not enter 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.620
 to born formerly it had a total of 20 points and now we have a total 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:31.019
 of 30 points 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:35.359
 in the final note of the conference presided over by d three minutes after the withdrawal 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.930
 difficulty was called participate 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:41.930
 I split the license plate 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:47.100
 we have 10 constant drop of 10 points indicated plot conspiracy in the 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.100
 total of 30 points of the final grade since 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.350
 some difficulties were introduced in the collective training 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.050
 mainly in the petrochemical areas 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.850
 now the worst these elements is considered an element of difficulty 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.650
 and purely 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.760
 now it is necessary to hold elections before the movement has to try 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:14.910
 This is a new element too. 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.870
 on previous page gym could jog 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:27.280
 any part of the body before starting appliance for a few moments and now 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.370
 there was no courage she needs 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.370
 move the device early in the session 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.480
 another change in the subject was a risk 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.240
 the risk of increase existed only that it was not called a hysteria and 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.760
 did not have this value that he has today that is very important to be able to 

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.290
 other terminals should increase in programming the concept of logistics 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.910
 of the law but the law 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:53.100
 including voting machines 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.240
 is considerably 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.510
 The more you do, the more you do. 

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.759
 the main objective of these changes in power 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.870
 is to make this modality more interesting because the 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.680
 a speech in the most spectacular modality more artistic more peace 

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:17.719
 two items that will be unraveled 

00:02:17.719 --> 00:02:19.309
 I'm living our lives now.
