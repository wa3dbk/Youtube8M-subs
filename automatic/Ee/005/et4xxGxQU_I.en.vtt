Sol's<00:01:53.509> it'll<00:01:54.509> show<00:01:54.719> my<00:01:54.990> current<00:01:55.380> average<00:01:55.439> of

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
Sol's it'll show my current average of

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.649 
Sol's it'll show my current average of
100<00:01:56.039> so<00:01:56.250> just<00:01:56.490> like<00:01:56.609> a<00:01:56.640> little<00:01:56.880> summary<00:01:57.090> of<00:01:57.450> the

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
100 so just like a little summary of the

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.440 
100 so just like a little summary of the
session<00:01:58.380> that<00:01:58.500> you're<00:01:58.619> in<00:01:58.819> if<00:01:59.819> i<00:01:59.939> wanted<00:02:00.240> to<00:02:00.299> i

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
session that you're in if i wanted to i

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.169 
session that you're in if i wanted to i
can<00:02:00.840> add<00:02:00.989> penalties<00:02:01.500> to<00:02:01.890> solve<00:02:02.549> the<00:02:03.000> last

00:02:03.169 --> 00:02:03.179 
can add penalties to solve the last

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:05.479 
can add penalties to solve the last
solve<00:02:03.420> so<00:02:03.840> if<00:02:04.200> i<00:02:04.380> put<00:02:04.409> the<00:02:04.770> cube<00:02:04.950> down<00:02:05.099> and<00:02:05.369> it

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:05.489 
solve so if i put the cube down and it

00:02:05.489 --> 00:02:08.660 
solve so if i put the cube down and it
was<00:02:05.579> a<00:02:05.640> plus<00:02:05.819> 2<00:02:05.939> i<00:02:05.970> can<00:02:06.239> change<00:02:06.390> that<00:02:06.829> or<00:02:07.829> a<00:02:08.340> dnf

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
was a plus 2 i can change that or a dnf

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.020 
was a plus 2 i can change that or a dnf
for<00:02:08.880> anything<00:02:09.200> so<00:02:10.200> now<00:02:10.709> that<00:02:10.920> i<00:02:10.950> have<00:02:11.190> 12

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
for anything so now that i have 12

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.880 
for anything so now that i have 12
solves<00:02:12.390> a<00:02:12.450> lot<00:02:12.480> of<00:02:12.630> a<00:02:12.750> look<00:02:12.900> at<00:02:13.140> the<00:02:13.410> stats<00:02:13.769> for

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
solves a lot of a look at the stats for

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.080 
solves a lot of a look at the stats for
that<00:02:14.160> session<00:02:14.430> so<00:02:15.390> you<00:02:15.480> can<00:02:15.599> see<00:02:15.840> here<00:02:16.530> we<00:02:16.709> have

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
that session so you can see here we have

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.759 
that session so you can see here we have
such<00:02:18.090> an<00:02:18.239> average<00:02:18.540> and<00:02:18.780> the<00:02:19.110> times<00:02:19.319> and<00:02:19.650> i<00:02:19.680> can

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 
such an average and the times and i can

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:21.199 
such an average and the times and i can
also<00:02:19.920> look<00:02:20.069> at<00:02:20.220> the<00:02:20.310> scrambles<00:02:20.760> if<00:02:20.879> I<00:02:20.970> wanted

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
also look at the scrambles if I wanted

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.960 
also look at the scrambles if I wanted
to<00:02:21.410> so<00:02:22.410> here's<00:02:22.590> the<00:02:22.709> scrambles<00:02:23.129> for<00:02:23.190> each<00:02:23.400> soul

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
to so here's the scrambles for each soul

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:25.850 
to so here's the scrambles for each soul
I<00:02:24.329> don't<00:02:25.110> want<00:02:25.230> to<00:02:25.290> look<00:02:25.349> at<00:02:25.470> more<00:02:25.560> something

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
I don't want to look at more something

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.380 
I don't want to look at more something
more<00:02:26.069> specific<00:02:26.250> I<00:02:26.819> can<00:02:26.849> look<00:02:27.299> at<00:02:27.599> a<00:02:29.209> here's<00:02:30.209> my

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
more specific I can look at a here's my

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:32.240 
more specific I can look at a here's my
best<00:02:30.599> average<00:02:30.810> of<00:02:30.989> five<00:02:31.140> so<00:02:31.500> you<00:02:31.980> can<00:02:32.129> see

best average of five so you can see

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.090 
best average of five so you can see
times<00:02:32.910> and<00:02:33.420> these<00:02:34.319> scrambles<00:02:34.709> for<00:02:34.769> that

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
times and these scrambles for that

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.300

there's<00:03:41.830> no<00:03:41.920> cat<00:03:42.160> so<00:03:42.489> it's<00:03:42.610> going<00:03:42.730> to<00:03:42.790> be<00:03:42.849> an

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
there's no cat so it's going to be an

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:44.520 
there's no cat so it's going to be an
error<00:03:43.180> because<00:03:43.360> I<00:03:43.540> didn't<00:03:43.780> have<00:03:43.900> a<00:03:43.930> tag<00:03:44.170> so<00:03:44.470> it

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
error because I didn't have a tag so it

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.949 
error because I didn't have a tag so it
won't<00:03:44.680> say<00:03:44.920> but<00:03:45.880> really<00:03:46.480> that's<00:03:46.599> all<00:03:46.810> there<00:03:46.930> is

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
won't say but really that's all there is

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:50.130 
won't say but really that's all there is
to<00:03:47.080> it<00:03:47.230> so<00:03:47.560> if<00:03:48.310> I<00:03:48.489> keep<00:03:48.700> going<00:03:48.870> all<00:03:49.870> the<00:03:49.959> way<00:03:50.020> up

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140 
to it so if I keep going all the way up

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.199 
to it so if I keep going all the way up
to<00:03:50.170> 100<00:03:50.620> it<00:03:50.770> will<00:03:50.890> show<00:03:51.310> my<00:03:51.459> average<00:03:51.610> of<00:03:51.819> 100

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209 
to 100 it will show my average of 100

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:55.020 
to 100 it will show my average of 100
but<00:03:52.750> really<00:03:53.020> it's<00:03:53.170> just<00:03:53.349> a<00:03:53.530> simple<00:03:54.040> app<00:03:54.370> to

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
but really it's just a simple app to

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:56.970 
but really it's just a simple app to
take<00:03:55.780> care<00:03:55.959> of<00:03:56.020> whatever<00:03:56.590> you<00:03:56.830> need

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 
take care of whatever you need

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:00.509 
take care of whatever you need
timing-wise<00:03:58.650> if<00:03:59.650> there's<00:03:59.890> any<00:03:59.980> features<00:04:00.370> that

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
timing-wise if there's any features that

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:03.600 
timing-wise if there's any features that
you<00:04:00.640> guys<00:04:01.200> feel<00:04:02.200> that<00:04:02.530> isn't<00:04:03.190> missing<00:04:03.430> from

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.610 
you guys feel that isn't missing from

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:05.580 
you guys feel that isn't missing from
the<00:04:03.730> app<00:04:03.819> that<00:04:04.090> I<00:04:04.120> didn't<00:04:04.420> think<00:04:04.450> of<00:04:04.750> just<00:04:05.230> sent

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:05.590 
the app that I didn't think of just sent

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:07.020 
the app that I didn't think of just sent
me<00:04:05.650> a<00:04:05.680> message<00:04:05.980> on<00:04:06.099> youtube<00:04:06.400> or<00:04:06.610> email<00:04:06.640> me<00:04:06.910> at

what<00:04:11.080> to<00:04:11.140> add<00:04:11.349> to<00:04:11.650> it<00:04:11.819> and<00:04:12.819> I<00:04:12.940> can<00:04:13.120> probably<00:04:13.300> add

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:13.540 
what to add to it and I can probably add

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:15.809 
what to add to it and I can probably add
them<00:04:13.750> if<00:04:14.380> I<00:04:14.799> think<00:04:14.980> they're<00:04:15.310> they're<00:04:15.670> worth

00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:15.819 
them if I think they're they're worth

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:20.330 
them if I think they're they're worth
adding<00:04:16.030> I<00:04:16.919> really<00:04:17.919> made<00:04:18.070> this<00:04:18.250> for<00:04:18.549> myself<00:04:18.970> to

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
adding I really made this for myself to

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.810 
adding I really made this for myself to
have<00:04:21.340> a<00:04:22.229> timer<00:04:23.229> with<00:04:23.740> me<00:04:23.919> when<00:04:24.100> I<00:04:24.130> got<00:04:24.310> my<00:04:24.460> iPad

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
have a timer with me when I got my iPad

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.750 
have a timer with me when I got my iPad
and<00:04:25.030> i<00:04:25.840> was<00:04:25.990> just<00:04:26.229> i<00:04:26.500> i<00:04:26.919> really<00:04:26.979> wanted<00:04:27.400> it<00:04:27.550> for

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
and i was just i i really wanted it for

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.390 
and i was just i i really wanted it for
function<00:04:28.150> the<00:04:29.110> other<00:04:29.229> timers<00:04:29.620> in<00:04:29.650> the<00:04:29.860> apps<00:04:30.160> or

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:30.400 
function the other timers in the apps or

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.360 
function the other timers in the apps or
aren't<00:04:30.880> really<00:04:31.180> as<00:04:32.169> functional<00:04:32.710> as<00:04:32.740> this<00:04:32.979> for

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
aren't really as functional as this for

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.710 
aren't really as functional as this for
cuban<00:04:34.139> so<00:04:35.139> i<00:04:35.169> figured<00:04:35.620> i<00:04:35.740> make<00:04:35.919> something<00:04:36.340> with

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:36.720 
cuban so i figured i make something with

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.780 
cuban so i figured i make something with
the<00:04:37.720> this<00:04:38.200> all<00:04:38.620> the<00:04:38.830> functionality<00:04:39.669> that

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:39.790 
the this all the functionality that

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:42.719 
the this all the functionality that
you're<00:04:40.270> looking<00:04:40.360> for<00:04:40.510> from<00:04:41.040> the<00:04:42.040> computer

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:42.729 
you're looking for from the computer

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:45.000 
you're looking for from the computer
based<00:04:42.880> timers<00:04:43.320> so<00:04:44.320> really<00:04:44.470> if<00:04:44.650> you<00:04:44.740> think<00:04:44.770> of

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010 
based timers so really if you think of

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.730 
based timers so really if you think of
an<00:04:45.100> idea<00:04:45.220> i'm<00:04:45.729> missing<00:04:46.090> it<00:04:46.750> would<00:04:46.870> be<00:04:46.930> a<00:04:47.169> good

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
real health formation and I guess that's

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.890 
real health formation and I guess that's
it<00:04:59.650> it's<00:04:59.860> available<00:05:00.370> in<00:05:00.610> the<00:05:00.700> App<00:05:00.789> Store<00:05:00.900> under
