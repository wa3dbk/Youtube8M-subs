have to use different weapons in

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:06.030 
have to use different weapons in
different<00:05:04.030> situations<00:05:04.780> we<00:05:05.350> do<00:05:05.440> not<00:05:05.590> have<00:05:05.800> to

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:06.040 
different situations we do not have to

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.890 
different situations we do not have to
but<00:05:06.520> some<00:05:06.820> weapons<00:05:07.180> will<00:05:07.300> be<00:05:07.330> better<00:05:07.600> in

00:05:07.890 --> 00:05:07.900 
but some weapons will be better in

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:10.050 
but some weapons will be better in
certain<00:05:08.350> situations<00:05:08.500> yeah<00:05:09.040> we<00:05:09.190> try<00:05:09.340> to<00:05:09.400> make

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.060 
certain situations yeah we try to make

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.810 
certain situations yeah we try to make
sure<00:05:10.240> each<00:05:10.480> weapon<00:05:10.840> has<00:05:11.440> a<00:05:11.640> function<00:05:12.640> in<00:05:12.730> the

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:12.820 
sure each weapon has a function in the

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:15.360 
sure each weapon has a function in the
game<00:05:12.970> so<00:05:13.270> you<00:05:13.690> know<00:05:13.810> the<00:05:14.350> earlier<00:05:15.040> weapons

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:15.370 
game so you know the earlier weapons

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:17.220 
game so you know the earlier weapons
aren't<00:05:15.520> discarded<00:05:16.060> later<00:05:16.420> on<00:05:16.660> you<00:05:16.870> just<00:05:17.050> need

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:17.230 
aren't discarded later on you just need

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:18.870 
aren't discarded later on you just need
to<00:05:17.350> use<00:05:17.440> them<00:05:17.590> in<00:05:17.710> different<00:05:17.740> situations<00:05:18.100> okay

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:18.880 
to use them in different situations okay

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:21.690 
to use them in different situations okay
I<00:05:18.910> see<00:05:19.180> so<00:05:19.870> I<00:05:20.260> played<00:05:20.770> a<00:05:20.800> little<00:05:20.950> bit<00:05:21.190> about<00:05:21.370> a

guns the laser the laser gun that I was
using<00:05:25.870> that<00:05:26.020> would<00:05:26.260> actually<00:05:26.470> had<00:05:26.800> an

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:26.890 
using that would actually had an

00:05:26.890 --> 00:05:28.350 
using that would actually had an
application<00:05:27.400> some<00:05:27.640> of<00:05:27.700> the<00:05:27.760> puzzles<00:05:28.000> in<00:05:28.330> the

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:28.360 
application some of the puzzles in the

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.720 
application some of the puzzles in the
game<00:05:28.600> how<00:05:29.590> much<00:05:29.860> are<00:05:30.010> you<00:05:30.100> guys<00:05:30.190> integrating

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:30.730 
game how much are you guys integrating

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:32.400 
game how much are you guys integrating
puzzle-solving<00:05:31.150> into<00:05:31.750> this<00:05:31.840> game<00:05:32.110> so<00:05:32.290> that

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:32.410 
puzzle-solving into this game so that

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:33.900 
puzzle-solving into this game so that
it's<00:05:32.530> not<00:05:32.680> just<00:05:32.920> a<00:05:32.980> straight-up<00:05:33.310> shoot

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:33.910 
it's not just a straight-up shoot

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:35.940 
it's not just a straight-up shoot
everything<00:05:34.240> fest<00:05:34.690> so<00:05:35.140> we<00:05:35.260> think<00:05:35.410> that's<00:05:35.680> part

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:35.950 
everything fest so we think that's part

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:39.030 
everything fest so we think that's part
of<00:05:36.100> the<00:05:36.280> adventure<00:05:36.550> part<00:05:37.240> of<00:05:37.330> the<00:05:37.420> game<00:05:37.590> so<00:05:38.590> we

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:39.040 
of the adventure part of the game so we

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:40.770 
of the adventure part of the game so we
have<00:05:39.310> some<00:05:39.700> laser<00:05:39.970> weapons<00:05:40.390> that<00:05:40.510> we<00:05:40.630> can<00:05:40.750> use

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:40.780 
have some laser weapons that we can use

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:42.780 
have some laser weapons that we can use
to<00:05:40.900> cut<00:05:41.230> through<00:05:41.410> certain<00:05:42.130> types<00:05:42.340> of<00:05:42.460> metal

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:42.790 
to cut through certain types of metal

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:44.550 
to cut through certain types of metal
surfaces<00:05:43.270> and<00:05:43.540> that<00:05:43.900> can<00:05:44.080> be<00:05:44.200> used<00:05:44.380> to

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:44.560 
surfaces and that can be used to

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.500 
surfaces and that can be used to
progress<00:05:45.040> through<00:05:45.100> a<00:05:45.280> level<00:05:45.670> to<00:05:46.090> solve<00:05:46.330> some

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:46.510 
progress through a level to solve some

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:48.930 
progress through a level to solve some
puzzles<00:05:46.710> to<00:05:47.710> find<00:05:47.980> new<00:05:48.130> ways<00:05:48.340> through<00:05:48.610> level

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:48.940 
puzzles to find new ways through level

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:50.970 
puzzles to find new ways through level
but<00:05:49.270> you<00:05:49.330> can<00:05:49.480> also<00:05:49.630> use<00:05:49.900> it<00:05:49.930> in<00:05:50.140> combat<00:05:50.620> so

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:50.980 
but you can also use it in combat so

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:54.600 
but you can also use it in combat so
imagine<00:05:51.690> doing<00:05:52.690> a<00:05:52.980> stealth<00:05:53.980> sequence<00:05:54.460> your
