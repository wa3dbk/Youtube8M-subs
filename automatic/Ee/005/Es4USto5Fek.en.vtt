00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:15.660
 my channel and in this video we go here with 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:17.279
 gold simulator in death slayer and moves 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.369
 very cool here as it stands for the 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.060
 blue and probably has a slider for 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.789
 there 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.010
 here in the last very cool reader I 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.420
 I love mode of the things that the 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.090
 people do some super things 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.380
 sensational type here is that the 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.360
 people make people play with the kid 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.969
 normal I put another mold that is 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.200
 first - person where you press the pp 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:40.410
 ready exactly what's happening 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.800
 I am goats or goat that is 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:46.410
 we're getting into the head of a camera 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.989
 it's really in his head and more 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:52.469
 unfortunately when a looping 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.510
 Lupi does not follow the type, I'm not without 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.390
 understand the eye in the eye really to 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.879
 Where you end up looking, I'm just with the 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.399
 camera in the head this is in terms 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.000
 laundering the main objective 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.290
 is to collect holy book also this here 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.560
 it's here 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:13.560
 Then I picked up some things. 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.740
 public balls out smoking farting 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.049
 Where that there was to be a polka 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.140
 There's another one there for the way it has. 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:24.570
 who find 8 for you to complete but has 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.790
 sneijder that may behind you happens 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.100
 horrible things spice a liner here ó 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.990
 This book is bothering knowing I 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:35.670
 I got here close and ready happy 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:38.110
 second book and who is behind me 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.450
 fucking god 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.580
 many people die out of nowhere or 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.670
 scary means that it is close and 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:47.230
 another that is already random dependence 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:49.360
 You can choose any map you have there. 

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:51.430
 putting the lander mode on it 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.160
 swap randomly 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.780
 I'm afraid he'll change 

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.700
 randomly a lot of books I think 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.080
 that eight on the map 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.840
 so it will always fall into places 

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:05.320
 different and we will see every decade 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.690
 Smoke aló document that did not appear 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:11.020

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:13.660
 completely here, this fucking he 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:16.360
 he climbed it he survived it but he was 

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:18.580
 by the way he was angry chain 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.470
 I'm afraid that bringing more 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.630
 development that molds us a lot 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.070
 cool leaving and end up installing talking 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.860

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.860

00:02:54.299 --> 00:03:04.530
