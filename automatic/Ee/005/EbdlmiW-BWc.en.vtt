except for that one there but the mind
kind<00:02:38.249> of<00:02:38.370> fills<00:02:38.909> that<00:02:39.120> in<00:02:39.299> I<00:02:39.540> do<00:02:40.310> it's<00:02:41.310> pretty

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:41.639 
kind of fills that in I do it's pretty

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:47.420 
kind of fills that in I do it's pretty
cool<00:02:41.790> how<00:02:42.030> that<00:02:42.209> mind<00:02:45.290> and<00:02:46.290> then<00:02:46.650> I<00:02:46.680> hear<00:02:47.189> those

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
cool how that mind and then I hear those

00:02:47.430 --> 00:03:14.760 
cool how that mind and then I hear those
here<00:02:48.829> slight<00:02:49.829> smile<00:02:51.680> the

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.770 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:16.920 

what<00:03:15.760> the<00:03:15.850> trick<00:03:16.030> to<00:03:16.120> drawing<00:03:16.360> circles<00:03:16.780> is

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
what the trick to drawing circles is

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.230 
what the trick to drawing circles is
don't<00:03:17.920> draw<00:03:18.070> from<00:03:18.250> the<00:03:18.400> fingers<00:03:18.700> draw<00:03:18.850> from

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:19.240 
don't draw from the fingers draw from

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:42.380 
don't draw from the fingers draw from
wrist<00:03:20.200> to<00:03:20.400> make<00:03:21.400> sense

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:46.660 

so<00:03:43.390> that's<00:03:43.569> kind<00:03:44.439> of<00:03:44.470> what<00:03:44.590> I<00:03:44.620> got

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
so that's kind of what I got

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:48.190 
so that's kind of what I got
and<00:03:47.210> I'm<00:03:47.330> going<00:03:47.540> to<00:03:47.630> kind<00:03:47.780> of<00:03:47.810> fast<00:03:48.020> off

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:48.200 
and I'm going to kind of fast off

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.120 
and I'm going to kind of fast off
probably<00:03:48.380> needs<00:03:48.590> more<00:03:48.680> backwards<00:03:51.040> then<00:03:52.040> you

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.130 
probably needs more backwards then you

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:55.840 
probably needs more backwards then you
can<00:03:52.250> also<00:03:52.750> make<00:03:53.750> a<00:03:54.440> use<00:03:55.160> a<00:03:55.190> sharpie<00:03:55.610> but

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.850 
can also make a use a sharpie but

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:59.970 
can also make a use a sharpie but
sometimes<00:03:56.480> it's<00:03:56.690> great<00:03:57.260> thank<00:03:57.530> you<00:03:57.680> just

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
sometimes it's great thank you just

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:01.210 
sometimes it's great thank you just
thank<00:04:00.980> you

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
thank you

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.010 
thank you
you<00:04:01.430> can<00:04:01.580> either<00:04:01.670> put<00:04:02.209> the<00:04:02.360> ink<00:04:02.510> right<00:04:02.690> on<00:04:02.840> the

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:03.020 
you can either put the ink right on the

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:04.570 
you can either put the ink right on the
paper<00:04:03.410> you<00:04:03.709> put<00:04:03.890> on<00:04:04.010> another<00:04:04.220> piece<00:04:04.459> of<00:04:04.490> paper

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:04.580 
paper you put on another piece of paper

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:09.280 
paper you put on another piece of paper
like<00:04:04.910> this<00:04:05.770> all<00:04:06.770> right<00:04:07.630> so<00:04:08.630> that's<00:04:08.720> her<00:04:08.930> year

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:09.290 
like this all right so that's her year

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.140 
like this all right so that's her year
the<00:04:10.070> plane<00:04:10.280> over<00:04:10.520> here<00:04:10.550> so<00:04:10.880> if<00:04:10.940> there's<00:04:11.090> a

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
the plane over here so if there's a

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:13.120 
the plane over here so if there's a
light<00:04:11.300> source<00:04:11.510> underneath<00:04:11.930> it's<00:04:12.470> almost<00:04:12.980> like

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.130 
light source underneath it's almost like

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:17.050 
light source underneath it's almost like
drawing<00:04:13.340> a<00:04:13.550> cube<00:04:13.870> that<00:04:15.430> all<00:04:16.430> right<00:04:16.579> having

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:17.060 
drawing a cube that all right having

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.599 
drawing a cube that all right having
that<00:04:17.690> face<00:04:18.019> be<00:04:18.260> black<00:04:18.530> right<00:04:19.190> so<00:04:19.310> that<00:04:19.340> that

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:19.609 
that face be black right so that that

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:23.470 
that face be black right so that that
face<00:04:20.000> of<00:04:20.239> that<00:04:20.390> shape<00:04:20.600> is<00:04:20.750> why<00:04:22.240> that's<00:04:23.240> the

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:23.480 
face of that shape is why that's the

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.620 
face of that shape is why that's the
carve<00:04:23.720> out<00:04:23.900> and<00:04:24.140> the<00:04:24.850> jowl<00:04:25.850> is<00:04:26.210> the<00:04:26.360> cheeks

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
carve out and the jowl is the cheeks

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:30.130 
carve out and the jowl is the cheeks
that<00:04:28.300> the<00:04:29.300> same<00:04:29.480> way<00:04:29.630> I<00:04:29.660> was<00:04:29.870> talking<00:04:30.080> about

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:30.140 
that the same way I was talking about

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:31.900 
that the same way I was talking about
that<00:04:30.380> cue<00:04:30.590> ball<00:04:30.620> if<00:04:31.190> you<00:04:31.340> look<00:04:31.580> at<00:04:31.730> like<00:04:31.880> a

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:31.910 
that cue ball if you look at like a

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:33.909 
that cue ball if you look at like a
windshield<00:04:32.270> to<00:04:32.750> the<00:04:32.810> car<00:04:33.110> a<00:04:33.350> lot<00:04:33.530> of<00:04:33.590> times<00:04:33.770> you

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:33.919 
windshield to the car a lot of times you

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:37.120 
windshield to the car a lot of times you
will<00:04:34.010> see<00:04:34.250> things<00:04:34.700> like<00:04:34.910> this<00:04:35.410> right<00:04:36.410> or<00:04:37.010> an

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130 
will see things like this right or an

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:37.690 
will see things like this right or an
apple

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:37.700 
apple

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:42.760 
apple
you'll<00:04:38.570> see<00:04:40.600> right<00:04:41.600> that<00:04:42.380> was<00:04:42.470> a<00:04:42.500> shorthand

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770 
you'll see right that was a shorthand

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:47.340 
you'll see right that was a shorthand
for<00:04:42.950> an<00:04:43.130> apple<00:04:43.400> right<00:04:43.550> back<00:04:43.730> in<00:04:43.820> the<00:04:43.910> day<00:04:46.030> right

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.350 
for an apple right back in the day right

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:49.600 
for an apple right back in the day right
that<00:04:48.350> is

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:49.610 
that is

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:51.879 
that is
that's<00:04:50.270> a<00:04:50.360> window<00:04:50.539> right<00:04:50.870> that's<00:04:51.229> left<00:04:51.680> of<00:04:51.800> the

00:04:51.879 --> 00:04:51.889 
that's a window right that's left of the

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:57.879 
that's a window right that's left of the
window<00:04:54.310> the<00:04:55.310> windows<00:04:55.639> I<00:04:56.289> this<00:04:57.289> whole<00:04:57.530> what<00:04:57.800> is

00:04:57.879 --> 00:04:57.889 
window the windows I this whole what is

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:02.140 
window the windows I this whole what is
the<00:04:58.009> expression<00:04:59.050> Hey<00:05:00.080> so<00:05:01.009> the<00:05:01.759> same<00:05:01.939> way<00:05:02.060> you

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:02.150 
the expression Hey so the same way you

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:03.369 
the expression Hey so the same way you
have<00:05:02.240> a<00:05:02.300> windshield<00:05:02.599> you<00:05:02.870> have<00:05:02.960> a<00:05:02.990> reflection

00:05:03.369 --> 00:05:03.379 
have a windshield you have a reflection

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:06.909 
have a windshield you have a reflection
of<00:05:03.469> the<00:05:03.530> buildings<00:05:04.009> on<00:05:04.310> the<00:05:04.639> street<00:05:05.860> if<00:05:06.860> you

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:06.919 
of the buildings on the street if you

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:08.379 
of the buildings on the street if you
have<00:05:07.099> a<00:05:07.129> curved<00:05:07.460> surface<00:05:07.550> that<00:05:08.150> curved

00:05:08.379 --> 00:05:08.389 
have a curved surface that curved

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:10.480 
have a curved surface that curved
surface<00:05:08.780> will<00:05:08.990> reflect<00:05:09.259> things<00:05:09.710> around<00:05:09.949> it<00:05:10.189> so

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:10.490 
surface will reflect things around it so

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:12.369 
surface will reflect things around it so
I'm<00:05:11.300> just<00:05:11.360> going<00:05:11.629> to<00:05:11.659> pretend<00:05:11.990> like<00:05:12.110> there's<00:05:12.319> a

00:05:12.369 --> 00:05:12.379 
I'm just going to pretend like there's a

00:05:12.379 --> 00:05:21.249 
I'm just going to pretend like there's a
window<00:05:12.650> over<00:05:12.830> here<00:05:19.270> see<00:05:20.270> how<00:05:20.419> that<00:05:20.629> kind<00:05:21.139> of

00:05:21.249 --> 00:05:21.259 
window over here see how that kind of

00:05:21.259 --> 00:05:24.040 
window over here see how that kind of
now<00:05:21.409> looks<00:05:21.710> like<00:05:21.800> a<00:05:21.949> reflection<00:05:22.550> right<00:05:23.240> is

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050 
now looks like a reflection right is

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:35.090 
now looks like a reflection right is
actually<00:05:24.259> something

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:35.100 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:37.730 

and<00:05:36.100> then<00:05:36.280> uh

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:37.740 
and then uh

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:40.010 
and then uh
it's<00:05:38.160> going<00:05:38.280> to<00:05:38.340> film<00:05:38.490> the<00:05:38.580> wife<00:05:38.790> here<00:05:39.060> fix<00:05:39.870> her
