very difficult to kill or disable and it

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:29.500 
very difficult to kill or disable and it

will kill any known armor in the world

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.639 
will kill any known armor in the world
today<00:00:31.449> more<00:00:32.449> than<00:00:32.480> anything<00:00:32.989> else

today more than anything else
the<00:00:33.829> javelin<00:00:34.100> success<00:00:34.879> is<00:00:35.120> down<00:00:35.449> to<00:00:35.719> the<00:00:35.750> fact

00:00:36.099 --> 00:00:36.109 
the javelin success is down to the fact

00:00:36.109 --> 00:00:39.219 
the javelin success is down to the fact
that<00:00:36.230> once<00:00:36.800> fired<00:00:37.219> it<00:00:37.879> almost<00:00:38.329> guarantees<00:00:38.780> a

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:39.229 
that once fired it almost guarantees a

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:44.709 
that once fired it almost guarantees a
kill<00:00:39.769> every<00:00:40.729> time<00:00:41.030> and<00:00:41.809> 95%<00:00:42.739> hit<00:00:43.280> rate<00:00:43.460> at<00:00:43.719> 2500

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
meters and Beyond is something very new

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.459 
meters and Beyond is something very new
and<00:00:48.079> very<00:00:48.350> different<00:00:48.620> for<00:00:49.550> our<00:00:49.579> infantryman

00:00:50.459 --> 00:00:50.469 
and very different for our infantryman

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:52.629 
and very different for our infantryman
here's<00:00:51.469> how<00:00:51.679> it<00:00:51.829> achieved<00:00:52.190> such<00:00:52.489> an

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:52.639 
here's how it achieved such an

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:56.020 
here's how it achieved such an
incredible<00:00:53.179> strike<00:00:53.569> ratio<00:00:54.549> first<00:00:55.549> is<00:00:55.789> our

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:56.030 
incredible strike ratio first is our

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.809 
incredible strike ratio first is our
imaging<00:00:56.629> infrared<00:00:56.780> sensor<00:00:57.409> next<00:00:58.249> that<00:00:58.699> is

00:00:58.809 --> 00:00:58.819 
imaging infrared sensor next that is

00:00:58.819 --> 00:01:00.669 
imaging infrared sensor next that is
controlled<00:00:59.179> by<00:00:59.239> the<00:00:59.329> tracker<00:00:59.659> and<00:00:59.959> then<00:01:00.559> the

00:01:00.669 --> 00:01:00.679 
controlled by the tracker and then the

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:02.919 
controlled by the tracker and then the
software<00:01:01.159> then<00:01:01.429> provides<00:01:02.120> the<00:01:02.269> commands<00:01:02.629> to

00:01:02.919 --> 00:01:02.929 
software then provides the commands to

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:06.219 
software then provides the commands to
the<00:01:03.229> cast<00:01:03.469> the<00:01:03.709> steers<00:01:04.010> to<00:01:04.220> the<00:01:04.309> target<00:01:05.229> he

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
the cast the steers to the target he

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:09.010 
the cast the steers to the target he
sees<00:01:06.530> the<00:01:06.770> target<00:01:07.190> he<00:01:07.580> looks<00:01:07.880> at<00:01:08.119> his<00:01:08.540> little

sees the target he looks at his little

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.460 
sees the target he looks at his little
screen<00:01:09.470> and<00:01:09.770> he<00:01:10.430> builds<00:01:11.240> a<00:01:11.390> box<00:01:11.690> around<00:01:12.320> that

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
screen and he builds a box around that

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.500 
screen and he builds a box around that
target<00:01:13.040> on<00:01:13.190> his<00:01:13.430> screen<00:01:13.700> and<00:01:13.940> he<00:01:14.030> narrows<00:01:14.360> it

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:14.510 
target on his screen and he narrows it

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:15.790 
target on his screen and he narrows it
down<00:01:14.540> narrows<00:01:14.990> it<00:01:15.110> down<00:01:15.140> and<00:01:15.440> narrows<00:01:15.620> it<00:01:15.770> down

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:15.800 
down narrows it down and narrows it down

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.970 
down narrows it down and narrows it down
and<00:01:16.220> then<00:01:16.760> he<00:01:16.850> passes<00:01:17.120> it<00:01:17.330> to<00:01:17.480> the<00:01:18.200> missile<00:01:18.590> and

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:18.980 
and then he passes it to the missile and

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.720 
and then he passes it to the missile and
pulls<00:01:19.400> the<00:01:19.550> trigger<00:01:19.580> and<00:01:19.880> launches<00:01:20.480> it

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:21.730 
pulls the trigger and launches it

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:24.940 
pulls the trigger and launches it
the<00:01:22.730> u.s.<00:01:23.150> javelin<00:01:23.780> has<00:01:24.050> two<00:01:24.380> different<00:01:24.620> ways

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
the u.s. javelin has two different ways

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.910 
the u.s. javelin has two different ways
of<00:01:25.250> taking<00:01:25.730> out<00:01:25.850> its<00:01:26.060> targets<00:01:26.560> direct<00:01:27.560> attack

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:27.920 
of taking out its targets direct attack

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.580 
of taking out its targets direct attack
which<00:01:28.400> is<00:01:28.640> where<00:01:28.880> the<00:01:29.120> missile<00:01:29.870> flies

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:30.590 
which is where the missile flies

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.240 
which is where the missile flies
directly<00:01:31.250> from<00:01:31.400> the<00:01:31.580> launch<00:01:31.820> unit<00:01:33.130> to<00:01:34.130> the
