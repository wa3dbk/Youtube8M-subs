best chance of picking up points is that

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.320

a<00:01:17.130> fair<00:01:17.340> assessment<00:01:17.460> in<00:01:17.820> your<00:01:17.939> eyes<00:01:18.060> or<00:01:18.210> do<00:01:18.270> you

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
a fair assessment in your eyes or do you

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.580 
a fair assessment in your eyes or do you
think<00:01:18.509> every<00:01:18.720> game<00:01:18.869> from<00:01:18.990> here<00:01:19.170> on<00:01:19.259> in<00:01:19.409> is

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
think every game from here on in is

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.200 
think every game from here on in is
crucial<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.070> potentially<00:01:20.670> a<00:01:20.700> chance<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.090> pick

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
crucial and potentially a chance to pick

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.749 
crucial and potentially a chance to pick
up<00:01:21.299> points<00:01:21.540> it<00:01:22.380> does<00:01:22.590> i<00:01:22.619> say<00:01:22.890> we<00:01:23.070> we<00:01:23.520> haven't

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
up points it does i say we we haven't

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.780 
up points it does i say we we haven't
going<00:01:23.909> off<00:01:24.030> points<00:01:24.299> now<00:01:24.479> we<00:01:25.049> need<00:01:25.200> more<00:01:25.350> points

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 
going off points now we need more points

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.370

all the way if they see a team that's
out<00:03:47.160> there<00:03:47.310> fighting<00:03:47.579> for<00:03:48.000> that<00:03:48.360> for<00:03:48.600> the

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
out there fighting for that for the

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.110 
out there fighting for that for the
