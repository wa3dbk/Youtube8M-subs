 hello how about friends in today's video 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.830
 Well, we have a small gameplay of 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.539
 this new game called ernesto game 2 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.910
 so you can here we already have it 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.380
 we are in the game garage but for 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.360
 example here we have the map all the 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.580
 that we have to travel today for the day 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:30.000
 14 that if I'm not wrong means that 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.650
 I've made 14 attempts here in the 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.980
 bottom part, we are seeing all 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.230
 the 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.940
 all that the components or the 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:39.670
 parts of the car for example that we have 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.770
 the engine the transmission over here we have 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.150
 the fuel tank then here 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:45.309
 in the upper part we observe the 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:47.140
 money but we give it up for 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:48.820
 keep talking more about this game well 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.500
 that I am telling you how we see is a 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:54.449
 game where we are seeing the 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.449
 One screen controls for 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.620
 to accelerate we also have in the 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:02.140
 right part to the other button that is like 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:05.480
 of propulsion the left side we have 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:08.560
 two buttons to kill 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.560
 the automobile 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:17.049
 well I'm also commenting that in 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:19.119
 As for the details of the game , 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:21.579
 refers an adobe version of 2.3 as 

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:24.220
 minimum the size is 100 megabytes not 

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:26.020
 starts too much and then we're not going to 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:26.920
 can find totally free in 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.810
 google play 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.819
 always interesting they have work in the 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.710
 address currently in link that says 

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:35.679
 all the files here so you know what 

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:39.340
 are visiting and as you can see we have 

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:41.530
 to complete the whole journey but more 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.869
 at the top and I was left without 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:46.899
 fuel but as we see here we 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:48.789
 says to earn 139 dollars then 

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:51.159
 we go back to the garage and here we can 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:53.740
 do for example different purchases if 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:56.170
 we want to increase the deposit of 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:02:00.009
 fuel we buy it so that more 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:02.110
 reach us, let's see here, it does not tire us 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:04.299
 here if it reaches me to improve the 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:08.479

 100 megabyte size and it's a game 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.790
