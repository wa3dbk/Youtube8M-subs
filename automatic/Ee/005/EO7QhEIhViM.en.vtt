to you you have to move quickly not too
bad<00:00:47.520> so<00:00:47.789> I'll<00:00:47.879> fast<00:00:48.120> forward<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.629> next

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
bad so I'll fast forward to the next

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:50.900 
bad so I'll fast forward to the next
area<00:00:49.050> and<00:00:49.500> these<00:00:50.010> are<00:00:50.100> all<00:00:50.160> in<00:00:50.309> order<00:00:50.610> so<00:00:50.820> if

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
area and these are all in order so if

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.040 
area and these are all in order so if
you<00:00:50.969> were<00:00:51.090> going<00:00:51.270> for<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.480> chomps<00:00:51.750> is<00:00:51.840> how<00:00:51.989> you

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
you were going for the chomps is how you

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.529 
you were going for the chomps is how you
would<00:00:52.199> do<00:00:52.320> it<00:00:52.350> so<00:00:52.730> next<00:00:53.730> is<00:00:53.879> laser<00:00:54.059> Quest<00:00:54.329> and

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
would do it so next is laser Quest and

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:58.750 
would do it so next is laser Quest and
turn<00:00:54.750> come<00:00:54.930> sweep<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.710> hidden<00:00:55.949> laser<00:00:56.129> error

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
turn come sweep the hidden laser error

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.430 
turn come sweep the hidden laser error
the<00:00:59.760> photo<00:00:59.969> say<00:01:00.270> arena<00:01:00.510> sir<00:01:01.020> appear

the photo say arena sir appear
yeah<00:01:01.710> bailout<00:01:02.520> and<00:01:02.670> grab<00:01:03.120> this<00:01:03.300> box<00:01:03.600> this<00:01:04.350> will

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
yeah bailout and grab this box this will

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.320 
yeah bailout and grab this box this will
deactivate<00:01:04.680> that<00:01:05.040> Laser<00:01:05.460> grid<00:01:05.820> all<00:01:06.150> right

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
deactivate that Laser grid all right

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.510 
deactivate that Laser grid all right
there<00:01:06.689> that<00:01:07.110> we<00:01:07.200> just<00:01:07.229> jumped<00:01:07.619> over<00:01:07.710> just<00:01:08.400> get

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
there that we just jumped over just get

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.630 
there that we just jumped over just get
back<00:01:08.880> right<00:01:09.119> on<00:01:09.180> into<00:01:09.510> it<00:01:09.950> obviously<00:01:10.950> if<00:01:11.460> I<00:01:11.549> was

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
back right on into it obviously if I was

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.120 
back right on into it obviously if I was
going<00:01:11.820> for<00:01:11.909> that<00:01:11.970> 50<00:01:12.420> or<00:01:12.479> less<00:01:12.570> faults<00:01:12.990> I'd<00:01:13.979> be

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
going for that 50 or less faults I'd be

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.410 
going for that 50 or less faults I'd be
a<00:01:14.159> little<00:01:14.400> more<00:01:14.549> careful<00:01:14.790> instead<00:01:15.180> of<00:01:15.240> dying

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
a little more careful instead of dying

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.810 
a little more careful instead of dying
every<00:01:15.540> time<00:01:15.720> I<00:01:15.750> try<00:01:15.869> to<00:01:15.930> get<00:01:16.080> into<00:01:16.229> one<00:01:16.700> so<00:01:17.700> this

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
every time I try to get into one so this

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:18.950 
every time I try to get into one so this
one's<00:01:18.000> a<00:01:18.060> little<00:01:18.180> bit<00:01:18.360> more<00:01:18.479> difficult<00:01:18.869> so

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
one's a little bit more difficult so

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.170 
one's a little bit more difficult so
I'll<00:01:19.500> cut<00:01:19.680> a<00:01:19.710> bit<00:01:19.890> here<00:01:20.930> it's<00:01:21.930> just<00:01:22.229> again

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:23.180 
I'll cut a bit here it's just again

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:24.950 
I'll cut a bit here it's just again
trial<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.270> error<00:01:24.360> just<00:01:24.540> try<00:01:24.689> and<00:01:24.750> get<00:01:24.869> the

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
trial and error just try and get the

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.499 
trial and error just try and get the

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.730 
I just gotta do a slight bunny hop get
into<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.759> end<00:01:50.880> so<00:01:51.630> our<00:01:51.720> final<00:01:52.140> one<00:01:52.290> is<00:01:52.500> the

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
into the end so our final one is the

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.219 
into the end so our final one is the
gravity<00:01:53.670> of<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:54.030> situation<00:01:54.149> which<00:01:55.079> is

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
gravity of the situation which is

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.740 
gravity of the situation which is
entering<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.799> pin<00:01:56.009> and<00:01:56.100> gravity<00:01:56.399> chamber<00:01:56.750> so

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
entering the pin and gravity chamber so

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.429 
entering the pin and gravity chamber so
right<00:01:58.020> when<00:01:58.140> you<00:01:58.200> come<00:01:58.259> outside

00:01:59.429 --> 00:01:59.439 
right when you come outside

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:01.740 
right when you come outside
alright<00:01:59.770> go<00:01:59.979> on<00:02:00.009> up<00:02:00.280> here<00:02:00.579> you<00:02:01.420> can<00:02:01.539> get<00:02:01.659> to

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
alright go on up here you can get to

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.109 
alright go on up here you can get to
this<00:02:01.869> checkpoint<00:02:02.140> road<00:02:02.469> over<00:02:02.680> here<00:02:03.119> and

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:04.119 
this checkpoint road over here and

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:06.539 
this checkpoint road over here and
you're<00:02:04.299> gonna<00:02:04.450> bail<00:02:05.049> your<00:02:05.380> body<00:02:05.590> right<00:02:06.280> up

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:06.549 
you're gonna bail your body right up

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:10.290 
you're gonna bail your body right up
above<00:02:07.440> into<00:02:08.440> this<00:02:08.590> piece<00:02:08.890> and<00:02:09.300> short-circuit

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
above into this piece and short-circuit

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.360 
above into this piece and short-circuit
it<00:02:10.420> this<00:02:10.929> will<00:02:11.140> open<00:02:11.290> up<00:02:11.590> the<00:02:11.830> doors<00:02:12.069> behind

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
it this will open up the doors behind

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:14.520 
it this will open up the doors behind
you<00:02:12.670> I<00:02:12.970> draft<00:02:13.360> that<00:02:13.569> checkpoints<00:02:14.170> Dunkel

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
you I draft that checkpoints Dunkel

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:15.900 
you I draft that checkpoints Dunkel
plastics<00:02:14.950> the<00:02:15.040> doors<00:02:15.250> will<00:02:15.370> shut<00:02:15.580> on<00:02:15.610> you<00:02:15.790> and

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
plastics the doors will shut on you and

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.280 
plastics the doors will shut on you and
you'll<00:02:16.000> be<00:02:16.090> stuck<00:02:16.269> inside<00:02:16.390> and<00:02:16.780> then<00:02:17.080> we'll<00:02:17.200> be

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
you'll be stuck inside and then we'll be

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.850 
you'll be stuck inside and then we'll be
in<00:02:17.319> the<00:02:17.410> gravity<00:02:17.709> chamber<00:02:18.000> for<00:02:19.000> this<00:02:19.120> one<00:02:19.860> it's

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
in the gravity chamber for this one it's

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.009 
in the gravity chamber for this one it's
just<00:02:21.120> bouncing<00:02:22.120> around<00:02:22.180> the<00:02:22.360> rooms<00:02:22.540> with<00:02:22.810> low

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:23.019 
just bouncing around the rooms with low

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:25.860 
just bouncing around the rooms with low
gravity<00:02:23.290> a<00:02:24.040> little<00:02:24.160> challenging<00:02:25.120> for<00:02:25.750> their

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
gravity a little challenging for their

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.360 
gravity a little challenging for their
each<00:02:26.050> again<00:02:26.349> nice<00:02:26.530> bounce<00:02:26.800> to<00:02:26.950> get<00:02:27.040> up<00:02:27.160> here

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
each again nice bounce to get up here

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:33.470 
each again nice bounce to get up here
accelerating<00:02:30.370> will<00:02:30.580> rotate<00:02:31.060> right<00:02:31.660> a<00:02:32.110> bit

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
accelerating will rotate right a bit

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.330 
accelerating will rotate right a bit
reversing<00:02:34.480> will<00:02:34.599> rotate<00:02:34.720> you<00:02:34.930> left<00:02:35.170> a<00:02:35.290> bit<00:02:35.470> and

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
reversing will rotate you left a bit and

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.720 
reversing will rotate you left a bit and
it's<00:02:36.970> just<00:02:37.180> uh<00:02:37.799> it's<00:02:38.799> really<00:02:39.220> trial<00:02:39.489> and<00:02:39.549> error

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
it's just uh it's really trial and error

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.140 
it's just uh it's really trial and error
for<00:02:39.790> this<00:02:40.030> one<00:02:40.209> I<00:02:40.239> mean<00:02:41.670> it<00:02:42.670> took<00:02:42.790> me<00:02:42.849> a<00:02:43.000> while

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
for this one I mean it took me a while

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:44.430 
for this one I mean it took me a while
just<00:02:43.420> to<00:02:43.569> like<00:02:43.720> to<00:02:43.870> figure<00:02:44.049> out<00:02:44.290> everything

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
just to like to figure out everything

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.670 
just to like to figure out everything
but<00:02:45.120> plain<00:02:46.120> and<00:02:46.269> simple<00:02:46.599> that's<00:02:47.380> how<00:02:47.530> you<00:02:47.590> get

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
but plain and simple that's how you get

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:48.750 
but plain and simple that's how you get
to<00:02:47.709> achievements<00:02:48.280> how<00:02:48.340> you<00:02:48.400> get<00:02:48.519> all<00:02:48.610> these

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
to achievements how you get all these

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.610 
to achievements how you get all these
done<00:02:49.000> if<00:02:49.630> you<00:02:49.750> guys<00:02:49.810> have<00:02:49.989> any<00:02:50.110> questions<00:02:50.500> or
