environment as well as for their health

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:24.409 
environment as well as for their health
if<00:00:22.380> you<00:00:22.500> sterilize<00:00:22.890> one<00:00:23.099> dog<00:00:23.369> you<00:00:24.210> can

00:00:24.409 --> 00:00:24.419 
if you sterilize one dog you can

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:26.179 
if you sterilize one dog you can
restrict<00:00:24.900> sixty<00:00:25.200> seven<00:00:25.439> thousand<00:00:25.770> births<00:00:25.919> and

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
restrict sixty seven thousand births and

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.459 
restrict sixty seven thousand births and
in<00:00:26.309> six<00:00:26.610> years<00:00:26.700> and<00:00:27.090> if<00:00:27.630> you<00:00:27.719> sterilize<00:00:28.140> one

00:00:28.459 --> 00:00:28.469 
in six years and if you sterilize one

00:00:28.469 --> 00:00:31.369 
in six years and if you sterilize one
cat<00:00:28.849> female<00:00:29.849> cat<00:00:30.090> if<00:00:30.239> you<00:00:30.270> can<00:00:30.480> chop<00:00:30.809> about

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:31.379 
cat female cat if you can chop about

00:00:31.379 --> 00:00:32.930 
cat female cat if you can chop about
three<00:00:31.680> like<00:00:31.860> seventy<00:00:32.219> thousand<00:00:32.550> births<00:00:32.730> in

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
three like seventy thousand births in

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.670 
three like seventy thousand births in
seven<00:00:33.239> years<00:00:33.270> so<00:00:34.050> these<00:00:34.140> are<00:00:34.290> great<00:00:34.500> numbers

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
seven years so these are great numbers

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.799 
seven years so these are great numbers
and<00:00:34.950> we<00:00:35.399> obviously<00:00:35.670> don't<00:00:35.969> have<00:00:36.149> homes<00:00:36.539> for

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
and we obviously don't have homes for

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:37.279 
and we obviously don't have homes for
all<00:00:36.840> of<00:00:37.020> them

00:00:37.279 --> 00:00:37.289 
all of them

00:00:37.289 --> 00:00:39.319 
all of them
so<00:00:37.590> I<00:00:37.620> think<00:00:37.860> it's<00:00:38.100> very<00:00:38.250> important<00:00:38.760> to<00:00:38.789> make

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
so I think it's very important to make

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.840 
so I think it's very important to make
people<00:00:39.360> aware<00:00:39.660> how<00:00:40.309> you<00:00:41.309> know<00:00:41.399> how<00:00:41.550> you<00:00:41.609> can

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
people aware how you know how you can

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.000 
people aware how you know how you can
help<00:00:41.999> by<00:00:42.659> getting<00:00:42.899> your<00:00:43.140> animals<00:00:43.559> sterilized

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
help by getting your animals sterilized

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.770 
help by getting your animals sterilized

not that healthy yeah I think this is

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.289 
not that healthy yeah I think this is
the<00:01:09.990> way<00:01:10.110> to<00:01:10.170> go<00:01:10.380> I<00:01:10.830> remember<00:01:11.820> when<00:01:11.970> I<00:01:12.000> was<00:01:12.150> in

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
the way to go I remember when I was in

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.050 
the way to go I remember when I was in
Delhi<00:01:12.570> I<00:01:12.810> used<00:01:13.290> to<00:01:13.380> feed<00:01:13.560> a<00:01:13.590> dog<00:01:13.980> outside<00:01:14.910> my

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
Delhi I used to feed a dog outside my

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.120 
Delhi I used to feed a dog outside my
house<00:01:15.240> I<00:01:15.990> even<00:01:16.710> called<00:01:17.010> him<00:01:17.190> and

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130 
house I even called him and

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.029 
house I even called him and
I<00:01:18.159> call<00:01:19.119> him<00:01:19.270> John<00:01:19.299> and<00:01:20.289> I<00:01:20.560> think<00:01:20.770> he's

00:01:21.029 --> 00:01:21.039 
I call him John and I think he's

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:23.160

slightly<00:01:21.219> a<00:01:21.340> big<00:01:21.640> healthy<00:01:22.060> dog<00:01:22.299> and<00:01:22.840> I<00:01:22.960> think

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 
slightly a big healthy dog and I think

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:24.959 
slightly a big healthy dog and I think
they're<00:01:23.259> amazing<00:01:23.469> they<00:01:24.159> have<00:01:24.189> great<00:01:24.490> immunity

to everything via the rain some winter

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:29.520 
to everything via the rain some winter
all<00:01:28.000> it<00:01:28.210> takes<00:01:28.390> is<00:01:28.539> one<00:01:28.720> biscuit<00:01:29.170> to<00:01:29.289> become

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
all it takes is one biscuit to become

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:30.149 
all it takes is one biscuit to become
friends<00:01:29.770> with<00:01:29.799> them

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:30.159 
friends with them

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:32.310 
friends with them
they're<00:01:30.520> extremely<00:01:30.850> friendly<00:01:31.210> they<00:01:31.899> get<00:01:32.079> they

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
they're extremely friendly they get they

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:33.840 
they're extremely friendly they get they
get<00:01:32.409> excited<00:01:32.679> and<00:01:32.890> everything<00:01:33.130> and<00:01:33.399> anything

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
get excited and everything and anything

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:35.999 
get excited and everything and anything
possible<00:01:34.420> so<00:01:35.049> I<00:01:35.079> think<00:01:35.320> this<00:01:35.590> is<00:01:35.740> the<00:01:35.860> way<00:01:35.950> to

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:36.009 
possible so I think this is the way to

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:38.279 
possible so I think this is the way to
go<00:01:36.189> as<00:01:36.610> my<00:01:36.789> t-shirt<00:01:37.090> says<00:01:37.270> what<00:01:37.840> you<00:01:37.990> give<00:01:38.170> is

00:01:38.279 --> 00:01:38.289 
go as my t-shirt says what you give is

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:40.020 
go as my t-shirt says what you give is
what<00:01:38.319> you<00:01:38.560> get<00:01:38.679> back<00:01:38.890> so<00:01:39.280> I<00:01:39.310> think<00:01:39.579> just<00:01:39.939> be

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 
what you get back so I think just be

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:41.520 
what you get back so I think just be
