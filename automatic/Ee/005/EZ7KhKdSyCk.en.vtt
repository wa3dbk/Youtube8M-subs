however<00:03:57.620> the<00:03:57.890> downside<00:03:58.069> of<00:03:58.459> it<00:03:58.670> being<00:03:58.819> so

00:03:59.020 --> 00:03:59.030 
however the downside of it being so

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:00.339 
however the downside of it being so
cheap<00:03:59.269> is<00:03:59.420> the<00:03:59.630> fact<00:03:59.810> that<00:03:59.870> you<00:03:59.989> have<00:04:00.110> to<00:04:00.200> put

00:04:00.339 --> 00:04:00.349 
cheap is the fact that you have to put

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:01.270 
cheap is the fact that you have to put
it<00:04:00.470> together<00:04:00.620> yourself

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
it together yourself

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.039 
it together yourself
it<00:04:01.519> took<00:04:01.670> me<00:04:01.790> forever<00:04:01.970> to<00:04:02.359> put<00:04:02.690> all<00:04:02.750> the<00:04:02.840> beads
