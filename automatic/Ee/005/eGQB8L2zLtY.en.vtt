this computer's just v6 cores on AMC
processor<00:02:38.330> the<00:02:39.330> graphics<00:02:39.720> card<00:02:39.959> should

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
processor the graphics card should

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.570 
processor the graphics card should
probably<00:02:40.440> be<00:02:40.680> a<00:02:40.709> little<00:02:40.890> bit<00:02:41.010> better<00:02:41.190> a

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
probably be a little bit better a

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.270 
probably be a little bit better a
gigabytes<00:02:42.300> of<00:02:42.450> RAM<00:02:42.660> it<00:02:42.959> just<00:02:43.140> the<00:02:43.290> beast

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
gigabytes of RAM it just the beast

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.729 
gigabytes of RAM it just the beast
computer<00:02:45.030> should<00:02:45.720> be<00:02:45.780> they<00:02:46.019> should<00:02:46.410> be<00:02:46.650> able

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
computer should be they should be able

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:49.370 
computer should be they should be able
to<00:02:46.920> process<00:02:47.130> my<00:02:47.459> HD<00:02:48.209> video<00:02:48.480> real<00:02:48.690> fast<00:02:48.930> upload

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
to process my HD video real fast upload

to process my HD video real fast upload
it<00:02:49.470> real<00:02:49.620> fast<00:02:50.420> so<00:02:51.420> I'll<00:02:52.320> probably<00:02:52.650> go<00:02:52.860> from

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
it real fast so I'll probably go from

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.890 
it real fast so I'll probably go from
