blah<00:01:24.750> blah<00:01:24.900> we've<00:01:25.049> seen<00:01:25.170> it<00:01:25.290> many<00:01:25.320> times<00:01:25.500> I

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
blah blah we've seen it many times I

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.859 
blah blah we've seen it many times I
actually<00:01:26.310> added<00:01:26.729> some<00:01:27.000> enjoyment<00:01:27.299> scene<00:01:27.659> back

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
actually added some enjoyment scene back

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.480 
actually added some enjoyment scene back
and<00:01:28.049> it<00:01:28.110> kind<00:01:28.290> of<00:01:28.350> made<00:01:28.770> sense<00:01:28.799> to<00:01:29.159> show<00:01:29.340> those

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
and it kind of made sense to show those

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.010 
and it kind of made sense to show those
flashbacks<00:01:29.939> because<00:01:30.119> it's<00:01:30.390> like<00:01:30.509> now<00:01:30.840> we're

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
flashbacks because it's like now we're

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.679 
flashbacks because it's like now we're
getting<00:01:31.259> more<00:01:31.380> into<00:01:31.619> like<00:01:31.799> Sasuke<00:01:32.100> and<00:01:32.689> that

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
getting more into like Sasuke and that

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.450 
getting more into like Sasuke and that
that<00:01:33.930> type<00:01:34.140> of<00:01:34.170> centric<00:01:34.740> stuff<00:01:35.009> so<00:01:35.189> it's<00:01:35.340> like

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
that type of centric stuff so it's like

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.249 
that type of centric stuff so it's like
okay<00:01:35.909> we<00:01:36.030> get<00:01:36.150> to<00:01:36.240> see<00:01:36.390> those<00:01:36.540> flashbacks<00:01:37.020> and

pretty much the white zetsu it seemed to
us<00:01:56.340> don't<00:01:56.579> assume<00:01:57.149> that<00:01:57.329> Sasuke<00:01:57.630> killed<00:01:58.170> the

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
us don't assume that Sasuke killed the

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.380 
us don't assume that Sasuke killed the
white<00:01:58.890> one<00:01:59.100> when<00:01:59.460> his<00:01:59.579> eyes<00:01:59.790> were<00:02:00.060> you<00:02:00.299> know

that was raised with this episode
but<00:02:13.710> I<00:02:13.740> love<00:02:14.130> seeing<00:02:14.610> Sasuke's<00:02:15.300> ruthlessness

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
but I love seeing Sasuke's ruthlessness

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.100 
against the set so he's like yeah you're

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
not a part of the promise but I'm still

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
I think I like that scene the most out

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:25.880 
I think I like that scene the most out
of<00:02:24.540> the<00:02:24.690> entire<00:02:24.930> episode<00:02:25.410> because<00:02:25.650> it<00:02:25.710> was

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
of the entire episode because it was

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.470 
of the entire episode because it was
like<00:02:25.980> it's<00:02:26.310> showing<00:02:26.670> that<00:02:26.700> Sasuke<00:02:27.180> is<00:02:27.240> ready

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
like it's showing that Sasuke is ready

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.300 
like it's showing that Sasuke is ready
to<00:02:27.660> go<00:02:27.810> to<00:02:27.870> any<00:02:28.200> lengths<00:02:28.650> and<00:02:28.830> you<00:02:28.920> know<00:02:29.040> you

Sasuke<00:03:40.500> thing<00:03:40.680> that<00:03:40.830> you<00:03:40.950> see<00:03:41.100> Tati<00:03:41.520> running<00:03:41.820> I

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
Sasuke thing that you see Tati running I

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.820 
Sasuke thing that you see Tati running I
don't<00:03:42.209> think<00:03:42.360> he<00:03:42.450> actually<00:03:42.600> noticed<00:03:43.290> Itachi<00:03:43.590> I

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:43.830 
don't think he actually noticed Itachi I

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:45.199 
don't think he actually noticed Itachi I
think<00:03:44.130> he<00:03:44.220> saw<00:03:44.400> the<00:03:44.459> birds<00:03:44.730> and<00:03:44.940> sent

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
think he saw the birds and sent

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:46.370 
think he saw the birds and sent
something<00:03:45.630> and<00:03:45.720> he's<00:03:45.810> like<00:03:45.930> wait<00:03:46.080> what's<00:03:46.290> that

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:46.380 
something and he's like wait what's that

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.890 
something and he's like wait what's that
so<00:03:46.980> I<00:03:47.010> think<00:03:47.130> that<00:03:47.430> he's<00:03:47.790> gonna<00:03:48.209> go<00:03:48.450> find<00:03:48.750> out

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
so I think that he's gonna go find out

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:49.960 
so I think that he's gonna go find out
what<00:03:49.080> it<00:03:49.170> is<00:03:49.200> but<00:03:49.410> I<00:03:49.470> don't<00:03:49.560> think<00:03:49.830> he<00:03:49.920> actually

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 
what it is but I don't think he actually

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:53.180 
what it is but I don't think he actually
seen<00:03:50.970> Itachi<00:03:51.510> I<00:03:51.720> think<00:03:51.959> probably<00:03:52.230> in<00:03:52.680> the<00:03:52.950> next

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
seen Itachi I think probably in the next

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:54.680 
seen Itachi I think probably in the next
few<00:03:53.340> episodes<00:03:53.370> he's<00:03:53.910> gonna<00:03:54.090> you<00:03:54.450> know<00:03:54.540> have

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
his encounter with him or whatnot

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.760

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:18.510 
been going on I had progression and it

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:20.330 
been going on I had progression and it
was<00:04:18.780> there<00:04:18.989> the<00:04:19.170> progression<00:04:19.650> was<00:04:19.739> there<00:04:19.950> some

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
was there the progression was there some

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:21.770 
was there the progression was there some
of<00:04:20.459> the<00:04:20.489> good<00:04:20.700> stuff<00:04:20.730> was<00:04:21.120> there<00:04:21.330> it<00:04:21.600> was<00:04:21.750> just

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
of the good stuff was there it was just

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:23.120 
of the good stuff was there it was just
mixed<00:04:22.260> in<00:04:22.410> with<00:04:22.500> everything<00:04:22.830> else<00:04:22.950> so

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
mixed in with everything else so

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:26.300 
mixed in with everything else so
definitely<00:04:23.729> say<00:04:23.940> it<00:04:24.180> was<00:04:24.600> above<00:04:24.960> average<00:04:25.650> but

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
definitely say it was above average but

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:27.140 
definitely say it was above average but
it<00:04:26.520> was<00:04:26.610> mixed<00:04:26.820> in

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
it was mixed in

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:28.790 
it was mixed in
tons<00:04:27.479> of<00:04:27.600> flashbacks<00:04:28.139> so<00:04:28.320> it's<00:04:28.440> really<00:04:28.650> like

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
tons of flashbacks so it's really like

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.620 
tons of flashbacks so it's really like
it<00:04:29.100> gets<00:04:29.430> you<00:04:29.850> know<00:04:29.940> the<00:04:30.180> episode<00:04:30.509> gets

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:30.630 
it gets you know the episode gets

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:32.360 
it gets you know the episode gets
downgraded<00:04:30.870> a<00:04:31.259> bit<00:04:31.410> because<00:04:31.680> of<00:04:31.800> that<00:04:31.949> so<00:04:32.340> I

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
downgraded a bit because of that so I

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.129 
downgraded a bit because of that so I
give<00:04:32.550> this<00:04:32.639> one<00:04:32.699> it's<00:04:33.120> a<00:04:33.270> fine<00:04:33.540> I<00:04:33.570> give<00:04:33.930> it<00:04:34.050> a

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:34.139 
give this one it's a fine I give it a

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:35.749 
give this one it's a fine I give it a
six<00:04:34.350> out<00:04:34.530> of<00:04:34.590> ten<00:04:34.710> I<00:04:35.040> was<00:04:35.220> going<00:04:35.400> to<00:04:35.460> go<00:04:35.550> for

00:04:35.749 --> 00:04:35.759 
six out of ten I was going to go for

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:37.490 
six out of ten I was going to go for
average<00:04:36.150> but<00:04:36.300> I<00:04:36.330> definitely<00:04:36.509> say<00:04:36.870> looking<00:04:37.410> at

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
average but I definitely say looking at

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.200 
average but I definitely say looking at
the<00:04:37.620> key<00:04:37.830> points<00:04:38.190> being<00:04:38.370> in<00:04:38.580> there<00:04:38.759> definitely

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
the key points being in there definitely

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:40.279 
the key points being in there definitely
gives<00:04:39.570> it<00:04:39.660> like<00:04:39.810> okay<00:04:39.930> we<00:04:40.139> got<00:04:40.259> some

00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:40.289 
gives it like okay we got some

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:41.689 
gives it like okay we got some
progression<00:04:40.860> in<00:04:40.949> here<00:04:41.130> even<00:04:41.400> though<00:04:41.520> there

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:41.699 
progression in here even though there

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:43.520 
progression in here even though there
was<00:04:41.880> flashbacks<00:04:42.750> and<00:04:42.960> feel<00:04:43.080> and<00:04:43.229> stuff<00:04:43.380> like

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
was flashbacks and feel and stuff like

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:44.810 
was flashbacks and feel and stuff like
that<00:04:43.740> so<00:04:44.100> I<00:04:44.130> definitely<00:04:44.490> give<00:04:44.580> it<00:04:44.610> that

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:44.820 
that so I definitely give it that

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:46.340 
that so I definitely give it that
animation<00:04:45.449> wasn't<00:04:45.720> all<00:04:45.780> that<00:04:45.930> as<00:04:46.050> well<00:04:46.199> there

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:46.350 
animation wasn't all that as well there

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:47.570 
animation wasn't all that as well there
were<00:04:46.410> some<00:04:46.530> times<00:04:46.740> where<00:04:46.979> like<00:04:47.310> you<00:04:47.400> couldn't

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
were some times where like you couldn't

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.520 
were some times where like you couldn't
even<00:04:47.639> see<00:04:47.880> Sasuke's<00:04:48.300> mouth<00:04:48.539> so<00:04:48.780> that<00:04:48.960> was<00:04:49.470> a

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
even see Sasuke's mouth so that was a

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.320 
even see Sasuke's mouth so that was a
downside<00:04:49.949> to<00:04:50.070> the<00:04:50.160> episode<00:04:50.490> as<00:04:50.610> well<00:04:50.789> it<00:04:51.000> had

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
downside to the episode as well it had

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:52.879 
downside to the episode as well it had
standard<00:04:51.840> animation<00:04:52.289> for<00:04:52.410> the<00:04:52.470> most<00:04:52.620> part<00:04:52.830> but

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:52.889 
standard animation for the most part but

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:55.100 
standard animation for the most part but
there<00:04:53.039> were<00:04:53.130> times<00:04:53.370> where<00:04:53.580> it<00:04:53.850> downgraded<00:04:54.539> so

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:55.110 
there were times where it downgraded so

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:56.719 
there were times where it downgraded so
there's<00:04:55.590> that<00:04:55.830> as<00:04:55.949> well<00:04:56.100> with<00:04:56.190> the<00:04:56.280> animation

00:04:56.719 --> 00:04:56.729 
there's that as well with the animation

00:04:56.729 --> 00:04:58.730 
there's that as well with the animation
and<00:04:56.940> yes<00:04:57.270> episode<00:04:57.750> I<00:04:57.900> got<00:04:58.110> some<00:04:58.259> enjoyment<00:04:58.530> out

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:07.919 
pretty much my take on this episode fine

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:09.170 
pretty much my take on this episode fine
could<00:05:08.490> have<00:05:08.580> been<00:05:08.669> a<00:05:08.699> lot<00:05:08.850> better<00:05:08.880> without

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180 
could have been a lot better without

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.090 
could have been a lot better without
that<00:05:09.330> flashback<00:05:09.750> and<00:05:10.260> you<00:05:10.620> know<00:05:10.740> all<00:05:10.949> that

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:11.100 
that flashback and you know all that

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:12.650 
that flashback and you know all that
other<00:05:11.310> stuff<00:05:11.370> but<00:05:11.669> whatever<00:05:12.000> you<00:05:12.210> know<00:05:12.330> it<00:05:12.510> was

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:12.660 
other stuff but whatever you know it was

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.810 
other stuff but whatever you know it was
a<00:05:12.690> pretty<00:05:13.500> good<00:05:14.010> for<00:05:14.190> what<00:05:14.310> it<00:05:14.340> did<00:05:14.550> I<00:05:14.610> guess

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:14.820 
a pretty good for what it did I guess

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.490 
a pretty good for what it did I guess
you<00:05:14.940> could<00:05:15.090> say<00:05:15.300> with<00:05:15.750> other<00:05:15.900> key<00:05:16.139> points<00:05:16.440> that

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 
you could say with other key points that

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:17.629 
you could say with other key points that
it<00:05:16.680> added<00:05:16.979> let<00:05:17.190> me<00:05:17.250> know<00:05:17.340> what<00:05:17.430> you<00:05:17.520> think
