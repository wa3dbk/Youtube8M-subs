00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
if you want to remove unnecessary bumps

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:18.950 
if you want to remove unnecessary bumps
draw<00:03:13.330> both<00:03:13.720> strokin<00:03:14.560> a<00:03:14.710> rabbit<00:03:15.070> and<00:03:16.000> screw

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:18.960 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.140 

then<00:03:19.960> the<00:03:20.110> system<00:03:20.470> construct<00:03:20.950> a<00:03:21.220> new<00:03:21.460> smooth

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
then the system construct a new smooth

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.340 
then the system construct a new smooth
surface<00:03:23.640> this<00:03:24.640> operation<00:03:25.270> can<00:03:25.600> be<00:03:25.660> used<00:03:25.960> to

surface this operation can be used to

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.100 
surface this operation can be used to
remove<00:03:26.500> a<00:03:26.860> crease<00:03:27.160> to<00:03:27.970> smoothly<00:03:28.270> merge<00:03:28.630> the

after 10 minutes of tutorial and
practice

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:42.450 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:45.080 

finally<00:04:43.290> I<00:04:43.470> will<00:04:43.590> show<00:04:43.740> some<00:04:44.100> example<00:04:44.700> 3d

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
finally I will show some example 3d

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.990 
finally I will show some example 3d

commercial texture map editor note that

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:54.590 
commercial texture map editor note that
these<00:04:53.040> models<00:04:53.430> were<00:04:53.640> quite<00:04:53.970> different<00:04:54.360> from

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600 
these models were quite different from

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.590 
these models were quite different from
typical<00:04:55.410> 3d<00:04:55.980> models<00:04:56.400> because<00:04:57.330> of<00:04:57.540> the

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:57.600 
typical 3d models because of the

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.780 
typical 3d models because of the
hand-drawn<00:04:58.080> nature<00:04:58.530> of<00:04:58.710> the<00:04:58.830> shape<00:04:59.070> this<00:04:59.610> is

00:04:59.780 --> 00:04:59.790 
hand-drawn nature of the shape this is
