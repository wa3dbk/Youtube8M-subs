this<00:01:55.229> is<00:01:55.670> the<00:01:56.670> controller<00:01:57.240> this<00:01:57.600> is<00:01:57.750> basic<00:01:58.049> in

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
this is the controller this is basic in

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.780 
this is the controller this is basic in
trouble<00:01:58.380> everyone<00:01:58.710> got<00:01:58.860> this<00:01:59.009> who's<00:01:59.340> actually

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
trouble everyone got this who's actually

attended the event everyone got a free

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.679 
attended the event everyone got a free
controller<00:02:01.890> which<00:02:02.040> is<00:02:02.130> pretty<00:02:03.119> insane<00:02:03.299> but

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
controller which is pretty insane but

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.289 
controller which is pretty insane but
some<00:02:03.840> reason<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.110> controller's<00:02:04.439> an<00:02:04.710> 18

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:05.299 
some reason the controller's an 18

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:07.039
