00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:49.510
 with the tool zoom and alt 

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:55.070

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:58.490
 opacity 

00:05:55.070 --> 00:06:01.250
 from the layer of the lips I'm going to create a 

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:04.880
 new layer and I will choose a color 

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:08.060
 rosita with the brush tool in a 

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:10.870
 opacity of 50 I will choose a size of 

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:13.360
 big brush 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:15.550
 and I'm going to paint 

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:18.150
 I'll put this layer in the mode of 

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:20.970
 soft light fusion 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:23.520

 That 's the way it is 

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:45.090
 and so it is now in this layer I can 

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:48.270
 reduce the ability to do more 

00:06:45.090 --> 00:06:53.510
