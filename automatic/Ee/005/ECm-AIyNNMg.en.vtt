want to have them leaving the store

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:59.910 
want to have them leaving the store
because<00:03:58.930> they<00:03:59.170> aren't<00:03:59.320> getting<00:03:59.590> their<00:03:59.709> food

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
fast enough that is not something that

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:03.660 
fast enough that is not something that
you<00:04:01.750> want<00:04:01.930> all<00:04:02.500> right<00:04:02.980> there<00:04:03.220> you<00:04:03.310> go

I<00:04:03.930> think<00:04:04.930> that<00:04:05.049> in<00:04:05.170> real<00:04:05.320> life<00:04:05.440> people<00:04:05.470> are<00:04:05.769> a

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860 
I think that in real life people are a

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:07.440 
I think that in real life people are a
lot<00:04:05.980> more<00:04:06.010> patient<00:04:06.519> I<00:04:06.610> don't<00:04:06.760> think<00:04:06.940> I've<00:04:07.420> ever

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
lot more patient I don't think I've ever

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.960 
lot more patient I don't think I've ever
seen<00:04:08.170> somebody<00:04:08.950> leave

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970 
seen somebody leave

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:11.310 
seen somebody leave
because<00:04:10.210> they<00:04:10.360> didn't<00:04:10.540> get<00:04:10.630> their<00:04:10.780> food<00:04:11.020> fast

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:11.320 
because they didn't get their food fast

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:13.350 
because they didn't get their food fast
enough<00:04:11.560> in<00:04:11.680> a<00:04:11.740> fast-food<00:04:12.190> restaurant<00:04:12.310> but<00:04:13.300> I

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:13.360 
enough in a fast-food restaurant but I

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.970 
enough in a fast-food restaurant but I
guess<00:04:13.660> usually<00:04:13.990> fast<00:04:14.170> food<00:04:14.410> restaurants<00:04:14.890> are

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
guess usually fast food restaurants are

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.740 
guess usually fast food restaurants are
quite<00:04:15.220> fast<00:04:15.580> that's<00:04:15.820> why<00:04:15.940> they<00:04:16.360> are<00:04:16.390> called

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
quite fast that's why they are called

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.110 
quite fast that's why they are called
fast<00:04:17.049> food<00:04:17.320> restaurants<00:04:17.950> be<00:04:18.370> quite<00:04:18.609> ironic
