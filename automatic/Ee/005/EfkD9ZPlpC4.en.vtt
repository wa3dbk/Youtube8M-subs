00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.540
 in this video I will explain how 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.440
 make these loops milestones or spirals or 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.590
 what do you want to call 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:13.510
 You see, there are three different 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:15.760
 and I 'm going to teach him to do the 

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:17.200
 three ways these two become more or 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:20.210
 less equal this is a little bit different 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:23.329
 because they are all more or less the same 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:25.039
 this you can use it to make a 

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:27.619
 doll to put her hair or to 

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:30.480
 decorating had some curtains or 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:32.279
 anything you have out there 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.730
 I'm going to start with this one I'm going to leave 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.980
 here for it you see that it is that we started 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.879
 making a row of chains of 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.650
 size you want this is 20 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.900
 I'm going to do this for 10 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:49.440
 so you can see how it is 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.440
 two 

00:00:51.089 --> 00:00:56.699
 456 789 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:05.220
 and now we go back doing a row of 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:08.690
 half points we make another chain and 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.690
 a row of half points 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.950
 half points or low points 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.400
 when we finish what we are going to do 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.110
 is to make an increase in each of the 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.130
 half points then we start 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.670
 doing 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:35.229
 another chain we go around and 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.770
 remember that to make the increases it 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:41.450
 they make two half points at each point of 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:44.149
 the previous round 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.270
 so we make two half points in 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:50.649
 every half point of the previous round 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.649
 total we will have 20 points left 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.350
 You see , we started to pick up a little bit of 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.010
 way so now let's do 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:05.320
 exactly the same a chain and 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:08.110
 we turn around and an increase in each 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:12.840
 half a point from the previous round in 

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.840
 total we will have 40 half points 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.860
 I've finished the fourth round you see 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:27.090
 like being supervised now 

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.400
 what we have to do is go 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.390
 rolling up like this you start with the little corner 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.390
 you are going around 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.230
 and it's finished 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.430
 this wool is a bit more chubby 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:46.790
 then it becomes more chubby once 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:50.220
 end here just cut 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:52.019
 depending on how long you are going to 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.209
 then need to sew it for what 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:55.940
 be a little and you can already 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:58.730
 sew 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:02.599
 well now 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:05.629
 let this be more chubby 

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:07.239
 now you see the difference right away for 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:09.530
 do this we start in the same way 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:13.610
 we started by making a row of chains 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:14.930
 the size that we want that I have 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.530
 today is 20 I'm going to do too 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.530
 is 20 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.890
 456 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:27.890
 8 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.660
 14 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:40.580
 17 18 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:43.300
 19 and 20 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:46.090
 Now let's make a row of Wands 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:49.870
 then we do 1 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:51.700
 and two chains we take zebritas 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.140
 and we left the two vans that we have 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.680
 done and in the third 

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.680
 we click 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:05.390
 and so on until doing 20 double crochet 

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:12.939
 twists or high points 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:16.530
 now let's make a row of media 

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:19.209
 points then we make another chain and 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:23.850
 we come back doing a few rows of means 

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:23.850
 points we will have 20 half points 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:31.180
 well until you get to the end 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:33.729
 You see that it's starting to happen now 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:38.199
 let's make a row of varetas 

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:40.100
 1 and 2 chains we go around 

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:43.850
 we take 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:45.560
 and we make a row of 20 varetas this 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:48.970
 We're not going to make increases or anything 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.970
 only the varetas 

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:55.140
 and so on until completing the round 

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:07.150
 when you finish the row you see that there is a 

00:05:04.529 --> 00:05:10.150
 little curly 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:14.190
 What you do is start with the 

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:14.190
 little corner and you're going around 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:28.120
 it's finished 

00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:36.650
 just like before you cut here when such 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:38.090
 you leave the size of what you want this 

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:41.270
 it stays a little bit bigger because the 

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:43.700
 wool is a bit more chubby 

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:46.190
 good and now let's do this that 

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:48.680
 This is exactly the same as this one 

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:50.840
 that instead of making a row of media 

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:53.390
 points and another one of varetas we make two 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:57.130
 rows of media points 

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:57.130
 I have here my twenty chains 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:03.740
 I have here my 20 chains and now I'm going 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:07.660
 to start making my means points 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:11.590
 we make two rows with half points 

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:13.830
 now when he finishes them he showed us how 

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:13.830
 remains 

00:06:14.129 --> 00:06:18.389
 and I've finished the two laps and we do 

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:21.020
 exactly the same thing we started to 

00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:21.020
 roll it up 

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:33.670
 and it is already 

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:39.949
 we have there the loop cited the spiral or 

00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:39.949
 whatever you want to call it 

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:45.979
 this is believed to be smaller because it is with 

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:45.979
 a more finite wool 

00:06:46.310 --> 00:06:51.650
 and well, depending on what 

00:06:48.590 --> 00:06:56.080
 whatever you want, I put you all 

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:56.080
 then use is one that you use another
