00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:28.490 
you're ready if not run through the move

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:31.600 
you're ready if not run through the move
again<00:05:28.639> and<00:05:29.830> when<00:05:30.830> you<00:05:30.919> feel<00:05:31.070> ready<00:05:31.130> we'll<00:05:31.520> do

again and when you feel ready we'll do
it<00:05:31.700> full<00:05:31.880> speed<00:05:32.030> again<00:05:32.780> this<00:05:33.050> is<00:05:33.169> not<00:05:33.200> a<00:05:33.349> move

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:33.590 
it full speed again this is not a move

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:35.830 
it full speed again this is not a move
you<00:05:33.710> do<00:05:33.830> all<00:05:33.979> night<00:05:34.010> if<00:05:34.400> you<00:05:34.610> don't<00:05:34.849> quite<00:05:35.240> get

you do all night if you don't quite get

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.650 
you do all night if you don't quite get
the<00:05:36.050> full<00:05:37.039> speed<00:05:37.310> down<00:05:37.340> so<00:05:38.270> you<00:05:38.330> can<00:05:38.510> do<00:05:38.630> a

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:38.660 
the full speed down so you can do a

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:40.480 
the full speed down so you can do a
repeatedly<00:05:39.110> that's<00:05:39.380> okay<00:05:39.710> this<00:05:40.280> is<00:05:40.400> just

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:40.490 
repeatedly that's okay this is just

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:41.860 
repeatedly that's okay this is just
something<00:05:40.729> you<00:05:40.910> want<00:05:41.090> to<00:05:41.180> throw<00:05:41.419> in<00:05:41.570> as<00:05:41.750> an

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:46.460 
half speed count nice and slow and then

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:48.089 
half speed count nice and slow and then
we'll<00:05:46.610> try<00:05:46.820> at<00:05:46.970> full<00:05:47.120> speed<00:05:47.300> to<00:05:47.450> the<00:05:47.479> music

we'll go one two and then we're going to

00:05:53.360 --> 00:06:01.050 
we'll go one two and then we're going to
