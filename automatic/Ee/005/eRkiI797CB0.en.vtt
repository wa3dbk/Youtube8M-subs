00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:25.670 
and an incredible machine and so what

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.120 
and an incredible machine and so what
goes<00:00:25.850> on<00:00:26.030> here<00:00:26.300> we<00:00:26.510> obviously<00:00:27.080> you<00:00:27.680> create<00:00:28.010> the

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:30.610 
goes on here we obviously you create the
fast<00:00:28.370> bits<00:00:28.640> so<00:00:29.270> what<00:00:30.140> are<00:00:30.200> you<00:00:30.260> working<00:00:30.380> on

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:30.620 
fast bits so what are you working on

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:32.619 
fast bits so what are you working on
what<00:00:30.800> sort<00:00:31.010> of<00:00:31.040> bits<00:00:31.190> well<00:00:31.730> at<00:00:32.000> moment<00:00:32.390> we<00:00:32.450> just

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:32.629 
what sort of bits well at moment we just

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:34.810

here<00:00:51.679> running<00:00:52.039> morrissey<00:00:52.429> keys<00:00:52.749> most<00:00:53.749> of<00:00:53.870> our

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:53.899 
here running morrissey keys most of our

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:55.509 
here running morrissey keys most of our
machines<00:00:54.230> or<00:00:54.350> more<00:00:54.499> sickies<00:00:54.829> very<00:00:55.129> high-end

00:00:55.509 --> 00:00:55.519 
machines or more sickies very high-end

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:57.520 
machines or more sickies very high-end
very<00:00:55.850> very<00:00:56.210> expensive<00:00:56.390> but<00:00:56.870> really<00:00:57.379> good

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
very very expensive but really good

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.529 
very very expensive but really good
really<00:00:57.890> makes<00:00:58.219> our<00:00:58.399> job<00:00:58.609> so<00:00:58.640> much<00:00:58.969> easier<00:00:59.030> and

00:00:59.529 --> 00:00:59.539 
really makes our job so much easier and

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:02.139 
really makes our job so much easier and
a<00:01:00.530> lot<00:01:01.100> of<00:01:01.159> the<00:01:01.280> tooling<00:01:01.640> here<00:01:01.819> if<00:01:01.909> you<00:01:01.999> have<00:01:02.120> a

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:02.149 
a lot of the tooling here if you have a

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:04.270 
a lot of the tooling here if you have a
look<00:01:02.300> as<00:01:02.420> all<00:01:02.600> sandvik<00:01:03.050> so<00:01:03.739> once<00:01:03.949> again<00:01:04.100> it's<00:01:04.250> a

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
look as all sandvik so once again it's a

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.340 
look as all sandvik so once again it's a
very<00:01:04.489> high-end<00:01:04.699> product<00:01:05.269> and<00:01:05.510> we<00:01:06.110> try<00:01:06.290> and

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
very high-end product and we try and

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.440 
very high-end product and we try and
associates<00:01:06.860> with<00:01:07.100> ourselves<00:01:07.580> of<00:01:08.060> high-end

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:08.450 
associates with ourselves of high-end

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.149 
associates with ourselves of high-end
stuff<00:01:08.659> because<00:01:09.020> we<00:01:09.229> do<00:01:09.470> high-end<00:01:09.740> stuff

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:10.159 
stuff because we do high-end stuff

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:13.060 
stuff because we do high-end stuff
that's<00:01:10.610> good<00:01:10.850> mate<00:01:11.030> so<00:01:11.329> I<00:01:11.899> guess<00:01:12.649> one<00:01:12.829> of<00:01:12.860> the

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
that's good mate so I guess one of the

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:14.590 
that's good mate so I guess one of the
things<00:01:13.310> that<00:01:13.579> I<00:01:13.700> get<00:01:13.880> blown<00:01:14.060> away<00:01:14.210> with<00:01:14.450> when<00:01:14.570> I

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:14.600 
things that I get blown away with when I

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.600 
things that I get blown away with when I
come<00:01:14.810> down<00:01:14.840> here<00:01:15.020> is<00:01:15.229> how<00:01:15.350> much<00:01:15.469> waste<00:01:15.770> is<00:01:16.159> done

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
come down here is how much waste is done

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.940 
come down here is how much waste is done
from<00:01:16.939> a<00:01:17.090> block<00:01:17.329> of<00:01:17.540> of<00:01:17.990> aluminium<00:01:18.259> or<00:01:18.649> whatever

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
from a block of of aluminium or whatever

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.889 
from a block of of aluminium or whatever
it<00:01:19.070> is<00:01:19.100> so<00:01:19.430> let's<00:01:20.030> just<00:01:20.210> use<00:01:20.329> a<00:01:20.360> wheel<00:01:20.600> nut<00:01:20.780> for

00:01:20.889 --> 00:01:20.899 
it is so let's just use a wheel nut for

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:23.289 
it is so let's just use a wheel nut for
example<00:01:21.409> what<00:01:21.920> waste<00:01:22.460> is<00:01:22.759> there<00:01:22.969> so<00:01:23.149> what

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:23.299 
example what waste is there so what

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:25.120 
example what waste is there so what
weight<00:01:23.719> is<00:01:23.930> a<00:01:23.960> block<00:01:24.259> and<00:01:24.500> what<00:01:24.740> do<00:01:24.799> you<00:01:24.829> end<00:01:25.009> up

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
weight is a block and what do you end up

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.100 
weight is a block and what do you end up
with<00:01:25.250> well<00:01:25.610> look<00:01:25.759> there's<00:01:26.689> probably<00:01:26.960> about

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:27.110 
with well look there's probably about

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.319 
with well look there's probably about
seventy<00:01:27.860> percent<00:01:27.979> waste<00:01:28.369> out<00:01:28.700> of<00:01:28.880> a<00:01:28.939> wheel<00:01:29.119> nut

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:29.329 
seventy percent waste out of a wheel nut

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:32.410 
seventy percent waste out of a wheel nut
but<00:01:29.539> one<00:01:29.630> of<00:01:29.719> the<00:01:29.780> great<00:01:29.930> examples<00:01:30.439> is<00:01:30.560> a<00:01:31.420> some

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
but one of the great examples is a some

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.270 
but one of the great examples is a some
housing<00:01:32.899> that<00:01:33.110> comes<00:01:33.409> out<00:01:33.530> of<00:01:33.590> a<00:01:33.680> hundred<00:01:33.829> kilo

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
housing that comes out of a hundred kilo

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.580 
housing that comes out of a hundred kilo
block<00:01:34.549> and<00:01:34.880> it's<00:01:35.119> ten<00:01:35.450> kilos<00:01:36.109> when<00:01:36.469> it's

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:36.590 
block and it's ten kilos when it's

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.279 
block and it's ten kilos when it's
finished<00:01:36.740> we<00:01:37.310> take<00:01:37.549> 4<00:01:37.880> 44<00:01:38.570> gallon<00:01:38.750> drums<00:01:39.109> of

00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:39.289 
finished we take 4 44 gallon drums of

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:41.139 
finished we take 4 44 gallon drums of
swarf<00:01:39.590> out<00:01:39.890> of<00:01:40.100> the<00:01:40.159> machine<00:01:40.219> from<00:01:40.609> it<00:01:40.759> the

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:41.149 
swarf out of the machine from it the

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:43.120 
swarf out of the machine from it the
great<00:01:41.359> thing<00:01:41.390> is<00:01:41.630> all<00:01:41.990> the<00:01:42.229> waste<00:01:42.500> the<00:01:42.829> swore

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
great thing is all the waste the swore

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.580 
great thing is all the waste the swore
them<00:01:43.640> gets<00:01:43.909> recycled<00:01:44.299> so<00:01:45.140> yeah<00:01:45.320> it's<00:01:45.469> quite

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
them gets recycled so yeah it's quite
