if the horse was to trot on when I asked
for<00:02:07.850> long<00:02:08.030> walk<00:02:08.270> I'd<00:02:08.660> do<00:02:08.929> an<00:02:09.050> immediate

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
for long walk I'd do an immediate

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.440 
for long walk I'd do an immediate
downward<00:02:10.009> transition<00:02:10.640> to<00:02:10.819> tell<00:02:11.060> him<00:02:11.180> it<00:02:11.300> was

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
downward transition to tell him it was

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.750 
downward transition to tell him it was
the<00:02:11.600> wrong<00:02:11.780> answer<00:02:11.840> and<00:02:12.590> then<00:02:13.250> immediately

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
the wrong answer and then immediately

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.060 
the wrong answer and then immediately
kick<00:02:13.970> again<00:02:14.330> until<00:02:15.140> he<00:02:15.230> learns<00:02:15.440> the<00:02:15.710> correct

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
kick again until he learns the correct

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.420 
kick again until he learns the correct
response<00:02:16.550> is<00:02:16.880> to<00:02:17.420> take<00:02:17.690> long

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
response is to take long

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.500 
response is to take long
relaxed<00:02:19.090> strides<00:02:20.099> if<00:02:21.099> he<00:02:21.549> didn't<00:02:21.879> answer<00:02:22.090> my

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
relaxed strides if he didn't answer my

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.770 
relaxed strides if he didn't answer my
question<00:02:23.349> of<00:02:23.859> nudge<00:02:24.370> I<00:02:24.760> could<00:02:25.209> use<00:02:25.390> the<00:02:25.569> whip

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
question of nudge I could use the whip

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.080 
question of nudge I could use the whip
to<00:02:26.349> help<00:02:26.560> increase<00:02:26.859> the<00:02:27.400> rain<00:02:27.579> free<00:02:27.879> shower

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
to help increase the rain free shower

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.119 
to help increase the rain free shower
just<00:02:28.599> giving<00:02:28.959> them<00:02:29.019> a<00:02:29.140> little<00:02:29.379> flick<00:02:29.680> at<00:02:29.920> the

00:02:30.119 --> 00:02:30.129 
just giving them a little flick at the

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:35.039 
just giving them a little flick at the
same<00:02:30.400> time<00:02:30.670> as<00:02:30.849> I<00:02:30.939> use<00:02:31.180> my<00:02:31.420> league<00:02:31.629> in<00:02:33.329> trot<00:02:34.329> my

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:35.049 
same time as I use my league in trot my

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:39.509 
same time as I use my league in trot my
tool<00:02:35.349> for<00:02:35.620> relaxation<00:02:35.950> is<00:02:36.700> a<00:02:37.150> nice<00:02:37.799> slow<00:02:38.799> trot

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
tool for relaxation is a nice slow trot

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:43.349 
tool for relaxation is a nice slow trot
the<00:02:39.909> slower<00:02:40.389> I<00:02:40.629> can<00:02:41.049> get<00:02:41.319> it<00:02:41.469> to<00:02:42.099> remain<00:02:42.579> the

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:43.359 
the slower I can get it to remain the

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:45.750 
the slower I can get it to remain the
more<00:02:43.659> and<00:02:43.900> rhythm<00:02:44.260> and<00:02:44.409> more<00:02:45.069> relaxed<00:02:45.579> the

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
more and rhythm and more relaxed the

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.899 
more and rhythm and more relaxed the
horse<00:02:46.000> becomes<00:02:46.650> so<00:02:47.650> that's<00:02:47.859> my<00:02:48.069> two<00:02:48.340> forms<00:02:48.790> of

00:02:48.899 --> 00:02:48.909 
horse becomes so that's my two forms of

horse becomes so that's my two forms of
relaxation<00:02:49.739> long<00:02:50.739> walk<00:02:51.310> and<00:02:51.669> then<00:02:52.450> very<00:02:52.959> slow

00:02:53.429 --> 00:02:53.439 
relaxation long walk and then very slow

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:56.580 
relaxation long walk and then very slow
trot<00:02:53.980> I<00:02:54.370> want<00:02:55.030> to<00:02:55.120> make<00:02:55.239> sure<00:02:55.269> I<00:02:55.540> can<00:02:55.900> give<00:02:56.560> for

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
trot I want to make sure I can give for

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:59.640 
trot I want to make sure I can give for
two<00:02:57.099> beats<00:02:57.400> and<00:02:57.730> he<00:02:58.329> stays<00:02:58.689> trotting<00:02:59.319> very

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
two beats and he stays trotting very

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.059 
two beats and he stays trotting very
very<00:03:00.310> slowly<00:03:00.790> that<00:03:01.659> way<00:03:01.900> I<00:03:01.930> know<00:03:02.109> he's<00:03:02.470> relaxed

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:03.069 
very slowly that way I know he's relaxed

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:06.179 
very slowly that way I know he's relaxed
and<00:03:03.250> not<00:03:03.879> showing<00:03:04.180> any<00:03:04.540> forms<00:03:05.049> of<00:03:05.260> the<00:03:05.919> flight

response
once<00:03:08.829> again<00:03:09.040> relaxation<00:03:09.790> is<00:03:10.030> a<00:03:10.090> really

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
once again relaxation is a really

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:12.509 
once again relaxation is a really
important<00:03:10.900> part<00:03:11.049> of<00:03:11.200> our<00:03:11.319> training<00:03:11.650> and<00:03:12.010> if

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
important part of our training and if

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:14.759 
important part of our training and if
the<00:03:12.639> horse<00:03:12.849> isn't<00:03:13.120> relaxed<00:03:13.810> it<00:03:14.200> makes<00:03:14.469> it<00:03:14.650> very

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769 
the horse isn't relaxed it makes it very

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:17.190 
the horse isn't relaxed it makes it very
hard<00:03:15.069> for<00:03:15.189> him<00:03:15.459> to<00:03:15.639> learn<00:03:15.840> I'm<00:03:16.840> Jodie
