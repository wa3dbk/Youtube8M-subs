00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:06.450 
took the shirt off and painted his body

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:10.370 
took the shirt off and painted his body
so<00:06:06.810> he<00:06:06.840> had<00:06:07.260> to<00:06:07.410> look<00:06:08.190> like<00:06:08.460> some<00:06:08.730> of<00:06:08.880> the<00:06:09.380> other
