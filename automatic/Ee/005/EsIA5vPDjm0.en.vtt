looking<00:01:27.729> at<00:01:27.759> the<00:01:27.850> games<00:01:28.090> that<00:01:28.270> we've<00:01:28.450> released

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 
looking at the games that we've released

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:30.990 
looking at the games that we've released
and<00:01:29.380> with<00:01:29.530> a<00:01:29.560> move<00:01:29.799> we<00:01:30.039> know<00:01:30.159> a<00:01:30.190> lot<00:01:30.490> of<00:01:30.520> detail

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
and with a move we know a lot of detail

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.059 
and with a move we know a lot of detail
about<00:01:31.179> where<00:01:31.479> it<00:01:31.659> is<00:01:31.810> what<00:01:32.110> orientation<00:01:32.500> it<00:01:32.890> is

00:01:33.059 --> 00:01:33.069

and<00:01:33.280> so<00:01:33.640> gives<00:01:34.000> a<00:01:34.270> significant<00:01:35.140> advance<00:01:35.530> on

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
and so gives a significant advance on

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.309 
and so gives a significant advance on
how<00:01:35.920> we<00:01:36.429> can<00:01:36.550> interact<00:01:37.090> and<00:01:37.780> then<00:01:37.929> we<00:01:38.050> wonder

00:01:38.309 --> 00:01:38.319 
how we can interact and then we wonder

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:40.590 
how we can interact and then we wonder
book<00:01:38.530> we<00:01:38.950> know<00:01:39.130> where<00:01:39.759> the<00:01:39.909> book<00:01:40.090> is<00:01:40.240> which

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
book we know where the book is which

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.169 
book we know where the book is which
pages<00:01:40.960> you're<00:01:41.319> on<00:01:41.440> what<00:01:42.039> its<00:01:42.190> orientation<00:01:42.789> is

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:43.179 
pages you're on what its orientation is

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:45.480 
pages you're on what its orientation is
and<00:01:43.929> so<00:01:44.170> on<00:01:44.350> the<00:01:44.590> challenges<00:01:45.039> really<00:01:45.220> are<00:01:45.460> just

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:45.490 
and so on the challenges really are just

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.639 
and so on the challenges really are just
making<00:01:46.240> sure<00:01:46.390> it's<00:01:46.720> very<00:01:46.929> simple<00:01:47.200> and<00:01:47.500> easy

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:47.649 
making sure it's very simple and easy

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:49.320

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 
but we're really confident because then

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.899 
but we're really confident because then
what<00:01:50.140> a<00:01:50.170> book<00:01:50.409> is<00:01:50.440> is<00:01:50.799> known<00:01:51.130> by<00:01:51.429> everybody<00:01:51.700> in
