Hey, Bass Resource fans, Mike Iaconelli here.

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:06.450
I want to talk to you about dropshotting.

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.930
I'm going to go over three things you need
to do to really become a better dropshot fisherman

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:14.990
and understand dropshotting.

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.470
The first one is probably the most simple
thing you're ever going to hear, but it's

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.380
one of the most important.

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.100
That is actually not moving the bait.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:29.539
It's a really hard thing to do because, in
fishing, for years and years, we've been taught

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:36.390
to make a cast, to use our rod and our reel
to impart action on the bait.

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.880
But in dropshotting, it's really the essence
of neutral action, or natural movement.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:46.971
The first thing in dropshotting I want you
to do is that when you make a cast and you

00:00:46.971 --> 00:00:52.040
get that bait down to where you're fishing,
instead of shaking your rod, or dragging,

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.520
or hopping it, I want you to just leave it
there.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:56.789
Just hold it in place.

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.320
I know what you're thinking.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.190
You're thinking, "Why am I going to do that?

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:01.949
The bait's not going to move."

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.899
It's going to move, if you think about it.

00:01:04.899 --> 00:01:06.450
First of all, we've got current.

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.020
There's current in every body of water we
fish.

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.010
Obviously, if it's a river, there's current,
man-made reservoirs, there's current, but

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.999
even in natural lakes, even in a little pond,
there's current.

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:18.630
Things like wind.

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.029
Things like boat traffic.

00:01:20.029 --> 00:01:21.700
All that creates a natural current.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:27.159
So the bait's sitting on the bottom without
you moving it, it's going to have a very neutral,

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:28.869
natural movement.

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:32.479
The other thing is we all move inherently.

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:37.859
If you take your hand and you put it in front
of you and you look at it, nobody's perfectly

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:38.859
still.

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:43.299
We all have a little shake to us and when
you cast that bait out there, you let it get

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:48.759
to the bottom and you just hold it there,
that natural movement of your hand is transmitted

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:54.749
through the rod, down the line to the bait,
and it's going to impart that subtle movement

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:55.789
of the bait.

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:59.679
The first tip for dropshotting is, "Don't
move the bait."

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:02.429
Make a cast and let it sit on the bottom.

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:08.200
The second tip I have for dropshotting, and
it's an important one, is the hook set after

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.860
you get that bite.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.400
This is a hard one for me personally because
I love jacking fish.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:19.250
It's one of my favorite things in the world
to do, is to have a big jig, or a big worm

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.819
and then to jack those fish, to rip those
fish.

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:26.480
In dropshotting, you've got to get away from
that mentality.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.390
I want you to use a hookset technique called
a sweep set technique.

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:36.230
Basically, in a sweep set technique, you're
not jacking the fish.

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:41.500
You're not ripping the fish, but you're gently
reeling into that bite.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.030
When you're dropshotting and you've got the
bait out there and you're not moving it and

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.850
all of a sudden you get that bite and he starts
swimming away, hold yourself back.

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:52.129
Don't jack that fish.

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:57.500
When you feel that movement of that fish going
away, I want you to get your body, get your

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.920
rod and sweep your rod to the side.

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.810
At the same time, step back.

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.830
When you do that, your rod's going to load
up and that little hook, whatever kind of

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:12.540
hook you're using, is going to get into that
fish's mouth and you're going to have that

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:13.719
fish hooked.

00:03:13.719 --> 00:03:16.140
Stop yourself from jacking that fish.

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:23.689
Step back and sweep your rod and 99.9% of
the time you're going to hook that fish up

00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:25.859
and he's going to be in the boat.

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:30.390
Tip number two, "Don't jack the fish."

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:34.730
Sweep step into them and that fish is going
to get in the boat.

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:41.730
The last tip I want to give you is real important
when you're fishing dropshot in deeper water.

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:47.579
This is using your electronics as your underwater
eyes.

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:53.719
In its simplest form, when you're in shallow
water, or you're in super clear water, you

00:03:53.719 --> 00:03:54.719
can use your eyes.

00:03:54.719 --> 00:03:59.730
You put on your polarized glasses, you see
a fish swimming, you throw that dropshot to

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:01.480
him, you catch him.

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.590
When you're in deep water, when you're in
dirty water, off colored water, when you're

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:11.450
in 30, 40, 50 feet, you can't see those fish
with your eyes, your physical eyes, but you're

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.730
going to use your electronics to see those
fish.

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.620
I want you to use your graph.

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.280
I want you to mount that transducer on the
foot of your trolling motor.

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:27.090
I want you to turn your sensitivity up and,
finally, I want you to turn your ping speed

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:28.160
up.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.160
Every depth finder in the world, whether it's
Lowrance, or some other brand, you're going

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:37.139
to be able to go in and turn your ping speed
to its maximum setting.

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:42.349
When you do that, you're going to get real
time response from your depth finder.

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:47.310
When you're in that deep water, dirty water,
click your bail and hold your dropshot right

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:49.370
by the foot of the trolling motor.

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.990
As you do that, keep an eye on your graph.

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:57.200
Now that you've got your sensitivity up, you've
got your ping speed super high, you're going

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:01.449
to be able to see things come on the screen
as they happen.

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:08.699
When you see anything that's out of the ordinary,
if it's a fish arc, if it's a cloud, a ball

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:15.680
of bait, or even if it's just a little change
in bottom contour, I want you to instantly

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.870
drop that bait down to the bottom.

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:21.210
Your bail's already clicked, so you're instantly
going to drop it.

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:25.990
As you drop it, you're going to be able to
see your line going down.

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:28.990
You're going to be able to see the weight,
and you're going to be able to see the bait.

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:33.580
It's the most unbelievable thing, but with
today's depth finders, especially Lowrance

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:36.120
units, you're going to see it all happen.

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:41.690
As that bait falls, you're actually going
to be able to see it get to that change, that

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:45.060
fish, or that ball of bait, or that change
in the bottom, you're going to see it fall

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:46.060
to it.

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:51.460
A lot of times as it happens, you see that
fish rise up, you can stop the bait.

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:53.300
All of a sudden, the fish is going to grab
it.

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:56.879
You do that sweep step, and you've got it
in the boat.

00:05:56.879 --> 00:06:03.360
Tip number three is learn to use your electronics
as your underwater eyes and drop to those

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:04.520
fish.

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:09.259
If you use those three tips when you're dropshotting,
I guarantee you're going to become a better

00:06:09.259 --> 00:06:10.259
dropshotter.
