don't know if it came with the coal
looking<00:02:42.540> aluminum<00:02:43.380> wheels<00:02:43.590> had<00:02:44.460> the<00:02:44.670> color

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
looking aluminum wheels had the color

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:48.800 
looking aluminum wheels had the color
coated<00:02:46.050> hubcaps<00:02:46.470> or<00:02:46.800> had<00:02:47.460> the<00:02:47.670> rally<00:02:48.510> wheels

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810

like<00:02:49.320> I<00:02:49.470> just<00:02:49.530> put<00:02:49.800> on<00:02:49.860> here<00:02:50.250> so<00:02:50.880> this<00:02:51.090> is<00:02:51.330> what

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
like I just put on here so this is what

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.500 
like I just put on here so this is what
the<00:02:51.690> car<00:02:51.930> will<00:02:52.140> have<00:02:52.320> when<00:02:52.830> I<00:02:52.860> sell<00:02:53.250> it<00:02:53.280> and<00:02:53.940> you

the car will have when I sell it and you

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.410 
the car will have when I sell it and you
guys<00:02:54.690> can<00:02:54.930> probably<00:02:55.140> guess<00:02:55.820> what<00:02:56.820> those<00:02:57.030> Chevy

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
guys can probably guess what those Chevy

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.980 
guys can probably guess what those Chevy
rallies<00:02:57.810> are<00:02:57.960> going<00:02:58.170> to<00:02:58.260> go<00:02:58.380> on<00:02:59.180> hint<00:03:00.180> it's

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:00.990 
rallies are going to go on hint it's

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:03.440

white<00:03:01.320> and<00:03:01.560> it<00:03:01.680> has<00:03:01.830> hubcaps<00:03:02.370> and<00:03:02.700> it's<00:03:03.360> a

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
white and it has hubcaps and it's a

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.980 
white and it has hubcaps and it's a
Chevy<00:03:03.690> so<00:03:04.580> there<00:03:05.580> you<00:03:05.730> go<00:03:05.910> just<00:03:06.600> a<00:03:06.780> quick
