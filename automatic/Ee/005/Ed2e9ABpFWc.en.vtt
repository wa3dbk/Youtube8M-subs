00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.400
 this is probably the coolest feature ever. 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.410
 lego story 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:10.679
 hello today i will show you the set 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.910
 from the lego creator series under article number 31 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.120
 031 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:18.500
 But he is called the animals of the jungle 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:21.779
 set released 2015 it includes itself 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:24.119
 215 parts in a set there are many 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.220
 moving parts parts are small and 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.380
 big eyes and much more that 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.039
 allow you to create any living 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.980
 creatures 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:37.739
 Spout in the box we have three packages with 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.180
 details and instructions as always 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.899
 one instruction 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.370
 this is one of the models presented 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:46.850
 we start with a little model well, 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.850
 let's finish the main character of this set 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.850
 parrot 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.219
 well then let's collect 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.620
 so the first model is small 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.500
 tropical fish 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.660
 maybe it's a piranha but if you have 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:23.590
 other suggestions then you can write 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:26.290
 This is in the comments of the moving fish 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.430
 fins and tail and on this functional 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.130
 is ending 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:33.750
 the model is rather not meant for playing 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.750
 but in order to please the eye 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:47.340
 after assembly, a whole mountain of parts remains 

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:50.250
 purely theoretically fish could 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.319
 do and more but we rejoice in that 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:56.900
 now let's collect 

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:56.900
 chameleon this should be interesting 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.170
 not 

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:57.050
 but their million and this model already 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:59.360
 bigger and more interesting lego chameleon 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:02.030
 very similar to his real fellow 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:04.670
 except that the body is not able to change the color in 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:07.070
 chameleon mobile not only eyes 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:09.920
 but also paws which already have two points 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:11.510
 articulation as well as tail which 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.150
 movable at three points 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:21.650
 you can also turn your head which 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:24.230
 hinged as a whole model 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:27.860
 more fish but still not the most 

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:28.610
 large sizes well and now we understand 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:32.050
 chameleon 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.050
 and go to the fun 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:59.950
 the third build includes as many as three 

00:05:56.180 --> 00:06:01.130
 models are some kind of tropical insects 

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:04.040
 frog 

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:06.050
 and also the parrot fly looks very 

00:06:04.040 --> 00:06:08.450
 funny and she is very small but when 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:11.210
 This big-eyed however I think she not 

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:15.650
 full heroes of this set but rather 

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:18.170
 serves simply food deed frog 

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:21.050
 we really liked all the legs like 

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:23.750
 real well and the eyes are the same as in a fly 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:25.700
 they give the animal some comic 

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:27.110
 also worth noting that frogs 

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:30.550
 feet move 

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:30.550
 it also opens its mouth 

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:45.910
 and here is a parrot parrot like 

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:48.580
 coloring dwells in tropical forests 

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:50.380
 South and Central America this is not for you 

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:51.190
 some wavy home 

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:54.940
 parrot 

00:06:51.190 --> 00:06:57.250
 the parrot has wings on each of 

00:06:54.940 --> 00:07:01.410
 three largest wings 

00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:01.410
 feathers that also move 

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:14.050
 legs also a lot of mobile not only 

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:17.250
 that they turn so also 

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:17.250
 bend in three places 

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:26.169
 but also the most unusual feature of this 

00:07:25.419 --> 00:07:27.789
 a parrot 

00:07:26.169 --> 00:07:30.610
 this is what it represents 

00:07:27.789 --> 00:07:33.879
 active digestive system 

00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:36.270
 first he eats some food after 

00:07:33.879 --> 00:07:38.860
 of this for a while 

00:07:36.270 --> 00:07:43.060
 Well, then you yourself understand that 

00:07:38.860 --> 00:07:45.639
 going to be honest I see in the set 

00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:48.849
 lego for the first time is me a little 

00:07:45.639 --> 00:07:51.430
 surprised and amused generally accomplished 

00:07:48.849 --> 00:07:53.860
 quite interesting in the end I can say 

00:07:51.430 --> 00:07:56.710
 the fact that the last build is complete 

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:59.590
 meet your expectations all the little animals 

00:07:56.710 --> 00:08:01.810
 Crater League's wonderful series started 

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:06.210
 releasing more and more different 

00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:09.069
 animals and i think it is interesting to many 

00:08:06.210 --> 00:08:11.520
 thank you all for watching see you soon 

00:08:09.069 --> 00:08:11.520
 meeting
