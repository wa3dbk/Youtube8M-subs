wrong is demonstrating

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:57.459 
wrong is demonstrating
here<00:01:53.810> is<00:01:55.329> good<00:01:56.329> they<00:01:56.539> put<00:01:56.990> the<00:01:57.079> balls<00:01:57.319> of<00:01:57.409> the

00:01:59.499 --> 00:01:59.509 
feet into the door jamb there and have

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:01.899 
feet into the door jamb there and have
the<00:01:59.630> heel<00:01:59.840> dug<00:02:00.109> dug<00:02:00.439> into<00:02:00.649> the<00:02:00.829> floor<00:02:01.100> and

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
the heel dug dug into the floor and

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:04.419 
the heel dug dug into the floor and
she's<00:02:02.899> gonna<00:02:03.049> want<00:02:03.289> to<00:02:03.380> really<00:02:03.799> push<00:02:04.100> her<00:02:04.280> head

00:02:04.419 --> 00:02:04.429 
she's gonna want to really push her head

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:06.639 
she's gonna want to really push her head
forward<00:02:05.000> here<00:02:05.240> again<00:02:05.539> and<00:02:06.140> that's<00:02:06.319> gonna<00:02:06.469> give

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 
forward here again and that's gonna give

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:10.180 
forward here again and that's gonna give
them<00:02:06.740> a<00:02:06.799> very<00:02:07.039> good<00:02:07.280> stretch<00:02:07.729> on<00:02:08.090> that<00:02:09.190> calf

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
them a very good stretch on that calf

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.490 
them a very good stretch on that calf
there<00:02:10.549> so<00:02:11.299> when<00:02:11.540> the<00:02:11.690> legs<00:02:11.900> straight<00:02:12.290> like

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
there so when the legs straight like

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.410 
there so when the legs straight like
that<00:02:12.530> you're<00:02:13.040> stretching<00:02:13.370> the<00:02:13.910> gastrocnemius

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
that you're stretching the gastrocnemius

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.350 
that you're stretching the gastrocnemius
which<00:02:14.810> is<00:02:15.170> the<00:02:15.349> two<00:02:15.620> muscles<00:02:16.129> on<00:02:16.340> the<00:02:16.519> top<00:02:16.790> that

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
which is the two muscles on the top that

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.750 
which is the two muscles on the top that
we<00:02:17.540> see<00:02:17.840> but<00:02:18.470> the<00:02:18.590> calf<00:02:18.860> now<00:02:19.459> there's<00:02:19.700> another

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
we see but the calf now there's another

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.400 
we see but the calf now there's another
muscle<00:02:20.299> where<00:02:20.480> you<00:02:20.540> can<00:02:20.690> go<00:02:20.810> and<00:02:20.840> relax<00:02:20.989> if

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
muscle where you can go and relax if

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:22.960 
muscle where you can go and relax if
you'd<00:02:21.530> like<00:02:21.680> to<00:02:21.890> there's<00:02:22.340> another<00:02:22.580> muscle

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
you'd like to there's another muscle

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.550 
you'd like to there's another muscle
that<00:02:23.030> runs<00:02:23.180> underneath<00:02:23.599> the<00:02:23.750> calves<00:02:24.230> is

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
that runs underneath the calves is

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.470 
that runs underneath the calves is
called<00:02:24.799> the<00:02:24.890> is<00:02:25.160> soleus<00:02:25.700> muscle<00:02:26.150> and<00:02:26.329> that's

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
called the is soleus muscle and that's

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.720 
called the is soleus muscle and that's
what<00:02:26.660> gives<00:02:26.840> the<00:02:27.049> cactus<00:02:27.470> thickness<00:02:27.980> people

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
what gives the cactus thickness people

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.309 
what gives the cactus thickness people
often<00:02:28.970> times<00:02:29.120> you<00:02:29.239> forget<00:02:29.360> about<00:02:29.599> this<00:02:29.840> muscle

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319 
often times you forget about this muscle

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:32.770 
often times you forget about this muscle
we<00:02:30.709> want<00:02:30.890> to<00:02:30.980> stretch<00:02:31.220> that<00:02:31.400> as<00:02:31.549> well<00:02:31.790> it's<00:02:32.420> a

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
we want to stretch that as well it's a

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.650 
we want to stretch that as well it's a
very<00:02:33.019> key<00:02:33.260> component<00:02:33.290> in<00:02:34.099> the<00:02:34.970> whole<00:02:35.180> pushing

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
very key component in the whole pushing

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.110 
very key component in the whole pushing
off<00:02:35.840> and<00:02:36.170> running<00:02:36.739> phase<00:02:37.010> or<00:02:37.370> even<00:02:37.700> regular

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
off and running phase or even regular

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.839 
off and running phase or even regular
gate<00:02:38.629> phase<00:02:38.900> so<00:02:39.590> what<00:02:40.069> what<00:02:40.459> you<00:02:40.489> want<00:02:40.700> to<00:02:40.760> do

00:02:40.839 --> 00:02:40.849 
gate phase so what what you want to do

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:42.610 
gate phase so what what you want to do
to<00:02:41.060> stretch<00:02:41.329> that<00:02:41.540> one<00:02:41.720> out<00:02:41.870> is<00:02:42.140> you<00:02:42.319> have<00:02:42.470> to

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
to stretch that one out is you have to

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.380 
to stretch that one out is you have to

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 
bend the knee and then push forward so

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.089 
bend the knee and then push forward so
with<00:02:47.569> the<00:02:47.690> knee<00:02:47.870> bent<00:02:48.230> like<00:02:48.440> that<00:02:48.470> you're

here<00:02:51.590> where<00:02:52.069> the<00:02:52.220> Achilles<00:02:52.640> tendon<00:02:53.060> is<00:02:53.209> so

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:53.569 
here where the Achilles tendon is so

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:56.110 
here where the Achilles tendon is so
it's<00:02:53.780> a<00:02:53.870> very<00:02:54.079> good<00:02:54.440> stretch<00:02:54.799> to<00:02:55.120> prevent

it's a very good stretch to prevent

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:59.559 
it's a very good stretch to prevent
achilles<00:02:56.690> tendonitis<00:02:57.910> you<00:02:58.910> know<00:02:59.090> rupture<00:02:59.480> to

00:02:59.559 --> 00:02:59.569 
achilles tendonitis you know rupture to
