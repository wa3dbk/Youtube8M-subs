00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:06.920
 the personal side today we will solve 

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:08.479
 an equation 

00:00:08.479 --> 00:00:11.619
 of high school in complete 

00:00:11.619 --> 00:00:12.969
 the equation 

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:14.329
 type 

00:00:14.329 --> 00:00:17.329
 chile are with the owner of 

00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:20.939
 4th x 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.589
 equal to zero 

00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:26.060
 in attacking the court situation we have 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.009
 x to the square 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:30.609
 and we have less quantity exported 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:33.070
 we have know him to take 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.110
 the coefficient of a second-degree equation will be a number that 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.540
 ready it or multiplying diesel block 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.120
 but you do not have a number when you do not have a number later 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.890
 removed his number 1 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:47.750
 the courier of sergipe 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.090
 will be a number that multiplies to ensure this 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.570
 in this recent example of milk -4 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.330
 command we came in past classes a second equation has to have 

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.230
 the coefficient of air 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:06.960
 his coefficient I knew him to say to be called a complete invasion by 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:07.760
 example 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:10.230
 he started using the court 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.170
 - 4x 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.530
 more 18 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:14.590
 and almost nothing 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.920
 note that in this equation rio pm the variable xix squared until yesterday the 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:20.350
 merchant air 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:21.970
 would be number 1 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:27.710
 the variable is your country try to see it would be minus four and variable cvt 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.740
 the merchant being would be a number plus eight 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.590
 when the equation of the second degree has today three things to apicer was 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.990
 complete in this example was incomplete time of santiago I knew 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.790
 should 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:42.590
 story 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.520
 men are lacking and coercion 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.590
 Do you know him? 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.000
 how do we solve an equation 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.210
 incomplete 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.460
 Missing thing in thesis 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.340
 we get square 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.870
 and let's turn x 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:00.780
 times this 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.850
 You do not need to put the number one because the number 1 henry 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.230
 multiplication need not place such 

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:12.029
 xix squared is the same thing they sometimes because sport 2 

00:02:12.029 --> 00:02:15.709
 it means that it now multiplies by itself twice 

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:20.309
 4th times they 

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:22.389
 like cell 

00:02:22.389 --> 00:02:25.389
 solve the second situation and completed we have 

00:02:26.029 --> 00:02:32.459
 note that on the left side of the - sign I have an x ​​appearing two 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:33.399
 times 

00:02:33.399 --> 00:02:37.029
 on the right side and the tmx appears once in the vain put in evidence 

00:02:38.139 --> 00:02:41.469
 what puts it in evidence will take this impasse the letter x 

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:44.769
 that she was on the side of here 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:47.769
 and she's on the side of here and she's going 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:53.870
 cancel it this is if it will take her that appears twice and put here 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.109
 only once 

00:02:56.109 --> 00:03:01.939
 then it is to demand will assume that xis will disappear and these two things says 

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:05.069
 will merge into a single letter x 

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:09.729
 as well however in 'two-letter' pieces and turns into a single 

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:13.979
 letter x if you will cancel your owners left over here 

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:16.399
 xix 

00:03:16.399 --> 00:03:18.109
 - 4 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:21.109
 equal to zero I observed here 

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:25.329
 equation up here at the top of the trio with a letter x 'two letters' x 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:26.579
 3 bahia 2 x 

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:31.519
 and here in the lower part has 'two letters' history put in evidence if you 

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:32.519
 take a color 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:36.889
 letter the wall that is in common of what seems in evidence 

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:40.009
 and he puts it repeat once 

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:43.009
 transforming a subtraction into this product 

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:45.179
 how I will solve 

00:03:45.179 --> 00:03:49.819
 a multiplication of xv zx-14 0 

00:03:50.369 --> 00:03:53.739
 howe this xis here will be zero 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:56.739
 which is an answer every time 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:03:59.230
 and the other you go 

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:00.960
 I tried cheese 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.749
 - 4 dangerous 

00:04:03.749 --> 00:04:07.519
 solve in this equation you will pay at least 14 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:10.109
 pass he jumped to the side 

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:12.589
 note that here are minus four 

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:17.349
 when passing by another side only new equality it will come out of minus four 

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:22.680
 which will change the signal but controlled - was controlled four more 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.289
 and ended equation 

00:04:24.289 --> 00:04:26.620
 Are you going to have two answers? 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.139
 whenever you have a second degree equation 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.590
 and this equation was incomplete 

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:38.990
 mix did not have something without being just had something decent papicú and ctp 

00:04:39.569 --> 00:04:44.490
 always and one of the answers will be equal to zero xix equal to zero 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:49.009
 will you allow to guard and beside the body stephen massocca 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:50.520
 until the next discharge
