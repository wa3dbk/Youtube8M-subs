00:00:00.659 --> 00:00:09.780
 News that a compact electric car that can be folded like a fan can be developed 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.920
 I told you ahead of time that it would be a big help in solving the parking problem in the city ​​center. 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:15.690
 I'm looking forward to it 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:17.550
 Find out more Keith Joe Astonishing Graduate School of Green Transportation 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.480
 I'll see. 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:25.950
 Yes Nice Hello Why was the first year 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:28.200
 I can not easily think that this car is folded. 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:32.669
 Did you develop 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:34.800
 Our green traffic graduate had or would like to have a vehicle technology for its future transportation system 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:38.130
 I'm doing a lot of research. 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:43.530
 Is not this the word juchanan the city quite seriously 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:49.020
 And itguyo system is being deployed now to share vehicles with alternative unfair 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:53.610
 Also, it is said that the traffic is weak, 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:59.520
 Is Datong its system is important to emphasize that for the relay control excitement 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:04.559
 Uh Is there a way to solve these problems, so work some control vehicle 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:09.329
 So how do you reduce your car space and always have a car close by 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:14.100
 I thought about the concept of folding from that idea. 

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:18.539
 And while I was studying the concept of the mingling, 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:20.159
 There can shape the iron to the dealer you think is best for this yesterday 

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:25.020
 We developed the vehicle 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:28.679
 Yes, I see . I see the screen. The size of the car is very small. 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.420
 I wonder what the size of the comparison is and what features I have 

00:01:28.679 --> 00:01:30.830
 I'd like some explanation. 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.540
 4 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:43.190
 Yes. We named it Amazeloti , which we developed . 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:44.750
 Hey cars than compact cars that Toho when the state actually popped a small word folded in 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:49.640
 It will be smaller 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:55.760
 4, and this car is reflected in the blue sky. 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:56.900
 A small swim car is a category of any car that is smaller than a light car or 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.930
 Category 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:05.960
 So we can see that the car we developed 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:06.950
 When folded, it becomes 1.65m, and it is possible to park three cars on one side of parking lot 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:12.709
 I have. 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:19.190
 The amount of the car was 100 yesterday. The weight was less than 507 yesterday. 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:20.240
 This standard look of the word Europe is the law for the second compact car in Europe 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:24.620
 there is 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:30.920
 Hey these laws are limited to those 500t Royas 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:33.470
 Luso introduced this concept of law into Korea, 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:39.080
 I could do that. 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:44.840
 This car is a human trainee and it can communicate with a blood donor 

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:46.670
 It is possible to fold the car by using the it function 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:52.040
 I'd say it's a special offer . 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:53.540
 That was also the engine mounted on the inside of the wheel and I heard what advantages this also 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:03:00.049
 Yes Yes 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:03:04.939
 The difference between the statue the space for an engine room in the engine generating the cabbages in front eocha 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:12.950
 Is not that why I'm startin today it is the turn cars look kinder 

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:14.480
 Uh, we are qualified to take advantage of the space to get close to the riding 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:18.579
 Mounting 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:23.269
 I can not do one of the three things that we have applied to go so far 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:24.469
 You want to maximize your indoor space 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:29.720
 It's possible. 

00:03:24.469 --> 00:03:34.609
 It is also possible to design such that the air resistance can be made into vegetable, 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:35.780
 Because it can be electronically controlled, it is possible to drive more safely 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:40.370
 I think 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:42.980
 Yes, you told me about safety, but because of its small size, it is easy to park 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:47.689
 It will be easy to move. 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:49.639
 But because it's really small, I think it's safe to do that. 

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:56.569
 Let me give you a more detailed explanation. 

00:03:49.639 --> 00:03:57.979
 4 If you think this car runs on the highway, it will be a problem. 

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:04.400
 The intent is 

00:03:57.979 --> 00:04:05.989
 Air near or push Messe walking across the bridge in a limited scope boe 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:10.010
 Because I'm thinking 

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:14.690
 So now I 'm taking the category of chopsticks. 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:20.659
 There should also be a number of safeguards that are backed up 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:26.150
 But the maximum speed is 62 and the speed is usually 30 mph 

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:27.740
 , So when we talk about the same collision , 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:32.300
 I can easily explain 

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:37.400
 So the kinetic energy is 100 kph per hour, 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:43.370
 It is about one-quarter of that because it is proportional to the square of the empire's speed 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:45.889
 So compared to the vehicle control is to control the compact category up in such a case one 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:50.840
 I think there is no problem with the amount of 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:52.099
 Yeah, I heard that the picture quality is especially for the elderly, 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:57.289
 That's it. 

00:04:52.099 --> 00:05:03.039
 We are developing the second, basically the future for that transportation weak 

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:08.510
 The purpose was to develop a vehicle to transport systems is that the amount of the outer angle eocha 

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:11.480
 I was just a little bit far away from you, 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:18.380
 When moving cities and cities 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:23.870
 You can use public transportation and its passenger car at the same time , 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:28.370
 Avoid such situations that you have to use, 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:34.340
 In the same case or when transiting or visiting the area 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:39.650
 For those parts, you can easily access the second level from the language building corner. 

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:40.970
 By deploying, you can overcome any limitations of public transit, 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:45.110
 Successor to the car 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:46.100
 If the receptor is much more self- limiting, 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:50.330
 I think 

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:52.910
 Yes, I do. I think it's a breakthrough technology. 

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:59.720
 What kind of course do you think is right? 

00:05:52.910 --> 00:06:01.760
 For now, accept the concept of business support to all its current car of Land, Transport and Maritime Affairs 

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:04.780
 After more than a suggestion that relations 

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:10.150
 There are more forward 

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:14.819
 Going through the necessary confidence in the actual commercialization and durable addition to these conductive parts 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:17.800
 Zest need more technology developed another variety of amenities for sex movies 

00:06:14.819 --> 00:06:24.250
 I need it with such a facility that has performance in mind. 

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:28.030
 Another part of its response to one side or another relevant technical standards for the regulation yesterday 

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:30.159
 The transfer is necessary for example, define you for doing so can meet as soon as possible 

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:34.930
 I'll be good. 

00:06:30.159 --> 00:06:35.979
 Magician Revised KAIST with Acquired Professor at the ultra-compact electric vehicle 

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:40.199
 You know about 

00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:40.199
 Today more I say thank you 4 nights
