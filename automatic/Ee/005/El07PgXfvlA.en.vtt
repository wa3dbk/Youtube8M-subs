00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
has been one of the things that a lot of

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.730 
has been one of the things that a lot of
people<00:01:52.450> have<00:01:52.810> been<00:01:52.840> asking<00:01:53.020> for<00:01:53.470> for<00:01:53.500> a<00:01:53.710> very

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:53.740 
people have been asking for for a very

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.580 
people have been asking for for a very
long<00:01:54.250> time<00:01:54.310> and<00:01:54.760> this<00:01:55.630> guy<00:01:55.930> just<00:01:55.960> boggles<00:01:56.500> my

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
long time and this guy just boggles my

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.140 
long time and this guy just boggles my
mind<00:01:56.619> because<00:01:57.460> this<00:01:57.880> really<00:01:58.810> opens<00:01:58.960> up<00:01:59.229> the

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.150 
mind because this really opens up the

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:04.560 
mind because this really opens up the
availability<00:02:01.150> for<00:02:01.390> building<00:02:02.049> I<00:02:02.860> mean<00:02:03.790> usually

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:04.570 
availability for building I mean usually

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.420 
availability for building I mean usually
you<00:02:05.200> would<00:02:05.440> place<00:02:05.680> it<00:02:05.710> would<00:02:06.070> go<00:02:06.159> like<00:02:06.190> that

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
you would place it would go like that

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:07.830 
you would place it would go like that
and<00:02:06.640> then<00:02:06.820> you<00:02:06.909> have<00:02:07.090> down<00:02:07.270> though<00:02:07.420> make<00:02:07.659> some

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:07.840
