00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:52.549 
so back to the triumph rockets

00:02:52.549 --> 00:02:59.010 
so back to the triumph rockets
beautiful<00:02:54.109> see<00:02:55.109> this<00:02:55.980> is<00:02:56.189> a<00:02:56.219> beast

00:02:59.010 --> 00:02:59.020 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.590 

I<00:02:59.050> could<00:02:59.860> I<00:03:00.040> could<00:03:00.130> write<00:03:00.970> this<00:03:01.150> all<00:03:01.390> day<00:03:01.570> I

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
I could I could write this all day I

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.200 
I could I could write this all day I
think<00:03:01.960> very<00:03:02.500> rugged<00:03:03.130> probable<00:03:03.790> for<00:03:03.940> that<00:03:04.060> heat

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:04.210 
think very rugged probable for that heat

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:06.360 
think very rugged probable for that heat
week<00:03:04.390> I<00:03:04.690> can<00:03:05.110> do<00:03:05.200> an<00:03:05.260> endurance<00:03:05.770> test<00:03:05.920> on<00:03:06.340> a
