 hello everyone I'm elias 360 and I bring you 

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:07.120
 this new video and this time gameplay 

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:08.800
 commented on minecraft this time 

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.960
 we bring a life comment as usual 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:13.179
 be habitual with this title on the channel 

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:14.769
 and this is why it is good to be 

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:17.109
 it must to that I'm having as it is 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:18.880
 usual I'm also having a 

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:20.499
 lot of problems to be able to record in 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.980
 computer and tried all the 

00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:25.929
 created programs and by creating proven 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.579
 story and action even envy 

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:29.259
 shadowplay that you already know is a program 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:32.200
 that comes integrated in the cards 

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:34.270
 graphics a montonazo fraps etcetera 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.860
 I've actually tried like about six or 

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.650
 seven recording programs is not kidding 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.600
 and apparently everyone gives me some kind of 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.490
 problem that happens with the story of 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.260
 lapse for example then good to leave 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:46.630
 very large files that is not the 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:48.730
 problem but I do have a problem and 

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:50.830
 is that by putting them in sony vegas then 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.600
 it seems to me class sometimes I get tired of the 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:54.910
 audio sometimes I kind of video in 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.530
 this occasion, what has been 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.989
 problem as it has been the part of the audio 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.880
 so what I've done is suppress it and 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:03.670
 put a little one of those beautiful girls that 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.710
 you like background in another occasion then 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.720
 well I recorded another video that had it 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.180
 prepared for another 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.130
 for another day forgiveness and others and what has 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.410
 created is the video as such the image 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.080
 so video to take for ass but 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:17.760
 well I guess I'll try or 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.530
 I will solve it, I will wait for 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.000
 computer that I imagine will be falling 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.040
 and I will make a video also talking about 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.990
 computer so you know which card 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.390
 graphic use that the monitor use that 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.400
 butter use to put it together in order to 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.690
 all not but well let's talk about what 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.450
 that interests us first of all 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.760
 also say sorry you're going to have 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.410
 in the description a channel that is not mine 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.630
 as such but if I'm going up 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:41.729
 videos, I'm uploading videos to 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:45.330
 og series channel I'm going up in 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:46.860
 concrete three per week is worth and all 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.540
 they're minecraft's worth so good is 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.610
 a channel in which you mostly go 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.520
 to have gerson if not if I'm not wrong 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.800
 I do not upload that part so to speak it is 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.810
 most competitive management but 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.520
 On the other hand you also have my three 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.540
 weekly minecraft videos so 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.820
 well I'll leave it in the description 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.080
 for anyone who wants to subscribe and if not 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:06.630
 Well, I guess I'll be putting 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.640
 all the videos on twitter or what 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.769
 make it so that nothing aside 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.500
 you will also have the ip as always 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:14.970
 from the server of moreland and we're going to 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.310
 mess because as you will be watching me 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.709
 I imagine that somehow there will be 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.810
 reflected in the title and that is going to 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.640
 have an event after good then 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.890
 almost a month of pause the last event 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.420
 It was in Granada and you know that this is something 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.160
 quite weird of mine because I always go 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.019
 of event events I'm always 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.489
 traveling but good for certain 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:33.989
 reasons among others because you already know that 

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:36.510
 he was sick and so on and could not travel 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:38.280
 obviously there has been a small 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.430
 pause have also been the whole subject of 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:44.310
 Christmas and New Year's Eve etc. so 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.769
 Well the event is going to be on the 31st 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.540
 January is saying this same Saturday inside 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:50.610
 of 6 days you will see this 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.799
 Monday or I hope you are seeing it on 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.019
 Monday because it is that if I do not already charge 

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:56.670
 all the time but let's see 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:59.459
 let's pray we're not going to do a little prayer 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:01.980
 for my connection and see if to see if not 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:04.380
 goes too much for ass or more than usual 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.930
 but good on January 31 is to say this 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.519
 same Saturday as I said right will be the 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.350
 event is worth the event will be minecraft 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:12.570
 there will also be hairston though that to me 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:14.010
 It does not concern me as such but good 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.540
 I will be to play minecraft with 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.110
 you to games of hunger 'in 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.850
 concrete we will play in 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.800
 the mora land server you already know is 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:23.200
 a server that was later 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.840
 maps will add the minigames but 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.910
 at the moment we are focusing on the 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.590
 hungry to see that everything goes well and 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.200
 then when everything is optimized and 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.880
 everything perfected because we will include more 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.920
 good stuff so I'll be playing 

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:38.620
 that same minecraft games of hunger in 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.030
 concrete, well, I'm telling you, you can 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.250
 go to the event even if you do not like the 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.750
 minecraft if you like gerson you like them 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:45.040
 the car simulators that the truth 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.050
 is that they have simulators that are 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.880
 pretty handsome they take them to all 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:51.490
 events I have tried them and good for 

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:53.350
 all the people who like the subject of 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:54.880
 cars and driving as is my case 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:56.709
 Well, the truth is that it is quite 

00:03:54.880 --> 00:04:00.340
 cool to try and I tell you is a 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:01.750
 event that always is 99% of the 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.180
 events that I am announcing on the channel 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:06.640
 they are free, so it costs zero 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:09.160
 euros there is no age limit there is no 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.560
 minimum age neither forgiveness does not 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.790
 you need to come accompanied by 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:14.709
 accompanied forgiveness by our parents 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.239
 for your legal guardians or anything for 

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:18.730
 the style is worth I mean it is an event 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:20.620
 totally normal is usually done in 

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:22.720
 shopping centers on this occasion 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:26.440
 going to do in the shopping center plaza 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.940
 Brancato is in Madrid, I'm not worth 

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.770
 never visited this mall 

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:32.080
 but I do know that it's on the avenue 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.520
 pablo iglesias en fuenlabrada vale de 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:36.400
 I will also leave you a link 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:38.350
 so you know how to get there, it's worth it 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.270
 which will give you the indications of 

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:42.550
 how to get to the event downtown 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:44.440
 commercial specifically and good to tell you 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:47.530
 that the event will be as well as I said 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:49.660
 31 on Saturday and will be from 11 

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:52.090
 the morning until 8 o'clock in the afternoon with a 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:54.580
 rest to eat evidently that 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:57.040
 many times some people come and 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:05:00.070
 they tell me I went to three and you were not 

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:02.290
 in the event playing and it's because I was 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:04.120
 eating not so good that you know that 

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:05.560
 there is a small break to eat me 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:07.690
 I guess I'll put it anyway 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:10.360
 on twitter so nothing to throw a 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:12.430
 look at the description if not os 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.930
 it matters because you're going to have several 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.630
 links not what I told you about the channel 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:18.340
 how the event will come and I imagine that 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:20.650
 I will also leave it written so that 

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:22.060
 you know the schedules so I do not expect anything 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:24.220
 that you liked already you know lake and 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:26.620
 favorites we'll see you on Saturday in madrid 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:28.510
 and with nothing more to say he says goodbye 

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:31.230
 elías 360 

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:31.230
 until next time
