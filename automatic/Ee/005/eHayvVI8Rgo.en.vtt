00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.910 
Tomi had to separate from his group and
chase<00:01:54.540> after<00:01:54.869> you<00:01:55.110> knives<00:01:55.259> of<00:01:55.439> me<00:01:55.530> because<00:01:55.890> you

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
chase after you knives of me because you

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.590 
chase after you knives of me because you
might<00:01:56.189> assume<00:01:56.340> he's<00:01:56.549> going<00:01:56.759> way<00:01:56.880> too<00:01:56.939> fast<00:01:57.270> and

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
might assume he's going way too fast and

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.240 
might assume he's going way too fast and
he<00:01:57.930> most<00:01:58.110> likely<00:01:58.259> is<00:01:58.469> gonna<00:01:58.530> pass<00:01:58.829> the<00:01:59.009> finish

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
he most likely is gonna pass the finish

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.219 
he most likely is gonna pass the finish
line<00:01:59.399> since<00:01:59.790> he<00:02:00.270> can<00:02:00.450> push<00:02:00.659> herself<00:02:00.810> across

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
line since he can push herself across

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.459 
line since he can push herself across
that<00:02:01.530> distance<00:02:01.740> so<00:02:02.689> buku<00:02:03.689> Tomi<00:02:04.049> is<00:02:04.079> pretty

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
that distance so buku Tomi is pretty

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:05.990 
that distance so buku Tomi is pretty
much<00:02:04.649> getting<00:02:04.920> destroyed<00:02:05.280> right<00:02:05.520> now<00:02:05.640> because

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
much getting destroyed right now because

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.419 
much getting destroyed right now because
he<00:02:06.630> is<00:02:06.659> actually<00:02:07.350> weakening<00:02:07.890> his<00:02:08.039> self<00:02:08.280> by

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
he is actually weakening his self by

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:09.949 
he is actually weakening his self by
pushing<00:02:08.819> herself<00:02:08.940> that<00:02:09.270> lunch<00:02:09.509> because<00:02:09.720> we

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
pushing herself that lunch because we

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.330 
pushing herself that lunch because we
know<00:02:10.140> he's<00:02:10.349> already<00:02:10.500> pushed<00:02:10.739> herself<00:02:10.890> quite<00:02:11.310> a

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
know he's already pushed herself quite a

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.400 
know he's already pushed herself quite a
bit<00:02:11.670> from<00:02:12.060> the<00:02:12.270> previous<00:02:12.690> day
