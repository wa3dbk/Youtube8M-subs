guns were shooting down on me all right
now<00:04:41.260> here's<00:04:41.710> the<00:04:41.920> part<00:04:41.950> I<00:04:42.190> was<00:04:42.280> talking<00:04:42.670> about

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
now here's the part I was talking about

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:57.710 
now here's the part I was talking about
without<00:04:44.080> consuming<00:04:44.380> that<00:04:44.650> guy

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.900 

okay<00:04:58.350> so<00:04:58.410> this<00:04:58.650> guy<00:04:58.860> calls<00:04:59.130> it<00:04:59.340> a<00:04:59.430> strike<00:04:59.490> team

00:04:59.900 --> 00:04:59.910 
okay so this guy calls it a strike team

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:02.540 
okay so this guy calls it a strike team
and<00:05:00.120> everything<00:05:01.100> seems<00:05:02.100> a<00:05:02.250> little<00:05:02.400> bit

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:02.550 
and everything seems a little bit

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:05.330 
and everything seems a little bit
overwhelming<00:05:03.240> but<00:05:03.390> it's<00:05:03.960> not<00:05:04.200> just<00:05:04.740> there's<00:05:05.280> a

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340 
overwhelming but it's not just there's a

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:07.430 
overwhelming but it's not just there's a
little<00:05:05.610> arrow<00:05:05.880> and<00:05:06.390> you<00:05:07.020> just<00:05:07.110> want<00:05:07.290> to<00:05:07.320> go

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 
little arrow and you just want to go

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:08.870 
little arrow and you just want to go
over<00:05:07.500> to<00:05:07.590> that<00:05:07.680> guy<00:05:07.920> and<00:05:08.100> consume<00:05:08.430> him<00:05:08.640> which

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:08.880 
over to that guy and consume him which

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.880 
over to that guy and consume him which
again<00:05:09.150> is<00:05:09.210> by<00:05:09.420> pressing<00:05:09.780> V<00:05:09.990> and<00:05:10.320> then

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:10.890 
again is by pressing V and then

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:14.630 
again is by pressing V and then
consuming<00:05:11.700> with<00:05:11.820> why<00:05:13.400> just<00:05:14.400> ignore

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:14.640 
consuming with why just ignore

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.700 
consuming with why just ignore
everything<00:05:15.090> else<00:05:15.420> because<00:05:16.110> it's<00:05:16.500> going<00:05:16.650> to

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:16.710 
everything else because it's going to

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:17.960 
everything else because it's going to
take<00:05:16.830> too<00:05:16.980> much<00:05:17.100> power<00:05:17.400> to<00:05:17.460> take<00:05:17.670> those<00:05:17.790> guys

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:17.970 
take too much power to take those guys

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:21.770
