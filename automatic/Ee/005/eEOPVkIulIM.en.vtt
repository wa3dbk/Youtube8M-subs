00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.990 
human eye it mimics what should have
been<00:02:27.000> here<00:02:27.420> all<00:02:27.690> along<00:02:28.310> in<00:02:29.310> this<00:02:29.549> particular

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
been here all along in this particular

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.319 
been here all along in this particular
case<00:02:30.480> the<00:02:30.870> logs<00:02:31.049> in<00:02:31.560> the<00:02:31.680> stream<00:02:31.920> will<00:02:32.099> be<00:02:32.329> able

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:33.329 
case the logs in the stream will be able

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:35.990 
case the logs in the stream will be able
to<00:02:33.629> trap<00:02:34.019> the<00:02:34.200> gravel<00:02:34.650> that<00:02:35.250> the<00:02:35.400> fish<00:02:35.610> need<00:02:35.849> to

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
to trap the gravel that the fish need to

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.270 
to trap the gravel that the fish need to
spawn<00:02:36.590> it<00:02:37.590> also<00:02:37.739> trapped<00:02:38.160> leaf<00:02:38.640> litter<00:02:39.260> that

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
spawn it also trapped leaf litter that

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.240 
spawn it also trapped leaf litter that
then<00:02:41.280> becomes<00:02:41.700> the<00:02:41.910> base<00:02:42.120> of<00:02:42.329> the<00:02:42.420> food<00:02:42.629> chain

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
then becomes the base of the food chain

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.949 
then becomes the base of the food chain
right<00:02:44.250> the<00:02:44.459> bugs<00:02:44.700> eat<00:02:44.970> the<00:02:45.180> leaves<00:02:45.420> and<00:02:45.840> then

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
right the bugs eat the leaves and then

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:49.729 
right the bugs eat the leaves and then
fish<00:02:46.440> eat<00:02:46.620> the<00:02:46.769> bugs<00:02:47.599> this<00:02:48.599> it<00:02:49.109> restores<00:02:49.650> the

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
fish eat the bugs this it restores the

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:53.210 
fish eat the bugs this it restores the
stream<00:02:50.190> and<00:02:50.660> so<00:02:51.660> everything<00:02:52.530> that<00:02:52.859> has

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
stream and so everything that has

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.129 
stream and so everything that has
evolved<00:02:53.940> with<00:02:54.090> the<00:02:54.150> stream<00:02:54.599> in<00:02:54.930> these

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:55.139 
evolved with the stream in these

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:58.879 
evolved with the stream in these
conditions<00:02:56.720> has<00:02:57.720> evolved<00:02:58.230> with<00:02:58.380> wood<00:02:58.590> in<00:02:58.769> the

00:02:58.879 --> 00:02:58.889 
conditions has evolved with wood in the

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:01.699 
conditions has evolved with wood in the
streams<00:02:59.220> as<00:02:59.400> well<00:02:59.840> right<00:03:00.840> so<00:03:00.870> it's<00:03:01.290> part<00:03:01.560> of

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
streams as well right so it's part of

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:05.180 
streams as well right so it's part of
the<00:03:01.829> whole<00:03:02.040> ecosystem<00:03:03.560> to<00:03:04.560> have<00:03:04.709> wood<00:03:04.980> in<00:03:05.010> the

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
the whole ecosystem to have wood in the

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.789 
the whole ecosystem to have wood in the
streams<00:03:05.489> and<00:03:06.230> probably<00:03:07.230> there's<00:03:07.440> a<00:03:07.530> lot<00:03:07.680> of

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:07.799 
streams and probably there's a lot of

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:09.289 
streams and probably there's a lot of
reasons<00:03:08.130> that<00:03:08.220> we<00:03:08.370> don't<00:03:08.609> even<00:03:08.700> understand

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
reasons that we don't even understand

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:11.720 
reasons that we don't even understand
why<00:03:10.230> it's<00:03:10.410> important<00:03:10.889> for<00:03:11.040> it<00:03:11.280> to<00:03:11.340> be<00:03:11.430> that<00:03:11.549> way

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
why it's important for it to be that way

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.900 
why it's important for it to be that way
but<00:03:11.910> that's<00:03:12.239> the<00:03:12.419> way<00:03:12.510> it<00:03:12.780> is<00:03:13.130> naturally<00:03:14.130> and

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
but that's the way it is naturally and

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.670 
but that's the way it is naturally and
so<00:03:15.180> that's<00:03:15.450> the<00:03:15.780> way<00:03:15.930> we're<00:03:16.200> trying<00:03:16.319> to<00:03:16.530> make

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
so that's the way we're trying to make

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.319 
so that's the way we're trying to make
it<00:03:16.799> again<00:03:19.400> with<00:03:20.400> the<00:03:20.489> help<00:03:20.700> of<00:03:20.760> a<00:03:20.880> nearby<00:03:21.090> high

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
it again with the help of a nearby high

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:23.270 
it again with the help of a nearby high
school<00:03:21.650> hydrologist<00:03:22.650> will<00:03:22.829> monitor<00:03:23.160> the

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
school hydrologist will monitor the

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.650 
school hydrologist will monitor the
creeks<00:03:23.519> changes<00:03:23.970> over<00:03:24.209> the<00:03:24.299> next<00:03:24.450> several

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
creeks changes over the next several

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.520 
creeks changes over the next several
years<00:03:24.810> the<00:03:26.840> students<00:03:27.840> are<00:03:27.959> measuring<00:03:28.260> stream

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
years the students are measuring stream

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.920 
years the students are measuring stream
with<00:03:28.760> recording<00:03:29.760> location<00:03:30.239> and<00:03:30.480> a<00:03:30.540> number<00:03:30.810> of

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
with recording location and a number of

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.500 
with recording location and a number of
pools<00:03:31.290> and<00:03:31.530> riffles<00:03:31.700> by<00:03:32.700> using<00:03:32.849> photo<00:03:33.180> points

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
pools and riffles by using photo points

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.750 
pools and riffles by using photo points
to<00:03:33.660> track<00:03:33.870> the<00:03:34.019> changes<00:03:36.950> we're<00:03:37.950> hoping<00:03:38.340> to<00:03:38.400> see

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
to track the changes we're hoping to see

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.180 
to track the changes we're hoping to see
a<00:03:38.790> lot<00:03:39.269> more<00:03:39.510> gravel<00:03:40.200> throughout<00:03:40.739> this<00:03:40.950> whole

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
a lot more gravel throughout this whole

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:42.050 
a lot more gravel throughout this whole
reach

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
reach

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.520 
reach
and<00:03:42.180> a<00:03:42.630> lot<00:03:42.810> more<00:03:42.840> pools<00:03:43.590> and<00:03:45.170> so<00:03:46.170> spawning

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:46.530 
and a lot more pools and so spawning

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.510 
and a lot more pools and so spawning
gravel<00:03:47.070> areas<00:03:47.520> and<00:03:48.030> pools<00:03:48.480> and<00:03:49.370> though<00:03:50.370> we'll

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:50.520 
gravel areas and pools and though we'll

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.040 
gravel areas and pools and though we'll
see<00:03:50.730> you<00:03:50.790> in<00:03:50.880> five<00:03:50.970> years<00:03:51.180> hopefully<00:03:51.870> we'll

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 
see you in five years hopefully we'll

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:53.920 
see you in five years hopefully we'll
see<00:03:52.230> hundreds<00:03:52.620> of<00:03:52.770> steelhead<00:03:53.190> spawning

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
see hundreds of steelhead spawning

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.260 
see hundreds of steelhead spawning
that'd<00:03:54.930> be<00:03:55.080> cool
