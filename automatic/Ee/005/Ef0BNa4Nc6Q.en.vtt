00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
this is the nav computer and that's the

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.539 
this is the nav computer and that's the
arm<00:01:17.070> LED<00:01:17.630> and<00:01:18.630> we<00:01:18.720> get<00:01:18.840> two<00:01:19.020> flashes<00:01:19.560> three

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
arm LED and we get two flashes three

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:26.090 
arm LED and we get two flashes three
flashes<00:01:21.000> even<00:01:21.259> and<00:01:22.259> it<00:01:22.619> stays<00:01:22.860> on<00:01:23.840> and<00:01:25.009> then<00:01:26.009> it

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
flashes even and it stays on and then it

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.120 
flashes even and it stays on and then it
goes<00:01:26.220> off<00:01:26.430> again<00:01:27.619> with<00:01:28.619> another<00:01:28.710> three

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
goes off again with another three

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.410 
goes off again with another three
flashes

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.120 

and<00:01:33.420> I<00:01:33.509> think<00:01:33.750> that<00:01:33.899> corresponds<00:01:34.619> directly<00:01:34.770> to

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
and I think that corresponds directly to

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.209 
and I think that corresponds directly to
the<00:01:35.700> northern<00:01:36.090> side<00:01:36.710> which<00:01:37.710> means<00:01:37.890> me<00:01:38.100> to

00:01:38.209 --> 00:01:38.219 
the northern side which means me to

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:41.300 
the northern side which means me to
believe<00:01:38.369> that<00:01:39.000> it<00:01:39.149> is<00:01:39.179> now<00:01:39.539> computer<00:01:40.159> if<00:01:41.159> I

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
believe that it is now computer if I

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.730 
believe that it is now computer if I
insert<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:42.689> CD<00:01:43.140> you<00:01:45.259> can<00:01:46.259> hear<00:01:46.439> it<00:01:46.560> constantly

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
insert the CD you can hear it constantly

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.399 
insert the CD you can hear it constantly
turning<00:01:47.399> on<00:01:47.520> and<00:01:47.759> off<00:01:47.850> rereading<00:01:48.719> the<00:01:48.929> CD<00:01:49.170> all

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
turning on and off rereading the CD all

00:01:49.409 --> 00:02:00.929 
turning on and off rereading the CD all
the<00:01:49.560> time

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:00.939 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:04.140 

over<00:02:01.689> and<00:02:01.840> over<00:02:01.930> again
