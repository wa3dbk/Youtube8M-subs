00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
there and actually he was the winner

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.709 
there and actually he was the winner
he's<00:00:28.590> a<00:00:28.650> big<00:00:29.160> boy<00:00:29.400> and<00:00:31.880> was<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.090> was<00:00:33.390> really

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
he's a big boy and was the was really

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.569 
he's a big boy and was the was really
the<00:00:33.870> the<00:00:34.110> only<00:00:34.380> one<00:00:34.530> that<00:00:34.710> could<00:00:34.860> come<00:00:35.100> in<00:00:35.219> and

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
the the only one that could come in and

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.840 
the the only one that could come in and
do<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.450> course<00:00:36.719> in<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.050> test<00:00:37.520> you<00:00:38.520> know<00:00:38.640> maybe

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
do the course in the test you know maybe

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.700 
do the course in the test you know maybe
he<00:00:39.090> could<00:00:39.270> be<00:00:39.360> a<00:00:39.390> little<00:00:39.540> more<00:00:39.780> stylish<00:00:40.379> and<00:00:40.590> I

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
he could be a little more stylish and I

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.440 
he could be a little more stylish and I
think<00:00:41.070> that's<00:00:41.250> coming<00:00:41.610> even<00:00:41.790> since<00:00:42.030> we<00:00:42.180> judged

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
think that's coming even since we judged

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.569 
think that's coming even since we judged
him<00:00:42.629> back<00:00:42.780> in<00:00:42.989> March<00:00:43.230> he's<00:00:43.829> gotten<00:00:44.160> so<00:00:44.370> much

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
him back in March he's gotten so much

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:53.510 
him back in March he's gotten so much
better<00:00:50.780> and<00:00:51.780> I<00:00:51.930> think<00:00:52.469> this<00:00:52.620> boy<00:00:52.800> is<00:00:52.980> a<00:00:53.010> has<00:00:53.489> a

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
better and I think this boy is a has a

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.450 
better and I think this boy is a has a
natural<00:00:54.059> feel<00:00:54.500> you<00:00:55.500> know<00:00:55.590> for<00:00:55.829> sure<00:00:55.860> he's<00:00:56.190> he's

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
natural feel you know for sure he's he's

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.520 
natural feel you know for sure he's he's
probably<00:00:56.699> up<00:00:57.090> maybe<00:00:57.360> a<00:00:57.449> little<00:00:57.719> a<00:00:58.020> big<00:00:58.230> for<00:00:58.440> the

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
probably up maybe a little a big for the

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:59.779 
probably up maybe a little a big for the
equitation<00:00:58.949> so<00:00:59.309> it's<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.520> little<00:00:59.670> more

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
equitation so it's a little more

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.760 
equitation so it's a little more
difficult<00:01:00.329> for<00:01:00.359> him<00:01:00.600> but<00:01:00.750> he<00:01:00.870> he<00:01:01.410> definitely

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
difficult for him but he he definitely

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.870 
difficult for him but he he definitely
has<00:01:01.890> a<00:01:01.920> nice<00:01:02.100> feel<00:01:03.979> looks<00:01:04.979> very<00:01:05.220> natural<00:01:05.460> up

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
has a nice feel looks very natural up

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.330 
has a nice feel looks very natural up
there<00:01:08.990> nothing<00:01:09.990> looks<00:01:10.200> forced<00:01:10.650> he<00:01:10.830> looks<00:01:11.010> soft

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
there nothing looks forced he looks soft

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.130 
there nothing looks forced he looks soft
with<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.670> horse<00:01:14.270> he's<00:01:15.270> riding<00:01:15.659> great<00:01:15.869> I<00:01:16.080> mean

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
with the horse he's riding great I mean

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.010 
with the horse he's riding great I mean
I<00:01:16.850> think<00:01:17.850> everything<00:01:18.299> he's<00:01:18.420> done<00:01:18.600> has<00:01:18.659> looked

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
I think everything he's done has looked

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.450 
I think everything he's done has looked
really<00:01:19.680> nice

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.010 

he<00:01:23.460> just<00:01:23.610> kind<00:01:23.820> of<00:01:23.880> melted<00:01:24.360> into<00:01:24.540> that<00:01:24.780> too

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
he just kind of melted into that too

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.020 
he just kind of melted into that too
that<00:01:25.229> was<00:01:25.409> nice<00:01:25.619> you<00:01:25.979> know<00:01:26.340> that<00:01:26.490> was<00:01:26.610> nice<00:01:26.790> he

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
that was nice you know that was nice he

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.550 
that was nice you know that was nice he
was<00:01:27.360> late<00:01:27.600> getting<00:01:27.630> it<00:01:28.020> done<00:01:28.170> which<00:01:28.380> i<00:01:28.500> think

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
was late getting it done which i think

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.109 
was late getting it done which i think
was<00:01:28.860> right<00:01:29.100> because<00:01:29.340> as<00:01:29.520> you<00:01:29.759> said<00:01:29.970> he

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
was right because as you said he

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.179 
was right because as you said he
basically<00:01:30.329> just<00:01:30.780> let<00:01:31.079> the<00:01:31.229> horse<00:01:31.350> melt<00:01:31.860> as<00:01:32.070> he

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
basically just let the horse melt as he

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.490 
basically just let the horse melt as he
got<00:01:32.369> there<00:01:32.610> this<00:01:33.240> horse<00:01:33.600> has<00:01:33.780> such<00:01:34.140> a<00:01:34.170> big

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.080 
got there this horse has such a big
stride<00:01:36.650> that<00:01:37.650> he<00:01:37.920> really<00:01:38.369> need<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.549> be<00:01:38.790> soft

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090
