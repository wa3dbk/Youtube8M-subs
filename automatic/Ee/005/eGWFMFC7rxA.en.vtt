00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:24.430 
and then if you could get a bunch of
road<00:02:23.150> to<00:02:23.300> the<00:02:23.390> pullout<00:02:23.660> players<00:02:23.930> so<00:02:24.200> we<00:02:24.230> could

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
road to the pullout players so we could

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.960 
road to the pullout players so we could
try<00:02:24.680> completing<00:02:25.190> these<00:02:25.310> but<00:02:25.670> they're<00:02:25.820> pretty

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
try completing these but they're pretty

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.270 
try completing these but they're pretty
hard<00:02:26.270> to<00:02:26.570> complete<00:02:26.960> because<00:02:27.920> there's<00:02:28.070> always

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:28.280 
hard to complete because there's always

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.910 
hard to complete because there's always
that<00:02:28.340> one<00:02:28.400> person<00:02:28.580> on<00:02:29.150> each<00:02:29.960> set<00:02:30.560> that<00:02:30.860> will

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:30.920 
that one person on each set that will

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.670 
that one person on each set that will
cost<00:02:31.130> like<00:02:31.400> over<00:02:31.700> 100k<00:02:32.210> and<00:02:32.590> you'll<00:02:33.590> probably

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
cost like over 100k and you'll probably

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:35.890 
cost like over 100k and you'll probably
also<00:02:33.920> get<00:02:34.520> a<00:02:34.550> few<00:02:34.850> captain<00:02:35.330> collectibles<00:02:35.780> as

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
also get a few captain collectibles as

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.600

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
you can see from the last video and

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.090 
you can see from the last video and
captain<00:02:38.090> sets<00:02:38.630> are<00:02:38.870> a<00:02:39.170> lot<00:02:39.740> easier<00:02:39.770> to

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.100 
captain sets are a lot easier to

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.440 
captain sets are a lot easier to
complete<00:02:40.370> so<00:02:40.610> you<00:02:40.700> should<00:02:40.850> try<00:02:41.000> completing
