let's get out all the goodies here now

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.330 
let's get out all the goodies here now
the<00:02:10.080> power<00:02:10.290> supply<00:02:10.500> goes<00:02:10.800> right<00:02:10.979> down<00:02:11.010> here<00:02:11.220> on

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
the power supply goes right down here on

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.310 
the power supply goes right down here on
the<00:02:11.370> bottom<00:02:11.460> that's<00:02:12.270> awesome<00:02:12.510> it<00:02:12.780> goes<00:02:13.110> right

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:13.320 
the bottom that's awesome it goes right

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.980 
the bottom that's awesome it goes right
there<00:02:13.910> that's<00:02:14.910> where<00:02:15.150> it<00:02:15.240> goes<00:02:15.330> sits<00:02:15.810> on<00:02:15.900> the

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
there that's where it goes sits on the

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.080 
there that's where it goes sits on the
bottom<00:02:16.320> it<00:02:16.920> makes<00:02:17.130> it<00:02:17.250> so<00:02:17.460> much<00:02:17.640> easier<00:02:17.700> to

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
bottom it makes it so much easier to

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.510 
bottom it makes it so much easier to
install<00:02:18.330> you<00:02:18.600> just<00:02:18.630> lay<00:02:18.930> it<00:02:19.080> there<00:02:19.110> and<00:02:19.530> I<00:02:19.560> can

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:20.520 
install you just lay it there and I can

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.310 
install you just lay it there and I can
accept<00:02:20.790> a<00:02:21.000> large<00:02:21.240> size<00:02:21.510> power<00:02:21.750> supply<00:02:22.110> because

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:22.320 
accept a large size power supply because

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.300 
accept a large size power supply because
as<00:02:22.530> you<00:02:22.650> can<00:02:22.680> see<00:02:22.800> if<00:02:23.040> there's<00:02:23.190> nothing

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
as you can see if there's nothing

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.610 
as you can see if there's nothing
obstructing<00:02:23.970> this<00:02:24.720> area<00:02:25.080> you<00:02:25.230> can<00:02:25.380> make<00:02:25.530> it

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
obstructing this area you can make it

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.230 
obstructing this area you can make it
this<00:02:25.740> big<00:02:25.800> or<00:02:26.070> whatever<00:02:26.340> motherboard<00:02:27.060> goes

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
this big or whatever motherboard goes

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.030 
this big or whatever motherboard goes
above<00:02:27.540> it<00:02:27.690> right<00:02:27.870> up<00:02:28.020> here<00:02:28.050> now<00:02:28.800> the<00:02:28.860> nice

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
above it right up here now the nice

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.770 
above it right up here now the nice
thing<00:02:29.070> about<00:02:29.250> that<00:02:29.520> is<00:02:29.580> the<00:02:29.910> heat<00:02:30.420> that<00:02:30.450> the

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
thing about that is the heat that the

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:31.970 
thing about that is the heat that the
power<00:02:30.960> supply<00:02:31.140> is<00:02:31.260> going<00:02:31.440> to<00:02:31.500> generate<00:02:31.680> is

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
power supply is going to generate is

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.110 
power supply is going to generate is
going<00:02:32.130> to<00:02:32.190> stay<00:02:32.340> down<00:02:32.370> here<00:02:32.490> on<00:02:32.730> the<00:02:32.760> bottom<00:02:32.820> of

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
going to stay down here on the bottom of

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.450 
going to stay down here on the bottom of
the<00:02:33.180> case<00:02:33.470> up<00:02:34.470> in<00:02:34.680> the<00:02:34.770> top<00:02:34.950> sometimes<00:02:35.190> the

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
the case up in the top sometimes the

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:37.310 
the case up in the top sometimes the
heats<00:02:35.640> and<00:02:35.850> you<00:02:36.150> know<00:02:36.240> it<00:02:36.510> just<00:02:36.780> makes<00:02:37.050> heating

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:37.320 
heats and you know it just makes heating

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.920 
heats and you know it just makes heating
issues<00:02:37.590> I<00:02:37.710> suppose<00:02:38.150> now<00:02:39.150> let's<00:02:39.690> look<00:02:39.840> over

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
issues I suppose now let's look over

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.270 
issues I suppose now let's look over
here<00:02:40.140> on<00:02:40.230> the<00:02:40.290> enzyme<00:02:40.530> move<00:02:40.710> all<00:02:40.830> these<00:02:40.920> cables

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
here on the enzyme move all these cables

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.200 
here on the enzyme move all these cables
out<00:02:41.310> of<00:02:41.400> the<00:02:41.460> way<00:02:41.520> all<00:02:41.670> the<00:02:41.760> front<00:02:42.000> panel

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 
out of the way all the front panel

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.930 
out of the way all the front panel
connectors<00:02:42.390> and<00:02:42.780> whatnot<00:02:43.820> you<00:02:44.820> have

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
connectors and whatnot you have

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.990 
connectors and whatnot you have
everything<00:02:45.240> from<00:02:45.360> USB<00:02:45.930> the<00:02:46.230> HD<00:02:46.560> audio<00:02:47.000> there's

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
everything from USB the HD audio there's

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.640 
everything from USB the HD audio there's
the<00:02:48.120> SATA<00:02:48.330> cable<00:02:48.720> but<00:02:49.290> the<00:02:49.350> one<00:02:49.410> thing<00:02:49.530> that's

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
the SATA cable but the one thing that's

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:53.540 
the SATA cable but the one thing that's
really<00:02:49.800> cool<00:02:49.920> about<00:02:50.070> this<00:02:50.630> case<00:02:51.630> is<00:02:52.340> all<00:02:53.340> the

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
really cool about this case is all the

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
really cool about this case is all the
different<00:02:53.820> expansion<00:02:54.180> options<00:02:54.330> you<00:02:54.540> have

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
different expansion options you have

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.870 
different expansion options you have
it's<00:02:55.140> not<00:02:55.320> a<00:02:55.380> giant<00:02:55.650> case<00:02:56.010> I<00:02:56.250> mean<00:02:56.460> it's<00:02:56.610> it's

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
it's not a giant case I mean it's it's

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.880 
it's not a giant case I mean it's it's
not<00:02:57.030> tiny<00:02:57.330> but<00:02:57.600> it's<00:02:57.720> not<00:02:57.840> giant<00:02:58.110> inside<00:02:58.740> there

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
not tiny but it's not giant inside there

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:00.320 
not tiny but it's not giant inside there
we<00:02:59.010> have<00:02:59.130> some<00:02:59.280> fans<00:02:59.550> and<00:02:59.820> they're<00:03:00.150> going<00:03:00.270> to

inch devices like all your hard drives
and<00:03:04.410> whatnot<00:03:04.680> now<00:03:05.220> we<00:03:05.280> can<00:03:05.580> install<00:03:05.610> these

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
and whatnot now we can install these

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.810 
and whatnot now we can install these
simply<00:03:06.390> these<00:03:06.840> come<00:03:07.050> off<00:03:07.220> just<00:03:08.220> like<00:03:08.280> so<00:03:08.580> and

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
simply these come off just like so and

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:11.200 
temperature gauge and that sort of thing

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.410 
temperature gauge and that sort of thing
you<00:06:11.950> can<00:06:12.070> just<00:06:12.190> take<00:06:12.250> one<00:06:12.400> of<00:06:12.490> these<00:06:12.550> a<00:06:12.610> hard

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:13.420 
you can just take one of these a hard

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:15.120 
you can just take one of these a hard
drive<00:06:13.600> bays<00:06:13.780> out<00:06:14.020> and<00:06:14.230> then<00:06:14.650> you<00:06:14.740> have<00:06:14.860> three

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:15.130 
drive bays out and then you have three

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:16.980 
drive bays out and then you have three
more<00:06:15.280> making<00:06:15.610> six<00:06:16.000> five<00:06:16.390> and<00:06:16.420> a<00:06:16.600> quarter<00:06:16.720> bays

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:16.990 
more making six five and a quarter bays

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:19.230 
more making six five and a quarter bays
in<00:06:17.020> total<00:06:17.500> so<00:06:17.920> if<00:06:18.190> you're<00:06:18.370> five<00:06:18.910> and<00:06:19.090> a<00:06:19.120> quarter

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:19.240 
in total so if you're five and a quarter

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.930 
in total so if you're five and a quarter
crazy<00:06:20.010> not<00:06:21.010> all<00:06:21.130> the<00:06:21.220> way<00:06:21.250> crazy<00:06:21.550> just<00:06:21.820> five

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:21.940 
crazy not all the way crazy just five

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:24.210 
crazy not all the way crazy just five
and<00:06:22.120> a<00:06:22.150> quarter<00:06:22.300> then<00:06:23.050> you<00:06:23.169> can<00:06:23.290> do<00:06:23.350> that<00:06:23.500> you
