offer to guide you out to where you can
make<00:00:23.939> a<00:00:23.970> homestead<00:00:24.449> but<00:00:24.630> you<00:00:24.750> don't<00:00:24.960> have<00:00:25.080> any

00:00:25.249 --> 00:00:25.259 
make a homestead but you don't have any

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:26.660 
make a homestead but you don't have any
money<00:00:25.410> so<00:00:25.529> it's<00:00:25.800> really<00:00:26.039> kind<00:00:26.310> of<00:00:26.400> irrelevant

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
money so it's really kind of irrelevant

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.849 
money so it's really kind of irrelevant
there's<00:00:27.119> no<00:00:27.359> home<00:00:27.599> there's<00:00:28.050> no<00:00:28.230> money<00:00:28.500> to<00:00:28.619> pay

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.499 
there's no home there's no money to pay
them<00:00:29.099> thus<00:00:29.400> you<00:00:29.699> can't<00:00:29.939> do<00:00:30.060> anything<00:00:30.089> with

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:30.509 
them thus you can't do anything with

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:32.440 
them thus you can't do anything with
them<00:00:30.630> you<00:00:31.050> can<00:00:31.349> go<00:00:31.589> through<00:00:31.619> these<00:00:31.980> doors

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:32.450 
them you can go through these doors

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.120 
them you can go through these doors
basically<00:00:33.470> believe<00:00:34.470> you<00:00:34.530> can<00:00:34.620> go<00:00:34.710> through<00:00:34.920> any

skill to this point anvil hunting and
gathering<00:03:21.750> skill<00:03:21.930> to<00:03:22.019> this<00:03:22.169> point<00:03:22.349> before<00:03:22.560> you

00:03:22.789 --> 00:03:22.799 
gathering skill to this point before you

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:24.229 
gathering skill to this point before you
can<00:03:22.919> buy<00:03:23.040> survival<00:03:23.519> skills<00:03:23.730> it's<00:03:23.910> the<00:03:23.970> only

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
can buy survival skills it's the only

can buy survival skills it's the only
skill<00:03:24.450> we<00:03:24.569> could<00:03:24.720> buy<00:03:24.840> right<00:03:25.019> now<00:03:25.049> so<00:03:25.319> that's

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
skill we could buy right now so that's

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:27.440 
skill we could buy right now so that's
going<00:03:25.590> to<00:03:25.650> be<00:03:25.739> our<00:03:25.829> main<00:03:26.310> quest<00:03:26.970> once<00:03:27.209> we<00:03:27.329> get

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
going to be our main quest once we get

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.360 
going to be our main quest once we get
out<00:03:27.660> on<00:03:27.840> the<00:03:28.019> road<00:03:28.049> I'll<00:03:28.680> explain<00:03:28.919> more<00:03:29.190> about

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
out on the road I'll explain more about

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.339 
out on the road I'll explain more about
studying<00:03:29.940> in<00:03:30.180> a<00:03:30.239> future<00:03:30.510> episode<00:03:30.569> but<00:03:30.989> for<00:03:31.169> now

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:31.349 
studying in a future episode but for now

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:33.289 
studying in a future episode but for now
let's<00:03:31.950> move<00:03:32.129> on<00:03:32.310> to<00:03:32.340> the<00:03:32.910> rest<00:03:33.060> of<00:03:33.209> the

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:33.299 
let's move on to the rest of the

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:34.640 
let's move on to the rest of the
interface<00:03:33.629> over<00:03:33.900> here<00:03:34.049> we<00:03:34.139> have<00:03:34.169> basically

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
interface over here we have basically

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.110 
interface over here we have basically
some<00:03:34.889> quick<00:03:35.129> controls<00:03:35.639> to<00:03:35.790> get<00:03:35.910> you<00:03:36.000> to

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
some quick controls to get you to

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.569 
some quick controls to get you to
different<00:03:36.440> different<00:03:37.440> commands<00:03:37.799> to<00:03:37.980> have<00:03:38.160> you

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:38.579 
different different commands to have you

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:39.860 
different different commands to have you
have<00:03:38.730> available<00:03:39.180> this<00:03:39.389> time<00:03:39.540> it's<00:03:39.720> really

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
have available this time it's really

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.030 
have available this time it's really
important<00:03:40.169> to<00:03:40.200> check<00:03:40.379> this<00:03:40.500> every<00:03:40.650> time<00:03:40.859> you

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
important to check this every time you

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.009 
important to check this every time you
add<00:03:41.190> a<00:03:41.220> new<00:03:41.459> skill<00:03:41.849> as<00:03:42.090> well<00:03:42.299> because<00:03:42.690> stuff

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
add a new skill as well because stuff

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:45.080 
add a new skill as well because stuff
appears<00:03:43.379> here<00:03:43.680> nobody<00:03:44.160> tells<00:03:44.400> you<00:03:44.549> it's<00:03:44.790> just

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
appears here nobody tells you it's just

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.189 
appears here nobody tells you it's just
there<00:03:45.329> for<00:03:45.540> you<00:03:45.959> to<00:03:46.079> explore<00:03:46.699> exciting<00:03:47.699> so<00:03:48.239> the

one that you're going to be most
concerned<00:03:50.280> with<00:03:50.519> this<00:03:50.849> point<00:03:51.090> is<00:03:51.269> travel

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
concerned with this point is travel

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:53.839 
concerned with this point is travel
because<00:03:52.560> the<00:03:52.739> travel<00:03:53.160> is<00:03:53.250> going<00:03:53.400> to<00:03:53.459> let<00:03:53.609> you

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:53.849 
because the travel is going to let you

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:55.819 
because the travel is going to let you
travel<00:03:54.389> home<00:03:54.750> of<00:03:55.019> course<00:03:55.260> we<00:03:55.500> don't<00:03:55.650> have<00:03:55.799> a

something you left out in the wilderness

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:06.830 
something you left out in the wilderness
you<00:04:05.430> essentially<00:04:05.879> can't<00:04:05.910> get<00:04:06.239> lost<00:04:06.510> if<00:04:06.750> you're

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
just going out foraging you can always

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:10.129 
just going out foraging you can always
zoom<00:04:08.669> back<00:04:08.879> to<00:04:09.060> Boston<00:04:09.419> although<00:04:09.690> there's

zoom back to Boston although there's

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:11.750 
zoom back to Boston although there's
actually<00:04:10.470> a<00:04:10.500> little<00:04:10.620> reason<00:04:10.980> to<00:04:11.129> zoom<00:04:11.400> back<00:04:11.430> to

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
actually a little reason to zoom back to

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.280 
actually a little reason to zoom back to
Boston<00:04:12.120> before<00:04:12.269> we<00:04:12.599> get<00:04:12.750> to<00:04:12.870> the<00:04:12.959> point<00:04:13.109> where

Boston before we get to the point where
we're<00:04:13.440> actually<00:04:13.590> able<00:04:13.799> to<00:04:14.040> craft<00:04:14.280> things<00:04:14.489> it

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:14.609 
we're actually able to craft things it

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:18.050 
we're actually able to craft things it
can<00:04:14.699> be<00:04:14.790> sold<00:04:15.060> so<00:04:15.480> on<00:04:16.199> that<00:04:16.229> note<00:04:16.799> just<00:04:17.789> for<00:04:17.910> the

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
that sort of thing so and that brings us

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.980 
that sort of thing so and that brings us
