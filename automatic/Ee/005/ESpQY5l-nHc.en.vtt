that one extra handling that's like

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.740 
that one extra handling that's like
nothing<00:01:40.950> that's<00:01:41.400> literally<00:01:41.909> nothing<00:01:42.360> like

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
nothing that's literally nothing like

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:45.319 
nothing that's literally nothing like
not<00:01:42.930> a<00:01:42.960> big<00:01:43.229> deal<00:01:43.500> but<00:01:43.740> one<00:01:44.280> fire<00:01:44.640> rate<00:01:44.939> or<00:01:45.149> one

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
not a big deal but one fire rate or one

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:48.740 
not a big deal but one fire rate or one
damage<00:01:45.960> is<00:01:46.200> a<00:01:46.259> huge<00:01:46.920> deal<00:01:47.220> so<00:01:47.579> if<00:01:47.790> like<00:01:48.329> one<00:01:48.540> gun

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
damage is a huge deal so if like one gun

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.289 
damage is a huge deal so if like one gun
is<00:01:48.899> like<00:01:49.079> plus<00:01:49.409> 2<00:01:49.740> damage<00:01:49.979> than<00:01:50.399> minus<00:01:50.759> 1<00:01:50.790> fire

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
is like plus 2 damage than minus 1 fire

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.330 
is like plus 2 damage than minus 1 fire
rate<00:01:51.509> like<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.780> obsidian<00:01:52.200> steed<00:01:52.560> it<00:01:53.070> wouldn't

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
rate like the obsidian steed it wouldn't

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.429

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
damage of the fire rate so when a gun

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.959
