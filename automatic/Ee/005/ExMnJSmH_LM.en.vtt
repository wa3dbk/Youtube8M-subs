00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:06.270
 press you on the belkin channel 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:10.160
 so today we will continue to do dmitri 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:13.769
 sores on this wonderful machine 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:18.470
 today we will do this 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.470
 billet made it to the bottom pull out 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:27.750
 let's start here with this plane here will be 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:32.510
 double end to neve to meet each 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:36.649
 a friend will go but something and session 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:36.649
 So we insert the workpiece 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:10.510
 small radius cutter 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:17.380
 end nicknames exhibited begin to do in 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.380
 one side 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.739
 and so one way mike miller did 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:21.800
 that's it at night is wrong now we cable 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.680
 the side where we were clamped we 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.680
 release the clamp and clamp it here 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:39.120
 now the workpiece we will rotate in 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.120
 the other side 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:47.400
 well we continue to do the same 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:35.210
 and so it turned out we have such a mesh 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:35.210
 gradual run 

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:43.810
 to the maximum depth so me 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:45.690
 seemed more likeable than not 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:49.840
 one way or the other 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:53.830
 it's not all the final touch we 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:56.370
 let's do it in this place to our 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.370
 portrait 

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:23.380
 all we got here means 

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:26.770
 made a grip and turned the workpiece on 

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:27.750
 36 degrees 10 visits 10 such here 

00:06:26.770 --> 00:06:32.979
 cavatelli 

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:35.220
 This radius is not just simple 

00:06:32.979 --> 00:06:35.220
 operations 

00:06:39.449 --> 00:06:45.110
 but generally all 

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:45.110
 nothing more will not be 

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:54.889
 this work is finished the part is ready 

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:54.889
 the detail is quite simple 

00:06:55.610 --> 00:07:03.200
 pretty cute I think 

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:06.950
 remove all 1 

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:10.370
 I'll try to show you another option. 

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:14.510
 rather unusual if it will have 

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:14.510
 make me 

00:07:15.009 --> 00:07:19.280
 treat this 

00:07:17.420 --> 00:07:21.370
 but for today all good luck and to 

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:21.370
 meeting
