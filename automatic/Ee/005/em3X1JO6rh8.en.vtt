once<00:01:11.790> you<00:01:11.909> get<00:01:12.000> your<00:01:12.210> multiplier<00:01:12.720> going<00:01:13.080> this

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
once you get your multiplier going this

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.240 
once you get your multiplier going this
is<00:01:13.350> going<00:01:13.500> to<00:01:13.590> be<00:01:13.710> easy<00:01:14.130> points<00:01:16.250> headshots

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
is going to be easy points headshots

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.340 
is going to be easy points headshots
obviously<00:01:17.850> helped<00:01:18.060> a<00:01:18.299> lot<00:01:18.720> they're<00:01:19.170> not

not gonna be an issue and here we are

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.139 
not gonna be an issue and here we are
we're<00:02:07.860> about<00:02:08.009> seconds<00:02:08.489> away<00:02:08.580> from<00:02:08.700> getting

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
we're about seconds away from getting

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.710 
we're about seconds away from getting
this<00:02:09.300> gold<00:02:09.780> medal<00:02:09.989> time<00:02:10.550> and<00:02:11.550> there<00:02:12.209> there's

gold<00:02:13.140> I<00:02:13.349> don't<00:02:13.440> know<00:02:13.560> what<00:02:13.650> forty

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
gold I don't know what forty

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:20.449 
gold I don't know what forty
I<00:02:13.980> thought<00:02:14.220> its<00:02:14.400> 45,000<00:02:15.090> gold<00:02:15.470> about<00:02:16.470> 25<00:02:19.430> yeah

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:20.459 
I thought its 45,000 gold about 25 yeah

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:22.400 
I thought its 45,000 gold about 25 yeah
maybe<00:02:20.940> maybe<00:02:21.209> we<00:02:21.300> need<00:02:21.480> the<00:02:21.599> 45<00:02:21.989> maybe<00:02:22.290> that

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:22.410 
maybe maybe we need the 45 maybe that

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:23.900 
maybe maybe we need the 45 maybe that
was<00:02:22.530> silver<00:02:22.830> I<00:02:23.010> must<00:02:23.280> have<00:02:23.370> been<00:02:23.430> silver<00:02:23.760> but

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
was silver I must have been silver but

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.150 
was silver I must have been silver but
again<00:02:24.120> we're<00:02:24.660> getting<00:02:24.780> points<00:02:25.230> so<00:02:25.410> fast<00:02:25.830> here

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
again we're getting points so fast here

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.089 
again we're getting points so fast here
it's<00:02:26.879> just<00:02:27.180> ridiculous<00:02:27.840> as<00:02:28.170> you<00:02:28.560> can<00:02:28.650> see<00:02:28.860> when

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
it's just ridiculous as you can see when

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:30.440 
it's just ridiculous as you can see when
I'm<00:02:29.190> talking<00:02:29.519> we<00:02:29.610> were<00:02:29.730> already<00:02:29.849> multiple

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
I'm talking we were already multiple

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:47.140 
I'm talking we were already multiple
thousands<00:02:30.900> up<00:02:31.080> of<00:02:31.260> where<00:02:32.190> we<00:02:32.370> were

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:57.650 

we<00:02:48.150> got<00:02:48.440> 16<00:02:49.440> seconds<00:02:50.130> here<00:02:56.180> quit<00:02:57.180> hitting<00:02:57.390> me

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
we got 16 seconds here quit hitting me

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.570 
we got 16 seconds here quit hitting me
that's<00:02:57.930> not<00:02:58.110> very<00:02:58.200> nice<00:03:00.110> and<00:03:01.110> there<00:03:01.560> we<00:03:01.650> go<00:03:01.770> 54

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
that's not very nice and there we go 54

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:07.100 
that's not very nice and there we go 54
54<00:03:03.540> 8<00:03:03.959> and<00:03:04.760> we<00:03:05.760> got<00:03:05.910> it<00:03:06.060> so<00:03:06.540> hopefully<00:03:06.720> that's<00:03:07.020> a

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:07.110 
54 8 and we got it so hopefully that's a

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:10.270 
54 8 and we got it so hopefully that's a
help<00:03:07.319> that<00:03:07.530> was<00:03:07.800> also<00:03:08.190> my<00:03:08.370> 15th<00:03:09.150> pursuit<00:03:09.569> done
