00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
time and time again for me and that's

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.520 
time and time again for me and that's
what<00:01:59.610> I<00:01:59.640> mean<00:01:59.939> it<00:02:00.180> was<00:02:00.420> so<00:02:00.450> easy<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:01.140> get<00:02:01.229> clips

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
what I mean it was so easy to get clips

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.770 
what I mean it was so easy to get clips
with<00:02:01.710> so<00:02:01.920> he<00:02:02.070> is<00:02:02.340> definitely<00:02:02.670> a<00:02:03.060> supreme

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
with so he is definitely a supreme

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.539 
with so he is definitely a supreme
silver<00:02:04.350> and<00:02:04.500> again<00:02:04.770> look<00:02:05.250> at<00:02:05.430> that

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
silver and again look at that

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.819 
silver and again look at that
persistency<00:02:06.420> just<00:02:06.899> to<00:02:07.020> get<00:02:07.229> in<00:02:07.350> front<00:02:07.500> of<00:02:07.680> the

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
persistency just to get in front of the

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.740 
persistency just to get in front of the
defender<00:02:08.369> and<00:02:08.550> he<00:02:08.940> actually<00:02:09.090> stayed<00:02:09.539> onside

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750
