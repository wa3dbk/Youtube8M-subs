the<00:00:20.150> first<00:00:20.390> thing<00:00:20.630> you'll<00:00:20.840> do<00:00:21.080> when<00:00:21.320> you

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:21.470 
the first thing you'll do when you

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.980 
the first thing you'll do when you
receive<00:00:21.650> your<00:00:21.890> machine<00:00:22.490> is<00:00:22.880> you<00:00:23.180> will<00:00:23.420> plug<00:00:23.840> it

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:23.990 
receive your machine is you will plug it

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.880 
receive your machine is you will plug it
in<00:00:24.199> and<00:00:25.160> do<00:00:25.460> not<00:00:25.609> have<00:00:25.910> it<00:00:26.029> turned<00:00:26.330> on<00:00:26.890> remove

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:27.890 
in and do not have it turned on remove

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.689 
in and do not have it turned on remove
the<00:00:28.220> water<00:00:28.609> reservoir<00:00:28.880> cap<00:00:30.039> the<00:00:31.039> reservoir

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:31.699 
the water reservoir cap the reservoir

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:34.780 
the water reservoir cap the reservoir
holds<00:00:31.939> 64<00:00:32.599> ounces<00:00:33.079> of<00:00:33.260> water<00:00:33.500> and<00:00:33.949> just<00:00:34.460> taking

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:34.790 
holds 64 ounces of water and just taking

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.750 
holds 64 ounces of water and just taking
your<00:00:35.149> pitcher<00:00:35.780> it<00:00:36.320> holds<00:00:36.649> 20<00:00:36.980> ounces<00:00:37.370> of<00:00:37.550> water

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
your pitcher it holds 20 ounces of water

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.490 
your pitcher it holds 20 ounces of water
so<00:00:38.120> to<00:00:38.210> start<00:00:38.570> with<00:00:38.750> just<00:00:39.020> do<00:00:39.200> it's<00:00:39.380> about

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.500 
so to start with just do it's about

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.709 
so to start with just do it's about
three<00:00:39.920> pictures<00:00:40.399> full<00:00:40.700> that<00:00:41.059> should<00:00:41.329> get<00:00:41.480> you

00:00:41.709 --> 00:00:41.719 
three pictures full that should get you

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:45.040 
three pictures full that should get you
close<00:00:42.020> to<00:00:42.230> the<00:00:42.290> top<00:00:42.620> and<00:00:43.090> then<00:00:44.090> replace<00:00:44.809> the

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.050 
close to the top and then replace the

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.650 
close to the top and then replace the
cap<00:00:45.260> now<00:00:46.010> the<00:00:46.070> cap<00:00:46.430> does<00:00:46.790> not<00:00:47.030> have<00:00:47.300> to<00:00:47.540> be

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:47.660 
cap now the cap does not have to be

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.990 
cap now the cap does not have to be
screwed<00:00:48.050> down<00:00:48.260> tightly<00:00:48.680> it<00:00:49.190> is<00:00:49.370> not<00:00:49.640> a

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.000 
screwed down tightly it is not a

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.110 
screwed down tightly it is not a
pressurized<00:00:50.930> tank<00:00:51.399> so<00:00:52.399> it's<00:00:52.610> just<00:00:52.850> to<00:00:52.969> keep

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:53.120 
pressurized tank so it's just to keep

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.090 
pressurized tank so it's just to keep
debris<00:00:53.600> and<00:00:53.870> dust<00:00:54.170> and<00:00:54.500> getting<00:00:54.800> in<00:00:54.980> the

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
debris and dust and getting in the

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.010 
debris and dust and getting in the
reservoir<00:00:55.700> now<00:00:56.149> we're<00:00:56.390> going<00:00:56.570> to<00:00:56.660> engage

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:57.020 
reservoir now we're going to engage

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.860

point<00:01:11.810> of<00:01:12.049> resistance<00:01:12.350> and<00:01:12.920> now<00:01:13.100> the<00:01:13.159> machine

00:01:13.389 --> 00:01:13.399 
point of resistance and now the machine

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:17.289 
point of resistance and now the machine
will<00:01:13.819> begin<00:01:14.179> to<00:01:14.420> heat<00:01:15.700> we've<00:01:16.700> opened<00:01:17.209> the

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:17.299 
will begin to heat we've opened the

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:20.949 
will begin to heat we've opened the
steam<00:01:17.569> wand<00:01:17.749> for<00:01:18.229> a<00:01:18.259> reason<00:01:19.179> that<00:01:20.179> reason<00:01:20.509> is

00:01:20.949 --> 00:01:20.959 
steam wand for a reason that reason is

00:01:20.959 --> 00:01:24.699 
steam wand for a reason that reason is
as<00:01:21.289> the<00:01:21.889> boiler<00:01:22.579> heats<00:01:22.939> it<00:01:23.779> is<00:01:24.079> important<00:01:24.649> to

00:01:24.699 --> 00:01:24.709 
as the boiler heats it is important to

00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:27.160 
as the boiler heats it is important to
allow<00:01:24.889> the<00:01:25.099> cold<00:01:25.609> air<00:01:25.880> to<00:01:25.909> escape<00:01:26.810> from<00:01:26.990> the

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
allow the cold air to escape from the

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.149 
allow the cold air to escape from the
top<00:01:27.409> of<00:01:27.619> the<00:01:27.740> boiler<00:01:28.810> doing<00:01:29.810> an<00:01:30.229> opening<00:01:30.919> this

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:31.159 
top of the boiler doing an opening this

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:33.219 
top of the boiler doing an opening this
it<00:01:31.429> gives<00:01:31.549> you<00:01:31.789> a<00:01:31.819> line<00:01:32.240> where<00:01:32.630> the<00:01:32.779> air<00:01:32.929> is

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:33.229 
it gives you a line where the air is

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:35.889 
it gives you a line where the air is
flushed<00:01:33.560> out<00:01:33.829> and<00:01:34.189> as<00:01:34.639> soon<00:01:34.939> as<00:01:35.090> it<00:01:35.240> begins<00:01:35.419> to

00:01:35.889 --> 00:01:35.899 
flushed out and as soon as it begins to

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:38.319 
flushed out and as soon as it begins to
sputter<00:01:36.259> you<00:01:36.979> can<00:01:37.219> close<00:01:37.549> it<00:01:37.579> that<00:01:38.060> means

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:38.329 
sputter you can close it that means

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:40.510 
sputter you can close it that means
we've<00:01:38.569> bled<00:01:38.840> the<00:01:39.020> cold<00:01:39.259> air<00:01:39.499> and<00:01:39.770> the<00:01:40.159> machine

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:40.520 
we've bled the cold air and the machine

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.019 
we've bled the cold air and the machine
will<00:01:40.729> proceed<00:01:41.209> to<00:01:41.419> heat<00:01:41.979> and<00:01:42.979> the<00:01:43.009> machine<00:01:43.849> has

00:01:44.019 --> 00:01:44.029 
will proceed to heat and the machine has

00:01:44.029 --> 00:01:46.479 
will proceed to heat and the machine has
started<00:01:44.299> to<00:01:44.599> steam<00:01:44.929> so<00:01:45.649> we<00:01:45.799> can<00:01:45.979> close<00:01:46.219> the

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:46.489 
started to steam so we can close the

00:01:46.489 --> 00:01:50.620 
started to steam so we can close the
knob<00:01:46.929> and<00:01:48.039> now<00:01:49.039> the<00:01:49.099> gauge<00:01:49.549> will<00:01:49.849> rise<00:01:50.090> and<00:01:50.539> you

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:50.630 
knob and now the gauge will rise and you

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.349 
knob and now the gauge will rise and you
won't<00:01:51.499> get<00:01:51.709> a<00:01:51.739> full<00:01:51.859> pressure<00:01:52.639> reading<00:01:53.149> this

00:01:53.349 --> 00:01:53.359 
won't get a full pressure reading this

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:56.050 
won't get a full pressure reading this
way<00:01:53.539> either<00:01:53.810> it's<00:01:54.229> very<00:01:54.560> nice<00:01:55.429> to<00:01:55.459> put<00:01:55.849> your

the heater off it regulates it from high

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
the heater off it regulates it from high
to<00:02:19.040> low

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
to low

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.309 
to low
so<00:02:20.720> our<00:02:20.959> machine<00:02:21.379> has<00:02:21.650> reached<00:02:21.950> pressure<00:02:23.319> we

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 
so our machine has reached pressure we

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:28.619 
so our machine has reached pressure we
have<00:02:24.349> very<00:02:24.799> nice<00:02:25.069> team<00:02:25.489> and<00:02:25.819> we<00:02:26.480> are<00:02:26.690> all<00:02:27.080> ready

have very nice team and we are all ready
now<00:02:29.629> the<00:02:30.290> machine<00:02:30.709> is<00:02:30.980> very<00:02:31.010> hot<00:02:31.670> and<00:02:32.030> nice

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180 
now the machine is very hot and nice

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.030 
now the machine is very hot and nice
inside<00:02:32.750> the<00:02:33.019> boilers<00:02:33.470> reached<00:02:33.769> its
