can<00:02:00.909> use<00:02:01.060> it<00:02:01.210> on<00:02:01.299> lily<00:02:01.540> pads<00:02:01.840> I<00:02:02.110> don't<00:02:02.740> know<00:02:02.860> of

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:02.979 
can use it on lily pads I don't know of

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:04.770 
can use it on lily pads I don't know of
any<00:02:03.100> other<00:02:03.280> way<00:02:03.369> that<00:02:03.820> you<00:02:03.939> can<00:02:04.090> cut<00:02:04.270> lily<00:02:04.479> pads

even<00:02:04.990> this<00:02:05.439> particular<00:02:05.860> pond<00:02:06.340> down<00:02:06.670> in<00:02:06.820> Texas

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:07.330 
even this particular pond down in Texas

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:08.940 
even this particular pond down in Texas
we're<00:02:07.930> talking<00:02:08.200> this<00:02:08.289> thing<00:02:08.470> is<00:02:08.590> full<00:02:08.830> of

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
we're talking this thing is full of

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.390 
we're talking this thing is full of
stumps<00:02:09.489> tires<00:02:10.479> anything<00:02:11.439> you<00:02:11.620> can<00:02:11.799> imagine<00:02:12.040> in

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
stumps tires anything you can imagine in

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.339 
stumps tires anything you can imagine in
there<00:02:12.519> lots<00:02:12.790> of<00:02:12.970> branches<00:02:13.480> and

00:02:14.339 --> 00:02:14.349 
there lots of branches and

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:15.990 
there lots of branches and
yeah<00:02:14.769> it<00:02:14.890> makes<00:02:15.040> a<00:02:15.189> little<00:02:15.430> more<00:02:15.579> difficult

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
yeah it makes a little more difficult

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.490 
yeah it makes a little more difficult
but<00:02:16.209> it'll<00:02:16.420> kind<00:02:16.629> of<00:02:16.689> bounce<00:02:16.959> off<00:02:17.200> those

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
but it'll kind of bounce off those

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.259 
but it'll kind of bounce off those
things<00:02:17.739> and<00:02:18.040> you<00:02:18.549> can<00:02:18.730> pull<00:02:18.939> it<00:02:18.969> right<00:02:19.209> through

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:19.269 
things and you can pull it right through

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:22.380 
things and you can pull it right through
this<00:02:20.109> is<00:02:20.290> torpedo<00:02:20.829> grass<00:02:21.159> tough<00:02:21.670> stuff<00:02:22.090> down

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
this is torpedo grass tough stuff down

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.099 
this is torpedo grass tough stuff down
in<00:02:22.569> Florida<00:02:23.019> and<00:02:23.200> again<00:02:23.879> this<00:02:24.879> is<00:02:25.150> in<00:02:25.329> about

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:26.109 
in Florida and again this is in about

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:28.830 
in Florida and again this is in about
two<00:02:26.439> feet<00:02:26.650> of<00:02:26.709> water<00:02:26.829> in<00:02:27.340> a<00:02:27.849> pond<00:02:28.120> and<00:02:28.450> so<00:02:28.689> it

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
two feet of water in a pond and so it

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:30.149 
two feet of water in a pond and so it
doesn't<00:02:29.140> make<00:02:29.230> a<00:02:29.260> difference<00:02:29.439> if<00:02:29.799> you're<00:02:30.040> in

00:02:30.149 --> 00:02:30.159 
doesn't make a difference if you're in

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:32.039 
doesn't make a difference if you're in
two<00:02:30.459> feet<00:02:30.700> of<00:02:30.819> water<00:02:30.849> as<00:02:31.209> you<00:02:31.329> see<00:02:31.569> right<00:02:31.599> here

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:32.049 
two feet of water as you see right here

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:34.530 
two feet of water as you see right here
or<00:02:32.230> the<00:02:32.950> shot<00:02:33.189> that<00:02:33.519> had<00:02:33.700> 12<00:02:34.090> feet<00:02:34.359> of<00:02:34.390> water

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
or the shot that had 12 feet of water

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.559 
or the shot that had 12 feet of water
with<00:02:35.019> thick<00:02:35.439> thick<00:02:35.799> hydrilla<00:02:36.280> no<00:02:37.060> matter<00:02:37.299> what

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:37.569 
with thick thick hydrilla no matter what

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:39.479 
with thick thick hydrilla no matter what
it's<00:02:37.959> going<00:02:38.230> to<00:02:38.290> come<00:02:38.470> right<00:02:38.680> through<00:02:38.739> and<00:02:39.310> it

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:39.489 
it's going to come right through and it

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:40.649 
it's going to come right through and it
doesn't<00:02:39.790> come<00:02:39.909> in<00:02:40.030> with<00:02:40.150> a<00:02:40.180> bunch<00:02:40.329> of<00:02:40.510> weeds

00:02:40.649 --> 00:02:40.659 
doesn't come in with a bunch of weeds

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:42.599 
doesn't come in with a bunch of weeds
it's<00:02:40.840> not<00:02:40.989> a<00:02:41.019> rake<00:02:41.349> it's<00:02:41.739> a<00:02:41.920> cutter<00:02:42.220> and<00:02:42.459> it

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:42.609 
it's not a rake it's a cutter and it

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:45.059 
it's not a rake it's a cutter and it
cuts<00:02:42.849> them<00:02:43.030> off<00:02:43.120> at<00:02:43.389> the<00:02:43.689> bottom<00:02:44.019> so<00:02:44.650> as<00:02:44.920> you

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
through the tough torpedo grass that you

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:26.829 
in it just literally cuts it off right

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:30.030 
in it just literally cuts it off right
at<00:03:27.069> the<00:03:27.639> base<00:03:27.989> now<00:03:28.989> in<00:03:29.169> this<00:03:29.290> particular<00:03:29.530> case

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:30.040 
at the base now in this particular case

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:32.580 
at the base now in this particular case
it's<00:03:30.579> coming<00:03:30.879> through<00:03:31.090> very<00:03:31.299> thick<00:03:32.049> torpedo

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
it's coming through very thick torpedo

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.789 
it's coming through very thick torpedo
grass<00:03:32.889> and<00:03:33.190> this<00:03:33.400> stuff<00:03:33.669> is<00:03:33.879> is<00:03:34.840> incredibly

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:35.799 
grass and this stuff is is incredibly

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:37.800 
grass and this stuff is is incredibly
tough<00:03:36.190> but<00:03:36.970> as<00:03:37.090> you<00:03:37.209> can<00:03:37.329> see<00:03:37.540> it<00:03:37.750> just

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
tough but as you can see it just

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:42.270 
tough but as you can see it just
literally<00:03:38.590> falls<00:03:39.340> right<00:03:40.060> over<00:03:40.979> there<00:03:41.979> is<00:03:42.099> some

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:42.280 
literally falls right over there is some

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.670 
literally falls right over there is some
effort<00:03:42.400> required<00:03:43.000> but<00:03:43.720> compared<00:03:44.319> to<00:03:44.379> what<00:03:44.590> it

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:44.680 
effort required but compared to what it

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:46.729 
effort required but compared to what it
would<00:03:44.799> be<00:03:44.949> with<00:03:45.129> your<00:03:45.250> doing<00:03:45.579> anything<00:03:46.239> else

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
would be with your doing anything else

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:50.309 
would be with your doing anything else
and<00:03:47.739> the<00:03:48.129> time<00:03:48.459> that<00:03:48.489> it<00:03:48.699> takes<00:03:48.970> is<00:03:49.319> really

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:50.319 
and the time that it takes is really

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:52.140 
and the time that it takes is really
easy<00:03:50.560> now<00:03:50.799> this<00:03:51.010> is<00:03:51.190> really<00:03:51.459> another<00:03:51.790> great

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
easy now this is really another great

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.300 
easy now this is really another great
option<00:03:52.569> is<00:03:52.659> that<00:03:52.810> you<00:03:52.959> can<00:03:53.169> add<00:03:53.530> additional

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
option is that you can add additional

option is that you can add additional
handle<00:03:55.120> to<00:03:55.269> it<00:03:55.299> it<00:03:55.540> comes<00:03:55.750> standard<00:03:56.049> with<00:03:56.319> nine

00:03:56.729 --> 00:03:56.739 
handle to it it comes standard with nine

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:59.009 
handle to it it comes standard with nine
feet<00:03:57.099> but<00:03:57.790> most<00:03:58.030> of<00:03:58.209> the<00:03:58.329> time<00:03:58.540> and<00:03:58.750> in<00:03:58.870> my

00:03:59.009 --> 00:03:59.019 
feet but most of the time and in my

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:01.500 
feet but most of the time and in my
particular<00:03:59.290> case<00:03:59.769> I<00:04:00.010> almost<00:04:00.459> always<00:04:00.909> use<00:04:01.329> it

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
particular case I almost always use it

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:03.059 
particular case I almost always use it
with<00:04:01.659> the<00:04:01.780> shortest<00:04:02.199> handle<00:04:02.530> possible<00:04:02.949> the

00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:03.069 
with the shortest handle possible the

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:05.879 
with the shortest handle possible the
shorter<00:04:03.579> the<00:04:03.790> easier<00:04:04.209> it<00:04:04.329> is<00:04:04.449> to<00:04:04.720> control<00:04:05.530> the

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:05.889 
shorter the easier it is to control the

00:04:05.889 --> 00:04:07.949 
shorter the easier it is to control the
shorter<00:04:06.760> it<00:04:06.849> is<00:04:06.939> the<00:04:07.209> farther<00:04:07.569> you<00:04:07.689> could

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:07.959 
shorter it is the farther you could

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:10.890 
shorter it is the farther you could
throw<00:04:08.139> it<00:04:08.349> and<00:04:08.530> so<00:04:09.250> in<00:04:10.209> this<00:04:10.540> particular

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
throw it and so in this particular

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.990 
throw it and so in this particular
application<00:04:11.229> this<00:04:11.829> is<00:04:11.889> a<00:04:11.979> real<00:04:12.250> application
