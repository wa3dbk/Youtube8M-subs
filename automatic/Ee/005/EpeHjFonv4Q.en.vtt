00:00:26.149 --> 00:00:29.949
 Brown wore it, it's time again and the situation 

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:31.890
 for expression and Co 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:34.360
 there were impressions quality 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.450
 she switched the order of the new a8 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.630
 Photo Probst 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:42.420
 3 rattling appearance that optimize the Hamas pressure 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.330
 at the US 

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.690
 perfect in the homezone 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.050
 in the areas before that, Spoerr has to cast votes 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.250
 Do not put Homo in your hand 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.510
 then throw 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:52.650
 and third 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:54.560
 the operation of the app costs 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.210
 must be very valuable 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.290
 In many vehicles include street scene, then I see 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:01.770
 times a team 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.470
 the 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.470
 start there - Norbert Frohoff 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.240
 the topic "free please Runkel is a topic that was initiated by Audi 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.660
 Vehicle accelerates four stages 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.760
 we start with a threat situation in our country 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.230
 Chamber we then put one already optimized the vehicle in the 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:27.120
 desert 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:31.510
 Then, just before the start, once again weather a Simão Nations 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:35.240
 and complete the entire test with a final vehicle in the desert 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.530
 technical development in the wine sector means 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.530
 that we examine the material concepts early on 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:47.750
 Foresee brackets and that we are sure if the components in Spa too 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.750
 that looks to meet the requirements 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.010
 the cameras are realistic because who gives them union with the question 

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.719
 like tobacco 

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:59.779
 we have terrain in South Africa as well as the terrain in America and have there 

00:01:59.779 --> 00:02:03.389
 that captured values ​​and then transferred them to our Kamal 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:08.190
 we also have as temperatures of minus 40 degrees and one around air temperature 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:14.040
 of 42 degrees and in the vehicle itself a headstand temperature of 85 degrees and we 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.820
 have tried to do with vehicles that have sent the desert and 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.100
 We got hit that we can 90 percent of the damage in ours 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.139
 also kick 

00:02:23.139 --> 00:02:29.130
 the new the na'vi channel of Audi is unique in the application drops 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.130
 that is the only children the channel Bouvier 

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:35.689
 at speed 300 with sun 

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:37.419
 Can perform tests 

00:02:37.419 --> 00:02:41.339
 the team in the channel in the daily Emden 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:45.360
 best compromise between her and dynamics and design 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:49.930
 Ultimately it is so when a vehicle has the tests in the channel percent 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:50.909
 has stood 

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:54.169
 then the vehicle could actually go to all regions of this earth 

00:02:54.169 --> 00:02:56.689
 deliver v 

00:02:56.689 --> 00:03:00.339
 the effort to check each case was the way 

00:03:00.339 --> 00:03:05.239
 It goes from examinations in the Middle East to technical material 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:06.319
 exams 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:11.419
 the 1 then reversed from country tensile strength if so what 

00:03:11.419 --> 00:03:16.329
 If the material can be broken, then it's over-travel 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:17.529
 Treats 

00:03:17.529 --> 00:03:20.059
 to wear tests 

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:22.359
 Philip's behavior is checked 

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:27.339
 a very important criterion and above that, of course, the one or the other 

00:03:27.339 --> 00:03:30.339
 exposure 

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:34.849
 Frankfurt's first became about 4 

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:39.799
 25 years ago at Audi is for the children's course course 

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:44.279
 for us and aging processes if I think of the modern me driving style then 

00:03:44.279 --> 00:03:47.909
 This temperature is also very important in difference 

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:52.119
 because the materials are stretching differently 

00:03:52.119 --> 00:03:57.449
 the joy to find something in Chur test is of course connected with it 

00:03:57.449 --> 00:04:01.939
 Every human being seeks success and we want the big ones in the neighborhood 

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:04.289
 Clubs just be successful 

00:04:04.289 --> 00:04:07.779
 in an urgent process wants the same with you have it not only for us but 

00:04:07.779 --> 00:04:11.879
 that many items are designed and developed by many people 

00:04:12.699 --> 00:04:15.249
 Bern the Mainzer mounted 

00:04:15.249 --> 00:04:20.650
 to give an overall Steve's image on the Internet that will be removed from reality 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:22.290
 thus finds the 4 percent 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:24.490
 but is the absolute world leader 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:27.569
 At the moment there is no one that is nearly as high 

00:04:27.569 --> 00:04:30.569
 Percent of the education the CeBIT Hall will be for promotion 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:36.530
 I am
