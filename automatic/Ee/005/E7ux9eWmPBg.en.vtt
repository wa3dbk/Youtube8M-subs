today<00:00:03.030> we're<00:00:03.210> looking<00:00:03.360> at<00:00:03.659> Justin<00:00:04.440> the

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
today we're looking at Justin the

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.590 
today we're looking at Justin the
ignition<00:00:05.339> timing<00:00:05.609> on<00:00:05.910> an<00:00:06.180> air-cooled

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
ignition timing on an air-cooled

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.169 
ignition timing on an air-cooled
Volkswagen<00:00:07.410> but<00:00:08.280> this<00:00:08.429> should<00:00:08.610> really<00:00:08.790> apply

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
Volkswagen but this should really apply

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.900 
Volkswagen but this should really apply
to<00:00:09.620> anything<00:00:10.620> with<00:00:11.090> breaker<00:00:12.090> point<00:00:12.480> ignition

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:13.910 
to anything with breaker point ignition

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.380 
to anything with breaker point ignition
so<00:00:15.529> just<00:00:16.529> some<00:00:16.710> fundamental<00:00:17.250> things<00:00:17.279> I've<00:00:18.180> got

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
so just some fundamental things I've got

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.150 
so just some fundamental things I've got
the<00:00:18.570> wire<00:00:18.750> coming<00:00:19.080> off<00:00:19.289> of<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.650> points<00:00:20.100> that

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
the wire coming off of the points that

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.609 
the wire coming off of the points that
normally<00:00:20.580> would<00:00:20.730> be<00:00:20.930> attached<00:00:21.930> to<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:22.320> coil

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
normally would be attached to the coil

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.099 
normally would be attached to the coil
disconnected<00:00:23.490> and<00:00:24.150> I've<00:00:24.269> attached<00:00:24.630> it<00:00:24.900> to<00:00:25.140> my

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:27.109 
disconnected and I've attached it to my

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:30.650 
disconnected and I've attached it to my
multimeter<00:00:29.029> the<00:00:30.029> other<00:00:30.179> side<00:00:30.480> of<00:00:30.599> the

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
multimeter the other side of the

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.910 
multimeter the other side of the
multimeter<00:00:31.230> is<00:00:31.560> attached<00:00:32.460> to<00:00:32.640> a<00:00:33.530> good<00:00:34.530> ground

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
multimeter is attached to a good ground

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.590 
multimeter is attached to a good ground
in<00:00:35.910> this<00:00:36.899> case<00:00:37.140> I'm<00:00:37.380> using<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:38.600> distributor

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
in this case I'm using the distributor

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:46.069 
in this case I'm using the distributor
clamp<00:00:39.930> so<00:00:41.300> the<00:00:42.300> circuit<00:00:44.690> through<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.870> green

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
clamp so the circuit through the green

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.580 
clamp so the circuit through the green
wire<00:00:46.320> so<00:00:46.770> to<00:00:46.829> speak<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.910> ground<00:00:48.559> which<00:00:49.559> is

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
wire so to speak to ground which is

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.360 
wire so to speak to ground which is
through<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.039> points<00:00:50.780> when<00:00:51.780> it's<00:00:51.960> closed<00:00:52.370> the

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
through the points when it's closed the

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.270 
through the points when it's closed the
multimeter<00:00:53.969> will<00:00:54.300> make<00:00:55.079> a<00:00:55.110> buzzing<00:00:55.620> sound<00:00:58.280> now

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
multimeter will make a buzzing sound now

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.660 
multimeter will make a buzzing sound now
I<00:00:59.309> often<00:00:59.579> say<00:00:59.940> step<00:01:00.359> 1<00:01:00.949> turn<00:01:01.949> your<00:01:02.100> car<00:01:02.340> into<00:01:02.370> a

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
I often say step 1 turn your car into a

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.190 
I often say step 1 turn your car into a
Baja<00:01:03.120> Bug<00:01:03.390> so<00:01:03.719> you<00:01:03.780> have<00:01:03.989> access<00:01:04.589> but<00:01:05.549> today

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
Baja Bug so you have access but today

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.380 
Baja Bug so you have access but today
I'm<00:01:07.280> regretting<00:01:08.280> that<00:01:08.549> this<00:01:08.790> exhaust<00:01:09.240> system

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
I'm regretting that this exhaust system

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.990 
I'm regretting that this exhaust system
this<00:01:09.900> dual<00:01:10.140> exhaust<00:01:10.590> is<00:01:10.920> it's<00:01:11.549> in<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.760> way

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
this dual exhaust is it's in the way

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.719 
this dual exhaust is it's in the way
it's<00:01:12.240> tough<00:01:12.450> for<00:01:12.600> me<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:12.750> see<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.729> timing

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
it's tough for me to see the timing

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:23.149 
it's tough for me to see the timing
marks<00:01:15.470> but<00:01:17.750> let's<00:01:18.750> try<00:01:19.080> this<00:01:21.799> the<00:01:22.799> principle

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
marks but let's try this the principle

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.260 
marks but let's try this the principle
here<00:01:23.549> is<00:01:24.140> the<00:01:25.140> points<00:01:25.500> close

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.959 

that<00:01:29.259> makes<00:01:29.560> the<00:01:29.740> buzzer<00:01:29.950> on<00:01:30.130> the<00:01:30.399> multimeter

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:30.969 
that makes the buzzer on the multimeter

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:34.139 
that makes the buzzer on the multimeter
come<00:01:31.240> on<00:01:31.420> you<00:01:31.570> can<00:01:31.719> probably<00:01:31.929> hear<00:01:32.409> it<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.909> you

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:34.149 
come on you can probably hear it and you

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:39.330 
come on you can probably hear it and you
turn<00:01:34.390> the<00:01:34.570> engine<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:37.450> when<00:01:38.380> the<00:01:38.590> timing<00:01:39.070> mark

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340 
turn the engine and when the timing mark

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.639 
turn the engine and when the timing mark
on<00:01:39.579> the<00:01:39.759> pulley<00:01:40.030> lines<00:01:40.479> up<00:01:40.840> with<00:01:41.079> the<00:01:41.229> split<00:01:41.530> in

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:41.649 
on the pulley lines up with the split in

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:45.569 
on the pulley lines up with the split in
the<00:01:41.740> case<00:01:42.009> you<00:01:42.399> hear<00:01:43.299> the<00:01:43.509> sound<00:01:43.780> stopped<00:01:44.579> so

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:45.579 
the case you hear the sound stopped so

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:47.370 
the case you hear the sound stopped so
you<00:01:45.700> want<00:01:45.850> to<00:01:45.939> find<00:01:46.119> that<00:01:46.360> point<00:01:46.719> precisely

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
you want to find that point precisely

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.100 
you want to find that point precisely
where<00:01:48.369> the<00:01:48.549> sound<00:01:48.819> stops<00:01:49.270> and<00:01:49.659> how<00:01:49.719> the<00:01:49.810> points

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.110 
where the sound stops and how the points

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.319 
where the sound stops and how the points
are<00:01:50.200> closed<00:01:50.469> again<00:01:50.729> excuse<00:01:51.729> me<00:01:51.850> they're<00:01:52.000> open

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:52.329 
are closed again excuse me they're open

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:55.830 
are closed again excuse me they're open
still<00:01:53.729> and<00:01:54.729> now<00:01:54.850> they're<00:01:55.060> closed<00:01:55.390> you<00:01:55.719> give

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
still and now they're closed you give

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.229 
still and now they're closed you give
the<00:01:55.990> sound<00:01:57.450> and<00:01:58.450> here<00:01:58.689> come<00:01:58.840> the<00:01:58.869> timing<00:01:59.380> marks

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:00.239 
the sound and here come the timing marks

00:02:00.239 --> 00:02:02.899 
the sound and here come the timing marks
now<00:02:01.239> I<00:02:01.299> can't<00:02:01.659> hold<00:02:01.840> the<00:02:02.020> camera<00:02:02.560> and

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
now I can't hold the camera and

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.479 
now I can't hold the camera and
precisely<00:02:03.909> study<00:02:04.450> the<00:02:04.689> marks<00:02:05.079> but<00:02:05.380> you<00:02:06.340> would

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:06.489 
precisely study the marks but you would

00:02:06.489 --> 00:02:10.740 
precisely study the marks but you would
just<00:02:06.640> bump<00:02:06.970> it<00:02:08.970> until<00:02:09.970> you<00:02:10.060> find<00:02:10.299> the<00:02:10.450> exact

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
just bump it until you find the exact

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:35.370 
just bump it until you find the exact
point<00:02:11.110> that<00:02:11.230> the<00:02:11.470> sound<00:02:11.769> stops

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:39.210 

so<00:02:36.380> there<00:02:36.560> it<00:02:36.710> is<00:02:37.100> so<00:02:37.730> at<00:02:38.270> this<00:02:38.450> point<00:02:38.720> two

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
so there it is so at this point two

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.480 
so there it is so at this point two
points<00:02:40.220> open<00:02:40.880> that<00:02:41.300> will<00:02:41.510> fire<00:02:41.750> the<00:02:42.020> spark<00:02:42.500> and

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:43.490 
points open that will fire the spark and

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:47.950 
points open that will fire the spark and
we<00:02:43.520> compare<00:02:45.610> the<00:02:46.610> timing<00:02:47.060> mark<00:02:47.300> on<00:02:47.540> the<00:02:47.750> pulley

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:47.960 
we compare the timing mark on the pulley

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:51.420 
we compare the timing mark on the pulley
to<00:02:48.440> the<00:02:48.650> split<00:02:49.040> in<00:02:49.250> the<00:02:49.280> engine<00:02:49.880> cases<00:02:50.360> and

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
to the split in the engine cases and

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.420 
to the split in the engine cases and
what's<00:02:52.430> more<00:02:52.700> this<00:02:52.910> will<00:02:53.120> work<00:02:53.300> on<00:02:53.600> any

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
what's more this will work on any

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.770 
what's more this will work on any
vehicle<00:02:55.430> I<00:02:55.550> can<00:02:55.760> imagine<00:02:56.030> with<00:02:56.750> a

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
vehicle I can imagine with a
