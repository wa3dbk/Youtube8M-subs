00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
hello guys in this video I'm gonna

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.280 
hello guys in this video I'm gonna
demonstrate<00:00:05.490> how<00:00:06.180> to<00:00:06.359> make<00:00:07.940> how<00:00:08.940> to<00:00:09.000> make<00:00:09.960> a

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
demonstrate how to make how to make a

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.910 
demonstrate how to make how to make a
look<00:00:11.120> for<00:00:12.120> your<00:00:12.540> top<00:00:12.840> corners<00:00:13.410> or<00:00:13.650> in<00:00:13.769> this

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
look for your top corners or in this

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.359 
look for your top corners or in this
case<00:00:14.160> of<00:00:14.400> honcho<00:00:14.910> corners<00:00:15.450> so<00:00:16.199> you<00:00:16.260> can<00:00:16.529> make<00:00:16.740> a

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
case of honcho corners so you can make a

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.260 
case of honcho corners so you can make a
tarp<00:00:18.240> shelter<00:00:18.810> kind<00:00:19.650> of<00:00:19.800> thing<00:00:20.010> and<00:00:20.939> you<00:00:21.060> know

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:21.270 
tarp shelter kind of thing and you know

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.990 
tarp shelter kind of thing and you know
that<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.660> grommets<00:00:21.900> are<00:00:22.289> really<00:00:22.830> fragile<00:00:23.369> if

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
that the grommets are really fragile if

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.849 
that the grommets are really fragile if
you<00:00:24.180> put<00:00:24.449> some<00:00:24.689> tension<00:00:24.960> here<00:00:25.470> you<00:00:25.590> might

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
you put some tension here you might

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.870 
you put some tension here you might
break<00:00:26.070> them<00:00:26.310> up<00:00:26.539> so<00:00:27.539> what<00:00:27.720> I<00:00:27.750> came<00:00:28.080> up<00:00:28.260> with<00:00:28.880> are

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
break them up so what I came up with are

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.790 
break them up so what I came up with are
a<00:00:30.800> type<00:00:31.800> of<00:00:31.830> loop<00:00:32.369> using<00:00:33.200> duct<00:00:34.200> tape<00:00:34.230> or<00:00:34.710> in

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
a type of loop using duct tape or in

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.560 
a type of loop using duct tape or in
this<00:00:34.950> case<00:00:35.190> Gorilla<00:00:35.579> Tape<00:00:35.760> width<00:00:36.149> which<00:00:36.540> is

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
this case Gorilla Tape width which is

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.510 
this case Gorilla Tape width which is
way<00:00:37.140> stronger<00:00:38.120> to<00:00:39.120> make<00:00:39.329> the<00:00:39.590> the<00:00:40.590> loop<00:00:40.829> to<00:00:41.280> tie

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
way stronger to make the the loop to tie

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.540 
way stronger to make the the loop to tie
your<00:00:41.700> lines<00:00:42.210> and<00:00:42.570> to<00:00:42.960> put<00:00:43.620> some<00:00:43.649> tension<00:00:44.129> on<00:00:44.489> it

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
your lines and to put some tension on it

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:49.250 
your lines and to put some tension on it
and<00:00:44.989> prevent<00:00:46.039> the<00:00:47.039> poncho<00:00:47.789> from<00:00:47.940> ripping<00:00:48.450> so

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
and prevent the poncho from ripping so

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.850 
and prevent the poncho from ripping so
the<00:00:49.379> first<00:00:49.680> step<00:00:50.250> is<00:00:50.910> gonna<00:00:51.180> be<00:00:51.710> you're<00:00:52.710> gonna

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
the first step is gonna be you're gonna

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.799 
the first step is gonna be you're gonna
need<00:00:53.100> about<00:00:54.620> 18<00:00:55.620> inches<00:00:55.890> of<00:00:56.399> duct<00:00:56.640> tape<00:00:56.809> or

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
need about 18 inches of duct tape or

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.640 
need about 18 inches of duct tape or
Gorilla<00:00:58.140> Tape<00:00:58.789> the<00:00:59.789> first<00:01:00.090> step<00:01:01.190> is<00:01:02.190> you<00:01:02.340> gonna

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:03.650 
Gorilla Tape the first step is you gonna

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:09.219 
Gorilla Tape the first step is you gonna
stick<00:01:04.650> about<00:01:05.250> six<00:01:06.240> inches<00:01:06.659> in<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.500> corner

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 
stick about six inches in the corner

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.830 
stick about six inches in the corner
like<00:01:10.229> so<00:01:10.290> I<00:01:10.909> think<00:01:11.909> this<00:01:12.060> was<00:01:12.270> like<00:01:12.600> five

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
like so I think this was like five

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.440 
like so I think this was like five
inches<00:01:13.080> five<00:01:14.010> six<00:01:14.369> inches<00:01:14.729> it's<00:01:14.909> okay<00:01:17.450> and

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
inches five six inches it's okay and

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.090 
inches five six inches it's okay and
then<00:01:18.600> you're<00:01:18.750> gonna<00:01:18.900> turn<00:01:19.259> around<00:01:19.880> the<00:01:20.880> poncho

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.399 

and<00:01:24.580> you're<00:01:24.760> gonna<00:01:24.940> need<00:01:25.270> unlike<00:01:25.780> about

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:26.409 
and you're gonna need unlike about

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:30.090 
and you're gonna need unlike about
another<00:01:26.800> six<00:01:27.250> inches<00:01:27.400> here<00:01:27.909> and<00:01:28.950> then<00:01:29.950> an

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
another six inches here and then an

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.810 
another six inches here and then an
extra<00:01:30.520> six<00:01:30.909> inches<00:01:31.360> over<00:01:31.659> here<00:01:32.580> so<00:01:33.580> I'm<00:01:33.640> going

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820 
extra six inches over here so I'm going

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:44.190 
extra six inches over here so I'm going
to<00:01:33.880> cut<00:01:34.120> a<00:01:34.450> little<00:01:35.050> bit<00:01:35.380> more<00:01:37.320> gonna<00:01:38.320> cut<00:01:38.560> there

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:50.819 

okay<00:01:45.490> now<00:01:46.490> the<00:01:46.549> next<00:01:47.000> part<00:01:47.570> is<00:01:47.869> a<00:01:47.960> tricky<00:01:48.530> part

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:50.829 

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:55.539 

you<00:01:51.829> have<00:01:52.069> to<00:01:52.100> measure<00:01:53.859> the<00:01:54.859> tape<00:01:55.130> that<00:01:55.369> you're

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:55.549 
you have to measure the tape that you're

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:59.679 
you have to measure the tape that you're
gonna<00:01:55.780> seek<00:01:57.039> from<00:01:58.039> the<00:01:58.100> other<00:01:58.369> side<00:01:58.729> and<00:01:59.119> the

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689 
gonna seek from the other side and the

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:03.399 
gonna seek from the other side and the
tape<00:01:59.899> that<00:02:00.110> speak<00:02:00.469> that's<00:02:01.039> gonna<00:02:01.250> be<00:02:02.140> the<00:02:03.140> loop

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409 
tape that speak that's gonna be the loop

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:07.660 
tape that speak that's gonna be the loop
itself<00:02:04.600> you<00:02:05.600> measure<00:02:05.840> half<00:02:06.259> which<00:02:07.130> is<00:02:07.159> about

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
itself you measure half which is about

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:13.020 
itself you measure half which is about
here<00:02:08.440> and<00:02:09.440> you<00:02:09.619> bend<00:02:09.920> the<00:02:10.429> sides<00:02:10.759> carefully

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
here and you bend the sides carefully

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:18.080 
here and you bend the sides carefully
like<00:02:14.030> this

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.809 

bend<00:02:18.660> them<00:02:18.870> to<00:02:18.900> stick<00:02:19.830> them<00:02:19.980> to<00:02:20.190> the<00:02:20.220> center<00:02:20.670> of

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
bend them to stick them to the center of

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:29.270 
bend them to stick them to the center of
the<00:02:20.940> tape<00:02:22.880> and<00:02:23.880> such<00:02:25.970> and<00:02:26.970> I<00:02:28.010> don't<00:02:29.010> know<00:02:29.190> if

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
the tape and such and I don't know if

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.760 
the tape and such and I don't know if
you<00:02:29.370> can<00:02:29.580> see<00:02:29.819> now<00:02:30.060> it's<00:02:30.300> taking<00:02:30.959> form<00:02:31.380> it's

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
you can see now it's taking form it's

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:37.550 
you can see now it's taking form it's
going<00:02:31.950> to<00:02:32.069> go<00:02:32.160> like<00:02:32.340> this<00:02:32.840> so<00:02:35.450> you<00:02:36.450> take<00:02:37.140> these

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
going to go like this so you take these

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.780 
going to go like this so you take these
parts<00:02:38.040> right<00:02:38.130> here<00:02:40.220> and<00:02:41.220> then<00:02:41.370> you<00:02:41.489> start

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
parts right here and then you start

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:47.470 
parts right here and then you start
sticking<00:02:42.380> the<00:02:43.380> rest<00:02:43.880> like<00:02:44.880> this

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.230 

it's<00:02:48.480> not<00:02:48.660> a<00:02:48.690> perfect<00:02:49.050> times<00:02:49.500> you<00:02:49.830> know<00:02:50.240> it's

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:51.240 
it's not a perfect times you know it's

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.480 
it's not a perfect times you know it's
difficult<00:02:51.870> to<00:02:52.020> work<00:02:52.170> with<00:02:52.230> this<00:02:52.620> this<00:02:53.040> kind<00:02:53.340> of

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490 
difficult to work with this this kind of

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:59.360 
difficult to work with this this kind of
sticky<00:02:53.940> tape<00:02:56.480> now<00:02:57.530> you're<00:02:58.530> gonna<00:02:58.770> have<00:02:59.010> to<00:02:59.070> cut

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
sticky tape now you're gonna have to cut

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.350 
sticky tape now you're gonna have to cut
a<00:02:59.400> strip<00:03:00.080> to<00:03:01.080> paste<00:03:01.410> to<00:03:01.830> stick<00:03:02.700> on<00:03:02.910> this<00:03:03.090> side

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:03.360 
a strip to paste to stick on this side

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.360 
a strip to paste to stick on this side
to<00:03:03.870> prevent<00:03:04.230> the<00:03:04.380> two<00:03:04.560> sides<00:03:04.800> from<00:03:05.070> sticking

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
to prevent the two sides from sticking

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:17.410 
to prevent the two sides from sticking
together<00:03:09.709> you<00:03:10.709> just<00:03:10.860> cut<00:03:11.250> yourself<00:03:11.400> a<00:03:11.790> piece

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:21.949 

and<00:03:18.980> stick<00:03:19.980> it<00:03:20.220> in<00:03:20.489> the<00:03:20.550> opposite<00:03:21.330> side<00:03:21.630> of<00:03:21.660> the

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
and stick it in the opposite side of the

duct of the Gorilla Tape try to be to

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:32.840 
duct of the Gorilla Tape try to be to
leave<00:03:27.720> it<00:03:27.840> as<00:03:28.020> centered<00:03:28.709> as<00:03:28.950> possible<00:03:31.550> up<00:03:32.550> to

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
leave it as centered as possible up to

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.780 
leave it as centered as possible up to
the<00:03:33.000> edge<00:03:33.209> where<00:03:33.720> you<00:03:33.780> bend<00:03:34.500> the<00:03:35.100> other<00:03:35.280> side

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
the edge where you bend the other side

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:51.850 
the edge where you bend the other side
like<00:03:37.390> this<00:03:38.010> then<00:03:39.010> you<00:03:39.189> cut<00:03:39.430> the<00:03:39.810> leftover

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:19.790 
is really strong just put some pressure

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
is really strong just put some pressure
on<00:04:20.180> both<00:04:20.360> sides<00:04:20.750> and<00:04:22.180> what<00:04:23.180> you<00:04:23.330> do<00:04:23.510> with<00:04:23.660> this

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:34.850 

and<00:04:32.309> cut<00:04:32.639> it<00:04:32.669> like<00:04:32.939> this<00:04:33.199> it<00:04:34.199> might<00:04:34.379> be<00:04:34.559> easier

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
and cut it like this it might be easier

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:35.809 
and cut it like this it might be easier
with<00:04:35.039> a<00:04:35.069> sharp<00:04:35.369> knife

00:04:35.809 --> 00:04:35.819 
with a sharp knife

00:04:35.819 --> 00:04:52.760 
with a sharp knife
be<00:04:36.629> very<00:04:36.869> careful<00:04:42.800> slowly<00:04:45.289> carefully

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:59.240 

just<00:04:53.460> enough<00:04:56.360> so<00:04:57.360> that<00:04:57.389> you<00:04:57.810> don't<00:04:57.990> cut<00:04:58.259> start

00:04:59.240 --> 00:04:59.250 
just enough so that you don't cut start

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:02.119 
just enough so that you don't cut start
cutting<00:04:59.580> this<00:04:59.789> part<00:05:00.090> and<00:05:00.690> then<00:05:01.590> just<00:05:01.830> simply

00:05:02.119 --> 00:05:02.129 
cutting this part and then just simply

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:11.420 
cutting this part and then just simply
clip<00:05:03.120> it<00:05:03.300> and<00:05:03.770> stick<00:05:04.770> it<00:05:07.039> can<00:05:08.039> you<00:05:08.159> do<00:05:08.340> that<00:05:10.430> on

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.430 
clip it and stick it can you do that on

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:19.960 
clip it and stick it can you do that on
the<00:05:11.610> other<00:05:11.729> side<00:05:12.120> as<00:05:12.300> well

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:19.970 

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:25.850 

carefully<00:05:22.849> and<00:05:23.960> this<00:05:24.960> also<00:05:25.169> acts<00:05:25.500> as<00:05:25.800> a

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:25.860 
carefully and this also acts as a

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:29.080 
carefully and this also acts as a
reinforcement

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:29.090 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:36.460 

makes<00:05:29.750> it<00:05:29.960> stronger

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:36.470 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:41.470 

so<00:05:36.890> there<00:05:37.070> you<00:05:37.190> have<00:05:37.220> it<00:05:39.880> just<00:05:40.880> simply<00:05:41.240> taya

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:41.480 
so there you have it just simply taya

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:46.720 
so there you have it just simply taya
