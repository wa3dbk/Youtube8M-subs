00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.390

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.640
 variety and for this, everything has 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.840
 a very big change that will also 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.160
 I'll tell you what happens 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:39.719

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.320
 then what this will help what will 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.239
 to change 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.370
 They will help me a lot with support. 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.170
 consultancy to improve the channel for 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.000
 help in producing the videos too 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.120
 but I think it's better than I am for 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.760
 To speak this is the director of tgs Brazil 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.309
 that vanessa is how you connect the 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.309
 This is me, I came here to talk a little 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.739
 ee channel is entering tse is 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.660
 very excited about this news and the 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.369
 people will come in with everything on top of a 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.080
 channel to help you with production of 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.420
 content structure all things you 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.619
 needs to grow in the market that is a 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.630
 thing that we are doing with 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.070
 several other personal channels have 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.890
 connected to give advice on the 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.320
 audiovisual script we think 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.729
 complete a channel we do not think about 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.040
 number we think the number 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.420
 an important consequence and the person is 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.570
 no one is coming in now with everything 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.619
 it was good bar is exactly now is it 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.600
 It is also very important to say that now 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.240
 yes it is a partnership of same relationship 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.070
 partnership right where not only are numbers type 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.570
 run preview for they will pay 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.729
 so we do not want to improve the 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.140
 quality of the channel is to bring 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.600
 a better content for you content 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.189
 coolest and not only my channel as 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.049
 of all partner channels is also 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.540
 This works very interconnected. 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.369
 everyone together is the network the idea of 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.960
 network is that people are good for 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.850
 strengthen the Brazilian market is 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.760
 a plan is much bigger 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.440
 it's to Brasil 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.570
 network is in Brazil with a team 

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.950
 Brazilian all service in Portuguese 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.230
 people can visit the people in the 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.000
 office if you want to meet and our 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:06.050
 idea is to strengthen this market 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.300
 so the work he is doing 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.890
 with companies with youtube with the agency 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.300
 to teach that youtube can 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.550
 show people who have a potential 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.440
 very large here in the same way 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.810
 what happens outside we want 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.810
 grow a lot and I think when one after 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.340
 the other is is is well beyond what the 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.960
 people can imagine that before we 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.120
 had a very passive relationship of only 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.470
 make the video on youtube and stay 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.510
 That's okay some in October 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.280
 got spotlight on home suddenly 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.810
 we are happy for this but now he 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.580
 want the Brazilian youtube and 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:36.500
 grow as a whole is this and also 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.940
 especially here in Brazil 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.190
 youtube gamers nÃ© 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.020
 There are certainly many people there today. 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:43.670
 I was wrong, youtube, because I come 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.130
 thinking that asking the same thing as 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.390
 I think people read youtube 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.490
 letting you perform with a 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.770
 television and thousands of HD channels 

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:53.600
 possibility all with quality is that 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:55.370
 We are running behind and then the 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.870
 Guys, how are you going to work the ball anymore? 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.820
 so what we can start 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:01.280
 People turn this video off and start another 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:08.270
 That's good, everyone never had access 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:12.530
 it's just not normal not to leave it alone here 

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:14.920
 no natural channel I'm looking for is a 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.920
 Shit
