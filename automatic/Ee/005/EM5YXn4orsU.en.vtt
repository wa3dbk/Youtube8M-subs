00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
we're going to translate that to this

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.670 
we're going to translate that to this
year<00:02:12.250> and<00:02:12.430> hopefully<00:02:13.090> turn<00:02:14.050> these<00:02:14.260> practices

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
year and hopefully turn these practices

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.290 
year and hopefully turn these practices
and<00:02:14.860> stuff<00:02:14.950> like<00:02:15.100> that<00:02:15.160> we<00:02:15.400> give<00:02:15.550> better<00:02:15.760> and

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
and stuff like that we give better and

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.060 
and stuff like that we give better and
don't<00:02:16.570> do<00:02:17.200> them<00:02:17.320> to<00:02:17.410> six<00:02:17.590> that<00:02:17.710> we<00:02:17.800> did<00:02:17.950> last
