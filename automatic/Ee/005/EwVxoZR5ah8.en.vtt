00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.380
Now here comes the second no bake dessert recipe

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:14.680
It can’t be more easier than this

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.680
Once you know how it is made

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.620
you will surely stop eating from outside

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.620
and start doing it by yourself

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.120
Panna Cotta with Raspberry Sauce

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:26.780
Let’s begin!

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:28.840
First of all

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.420
soak sheets of gelatin in a bowl full of ice

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.960
While waiting for them to soften

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.560
cook whipped cream and milk in a saucepan

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:55.740
with a proportion of 3 to 1

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.740
720 ml. of cream

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:03.200
and 240 ml. of fresh milk

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.500
With this amount, we can prepare 10 servings

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.340
Turn on the heat

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:17.500
using low heat

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.500
All are in

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.200
Add sugar, 120 gram.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.560
Stir until all are dissolved

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.140
Leave it like this

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.660
Now let’s get on with vanilla

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.660
I’m using a vanilla bean

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.000
But if it’s difficult to find, or pricey

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.080
you can opt for vanilla extract

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.080
which is in a liquid form, comes in a bottle

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.160
Now cut it in the center of the bean

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.460
I have quite a big vanilla bean today

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.660
so only half of it is enough

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:06.460
With a sharp side of the knife scrape the vanilla caviar as you run the knife down the bean

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.460
Put the vanilla caviar in the saucepan, followed by the bean

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.920
And cook them together with milk and cream

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.380
Only if you can smell this

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:29.800
it’s absolutely fantastic

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.200
I’ve prepared the vanilla mixture

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.640
Now let’s come back to the gelatins to see if they are soft enough

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.240
Here they are

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.600
Squeeze out the excess water

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:48.180
And they are ready to use

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.960
Place the gelatins in the vanilla mixture

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.680
Stir well

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.220
They are quickly dissolved

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:58.220
Once gelatin is loosen

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:01.180
it will melt away easily in hot milk

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.340
Turn off the heat

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:09.820
To make sure that all the mixture is smooth enough

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:11.820
I’m going to sift it

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.960
We can get every bit of vanilla caviar by doing this

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.180
You can use any type of glasses available at home

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.580
I have a variety of glasses here

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.620
They don’t have to be exactly the same

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.620
Pour the mixture into each glass

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.720
but don’t fill it up

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.720
as we will add raspberry sauce on top later

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:53.660
Raspberry sauce will be added after Panna Cotta is completely set

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:58.340
You can simply fill a layer of raspberry sauce and get it served right away

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.040
Do you know why we need to pour it very lightly?

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:08.720
Panna Cotta is made of gelatin

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.880
While we’re pouring it

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.520
if the mixture splashes and sticks on any area

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.800
it will become stiff later

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.640
So I’m trying to pour it with care

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.480
without any mess on the edge

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:25.060
in order to create a nice Panna Cotta once it’s set

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.540
Meanwhile, let’s make raspberry sauce

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.320
You can use frozen raspberries which we will need 350 gram

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.960
Blend it with sugar, 1 tablespoon of lime juice

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.020
This is enough

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.020
Blend it thoroughly

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.300
And ready now

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.220
This is absolutely easy right?

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:03.580
I need to sift it because there are hard seeds in raspberries

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.300
Filter the seeds out to smoothen the sauce

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.060
And it will look like this

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.060
We’ve finished the raspberry sauce

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:14.240
Simple as that

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.060
Keep it in the fridge first

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.980
Now it’s three hours already

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:28.760
Panna Cotta is perfectly set

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:32.880
After Panna Cotta cooled down

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:37.340
I wrapped it with cling film to prevent a stiff surface

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:44.360
Coolness from the fridge causes a hard layer on top

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.360
It won’t be smooth

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.100
So be careful about this

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:53.320
Now remove the cling film

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:00.420
Turn it upside down

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:01.580
Oh my

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:07.460
Everything is ready so let’s incorporate them

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:08.880
And here we go

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:26.500
Panna Cotta with Raspberry Sauce

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:28.100
Have a taste

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:34.660
Wow

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:37.380
Usually I will share my food with the team

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:40.880
But this is all mine

00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:48.660
So soft

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:54.780
Next, let’s try cooking another famous dessert Banoffee

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:56.960
It’s so easy to cook and so delicious that

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.940
I don’t want you to miss. I’ll be back in a moment
