00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:14.309
 take a sheet of A4 size and loot 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:16.490
 the hm2 must be the most accurate 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.490
 possible 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.170
 open 

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:36.390
 now make a mark for 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.390
 measure a quarter 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.180
 do the same thing on the other side 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:02.170
 you have to bend from this bus until 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.170
 this tip here 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.670
 this folding requires a lot of precision 

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:24.290
 do the same thing on the other side 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.050
 now you take this point of 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:55.640
 landmark in the center and you have to pay a 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.640
 the first end top 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.110
 always be precise 

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:15.049
 from this first fold it is necessary 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.049
 start walking 8 times 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:25.849
 hold the paper well so they 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.849
 remain tense during this process 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.750
 once it's done you have to bend the 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:05.750
 all in two like this 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:19.300
 now you have to make wings 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:22.620
 then and like this taking a space 

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.620
 corresponding roughly to a finger 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:38.980
 it's exactly the same thing 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.980
 the other side 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:58.720
 you have to bend the tips of the wings go 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.040
 on this side while keeping the tip and 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.480
 the tip must be the most parallel 

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.480
 possible at the back of the plane 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.480
 do the same thing on the other side 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.500
 you finished your paper airplane
