have the galaxy tab s 10.5 now obviously

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.310 
have the galaxy tab s 10.5 now obviously
the<00:00:32.759> tab<00:00:33.000> is<00:00:33.270> going<00:00:33.720> to<00:00:33.810> be<00:00:33.900> a<00:00:33.930> little<00:00:34.140> bit

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
the tab is going to be a little bit

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.010 
the tab is going to be a little bit
bigger<00:00:34.530> but<00:00:34.980> the<00:00:35.340> nexus<00:00:35.790> 9<00:00:35.940> is<00:00:36.240> in<00:00:36.390> between<00:00:36.780> the

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
bigger but the nexus 9 is in between the

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.190 
bigger but the nexus 9 is in between the
size<00:00:37.289> between<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.579> 8.4<00:00:39.420> inch<00:00:39.480> tablet<00:00:40.020> and

size between the 8.4 inch tablet and

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.250 
size between the 8.4 inch tablet and
10.5<00:00:40.950> now<00:00:41.789> these<00:00:42.149> are<00:00:42.300> going<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.449> be<00:00:42.539> different

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
10.5 now these are going to be different

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.490 
10.5 now these are going to be different
but<00:00:43.770> yet<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.550> tab<00:00:44.820> at<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.449> nexus<00:00:46.020> 9<00:00:46.199> is

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
but yet the tab at the nexus 9 is

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.410 
but yet the tab at the nexus 9 is
supposed<00:00:46.860> to<00:00:46.980> take<00:00:47.129> on<00:00:47.370> all<00:00:47.610> android

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
supposed to take on all android

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:49.639 
supposed to take on all android
competitors<00:00:48.840> and<00:00:49.020> that's<00:00:49.260> what<00:00:49.440> we're<00:00:49.559> here

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
competitors and that's what we're here

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.240 
competitors and that's what we're here
to<00:00:49.710> see<00:00:49.980> just<00:00:50.430> how<00:00:50.609> it<00:00:50.820> does<00:00:51.000> against<00:00:51.570> the

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
to see just how it does against the

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.279 
to see just how it does against the
reigning<00:00:53.250> one<00:00:53.640> in<00:00:53.940> terms<00:00:54.600> of<00:00:54.809> overall

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
reigning one in terms of overall

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.549 
reigning one in terms of overall
productivity<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:56.660> overall<00:00:57.660> obviously<00:00:58.440> the

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
productivity and overall obviously the

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.189 
productivity and overall obviously the
best<00:00:58.739> screen<00:00:59.120> now<00:01:00.120> let's<00:01:00.750> see<00:01:00.899> how<00:01:01.079> they

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
best screen now let's see how they

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.790 
best screen now let's see how they
compare<00:01:01.289> just<00:01:01.829> in<00:01:01.949> terms<00:01:02.129> of<00:01:02.280> size<00:01:03.080> so<00:01:04.080> for

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:04.800 
compare just in terms of size so for

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.440 
compare just in terms of size so for
size<00:01:05.010> the<00:01:05.430> first<00:01:05.670> thing<00:01:05.820> we<00:01:05.910> want<00:01:06.120> to<00:01:06.210> point

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
size the first thing we want to point

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.390 
size the first thing we want to point
out<00:01:06.600> is<00:01:06.840> obviously<00:01:07.320> how<00:01:07.590> I<00:01:07.620> have<00:01:07.950> both<00:01:08.220> these

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
out is obviously how I have both these

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.789 
out is obviously how I have both these
tablets<00:01:08.880> one<00:01:09.540> is<00:01:09.689> in<00:01:09.869> portrait<00:01:10.320> and<00:01:10.470> one<00:01:10.619> is<00:01:10.770> in

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
tablets one is in portrait and one is in

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.910 
tablets one is in portrait and one is in
landscape<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:12.600> reason<00:01:13.350> why<00:01:13.530> that<00:01:13.710> is<00:01:13.890> is

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
landscape and the reason why that is is

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.399 
landscape and the reason why that is is
because<00:01:14.130> this<00:01:14.580> is<00:01:14.790> a<00:01:14.820> 4<00:01:15.180> by<00:01:15.360> 3<00:01:15.390> ratio<00:01:15.840> whereas

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
because this is a 4 by 3 ratio whereas

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.160 
because this is a 4 by 3 ratio whereas
this<00:01:16.560> is<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:16.799> 16<00:01:17.250> by<00:01:17.430> 9<00:01:17.700> so<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.780> ideal<00:01:19.080> way

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
this is a 16 by 9 so the ideal way

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.020 
this is a 16 by 9 so the ideal way
you're<00:01:19.650> going<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:19.860> be<00:01:19.920> holding<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:20.369> Nexus<00:01:20.820> is

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
you're going to be holding the Nexus is

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.719 
you're going to be holding the Nexus is
going<00:01:21.390> to<00:01:21.509> be<00:01:21.630> at<00:01:21.810> this<00:01:22.229> portrait<00:01:23.009> mode<00:01:23.400> and

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
going to be at this portrait mode and

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.550 
going to be at this portrait mode and
the<00:01:24.479> ideal<00:01:24.720> way<00:01:24.780> you're<00:01:25.049> going<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.259> be<00:01:25.380> holding

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
the ideal way you're going to be holding

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.149 
the ideal way you're going to be holding
the<00:01:26.070> Samsung<00:01:26.610> is<00:01:26.790> in<00:01:27.000> a<00:01:27.090> landscape<00:01:27.659> mode

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:28.159 
the Samsung is in a landscape mode

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:30.530 
the Samsung is in a landscape mode
reason<00:01:29.159> for<00:01:29.340> this<00:01:29.460> is<00:01:29.640> because<00:01:29.670> this<00:01:30.270> is<00:01:30.450> the

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
reason for this is because this is the

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.179 
reason for this is because this is the
way<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.840> ratios<00:01:31.320> are<00:01:31.530> meant<00:01:31.710> to<00:01:31.829> be<00:01:31.860> used

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
way the ratios are meant to be used

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.240 
way the ratios are meant to be used
however<00:01:32.909> of<00:01:33.240> course<00:01:33.509> you<00:01:33.720> can<00:01:34.049> do<00:01:34.380> both<00:01:34.890> in

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
however of course you can do both in

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.090 
however of course you can do both in
their<00:01:35.520> opposing<00:01:35.850> side<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.380> Nexus<00:01:37.799> will

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
their opposing side and the Nexus will

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.609 
their opposing side and the Nexus will
work<00:01:38.430> and<00:01:38.700> forbye<00:01:39.119> through<00:01:39.450> and<00:01:39.869> landscape

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
work and forbye through and landscape

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.370 
work and forbye through and landscape
and<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:41.640> samsung<00:01:42.509> will<00:01:42.659> work<00:01:42.869> in<00:01:43.020> portrait

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
and the samsung will work in portrait

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.260 
and the samsung will work in portrait
but<00:01:43.770> as<00:01:43.860> you<00:01:43.920> can<00:01:44.009> see<00:01:44.220> they<00:01:44.369> just<00:01:44.579> don't<00:01:44.759> look

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
but as you can see they just don't look

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.319 
but as you can see they just don't look
right<00:01:45.329> they<00:01:46.200> are<00:01:46.350> meant<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:46.860> be<00:01:46.890> held<00:01:47.759> like

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
right they are meant to be held like

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.480 
right they are meant to be held like
this<00:01:48.780> and<00:01:49.200> now<00:01:49.649> that<00:01:49.829> we<00:01:49.890> have<00:01:49.920> that<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:50.369> way

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
this and now that we have that the way

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.200 
this and now that we have that the way
let's<00:01:50.729> see<00:01:50.969> which<00:01:51.240> one<00:01:51.420> is<00:01:51.689> wider<00:01:52.170> thicker<00:01:52.770> and

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:53.210 
let's see which one is wider thicker and

00:01:53.210 --> 00:02:01.149 
let's see which one is wider thicker and
longer<00:01:54.560> so<00:01:55.560> in<00:01:55.799> terms<00:01:56.610> of<00:01:56.909> these<00:01:57.899> two<00:01:58.259> devices

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:01.159 

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:05.539 

you<00:02:02.159> have<00:02:02.520> a<00:02:02.930> big<00:02:03.930> height<00:02:04.170> difference<00:02:04.710> between

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
you have a big height difference between

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.219 
you have a big height difference between
them<00:02:05.759> because<00:02:06.149> of<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.719> screen<00:02:07.049> size

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
them because of the screen size

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:12.290 
them because of the screen size
difference<00:02:07.680> so<00:02:08.430> we<00:02:08.880> have<00:02:09.180> the<00:02:09.990> nexus<00:02:11.090> going<00:02:12.090> to

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
difference so we have the nexus going to

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.530 
difference so we have the nexus going to
be<00:02:12.510> at<00:02:12.750> a<00:02:13.200> shorter<00:02:14.130> size<00:02:14.400> and
