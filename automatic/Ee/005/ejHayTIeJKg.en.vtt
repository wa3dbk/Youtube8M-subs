hey guys level-cap here today we're
going<00:00:06.930> to<00:00:07.020> be<00:00:07.109> taking<00:00:07.440> a<00:00:07.500> look<00:00:07.620> at<00:00:07.770> the<00:00:08.000> ar160

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
going to be taking a look at the ar160

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.060 
going to be taking a look at the ar160
after<00:00:09.480> the<00:00:09.630> latest<00:00:09.840> battlefield<00:00:10.500> patch<00:00:10.769> this

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
after the latest battlefield patch this

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.799 
after the latest battlefield patch this
gun<00:00:11.250> has<00:00:11.370> gotten<00:00:11.610> a<00:00:11.670> nice<00:00:11.880> bit<00:00:12.420> of<00:00:12.450> an<00:00:12.660> upgrade

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
gun has gotten a nice bit of an upgrade

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.470 
gun has gotten a nice bit of an upgrade
to<00:00:13.200> its<00:00:13.380> recoil<00:00:13.920> which<00:00:14.309> makes<00:00:14.610> it<00:00:14.790> much<00:00:15.150> more

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
to its recoil which makes it much more

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.540 
to its recoil which makes it much more
effective<00:00:15.780> as<00:00:16.139> a<00:00:16.170> ranged<00:00:16.680> weapon<00:00:17.130> the<00:00:17.340> gun

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
effective as a ranged weapon the gun

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.340 
effective as a ranged weapon the gun
used<00:00:17.789> to<00:00:17.910> have<00:00:18.060> an<00:00:18.350> uncharacteristically

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
used to have an uncharacteristically

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.099 
used to have an uncharacteristically
high<00:00:19.740> point<00:00:20.369> five<00:00:20.699> vertical<00:00:21.150> recoil<00:00:21.510> this<00:00:21.900> has

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
high point five vertical recoil this has

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.590 
high point five vertical recoil this has
been<00:00:22.289> reduced<00:00:22.680> to<00:00:22.830> 0.23<00:00:23.490> so<00:00:24.090> the<00:00:24.210> vertical

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
been reduced to 0.23 so the vertical

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.779 
been reduced to 0.23 so the vertical
recoil<00:00:24.779> has<00:00:25.350> essentially<00:00:26.010> been<00:00:26.189> cut<00:00:26.519> in<00:00:26.760> half

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
recoil has essentially been cut in half

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.060 
recoil has essentially been cut in half
which<00:00:27.390> is<00:00:27.420> just<00:00:27.810> a<00:00:27.930> massive<00:00:28.619> massive

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
which is just a massive massive

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.890 
which is just a massive massive
improvement<00:00:29.820> to<00:00:29.939> the<00:00:30.060> controllability<00:00:30.660> of

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
improvement to the controllability of

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.810 
improvement to the controllability of
this<00:00:31.170> gun<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.619> side-to-side<00:00:31.980> recoil<00:00:32.369> was

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
this gun the side-to-side recoil was

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.299 
this gun the side-to-side recoil was
bumped<00:00:33.180> up<00:00:33.239> ever<00:00:33.510> so<00:00:34.020> slightly<00:00:34.469> not<00:00:34.890> too<00:00:35.130> big

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
bumped up ever so slightly not too big

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.010 
bumped up ever so slightly not too big
of<00:00:35.340> a<00:00:35.520> deal<00:00:35.700> so<00:00:35.730> basically<00:00:36.390> this<00:00:36.660> gun<00:00:36.840> is<00:00:36.899> going

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
of a deal so basically this gun is going

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.990 
of a deal so basically this gun is going
to<00:00:37.079> be<00:00:37.170> very<00:00:37.440> easy<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:38.010> control<00:00:38.309> there's<00:00:38.670> a<00:00:38.760> lot

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
to be very easy to control there's a lot

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.520 
to be very easy to control there's a lot
of<00:00:39.149> different<00:00:39.450> ways<00:00:39.570> to<00:00:39.629> set<00:00:40.079> up<00:00:40.200> this<00:00:40.350> gun

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
of different ways to set up this gun

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.500 
of different ways to set up this gun
depending<00:00:41.010> on<00:00:41.160> your<00:00:41.280> playstyle<00:00:41.760> as<00:00:42.210> you<00:00:42.360> can

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
depending on your playstyle as you can

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.119 
depending on your playstyle as you can
see<00:00:42.660> I'm<00:00:42.750> using<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:43.079> ACOG<00:00:43.559> sight<00:00:43.829> here

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
see I'm using the ACOG sight here

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.520 
see I'm using the ACOG sight here
because<00:00:44.520> now<00:00:44.940> that<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.390> visual<00:00:45.899> recoil<00:00:46.110> bug

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
because now that the visual recoil bug

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.440 
because now that the visual recoil bug
has<00:00:46.710> been<00:00:46.860> fixed<00:00:46.920> it's<00:00:47.610> now<00:00:47.730> a<00:00:47.760> very<00:00:48.090> effective

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
has been fixed it's now a very effective

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.180 
has been fixed it's now a very effective
sight<00:00:48.809> to<00:00:48.989> use<00:00:49.110> for<00:00:49.289> engaging<00:00:49.590> targets<00:00:50.070> at

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
sight to use for engaging targets at

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.850 
sight to use for engaging targets at
medium<00:00:50.640> and<00:00:50.850> longer<00:00:51.300> ranges<00:00:51.750> using<00:00:52.199> a<00:00:52.469> canted

medium and longer ranges using a canted
iron<00:00:53.129> sights<00:00:53.340> gives<00:00:53.579> you<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.850> option<00:00:54.270> to

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
iron sights gives you the option to

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.119 
iron sights gives you the option to
switch<00:00:54.600> back<00:00:54.840> to<00:00:54.870> a<00:00:55.050> close<00:00:55.410> quarter<00:00:55.739> optic

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
switch back to a close quarter optic

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.889 
switch back to a close quarter optic
just<00:00:56.789> in<00:00:56.940> case<00:00:57.120> you<00:00:57.270> need<00:00:57.449> to<00:00:57.480> deal<00:00:57.719> with

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
just in case you need to deal with

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.240 
just in case you need to deal with
somebody<00:00:58.230> right<00:00:58.469> in<00:00:58.500> your<00:00:58.680> face

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
somebody right in your face

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.040 
somebody right in your face
personally<00:00:59.879> I'm<00:01:00.059> not<00:01:00.270> a<00:01:00.300> huge<00:01:00.750> fan<00:01:00.840> of

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
personally I'm not a huge fan of

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.020 
personally I'm not a huge fan of
switching<00:01:01.530> between<00:01:01.680> optics<00:01:02.340> generally

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
switching between optics generally

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.490 
switching between optics generally
speaking<00:01:03.300> you<00:01:03.539> don't<00:01:03.570> have<00:01:03.809> too<00:01:04.049> much<00:01:04.199> time<00:01:04.439> to

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
speaking you don't have too much time to

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.590 
speaking you don't have too much time to
actually<00:01:04.949> anticipate<00:01:05.640> what<00:01:06.210> you're<00:01:06.420> going<00:01:06.540> to

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
actually anticipate what you're going to

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.149 
actually anticipate what you're going to
need<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:07.080> I<00:01:07.170> just<00:01:07.380> got<00:01:07.530> used<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:07.830> kind<00:01:08.070> of

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
need and I just got used to kind of

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.399 
need and I just got used to kind of
zooming<00:01:08.549> in<00:01:08.670> with<00:01:08.820> the<00:01:08.909> four<00:01:09.150> times<00:01:09.390> ACOG<00:01:09.930> when

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
zooming in with the four times ACOG when

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.620 
zooming in with the four times ACOG when
somebody<00:01:10.770> snuck<00:01:11.070> up<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.369> surprise<00:01:11.760> me<00:01:11.970> in<00:01:12.060> CQB

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
somebody snuck up and surprise me in CQB

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.240 
somebody snuck up and surprise me in CQB
now<00:01:12.869> understanding<00:01:13.560> the<00:01:13.680> status<00:01:13.860> of<00:01:14.100> the

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
now understanding the status of the

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.980 
now understanding the status of the
ar160<00:01:15.000> is<00:01:15.180> pretty<00:01:15.420> important<00:01:15.930> to

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
ar160 is pretty important to

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.420 
ar160 is pretty important to
understanding<00:01:16.619> how<00:01:16.830> you<00:01:16.890> should<00:01:17.220> play<00:01:17.400> with

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
understanding how you should play with

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.820 
understanding how you should play with
this<00:01:17.759> weapon<00:01:18.030> first<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:19.080> most<00:01:19.320> importantly

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
this weapon first and most importantly

this weapon first and most importantly
its<00:01:20.009> rate<00:01:20.189> of<00:01:20.220> fire<00:01:20.310> is<00:01:20.670> 700<00:01:21.330> rounds<00:01:21.689> per

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
its rate of fire is 700 rounds per

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.420 
its rate of fire is 700 rounds per
minute<00:01:22.110> this<00:01:22.409> means<00:01:22.680> you're<00:01:22.890> certainly<00:01:23.189> not

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
minute this means you're certainly not

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.859 
minute this means you're certainly not
going<00:01:23.580> to<00:01:23.670> be<00:01:23.759> a<00:01:23.790> powerhouse<00:01:24.360> in<00:01:24.420> close

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
going to be a powerhouse in close

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.510 
going to be a powerhouse in close
quarter<00:01:25.229> combat<00:01:25.259> if<00:01:25.890> you're<00:01:26.040> familiar<00:01:26.220> with

the all-gay 3 in battlefield 4

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:30.380 
the all-gay 3 in battlefield 4
it<00:01:28.710> does<00:01:28.920> the<00:01:29.040> exact<00:01:29.460> same<00:01:29.549> rate<00:01:29.909> of<00:01:30.030> fire<00:01:30.180> the

exact same damage per second as that

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.240 
exact same damage per second as that
weapon<00:01:32.909> it's<00:01:33.299> certainly<00:01:33.630> capable<00:01:33.930> in<00:01:34.439> CQB<00:01:35.009> but

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
weapon it's certainly capable in CQB but

to longer ranges you're really going to

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.359

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
all situations some maps are just too

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.139 
all situations some maps are just too
chaotic<00:01:52.560> and<00:01:52.979> sometimes<00:01:53.399> the<00:01:53.549> enemy<00:01:53.820> team<00:01:54.000> is

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
chaotic and sometimes the enemy team is

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.819 
chaotic and sometimes the enemy team is
just<00:01:54.420> destroying<00:01:54.840> you<00:01:55.229> and<00:01:55.259> you<00:01:55.530> don't<00:01:55.710> really

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
just destroying you and you don't really

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
have a line of defense in that situation

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.920 
have a line of defense in that situation
it's<00:01:58.829> perfectly<00:01:59.250> fine<00:01:59.610> to<00:01:59.670> ignore<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:00.689> gun

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
it's perfectly fine to ignore the gun

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:02.810 
it's perfectly fine to ignore the gun
that<00:02:01.229> you're<00:02:01.439> perhaps<00:02:01.829> trying<00:02:02.399> to<00:02:02.520> unlock

that you're perhaps trying to unlock
things<00:02:03.149> for<00:02:03.360> and<00:02:03.509> just<00:02:03.659> switch<00:02:03.810> over<00:02:04.079> to<00:02:04.110> a

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
things for and just switch over to a

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.749 
things for and just switch over to a
weapon<00:02:04.560> that's<00:02:04.680> going<00:02:04.829> to<00:02:04.890> be<00:02:04.979> more<00:02:05.310> suited

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
weapon that's going to be more suited

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.940 
weapon that's going to be more suited
for<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:06.090> situation<00:02:06.689> at<00:02:06.840> hand<00:02:07.079> now<00:02:07.439> I<00:02:07.469> did<00:02:07.770> try

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
for the situation at hand now I did try

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:09.440 
for the situation at hand now I did try
a<00:02:07.979> lot<00:02:08.220> of<00:02:08.250> different<00:02:08.399> setups<00:02:09.090> for<00:02:09.300> this

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
a lot of different setups for this

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.760 
a lot of different setups for this
weapon<00:02:09.750> as<00:02:09.869> you<00:02:09.989> can<00:02:10.110> see<00:02:10.229> here<00:02:10.379> I've<00:02:10.470> got<00:02:10.500> the

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
weapon as you can see here I've got the

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.740 
weapon as you can see here I've got the
angled<00:02:11.220> for<00:02:11.489> grip<00:02:11.700> later<00:02:11.970> I'll<00:02:12.180> be<00:02:12.209> changing

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
angled for grip later I'll be changing

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.350 
angled for grip later I'll be changing
it<00:02:12.870> up<00:02:12.989> to

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
it up to

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.760 
it up to
stubby<00:02:13.750> grip<00:02:13.780> and<00:02:14.170> I'll<00:02:14.230> be<00:02:14.350> using<00:02:14.650> different

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
stubby grip and I'll be using different

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.980 
stubby grip and I'll be using different
kinds<00:02:15.190> of<00:02:15.250> barrel<00:02:15.580> compensators<00:02:16.390> and<00:02:16.630> I<00:02:16.720> ended

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:16.990 
kinds of barrel compensators and I ended

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:18.960 
kinds of barrel compensators and I ended
up<00:02:17.110> really<00:02:17.350> enjoying<00:02:17.500> the<00:02:18.100> stubby<00:02:18.550> grip<00:02:18.580> and

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
up really enjoying the stubby grip and

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.030 
up really enjoying the stubby grip and
just<00:02:19.150> normal<00:02:19.540> compensator<00:02:20.230> combination

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
just normal compensator combination

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.380 
just normal compensator combination
again<00:02:21.400> does<00:02:21.610> have<00:02:21.760> a<00:02:21.790> little<00:02:22.060> bit<00:02:22.270> of

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
again does have a little bit of

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:23.820 
again does have a little bit of
side-to-side<00:02:22.660> recoil<00:02:23.050> and<00:02:23.410> the<00:02:23.470> normal

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
side-to-side recoil and the normal

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:25.530 
side-to-side recoil and the normal
compensator<00:02:24.370> pretty<00:02:24.640> much<00:02:24.790> gets<00:02:25.030> rid<00:02:25.270> of<00:02:25.390> that

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:25.540 
compensator pretty much gets rid of that

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.740 
compensator pretty much gets rid of that
making<00:02:26.080> it<00:02:26.200> a<00:02:26.380> very<00:02:26.920> very<00:02:27.490> easy<00:02:27.580> and<00:02:28.030> agreeable

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
making it a very very easy and agreeable

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:30.720 
making it a very very easy and agreeable
weapon<00:02:29.110> to<00:02:29.230> use<00:02:29.410> at<00:02:29.560> any<00:02:29.710> range<00:02:30.100> now<00:02:30.580> when

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
weapon to use at any range now when

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:32.340 
weapon to use at any range now when
looking<00:02:30.760> over<00:02:31.240> the<00:02:31.360> stats<00:02:31.600> of<00:02:31.780> this<00:02:31.930> weapon<00:02:32.110> I

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
looking over the stats of this weapon I

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.590 
looking over the stats of this weapon I
noticed<00:02:32.680> just<00:02:33.040> how<00:02:33.220> similar<00:02:33.670> it<00:02:34.090> is<00:02:34.120> to<00:02:34.300> the

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
noticed just how similar it is to the

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.540 
noticed just how similar it is to the
Augie<00:02:34.750> a3<00:02:35.320> in<00:02:35.470> fact<00:02:35.710> it's<00:02:35.920> almost<00:02:36.340> identical

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:36.550 
Augie a3 in fact it's almost identical

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:39.000 
Augie a3 in fact it's almost identical
in<00:02:37.210> many<00:02:37.480> ways<00:02:37.780> the<00:02:38.320> main<00:02:38.530> difference<00:02:38.920> between

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
in many ways the main difference between

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:41.250 
in many ways the main difference between
this<00:02:39.460> weapon<00:02:39.820> and<00:02:39.940> the<00:02:40.030> Augie<00:02:40.210> 3<00:02:40.660> right<00:02:40.900> now<00:02:40.930> is

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:41.260 
this weapon and the Augie 3 right now is

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.560 
this weapon and the Augie 3 right now is
that<00:02:41.590> the<00:02:41.740> algae<00:02:42.100> 3<00:02:42.340> has<00:02:42.490> a<00:02:42.520> slightly<00:02:43.000> longer

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
that the algae 3 has a slightly longer

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:46.260 
that the algae 3 has a slightly longer
reload<00:02:44.080> and<00:02:44.290> slightly<00:02:45.100> better<00:02:45.370> hipfire<00:02:46.000> it

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
reload and slightly better hipfire it

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.110 
reload and slightly better hipfire it
also<00:02:46.390> has<00:02:46.630> a<00:02:46.660> tiny<00:02:47.320> tiny<00:02:47.950> bit<00:02:48.160> faster<00:02:48.760> muzzle

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
also has a tiny tiny bit faster muzzle

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.900 
also has a tiny tiny bit faster muzzle
velocity<00:02:49.600> at<00:02:49.720> 670<00:02:50.320> where<00:02:50.770> the<00:02:50.860> ar160<00:02:51.700> has<00:02:51.880> a

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:51.910 
velocity at 670 where the ar160 has a

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.060 
velocity at 670 where the ar160 has a
muzzle<00:02:52.270> velocity<00:02:52.300> of<00:02:52.870> 650<00:02:53.680> which<00:02:53.920> is

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
muzzle velocity of 650 which is

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.940 
muzzle velocity of 650 which is
extremely<00:02:54.580> high<00:02:54.880> again<00:02:55.420> making<00:02:56.020> it<00:02:56.260> very<00:02:56.680> good

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
extremely high again making it very good

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.830 
extremely high again making it very good
for<00:02:57.130> hitting<00:02:57.250> long-range<00:02:57.910> targets<00:02:58.420> i've<00:02:58.630> now

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
for hitting long-range targets i've now

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.510 
for hitting long-range targets i've now
switched<00:02:59.140> it<00:02:59.290> up<00:02:59.380> to<00:02:59.500> the<00:02:59.620> coyote<00:03:00.010> red<00:03:00.340> dot

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:00.520 
switched it up to the coyote red dot

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.430 
switched it up to the coyote red dot
sight<00:03:00.850> and<00:03:01.090> a<00:03:01.240> suppressor<00:03:01.900> just<00:03:02.140> helped<00:03:02.350> me

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
sight and a suppressor just helped me

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:03.960 
sight and a suppressor just helped me
get<00:03:02.590> around<00:03:02.770> this<00:03:02.890> map<00:03:03.160> a<00:03:03.190> little<00:03:03.580> bit<00:03:03.730> more

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
get around this map a little bit more

get around this map a little bit more
stealthily<00:03:04.510> i<00:03:04.840> was<00:03:05.170> noticing<00:03:05.350> that<00:03:05.680> whenever

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:06.130 
stealthily i was noticing that whenever

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.370 
stealthily i was noticing that whenever
i<00:03:06.370> made<00:03:06.640> a<00:03:06.670> decent<00:03:07.000> push<00:03:07.480> everybody<00:03:07.930> always

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
i made a decent push everybody always

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:10.199 
i made a decent push everybody always
seemed<00:03:08.680> to<00:03:08.740> know<00:03:08.800> where<00:03:09.100> I<00:03:09.160> was<00:03:09.220> Nick<00:03:09.940> didn't

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:10.209 
seemed to know where I was Nick didn't

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:11.940 
seemed to know where I was Nick didn't
last<00:03:10.360> too<00:03:10.630> long<00:03:10.870> so<00:03:11.140> the<00:03:11.260> suppressors<00:03:11.709> gonna

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
last too long so the suppressors gonna

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:13.740 
last too long so the suppressors gonna
last<00:03:12.190> me<00:03:12.340> to<00:03:12.430> last<00:03:12.640> a<00:03:12.760> lot<00:03:12.940> longer<00:03:13.000> you're

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
last me to last a lot longer you're

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.690 
last me to last a lot longer you're
gonna<00:03:13.870> see<00:03:14.080> me<00:03:14.200> get<00:03:14.350> a<00:03:14.410> lot<00:03:14.800> more<00:03:14.830> kills<00:03:15.430> where

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
gonna see me get a lot more kills where

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.100 
gonna see me get a lot more kills where
I'm<00:03:15.790> shooting<00:03:15.940> players<00:03:16.360> in<00:03:16.570> the<00:03:16.660> back<00:03:16.810> just

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
I'm shooting players in the back just

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:18.540 
I'm shooting players in the back just
because<00:03:17.170> they<00:03:17.410> have<00:03:17.530> no<00:03:17.769> idea<00:03:17.800> where<00:03:18.459> I'm

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:18.550 
because they have no idea where I'm

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:20.220 
because they have no idea where I'm
located<00:03:18.790> now<00:03:19.360> there's<00:03:19.540> a<00:03:19.600> few<00:03:19.810> things<00:03:20.050> to<00:03:20.140> be

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
located now there's a few things to be

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:21.690 
located now there's a few things to be
aware<00:03:20.320> of<00:03:20.560> when<00:03:20.830> using<00:03:21.040> this<00:03:21.280> assault<00:03:21.610> rifle

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
aware of when using this assault rifle

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.550 
aware of when using this assault rifle
many<00:03:22.239> things<00:03:22.540> about<00:03:22.810> it<00:03:22.989> make<00:03:23.110> it<00:03:23.260> feel<00:03:23.530> like

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
many things about it make it feel like

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.340 
many things about it make it feel like
it's<00:03:24.040> your<00:03:24.220> kind<00:03:24.370> of<00:03:24.489> standard<00:03:24.780> m416<00:03:25.780> middle

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
it's your kind of standard m416 middle

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.350 
it's your kind of standard m416 middle
of<00:03:26.440> the<00:03:26.530> range<00:03:26.769> it<00:03:27.250> looks<00:03:27.640> very<00:03:27.850> similar<00:03:28.209> to

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
of the range it looks very similar to

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:31.080 
of the range it looks very similar to
your<00:03:28.690> traditional<00:03:28.930> m4<00:03:29.739> style<00:03:30.040> reload<00:03:30.640> system

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
your traditional m4 style reload system

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.090 
your traditional m4 style reload system
however<00:03:31.720> the<00:03:31.959> long<00:03:32.170> reload<00:03:32.560> on<00:03:32.739> this<00:03:32.920> gun

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:33.100 
however the long reload on this gun

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.370 
however the long reload on this gun
takes<00:03:33.340> 3.1<00:03:34.300> seconds<00:03:34.840> which<00:03:34.989> is<00:03:35.019> really

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:35.380 
takes 3.1 seconds which is really

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.190 
takes 3.1 seconds which is really
unfortunate<00:03:35.680> and<00:03:36.100> frankly<00:03:36.730> kind<00:03:37.000> of

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
unfortunate and frankly kind of

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.270 
unfortunate and frankly kind of
uncharacteristic<00:03:38.200> since<00:03:38.470> the<00:03:38.709> charging

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:39.280 
uncharacteristic since the charging

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.130 
uncharacteristic since the charging
handle<00:03:39.310> and<00:03:39.700> everything<00:03:39.850> about<00:03:40.330> it<00:03:40.510> seems<00:03:41.019> to

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:41.140 
handle and everything about it seems to

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.290 
handle and everything about it seems to
be<00:03:41.260> very<00:03:41.680> simplistic<00:03:42.640> in<00:03:42.820> use<00:03:43.060> there

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:43.300 
be very simplistic in use there

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.390 
be very simplistic in use there
shouldn't<00:03:43.570> be<00:03:43.630> any<00:03:43.870> actual<00:03:44.440> physical<00:03:45.010> reasons

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:45.400 
shouldn't be any actual physical reasons

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:47.460 
shouldn't be any actual physical reasons
for<00:03:45.550> taking<00:03:46.000> longer<00:03:46.390> for<00:03:46.570> the<00:03:46.840> long<00:03:47.050> reload

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
for taking longer for the long reload

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:50.340 
for taking longer for the long reload
than<00:03:48.010> your<00:03:48.190> average<00:03:48.420> m416<00:03:49.420> but<00:03:50.050> for<00:03:50.230> some

reason<00:03:50.650> it<00:03:50.739> does<00:03:50.950> in-game<00:03:51.400> so<00:03:51.640> just<00:03:51.940> be<00:03:52.090> aware

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:52.360 
reason it does in-game so just be aware

reason it does in-game so just be aware
of<00:03:52.420> that<00:03:52.600> if<00:03:52.780> you<00:03:52.900> shoot<00:03:53.140> every<00:03:53.380> bullet<00:03:53.620> in<00:03:53.830> the

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
of that if you shoot every bullet in the

mag you're going to be stuck with a very
long<00:03:55.959> reload<00:03:56.440> and<00:03:56.620> it<00:03:56.709> got<00:03:56.860> me<00:03:57.010> killed<00:03:57.280> a

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
long reload and it got me killed a

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.650 
long reload and it got me killed a
couple<00:03:57.700> times<00:03:57.880> because<00:03:58.120> I<00:03:58.150> was<00:03:58.330> just<00:03:58.450> kind<00:03:58.630> of

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
couple times because I was just kind of

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.330 
couple times because I was just kind of
waiting<00:03:59.110> and<00:03:59.260> waiting<00:03:59.440> and<00:03:59.739> waiting<00:03:59.800> for<00:04:00.100> my

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
waiting and waiting and waiting for my

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:02.130 
waiting and waiting and waiting for my
gun<00:04:00.550> to<00:04:00.670> be<00:04:00.760> ready<00:04:01.030> and<00:04:01.420> somebody<00:04:01.750> just<00:04:01.900> turned

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.140 
gun to be ready and somebody just turned

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:03.479 
gun to be ready and somebody just turned
around<00:04:02.260> and<00:04:02.440> killed<00:04:02.709> me<00:04:02.860> I<00:04:02.890> should<00:04:03.190> have<00:04:03.220> just

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 
around and killed me I should have just

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:05.100 
around and killed me I should have just
switched<00:04:03.640> my<00:04:03.940> sidearm<00:04:04.239> but<00:04:04.630> it<00:04:04.810> took<00:04:04.959> me<00:04:05.080> a

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.110 
switched my sidearm but it took me a

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:07.190 
switched my sidearm but it took me a
little<00:04:05.410> while<00:04:05.560> to<00:04:05.920> get<00:04:06.070> used<00:04:06.340> to<00:04:06.760> that

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:07.200 
little while to get used to that

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.240 
little while to get used to that
uncharacteristically<00:04:08.200> long<00:04:08.590> reload<00:04:09.010> and

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
uncharacteristically long reload and

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:10.800 
uncharacteristically long reload and
that<00:04:09.459> was<00:04:09.580> kind<00:04:09.820> of<00:04:09.880> weird<00:04:10.060> there<00:04:10.330> I<00:04:10.360> just<00:04:10.450> shot

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:10.810 
that was kind of weird there I just shot

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:12.870 
that was kind of weird there I just shot
that<00:04:11.019> player<00:04:11.320> in<00:04:11.560> the<00:04:11.830> head<00:04:12.010> ninja<00:04:12.459> chickens

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:12.880 
that player in the head ninja chickens

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:14.190 
that player in the head ninja chickens
the<00:04:13.000> kill<00:04:13.180> feed<00:04:13.390> popped<00:04:13.660> up<00:04:13.840> on<00:04:13.959> the<00:04:14.049> right

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 
the kill feed popped up on the right

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.020 
the kill feed popped up on the right
side<00:04:14.230> of<00:04:14.590> the<00:04:14.650> screen<00:04:14.739> but<00:04:15.370> I<00:04:15.400> never<00:04:15.670> got<00:04:15.880> the

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
side of the screen but I never got the

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:17.969 
side of the screen but I never got the
kill<00:04:16.239> confirmation<00:04:17.049> center<00:04:17.590> of<00:04:17.709> the<00:04:17.830> screen

kill confirmation center of the screen

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:20.759 
kill confirmation center of the screen
perhaps<00:04:18.489> a<00:04:18.640> new<00:04:18.850> bug<00:04:19.090> in<00:04:19.330> the<00:04:19.570> new<00:04:19.780> patch<00:04:20.200> I'll

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:20.769 
perhaps a new bug in the new patch I'll

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:22.050 
perhaps a new bug in the new patch I'll
have<00:04:20.890> to<00:04:21.040> see<00:04:21.220> it's<00:04:21.400> the<00:04:21.520> first<00:04:21.729> time<00:04:21.910> I've

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
have to see it's the first time I've

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:23.530 
have to see it's the first time I've
actually<00:04:22.090> seen<00:04:22.510> that<00:04:22.780> happen

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:23.540 
actually seen that happen

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.360 
actually seen that happen
in<00:04:23.600> this<00:04:23.780> game<00:04:24.020> so<00:04:24.320> maybe<00:04:24.830> it's<00:04:25.070> just<00:04:25.220> a

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
in this game so maybe it's just a

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.430 
in this game so maybe it's just a
one-time<00:04:25.910> occurrence<00:04:26.270> but<00:04:26.630> you<00:04:26.900> really<00:04:27.260> never

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
one-time occurrence but you really never

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.680 
one-time occurrence but you really never
know<00:04:27.770> the<00:04:28.310> speaking<00:04:28.580> of<00:04:28.820> the<00:04:28.940> last<00:04:29.210> patch<00:04:29.450> one

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
know the speaking of the last patch one

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.390 
know the speaking of the last patch one
of<00:04:29.810> my<00:04:29.900> favorite<00:04:30.380> little<00:04:30.530> improvements<00:04:31.190> is

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
of my favorite little improvements is

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.190 
of my favorite little improvements is
that<00:04:31.640> mini-map<00:04:32.210> side<00:04:32.480> lower<00:04:32.780> left-hand

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:33.200 
that mini-map side lower left-hand

with guns and just get a good feel for
the<00:05:49.940> game<00:05:50.150> but<00:05:50.600> when<00:05:50.750> they<00:05:50.840> have<00:05:50.960> such<00:05:51.170> a

all<00:05:54.470> the<00:05:54.800> time<00:05:55.040> really<00:05:55.580> makes<00:05:55.910> you<00:05:56.030> wonder<00:05:56.270> how

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:56.480 
all the time really makes you wonder how

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.090 
all the time really makes you wonder how
much<00:05:56.600> time<00:05:56.840> they<00:05:56.990> even<00:05:57.200> put<00:05:57.380> into<00:05:57.620> balancing

00:05:58.090 --> 00:05:58.100 
much time they even put into balancing

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:00.250 
much time they even put into balancing
the<00:05:58.190> system<00:05:58.550> in<00:05:58.700> the<00:05:58.850> first<00:05:59.060> place<00:05:59.240> so<00:05:59.660> I<00:05:59.840> would

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:00.260 
the system in the first place so I would

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.290

big<00:06:04.850> patch<00:06:05.120> push<00:06:05.570> now<00:06:06.050> overall<00:06:06.410> I'm<00:06:06.740> really

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:07.040 
big patch push now overall I'm really

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.700 
big patch push now overall I'm really
like<00:06:07.250> in<00:06:07.400> the<00:06:07.520> ar160<00:06:08.510> it's<00:06:08.810> not<00:06:09.140> a<00:06:09.170> powerhouse

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:09.710 
like in the ar160 it's not a powerhouse

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:11.440 
like in the ar160 it's not a powerhouse
weapon<00:06:10.250> so<00:06:10.460> don't<00:06:10.700> ever<00:06:10.820> think<00:06:10.940> that<00:06:11.330> it's

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:11.450 
weapon so don't ever think that it's

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:12.880 
weapon so don't ever think that it's
going<00:06:11.570> to<00:06:11.630> replace<00:06:11.990> something<00:06:12.260> like<00:06:12.590> the<00:06:12.740> AAA

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:12.890 
going to replace something like the AAA

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:15.370 
going to replace something like the AAA
if<00:06:13.370> you<00:06:13.520> just<00:06:13.700> absolutely<00:06:14.330> want<00:06:14.750> a<00:06:14.840> rec<00:06:15.110> house

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:15.380 
if you just absolutely want a rec house

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:17.800 
if you just absolutely want a rec house
in<00:06:15.620> the<00:06:15.710> server<00:06:15.950> however<00:06:16.490> for<00:06:17.180> especially

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:17.810 
in the server however for especially

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:19.840 
in the server however for especially
console<00:06:18.290> gaming<00:06:18.560> I<00:06:18.830> recommend<00:06:19.370> trying<00:06:19.580> it<00:06:19.730> out

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:19.850 
console gaming I recommend trying it out

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:22.000 
console gaming I recommend trying it out
because<00:06:20.120> the<00:06:20.270> recoil<00:06:20.480> is<00:06:20.900> now<00:06:21.110> so<00:06:21.380> easy<00:06:21.770> to

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:22.010 
because the recoil is now so easy to

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:23.770 
because the recoil is now so easy to
manage<00:06:22.250> it's<00:06:22.550> going<00:06:22.700> to<00:06:22.760> be<00:06:22.880> a<00:06:22.910> nice<00:06:23.240> accurate

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:23.780 
manage it's going to be a nice accurate

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:26.080 
manage it's going to be a nice accurate
weapon<00:06:24.590> especially<00:06:25.130> for<00:06:25.310> dropping<00:06:25.670> people<00:06:25.970> at

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:26.090 
weapon especially for dropping people at

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:28.210 
weapon especially for dropping people at
medium<00:06:26.480> to<00:06:26.690> longer<00:06:26.900> ranges<00:06:27.530> and<00:06:27.800> I<00:06:27.920> really

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:28.220 
medium to longer ranges and I really

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:29.380 
medium to longer ranges and I really
like<00:06:28.430> the<00:06:28.580> fact<00:06:28.730> that<00:06:28.970> they're<00:06:29.150> trying<00:06:29.270> to

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:29.390 
like the fact that they're trying to

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:31.000 
like the fact that they're trying to
make<00:06:29.450> guns<00:06:29.810> a<00:06:29.990> little<00:06:30.140> bit<00:06:30.380> easier<00:06:30.800> to<00:06:30.860> use

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:31.010 
make guns a little bit easier to use

00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:33.100 
make guns a little bit easier to use
balanced<00:06:31.669> amount<00:06:31.940> not<00:06:32.090> necessarily<00:06:32.870> make

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:33.110 
balanced amount not necessarily make

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:34.930 
balanced amount not necessarily make
them<00:06:33.290> balanced<00:06:33.830> with<00:06:34.040> all<00:06:34.250> the<00:06:34.430> weapons<00:06:34.790> in

00:06:34.930 --> 00:06:34.940 
them balanced with all the weapons in

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:35.340 
them balanced with all the weapons in
the<00:06:35.030> game

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:35.350 
the game

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:37.260 
the game
but<00:06:35.740> just<00:06:35.950> generally<00:06:36.550> speaking<00:06:36.970> more

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:37.270 
but just generally speaking more

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:39.000 
but just generally speaking more
enjoyable<00:06:37.780> I<00:06:38.200> don't<00:06:38.410> think<00:06:38.560> I<00:06:38.650> would<00:06:38.800> ever<00:06:38.920> use

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:39.010 
enjoyable I don't think I would ever use

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:41.280 
enjoyable I don't think I would ever use
the<00:06:39.310> ar160<00:06:40.210> in<00:06:40.390> a<00:06:40.450> competitive<00:06:40.870> environment

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:41.290 
the ar160 in a competitive environment

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:43.200 
the ar160 in a competitive environment
where<00:06:41.860> I'm<00:06:41.950> trying<00:06:42.220> my<00:06:42.460> hardest<00:06:42.490> to<00:06:43.030> do<00:06:43.120> as

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:43.210 
where I'm trying my hardest to do as

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:45.570 
where I'm trying my hardest to do as
best<00:06:43.240> as<00:06:43.570> I<00:06:43.690> possibly<00:06:43.720> can<00:06:44.530> however<00:06:45.160> it's

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:45.580 
best as I possibly can however it's

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:47.580 
best as I possibly can however it's
still<00:06:45.700> enjoyable<00:06:46.570> to<00:06:46.870> use<00:06:46.900> and<00:06:47.200> I<00:06:47.260> don't<00:06:47.440> ever

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:47.590 
still enjoyable to use and I don't ever

00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:49.560 
still enjoyable to use and I don't ever
feel<00:06:47.890> like<00:06:48.160> I'm<00:06:48.370> getting<00:06:48.850> completely

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:49.570 
feel like I'm getting completely

00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:51.600 
feel like I'm getting completely
outgunned<00:06:50.200> just<00:06:50.710> because<00:06:51.010> I'm<00:06:51.130> using<00:06:51.400> an

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:51.610 
outgunned just because I'm using an

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:53.730 
outgunned just because I'm using an
ar160<00:06:52.360> if<00:06:52.510> I<00:06:52.630> lose<00:06:52.810> a<00:06:52.840> firefight<00:06:53.350> it's<00:06:53.530> usually

00:06:53.730 --> 00:06:53.740 
ar160 if I lose a firefight it's usually

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:56.370 
ar160 if I lose a firefight it's usually
because<00:06:54.190> somebody<00:06:54.880> got<00:06:55.030> the<00:06:55.210> jump<00:06:55.510> on<00:06:55.570> me<00:06:56.050> so<00:06:56.350> I

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:56.380 
because somebody got the jump on me so I

00:06:56.380 --> 00:06:58.410 
because somebody got the jump on me so I
don't<00:06:56.740> feel<00:06:57.130> restricted<00:06:57.760> because<00:06:58.090> of<00:06:58.300> the

00:06:58.410 --> 00:06:58.420 
don't feel restricted because of the

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:00.420 
don't feel restricted because of the
weapon<00:06:58.900> as<00:06:59.050> much<00:06:59.290> so<00:06:59.680> anyway<00:07:00.070> when<00:07:00.280> this

00:07:00.420 --> 00:07:00.430 
weapon as much so anyway when this

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:02.070 
weapon as much so anyway when this
assault<00:07:00.820> rifle<00:07:00.910> first<00:07:01.450> came<00:07:01.720> out<00:07:01.870> it

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:02.080 
assault rifle first came out it

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:03.630 
assault rifle first came out it
certainly<00:07:02.500> wasn't<00:07:02.770> very<00:07:03.130> good<00:07:03.370> a<00:07:03.400> lot<00:07:03.580> of

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:03.640 
certainly wasn't very good a lot of

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:05.250 
certainly wasn't very good a lot of
people<00:07:03.730> picked<00:07:04.210> it<00:07:04.330> up<00:07:04.420> and<00:07:04.660> kind<00:07:04.870> of<00:07:04.990> put<00:07:05.140> it

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:05.260 
people picked it up and kind of put it

00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:07.410 
people picked it up and kind of put it
down<00:07:05.410> immediately<00:07:05.830> but<00:07:06.700> if<00:07:06.820> you<00:07:06.970> were<00:07:07.180> one<00:07:07.390> of
