 understand what feeds itself what's interesting 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:13.200
 real food itself is crustacean 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:16.560

 but besides this night can eat fish 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.080
 Although for how they pass to no one 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.930

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:33.540
 can on with here we may well be it 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:36.239
 food but what is convenient on liquid 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.120
 uncomfortably well let's say about here hurricane 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:44.070

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:46.440

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:55.920
 address of the year and if cool you are not 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:57.570
 very comfortable and well and spend on it 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.480
 Well, time on vacation I don't want to 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.570
 so for me, that's better than you last 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.150
 time up creeper such more squid 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.890
 always from the store almost any 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.510
 grocery fresh-frozen stables 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.210
 the burner is not such a star squid 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.770
 the whole carcass proton will freeze again 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.150
 Moisture native dear to can 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.740
 use more than once you mean 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:21.750
 left there for shopping thinking no 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.759
 then of course I recognized the girl on 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.070
 near too well caught on the frogs 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.520
 can you catch it on the table man 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:32.369
 forces carried from his no question about it 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:34.049
 normal alarming shit of something but 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.600
 Still, I decided for myself that it is better 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:39.810
 what squid skip and besides too 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.800
 on hand it is elastic enough and good 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.930

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.790
 that is, from the planned was a bite 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.070
 small thought itself plays immediately when 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.680
 then video or permissible to during 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:54.300

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:56.190

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:59.310

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:01.980

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.080

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.290
