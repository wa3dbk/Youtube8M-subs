hey guys liam here with another unboxing

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.619 
hey guys liam here with another unboxing
this<00:00:03.179> time<00:00:03.480> my<00:00:03.720> first<00:00:03.959> t-mobile<00:00:04.440> unboxing<00:00:05.629> so

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
this time my first t-mobile unboxing so

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.650 
this time my first t-mobile unboxing so
this<00:00:06.930> is<00:00:07.200> the<00:00:07.799> Alcatel<00:00:08.460> OneTouch<00:00:08.910> evolved

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
this is the Alcatel OneTouch evolved

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.360 
this is the Alcatel OneTouch evolved
it's<00:00:09.929> a<00:00:10.110> pretty<00:00:10.320> good<00:00:10.530> device<00:00:10.860> I've<00:00:11.130> heard

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
it's a pretty good device I've heard

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.940 
it's a pretty good device I've heard
about<00:00:11.460> it<00:00:11.670> before<00:00:11.759> it<00:00:12.599> only<00:00:12.750> works<00:00:12.990> on<00:00:13.170> 3G<00:00:13.740> but

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
about it before it only works on 3G but

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.320 
about it before it only works on 3G but
if<00:00:14.070> that<00:00:14.190> doesn't<00:00:14.490> stop<00:00:14.670> it<00:00:14.700> from<00:00:14.969> having<00:00:15.179> a

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
if that doesn't stop it from having a

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.990 
if that doesn't stop it from having a
nice<00:00:15.540> 4<00:00:15.900> inch<00:00:16.049> display<00:00:16.289> and<00:00:16.800> a<00:00:17.430> 5<00:00:17.640> megapixel

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
nice 4 inch display and a 5 megapixel

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.929 
nice 4 inch display and a 5 megapixel
camera<00:00:18.330> so<00:00:19.230> let's<00:00:19.830> get<00:00:20.010> to<00:00:20.189> the<00:00:20.220> unboxing

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:24.939 

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:27.100 

runs<00:00:25.939> on<00:00:26.119> t-mobile

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:27.110 
runs on t-mobile

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:29.500 
runs on t-mobile
nationwide<00:00:27.710> 3G<00:00:28.369> network<00:00:28.730> which<00:00:28.939> is<00:00:29.090> actually

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:29.510 
nationwide 3G network which is actually

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:31.900

but for 80 you get unlimited and that's
obviously<00:00:59.960> their<00:01:00.140> coverage<00:01:00.500> map<00:01:00.710> right<00:01:00.920> there

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:00.979 
obviously their coverage map right there

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:03.820 
obviously their coverage map right there
24/7<00:01:01.879> customer<00:01:02.510> support<00:01:02.780> you<00:01:03.080> ain't<00:01:03.589> no

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
unlimited international talking text I

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.539 
unlimited international talking text I
already<00:01:15.409> thought<00:01:15.560> they<00:01:15.770> added<00:01:16.130> that<00:01:16.159> to<00:01:16.280> the

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:16.549 
already thought they added that to the

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:19.030 
already thought they added that to the
thing<00:01:16.760> now<00:01:16.970> but<00:01:17.180> maybe<00:01:17.930> this<00:01:18.170> device<00:01:18.500> has<00:01:18.860> an

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
thing now but maybe this device has an

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.600 
thing now but maybe this device has an
older<00:01:19.400> box<00:01:20.619> so<00:01:21.619> on<00:01:21.740> the<00:01:21.860> back<00:01:22.040> you<00:01:22.280> just<00:01:22.310> got

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
older box so on the back you just got

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.850 
older box so on the back you just got
some<00:01:22.790> getting<00:01:22.939> started<00:01:23.630> information<00:01:24.439> and<00:01:24.799> a

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
some getting started information and a

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.550 
some getting started information and a
bazillion<00:01:25.220> other<00:01:25.549> things<00:01:25.969> this<00:01:26.869> box<00:01:27.200> is

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
bazillion other things this box is

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.279 
bazillion other things this box is
pretty<00:01:27.590> big<00:01:28.070> and<00:01:28.280> pretty<00:01:28.310> heavy<00:01:28.729> for<00:01:29.149> a<00:01:29.899> device

00:01:30.279 --> 00:01:30.289 
pretty big and pretty heavy for a device

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:33.279 
pretty big and pretty heavy for a device
of<00:01:30.500> this<00:01:30.530> type<00:01:31.009> and<00:01:31.369> as<00:01:32.359> I<00:01:32.689> can<00:01:32.810> tell<00:01:33.020> it<00:01:33.140> looks

00:01:33.279 --> 00:01:33.289 
of this type and as I can tell it looks

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:36.270 
of this type and as I can tell it looks
very<00:01:33.770> similar<00:01:34.070> to<00:01:34.310> another<00:01:34.820> Alcatel<00:01:35.719> device

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
very similar to another Alcatel device

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.739 
very similar to another Alcatel device
we'll<00:01:37.280> get<00:01:37.399> back<00:01:37.520> to<00:01:37.729> that<00:01:37.820> in<00:01:37.880> a<00:01:37.999> moment<00:01:38.119> so

00:01:38.739 --> 00:01:38.749 
we'll get back to that in a moment so

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:41.139 
we'll get back to that in a moment so
let's<00:01:39.049> get<00:01:39.200> the<00:01:39.320> package<00:01:39.649> open<00:01:39.829> so<00:01:40.460> I<00:01:40.490> think<00:01:40.759> we

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:41.149 
let's get the package open so I think we

00:01:41.149 --> 00:02:00.120 
let's get the package open so I think we
should<00:01:41.329> open<00:01:41.509> this<00:01:41.780> from<00:01:41.960> the<00:01:42.109> top<00:01:42.439> right<00:01:43.159> here

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:08.529 

and<00:02:01.130> then<00:02:01.280> we<00:02:01.490> slide<00:02:01.790> this<00:02:02.060> out<00:02:06.970> of<00:02:07.970> its

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
and then we slide this out of its

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.570 
and then we slide this out of its
packaging<00:02:09.110> then<00:02:09.830> we<00:02:09.890> just<00:02:10.039> pop<00:02:10.220> this<00:02:10.399> open

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:10.580 
packaging then we just pop this open

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.390 
packaging then we just pop this open
very<00:02:10.910> easy<00:02:11.180> and<00:02:11.480> nice<00:02:11.989> to<00:02:12.200> open<00:02:12.470> packaging<00:02:13.040> and

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
very easy and nice to open packaging and

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.580 
very easy and nice to open packaging and
pretty<00:02:14.180> nice<00:02:14.330> so<00:02:14.840> here's<00:02:15.050> the<00:02:15.200> OneTouch

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
pretty nice so here's the OneTouch

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
pretty nice so here's the OneTouch
evolve<00:02:15.920> itself<00:02:16.340> really<00:02:17.330> nice<00:02:17.599> big<00:02:17.989> screen

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
evolve itself really nice big screen

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.370 
evolve itself really nice big screen
nice<00:02:19.610> soft<00:02:20.000> touch<00:02:20.180> back<00:02:20.480> with<00:02:20.720> t-mobile<00:02:21.110> and

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
nice soft touch back with t-mobile and
