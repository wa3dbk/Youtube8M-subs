once<00:00:07.859> this<00:00:08.130> was<00:00:08.370> a<00:00:08.400> land<00:00:08.760> alive<00:00:09.450> with<00:00:09.870> lions

00:00:10.369 --> 00:00:10.379 
once this was a land alive with lions

once this was a land alive with lions

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:15.160 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.400 

there<00:00:15.730> were<00:00:15.849> great<00:00:16.150> sharks<00:00:16.720> swimming<00:00:17.170> the

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:17.410 
there were great sharks swimming the

there were great sharks swimming the
Seas

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:21.880 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:30.810 

and<00:00:22.019> eagles<00:00:23.019> loft<00:00:23.619> in<00:00:23.949> the<00:00:24.189> air<00:00:29.579> this<00:00:30.579> was<00:00:30.789> a

and eagles loft in the air this was a

00:00:30.820 --> 00:01:20.580 
and eagles loft in the air this was a
world<00:00:31.149> patrolled<00:00:32.019> by<00:00:32.649> great<00:00:33.010> predators

Oh

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:23.300 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:32.310 

oh<00:01:23.920> yeah

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.990 

we've<00:01:33.320> underestimated<00:01:33.799> the<00:01:34.520> force<00:01:34.820> of

we've underestimated the force of

we've underestimated the force of
