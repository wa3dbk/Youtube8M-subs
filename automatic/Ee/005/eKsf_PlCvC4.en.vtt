00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.430 
basic today so we've got that design
there<00:03:36.670> the<00:03:37.060> petals<00:03:37.420> I<00:03:37.540> normally<00:03:37.989> like<00:03:38.110> to<00:03:38.260> put

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
there the petals I normally like to put

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.009 
there the petals I normally like to put
on<00:03:38.680> some<00:03:38.980> glitter<00:03:39.220> at<00:03:39.489> this<00:03:39.670> point<00:03:40.019> because

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 
on some glitter at this point because

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:42.449 
on some glitter at this point because
the<00:03:41.140> glitter<00:03:41.350> will<00:03:41.500> stick<00:03:41.799> so<00:03:42.010> well<00:03:42.190> with<00:03:42.370> the

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
the glitter will stick so well with the

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:44.580 
the glitter will stick so well with the
paint<00:03:42.670> still<00:03:42.910> being<00:03:43.150> wet<00:03:43.420> and<00:03:43.780> of<00:03:43.959> course<00:03:44.230> all

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
paint still being wet and of course all

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.680 
paint still being wet and of course all
the<00:03:45.250> little<00:03:45.459> girls<00:03:45.670> love<00:03:45.940> their<00:03:46.180> glitter<00:03:46.480> to

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
the little girls love their glitter to

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.870 
the little girls love their glitter to
stick<00:03:46.989> all<00:03:47.170> day<00:03:47.410> I'm<00:03:47.950> not<00:03:48.459> gonna<00:03:48.610> do<00:03:48.760> the

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
stick all day I'm not gonna do the

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.400 
stick all day I'm not gonna do the
glitter<00:03:49.060> today<00:03:49.450> but<00:03:49.750> normally<00:03:50.079> I<00:03:50.110> would<00:03:50.230> poof

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:50.410

petals now as with all face painting if

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:03.780 
petals now as with all face painting if
you<00:03:59.860> go<00:04:00.100> thin<00:04:00.489> to<00:04:00.910> thick<00:04:00.940> and<00:04:01.560> vary<00:04:02.560> the<00:04:02.790> depths

you want to grab a sized one paint brush
a<00:04:43.090> really<00:04:43.390> thin<00:04:43.630> one<00:04:43.840> you<00:04:44.500> can<00:04:44.680> do<00:04:44.830> that<00:04:44.979> but<00:04:45.190> I

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
a really thin one you can do that but I

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.399 
a really thin one you can do that but I
use<00:04:45.550> my<00:04:45.789> brush<00:04:46.180> here<00:04:46.479> and<00:04:46.630> I<00:04:47.080> just<00:04:47.260> make<00:04:47.380> a

00:04:47.399 --> 00:04:47.409 
use my brush here and I just make a

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:49.080 
use my brush here and I just make a
couple<00:04:47.770> little<00:04:47.890> tendrils<00:04:48.340> like<00:04:48.610> a<00:04:48.640> little

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.090 
couple little tendrils like a little

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:52.800 
couple little tendrils like a little
wispy<00:04:49.539> well<00:04:50.229> curlicue<00:04:50.979> tendrils<00:04:51.570> they<00:04:52.570> take

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:52.810 
wispy well curlicue tendrils they take

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:54.390 
wispy well curlicue tendrils they take
up<00:04:52.960> more<00:04:53.140> real<00:04:53.320> estate<00:04:53.440> on<00:04:53.770> the<00:04:53.860> face<00:04:54.070> so

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400 
up more real estate on the face so

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.480 
up more real estate on the face so
you've<00:04:54.520> got<00:04:54.700> a<00:04:54.729> bigger<00:04:55.210> face<00:04:55.539> painting<00:04:55.990> now

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:56.490 
you've got a bigger face painting now

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:58.950 
you've got a bigger face painting now
but<00:04:57.490> they<00:04:57.610> also<00:04:57.760> just<00:04:58.060> look<00:04:58.240> pretty<00:04:58.570> they<00:04:58.810> add

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 
but they also just look pretty they add

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:01.830 
but they also just look pretty they add
they<00:04:59.470> add<00:04:59.620> a<00:04:59.650> nice<00:04:59.919> little<00:04:59.950> element<00:05:00.580> the<00:05:01.419> next

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840 
they add a nice little element the next
