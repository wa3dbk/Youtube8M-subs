00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:02.669 
okay if you look at your hand your thumb

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:04.610 
okay if you look at your hand your thumb
actually<00:00:03.149> you<00:00:03.449> know<00:00:03.570> comes<00:00:03.840> in<00:00:03.990> contact<00:00:04.230> with

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
actually you know comes in contact with

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.829 
actually you know comes in contact with
your<00:00:04.740> knuckle<00:00:05.190> region<00:00:05.549> it<00:00:05.730> does<00:00:06.000> not<00:00:06.330> stretch

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
your knuckle region it does not stretch

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.379 
your knuckle region it does not stretch
all<00:00:07.080> the<00:00:07.109> way<00:00:07.410> to<00:00:07.560> this<00:00:07.859> last<00:00:08.099> knuckle<00:00:08.639> because

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
all the way to this last knuckle because

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.080 
all the way to this last knuckle because
that<00:00:09.719> would<00:00:10.080> be<00:00:10.110> strange<00:00:10.469> so<00:00:11.400> this<00:00:11.759> gives<00:00:11.940> me

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
that would be strange so this gives me

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.530 
that would be strange so this gives me
the<00:00:12.150> opportunity<00:00:12.540> to<00:00:12.960> kind<00:00:13.200> of<00:00:13.290> show<00:00:13.469> you<00:00:13.500> what

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:14.540 
the opportunity to kind of show you what

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:17.779 
the opportunity to kind of show you what
advantages<00:00:15.540> you<00:00:15.750> might<00:00:15.960> have<00:00:16.279> to<00:00:17.279> using<00:00:17.670> that

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
advantages you might have to using that

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.900 
advantages you might have to using that
control<00:00:18.270> rotate<00:00:18.690> type<00:00:18.930> of<00:00:19.109> maneuver<00:00:19.760> so<00:00:20.760> in

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
control rotate type of maneuver so in

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:29.240 
control rotate type of maneuver so in
here<00:00:21.529> if<00:00:22.529> Ike<00:00:22.740> alike<00:00:23.039> this<00:00:27.410> okay<00:00:28.410> and<00:00:28.650> then<00:00:29.010> do

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
here if Ike alike this okay and then do

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.670 
here if Ike alike this okay and then do
a<00:00:29.279> rotate<00:00:29.939> in<00:00:30.119> that<00:00:30.269> area<00:00:33.050> you<00:00:34.050> can<00:00:34.230> see<00:00:34.380> I'm

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
a rotate in that area you can see I'm

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.920 
a rotate in that area you can see I'm
never<00:00:35.219> going<00:00:35.460> to<00:00:35.520> kind<00:00:35.820> of<00:00:35.940> get<00:00:36.120> anything<00:00:36.450> with

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
never going to kind of get anything with

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.990 
never going to kind of get anything with
rotate<00:00:37.469> to<00:00:37.710> actually<00:00:38.100> match<00:00:38.280> up<00:00:38.610> so<00:00:38.850> I'm<00:00:38.969> going

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
rotate to actually match up so I'm going

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.740 
rotate to actually match up so I'm going
to<00:00:39.120> kind<00:00:39.300> of<00:00:39.360> use<00:00:39.540> move<00:00:41.120> and<00:00:42.120> I<00:00:42.210> can<00:00:42.390> start

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
to kind of use move and I can start

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:51.369 
to kind of use move and I can start
moving<00:00:42.960> that<00:00:43.290> a<00:00:43.320> huge<00:00:43.770> form<00:00:44.100> back<00:00:44.460> quite<00:00:44.910> a<00:00:44.940> bit

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:51.379 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:56.270 

okay<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:53.039> if<00:00:53.520> I<00:00:53.640> start<00:00:53.940> losing<00:00:55.280> enough

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
okay and if I start losing enough

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.849 
okay and if I start losing enough
resolution<00:00:56.640> or<00:00:57.449> you<00:00:58.230> know<00:00:58.350> enough<00:00:58.590> of<00:00:58.710> my

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
resolution or you know enough of my

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.340 
resolution or you know enough of my
thumb<00:00:59.280> I<00:00:59.550> can<00:01:00.120> always<00:01:00.359> use<00:01:00.510> a<00:01:00.539> move<00:01:00.840> tool<00:01:01.050> lip

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
thumb I can always use a move tool lip

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.860 
thumb I can always use a move tool lip
over<00:01:01.920> here<00:01:02.219> a<00:01:02.250> little<00:01:02.460> bit<00:01:02.609> more<00:01:02.789> by<00:01:03.000> masking<00:01:03.660> a

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
over here a little bit more by masking a

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.740 
over here a little bit more by masking a
little<00:01:04.080> bit<00:01:04.170> more<00:01:04.379> off<00:01:05.240> and<00:01:06.240> moving<00:01:06.479> it<00:01:06.720> a

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
little bit more off and moving it a

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.289 
little bit more off and moving it a
little<00:01:06.900> bit<00:01:07.080> more<00:01:10.250> now<00:01:11.250> let's<00:01:11.610> pretend<00:01:11.820> that

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
little bit more now let's pretend that

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.120 
little bit more now let's pretend that
you<00:01:12.780> know<00:01:12.930> I'm<00:01:13.170> never<00:01:13.350> going<00:01:13.619> to<00:01:13.770> be<00:01:13.860> able<00:01:13.890> to

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
you know I'm never going to be able to

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.090 
you know I'm never going to be able to
get<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.280> good<00:01:14.340> edge<00:01:14.580> lovin<00:01:14.970> ear<00:01:15.119> or<00:01:15.600> a<00:01:16.200> good<00:01:16.650> flow

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
get a good edge lovin ear or a good flow

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.600 
get a good edge lovin ear or a good flow
using<00:01:17.400> control<00:01:17.909> right<00:01:18.799> okay<00:01:19.799> so<00:01:19.860> that's<00:01:20.310> where

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
using control right okay so that's where

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.450 
using control right okay so that's where
you<00:01:20.729> start<00:01:20.790> getting<00:01:21.150> into<00:01:21.619> using<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:22.920> lasso

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
you start getting into using the lasso

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.469 
you start getting into using the lasso
tool<00:01:24.200> okay<00:01:25.250> now<00:01:26.250> if<00:01:26.580> you<00:01:26.759> use<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:26.939> lasso<00:01:27.450> tool

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
tool okay now if you use the lasso tool

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:33.530 
tool okay now if you use the lasso tool
correctly<00:01:29.900> good<00:01:30.900> things<00:01:31.140> happen<00:01:31.229> so<00:01:32.540> right

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
correctly good things happen so right

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.050 
correctly good things happen so right
here<00:01:33.810> if<00:01:33.960> I<00:01:34.619> draw<00:01:34.860> this<00:01:35.070> out<00:01:35.220> holding<00:01:35.610> control

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
here if I draw this out holding control

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.210 
here if I draw this out holding control
I<00:01:36.329> have<00:01:37.290> this<00:01:37.470> black<00:01:37.860> and<00:01:38.479> if<00:01:39.479> I<00:01:39.630> hit<00:01:40.290> alt<00:01:40.560> as<00:01:40.860> I

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
I have this black and if I hit alt as I

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.030 
I have this black and if I hit alt as I
draw<00:01:41.460> out<00:01:41.670> I<00:01:41.850> have<00:01:42.090> white<00:01:42.439> k<00:01:43.439> white<00:01:43.770> means

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
draw out I have white k white means

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.160 
draw out I have white k white means
unmasked<00:01:44.700> and<00:01:45.890> black<00:01:46.890> means<00:01:47.159> mask<00:01:47.780> so<00:01:48.780> i<00:01:48.810> can

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
unmasked and black means mask so i can

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.649 
unmasked and black means mask so i can
start<00:01:49.350> feathering<00:01:50.070> this<00:01:50.250> out<00:01:50.490> or<00:01:53.420> masking<00:01:54.420> off

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
start feathering this out or masking off

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.749 
start feathering this out or masking off
so<00:01:55.320> i<00:01:55.380> can<00:01:55.530> mask<00:01:55.740> off<00:01:55.950> this<00:01:56.130> entire<00:01:56.340> region

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
so i can mask off this entire region

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.380 
so i can mask off this entire region
here<00:01:57.469> and<00:01:58.469> i<00:01:58.829> can<00:01:58.860> mask<00:01:59.250> it<00:01:59.430> off<00:01:59.640> using<00:02:00.090> the

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
here and i can mask it off using the

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.539 
here and i can mask it off using the
edge<00:02:00.450> loops<00:02:00.840> or<00:02:01.200> whatever<00:02:01.560> i<00:02:01.680> might<00:02:02.070> need<00:02:02.310> I

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
edge loops or whatever i might need I

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.609 
edge loops or whatever i might need I
can<00:02:02.790> strengthen<00:02:03.240> up<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:03.840> mask<00:02:04.079> that's<00:02:04.409> a

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
can strengthen up the mask that's a

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.980 
can strengthen up the mask that's a
really<00:02:05.009> handy<00:02:05.369> thing<00:02:05.579> to<00:02:05.610> do<00:02:05.880> with<00:02:06.540> this<00:02:06.719> tool

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
really handy thing to do with this tool

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.270 
really handy thing to do with this tool
is<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:07.439> really<00:02:07.770> strengthen<00:02:08.129> up<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.610> mask<00:02:08.849> and

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
is to really strengthen up the mask and

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.280 
is to really strengthen up the mask and
then<00:02:11.280> I<00:02:11.430> can<00:02:11.610> go<00:02:11.760> in<00:02:11.940> here<00:02:11.970> with<00:02:12.390> the<00:02:12.510> move<00:02:12.690> tool

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
then I can go in here with the move tool

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.649 
then I can go in here with the move tool
then<00:02:13.860> you<00:02:13.950> might<00:02:14.099> find<00:02:14.340> that<00:02:14.519> see<00:02:14.969> how<00:02:15.209> it<00:02:15.420> it

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:15.659 
then you might find that see how it it

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:18.619 
then you might find that see how it it
just<00:02:16.349> moves<00:02:16.950> those<00:02:17.159> these<00:02:17.640> these<00:02:18.030> one<00:02:18.329> group

00:02:18.619 --> 00:02:18.629 
just moves those these these one group

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:21.770 
just moves those these these one group
of<00:02:18.750> Polly's<00:02:19.519> all<00:02:20.519> right<00:02:20.700> so<00:02:20.909> if<00:02:21.209> it's<00:02:21.510> too

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
of Polly's all right so if it's too

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.630 
of Polly's all right so if it's too
tight<00:02:22.109> don't<00:02:22.680> forget<00:02:22.950> you<00:02:23.129> have<00:02:23.159> the<00:02:23.459> blur

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
tight don't forget you have the blur

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.849 
tight don't forget you have the blur
mask<00:02:24.180> mode<00:02:25.079> on<00:02:25.319> and<00:02:25.530> you<00:02:26.250> can<00:02:26.400> blur<00:02:26.640> that<00:02:26.670> out

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:27.859 
mask mode on and you can blur that out

00:02:27.859 --> 00:02:30.710 
mask mode on and you can blur that out
and<00:02:28.859> now<00:02:29.010> you're<00:02:29.250> getting<00:02:29.519> a<00:02:29.609> much<00:02:29.849> better

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
and now you're getting a much better

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.220 
and now you're getting a much better
kind<00:02:31.650> of<00:02:31.799> move<00:02:32.239> that<00:02:33.239> doesn't<00:02:33.599> interfere<00:02:33.840> with

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
kind of move that doesn't interfere with

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.190 
kind of move that doesn't interfere with
too<00:02:34.439> much<00:02:34.620> of<00:02:34.829> the<00:02:34.920> upper<00:02:35.750> part<00:02:36.750> of<00:02:36.840> the<00:02:36.900> hand

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
too much of the upper part of the hand

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.619 
too much of the upper part of the hand
now<00:02:38.040> when<00:02:38.280> I<00:02:38.310> see<00:02:38.609> something<00:02:38.849> like<00:02:39.000> this<00:02:39.359> in

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:39.629 
now when I see something like this in

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:41.059 
now when I see something like this in
here<00:02:39.870> I'm<00:02:40.049> not<00:02:40.260> going<00:02:40.500> to<00:02:40.590> sit<00:02:40.799> there<00:02:41.010> and

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:41.069 
here I'm not going to sit there and

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:43.640 
here I'm not going to sit there and
concentrate<00:02:41.879> on<00:02:41.909> using<00:02:42.480> that<00:02:42.510> that<00:02:43.019> rotate

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
concentrate on using that that rotate

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.059 
concentrate on using that that rotate
maneuver<00:02:44.400> using<00:02:44.819> the<00:02:44.939> transpose<00:02:45.510> tool

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
maneuver using the transpose tool

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:48.890 
maneuver using the transpose tool
because<00:02:47.069> I<00:02:47.099> know<00:02:47.340> there<00:02:47.730> is<00:02:47.879> much<00:02:48.359> better<00:02:48.659> ways

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
because I know there is much better ways

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.740 
because I know there is much better ways
of<00:02:49.670> just<00:02:50.670> going<00:02:50.849> in<00:02:51.060> here<00:02:51.239> with<00:02:51.389> the<00:02:51.510> move<00:02:51.720> tool

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
of just going in here with the move tool

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.190 
of just going in here with the move tool
at<00:02:52.680> a<00:02:52.709> lower<00:02:53.069> level<00:02:53.220> and<00:02:53.790> then<00:02:54.629> kind<00:02:54.840> of<00:02:54.989> moving

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
at a lower level and then kind of moving

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.390 
at a lower level and then kind of moving
stuff<00:02:55.769> around<00:02:55.889> so<00:02:56.400> I<00:02:57.269> would<00:02:57.989> just<00:02:58.109> kind<00:02:58.439> of<00:02:58.560> do

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
stuff around so I would just kind of do

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:42.100 
stuff around so I would just kind of do
one<00:02:59.549> of<00:02:59.579> these<00:02:59.730> maneuvers<00:03:00.239> to<00:03:00.269> it

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.110 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:44.050 

alright<00:03:42.500> so<00:03:42.800> there<00:03:42.980> we<00:03:43.100> go<00:03:43.280> now<00:03:43.580> it's<00:03:43.790> more

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
alright so there we go now it's more

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.310 
alright so there we go now it's more
lined<00:03:44.330> up<00:03:44.600> to<00:03:44.900> an<00:03:45.250> actual<00:03:46.250> hand<00:03:46.760> and<00:03:47.170> we<00:03:48.170> can

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:48.320 
lined up to an actual hand and we can

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.290 
lined up to an actual hand and we can
start<00:03:48.530> playing<00:03:48.830> around<00:03:49.100> with<00:03:49.520> the<00:03:49.700> lower<00:03:49.910> mesh

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:50.300 
start playing around with the lower mesh

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.110 
start playing around with the lower mesh
a<00:03:50.540> little<00:03:50.780> bit<00:03:50.900> better
