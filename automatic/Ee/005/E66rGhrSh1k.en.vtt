00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
about some basic stuff like temperature

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:09.440 
about some basic stuff like temperature
lighting<00:01:04.880> humidity<00:01:06.409> food<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:08.189> the<00:01:08.939> setup<00:01:09.299> of

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
lighting humidity food and the setup of

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.539 
lighting humidity food and the setup of
the<00:01:09.570> habitat<00:01:09.930> um<00:01:11.360> so<00:01:12.799> optimal<00:01:13.799> temperature

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
the habitat um so optimal temperature

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.850 
the habitat um so optimal temperature
range<00:01:14.850> for<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.420> crested<00:01:15.930> gecko<00:01:16.259> is<00:01:16.290> anywhere

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860 
range for a crested gecko is anywhere

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:23.690 
range for a crested gecko is anywhere
between<00:01:17.000> 75<00:01:18.000> and<00:01:18.890> 80<00:01:20.270> or<00:01:21.270> excuse<00:01:21.780> me<00:01:21.810> 65<00:01:22.460> to<00:01:23.460> 80

between 75 and 80 or excuse me 65 to 80
you<00:01:24.509> don't<00:01:24.689> want<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:24.930> exceed<00:01:25.380> 80<00:01:25.740> for<00:01:26.460> the<00:01:26.490> most

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
you don't want to exceed 80 for the most

you don't want to exceed 80 for the most
you<00:01:27.509> know<00:01:27.630> optimal<00:01:28.229> temperature<00:01:28.799> is<00:01:29.130> going<00:01:29.520> to

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
you know optimal temperature is going to

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:36.310 
you know optimal temperature is going to
be<00:01:29.820> about<00:01:29.970> 75<00:01:31.430> um<00:01:32.840> I<00:01:33.840> have<00:01:34.619> a<00:01:34.650> digital

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
be about 75 um I have a digital

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.090 
be about 75 um I have a digital
thermometer<00:01:37.320> and<00:01:38.420> it's<00:01:39.420> reading<00:01:39.689> about<00:01:40.100> 78

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
thermometer and it's reading about 78

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:49.399 
thermometer and it's reading about 78
right<00:01:41.820> now<00:01:44.299> um<00:01:45.560> uh<00:01:46.560> and<00:01:47.180> yeah<00:01:48.180> so<00:01:48.810> you<00:01:49.259> don't

right now um uh and yeah so you don't

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.830 
right now um uh and yeah so you don't
want<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:49.619> get<00:01:49.799> them<00:01:49.890> to<00:01:50.100> hot<00:01:50.340> like<00:01:50.840> anything

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
want to get them to hot like anything

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.810 
want to get them to hot like anything
above<00:01:52.110> 80<00:01:52.409> degrees<00:01:52.829> for<00:01:53.250> an<00:01:53.340> extended<00:01:53.790> period

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
above 80 degrees for an extended period

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.270 
above 80 degrees for an extended period
of<00:01:54.119> time<00:01:54.290> especially<00:01:55.290> upwards<00:01:55.950> of<00:01:56.100> eighty

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
of time especially upwards of eighty

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.399 
of time especially upwards of eighty
five<00:01:56.549> or<00:01:56.880> higher<00:01:56.909> can<00:01:57.509> cause<00:01:57.659> severe<00:01:58.020> stress

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
five or higher can cause severe stress

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.249 
five or higher can cause severe stress
and<00:01:58.770> can<00:01:59.640> kill<00:01:59.850> your<00:02:00.060> crested<00:02:00.630> geckos<00:02:00.960> so<00:02:01.200> you

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
and can kill your crested geckos so you

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:06.469 
and can kill your crested geckos so you
don't<00:02:01.530> want<00:02:01.649> to<00:02:01.710> exceed<00:02:02.420> 80<00:02:03.420> usually<00:02:04.409> and<00:02:05.479> you

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
don't want to exceed 80 usually and you

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.139 
don't want to exceed 80 usually and you
know<00:02:06.649> so<00:02:07.649> it's<00:02:07.860> best<00:02:08.280> just<00:02:08.399> to<00:02:08.580> keep<00:02:08.759> them<00:02:08.910> kind

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
know so it's best just to keep them kind

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.510 
know so it's best just to keep them kind
of<00:02:09.239> cool<00:02:09.450> they<00:02:09.989> don't<00:02:10.200> need<00:02:10.379> any<00:02:10.590> heat<00:02:10.950> lamps

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
of cool they don't need any heat lamps

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.120 
of cool they don't need any heat lamps
because<00:02:13.600> 65<00:02:14.600> to<00:02:14.720> 75<00:02:15.080> is<00:02:15.320> usually<00:02:15.860> room

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
because 65 to 75 is usually room

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:17.920 
because 65 to 75 is usually room
temperature<00:02:16.730> so<00:02:17.030> you<00:02:17.240> don't<00:02:17.420> need<00:02:17.570> any<00:02:17.690> heat

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
temperature so you don't need any heat

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.660 
temperature so you don't need any heat
lamps<00:02:18.200> as<00:02:18.320> long<00:02:18.470> as<00:02:18.620> you're<00:02:18.740> you<00:02:19.460> know<00:02:19.580> the

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
lamps as long as you're you know the

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.940 
lamps as long as you're you know the
room<00:02:19.850> you're<00:02:20.420> crested<00:02:20.840> gecko<00:02:21.200> is<00:02:21.230> then<00:02:21.620> stays

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
room you're crested gecko is then stays

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:27.160 
room you're crested gecko is then stays
around<00:02:22.280> 65<00:02:22.850> to<00:02:23.090> 75<00:02:23.540> your<00:02:23.930> you're<00:02:24.500> good<00:02:24.770> and<00:02:26.170> as

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
around 65 to 75 your you're good and as

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.000 
around 65 to 75 your you're good and as
far<00:02:28.070> as<00:02:28.130> like<00:02:28.520> UVB<00:02:29.120> they're<00:02:29.480> nocturnal<00:02:30.140> in<00:02:30.530> the

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
far as like UVB they're nocturnal in the

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.690 
far as like UVB they're nocturnal in the
wild<00:02:31.430> so<00:02:31.940> they<00:02:32.930> don't<00:02:33.140> need<00:02:33.380> any<00:02:33.710> UVB<00:02:34.400> lights

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
wild so they don't need any UVB lights

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.260 
wild so they don't need any UVB lights
but<00:02:35.540> if<00:02:35.960> you<00:02:36.230> are<00:02:36.260> going<00:02:36.830> to<00:02:37.100> have<00:02:37.400> a<00:02:37.790> light<00:02:38.060> on

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:38.270 
but if you are going to have a light on

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:41.830 
but if you are going to have a light on
your<00:02:39.070> enclosure<00:02:40.120> so<00:02:41.120> that<00:02:41.330> you<00:02:41.420> could<00:02:41.570> view<00:02:41.780> it

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
your enclosure so that you could view it

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.860 
your enclosure so that you could view it
better<00:02:42.740> and<00:02:43.010> we're<00:02:43.220> pretty<00:02:43.400> I<00:02:43.690> want<00:02:44.690> to<00:02:44.780> just

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
better and we're pretty I want to just

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.280 
better and we're pretty I want to just
recommend<00:02:45.380> going<00:02:45.530> ahead<00:02:45.740> and<00:02:45.950> just<00:02:46.100> getting<00:02:46.430> a

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
recommend going ahead and just getting a

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.580 
recommend going ahead and just getting a
UVB<00:02:48.290> like<00:02:49.190> a<00:02:49.220> UVB<00:02:49.790> like<00:02:50.210> a<00:02:50.240> five-point<00:02:50.960> ouv<00:02:51.440> be

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
UVB like a UVB like a five-point ouv be

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:53.740 
UVB like a UVB like a five-point ouv be
like<00:02:51.800> for<00:02:51.980> tropical<00:02:52.190> reptiles<00:02:52.850> because<00:02:53.630> it

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
like for tropical reptiles because it

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.950 
like for tropical reptiles because it
doesn't<00:02:54.020> admit<00:02:54.380> as<00:02:54.590> much<00:02:54.650> UVB<00:02:55.640> as<00:02:55.880> the<00:02:56.630> desert

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:56.960 
doesn't admit as much UVB as the desert

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.550 
doesn't admit as much UVB as the desert
UV<00:02:57.290> bees<00:02:57.880> and<00:02:58.880> UVB<00:02:59.630> is<00:02:59.960> good<00:03:00.200> even<00:03:00.410> for

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
UV bees and UVB is good even for

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.250 
UV bees and UVB is good even for
nocturnal<00:03:01.550> reptiles<00:03:02.300> like<00:03:02.510> crested<00:03:03.260> geckos

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
nocturnal reptiles like crested geckos

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.940 
nocturnal reptiles like crested geckos
because<00:03:06.260> they<00:03:06.620> it<00:03:07.300> stimulates<00:03:08.300> their

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
because they it stimulates their

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:19.620 
because they it stimulates their
behavior<00:03:09.950> and<00:03:10.250> their<00:03:11.080> appetite<00:03:15.070> and<00:03:17.110> all<00:03:18.110> that

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
behavior and their appetite and all that

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.180 
behavior and their appetite and all that
and<00:03:20.630> it<00:03:20.900> gives<00:03:21.080> them<00:03:21.200> a<00:03:21.320> more<00:03:21.440> realistic<00:03:21.830> day

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
and it gives them a more realistic day

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.940 
and it gives them a more realistic day
and<00:03:22.340> night<00:03:22.430> cycle<00:03:22.790> um<00:03:23.140> so<00:03:24.140> UV<00:03:24.410> bees<00:03:24.590> are<00:03:24.770> good

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:24.950 
and night cycle um so UV bees are good

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:32.020 
and night cycle um so UV bees are good
and<00:03:25.190> then<00:03:27.160> so<00:03:28.160> as<00:03:28.540> far<00:03:29.540> as<00:03:29.830> humidity<00:03:30.830> you<00:03:31.820> want

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.030 
and then so as far as humidity you want

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.500 
and then so as far as humidity you want
to<00:03:32.239> do<00:03:32.540> a<00:03:32.570> light<00:03:33.110> misting<00:03:33.950> in<00:03:34.220> the<00:03:34.880> morning<00:03:35.300> at

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
to do a light misting in the morning at

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.150 
to do a light misting in the morning at
a<00:03:35.630> heavy<00:03:35.840> misting<00:03:36.290> at<00:03:36.410> night<00:03:36.620> like<00:03:36.980> where

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:37.160 
a heavy misting at night like where

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.060 
a heavy misting at night like where
they're<00:03:37.280> from<00:03:37.489> naturally<00:03:38.390> um<00:03:39.070> they're

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:40.070 
they're from naturally um they're

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:42.100 
they're from naturally um they're
subtropical<00:03:40.910> so<00:03:41.180> they<00:03:41.330> don't<00:03:41.540> need<00:03:41.690> to<00:03:41.870> stay

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:42.110 
subtropical so they don't need to stay

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:45.280 
subtropical so they don't need to stay
damp<00:03:42.770> or<00:03:43.100> high<00:03:43.820> humidity<00:03:44.120> all<00:03:44.600> day<00:03:44.870> and<00:03:45.230> all

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:45.290 
damp or high humidity all day and all

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.790 
damp or high humidity all day and all
night<00:03:45.590> it's<00:03:45.890> best<00:03:46.130> that<00:03:46.340> it<00:03:46.520> naturally<00:03:47.209> drops

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:47.800 
night it's best that it naturally drops

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:50.199 
night it's best that it naturally drops
to<00:03:48.800> a<00:03:48.830> lower<00:03:48.920> humidity<00:03:49.489> level<00:03:50.030> like

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:50.209 
to a lower humidity level like

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:53.770 
to a lower humidity level like
throughout<00:03:50.690> the<00:03:50.930> day<00:03:51.850> so<00:03:52.850> like<00:03:53.360> right<00:03:53.600> now<00:03:53.750> my

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
throughout the day so like right now my

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:59.140 
throughout the day so like right now my
humidity<00:03:54.650> is<00:03:55.310> about<00:03:56.950> 70<00:03:57.950> or<00:03:58.070> so<00:03:58.340> because<00:03:58.940> I

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
humidity is about 70 or so because I

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:02.590 
humidity is about 70 or so because I
just<00:03:59.360> misted<00:03:59.660> it<00:03:59.750> um<00:04:01.150> which<00:04:02.150> normally<00:04:02.450> I<00:04:02.540> don't

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:02.600 
just misted it um which normally I don't

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.880 
just misted it um which normally I don't
do<00:04:02.840> but<00:04:03.640> it<00:04:04.640> was<00:04:05.060> like<00:04:05.390> 30<00:04:05.930> or<00:04:06.140> 20<00:04:06.470> before<00:04:06.680> I

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:06.890 
do but it was like 30 or 20 before I

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:15.040 
do but it was like 30 or 20 before I
miss<00:04:07.070> did<00:04:07.280> it<00:04:09.130> so<00:04:11.380> that's<00:04:12.380> like<00:04:12.620> misting<00:04:14.050> then

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:15.050 
miss did it so that's like misting then

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:21.580 
miss did it so that's like misting then
as<00:04:15.560> far<00:04:15.950> as<00:04:16.720> food<00:04:18.370> they<00:04:19.370> are<00:04:19.400> arboreal<00:04:20.120> so<00:04:21.049> they

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
as far as food they are arboreal so they

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.320 
as far as food they are arboreal so they
don't<00:04:21.739> like<00:04:21.890> to<00:04:21.919> really<00:04:22.190> come<00:04:22.490> down<00:04:22.760> to<00:04:23.150> eat

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
don't like to really come down to eat

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:24.430 
don't like to really come down to eat
unless<00:04:23.539> they're<00:04:23.870> hunting<00:04:24.200> for

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
unless they're hunting for

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.370 
unless they're hunting for
crickets<00:04:24.800> um<00:04:25.630> they<00:04:26.630> do<00:04:26.690> like<00:04:26.960> to<00:04:27.080> eat<00:04:27.170> crickets

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.380 
crickets um they do like to eat crickets

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.080 
crickets um they do like to eat crickets
feeding<00:04:27.890> them<00:04:27.980> a<00:04:28.070> few<00:04:28.220> crickets<00:04:28.580> like<00:04:28.760> once<00:04:28.970> a

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
feeding them a few crickets like once a

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.320 
feeding them a few crickets like once a
week<00:04:29.270> is<00:04:29.510> good<00:04:29.810> give<00:04:30.320> them<00:04:30.440> their<00:04:30.560> protein<00:04:31.330> and

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
week is good give them their protein and

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.140 
week is good give them their protein and
then<00:04:32.780> to<00:04:33.170> feed<00:04:33.410> them<00:04:33.710> some<00:04:34.700> sort<00:04:34.940> of<00:04:35.030> meal

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
then to feed them some sort of meal

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:42.340 
then to feed them some sort of meal
replacement<00:04:35.780> powder<00:04:36.020> such<00:04:36.740> as<00:04:39.640> repa<00:04:40.640> she<00:04:40.940> is<00:04:41.350> a

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:42.350 
replacement powder such as repa she is a

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:43.720 
replacement powder such as repa she is a
pretty<00:04:42.650> good<00:04:42.860> brand<00:04:43.130> I<00:04:43.310> mean<00:04:43.460> there's<00:04:43.580> also

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:43.730 
pretty good brand I mean there's also

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:46.840 
pretty good brand I mean there's also
t-rex<00:04:44.510> and<00:04:45.050> some<00:04:45.830> other<00:04:46.010> brands<00:04:46.730> out<00:04:46.790> there

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:46.850 
t-rex and some other brands out there

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:50.500 
t-rex and some other brands out there
but<00:04:47.300> I<00:04:47.570> think<00:04:48.230> repitch<00:04:48.500> is<00:04:48.680> probably<00:04:49.340> the<00:04:49.940> you

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:50.510 
but I think repitch is probably the you

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:52.990 
but I think repitch is probably the you
know<00:04:50.600> best<00:04:50.780> formulated<00:04:51.530> and<00:04:51.740> then<00:04:52.490> if<00:04:52.760> you<00:04:52.850> can

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 
know best formulated and then if you can

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.970 
know best formulated and then if you can
get<00:04:53.120> like<00:04:53.300> a<00:04:53.330> dish<00:04:54.170> that<00:04:54.380> you<00:04:54.470> could<00:04:54.650> stick

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:54.980 
get like a dish that you could stick

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:58.840 
get like a dish that you could stick
high<00:04:55.370> up<00:04:56.260> on<00:04:57.260> the<00:04:57.320> enclosure<00:04:57.860> like<00:04:58.580> I<00:04:58.700> have

00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:58.850 
high up on the enclosure like I have

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:01.690 
high up on the enclosure like I have
this<00:04:58.970> little<00:04:59.030> leaf<00:04:59.390> suction<00:05:00.200> cup<00:05:00.490> thing<00:05:01.490> to

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:01.700 
this little leaf suction cup thing to

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.670 
this little leaf suction cup thing to
put<00:05:01.880> his<00:05:02.180> rep<00:05:02.390> rhian<00:05:02.750> you<00:05:03.020> can<00:05:03.140> also<00:05:03.260> get<00:05:03.500> like

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680 
put his rep rhian you can also get like

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:06.220 
put his rep rhian you can also get like
the<00:05:03.830> magnetic<00:05:04.340> ones<00:05:04.720> anything<00:05:05.720> to<00:05:05.870> just<00:05:06.050> get

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:06.230 
the magnetic ones anything to just get

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:08.290 
the magnetic ones anything to just get
the<00:05:06.530> food<00:05:06.740> off<00:05:07.010> of<00:05:07.040> the<00:05:07.280> ground<00:05:07.490> will<00:05:07.820> increase

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:08.300 
the food off of the ground will increase

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:09.700 
the food off of the ground will increase
the<00:05:08.480> likelihood<00:05:08.600> that<00:05:08.900> they'll<00:05:09.170> actually<00:05:09.350> eat

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:09.710 
the likelihood that they'll actually eat

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:17.170 
the likelihood that they'll actually eat
it<00:05:12.700> and<00:05:14.170> as<00:05:15.170> far<00:05:15.320> as<00:05:15.500> water<00:05:15.770> goes<00:05:16.070> there<00:05:16.790> do

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:17.180 
it and as far as water goes there do

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:20.440 
it and as far as water goes there do
lapping<00:05:17.660> reptiles<00:05:18.200> so<00:05:18.800> they<00:05:19.220> typically<00:05:20.090> drink

00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:20.450 
lapping reptiles so they typically drink

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:24.070 
lapping reptiles so they typically drink
water<00:05:20.690> from<00:05:21.010> the<00:05:22.090> do<00:05:23.090> that's<00:05:23.480> you<00:05:23.990> know

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.080 
water from the do that's you know

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.240 
water from the do that's you know
accumulates<00:05:24.530> when<00:05:24.740> you're<00:05:24.860> misting<00:05:25.340> and<00:05:27.250> you

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:28.250 
accumulates when you're misting and you

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:30.250 
accumulates when you're misting and you
can<00:05:28.460> leave<00:05:28.669> a<00:05:28.700> water<00:05:29.060> dish<00:05:29.360> in<00:05:29.570> there<00:05:29.720> for<00:05:30.020> them

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:30.260 
can leave a water dish in there for them

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:32.920 
can leave a water dish in there for them
but<00:05:31.010> typically<00:05:31.310> they<00:05:31.850> just<00:05:32.060> drink<00:05:32.330> the<00:05:32.750> water

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:32.930 
but typically they just drink the water

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:35.110 
but typically they just drink the water
off<00:05:33.140> of<00:05:33.169> beliefs<00:05:33.620> and<00:05:33.890> plus<00:05:34.610> they<00:05:34.730> get<00:05:34.880> it<00:05:34.970> from

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:35.120 
off of beliefs and plus they get it from

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:37.450
