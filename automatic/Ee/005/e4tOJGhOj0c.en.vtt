king<00:00:20.860> shot<00:00:21.070> megaminx<00:00:21.430> I<00:00:21.700> did<00:00:22.449> the<00:00:22.540> flooring

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:22.840 
king shot megaminx I did the flooring

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.510 
king shot megaminx I did the flooring
mytilus<00:00:23.230> cube<00:00:23.590> and<00:00:23.800> there<00:00:24.279> will<00:00:24.400> be<00:00:24.490> a

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:24.520 
mytilus cube and there will be a

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.640 
mytilus cube and there will be a
tutorial<00:00:24.849> soon<00:00:25.180> if<00:00:25.419> you<00:00:25.540> choose<00:00:25.990> to<00:00:26.259> modify

your<00:00:26.890> mega<00:00:27.130> mix<00:00:27.340> as<00:00:27.520> well<00:00:28.890> the<00:00:29.890> appearance

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.130 
your mega mix as well the appearance

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.460 
your mega mix as well the appearance
this<00:00:30.369> cube<00:00:30.820> is<00:00:31.059> still<00:00:31.540> pretty<00:00:31.720> much<00:00:31.960> the<00:00:32.200> same

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:32.470 
this cube is still pretty much the same

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.549 
this cube is still pretty much the same
i<00:00:32.860> use<00:00:33.700> the<00:00:33.880> guideline<00:00:34.239> as<00:00:34.420> the<00:00:34.600> stickers<00:00:35.020> so<00:00:35.530> i

00:00:35.549 --> 00:00:35.559 
i use the guideline as the stickers so i

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:37.229 
i use the guideline as the stickers so i
did<00:00:35.860> not<00:00:36.010> go<00:00:36.190> over<00:00:36.219> any<00:00:36.489> of<00:00:36.640> the<00:00:36.700> stickers<00:00:37.059> but

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:37.239 
did not go over any of the stickers but

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:39.120 
did not go over any of the stickers but
the<00:00:37.420> holes<00:00:37.630> are<00:00:37.840> slightly<00:00:38.350> bigger<00:00:38.590> as<00:00:38.860> you<00:00:38.980> can

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:39.130 
the holes are slightly bigger as you can

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:41.670 
the holes are slightly bigger as you can
see<00:00:39.399> here<00:00:39.910> so<00:00:40.450> the<00:00:40.750> turning<00:00:41.079> of<00:00:41.140> this<00:00:41.320> cube<00:00:41.559> has

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:41.680 
see here so the turning of this cube has

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.590 
see here so the turning of this cube has
not<00:00:41.890> really<00:00:42.100> changed<00:00:42.550> is<00:00:42.730> still<00:00:42.940> very<00:00:43.120> smooth

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:43.600 
not really changed is still very smooth

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.900 
not really changed is still very smooth
fast<00:00:43.989> and<00:00:44.320> airy<00:00:44.530> but<00:00:44.649> I<00:00:44.890> think<00:00:45.190> it<00:00:45.309> has<00:00:45.520> gotten

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:45.910 
fast and airy but I think it has gotten

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:47.849 
fast and airy but I think it has gotten
just<00:00:46.180> a<00:00:46.270> little<00:00:46.480> bit<00:00:46.570> faster<00:00:46.749> but<00:00:47.559> I<00:00:47.620> did

00:00:47.849 --> 00:00:47.859 
just a little bit faster but I did

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:50.549 
just a little bit faster but I did
loosen<00:00:48.370> the<00:00:48.460> tensions<00:00:48.879> just<00:00:49.510> a<00:00:49.690> tiny<00:00:50.019> bit<00:00:50.170> so

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:50.559 
loosen the tensions just a tiny bit so

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:52.319 
loosen the tensions just a tiny bit so
it<00:00:50.649> might<00:00:50.800> be<00:00:50.829> because<00:00:51.039> of<00:00:51.190> that<00:00:51.489> but<00:00:51.999> it's

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:52.329 
it might be because of that but it's

00:00:52.329 --> 00:01:08.260 
it might be because of that but it's
still<00:00:52.749> very<00:00:53.289> nice

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.919 

it's<00:01:08.990> just<00:01:09.710> really<00:01:10.009> fast<00:01:10.369> and<00:01:10.820> awesome<00:01:11.299> it's

00:01:11.919 --> 00:01:11.929 
it's just really fast and awesome it's

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:14.980 
it's just really fast and awesome it's
still<00:01:12.259> super<00:01:12.649> smooth<00:01:13.189> I<00:01:13.600> think<00:01:14.600> one<00:01:14.840> of<00:01:14.869> the

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
still super smooth I think one of the

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:16.660 
still super smooth I think one of the
reasons<00:01:15.140> it<00:01:15.409> may<00:01:15.590> have<00:01:15.770> gotten<00:01:16.009> faster<00:01:16.280> if<00:01:16.549> it

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:16.670 
reasons it may have gotten faster if it

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.609 
reasons it may have gotten faster if it
now<00:01:16.789> if<00:01:17.090> it's<00:01:17.360> not<00:01:17.450> because<00:01:17.810> the<00:01:17.960> tensions<00:01:18.469> is

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
now if it's not because the tensions is

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:21.459 
now if it's not because the tensions is
because<00:01:18.950> the<00:01:19.579> pieces<00:01:19.969> have<00:01:20.570> a<00:01:20.600> lot<00:01:20.810> of<00:01:20.840> contact

00:01:21.459 --> 00:01:21.469 
because the pieces have a lot of contact

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:24.190 
because the pieces have a lot of contact
points<00:01:21.890> like<00:01:22.189> if<00:01:22.460> I<00:01:23.030> was<00:01:23.359> to<00:01:23.630> pull<00:01:23.840> them<00:01:24.020> out

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
points like if I was to pull them out

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.740 
points like if I was to pull them out
before<00:01:24.619> I'm<00:01:24.950> added<00:01:25.250> them<00:01:25.399> there<00:01:26.240> isn't<00:01:26.569> much

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.750 
before I'm added them there isn't much

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.690 
before I'm added them there isn't much
space<00:01:27.229> in<00:01:27.530> between<00:01:27.740> the<00:01:28.039> pieces<00:01:28.399> so<00:01:28.490> there's<00:01:28.610> a

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
space in between the pieces so there's a

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.389 
space in between the pieces so there's a
lot<00:01:28.819> of<00:01:28.880> friction<00:01:29.360> and<00:01:29.810> I<00:01:30.380> think<00:01:30.709> that's<00:01:30.979> with

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:31.399 
lot of friction and I think that's with

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:33.130 
lot of friction and I think that's with
the<00:01:31.549> mod<00:01:31.729> it<00:01:32.209> got<00:01:32.450> rid<00:01:32.600> of<00:01:32.630> some<00:01:32.899> of<00:01:32.929> that

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140 
the mod it got rid of some of that

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.969 
the mod it got rid of some of that
friction<00:01:33.740> so<00:01:33.920> it<00:01:34.009> might<00:01:34.189> have<00:01:35.469> made<00:01:36.469> the<00:01:36.649> speed

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:36.979 
friction so it might have made the speed

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.240 
friction so it might have made the speed
a<00:01:37.159> little<00:01:37.399> bit<00:01:37.549> faster<00:01:37.819> but<00:01:38.360> it's<00:01:38.689> still<00:01:39.250> very

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
a little bit faster but it's still very

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.460 
a little bit faster but it's still very
nice<00:01:40.549> even<00:01:41.119> if<00:01:41.239> it<00:01:41.780> was<00:01:41.899> just<00:01:42.110> because<00:01:42.229> of<00:01:42.439> the

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
nice even if it was just because of the

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:47.080 
nice even if it was just because of the
tensions<00:01:45.340> the<00:01:46.340> cording<00:01:46.610> cutting<00:01:46.849> on<00:01:46.939> this

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
tensions the cording cutting on this

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.359 
tensions the cording cutting on this
cube<00:01:47.360> is<00:01:47.509> still<00:01:47.989> as<00:01:48.259> great<00:01:48.770> as<00:01:48.920> it<00:01:48.950> was<00:01:49.189> before

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
cube is still as great as it was before

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:51.699 
cube is still as great as it was before
it<00:01:49.789> can<00:01:50.209> still<00:01:50.450> cut<00:01:50.599> line<00:01:50.780> to<00:01:50.929> line<00:01:51.049> easy<00:01:51.319> and

00:01:51.699 --> 00:01:51.709 
it can still cut line to line easy and

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:54.399 
it can still cut line to line easy and
on<00:01:51.979> some<00:01:52.189> sides<00:01:52.429> it<00:01:52.579> can<00:01:52.789> cut<00:01:53.060> 35<00:01:53.929> that<00:01:54.200> pulls

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.409 
on some sides it can cut 35 that pulls

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:56.440 
on some sides it can cut 35 that pulls
onto<00:01:54.560> 45<00:01:55.159> on<00:01:55.399> a<00:01:55.459> three<00:01:55.700> by<00:01:55.849> three<00:01:55.880> as<00:01:56.179> you<00:01:56.209> can

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
onto 45 on a three by three as you can

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.850 
onto 45 on a three by three as you can
see<00:01:56.659> here<00:01:57.049> but<00:01:57.920> you<00:01:58.610> do<00:01:58.789> have<00:01:58.939> to<00:01:59.119> force<00:01:59.390> it

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
see here but you do have to force it

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.830 
see here but you do have to force it
after<00:02:00.860> the<00:02:00.979> mud<00:02:01.159> this<00:02:01.429> cube<00:02:01.759> can<00:02:01.969> also<00:02:02.239> reverse

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
after the mud this cube can also reverse

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.660 
after the mud this cube can also reverse
corner<00:02:03.289> cut<00:02:03.469> before<00:02:03.890> the<00:02:04.159> mad<00:02:04.250> we<00:02:04.429> couldn't

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
corner cut before the mad we couldn't

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.279 
corner cut before the mad we couldn't
even<00:02:04.849> do<00:02:05.000> this<00:02:05.239> much<00:02:05.299> reverse<00:02:05.810> corner<00:02:06.079> cutting

00:02:06.279 --> 00:02:06.289 
even do this much reverse corner cutting

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:10.089 
even do this much reverse corner cutting
and<00:02:06.500> this<00:02:07.489> cuts<00:02:07.789> it<00:02:07.969> very<00:02:08.299> easy<00:02:08.720> I'd<00:02:09.709> say<00:02:09.950> it's

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:10.099 
and this cuts it very easy I'd say it's

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:16.240 
and this cuts it very easy I'd say it's
max<00:02:10.369> is<00:02:10.640> about<00:02:11.000> right<00:02:11.180> here<00:02:13.480> and<00:02:15.069> that's<00:02:16.069> all

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
max is about right here and that's all

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:17.500 
max is about right here and that's all
the<00:02:16.310> reverse<00:02:16.489> cutting<00:02:16.819> corner<00:02:17.209> fitting<00:02:17.420> I

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
the reverse cutting corner fitting I

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.090 
the reverse cutting corner fitting I
really<00:02:17.810> need<00:02:19.269> so<00:02:20.269> the<00:02:20.930> corner<00:02:21.560> cutting<00:02:21.739> has

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:22.100 
really need so the corner cutting has

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.550 
really need so the corner cutting has
definitely<00:02:22.790> improved<00:02:23.030> after<00:02:23.480> the<00:02:23.720> mat<00:02:23.930> so<00:02:24.530> I

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
definitely improved after the mat so I

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.819 
definitely improved after the mat so I
think<00:02:24.680> that<00:02:24.889> this<00:02:25.250> mod<00:02:25.489> is<00:02:25.519> very<00:02:25.940> helpful<00:02:26.180> in

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:26.829 
think that this mod is very helpful in

00:02:26.829 --> 00:02:29.650 
think that this mod is very helpful in
improving<00:02:27.829> corner<00:02:28.430> cutting<00:02:28.609> which<00:02:28.819> also<00:02:29.030> can

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
improving corner cutting which also can

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.870 
improving corner cutting which also can
reduce<00:02:29.930> lockups<00:02:30.530> lack<00:02:30.950> of<00:02:31.100> this<00:02:31.400> cube<00:02:31.700> are

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:31.880 
reduce lockups lack of this cube are

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.129 
reduce lockups lack of this cube are
very<00:02:32.120> minimal<00:02:32.569> now<00:02:33.730> it's<00:02:34.730> every<00:02:34.970> just<00:02:35.180> every

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:36.139 
very minimal now it's every just every

00:02:36.139 --> 00:02:38.710 
very minimal now it's every just every
once<00:02:36.170> in<00:02:36.530> a<00:02:36.560> while<00:02:36.739> like<00:02:37.010> ever<00:02:37.250> maybe<00:02:37.730> one<00:02:38.480> out

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
once in a while like ever maybe one out

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.530 
once in a while like ever maybe one out
of<00:02:38.920> one<00:02:39.920> time<00:02:40.160> out<00:02:40.310> of<00:02:40.430> three<00:02:40.730> or<00:02:40.880> four<00:02:41.120> solves

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:41.540 
of one time out of three or four solves

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.020 
of one time out of three or four solves
I<00:02:41.720> do<00:02:42.049> lock<00:02:42.440> up<00:02:42.680> and<00:02:42.889> that's<00:02:43.069> usually<00:02:43.250> my<00:02:43.730> fault

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
I do lock up and that's usually my fault

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.050 
I do lock up and that's usually my fault
because<00:02:44.750> of<00:02:44.959> my<00:02:45.049> crappy<00:02:45.410> turning<00:02:45.769> but<00:02:46.160> this

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
because of my crappy turning but this

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.860 
because of my crappy turning but this
cube<00:02:47.599> it<00:02:47.750> just<00:02:47.989> does<00:02:48.230> not<00:02:48.410> lock<00:02:48.620> off<00:02:48.859> anymore

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
cube it just does not lock off anymore

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.520 
cube it just does not lock off anymore
it<00:02:50.870> doesn't<00:02:51.440> pop<00:02:51.650> either<00:02:52.069> uh<00:02:53.230> even<00:02:54.230> with<00:02:54.380> the

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
it doesn't pop either uh even with the

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.710 
it doesn't pop either uh even with the
loose<00:02:54.739> or<00:02:54.889> tension<00:02:55.099> and<00:02:55.549> shaving<00:02:56.450> off<00:02:56.569> some

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
loose or tension and shaving off some

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.080 
loose or tension and shaving off some
plastic<00:02:57.109> it<00:02:57.319> still<00:02:57.919> never<00:02:58.099> pops<00:02:58.519> and<00:02:58.880> I<00:02:58.940> don't

00:02:59.080 --> 00:02:59.090 
plastic it still never pops and I don't

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:04.550 
plastic it still never pops and I don't
think<00:02:59.239> it<00:02:59.450> will<00:02:59.540> ever<00:02:59.599> pop<00:03:00.109> on<00:03:00.349> me

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.510 

overall<00:03:05.560> I<00:03:05.590> think<00:03:05.800> that<00:03:06.099> the<00:03:06.190> mob<00:03:06.340> was

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:06.520 
overall I think that the mob was

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.940 
overall I think that the mob was
definitely<00:03:07.240> worth<00:03:07.420> it<00:03:07.690> and<00:03:07.930> right<00:03:08.530> now<00:03:08.680> i'm

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
definitely worth it and right now i'm

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:12.270 
definitely worth it and right now i'm
going<00:03:09.340> to<00:03:09.489> show<00:03:09.849> you<00:03:09.880> guys<00:03:10.030> a<00:03:10.599> video<00:03:11.170> of<00:03:11.590> the

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:12.280 
going to show you guys a video of the

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:14.309 
going to show you guys a video of the
performance<00:03:12.430> before<00:03:13.030> and<00:03:13.510> after<00:03:13.870> the<00:03:13.900> mod<00:03:14.110> so

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 
performance before and after the mod so

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:15.780 
performance before and after the mod so
i'm<00:03:14.410> gonna<00:03:14.500> have<00:03:14.650> a<00:03:14.680> salt<00:03:15.099> before

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 
i'm gonna have a salt before

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.490 
i'm gonna have a salt before
modifications<00:03:16.690> and<00:03:16.840> solve<00:03:17.110> after<00:03:17.440> the

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
modifications and solve after the

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.350 
modifications and solve after the
modifications<00:03:18.099> and<00:03:18.280> you<00:03:18.400> can<00:03:18.520> see<00:03:18.790> the

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360 
modifications and you can see the

00:03:19.360 --> 00:05:39.740 
modifications and you can see the
improvement<00:03:20.140> of<00:03:20.230> the<00:03:20.380> cube

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:39.750 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:46.439
