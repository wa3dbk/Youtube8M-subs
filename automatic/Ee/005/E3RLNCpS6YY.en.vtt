it<00:00:00.840> how's<00:00:01.290> it<00:00:01.410> going<00:00:01.620> guys<00:00:01.770> so<00:00:02.460> I<00:00:02.850> got<00:00:03.179> a<00:00:03.210> bit<00:00:03.389> of

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
it how's it going guys so I got a bit of

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.619 
it how's it going guys so I got a bit of
a<00:00:03.600> novelty<00:00:03.929> item<00:00:04.290> for<00:00:04.830> you<00:00:04.950> today<00:00:05.220> I<00:00:05.629> was

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
a novelty item for you today I was

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.120 
a novelty item for you today I was
looking<00:00:06.870> through<00:00:06.899> some<00:00:07.109> of<00:00:07.350> sethbling<00:00:07.890> sold

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
looking through some of sethbling sold

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.060 
looking through some of sethbling sold
videos<00:00:08.490> as<00:00:08.760> I<00:00:08.880> do<00:00:09.300> know<00:00:09.480> and<00:00:09.630> then<00:00:09.750> and<00:00:10.070> he

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:11.070 
videos as I do know and then and he

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.740 
videos as I do know and then and he
uploaded<00:00:11.429> I<00:00:11.910> think<00:00:12.300> it<00:00:12.360> was<00:00:12.480> like<00:00:12.540> two<00:00:12.719> years

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
uploaded I think it was like two years

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.990 
uploaded I think it was like two years
ago<00:00:12.990> a<00:00:13.139> concept<00:00:13.559> for<00:00:13.710> this<00:00:13.830> redstone<00:00:14.759> this

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
ago a concept for this redstone this

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.779 
ago a concept for this redstone this
computer<00:00:15.450> so<00:00:16.230> what<00:00:16.770> I<00:00:16.800> did<00:00:16.890> was<00:00:17.070> I<00:00:17.400> took<00:00:17.430> his

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
computer so what I did was I took his

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.150 
computer so what I did was I took his
concept<00:00:18.270> and<00:00:18.449> made<00:00:18.869> really<00:00:19.320> the<00:00:19.560> smallest

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
concept and made really the smallest

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.980 
concept and made really the smallest
computer<00:00:20.880> possible<00:00:21.420> out<00:00:21.810> of<00:00:22.230> his<00:00:22.529> designs<00:00:23.990> how

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
computer possible out of his designs how

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.900 
computer possible out of his designs how
this<00:00:25.109> thing<00:00:25.320> is<00:00:25.439> really<00:00:25.800> just<00:00:26.189> a<00:00:26.340> novelty<00:00:26.670> it's

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
this thing is really just a novelty it's

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.240 
this thing is really just a novelty it's
absolutely<00:00:27.599> pointless<00:00:27.810> an<00:00:28.109> outdated<00:00:28.410> but<00:00:29.099> it

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
absolutely pointless an outdated but it

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.279 
absolutely pointless an outdated but it
looks<00:00:29.820> cool<00:00:30.060> and<00:00:30.390> I<00:00:30.660> think<00:00:30.869> it's<00:00:30.960> pretty<00:00:31.080> cool

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
looks cool and I think it's pretty cool

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.229 
looks cool and I think it's pretty cool
so<00:00:31.500> i<00:00:31.529> thought<00:00:31.740> i'd<00:00:31.890> show<00:00:32.040> you<00:00:32.070> guys<00:00:32.309> but<00:00:33.210> uh

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
so i thought i'd show you guys but uh

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:35.420 
so i thought i'd show you guys but uh
what<00:00:33.750> i<00:00:33.780> have<00:00:33.960> here<00:00:34.110> is<00:00:34.230> a<00:00:34.260> binary<00:00:34.590> adder<00:00:35.010> so

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
what i have here is a binary adder so

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.670 
what i have here is a binary adder so
first<00:00:36.059> let<00:00:36.180> me<00:00:36.239> explain<00:00:36.360> settlings<00:00:37.170> concept

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
first let me explain settlings concept

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.040 
first let me explain settlings concept
to<00:00:37.800> you<00:00:37.860> guys<00:00:38.040> which<00:00:38.309> is<00:00:38.340> that<00:00:38.719> for<00:00:39.719> a<00:00:39.750> wireless

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
to you guys which is that for a wireless

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.920 
to you guys which is that for a wireless
redstone<00:00:40.500> system<00:00:41.160> or<00:00:41.610> for<00:00:41.879> a<00:00:41.910> redstone<00:00:42.570> 'less

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
redstone system or for a redstone 'less

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.690 
redstone system or for a redstone 'less
wire<00:00:43.820> system<00:00:44.820> yeah<00:00:45.149> that's<00:00:45.390> it<00:00:46.550> you<00:00:47.550> have<00:00:47.670> a

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
wire system yeah that's it you have a

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.580 
wire system yeah that's it you have a
piston<00:00:48.120> fish<00:00:48.300> and<00:00:48.450> act<00:00:48.629> of<00:00:48.780> betrayal<00:00:49.140> under<00:00:49.559> a

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
piston fish and act of betrayal under a

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.279 
piston fish and act of betrayal under a
mine<00:00:49.829> cart<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.300> then<00:00:51.300> that<00:00:51.510> turns<00:00:52.050> on<00:00:52.170> the

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
mine cart and then that turns on the

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.260 
mine cart and then that turns on the
next<00:00:52.500> pest<00:00:52.710> in<00:00:52.920> turns<00:00:53.129> on<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.370> next<00:00:53.550> minecart

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
next pest in turns on the next minecart

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.630 
next pest in turns on the next minecart
activate<00:00:55.230> oreo<00:00:55.469> and<00:00:55.530> so<00:00:55.800> on<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:56.010> so<00:00:56.100> forth<00:00:56.190> so

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
activate oreo and so on and so forth so

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.840 
activate oreo and so on and so forth so
you<00:00:56.730> can<00:00:56.850> make<00:00:56.969> redstone<00:00:57.360> miss<00:00:57.780> wires<00:00:58.789> now<00:00:59.789> you

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
you can make redstone miss wires now you

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.479 
you can make redstone miss wires now you
could<00:01:00.329> argue<00:01:00.359> that<00:01:00.809> it's<00:01:01.379> using<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.160> redstone

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
could argue that it's using a redstone

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.830 
could argue that it's using a redstone
signal<00:01:02.850> to<00:01:03.449> power<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:04.159> piston<00:01:05.210> but<00:01:06.210> now<00:01:06.600> no

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
signal to power the piston but now no

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.770 
signal to power the piston but now no
there's<00:01:07.350> no<00:01:07.500> actual<00:01:07.710> redstone<00:01:08.670> components<00:01:09.659> in

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
there's no actual redstone components in

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.039 
there's no actual redstone components in
it<00:01:09.810> so<00:01:10.140> I<00:01:10.380> counted<00:01:10.799> as<00:01:10.950> redstone<00:01:11.460> list<00:01:11.700> but<00:01:12.049> so

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
it so I counted as redstone list but so

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.010 
it so I counted as redstone list but so
what<00:01:13.229> I<00:01:13.260> built<00:01:13.500> here<00:01:14.330> is<00:01:15.330> a<00:01:15.390> binary<00:01:15.689> adder

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
what I built here is a binary adder

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.780 
what I built here is a binary adder
which<00:01:16.290> means<00:01:16.560> we<00:01:16.830> have<00:01:16.920> three<00:01:17.189> inputs<00:01:17.549> one

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
which means we have three inputs one

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.880 
which means we have three inputs one
there<00:01:18.060> one<00:01:18.780> here<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.080> one<00:01:19.140> here<00:01:19.259> all<00:01:19.590> these

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
there one here and one here all these

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.280 
there one here and one here all these
are<00:01:20.100> worth<00:01:20.220> one<00:01:20.549> and<00:01:20.850> then<00:01:21.630> we<00:01:21.750> have<00:01:21.840> an<00:01:21.960> output

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
are worth one and then we have an output

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.870 
are worth one and then we have an output
to<00:01:23.040> output<00:01:23.430> signals<00:01:24.180> that<00:01:24.900> output<00:01:25.320> out<00:01:25.920> output

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
to output signals that output out output

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.640 
to output signals that output out output
is<00:01:27.000> worth<00:01:27.180> one<00:01:27.420> and<00:01:27.659> this<00:01:27.780> output<00:01:28.259> is<00:01:28.439> worth

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
is worth one and this output is worth

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.700 
is worth one and this output is worth
two<00:01:29.100> so<00:01:30.000> it<00:01:30.420> converts<00:01:30.840> these<00:01:31.020> three<00:01:31.290> signals

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
two so it converts these three signals

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.219 
two so it converts these three signals
into<00:01:31.979> binary<00:01:32.240> anyway<00:01:33.240> so<00:01:33.299> i'll<00:01:33.810> just<00:01:33.869> start

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
into binary anyway so i'll just start

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.620 
into binary anyway so i'll just start
turning<00:01:34.470> these<00:01:34.590> on<00:01:34.820> so<00:01:35.820> we<00:01:35.909> turn<00:01:36.060> one<00:01:36.270> on<00:01:36.299> and

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
turning these on so we turn one on and

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.080 
turning these on so we turn one on and
then<00:01:37.380> after<00:01:37.799> a<00:01:37.829> short<00:01:38.100> delay<00:01:38.130> we<00:01:38.490> get<00:01:38.610> one<00:01:38.939> on

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
then after a short delay we get one on

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:45.319 
then after a short delay we get one on
over<00:01:39.390> there<00:01:40.250> turn<00:01:41.250> on<00:01:41.369> this<00:01:41.490> signal<00:01:41.850> now<00:01:44.329> every

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
over there turn on this signal now every

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:51.889 
over there turn on this signal now every
now<00:01:45.479> and<00:01:45.689> then<00:01:45.810> it<00:01:46.460> gets<00:01:47.460> oh<00:01:47.990> dear<00:01:48.990> oh<00:01:49.200> dear<00:01:50.899> it

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
now and then it gets oh dear oh dear it

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.840 
now and then it gets oh dear oh dear it
gets<00:01:52.110> a<00:01:52.200> little<00:01:52.350> glitched<00:01:52.740> I'm<00:01:53.460> still<00:01:53.700> not

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
gets a little glitched I'm still not

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.030 
gets a little glitched I'm still not
entirely<00:01:54.149> sure<00:01:54.360> with<00:01:54.720> the<00:01:54.899> source<00:01:55.259> source<00:01:55.799> of

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
entirely sure with the source source of

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:02.840 
entirely sure with the source source of
the<00:01:56.780> of<00:01:57.780> the<00:01:58.320> witches<00:02:01.399> it's<00:02:02.399> squished<00:02:02.729> right

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
the of the witches it's squished right

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.050 
the of the witches it's squished right
now<00:02:02.969> because<00:02:03.329> only<00:02:03.890> that<00:02:04.890> only<00:02:05.460> that<00:02:05.700> piston

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
now because only that only that piston

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.779 
now because only that only that piston
supposed<00:02:06.420> to<00:02:06.540> be<00:02:06.630> on<00:02:07.399> sometimes<00:02:08.399> it<00:02:08.550> thinks

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
supposed to be on sometimes it thinks

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.339 
supposed to be on sometimes it thinks
the<00:02:08.849> switch<00:02:09.090> is<00:02:09.239> on<00:02:09.479> when<00:02:09.840> it's<00:02:09.959> supposed<00:02:10.110> to

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
the switch is on when it's supposed to

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.640 
the switch is on when it's supposed to
be<00:02:10.500> off<00:02:10.679> there<00:02:11.550> we<00:02:11.760> go<00:02:11.879> now

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
be off there we go now

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.759 
be off there we go now
in<00:02:12.860> the<00:02:13.310> correct<00:02:13.579> configuration<00:02:14.650> just<00:02:15.650> have

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:15.769 
in the correct configuration just have

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:19.839 
in the correct configuration just have
to<00:02:15.860> toggle<00:02:16.010> that<00:02:16.280> switch<00:02:17.319> so<00:02:18.319> one<00:02:18.920> plus<00:02:19.189> one<00:02:19.400> is

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:19.849 
to toggle that switch so one plus one is

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:22.600 
to toggle that switch so one plus one is
two<00:02:20.150> so<00:02:21.079> this<00:02:21.319> is<00:02:21.349> really<00:02:21.799> the<00:02:22.069> smallest

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
two so this is really the smallest

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.619 
two so this is really the smallest
working<00:02:23.060> computer<00:02:23.900> possible<00:02:24.439> you<00:02:24.560> could<00:02:24.709> make

00:02:25.619 --> 00:02:25.629 
working computer possible you could make

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:29.020 
working computer possible you could make
might<00:02:26.629> as<00:02:26.689> well<00:02:26.810> just<00:02:26.959> add<00:02:27.079> three<00:02:27.379> now<00:02:27.530> and<00:02:28.030> it

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
might as well just add three now and it

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.229 
might as well just add three now and it
didn't<00:02:29.299> do<00:02:29.540> anything<00:02:30.370> all<00:02:31.370> right<00:02:31.549> so<00:02:31.730> besides

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
didn't do anything all right so besides

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:33.910 
didn't do anything all right so besides
the<00:02:32.420> obvious<00:02:32.569> problems<00:02:33.349> that<00:02:33.500> you<00:02:33.590> guys<00:02:33.739> are

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
the obvious problems that you guys are

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.819 
the obvious problems that you guys are
seeing<00:02:34.099> right<00:02:34.220> now<00:02:34.370> with<00:02:34.760> this<00:02:35.180> design<00:02:35.829> um

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:36.829 
seeing right now with this design um

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:38.500 
seeing right now with this design um
there's<00:02:37.549> another<00:02:37.609> problem<00:02:37.970> which<00:02:38.299> is<00:02:38.329> that

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
there's another problem which is that

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.890 
there's another problem which is that
the<00:02:39.409> signal<00:02:39.799> can't<00:02:40.010> travel<00:02:40.310> upwards<00:02:40.939> which<00:02:41.689> is

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:41.900 
the signal can't travel upwards which is

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.649 
the signal can't travel upwards which is
why<00:02:42.590> I<00:02:42.620> have<00:02:43.040> this<00:02:43.730> switch<00:02:44.060> up<00:02:44.269> in<00:02:44.420> the<00:02:44.540> air

00:02:44.649 --> 00:02:44.659 
why I have this switch up in the air

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:46.509 
why I have this switch up in the air
over<00:02:44.690> here<00:02:45.049> oh<00:02:45.200> there<00:02:45.560> we<00:02:45.650> go<00:02:45.680> now<00:02:46.040> it's<00:02:46.190> fixed

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:46.519 
over here oh there we go now it's fixed

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:49.629 
over here oh there we go now it's fixed
it<00:02:46.670> so<00:02:47.510> yeah<00:02:47.659> just<00:02:47.900> a<00:02:47.989> little<00:02:48.170> knobby<00:02:48.769> thing<00:02:49.040> I

00:02:49.629 --> 00:02:49.639 
it so yeah just a little knobby thing I

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:52.149 
it so yeah just a little knobby thing I
thought<00:02:49.790> share<00:02:50.030> with<00:02:50.150> you<00:02:50.239> guys<00:02:50.269> um<00:02:50.780> so<00:02:51.379> yeah<00:02:52.129> I

00:02:52.149 --> 00:02:52.159 
thought share with you guys um so yeah I

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:55.780 
thought share with you guys um so yeah I
guess<00:02:52.280> that's<00:02:52.519> about<00:02:52.609> it<00:02:52.760> I<00:02:54.579> wasn't<00:02:55.579> only

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
guess that's about it I wasn't only

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.339 
guess that's about it I wasn't only
planning<00:02:56.150> on<00:02:56.239> looking<00:02:56.389> into<00:02:56.780> this<00:02:56.900> anymore

00:02:57.339 --> 00:02:57.349 
planning on looking into this anymore

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:59.679 
planning on looking into this anymore
but<00:02:57.590> I<00:02:57.799> suppose<00:02:58.189> if<00:02:58.400> when<00:02:58.549> you<00:02:58.639> you<00:02:59.090> guys<00:02:59.269> could

00:02:59.679 --> 00:02:59.689 
but I suppose if when you you guys could

00:02:59.689 --> 00:03:01.960 
but I suppose if when you you guys could
figure<00:02:59.989> out<00:03:00.079> the<00:03:00.950> problems<00:03:01.370> that<00:03:01.579> I'm<00:03:01.790> having

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:01.970 
figure out the problems that I'm having

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:03.910 
figure out the problems that I'm having
with<00:03:02.120> this<00:03:02.359> but<00:03:02.689> with<00:03:02.840> the<00:03:03.049> upward<00:03:03.500> redstone

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:03.920 
with this but with the upward redstone

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:07.210 
with this but with the upward redstone
and<00:03:03.950> the<00:03:05.139> bit<00:03:06.139> breaking<00:03:06.650> when<00:03:06.769> I<00:03:06.799> flip<00:03:07.099> a

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
and the bit breaking when I flip a

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.610 
and the bit breaking when I flip a
switch<00:03:07.459> I<00:03:07.909> don't<00:03:08.239> know<00:03:08.359> I<00:03:08.569> guess<00:03:09.139> I<00:03:09.349> could<00:03:09.500> make

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
switch I don't know I guess I could make

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.770 
switch I don't know I guess I could make
a<00:03:09.650> full<00:03:09.889> computer<00:03:10.159> out<00:03:10.459> of<00:03:10.609> it<00:03:10.730> but<00:03:11.090> well

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
a full computer out of it but well

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.420 
a full computer out of it but well
that's<00:03:12.200> about<00:03:12.290> it<00:03:12.379> for<00:03:12.530> today<00:03:12.680> so<00:03:12.920> your

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
that's about it for today so your

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.250 
that's about it for today so your
slideshow<00:03:13.849> this<00:03:14.000> with<00:03:14.120> you<00:03:14.239> guys<00:03:14.269> and<00:03:14.659> I'll
