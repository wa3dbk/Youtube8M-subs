00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:07.380
 zuma 

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:07.380
 of the odd 

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:11.610
 and minors 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:16.920
 of 100 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:19.230
 the odd ones are 13 57 is a progression 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:23.430
 arithmetic because it adds up a 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:27.800
 number the first term is 1 and the 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:31.770
 difference is 2 is worth those out there 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:35.300
 what would be the last 

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:37.510
 less than 100 to 49 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.850
 what would 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.190
 the last one is 99 but to that I 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:49.710
 corresponds to see this would be the term 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:49.710
 general to 1 + n 1 per d would be 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.030
 plus 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.030
 r - 1 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.640
 for two 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:13.430
 n is 12 Jan 1 note that the last one would be 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:17.450
 to 51 because at 50 it would be 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:20.480
 2 x 50 100 minus 199 then I have to 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:24.410
 make the sum of the top 50 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:26.650
 terms of this progression do you have the 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:28.450
 formula out there 1 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.360
 of the sum of the terms of a 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.990
 arithmetic progression 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.990
 How is it 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.799
 is 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:46.070
 for n party 2 is not like that 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:48.560
 I forget sometimes then the 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:54.350
 sum of those 50 first terms would be 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:58.090
 to 1 which is one more than we have seen 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.090
 which is 50 which is 99 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:07.290
 for n that 50 matches that is to say would be 100 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.020
 by 25 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.740
 2500 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.740
 take it now
