00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.050
 that a genuine hid 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.630
 wickie's just a huge fun one 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:38.920
 great adventure for the whole family 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.620

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.510
 and you have to support that and me 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.130
 believe that everyone is surprised and 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.559
 will be thrilled as great as 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:49.960
 elaborately wrap it around in the right way 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:52.480
 to be able to immerse yourself there are 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.760
 the film is a lot of fun and games 

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.470
 tension in the samples can the 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.280
 Visitors against the strong men 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:59.320
 compete 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.690
 who would rather have less action? 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:03.400
 he wants to be able to make-up 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:06.120
 leave or just a colorful one 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:08.680
 to take home a reminder 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:12.130
 but the highlight is of course the 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.479
 visit of the actors in the center 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.970
 are clearly the young 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:18.070
 main actor jonas hÃ¤mmerle the im 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:21.520
 film the brave little viking boy 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:23.050
 Wickie plays and Valeria Eisenbart divx 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.240
 represents on the 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:27.300
 adventurous journey to the treasure of 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.300
 gods 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.340
 so brave and cool to play in the movie 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:44.110
 apparently she leaves that cold on the 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.990
 the hustle and bustle of the ever in the debate about her 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.890
 the handling with the fans is done 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.039
 no problem 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.299
 I think you get used to it very much 

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:55.710
 At the beginning it was a bit strange 

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:59.229
 because my knew the not all that 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:02.140
 but me so i find it full in 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:04.000
 order and also the turning has so much 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.299
 made fun that the career aspirations 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.830
 slowly become concrete 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:12.239
 Of course, first of all , the 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.239
 finish school and then study 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.370
 and then I want actress 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.310

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:22.170
 traveled with jonas and valeria 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.170
 also the actors of halver 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.810
 a little bit more 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:57.210
 also a unterfranke was part of the 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.100
 the riding team matthias triebel der 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:01.410
 born Schweinfurt is co-producer 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.110
 and proud of the film in Lower Franconia 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.280
 to be able to present 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.720
 So my cinema home is here 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.450
 dettelbach is still for me 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.100
 measure of all things the cinema is about 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.880
 pay the dettelbacher for every film 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.010
 We actually do it in Germany 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.360
 always first or second and with the 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.580
 Of course, family michel are the best 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.660

 Two years have the filming too 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:26.730
 wickie took a long journey 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:29.010
 like the ornate 3d studio 

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:31.890
 Productions was also on walchensee 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.459

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.980

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.930
