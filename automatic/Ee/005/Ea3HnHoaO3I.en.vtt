you<00:01:58.979> know<00:01:59.159> I<00:01:59.189> love<00:01:59.579> my<00:01:59.759> foundation<00:02:00.329> that<00:02:00.899> has

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
you know I love my foundation that has

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.170 
you know I love my foundation that has
like<00:02:01.409> a<00:02:01.439> luminous<00:02:01.950> finish<00:02:02.219> to<00:02:02.520> it<00:02:02.549> but<00:02:03.149> for

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
like a luminous finish to it but for

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.810 
like a luminous finish to it but for
some<00:02:03.600> people<00:02:03.750> it<00:02:04.079> might<00:02:04.350> be<00:02:04.409> a<00:02:04.950> little<00:02:05.490> too

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
some people it might be a little too

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.300 
some people it might be a little too
dewy<00:02:06.299> so<00:02:06.990> you<00:02:07.079> can<00:02:07.290> always<00:02:07.560> say<00:02:08.009> it<00:02:08.069> with<00:02:08.280> a

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
dewy so you can always say it with a

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.339 
dewy so you can always say it with a
powder<00:02:08.700> to<00:02:08.879> take<00:02:09.270> away<00:02:09.509> some<00:02:09.690> of<00:02:09.720> that<00:02:09.840> doing

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
powder to take away some of that doing

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.550 
powder to take away some of that doing
this<00:02:10.470> I<00:02:10.679> tend<00:02:11.550> to<00:02:11.700> either<00:02:12.420> set<00:02:12.870> it<00:02:12.989> with<00:02:13.140> a<00:02:13.170> lid

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
this I tend to either set it with a lid

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.949 
this I tend to either set it with a lid
a bit<00:02:13.739> of<00:02:13.830> translucent<00:02:14.459> powder<00:02:14.790> or<00:02:15.090> I<00:02:15.180> just<00:02:15.810> go

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
a bit of translucent powder or I just go

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.080 
a bit of translucent powder or I just go
in<00:02:16.110> with<00:02:16.319> my<00:02:16.470> Mac<00:02:16.739> block<00:02:17.220> powder<00:02:17.550> the<00:02:17.790> pressed

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
in with my Mac block powder the pressed

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:20.089 
in with my Mac block powder the pressed
one<00:02:18.360> and<00:02:18.660> it<00:02:19.020> will<00:02:19.170> take<00:02:19.380> away<00:02:19.590> some<00:02:19.860> of<00:02:19.890> that

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
one and it will take away some of that

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:23.630 
one and it will take away some of that
shine<00:02:20.610> and<00:02:21.120> allow<00:02:22.110> me<00:02:22.380> to<00:02:22.410> still<00:02:22.920> have<00:02:23.099> a<00:02:23.310> glow

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
shine and allow me to still have a glow

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.699 
shine and allow me to still have a glow
but<00:02:23.910> not<00:02:24.120> excessively<00:02:25.020> you<00:02:25.260> know<00:02:25.380> what<00:02:25.470> I<00:02:25.530> mean

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
but not excessively you know what I mean

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.040 
but not excessively you know what I mean
I<00:02:25.860> do<00:02:26.099> have<00:02:26.280> a<00:02:26.849> few<00:02:27.120> negative<00:02:27.540> things<00:02:27.810> to<00:02:27.900> say

I do have a few negative things to say

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.370 
I do have a few negative things to say
about<00:02:28.440> this<00:02:28.830> foundation<00:02:29.010> and<00:02:29.760> that<00:02:30.000> is<00:02:30.380> it

about this foundation and that is it

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:34.190 
about this foundation and that is it

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
doesn't last long at all like if you're

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.839 
doesn't last long at all like if you're

you're going to have a super long day

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.559 
you're going to have a super long day
this<00:02:40.230> is<00:02:40.500> not<00:02:40.739> the<00:02:41.010> guy<00:02:41.250> for<00:02:41.310> you<00:02:41.849> I<00:02:41.880> have<00:02:42.239> tried

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
this is not the guy for you I have tried

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:44.270 
this is not the guy for you I have tried
it<00:02:42.690> with<00:02:42.840> different<00:02:43.140> primers<00:02:43.440> I've<00:02:43.830> tried<00:02:44.160> it

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
it with different primers I've tried it

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.580 
it with different primers I've tried it
with<00:02:44.430> setting<00:02:44.790> sprays<00:02:45.120> and<00:02:45.390> I<00:02:45.840> just<00:02:46.080> feel<00:02:46.350> like

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
with setting sprays and I just feel like

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:52.940 
with setting sprays and I just feel like
after<00:02:47.220> about<00:02:48.590> mmm<00:02:49.880> four<00:02:50.880> hours<00:02:51.630> it<00:02:52.049> does<00:02:52.440> start

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
after about mmm four hours it does start

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.250 
after about mmm four hours it does start
to<00:02:53.160> kind<00:02:53.400> of<00:02:53.459> get<00:02:53.610> patchy<00:02:54.000> it<00:02:54.600> starts<00:02:54.930> to<00:02:55.110> kind

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
to kind of get patchy it starts to kind

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.220 
to kind of get patchy it starts to kind
of<00:02:55.410> break<00:02:55.680> apart<00:02:56.220> especially<00:02:56.670> the<00:02:57.330> blush<00:02:57.690> area

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
of break apart especially the blush area

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.030 
of break apart especially the blush area
it<00:02:59.010> does<00:02:59.730> start<00:03:00.090> to<00:03:00.299> kind<00:03:00.569> of<00:03:00.660> fade<00:03:01.019> away<00:03:01.680> and<00:03:01.980> I

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
it does start to kind of fade away and I

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.559 
it does start to kind of fade away and I
think<00:03:02.280> it's<00:03:02.370> just<00:03:02.430> because<00:03:02.640> of<00:03:02.730> the<00:03:02.880> formula

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
think it's just because of the formula

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:07.580 
think it's just because of the formula
it<00:03:04.019> has<00:03:04.230> kind<00:03:04.650> of<00:03:04.799> like<00:03:05.069> this<00:03:05.510> very<00:03:06.590> somewhat

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
it has kind of like this very somewhat

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.750 
it has kind of like this very somewhat
greasy<00:03:08.330> formula<00:03:09.330> I<00:03:09.540> could<00:03:09.870> say<00:03:10.400> another<00:03:11.400> thing

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
greasy formula I could say another thing

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.910 
greasy formula I could say another thing
is<00:03:11.910> that<00:03:12.090> you<00:03:12.239> really<00:03:12.660> need<00:03:13.200> to<00:03:13.230> shake<00:03:13.590> up<00:03:13.739> this

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
is that you really need to shake up this

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.920 
is that you really need to shake up this
product<00:03:14.430> very<00:03:14.849> well<00:03:15.150> I<00:03:15.390> don't<00:03:15.599> know<00:03:15.690> if<00:03:15.810> it's

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
product very well I don't know if it's

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.560 
product very well I don't know if it's
just<00:03:16.110> the<00:03:16.230> batch<00:03:16.470> that<00:03:16.500> I've<00:03:16.950> got<00:03:17.250> but<00:03:18.120> when

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
just the batch that I've got but when

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:21.349 
just the batch that I've got but when
you<00:03:18.750> first<00:03:19.140> even<00:03:19.530> even<00:03:20.280> when<00:03:20.430> I<00:03:20.459> do<00:03:20.609> shake<00:03:21.180> it

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:21.359 
you first even even when I do shake it

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:23.810 
you first even even when I do shake it
up<00:03:21.480> and<00:03:21.690> I<00:03:21.750> squeeze<00:03:22.290> it<00:03:22.500> I<00:03:22.650> can<00:03:23.160> see<00:03:23.400> that<00:03:23.549> some

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
up and I squeeze it I can see that some

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:27.470 
up and I squeeze it I can see that some
of<00:03:23.940> the<00:03:24.000> ingredients<00:03:24.150> are<00:03:24.780> kind<00:03:25.200> of<00:03:26.480> separated

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
of the ingredients are kind of separated

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.410 
of the ingredients are kind of separated
so<00:03:27.930> I<00:03:27.959> have<00:03:28.230> to<00:03:28.380> really<00:03:28.709> mesh<00:03:29.400> it<00:03:29.640> well<00:03:29.880> at<00:03:30.180> the

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
so I have to really mesh it well at the

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.690 
so I have to really mesh it well at the
back<00:03:30.600> of<00:03:30.630> my<00:03:30.930> hand<00:03:31.230> and<00:03:31.410> then<00:03:31.829> dab<00:03:32.130> it<00:03:32.280> onto<00:03:32.430> my

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
back of my hand and then dab it onto my

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.569 
back of my hand and then dab it onto my
skin<00:03:33.090> because<00:03:33.959> the<00:03:34.290> product<00:03:34.709> dense<00:03:34.920> tends<00:03:35.400> to

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:35.579 
skin because the product dense tends to

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:39.259 
skin because the product dense tends to
separate<00:03:36.329> itself<00:03:36.870> a<00:03:37.049> lot<00:03:37.230> so<00:03:38.160> overall<00:03:38.880> this

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
separate itself a lot so overall this

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:42.559 
separate itself a lot so overall this
foundation<00:03:40.109> is<00:03:40.440> OK<00:03:41.250> to<00:03:41.310> me<00:03:41.910> would<00:03:42.540> I

00:03:42.559 --> 00:03:42.569 
foundation is OK to me would I

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:44.660 
foundation is OK to me would I
repurchase<00:03:42.870> this<00:03:43.470> foundation<00:03:44.220> to<00:03:44.400> be

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
repurchase this foundation to be

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.390 
repurchase this foundation to be
completely<00:03:45.180> honest<00:03:45.870> no<00:03:46.709> I<00:03:46.739> don't<00:03:47.130> think<00:03:47.190> I

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
completely honest no I don't think I

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.340 
completely honest no I don't think I
would<00:03:47.609> repurchase<00:03:47.910> it<00:03:48.510> simply<00:03:48.900> because<00:03:49.230> I

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
would repurchase it simply because I

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.849 
would repurchase it simply because I
like<00:03:49.769> my<00:03:50.010> foundation<00:03:50.639> to<00:03:50.760> stick<00:03:51.450> and<00:03:51.720> stay<00:03:52.590> the

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:52.859 
like my foundation to stick and stay the

like my foundation to stick and stay the
whole<00:03:53.040> day<00:03:53.100> I<00:03:53.340> love<00:03:53.850> a<00:03:53.880> foundation<00:03:54.450> that<00:03:54.480> I<00:03:54.630> can

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 
whole day I love a foundation that I can

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:58.099 
whole day I love a foundation that I can
rely<00:03:55.200> on<00:03:55.230> throughout<00:03:56.220> the<00:03:56.489> day<00:03:56.519> and<00:03:57.239> this<00:03:57.810> just

00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:58.109 
rely on throughout the day and this just

00:03:58.109 --> 00:03:59.690 
rely on throughout the day and this just
doesn't<00:03:58.170> do<00:03:58.739> it<00:03:58.859> for<00:03:58.889> me<00:03:59.130> this<00:03:59.489> is<00:03:59.670> just

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
doesn't do it for me this is just

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.509 
doesn't do it for me this is just
something<00:04:00.389> that<00:04:00.680> you<00:04:01.680> can<00:04:01.920> pair<00:04:02.190> up<00:04:02.220> with

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
something that you can pair up with

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:04.160 
something that you can pair up with
other<00:04:02.790> foundations<00:04:03.630> you<00:04:03.810> know<00:04:03.930> what<00:04:04.019> I<00:04:04.049> mean

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
other foundations you know what I mean

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:07.129 
other foundations you know what I mean
like<00:04:04.350> this<00:04:04.859> foundation<00:04:05.760> I<00:04:06.090> have<00:04:06.150> mixed<00:04:06.989> it

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:07.139 
like this foundation I have mixed it

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:09.229 
like this foundation I have mixed it
with<00:04:07.290> my<00:04:07.500> L'Oreal<00:04:07.920> True<00:04:08.220> Match<00:04:08.250> and<00:04:08.790> to<00:04:09.150> be

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
with my L'Oreal True Match and to be

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.210 
with my L'Oreal True Match and to be
honest<00:04:09.600> it<00:04:09.720> worked<00:04:10.109> really<00:04:10.470> nicely<00:04:10.620> because

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
honest it worked really nicely because

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.039 
honest it worked really nicely because
delaurio<00:04:11.790> True<00:04:12.090> Match<00:04:12.120> kind<00:04:12.510> of<00:04:12.569> has<00:04:12.660> a<00:04:12.690> satin

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049 
delaurio True Match kind of has a satin

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:15.289 
delaurio True Match kind of has a satin
finish<00:04:13.260> and<00:04:13.620> sometimes<00:04:14.370> will<00:04:14.670> cling<00:04:14.940> on<00:04:15.120> to

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:15.299 
finish and sometimes will cling on to

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:18.020 
finish and sometimes will cling on to
texture<00:04:16.019> and<00:04:16.200> dry<00:04:16.410> patches<00:04:16.709> but<00:04:17.459> when<00:04:17.639> I<00:04:17.669> pair

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
texture and dry patches but when I pair

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:19.930 
texture and dry patches but when I pair
it<00:04:18.120> up<00:04:18.180> with<00:04:18.239> this<00:04:18.570> it<00:04:18.810> adds<00:04:19.139> a<00:04:19.350> little<00:04:19.590> bit<00:04:19.709> of

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:19.940 
it up with this it adds a little bit of

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.399 
it up with this it adds a little bit of
luminosity<00:04:20.940> to<00:04:20.970> it<00:04:21.389> a<00:04:21.419> little<00:04:21.690> bit<00:04:21.840> of<00:04:21.930> a<00:04:22.049> glow

00:04:22.399 --> 00:04:22.409 
luminosity to it a little bit of a glow

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:25.820 
luminosity to it a little bit of a glow
to<00:04:23.280> it<00:04:23.310> so<00:04:24.000> then<00:04:24.330> it<00:04:24.630> won't<00:04:24.870> cling<00:04:25.229> on<00:04:25.380> to<00:04:25.590> dry

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
to it so then it won't cling on to dry

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.690 
to it so then it won't cling on to dry
patches<00:04:26.130> or<00:04:26.460> textures<00:04:26.880> of<00:04:26.909> my<00:04:27.180> skin

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700 
patches or textures of my skin

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:31.190 
patches or textures of my skin
but<00:04:28.030> on<00:04:28.270> its<00:04:28.450> own<00:04:28.690> I<00:04:29.290> don't<00:04:29.710> think<00:04:30.100> it's<00:04:30.310> that

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:31.200 
but on its own I don't think it's that

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.320 
but on its own I don't think it's that
great<00:04:32.200> and<00:04:32.890> I've<00:04:33.250> seen<00:04:33.490> tons<00:04:33.850> and<00:04:34.030> tons<00:04:34.060> of

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330 
great and I've seen tons and tons of

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.000 
great and I've seen tons and tons of

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:40.390 
foundation terms of coverage this will

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:44.160 
foundation terms of coverage this will
give<00:04:40.660> you<00:04:40.870> a<00:04:40.900> light<00:04:41.410> to<00:04:41.740> medium<00:04:42.010> coverage<00:04:42.540> I<00:04:43.540> I

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:44.170 
give you a light to medium coverage I I

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:46.110 
give you a light to medium coverage I I
do<00:04:44.650> feel<00:04:45.040> like<00:04:45.070> you<00:04:45.310> can<00:04:45.490> build<00:04:45.730> it<00:04:45.910> to<00:04:46.060> a

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 
do feel like you can build it to a

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.690 
do feel like you can build it to a
slight<00:04:46.570> full<00:04:46.840> coverage<00:04:47.200> but<00:04:47.740> then<00:04:48.070> again<00:04:48.220> it

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:48.700 
slight full coverage but then again it

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:52.890 
slight full coverage but then again it
starts<00:04:49.180> to<00:04:49.390> look<00:04:49.690> a<00:04:49.840> little<00:04:50.260> bit<00:04:51.100> too<00:04:51.570> cakey<00:04:52.570> on

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.900 
starts to look a little bit too cakey on

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:55.770 
starts to look a little bit too cakey on
the<00:04:53.230> skin<00:04:53.680> so<00:04:54.220> I<00:04:54.250> wouldn't<00:04:54.820> layer<00:04:55.060> this<00:04:55.420> more

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
the skin so I wouldn't layer this more

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:58.500 
the skin so I wouldn't layer this more
than<00:04:55.990> you<00:04:56.680> know<00:04:56.800> two<00:04:56.860> layers<00:04:57.460> after<00:04:58.090> that<00:04:58.300> it

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:58.510 
than you know two layers after that it

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:00.660 
than you know two layers after that it
just<00:04:58.540> doesn't<00:04:58.960> look<00:04:59.110> too<00:04:59.440> too<00:04:59.650> great<00:05:00.040> so

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:00.670 
just doesn't look too too great so

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:03.480 
just doesn't look too too great so
overall<00:05:01.240> I'm<00:05:01.720> really<00:05:01.780> sorry<00:05:02.560> to<00:05:02.830> say<00:05:03.070> that<00:05:03.100> I

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:07.810 
foundation I love the way it sits on the

00:05:07.810 --> 00:05:10.410 
foundation I love the way it sits on the
skin<00:05:08.170> and<00:05:08.320> it<00:05:08.440> looks<00:05:08.800> really<00:05:09.070> nice<00:05:09.370> but<00:05:10.180> it's
