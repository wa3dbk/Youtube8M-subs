00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
it's not necessarily the best thing and

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:14.870

scratching at the carpet either one

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.359 
scratching at the carpet either one
solution<00:00:21.480> is<00:00:21.660> to<00:00:22.400> get<00:00:23.400> a<00:00:24.269> little<00:00:25.230> rug<00:00:25.650> or<00:00:25.980> a<00:00:26.010> mat

something<00:00:27.150> like<00:00:27.330> that<00:00:27.630> sorry<00:00:28.109> it's<00:00:28.320> a<00:00:28.410> bit

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
something like that sorry it's a bit

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.089 
something like that sorry it's a bit
dark<00:00:28.800> so<00:00:29.070> you<00:00:29.160> can't<00:00:29.369> really<00:00:29.550> see<00:00:30.060> but<00:00:31.009> let<00:00:32.009> me

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
dark so you can't really see but let me

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.560 
dark so you can't really see but let me
just<00:00:32.250> put<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.550> light<00:00:32.700> on<00:00:32.820> so<00:00:33.000> just<00:00:33.239> like<00:00:33.540> a

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
just put the light on so just like a

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.870 
just put the light on so just like a
little<00:00:33.930> mat<00:00:34.230> or<00:00:34.590> something<00:00:34.620> just<00:00:35.309> so<00:00:35.520> that<00:00:35.730> if

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
little mat or something just so that if

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.030 
little mat or something just so that if
they<00:00:36.059> do<00:00:36.120> happen<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:36.930> scratch<00:00:37.290> under<00:00:37.530> the<00:00:37.800> door

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040

or<00:00:38.399> anything<00:00:38.730> anywhere<00:00:39.570> just<00:00:39.960> so<00:00:40.079> that<00:00:40.260> you

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
or anything anywhere just so that you

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.299 
or anything anywhere just so that you
protect<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.800> carpet<00:00:41.280> so<00:00:42.059> that<00:00:42.090> is<00:00:42.360> an<00:00:42.510> option

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:43.309 
protect the carpet so that is an option

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:46.150 
protect the carpet so that is an option
one<00:00:44.309> of<00:00:44.399> the<00:00:44.489> reasons<00:00:44.850> why<00:00:45.030> ferrets<00:00:45.539> might

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.160 
one of the reasons why ferrets might

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:52.400 
one of the reasons why ferrets might
scratch<00:00:47.160> at<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.520> carpet<00:00:48.300> is<00:00:50.059> because<00:00:51.410> one

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
scratch at the carpet is because one

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.889 
scratch at the carpet is because one
they're<00:00:52.829> probably<00:00:53.039> bought<00:00:53.480> for<00:00:54.480> example

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
they're probably bought for example

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.990 
they're probably bought for example
these<00:00:55.050> guys<00:00:55.379> they<00:00:56.160> probably<00:00:56.460> could<00:00:56.760> have<00:00:56.940> a

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
these guys they probably could have a

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.049 
these guys they probably could have a
little<00:00:57.360> bit<00:00:57.539> more<00:00:58.190> toys<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.219> play<00:00:59.489> with<00:00:59.699> as<00:00:59.969> you

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
little bit more toys to play with as you

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.000 
little bit more toys to play with as you
can<00:01:00.210> see<00:01:00.480> the<00:01:00.629> room<00:01:00.809> is<00:01:00.960> pretty<00:01:01.140> clean<00:01:01.680> and

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
can see the room is pretty clean and

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.889 
can see the room is pretty clean and
after<00:01:02.760> a<00:01:02.820> while<00:01:03.000> it<00:01:03.239> just<00:01:03.270> gets<00:01:03.600> a<00:01:03.690> bit<00:01:03.719> boring

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
after a while it just gets a bit boring

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.740 
after a while it just gets a bit boring
for<00:01:04.500> ferrets<00:01:04.890> so<00:01:05.280> they<00:01:05.909> need<00:01:06.060> to<00:01:06.150> have<00:01:06.360> lots<00:01:06.600> of

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
for ferrets so they need to have lots of

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.810 
for ferrets so they need to have lots of
mental<00:01:07.320> stimulation<00:01:07.830> so<00:01:08.159> if<00:01:08.280> you<00:01:08.400> can<00:01:08.610> get

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
mental stimulation so if you can get

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.050 
mental stimulation so if you can get
some<00:01:09.060> toys<00:01:09.689> or<00:01:10.290> get<00:01:10.830> down<00:01:11.040> on<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.490> floor<00:01:11.700> and

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
some toys or get down on the floor and

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.609 
some toys or get down on the floor and
start<00:01:12.299> playing<00:01:12.600> with<00:01:12.750> them<00:01:13.049> then<00:01:13.229> you'll<00:01:13.350> find

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
start playing with them then you'll find

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.649 
start playing with them then you'll find
that<00:01:13.710> they'll<00:01:13.950> soon<00:01:14.430> not<00:01:15.240> even<00:01:15.479> pay<00:01:15.630> attention

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
that they'll soon not even pay attention

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.100 
that they'll soon not even pay attention
to<00:01:16.200> scratching<00:01:16.860> at<00:01:16.979> the<00:01:17.009> door<00:01:17.130> because

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
to scratching at the door because

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.270 
to scratching at the door because
basically<00:01:19.110> they<00:01:19.500> just<00:01:19.710> want<00:01:19.860> to<00:01:19.950> get<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.189> the

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
basically they just want to get to the

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.679 
basically they just want to get to the
other<00:01:20.400> side<00:01:20.610> because<00:01:21.000> there's<00:01:21.180> nothing<00:01:21.360> else

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
other side because there's nothing else

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.039 
other side because there's nothing else
for<00:01:21.810> them<00:01:22.049> to<00:01:22.080> do<00:01:22.350> in<00:01:22.470> this<00:01:22.590> room<00:01:22.970> so<00:01:24.049> that

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
for them to do in this room so that

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.249 
for them to do in this room so that
could<00:01:25.259> be<00:01:25.409> one<00:01:25.710> reason<00:01:26.030> so<00:01:27.140> basically<00:01:28.140> just

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
could be one reason so basically just

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.840 
could be one reason so basically just
make<00:01:28.680> sure<00:01:28.860> that<00:01:29.009> you<00:01:29.100> keep<00:01:29.280> them<00:01:29.460> stimulated

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
make sure that you keep them stimulated

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.359 
make sure that you keep them stimulated
whatever<00:01:30.659> you<00:01:30.810> do<00:01:31.020> see<00:01:31.259> them<00:01:31.439> scratching<00:01:31.770> even

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
whatever you do see them scratching even

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.440 
whatever you do see them scratching even
if<00:01:32.460> you<00:01:32.549> do<00:01:32.700> have<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:32.909> mat<00:01:33.180> just<00:01:33.360> go<00:01:33.659> no<00:01:34.070> no<00:01:35.070> Sammy

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
if you do have a mat just go no no Sammy

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.870 
if you do have a mat just go no no Sammy
no<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:37.130> normally<00:01:38.130> they<00:01:38.280> should<00:01:38.460> be<00:01:38.579> smart

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
no and normally they should be smart

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:45.260 
no and normally they should be smart
enough<00:01:39.030> to<00:01:39.240> not<00:01:40.049> do<00:01:40.500> that<00:01:40.680> Sammy<00:01:41.390> Sammy<00:01:42.799> no<00:01:44.270> so

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
enough to not do that Sammy Sammy no so

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.910 
enough to not do that Sammy Sammy no so
if<00:01:45.360> you<00:01:45.479> just<00:01:45.630> keep<00:01:45.840> disciplining<00:01:46.470> them

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
if you just keep disciplining them

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.370 
if you just keep disciplining them
eventually<00:01:47.850> they'll<00:01:48.299> get<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.720> message<00:01:48.869> they

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
eventually they'll get the message they

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.469 
eventually they'll get the message they
weren't<00:01:49.649> I<00:01:49.770> don't<00:01:49.860> normally<00:01:50.759> they<00:01:51.119> weren't

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
weren't I don't normally they weren't

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.289 
weren't I don't normally they weren't
stopped<00:01:51.960> forever<00:01:52.380> but<00:01:52.770> as<00:01:53.369> I<00:01:53.670> said<00:01:53.939> if<00:01:54.119> they're

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
stopped forever but as I said if they're

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.330 
stopped forever but as I said if they're
bored<00:01:54.630> they'll<00:01:54.930> just<00:01:55.200> keep<00:01:55.770> wanting<00:01:55.979> to<00:01:56.189> get

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
bored they'll just keep wanting to get

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.639 
bored they'll just keep wanting to get
out<00:01:56.399> so<00:01:57.200> my<00:01:58.200> greatest<00:01:59.159> suggestion<00:01:59.850> for

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
out so my greatest suggestion for

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:03.410 
out so my greatest suggestion for
ferrets<00:02:01.649> scratching<00:02:02.159> at<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.310> carpet<00:02:02.880> is

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
ferrets scratching at the carpet is

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:10.279 
ferrets scratching at the carpet is
Sammy<00:02:05.299> Sammy<00:02:07.520> is<00:02:08.569> to<00:02:09.569> just<00:02:10.020> keep<00:02:10.170> them

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
Sammy Sammy is to just keep them
