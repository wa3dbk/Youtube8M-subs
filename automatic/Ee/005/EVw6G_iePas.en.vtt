longer it will last on the deck so

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.719 
longer it will last on the deck so
longer<00:01:57.380> between<00:01:57.530> treating<00:01:58.100> okay<00:01:58.280> if<00:01:58.520> you<00:01:58.640> want

longer between treating okay if you want

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:00.730 
longer between treating okay if you want
to<00:01:58.880> use<00:01:59.060> a<00:01:59.090> solid<00:01:59.390> stain<00:01:59.689> it<00:01:59.810> might<00:01:59.930> last<00:02:00.079> 56

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
to use a solid stain it might last 56

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.460 
to use a solid stain it might last 56
years<00:02:00.829> between<00:02:01.520> treatments<00:02:02.060> and<00:02:02.540> adds<00:02:03.229> more

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
years between treatments and adds more

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:04.870 
years between treatments and adds more
color<00:02:03.740> to<00:02:03.829> the<00:02:04.009> you<00:02:04.250> know<00:02:04.340> to<00:02:04.399> the<00:02:04.549> deck<00:02:04.729> as

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
the stain and you're done and that looks

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:10.899 
the stain and you're done and that looks
at<00:02:09.470> in<00:02:09.649> the<00:02:09.950> case<00:02:10.069> of<00:02:10.099> a<00:02:10.220> solid<00:02:10.489> stain<00:02:10.670> maybe

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:10.909 
at in the case of a solid stain maybe

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:11.979 
at in the case of a solid stain maybe
five<00:02:11.090> years<00:02:11.420> in<00:02:11.540> the<00:02:11.599> case<00:02:11.749> of<00:02:11.779> a

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:11.989 
five years in the case of a

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:13.190 
five years in the case of a
semi-transparent<00:02:12.650> stain

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
semi-transparent stain

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.979 
semi-transparent stain
maybe<00:02:13.470> 34<00:02:14.370> years<00:02:14.610> clear<00:02:15.480> might<00:02:15.660> last<00:02:15.810> a<00:02:15.959> year

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:15.989 
maybe 34 years clear might last a year

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:17.540 
maybe 34 years clear might last a year
or<00:02:16.230> two<00:02:16.349> I'll<00:02:16.620> keep<00:02:16.739> that<00:02:16.800> deck<00:02:17.190> looking
