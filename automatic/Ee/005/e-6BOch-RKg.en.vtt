00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.610 
calling it akimbo when you have a model
1887<00:02:08.459> it<00:02:08.789> isn't<00:02:09.090> that<00:02:09.239> bad<00:02:09.450> until<00:02:09.840> it's

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
1887 it isn't that bad until it's

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.910 
1887 it isn't that bad until it's
a chem<00:02:12.190> boat<00:02:12.400> it<00:02:13.000> dude<00:02:13.390> then<00:02:14.230> it<00:02:14.409> just<00:02:14.560> becomes

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:14.920 
a chem boat it dude then it just becomes

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.539 
a chem boat it dude then it just becomes
insanely<00:02:15.909> godly<00:02:16.569> and<00:02:16.720> its<00:02:17.230> really<00:02:17.440> annoying<00:02:17.769> I

00:02:18.539 --> 00:02:18.549 
insanely godly and its really annoying I

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:21.030 
insanely godly and its really annoying I
hope<00:02:19.299> that<00:02:19.629> they<00:02:19.750> do<00:02:19.930> patch<00:02:20.200> it<00:02:20.500> and<00:02:20.620> they<00:02:20.920> even

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
hope that they do patch it and they even

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.649 
hope that they do patch it and they even
lower<00:02:21.400> the<00:02:21.730> damage<00:02:22.659> or<00:02:22.930> the<00:02:23.080> range<00:02:23.349> on<00:02:23.799> it<00:02:23.980> and

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:24.659 
lower the damage or the range on it and

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:27.960 
lower the damage or the range on it and
take<00:02:25.659> off<00:02:25.810> the<00:02:26.110> fact<00:02:26.830> that<00:02:26.920> you<00:02:27.129> can<00:02:27.370> akimbo<00:02:27.700> it

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
take off the fact that you can akimbo it

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:30.059 
take off the fact that you can akimbo it
a<00:02:28.120> lot<00:02:28.299> of<00:02:28.450> guns<00:02:28.659> in<00:02:28.810> this<00:02:28.959> game<00:02:29.170> I<00:02:29.440> think

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
a lot of guns in this game I think

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:31.920 
a lot of guns in this game I think
should<00:02:30.250> not<00:02:30.370> be<00:02:30.579> allowed<00:02:30.730> to<00:02:30.909> be<00:02:31.030> a<00:02:31.060> Kimbo<00:02:31.540> such

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
should not be allowed to be a Kimbo such

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.250 
should not be allowed to be a Kimbo such
as<00:02:32.110> the<00:02:32.260> Ranger<00:02:32.769> in<00:02:32.950> the<00:02:33.159> model<00:02:33.549> o<00:02:34.260> pistols

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
as the Ranger in the model o pistols

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.979 
as the Ranger in the model o pistols
actually<00:02:35.860> fine<00:02:36.129> I<00:02:36.459> don't<00:02:36.940> mind<00:02:37.150> that<00:02:37.480> because

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
actually fine I don't mind that because

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:40.500 
actually fine I don't mind that because
in<00:02:38.200> this<00:02:38.349> game<00:02:38.440> the<00:02:39.310> semi-automatic<00:02:39.909> pistols

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510
