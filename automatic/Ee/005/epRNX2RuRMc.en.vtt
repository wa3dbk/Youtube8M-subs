00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.110 
loosen the meat up inside then you break
off<00:03:40.440> the<00:03:40.680> leg<00:03:40.859> on<00:03:41.010> the<00:03:41.100> other<00:03:41.250> end<00:03:41.579> of<00:03:41.790> the<00:03:41.910> leg

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
off the leg on the other end of the leg

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:45.440 
off the leg on the other end of the leg
and<00:03:42.840> break<00:03:43.650> that<00:03:43.829> off<00:03:44.069> now<00:03:44.700> this<00:03:44.880> is<00:03:45.090> the<00:03:45.239> trick

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
and break that off now this is the trick

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.059 
and break that off now this is the trick
about<00:03:45.900> the<00:03:46.170> Alaskan<00:03:46.680> crab<00:03:46.859> leg<00:03:47.130> the<00:03:48.000> shell<00:03:48.540> is

00:03:49.059 --> 00:03:49.069 
about the Alaskan crab leg the shell is

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:54.440 
about the Alaskan crab leg the shell is
brittle<00:03:50.069> and<00:03:50.840> allows<00:03:51.840> you<00:03:52.139> very<00:03:52.980> carefully<00:03:53.579> to

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
brittle and allows you very carefully to

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.800 
brittle and allows you very carefully to
get<00:03:55.290> the<00:03:55.440> meat<00:03:55.590> up<00:03:55.769> and<00:03:56.489> so<00:03:57.000> then<00:03:57.359> all<00:03:57.540> you<00:03:57.690> do

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
get the meat up and so then all you do

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.099 
get the meat up and so then all you do
by<00:03:58.079> let's<00:03:58.560> pull<00:03:58.799> out<00:03:59.450> the<00:04:00.450> best<00:04:00.660> part<00:04:00.900> of<00:04:00.989> the

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:01.109 
by let's pull out the best part of the

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:02.449 
by let's pull out the best part of the
crab<00:04:01.319> leg<00:04:01.470> the<00:04:01.560> reason<00:04:01.889> you<00:04:01.980> did<00:04:02.160> all<00:04:02.310> this

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
crab leg the reason you did all this

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:04.789 
crab leg the reason you did all this
hard<00:04:02.670> work<00:04:02.730> was<00:04:03.030> getting<00:04:03.299> this<00:04:03.799> beautiful

00:04:04.789 --> 00:04:04.799 
hard work was getting this beautiful
