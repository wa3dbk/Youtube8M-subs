these<00:00:14.190> two<00:00:14.340> grinders<00:00:14.820> is<00:00:14.969> this<00:00:15.210> is<00:00:15.360> a<00:00:15.389> ceramic

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
these two grinders is this is a ceramic

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.680 
these two grinders is this is a ceramic
bird<00:00:16.490> stainless<00:00:17.490> steel<00:00:17.699> burr<00:00:17.910> okay

and what these two the other difference
is<00:00:20.939> is<00:00:21.240> this<00:00:21.449> one<00:00:21.630> is<00:00:21.750> designed<00:00:22.170> to<00:00:22.320> be<00:00:22.439> more

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
is is this one is designed to be more

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.810 
is is this one is designed to be more
for<00:00:23.010> brewing<00:00:23.660> regular<00:00:24.660> drip<00:00:25.410> coffee<00:00:25.650> more<00:00:26.519> up

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
for brewing regular drip coffee more up

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.519 
for brewing regular drip coffee more up
to<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.150> French<00:00:27.359> press<00:00:27.660> possibly<00:00:28.230> we're<00:00:28.410> going

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
to the French press possibly we're going

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:29.839 
to the French press possibly we're going
to<00:00:28.590> test<00:00:28.800> it<00:00:28.920> and<00:00:28.980> see<00:00:29.039> how<00:00:29.250> course<00:00:29.550> it<00:00:29.699> goes

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
to test it and see how course it goes

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.330 
to test it and see how course it goes
but<00:00:30.060> not<00:00:30.269> down<00:00:30.539> to<00:00:30.570> espresso<00:00:31.140> okay<00:00:31.859> this<00:00:32.189> one

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
but not down to espresso okay this one

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.340 
but not down to espresso okay this one
bills<00:00:32.520> much<00:00:32.730> much<00:00:32.940> finer<00:00:33.180> in<00:00:33.690> fact<00:00:34.020> we<00:00:34.140> played

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
bills much much finer in fact we played

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.630 
bills much much finer in fact we played
well<00:00:34.500> it<00:00:34.620> looks<00:00:34.770> like<00:00:34.920> it<00:00:35.040> might<00:00:35.130> go<00:00:35.190> down<00:00:35.520> the

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
well it looks like it might go down the

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.240 
well it looks like it might go down the
Turkish<00:00:35.969> this<00:00:36.480> is<00:00:36.719> like<00:00:37.020> um<00:00:37.350> this<00:00:37.920> is<00:00:38.129> the

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
Turkish this is like um this is the

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.770 
Turkish this is like um this is the
all-purpose<00:00:38.820> they<00:00:39.180> say<00:00:39.360> because<00:00:39.540> it<00:00:39.660> does

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
all-purpose they say because it does

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.660 
all-purpose they say because it does
espresso<00:00:40.170> yeah<00:00:40.500> so<00:00:40.829> well<00:00:41.040> we'll<00:00:41.190> see<00:00:41.340> how<00:00:41.489> high

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
espresso yeah so well we'll see how high

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.069 
espresso yeah so well we'll see how high
it<00:00:41.700> goes<00:00:41.969> though<00:00:42.180> see<00:00:42.600> if<00:00:42.660> it's<00:00:42.780> a<00:00:42.870> French

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
it goes though see if it's a French

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.260 
it goes though see if it's a French
presser<00:00:43.500> okay<00:00:44.070> it<00:00:44.309> might<00:00:44.489> not<00:00:44.640> be<00:00:44.789> because<00:00:45.000> the

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
presser okay it might not be because the

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.940 
presser okay it might not be because the
Vario<00:00:45.600> isn't<00:00:46.320> really<00:00:46.500> a<00:00:46.530> French<00:00:46.770> press

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
Vario isn't really a French press

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.040 
Vario isn't really a French press
grinder<00:00:47.340> it<00:00:47.760> doesn't<00:00:48.030> go<00:00:48.120> person<00:00:48.539> us<00:00:48.660> for<00:00:48.930> that

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
grinder it doesn't go person us for that

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.340 
grinder it doesn't go person us for that
so<00:00:49.710> this<00:00:50.219> one<00:00:50.430> here<00:00:50.789> you<00:00:51.000> get<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.360> ground

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
so this one here you get the ground

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.540 
so this one here you get the ground
catcher<00:00:52.649> and<00:00:53.520> you<00:00:53.610> also<00:00:53.820> get<00:00:54.680> the<00:00:55.680> pour<00:00:56.070> over

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
catcher and you also get the pour over

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.180 
catcher and you also get the pour over
here<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:56.910> pops<00:00:57.539> in<00:00:57.750> there<00:00:57.930> like<00:00:58.289> that<00:00:58.320> okay

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
here and pops in there like that okay

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.189 
here and pops in there like that okay
mmm

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
mmm

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.690 
mmm
so<00:01:01.559> you<00:01:02.370> could<00:01:02.760> theoretically<00:01:03.690> like<00:01:04.559> do<00:01:05.489> your

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
so you could theoretically like do your

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.399 
so you could theoretically like do your
weight

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
weight

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.980 
weight
grind<00:01:08.189> or<00:01:08.460> directly<00:01:09.299> into<00:01:09.510> your<00:01:09.630> portafilter

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
grind or directly into your portafilter

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.010 
grind or directly into your portafilter
with<00:01:10.770> this<00:01:10.950> guy<00:01:11.159> yeah<00:01:11.760> you<00:01:11.820> could<00:01:12.299> do<00:01:12.420> time<00:01:12.689> I

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
with this guy yeah you could do time I

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.929 
with this guy yeah you could do time I
don't<00:01:13.530> know<00:01:13.770> with<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.369> portafilter

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
don't know with the portafilter

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.490 
don't know with the portafilter
it<00:01:15.540> doesn't<00:01:15.750> get<00:01:15.840> away<00:01:15.930> your<00:01:16.200> portafilter

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
it doesn't get away your portafilter

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.740 
it doesn't get away your portafilter
it'll<00:01:17.159> tear<00:01:17.340> it<00:01:17.460> out<00:01:17.580> because<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.119> weighting

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
it'll tear it out because the weighting

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.530 
it'll tear it out because the weighting
DePriest<00:01:19.170> is<00:01:19.439> right<00:01:19.740> here<00:01:20.090> so<00:01:21.090> when<00:01:21.240> you<00:01:21.330> put

DePriest is right here so when you put

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.270 
DePriest is right here so when you put
on<00:01:21.810> this<00:01:22.080> to<00:01:22.290> sit<00:01:22.470> on<00:01:22.590> okay

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
on this to sit on okay

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.910 
on this to sit on okay
comes<00:01:23.820> with<00:01:24.030> a<00:01:24.060> tool<00:01:24.840> both<00:01:25.530> of<00:01:25.680> them<00:01:25.799> come<00:01:25.890> with

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
this tool to calibrate up under here if

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.410 
this tool to calibrate up under here if
it<00:01:28.560> needs<00:01:28.799> it<00:01:29.040> this<00:01:29.400> one<00:01:29.700> didn't<00:01:30.000> seem<00:01:30.150> to<00:01:30.270> need

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
it needs it this one didn't seem to need

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.740 
it needs it this one didn't seem to need
it<00:01:31.159> the<00:01:32.159> beam<00:01:32.460> hoppers<00:01:32.820> on<00:01:33.000> this<00:01:33.150> this<00:01:33.450> is<00:01:33.600> one

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
it the beam hoppers on this this is one

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.510 
it the beam hoppers on this this is one
nice<00:01:33.960> thing<00:01:33.990> they've<00:01:34.350> done<00:01:34.530> now<00:01:34.710> is<00:01:35.009> you<00:01:35.490> can

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
nice thing they've done now is you can

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.550 
nice thing they've done now is you can
actually<00:01:36.000> close<00:01:36.509> off<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.960> bean<00:01:37.110> hopper<00:01:37.320> and

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
actually close off the bean hopper and

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.530 
actually close off the bean hopper and
it<00:01:37.650> says<00:01:37.799> open<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.189> close<00:01:38.400> it<00:01:39.000> off<00:01:39.150> and<00:01:39.180> if<00:01:39.390> it

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
it says open and close it off and if it

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.350 
it says open and close it off and if it
has<00:01:39.659> beans<00:01:39.960> it<00:01:40.140> get<00:01:40.619> take<00:01:40.920> it<00:01:41.040> off<00:01:41.189> Oh<00:01:41.400> like

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
has beans it get take it off Oh like

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.490 
has beans it get take it off Oh like
that<00:01:43.280> so<00:01:44.280> your<00:01:44.579> beans<00:01:44.729> won't<00:01:44.970> spill

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:45.500 
that so your beans won't spill

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.840 
that so your beans won't spill
she's<00:01:46.500> long<00:01:46.740> as<00:01:47.009> a<00:01:47.040> little<00:01:47.280> gate<00:01:47.430> valve<00:01:47.640> down

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
she's long as a little gate valve down

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.899 
she's long as a little gate valve down
there<00:01:48.090> okay<00:01:48.570> bill<00:01:49.280> so<00:01:50.280> that's<00:01:50.490> definitely<00:01:50.670> an

if you are sada the three annual machine
never<00:02:13.350> been<00:02:13.560> used<00:02:13.740> but<00:02:13.980> that's<00:02:14.190> the<00:02:14.310> way<00:02:14.400> they

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
never been used but that's the way they

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:15.830 
never been used but that's the way they
sometimes<00:02:15.180> you<00:02:15.390> know<00:02:15.480> they<00:02:15.600> look<00:02:15.690> like

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
sometimes you know they look like

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.090 
sometimes you know they look like
they've<00:02:15.990> been<00:02:16.110> used<00:02:16.320> because<00:02:16.830> they<00:02:16.980> are

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
they've been used because they are

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:18.920 
they've been used because they are
tested<00:02:17.460> at<00:02:17.580> the<00:02:17.670> factory<00:02:18.000> okay

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
tested at the factory okay

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.500 
tested at the factory okay
oh<00:02:19.010> and<00:02:20.010> stainless<00:02:20.670> steel<00:02:20.820> casing<00:02:21.120> these

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
oh and stainless steel casing these

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:22.640 
oh and stainless steel casing these
things<00:02:21.780> are<00:02:21.990> heavy

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
things are heavy

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.490 
things are heavy
and<00:02:22.770> knowing<00:02:23.250> the<00:02:23.400> ovals<00:02:23.760> and<00:02:24.350> all<00:02:25.350> your

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
and knowing the ovals and all your

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.550 
and knowing the ovals and all your
settings<00:02:25.800> right<00:02:26.160> here<00:02:26.430> this<00:02:26.580> is<00:02:26.760> your<00:02:26.910> initial

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
settings right here this is your initial

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.350 
settings right here this is your initial
one<00:02:28.560> you<00:02:28.920> know<00:02:29.040> one<00:02:29.220> through<00:02:29.430> ten<00:02:29.700> setting<00:02:30.209> and

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
one you know one through ten setting and

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.960 
one you know one through ten setting and
then<00:02:30.510> this<00:02:30.660> is<00:02:30.870> fine<00:02:31.080> tuning<00:02:31.440> it<00:02:31.530> okay<00:02:32.520> and

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
then this is fine tuning it okay and

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.780 
then this is fine tuning it okay and
then<00:02:33.330> you<00:02:33.450> can<00:02:33.660> program<00:02:34.470> this<00:02:35.130> is<00:02:35.310> the<00:02:35.340> manual

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
then you can program this is the manual

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.430 
then you can program this is the manual
and<00:02:36.060> then<00:02:36.180> there's<00:02:36.330> one<00:02:36.480> two<00:02:36.660> three<00:02:36.930> program

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
and then there's one two three program

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.910 
and then there's one two three program
and<00:02:37.709> you<00:02:38.250> can<00:02:38.280> they<00:02:38.700> come<00:02:39.060> from<00:02:39.300> the<00:02:39.390> factory

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
and you can they come from the factory

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.520 
and you can they come from the factory
with<00:02:40.940> weights<00:02:41.940> and<00:02:42.239> times<00:02:42.840> in<00:02:43.110> there<00:02:43.290> and<00:02:43.470> you

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
with weights and times in there and you

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.390 
with weights and times in there and you
can<00:02:43.680> change<00:02:43.860> them<00:02:44.100> okay<00:02:44.970> how<00:02:45.300> do<00:02:45.360> I<00:02:45.480> do<00:02:45.540> that

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
can change them okay how do I do that

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.240 
can change them okay how do I do that
you<00:02:47.400> get<00:02:47.610> in<00:02:47.790> here<00:02:48.090> and<00:02:48.270> I<00:02:48.390> think<00:02:48.450> you<00:02:48.750> hold<00:02:49.050> it

let's do a midpoint I try to cut my
thumb<00:04:08.940> one<00:04:09.150> a<00:04:12.500> little<00:04:13.500> workers<00:04:16.250> the<00:04:17.250> carrot

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
thumb one a little workers the carrot

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:21.760 
thumb one a little workers the carrot
one<00:04:17.790> the<00:04:18.269> thumb<00:04:18.480> yes

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:21.770 

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:25.130 

that's<00:04:22.770> the<00:04:22.950> midpoint<00:04:23.630> yeah<00:04:24.630> that's<00:04:24.990> that

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.140 
that's the midpoint yeah that's that

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:30.110 
that's the midpoint yeah that's that
would<00:04:25.440> be<00:04:25.590> a<00:04:25.620> fine<00:04:26.180> yeah<00:04:27.240> -<00:04:27.810> fine<00:04:28.820> zipper<00:04:29.820> fine

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
would be a fine yeah - fine zipper fine

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:43.020 
would be a fine yeah - fine zipper fine
okay<00:04:30.750> let's<00:04:31.620> take<00:04:31.860> this<00:04:31.919> down<00:04:32.340> actually

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.030 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.210 

moo-hoo

we got euro gravel well it's a good

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.939 
we got euro gravel well it's a good
pressed<00:04:49.910> pot<00:04:50.180> yep<00:04:50.870> that'll<00:04:51.470> fill<00:04:51.650> in<00:04:51.800> the

00:04:51.939 --> 00:04:51.949 
pressed pot yep that'll fill in the

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:54.850 
pressed pot yep that'll fill in the
voids<00:04:52.220> in<00:04:52.340> your<00:04:52.960> highway<00:04:53.960> it's<00:04:54.590> pretty

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 
voids in your highway it's pretty

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:56.920 
voids in your highway it's pretty
consistent<00:04:55.100> though<00:04:55.610> still<00:04:55.940> Vail<00:04:56.120> it<00:04:56.509> is<00:04:56.630> it's

consistent though still Vail it is it's
much<00:04:57.080> more<00:04:57.289> consistent<00:04:57.800> than<00:04:57.919> a<00:04:57.979> lot<00:04:58.100> of

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:58.220 
much more consistent than a lot of

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:00.249 
much more consistent than a lot of
growers<00:04:58.370> at<00:04:59.000> this<00:04:59.240> coarseness<00:04:59.690> upsetting

yeah it's interesting because the
mid-range<00:06:35.650> here<00:06:36.159> is<00:06:36.340> much<00:06:36.750> more<00:06:37.750> fine<00:06:38.020> than

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:38.050 
mid-range here is much more fine than

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:40.520 
mid-range here is much more fine than
than<00:06:38.710> arranged<00:06:39.069> there<00:06:39.280> well<00:06:39.819> it<00:06:39.909> should<00:06:40.090> be<00:06:40.240> I

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:40.530 
than arranged there well it should be I

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:43.860 
than arranged there well it should be I
would<00:06:41.530> expect<00:06:41.830> it<00:06:41.979> to<00:06:42.009> be<00:06:42.099> well<00:06:43.030> I<00:06:43.210> would<00:06:43.629> say

would expect it to be well I would say

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:45.990 
would expect it to be well I would say
from<00:06:44.289> what<00:06:44.470> I<00:06:44.650> see<00:06:44.889> here<00:06:45.129> you<00:06:45.370> could<00:06:45.580> use<00:06:45.610> this
