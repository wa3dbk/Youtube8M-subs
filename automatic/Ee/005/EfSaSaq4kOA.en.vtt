therefore<00:01:41.880> laser<00:01:42.600> treatment<00:01:43.380> has<00:01:43.740> become<00:01:44.189> a

therefore laser treatment has become a

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.410 
therefore laser treatment has become a
very<00:01:44.970> safe<00:01:46.070> clean<00:01:47.070> and<00:01:47.369> efficient<00:01:48.180> way<00:01:48.390> to

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
treat a fungal nail infection the reason

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.990 
treat a fungal nail infection the reason
why<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.570> laser<00:01:52.079> is<00:01:52.500> a<00:01:52.530> safe<00:01:53.009> treatment<00:01:53.729> is

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
why the laser is a safe treatment is

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.590 
why the laser is a safe treatment is
because<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.780> laser<00:01:55.079> kills<00:01:55.860> fungal<00:01:56.759> cell

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
because the laser kills fungal cell

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.639 
because the laser kills fungal cell
walls<00:01:57.960> our<00:01:58.649> cells<00:01:59.310> do<00:01:59.909> not<00:01:59.939> have<00:02:00.180> cell<00:02:00.960> walls

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
walls our cells do not have cell walls

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.969 
walls our cells do not have cell walls
therefore<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:03.060> laser<00:02:03.409> selectively<00:02:04.409> destroys

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
therefore the laser selectively destroys

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.330 
therefore the laser selectively destroys
the<00:02:05.520> fungus<00:02:06.000> and<00:02:06.360> leaves<00:02:07.229> our<00:02:07.500> surrounding

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
the fungus and leaves our surrounding

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.559 
the fungus and leaves our surrounding
skin<00:02:08.869> intact

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 
skin intact

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:14.020 
skin intact
today<00:02:11.810> I'm<00:02:12.079> going<00:02:12.379> to<00:02:12.499> be<00:02:12.739> demonstrating<00:02:13.609> how

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
today I'm going to be demonstrating how

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.559 
today I'm going to be demonstrating how
laser<00:02:14.450> therapy<00:02:14.810> is<00:02:15.319> performed<00:02:16.099> at<00:02:16.459> this<00:02:17.239> point

laser therapy is performed at this point

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:20.550 
laser therapy is performed at this point
we<00:02:18.019> would<00:02:18.230> have<00:02:18.349> already<00:02:18.790> divided<00:02:19.790> the<00:02:19.909> nail

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
we would have already divided the nail

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.530 
we would have already divided the nail
we<00:02:21.560> would<00:02:21.799> have<00:02:21.950> reduced<00:02:22.370> the<00:02:22.849> nail<00:02:23.030> thickness

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
we would have reduced the nail thickness

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.020 
we would have reduced the nail thickness
with<00:02:23.840> an<00:02:24.019> electric<00:02:24.560> nail<00:02:24.709> grinder<00:02:25.310> and<00:02:25.579> we

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
with an electric nail grinder and we

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:27.550 
with an electric nail grinder and we
would<00:02:26.209> have<00:02:26.359> trimmed<00:02:26.719> the<00:02:26.959> nails

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
would have trimmed the nails

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.339 
would have trimmed the nails
very<00:02:28.099> far<00:02:28.430> back<00:02:28.670> so<00:02:29.090> that<00:02:29.269> the<00:02:29.420> laser<00:02:29.629> beam<00:02:30.079> can

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:30.349 
very far back so that the laser beam can

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:33.789 
very far back so that the laser beam can
penetrate<00:02:30.739> it<00:02:31.280> is<00:02:31.969> very<00:02:32.359> important<00:02:33.200> that<00:02:33.620> the

nail for an extended period of time

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:26.770 
nail for an extended period of time
you<00:03:23.930> want<00:03:24.229> to<00:03:24.500> evenly<00:03:25.099> move<00:03:25.790> the<00:03:26.090> laser<00:03:26.299> beam

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
you want to evenly move the laser beam

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:31.929 
you want to evenly move the laser beam
over<00:03:27.349> the<00:03:27.979> nail<00:03:28.269> and<00:03:30.220> make<00:03:31.220> sure<00:03:31.489> that<00:03:31.669> it<00:03:31.819> is

00:03:31.929 --> 00:03:31.939 
over the nail and make sure that it is

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:34.899 
over the nail and make sure that it is
perpendicular<00:03:32.870> because<00:03:33.709> our<00:03:34.099> nails<00:03:34.340> do<00:03:34.669> have

00:03:34.899 --> 00:03:34.909 
perpendicular because our nails do have

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:38.530 
perpendicular because our nails do have
a<00:03:34.939> curvature<00:03:36.220> we<00:03:37.220> do<00:03:37.459> have<00:03:37.759> to<00:03:37.939> constantly
