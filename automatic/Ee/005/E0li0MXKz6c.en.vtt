well<00:02:17.099> your<00:02:17.220> first<00:02:17.459> layer<00:02:17.730> it's<00:02:18.030> still<00:02:18.239> gonna

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
well your first layer it's still gonna

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.970 
well your first layer it's still gonna
be<00:02:18.450> the<00:02:18.630> giving<00:02:18.900> it<00:02:18.989> say<00:02:19.200> if<00:02:19.410> you<00:02:19.530> play<00:02:19.739> with<00:02:19.920> it

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
tap them together you can hide that

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:25.880 
tap them together you can hide that
joint<00:02:23.750> when<00:02:24.750> it<00:02:24.870> comes<00:02:25.080> to<00:02:25.230> securing<00:02:25.770> your

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
grass down so it doesn't fly away or

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.150 
grass down so it doesn't fly away or
move<00:02:27.810> on<00:02:28.020> you<00:02:28.140> got<00:02:28.319> a<00:02:28.349> couple<00:02:28.590> options<00:02:28.739> you<00:02:29.010> can

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
move on you got a couple options you can

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.010 
move on you got a couple options you can
just<00:02:29.340> use<00:02:29.520> a<00:02:29.550> deck<00:02:29.880> now<00:02:30.060> or<00:02:30.540> you<00:02:30.780> can<00:02:30.900> buy<00:02:30.989> a

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
just use a deck now or you can buy a

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.320 
just use a deck now or you can buy a
specific<00:02:31.260> turf<00:02:32.069> piggy<00:02:32.670> which<00:02:32.940> is<00:02:33.120> good

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
specific turf piggy which is good

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.059 
specific turf piggy which is good
because<00:02:33.450> it's<00:02:33.690> green<00:02:34.080> so<00:02:34.110> it's<00:02:34.530> camouflage

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
because it's green so it's camouflage

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:38.960 
because it's green so it's camouflage
and<00:02:35.730> when<00:02:35.940> it<00:02:36.060> goes<00:02:36.209> in<00:02:36.739> it<00:02:37.739> holds<00:02:38.459> down<00:02:38.580> more

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
and when it goes in it holds down more

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.940 
and when it goes in it holds down more
of<00:02:39.060> the<00:02:39.180> grass<00:02:39.420> so<00:02:39.720> as<00:02:39.840> the<00:02:40.019> turf<00:02:40.260> gets<00:02:40.530> tired

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
of the grass so as the turf gets tired

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.740 
of the grass so as the turf gets tired
it<00:02:41.370> starts<00:02:41.910> to<00:02:42.000> break<00:02:42.180> down<00:02:42.209> and<00:02:42.540> be<00:02:42.599> in<00:02:42.690> the

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
it starts to break down and be in the

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.600 
it starts to break down and be in the
Sun<00:02:42.959> will<00:02:43.620> hold<00:02:43.830> there<00:02:44.010> longer

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.490 

I'm<00:02:46.940> putting<00:02:47.210> the<00:02:47.300> pegs<00:02:47.510> in<00:02:47.750> about<00:02:47.990> every<00:02:48.140> 30

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
I'm putting the pegs in about every 30

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.020 
I'm putting the pegs in about every 30
or<00:02:48.650> 40<00:02:49.040> centimeters<00:02:49.520> and<00:02:49.610> when<00:02:49.760> I'm<00:02:49.880> finished

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
or 40 centimeters and when I'm finished

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.150 
or 40 centimeters and when I'm finished
I'll<00:02:50.600> come<00:02:50.840> about<00:02:51.050> another<00:02:51.350> 100<00:02:51.770> mil<00:02:51.920> pass

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160 
I'll come about another 100 mil pass

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.560 
I'll come about another 100 mil pass
then<00:02:52.460> just<00:02:53.120> cut<00:02:53.270> off<00:02:53.360> all<00:02:53.510> the<00:02:53.630> exits<00:02:55.390> the<00:02:56.390> best

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:56.570 
then just cut off all the exits the best

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
I'm thinking is putting a sand bunker in

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.820 
I'm thinking is putting a sand bunker in
here<00:03:08.030> so<00:03:08.600> you<00:03:08.660> can<00:03:08.750> practice<00:03:09.200> your<00:03:09.350> chips<00:03:09.620> up

here so you can practice your chips up
to<00:03:09.980> the<00:03:10.100> hole<00:03:10.250> up<00:03:10.430> the<00:03:10.550> other<00:03:10.700> end<00:03:10.880> you<00:03:10.940> like

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
to the hole up the other end you like

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.670 
to the hole up the other end you like
the<00:03:11.210> idea<00:03:11.330> of<00:03:11.510> that<00:03:11.600> yeah<00:03:11.990> all<00:03:12.230> right<00:03:12.350> but<00:03:12.560> now

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
thing about this is it's washed beach

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.990 
thing about this is it's washed beach
sand<00:03:48.110> does<00:03:48.320> any<00:03:48.590> clay<00:03:48.890> in<00:03:48.950> it<00:03:49.160> so<00:03:49.580> I<00:03:49.610> can't
