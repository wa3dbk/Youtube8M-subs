where you want to string together a

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.270 
where you want to string together a
number<00:00:51.420> of<00:00:51.600> combinations<00:00:52.260> because<00:00:52.890> it<00:00:53.100> looks

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
number of combinations because it looks

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.439 
number of combinations because it looks
like<00:00:53.340> it's<00:00:53.579> just<00:00:53.760> like<00:00:53.850> a<00:00:53.879> cell<00:00:54.149> like<00:00:54.420> this

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
like it's just like a cell like this

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.119 
like it's just like a cell like this
that<00:00:54.870> your<00:00:55.050> thumb<00:00:55.260> should<00:00:55.559> be<00:00:55.620> able<00:00:55.739> to<00:00:55.860> just

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
that your thumb should be able to just

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.250 
that your thumb should be able to just
flow<00:00:56.370> over<00:00:56.579> pretty<00:00:57.000> smoothly<00:00:57.300> to<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.989> do<00:00:58.109> these

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
flow over pretty smoothly to to do these

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.840 
flow over pretty smoothly to to do these
combinations<00:00:58.949> but<00:00:59.309> then<00:00:59.460> you<00:00:59.550> can<00:00:59.670> switch

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
combinations but then you can switch

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.310 
combinations but then you can switch
over<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.090> the<00:01:00.210> traditional<00:01:00.690> d-pad<00:01:01.109> if<00:01:01.260> you

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
over to the traditional d-pad if you

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.900 
over to the traditional d-pad if you
just<00:01:01.469> want<00:01:01.710> to<00:01:01.800> use<00:01:01.949> it<00:01:02.070> for<00:01:02.100> a<00:01:02.280> game<00:01:02.489> that<00:01:02.760> only

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
just want to use it for a game that only

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.240 
just want to use it for a game that only
uses<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.329> d-pad<00:01:03.690> for<00:01:03.930> those<00:01:04.080> four<00:01:04.350> things<00:01:04.680> we

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
uses the d-pad for those four things we

you<00:01:19.229> can<00:01:19.380> do<00:01:19.500> that<00:01:19.710> with<00:01:19.920> this<00:01:20.100> I'm<00:01:20.369> gonna<00:01:20.490> go

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
you can do that with this I'm gonna go

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.160 
you can do that with this I'm gonna go
back<00:01:20.820> you're<00:01:21.000> gonna<00:01:21.090> see<00:01:21.330> some<00:01:21.570> paddles<00:01:22.020> now

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
back you're gonna see some paddles now

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.179 
back you're gonna see some paddles now
these<00:01:22.320> paddles<00:01:22.590> are<00:01:22.680> going<00:01:22.799> to<00:01:22.860> be<00:01:22.920> mostly

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
these paddles are going to be mostly

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.010 
these paddles are going to be mostly
aimed<00:01:23.430> for<00:01:23.729> driving<00:01:24.240> games<00:01:24.450> because<00:01:24.810> you<00:01:24.840> can

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
aimed for driving games because you can

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.410 
aimed for driving games because you can
use<00:01:25.200> them<00:01:25.380> to<00:01:25.590> ship<00:01:25.890> to<00:01:26.189> accelerate<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:27.119> brake

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
use them to ship to accelerate to brake

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.240 
use them to ship to accelerate to brake
but<00:01:27.960> you<00:01:28.020> can<00:01:28.140> also<00:01:28.320> assign<00:01:28.650> them<00:01:28.920> as<00:01:29.009> regular

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
but you can also assign them as regular

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:30.560 
but you can also assign them as regular
buttons<00:01:29.700> as<00:01:29.820> well<00:01:30.000> so<00:01:30.180> if<00:01:30.240> you're<00:01:30.329> gonna<00:01:30.420> use

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
buttons as well so if you're gonna use

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.450 
buttons as well so if you're gonna use
them<00:01:30.720> from<00:01:30.869> other<00:01:31.110> games<00:01:31.409> you<00:01:31.890> can<00:01:32.040> do<00:01:32.130> that<00:01:32.280> as

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
them from other games you can do that as

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.710 
them from other games you can do that as
well<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:32.790> it's<00:01:32.939> pretty<00:01:33.090> cool<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.360> see<00:01:33.390> them

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
well and it's pretty cool to see them

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.450 
well and it's pretty cool to see them
now<00:01:33.900> these<00:01:34.350> paddles<00:01:34.740> look<00:01:34.979> like<00:01:35.159> something

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
now these paddles look like something

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.249 
now these paddles look like something
that<00:01:35.490> you<00:01:35.670> may<00:01:35.880> not<00:01:36.060> want<00:01:36.299> to<00:01:36.360> have<00:01:36.570> on<00:01:36.840> all<00:01:37.079> the

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
that you may not want to have on all the

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.660 
that you may not want to have on all the
time<00:01:37.470> and<00:01:37.500> that's<00:01:37.829> fine<00:01:38.070> because<00:01:38.220> you<00:01:38.520> can

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
time and that's fine because you can

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.819 
time and that's fine because you can
take<00:01:38.850> them<00:01:39.060> off<00:01:39.270> you<00:01:39.810> can<00:01:39.840> rearrange<00:01:40.229> them<00:01:40.680> you

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
take them off you can rearrange them you

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:41.780 
take them off you can rearrange them you
can<00:01:40.950> move<00:01:41.070> around<00:01:41.340> at<00:01:41.549> different

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
can move around at different

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.850 
can move around at different
combinations<00:01:41.939> you<00:01:42.570> can<00:01:43.259> do<00:01:43.350> that<00:01:43.500> pretty<00:01:43.649> much

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
combinations you can do that pretty much

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.770 
combinations you can do that pretty much
with<00:01:44.070> most<00:01:44.399> of<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.610> most<00:01:44.880> important<00:01:45.329> tools<00:01:45.509> on

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
with most of the most important tools on

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.359 
with most of the most important tools on
this<00:01:45.960> controller<00:01:46.380> with<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.649> thumb<00:01:47.100> sticks

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369

the hardware set the way you want you
can<00:02:05.909> create<00:02:06.149> unlimited<00:02:06.299> controller<00:02:07.079> profile

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
can create unlimited controller profile

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:08.869 
can create unlimited controller profile
so<00:02:07.710> you<00:02:07.770> may<00:02:07.890> have<00:02:08.009> one<00:02:08.069> for<00:02:08.369> your<00:02:08.489> brother<00:02:08.670> who

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
may have a couple for yourself but then

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.470 
may have a couple for yourself but then
you<00:02:11.129> get<00:02:11.220> to<00:02:11.400> be<00:02:11.550> that<00:02:11.730> you<00:02:11.879> really<00:02:12.120> like<00:02:12.300> you

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
you get to be that you really like you

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.610 
you get to be that you really like you
can<00:02:12.510> actually<00:02:12.840> load<00:02:13.110> those

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
can actually load those

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:14.960 
can actually load those
into<00:02:13.920> the<00:02:14.010> controller<00:02:14.340> and<00:02:14.549> switch<00:02:14.790> between

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
into the controller and switch between

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:16.520 
into the controller and switch between
them<00:02:15.269> so<00:02:15.420> say<00:02:15.569> you<00:02:15.629> really<00:02:15.840> like<00:02:16.019> to<00:02:16.110> play<00:02:16.260> call

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
them so say you really like to play call

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.589 
them so say you really like to play call
of<00:02:16.560> duty<00:02:16.950> but<00:02:17.400> then<00:02:17.549> also<00:02:17.790> like<00:02:18.090> to<00:02:18.330> play

00:02:18.589 --> 00:02:18.599 
of duty but then also like to play

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:20.869 
of duty but then also like to play
another<00:02:18.900> game<00:02:19.200> like<00:02:19.680> Mortal<00:02:20.069> Kombat<00:02:20.459> so<00:02:20.790> you

00:02:20.869 --> 00:02:20.879 
another game like Mortal Kombat so you

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:22.490 
another game like Mortal Kombat so you
can<00:02:21.000> switch<00:02:21.180> between<00:02:21.299> those<00:02:21.569> two<00:02:21.750> profiles<00:02:22.230> on

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
can switch between those two profiles on

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.410 
can switch between those two profiles on
the<00:02:22.650> fly<00:02:22.830> right<00:02:23.069> on<00:02:23.190> the<00:02:23.310> controller<00:02:23.670> and<00:02:24.269> so

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
the fly right on the controller and so

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.149 
the fly right on the controller and so
with<00:02:24.569> the<00:02:24.629> addition<00:02:25.019> of<00:02:25.140> a<00:02:25.260> headphone<00:02:25.680> jack<00:02:25.739> at

00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:26.159 
with the addition of a headphone jack at

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:27.830 
with the addition of a headphone jack at
the<00:02:26.280> bottom<00:02:26.610> in<00:02:26.760> this<00:02:26.879> controller<00:02:27.239> is<00:02:27.420> elite

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
the bottom in this controller is elite

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.089 
the bottom in this controller is elite
it<00:02:27.989> definitely<00:02:28.319> is<00:02:28.440> better<00:02:28.739> than<00:02:28.980> the

00:02:29.089 --> 00:02:29.099 
it definitely is better than the

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:30.229 
it definitely is better than the
standard<00:02:29.370> control<00:02:29.730> that<00:02:29.879> comes<00:02:30.060> with<00:02:30.180> the

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
standard control that comes with the

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:32.240 
standard control that comes with the
Xbox<00:02:30.629> one<00:02:30.870> now<00:02:31.409> that<00:02:31.620> again<00:02:31.829> you<00:02:31.950> do<00:02:32.069> have

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
Xbox one now that again you do have

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.530 
Xbox one now that again you do have
other<00:02:32.370> options<00:02:32.519> on<00:02:32.940> the<00:02:33.030> market<00:02:33.180> right<00:02:33.510> now

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
other options on the market right now

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.479 
other options on the market right now
but<00:02:33.690> Microsoft<00:02:34.260> has<00:02:34.530> put<00:02:34.920> together<00:02:35.040> a<00:02:35.280> very
