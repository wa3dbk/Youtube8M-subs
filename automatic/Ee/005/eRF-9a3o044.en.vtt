00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.150
 Today 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:11.240
 Rome to replace the pump replacements 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:14.269
 p &amp; g water pump 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:16.309
 car lights vaz need 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:18.410
 change for two reasons first bomb 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:21.200
 flowed that is found on the pump 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:23.480
 traces of coolant leakage so 

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.759
 like 1 drop then the word antifreeze can 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.920
 very quickly turn into a stream if a 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:28.609
 the liquid will be under minutes 

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:31.789
 by car 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:33.620
 the second reason the pump buzzed a little 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:37.670
 more time to think before 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:40.160
 pump will flow or jam in both 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.230
 In cases of a total of one failure of the pump 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.900
 engine overheating and further 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.970
 driving a car with 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:49.280
 towing cable and decide to hold 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:52.220
 or replace yourself or better 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.260
 contact the auto master now buy 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.080
 pump and inventory tools 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.699
 who will need to work 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.690
 now for replacement tool 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:01.670
 water pump 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:05.420
 you will need rozhkovy and cap 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:08.479
 keys for 8-10 1317 container for draining 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:11.060
 coolant screwdriver wrench on 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:13.280
 2730 in case if instead of a drain 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:15.409
 plugs on the radiator will have to unscrew 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.140
 fan switch sensor 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:19.159
 and now the description of the replacement pump or 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.159
 water pump 

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:25.719
 as you see here is already old 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:28.700
 the pump which fulfilled the service life and 

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:31.880
 then already installed new 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:34.009
 pump the first thing we do is 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.229
 unscrew the drain plug on the block 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:41.740
 engine and drain the liquid in advance 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:45.579
 prepared container here I am approaching 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.579
 from the shelf line 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:52.600
 here we see her unscrew it and 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.600
 pour out the liquid 

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:00.500
 if you are going to change completely 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:05.000
 coolant then you can also 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:07.640
 drain this fluid from the radiator by unscrewing 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.460
 on the radiator also drain plug here 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:13.340
 or slightly unscrew it 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:17.630
 by drain the next step 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:19.670
 this remove the battery unscrew 3 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:24.770
 fan mounting bolts remove 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:27.290
 you can release the key with the key for 17 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.400
 do not completely unscrew the nut 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.610
 alternator belt 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.880
 weaken the stretch and remove the belt after 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:37.730
 This is also the key for 17 unscrew 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:42.020
 fastener nut brackets to show off and retain 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:46.940
 brace to the side here's a nut 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:53.870
 alternator belt tensioner and here are the nuts 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:57.709
 fasteners to the pump holding 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:03:00.350
 screwdriver pin computer and unscrew 3 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:02.090
 bolts and remove the pulley but it 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:06.370
 already of course after weakened 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:08.959
 change but here i have three bolts 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.790
 fan bolted pitching that's why 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:12.860
 maybe someone first needs to 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:16.120
 open them unscrew the fan then 

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:16.120
 already unscrew the pulley 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:24.010
 it now remains to unscrew the 4 nuts 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:26.030
 motor fastener engine turned on 13 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.770
 the rest of the assembly is carried out in reverse 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:29.690
 pouring sequences 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:31.489
 coolant don't forget 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.530
 put the crane control lever 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:36.170
 heating radiator to open position 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.630
 and to unplug the system 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.940
 intake manifold hose 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:43.459
 here's the hose that goes to the inlet 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:46.280
 I unplug it to the collector 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:47.800
 up so that the liquid does not flow out and after 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.320
 after the liquid has already been poured 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:54.959
 all connect back and run 

00:03:51.320 --> 00:04:00.330
 the engine is already new to get 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:04:00.330
 I send everyone good luck take care of yourself on the road
