 trumpet 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:20.900
 with the intro is an arrangement that 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.900
 listen well 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.309

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.320
 10 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:06.260
 it would be the note 

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:08.440
 and then the number 8 fret in the same 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.440

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.060

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:48.080
 second string 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:52.820
 fernando 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:55.360
 then on the third string to the fret 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.360
 19 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:08.140
 then return to the number 8 fret 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.140
 the second rope 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.369
 forgive me 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:23.160
 and after that you touch the 10 8 10 the 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.160
 transfers of the second rope 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:30.870
 on the first string the number 8 fret 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.870

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.420
 rope 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:50.640

 then again 18 days of the second 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:01.230
 rope 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:04.739
 and again 87 from the general 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:07.480

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:10.599
 second string 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:13.349
 after the first string 8 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:13.349
 and then 10 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:22.020
 and after that go down to the number 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:26.360

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:26.360
 after 6 followed by the other time 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:38.460
 after 535 always the second so 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:40.550
 all together or it would not be like that 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:40.550
 and 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:05.180
 and the trumpet is on the first string the 

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:08.750
 fret number 

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:12.940
 10 starts there 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.940
 then the fret 8 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:19.090
 after 7 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:19.090
 again 

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:24.850
 then the same thing is repeated again 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:34.020
 then the fret 57 followed by the 7 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:34.020

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.460
 sawyer and so everything 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:05:01.240
 and that would be the intro and the trumpets 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:04.120
 to put a link for what would be the 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:07.680
