we're<00:01:18.210> talking<00:01:18.540> see<00:01:18.720> now<00:01:19.110> so<00:01:19.740> that's<00:01:19.920> c<00:01:20.130> d<00:01:20.310> e<00:01:20.340> f

we're talking see now so that's c d e f
g<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:21.030> b<00:01:21.560> now<00:01:22.560> i<00:01:22.590> guess<00:01:22.830> what<00:01:22.979> happens<00:01:23.280> when<00:01:23.400> you

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
g a b now i guess what happens when you

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.060 
g a b now i guess what happens when you
start<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:24.000> scale<00:01:24.270> on<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.840> second<00:01:25.439> note<00:01:25.860> of

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
start the scale on the second note of

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.710 
start the scale on the second note of
the<00:01:26.159> major<00:01:26.189> scale<00:01:26.490> which<00:01:26.820> in<00:01:27.030> this<00:01:27.270> case<00:01:27.330> and

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
the major scale which in this case and

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.050 
the major scale which in this case and
the<00:01:27.810> key<00:01:27.930> of<00:01:28.020> C<00:01:28.170> would<00:01:28.470> be<00:01:28.590> D<00:01:28.860> so<00:01:29.670> now<00:01:29.880> we're

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
the key of C would be D so now we're

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:36.109 
the key of C would be D so now we're
playing<00:01:30.329> D<00:01:30.810> Dorian<00:01:31.340> d<00:01:32.340> e<00:01:32.579> f<00:01:33.119> g<00:01:33.240> a<00:01:33.960> b<00:01:33.990> c<00:01:34.970> we're<00:01:35.970> not

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
playing D Dorian d e f g a b c we're not

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.319 
playing D Dorian d e f g a b c we're not
changing<00:01:36.450> anything<00:01:37.200> a<00:01:37.850> of<00:01:38.850> the<00:01:39.000> major<00:01:39.150> scale

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
changing anything a of the major scale

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.210 
changing anything a of the major scale
it's<00:01:39.990> just<00:01:40.140> because<00:01:40.350> of<00:01:40.470> the<00:01:40.500> order<00:01:40.890> of<00:01:41.009> notes

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
it's just because of the order of notes

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.999 
it's just because of the order of notes
we're<00:01:41.579> not<00:01:41.670> changing<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:42.860> sharps<00:01:43.860> or<00:01:43.950> flats
