basically<00:00:23.100> mushrooms<00:00:23.609> have<00:00:23.760> an<00:00:23.880> issue<00:00:24.000> with

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
basically mushrooms have an issue with

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.570 
basically mushrooms have an issue with
light<00:00:24.480> levels<00:00:24.930> and<00:00:25.170> this<00:00:25.859> little<00:00:26.039> setup<00:00:26.340> that

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
light levels and this little setup that

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.960 
light levels and this little setup that
he<00:00:26.730> had<00:00:27.289> enables<00:00:28.289> you<00:00:28.500> to<00:00:28.529> grow<00:00:28.980> mushrooms

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
he had enables you to grow mushrooms

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.910 
he had enables you to grow mushrooms
like<00:00:30.480> above-ground<00:00:30.810> I<00:00:31.320> guess<00:00:31.560> or<00:00:31.769> without

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:31.920 
like above-ground I guess or without

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:35.060 
like above-ground I guess or without
having<00:00:32.340> to<00:00:33.030> be<00:00:33.180> in<00:00:33.210> a<00:00:33.360> big<00:00:33.540> old<00:00:33.690> dark<00:00:34.020> area<00:00:34.410> now

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
having to be in a big old dark area now

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.979 
having to be in a big old dark area now
the<00:00:35.130> problem<00:00:35.430> with<00:00:35.579> his<00:00:35.940> setup<00:00:36.300> I<00:00:36.630> think<00:00:36.930> he

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
the problem with his setup I think he

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.170 
the problem with his setup I think he
got<00:00:37.140> it<00:00:37.170> from<00:00:37.350> a<00:00:37.469> sub<00:00:37.680> he<00:00:37.800> mentions<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:38.940> just

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
got it from a sub he mentions and just

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.360 
got it from a sub he mentions and just
to<00:00:39.329> illustrate<00:00:39.570> you<00:00:40.079> can't<00:00:40.350> place<00:00:40.739> mushrooms

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
to illustrate you can't place mushrooms

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.990 
to illustrate you can't place mushrooms
down<00:00:43.070> and<00:00:44.070> actually<00:00:44.219> in<00:00:44.460> this<00:00:44.579> case<00:00:44.820> we're

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
down and actually in this case we're

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.889 
down and actually in this case we're
going<00:00:45.030> to<00:00:45.149> use<00:00:45.210> brown<00:00:45.989> mushrooms<00:00:46.559> because<00:00:47.899> the

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
going to use brown mushrooms because the

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.500 
going to use brown mushrooms because the
normal<00:00:49.260> mushrooms<00:00:49.680> are<00:00:49.920> kind<00:00:50.399> of<00:00:50.610> it<00:00:50.789> kind<00:00:51.030> of

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
normal mushrooms are kind of it kind of

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.180 
normal mushrooms are kind of it kind of
a<00:00:51.600> pain<00:00:51.750> kind<00:00:52.020> of<00:00:52.079> pain<00:00:52.260> okay<00:00:52.739> so<00:00:52.800> this<00:00:52.949> is<00:00:53.100> the

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
a pain kind of pain okay so this is the

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.760 
a pain kind of pain okay so this is the
problem<00:00:53.370> right<00:00:53.690> what<00:00:54.690> happens<00:00:55.020> is<00:00:55.260> you're<00:00:55.649> not

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
problem right what happens is you're not

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.590 
problem right what happens is you're not
able<00:00:55.890> to<00:00:56.100> place<00:00:56.280> mushrooms<00:00:56.699> down<00:00:56.879> right<00:00:57.329> even

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
able to place mushrooms down right even

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.150 
able to place mushrooms down right even
on<00:00:57.719> dirt<00:00:57.960> see<00:00:58.199> I<00:00:58.260> got<00:00:58.410> some<00:00:58.559> dirt<00:00:58.770> back<00:00:58.949> there

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
on dirt see I got some dirt back there

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.549 
on dirt see I got some dirt back there
nope<00:00:59.370> won't<00:00:59.850> do<00:00:59.969> it<00:01:00.090> it<00:01:00.719> has<00:01:00.870> to<00:01:01.020> be<00:01:01.050> low<00:01:01.320> light

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
nope won't do it it has to be low light

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:03.709 
nope won't do it it has to be low light
level<00:01:01.890> so<00:01:02.579> what's<00:01:02.730> to<00:01:02.789> avoid<00:01:03.090> would<00:01:03.270> expect

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
level so what's to avoid would expect

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.020 
level so what's to avoid would expect
you<00:01:03.840> to<00:01:03.930> do<00:01:04.199> like<00:01:04.680> you<00:01:04.830> guys<00:01:04.979> are<00:01:05.189> peons<00:01:05.580> is<00:01:05.820> to

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
you to do like you guys are peons is to

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.480 
you to do like you guys are peons is to
place<00:01:06.750> a<00:01:07.049> block<00:01:07.409> here<00:01:07.470> so<00:01:08.130> let's<00:01:08.310> just

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
place a block here so let's just

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.590 
place a block here so let's just
manually<00:01:08.939> do<00:01:09.240> it<00:01:09.619> place<00:01:10.619> your<00:01:10.830> mushroom

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
manually do it place your mushroom

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.920 
manually do it place your mushroom
remove<00:01:12.600> this<00:01:12.810> block<00:01:13.140> and<00:01:14.210> then<00:01:15.210> bonemeal<00:01:15.720> it

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
remove this block and then bonemeal it

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.530 
remove this block and then bonemeal it
there<00:01:16.500> we<00:01:16.590> go<00:01:16.710> right<00:01:17.189> of<00:01:17.490> course<00:01:17.880> in<00:01:18.090> survival

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
there we go right of course in survival

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.640 
there we go right of course in survival
you<00:01:18.630> would<00:01:18.720> go<00:01:18.840> ahead<00:01:18.930> and<00:01:19.020> break<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.380> blocks

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
you would go ahead and break the blocks

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.140 
you would go ahead and break the blocks
and<00:01:19.890> harvest<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:21.259> harvester<00:01:22.259> shrooms<00:01:23.150> now

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
and harvest the harvester shrooms now

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.240 
and harvest the harvester shrooms now
one<00:01:24.509> thing<00:01:24.540> is<00:01:24.869> I<00:01:25.110> do<00:01:25.170> not<00:01:25.530> recommend<00:01:25.890> using

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
one thing is I do not recommend using

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.590 
one thing is I do not recommend using
this<00:01:26.960> machine<00:01:27.960> on<00:01:28.729> the<00:01:29.729> red<00:01:30.180> mushrooms

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
this machine on the red mushrooms

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.910 
this machine on the red mushrooms
because<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:31.049> red<00:01:31.170> mushrooms<00:01:31.560> they<00:01:31.710> live

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
because the red mushrooms they live

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.260 
because the red mushrooms they live
their<00:01:32.100> own<00:01:32.130> life<00:01:32.369> they<00:01:32.610> do<00:01:32.670> what<00:01:32.880> they<00:01:33.000> want<00:01:33.210> to

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
their own life they do what they want to

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.880 
their own life they do what they want to
do<00:01:33.450> now<00:01:33.960> let<00:01:34.079> me<00:01:34.110> tell<00:01:34.320> you<00:01:34.409> something<00:01:34.740> they'll

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
do now let me tell you something they'll

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.969 
do now let me tell you something they'll
also<00:01:35.479> the<00:01:36.479> size<00:01:36.960> of<00:01:37.170> this<00:01:37.290> matters<00:01:37.770> for

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
also the size of this matters for

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:40.399 
also the size of this matters for
example<00:01:38.490> if<00:01:38.970> I<00:01:39.240> play<00:01:39.509> something<00:01:39.930> here<00:01:40.200> like

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
example if I play something here like

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.950 
example if I play something here like
right<00:01:40.680> directly<00:01:41.100> above<00:01:41.400> it<00:01:41.579> it'll<00:01:42.570> work<00:01:42.750> but

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
right directly above it it'll work but

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.960 
right directly above it it'll work but
it'll<00:01:43.110> but<00:01:43.380> it<00:01:43.530> like<00:01:43.860> a<00:01:43.890> bud<00:01:44.159> switch<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:44.670> it'll

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
it'll but it like a bud switch and it'll

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.490 
it'll but it like a bud switch and it'll
kind<00:01:45.240> of<00:01:45.299> effect<00:01:45.689> it<00:01:45.840> so<00:01:46.049> you<00:01:46.229> know<00:01:46.320> you're

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
kind of effect it so you know you're

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.020 
kind of effect it so you know you're
gonna<00:01:46.619> have<00:01:46.799> to<00:01:46.920> have<00:01:47.040> at<00:01:47.220> least<00:01:47.250> two<00:01:47.729> blocks

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
gonna have to have at least two blocks

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.330 
gonna have to have at least two blocks
above<00:01:48.210> it<00:01:48.479> but<00:01:49.350> yeah<00:01:49.439> long<00:01:49.680> story<00:01:49.710> short<00:01:50.159> don't

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
above it but yeah long story short don't

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.440 
above it but yeah long story short don't
use<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.759> this<00:01:51.659> for<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:51.960> red<00:01:52.079> mushrooms<00:01:52.500> I

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 
use the this for the red mushrooms I

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.719 
use the this for the red mushrooms I
will<00:01:54.450> do<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:55.079> next<00:01:55.380> tutorial<00:01:55.530> video<00:01:56.159> is<00:01:56.430> going

through<00:02:13.220> a<00:02:13.250> little<00:02:13.310> bit<00:02:13.520> of<00:02:13.550> redstone<00:02:13.850> it's

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
through a little bit of redstone it's

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.380 
through a little bit of redstone it's
going<00:02:14.630> to<00:02:14.690> go<00:02:14.840> ahead<00:02:14.900> and<00:02:15.050> close<00:02:15.710> it<00:02:15.770> off<00:02:16.390> give

simple<00:02:36.590> I<00:02:36.620> just<00:02:36.920> built<00:02:37.130> it<00:02:37.280> I<00:02:37.370> like<00:02:38.150> I<00:02:38.420> was<00:02:39.050> like

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
simple I just built it I like I was like

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.960 
simple I just built it I like I was like
okay<00:02:39.560> let<00:02:39.770> me<00:02:39.830> just<00:02:39.860> do<00:02:40.190> this<00:02:40.220> but<00:02:40.820> with

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
okay let me just do this but with

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.410 
okay let me just do this but with
redstone<00:02:41.420> and<00:02:41.780> there<00:02:41.990> now<00:02:42.170> then<00:02:43.010> yeah<00:02:43.460> so<00:02:44.390> I

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
redstone and there now then yeah so I

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.810 
redstone and there now then yeah so I
might<00:02:45.260> have<00:02:45.440> to<00:02:45.470> look<00:02:45.650> at<00:02:45.770> and<00:02:46.040> my<00:02:46.250> designer

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:46.820 
might have to look at and my designer

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.280 
might have to look at and my designer
today<00:02:47.060> so<00:02:47.450> let's<00:02:47.660> get<00:02:47.900> rid<00:02:47.990> of<00:02:48.050> the<00:02:48.140> red

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:48.290 
today so let's get rid of the red

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:50.140 
today so let's get rid of the red
mushrooms<00:02:48.620> because<00:02:48.710> they're<00:02:48.920> jerks<00:02:49.430> so<00:02:49.940> let's

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
mushrooms because they're jerks so let's

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:52.180 
mushrooms because they're jerks so let's
start<00:02:50.450> with<00:02:50.660> a<00:02:50.720> piston<00:02:51.320> going<00:02:51.530> up<00:02:51.650> like<00:02:51.710> dancer

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
start with a piston going up like dancer

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.280 
start with a piston going up like dancer
piston<00:02:52.550> like<00:02:52.640> this<00:02:52.850> then<00:02:53.420> one<00:02:53.450> two<00:02:53.750> three<00:02:54.110> and

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
piston like this then one two three and

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.980 
piston like this then one two three and
then<00:02:55.040> like<00:02:55.070> so<00:02:55.790> so<00:02:56.060> this<00:02:56.270> is<00:02:56.480> basically<00:02:56.660> going

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:56.990 
then like so so this is basically going

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:59.050 
then like so so this is basically going
to<00:02:57.050> get<00:02:57.230> like<00:02:57.440> go<00:02:57.920> up<00:02:57.950> and<00:02:58.130> then<00:02:58.430> push<00:02:58.670> that<00:02:58.700> one

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
to get like go up and then push that one

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.550 
to get like go up and then push that one
out<00:02:59.240> okay<00:02:59.510> so<00:03:00.050> we're<00:03:00.140> going<00:03:00.230> to<00:03:00.320> go<00:03:00.380> ahead<00:03:00.440> and

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:00.560 
out okay so we're going to go ahead and

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.590 
out okay so we're going to go ahead and
put<00:03:00.740> block<00:03:00.950> here<00:03:01.160> block<00:03:01.430> here<00:03:01.700> kind<00:03:02.360> of<00:03:02.450> go

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
put block here block here kind of go

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.150 
put block here block here kind of go
around<00:03:02.690> this<00:03:03.080> way<00:03:03.140> this<00:03:03.560> way<00:03:03.740> this<00:03:03.770> way<00:03:04.130> this

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
around this way this way this way this

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.980 
around this way this way this way this
way<00:03:04.580> leave<00:03:05.210> that<00:03:05.240> one<00:03:05.540> here<00:03:05.660> but<00:03:05.810> we're<00:03:05.900> going

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:05.990 
way leave that one here but we're going

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:08.050 
way leave that one here but we're going
to<00:03:06.050> make<00:03:06.230> it<00:03:06.410> white<00:03:06.920> just<00:03:07.220> for<00:03:07.520> the<00:03:07.820> sake<00:03:08.030> of

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
to make it white just for the sake of

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.690 
to make it white just for the sake of
making<00:03:08.510> it's<00:03:08.810> white<00:03:09.020> and<00:03:09.230> then<00:03:10.040> out<00:03:10.250> like<00:03:10.460> so

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:10.700 
making it's white and then out like so

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.120 
making it's white and then out like so
and<00:03:10.970> then<00:03:11.030> a<00:03:11.150> lever<00:03:11.740> so<00:03:12.740> we're<00:03:12.830> going<00:03:12.890> to<00:03:13.010> put

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
and then a lever so we're going to put

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:14.770 
and then a lever so we're going to put
redstone<00:03:13.400> redstone<00:03:13.820> rats<00:03:14.270> and<00:03:14.480> rats<00:03:14.600> two<00:03:14.750> rats

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
redstone redstone rats and rats two rats

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.150 
redstone redstone rats and rats two rats
down<00:03:15.340> actually<00:03:16.930> repeater<00:03:17.930> repeater<00:03:18.500> here<00:03:18.800> on

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
down actually repeater repeater here on

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.630 
down actually repeater repeater here on
one<00:03:19.520> tick<00:03:20.260> like<00:03:21.260> so<00:03:21.530> and<00:03:21.770> then<00:03:21.800> repeat<00:03:22.280> it<00:03:22.400> here

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
one tick like so and then repeat it here

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.800 
one tick like so and then repeat it here
one<00:03:22.910> tick<00:03:23.950> that's<00:03:24.950> dust<00:03:25.610> let's<00:03:26.150> just<00:03:26.420> test<00:03:26.660> it

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
one tick that's dust let's just test it

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.330 
one tick that's dust let's just test it
that<00:03:26.959> it<00:03:27.050> goes<00:03:27.230> up<00:03:27.440> and<00:03:27.770> out<00:03:27.890> oh<00:03:29.650> oops<00:03:30.650> forgot

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:31.340 
that it goes up and out oh oops forgot

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.750 
that it goes up and out oh oops forgot
some<00:03:31.489> redstone<00:03:31.640> dust<00:03:32.000> there<00:03:33.520> there<00:03:34.520> we<00:03:34.610> go

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
some redstone dust there there we go

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.910 
some redstone dust there there we go
there<00:03:35.750> we<00:03:35.780> go<00:03:35.870> so<00:03:36.350> that's<00:03:36.530> basically<00:03:36.680> the

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
there we go so that's basically the

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.160 
there we go so that's basically the
setup<00:03:37.850> that<00:03:38.060> goes<00:03:38.450> head<00:03:38.660> and<00:03:38.810> pushes<00:03:38.959> the

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
setup that goes head and pushes the

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:40.479 
setup that goes head and pushes the
block<00:03:39.380> forward<00:03:39.709> that<00:03:39.920> the<00:03:40.070> one<00:03:40.220> that<00:03:40.370> it

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:40.489 
block forward that the one that it

half slab here let's go ahead and place
a<00:03:59.390> slab<00:03:59.720> there<00:04:00.100> and<00:04:01.209> that<00:04:02.209> should<00:04:02.420> be<00:04:02.510> good

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630 
a slab there and that should be good

but yeah so you can have a very very
clean<00:04:40.410> design<00:04:40.740> like<00:04:40.950> this<00:04:41.070> we<00:04:41.250> just<00:04:41.460> kind<00:04:41.640> of

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:41.670 
clean design like this we just kind of

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:44.000 
clean design like this we just kind of
winged<00:04:41.910> it<00:04:42.030> and<00:04:42.120> figure<00:04:42.450> that<00:04:42.630> out<00:04:42.660> I<00:04:43.050> would

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.010 
winged it and figure that out I would

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:45.200 
winged it and figure that out I would
show<00:04:44.220> you<00:04:44.250> what<00:04:44.490> happens<00:04:44.820> with<00:04:45.000> the<00:04:45.060> red

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
show you what happens with the red

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:46.670 
show you what happens with the red
mushroom<00:04:45.600> it<00:04:45.720> doesn't<00:04:45.960> always<00:04:46.080> happen<00:04:46.320> but<00:04:46.620> it

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:46.680 
mushroom it doesn't always happen but it

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.050 
mushroom it doesn't always happen but it
happens<00:04:46.950> most<00:04:47.190> of<00:04:47.280> the<00:04:47.370> time<00:04:47.550> if<00:04:47.730> you<00:04:47.820> want<00:04:47.970> to

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:48.060 
happens most of the time if you want to

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.050 
happens most of the time if you want to
do<00:04:48.210> it<00:04:48.560> go<00:04:49.560> ahead<00:04:49.770> and<00:04:49.800> save<00:04:50.280> right<00:04:50.640> before<00:04:50.970> you

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
do it go ahead and save right before you

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:53.330 
do it go ahead and save right before you
put<00:04:51.300> it<00:04:51.330> and<00:04:51.600> then<00:04:52.080> go<00:04:52.230> ahead<00:04:52.350> and<00:04:52.470> try<00:04:52.980> it<00:04:53.100> what

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:53.340 
put it and then go ahead and try it what

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.610 
put it and then go ahead and try it what
happens<00:04:53.670> with<00:04:53.850> this<00:04:54.060> is<00:04:54.330> that<00:04:54.840> they<00:04:54.960> just<00:04:55.170> grow

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
happens with this is that they just grow

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:57.020 
happens with this is that they just grow
wherever<00:04:55.920> they<00:04:56.100> want<00:04:56.280> to<00:04:56.370> grow<00:04:56.550> and<00:04:56.760> they<00:04:56.790> can

00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:57.030 
wherever they want to grow and they can

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:00.650 
wherever they want to grow and they can
consume<00:04:57.600> I<00:04:58.050> literally<00:04:58.530> eat<00:04:58.770> up<00:04:59.100> a<00:04:59.660> transparent

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:00.660 
consume I literally eat up a transparent

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.300 
consume I literally eat up a transparent
block<00:05:00.810> so<00:05:01.020> they'll<00:05:01.170> eat<00:05:01.320> the<00:05:01.470> Redstone<00:05:01.950> delete

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.310 
block so they'll eat the Redstone delete

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:03.740 
block so they'll eat the Redstone delete
this<00:05:02.580> so<00:05:02.760> basically<00:05:03.060> if<00:05:03.120> you<00:05:03.180> have<00:05:03.270> a<00:05:03.300> shorter

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
this so basically if you have a shorter

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.870 
this so basically if you have a shorter
red<00:05:03.960> mushroom<00:05:04.380> it'll<00:05:04.620> like<00:05:04.770> grow<00:05:05.370> here<00:05:05.730> and

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 
red mushroom it'll like grow here and

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.060 
red mushroom it'll like grow here and
then<00:05:05.970> take<00:05:06.000> over<00:05:06.450> these<00:05:06.570> non<00:05:07.200> solid<00:05:07.800> blocks

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:08.070 
then take over these non solid blocks

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:10.520 
then take over these non solid blocks
that<00:05:09.060> this<00:05:09.270> is<00:05:09.360> actually<00:05:09.540> sexy<00:05:10.170> look<00:05:10.320> at<00:05:10.410> that

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530 
that this is actually sexy look at that

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:12.380 
that this is actually sexy look at that
look<00:05:10.710> at<00:05:10.770> this<00:05:10.920> monstrosity<00:05:11.580> ahead<00:05:12.060> over<00:05:12.150> here

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:12.390 
look at this monstrosity ahead over here

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:15.500 
look at this monstrosity ahead over here
just<00:05:12.510> just<00:05:12.960> cuz<00:05:13.110> I<00:05:13.170> assumed<00:05:14.090> that<00:05:15.090> the<00:05:15.210> steps

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:15.510 
just just cuz I assumed that the steps

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:19.310 
just just cuz I assumed that the steps
were<00:05:15.690> needed<00:05:16.310> their<00:05:17.310> stinking<00:05:17.730> steps<00:05:18.320> alright

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:19.320 
were needed their stinking steps alright

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:20.810 
were needed their stinking steps alright
