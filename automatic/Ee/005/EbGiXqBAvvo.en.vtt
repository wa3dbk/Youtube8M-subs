7d<00:00:31.050> F<00:00:31.349> I<00:00:32.600> already<00:00:33.600> looked<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:34.260> there<00:00:34.410> should

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
7d F I already looked and there should

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:38.780 
7d F I already looked and there should
be<00:00:34.680> about<00:00:34.920> 17<00:00:35.910> to<00:00:36.120> 20<00:00:36.630> different<00:00:37.489> screws<00:00:38.489> on

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
be about 17 to 20 different screws on

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.630 
be about 17 to 20 different screws on
the<00:00:38.940> sides<00:00:39.210> it's<00:00:39.629> three<00:00:39.840> on<00:00:39.870> each<00:00:40.140> side

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:40.640 
the sides it's three on each side

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.490 
the sides it's three on each side
there's<00:00:41.640> four<00:00:41.969> over<00:00:42.210> here<00:00:42.840> this<00:00:43.140> two<00:00:43.410> over

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
there's four over here this two over

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.180 
there's four over here this two over
here

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
here

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.220 
here
you<00:00:44.579> have<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:44.910> remember<00:00:45.149> that<00:00:45.390> it's<00:00:45.570> also<00:00:45.780> two

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
you have to remember that it's also two

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.690 
you have to remember that it's also two
over<00:00:46.649> here<00:00:47.420> inside<00:00:48.420> where<00:00:48.870> all<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.550> cables<00:00:50.550> go

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
over here inside where all the cables go

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.970 
over here inside where all the cables go
so<00:00:51.090> don't<00:00:51.719> forget<00:00:51.870> those<00:00:52.199> and<00:00:52.469> also<00:00:52.710> I'll

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
so don't forget those and also I'll

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.490 
so don't forget those and also I'll
probably<00:00:53.219> take<00:00:53.430> out<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.699> stand<00:00:54.289> screws<00:00:55.289> as

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
probably take out the stand screws as

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.560 
probably take out the stand screws as
well<00:00:55.730> from<00:00:57.530> unscrewing<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:59.149> the<00:01:00.149> screws

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
well from unscrewing the the screws

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.460 
well from unscrewing the the screws
apparently<00:01:02.210> this<00:01:03.210> screw<00:01:03.629> right<00:01:03.840> here<00:01:03.899> it's

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
apparently this screw right here it's

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.859 
apparently this screw right here it's
super<00:01:05.100> old<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:05.790> then<00:01:05.939> they<00:01:05.970> put<00:01:06.210> an<00:01:06.299> old<00:01:06.479> screw

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
super old and then they put an old screw

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.000 
super old and then they put an old screw
in<00:01:06.990> it<00:01:07.110> round<00:01:07.799> it<00:01:08.010> off<00:01:08.189> I<00:01:08.430> can't<00:01:08.729> take<00:01:08.939> it<00:01:09.060> out

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:10.010 
in it round it off I can't take it out

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.130 
in it round it off I can't take it out
so<00:01:11.010> we'll<00:01:11.610> try<00:01:11.880> to<00:01:11.939> figure<00:01:12.240> out<00:01:12.420> what<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:13.020> do

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
so we'll try to figure out what to do

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:13.580 
so we'll try to figure out what to do
next

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
next

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.580 
next
good<00:01:14.340> job<00:01:14.670> LG<00:01:15.150> I<00:01:16.549> managed<00:01:17.549> to<00:01:17.759> take<00:01:17.970> off<00:01:18.180> the

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
good job LG I managed to take off the

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:25.010 
good job LG I managed to take off the
LCD<00:01:19.590> panel<00:01:21.049> that<00:01:22.049> screw<00:01:22.380> that<00:01:22.590> was<00:01:22.770> a<00:01:24.020> screw

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
LCD panel that screw that was a screw

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.859 
LCD panel that screw that was a screw
that<00:01:25.140> was<00:01:25.259> messed<00:01:25.530> up<00:01:25.830> really<00:01:26.340> wasn't

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:26.869 
that was messed up really wasn't

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:29.330 
that was messed up really wasn't
important<00:01:27.869> II<00:01:28.140> need<00:01:28.530> to<00:01:28.650> take<00:01:28.829> it<00:01:28.950> off<00:01:29.040> here's

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
important II need to take it off here's

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.380 
important II need to take it off here's
the<00:01:29.490> TV<00:01:29.670> itself<00:01:30.829> this<00:01:31.829> was<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.159> bad<00:01:32.400> screw<00:01:33.030> I

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
the TV itself this was the bad screw I

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.020 
the TV itself this was the bad screw I
guess<00:01:33.689> it's<00:01:33.869> just<00:01:33.960> screw<00:01:34.409> for<00:01:34.650> the<00:01:34.680> stand<00:01:35.610> I

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
guess it's just screw for the stand I

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.109 
guess it's just screw for the stand I
don't<00:01:37.020> know<00:01:37.110> anyways<00:01:38.009> what<00:01:38.700> we're<00:01:38.850> checking

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
don't know anyways what we're checking

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.399 
don't know anyways what we're checking
for<00:01:39.450> is<00:01:39.920> the<00:01:40.920> capacitors<00:01:42.140> depositors<00:01:43.140> are<00:01:43.229> by

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
for is the capacitors depositors are by

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.639 
for is the capacitors depositors are by
the<00:01:43.470> mainboard<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:44.100> in<00:01:44.790> this<00:01:45.030> case<00:01:45.329> it's<00:01:45.649> over

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
the mainboard and in this case it's over

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.200 
the mainboard and in this case it's over
here<00:01:46.829> that's<00:01:47.040> what<00:01:47.189> a<00:01:47.220> capacitor<00:01:47.399> looks<00:01:48.030> like

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
here that's what a capacitor looks like

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.069 
here that's what a capacitor looks like
these<00:01:48.390> right<00:01:48.600> here<00:01:49.310> now<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.520> way<00:01:50.880> you<00:01:50.939> test<00:01:51.810> if

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
these right here now the way you test if

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.800 
these right here now the way you test if
they're<00:01:52.229> broken<00:01:52.820> they<00:01:53.820> sit<00:01:54.060> there<00:01:54.180> bubbled<00:01:54.630> up

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
they're broken they sit there bubbled up

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.959 
they're broken they sit there bubbled up
the<00:01:55.649> top<00:01:55.950> 10<00:01:56.340> will<00:01:56.670> be<00:01:56.790> flat<00:01:58.640> this<00:01:59.640> will<00:01:59.850> be

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
the top 10 will be flat this will be

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.740 
the top 10 will be flat this will be
flat<00:02:00.420> if<00:02:00.719> it<00:02:00.990> was<00:02:01.140> working<00:02:01.680> fine<00:02:02.640> and<00:02:03.390> if<00:02:03.570> not

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
flat if it was working fine and if not

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.630 
flat if it was working fine and if not
it<00:02:03.990> will<00:02:04.079> be<00:02:04.140> bubbled<00:02:04.740> up<00:02:04.860> like<00:02:05.040> a<00:02:05.070> dome<00:02:05.369> or

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
it will be bubbled up like a dome or

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.570 
it will be bubbled up like a dome or
busted<00:02:06.479> as<00:02:06.630> you<00:02:06.840> can<00:02:06.990> see<00:02:07.170> I<00:02:07.409> think<00:02:07.950> this<00:02:08.369> one

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
busted as you can see I think this one

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.740 
busted as you can see I think this one
right<00:02:08.700> here<00:02:08.910> is<00:02:09.000> busted<00:02:09.539> this<00:02:10.200> was<00:02:10.410> bust

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:11.750 
right here is busted this was bust

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.420 
right here is busted this was bust
and<00:02:12.750> I<00:02:12.780> think<00:02:13.200> even<00:02:13.500> this<00:02:13.769> one<00:02:13.950> this<00:02:14.069> one<00:02:14.220> feels

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
and I think even this one this one feels

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.000 
and I think even this one this one feels
a<00:02:14.519> little<00:02:14.640> bubbled<00:02:15.090> up<00:02:15.680> maybe<00:02:16.680> I'll<00:02:16.829> change

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
a little bubbled up maybe I'll change

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.369 
a little bubbled up maybe I'll change
them<00:02:17.189> off<00:02:17.340> I<00:02:17.640> got<00:02:18.569> a<00:02:18.599> little<00:02:18.870> ball<00:02:19.079> right<00:02:19.260> there

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:19.379 
them off I got a little ball right there

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:25.720 
them off I got a little ball right there
too<00:02:20.209> so<00:02:21.209> I<00:02:21.239> got<00:02:21.750> quite<00:02:21.989> a<00:02:22.049> few<00:02:22.290> I<00:02:22.319> got<00:02:22.470> 1<00:02:22.709> 2<00:02:23.040> 3<00:02:23.069> 4

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.520 

capacitors<00:02:26.730> that<00:02:26.760> are<00:02:26.909> busted<00:02:27.599> you<00:02:28.290> got<00:02:28.409> to

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
capacitors that are busted you got to

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.020 
capacitors that are busted you got to
change<00:02:28.709> that<00:02:28.920> thing<00:02:29.129> that<00:02:29.310> is<00:02:29.430> not<00:02:29.610> this<00:02:29.760> big

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
change that thing that is not this big

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.160 
change that thing that is not this big
one<00:02:30.209> here<00:02:30.329> I<00:02:30.690> should<00:02:31.650> check<00:02:31.980> the<00:02:32.129> fuses<00:02:32.670> but

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
one here I should check the fuses but

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.809 
one here I should check the fuses but
hopefully<00:02:34.170> this<00:02:34.349> will<00:02:34.470> fix<00:02:34.709> the<00:02:34.799> problem<00:02:34.829> now

00:02:35.809 --> 00:02:35.819 
hopefully this will fix the problem now

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.599 
hopefully this will fix the problem now
all<00:02:36.000> we<00:02:36.120> have<00:02:36.209> to<00:02:36.329> do<00:02:36.450> is<00:02:36.569> go<00:02:36.780> to<00:02:37.549> Radio<00:02:38.549> Shack

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:38.609 
all we have to do is go to Radio Shack

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:40.580 
all we have to do is go to Radio Shack
for<00:02:39.299> every<00:02:39.510> place<00:02:39.750> now<00:02:39.989> the<00:02:40.049> first<00:02:40.319> thing<00:02:40.470> you

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
for every place now the first thing you

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.000 
for every place now the first thing you
do<00:02:40.769> is<00:02:41.010> a<00:02:41.040> remove<00:02:41.970> all<00:02:42.299> the<00:02:42.659> wires<00:02:43.650> that<00:02:43.950> are

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
do is a remove all the wires that are

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.000 
do is a remove all the wires that are
connected<00:02:44.159> to<00:02:44.549> your<00:02:44.640> main<00:02:44.819> board<00:02:45.590> if<00:02:46.590> I<00:02:46.799> went

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
connected to your main board if I went

00:02:47.010 --> 00:03:00.199 
connected to your main board if I went
on<00:02:47.069> -<00:02:47.370> no<00:02:47.549> no<00:02:48.590> this<00:02:49.590> one<00:02:50.510> this<00:02:51.510> last<00:02:51.840> one<00:02:59.209> all

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
on - no no this one this last one all

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:02.830 
on - no no this one this last one all
right<00:03:00.359> now<00:03:00.629> you<00:03:00.810> are<00:03:00.930> screwed<00:03:01.440> the<00:03:01.920> main<00:03:02.129> board

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
right now you are screwed the main board

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.530 
right now you are screwed the main board
let's<00:03:03.840> go<00:03:04.109> right<00:03:04.260> there<00:03:04.530> one<00:03:05.459> right<00:03:05.489> there<00:03:06.000> one

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
let's go right there one right there one

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:08.530 
let's go right there one right there one
right<00:03:06.569> there<00:03:07.049> one<00:03:07.079> right<00:03:07.379> there

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
right there one right there

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.009 
right there one right there
I'll<00:03:09.540> see<00:03:09.750> right<00:03:10.109> so<00:03:10.349> these<00:03:10.560> are<00:03:10.829> the<00:03:10.950> busted

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019 
I'll see right so these are the busted

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:15.949 
I'll see right so these are the busted
these<00:03:13.019> are<00:03:13.200> the<00:03:13.319> busted<00:03:13.709> capacitors<00:03:14.750> now<00:03:15.750> on

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
these are the busted capacitors now on

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.650 
these are the busted capacitors now on
the<00:03:16.109> spewing<00:03:16.560> now<00:03:17.280> spilling<00:03:17.879> stuff<00:03:18.150> in<00:03:18.510> it

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
the spewing now spilling stuff in it

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:24.020 
the spewing now spilling stuff in it
this<00:03:19.230> was<00:03:19.500> a<00:03:19.530> little<00:03:19.829> bulgy<00:03:20.419> not<00:03:21.419> to<00:03:21.569> char<00:03:23.030> this

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
this was a little bulgy not to char this

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:29.300 
this was a little bulgy not to char this
one<00:03:24.239> is<00:03:24.419> spewing<00:03:24.900> -<00:03:26.000> so<00:03:27.000> is<00:03:27.180> this<00:03:27.480> one<00:03:28.220> going<00:03:29.220> to

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
one is spewing - so is this one going to

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.789 
one is spewing - so is this one going to
change<00:03:29.549> our<00:03:29.760> foot<00:03:30.030> to<00:03:30.299> remove<00:03:30.989> them<00:03:31.260> as<00:03:31.470> you

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:31.799 
change our foot to remove them as you

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:35.420 
change our foot to remove them as you
find<00:03:32.190> where<00:03:32.699> it<00:03:32.849> goes<00:03:33.090> I<00:03:33.739> hope<00:03:34.739> is<00:03:34.949> this<00:03:35.160> one

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
find where it goes I hope is this one

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.849 
find where it goes I hope is this one
and<00:03:38.629> you<00:03:39.629> just<00:03:39.660> put<00:03:39.959> the<00:03:40.049> soldering<00:03:40.440> iron<00:03:40.739> on

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:40.859 
and you just put the soldering iron on

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:43.129 
and you just put the soldering iron on
on<00:03:41.129> the<00:03:41.370> little<00:03:41.609> tip<00:03:41.790> real<00:03:42.060> quick<00:03:42.359> until<00:03:42.810> melt

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:43.139 
on the little tip real quick until melt

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:45.650 
on the little tip real quick until melt
both<00:03:44.099> sides<00:03:44.430> and<00:03:44.760> you<00:03:44.879> pull<00:03:45.120> them<00:03:45.209> off<00:03:45.359> I

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
both sides and you pull them off I

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:49.250 
both sides and you pull them off I
basically<00:03:46.440> just<00:03:46.530> melt<00:03:47.010> it<00:03:47.160> off<00:03:47.900> so<00:03:48.900> I<00:03:48.989> finally

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
basically just melt it off so I finally

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.259 
basically just melt it off so I finally
got<00:03:49.500> the<00:03:49.620> capacitors<00:03:50.280> off<00:03:50.519> there<00:03:51.030> were<00:03:51.120> these

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
got the capacitors off there were these

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:53.509 
got the capacitors off there were these
original<00:03:51.870> ones<00:03:52.019> right<00:03:52.230> the<00:03:52.949> first<00:03:53.190> one<00:03:53.400> was

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
original ones right the first one was

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:55.520 
original ones right the first one was
the<00:03:53.669> trickiest<00:03:54.060> one<00:03:54.389> because<00:03:54.780> you<00:03:55.169> learn<00:03:55.319> how

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
the trickiest one because you learn how

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.949 
the trickiest one because you learn how
much<00:03:55.829> you're<00:03:56.790> supposed<00:03:57.120> to<00:03:57.150> burn<00:03:57.449> and<00:03:57.870> how

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
much you're supposed to burn and how

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:00.170 
much you're supposed to burn and how
hard<00:03:58.230> you're<00:03:58.379> supposed<00:03:58.650> to<00:03:58.709> pull<00:03:58.919> if<00:03:59.790> I<00:03:59.879> pulled

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
hard you're supposed to pull if I pulled

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.569 
hard you're supposed to pull if I pulled
it<00:04:00.299> out<00:04:00.419> now<00:04:00.690> putting<00:04:01.079> in<00:04:01.319> the<00:04:01.739> new<00:04:01.980> ones<00:04:02.220> these

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:02.579 
it out now putting in the new ones these

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:04.670 
it out now putting in the new ones these
are<00:04:02.639> much<00:04:02.879> bigger<00:04:03.120> they<00:04:03.599> can<00:04:03.750> hack<00:04:03.930> more<00:04:04.199> more

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
are much bigger they can hack more more

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.699 
are much bigger they can hack more more
volt<00:04:04.980> so<00:04:05.310> I<00:04:05.340> should<00:04:05.609> be<00:04:05.760> safer<00:04:06.180> with<00:04:06.299> these<00:04:06.709> TV

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:07.709 
volt so I should be safer with these TV

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:09.770 
volt so I should be safer with these TV
should<00:04:07.889> last<00:04:08.040> longer<00:04:08.370> now<00:04:09.209> all<00:04:09.329> I<00:04:09.449> got<00:04:09.479> to<00:04:09.690> do

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
should last longer now all I got to do

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.129 
should last longer now all I got to do
is<00:04:09.900> put<00:04:10.109> them<00:04:10.229> on<00:04:10.349> in<00:04:10.500> the<00:04:10.650> in<00:04:10.889> the<00:04:11.280> slots<00:04:12.139> that

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:13.139 
is put them on in the in the slots that

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:15.559 
is put them on in the in the slots that
I<00:04:13.169> took<00:04:13.319> off<00:04:13.680> and<00:04:14.040> we'll<00:04:14.970> see<00:04:15.150> how<00:04:15.269> it<00:04:15.419> goes

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:15.569 
I took off and we'll see how it goes

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:16.180 
I took off and we'll see how it goes
from<00:04:15.720> there

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
from there

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.039 
from there
please<00:04:17.190> once<00:04:18.030> you<00:04:18.150> got<00:04:18.329> them<00:04:18.449> in<00:04:18.599> place<00:04:18.810> you

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
please once you got them in place you

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:20.479 
please once you got them in place you
should<00:04:19.229> bend<00:04:19.469> the<00:04:19.590> legs<00:04:19.859> so<00:04:20.130> that<00:04:20.310> they<00:04:20.430> don't

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
should bend the legs so that they don't

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.340 
should bend the legs so that they don't
fall<00:04:20.789> off<00:04:20.820> on<00:04:21.299> the<00:04:22.049> other<00:04:22.349> side

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:23.350 
fall off on the other side

grab<00:04:35.200> the<00:04:35.320> little<00:04:35.560> wire<00:04:36.010> put<00:04:36.790> it<00:04:36.880> against<00:04:37.150> the

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
grab the little wire put it against the

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:40.670 
grab the little wire put it against the
little<00:04:37.390> hole<00:04:37.720> and<00:04:38.460> burn<00:04:39.460> it<00:04:39.640> together<00:04:39.970> just

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
little hole and burn it together just

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:45.270 
little hole and burn it together just
burn<00:04:41.680> them<00:04:41.830> Asiago<00:04:42.760> so<00:04:43.330> I<00:04:43.890> put<00:04:44.890> on<00:04:45.040> the<00:04:45.160> new

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
burn them Asiago so I put on the new

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.000 
burn them Asiago so I put on the new
capacitors<00:04:45.970> i<00:04:46.320> soldered<00:04:47.320> them<00:04:47.470> on<00:04:47.710> which

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:48.010 
capacitors i soldered them on which

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:50.040 
capacitors i soldered them on which
turned<00:04:48.460> out<00:04:48.580> not<00:04:48.880> to<00:04:48.940> be<00:04:49.090> as<00:04:49.360> easy<00:04:49.630> as<00:04:49.840> they

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.050 
turned out not to be as easy as they

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:52.740 
turned out not to be as easy as they
looked<00:04:50.380> they<00:04:51.370> show<00:04:51.640> it<00:04:51.820> on<00:04:51.910> YouTube<00:04:52.480> looks

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:52.750 
looked they show it on YouTube looks

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:55.160 
looked they show it on YouTube looks
super<00:04:53.350> easy<00:04:53.500> but<00:04:53.860> I<00:04:53.890> guess<00:04:54.670> I'm<00:04:54.820> an<00:04:54.940> idiot

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:55.170 
super easy but I guess I'm an idiot

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:57.090 
super easy but I guess I'm an idiot
anyways<00:04:56.170> now<00:04:56.440> I'm<00:04:56.500> just<00:04:56.740> got<00:04:56.890> to<00:04:56.980> put

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:57.100 
anyways now I'm just got to put

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.930 
anyways now I'm just got to put
everything<00:04:57.220> back<00:04:57.550> together<00:04:57.700> and<00:04:58.300> pray<00:04:58.990> to<00:04:59.050> God

00:04:59.930 --> 00:04:59.940 
everything back together and pray to God

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:03.640 
all right um I just finished putting

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:07.250 
all right um I just finished putting
