considering I thought they'd be more to

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.469 
considering I thought they'd be more to
it<00:04:14.750> than<00:04:14.959> that<00:04:15.019> and<00:04:15.799> for<00:04:16.430> me<00:04:16.699> just<00:04:17.209> kind<00:04:17.449> of

00:04:17.469 --> 00:04:17.479 
it than that and for me just kind of

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:19.330 
it than that and for me just kind of
looking<00:04:17.690> at<00:04:17.900> it<00:04:17.930> as<00:04:18.139> a<00:04:18.169> full<00:04:18.470> package<00:04:18.979> I<00:04:19.130> do

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:19.340 
looking at it as a full package I do

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:21.789 
looking at it as a full package I do
think<00:04:19.699> the<00:04:19.820> box<00:04:20.030> art<00:04:20.389> and<00:04:20.570> the<00:04:21.440> box<00:04:21.650> is

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
think the box art and the box is

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:24.460 
think the box art and the box is
fantastic<00:04:22.520> as<00:04:22.699> again<00:04:23.630> with<00:04:23.810> Nintendo<00:04:24.199> I<00:04:24.229> do

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:24.470 
fantastic as again with Nintendo I do

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:26.080 
fantastic as again with Nintendo I do
think<00:04:24.740> that<00:04:24.800> they<00:04:24.979> put<00:04:25.370> a<00:04:25.400> lot<00:04:25.550> of<00:04:25.580> effort<00:04:25.940> into

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
think that they put a lot of effort into

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:27.760 
think that they put a lot of effort into
their<00:04:26.300> packaging<00:04:26.840> and<00:04:26.960> point<00:04:27.139> of<00:04:27.229> sale<00:04:27.260> and

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:27.770 
their packaging and point of sale and

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.570 
their packaging and point of sale and
this<00:04:28.580> is<00:04:28.729> certainly<00:04:28.880> no<00:04:29.180> exception<00:04:29.300> so<00:04:30.199> um
