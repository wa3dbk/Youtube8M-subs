00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
happen in the monsters world that are

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.440 
happen in the monsters world that are
kind<00:01:11.010> of<00:01:11.100> cool<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.520> true<00:01:11.729> to<00:01:11.850> that<00:01:11.939> property

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
sense but scaring at night is really

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.590 
sense but scaring at night is really

we sneak over to fear Tech at night

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.310 
we sneak over to fear Tech at night
they've<00:01:56.969> got<00:01:57.149> security<00:01:57.420> guards<00:01:57.780> out<00:01:57.960> and<00:01:58.200> so

they've got security guards out and so

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.870 
they've got security guards out and so
we'll<00:01:58.439> put<00:01:58.469> an<00:01:58.680> entire<00:01:58.950> stealth<00:01:59.340> system<00:01:59.729> into

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
we'll put an entire stealth system into

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.730 
we'll put an entire stealth system into
the<00:01:59.969> game<00:02:00.119> so<00:02:00.329> that<00:02:00.719> you<00:02:00.780> can<00:02:00.930> go<00:02:01.079> through<00:02:01.439> they

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
the game so that you can go through they

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.289 
the game so that you can go through they
have<00:02:01.890> perception<00:02:02.549> they<00:02:02.909> will<00:02:03.060> they<00:02:03.270> will

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
have perception they will they will

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:04.969 
have perception they will they will
apprehend<00:02:03.899> you<00:02:04.290> they'll<00:02:04.560> put<00:02:04.680> you<00:02:04.829> into

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.130 
apprehend you they'll put you into
detention<00:02:05.369> but<00:02:05.969> the<00:02:06.090> idea<00:02:06.450> behind<00:02:06.630> this<00:02:06.930> is

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
detention but the idea behind this is

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.020 
detention but the idea behind this is
that<00:02:07.170> college<00:02:07.740> hijinks<00:02:08.310> and<00:02:08.459> going<00:02:08.670> back<00:02:08.819> and

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
that college hijinks and going back and

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:10.639 
that college hijinks and going back and
forth<00:02:09.270> and<00:02:09.509> getting<00:02:09.929> I<00:02:10.140> guess<00:02:10.200> the<00:02:10.500> true

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
forth and getting I guess the true

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.580 
forth and getting I guess the true
college<00:02:10.890> experience<00:02:11.039> maybe

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
college experience maybe

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:15.280 
college experience maybe
so<00:02:13.310> the<00:02:13.670> last<00:02:13.909> one<00:02:14.209> that<00:02:14.420> we'll<00:02:14.480> go<00:02:14.659> into<00:02:14.689> is

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
so the last one that we'll go into is

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.890 
so the last one that we'll go into is
then
