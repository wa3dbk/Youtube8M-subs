with<00:03:02.390> Terry<00:03:02.599> Gilliam<00:03:02.959> I<00:03:03.049> worked<00:03:03.230> with<00:03:03.380> him

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
with Terry Gilliam I worked with him

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.199 
with Terry Gilliam I worked with him
when<00:03:03.530> I<00:03:03.920> was<00:03:04.010> just<00:03:04.430> a<00:03:04.819> wee<00:03:05.450> bit<00:03:05.480> of<00:03:05.690> a<00:03:05.840> thing

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:07.209 
when I was just a wee bit of a thing

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:15.070 
when I was just a wee bit of a thing
Tarantino<00:03:08.209> is<00:03:08.239> fantastic<00:03:09.140> and<00:03:09.380> he's<00:03:09.950> writing

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.080 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.300 

I<00:03:15.400> am<00:03:16.400> sure<00:03:16.700> eventually<00:03:17.300> I'm<00:03:17.740> not<00:03:18.740> sure<00:03:18.980> I

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
I am sure eventually I'm not sure I

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:20.920 
I am sure eventually I'm not sure I
think<00:03:19.850> I<00:03:19.940> don't<00:03:20.000> want<00:03:20.150> to<00:03:20.300> announce<00:03:20.510> what<00:03:20.810> he's

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
think I don't want to announce what he's

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:22.600 
think I don't want to announce what he's
writing<00:03:21.140> but<00:03:21.380> he's<00:03:21.500> writing<00:03:21.770> a<00:03:21.920> specific

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 
writing but he's writing a specific

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.380 
writing but he's writing a specific
genre<00:03:22.930> right<00:03:23.930> now<00:03:24.140> that<00:03:25.000> I'm<00:03:26.000> not<00:03:26.180> I<00:03:26.240> don't

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:26.390 
genre right now that I'm not I don't

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.690 
genre right now that I'm not I don't
think<00:03:26.750> I<00:03:26.990> probably<00:03:27.290> will<00:03:27.560> be<00:03:27.620> in<00:03:28.040> but<00:03:28.190> I<00:03:28.250> am

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
think I probably will be in but I am

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.330

yeah eventually for sure some sort of

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:37.720 
yeah eventually for sure some sort of
lifelong<00:03:31.820> relationship

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
endless varieties of characters but

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.780 
endless varieties of characters but

we'll see I'm digging around reading and
trying<00:03:58.790> to<00:03:58.880> decide<00:03:59.140> having<00:04:00.140> kind<00:04:00.290> of<00:04:00.410> been<00:04:00.590> out

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:03.110 
for out of it all for so long now it's

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:05.740 
for out of it all for so long now it's
such<00:04:03.230> a<00:04:03.350> I've<00:04:03.980> actually<00:04:04.760> taken<00:04:05.269> enough<00:04:05.480> time

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:05.750 
such a I've actually taken enough time

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:08.050 
such a I've actually taken enough time
off<00:04:05.959> them<00:04:06.140> like<00:04:06.350> my<00:04:06.620> hair<00:04:06.920> is<00:04:06.950> grown<00:04:07.550> longer

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
off them like my hair is grown longer

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.420 
off them like my hair is grown longer
and<00:04:08.239> it's<00:04:08.360> really<00:04:08.660> wonderful<00:04:09.410> but<00:04:10.069> it<00:04:10.160> kind<00:04:10.370> of

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
and it's really wonderful but it kind of

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:12.610 
and it's really wonderful but it kind of
makes<00:04:10.670> me<00:04:10.910> really<00:04:11.569> want<00:04:11.810> to<00:04:11.930> make<00:04:12.140> sure<00:04:12.319> I<00:04:12.350> come

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:12.620 
makes me really want to make sure I come

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:15.460 
makes me really want to make sure I come
in<00:04:13.010> with<00:04:13.370> something<00:04:13.640> that's<00:04:14.030> challenging<00:04:14.720> to

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
in with something that's challenging to

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:20.770 
in with something that's challenging to
make<00:04:15.739> it<00:04:15.890> worth<00:04:16.070> leaving<00:04:16.519> the<00:04:16.639> house

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:20.780 

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:23.950 

um<00:04:21.130> I<00:04:22.130> did<00:04:22.820> I<00:04:22.940> think<00:04:23.150> I<00:04:23.240> just<00:04:23.270> like<00:04:23.540> to<00:04:23.630> get<00:04:23.750> back

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
um I did I think I just like to get back

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.629 
um I did I think I just like to get back
to<00:04:24.020> acting<00:04:24.790> and<00:04:26.800> it's<00:04:27.800> a<00:04:27.889> nice<00:04:28.070> thing<00:04:28.370> I<00:04:28.520> have

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:28.639 
to acting and it's a nice thing I have

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:30.280 
to acting and it's a nice thing I have
two<00:04:28.820> older<00:04:28.850> children<00:04:29.360> and<00:04:29.600> one<00:04:29.720> baby<00:04:29.930> I<00:04:30.139> have

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:30.290 
two older children and one baby I have

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:32.800 
two older children and one baby I have
kind<00:04:30.500> of<00:04:30.560> a<00:04:30.620> little<00:04:30.770> window<00:04:31.190> where<00:04:31.460> I<00:04:31.760> think<00:04:32.660> I

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:32.810 
kind of a little window where I think I

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:35.530 
kind of a little window where I think I
could<00:04:32.990> allow<00:04:33.710> myself<00:04:34.250> that<00:04:34.550> the<00:04:34.880> time<00:04:35.150> without

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:35.540 
could allow myself that the time without

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:40.120 
could allow myself that the time without
the<00:04:35.960> guilt<00:04:36.290> to<00:04:37.220> get<00:04:37.550> back<00:04:37.760> to<00:04:37.910> acting<00:04:38.300> and<00:04:39.130> I'd

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:40.130 
the guilt to get back to acting and I'd

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:45.879 
the guilt to get back to acting and I'd
like<00:04:40.280> to<00:04:40.340> do<00:04:40.550> a<00:04:40.580> bit<00:04:40.730> more<00:04:40.790> acting

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:45.889 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:47.980 

I'm<00:04:46.030> thinking<00:04:47.030> about<00:04:47.270> directing<00:04:47.689> I<00:04:47.810> always

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:47.990 
I'm thinking about directing I always

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:49.809 
I'm thinking about directing I always
thought<00:04:48.169> I<00:04:48.229> was<00:04:48.439> not<00:04:48.680> visual<00:04:49.189> and<00:04:49.370> too<00:04:49.550> stupid

00:04:49.809 --> 00:04:49.819 
thought I was not visual and too stupid

00:04:49.819 --> 00:04:52.629 
thought I was not visual and too stupid
to<00:04:50.120> direct<00:04:50.419> but<00:04:50.599> then<00:04:50.780> you<00:04:51.080> know<00:04:51.229> maybe<00:04:52.159> I<00:04:52.370> was

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:52.639 
to direct but then you know maybe I was

00:04:52.639 --> 00:04:56.379 
to direct but then you know maybe I was
wrong<00:04:53.349> but<00:04:54.349> yet<00:04:55.340> producing<00:04:55.759> is<00:04:55.879> necessary

00:04:56.379 --> 00:04:56.389 
wrong but yet producing is necessary

00:04:56.389 --> 00:04:58.330 
wrong but yet producing is necessary
especially<00:04:56.840> for<00:04:57.259> women<00:04:57.349> they<00:04:57.620> should<00:04:57.650> they

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:58.340 
especially for women they should they

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:00.040 
especially for women they should they
need<00:04:58.520> to<00:04:58.610> they<00:04:58.849> need<00:04:58.879> to<00:04:59.090> develop<00:04:59.389> material

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
need to they need to develop material
