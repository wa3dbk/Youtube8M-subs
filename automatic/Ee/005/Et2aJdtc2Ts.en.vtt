00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.210
 very good and welcome to the new video 

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:05.470
 of the vic road channel today I'm going to 

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:08.080
 talk about an application that I'm 

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:09.910
 using recently in my nexus 5 and 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.560
 I think it's quite useful so I wanted to 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:14.020
 that I knew her is and I think that in a 

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:16.090
 Youtube video is the best for 

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:18.849
 be able to observe how it works and what 

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:22.370
 you a better idea than by casares the 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:26.450
 application itself is called 

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:30.710
 cover what beta screen 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:32.990
 to see if this is free and you can 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.700
 find in google play once 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:38.210
 installed what you do is 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.990
 Well, as you can see below 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.210
 our mouth 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:44.030
 even though 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:47.540
 possibly we change the screen of 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:50.450
 blocking putting us a few accesses to 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.040
 applications that we tell you 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:54.260
 to access each of the 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:57.290
 applications because we would simply touch 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:00.380
 and slide and masters to the right by 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:02.000
 example let's open instagram 

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.220
 we can 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.390
 see what we were doing 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.390
 previously the application 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:12.180
 I'm recording with the iPhone 5 or 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.820
 directly enter the application 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:20.450
 doing so 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.450
 we were looking if we went out 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:29.950
 as you see 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:31.890
 and the remains appear almost equal focus 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:35.010
 as you see 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.940
 the same thing and the emails and it's the same 

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:39.200
 if we wanted to input simply 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.200
 we open and that's it 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.159
 what's more about this application 

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:47.039
 good 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.299
 the icons can be ordered simply 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:53.509
 if you want to put them higher or higher 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.509
 down you leave pressed and you give up 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:01.350
 or download you can have more and ccoo 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.909
 even if you do not fit here do what 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.520
 visual and here they fit you even more 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.420
 how many you want because 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.539
 from up here 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.810
 I do not know if you can see it 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:14.510
 you see that now it puts home then if we touch 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:17.360
 here comes a drop-down with the 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.970
 with the settings the wallpaper and 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:23.659
 the modes that we have the modes serve 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:25.610
 so that through him the location 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:27.890
 the case of being at home or when 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.510
 we are outside I realized that 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.519
 when I enter my house and I have put 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.920
 the address where I live 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:35.540
 this automatically changes me 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.280
 shortcuts me instead change me 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:40.640
 the wallpaper and applications 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:42.379
 that I have placed to use these 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.109
 applications when I 'm at home if 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:47.180
 I have since at work 

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:48.859
 use others as automatically 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.810
 change the wallpaper and the 

00:02:48.859 --> 00:02:52.639
 applications that I have put you 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.459
 I use more at work and here below 

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:57.019
 the ones that you would least use but you do 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:59.090
 automatically in the case at least 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:01.849
 from my house because he knows the address 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.200
 see that it goes by gps because it detects 

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:04.250
 when you are at home and 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:06.260
 automatically the wallpaper 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.739
 changes and put applications 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:11.690
 you use when you are at home 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:14.600
 from here we can change the background of 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:16.940
 screen giving wallpaper 

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.080
 we could change and put another 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.880
 any of those who come or 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.880
 just choose one of those that 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:24.680
 let's have us worth and entering the 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.390
 adjustments so we can choose what 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.250
 applications we want to show 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.950
 here by simply adding ruining 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.630
 add our address and the 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.820
 work direction we can also 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:38.060
 put the car mode on when 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:40.820
 detect the bluetooth of the device 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:43.340
 that we have in the car then also 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:46.670
 we have this kind of multitasking as 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:49.190
 you can see directly by touching here 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:50.660
 up I have it here because I think that 

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:52.240
 it can not be turned off and I do not 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.980
 I use 

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:55.510
 but for people who do not have the button 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.950
 of multitasking the nexus as it is 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.560
 quite useful since you can put it 

00:03:56.950 --> 00:04:02.740
 both on this side and in this and put 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.330
 the fattest access point the line 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:06.810
 you can make it more curved so that 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:08.590
 it costs you less to find and lower it 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:11.050
 find this application that is 

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:14.440
 Pretty good is free on Google Play 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:16.739
 and it's called cover what screen bloc yes 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:19.289
 I'm not wrong because I see it 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:22.470
 here is like seeing what beta spring 

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:23.580
 It's good if you liked videos and 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:26.789
 applications you find interesting 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:31.220
 comment leave me a like and sharing 

00:04:26.789 --> 00:04:31.220
 it's worth a greeting and until the next video
