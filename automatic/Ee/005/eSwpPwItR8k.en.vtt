00:00:00.286 --> 00:00:01.984
Today is world juggling day!

00:00:02.203 --> 00:00:05.060
And te first contest of "Malabarize-se" has just started!

00:00:14.298 --> 00:00:17.522
This contest is aimed at beginners in ball juggling,

00:00:17.755 --> 00:00:19.397
if you already know a lot of stuff,

00:00:19.397 --> 00:00:20.116
wait,

00:00:20.116 --> 00:00:22.237
we'll have more contests in the future!

00:00:22.721 --> 00:00:23.621
The prizes are:

00:00:23.621 --> 00:00:27.247
4 "bubble balls" donated by JR malabaris

00:00:27.492 --> 00:00:29.987
to each of the 5 winners.

00:00:31.021 --> 00:00:31.503
And also,

00:00:31.503 --> 00:00:33.403
the book "Fundamental aspects of juggling",

00:00:33.403 --> 00:00:34.697
written by Richard Santos,

00:00:34.932 --> 00:00:36.194
to the first place!

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:37.399
thank you Richard!

00:00:38.475 --> 00:00:41.053
Any person residing in Brazil can participate!

00:00:41.613 --> 00:00:42.547
Let's learn the rules!

00:00:42.985 --> 00:00:45.231
Make a video response containing two things:

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.583
Your name and a quick explanation of

00:00:47.583 --> 00:00:49.504
why you want to win the contest

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:51.518
the tricks with 3 objects

00:00:51.518 --> 00:00:53.526
you learned in malabarize-se until now.

00:00:53.886 --> 00:00:56.529
you need to make at least 3 tricks

00:00:56.529 --> 00:00:58.054
of the tutorials that we already have,

00:00:58.694 --> 00:01:00.892
if you know other things that aren't in the tutorials,

00:01:00.892 --> 00:01:02.059
there's no problem,

00:01:02.294 --> 00:01:02.970
you can send it,

00:01:03.276 --> 00:01:05.413
but remember that the contest is just for beginners!

00:01:05.928 --> 00:01:07.224
There is no use on sending backcrosses

00:01:07.224 --> 00:01:09.407
or crazy bodythrows while doing top-of-head stall

00:01:09.407 --> 00:01:10.657
that ... it won't happen!

00:01:11.923 --> 00:01:12.561
For example

00:01:12.561 --> 00:01:14.607
If you make a sequence with cascade,

00:01:14.607 --> 00:01:16.412
tennis and half shower, done!

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:19.664
another one with com mills mess,

00:01:19.664 --> 00:01:21.894
windmill, 441 and 423,

00:01:21.894 --> 00:01:22.957
also applies!

00:01:25.855 --> 00:01:28.152
Of course, some tricks are worth more points than others,

00:01:28.414 --> 00:01:29.428
because they are more difficult!

00:01:29.787 --> 00:01:30.755
In any case,

00:01:30.755 --> 00:01:32.553
we'll evaluate the total composition!

00:01:32.861 --> 00:01:35.560
Your video can be cut between the two parts.

00:01:35.763 --> 00:01:38.325
But you can't cut the part of the tricks,

00:01:38.325 --> 00:01:40.146
because drops deduct points.

00:01:41.252 --> 00:01:42.252
In a quick example,

00:01:42.252 --> 00:01:42.879
It'd be like that:

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.296
Hi, my name is Lucas,

00:01:44.296 --> 00:01:46.124
I started to practice juggling yesterday,

00:01:46.124 --> 00:01:49.261
and this is my entry in the contest of "Malabarize-se"

00:01:49.664 --> 00:01:52.768
I want to win because of that, that and that

00:01:53.115 --> 00:01:54.173
and this is my sequence!

00:02:00.103 --> 00:02:01.112
me and two judges

00:02:01.112 --> 00:02:02.552
will choose the winners

00:02:02.552 --> 00:02:04.344
taking into account three criteria:

00:02:04.936 --> 00:02:06.479
technical skill

00:02:06.993 --> 00:02:08.292
creativity

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:10.553
and Potential for development

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.483
At the moment of recording pay attention at some things:

00:02:13.953 --> 00:02:15.823
we need to hear what you say.

00:02:16.044 --> 00:02:18.152
Don't speak too low!

00:02:18.931 --> 00:02:20.229
fit your entire body to the screen,

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:22.519
we must see your posture while you juggle!

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:23.531
Also, 

00:02:23.794 --> 00:02:26.184
frame in a way that the balls don't leave the screen.

00:02:26.524 --> 00:02:28.412
Your video should be up to one minute and a half

00:02:28.412 --> 00:02:29.927
and you have until June 30 

00:02:29.927 --> 00:02:31.146
to send your submission.

00:02:31.423 --> 00:02:33.452
read the complete rules here in the description

00:02:33.703 --> 00:02:35.575
Watch the video again if you need it

00:02:35.575 --> 00:02:36.730
pay attention to the rules.

00:02:37.045 --> 00:02:38.180
"Thumbs up" the video!

00:02:38.526 --> 00:02:39.566
If you have further questions,

00:02:39.566 --> 00:02:40.665
ask in the comments!

00:02:40.665 --> 00:02:41.519
there's no problem on asking!

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:42.767
Good luck

00:02:42.767 --> 00:02:43.935
and I'll see you soon!
