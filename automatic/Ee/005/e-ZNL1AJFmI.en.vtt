00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.480
 6 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:47.120
 to enjoy my mare speed this is a 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:49.690
 Dutch mare 9 years old I ride 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.800
 for a year and a half and I love 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.230
 physically she is a very pretty mare 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.550
 very athletic and the neckline one 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.680
 could describe a bit like that of a 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:09.860
 whole with a lot of energy and a 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:11.450
 very sweet look very good look I 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.190
 think I bring him some 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.660
 rigor because it's true she's 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.580
 a little hesitant that it needs 

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.200
 tell us where to go what to do 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.750
 and she will do it she is very applied 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.940
 very good student but he needs a guide 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.500
 and the celery of all riders 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.470
 it's really what this mare has 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:30.410
 need authority leadership without being 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.500
 aggressive it for idy where to go and what the 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:32.500
 made 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.990
 at the stables she is always very calm 

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.640
 and very 12 always in its place it's not going 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.590
 never make a mistake or invade my 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.780
 space I feel like they love me 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.659
 well in any case the metal r I think 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.790
 let me know if he is so we 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:03.210
 was bothering him and if he could 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:03.210
 support 

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:32.780
 my favorite thing about mc is 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.999
 how loving she is 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.170
 it's nice every day all 

00:02:34.999 --> 00:02:37.969
 always in a good mood always 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:41.900
 happy to see us always happy 

00:02:37.969 --> 00:02:44.989
 to be in contact with people at 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.329
 stables of two spheres manipulate themselves 

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:49.159
 brush to go with lÃ© deals 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:51.469
 of her then constantly on the other hand from 

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:53.799
 we put the temperament and exchange 

00:02:51.469 --> 00:02:55.750
 to do more nervous more aggressive 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:58.129
 this is where you need to 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.019
 towards the rise and channel this 

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:02.980
 energy to put it in the right 

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:06.169
 direction to calm her I'm trying to be 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.519
 the most 12 possible with her then of 

00:03:06.169 --> 00:03:10.459
 do a lot of exercise where she can 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:12.199
 to relax relax like the hand 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:13.909
 wanting to lead outdoors in the forest 

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:15.370
 gallop allow him to 

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:17.599
 change the ideas and not the 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.870
 to lock him up in a daily work 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:24.010
 who is always forbidding who could 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.010
 make her tense for a long time 

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:33.000
 Yes 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.040
 so it's true we have this code 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.440
 particular that I'm trying to have with 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.270
 but the other horses who is a coach 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.380
 vocal or when I do some are 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:41.730
 she'll understand that right away he 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.560
 must advance on the contrary it will take 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:46.530
 lanthier when I want her 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.360
 slow down I make a lighter that I 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.190
 learned two Swedish groups 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.720
 the Swedes do a lot this day of his 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:53.730
 but I find that horses 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.900
 understand pretty quickly what that 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.880
 mean there is now I have not even 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.320
 need to shorten but reindeer 2 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.630
 meters back I only need 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:01.860
 of characters are with my voice is all of 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.920
 later she slows down she understands very 

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:03.920
 well 

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:25.470
 this is the speed mare by 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.810
 excellence because she does not have 

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.280
 necessarily the strength and power that 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.830
 can have a big horse a little bit more 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:34.920
 heavy but here is the lightness and the 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:37.050
 speed and she painted at the door 

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:38.190
 downstream compensated by this speed that is going 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:45.660
 allow him to go to the other side and 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:49.010
 to decide I believe that my 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:52.200
 riding is pretty classic female 

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:55.650
 I like to be discreet and to be in harmony 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:58.020
 with my horses it's the most 

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:01.919
 possible communication union between 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:03.480
 we without having to be aggressive oit a 

00:05:01.919 --> 00:05:06.740
 mounted in forge trying to climb into 

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:09.180
 lightness and suspensions 

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:10.950
 in gallop because I have a lot 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.250
 learned by spending two years in the states 

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:12.930
 United 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:15.930
 have a riding always in the 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:18.740
 movement and always with my cat 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.740
 never against you
