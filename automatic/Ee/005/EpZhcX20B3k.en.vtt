00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:53.800 
to a couple of people who were full of

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.890 
to a couple of people who were full of
such<00:06:54.039> hate<00:06:54.340> but<00:06:54.970> their<00:06:55.270> own<00:06:55.449> arrogance

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:55.900 
such hate but their own arrogance

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:57.270
