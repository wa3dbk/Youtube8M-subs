00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:20.990 

and<00:01:13.530> then<00:01:13.740> we're<00:01:14.460> going<00:01:14.610> to<00:01:14.670> do<00:01:16.340> EBG<00:01:17.689> ebgp<00:01:20.000> so

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
and then we're going to do EBG ebgp so

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.120 
and then we're going to do EBG ebgp so
and<00:01:21.240> then<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.659> part<00:01:21.930> of<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.110> sea<00:01:22.439> it'll<00:01:22.979> sound

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
and then the part of the sea it'll sound

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.830 
and then the part of the sea it'll sound
like<00:01:23.280> this
