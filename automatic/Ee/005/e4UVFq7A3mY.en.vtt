00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:07.360 
alright guys this is my first part of

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:08.850 
alright guys this is my first part of
the<00:00:07.450> tutorial<00:00:07.540> I'll<00:00:08.050> just<00:00:08.170> go<00:00:08.290> over<00:00:08.320> a<00:00:08.620> quick

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:08.860 
the tutorial I'll just go over a quick

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:10.709 
the tutorial I'll just go over a quick
overview<00:00:09.250> over<00:00:09.700> what<00:00:09.910> quick<00:00:10.150> switching<00:00:10.450> is

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:10.719 
overview over what quick switching is

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:13.440 
overview over what quick switching is
I'm<00:00:11.500> sure<00:00:11.850> many<00:00:12.850> of<00:00:13.000> you<00:00:13.150> already<00:00:13.300> know

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:13.450 
I'm sure many of you already know

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:15.930 
I'm sure many of you already know
already<00:00:13.810> but<00:00:14.740> so<00:00:15.160> you<00:00:15.250> can<00:00:15.400> just<00:00:15.519> go<00:00:15.640> ahead<00:00:15.760> and

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:15.940 
already but so you can just go ahead and

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:17.580 
already but so you can just go ahead and
skip<00:00:16.119> this<00:00:16.180> part<00:00:16.510> and<00:00:16.689> go<00:00:16.869> on<00:00:17.020> to<00:00:17.140> the<00:00:17.230> next<00:00:17.320> one

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:17.590 
skip this part and go on to the next one

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:20.490 
skip this part and go on to the next one
but<00:00:18.550> basically<00:00:18.820> quick<00:00:19.270> switching<00:00:19.510> is<00:00:19.750> is<00:00:19.990> when

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:20.500 
but basically quick switching is is when

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.350 
but basically quick switching is is when
you<00:00:20.650> have<00:00:20.680> your<00:00:21.100> weapon<00:00:21.400> out<00:00:21.490> and<00:00:22.119> you<00:00:22.210> take

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:22.360 
you have your weapon out and you take

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:23.880 
you have your weapon out and you take
something<00:00:22.810> else<00:00:22.869> out<00:00:23.110> and<00:00:23.320> then<00:00:23.410> you<00:00:23.530> go<00:00:23.740> back

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:23.890 
something else out and then you go back

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:25.710 
something else out and then you go back
to<00:00:24.039> the<00:00:24.130> same<00:00:24.310> weapon<00:00:24.460> that<00:00:24.610> before<00:00:25.029> except

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:25.720 
to the same weapon that before except

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.550 
to the same weapon that before except
you<00:00:25.779> do<00:00:25.869> it<00:00:25.990> fast<00:00:26.199> like<00:00:26.320> this<00:00:26.590> and<00:00:28.260> what<00:00:29.260> it<00:00:29.380> is

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:29.560 
you do it fast like this and what it is

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.859 
you do it fast like this and what it is
used<00:00:29.830> for<00:00:29.920> is<00:00:30.369> let's<00:00:31.119> say<00:00:31.300> you're<00:00:31.420> all<00:00:31.600> paying

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:31.869 
used for is let's say you're all paying

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:33.990 
used for is let's say you're all paying
your<00:00:32.169> scoped<00:00:32.529> in<00:00:32.680> and<00:00:33.070> you'll<00:00:33.190> go<00:00:33.370> you<00:00:33.790> want<00:00:33.940> to

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:34.000 
your scoped in and you'll go you want to

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.790 
your scoped in and you'll go you want to
go<00:00:34.090> get<00:00:34.390> out<00:00:34.540> of<00:00:34.660> your<00:00:34.750> scope<00:00:34.989> instead<00:00:35.710> of

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800 
go get out of your scope instead of

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.920 
go get out of your scope instead of
zooming<00:00:36.040> in<00:00:36.309> again<00:00:36.580> and<00:00:36.790> clicking<00:00:37.360> again<00:00:37.570> that

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:37.930 
zooming in again and clicking again that

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.110 
zooming in again and clicking again that
takes<00:00:38.140> ages<00:00:38.350> like<00:00:38.730> there's<00:00:39.730> only<00:00:39.910> you're

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:40.120 
takes ages like there's only you're

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.299 
takes ages like there's only you're
going<00:00:40.210> to<00:00:40.329> be<00:00:40.420> doing<00:00:40.510> that<00:00:40.720> you<00:00:41.649> zoom<00:00:41.920> in<00:00:42.070> and

00:00:42.299 --> 00:00:42.309 
going to be doing that you zoom in and

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:44.760 
going to be doing that you zoom in and
then<00:00:42.430> you<00:00:42.520> quick<00:00:42.730> switch<00:00:42.940> and<00:00:43.719> that's<00:00:43.870> it<00:00:44.110> you

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:44.770 
then you quick switch and that's it you

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:47.490 
then you quick switch and that's it you
zoom<00:00:44.920> in<00:00:45.070> quick<00:00:45.340> switch<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:47.050> that<00:00:47.170> just<00:00:47.320> takes

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:47.500 
zoom in quick switch and that just takes

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:48.810 
zoom in quick switch and that just takes
you<00:00:47.590> out<00:00:47.680> you<00:00:47.829> scope<00:00:48.160> so<00:00:48.370> you<00:00:48.489> can<00:00:48.610> go<00:00:48.700> ahead

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:48.820 
you out you scope so you can go ahead

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:57.119 
you out you scope so you can go ahead
this<00:00:49.480> quick<00:00:50.050> switch<00:00:50.320> here<00:00:54.210> anyways<00:00:55.829> my<00:00:56.829> second

00:00:57.119 --> 00:00:57.129 
this quick switch here anyways my second

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:01.290 
this quick switch here anyways my second
part<00:00:57.340> I<00:00:57.489> will<00:00:57.879> be<00:00:58.030> explaining<00:00:58.510> why<00:01:00.000> my<00:01:01.000> method

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.300 
part I will be explaining why my method

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.140 
part I will be explaining why my method
is<00:01:01.420> so<00:01:01.539> fish

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:03.150 
is so fish

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.460 
is so fish
alright<00:01:04.150> guys<00:01:04.269> this<00:01:04.479> is<00:01:04.629> my<00:01:04.750> second<00:01:05.110> part<00:01:05.229> of

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.470 
alright guys this is my second part of

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:08.010 
alright guys this is my second part of
my<00:01:05.860> tutorial<00:01:06.820> where<00:01:07.330> I'll<00:01:07.420> be<00:01:07.540> explaining<00:01:07.870> my

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
my tutorial where I'll be explaining my

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:09.360 
my tutorial where I'll be explaining my
method<00:01:08.320> of<00:01:08.409> quick<00:01:08.590> switching<00:01:08.830> and<00:01:09.040> why<00:01:09.159> it<00:01:09.220> is

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:09.370 
method of quick switching and why it is

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:10.649 
method of quick switching and why it is
more<00:01:09.640> efficient<00:01:10.060> than<00:01:10.120> all<00:01:10.390> the<00:01:10.510> other

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:10.659 
more efficient than all the other

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:11.300 
more efficient than all the other
methods

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
methods

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.540 
methods
so<00:01:12.310> usually<00:01:14.280> Boop

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:15.550 
so usually Boop

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:17.040 
so usually Boop
the<00:01:15.850> most<00:01:16.060> common<00:01:16.330> way<00:01:16.420> of<00:01:16.450> quick<00:01:16.690> switching

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:17.050 
the most common way of quick switching

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.499 
the most common way of quick switching
is<00:01:17.200> double<00:01:17.770> tapping<00:01:17.950> the<00:01:18.190> key<00:01:18.400> which<00:01:19.210> you<00:01:19.240> have

00:01:19.499 --> 00:01:19.509 
is double tapping the key which you have

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:22.650 
is double tapping the key which you have
set<00:01:19.840> the<00:01:20.110> the<00:01:21.070> key<00:01:21.310> which<00:01:21.550> is<00:01:21.820> last<00:01:22.390> weapon

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:22.660 
set the the key which is last weapon

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.020 
set the the key which is last weapon
used<00:01:22.990> the<00:01:23.350> default<00:01:23.740> being<00:01:23.890> Q<00:01:24.220> so<00:01:24.729> you'll<00:01:24.880> be

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
used the default being Q so you'll be

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.080 
used the default being Q so you'll be
zoomed<00:01:25.270> in<00:01:25.420> and<00:01:25.630> then<00:01:25.750> DoubleTap<00:01:26.020> cute<00:01:26.380> switch

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
zoomed in and then DoubleTap cute switch

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.160 
zoomed in and then DoubleTap cute switch
however<00:01:28.090> if<00:01:28.180> you're<00:01:28.330> like<00:01:28.450> me<00:01:28.630> your<00:01:28.810> left<00:01:28.960> ring

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
however if you're like me your left ring

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:30.600 
however if you're like me your left ring
finger<00:01:29.229> is<00:01:29.530> really<00:01:29.710> not<00:01:29.890> that<00:01:29.950> strong<00:01:30.340> and

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
finger is really not that strong and

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.280 
finger is really not that strong and
there's<00:01:31.150> a<00:01:31.240> lot<00:01:31.420> of<00:01:31.540> room<00:01:31.690> for<00:01:31.869> error

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:32.290 
there's a lot of room for error

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.230 
there's a lot of room for error
and<00:01:32.380> there's<00:01:32.770> also<00:01:32.950> quite<00:01:33.460> slow<00:01:33.729> compared<00:01:34.090> to

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
and there's also quite slow compared to

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.070 
and there's also quite slow compared to
the<00:01:34.360> others<00:01:34.600> I<00:01:34.780> mean<00:01:36.479> it<00:01:37.479> really<00:01:37.720> is<00:01:37.840> not<00:01:37.990> that

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 
the others I mean it really is not that

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.350 
the others I mean it really is not that
fast

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
fast

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.380 
fast
so<00:01:40.360> other<00:01:41.080> methods<00:01:41.680> include<00:01:42.060> pressing<00:01:43.060> three

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
so other methods include pressing three

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.690 
so other methods include pressing three
and<00:01:43.570> then<00:01:43.690> one<00:01:43.899> I<00:01:44.110> mean<00:01:45.070> if<00:01:45.190> you<00:01:45.280> can<00:01:45.399> do<00:01:45.490> really

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
and then one I mean if you can do really

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:46.290 
and then one I mean if you can do really
fast

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:46.300 
fast

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:48.749 
fast
it<00:01:46.690> is<00:01:47.229> as<00:01:47.590> fast<00:01:47.830> as<00:01:48.009> you<00:01:48.130> can<00:01:48.310> quick<00:01:48.640> switch

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:48.759 
it is as fast as you can quick switch

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:52.260 
it is as fast as you can quick switch
pretty<00:01:49.090> much<00:01:49.920> there's<00:01:50.920> however<00:01:51.880> there's<00:01:52.180> a

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 
pretty much there's however there's a

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.210 
pretty much there's however there's a
lot<00:01:52.420> of<00:01:52.539> room<00:01:52.690> for<00:01:52.720> error<00:01:52.869> as<00:01:53.200> well<00:01:53.410> if<00:01:53.649> you<00:01:53.950> end

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 
lot of room for error as well if you end

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.880 
lot of room for error as well if you end
up<00:01:54.520> miss<00:01:54.729> tapping<00:01:55.119> on<00:01:55.840> three<00:01:56.229> two<00:01:56.440> instead<00:01:56.830> of

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:56.890 
up miss tapping on three two instead of

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:02.130 
up miss tapping on three two instead of
three<00:01:56.979> one<00:01:57.310> or<00:01:57.550> you<00:01:58.509> know<00:01:59.490> so<00:02:00.929> the<00:02:01.929> next

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.140 
three one or you know so the next

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.010 
three one or you know so the next
another<00:02:02.560> method<00:02:02.950> would<00:02:03.070> be<00:02:03.130> binding<00:02:04.020> last

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
another method would be binding last

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:07.800 
another method would be binding last
weapon<00:02:05.380> used<00:02:05.619> to<00:02:05.830> one<00:02:06.220> of<00:02:06.310> your<00:02:06.429> mouse<00:02:06.610> keys<00:02:06.910> to

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:07.810 
weapon used to one of your mouse keys to

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.089 
weapon used to one of your mouse keys to
one<00:02:07.959> of<00:02:08.080> your<00:02:08.140> thumb<00:02:08.380> buttons<00:02:08.649> on<00:02:08.800> your<00:02:08.950> mouse

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:09.099 
one of your thumb buttons on your mouse

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:13.110 
one of your thumb buttons on your mouse
so<00:02:10.030> I<00:02:10.060> mean<00:02:10.509> most<00:02:11.319> of<00:02:11.500> us<00:02:11.650> most<00:02:12.340> of<00:02:12.490> our<00:02:12.640> thumbs

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
so I mean most of us most of our thumbs

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.150 
so I mean most of us most of our thumbs
are<00:02:13.330> really<00:02:13.990> strong<00:02:14.260> so<00:02:14.470> you<00:02:14.500> can<00:02:14.680> just<00:02:14.800> zoom

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
are really strong so you can just zoom

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.640 
are really strong so you can just zoom
in<00:02:15.310> double<00:02:15.580> tap<00:02:15.730> with<00:02:15.970> your<00:02:16.480> thumb<00:02:16.690> and<00:02:16.959> it<00:02:17.560> is

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
in double tap with your thumb and it is

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.370 
in double tap with your thumb and it is
really<00:02:18.069> fast<00:02:18.280> however<00:02:18.970> this<00:02:19.450> also<00:02:19.660> has<00:02:20.140> a<00:02:20.170> lot

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
really fast however this also has a lot

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.350 
really fast however this also has a lot
of<00:02:20.530> room<00:02:20.680> for<00:02:20.709> error<00:02:20.890> you<00:02:21.730> might<00:02:21.880> end<00:02:22.030> up<00:02:22.120> miss

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
of room for error you might end up miss

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:25.380 
of room for error you might end up miss
clicking<00:02:22.840> or<00:02:23.110> you<00:02:23.470> know<00:02:23.940> you<00:02:24.940> can<00:02:25.090> miss<00:02:25.270> the

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
clicking or you know you can miss the

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.660 
clicking or you know you can miss the
key<00:02:25.770> so<00:02:27.599> my<00:02:28.599> method<00:02:28.780> is<00:02:29.170> the<00:02:29.830> simplest<00:02:30.250> method

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
key so my method is the simplest method

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.600 
key so my method is the simplest method
level<00:02:31.239> and<00:02:31.660> it<00:02:31.870> involves<00:02:32.290> just<00:02:32.500> tapping<00:02:32.770> a<00:02:33.099> key

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
level and it involves just tapping a key

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.150 
level and it involves just tapping a key
once<00:02:33.849> mind<00:02:34.630> being<00:02:34.840> Q<00:02:35.080> so<00:02:35.380> you<00:02:35.440> have<00:02:35.650> to<00:02:35.770> when

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
once mind being Q so you have to when

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.800 
once mind being Q so you have to when
you're<00:02:36.280> zoomed<00:02:36.489> in<00:02:36.610> you<00:02:36.760> just<00:02:36.940> tap<00:02:37.120> Q<00:02:37.360> and

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
you're zoomed in you just tap Q and

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.410 
you're zoomed in you just tap Q and
that's<00:02:37.930> it<00:02:38.140> a<00:02:38.230> quick<00:02:38.440> stitch<00:02:38.620> just<00:02:38.650> for<00:02:38.950> you

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
that's it a quick stitch just for you

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.309 
that's it a quick stitch just for you
there's<00:02:40.420> no<00:02:40.599> way<00:02:40.750> you're<00:02:40.959> going<00:02:41.080> to<00:02:41.110> miss

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
there's no way you're going to miss

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:43.740 
there's no way you're going to miss
click<00:02:41.620> there's<00:02:41.950> no<00:02:42.040> way<00:02:42.670> you're<00:02:43.330> going<00:02:43.480> to<00:02:43.510> do

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
click there's no way you're going to do

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.809 
click there's no way you're going to do
it<00:02:43.870> slowly<00:02:44.140> you<00:02:44.980> do<00:02:45.099> it<00:02:45.190> as<00:02:45.370> fast<00:02:45.580> as<00:02:45.730> possible

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:45.819 
it slowly you do it as fast as possible

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:48.420 
it slowly you do it as fast as possible
and<00:02:46.330> there's<00:02:46.510> no<00:02:47.379> with<00:02:47.650> no<00:02:47.800> doubt<00:02:48.010> the<00:02:48.040> best

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
and there's no with no doubt the best

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.550 
and there's no with no doubt the best
the<00:02:49.150> most<00:02:49.360> efficient<00:02:49.900> way<00:02:50.230> of<00:02:50.260> quick

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
the most efficient way of quick

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.550 
the most efficient way of quick
switching<00:02:50.800> there<00:02:51.099> is<00:02:51.220> so<00:02:52.120> all<00:02:52.270> you<00:02:52.360> do<00:02:52.480> is<00:02:52.599> zoom

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
switching there is so all you do is zoom

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.420 
switching there is so all you do is zoom
in<00:02:53.739> Q<00:02:54.459> and<00:02:54.640> that's<00:02:54.849> it<00:02:55.060> you<00:02:55.390> you<00:02:56.020> did<00:02:56.170> it

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
in Q and that's it you you did it

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.970 
in Q and that's it you you did it
another<00:02:58.090> thing<00:02:58.750> with<00:02:58.930> my<00:02:59.050> method<00:02:59.379> is<00:02:59.500> if<00:02:59.890> you

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
another thing with my method is if you

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.520 
another thing with my method is if you
hold<00:03:00.129> down<00:03:00.220> Q<00:03:00.750> it<00:03:01.750> will<00:03:01.810> take<00:03:02.080> down<00:03:02.230> your<00:03:02.379> knife

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
hold down Q it will take down your knife

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.470 
hold down Q it will take down your knife
so<00:03:02.830> when<00:03:03.250> you're<00:03:03.340> holding<00:03:03.459> down<00:03:03.670> Q<00:03:03.940> you<00:03:04.270> can

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
so when you're holding down Q you can

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.390 
so when you're holding down Q you can
run<00:03:04.629> with<00:03:04.780> your<00:03:04.900> knife<00:03:05.050> I<00:03:05.260> mean<00:03:05.980> this<00:03:06.069> is<00:03:06.220> quite

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
run with your knife I mean this is quite

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.830 
run with your knife I mean this is quite
useful<00:03:06.610> when<00:03:07.030> you<00:03:07.209> want<00:03:07.330> to<00:03:07.360> run<00:03:07.510> the<00:03:07.629> short

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
useful when you want to run the short

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.930 
useful when you want to run the short
distance<00:03:08.230> let's<00:03:09.220> say<00:03:09.400> you<00:03:09.459> don't<00:03:09.700> want<00:03:09.879> to
