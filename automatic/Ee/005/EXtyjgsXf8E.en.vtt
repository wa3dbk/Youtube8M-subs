system on the YouTube this will

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.940 
system on the YouTube this will
basically<00:00:09.210> allow<00:00:09.570> us<00:00:10.080> to<00:00:10.230> find<00:00:10.440> the<00:00:10.530> program

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:10.950 
basically allow us to find the program

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.919 
basically allow us to find the program
that<00:00:11.160> we<00:00:11.280> need<00:00:11.550> in<00:00:11.759> order<00:00:11.969> to<00:00:12.150> download<00:00:12.420> any

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
that we need in order to download any

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.730 
that we need in order to download any
windows<00:00:13.380> programs<00:00:14.190> or<00:00:14.370> applications<00:00:15.529> so<00:00:16.529> we

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
windows programs or applications so we

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.830 
windows programs or applications so we
go<00:00:16.890> here<00:00:17.279> and<00:00:17.400> we<00:00:17.670> see<00:00:17.910> that<00:00:17.940> the<00:00:18.420> first<00:00:18.660> thing

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
that we do is type in why that's WI and

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.240 
that we do is type in why that's WI and
ye<00:00:22.890> it's<00:00:23.699> an<00:00:23.880> illuminator<00:00:24.510> that<00:00:25.500> allows<00:00:25.920> you

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250

the next steps are fairly simple it's

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.100 
the next steps are fairly simple it's
the<00:03:49.880> same<00:03:50.090> thing<00:03:50.120> you<00:03:50.420> would<00:03:50.570> do<00:03:50.660> to<00:03:50.840> install

the windows or any other operating

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:54.700 
the windows or any other operating
system<00:03:53.120> but<00:03:53.780> the<00:03:53.810> main<00:03:54.080> thing<00:03:54.110> that<00:03:54.320> you<00:03:54.530> want
