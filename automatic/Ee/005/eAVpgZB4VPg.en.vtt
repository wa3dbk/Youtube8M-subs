it with this I'm just going to use it by

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.469 
it with this I'm just going to use it by
itself<00:01:18.780> and<00:01:19.340> so<00:01:20.340> I<00:01:20.369> need<00:01:20.670> to<00:01:20.700> hit<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.030> shift

and the SG button that has that on it I

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.929 
and the SG button that has that on it I
didn't<00:01:25.619> number<00:01:25.920> this<00:01:26.040> one<00:01:26.250> I<00:01:26.280> should<00:01:26.400> I

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
didn't number this one I should I

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.990 
didn't number this one I should I
haven't<00:01:27.390> had<00:01:27.509> time<00:01:27.780> to<00:01:27.840> do<00:01:28.049> that<00:01:28.200> yet<00:01:28.439> and<00:01:29.000> then

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
haven't had time to do that yet and then

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
what real size was I'm going to explain

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.210 
what real size was I'm going to explain
the<00:01:36.570> difference<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:37.110> you<00:01:37.229> if<00:01:37.560> I<00:01:37.740> was<00:01:37.920> going<00:01:38.130> to

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
the difference to you if I was going to

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.310 
the difference to you if I was going to
do<00:01:38.310> this<00:01:38.520> just<00:01:38.939> on<00:01:39.030> paper<00:01:39.240> saver<00:01:39.659> or<00:01:39.990> regular

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
do this just on paper saver or regular

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.230 
do this just on paper saver or regular
this<00:01:43.320> would<00:01:44.009> cut<00:01:44.280> out<00:01:44.460> first<00:01:44.880> of<00:01:44.970> all<00:01:45.060> this

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
this would cut out first of all this

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.969 
this would cut out first of all this
would<00:01:45.420> be<00:01:45.509> the<00:01:45.630> regular<00:01:46.020> size<00:01:46.259> like<00:01:46.710> if<00:01:46.829> I'm

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
would be the regular size like if I'm

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.319 
would be the regular size like if I'm
doing<00:01:47.009> it<00:01:47.280> in<00:01:47.399> four<00:01:47.640> inches<00:01:47.790> this<00:01:48.060> would<00:01:48.210> be

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
doing it in four inches this would be

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.330 
doing it in four inches this would be
four<00:01:48.540> inches<00:01:48.840> when<00:01:49.560> I<00:01:49.590> cut<00:01:49.829> out<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:49.979> sweet

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
four inches when I cut out the sweet

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.620 
four inches when I cut out the sweet
girl<00:01:50.549> that<00:01:50.700> would<00:01:50.790> not<00:01:51.000> be<00:01:51.210> four<00:01:51.450> inches

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
girl that would not be four inches

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.710 
girl that would not be four inches
because<00:01:52.170> it<00:01:52.649> would<00:01:52.770> be<00:01:52.890> proportionate<00:01:53.759> to

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
because it would be proportionate to

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.300 
because it would be proportionate to
this<00:01:54.840> one<00:01:55.049> right<00:01:55.170> here<00:01:55.470> so<00:01:55.500> it<00:01:55.770> would<00:01:55.860> be<00:01:55.979> small

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
this one right here so it would be small

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.069 
this one right here so it would be small
enough<00:01:56.460> that<00:01:56.939> it<00:01:57.299> would<00:01:57.390> fit<00:01:57.630> in<00:01:57.780> here<00:01:57.810> just

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
enough that it would fit in here just

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.770 
enough that it would fit in here just
like<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.530> picture<00:01:58.860> shows<00:01:59.100> so<00:02:00.060> if<00:02:00.299> you<00:02:00.420> want<00:02:00.659> to

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
like the picture shows so if you want to

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.020 
like the picture shows so if you want to
make<00:02:01.020> it<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.200> real<00:02:01.530> size<00:02:01.860> you<00:02:02.700> need<00:02:02.850> to<00:02:02.939> hit

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
make it the real size you need to hit

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.630 
make it the real size you need to hit
the<00:02:03.149> real<00:02:03.299> size<00:02:03.540> button<00:02:03.930> and<00:02:04.369> it's<00:02:05.369> probably

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
the real size button and it's probably

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.779 
the real size button and it's probably
going<00:02:05.880> to<00:02:05.969> make<00:02:06.090> this<00:02:06.270> hardware<00:02:06.890> the<00:02:07.890> the<00:02:08.580> real

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
going to make this hardware the the real

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.699 
going to make this hardware the the real
size<00:02:09.060> but<00:02:09.360> it's<00:02:09.509> okay<00:02:09.780> as<00:02:09.869> long<00:02:10.020> as<00:02:10.080> this<00:02:10.440> sweet

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
size but it's okay as long as this sweet

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.040 
size but it's okay as long as this sweet
girl<00:02:10.860> part<00:02:11.160> is<00:02:11.280> bigger<00:02:11.540> so<00:02:12.540> that

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
girl part is bigger so that

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.800 
girl part is bigger so that
what<00:02:13.260> the<00:02:13.410> real<00:02:13.620> size<00:02:13.830> button<00:02:14.190> is<00:02:14.400> and<00:02:14.700> you<00:02:15.660> use

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
what the real size button is and you use

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:17.930 
what the real size button is and you use
it<00:02:15.930> I<00:02:16.080> use<00:02:16.260> it<00:02:16.290> a<00:02:16.440> lot<00:02:16.470> if<00:02:16.890> I'm<00:02:17.010> using<00:02:17.160> Zhu<00:02:17.640> Balu

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
it I use it a lot if I'm using Zhu Balu

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.670 
it I use it a lot if I'm using Zhu Balu
if<00:02:18.240> I<00:02:18.420> want<00:02:18.600> the<00:02:18.720> characters<00:02:19.200> to<00:02:19.230> be<00:02:19.470> bigger

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
if I want the characters to be bigger

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:21.530 
if I want the characters to be bigger
because<00:02:20.250> if<00:02:20.400> you<00:02:20.490> cut<00:02:20.670> out<00:02:20.700> the<00:02:20.820> characters<00:02:21.360> on

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
because if you cut out the characters on

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.000 
because if you cut out the characters on
Zhu<00:02:21.720> Baloo<00:02:22.020> without<00:02:22.320> hitting<00:02:22.500> real<00:02:22.800> size

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
Zhu Baloo without hitting real size

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.740 
Zhu Baloo without hitting real size
they're<00:02:23.640> going<00:02:23.790> to<00:02:23.850> be<00:02:23.940> proportionate<00:02:24.540> to<00:02:24.570> the

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
they're going to be proportionate to the

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.600 
they're going to be proportionate to the
letter<00:02:24.960> because<00:02:25.800> they're<00:02:26.010> they're<00:02:26.280> supposed

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
letter because they're they're supposed

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.070 
letter because they're they're supposed
to<00:02:26.700> go<00:02:26.820> around<00:02:26.940> a<00:02:27.180> letter<00:02:27.390> I<00:02:27.450> just<00:02:27.630> use<00:02:27.900> them

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:28.080 
to go around a letter I just use them

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.110 
to go around a letter I just use them
plain<00:02:28.680> you<00:02:28.890> can<00:02:28.920> use<00:02:29.130> them<00:02:29.250> however<00:02:29.550> you<00:02:29.760> want

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
plain you can use them however you want

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.630 
plain you can use them however you want
okay<00:02:30.690> back<00:02:31.320> to<00:02:31.350> graphically<00:02:31.920> speaking<00:02:32.160> I

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
okay back to graphically speaking I

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.090 
okay back to graphically speaking I
think<00:02:33.450> I<00:02:33.630> want<00:02:33.900> this<00:02:34.050> to<00:02:34.290> be<00:02:34.320> I'm<00:02:34.650> gonna<00:02:34.740> do<00:02:34.980> it

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
think I want this to be I'm gonna do it

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.690 
think I want this to be I'm gonna do it
say<00:02:35.280> three<00:02:35.550> inches<00:02:36.500> because<00:02:37.610> actually<00:02:38.610> imma

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
say three inches because actually imma

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.000 
say three inches because actually imma
do<00:02:38.850> three<00:02:39.090> and<00:02:39.210> a<00:02:39.240> quarter<00:02:39.420> inches<00:02:39.660> and<00:02:40.320> press

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
do three and a quarter inches and press

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.230 
do three and a quarter inches and press
cut<00:02:43.070> and<00:02:44.070> I<00:02:44.340> probably<00:02:44.580> should<00:02:44.790> have<00:02:44.820> made<00:02:44.970> sure

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
cut and I probably should have made sure

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.730 
cut and I probably should have made sure
that<00:02:45.570> this<00:02:45.720> was<00:02:45.930> the<00:02:45.960> right<00:02:46.230> one<00:02:46.380> I<00:02:46.440> didn't

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
that this was the right one I didn't

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.320 
that this was the right one I didn't
look<00:02:46.800> in<00:02:46.950> my<00:02:47.070> window<00:02:47.400> but<00:02:47.610> I'm<00:02:47.730> assuming<00:02:48.030> it's

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
look in my window but I'm assuming it's

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.750 
look in my window but I'm assuming it's
the<00:02:48.510> right<00:02:48.660> one<00:02:48.810> and<00:02:49.170> I've<00:02:50.070> never<00:02:50.250> cut<00:02:50.520> on<00:02:50.610> this

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
the right one and I've never cut on this

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.450 
the right one and I've never cut on this
patterned<00:02:51.150> paper<00:02:51.330> before<00:02:51.720> so<00:02:51.930> hopefully<00:02:52.500> it's

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
patterned paper before so hopefully it's

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.490 
patterned paper before so hopefully it's
not<00:02:53.640> too<00:02:53.700> fast<00:02:54.120> my<00:02:54.480> speeds<00:02:54.810> looking<00:02:55.170> kind<00:02:55.440> of

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
not too fast my speeds looking kind of

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.530 
not too fast my speeds looking kind of
fast<00:02:55.740> I<00:02:56.010> hope<00:02:56.190> it<00:02:56.340> doesn't<00:02:56.520> sometimes<00:02:57.300> if<00:02:57.420> your

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
fast I hope it doesn't sometimes if your

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:58.910 
fast I hope it doesn't sometimes if your
speeds<00:02:57.810> too<00:02:58.020> fast<00:02:58.200> and<00:02:58.500> you're<00:02:58.590> working<00:02:58.710> with

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
speeds too fast and you're working with

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.890 
speeds too fast and you're working with
pattern<00:02:59.190> paper<00:02:59.460> it<00:03:00.090> will<00:03:00.300> rip<00:03:00.480> it<00:03:00.630> and<00:03:00.660> then

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
pattern paper it will rip it and then

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.510 
pattern paper it will rip it and then
how<00:03:01.020> that<00:03:01.230> happened<00:03:01.560> a<00:03:01.590> lot<00:03:01.740> and<00:03:02.100> instead<00:03:02.430> of

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:02.520 
how that happened a lot and instead of

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.330 
how that happened a lot and instead of
getting<00:03:02.760> frustrated<00:03:02.790> I<00:03:03.570> just<00:03:04.170> try<00:03:04.350> to<00:03:04.410> do<00:03:05.190> it

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
getting frustrated I just try to do it

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.980 
getting frustrated I just try to do it
slower<00:03:05.610> oh<00:03:05.820> my<00:03:05.940> goodness<00:03:06.240> this<00:03:06.360> is<00:03:06.420> going<00:03:06.720> fast

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:06.990 
slower oh my goodness this is going fast

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:10.130 
slower oh my goodness this is going fast
I<00:03:07.260> hope<00:03:07.410> it<00:03:07.530> doesn't<00:03:07.800> rip<00:03:07.920> it<00:03:08.900> okay<00:03:09.900> it<00:03:09.990> doesn't

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
I hope it doesn't rip it okay it doesn't

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.640 
I hope it doesn't rip it okay it doesn't
look<00:03:10.350> like<00:03:10.500> it's<00:03:10.680> gonna<00:03:10.800> rip<00:03:11.040> it<00:03:11.990> yay<00:03:13.020> okay<00:03:13.500> now

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
look like it's gonna rip it yay okay now

lot of my 12 by 12 paper if I can do it

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:57.490 
lot of my 12 by 12 paper if I can do it
with<00:05:56.060> the<00:05:56.150> thin<00:05:56.510> half<00:05:56.720> by<00:05:56.840> 11<00:05:57.110> and<00:05:57.260> a<00:05:57.290> half<00:05:57.380> by

with the thin half by 11 and a half by
11<00:05:57.800> seems<00:05:57.980> to<00:05:58.130> be<00:05:58.280> less<00:05:58.970> expensive<00:05:59.120> and<00:05:59.900> I<00:06:00.830> have

11 seems to be less expensive and I have

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:03.970 
11 seems to be less expensive and I have
more<00:06:01.310> of<00:06:01.400> it<00:06:01.460> on<00:06:01.580> hand<00:06:01.810> so<00:06:02.810> I<00:06:02.840> just<00:06:03.320> added<00:06:03.860> that

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:03.980 
more of it on hand so I just added that

00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:06.970 
more of it on hand so I just added that
up<00:06:04.190> at<00:06:04.310> the<00:06:04.340> top<00:06:04.610> and<00:06:05.290> this<00:06:06.290> little<00:06:06.560> border

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:06.980 
up at the top and this little border

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:11.410 
up at the top and this little border
this<00:06:07.130> is<00:06:07.190> 1<00:06:07.490> in<00:06:07.610> 3/4<00:06:08.120> inches<00:06:08.600> inch<00:06:09.140> and<00:06:10.150> I<00:06:11.150> just

00:06:11.410 --> 00:06:11.420 
this is 1 in 3/4 inches inch and I just

00:06:11.420 --> 00:06:14.200 
this is 1 in 3/4 inches inch and I just
wanted<00:06:11.660> to<00:06:11.780> kind<00:06:11.990> of<00:06:12.550> put<00:06:13.550> it<00:06:13.640> on<00:06:13.760> putting<00:06:14.090> it

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:14.210 
wanted to kind of put it on putting it

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:16.510 
wanted to kind of put it on putting it
in<00:06:14.300> the<00:06:14.360> middle<00:06:14.510> and<00:06:14.840> that<00:06:14.990> way<00:06:15.230> it<00:06:15.980> acts<00:06:16.280> as<00:06:16.490> a

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:16.520 
in the middle and that way it acts as a

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:19.390 
in the middle and that way it acts as a
bridge<00:06:16.820> between<00:06:17.500> these<00:06:18.500> two<00:06:18.830> and<00:06:19.100> so<00:06:19.220> your<00:06:19.370> eye

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:19.400 
bridge between these two and so your eye

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:20.590 
bridge between these two and so your eye
kind<00:06:19.730> of<00:06:19.790> plays<00:06:19.940> tricks<00:06:20.150> on<00:06:20.330> you<00:06:20.390> and<00:06:20.540> you

00:06:20.590 --> 00:06:20.600 
kind of plays tricks on you and you

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:22.210 
kind of plays tricks on you and you
don't<00:06:20.690> really<00:06:20.900> this<00:06:21.530> looks<00:06:21.770> like<00:06:21.920> it's<00:06:22.100> a

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:22.220 
don't really this looks like it's a

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:24.220 
don't really this looks like it's a
whole<00:06:22.460> sheet<00:06:22.820> down<00:06:23.780> there<00:06:23.960> I<00:06:23.990> don't<00:06:24.080> think

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:24.230 
whole sheet down there I don't think

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:26.670 
whole sheet down there I don't think
that's<00:06:24.500> straight<00:06:24.800> let<00:06:25.040> me<00:06:25.100> try<00:06:25.280> this<00:06:25.340> again<00:06:25.670> ah

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:26.680 
that's straight let me try this again ah

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:29.130 
that's straight let me try this again ah
I'm<00:06:27.680> just<00:06:27.740> having<00:06:28.070> one<00:06:28.100> of<00:06:28.220> those<00:06:28.340> moments

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:29.140 
I'm just having one of those moments

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:31.080 
I'm just having one of those moments

maker that works well too if you can fit
it<00:06:48.620> in<00:06:48.740> there<00:06:48.950> it'll<00:06:49.370> work<00:06:49.610> and<00:06:49.970> I<00:06:50.450> put<00:06:50.630> it<00:06:50.720> up

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:50.840

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:54.160 
it in there it'll work and I put it up
there<00:06:51.050> and<00:06:51.290> then<00:06:52.010> here's<00:06:52.250> my<00:06:52.430> cherry<00:06:53.110> that<00:06:54.110> I

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:54.170 
there and then here's my cherry that I

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:55.900 
there and then here's my cherry that I
just<00:06:54.440> made<00:06:54.620> my<00:06:55.070> set<00:06:55.250> of<00:06:55.340> cherries<00:06:55.640> I<00:06:55.730> made<00:06:55.880> a

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:55.910 
just made my set of cherries I made a

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:58.540 
just made my set of cherries I made a
few<00:06:56.450> seconds<00:06:56.870> ago<00:06:56.960> a<00:06:57.080> few<00:06:57.290> minutes<00:06:57.560> ago<00:06:57.770> and<00:06:58.040> I

00:06:58.540 --> 00:06:58.550 
few seconds ago a few minutes ago and I

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:00.940 
few seconds ago a few minutes ago and I
just<00:06:58.580> used<00:06:58.940> dimensionals<00:06:59.720> to<00:07:00.200> pop<00:07:00.380> it<00:07:00.500> up<00:07:00.620> so

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:00.950 
just used dimensionals to pop it up so

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:03.160 
just used dimensionals to pop it up so
here's<00:07:01.160> my<00:07:01.310> completed<00:07:01.490> page<00:07:01.970> now<00:07:02.720> if<00:07:02.840> I<00:07:02.990> was

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:03.170 
here's my completed page now if I was

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:04.900 
here's my completed page now if I was
going<00:07:03.410> to<00:07:03.530> use<00:07:03.710> this<00:07:03.890> I<00:07:04.070> probably<00:07:04.310> will<00:07:04.610> do

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:04.910 
going to use this I probably will do

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:05.670 
going to use this I probably will do
this<00:07:05.060> as<00:07:05.210> a<00:07:05.240> toupee

00:07:05.670 --> 00:07:05.680 
this as a toupee

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:08.370 
this as a toupee
layout<00:07:05.949> I<00:07:06.310> would<00:07:07.270> do<00:07:07.419> the<00:07:07.539> exact<00:07:07.870> same<00:07:08.080> thing

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:08.380 
layout I would do the exact same thing

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:10.409 
layout I would do the exact same thing
and<00:07:08.590> I<00:07:08.710> would<00:07:08.770> probably<00:07:09.100> I'm<00:07:09.699> just<00:07:10.180> going<00:07:10.360> to

00:07:10.409 --> 00:07:10.419 
and I would probably I'm just going to

00:07:10.419 --> 00:07:11.939 
and I would probably I'm just going to
reverse<00:07:10.780> it<00:07:11.110> when<00:07:11.320> I<00:07:11.350> actually<00:07:11.560> put<00:07:11.919> it

00:07:11.939 --> 00:07:11.949 
reverse it when I actually put it

00:07:11.949 --> 00:07:14.189 
reverse it when I actually put it
together<00:07:12.270> so<00:07:13.270> this<00:07:13.419> is<00:07:13.479> what<00:07:13.690> my<00:07:13.780> layout<00:07:14.080> would

00:07:14.189 --> 00:07:14.199 
together so this is what my layout would

00:07:14.199 --> 00:07:15.659 
together so this is what my layout would
look<00:07:14.380> like<00:07:14.560> and<00:07:14.889> I'd<00:07:15.160> have<00:07:15.340> different

00:07:15.659 --> 00:07:15.669 
look like and I'd have different

00:07:15.669 --> 00:07:17.460 
look like and I'd have different
pictures<00:07:16.360> and<00:07:16.539> then<00:07:16.630> I'd<00:07:16.720> have<00:07:16.870> my<00:07:17.020> journaling

00:07:17.460 --> 00:07:17.470 
pictures and then I'd have my journaling

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:18.659 
pictures and then I'd have my journaling
over<00:07:17.889> here<00:07:18.039> in<00:07:18.130> the<00:07:18.220> bottom<00:07:18.370> or<00:07:18.639> something

00:07:18.659 --> 00:07:18.669 
over here in the bottom or something

00:07:18.669 --> 00:07:21.180 
over here in the bottom or something
like<00:07:19.090> that<00:07:19.150> so<00:07:20.020> it's<00:07:20.440> really<00:07:20.620> easy<00:07:20.740> to<00:07:20.979> make<00:07:21.070> a

00:07:21.180 --> 00:07:21.190 
like that so it's really easy to make a
