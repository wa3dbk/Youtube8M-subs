letters wat I mean what are they they're

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.860 
letters wat I mean what are they they're
pretty<00:00:35.250> much<00:00:35.370> just<00:00:35.670> as<00:00:35.880> little<00:00:36.329> organization

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
pretty much just as little organization

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.740 
pretty much just as little organization
on<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.500> internet<00:00:37.890> that<00:00:38.219> does<00:00:38.940> DDoS<00:00:39.360> attacks

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
on the internet that does DDoS attacks

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.150 
on the internet that does DDoS attacks
which<00:00:40.050> pretty<00:00:40.290> much<00:00:40.379> is<00:00:40.680> like<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:40.980> lowest

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
which pretty much is like the lowest

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.639 
which pretty much is like the lowest
form<00:00:41.550> of<00:00:41.670> hacking<00:00:42.149> where<00:00:42.780> it's<00:00:43.260> pretty<00:00:43.559> much

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
form of hacking where it's pretty much

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.470 
form of hacking where it's pretty much
shut<00:00:43.920> down<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.219> server<00:00:44.489> simple<00:00:45.090> is<00:00:45.180> that<00:00:45.329> they

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
shut down the server simple is that they

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.720 
shut down the server simple is that they
just<00:00:45.629> send<00:00:45.809> out<00:00:45.960> so<00:00:46.230> much<00:00:46.440> signals<00:00:47.219> going<00:00:47.489> to

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
just send out so much signals going to

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.299 
just send out so much signals going to
the<00:00:47.960> server<00:00:48.960> at<00:00:49.230> once<00:00:49.500> that<00:00:49.770> the<00:00:49.890> service

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
the server at once that the service

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:51.920 
the server at once that the service
pretty<00:00:50.640> much<00:00:50.789> essentially<00:00:51.300> craps<00:00:51.570> is<00:00:51.780> the

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
pretty much essentially craps is the

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.229 
pretty much essentially craps is the
easiest<00:00:52.289> way<00:00:52.500> to<00:00:52.559> explain<00:00:52.770> it<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:53.340> they<00:00:54.030> have

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
easiest way to explain it and they have

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.330 
easiest way to explain it and they have
done<00:00:54.449> this<00:00:54.629> over<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:55.530> over<00:00:55.710> and<00:00:55.980> over<00:00:56.100> again
