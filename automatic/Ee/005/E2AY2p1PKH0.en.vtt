00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:51.569
 transportation process 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.759
 what it does not insist if we have for 

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:57.950
 fasteners books 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:02:02.630

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:06.810

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:09.750
 hard what can sunflower seeds cost

 put the trash anywhere though i wouldn't 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.150
 we just advised it all the same I 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:17.850
 I will tell the buyer more 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.690
 close the windows of the book if something is warm 

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:25.519
 put a floor 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:28.230
 I'm there or not so directly 

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:29.549
 On the site I looked was in the review was 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.980
 a lot of question does not fit 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:34.910
 hanging out not hanging out 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:40.370
 so here is our little book 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:47.379
 here it is in such a way 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:56.440
 I insert here it is 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:03:01.720
 as you see this is two hours inside 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:12.230
 here the back of the book is protection 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:13.840
 packaged looks like she doesn't 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:17.450
 say to the cells 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:23.569
 so I have a fear here 

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:27.620
 here they fall out so stupid not her 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:37.400
 insert here you see here or shaking 

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:40.720
 rather than dropping the control buttons 

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:44.980
 plugging in all connectors all in sight 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:48.139
 brightness is bad hope you browse 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:53.060
 you can actually read alone 

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:56.260
 hand like this it closes to take into account 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.260
 I do such a notebook 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:14.000
 take a risk basically i'm not happy 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:16.970
 I liked the ship still civilized 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:20.720
 surface so as not to bend soft 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:21.560
 for the fingers to keep comfortably on duty 

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:26.330
 shaking my fingers 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:31.870
 don't slip out but on a fool 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:31.870
 so keep not recommend 

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:38.180
 be sure to stick with your hand 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:40.220
 I think because due to the fact that 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:47.530
 try hanging out to low can 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:47.530
