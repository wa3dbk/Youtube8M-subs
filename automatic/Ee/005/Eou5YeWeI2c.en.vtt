they'll also I like a pan back first and
then<00:01:50.130> zoom<00:01:50.429> in<00:01:50.640> cuz<00:01:50.909> you<00:01:51.000> get<00:01:51.119> a<00:01:51.149> better<00:01:51.390> depth

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:51.719 
then zoom in cuz you get a better depth

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:57.859 
then zoom in cuz you get a better depth
of<00:01:51.869> field<00:01:52.109> view<00:01:56.179> so<00:01:57.179> as<00:01:57.329> you<00:01:57.479> can<00:01:57.569> see<00:01:57.689> that

background so you get that good depth of
field

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069

I<00:03:13.909> like<00:03:14.090> that<00:03:14.269> features<00:03:14.750> because<00:03:15.500> you'd<00:03:15.709> have

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:15.739 
I like that features because you'd have

00:03:15.739 --> 00:03:17.349 
I like that features because you'd have
to<00:03:15.950> go<00:03:16.069> through<00:03:16.250> a<00:03:16.280> lot<00:03:16.489> of<00:03:16.549> menu<00:03:16.909> screens<00:03:17.239> you

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:17.359 
to go through a lot of menu screens you

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:25.240 
to go through a lot of menu screens you
can<00:03:17.389> do<00:03:17.599> substitutions<00:03:18.409> on<00:03:18.500> the<00:03:18.620> fly<00:03:24.099> so<00:03:25.099> as

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
can do substitutions on the fly so as

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.309 
can do substitutions on the fly so as
you<00:03:25.370> can<00:03:25.489> see<00:03:25.730> the<00:03:25.970> the<00:03:26.329> game<00:03:26.569> speed<00:03:26.989> like<00:03:27.170> I

00:03:27.309 --> 00:03:27.319 
you can see the the game speed like I

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:29.920 
you can see the the game speed like I
said<00:03:27.560> I<00:03:27.590> have<00:03:27.980> mine<00:03:28.189> set<00:03:28.459> to<00:03:28.670> normal<00:03:28.930> which

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:29.930 
said I have mine set to normal which

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.470 
said I have mine set to normal which
actually<00:03:30.290> it<00:03:31.069> works<00:03:31.400> for<00:03:31.609> me<00:03:31.670> because<00:03:32.150> you<00:03:32.180> can

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
actually it works for me because you can

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.589 
actually it works for me because you can
you<00:03:33.319> can<00:03:33.500> see<00:03:33.980> holes<00:03:34.250> open<00:03:34.549> up<00:03:34.849> a<00:03:35.030> lot<00:03:35.299> easier

00:03:35.589 --> 00:03:35.599 
you can see holes open up a lot easier

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:38.920 
you can see holes open up a lot easier
now<00:03:35.840> I<00:03:36.319> think<00:03:36.980> having<00:03:37.400> it<00:03:37.639> set<00:03:37.939> too<00:03:38.150> fast<00:03:38.450> or

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
now I think having it set too fast or

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:41.890 
now I think having it set too fast or
very<00:03:38.959> fast<00:03:39.650> it<00:03:40.189> that's<00:03:41.150> fine<00:03:41.420> if<00:03:41.629> you<00:03:41.659> want<00:03:41.720> to

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
very fast it that's fine if you want to

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.689 
very fast it that's fine if you want to
play<00:03:42.019> arcade<00:03:42.470> and<00:03:42.680> I<00:03:42.769> think<00:03:43.010> it<00:03:43.190> may<00:03:43.340> be<00:03:43.400> said

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:43.699 
play arcade and I think it may be said

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:45.240 
play arcade and I think it may be said
probably<00:03:44.000> too<00:03:44.180> fast<00:03:44.419> when<00:03:44.599> you<00:03:44.690> play<00:03:44.870> online

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:45.250 
probably too fast when you play online

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.599 
probably too fast when you play online
but<00:03:46.250> I<00:03:46.549> like<00:03:47.510> to<00:03:47.540> be<00:03:47.810> able<00:03:47.930> to<00:03:48.139> see<00:03:48.440> have<00:03:49.400> that

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:49.609 
but I like to be able to see have that

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:51.430 
but I like to be able to see have that
at<00:03:49.819> that<00:03:50.060> time<00:03:50.239> see<00:03:50.750> look<00:03:50.870> at<00:03:50.930> that<00:03:50.989> second<00:03:51.319> oh

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.090 
is that the AI they made the AI a little

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:01.569 
is that the AI they made the AI a little
more<00:03:59.209> challenging<00:03:59.659> even<00:03:59.840> though<00:04:00.049> the<00:04:00.579> easier

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:01.579 
more challenging even though the easier

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:07.569 
more challenging even though the easier
difficulties<00:04:03.849> and<00:04:04.849> if<00:04:05.000> you<00:04:05.090> focus<00:04:06.430> see<00:04:07.430> if<00:04:07.489> you

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:07.579 
difficulties and if you focus see if you

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:11.530 
difficulties and if you focus see if you
use<00:04:07.760> making<00:04:08.000> me<00:04:08.150> look<00:04:08.269> bad<00:04:09.340> all<00:04:10.340> right

the<00:04:33.860> last<00:04:34.099> series<00:04:34.520> was<00:04:34.729> a<00:04:34.759> downer<00:04:35.120> but<00:04:35.300> this<00:04:35.660> is

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:35.810 
the last series was a downer but this is

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:37.809 
the last series was a downer but this is
a<00:04:35.900> chance<00:04:36.199> now<00:04:36.500> to<00:04:36.530> come<00:04:36.889> back<00:04:37.069> out<00:04:37.280> and<00:04:37.340> prove

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:50.530 
pursuit of the of the AI okay so i did a

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:52.890 
pursuit of the of the AI okay so i did a
nice<00:05:50.740> little<00:05:50.979> jump<00:05:51.250> right<00:05:51.490> there<00:05:51.550> and<00:05:52.090> then<00:05:52.719> I

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:52.900 
nice little jump right there and then I

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:55.499 
nice little jump right there and then I
start<00:05:53.169> to<00:05:53.229> turn<00:05:53.380> it<00:05:53.530> up<00:05:53.650> field<00:05:53.979> okay<00:05:54.729> then

00:05:55.499 --> 00:05:55.509 
start to turn it up field okay then

00:05:55.509 --> 00:05:57.810 
start to turn it up field okay then
don't<00:05:55.659> get<00:05:55.810> me<00:05:55.930> wrong<00:05:56.340> DeSean<00:05:57.340> Jackson<00:05:57.789> I

00:05:57.810 --> 00:05:57.820 
don't get me wrong DeSean Jackson I

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:00.810 
don't get me wrong DeSean Jackson I
believe<00:05:58.060> in<00:05:58.180> hands<00:05:58.360> about<00:05:58.479> 95<00:05:59.139> speed<00:05:59.580> but<00:06:00.580> at

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:00.820 
believe in hands about 95 speed but at

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:03.839 
believe in hands about 95 speed but at
some<00:06:01.120> point<00:06:01.409> one<00:06:02.409> of<00:06:02.469> these<00:06:02.800> guys<00:06:03.159> fidelis

00:06:03.839 --> 00:06:03.849 
some point one of these guys fidelis

00:06:03.849 --> 00:06:05.370 
some point one of these guys fidelis
should<00:06:04.120> have<00:06:04.300> been<00:06:04.479> trying<00:06:04.810> to<00:06:04.960> least<00:06:05.139> make<00:06:05.349> a

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:05.380 
should have been trying to least make a

should have been trying to least make a
diet<00:06:05.770> for<00:06:06.159> him<00:06:06.370> they<00:06:06.969> should<00:06:07.210> have<00:06:07.259> so<00:06:08.259> this

00:06:08.969 --> 00:06:08.979 
diet for him they should have so this

00:06:08.979 --> 00:06:10.529 
diet for him they should have so this
will<00:06:09.099> be<00:06:09.250> an<00:06:09.370> instance<00:06:09.759> where<00:06:09.820> okay<00:06:10.240> if<00:06:10.419> you

00:06:10.529 --> 00:06:10.539 
will be an instance where okay if you

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:12.070 
see this and this kind of stuff annoys

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:14.430 
see this and this kind of stuff annoys
you<00:06:12.340> or<00:06:12.520> you<00:06:12.669> figure<00:06:13.030> that<00:06:13.210> the<00:06:13.719> CPU<00:06:13.960> didn't

you or you figure that the CPU didn't
give<00:06:14.560> a<00:06:14.590> good<00:06:14.770> effort<00:06:14.949> then<00:06:15.610> that's<00:06:15.849> when<00:06:15.969> you

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:16.060 
give a good effort then that's when you

00:06:16.060 --> 00:06:17.580 
give a good effort then that's when you
can<00:06:16.210> go<00:06:16.360> into<00:06:16.479> those<00:06:16.630> sliders<00:06:16.990> that<00:06:17.169> I<00:06:17.319> showed

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:17.590 
can go into those sliders that I showed

00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:19.620 
can go into those sliders that I showed
you<00:06:17.680> earlier<00:06:17.949> that<00:06:18.460> where<00:06:19.060> you<00:06:19.150> can<00:06:19.300> adjust

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:31.930 
speed threshold this is where you will

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:37.290 
speed threshold this is where you will
bump<00:06:32.199> this<00:06:32.349> up<00:06:34.979> because<00:06:35.979> I<00:06:36.219> see<00:06:36.490> he<00:06:37.060> says<00:06:37.270> a

00:06:37.290 --> 00:06:37.300 
bump this up because I see he says a

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:39.209 
bump this up because I see he says a
higher<00:06:37.539> setting<00:06:37.960> will<00:06:38.080> narrow<00:06:38.349> the<00:06:38.469> disparity

00:06:39.209 --> 00:06:39.219 
higher setting will narrow the disparity

00:06:41.219 --> 00:06:41.229 
between slow and fast players so if I

00:06:41.229 --> 00:06:43.260

bump<00:06:41.500> this<00:06:41.620> up<00:06:41.680> to<00:06:42.099> you<00:06:42.669> know<00:06:42.789> I<00:06:42.969> don't<00:06:43.090> know

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:43.270 
bump this up to you know I don't know

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:45.870 
bump this up to you know I don't know
maybe<00:06:43.479> 55<00:06:44.050> 56<00:06:44.650> I'm<00:06:44.860> not<00:06:44.979> sure<00:06:45.190> how<00:06:45.580> much<00:06:45.729> it

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:45.880 
maybe 55 56 I'm not sure how much it

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:48.870 
maybe 55 56 I'm not sure how much it
increases<00:06:46.360> for<00:06:46.750> each<00:06:46.930> number<00:06:47.380> but<00:06:48.190> chances

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:48.880 
increases for each number but chances

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:50.760 
increases for each number but chances
are<00:06:49.030> they<00:06:49.360> would<00:06:49.539> have<00:06:49.690> made<00:06:49.870> an<00:06:49.990> attempt<00:06:50.710> to

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:50.770 
are they would have made an attempt to

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:53.790 
are they would have made an attempt to
dive<00:06:51.069> to<00:06:51.690> try<00:06:52.690> to<00:06:52.750> make<00:06:52.930> that<00:06:53.139> tackle<00:06:53.380> because

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:53.800 
dive to try to make that tackle because

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.559 
dive to try to make that tackle because
one<00:06:54.130> their<00:06:54.729> speed<00:06:55.030> would<00:06:55.180> have<00:06:55.240> been<00:06:55.389> a<00:06:55.419> little

00:06:55.559 --> 00:06:55.569 
one their speed would have been a little

00:06:55.569 --> 00:06:58.119 
one their speed would have been a little
bit<00:06:55.810> better<00:06:56.020> to<00:06:57.010> catch<00:06:57.190> up<00:06:57.430> to<00:06:57.580> me

00:06:58.119 --> 00:06:58.129 
bit better to catch up to me

00:06:58.129 --> 00:07:01.889 
bit better to catch up to me
like<00:06:58.520> I<00:06:58.580> said<00:06:58.639> DeSean<00:06:59.029> Jackson<00:06:59.509> speed<00:06:59.719> is<00:06:59.869> 95

00:07:01.889 --> 00:07:01.899 
like I said DeSean Jackson speed is 95

00:07:01.899 --> 00:07:04.059 
like I said DeSean Jackson speed is 95
but<00:07:02.899> i'll<00:07:03.020> take<00:07:03.229> that<00:07:03.259> touchdown<00:07:03.649> don't<00:07:03.979> get

00:07:04.059 --> 00:07:04.069 
but i'll take that touchdown don't get

00:07:04.069 --> 00:07:06.669 
but i'll take that touchdown don't get
me<00:07:04.159> wrong<00:07:04.929> and<00:07:05.929> if<00:07:06.050> you<00:07:06.139> want<00:07:06.289> to<00:07:06.379> see<00:07:06.499> your
