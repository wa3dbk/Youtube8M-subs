00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.520
 and lemon face battle 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.680
 the pirate world is a romantic world 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.600
 we can say what we want defense 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.220
 of the violence of pirate brutality 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.779
 but in the end the corsairs have 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.730
 inspired a lot of fantastic stories 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.590
 that have fascinated generations of 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.810
 people sometimes flowing into the 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.369
 often romance these stories 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.410
 they left the stark reality aside 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.809
 of those years marked by the so-called 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.760
 Europeans triangular trade 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:36.870
 they needed cotton room that 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.180
 they bought in the caribbean 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.829
 the Caribbean settlers needed to 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.290
 slaves who bought from slave traders 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.480
 Africans and finally the negroes of Africans 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.370
 they bought goods from the Europeans this 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.230
 economy made of human trafficking has 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.079
 marked one of the darkest pages of the 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.150
 modern history cry of freedom places us 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.670
 as former quartermasters 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:58.290
 of the dop jack who became an emancipated man 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.120
 and respected as well as a captain of 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.980
 vessel at the same time as the wall and is 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.180
 aware of its origins voted to 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.640
 save blacks from oppression 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.829
 enslaving that of the new protagonist 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.740
 it is a hard story made of violence and 

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:12.869
 grudges of marginalization and cruelty i 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.360
 purposes of which are good but i 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.100
 means are often ruthless the short the 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.109
 cry of freedom is probably the 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.749
 most violent chapter of the entire series 

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:24.090
 assassin's creed protagonist fights 

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:26.280
 continually making use of the 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.869
 bare hands and literally slaughtering i 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.119
 own enemies with a machete 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.189
 there are not many moral decisions to be made 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.229
 taking that to adapt is a struggle 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:36.299
 against the white man for the freedom of the 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.399
 black at the same time the game at 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.740
 ability to create a strong empathy between 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:42.270
 the protagonist is the player who well 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.399
 soon he will find himself marrying the cause 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.990
 of its people 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.029
 the main story is a screaming installment 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.520
 of liberty regards the liberation of the 

00:01:48.029 --> 00:01:51.719
 Haitian territory of port au prince 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.399
 subjugated by an evil governor is 

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:55.560
 transformed into a large market of 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:57.149
 slaves to get their purpose on 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.679
 player is forced to enter 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:00.899
 contact with the maitresse of the brothel 

00:01:58.679 --> 00:02:03.179
 local probably the only black woman 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.499
 of the island to have some power 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:06.659
 from here begins a story made of 

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:08.220
 daring resignation searches that 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.810
 however it is not saved from the usual 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.730
 mechanics of this series 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.260
 we find the missions by ship 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.880
 assaults on the strong and above all 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.950
 annoying tracking emissions 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.380
 without great variety compared to what 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.849
 seen in assassin's creed 4 black flag 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.560
 how new is the address of freedom 

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:24.270
 in fact it reveals itself especially in the 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.519
 seen of secondary schools almost all 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.989
 concerning the subject of slavery 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:28.980
 in many cases we have to save one 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.360
 slave from lynching 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.400
 the group of blacks by a violent one 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.000
 corporal punishment or by an auction of 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.550
 human beings 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.170
 in other cases we are called to sail the 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.180
 seas with our ship to reach 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.560
 of the plantations to be released in order to 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.690
 get a good number of companions 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.910
 victim rooms and ready to help us in 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:46.290
 some situations the number of slaves 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.060
 released during our missions 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:49.620
 secondary is preparatory to 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.720
 character ship upgrades 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.400
 while in some cases it is necessary a 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.560
 certain number of free slaves to be able to 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.450
 continue with the main story 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.890
 so we are basically obliged to 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.810
 complete a number of 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.269
 secondary quests to continue 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.130
 with the affair the thing translates into 

00:03:03.269 --> 00:03:07.290
 a prolonged gaming experience but 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.700
 certainly more repetitive thanks to 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.140
 this trick the developers are 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.099
 managed to bring the duration of the 

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.930
 main story 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:14.519
 in addition to the three hours they can become 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.290
 at least triple if you decide to 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:18.660
 discover all the islands and reveal the 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.519
 secrets that hide the map of 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.109
 haiti and surroundings is definitely more 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:24.120
 small of those included in assassin's 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:25.980
 creed 4 but it's still a nice portion 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.590
 of Orciano to explore rich of 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:30.329
 surprises and epic battles in the 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.280
 complex cry of freedom enjoys the 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:34.230
 same technical quality as black flag 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.880
 to report the excellent dubbing in 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.010
 Italian up to what 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:40.019
 we heard in the main game is 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.609
 the extraordinary soundtrack that 

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:44.579
 replaces the pirate motifs of 

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:46.799
 black flag of the African songs cry of 

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:48.780
 freedom presents an intense story with 

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:49.950
 accent a delicate and almost topic 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.519
 always ignored by the world of gods 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.859
 video games 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:54.750
 the anger of equality goes beyond the 

00:03:52.859 --> 00:03:56.549
 assassin cult and in some ways 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.300
 this feature does good a 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:59.280
 this dlc 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:00.900
 and overall it is different from the 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.940
 main series is worthy of being 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.160
 at the same time you have the feeling 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.780
 that the developers have tried to 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.610
 lengthen the broth a little by introducing 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.830
 a plethora of all secondary missions 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:13.140
 equal to each other but necessary for the purpose 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.880
 of the progression cry of freedom is 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.230
 however a quality council 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.180
 assassin's creed 4 black flag 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:20.070
 completely unrelated to the plot 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.330
 main is also suitable for those who are not 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.720
 still come to the end of the fourth 

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:23.720
 chapter
