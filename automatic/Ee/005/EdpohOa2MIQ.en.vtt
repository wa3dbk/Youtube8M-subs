00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.150

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.760
 he's hired a week ago 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.519

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.650
 make an informal chat with her and 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.600
 Let's find out some things that are 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.840
 thinking of the cage they have to say to 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.629
 Are people and I will ask a few questions? 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:43.950
 conversation first I would like to know the 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:45.629
 what they think of the team's assumption and 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.180
 leave to leave in two or three 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:51.480
 days how did they get to 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.370
 a heaven did not sit together to try 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.129
 seek the dream of china 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.140
 We will not train here how 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.710
 was san who is one of each was one of 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:05.570
 every team is a team you will know 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:09.479
 how does this team join 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:16.439
 I was on good news is that the type 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:19.650
 calmly set up a team for 70 years and 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:24.330
 there was a lot of fighting that's what it was 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:30.270
 put as your time base is this one 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:35.250
 region and today has a stock that 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:38.220
 Wanted to leave the team too. 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:41.150
 want whiskeytown i had a good talk 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:43.950
 with him is that for a long time this law and 

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:46.049
 so I know you 'll wait. 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.280
 pass this championship does not close 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:51.060
 with you 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:53.399
 It was cool, I did not like him much. 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.409
 went to china with him just as she 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.850
 It was not for this, it's going to be the guy I 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.950
 had 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:02.000
 The perfect guy to be a duo in 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:03.860
 This team is one and presented around 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.009
 only once again the team 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:09.020
 to click on a month also since the team 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:12.080
 Unless his uncle ended up 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.940
 I did not even speak at the moment, it's a guy like that. 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.280
 you he has been playing with me has 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.830
 table with me again enem 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.989
 I only saw him accepted at the time the guy plays 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.510
 is too limited and also takes care of unb 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:26.830
 almost another year with him 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:26.830
 so this is it 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:35.300
 It's like the project how to sit and talk 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:37.459
 you arrived and will form 15 will be the 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.430
 action is fast as it was to the project 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:42.200
 according to the project you thought 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:46.580
 billing the team and when you entered 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:49.069
 in that also our project was the 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:53.180
 travels that have interests for years 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:57.350
 will now move to China from 52 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:03:08.540
 win a title out there but only for 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:14.150
 throw it out the kid in brazil 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:17.720
 I do not like it and think about it, are you? 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:19.010
 obviously as the Serbian spoke and spoke 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.170
 that he choose the right people 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.549
 routines and the same perfect 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.310
 thinking about what this was like 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:27.739
 choice is that the first person arrived and 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:30.019
 said he was going to start to articulate 

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:31.850
 start riding get him from here pick up 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:40.100
 Hence how was your choice itself is 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:43.000
 specifically that the players about 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.000
 he 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:51.110
 his goal is the flamengo plays a lot 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:52.459
 each one has a good potential if it will 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:55.360
 fit the team well 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:59.840
 then when he danced with him he called him 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:02.209
 now the ski entrance was no longer 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.159
 Feeling good in his last guy. 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:07.430
 auxerre who was very friend of game 

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:10.519
 when also decided to loosen link 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:17.810
 Why have you been playing well come on? 

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:20.209
 by the team also having the team form the 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:22.550
 five teams have created a man for this 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:25.460
 team to start training and play together 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:28.610
 the championship had its own kid practice and 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:32.210
 this active team exit transition is 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:35.060
 without an organization that wants to 

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:39.820
 instead of you and the entrance of that 

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:42.830
 How was this transition defined? 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:44.449
 what would we have here behind a 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:47.720
 sponsorship that could provide the 

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:49.669
 structure necessary for us one 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:52.580
 team to compete in the world and 

00:04:49.669 --> 00:05:05.889
 represent the best way up from 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:05:10.310
 From this moment everything I was looking for 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:12.560
 structure of the team in that then I spoke 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:16.449
 For everybody on the team, everybody, too. 

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:19.099
 accepted because nowadays the player 

00:05:16.449 --> 00:05:21.650
 sought the organization obviously thinks 

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:26.199
 that was more or less like that 

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:33.020
 accepted and that was the project and the people 

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:35.930
 is here today is how is the 

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:38.120
 feeling that you are in line 

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:42.320
 New York said the team back 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:44.570
 using what is a 

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:47.480
 the blog house that will take after the video 

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:49.730
 Obviously it's your feeling. 

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:52.790
 They informed me up and stay in a week 

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:55.310
 training new at home in their homes 

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:58.970
 I came here has all the structure assembled 

00:05:55.310 --> 00:06:00.680
 for the qaida when your disc is missing and 

00:05:58.970 --> 00:06:04.970
 you are intensively training 

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:06.980
 in search of a dream that was an idiot is 

00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:10.340
 the feeling of being here in this house 

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:14.150
 very very good, I really like 

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:16.370
 play at home the set that they could 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:18.650
 spending a lot of tactics is having a 

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:22.610
 this kind of collaboration did not need 

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:25.220
 the team now and I was already pink 5 next to the 

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:27.650
 Your training fee is catching. 

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:31.870
 this is not so and here it is very 

00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:31.870
 well, this is very good here 

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:38.060
 I think there's a pot with a good chat with 

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:39.440
 you and I would like to thank you 

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:42.560
 will give this opportunity by investing in 

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:44.750
 a project in the game that we believe 

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:47.120
 that will grow in the future that is 

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:49.310
 growing is already at an advanced stage 

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:51.620
 I remember a little university 

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:53.410
 in the beginning is the championship are coming up 

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:56.630
 now begin to appear in the 

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:58.490
 of the game and believe that 

00:06:56.630 --> 00:07:01.970
 I'm on it so I brought you here. 

00:06:58.490 --> 00:07:03.800
 and it was decided that you play people is 

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:05.990
 annulled side you can count on 

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:06.890
 people and God willing we are 

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:08.900
