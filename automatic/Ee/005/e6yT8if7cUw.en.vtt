00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:06.399

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:13.520
 the flemish 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:33.540

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.450

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.320

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.000
 the versions only work for versions 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:46.350
 I'm going to demonstrate it here in a 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.840

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.890
 show how you can configure it 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:59.659
 the program here was a friend of ours 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:01:02.699
 and the site that made black do not 

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:05.460
 to configure you see here online 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:08.580
 additional machine functions 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.580
 keyboard that squeezed press that had the 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.750
 notion of pressing the key you want to 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:18.210
 team pressing 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:21.810
 I'll be here four times alone. 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:24.240
 300 time is faster than you 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:29.670
 you can also add new ones like vw and 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:35.000
 that's where the world's window click here 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.000
 oh little you come here and here 

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:43.350
 then you click on one here o death 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:46.380
 monkey and run this script and there 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.820
 start the portal once you do 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.200
 respect the other goals 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:55.619
 There you are to you in history here. 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:57.600

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.420
 high -level recording of marking the 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:05.219
 fifth and record you 're coming to you 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:07.289
 You can record a message like the flu 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:11.460
 of a null spammer only that this is the 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:14.130
 Fun in the Fun 97 Village Jacy One
