00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.779
 some very different crimes dream 

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:07.660
 minecraft body today so far in the 

00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:09.550
 third episode severed series of this 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:12.580
 package the network in the last episode 

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:14.530
 we are taken to this island not 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.900
 I found an island anyway 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.880
 finally the sheep that grew up 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.490
 now we'll see to kill to get the 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.949
 pd perfect bed now we have three 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:26.529
 pieces then we can go and get the 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:29.320
 our beautiful bed so I could 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:31.419
 spend the quiet night then 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.210
 let's do it at least we take it off of 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:37.600
 perfect means immediately done anyway 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.380
 well from the videos my phone takes 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.990
 a little 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.670
 with these we are really flanker then 

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:44.470
 obviously it is not the maximum of 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.660
 fluidity makes contact and that there are also 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:49.000
 a lot of way insert inside then 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:51.130
 here is if there is some minimum type 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.740
 now the fin has made us first names 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:55.330
 that you must excuse me but I can't 

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:57.250
 fuck was this and since I have 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:59.920
 found a bed in here no god 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:02.140
 I think about my complex to collect 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.359
 precarious apples can serve us in 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.130
 our future happens with this 

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:08.859
 package should also be there 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.649
 supply mode for as far as I understand 

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:13.899
 there is no crafting so here is some 

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:16.179
 useless if you can't cost this 

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:18.850
 i should city ​​apples so wouldn't have 

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:21.899
 very sense therefore firm two beds 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:24.340
 so now I would say maybe to settle down 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:27.249
 temporarily somewhere right 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:29.710
 to do a bit of it is obviously a crash 

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:30.909
 any video must still be there 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.859
 radio as said we will have to go to 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:34.539
 to climb somewhere right there 

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:37.270
 temporarily, however, I see that it is 

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:38.979
 already becoming night then a one thing 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.049
 little bad we did not even have a home 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:42.670
 so we'll sleep at work here 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:45.100
 after that we will put the bed 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:46.030
 cartera so let's put it perfect there 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.859
 we put at hand 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.139
 the target on the ground and we sleep 

00:01:47.859 --> 00:01:53.020
 immediately so we move on to the night a lot 

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:55.209
 quickly perfect good morning day 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.009
 just wake up so now let's go to 

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:59.889
 look also at part to make us a home 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:01.689
 temporary where to spend some time a 

00:01:59.889 --> 00:02:02.580
 who so we could also go a little 

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:04.710
 mine 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:06.630
 to do with the usual things anyway 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:08.190
 you have the exploration will never fail 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:11.640
 because as I said at the beginning of 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:14.670
 this series the extractions of this 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.310
 package the primary thing to do I think 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.780
 that maybe and even in philology 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.180
 introduces rho in this way pec la 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.640
 this book mode that fashion is that there 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.870
 introduces these why 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.540
 it would be a bit boring not this package 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.590
 we could have done so anyway 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.810
 the thing I want to do since there is 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.340
 we would have already here before losing the 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.950
 our beautiful ball start at 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.870
 digging the earth so a law ramps up 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:39.570
 call let's go over those will have to see 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:42.000
 a little we find him trying something 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.590
 good because otherwise I go there for nothing 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.100
 so which is a new dungeon 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:49.830
 that is the dungeon of peace cup of meter 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.360
 bric the mystery of the nec so we'll go to 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.150
 that in that see a little we will find 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:57.240
 let's see if we find anything useful 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:00.900
 I really hope the king is where he gives them 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:03.000
 call as many feared damages attacked 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.820
 as like the fact if you want another 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:08.130
 video already immediately left tomorrow 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:11.040
 I like zanetti below the video we do 

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.810
 always a hundred likes on average 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.970
 we are still in this video so so 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:18.000
 tomorrow you will have the new sweet ep immediately 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:21.120
 or episode 4 as it had integers 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.550
 I will always take to the world series e 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.769
 main you worry about that 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.630
 row will never miss these columns 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:30.810
 will remain forever that we are 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:32.790
 practically almost below so I would say of 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.560
 go up without any problems 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.959
 how many dungeons here that there are spaces 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:38.400
 for the world if rarely too many don't 

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:41.459
 I have to complain because we are on minecraft 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:43.080
 pocket god so here we don't have to 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:44.640
 complaining, however, we arrived here 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.300
 in the dundee or looks like an island of 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:46.950
 sky bloc 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.800
 so let's see what we in here 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.680
 announce the cock 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:53.600

 in this other that is the dungeon of the 

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:06.680
 network would be said to feel inside of 

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:08.660
 evil things we break the doors 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:12.200

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:27.170
