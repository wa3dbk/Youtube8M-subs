00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
touch on puzzle number 6 which was

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.689 
touch on puzzle number 6 which was
fairly<00:00:16.710> easy<00:00:16.980> I've<00:00:17.250> really<00:00:17.430> talks<00:00:17.609> about

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
fairly easy I've really talks about

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.730 
fairly easy I've really talks about
quite<00:00:18.090> a<00:00:18.150> bit<00:00:18.240> and<00:00:18.810> I'm<00:00:19.350> not<00:00:19.470> going<00:00:19.590> to<00:00:19.650> have

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
quite a bit and I'm not going to have

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.349 
quite a bit and I'm not going to have
the<00:00:19.830> hints<00:00:20.100> for<00:00:20.250> that<00:00:20.400> in<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.820> description

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
the hints for that in the description

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.570 
the hints for that in the description
today<00:00:21.810> because<00:00:22.470> it's<00:00:22.740> a<00:00:22.859> fairly<00:00:23.070> easy<00:00:23.220> puzzle

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
today because it's a fairly easy puzzle

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.790 
today because it's a fairly easy puzzle
and<00:00:23.760> hence<00:00:23.939> I<00:00:24.029> don't<00:00:24.240> think<00:00:24.619> hints<00:00:25.619> will<00:00:25.710> be

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
and hence I don't think hints will be

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.620 
and hence I don't think hints will be
required<00:00:26.189> for<00:00:26.640> you<00:00:26.730> guys<00:00:26.880> to<00:00:27.210> solve<00:00:27.449> it

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
required for you guys to solve it

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:28.939 
required for you guys to solve it
because<00:00:27.990> it's<00:00:28.230> all<00:00:28.380> over<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.769> comment

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949

was quickly some another one so there's

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.280 
was quickly some another one so there's
only<00:02:04.290> one<00:02:04.590> command<00:02:04.950> block<00:02:05.009> and<00:02:05.600> if<00:02:06.600> you<00:02:07.049> want

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
only one command block and if you want

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.229 
only one command block and if you want
to<00:02:07.560> guess<00:02:08.129> what's<00:02:08.520> in<00:02:08.670> this<00:02:08.759> can<00:02:08.879> I'm<00:02:09.000> looking

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
to guess what's in this can I'm looking

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.400 
to guess what's in this can I'm looking
go<00:02:09.330> ahead<00:02:09.450> and<00:02:09.539> do<00:02:09.599> that<00:02:09.720> basically<00:02:10.140> to

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
go ahead and do that basically to

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.530 
go ahead and do that basically to
summons<00:02:10.679> a<00:02:10.709> boat<00:02:10.890> yeah<00:02:11.160> just<00:02:12.000> a<00:02:12.090> normal<00:02:12.390> boat

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.000 
summons a boat yeah just a normal boat
and<00:02:12.810> I<00:02:13.140> guess<00:02:13.319> that<00:02:13.500> boy<00:02:13.620> has<00:02:13.770> crap

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.699 
and I guess that boy has crap
again<00:02:15.239> alright<00:02:15.840> let's<00:02:15.989> complete<00:02:16.260> it<00:02:16.319> one<00:02:16.590> more

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
again alright let's complete it one more

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:18.470 
again alright let's complete it one more
time<00:02:16.830> and<00:02:17.129> if<00:02:17.700> you<00:02:17.790> still<00:02:18.090> don't<00:02:18.150> trust<00:02:18.239> me

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
time and if you still don't trust me

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:19.940 
time and if you still don't trust me
I'll<00:02:18.720> going<00:02:18.870> to<00:02:18.959> spectator<00:02:19.409> mode<00:02:19.500> to<00:02:19.709> show<00:02:19.890> you

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.809 
I'll going to spectator mode to show you
but<00:02:20.760> this<00:02:21.150> is<00:02:21.330> just<00:02:21.540> an<00:02:21.629> ordinary<00:02:21.750> boats

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:22.819

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
spectator mode here we go

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.539 
spectator mode here we go
and<00:02:26.310> I<00:02:27.150> think<00:02:27.690> you<00:02:28.680> can<00:02:28.890> probably<00:02:29.129> already<00:02:29.400> see

and I think you can probably already see

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:31.640 
and I think you can probably already see
that<00:02:29.760> there<00:02:30.090> is<00:02:30.209> no<00:02:30.480> entity<00:02:30.780> riding<00:02:31.349> the<00:02:31.440> boats

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
that there is no entity riding the boats

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:37.160 
that there is no entity riding the boats
or<00:02:32.030> even<00:02:33.620> you<00:02:34.620> know<00:02:34.709> pushing<00:02:35.010> the<00:02:35.190> boat<00:02:35.340> so<00:02:36.239> if

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
or even you know pushing the boat so if

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.720 
or even you know pushing the boat so if
you<00:02:37.290> think<00:02:37.470> there<00:02:37.650> is<00:02:37.769> an<00:02:37.920> entity<00:02:38.160> somewhere

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
puzzle I'm not going to go through the

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.630 
puzzle I'm not going to go through the
hints<00:03:01.620> for<00:03:01.739> the<00:03:01.799> previous<00:03:02.129> puzzle<00:03:02.370> because<00:03:02.459> I

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
hints for the previous puzzle because I

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:05.750 
hints for the previous puzzle because I
already<00:03:03.150> covered<00:03:03.870> that<00:03:03.980> it's<00:03:04.980> fairly<00:03:05.280> it<00:03:05.640> was

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
already covered that it's fairly it was

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.930 
already covered that it's fairly it was
a<00:03:05.819> fairly<00:03:05.970> easy<00:03:06.090> puzzle<00:03:06.480> and<00:03:06.690> I<00:03:07.760> really<00:03:08.760> don't

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
a fairly easy puzzle and I really don't

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.330 
a fairly easy puzzle and I really don't
think<00:03:09.180> it's<00:03:09.959> really<00:03:10.319> necessary<00:03:10.410> to<00:03:11.190> talk

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
think it's really necessary to talk

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.160 
think it's really necessary to talk
about<00:03:11.489> it<00:03:11.670> any<00:03:11.819> longer<00:03:12.150> but<00:03:12.660> hopefully<00:03:13.109> you

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
about it any longer but hopefully you

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:14.599 
about it any longer but hopefully you
