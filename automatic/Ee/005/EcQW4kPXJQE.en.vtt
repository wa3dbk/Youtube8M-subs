00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:06.180
 good people saluting YouTube 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.160
 36 with a new tutorial if you have 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.180
 been half gone but good 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.950
 now inflated 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:13.660
 and well imagine I was answering 

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:14.710
 response from the other videos more than 

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.840
 making videos so good 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:18.850
 I basically bring you a new tutorial 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.660
 that because through the tutorial because 

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:21.660
 it happened to me 

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.980
 on a computer that I was brought to 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.990
 fix 

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.509
 that was forming her quiet a 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:32.059
 longing that was also the one that was 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:33.739
 format via usb as good here with them 

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:35.720
 the description of the other video that they are going to 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:37.400
 need it 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.410
 if they want good if you have a 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.790
 boot disk already happens a 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:42.739
 computer writer and a notebook already 

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:46.339
 has a director and I already had a record 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:47.900
 windows windows 7 has to do 64 32 

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:50.199
 bit is the same but good basically 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.699
 has to have win got a disk 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:56.050
 arable or a pendeloque 

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:59.030
 windows 7 let appear in a part 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:02.510
 suppose we are all with stores 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:05.720
 and will be the following 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:08.299
 with everything custom always what 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.840
 know me and here is going to tell us that this 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:10.840
 partition 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.690
 gpt style and we can not install is 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.630
 a relative city 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.120
 we had the partition we can not do 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.530
 nothing 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:28.890
 does not let you do anything in the next 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:32.010
 and it happened to me so I say 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:36.080
 what the fuck we can and it was good 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:37.640
 discovering to guide them is not no 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.130
 in any video that explains so 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.360
 quick as shit solves this 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.840
 problem that I appreciated so much what 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.520
 quite 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.259
 the only thing that I discovered game like a 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.329
 kind of tutorial that tells you how 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.310
 stop being so theoretically disk 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:53.460
 the problem that will have a backup 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.820
 done because yes no 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:59.760
 you will not be able to really erase all the 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:02.460
 fuck so they're going to have to do yes 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:04.260
 or yes make a backup before 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:08.209
 what there must be in this console 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:12.690
 with the shift key and f10 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:14.490
 together and this console that good cmd of 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.830
 ordinary windows that are going to 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.319
 start having a 7 shit command 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.360
 which is not a cosmic science either 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.660
 I'm not going to show it now first 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:27.520
 all list 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:30.520
 this will show us more or less that what 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.520
 admin 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.790
 why not say it said it we have the 

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:38.790
 disk capacity not click 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:44.569
 10 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.290
 she tells us that it is the disc 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.290
 selected 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.760
 the imparting in theory to you 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.140
 could show all the partitions that 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:05.520
 they have 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:08.170
 with cgt no or the part 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:11.110
 you should put clear 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.880
 obviously my brother the boarding school 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:16.470
 because the protection of 0 but good to 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.470
 You will also look the same this 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.150
 we put the parts are to see that 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.150
 has its positions correctly 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.150
 they clean 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:31.550
 then we put district ready back 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:34.280
 to see that they are 0 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:37.310
 the partitions 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:41.990
 and basically ready that is the 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:43.940
 they close and can already train directors 

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:45.800
 Remember that is it's like that 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:47.420
 they erase everything they have they leave 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:49.760
 zero and they want you as a partition 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:51.480
 new to disk 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.640
 and bone silk 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:55.800
 next demand 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.560
 I do not put him in the code of the 

00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:01.680
 boludeces and nothing else but the subject is 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.510
 be careful with the issue of the 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.270
 backup so well I hope you have them 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:09.420
 served the greetings of mexico-86 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:11.510
 subscribe the editors exhausted I command them 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.510
 a hug
