00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.549
 real 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.120
 do not 

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:21.980
 or the people of the youtube world here your 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.810
 dragon friend 91,000 101 in this video 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.300
 I'm going to talk about sega could take 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.849
 a new good console let's start 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.250
 discover it xd I'll talk about your last 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:32.930
 dreamcast console drean cast is the 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.969
 seventh and last videoconsole of 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:36.890
 Aftermath produced by sega was 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:39.320
 developed in cooperation with hitachi 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.570
 and microsoft that of the ncast is the 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.280
 successor to sega saturn and was launched 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:46.100
 to the market to gain ground to the 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.170
 sony playstation and nintendo 64 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.870
 nintendo and compete with the systems 

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:53.480
 successors to these belongs to the sixth 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:56.180
 console generation stopped its 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.950
 production in March 2004 after the 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.690
 decision to reap the dedication in 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:01.579
 exclusive to the programming of 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.710
 videogames its main 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:06.290
 Features are your optical reader 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.270
 header rom and its processor and touch and the 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.420
 system was the first to have a modem 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.880
 built-in to play online other like 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.100
 its predecessor sega saturn had it 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.710
 as an optional peripheral and not in all 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.690
 the countries where they were distributed in 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.860
 this version the modem was improved and it 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.320
 He could also use 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.990
 Latin America something that is very curious 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.090
 dreamcast 2 when I was in ancash 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.310
 At its height, it was commented that the 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.320
 Japanese company was developing 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.420
 a new ancash system but it 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:37.280
 canceled this project shortly after 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.860
 that sega was removed from manufacturing 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.990
 of video game consoles now let's start 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.390
 answering the question would be a great 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.490
 news for the industry and surely 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.520
 a breath of fresh air that I think 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:51.440
 it's needed because ps4 and xbox band are still 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.660
 a continuist line with the generation 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.759
 previous and the biggest novelty is that we 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:57.650
 they will wait for a fee to play in 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:59.869
 line and the history of the second hand 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.240
 of microsoft for example the one of ancash 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:04.220
 it was a revolution in the industry already 

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.500
 that was the first to include a modem for 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.420
 the online game to me the truth that I 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.910
 would be especially excited to return to the 

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.190
 uar I can not deny it but for the 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.440
 sega's size today would be 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.050
 practically impossible to compete 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.700
 with sony and microsoft nintendo is another 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.400
 roll and another market the one that has with 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.230
 wii wii 3ds and it would be an all or nothing if 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.630
 fails, would go bankrupt, and if 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.490
 it triumphs then to continue forward but with 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.140
 many ballots to fail 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:31.730
 because he does not have the funding 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.370
 enough to get the project 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.770
 go ahead with guarantees and compete with 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:39.290
 these two giants not by quality that 

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:41.120
 sega has a lot of market 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.520
 videogames is very appetizing for 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.680
 any technology company wins 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.620
 a lot of money and gas and could get 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:50.090
 Duarte in collaboration with another company 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.130
 taking advantage of this from the experience of 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.960
 sega in the sector and putting its brand 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.950
 as I claim an idea not so 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.650
 crazy 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.570
 samung a powerful company could look 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:01.700
 a collaboration with sega to make a 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:03.800
 video game console in the past pulled a 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.320
 version of sega saturn that was called 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.780
 samsung saturn this would get a little 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:11.510
 further a new game console silk 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:13.400
 but with the financial support of samsung and 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:16.190
 look with what catalog you could go to 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:18.470
 market well to boat soon exclusive of 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:20.390
 sega come to my forgiveness if I do not put 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:23.420
 the images of each game is that they are 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:26.000
 too many x from shenmue third jet set 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:30.320

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:45.769
 force streets of rage 4 and recently 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:47.959
 has acquired a plus they have licenses 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:50.480
 of games like the tac tic on person 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:52.640
 without megami tensei etcetera and more still 

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.400
 that now sega in strategy games 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.890
 the total saga is war football 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.079
 manager warhammer etcetera I do the 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.879
 mouth water just think about it then the 

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:04.280
 development of the games would have to 

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:06.319
 get ahead put money and that maybe 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.930
 not what is expected but hand 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:12.319
 have those licenses called a lot that 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:14.209
 say two comes alone could face the 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:17.120
 project of a new ancasti be 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:20.000
 competitive in the market 3 is so 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:22.820
 unreasonable a blind samsung alliance or 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.860
 sega and another company and paul for example 

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:27.289
