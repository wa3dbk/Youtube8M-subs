00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:07.339
 Hello everyone, today we will be with you 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.650
 make origami hearts 

00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:12.929
 they are used to decorate them 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:17.250
 for example stick on a gift well, more precisely 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:18.509
 already wrapped gift wrapping or 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.509
 for example on a card 

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:23.429
 all you need is scissors and 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:26.390
 color paper color paper need 

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:30.980
 cut it like this into rectangles 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:30.980
 in size 2 by 10 centimeters 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:41.690
 take our triangle unfold to 

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:44.890
 yourself short side and that's how you 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:47.600
 before the rush of airplanes we take 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:51.990
 corner and so bend it that 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:57.660
 get a triangle now where 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:01:01.700
 edge we bend and further inward to 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:04.470
 turned out to be a rectangle again and so 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:08.180
 continue that is a triangle 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.180
 right triangle rectangle 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:18.010
 like this we do as long as we have 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:22.799
 there is no such short edge on 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:25.799
 take the scissors and cut it like this 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.799
 formed 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:37.430
 we now fold this edge like this 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.430
 inside 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:49.109
 pushes night lasted off our 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.780
 triangles such a middle one all 

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:54.770
 almost ready to round out 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.770
 the ends 

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:06.500
 here it is our first heart 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:13.700
 so I made such a few pieces 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:18.920
 everything was very simple and done 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:20.360
 necessarily in minutes if u 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.080
 you failed the first time 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:27.560
 watch the video again and be sure 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.060
 everything will turn out I have not thought of that 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.489
 right now they made 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.250
 maybe you have ideas write to 

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:37.269
 comments i say goodbye to new 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.269
 meetings yet
