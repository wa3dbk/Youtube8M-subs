our face-to-face teaching so we have
general<00:01:24.140> technology-based<00:01:24.950> lesson<00:01:25.490> plans

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:25.729

with<00:01:28.880> students<00:01:29.330> in<00:01:29.420> the<00:01:29.509> classroom<00:01:29.539> and<00:01:30.140> I

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
with students in the classroom and I

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.200 
with students in the classroom and I
think<00:01:30.649> both<00:01:30.800> of<00:01:30.830> those<00:01:31.100> repositories<00:01:31.399> are<00:01:31.970> are

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
think both of those repositories are are

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:33.969 
think both of those repositories are are
useful<00:01:32.600> things<00:01:32.810> to<00:01:32.929> to<00:01:33.259> know<00:01:33.380> about<00:01:33.530> and<00:01:33.920> not

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:33.979 
useful things to to know about and not
