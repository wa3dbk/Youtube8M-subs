it's done me okay to touch screen i
realized<00:03:35.799> that<00:03:35.920> so<00:03:36.070> it's<00:03:36.190> a<00:03:36.220> little<00:03:36.400> difficult

00:03:36.539 --> 00:03:36.549 
realized that so it's a little difficult

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:37.979 
realized that so it's a little difficult
to<00:03:36.790> say<00:03:37.000> i<00:03:37.030> don't<00:03:37.450> really<00:03:37.600> feel<00:03:37.810> like<00:03:37.840> I'm

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
to say i don't really feel like I'm

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:39.840 
to say i don't really feel like I'm
touching<00:03:38.140> the<00:03:38.410> joystick<00:03:38.829> but<00:03:39.519> it's<00:03:39.640> really

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 
touching the joystick but it's really

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:41.009 
touching the joystick but it's really
tough<00:03:40.030> when<00:03:40.180> you're<00:03:40.299> playing<00:03:40.480> this<00:03:40.660> and<00:03:40.930> you

over<00:04:14.889> here<00:04:15.100> covering<00:04:15.459> my<00:04:15.579> current<00:04:16.120> myself<00:04:16.450> and

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
over here covering my current myself and

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.090 
over here covering my current myself and
I<00:04:16.900> can't<00:04:17.109> see<00:04:17.229> there's<00:04:17.410> any<00:04:17.500> enters<00:04:17.950> in<00:04:18.039> the

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.100 
I can't see there's any enters in the

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:19.379 
I can't see there's any enters in the
Bible<00:04:18.340> corners<00:04:18.609> because<00:04:18.700> my<00:04:18.850> thumb's<00:04:19.060> on<00:04:19.209> top

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:19.389 
Bible corners because my thumb's on top

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:21.779 
Bible corners because my thumb's on top
of<00:04:19.510> it<00:04:19.600> so<00:04:19.950> it's<00:04:20.950> a<00:04:21.039> little<00:04:21.160> frustrating<00:04:21.430> at

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:21.789 
of it so it's a little frustrating at

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:23.310 
of it so it's a little frustrating at
first<00:04:21.850> you<00:04:22.419> do<00:04:22.510> get<00:04:22.660> useful<00:04:22.840> after<00:04:23.050> a<00:04:23.200> while

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
first you do get useful after a while

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:24.719 
first you do get useful after a while
but<00:04:23.500> I<00:04:23.590> still<00:04:23.800> think<00:04:24.010> it<00:04:24.130> was<00:04:24.160> I<00:04:24.400> wish<00:04:24.550> was<00:04:24.700> a

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:24.729 
but I still think it was I wish was a

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:26.670 
but I still think it was I wish was a
better<00:04:24.940> way<00:04:25.030> to<00:04:25.150> do<00:04:25.330> it<00:04:25.479> instead<00:04:26.320> of<00:04:26.380> having<00:04:26.530> me

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
better way to do it instead of having me

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.469 
better way to do it instead of having me
you<00:04:27.070> know<00:04:27.190> instead<00:04:27.310> of<00:04:27.490> having<00:04:27.760> to<00:04:27.910> block<00:04:28.300> the

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:28.479 
you know instead of having to block the

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:29.909 
you know instead of having to block the
screen<00:04:28.750> with<00:04:28.930> your<00:04:29.050> thumb<00:04:29.260> should<00:04:29.289> be<00:04:29.620> able<00:04:29.680> to

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:29.919 
screen with your thumb should be able to

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:35.219 
screen with your thumb should be able to
would<00:04:30.580> we<00:04:30.669> go<00:04:30.820> around<00:04:33.060> but<00:04:34.060> you<00:04:34.389> know<00:04:34.510> that's

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:35.229 
would we go around but you know that's

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:36.300 
would we go around but you know that's
kind<00:04:35.470> of<00:04:35.500> thing<00:04:35.650> with<00:04:35.770> the<00:04:35.860> content<00:04:36.130> with

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:36.310 
kind of thing with the content with

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:37.680 
kind of thing with the content with
having<00:04:36.430> a<00:04:36.610> touchscreen<00:04:36.880> phone<00:04:37.030> there's<00:04:37.599> only

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:37.690 
having a touchscreen phone there's only

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:38.880 
having a touchscreen phone there's only
so<00:04:37.870> much<00:04:37.990> so<00:04:38.169> much<00:04:38.229> they<00:04:38.409> can<00:04:38.470> do<00:04:38.650> with<00:04:38.740> these

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:38.890 
so much so much they can do with these

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:39.690 
so much so much they can do with these
this<00:04:39.370> type

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:39.700 
this type

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:41.610 
this type
applications<00:04:40.570> but<00:04:40.690> I<00:04:40.720> think<00:04:40.930> they<00:04:40.990> do<00:04:41.140> they

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 
applications but I think they do they

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.910 
applications but I think they do they
pull<00:04:41.860> it<00:04:41.920> up<00:04:42.010> pretty<00:04:42.160> nicely<00:04:42.400> in<00:04:42.610> this<00:04:42.730> game

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:43.920 
pull it up pretty nicely in this game

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.380 
pull it up pretty nicely in this game
and<00:04:44.920> so<00:04:45.520> here's<00:04:45.700> where<00:04:45.850> you<00:04:45.940> would<00:04:46.060> switch<00:04:46.240> out

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:46.390 
and so here's where you would switch out

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:47.640 
and so here's where you would switch out
your<00:04:46.420> weapon<00:04:46.870> so<00:04:47.020> if<00:04:47.110> I<00:04:47.170> want<00:04:47.290> to<00:04:47.410> you<00:04:47.530> know

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:47.650 
your weapon so if I want to you know

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:49.500 
your weapon so if I want to you know
fire<00:04:48.190> some<00:04:48.460> bazooka<00:04:48.850> rounds<00:04:49.150> or<00:04:49.210> whatever<00:04:49.420> I

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:49.510 
fire some bazooka rounds or whatever I

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:52.950 
fire some bazooka rounds or whatever I
could<00:04:49.690> do<00:04:49.810> that<00:04:49.840> to<00:04:51.330> that<00:04:52.330> business<00:04:52.510> which<00:04:52.840> is

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 
could do that to that business which is

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:55.410 
could do that to that business which is
your<00:04:53.080> games<00:04:53.260> in<00:04:53.410> there<00:04:53.670> so<00:04:54.670> you<00:04:54.730> can<00:04:54.880> you<00:04:55.270> can

00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:55.420

change your options here from while
you're<00:04:56.800> in<00:04:56.890> the<00:04:56.980> game<00:04:57.160> or<00:04:57.340> you<00:04:57.400> can<00:04:57.520> do<00:04:57.610> it<00:04:57.670> in

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:57.760 
you're in the game or you can do it in

00:04:57.760 --> 00:04:59.490 
you're in the game or you can do it in
the<00:04:57.820> very<00:04:57.910> beginning<00:04:58.060> of<00:04:58.270> the<00:04:58.330> game<00:04:58.420> so<00:04:59.140> this

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
the very beginning of the game so this

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:00.960 
the very beginning of the game so this
