 cure pumpkins that are available laboratories work that corruption not 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:11.830
 they had been in Mexico on 

00:00:17.509 --> 00:00:20.849
 what it means to say in my life right now is one of the most important things 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:24.389
 for me if some day I become a good director it will be because I have passed 

00:00:24.389 --> 00:00:27.720
 hours and hours watching movies like that is yes 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.589
 it is very present 

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:32.870
 but before he wipes his tears after the same speech 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:34.410
 and director 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.770
 efe at the end for him 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.000
 FRANKFURT REUTERS UNDERSTANDS COUNT IS A PUPPY 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.340
 matute is the guy who directed transformers aso movies like these 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.199
 that makes your games live on emotion 

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:51.489
 when the two giant robots are fighting even though you do not know what 

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:54.489
 Fucked to pass 

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.250
 in fact movies like these that makes you think less about the performances and 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.950
 the history 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.130
 and that you look more at the explosions 100 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:10.550
 the chichis of megan fox 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.620
 now I do not have anything against megan fox vinatería have my bed naked 

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:16.620
 Twentieth of Jesus I would love to meet you 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.460
 after that but in my humble opinion I think that the cinema should be something 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.130
 more than a cube that solves the whole plot and adequate 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.150
 it has been seen that he was older when I told him out greater 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.100
 esther gordillo 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.850

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:35.140
 afp 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.380
 if not 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.520
 the city acz at the moment of truth 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.320
 we are from another planet 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.320
 because if not when all this guy 

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.579
 ii the operators 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:59.100
 for nothing in this cobbler archipelago that another battle is exhausted 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.260
 Thatcher and above all 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.690
 the tornados I remove by contract 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.099
 shortly after 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:10.299
 power 

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:13.629
 attack 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:15.369
 according to ccoo 

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:17.309
 let's imagine what it is like 

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:18.140
 i 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.879
 like this portal as the star 

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:22.950
 this guy 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.500
 because like west there was an intergalactic war for which he has a lot 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:27.039
 power 

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:31.509
 by that power it makes the machines more powerful pacheco enclosure 

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:36.389
 then everyone for you to touch a dn machine soda shoots 

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:39.490
 Barack Obama 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:43.630
 Baleares is not bad for movies that have the sole purpose of selling 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:44.280
 fishes 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.500
 but you also have to know how to distinguish between a film purge and a 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.500
 film palomera knows that pigeons are pigeon 

00:02:55.179 --> 00:02:58.669
 good that the basis of this advice as Chinese that the call is that before 

00:02:58.669 --> 00:03:01.459
 that classify movies as transformers or as fast and furious 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:05.819
 the bad grass take away all the special effects and analysis more than a 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:08.959
 good movie is still a good story because ultimately that 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:12.409
 is the cinema the art of being able to tell stories through images sounds and 

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:14.589
 jokes of pages 

00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:17.620
 good and since everyone has recommended film I'm also going to recommend
