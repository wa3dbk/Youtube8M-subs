00:00:00.809 --> 00:00:04.660
 have you drink is a way of the former with two cool is nothing for 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:05.610
 you 

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:10.419
 and that depends ICANN Stone Scarlatti board first of all once their own 

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:13.799
 That's on the Big Boss exam costs $ 3 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.680
 and then the first 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:16.990
 under store 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:20.160
 then you get legs in the settings 

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:31.089
 and for Eni to know a child, he could do so at 10 o'clock 

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.040
 for kind of percent for the different settings on your may who knows 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:37.910
 to explain 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.900
 that's as blatant as SB Settings 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.150
 only directly on the homescreen 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:47.360
 For example, to make up for blood uv share here then she showed the 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.520
 Battery status and the batteries Vogelmann reveals 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:55.330
 and here we can lure the portrait mode percent and facilities here is the 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:56.510
 Flight became it 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.120
 There is also no starting at 4 pm You can not just jump in indirectly 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.960
 Percent to play exactly 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.870
 and you can make out the location share and how long dwarf and 

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:08.780
 Anderson Vienna is a dedicated one 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.180
 this is my second year now only the percent networks name at us 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.270
 the jersey is her home 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.900
 and Straumann 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.920
 But there are more things for the iPhone 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.580
 For example, you can turn on the ALDE people and Spahn 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.229
 you can see that shows the one Beta 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.770
 So the data before 

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.770
 and thanks, there is still the Rapid ze corner 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.619
 clarified bitter when you do that once and then actually arises 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:40.560
 the machine downhill 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.080
 for pharmacists 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.620
 and 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.520
 m we have very cool take-aways 8 out of the third one 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.490
 but also from the Big Boss as before is Kauder Keyboard 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.200
 the second way war who in this video 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:58.750
 us around Dr 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.109
 arises as it were - 

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:02.200
 For 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.350
 the keyboard comes from Bavaria Porr Alcott or from the iPhone 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.929
 so on 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:11.129
 There are many different teams 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:15.659
 for example around the taz here the FIHM the just with us everything 

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:19.719
 is the Ungers Oehler from 7 go 

00:02:19.719 --> 00:02:22.829
 then you can now also for example make the message top topic 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:27.779
 and then you have to bring 

00:02:27.779 --> 00:02:31.179
 AUD 0 seconds 

00:02:31.179 --> 00:02:34.179
 So get it done and Stevan 

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:40.109
 Let's see if we have a Mac Book here per class gate now 

00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:44.679
 and then 

00:02:44.679 --> 00:02:47.679
 There are other options and all children 

00:02:48.679 --> 00:02:51.479
 for example Kammann 

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:53.939
 if we have one here now, too 

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:58.579
 Even writing a book develops the earth around this little one 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:01.329
 is called colorful letters in Großenkneten 

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:03.319
 inactive 4 

00:03:03.319 --> 00:03:06.319
 you can also percent Kreis Düren 

00:03:10.889 --> 00:03:13.929
 and percent that is the porter 

00:03:16.509 --> 00:03:18.910
 you can also make fun of it, according to the «world» 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.019
 to call 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:25.019
 At night I have to get away from here 

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:33.699
 Let's finish here 

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:37.909
 do not attract here 

00:03:40.089 --> 00:03:41.369
 done so 

00:03:41.369 --> 00:03:43.409
 Sukhumi 

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:45.839
 the risks are Roth now 

00:03:45.839 --> 00:03:48.839
 In the evening, something seems to be out of order and now 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:53.379
 That's another option 

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:55.749
 4 Awlaki board 

00:03:55.749 --> 00:03:58.989
 then the processes are still around 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:01.989
 in morality who now thinks also Rheine 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:03.680
 this means 

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.680
 to not pursue 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:11.389
 if like here 

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:14.930
 the one book star bridge these letters are all so light 

00:04:14.929 --> 00:04:16.180
 rounded 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.180
 and that can be embarrassing because they are picked up 

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:23.270
 been with this 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.270
 not only that now quite high 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.809
 im jumping 

00:04:29.809 --> 00:04:32.650
 Ring also welcomes Bertlich 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.469
 and here you go 

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:37.469
 this is very much rounded 

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:44.610
 so and the last that worked out at all needed 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.110
 that would 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:50.110
 the cashier way cleared away from the keyboard 

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:55.669
 still minimal around 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.800
 then you look for yourself and then if you get him 

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:03.479
 us 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:08.240
 8 have forgotten to spray 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:17.150
 so 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:20.409
 Here is a lot of effort prevented that they are very cool made of sheet metal 

00:05:22.219 --> 00:05:25.330
 and you still have one on top with this little one around 

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:27.870
 this per lot 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:31.339
 and you can also have your own backgrounds 

00:05:31.339 --> 00:05:32.650
 Add 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:35.650
 for the keyboard and such was 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:41.710
 Mainz 

00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:47.149
 Make the app Images and there you have one from mourning photo 

00:05:48.259 --> 00:05:49.430
 Library 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:51.879
 to find him 

00:05:51.879 --> 00:05:54.159
 why not 

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:57.999
 so the Wars for the 2 x I could hope and I could 

00:05:58.939 --> 00:06:03.159
 they allow millions and Germany and last but not least 

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:05.930
 we still want to 

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:08.930
 for the first 100 but also call this thought 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:13.120
 to the thanks of him and he is it we are very pleased 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:16.740
 without that, of course, would be great if it went on like this 

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:21.529
 and see you next time, "says Eibeck de
