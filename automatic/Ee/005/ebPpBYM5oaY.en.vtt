I've<00:00:19.670> left<00:00:20.029> the<00:00:20.240> wall<00:00:20.420> quite<00:00:20.810> long<00:00:21.430> on<00:00:22.430> each

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:22.460 
I've left the wall quite long on each

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.400 
I've left the wall quite long on each
side<00:00:22.940> when<00:00:23.150> I<00:00:23.210> cast<00:00:23.450> it<00:00:23.630> on<00:00:23.780> and<00:00:24.050> when<00:00:24.140> I<00:00:24.170> cast

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:24.410 
side when I cast it on and when I cast

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:26.920 
side when I cast it on and when I cast
it<00:00:24.590> off<00:00:24.740> this<00:00:25.640> was<00:00:25.850> intentional<00:00:26.210> because<00:00:26.780> I

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:26.930 
it off this was intentional because I

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.460 
it off this was intentional because I
knew<00:00:27.170> I'd<00:00:27.350> be<00:00:27.619> sewing<00:00:28.310> up<00:00:29.180> with<00:00:29.660> this<00:00:29.960> wall<00:00:30.230> if

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:30.470 
knew I'd be sewing up with this wall if

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:32.499 
knew I'd be sewing up with this wall if
you<00:00:30.980> haven't<00:00:31.520> got<00:00:31.699> a<00:00:31.730> long<00:00:32.000> bit<00:00:32.180> of<00:00:32.300> wall

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:32.509 
you haven't got a long bit of wall

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:35.889 
you haven't got a long bit of wall
that's<00:00:32.930> absolutely<00:00:33.530> fine<00:00:33.890> just<00:00:34.820> cut<00:00:35.420> a<00:00:35.449> piece

00:00:35.889 --> 00:00:35.899 
that's absolutely fine just cut a piece

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:38.470 
that's absolutely fine just cut a piece
of<00:00:36.109> wool<00:00:36.319> and<00:00:36.550> just<00:00:37.550> start<00:00:37.819> sewing<00:00:38.059> with<00:00:38.359> it

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.480

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.799 
of wool and just start sewing with it
that's<00:00:38.659> fine<00:00:38.899> to<00:00:39.140> do<00:00:39.289> that<00:00:39.559> I<00:00:40.300> was<00:00:41.300> just<00:00:41.449> taking

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:41.809 
that's fine to do that I was just taking

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:43.709 
that's fine to do that I was just taking
a<00:00:41.929> short<00:00:42.170> cut

00:00:43.709 --> 00:00:43.719 
a short cut

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:47.160 
a short cut
okay<00:00:44.719> so<00:00:44.780> the<00:00:44.929> top<00:00:45.140> of<00:00:45.170> the<00:00:45.379> glove<00:00:45.649> you<00:00:45.979> can<00:00:46.129> see

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:47.170 
okay so the top of the glove you can see

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:51.700 
okay so the top of the glove you can see
it's<00:00:48.170> slightly<00:00:49.600> tighter<00:00:50.600> this<00:00:51.019> side<00:00:51.319> than<00:00:51.620> it

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:51.710 
it's slightly tighter this side than it

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:55.000 
it's slightly tighter this side than it
is<00:00:51.739> this<00:00:52.039> side<00:00:52.309> so<00:00:53.120> I'm<00:00:53.239> going<00:00:53.269> to<00:00:53.690> have<00:00:54.010> the

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
is this side so I'm going to have the

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.509 
is this side so I'm going to have the
tighter<00:00:55.339> side<00:00:55.989> around<00:00:56.989> the<00:00:57.499> fingers<00:00:58.069> so<00:00:58.339> it

00:00:58.509 --> 00:00:58.519 
tighter side around the fingers so it

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:01.239 
tighter side around the fingers so it
kind<00:00:59.179> of<00:00:59.239> shapes<00:00:59.569> around<00:00:59.989> there<00:01:00.319> so<00:01:01.159> we'll

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:01.249 
kind of shapes around there so we'll

00:01:01.249 --> 00:01:04.090 
kind of shapes around there so we'll
concentrate<00:01:01.609> on<00:01:01.969> that<00:01:02.120> side<00:01:02.420> first<00:01:02.749> so<00:01:03.229> you

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
concentrate on that side first so you

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.700 
concentrate on that side first so you
fold<00:01:04.309> the<00:01:04.519> mitten<00:01:04.850> in<00:01:05.000> half<00:01:06.760> get<00:01:07.760> the<00:01:07.970> ends

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:08.710 
fold the mitten in half get the ends

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:14.350 
fold the mitten in half get the ends
flush<00:01:10.539> okay<00:01:11.539> and<00:01:11.780> you<00:01:12.680> literally<00:01:13.130> just<00:01:14.090> sew

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
flush okay and you literally just sew

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.219 
flush okay and you literally just sew
both<00:01:14.719> pieces<00:01:15.219> with<00:01:16.219> a<00:01:16.250> running<00:01:16.579> stitch<00:01:17.229> which

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
both pieces with a running stitch which

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:26.200 
both pieces with a running stitch which
is<00:01:18.259> actually<00:01:19.689> through<00:01:20.689> both<00:01:20.930> pieces<00:01:23.799> and<00:01:25.210> up

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
is actually through both pieces and up

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.870 
is actually through both pieces and up
through<00:01:26.840> both<00:01:27.079> pieces

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.679 

don't<00:01:31.750> keep<00:01:31.990> it<00:01:32.170> as<00:01:32.549> level<00:01:33.549> as<00:01:33.850> you<00:01:34.030> can<00:01:34.299> the

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:34.689 
don't keep it as level as you can the

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:46.910 
don't keep it as level as you can the
two<00:01:34.900> pieces<00:01:37.619> other<00:01:38.619> sons<00:01:38.860> come<00:01:39.130> out

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.290 

so<00:01:47.640> again<00:01:49.250> we<00:01:50.250> do<00:01:50.520> need<00:01:50.729> to<00:01:50.760> remember<00:01:50.970> about

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:51.300 
so again we do need to remember about

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.790 
so again we do need to remember about
the<00:01:51.510> thumb<00:01:51.900> hole<00:01:52.970> where<00:01:53.970> it's<00:01:54.180> situated<00:01:54.659> is<00:01:55.140> up

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:55.800 
the thumb hole where it's situated is up

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:02.480 
the thumb hole where it's situated is up
to<00:01:56.070> you<00:01:56.280> I<00:01:57.560> will<00:01:58.560> kind<00:01:58.770> of<00:02:00.920> do<00:02:01.920> it<00:02:02.010> down<00:02:02.190> fairly

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
to you I will kind of do it down fairly

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.580 
to you I will kind of do it down fairly
far<00:02:02.910> you<00:02:03.780> can<00:02:03.960> then<00:02:04.110> try<00:02:04.500> on<00:02:04.800> the<00:02:05.700> glove<00:02:06.590> it's

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
far you can then try on the glove it's

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.440 
far you can then try on the glove it's
just<00:02:07.800> sort<00:02:07.979> of<00:02:08.100> gauge<00:02:08.429> where<00:02:08.940> the<00:02:09.090> thumb<00:02:09.330> is

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
just sort of gauge where the thumb is

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.930 
just sort of gauge where the thumb is
going<00:02:09.570> to<00:02:09.690> be<00:02:09.840> so<00:02:10.440> I<00:02:10.470> I<00:02:11.039> think<00:02:11.310> I'm<00:02:11.640> going<00:02:11.790> to<00:02:11.820> do

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
going to be so I I think I'm going to do

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.699 
going to be so I I think I'm going to do
a<00:02:12.270> couple<00:02:12.600> more<00:02:12.750> stitches<00:02:13.020> because<00:02:13.530> it's

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
a couple more stitches because it's

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:16.940 
a couple more stitches because it's
still<00:02:14.010> not<00:02:14.340> covering<00:02:15.180> these<00:02:15.480> fingers<00:02:15.989> as<00:02:16.739> well

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
still not covering these fingers as well

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.440 
still not covering these fingers as well
as<00:02:17.100> I<00:02:17.250> wanted<00:02:17.459> them<00:02:17.580> to<00:02:17.810> so<00:02:18.810> I'm<00:02:18.870> going<00:02:19.050> to<00:02:19.080> do

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
as I wanted them to so I'm going to do

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:27.140 
as I wanted them to so I'm going to do
maybe<00:02:21.450> just<00:02:21.720> one<00:02:21.870> more<00:02:21.900> stitch<00:02:22.290> actually<00:02:26.150> and

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
maybe just one more stitch actually and

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.420 
maybe just one more stitch actually and
when<00:02:27.269> you<00:02:27.330> get<00:02:27.480> to<00:02:27.600> the<00:02:27.720> end<00:02:27.840> just<00:02:28.250> go<00:02:29.250> away<00:02:29.310> for

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
when you get to the end just go away for

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.110 
when you get to the end just go away for
that<00:02:29.730> same<00:02:30.060> stitch<00:02:30.510> a<00:02:30.900> few<00:02:31.560> times<00:02:31.860> just<00:02:32.370> to

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
that same stitch a few times just to

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.860 
that same stitch a few times just to
strengthen<00:02:33.750> it<00:02:33.900> and<00:02:34.430> they<00:02:35.430> literally<00:02:35.880> just<00:02:36.269> go

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
strengthen it and they literally just go

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:50.849 
strengthen it and they literally just go
back<00:02:37.110> on<00:02:37.320> yourself<00:02:41.930> just<00:02:42.930> in<00:02:43.230> out<00:02:43.560> in<00:02:43.860> now

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:50.859

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
okay so just come up to the end and then

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.739 
okay so just come up to the end and then
you<00:02:53.629> can<00:02:54.310> snip<00:02:55.310> that<00:02:55.430> end<00:02:55.609> off<00:02:55.819> or<00:02:56.180> what<00:02:56.420> I<00:02:56.450> like

00:02:56.749 --> 00:02:58.929 
you can snip that end off or what I like
to<00:02:56.959> do<00:02:57.139> just<00:02:57.170> to<00:02:57.499> make<00:02:57.560> it<00:02:57.829> extra<00:02:58.219> secure

00:02:58.929 --> 00:02:58.939

it's<00:02:59.900> just<00:03:00.200> thread<00:03:01.069> the<00:03:01.219> needle<00:03:01.579> through<00:03:01.879> a

00:03:01.899 --> 00:03:01.909 
it's just thread the needle through a

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:05.679 
it's just thread the needle through a
chunk<00:03:02.590> of<00:03:03.590> the<00:03:03.769> seam<00:03:04.269> just<00:03:05.269> to<00:03:05.359> give<00:03:05.510> it<00:03:05.540> that

00:03:05.679 --> 00:03:05.689 
chunk of the seam just to give it that

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:12.160 
chunk of the seam just to give it that
extra<00:03:05.840> security<00:03:07.989> at<00:03:08.989> the<00:03:09.170> end<00:03:09.319> of<00:03:09.439> okay<00:03:10.340> so<00:03:11.170> to

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
extra security at the end of okay so to

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.809 
extra security at the end of okay so to
the<00:03:12.560> other<00:03:12.709> side<00:03:12.980> we<00:03:13.310> do<00:03:13.430> exactly<00:03:13.939> the<00:03:14.180> same<00:03:14.419> I

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:15.819 
the other side we do exactly the same I

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:18.640 
the other side we do exactly the same I
like<00:03:16.819> to<00:03:16.969> have<00:03:17.060> the<00:03:17.239> other<00:03:17.540> side<00:03:17.840> sewn<00:03:18.319> up<00:03:18.349> a

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
like to have the other side sewn up a

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:21.849 
like to have the other side sewn up a
little<00:03:18.829> bit<00:03:19.040> longer<00:03:19.280> so<00:03:19.870> it<00:03:20.870> keeps<00:03:21.049> my<00:03:21.439> wrists

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:21.859 
little bit longer so it keeps my wrists

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:27.059 
little bit longer so it keeps my wrists
nice<00:03:22.280> and<00:03:22.669> warm<00:03:23.919> so<00:03:24.919> do<00:03:25.099> you<00:03:25.189> feel<00:03:25.370> the<00:03:25.519> cold

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
line up at the bottom edge and this side

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:38.970 
line up at the bottom edge and this side
edge<00:03:35.379> so<00:03:36.379> this<00:03:36.439> is<00:03:36.650> me<00:03:36.889> as<00:03:37.189> it<00:03:37.370> can<00:03:37.519> possibly<00:03:37.699> be

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
edge so this is me as it can possibly be
