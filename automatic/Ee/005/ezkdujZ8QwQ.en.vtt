flip you know last time I showed you a

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.330 
flip you know last time I showed you a
hard<00:00:15.000> flip<00:00:15.210> it's<00:00:15.660> pretty<00:00:15.960> similar<00:00:16.560> the<00:00:16.590> board

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
hard flip it's pretty similar the board

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.760 
hard flip it's pretty similar the board
does<00:00:17.550> the<00:00:17.699> same<00:00:17.880> motion<00:00:18.359> only<00:00:19.140> your<00:00:19.289> body<00:00:19.500> just

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
does the same motion only your body just

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.349 
does the same motion only your body just
turns<00:00:20.070> with<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.400> board<00:00:20.609> on<00:00:20.880> the<00:00:21.000> frontside

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
turns with the board on the frontside

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.480 
turns with the board on the frontside
flip<00:00:21.630> go<00:00:22.289> watch<00:00:22.560> like<00:00:22.830> some<00:00:22.980> old<00:00:23.070> painting

flip go watch like some old painting
parts<00:00:23.910> or<00:00:24.090> watch<00:00:24.240> like<00:00:24.510> some<00:00:24.720> reynolds<00:00:25.170> parts

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:25.580 
parts or watch like some reynolds parts

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.339 
parts or watch like some reynolds parts
so<00:00:26.580> to<00:00:26.640> how<00:00:26.880> i<00:00:26.910> learned<00:00:27.300> how<00:00:27.510> to<00:00:27.630> do<00:00:27.869> frontside

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
so to how i learned how to do frontside

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.679 
so to how i learned how to do frontside
flips<00:00:28.800> just<00:00:29.369> by<00:00:29.519> studying<00:00:29.939> those<00:00:30.090> parts<00:00:30.510> kind

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
flips just by studying those parts kind

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.389 
flips just by studying those parts kind
of<00:00:31.669> within<00:00:32.669> a<00:00:32.700> frontside<00:00:33.180> flip<00:00:33.590> you<00:00:34.590> need<00:00:35.309> to

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
of within a frontside flip you need to

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.370 
of within a frontside flip you need to
learn<00:00:35.489> how<00:00:35.550> to<00:00:35.670> do<00:00:35.910> on<00:00:36.120> kick<00:00:36.719> flips<00:00:37.020> and

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
learn how to do on kick flips and

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.090 
learn how to do on kick flips and
frontside<00:00:38.010> 180s<00:00:38.460> first<00:00:38.969> to<00:00:39.899> get<00:00:40.050> just<00:00:40.469> the

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
frontside 180s first to get just the

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.310 
frontside 180s first to get just the
idea<00:00:41.460> of<00:00:41.520> that<00:00:41.610> motion<00:00:42.180> it's<00:00:42.300> like<00:00:42.480> you<00:00:43.230> know

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
idea of that motion it's like you know

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.650 
idea of that motion it's like you know
kickflip<00:00:43.980> plus<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.370> front<00:00:44.610> 180<00:00:44.760> that<00:00:45.239> equals

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
kickflip plus the front 180 that equals

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:52.479 
kickflip plus the front 180 that equals
a<00:00:45.930> frontside<00:00:46.649> kickflip<00:00:50.000> my<00:00:51.000> foot<00:00:51.329> placement
