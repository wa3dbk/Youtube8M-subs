00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:27.460
 handstand starting to learn stands 

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:29.710
 the science of the wall is also like learning 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:34.420
 stand on your head sounds take place on 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:39.220
 pad arms against the wall 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:46.180
 sponge and put one side on the pillow 2 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:48.160
 the other side of the pillow is not very wide and 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:51.790
 do not put your hands very wide 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:55.210
 I ask and we try to get up to tear off 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:59.050
 legs from the hall the first time will 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:02.140
 a very small aspect is needed slowly 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:06.780
 develop strengthen as long as we 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:10.450
 You will not be able to take the hand written feet 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:14.130
 better only feet only socks to the wall 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:16.680
 at the same time, the arms are bound 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.630
 keep your arms straight 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:23.350
 very very tense very strong 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:25.330
 if this does not happen elbows bend 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.140
 and you can hit your head 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:31.909
 understand we put 

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:34.100
 ear not to hit take it 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:36.830
 position to hold a few seconds later 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:40.790
 fall motion repeats 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:43.850
 several times until you 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:47.420
 you will be sure, please will not 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:50.479
 sure that you are well worth fighting 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:53.200
 position when you already and quvain and you that 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:57.110
 stand in this position I apologize 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:59.660
 tearing off the heel socks from the wall and 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:02.660
 try to keep this position like 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:05.020
 can be longer at first it will be 1 2 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:07.250
 seconds 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:10.039
 once again repeats all movements 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.730
 repeated very, very, very many times 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:17.690
 and not a single day until you 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:24.880
 rest assured that you know well what 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:27.880
 keep well once again and tear off your legs 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.880
 shades 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.170
 immediately taking his feet from the wall accept 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:35.260
 this is the position when you feel that we are 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:40.750
 have been standing for a very long time 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:47.840
 it is worth not falling does not fall does not fall 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:50.660
 we stand now when we fall 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.480
 necessarily lower the Volga gently at first 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:56.630
 drop one second leg do not fall 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:59.450
 again please should not happen 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:02.720
 fall if you feel that you are each 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:08.840
 time you fall, put something under your feet 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:14.090
 put a type of mattress on was a case if you 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:16.299
 fall please put a mattress on the threshold 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.670
 so as not to hit each time 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:21.440
 feet 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.709
 all mattress fell down on anything 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.709
 soft 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.610
 best to learn how to let them go 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:38.340
 after but confident 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:38.340
 feel we move to the middle 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:55.810
 middle and try to keep the position 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:58.840
 as long as possible if you 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:01.209
 go back better lower your legs in 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:05.280
 in any case not by danny we hit our backs 

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:10.450
 not like a tree that falls straight 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:18.789
 once again first let the legs up 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:23.340
 trying upward we hold very gently gives 

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:23.340
 so turn god again 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:32.949
 movement repeats every day every 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:35.199
 occupation is very rich with time she 

00:04:32.949 --> 00:04:38.940
 will turn out over time 

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:38.940
 stand longer and longer and longer 

00:04:54.319 --> 00:04:57.739
 again 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:18.259
 after many repetitions if you are tired 

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:23.150
 rest and after a short rest 

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:25.360
 try to get up again do 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:25.360
 this
