00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.220 

I<00:00:08.150> think<00:00:09.150> it's<00:00:09.300> going<00:00:09.389> to<00:00:09.480> be<00:00:09.630> something

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
I think it's going to be something

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.789 
I think it's going to be something
really<00:00:10.559> good<00:00:10.889> for<00:00:11.269> hockey<00:00:12.799> internationally

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
really good for hockey internationally

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.060 
really good for hockey internationally
it's

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:15.070 
it's

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:18.420 
it's
it's<00:00:15.759> well<00:00:15.969> organized<00:00:16.510> and<00:00:16.779> it's<00:00:17.050> a<00:00:17.430> economy

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:18.430 
it's well organized and it's a economy

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:20.519 
it's well organized and it's a economy
behind<00:00:18.820> it<00:00:19.000> and<00:00:19.240> I<00:00:19.779> think<00:00:20.200> the<00:00:20.320> players

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:20.529 
behind it and I think the players

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:23.040 
behind it and I think the players
believe<00:00:21.070> in<00:00:21.279> it<00:00:21.430> this<00:00:21.699> time<00:00:21.760> so<00:00:22.300> I<00:00:22.330> think<00:00:22.750> it's

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:23.050 
believe in it this time so I think it's

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.050 
believe in it this time so I think it's
going<00:00:23.200> to<00:00:23.290> be<00:00:23.380> a<00:00:23.410> really<00:00:23.619> good<00:00:23.830> thing<00:00:23.890> for<00:00:24.340> for

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:25.060 
going to be a really good thing for for

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.460 
going to be a really good thing for for
the<00:00:25.150> hockey

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.479 

that's<00:00:29.369> awesome<00:00:30.210> I<00:00:30.689> mean<00:00:30.720> there's<00:00:31.309> no<00:00:32.309> better

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
that's awesome I mean there's no better

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.460 
that's awesome I mean there's no better
tournament<00:00:33.059> to<00:00:33.180> play<00:00:33.210> the<00:00:33.570> better<00:00:33.750> team<00:00:34.050> say

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:34.470 
tournament to play the better team say

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.130 
tournament to play the better team say
in<00:00:34.829> Europe<00:00:35.489> it's<00:00:35.670> going<00:00:35.910> to<00:00:35.970> be<00:00:36.090> a<00:00:36.140> really

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
in Europe it's going to be a really

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.229 
in Europe it's going to be a really
interesting<00:00:37.410> and<00:00:37.890> it's<00:00:38.820> going<00:00:39.000> to<00:00:39.090> be<00:00:39.210> a

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
interesting and it's going to be a

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.780 
interesting and it's going to be a
measurement<00:00:39.629> for<00:00:40.110> every<00:00:40.949> hockey<00:00:41.160> league<00:00:41.519> in

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
measurement for every hockey league in

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.360 
measurement for every hockey league in
Europe<00:00:42.360> to<00:00:42.629> measure<00:00:43.199> themselves<00:00:43.500> against<00:00:44.220> the

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
Europe to measure themselves against the

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.850 
Europe to measure themselves against the
best<00:00:44.519> teams<00:00:44.820> in<00:00:45.059> in<00:00:45.390> other<00:00:45.629> countries<00:00:46.170> and<00:00:46.440> I

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
best teams in in other countries and I

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.380 
best teams in in other countries and I
think<00:00:47.699> that's<00:00:47.879> going<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.059> be<00:00:48.210> really

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
think that's going to be really

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.750 
think that's going to be really
interesting<00:00:49.050> not<00:00:49.650> just<00:00:49.890> for<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.190> players<00:00:50.430> but

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
interesting not just for the players but

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.720 
interesting not just for the players but
also<00:00:50.790> for<00:00:51.360> the<00:00:51.449> people<00:00:51.480> watching<00:00:52.019> the<00:00:52.379> games

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.890 

I<00:00:56.110> think<00:00:57.110> it<00:00:57.200> means<00:00:57.290> a<00:00:57.500> lot<00:00:57.649> I<00:00:57.980> mean<00:00:58.720> the<00:00:59.720> way<00:00:59.870> it

00:00:59.890 --> 00:00:59.900 
I think it means a lot I mean the way it

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.790 
I think it means a lot I mean the way it
is<00:01:00.110> today<00:01:00.309> the<00:01:01.309> teams<00:01:01.610> have<00:01:01.790> fans<00:01:02.329> and<00:01:02.800> people

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:03.800 
is today the teams have fans and people

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.790 
is today the teams have fans and people
around<00:01:04.699> their<00:01:05.000> neighborhood<00:01:05.210> and<00:01:05.800> even

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:06.800 
around their neighborhood and even

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.590 
around their neighborhood and even
within<00:01:07.070> their<00:01:07.369> country<00:01:07.909> but<00:01:08.150> they<00:01:08.360> don't<00:01:08.540> have

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:08.600 
within their country but they don't have

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.899 
within their country but they don't have
fans<00:01:08.990> in<00:01:09.320> in<00:01:09.500> different<00:01:10.190> parts<00:01:10.400> of<00:01:10.610> the<00:01:10.670> world

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:10.909 
fans in in different parts of the world

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:13.150 
fans in in different parts of the world
and<00:01:11.300> I<00:01:11.659> think<00:01:11.930> this<00:01:12.050> is<00:01:12.229> one<00:01:12.440> way<00:01:12.619> to<00:01:12.650> get<00:01:13.040> out

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:13.160 
and I think this is one way to get out

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.170 
and I think this is one way to get out
there<00:01:13.400> and<00:01:13.580> and<00:01:14.500> show<00:01:15.500> their<00:01:15.910> shoulder<00:01:16.910> mark

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
there and and show their shoulder mark

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.499 
there and and show their shoulder mark
on<00:01:17.360> the<00:01:17.450> chest<00:01:17.780> and<00:01:18.050> for<00:01:18.950> out<00:01:19.130> for<00:01:19.550> us<00:01:19.670> it's<00:01:19.940> hv

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:20.509 
on the chest and for out for us it's hv

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:23.499 
on the chest and for out for us it's hv
71<00:01:21.140> if<00:01:21.380> we<00:01:21.560> can<00:01:21.770> get<00:01:21.890> out<00:01:22.070> there<00:01:22.310> and<00:01:22.520> and<00:01:22.880> show

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:23.509 
71 if we can get out there and and show

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:25.870 
71 if we can get out there and and show
people<00:01:23.720> around<00:01:23.990> the<00:01:24.290> world<00:01:24.470> that<00:01:24.670> we<00:01:25.670> got<00:01:25.850> a

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
people around the world that we got a

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.700 
people around the world that we got a
good<00:01:26.060> team<00:01:26.119> that<00:01:26.780> might<00:01:26.960> be<00:01:27.110> even<00:01:27.170> more<00:01:27.470> people

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
good team that might be even more people

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.140 
good team that might be even more people
that<00:01:27.979> wants<00:01:28.220> to<00:01:28.310> come<00:01:28.460> and<00:01:28.670> see<00:01:28.759> our<00:01:28.789> games

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.150 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.550 

I<00:01:33.130> can't<00:01:34.130> say<00:01:34.370> I'm<00:01:34.520> an<00:01:34.700> expert<00:01:35.000> in<00:01:35.510> these<00:01:36.380> two

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
I can't say I'm an expert in these two

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.500 
I can't say I'm an expert in these two

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.350 
teams i played in espoo blues a few
years<00:01:38.750> back<00:01:38.990> but<00:01:39.050> a<00:01:39.790> lot<00:01:40.790> of<00:01:40.820> things<00:01:41.060> has

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
years back but a lot of things has

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.540 
years back but a lot of things has
happened<00:01:41.540> since<00:01:41.960> then<00:01:42.230> and<00:01:42.590> I<00:01:42.950> know<00:01:43.220> that

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:43.550 
happened since then and I know that

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.820 
happened since then and I know that
they're<00:01:44.240> better<00:01:44.510> now<00:01:44.660> than<00:01:45.110> there<00:01:45.350> was<00:01:45.530> when<00:01:45.590> i

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:45.830 
they're better now than there was when i

they're better now than there was when i
was<00:01:46.040> there<00:01:46.100> so<00:01:46.730> it's<00:01:47.630> going<00:01:47.810> to<00:01:47.870> be<00:01:48.020> a<00:01:48.050> tough

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:48.290 
was there so it's going to be a tough

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.680 
was there so it's going to be a tough
challenge<00:01:48.650> and<00:01:49.190> we're<00:01:49.670> also<00:01:49.820> playing<00:01:50.150> against

good<00:01:53.540> players<00:01:53.720> down<00:01:54.140> there<00:01:54.410> but<00:01:54.650> I'm<00:01:54.890> I

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
good players down there but I'm I

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.580 
good players down there but I'm I
haven't<00:01:55.730> seen<00:01:55.850> them<00:01:56.030> play<00:01:56.180> so<00:01:56.300> I<00:01:57.110> shouldn't

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
haven't seen them play so I shouldn't

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.700 
haven't seen them play so I shouldn't
say<00:01:57.740> too<00:01:57.800> much<00:01:58.450> I'll<00:01:59.450> have<00:01:59.720> to<00:01:59.990> watch<00:02:00.530> and

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
say too much I'll have to watch and

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.510 
say too much I'll have to watch and
learn<00:02:00.920> when<00:02:01.220> once<00:02:01.580> it<00:02:01.760> gets<00:02:01.940> a<00:02:02.060> little<00:02:02.180> closer
