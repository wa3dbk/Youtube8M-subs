00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:07.200
 Hello and welcome to a nine of the video I really have 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.370
 recorded 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.089
 and now I would like to introduce and introduce some aspects 

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:13.880
 We may have noticed the game lately 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:16.379
 get pretty much negative criticism 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.509
 and I just wanted to convince myself to be own picture 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:20.749
 make of it 

00:00:20.749 --> 00:00:23.009
 furthermore, simply add 

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:25.249
 because you just like the game 

00:00:25.249 --> 00:00:28.800
 for example, it could be in their cocktail with the Torre adapt 

00:00:28.799 --> 00:00:30.099
 change appearance 

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:34.280
 Percent shift on the give or his skills and so too 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:36.480
 to adjust his class 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.480
 to make the appearance editor in my opinion the funniest tool she could 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:42.310
 example 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:45.660
 but change the file or change the pants 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.660
 or to change the color 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:51.650
 Ritchie face painting 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.710
 In addition to give around there are also features Küttel not undo 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.270
 such as the percent tattoos 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:59.769
 or even these 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:02.979
 The killer mushrooms have a great job just for fun 

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:06.979
 I did not pay attention to the crowd or I got well again 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:10.300
 feasible would be the end of successful coach 

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:12.120
 around 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.070
 Georgie Sticken Möhlmann Percent 5 million 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.100
 but sexy fans 8 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:23.290
 and of course, above all else 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:24.310
 especially 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.659
 unique and that of course also makes the damage the TuS 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.380
 Publish your own character can create the only order 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:33.080
 characteristics 

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.650
 which really affect the game are the words however 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:37.560
 body types 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.370
 For example, there are easy means or hard 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:42.970
 around heavy type 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.710
 Hellfeld is quite slow, the easy deep pretty fast manoeuvrable 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:48.780
 in the little out 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.020
 the middle type 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.310
 now a stalemate the middle of it 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.460
 and depending on which percentage of the lot we have just chosen 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.280
 for which also choose different weapons 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.340
 I'm currently elected with fat guy I can he the Maximus 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.960
 the 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.830
 the way to the MTG 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:09.450
 others go straight ahead doing so before he's got the attention of the market before five 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.889
 Years give Lehmann 

00:02:11.889 --> 00:02:14.690
 and as an athlete at that time became 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.059
 some animals or do we take the costs 

00:02:18.059 --> 00:02:21.430
 or as a tip who to get weapons Artest 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:22.959
 just as easier 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.959
 you can never take anything as fat 

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:30.849
 and the middle one in the evening is on those heavy weapons behind the 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:33.989
 Maximus I have a photo APA 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:36.299
 take everything 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:37.650
 and 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.009
 yes so what about me 

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:42.969
 an ounce of the selection bothers me my PS there are relatively many weapons 

00:02:42.969 --> 00:02:45.379
 but they are different from the values 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:47.839
 hardly as the whole have 

00:02:47.839 --> 00:02:52.539
 Assault rifles percent percent and have little difference we have to have 

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:55.029
 have been a few game plays yourself 

00:02:55.029 --> 00:02:57.729
 that does not buy an impact 

00:02:57.729 --> 00:03:00.819
 Ari have bigger impact, however, around the class 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:05.439
 and therefore also the abilities are gladly available there are four classes 

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:07.379
 Ammar teaches the agent 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:11.370
 Percent to the paramedic the soldier and the technician 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:15.729
 Percent each have special skills for example the agent can 

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:16.480
 yourself here 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.390
 around numbers and can turn out to be when Ursula corpse of a percent goes against that 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.810
 he considered himself a percent of Thomann 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.520
 who commutes has recognized me and something great 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:31.050
 Whitehall has parked a coach for the opponent longer and can be comfortable 

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.539
 are looked through by all people here turn adhesive bomb 

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:38.059
 and also my favorite percent is currently not the clothes 

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:41.339
 unlocked red-white Zerbst will become the king's speech cat 

00:03:41.339 --> 00:03:43.169
 is the cortex-a com will 

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:46.109
 if you just crashed 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:47.739
 f2 Dittmann and 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:50.119
 yes, then all the others are dead too 

00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:52.010
 then the technology off 

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.810
 d Arc is going to the Profs can buy his own weapons can be his own 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.609
 Election discarded the fishermen speak 

00:03:57.609 --> 00:03:59.539
 and came in before 

00:03:59.539 --> 00:04:01.960
 Rotterdam also support 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.510
 among other things by the Barth can lay land mines itself in Exter 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:08.780
 Kessler buy every session for themselves can light turret 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.959
 and I'll be very bad faction leadership 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:15.289
 and there Dr is his accomplice 

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:20.180
 what did you have to do to ally Heilmann to revive that here 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.270
 to give more LN percent more life rule option 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.610
 or the replenishment 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.430
 and so the theory is that this energy bar has one 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:32.240
 the soldier 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.390
 so it has Dr Aldag more mentioned Harald the ammunition to a federations 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:40.340
 fill up the 3 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:44.120
 St Battlefield Bad Company 2 can not mediate that though 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.259
 Content times have allowed son 

00:04:46.259 --> 00:04:47.240
 is very exciting 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.250
 can you do the magazine for her? 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:51.599
 Spitzer was the US Open that's no idea 

00:04:51.599 --> 00:04:57.409
 Percent from Russians to Bernama came to Call of Duty Black Ops over the 

00:04:57.409 --> 00:05:00.860
 People titled Package the race the ticker when falling 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:01.850
 Vattenfall 

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:05.020
 let's just drop over in dying so around 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.479
 around 

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:10.689
 yes, and that has filled up his bird 

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:12.779
 There are also general skills 

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:15.940
 the percentages Amag give up the Karl 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:18.629
 in which class Entega which class 

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:19.670
 League played 

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:21.849
 although playing after a long run 

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:23.809
 very important for the game 

00:05:23.809 --> 00:05:26.520
 you'll have to race me for her 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.659
 and that on an indispensable Studer still gives her 

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:32.219
 So guys maximize hot race 

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:35.479
 what you can wish for 

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:38.860
 that would be the day the editor com he to the game itself 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:42.930
 around me have some mission here already played the multiplayer mode 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:44.050
 tried out 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:49.669
 In multiplayer mode I had the problem that many servers around "me 

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:51.809
 are accessible 

00:05:51.809 --> 00:05:54.809
 striking is only true of 16a 

00:05:55.349 --> 00:06:00.029
 when it tasted percent were old server and here 40 of 16 15 of 

00:06:00.029 --> 00:06:00.729
 16 

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:03.349
 and it does not join 

00:06:03.349 --> 00:06:07.179
 although the places were free stood at the departure before fate was full 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:09.430
 To update 

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:12.980
 Euro or 2 4 available but would be fully accessible again 

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:16.500
 So I want to say that I show off the campaign 

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:18.699
 so in the campaign Niqab is a mission 

00:06:18.699 --> 00:06:21.469
 to games nothing other than in multiplayer 

00:06:21.469 --> 00:06:26.689
 Botz thinks about Elinor and, of course, fits in with something in the beginning 

00:06:26.689 --> 00:06:27.750
 Fantasy gets 

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:29.150
 rather XVI 

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:31.949
 while about the game 

00:06:31.949 --> 00:06:36.569
 it is felt that this is for s &amp; p but in the opinion comes the 

00:06:36.569 --> 00:06:36.669
 next
