00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
but unfortunately no confirmation yet

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.500 
but unfortunately no confirmation yet
and<00:00:49.530> it's<00:00:50.160> definitely<00:00:50.520> going<00:00:50.730> to<00:00:50.790> be<00:00:50.850> a<00:00:50.970> later

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
and it's definitely going to be a later

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.210 
and it's definitely going to be a later
than<00:00:51.780> februari<00:00:52.230> could<00:00:52.410> be<00:00:52.530> much<00:00:52.710> later<00:00:52.920> in<00:00:53.100> the

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:53.220 
than februari could be much later in the

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.110 
than februari could be much later in the
year<00:00:53.960> moving<00:00:54.960> along<00:00:55.050> and<00:00:55.410> it<00:00:56.340> looks<00:00:56.579> like<00:00:56.670> it's

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
year moving along and it looks like it's

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.350 
year moving along and it looks like it's
possible<00:00:57.930> that<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.610> pikachu<00:00:59.610> a<00:00:59.790> special

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:00.360 
possible that the pikachu a special

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.950 
possible that the pikachu a special
edition<00:01:00.600> nintendo<00:01:01.410> 3ds<00:01:01.829> XL<00:01:02.450> may<00:01:03.450> eventually

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
edition nintendo 3ds XL may eventually

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.350 
edition nintendo 3ds XL may eventually
or<00:01:04.470> certainly<00:01:05.220> looks<00:01:05.519> like<00:01:05.760> it's<00:01:05.970> going<00:01:06.240> to

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
or certainly looks like it's going to

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.300 
or certainly looks like it's going to
come<00:01:06.600> to<00:01:07.590> the<00:01:08.310> u.s.<00:01:09.350> finally<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:10.830> i'm<00:01:10.979> saying

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
come to the u.s. finally and i'm saying

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.520 
come to the u.s. finally and i'm saying
that<00:01:11.460> because<00:01:11.610> there's<00:01:12.270> been<00:01:12.450> some<00:01:12.810> leaks<00:01:13.320> and

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
that because there's been some leaks and

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.920 
that because there's been some leaks and
rumors<00:01:13.560> that<00:01:14.460> it's<00:01:14.640> coming<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:15.180> chile<00:01:15.570> very

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
rumors that it's coming to chile very

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.130 
rumors that it's coming to chile very
soon<00:01:16.290> and<00:01:16.470> apparently<00:01:17.220> that<00:01:17.430> is<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.690> same

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
soon and apparently that is the same

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.969 
soon and apparently that is the same
3dsxl<00:01:20.100> that<00:01:20.549> goes<00:01:20.850> to<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.780> US<00:01:22.380> or<00:01:22.530> sales<00:01:22.799> in

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
3dsxl that goes to the US or sales in

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.600 
3dsxl that goes to the US or sales in
the<00:01:23.010> US<00:01:23.340> so<00:01:24.150> it's<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.420> same<00:01:24.720> kind<00:01:24.750> of

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
the US so it's the same kind of

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.630 
the US so it's the same kind of
manufacturing<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:26.970> set<00:01:27.960> up<00:01:28.200> for<00:01:28.500> that<00:01:28.710> so<00:01:28.979> the

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
manufacturing and set up for that so the

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.760 
manufacturing and set up for that so the
ones<00:01:29.820> that<00:01:30.000> supply<00:01:30.270> to<00:01:30.330> Chile<00:01:30.720> usually<00:01:31.500> go<00:01:31.710> to

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
ones that supply to Chile usually go to

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.789 
ones that supply to Chile usually go to
the<00:01:32.130> US<00:01:32.310> so<00:01:33.119> it<00:01:33.510> does<00:01:34.110> sound<00:01:34.320> a<00:01:34.380> little<00:01:34.409> bit

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
the US so it does sound a little bit

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.310 
the US so it does sound a little bit
vague<00:01:35.040> and<00:01:35.369> sorry<00:01:35.760> about<00:01:35.909> that<00:01:36.060> but<00:01:36.390> I'm<00:01:36.720> I'm

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
vague and sorry about that but I'm I'm

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.320 
vague and sorry about that but I'm I'm
fairly<00:01:37.650> confident<00:01:38.340> now<00:01:38.549> that<00:01:38.580> it<00:01:38.850> is<00:01:38.880> going<00:01:39.150> to

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:39.330 
fairly confident now that it is going to

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:40.760 
fairly confident now that it is going to
make<00:01:39.479> it<00:01:39.510> to<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.810> US<00:01:40.020> it's<00:01:40.200> been<00:01:40.470> pretty

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:40.770 
make it to the US it's been pretty

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.100 
make it to the US it's been pretty
popular<00:01:41.210> certainly<00:01:42.210> in<00:01:42.299> Japan<00:01:42.630> not<00:01:42.810> quite<00:01:43.020> as

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
popular certainly in Japan not quite as

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.500 
popular certainly in Japan not quite as
popular<00:01:43.320> in<00:01:43.560> Europe<00:01:43.920> but<00:01:44.100> I<00:01:44.520> think<00:01:45.150> they<00:01:45.330> feel

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:45.510 
popular in Europe but I think they feel

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:47.870 
popular in Europe but I think they feel
it's<00:01:45.720> going<00:01:45.869> to<00:01:45.930> be<00:01:46.020> very<00:01:46.049> popular<00:01:46.790> over<00:01:47.790> in

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:47.880 
it's going to be very popular over in

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.969 
it's going to be very popular over in
the<00:01:47.970> States<00:01:48.240> so<00:01:48.330> I<00:01:48.450> don't<00:01:48.930> see<00:01:49.140> any<00:01:49.439> reason<00:01:49.530> now

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
the States so I don't see any reason now

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.190 
the States so I don't see any reason now
why<00:01:50.159> they<00:01:50.310> won't<00:01:50.460> release<00:01:50.670> it<00:01:50.850> so<00:01:51.810> keep<00:01:52.110> your

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
why they won't release it so keep your

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.800 
why they won't release it so keep your
fingers<00:01:52.500> crossed<00:01:52.799> on<00:01:53.400> that<00:01:53.460> one<00:01:53.729> just<00:01:54.330> finally

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
fingers crossed on that one just finally
