00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.230
 What nÃ¡jera 2 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:20.020
 if we compare between what they are good is 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.450
 that we can compare the subject 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.640
 anime with animated sections anime and 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.439
 you know what is the food of the drawings 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.689
 Japanese animations that are drawings 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:32.320
 currently in a doodle 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:33.760
 before, not if we take pictures of the 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.710
 history because it was not happening two but 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.440
 those of now are loaded only those 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:41.110
 scribbles engraved on the egg and it's 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.149
 the manga is so good you want 

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.410
 he painted because there are no scribbles 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:47.530
 linked this welcome from well 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:49.510
 painted is fine of everything except their 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:54.480
 little things and they are less but good at 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.480
 general the manual is well drawn 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:01.640
 as a fact that you should know that 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:05.460
 keep this guy from that anime and 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:07.890
 the manga more than if it was created in japan more 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.170
 that nothing by necessity the command if 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.220
 I want by necessity and is that the manga 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.470
 arose during the later times to 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:19.320
 two nuclear bombs that fell in 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.759
 Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the people are very 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.890
 depressed and was distracted like what 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.180
 let it be and that's where the great genius 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.420
 that right now is not the name 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.190
 astroboy that as you should know was the 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.780
 first sleeve of history instead 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.429
 the cartoons is that simply 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.090
 it's because understanding does not have us 

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:38.340
 a good start plan and I will save 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:42.080
 people the evolution of the sleeves has 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:45.950
 been notorious quite notorious before 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:49.700
 Well, mainly, they had a good 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:52.100
 plot they also had the drawing hobbled 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:54.050
 that yes yes that already I buy it enough in 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.970
 things the drawing 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:59.480
 quite did not have the quality that it has 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:01.460
 sent is clear but what what 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:03.950
 I remember I had was the content 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.140
 plot and all that instead what I 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:09.920
 I feel for the faces that living for the 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:12.020
 manga now the plot has little has 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.080
 little always the truth that they are based on 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:18.230
 services in attracting mine wet 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.660
 panties that wet for him and today all 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.740
 this and that is so you are not going to change it 

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.700
 because it's like that 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:31.550
 the manga is very easy dress up 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:35.099
 service that's why I 'm a fan of the time 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:36.810
 the first of the 2000s and the 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:39.120
 true that good deeds were done and 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.430
 I really like it , I'm from that era 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:44.640
 good in that time of which I see that 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:47.280
 know more about him the cartoons by 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:50.270
 a role as well get worse before if 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:53.380
 we see for example let's go back 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:55.810
 we find for example the 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:58.000
 the spiderman cartoons the 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:01.390
 x-men who were well cured were 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.250
 fine to the comic book and all that and 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.590
 if we remove ourselves from the suv of those that 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.620
 they are based on comics and such good for 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.780
 grayskull example or serve that the truth 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.420
 what is wrong and the little one and my dad 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.590
 common kids whistle something like that too 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.720
 that we had a lot of fun with the little ones 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.670
 on the page and behind there are several 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:22.350
 ninja turtles and all this was flippant 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:26.700
 and such that we now have 'spongebob' 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:26.700
 southern campbell 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:33.040
 for me that the creators were 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:35.620
 bored or plan we do not stay 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:38.860
 in front of to access a series of 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:41.500
 money that we cure everything 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:44.620
 not after and things that do and 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:47.540
 they left because no no directly and 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.700
 is not I do not have 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.379
 good if you stay against these 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:54.349
 things because the same sense does not 

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:56.629
 fun or anything and above people are 

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:58.189

00:03:56.629 --> 00:03:59.599

00:03:58.189 --> 00:04:02.190

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:04.640
 now adventures then still why is it 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:08.430
 apart from there will be two heights is a 

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:10.950
 satire to damages and dragons even up 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:14.970
 the motto slicks up the logo of the series 

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:16.680
 is a dance and dance parody game 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.600
 dragons prsc you have the cop not move 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.750
