00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:41.510 
I think one thing that I noticed and I
certainly<00:04:39.990> wasn't<00:04:40.260> an<00:04:40.410> expectation<00:04:40.830> of<00:04:41.310> mine

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
certainly wasn't an expectation of mine

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.240 
certainly wasn't an expectation of mine

of I think one of the biggest myths is

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:54.310 
of I think one of the biggest myths is
that<00:05:52.200> you<00:05:52.530> know<00:05:52.650> somebody<00:05:52.890> goes<00:05:53.190> to<00:05:53.370> rehab

that you know somebody goes to rehab
they're<00:05:55.320> out<00:05:55.470> in<00:05:55.530> 30<00:05:55.830> days<00:05:56.010> and<00:05:56.040> they're<00:05:56.340> cured
