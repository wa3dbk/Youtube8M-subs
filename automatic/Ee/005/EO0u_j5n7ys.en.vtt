00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:16.000
 hello dear hungry halloween moves 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:17.590
 getting closer 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.539
 The party preparation should be so 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:21.699
 become more concrete and I want to 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:23.800
 contribute to the election of the election again 

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:25.509
 and that's why they are today 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.160
 scary pizza bones 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:29.169
 Apart from the scary one 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.579
 look and feel so bad too 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:31.929
 not you will not have any nightmares 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:33.610
 they get scared of it 

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:35.980
 excellent and i can 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.840
 Imagine that he did not prepare 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.539
 must be limited to halloween 

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.309
 shaped a little different can they 

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:44.859
 certainly also on New Year's Eve or everyone 

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:46.690
 offer a different role than pizza roll 

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:48.460
 She tests the first time to be hell 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.019
 and I hope you will be the same 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.199
 be confident as I need it 

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:57.760
 for very thinly cut salami 

00:00:53.199 --> 00:01:02.019
 Pizza cheese is done by passing tomatoes 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:06.240
 Rectangular pizza dough and some milk 

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:10.120
 to season salt pepper some sugar 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.590
 sweet paprika and pizza spice pizza 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.480
 Spice is really a good mix 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.850
 and i would recommend you this 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.200
 to invest euro 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.350
 if necessary, but could even one 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:22.350
 mixture of thyme oregano basil 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.790
 and create rosemary 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.860
 First we prepare the pizza sauce 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:32.380
 and pass in the passed 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:36.640
 tomatoes from pepper paprika salt one 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:39.040
 pinch sugar and generously from the pizza 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:42.150
 spice everything thoroughly afterwards 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.150
 mix together 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.530
 on a work surface now the 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:48.450
 Roll out pizza dough 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.490
 just leave the paper underneath 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.539
 and then the dough plates in 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.240
 cut stripes 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:56.369
 my pizza dough here is 25 times 42 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.509
 centimeters tall and it comes too 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.329
 not on the centimeter 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:03.689
 I recommend a strike length of approx 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:05.909
 25 to 30 centimeters and a wide 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:08.220
 of at least 5 cm 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.500
 I have chosen your goal with exactly 5 cm 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.420
 and during molding it will be seen 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.910
 Be a bit tight so dear 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.630
 another half an inch 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.120
 then cut to the 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.160
 Give strips of the pizza sauce and 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.340
 this with a spoon or brush 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:25.170
 already only the salami is deleted 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.519
 distribute and the thinner these 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.019
 cut is the better 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:30.780
 because then the bones easier 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:33.590
 Finally, everything can be shaped with the 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.590
 Sprinkle pizza with cheese 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.780
 and now it's a bit 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.310
 Needed fingertip because the 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.980
 dough strips must now long ago 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.530
 rolled up and then applies 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.300
 to tie or knot the ends like this 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.430
 shape these bones 

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:50.569
 similarity arises 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.220
 but that is not so complicated 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:54.670
 and there are no works of art 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.670
 become 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:00.490
 So I have the ends here as one 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:00.490
 Art knot shaped 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.820
 and so we drive until all dough 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.890
 strips are processed and give the 

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:19.300
 molded rog still on with 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:19.300
 Baking paper laid baking tray 

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.710
 then we just give that in one 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:27.020
 bowl or cup add one 

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:31.130
 tablespoon of milk and stir both 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:32.480
 together we cut 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:34.100
 with this egg mixture the 

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:36.170
 prepared a pizza bones 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:38.750
 First of all, they keep you better 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:43.640
 together and second, they shine 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:45.680
 the whole is nice to bake 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:49.370
 Then they also come in the 

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:53.120
 oven at 200 degrees air circulation 180 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.960
 degree for about 15 minutes and that is 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.390
 then the result 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:57.980
 I do not really just see them 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:59.990
 like bones, but also 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.310
 you still do not have to be appetizing 

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:03.470
 if that scare then on the plate 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:05.780
 it reaches from the leftover 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:08.000
 pizza so I sat think that fits 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.800
 Tasty and great 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.990
 can you still around the whole scenario 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:13.310
 something more direct with the 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:14.060
 pizza sauce still a bit blood 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:15.950
 feign 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:18.350
 At least I wish you already now 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:20.600
 Have a successful Halloween party a lot 

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:22.910
 fun in the preparation of these delicious 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:24.860
 scary snacks and then pretty good 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:26.780
 appetite 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:28.430
 if you prefer to halloween 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:30.919
 to put something else on the table 

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:33.080
 maybe wanted monster pops or one 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:35.469
 creepy pudding brain then looks 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:38.000
 but just into these videos 

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:39.199
 you still have to say until the 

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.710
 next time bye 

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:41.710
 bye Bye
