00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.810
 little bit of what the team of 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.730
 motocross 

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:20.460
 all the equipment that we have to 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.130
 have basic equipment really 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:27.300
 indispensable for practicing sports 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:29.910
 first the motocross this 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.640
 it's a sport that is still quite work 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.670
 back is recommended to have a 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.980
 fanny pack use a fanny pack to use it well 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.940
 tight in a way that protects us 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.589
 lumbar and kidneys also when 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.480
 we talk about the whole team of 

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:48.960
 protection we are talking about the boots 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.940
 when we buy together species 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.300
 unthinkable that are very hard of 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:57.540
 in front of this there are also some that 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.850
 they have a heel here a heel on the boot 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.500
 left and right that really for 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.680
 make the change at boot time 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:07.619
 does not start if with the foot on the ground and 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.240
 to gain time tak touches third and 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.220
 makes the change with third and for that 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.830
 bring some special boots there are all 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.200
 type of boots is essential to have 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.770
 socks too big so you do not get 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:24.210
 go to rip off as they say the leg of 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:26.250
 the boot knees knee pads 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.040
 the best ones are those that have the 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.910
 tea 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:33.910
 they take you and hold your thigh not only 

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:35.440
 he manages them but the world is good 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:38.530
 also when we put on the equipment 

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:40.990
 tighten the boots well so that the 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.330
 knee brace do not move to one side to 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:46.479
 another one has to remember that knee pads 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.970
 in motocross are indispensable this 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:51.370
 only by the falls but in the 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:54.460
 motocross is very strong with the 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:56.320
 legs and all the time all the time 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.320
 one is practicing the sport will 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.430
 tightening what is the seat and what 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.500
 it's the motorcycle's chassis 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:04.960
 then do not have good kneepads 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.970
 implies that one is going to be 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.530
 flexing the hitting against the 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:12.730
 structure of the motorbike 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:15.740
 then this one always occupies a chest 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:18.680
 the bib the role of the bib 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:21.230
 really this always gives us 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.300
 protection in case of falls but it is 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:27.080
 indispensable when running in a 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:29.120
 track with doing thus races already to 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.830
 professional level or as a lover 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.710
 running with other runners 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:37.890
 it is always convenient to carry it since 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:39.960
 in a race all the bikes go 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.240
 throwing stones towards the asia towards 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:44.610
 back all the wheels of the bikes 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.890
 front always throwing stones there 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.290
 issues that are of this size and of 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.990
 big that really the chest is for 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.570
 that to avoid that kind of blows in what 

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:56.850
 which is mostly the ribs the 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.710
 sternum and the mouth of the stomach to 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:02.040
 buy a bib we should make sure 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:03.720
 well that we cover at least the mouth of the 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.270
 stomach that one of the most 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.560
 vulnerable that the whole plexus of all 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:11.290
 the chest 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:14.110
 even the chest has this protection 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.910
 Many people use it sideways when in 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.300
 reality must be put towards the 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.220
 front 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:20.590
 this is a protection also for 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.569
 when we are driving, we are not impacted 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:25.579
 the stones this 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:28.280
 our arms and hit us our 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:31.160
 equal bones with the tails or the 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:35.010
 shoulder pads that bring the bib 

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:38.370
 after this we use what is lameness 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.739
 which was what the game of which 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.799
 was to avoid that at the moment of having a 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:46.290
 accident whether we fall from the 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:49.079
 motorcycle and we hit ourselves on the ground or 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:51.810
 we fall and we have fallen very well but it comes 

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:54.930
 a motorcycle and then we crash 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:58.230
 What lameness does is prevent the 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:04:01.190
 second helmet inward towards 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:04.409
 our body and we hurt the cervical 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:06.370
 then really the role of the jeweler 

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:09.700
 is to put 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:12.610
 to the case so that you do not join us and we do not 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:15.240
 go to injure what are the 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:17.550
 cervical 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:20.400
 the collars are of all kinds there 

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:22.830
 of many brands 

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:25.259
 of many functions there are some that go 

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:27.030
 It has the ergonomic shape so that it 

00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:30.479
 goal just inside the front and they're 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:33.780
 more comfortable what is the east helmet 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:35.150
 always looking for helmets with certificate 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:39.390
 two 

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:42.420
 the brands are already recognized bs the 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:44.280
 iphone and ipad there are many brands 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:47.430
 that are already specialized in what is 

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:49.440
 motocross and this is fundamental always 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:51.720
 when we are looking for a helmet that 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:54.470
 have good perspiration that has 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.470
 good way of 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:00.110
 of ventilation have several points of 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.870
 ventilation in the motocross helmets 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:05.360
 especially because it 's a sport that 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:08.240
 demands a lot and also because then for 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:12.259
 avoid fatigue due to overheating 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:14.500
 equal young people young people and 

00:05:12.259 --> 00:05:17.620
 young people there are also many brands 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:21.110
 they are google specialized for motocross 

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:23.330
 you do not have to buy any cole in the 

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:26.449
 sense that they have the depth 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:28.639
 suitable to cushion the blows of 

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:32.660
 the stones that we talked about has 

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:36.319
 This is also the right fabric for 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:38.539
 surroundings for this favor a 

00:05:36.319 --> 00:05:40.540
 good ventilation and that we are not going to 

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:43.760
 tarnish 

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:47.120
 then the referrals we refer to 

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:49.190
 this cloth to this sponge that is here 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:51.090
 in the surroundings it is special for 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:55.160
 avoid this 

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:55.160
 that does not miss much 

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:59.520
 not much wind that we go to 

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:02.220
 dry eyes but neither 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:03.510
 block ventilation and packaging 

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:06.090
 the colors 

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:09.450
 also the motocross goggles bring 

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:12.720
 are these brooches here on the side or 

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:15.990
 another and this one can be put colors 

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:17.820
 to improve the vision to have 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:20.310
 a clearer vision to avoid the 

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:22.260
 jubeto rays these are accessories that are 

00:06:20.310 --> 00:06:24.600
 these pins change from those that 

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:26.090
 we talked are also indispensable in 

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:28.680
 the motocross since it allows us 

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:31.350
 buy and adapt the screens to the 

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:34.470
 cables so that when we go 

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:36.840
 running we were going to a race in a day 

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:39.180
 it has rained that the conditions of the 

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:42.510
 track are wet either by your watering 

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:45.360
 because there was rain this we adapted some 

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:47.880
 special plastics we are running and 

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:49.680
 so as not to overshadow the look we only remove 

00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:53.360
 that plastic that would be like 

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:55.849
 windshield of a car of a vehicle 

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:59.270
 that's basically what the team is 

00:06:55.849 --> 00:07:01.400
 of motor is fundamental we forget the 

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:03.500
 gloves with gloves are gloves 

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:05.509
 Special sources that allow to ventilate 

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:07.550
 very good hand gloves that have 

00:07:05.509 --> 00:07:10.969
 enough grip to control the 

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:15.050
 hands and basically the game is 

00:07:10.969 --> 00:07:17.120
 what is the hips the elbows this 

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:21.159
 they are very good hips that hold 

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:21.159
 well from the upper arm 

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:29.350
 inside and outside because of a 

00:07:26.230 --> 00:07:31.720
 fall because damaging it will not damage the 

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:34.570
 uniform shirt is also what 

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:37.390
 is the pants and what is the shirt that 

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:39.169
 They are highly breathable fabrics if 

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:41.659
 means 

00:07:39.169 --> 00:07:43.759
 the same pants come with everything 

00:07:41.659 --> 00:07:46.219
 this that is ventilation come with a 

00:07:43.759 --> 00:07:49.129
 Special fabric that favors the grip with 

00:07:46.219 --> 00:07:52.689
 the bike and that's basically all the 

00:07:49.129 --> 00:07:52.689
 all the motocross team
