before I add the filling so I can

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:42.610 
before I add the filling so I can
already<00:04:40.310> start<00:04:41.180> taking<00:04:41.930> my<00:04:42.110> egg<00:04:42.380> that's

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:46.790 
the center and you can see every time I

00:04:46.790 --> 00:05:09.519 
the center and you can see every time I
do<00:04:46.940> that<00:04:48.610> my<00:04:49.610> raw<00:04:49.820> egg<00:04:50.120> fills<00:04:50.450> in<00:04:50.600> the<00:04:50.720> crack

00:05:09.519 --> 00:05:09.529 

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:20.410 

a<00:05:09.589> little<00:05:10.279> seasoning<00:05:10.459> of<00:05:10.849> black<00:05:11.599> pepper

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:20.420 

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:22.910 

so<00:05:21.420> I'm<00:05:21.510> almost<00:05:21.750> to<00:05:22.200> the<00:05:22.230> point<00:05:22.470> where<00:05:22.740> I've

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:22.920 
so I'm almost to the point where I've

00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:25.610 
so I'm almost to the point where I've
cooked<00:05:23.640> the<00:05:23.880> majority<00:05:24.300> of<00:05:24.330> the<00:05:24.420> egg<00:05:24.620> probably

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620 
cooked the majority of the egg probably

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:42.290 
cooked the majority of the egg probably
80<00:05:25.800> to<00:05:25.920> 90%<00:05:26.250> of<00:05:26.520> the<00:05:26.610> way<00:05:40.280> and<00:05:41.280> still<00:05:41.970> on<00:05:42.120> low

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:42.300 
80 to 90% of the way and still on low

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.870 
80 to 90% of the way and still on low
heat<00:05:42.510> I'm<00:05:42.660> going<00:05:42.810> to<00:05:42.870> add<00:05:43.080> some<00:05:43.860> of<00:05:44.010> my<00:05:44.040> mixture

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:44.880 
heat I'm going to add some of my mixture

00:05:44.880 --> 00:06:00.189 
heat I'm going to add some of my mixture
here

00:06:00.189 --> 00:06:00.199 

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:18.640 

and<00:06:01.199> then<00:06:01.379> grading<00:06:01.800> some<00:06:02.009> Jack<00:06:02.610> cheese

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:18.650 

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:21.159 

all<00:06:19.250> right<00:06:19.460> so<00:06:19.639> now<00:06:19.790> is<00:06:20.060> the<00:06:20.210> trick<00:06:20.419> to<00:06:20.449> fold<00:06:21.050> it

00:06:21.159 --> 00:06:21.169 
all right so now is the trick to fold it

00:06:21.169 --> 00:06:22.719 
all right so now is the trick to fold it
over<00:06:21.290> and<00:06:21.560> present<00:06:22.100> it<00:06:22.310> we're<00:06:22.460> gonna<00:06:22.550> serve<00:06:22.699> it

00:06:22.719 --> 00:06:22.729 
over and present it we're gonna serve it

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:24.820 
over and present it we're gonna serve it
with<00:06:22.850> our<00:06:23.060> avocado<00:06:23.449> salsa<00:06:23.690> this<00:06:24.530> should<00:06:24.740> take

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:24.830 
with our avocado salsa this should take

00:06:24.830 --> 00:06:26.950 
with our avocado salsa this should take
about<00:06:24.889> another<00:06:25.280> minute<00:06:25.639> and<00:06:25.790> we'll<00:06:26.780> come<00:06:26.930> back

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:26.960 
about another minute and we'll come back

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:41.829 
about another minute and we'll come back
to<00:06:27.199> that

00:06:41.829 --> 00:06:41.839 

00:06:41.839 --> 00:06:46.239 

all<00:06:42.839> right<00:06:42.930> a<00:06:42.960> little<00:06:43.110> bit<00:06:43.199> of<00:06:43.259> avocado<00:06:43.319> salsa
