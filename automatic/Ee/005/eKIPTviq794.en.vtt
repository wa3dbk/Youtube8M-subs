00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:11.810
 pistols rum 

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:13.550
 on the distance, however, gorgeous 

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:15.290
 not in counterstrike or counter 

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:17.390
 strike source but in the newest 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:20.360
 lark counter strike global offensive 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:23.480
 the value at the small developer hidden 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:25.460
 Path in order has given her heart 

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.990
 know one or the other audience 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.439
 maybe even as the makers of 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:33.650
 defense grid at counter-strike global 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:35.450
 offensive or short cs go is about it 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.430
 At the core of exactly what we already 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:40.010
 from the original or counter strike 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.960
 However, source knows every pass 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.149
 and then throw here and there to the 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.949
 details rumgeschraubt and not only 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:52.820
 a new boardwalk like here on the 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:55.370
 but even new game modes added in 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.899
 menu of cs go we can now under 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.090
 choose various things 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:01.670
 at the bottom classic competition 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.199
 behind it hides the classic 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.180
 in which we compete 

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:07.340
 So team members can join 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.740
 friendly fire in which we armor ourselves 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.530
 you have to buy and pipapo you know 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.780
 and then we choose what we are looking for 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.610
 So they want to play bombs or go hostage 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.770
 scenario or simply the 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.590
 Most classic of all cards namely that 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:24.290
 and from there the game searches automatically 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.060
 a part for us out with that 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.710
 automatic search works well with the 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.659
 other game options further 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.689
 destructions and classic 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:35.689
 Opportunities Verdi car assignment 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:38.420
 selects automatically lands on top of that 

00:01:35.689 --> 00:01:40.759
 an official server who does not want to 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.950
 on auto assignment has the attacks 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:45.140
 the server browser to the man behind 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.969
 the term community server finds 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.130
 small warning still that it on the 

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:51.280
 community servers are different than those on the 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:54.860
 can go to official and then 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:56.180
 but choose half-hanged what hides 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.610
 actually behind this 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.840
 other game options such as 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.890
 so ok, first of all, then 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.700
 The equivalent of counter strike 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:09.440
 source mod gun game two teams shoot 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.190
 on a manageable crater 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.920
 on each other 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:16.200
 okay, there is a new weapon 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.209
 unlike the classic game is rising 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.720
 Immediately after a death and again 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:24.239
 the player who is the first to have all the weapons 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:26.730
 through violence wins as fast 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:29.970
 schmidt short stopovers 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.470
 actually excellent destruction 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.989
 however, it can be used as a mixture 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.340
 from classic bombing scenario and 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:37.410
 describe the weather 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.510
 the terrorists have to bomb 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.080
 the anti terrorists have to do this 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.269
 prevent 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:44.880
 do one in a round one or 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:47.670
 several enemies heat in the wake 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.440
 Round a new weapon destruction yet 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.600
 especially fun because you are 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:55.680
 thanks to the new weapons always a new one 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:57.420
 challenge facing and now 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.850
 to the classic modes and the 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.340
 distinguished source and the original 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.860
 the card design would be the one behind 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.840
 drives here and there has changed so 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.900
 for example, the already mentioned 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:11.670
 holzsteg on the or here the missing 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:15.660
 Water access at the start of the 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:18.239
 terrorists on Edgetech also purchase 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:20.010
 menu can win out differently of course 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:22.440
 one imagines everything according as we 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.630
 key shortcuts into the inventory rumble 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.100
 but with the mouse's on the circle 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.620
 art almost as fast 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:31.530
 In addition, the two now feels like 

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.000
 Aeons even humans around 7 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.670
 have enough time 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.920
 who has just looked exactly 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:40.700
 have noticed the new brand grenade 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:43.380
 with the and the terrorist condor 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:45.900
 Molotov cocktail is delicious and delicious 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:48.450
 dangerous flames rugs are new 

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.670
 Also grate the bait for a few 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:53.280
 seconds of fighting caused noise and 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.000
 wet research online soldiers in the trap 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.030
 should lure 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.560
 but if that works out well now 

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.380
 but canned 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.540
 how does it look like with what cs 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.780
 Lamb bound interested namely that 

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:09.160
 with the shoot and 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:12.370
 so meet as an old cs player thinks 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:14.310
 you go in cs go sometimes in one 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:17.139
 situation like this one for example 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:19.299
 actually a sure headshot though 

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:22.570
 either there's a 50 year 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:24.280
 texture 70 already in the way or something 

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:27.070
 more likely we still have ourselves 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:29.410
 not as strewing behave the ak 47 in 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:31.360
 cs go accustomed to the scatter namely 

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:33.639
 noticeably different than in zoos or the 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:36.090
 original that against the rest not only for 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:38.410
 the ak but also for other weapons 

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:40.840
 this is also the new high 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:42.610
 dynamic crosshairs nothing the man 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:43.950
 however, the classic is on 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:47.140
 can exchange 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:48.850
 the hit boxes fall into the esc too 

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:51.940
 smaller and this damned side 

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:53.860
 Armor noticeably better where you go into 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.540
 house somebody fixum can you have to 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:59.110
 in cs go often a felt 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:01.330
 ammo camps are making a change 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.790
 which seems awesome for everyone 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:06.190
 and the awb can not handle it and it 

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:08.410
 fit if others can but the 

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:10.479
 crosshairs of the sniper boom 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:14.350
 become blurred during a movement 

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:15.790
 but also someone with the awb right 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:18.529
 Bother then can also bother 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:21.019
 Blur effect is not 

00:05:18.529 --> 00:05:27.589
 should be called the always funny 

00:05:21.019 --> 00:05:29.539
 name esther is also available in cs go before 

00:05:27.589 --> 00:05:30.939
 We now turn to the technology yet 

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:33.499
 fast the classic 

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:35.569
 deals dealt deal that comes 

00:05:33.499 --> 00:05:37.579
 as usual with bombs and hostage 

00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:40.159
 scenarios, however, in the 

00:05:37.579 --> 00:05:42.979
 example variant it lacks the team 

00:05:40.159 --> 00:05:44.989
 collision armor and defuse skip 

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:46.939
 You do not have to buy and you can go 

00:05:44.989 --> 00:05:48.619
 deny all fellow players and not only 

00:05:46.939 --> 00:05:49.509
 the truly from their own victory 

00:05:48.619 --> 00:05:52.009
 shoulder look 

00:05:49.509 --> 00:05:53.929
 on top of that, it's in the classic 

00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:56.599
 the zeus still play 

00:05:53.929 --> 00:05:58.399
 Electro sebha who only once himself and 

00:05:56.599 --> 00:06:01.489
 then the enemy is over if you have 

00:05:58.399 --> 00:06:02.869
 Well, he met him and that 

00:06:01.489 --> 00:06:05.119
 it was already what you to 

00:06:02.869 --> 00:06:07.509
 classic occasion game knowledge 

00:06:05.119 --> 00:06:07.509
 got to 

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:16.260
 on the technical side is counter 

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:17.760
 strike global offensive appropriate man 

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:19.230
 has the cards and the models in the 

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:22.290
 Compared to source clearly 

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:25.590
 aufgehübscht but at the animations is 

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:26.820
 if then only a little happened bomb 

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:30.320
 defuse still looks 

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:32.820
 not to defuse it after bombs 

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:34.890
 Here and there, too, the shadows fell 

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:36.200
 for example, on office in the 

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:39.420
 office vacate 

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:40.650
 but hey that's counter strike it has to 

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:45.260
 do not look nice 

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:45.260
 still nice if I did that 

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:51.630
 who the original and counter-strike 

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:54.330
 source has eagerly played itself 

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:56.250
 first change a little if that 

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:58.830
 happened counter strike makes global 

00:06:56.250 --> 00:07:00.930
 offensive again just as much fun as 

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:02.610
 the other parts and the new modes 

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:04.980
 care for a little bit, too 

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:08.010
 very humorous diversion in bombs 

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:09.660
 hostage who have never been a counter 

00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:11.630
 strike has played well now 

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:15.250
 access and if only 

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:18.320
 to find out what the highest one is talking about 

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:20.720
 but be careful in counter-strike global 

00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:22.970
 offensive shoot so many again 

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:27.100
 Cracks that sometimes quite blümerant 

00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:27.100
 Nobody can be silent so often
