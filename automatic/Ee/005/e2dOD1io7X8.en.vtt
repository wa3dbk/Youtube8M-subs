00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.610
 the company is today blacksmiths 

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:08.790
 therefore in the plain area attisani manages the largest landfill 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.709
 we can say of italy indeed to find useless advanced technology you can 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:15.769
 say the most important of europe 

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:19.230
 the sinner saw a green lawn just now 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.400
 this green meadow rises above the garbage 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.710
 but how does a landfill talk about it with bernardo announcement that the 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.830
 disposal manager yes good morning 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:37.560
 the journey arrives what happens to the success is arrested at the balance deco 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:42.040
 a list is augusta and private municipal is pounded by our balance 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.200
 after the weight thumb 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.670
 since we are not in an emergency situation 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.620
 and they cannot all be disposed of under the compaction shed 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:55.890
 c'abbiamo 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.780
 then it is disposed of sol municipality of Naples min 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.780
 king with this technology true compaction 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.939
 then it is unloaded into the shed is placed 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.520
 urban solid waste 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.480
 then through telepass conveyor belts, fan of the hoppers 

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:19.080
 where it is compressed compacted and transformed into a valley 

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.020
 monvalle weighing about 10 quintals owning 

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:27.220
 age of angel we understand that 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.870
 if one cubic meter more than lifting 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.360
 brawl between 200 and 300 TVs 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.560
 a cubic meter god and refuse to contact you weighs 10 quintals 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.560
 so let me imagine 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.799
 volume recovery is a momentary snapshot of children 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.479
 that you are depressed seeing the spaces that here were some columns that 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.479
 they are in this room to you and what is it for what it is 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.740
 et ariane are so many different deodorant so that 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.810
 you don't feel a bad smell that practically produces solid waste 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:08.359
 urban 

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:13.900
 first time, you too, these trunk of solid urban waste 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.190
 they were then placed in this sixth dump 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.310
 they are placed in landfills with special vehicles 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.129
 forklift mechanical shovels 

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:23.709
 that we have 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:27.890
 that are arranged and issued next to each other on the motorcycle to be recovered 

00:02:27.889 --> 00:02:31.569
 as much space as possible and why arrange these tarps 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:36.890
 colors tarpaulins are fingernail steps from special in HDPE 

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:41.769
 that we don't put down at the bottom of the continuous dump 

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:45.909
 and at the bottom of the cellar either 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:49.739
 built a reinforced concrete tank 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:54.040
 even the leachate with some holes and sides moving 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:57.519
 that bradycardic rainwater between it 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:00.219
 urban solid waste gets dirty 

00:03:00.219 --> 00:03:01.790
 s yet 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.810
 it is not stopped at the bottom of the basin crosses the Elba ground in the aquifers 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:07.849
 water-bearing 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:10.119
 polluting groundwater 

00:03:10.119 --> 00:03:12.609
 then these issues are settled 

00:03:12.609 --> 00:03:15.689
 this reinforced concrete paste 

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:20.449
 that tender cooked leachate in this cost reinforced concrete slabs this 

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:22.119
 percolators n 

00:03:22.119 --> 00:03:24.589
 aspirated with tips 

00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:28.659
 passed through a water purification plant that we have only 

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:31.789
 us here in italy 

00:03:31.789 --> 00:03:35.659
 in an italy in the dumps we say 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:41.629
 and then it is released known posture or on solid urban waste in order to 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:43.179
 to accelerate 

00:03:43.179 --> 00:03:45.839
 the process of 

00:03:45.839 --> 00:03:47.740
 biogas transformation 

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:52.700
 let us now see the reprehensible strains of you who aspire to this garbage like 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:53.879
 I used it 

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:56.149
 how this transformation takes place 

00:03:56.149 --> 00:03:59.549
 since then we yet hahaha exhausted landfill 

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:02.350
 prefecture model drilling 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:04.859
 about 30 40 meters 

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:09.299
 we put perforated tubes and suck through these wells 

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:14.650
 lowers biogas pressure and produces solid waste beaten by more than 

00:04:14.649 --> 00:04:16.309
 urban solids 

00:04:16.309 --> 00:04:18.159
 then through pipelines 

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:20.250
 helloween let's put in the karst 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.229
 td 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:23.930
 contacts 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:27.699
 where low pressure is sucked in by the turbochargers 

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:31.999
 doveee later 

00:04:31.999 --> 00:04:37.719
 they are immersed in a single compression where the violase is understood 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:41.279
 which is sent to the central office 

00:04:41.279 --> 00:04:45.559
 the power plant that we have had in us for years has nothing to do with it 

00:04:45.559 --> 00:04:47.249
 power plant 

00:04:47.249 --> 00:04:49.400
 to use for your travels 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:55.720
 in addition to our systems, our technical engineer masks 

00:04:56.969 --> 00:05:00.419
 like how it happens as it can be used differently years 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:04.629
 mayday viewers have heard of solid waste biomass 

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:05.250
 urban 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:09.810
 but the environment air circumstances surrounding this landfill 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:13.169
 suffers some damage we say which one to do the reality 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:17.930
 new reality that Constantin environments can also see the moon image 

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:21.559
 I don't see any damage to the environments 

00:05:21.559 --> 00:05:25.089
 no damage to the underlying aquifers 

00:05:25.089 --> 00:05:29.119
 we have daily checks from the government offices 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:33.339
 and will train 

00:05:33.339 --> 00:05:37.569
 we have morning assilt ux controls 

00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:40.060
 that they found absolutely nothing 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:44.070
 doctoral student we have seen this beautiful meadow these and these 

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:45.700
 seedlings these saplings that 

00:05:45.700 --> 00:05:49.900
 they are born right at the edge of the landfill and then even the 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:53.840
 possibilities that you are making of a welcome in a soccer field that 

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:57.199
 means that kids can come here and breathe the fresh air 

00:05:57.199 --> 00:05:59.000
 quietly it shows 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.460
 from the images then also the 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:03.710
 if the nose vessel camera 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:08.749
 hotel atlantis nn you feel - Italians for how many municipalities served of Campania 

00:06:08.749 --> 00:06:11.749
 ke $ ha and water per day 

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:18.270
 the government forced us to his style and 80% of the 

00:06:19.339 --> 00:06:22.879
 campaign solid urban waste unfortunately for us who we were 

00:06:22.879 --> 00:06:25.879
 accustomed to in 1800 tons. 

00:06:26.779 --> 00:06:28.020
 however it seems that 

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:29.800
 we did pretty well
