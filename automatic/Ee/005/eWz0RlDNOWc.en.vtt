00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.560
 seeing what is the big problem of the 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:09.420
 life and of course we are going to look for a 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.889
 solution before you start that limit you 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.300

 self-help and personal growth all 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.050
 at some point in our life we 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.640
 we face with this problem some 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.130
 people solve us while 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.109
 others are not aware that it exists and 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.910
 therefore you never get to fix it 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.220
 and they live with a weight on their backs that 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.320
 it makes them feel frustrated and unhappy 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.969
 they want to know what is the problem here 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.770
 in this video you will discover the 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.700
 growth and evolution is part 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.920
 of our nature 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:40.890
 if you are not growing they are dying 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.960
 each person interprets that desire to be 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.120
 better and evolve from different 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.219
 ways for ones is to have more money and 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.289
 material things others do through 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.690
 of your body wanting it to be 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.640
 thin and perfect some others seek 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.610
 a growth and spiritual evolution 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.309
 for other people is to have some 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.320
 satisfactory personal relationships and 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.359
 many others seek growth 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.780
 integral in any of the cases 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.720
 there is always a deep desire 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:11.570
 when growing all this in theory is very 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:14.000
 well however it is at this point in 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:17.119
 where is the big problem of 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.060
 life when you want or want to be created 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:23.000
 a feeling that means there is a 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:25.940
 lack and that lack carries with it the 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.649
 pain of not possessing what you want like that 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:31.130
 that the great problem of life is 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:33.320
 want to want to expect something from someone or 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.390
 expect something to happen I imagine that 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.000
 Now you are wondering then 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.979
 I give the solution to the problem of the great 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.020
 problem of life is simply not 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:44.330
 want nothing I answer you the opposite 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:47.720
 our nature is to grow to evolve 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:50.509
 and this implies a wanting to be better is the 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:52.490
 secret is love without wanting you 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:54.860
 confused still watching the video very 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.479
 well let's get into how to solve the great 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.819
 problem of life three steps 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:00.890
 specific step number one that you want 

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:02.869
 although it sounds contradictory it is very 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.819
 important that you begin to dream what is 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:06.530
 your dream that you want to be that you want 

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:08.989
 have with whom you want to be 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.459
 what things you want to do give yourself a couple 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:12.350
 of hours and responds to all 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:14.120
 questions with sincerity know 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:16.550
 you want is a key piece to be able 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.800
 change your life completely remember if 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.960
 you do not know where you are going any way 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:23.780
 serves step number 2 that you have to do 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:25.400
 at the moment of knowing what things you have 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.070
 what to do to achieve what he wants 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.100
 search question investigates and defines 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:32.930
 exactly the actions attitudes 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.880
 habits behaviors and ways of 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.220
 think necessary to achieve what 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.200
 you want this attitude has to be accompanied 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:42.320
 on your way they will always keep 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.870
 hungry stay alert 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:47.120
 awake you never know where or when 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.310
 You can find the piece you're missing 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.470
 to achieve your goals very well step 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.750
 number 3 is the detachment to the result without 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.640
 doubt this step is more important is here 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.620
 where the secret of the 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.590
 manifestation of your wishes in reality 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.900
 the detachment result is an attitude of 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:05.630
 Do not wait for any results and at the same time 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:08.240
 feel satisfied to have achieved 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:10.700
 I repeat the detachment the result is a 

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:12.920
 attitude of not expecting any result and 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:15.410
 at the same time feel satisfied that you have 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.630
 think about it if you had not succeeded 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.830
 what you want how you would feel that 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.320
 feeling is what 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:23.270
 of keeping you've seen the big problem and 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:26.060
 the solution at the beginning we talked about 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:28.100
 that we all want something and that we want to 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.110
 being a feeling of lack implies 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.360
 a true pain now you still want 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:34.580
 but with a feeling of satisfaction 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:37.100
 and detachment has resulted continues to progress 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:39.170
 towards your goals and dreams but with a 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.510
 different attitude when you have this 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:43.610
 attitude lives happy and at peace and when 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.530
 unless you expect it, you were living your 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:47.510
 dream many people hope to achieve what 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.040
 they want to be happy and the truth 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.690
 is that to achieve what you want 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.730
 first you have to be happy 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:55.130
