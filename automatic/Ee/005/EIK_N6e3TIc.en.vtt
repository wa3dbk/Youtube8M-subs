00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:34.850 
recipes so let's start first heat up a

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.129 
recipes so let's start first heat up a
pan<00:00:35.059> preferably<00:00:35.719> a<00:00:36.079> wok<00:00:37.089> so<00:00:38.089> once<00:00:38.539> the<00:00:38.719> wok<00:00:38.960> is

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:39.139 
pan preferably a wok so once the wok is

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:42.639 
pan preferably a wok so once the wok is
nice<00:00:39.379> and<00:00:39.620> hot<00:00:39.889> let's<00:00:40.879> add<00:00:41.089> oil<00:00:41.510> now<00:00:42.319> shares

00:00:42.639 --> 00:00:42.649 
nice and hot let's add oil now shares

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:45.669 
nice and hot let's add oil now shares
Wan<00:00:42.889> sauce<00:00:43.839> takes<00:00:44.839> in<00:00:45.019> a<00:00:45.049> little<00:00:45.409> more<00:00:45.649> oil

Wan sauce takes in a little more oil

00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:49.599 
Wan sauce takes in a little more oil
because<00:00:46.489> oil<00:00:46.819> acts<00:00:47.659> as<00:00:47.839> a<00:00:47.870> preservative<00:00:48.609> so

00:00:49.599 --> 00:00:49.609 
because oil acts as a preservative so

00:00:49.609 --> 00:00:51.219

could saute garlic till it is nice and
light<00:01:32.090> brown<00:01:32.420> because<00:01:33.079> the<00:01:33.409> rawness<00:01:33.679> of<00:01:33.979> the

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
light brown because the rawness of the

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.569 
light brown because the rawness of the
garlic<00:01:34.399> has<00:01:34.429> to<00:01:34.729> go<00:01:34.880> now<00:01:35.299> we<00:01:35.359> will<00:01:35.749> add<00:01:36.579> red

00:01:37.569 --> 00:01:37.579

garlic has to go now we will add red
chili<00:01:37.880> paste<00:01:38.450> to<00:01:38.960> this<00:01:39.429> now<00:01:40.429> it<00:01:40.549> depends<00:01:40.969> upon

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
chili paste to this now it depends upon

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.870 
chili paste to this now it depends upon
how<00:01:41.359> spicy<00:01:41.780> you<00:01:42.140> want<00:01:42.170> your<00:01:42.590> sauce<00:01:42.859> you<00:01:43.700> can

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:43.880 
how spicy you want your sauce you can

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.219 
how spicy you want your sauce you can
add<00:01:44.030> your<00:01:44.210> chili<00:01:44.780> paste

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
add your chili paste

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:47.319 
add your chili paste
that's<00:01:45.859> it<00:01:46.100> I'm<00:01:46.249> not<00:01:46.369> making<00:01:46.640> it<00:01:46.789> very<00:01:46.999> spicy

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:47.329 
that's it I'm not making it very spicy

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:49.989 
that's it I'm not making it very spicy
because<00:01:47.659> kids<00:01:48.590> also<00:01:48.799> like<00:01:49.130> choose<00:01:49.520> one<00:01:49.700> sauce

00:01:49.989 --> 00:01:49.999 
because kids also like choose one sauce

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:52.480 
because kids also like choose one sauce
so<00:01:50.929> in<00:01:51.049> that<00:01:51.259> case<00:01:51.560> we<00:01:51.859> need<00:01:51.890> to<00:01:52.069> make<00:01:52.310> it<00:01:52.460> a

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
so in that case we need to make it a

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.520 
so in that case we need to make it a
little<00:01:52.609> less<00:01:52.880> spicy<00:01:53.450> so<00:01:53.780> you<00:01:53.840> have<00:01:54.049> to<00:01:54.200> saute

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
little less spicy so you have to saute

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.709 
little less spicy so you have to saute
this<00:01:54.859> till<00:01:55.159> all<00:01:55.399> the<00:01:55.609> oil<00:01:55.789> separate<00:01:56.359> like<00:01:56.600> you

00:01:56.709 --> 00:01:56.719 
this till all the oil separate like you

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:59.349 
this till all the oil separate like you
see<00:01:56.960> here<00:01:57.200> the<00:01:57.619> oil<00:01:57.649> is<00:01:58.130> separating<00:01:58.759> and<00:01:58.939> Moro

00:01:59.349 --> 00:01:59.359 
see here the oil is separating and Moro

00:01:59.359 --> 00:02:01.870 
see here the oil is separating and Moro
because<00:01:59.810> I've<00:01:59.929> used<00:02:00.109> a<00:02:00.289> nonstick<00:02:00.740> pan<00:02:00.880> I'm

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
because I've used a nonstick pan I'm

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:36.840 
looking just like the bottle shares one
sauce<00:03:31.440> now<00:03:32.440> you<00:03:32.500> check<00:03:32.800> seasoning<00:03:34.830> so<00:03:35.850> let's
