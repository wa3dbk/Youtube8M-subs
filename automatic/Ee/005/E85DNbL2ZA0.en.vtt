00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:33.600 
blocks of wood right here then it hit so

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:36.110 
blocks of wood right here then it hit so
it<00:06:33.690> gives<00:06:33.810> it<00:06:33.960> the<00:06:34.110> real<00:06:34.290> based<00:06:35.010> effects<00:06:35.729> in

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:56.660 
which is awesome I thinking the cord was

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:58.900 
which is awesome I thinking the cord was
obviously<00:06:57.200> where<00:06:58.100> the<00:06:58.220> regular<00:06:58.550> drum<00:06:58.700> time

00:06:58.900 --> 00:06:58.910 
obviously where the regular drum time

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:01.540 
obviously where the regular drum time
ago<00:06:59.180> so<00:06:59.660> I<00:06:59.930> hope<00:07:00.260> that<00:07:00.590> answers<00:07:00.770> some<00:07:01.340> of<00:07:01.400> your

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:03.590 
questions on how to make it we're going

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:04.990 
questions on how to make it we're going
to<00:07:03.650> come<00:07:03.770> out<00:07:03.830> the<00:07:04.010> tutorial<00:07:04.490> I<00:07:04.580> know<00:07:04.640> I<00:07:04.730> said

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:05.000 
to come out the tutorial I know I said

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.820 
to come out the tutorial I know I said
that<00:07:05.030> a<00:07:05.180> long<00:07:05.270> time<00:07:05.420> ago<00:07:05.690> but<00:07:06.440> will<00:07:06.590> come<00:07:06.710> out

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:06.830 
that a long time ago but will come out

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:09.610 
that a long time ago but will come out
with<00:07:06.920> a<00:07:06.980> tutorial<00:07:07.250> how<00:07:07.640> to<00:07:07.670> make<00:07:07.970> it<00:07:08.120> it's<00:07:08.620> to

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:09.620 
with a tutorial how to make it it's to

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:11.620 
with a tutorial how to make it it's to
make<00:07:09.740> the<00:07:09.920> whole<00:07:10.100> thing<00:07:10.130> probably<00:07:10.910> ranges

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:11.630 
make the whole thing probably ranges

00:07:11.630 --> 00:07:14.860 
make the whole thing probably ranges
from<00:07:11.780> anywhere<00:07:12.140> in<00:07:12.290> 70<00:07:12.710> to<00:07:13.420> 100<00:07:14.420> bucks<00:07:14.630> going

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:14.870 
from anywhere in 70 to 100 bucks going

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:17.800 
from anywhere in 70 to 100 bucks going
the<00:07:15.020> highest<00:07:15.410> which<00:07:15.920> are<00:07:16.790> so<00:07:17.060> is<00:07:17.150> probably<00:07:17.540> net

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:17.810 
the highest which are so is probably net

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:21.430 
the highest which are so is probably net
cost<00:07:18.050> of<00:07:18.290> 80<00:07:18.710> to<00:07:19.460> make<00:07:19.610> pill<00:07:19.880> so<00:07:20.690> we'll<00:07:21.230> try<00:07:21.380> to

00:07:21.430 --> 00:07:21.440 
cost of 80 to make pill so we'll try to

00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:22.690 
cost of 80 to make pill so we'll try to
get<00:07:21.560> that<00:07:21.710> video<00:07:21.860> out<00:07:22.010> to<00:07:22.250> you<00:07:22.340> guys<00:07:22.370> but
