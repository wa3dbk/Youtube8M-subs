00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
wire I have some crimps with a loop and

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.530 
wire I have some crimps with a loop and
then<00:01:16.979> I<00:01:17.250> just<00:01:17.460> have<00:01:17.640> an<00:01:17.759> earring<00:01:18.090> hook<00:01:18.299> and<00:01:18.329> a

to<00:01:23.070> do<00:01:23.189> is<00:01:25.159> measure<00:01:26.159> a<00:01:26.369> piece<00:01:26.700> of<00:01:27.000> beading<00:01:27.689> wire

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
to do is measure a piece of beading wire

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:43.030 
to do is measure a piece of beading wire
three<00:01:28.380> and<00:01:28.469> a<00:01:28.500> half<00:01:28.619> inches<00:01:28.920> long

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:43.040 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.430 

and<00:01:43.580> then<00:01:43.700> I'm<00:01:43.820> gonna<00:01:44.030> actually<00:01:44.270> go<00:01:44.720> ahead<00:01:45.230> and

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.440 
and then I'm gonna actually go ahead and

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.620 
and then I'm gonna actually go ahead and
crimp<00:01:45.650> one<00:01:45.860> of<00:01:45.950> my<00:01:46.070> loops<00:01:46.340> onto<00:01:47.060> the<00:01:47.300> end<00:01:47.450> of

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
crimp one of my loops onto the end of

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.490 
crimp one of my loops onto the end of
the<00:01:47.840> wire<00:01:48.080> now<00:01:49.600> when<00:01:50.600> you're<00:01:50.750> using<00:01:50.960> a<00:01:51.200> crimp

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
the wire now when you're using a crimp

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.980 
the wire now when you're using a crimp
with<00:01:51.650> a<00:01:51.680> loop<00:01:52.360> you<00:01:53.360> want<00:01:53.510> to<00:01:53.570> make<00:01:53.660> sure<00:01:53.840> that

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:53.990 
with a loop you want to make sure that

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.190 
with a loop you want to make sure that
you're<00:01:54.170> only<00:01:54.320> crimping<00:01:54.950> the<00:01:55.190> end<00:01:56.200> that's

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
you're only crimping the end that's

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.080 
you're only crimping the end that's
further<00:01:57.560> away<00:01:57.650> from<00:01:57.920> the<00:01:58.250> loop<00:01:58.430> and<00:01:58.670> there<00:01:58.940> is

00:01:59.080 --> 00:01:59.090 
further away from the loop and there is

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.270 
further away from the loop and there is
going<00:01:59.390> to<00:01:59.480> be<00:01:59.750> a<00:01:59.960> little<00:02:00.710> bit<00:02:00.830> of<00:02:00.920> the<00:02:01.040> crimp

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
going to be a little bit of the crimp

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.730 
going to be a little bit of the crimp
tube<00:02:01.370> left<00:02:02.270> over<00:02:02.720> that<00:02:02.990> you're<00:02:03.110> not<00:02:03.290> crimping

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
tube left over that you're not crimping

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.370 
tube left over that you're not crimping
don't<00:02:04.730> try<00:02:05.300> to<00:02:05.360> do<00:02:05.510> the<00:02:05.630> whole<00:02:05.660> thing<00:02:06.020> because

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
don't try to do the whole thing because

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.770 
don't try to do the whole thing because
otherwise<00:02:06.710> it<00:02:07.160> will<00:02:07.490> a<00:02:07.910> lot<00:02:08.300> of<00:02:08.390> times<00:02:08.600> the

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
otherwise it will a lot of times the

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.940 
otherwise it will a lot of times the
loop<00:02:08.930> will<00:02:09.110> come<00:02:09.260> loose<00:02:09.530> so<00:02:10.090> go<00:02:11.090> ahead<00:02:11.240> and

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
loop will come loose so go ahead and

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.000 
loop will come loose so go ahead and
grab<00:02:12.950> the<00:02:13.790> loop<00:02:14.000> and<00:02:14.210> insert<00:02:14.480> one<00:02:14.780> end<00:02:15.350> of<00:02:15.620> your

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
grab the loop and insert one end of your

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:22.930 
grab the loop and insert one end of your
beading<00:02:16.430> wire<00:02:16.670> in<00:02:16.970> and<00:02:17.330> crimp<00:02:18.200> down<00:02:21.100> and<00:02:22.100> then

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
beading wire in and crimp down and then

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:28.540 
beading wire in and crimp down and then
complete<00:02:23.450> the<00:02:23.480> crimp<00:02:23.930> and<00:02:27.220> we<00:02:28.220> do<00:02:28.340> have<00:02:28.490> a

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
complete the crimp and we do have a

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.220 
complete the crimp and we do have a
whole<00:02:28.790> video<00:02:28.970> on<00:02:29.150> using<00:02:29.420> crimp<00:02:29.870> beads<00:02:30.050> and

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
whole video on using crimp beads and

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:31.960 
whole video on using crimp beads and
tubes<00:02:30.410> if<00:02:30.650> you're<00:02:30.800> not<00:02:31.100> familiar<00:02:31.310> and<00:02:31.850> you

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.310 
tubes if you're not familiar and you
need<00:02:32.150> to<00:02:32.240> see<00:02:32.420> a<00:02:32.450> little<00:02:32.630> bit<00:02:32.870> more<00:02:35.170> then<00:02:36.170> I'm

on<00:02:41.959> the<00:02:41.990> end<00:02:42.230> of<00:02:42.560> the<00:02:43.130> katydid<00:02:44.620> and<00:02:46.239> then<00:02:47.239> I've

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
on the end of the katydid and then I've

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.770 
on the end of the katydid and then I've
already<00:02:48.080> experimented<00:02:48.980> and<00:02:49.360> seen<00:02:50.360> that<00:02:50.510> I<00:02:50.540> can

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
already experimented and seen that I can

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.900 
already experimented and seen that I can
fill<00:02:51.020> seven<00:02:51.560> of<00:02:51.830> these<00:02:52.070> beans<00:02:52.400> into<00:02:52.790> the

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:52.910 
fill seven of these beans into the

fill seven of these beans into the
katydid<00:02:53.390> and<00:02:53.600> I<00:02:54.050> just<00:02:54.290> place<00:02:54.470> them<00:02:54.680> in<00:02:54.830> before

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
katydid and I just place them in before

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:56.830 
katydid and I just place them in before
I<00:02:55.220> had<00:02:55.430> my<00:02:55.459> wire<00:02:55.850> to<00:02:56.120> see<00:02:56.270> how<00:02:56.420> many<00:02:56.600> I<00:02:56.660> was

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:56.840 
I had my wire to see how many I was

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.420 
I had my wire to see how many I was
going<00:02:56.989> to<00:02:57.050> use<00:02:58.090> I'm<00:02:59.090> just<00:02:59.390> going<00:02:59.630> to<00:02:59.720> string

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:00.430 
going to use I'm just going to string

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:13.059 
going to use I'm just going to string
seven<00:03:01.430> of<00:03:01.580> these<00:03:03.040> randomly<00:03:04.040> onto<00:03:04.670> my<00:03:04.850> wire

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:13.069 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:15.789 

then<00:03:13.730> I'm<00:03:13.849> going<00:03:14.150> to<00:03:14.180> take<00:03:14.420> the<00:03:14.629> other<00:03:14.780> end<00:03:14.900> or

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:15.799 
then I'm going to take the other end or

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:17.729 
then I'm going to take the other end or
the<00:03:15.920> end<00:03:16.069> of<00:03:16.189> the<00:03:16.280> wire<00:03:16.459> and<00:03:16.670> put<00:03:16.849> it<00:03:16.939> through

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
the end of the wire and put it through

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:25.649 
the end of the wire and put it through
the<00:03:18.739> hole<00:03:18.980> on<00:03:19.370> the<00:03:20.030> other<00:03:20.239> end<00:03:20.510> of<00:03:20.719> the<00:03:20.810> katydid

00:03:25.649 --> 00:03:25.659 

00:03:25.659 --> 00:03:31.030 

just<00:03:26.659> like<00:03:26.840> that<00:03:29.349> make<00:03:30.349> sure<00:03:30.560> that<00:03:30.680> your<00:03:30.889> beads

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
just like that make sure that your beads

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:36.910 
just like that make sure that your beads
sit<00:03:31.879> nice<00:03:32.120> in<00:03:32.389> there<00:03:35.439> now<00:03:36.439> I'm<00:03:36.560> going<00:03:36.799> to

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
sit nice in there now I'm going to

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:38.530 
sit nice in there now I'm going to
attach<00:03:37.219> the<00:03:37.400> crimp<00:03:37.639> to<00:03:37.760> the<00:03:37.849> other<00:03:38.030> end<00:03:38.329> of<00:03:38.420> the

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
attach the crimp to the other end of the

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:44.349 
attach the crimp to the other end of the
wire<00:03:42.280> and<00:03:43.280> I<00:03:43.400> do<00:03:43.459> find<00:03:43.819> with<00:03:43.969> these<00:03:44.120> it's

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:44.359 
wire and I do find with these it's

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:47.589 
wire and I do find with these it's
easier<00:03:44.689> for<00:03:44.749> me<00:03:45.139> personally<00:03:45.739> if<00:03:46.370> I<00:03:46.579> line<00:03:47.389> the

00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:47.599 
easier for me personally if I line the

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:50.319 
easier for me personally if I line the
crimp<00:03:48.019> up<00:03:48.139> in<00:03:48.409> the<00:03:48.709> pliers<00:03:49.310> and<00:03:49.459> then<00:03:49.849> put<00:03:50.239> the

crimp up in the pliers and then put the

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:52.390 
crimp up in the pliers and then put the
wire<00:03:50.480> in<00:03:50.750> instead<00:03:51.500> of<00:03:51.560> trying<00:03:51.829> to<00:03:51.889> get<00:03:52.280> it

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
wire in instead of trying to get it

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.709 
wire in instead of trying to get it
lined<00:03:52.549> up<00:03:52.699> correctly<00:03:52.730> with<00:03:53.209> the<00:03:53.329> wire<00:03:53.480> in

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:53.719 
lined up correctly with the wire in

00:03:53.719 --> 00:03:58.780
