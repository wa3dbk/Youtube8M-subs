down<00:01:49.990> the<00:01:50.200> hill<00:01:50.850> I<00:01:51.850> think<00:01:52.539> that<00:01:52.810> you<00:01:53.170> know<00:01:53.259> that

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
down the hill I think that you know that

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.290 
down the hill I think that you know that
you<00:01:53.679> can<00:01:53.800> still<00:01:54.009> find<00:01:54.190> that<00:01:54.399> on<00:01:54.640> all<00:01:55.240> the

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:55.300 
you can still find that on all the

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.139 
you can still find that on all the
videos<00:01:55.899> though<00:01:56.259> so<00:01:56.619> I<00:01:56.649> would<00:01:57.069> check<00:01:57.759> out<00:01:57.970> the

00:01:58.139 --> 00:01:58.149 
videos though so I would check out the

video if you want to see the full

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:03.559
