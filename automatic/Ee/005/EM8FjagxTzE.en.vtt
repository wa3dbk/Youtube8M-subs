00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.820

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.530

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.510
 but this month because your feelings in 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.730

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.780

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:59.410
 been important to me I could be 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:02.680
 working in a good way I think that 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:05.830
 the results have been giving me little 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.330
 little to thank the football league 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.759
 professional for this award I think that 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:12.670
 that's something that motivates me a lot that I 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:13.930
 commits and that helps me to know that 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.210
 I'm on the right track and I have to 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.460
 continue on this way to be able to 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.530
 conquer my dreams 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.900
 taylor you could say that between you 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.250
 performance this championship and the 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.650
 perspective of having to play a 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.159
 world that you are in the best moment of 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.159
 your career 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:35.610
 or mom is the little one 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:37.830
 sorry I do not feel very happy because 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:40.110
 I think this year has been very good 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:43.290
 I have had the opportunity to play 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.940
 it was something I wanted for a long time and 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.700
 well I think the motivation to have 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.590
 a world cup near this to be there of 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.260
 which is a dream that we had for 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.850
 a long time that we are close to being able to 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.340
 fulfill it to which God gives us health 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.010
 to be there, these are things that 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.830
 they join and help one to work at 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:03.390
 try and try to be in 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.880
 the best possible level to be able to reach 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.400
 to the world in good way and make a 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.259
 good paper 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.900
 so now I would like to know how 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.670
 take away the rumors that link clubs 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.000
 of the English athletic league of madrid 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.580
 barÃ§a 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.070
 well I am very calm I think that my 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.260
 future god will know where I will be for 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:25.830
 me is the most important thing at this moment 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:28.530
 I try to live in the present I do not think 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.970
 it's worth it to be thinking about 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.150
 what will happen to me within three 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.440
 months if you do not know if tomorrow will 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.300
 be or will not be then touch 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.130
 enjoy my family enjoy my 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.130
 present of the matches that I am 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:43.790
 playing of the minutes and for me it is what 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.790
 more important 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:48.959
 what was it to me I would like to know if you see 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:54.209
 in the not too distant future playing in the 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:56.550
 barcelona good now I think it's a 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:59.760
 theme in which this 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.080
 I have nothing to say in my present 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:04.069
 of getting up and as I said earlier 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.959
 I have to enjoy it 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:09.170
 any player would like to be 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:10.370
 in a big club but I owe the 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.980
 trust that you are giving to each 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:15.170
 play and the tournament is not over missing 

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.810
 matches or that continue to yield 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.609
 and I have to try to get to good 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:22.359
 level to the world which is the most 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:22.359
 important to me 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.260
 also that your companions the little eggs 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.010
 to accompany them to other wheels of 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.350
 press 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:38.330
 I do not know if you want to talk a little about them 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:40.100
 well I think this 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:43.880
 besides colleagues I think they are 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:47.180
 friends one always has people in the 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:50.719
 you can rely on it 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:53.090
 this veil is beyond the companions 

00:03:50.719 --> 00:03:54.530
 who are always training then I 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.870
 I always thank them they have been 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:58.750
 in the bad moments with me I think 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.129
 that for me that has been important 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:04.549
 then because they are not in the good 

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:06.139
 I believe that in the good ones it is not always 

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:08.800
 it deserves everyone to be but those who have 

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:11.920
 been from there from always 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:14.800
 I had a question to buy the table 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:18.459
 day of the representatives of the league 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:20.049
 and a bank goes for 10 million euros a 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.739
 goalkeeper who has his infidel to his 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:24.460
 right 

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:24.460
 much more 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:30.659
 they say that we do not get it right 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.950
 without a doubt we are going with the trajectory that 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:39.000
 it is 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:39.000
 it is exceptional not
