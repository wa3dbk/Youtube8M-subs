00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:21.880 
attach the shoulder pieces I personally
don't<00:02:20.000> see<00:02:20.150> the<00:02:20.330> purpose<00:02:21.140> of<00:02:21.290> the<00:02:21.350> magnets

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:21.890 
don't see the purpose of the magnets

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.020 
don't see the purpose of the magnets
since<00:02:22.820> this<00:02:23.060> goes<00:02:23.720> in

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
since this goes in

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.480 
since this goes in
with<00:02:26.030> friction<00:02:26.830> then<00:02:27.830> the<00:02:28.010> next<00:02:28.220> piece<00:02:28.340> we're

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.490 
with friction then the next piece we're

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:30.160 
with friction then the next piece we're
going<00:02:28.610> to<00:02:28.670> attach<00:02:28.880> is<00:02:29.120> this<00:02:29.690> dragon<00:02:30.050> piece

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
going to attach is this dragon piece

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.570 
going to attach is this dragon piece
which<00:02:30.319> also<00:02:30.500> has<00:02:30.709> magnets<00:02:31.160> and<00:02:31.310> you'll<00:02:31.400> notice

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
which also has magnets and you'll notice

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.120 
which also has magnets and you'll notice
mine<00:02:31.970> came<00:02:32.540> loose<00:02:32.810> it's<00:02:33.260> not<00:02:33.470> broken<00:02:33.830> it<00:02:33.950> just

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:34.130 
mine came loose it's not broken it just

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.640 
mine came loose it's not broken it just
seems<00:02:34.310> like<00:02:34.370> didn't<00:02:34.730> supply<00:02:35.120> enough<00:02:35.420> blue<00:02:35.650> but

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
seems like didn't supply enough blue but

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.940 
seems like didn't supply enough blue but
this<00:02:36.860> part<00:02:37.220> just<00:02:37.520> snaps<00:02:38.120> right<00:02:38.270> in<00:02:38.600> the<00:02:38.690> front

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
this part just snaps right in the front

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.699 
this part just snaps right in the front
then<00:02:39.950> you'll<00:02:40.100> take<00:02:40.280> this<00:02:40.459> piece<00:02:40.760> and<00:02:41.709> just

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:42.709 
then you'll take this piece and just

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:48.550 
then you'll take this piece and just
reattach<00:02:43.100> it<00:02:43.490> and<00:02:46.780> the<00:02:47.780> last<00:02:47.959> part<00:02:48.230> would<00:02:48.380> just

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:48.560 
reattach it and the last part would just

00:02:48.560 --> 00:03:19.039 
reattach it and the last part would just
be<00:02:48.740> pulling<00:02:49.750> these<00:02:50.750> bits<00:02:51.470> out

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:24.420 

so<00:03:20.049> there<00:03:20.290> you<00:03:20.319> have<00:03:20.500> the<00:03:20.890> gorram<00:03:21.340> dragon<00:03:23.430> it

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
so there you have the gorram dragon it

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.059 
so there you have the gorram dragon it
is<00:03:24.580> a<00:03:24.610> nice<00:03:24.849> piece<00:03:25.810> although<00:03:26.560> if<00:03:26.709> you<00:03:26.799> want<00:03:26.830> to
