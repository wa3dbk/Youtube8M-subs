overall i think that they're kind of

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.139 
overall i think that they're kind of
messy<00:00:51.449> and<00:00:51.719> they're<00:00:52.110> kind<00:00:52.350> of<00:00:52.940> just<00:00:53.940> kind<00:00:54.120> of

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
messy and they're kind of just kind of

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:55.819 
messy and they're kind of just kind of
annoying<00:00:54.449> you<00:00:54.750> put<00:00:54.899> them<00:00:55.020> on<00:00:55.110> your<00:00:55.199> teeth<00:00:55.260> and

00:00:55.819 --> 00:00:55.829 
annoying you put them on your teeth and

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:57.950 
annoying you put them on your teeth and
you<00:00:56.190> know<00:00:56.309> they<00:00:56.430> move<00:00:56.640> around<00:00:56.730> a<00:00:57.090> lot<00:00:57.239> and<00:00:57.719> i

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
you know they move around a lot and i

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.840 
you know they move around a lot and i
haven't<00:00:58.649> tried<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.920> dissolving<00:00:59.430> ones<00:00:59.460> yet
