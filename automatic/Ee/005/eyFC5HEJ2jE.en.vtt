00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.120 
techniques of had some inherent problems

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.490 
techniques of had some inherent problems
of<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.390> dog<00:00:39.620> hitting<00:00:40.620> on<00:00:40.769> the<00:00:41.460> wrong<00:00:41.820> oh<00:00:42.500> I

of the dog hitting on the wrong oh I
also<00:00:44.280> had<00:00:44.489> problems<00:00:44.670> with

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
also had problems with

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.569 
also had problems with
the<00:00:46.170> police<00:00:46.379> officer<00:00:46.829> pointed<00:00:47.160> a<00:00:47.219> couple<00:00:47.520> of

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
the police officer pointed a couple of

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.490 
the police officer pointed a couple of
dollars<00:00:47.820> in<00:00:47.940> when<00:00:48.149> it's<00:00:48.300> familiar<00:00:48.719> with<00:00:48.899> bonds

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
dollars in when it's familiar with bonds

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.650 
dollars in when it's familiar with bonds
and<00:00:49.800> clever<00:00:50.010> horse<00:00:50.280> story<00:00:50.610> will<00:00:51.090> tell<00:00:51.480> you

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
and clever horse story will tell you

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.020 
and clever horse story will tell you
that<00:00:51.870> cameras<00:00:52.350> can<00:00:52.590> accidentally<00:00:53.399> help<00:00:53.790> their

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
that cameras can accidentally help their

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.869 
that cameras can accidentally help their
dogs<00:00:54.440> by<00:00:56.149> descent

00:00:58.869 --> 00:00:58.879 
dogs by descent

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:01.959 
dogs by descent
so<00:00:59.570> this<00:00:59.899> technique<00:01:00.410> here<00:01:00.769> is<00:01:01.039> designed<00:01:01.519> to<00:01:01.850> do

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:01.969 
so this technique here is designed to do

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:03.999 
so this technique here is designed to do
a<00:01:02.000> couple<00:01:02.359> of<00:01:02.420> things<00:01:02.629> it's<00:01:03.050> a<00:01:03.199> drive<00:01:03.500> building

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:04.009 
a couple of things it's a drive building

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:07.330 
a couple of things it's a drive building
technique<00:01:04.460> it<00:01:05.409> pulls<00:01:06.409> off<00:01:06.710> the<00:01:06.740> dog's<00:01:07.040> natural

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
technique it pulls off the dog's natural

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.600 
technique it pulls off the dog's natural
instincts<00:01:08.210> to<00:01:08.869> fight<00:01:09.229> the<00:01:09.470> prey<00:01:09.740> not<00:01:10.130> just<00:01:10.430> the

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
instincts to fight the prey not just the

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.910 
instincts to fight the prey not just the
find<00:01:11.570> it<00:01:11.780> but<00:01:12.020> to<00:01:12.229> have<00:01:12.700> fight<00:01:13.700> and<00:01:14.710> it<00:01:15.710> can

00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:15.920 
find it but to have fight and it can

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:18.760 
find it but to have fight and it can
take<00:01:16.070> dogs<00:01:16.340> really<00:01:17.330> built<00:01:17.690> some<00:01:17.930> strong<00:01:18.440> Drive

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
take dogs really built some strong Drive

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.969 
take dogs really built some strong Drive
take<00:01:19.869> to<00:01:20.869> teach<00:01:21.140> them<00:01:21.380> to<00:01:21.409> be<00:01:21.560> very

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:21.979 
take to teach them to be very

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:23.980 
take to teach them to be very
discriminating<00:01:22.700> about<00:01:23.180> what<00:01:23.509> orders<00:01:23.840> they

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
discriminating about what orders they

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.620 
discriminating about what orders they
hit<00:01:24.259> it's<00:01:25.190> very<00:01:25.369> common<00:01:25.759> to<00:01:25.789> use<00:01:26.030> a<00:01:26.060> tennis

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
hit it's very common to use a tennis

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.450 
hit it's very common to use a tennis
ball<00:01:26.869> or<00:01:27.200> this<00:01:27.649> type<00:01:27.860> of<00:01:27.890> training

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 
ball or this type of training

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.070 
ball or this type of training
but<00:01:28.759> once<00:01:28.940> again<00:01:29.240> one<00:01:29.630> of<00:01:29.690> the<00:01:29.750> big<00:01:29.869> problems

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 
but once again one of the big problems

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.249 
but once again one of the big problems
was<00:01:30.409> dogs<00:01:30.740> wanting<00:01:31.190> to<00:01:31.369> find<00:01:32.240> tennis<00:01:33.050> balls

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:33.259 
was dogs wanting to find tennis balls

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:36.340 
was dogs wanting to find tennis balls
not<00:01:33.560> target<00:01:34.009> over<00:01:34.190> so<00:01:34.729> this<00:01:35.360> technique<00:01:35.750> really

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
not target over so this technique really

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.290 
not target over so this technique really
helps<00:01:36.770> dogs<00:01:36.950> start<00:01:37.280> to<00:01:37.369> make<00:01:37.520> a<00:01:37.550> distinction

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:38.300 
helps dogs start to make a distinction

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:41.020 
helps dogs start to make a distinction
between<00:01:38.479> target<00:01:39.289> odor<00:01:39.500> and<00:01:39.860> a<00:01:40.310> tennis<00:01:40.850> ball

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
between target odor and a tennis ball

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.570 
between target odor and a tennis ball
that<00:01:41.539> will<00:01:41.690> bring<00:01:41.929> more<00:01:42.679> advanced<00:01:42.979> dogs<00:01:43.250> up

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:43.580 
that will bring more advanced dogs up

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.790 
that will bring more advanced dogs up
here<00:01:43.940> a<00:01:43.970> little<00:01:44.360> bit<00:01:44.509> later<00:01:44.690> but<00:01:45.289> this<00:01:45.409> is<00:01:45.470> us

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:45.800 
here a little bit later but this is us
