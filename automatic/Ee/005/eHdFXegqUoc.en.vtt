00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
option one two and three the only reason

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.510 
option one two and three the only reason
I<00:01:51.360> use<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.810> ballista<00:01:52.320> is<00:01:52.380> to<00:01:52.920> playground<00:01:53.340> word

because

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
because

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.830 
because
I<00:02:13.740> just<00:02:14.040> got<00:02:14.190> used<00:02:14.400> to<00:02:14.640> sniping<00:02:15.210> regularly

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
I just got used to sniping regularly

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.830 
I just got used to sniping regularly
because<00:02:16.440> my<00:02:16.770> controller<00:02:17.240> it<00:02:18.240> got<00:02:18.420> messed<00:02:18.660> up

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
because my controller it got messed up

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.930 
because my controller it got messed up
like<00:02:19.200> a<00:02:19.710> couple<00:02:20.130> months<00:02:20.460> back<00:02:20.580> when<00:02:20.760> I<00:02:20.850> was

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
like a couple months back when I was

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.490 
like a couple months back when I was
starting<00:02:21.180> to<00:02:21.210> come<00:02:21.390> back<00:02:21.420> to<00:02:21.630> black<00:02:21.840> ops<00:02:22.050> 2<00:02:22.290> and

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
starting to come back to black ops 2 and

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.890 
starting to come back to black ops 2 and
the<00:02:23.250> thumbstick<00:02:23.700> wouldn't<00:02:23.970> run<00:02:24.150> properly<00:02:24.540> so

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
the thumbstick wouldn't run properly so

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.900 
the thumbstick wouldn't run properly so
I<00:02:24.930> decided<00:02:25.350> you<00:02:25.620> know<00:02:25.710> with<00:02:25.980> it<00:02:26.220> can't<00:02:26.700> run

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
I decided you know with it can't run

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.190 
I decided you know with it can't run
properly<00:02:27.270> you<00:02:27.510> know<00:02:27.600> I<00:02:27.660> can't<00:02:27.900> reload

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
properly you know I can't reload

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.500 
properly you know I can't reload
canceled<00:02:28.590> so<00:02:28.740> I<00:02:28.770> just<00:02:29.040> started<00:02:29.730> sniping<00:02:30.150> with

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
canceled so I just started sniping with

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.240 
canceled so I just started sniping with
it<00:02:30.660> regularly<00:02:30.990> and<00:02:31.260> it's<00:02:31.620> been<00:02:31.860> working<00:02:32.010> out

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
it regularly and it's been working out

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:33.860 
it regularly and it's been working out
for<00:02:32.460> me<00:02:32.490> it's<00:02:32.760> way<00:02:33.120> harder<00:02:33.480> to<00:02:33.540> hit<00:02:33.660> clips

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
for me it's way harder to hit clips

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.840 
for me it's way harder to hit clips
though<00:02:34.140> that's<00:02:34.530> definitely<00:02:35.040> the<00:02:35.580> huge

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
though that's definitely the huge

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.930 
though that's definitely the huge
negative<00:02:36.090> on<00:02:36.420> that<00:02:36.450> and<00:02:36.840> but<00:02:37.230> yeah<00:02:37.620> if<00:02:37.890> I<00:02:38.220> do

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
negative on that and but yeah if I do

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.700 
negative on that and but yeah if I do
upload<00:02:39.180> a<00:02:39.300> phase<00:02:39.540> one<00:02:39.750> response<00:02:40.110> it's<00:02:40.500> gonna

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:40.710 
upload a phase one response it's gonna

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:45.500 
upload a phase one response it's gonna
be<00:02:41.010> black<00:02:41.880> ops<00:02:42.090> 1<00:02:42.210> only<00:02:42.750> and<00:02:43.380> dsr<00:02:44.150> non<00:02:45.150> reload

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:49.320 
want to play black ops 1 is because I

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.660 
want to play black ops 1 is because I
just<00:02:49.470> want<00:02:49.620> to<00:02:49.680> put<00:02:49.800> more<00:02:49.890> time<00:02:50.100> into<00:02:50.310> the<00:02:50.460> game
