00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 hello people that as you are I think 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.310
 that I'm fine I'd like to save a 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.410
 little battery on your smartphone 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.450
 android yes, look, I have some 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.469
 tricks for this assignment stay 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.469
 to discover it 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.150
 if you are a telephone holder 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.010
 smart or smartphone sure you 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.830
 you will have noticed that the battery of 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.599
 it is quite limited all the 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.789
 days you have to load it twice 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.219
 this has conditioned our condition 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.120
 as human beings is conditioning 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.890
 our condition as human beings 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.719
 since now our greatest 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.210
 concern is carrying the charger 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:43.519
 over for the critical moments in the 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.559
 that the battery floats is darwin in short 

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:47.329
 I'll give you some tips to stretch 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:50.030
 a little bit more battery life 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:52.399
 prepared because I start first the 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.229
 screen is what more energy consumes 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:56.000
 I recommend that you control the degree of 

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:57.710
 lighting do not always have it to 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.420
 maximum man if you're going to be on the street 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:01.010
 with bright sunshine you will not be of 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.960
 another but when I'm inside 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.759
 regulated you can also configure the 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.130
 screen timeout so that 

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:09.229
 it turns off automatically at 15 or 30 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.910
 seconds deactivates the options of 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:14.270
 connectivity when you're not using them 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:16.640
 that is to say the wifi the gps and the bluetooth 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:20.679
 the latter means blue environment this 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.679
 is a fact that I brought you like that without further 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:25.250
 Regarding the wifi is recommended 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.899
 deactivate it if there is no network 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.880
 available since the phone is 

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:30.979
 It puts like crazy looking for some connection 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.899
 and that consumes battery checks the 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:34.700
 intensity of coverage since 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:36.380
 there are areas where there is very little 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.420
 for example a basement here in the 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.160
 lofts always coverage because they are 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.870
 in high of curious good in areas 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.600
 with few 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:45.760
 or no phone becomes again as 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.620
 crazy looking for it and that makes me consume 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.570
 enough battery so the best in 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:51.490
 this case is that they activate the airplane mode 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.110
 so that the phone stays relaxed 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.290
 the same goes for the data connection 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.520
 3g 4g the one you have if you are in an area 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.680
 where it is quite limited or 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.660
 directly there is no deactivated one 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.520
 tip about the wifi connection and 

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.030
 of data if you are in a place where 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.130
 be 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:08.410
 both available I recommend that you 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.300
 connect to the wifi since it consumes 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.890
 less careful with the widgets that you have 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.900
 assets for example it is very common to have 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.150
 a widget that tells us about the weather 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:18.070
 meteorological that information gets it 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:19.570
 of internet connecting frequently 

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:22.000
 and when doing these consultations are 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:23.770
 frequently causes the battery to 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.840
 resents what is recommended 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:27.820
 deactivate them and check for our 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.980
 account in your information disables the 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:32.350
 automatic mail synchronization 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.180
 contacts calendars social networks 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:36.580
 etcetera these applications are 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.710
 constantly connected to the internet and 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.570
 informing them at all times of what 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:42.370
 happens in our accounts this is a 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:44.800
 very good thing because we are informed 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:46.030
 at all times but it is very bad for the 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.890
 food battery 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:49.750
 what you check all your accounts 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.700
 manually I understand that this 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.230
 it may be a pain in the ass but you should 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.450
 Do everything possible to make your 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.490
 battery does not suffer otherwise if you have 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:59.890
 applications open in the background and 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:02.050
 They are not using them, but they are not 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.910
 we see them are behind running 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.560
 and consuming batteries and if you have 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:07.390
 applications that you no longer use 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.920
 uninstall the posts that happened 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.360
 you are also saving space in 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.370
 memory regarding those that have 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.440
 installed you should know that the games 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.390
 web browsers and players 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.100
 of videos are the applications that 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.830
 they consume batteries finally you 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.810
 I recommend that you do not abuse the vibrator 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:24.850
 from the vibrator mode I want to say to the 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.769
 battery do not like it much and it's always 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:29.620
 recommendable to have wallpaper 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:32.110
 a static image before an image 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.970
 in motion since the latter 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:36.100
 everything that they have of pretty they have it 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.780
 of wasteful energy and it's already 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:39.459
 finished as you have seen you have to do 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.800
 some sacrifices so that the battery 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:43.690
 last a little longer and you apply some 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.640
 of these recommendations you apply others 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.200
 methods leave me a comment and 

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.030
 tell me at the moment if it has 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.420
 liked this video can you give me 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.130
 like 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.230
 and spreading throughout your networks 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:55.209
 of course I also invite you 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.370
 you subscribe to my channel if you do not 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:04:00.270
 you have already done I say goodbye for today until 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.270
