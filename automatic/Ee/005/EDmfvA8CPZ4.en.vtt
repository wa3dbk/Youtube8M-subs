00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
before and I just thought well then I'll

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.380 
before and I just thought well then I'll
be<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.920> first<00:01:41.159> amputee<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.729> snowboard<00:01:42.210> if<00:01:42.329> I

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
be the first amputee the snowboard if I

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.120 
be the first amputee the snowboard if I

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
have to go to NASA and have them build

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.420 
have to go to NASA and have them build
me<00:01:44.189> a<00:01:44.310> pair<00:01:44.549> of<00:01:44.689> legs<00:01:45.689> then<00:01:46.170> I'll<00:01:46.860> go<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:47.189> NASA

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
me a pair of legs then I'll go to NASA

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:48.800 
me a pair of legs then I'll go to NASA
and<00:01:47.700> have<00:01:47.850> them<00:01:47.939> build<00:01:48.149> me<00:01:48.299> a<00:01:48.329> pair<00:01:48.570> of<00:01:48.600> legs

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
and have them build me a pair of legs

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.569 
and have them build me a pair of legs
because<00:01:49.079> I'm<00:01:49.229> gonna<00:01:49.380> do<00:01:49.649> it<00:01:49.799> and<00:01:50.070> I<00:01:50.220> think<00:01:50.460> I'd

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
because I'm gonna do it and I think I'd

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.370 
because I'm gonna do it and I think I'd
gained<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.390> balance<00:01:51.899> just<00:01:52.200> from

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
gained the balance just from

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.080 
gained the balance just from
snowboarding<00:01:52.799> for<00:01:52.920> so<00:01:53.070> long<00:01:53.250> to<00:01:53.729> be<00:01:53.850> able<00:01:53.939> to

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
snowboarding for so long to be able to

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.969 
snowboarding for so long to be able to
like<00:01:54.329> get<00:01:54.479> that<00:01:54.630> balance<00:01:54.810> back<00:01:55.350> again<00:01:55.680> once<00:01:55.860> I

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
like get that balance back again once I

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.770 
like get that balance back again once I
was<00:01:56.100> on<00:01:56.250> a<00:01:56.280> snowboard<00:01:56.549> it<00:01:56.939> felt<00:01:57.240> different<00:01:57.450> but

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
was on a snowboard it felt different but

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.170 
was on a snowboard it felt different but
I<00:01:57.990> knew<00:01:58.200> that<00:01:58.409> I<00:01:58.439> could<00:01:58.649> adapt<00:01:58.979> if<00:01:59.340> I<00:01:59.520> made<00:02:00.060> my

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
I knew that I could adapt if I made my

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.590 
I knew that I could adapt if I made my
legs<00:02:00.329> a<00:02:00.509> little<00:02:00.570> bit<00:02:00.780> more<00:02:00.930> comfortable

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
legs a little bit more comfortable

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.659 
legs a little bit more comfortable
