00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.550
 he 

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:10.430
 after one of the most disappointing movies 

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:13.019
 this year it's really time that I 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:15.799
 redo a review on a safe bet 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.799
 animation films 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:21.340

 hello to all of you in this 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.350
 new episode of critical moments 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.760
 today we will see together 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.470
 one of the most anticipated films of 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.680
 dreamworks studios animation madagascar 

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:48.690
 4 you decided to piss me off 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.159
 today good I reassure you all of 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.230
 next let's talk about dragon's den 

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:54.000
 directed by dean deblois co director 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.510
 of the first dragon and director of lilo 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.829
 and stitch 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.420
 and it is to be specified we find 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:58.769
 also the whole voice casting of the first 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.290
 movie like for example jay baruchel 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:03.290
 gerard butler america ferrera craig 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 david 

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:22.350
 no he's not even in the cast for 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:27.720
 the second part wow must you 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:29.580
 take rather well we find ourselves so 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.810
 harold and his friends five years after 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.039
 events of the first film that has 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.840
 resulted in peaceful cohabitation 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:35.820
 between the dragons and the vikings 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.349
 yes but unfortunately this peace is 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.849
 threatened by the arrival of an individual 

00:01:37.349 --> 00:01:39.450
 wanting to use dragon for the purpose of 

00:01:38.849 --> 00:01:42.000
 domination 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.679
 frankly and that's my opinion is smoking 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.179
 is even better than the first one 

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:46.920
 be careful do not get me wrong i love 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:48.030
 the first film but we see that oath 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.770
 that they have worked hard to 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.750
 this second part already the characters 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.979
 major have evolved harold is 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.119
 very interesting by the fact that he 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.560
 do not assume the idea of ​​having to one day 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:57.239
 take the place of his father as 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.130
 chief of duty to abandon the adventure 

00:01:57.239 --> 00:02:00.450
 exploring the sails with too soft to 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.739
 because of his future responsibilities 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.060
 we have here the classic case of 

00:02:01.739 --> 00:02:03.720
 the teenager being afraid to enter the 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:04.979
 adult world 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.660
 a world that does not necessarily correspond 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.500
 to the life he wants to lead and who 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:09.629
 deprives of his freedom 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.920
 as for his father stoïk we feel good 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:12.420
 the weight of the years that starts to 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.890
 see on his face ready to pass 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.030
 torch to his son he prepared from 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.500
 better than they could his future status 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.940
 leader but they also offer us 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.530
 really touching passages when he 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.300
 found an important element are 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.340
 passed in the person of balkhach who 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.780
 is none other than harold's mother she 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.650
 is deeply attached to the dragons and 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.180
 she is eaten up by guilt 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:28.170
 to have had to abandon his family 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.300
 several years ago 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.810
 regarding the rest of the band 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.819
 there and well 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.530
 yz harold but to by astrid who is a 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:36.610
 moral support well they are mostly 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:38.290
 a comic element of the film 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.510
 as far as braquo who is 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.340
 the antagonist of the film well, it's good 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.410
 but it remains fairly conventional this 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.670
 guy hates dragons and he even 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.110
 a deep desire to tame this 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:47.980
 bestial force that destroyed his life 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.870
 several years ago 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:51.430
 because for him only the strongest 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.459
 survive well clear he seeks to 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.989
 dominate the world is that France 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:56.950
 and as for the film universe 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:58.150
 well we leave the lands of 

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.890
 burke to discover a world yet 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.870
 much larger wealthy and a certain 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.099
 well- colored moment the theft of dragons in 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.030
 group is really very beautiful to see and 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:05.739
 I even had the impression to some 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:07.450
 moments of attending a real ballet 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:08.860
 aerial and visually speaking the 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.660
 action scenes are more daunting and 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:14.489
 rhythm and it's really very fluid and 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.489
 we finally have a nice and useful 3d 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.060
 not like some not seriously from 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:20.560
 all the animated movies that I saw 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.360
 for the moment sané it is part for 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:24.040
 the moment with the great legal adventure 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.970
 movies that I liked the most 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.860
 start to finish 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.810
 it is developed there is action of 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.640
 the adventure of emotion and drama 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.319
 and yeah drama all the way along the movie 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.940
 there is a real sense of stake 

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:35.859
 but it's going back uninhibited by 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:37.239
 humor like to tell you you're going 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:40.180
 you're bursting it's a super 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:41.829
 entertainment and there we guess a 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:43.299
 sacred slap that makes you super bad on 

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:45.160
 mans and that brings you back to reality 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:46.630
 but after what you expected from 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.400
 disney i remind you that we did the 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.299
 prince of egypt for this part of the 

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:51.280
 video I strongly advise you 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:52.690
 to advance until the time shown right there 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.620
 if you have not seen the movie yet and 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.090
 that you do not want to do this 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:58.840
 satin pony interesting passages to 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.590
 discover 3 2 1 do not go past after I 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.660
 you would not have warned 1 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.709
 indeed this return to reality is done 

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:05.350
 with the death of an important person 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:06.670
 in the person of stoic what is a 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:08.680
 really hard event for harold 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:09.970
 especially that the partial charge of 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.739
 this death was none other than his dragon 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:12.970
 crunch us this is an event really 

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:14.650
 hard as I said but who 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.090
 necessary for the evolution of the hero because 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.739
 it is this event that will decide 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.630
 finally to take his responsibilities in 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:21.489
 hand and so to become the leader whose 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:22.780
 burke people needs and we have 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:24.280
 even the right of Viking funerals 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.889
 poignant in a calm scene and 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.389
 silent to conclude dragons with 

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:30.100
 this second component asserts itself as doing 

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:31.090
 party with kung fu panda sagas 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.889

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:35.770
 year and they prove to us that they 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:37.150
 get to level with pixar 

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:39.010
 when they want it is a continuation 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.720
