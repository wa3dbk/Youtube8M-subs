00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 
total fork so if you like to ride a

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.150 
total fork so if you like to ride a
little<00:01:25.300> more<00:01:25.569> firm<00:01:26.020> you're<00:01:26.739> gonna<00:01:26.950> add<00:01:27.130> a

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:27.160 
little more firm you're gonna add a

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.850 
little more firm you're gonna add a
little<00:01:27.399> bit<00:01:27.550> more<00:01:27.880> air<00:01:28.179> and<00:01:28.509> if<00:01:29.140> you<00:01:29.380> like<00:01:29.590> your

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:29.860 
little bit more air and if you like your

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.850 
little bit more air and if you like your
ride<00:01:30.550> just<00:01:30.580> a<00:01:31.030> little<00:01:31.270> bit<00:01:31.450> more<00:01:31.630> soft<00:01:32.080> then

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
ride just a little bit more soft then

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.940 
ride just a little bit more soft then
you're<00:01:33.130> gonna<00:01:33.310> add<00:01:33.580> less<00:01:34.149> air<00:01:34.479> but<00:01:35.380> always

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
you're gonna add less air but always

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.650 
you're gonna add less air but always
check<00:01:36.250> with<00:01:36.429> your<00:01:36.489> manufacturers<00:01:37.330> specs

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:37.660 
check with your manufacturers specs

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.370 
check with your manufacturers specs
first<00:01:39.149> now<00:01:40.149> we'll<00:01:40.390> tweak<00:01:40.690> adding<00:01:41.200> and

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
first now we'll tweak adding and

first now we'll tweak adding and
removing<00:01:41.410> some<00:01:42.039> air

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.130 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.830 

remove<00:01:49.130> the<00:01:49.310> shock<00:01:49.580> pump<00:01:52.240> then<00:01:53.240> replace<00:01:53.660> the

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
remove the shock pump then replace the

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:00.580 
remove the shock pump then replace the
