the<00:00:35.310> original<00:00:35.879> ignition<00:00:36.450> coil<00:00:36.719> was<00:00:36.960> dying<00:00:37.230> so

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
the original ignition coil was dying so

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.369 
the original ignition coil was dying so
I<00:00:37.680> replaced<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.399> coil<00:00:39.329> a<00:00:39.629> also<00:00:39.930> replaced<00:00:40.260> the

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
I replaced the coil a also replaced the

a carb kit in it if you really needed it
a<00:00:48.320> certain<00:00:49.320> place<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.800> line<00:00:50.070> because<00:00:50.280> the

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
a certain place to line because the

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.209 
a certain place to line because the

original fill lines like all cracked and
dry<00:00:53.430> rot<00:00:53.699> it<00:00:54.019> and<00:00:55.129> put<00:00:56.129> a<00:00:56.160> new<00:00:56.190> spark<00:00:56.609> plug<00:00:56.850> in

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
dry rot it and put a new spark plug in

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.229 
dry rot it and put a new spark plug in
it<00:00:57.350> and<00:00:58.350> it<00:00:58.469> runs<00:00:58.680> really<00:00:58.949> nice<00:00:59.340> and<00:00:59.699> mads

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
there's a backup motor originally I was

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.040 
there's a backup motor originally I was
gonna<00:02:07.399> decide<00:02:07.850> whether<00:02:08.179> I<00:02:08.239> want<00:02:08.479> to<00:02:08.569> eat<00:02:08.780> where

and<00:02:24.900> I've<00:02:25.900> been<00:02:25.930> the<00:02:26.410> daughter<00:02:27.280> control<00:02:27.790> and

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
and I've been the daughter control and

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.330 
and I've been the daughter control and
this<00:02:28.209> one<00:02:28.450> is<00:02:28.750> it's<00:02:29.349> a<00:02:29.440> single<00:02:29.800> mad<00:02:30.010> lover

which<00:02:31.050> either<00:02:32.190> advances<00:02:33.190> or<00:02:33.370> retards<00:02:33.880> the

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
which either advances or retards the

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.660 
which either advances or retards the
ignition<00:02:34.540> timing<00:02:34.840> as<00:02:35.709> well<00:02:35.950> as<00:02:36.130> opens<00:02:36.550> or

closes the bottle butterfly in the

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.720 
closes the bottle butterfly in the
carburetor<00:02:40.180> and<00:02:40.569> I<00:02:41.410> put<00:02:41.620> it<00:02:41.739> back<00:02:42.010> on<00:02:42.069> start

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
carburetor and I put it back on start

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:49.100 
carburetor and I put it back on start
and<00:02:42.910> give<00:02:43.000> her<00:02:43.060> a<00:02:43.150> full<00:02:44.160> really<00:02:45.160> she'll<00:02:45.370> start

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:03:09.430 

the<00:02:49.890> core<00:02:50.100> courses<00:02:50.460> warmed<00:02:50.850> up

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.260 

and<00:03:10.440> she<00:03:11.100> has<00:03:11.250> like<00:03:11.400> a<00:03:11.580> hundred<00:03:11.910> and<00:03:12.000> twenty

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
and she has like a hundred and twenty

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.480 
and she has like a hundred and twenty
pounds<00:03:12.630> compression<00:03:13.170> which<00:03:13.380> is<00:03:13.490> really

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:14.490 
pounds compression which is really

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:15.800 
pounds compression which is really
really<00:03:14.670> good<00:03:14.910> for<00:03:15.060> one<00:03:15.180> of<00:03:15.330> these<00:03:15.390> motors

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
really good for one of these motors

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.130 
really good for one of these motors
because<00:03:15.959> a<00:03:16.440> lot<00:03:17.130> of<00:03:17.280> these<00:03:17.370> motors<00:03:17.930> people<00:03:18.930> ran

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
because a lot of these motors people ran

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.130 
because a lot of these motors people ran
them<00:03:19.350> with<00:03:19.620> a<00:03:19.650> bad<00:03:19.890> water<00:03:20.220> pump<00:03:20.610> and<00:03:20.790> just<00:03:21.140> cook

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
them with a bad water pump and just cook

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.460 
them with a bad water pump and just cook
the<00:03:23.060> crap<00:03:24.060> out<00:03:24.360> of<00:03:24.390> these<00:03:24.570> motors<00:03:25.020> so<00:03:25.260> that's

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
the crap out of these motors so that's

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.400 
the crap out of these motors so that's
why<00:03:25.680> they<00:03:25.860> a<00:03:26.360> lot<00:03:27.360> of<00:03:27.420> them<00:03:27.600> don't<00:03:27.900> run<00:03:28.170> that

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
why they a lot of them don't run that

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.890 
why they a lot of them don't run that
well<00:03:28.590> but<00:03:29.340> this<00:03:29.489> one<00:03:29.670> is<00:03:29.790> a<00:03:29.820> nice<00:03:30.060> original

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
well but this one is a nice original

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:33.500 
well but this one is a nice original
example<00:03:31.760> because<00:03:32.760> you<00:03:32.790> can<00:03:33.000> see<00:03:33.150> the<00:03:33.270> paint

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
example because you can see the paint

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:35.420 
example because you can see the paint
and<00:03:33.690> the<00:03:33.750> power<00:03:33.989> head<00:03:34.290> is<00:03:34.470> really<00:03:34.890> really<00:03:35.130> nice

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
and the power head is really really nice
