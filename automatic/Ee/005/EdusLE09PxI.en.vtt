00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
years earlier with other alarm systems

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.620 
years earlier with other alarm systems
that<00:00:16.949> it<00:00:17.400> was<00:00:17.550> made<00:00:17.789> out<00:00:17.820> of<00:00:17.970> plastic<00:00:18.510> and

car makes it simple for him that was
incorporated<00:02:00.540> also<00:02:00.689> in<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.020> factory<00:02:01.380> remote

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
incorporated also in the factory remote

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:02.959 
incorporated also in the factory remote
control<00:02:02.009> so<00:02:02.159> I<00:02:02.189> didn't<00:02:02.490> want<00:02:02.670> him<00:02:02.759> to<00:02:02.939> be

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969

without<00:02:03.420> that<00:02:03.689> so<00:02:04.200> we<00:02:04.350> hooked<00:02:05.130> up<00:02:05.250> ours<00:02:05.700> to<00:02:05.850> pop

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
without that so we hooked up ours to pop

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.700 
without that so we hooked up ours to pop
the<00:02:06.180> trunk<00:02:06.299> also<00:02:06.630> so<00:02:06.990> he's<00:02:07.140> not<00:02:07.290> going<00:02:07.439> to<00:02:07.500> miss

the trunk also so he's not going to miss

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.469 
the trunk also so he's not going to miss
anything<00:02:08.009> so<00:02:08.670> he<00:02:08.759> doesn't<00:02:09.030> have<00:02:09.119> to<00:02:09.239> carry

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
anything so he doesn't have to carry

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:10.820 
anything so he doesn't have to carry
that<00:02:09.599> factory<00:02:10.170> remote

that factory remote
anymore<00:02:11.160> it<00:02:11.790> makes<00:02:12.060> it<00:02:12.210> simple<00:02:12.600> it's<00:02:12.720> just<00:02:12.870> a

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:12.960 
anymore it makes it simple it's just a

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.130 
anymore it makes it simple it's just a
key<00:02:13.170> and<00:02:13.320> our<00:02:13.440> remote<00:02:13.740> control<00:02:14.900> basically<00:02:15.900> if
