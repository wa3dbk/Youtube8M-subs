00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.780 
weren't able to build anti-air until
tech<00:01:48.479> 3<00:01:48.840> would<00:01:49.619> you<00:01:49.770> know<00:01:49.890> that<00:01:49.920> that<00:01:50.549> just

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
tech 3 would you know that that just

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.730 
tech 3 would you know that that just
doesn't<00:01:51.000> make<00:01:51.240> sense<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.720> me<00:01:51.840> that<00:01:52.229> you<00:01:52.649> know

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
doesn't make sense to me that you know

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.310 
doesn't make sense to me that you know
you<00:01:53.159> were<00:01:53.280> really<00:01:53.610> able<00:01:54.000> to<00:01:54.329> exploit<00:01:54.869> that<00:01:54.930> in

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
you were really able to exploit that in

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.069 
you were really able to exploit that in
the<00:01:55.500> game<00:01:55.710> you<00:01:55.920> know<00:01:56.040> ever<00:01:56.850> was<00:01:57.390> able<00:01:57.750> to<00:01:57.899> get

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
the game you know ever was able to get

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.649 
the game you know ever was able to get
air<00:01:58.549> faster<00:01:59.549> you<00:02:00.149> know<00:02:00.270> what<00:02:00.360> I'm<00:02:00.450> saying

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
air faster you know what I'm saying

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.480 
air faster you know what I'm saying
pretty<00:02:00.930> much<00:02:01.020> one<00:02:01.469> I<00:02:01.500> mean<00:02:01.770> obviously<00:02:01.979> that

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
pretty much one I mean obviously that

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:03.859 
pretty much one I mean obviously that
wasn't<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.820> case<00:02:03.000> than<00:02:03.210> most<00:02:03.420> times<00:02:03.659> because

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
wasn't the case than most times because

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.749 
wasn't the case than most times because
there's<00:02:04.049> way<00:02:04.229> to<00:02:04.290> ways<00:02:04.770> to<00:02:04.799> counter<00:02:05.430> and<00:02:05.549> such

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
there's way to ways to counter and such

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:08.359 
there's way to ways to counter and such
but<00:02:06.329> I<00:02:06.390> just<00:02:06.780> feel<00:02:06.990> like<00:02:07.020> you<00:02:07.890> know<00:02:07.950> there<00:02:08.220> was

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
but I just feel like you know there was

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.639 
but I just feel like you know there was
there<00:02:08.610> were<00:02:08.700> small<00:02:09.080> strategic<00:02:10.080> errors<00:02:10.379> in<00:02:10.560> the

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
there were small strategic errors in the

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.430 
there were small strategic errors in the
game<00:02:10.830> like<00:02:11.069> being<00:02:11.280> able<00:02:11.400> to<00:02:11.550> put<00:02:11.879> you

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
game like being able to put you

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.160 
game like being able to put you
units<00:02:12.920> in<00:02:13.250> gates<00:02:13.790> and<00:02:14.150> being<00:02:14.540> able<00:02:14.660> to<00:02:14.900> glitch

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
units in gates and being able to glitch

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.200 
units in gates and being able to glitch
them<00:02:15.440> in<00:02:15.620> there<00:02:15.800> so<00:02:16.070> you<00:02:16.130> couldn't<00:02:16.520> bring<00:02:16.790> tank

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.210 
them in there so you couldn't bring tank

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:19.840 
them in there so you couldn't bring tank
the<00:02:17.510> other<00:02:17.810> size<00:02:18.470> of<00:02:18.740> the<00:02:18.860> map<00:02:19.100> you<00:02:19.580> know<00:02:19.700> you'd

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
the other size of the map you know you'd

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.440 
the other size of the map you know you'd
have<00:02:19.880> to<00:02:20.270> like<00:02:20.900> physically<00:02:21.760> you<00:02:22.760> know<00:02:22.790> be<00:02:23.090> able

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
have to like physically you know be able

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.750 
have to like physically you know be able
to<00:02:23.600> transport<00:02:24.260> them<00:02:24.470> over<00:02:24.800> the<00:02:24.920> gate<00:02:25.130> you<00:02:25.640> know

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
to transport them over the gate you know

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.220 
to transport them over the gate you know
things<00:02:26.150> that<00:02:26.330> really<00:02:26.630> made<00:02:26.900> a<00:02:26.930> big<00:02:27.050> difference

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
things that really made a big difference

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:29.830 
things that really made a big difference
and<00:02:27.830> the<00:02:27.980> long<00:02:28.190> run<00:02:28.520> I'm<00:02:28.730> just<00:02:29.240> hoping<00:02:29.600> are

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
and the long run I'm just hoping are

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.590 
and the long run I'm just hoping are

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
there's more options of other characters

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.840 
there's more options of other characters
you<00:02:36.290> know<00:02:36.320> more<00:02:36.710> maps<00:02:37.040> you<00:02:37.430> know<00:02:37.520> the<00:02:37.670> whole

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
you know more maps you know the whole

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.300 
you know more maps you know the whole
nine<00:02:38.180> so<00:02:38.480> I'm<00:02:38.780> really<00:02:39.080> excited<00:02:39.200> for<00:02:39.710> halo<00:02:40.040> wars
