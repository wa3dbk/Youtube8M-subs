looking at a PS recording mode of 1920 x

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.179 
looking at a PS recording mode of 1920 x
1080<00:00:25.109> at<00:00:25.680> 60p<00:00:26.609> versus<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.660> 30<00:00:27.990> p<00:00:28.320> i<00:00:28.560> want<00:00:29.130> to

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
1080 at 60p versus the 30 p i want to

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.669 
1080 at 60p versus the 30 p i want to
compare<00:00:29.550> that<00:00:29.580> quick<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:30.390> see<00:00:30.779> how<00:00:30.960> that<00:00:31.019> that

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
compare that quick and see how that that

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.190 
compare that quick and see how that that
you<00:00:32.610> know<00:00:32.640> compares<00:00:33.180> to<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.510> standard<00:00:34.050> and

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
you know compares to the standard and

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.799 
you know compares to the standard and
then<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:35.040> water<00:00:35.250> scene<00:00:35.760> selection<00:00:36.480> which<00:00:36.660> is

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
then the water scene selection which is

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.270 
then the water scene selection which is
basically<00:00:37.290> um<00:00:37.620> is<00:00:38.000> just<00:00:39.739> changing<00:00:40.739> your<00:00:41.100> white

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
basically um is just changing your white

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.340 
basically um is just changing your white
balance<00:00:41.489> adjustment<00:00:42.420> for<00:00:42.600> better<00:00:42.780> water<00:00:43.050> and

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
balance adjustment for better water and

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.220 
balance adjustment for better water and
I'll<00:00:43.440> dip<00:00:43.680> that<00:00:43.890> in<00:00:44.100> my<00:00:44.219> fish<00:00:44.489> tank<00:00:44.520> so<00:00:45.120> uh

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.230 
I'll dip that in my fish tank so uh

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.080 
I'll dip that in my fish tank so uh
let's<00:00:46.230> go<00:00:46.469> ahead<00:00:46.590> and<00:00:46.800> do<00:00:47.789> a<00:00:47.850> little

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
let's go ahead and do a little

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.540 
let's go ahead and do a little
comparison<00:00:48.270> here

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:51.550 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:01:40.310 

you

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:46.880 

Oh<00:01:43.640> from<00:01:44.640> what<00:01:44.760> I<00:01:44.820> could<00:01:44.970> see<00:01:45.620> what<00:01:46.620> you<00:01:46.740> got

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
Oh from what I could see what you got

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.450 
Oh from what I could see what you got
going<00:01:47.190> on<00:01:47.310> there<00:01:47.490> Charlie<00:01:47.940> that<00:01:48.600> 60p<00:01:49.460> actually

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
going on there Charlie that 60p actually

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.580 
going on there Charlie that 60p actually
it's<00:01:51.120> hard<00:01:51.330> to<00:01:51.450> tell<00:01:51.660> with<00:01:51.900> that<00:01:51.930> when<00:01:52.560> I

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
it's hard to tell with that when I

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.310 
it's hard to tell with that when I
rendered<00:01:53.070> it<00:01:53.630> they<00:01:54.630> always<00:01:54.750> have<00:01:55.020> little

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
rendered it they always have little

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.930 
rendered it they always have little
choppiness<00:01:55.830> but<00:01:56.220> uh<00:01:56.250> that<00:01:57.150> 60p<00:01:58.070> does<00:01:59.070> seem

00:01:59.930 --> 00:01:59.940 
choppiness but uh that 60p does seem

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.330 
choppiness but uh that 60p does seem
quite<00:02:00.240> a<00:02:00.300> bit<00:02:00.540> smoother<00:02:00.990> when<00:02:01.950> you're<00:02:02.130> looking

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
quite a bit smoother when you're looking

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.340 
quite a bit smoother when you're looking
back<00:02:02.640> at<00:02:02.910> the<00:02:03.060> footage<00:02:03.330> as<00:02:03.660> far<00:02:03.869> as<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.170> white

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
back at the footage as far as the white

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.480 
back at the footage as far as the white
balance<00:02:04.680> it<00:02:05.130> isn't<00:02:05.520> too<00:02:05.670> bad<00:02:06.920> it<00:02:07.920> does<00:02:08.100> look<00:02:08.130> a

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:08.490 
balance it isn't too bad it does look a

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.390 
balance it isn't too bad it does look a
little<00:02:08.580> bit<00:02:08.880> better<00:02:09.119> and<00:02:09.899> it<00:02:10.140> definitely<00:02:10.440> be

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
little bit better and it definitely be

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.280 
little bit better and it definitely be
something<00:02:11.670> worth<00:02:11.940> to<00:02:12.090> try<00:02:12.120> out<00:02:12.600> and<00:02:12.810> up<00:02:12.930> so

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
something worth to try out and up so

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.010 
something worth to try out and up so
yeah<00:02:13.500> in<00:02:14.250> a<00:02:14.370> river<00:02:14.640> or<00:02:14.910> whatever<00:02:15.360> underwater

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
yeah in a river or whatever underwater

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.570 
yeah in a river or whatever underwater
but<00:02:16.590> I'll<00:02:16.739> have<00:02:16.980> to<00:02:17.010> uh<00:02:17.480> and<00:02:18.480> either<00:02:18.600> have<00:02:19.170> to

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
but I'll have to uh and either have to

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.699 
but I'll have to uh and either have to
do<00:02:20.580> some<00:02:20.820> further<00:02:21.000> testing<00:02:21.720> but<00:02:21.959> I<00:02:22.200> definitely

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
do some further testing but I definitely

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:24.710 
do some further testing but I definitely
do<00:02:23.100> see<00:02:23.340> a<00:02:23.370> pretty<00:02:23.850> big<00:02:24.030> difference<00:02:24.209> in<00:02:24.630> the

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
do see a pretty big difference in the

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.360 
do see a pretty big difference in the
60p<00:02:25.380> so<00:02:26.239> there<00:02:27.239> you<00:02:27.330> go
