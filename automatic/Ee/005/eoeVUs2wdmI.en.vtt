00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.029
 then know an extraordinary alarm against thefts in 

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:08.610
 housing the second dealbert to testosterone results 

00:00:16.659 --> 00:00:20.529
 listening to this could only be the digital signal with your house not going well 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.210
 and is that you can also be a victim of the friends of the alien 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:29.230
 but in 2008 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.109
 the statistics have indicated 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:34.559
 that 63 percent of Peruvians have been victims of robbery at home 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.670
 That is why many have seen the need to hire surveillance 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.730
 idea of ​​acquiring a personal security system has been taken by a joseph by 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:44.950
 hundred of limeños 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.150
 the police and the Hellenes can not cope with the crime 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:52.780
 now many companies have appeared to provide security 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:56.720
 with alarm systems for when he leaves home 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.340
 the central idea is what makes 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.760
 the work is intuited people the team in the plant let's say receive information 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:05.990
 of the sensors 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.150
 for any circustance 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.230
 is going to sound a siren 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.120
 that if this age 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.700
 that looks small but has 125 of cibeles 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.610
 and at the same time it will be sequential phone calls one by one 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.610
 statistically after the lack of work 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.310
 security is the main problem of the country 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.200
 this system sends a signal to your cell phone 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.460
 just at the entrance to your home residents elevators recognize movements 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:34.900
 strangers 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.020
 when receiving the phone call one will listen to a voice message 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.970
 recorded by the same user 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:42.060
 asking for help 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.329
 may be let's go the numbers but his name 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.390
 it is a choice 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.310
 remembering for example the secret police number first we go towards the 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.070
 alarm system 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.070
 to see if when I entered the person 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.920
 they really are 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.370
 in 

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.700
 and now we are waiting for the system most of them in the network 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.040
 and even calling us 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.699
 really 

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:10.659
 but fear 

00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:13.849
 long since the system does not work because it is not within the 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:14.489
 home 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:16.409
 they are blowing up the alarms 

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:17.250
 San Miguel 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.090
 Lamolina Miraflores and Groove have become the most 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.309
 insecure of our capital 

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:24.299
 ever 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:27.870
 the creator of this method was the victim of an attempted robbery in the 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:28.930
 groove district 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.700
 based on your own experience and not in accordance with other security methods 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:35.129
 He decided to create his 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:36.830
 What I did was make a design 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:38.239
 things 

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:40.949
 what I wanted to put in an alarm system 

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:43.949
 according to garp iteco designed a building 

00:02:44.749 --> 00:02:48.879
 the system no longer work with a sensor federal delegations is the minimum 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:52.299
 so that a window or door and the alarm will be given in less than a second 

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:55.160
 better safe than sorry 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.440
 if today we have a range of companies that can give us more 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:58.610
 security
