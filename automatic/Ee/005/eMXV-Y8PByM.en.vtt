 changed 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:02.330
 changed by the characteristics of this 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:06.700
 car now we will go open 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:09.250
 car one second 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:12.430
 central locking 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:16.630
 open and I'll show you now 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:20.680
 something in principle can you too 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:25.310
 interested in this car was 

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:29.540
 shown in his journal right here 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:32.060
 try to find on what page on in 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:34.600
 ad in the author there is a link to the site 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.460
 where you can read the full article 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.590
 about this car means well in principle 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.420
 what did I want to tell you here please 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.040
 the machine that talked about 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.500
 page 96 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.800
 if in print this one 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:51.530
 car which means interesting besides 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:54.530
 the fact that the car is visually external 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:59.360
 outside and inside there are some improvements 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:00.979
 Hamon he still alter the official 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:06.430
 dealer here had increased capacity 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:11.480
 Means factory 345 taking into account the refinement 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:14.150
 after firmware it increased to 385 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:15.920
 well , the torque was also increased 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.140
 if you are interested in 30 millimeters 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.540
 That's what the specifications 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.680
 but it is clear that the maximum speed 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:27.920
 equal to 2 150 meters an hour it is limited 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:30.769
 computer and car dynamics up to 100 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.200
 kilometers an hour is about six seconds 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:37.250
 means still repeating at cost 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:40.250
 car this car costs 55,000 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:42.709
 dollars if you're interested come
