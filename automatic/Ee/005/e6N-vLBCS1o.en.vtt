00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:05.100
 H 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.100
 Has 

00:00:08.899 --> 00:00:12.229
 the bigger part of the new episode of the cartoon 

00:00:12.229 --> 00:00:16.369
 This time I discovered Walcott I discovered 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:20.369
 and I want to be there some quirky shortcut and 

00:00:21.749 --> 00:00:23.849
 the first reaction of course 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:25.509
 if the Neuenburg e 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:28.499
 we start with the last nail 

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:31.220
 and this relatively well known 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.060
 Hoffmann Bamberg out accelerates the Mini and then jumps left over this 

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:36.400
 Wonder over 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.200
 who tries to land down on this if a stern place 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.510
 this should be a click in the known 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.130
 The next abbreviation will be used warmly 

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.130
 Roy Israel 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.250
 Reason Warhol 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:56.940
 Sports for the first time 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.940
 to certain places 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.820
 The plaintiff was with the bands at the TuS 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.820
 both professionals abbreviation 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.310
 Father at this point here 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.310
 right here you have to stand 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.950
 as normal 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.050
 Berlin would need Duncan Stelle 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.320
 which is very appealing to laugh Lindenfels 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.300
 under the sprint 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.330
 even if the last guide 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.730
 on the runners 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:36.800
 Abbreviation number three 40 years Roland struggled 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.040
 and here he could not cut short the whole lap 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.060
 at the beginning please just above 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.980
 I assume then also the bridge needs 

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:55.670
 well supplied 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.980
 and then jump over this corner of Umbria 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:01.630
 in this way fast landscape 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:04.860
 henceforth prince 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.860
 so that such Kita picks up 

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:11.620
 that will take him off the track and just drive nothing for 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:13.349
 me 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:17.319
 and Pioneer door a round changes that you can make as the air until you 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.319
 other untreated 

00:02:21.279 --> 00:02:24.569
 the next shortcut despite illness 

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:28.379
 and change this a bit tricky now 

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:31.719
 Drive from the start 

00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:35.859
 from the point where the two percent lines on the Mekong would cost 

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:41.159
 and drinking or throwing the left throw goes the same thing 

00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:44.939
 and pick up Deuce Kita again 

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:48.200
 Step right up and jump through the wall 

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:51.759
 under palm lined lower track section again anonymous 

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:55.779
 can drive from there easy target and has about flea lap 

00:02:55.779 --> 00:02:57.569
 discussed 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:01.769
 which now needs the DAB cuts there is now a mystery 

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:06.789
 and most certainly go straight to the plug here 

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:09.959
 Giant fete over skip 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:13.199
 but what many do not know is that you can almost only whole and abbreviate 

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:18.919
 I'm just not going to jump in on this furniture anymore 

00:03:18.919 --> 00:03:22.069
 worked out is not so easy compensate thought quite well 

00:03:24.079 --> 00:03:29.989
 each from here about gas and then held here and to 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:31.819
 Rounding up 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:32.549
 not much time
