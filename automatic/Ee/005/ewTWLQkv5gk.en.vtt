 makeup with a bright accent on the eyes for 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.490
 this and I will use quite a bit

 colorama green eyeliner and shadow 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.260
 bright green first very important 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.060
 step is the base under the shadow 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.010
 as a base under the shade you can 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.369
 use a non-greasy tonal tool 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:37.950
 I will use tonal foam 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:39.510
 weightless absolutely now i use 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.160
 black pencil to 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.160
 emphasize the ciliary contour 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:01:01.560
 the next step is a bright green pencil i 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:01.560
 I put the devil on the border 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.310
 if suddenly in the process of makeup a little 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.920
 pencil or shadow turned up on 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.760
 tonal tool the same tonal 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.170
 means you can clean it with something 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.650
 border of bright green pencil i 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.450
 I brush with a brush 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.040
 the next step is bright green our kinder 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:59.150
 using the applicator which is 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:02:01.130
 inside is not for those not to go to bed 

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:03.890
 intensively impose 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:06.170
 crushing movements like pat and 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.300
 border intensively applied shadows 

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.840
 Better to shade with a brush and 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:14.959
 further shade the dark border 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:18.640
 pencil on the bottom and better to do it 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:18.640
 with the help of such a flat brush 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.080
 the final touch in any eye makeup is 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.480
 eyelash dyeing 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.610
