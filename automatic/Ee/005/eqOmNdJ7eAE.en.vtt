00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:04.630 
hi my name is David Lee I'm one of the

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:07.080 
hi my name is David Lee I'm one of the
developers<00:00:05.200> on<00:00:05.920> the<00:00:05.950> Microsoft<00:00:06.520> robotics<00:00:06.880> to

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:07.090 
developers on the Microsoft robotics to

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:09.180 
developers on the Microsoft robotics to
do<00:00:07.240> and<00:00:07.630> today<00:00:08.500> I<00:00:08.530> wanted<00:00:08.740> to<00:00:08.800> show<00:00:09.040> you<00:00:09.070> a

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:09.190 
do and today I wanted to show you a

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:10.890 
do and today I wanted to show you a
little<00:00:09.340> bit<00:00:09.460> about<00:00:09.730> our<00:00:09.900> simulation

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:10.900 
little bit about our simulation

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:12.659 
little bit about our simulation
environment<00:00:11.080> and<00:00:11.620> talk<00:00:12.039> about<00:00:12.160> how<00:00:12.400> that

00:00:12.659 --> 00:00:12.669 
environment and talk about how that

00:00:12.669 --> 00:00:14.819 
environment and talk about how that
interacts<00:00:13.150> and<00:00:13.269> how<00:00:13.959> it's<00:00:14.139> very<00:00:14.410> similar<00:00:14.679> to

00:00:14.819 --> 00:00:14.829 
interacts and how it's very similar to

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:16.800 
interacts and how it's very similar to
the<00:00:15.039> real<00:00:15.429> world<00:00:15.459> environment<00:00:15.940> that<00:00:16.660> we're

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:16.810 
the real world environment that we're

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:19.109 
the real world environment that we're
doing<00:00:16.900> the<00:00:17.050> sumo<00:00:17.320> competition<00:00:17.890> on<00:00:18.010> and<00:00:18.939> so

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:19.119 
doing the sumo competition on and so

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:22.290 
doing the sumo competition on and so
what<00:00:19.269> I<00:00:19.300> have<00:00:19.480> here<00:00:19.510> is<00:00:19.840> we<00:00:20.080> have<00:00:20.740> a<00:00:20.949> a<00:00:21.300> physics

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:22.300 
what I have here is we have a a physics

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.779 
what I have here is we have a a physics

users who just want to play around with

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:33.990 
users who just want to play around with
it<00:00:29.339> and<00:00:30.339> we<00:00:31.650> simulate<00:00:32.650> many<00:00:33.340> of<00:00:33.520> the<00:00:33.610> robots

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:34.000 
it and we simulate many of the robots

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.180 
it and we simulate many of the robots
that<00:00:34.180> we<00:00:34.329> also<00:00:34.510> work<00:00:34.930> with<00:00:34.960> in<00:00:35.500> in<00:00:35.770> real<00:00:35.980> life

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:36.190 
that we also work with in in real life

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.160 
that we also work with in in real life
including<00:00:36.910> the<00:00:37.180> iRobot<00:00:37.899> and<00:00:38.289> so<00:00:38.739> in<00:00:39.699> this

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
including the iRobot and so in this

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.319 
including the iRobot and so in this
particular<00:00:41.170> example<00:00:41.680> I've<00:00:42.280> brought<00:00:42.969> up<00:00:43.149> the

00:00:43.319 --> 00:00:43.329 
particular example I've brought up the

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:46.799 
particular example I've brought up the
sumo<00:00:43.750> ring<00:00:43.960> and<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:45.250> iRobot<00:00:45.969> and<00:00:46.180> I<00:00:46.600> can

00:00:46.799 --> 00:00:46.809 
sumo ring and the iRobot and I can

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:49.799 
sumo ring and the iRobot and I can
actually<00:00:47.100> move<00:00:48.100> around<00:00:48.280> in<00:00:49.149> this<00:00:49.480> environment

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:49.809 
actually move around in this environment

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:53.069 
actually move around in this environment
i<00:00:50.199> can<00:00:50.710> zoom<00:00:50.739> in<00:00:51.219> and<00:00:51.250> i<00:00:52.180> can<00:00:52.390> look<00:00:52.510> around<00:00:52.660> at

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:53.079 
i can zoom in and i can look around at

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:55.950 
i can zoom in and i can look around at
the<00:00:53.289> at<00:00:53.530> the<00:00:53.559> robot<00:00:54.039> i<00:00:54.309> can<00:00:54.969> change<00:00:55.449> my<00:00:55.570> view

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960 
the at the robot i can change my view

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.599 
the at the robot i can change my view
and<00:00:56.109> you<00:00:56.170> can<00:00:56.199> see<00:00:56.590> that<00:00:56.620> the<00:00:56.800> actual

00:00:57.599 --> 00:00:57.609 
and you can see that the actual

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:02.279 
and you can see that the actual
wireframe<00:00:58.559> physics<00:00:59.559> what<00:01:00.250> physics<00:01:00.699> cease<00:01:01.289> and

00:01:02.279 --> 00:01:02.289 
wireframe physics what physics cease and

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:05.789 
wireframe physics what physics cease and
I<00:01:03.030> can<00:01:04.030> also<00:01:04.150> see<00:01:04.480> kind<00:01:05.260> of<00:01:05.320> the<00:01:05.440> rendered

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:05.799 
I can also see kind of the rendered

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:09.120 
I can also see kind of the rendered
version<00:01:06.070> of<00:01:06.369> that<00:01:07.049> so<00:01:08.049> if<00:01:08.259> I<00:01:08.409> back<00:01:08.650> back<00:01:08.920> up

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 
version of that so if I back back up

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.320 
version of that so if I back back up
again<00:01:09.430> and<00:01:09.640> I<00:01:09.970> start<00:01:10.360> a

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
again and I start a

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.630 
again and I start a
assume<00:01:12.140> a<00:01:12.260> referee<00:01:12.650> I<00:01:13.040> can<00:01:13.730> pick<00:01:14.200> a<00:01:15.400> couple<00:01:16.400> of

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
assume a referee I can pick a couple of

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.240 
assume a referee I can pick a couple of
different<00:01:17.000> sumo<00:01:17.780> bots<00:01:18.020> that<00:01:18.350> I'd<00:01:18.800> like<00:01:18.920> to<00:01:18.980> try

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
different sumo bots that I'd like to try

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.930 
different sumo bots that I'd like to try
out<00:01:19.490> and<00:01:19.760> I'll<00:01:19.940> try<00:01:20.270> sitting<00:01:21.020> duck<00:01:21.410> and<00:01:21.940> Zuma

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:22.940 
out and I'll try sitting duck and Zuma

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.080 
out and I'll try sitting duck and Zuma
son<00:01:23.260> david<00:01:24.260> lee<00:01:24.610> and<00:01:25.610> i'm<00:01:25.760> going<00:01:25.850> to<00:01:25.940> go<00:01:26.060> ahead

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090 
son david lee and i'm going to go ahead

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.870 
son david lee and i'm going to go ahead
and<00:01:26.300> start<00:01:26.660> those<00:01:26.900> now<00:01:27.620> i'll<00:01:28.310> change<00:01:28.640> this

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
and start those now i'll change this

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.810 
and start those now i'll change this
back<00:01:29.150> just<00:01:29.420> to<00:01:29.570> the<00:01:30.280> vision<00:01:31.280> view<00:01:31.520> and<00:01:31.730> i'm

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
back just to the vision view and i'm

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.630 
back just to the vision view and i'm
going<00:01:31.970> to<00:01:32.060> start<00:01:32.270> the<00:01:32.450> match<00:01:33.280> now<00:01:34.280> the<00:01:34.340> great

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
going to start the match now the great

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.700 
going to start the match now the great
thing<00:01:34.670> is<00:01:34.910> that<00:01:35.030> we<00:01:35.270> get<00:01:35.450> the<00:01:35.570> same<00:01:35.810> sensors<00:01:36.380> in

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
thing is that we get the same sensors in

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.740 
thing is that we get the same sensors in
the<00:01:37.010> physics<00:01:37.400> environment<00:01:37.970> that<00:01:38.060> we<00:01:38.210> also<00:01:38.390> get

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:38.750 
the physics environment that we also get

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.840 
the physics environment that we also get
in<00:01:38.930> real<00:01:39.110> life<00:01:39.350> so<00:01:39.740> if<00:01:40.100> you<00:01:40.520> don't<00:01:40.610> have<00:01:40.820> a

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
in real life so if you don't have a

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.580 
in real life so if you don't have a
robot<00:01:41.270> available<00:01:41.750> to<00:01:41.870> you<00:01:41.960> right<00:01:42.110> now<00:01:42.140> you<00:01:42.350> can

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
robot available to you right now you can

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.320 
robot available to you right now you can
get<00:01:42.680> started<00:01:42.830> immediately<00:01:43.190> using<00:01:44.090> the

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.330 
get started immediately using the

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.060 
get started immediately using the
physics<00:01:44.690> environment<00:01:45.170> and<00:01:45.290> you<00:01:45.380> can<00:01:45.530> see<00:01:45.830> in

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
physics environment and you can see in

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:47.950 
physics environment and you can see in
this<00:01:46.220> particular<00:01:46.460> physics<00:01:47.360> environment<00:01:47.840> that

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
this particular physics environment that

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.560 
this particular physics environment that
if<00:01:48.170> the<00:01:48.830> robot<00:01:49.040> falls<00:01:49.520> out<00:01:49.760> and<00:01:49.790> tips<00:01:50.210> over

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
if the robot falls out and tips over

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.480 
if the robot falls out and tips over
it's<00:01:51.229> not<00:01:51.440> going<00:01:51.590> to<00:01:51.680> be<00:01:51.800> the<00:01:52.070> win<00:01:52.220> the<00:01:52.310> winds

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
it's not going to be the win the winds

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.160 
it's not going to be the win the winds
wheels<00:01:52.880> spin<00:01:53.270> it's<00:01:53.450> not<00:01:53.600> going<00:01:53.690> to<00:01:53.780> be<00:01:53.900> able<00:01:53.930> to

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:54.170 
wheels spin it's not going to be able to

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.130 
wheels spin it's not going to be able to
go<00:01:54.320> anywhere<00:01:55.390> so<00:01:56.390> it<00:01:56.479> works<00:01:56.660> very<00:01:56.869> much<00:01:56.960> like

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.140 
go anywhere so it works very much like

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.859 
go anywhere so it works very much like
the<00:01:57.590> real<00:01:57.800> life<00:01:58.130> environment<00:01:58.850> it's<00:01:59.240> great<00:01:59.600> for

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
the real life environment it's great for

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:02.380 
the real life environment it's great for
schools<00:02:00.200> as<00:02:00.410> well<00:02:00.440> because<00:02:01.369> if<00:02:01.910> you<00:02:02.090> only<00:02:02.210> have

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
schools as well because if you only have

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.050 
schools as well because if you only have
one<00:02:02.570> or<00:02:02.690> two<00:02:02.810> robots<00:02:03.229> and<00:02:03.500> many<00:02:04.060> individuals

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
one or two robots and many individuals

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.460 
one or two robots and many individuals
they<00:02:05.300> can<00:02:06.729> they<00:02:07.729> can<00:02:07.760> all<00:02:08.600> work<00:02:08.959> on<00:02:09.170> their<00:02:09.350> own

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
they can they can all work on their own

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.410 
they can they can all work on their own
algorithms<00:02:10.070> and<00:02:10.250> then<00:02:10.490> when<00:02:10.640> the<00:02:10.850> physical

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:11.420 
algorithms and then when the physical

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:12.910 
algorithms and then when the physical
robot<00:02:11.690> is<00:02:11.810> available<00:02:12.230> they<00:02:12.380> can<00:02:12.530> try<00:02:12.709> it<00:02:12.770> out

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
robot is available they can try it out

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.040 
robot is available they can try it out
there<00:02:13.160> as<00:02:13.280> well<00:02:13.459> so<00:02:14.180> here<00:02:14.330> these<00:02:14.510> are<00:02:14.570> moving

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
there as well so here these are moving

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:22.270 
there as well so here these are moving
around<00:02:15.170> you<00:02:16.120> and<00:02:19.269> we<00:02:20.269> have<00:02:20.360> a<00:02:20.420> very<00:02:21.280> simple

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
around you and we have a very simple

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.130 
around you and we have a very simple
algorithm<00:02:22.850> right<00:02:23.000> now<00:02:23.180> that's<00:02:23.450> that<00:02:23.750> this<00:02:23.959> is

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.140 
algorithm right now that's that this is

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.740 
algorithm right now that's that this is
running<00:02:24.440> with<00:02:24.590> but<00:02:25.040> number<00:02:25.280> one<00:02:25.360> is<00:02:26.360> the<00:02:26.480> one

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
running with but number one is the one

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.210 
running with but number one is the one
that<00:02:26.900> I<00:02:26.959> wrote<00:02:27.260> this<00:02:27.380> is<00:02:27.530> my<00:02:27.680> little<00:02:27.890> daughter

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
that I wrote this is my little daughter

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.900 
that I wrote this is my little daughter
right<00:02:28.489> here<00:02:28.900> and<00:02:30.040> and<00:02:31.040> this<00:02:31.190> one<00:02:31.400> wins<00:02:31.610> every

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:31.910 
right here and and this one wins every

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.570 
right here and and this one wins every
time<00:02:31.940> what<00:02:32.300> do<00:02:32.360> you<00:02:32.450> know
