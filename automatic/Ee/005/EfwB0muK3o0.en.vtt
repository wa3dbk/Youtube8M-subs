00:00:00.839 --> 00:00:05.610
 Hello everyone today received a package with 

00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:08.740
 children's wrist watches 

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:11.429
 at the time of the order did not cost 508 rubles 

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:22.179
 delivery took only 18 days 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:24.820
 let's open and watch the clock 

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:27.269
 wrapped up by some kind of dirty pimply 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.269
 film 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.470
 spare battery available 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.829
 Here is the watch itself 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.739
 buttons work 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:03.780
 there is a backlight on the clock 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:06.939
 bracelet made of plastic 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.520
 plastic is so flexible rather even it 

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:14.549
 rubber they plastics 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:20.439
 I hope you can see how it bends 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:25.150
 some kind of clasp as her 

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:28.140
 open an account I can not understand like this 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:32.649
 it opens from the inside 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:34.840
 the fastener is pretty tight I don't know how 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:36.149
 the child will be able to cope with such 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:44.820
 clasp 

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:44.820
 look at the back cover 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:52.090
 it is written that they are protected water well 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:56.960
 most likely splash protection 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:02:00.939
 present clock can display time 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:03.829
 seconds date and day of the week 

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:08.929
 Well , I suppose the alarm clock is there because 

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:11.649
 How to hear a beep sound 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:11.649
 stopwatch 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:27.560
 buttons like that is not very good 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:31.519
 you honestly are pressed then you are not pressed 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:34.610
 probably pressed clock must be disassembled 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:36.650
 and see what's inside there about feet 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.349
 the fact that I’m kid’s clock 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.330
 got excited like that the clock looks on 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:42.739
 my hand 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:45.379
 watch size and bracelet size 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:48.099
 big enough and on the children's hand everything 

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:51.079
 it will look most likely ridiculous 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:53.500
 maybe the clock is intended for adults 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:56.510
 who love to play lego constructors 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.430
 a little later of course I will say the size 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.519
 bracelet and watch size 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.609
 but first let's see what's there 

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:03.609
 inside 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.530
 that's the way the watch looks from the inside 

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:22.349
 there is a large enough here 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:24.409
 battery and what the Chinese sent here 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:28.010
 I personally do not understand this little one 

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:31.099
 probably it was just a gift 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:33.390
 let's try to get the mechanism 

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:37.769
 let's see what the problem was with 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:43.109
 buttons yes everything seems normal 

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:46.200
 no problem should be here 

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:50.299
 buttons are pressed normally buttons 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:53.879
 by the way as you see on the springs 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:56.959
 let's collect everything back try 

00:03:53.879 --> 00:04:00.930
 let's test the clock at least in the water 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:04.950
 poured a full sink of water run 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:07.590
 stopwatch and let the clock 15-20 minutes 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:10.609
 swim see if water can 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.609
 leak inside 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:20.510
 somehow crookedly I put them like this 

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:20.510
 probably it will be better 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.300
 us 

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:41.480
 It took almost 19 minutes and it seems to me that 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:42.490
 for our test of this time is quite 

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:45.920
 enough 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:47.780
 let's still by pushing the buttons maybe 

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:51.590
 it somehow contributes to penetration 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:54.770
 water inside in general in general 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:56.750
 the clock seems to be okay no 

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:59.780
 glass misting 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:02.530
 I do not observe, but now I will sort it out and 

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:02.530
 take a closer look 

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:17.460
 well let's see if water has penetrated 

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:24.820
 inside 

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:29.320
 so far no water i'm watching on 

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:34.690
 buttons like everything is okay either 

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:37.960
 slightest droplet mechanism too 

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:42.340
 absolutely dry so what can I say 

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:48.220
 what is a waterproof test 

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:55.170
 the watch successfully weighed the size of the case 

00:06:48.220 --> 00:07:02.730
 43 millimeter hours at 42 

00:06:55.170 --> 00:07:08.320
 dial width 28 dial height 

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:13.630
 about 16 body thickness almost 13 

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:19.560
 millimeters bracelet width 29 it 

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:26.680
 thickness almost 7 millimeters watch weight 

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:30.070
 makes 70 grams such children 

00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:32.590
 clock with non- child sizes link to
