00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.930
 how they absorb all the juices that 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.939
 they are forming the mass themselves and those 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.430
 They are the ones who rule the baton with 

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:13.680
 applications here we put all the 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:16.230
