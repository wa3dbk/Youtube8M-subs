00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.160 
coming out I think that's why we can't
get<00:02:14.910> this<00:02:15.090> one<00:02:15.270> to<00:02:15.360> go<00:02:15.450> away<00:02:15.570> because<00:02:15.840> I<00:02:15.959> can't

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
get this one to go away because I can't

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:25.190 
get this one to go away because I can't
flush<00:02:16.410> it<00:02:20.720> a<00:02:23.420> little<00:02:24.420> bit<00:02:24.510> more<00:02:24.750> right<00:02:24.959> here<00:02:25.140> I
