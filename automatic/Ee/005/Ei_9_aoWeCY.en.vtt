00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.760
 the world around whoever lucy is kidney 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:53.070

 mailbox can turn into it and 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.720
 hide here on the map 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.479
 I'm sitting here, so hidden here 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.580
 the whole and our opponent that is what it is 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:16.410
 soldiers in 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:22.050
 where are you where are you let's write m here 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:26.640
 yes I am here somewhere I am here yes let's look 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:28.170
 fault and in short i turn he is looking for me 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.959
 that is, this game is like hide and seek 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.850
 just look for each other he me 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:34.880
 wo n't find in a minute then he will 

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.980
 hide I'll run around looking for him 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.290
 now here is a top view of another mode 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.940
 games tom kind of exactly the third person then 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:48.090
 eat and hide from a third party need 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:48.690
 and how to look for you, too, from 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:53.989
 first person 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:53.989
 so where says i will write here 

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:59.670
 interesting question man 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:03.030
 you saw him at first as if 

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:05.519
 checked this hydrant as this aria 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:07.680
 torture is like an ordinary hydrant 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:10.070
 probably close to the stop sign was 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.480
 tricky you probably don't put so close 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:15.450
 our shoot me they did not take their lives 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:19.380
 but he didn't kill me and how would he run 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:21.239
 further, that is, one shot saved me 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.160
 when once again faster shaft he would have won 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:25.140
 and now he is looking for me somewhere else 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:28.920
 better place certainly not to move 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:31.770
 there is time in one place here it is 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:34.110
 I no longer find the time to move to 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:40.680
 end and 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:44.160
 I win yes yes rub wind pro 5 and again 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:49.680
 I play for this, that is, he just for 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:51.030
 proppa he plays for alien I 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:57.120
 playing as a soldier 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:58.920
 i need to find him so control you 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:00.900
 I will say it here is not clear look 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:04.580
 in general , somehow everything jumps and it still 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:08.100
 I canâ€™t drive like this 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:10.170
 the buttons themselves are pressed I click on the left 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:13.340
 me the whole screen jerks what's up 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:17.329
 My sensor is dirty, I do not understand at all 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:22.260
 how to manage here or something else is not right 

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:26.160
 generally unrealistically shorter than opa cho 

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:30.870
 the box here climbs yes damn diets behind the box 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:34.050
 oh my gosh there it was he give it over 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:36.120
 damn run in general are such things 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:38.220
 management let me down something was not 

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:42.450
 so although pasha once played everything was more 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:46.680
 less so let's click now 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:49.380
 own game choose next mode so 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.720
 map let it be and look at the room 

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:54.060
 see how many rooms and that is the game 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:05:00.720
 there are enough players here let's hit 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:05:06.000
 I want to start on the map where 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:11.340
 what would be the third person view 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:13.620
 show you another such game mode then 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:15.990
 is there choose whom you will 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:18.690
 play generally play got general all 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:24.030
 so let's guys all ready click from 

00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:26.460
 starting preferably 3 for 3 play very 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:34.470
 interesting here damn it again that kind 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:39.770
 above yes damn I stuck a barrel barrel 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:48.620
 barrel barrel I'm barrel barrel I'm everything 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:48.620
 I sit here a barrel deafly 

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:55.949
 okay damn again I did not get on this mode 

00:05:54.630 --> 00:05:59.669
 I'm somehow in the third person 

00:05:55.949 --> 00:06:05.639
 fun though that is hold you 

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:07.919
 for many years, let's look for this one in short 

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:08.790
 so shown that is you run like in 

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:10.410
 Kalash shooter 

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:12.900
 and shoot at all this object 

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:16.289
 directing sight here a 

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:20.910
 the sermon on the plan of the pull but he runs 

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:22.470
 also direct to some kind of barrel there 

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:25.770
 or something else to your sight it 

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:27.479
 turn here and done there 

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:30.300
 as a top view I just run for 

00:06:27.479 --> 00:06:30.960
 the screen and there somewhere hiding there if you 

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:33.090
 looking for 

00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:34.770
 how would you fade a crane to write 

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:37.380
 wait 20 seconds while the player is behind 

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:40.169
 hiding here and wait 20 seconds and then 

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:43.080
 already run and start to peel at all 

00:06:40.169 --> 00:06:45.330
 environmental objects I already 

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:50.849
 hit along the way the video leaves by different 

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:52.650
 to the sides and as if by these barrels are very 

00:06:50.849 --> 00:06:53.940
 cool to hide near the red barrels 

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:56.190
 the one with the red barrel explode and 

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:58.680
 sisters on a red barrel he will explode 

00:06:56.190 --> 00:07:03.169
 how would die and then rise somewhere 

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:08.910
 there so so try white 

00:07:03.169 --> 00:07:12.870
 that is, the 1 found already found let's 

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:17.360
 something write a mod emoticon 

00:07:12.870 --> 00:07:17.360
 write here 

00:07:18.169 --> 00:07:26.870
 I do not know, they will not find me 

00:07:23.419 --> 00:07:28.430
 honestly damn well I found a dude 

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:32.629
 only from those who have not turned 

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:34.580
 object dudes just stoked standing in 

00:07:32.629 --> 00:07:39.740
 the form of an alien didn't fit them and 

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:42.169
 killed all and those who turned into 

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:47.180
 objects and hiding very hard to find 

00:07:42.169 --> 00:07:50.449
 in general, so the juice remains a minute 40 seconds 

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:51.439
 in general guys are such a game 

00:07:50.449 --> 00:07:53.240
 cool 

00:07:51.439 --> 00:07:55.189
 very original though a little bit on 

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:58.370
 Of course crooked by optimization but 

00:07:55.189 --> 00:08:01.490
 You can play and create games 

00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:03.650
 play games and enjoy these 

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:06.080
 strands with you would be a gamer 

00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:10.240
