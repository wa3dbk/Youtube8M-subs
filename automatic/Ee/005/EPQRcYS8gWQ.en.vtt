00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:01.680 
hey everybody it's Brandon Schaefer I

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:03.320 
hey everybody it's Brandon Schaefer I
just<00:00:01.920> want<00:00:02.070> to<00:00:02.159> mention<00:00:02.490> a<00:00:02.580> few<00:00:02.610> color<00:00:02.970> schemes

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.330 
just want to mention a few color schemes

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.090 
just want to mention a few color schemes
here<00:00:03.659> and<00:00:04.319> if<00:00:04.440> you're<00:00:04.560> wondering<00:00:04.890> why<00:00:04.980> you

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
here and if you're wondering why you

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.710 
here and if you're wondering why you
should<00:00:05.279> learn<00:00:05.400> about<00:00:05.609> color<00:00:05.879> schemes<00:00:06.240> the

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
should learn about color schemes the

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.570 
should learn about color schemes the
main<00:00:06.870> reason<00:00:07.200> is<00:00:07.259> to<00:00:07.470> recognize<00:00:08.069> them<00:00:08.370> and

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
main reason is to recognize them and

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.400 
main reason is to recognize them and
identify<00:00:08.700> them<00:00:09.450> when<00:00:09.599> looking<00:00:09.960> at<00:00:10.110> other

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
identify them when looking at other

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:11.990 
identify them when looking at other
artists<00:00:11.010> work<00:00:11.190> and<00:00:11.460> try<00:00:11.610> to<00:00:11.670> incorporate

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
artists work and try to incorporate

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.820 
artists work and try to incorporate
these<00:00:12.540> into<00:00:12.599> your<00:00:12.990> own<00:00:13.110> work<00:00:13.320> so<00:00:13.530> let's<00:00:13.710> get

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
these into your own work so let's get

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.279 
these into your own work so let's get
into<00:00:14.070> it<00:00:14.219> here<00:00:14.660> the<00:00:15.660> first<00:00:15.900> one<00:00:16.109> is

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
into it here the first one is

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.790 
into it here the first one is
monochromatic<00:00:16.920> which<00:00:17.609> is<00:00:17.850> just<00:00:18.150> one<00:00:18.390> color

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:18.800 
monochromatic which is just one color

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.250 
monochromatic which is just one color
with<00:00:19.800> white<00:00:20.400> or<00:00:20.430> black<00:00:20.789> mixed<00:00:21.510> in<00:00:21.660> so<00:00:22.050> it's

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
with white or black mixed in so it's

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.640 
with white or black mixed in so it's
light<00:00:22.800> tense<00:00:23.130> and<00:00:23.430> dark<00:00:23.609> tense<00:00:23.880> of<00:00:24.350> one<00:00:25.350> color

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
light tense and dark tense of one color

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.849 
light tense and dark tense of one color
so<00:00:26.720> you<00:00:27.720> could<00:00:27.840> do<00:00:27.900> a<00:00:27.930> whole<00:00:28.109> painting<00:00:28.380> of<00:00:28.619> red

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
so you could do a whole painting of red

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.890 
so you could do a whole painting of red
or<00:00:29.070> all<00:00:29.189> painting<00:00:29.519> a<00:00:29.580> blue<00:00:29.760> etc<00:00:29.939> pretty<00:00:30.539> simple

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
or all painting a blue etc pretty simple

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:31.690 
or all painting a blue etc pretty simple
next<00:00:31.260> one

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:31.700 
next one

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:37.119 
next one
complimentary<00:00:33.140> so<00:00:34.140> on<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.559> color<00:00:34.770> wheel<00:00:34.890> here

00:00:37.119 --> 00:00:37.129 
complimentary so on the color wheel here

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:39.770 
complimentary so on the color wheel here
it's<00:00:38.129> choosing<00:00:38.640> opposites<00:00:39.360> on<00:00:39.510> the<00:00:39.600> color

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
it's choosing opposites on the color

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.110 
it's choosing opposites on the color
wheel<00:00:39.899> so<00:00:40.290> red<00:00:40.530> and<00:00:40.710> green<00:00:40.920> blue<00:00:41.850> and<00:00:42.030> orange

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
wheel so red and green blue and orange

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.010 
wheel so red and green blue and orange
etc<00:00:43.020> and<00:00:43.320> by<00:00:43.950> mixing<00:00:44.219> these<00:00:44.820> two<00:00:45.149> together<00:00:45.600> you

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
etc and by mixing these two together you

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.770 
etc and by mixing these two together you
also<00:00:46.200> make<00:00:46.559> neutrals<00:00:47.129> so<00:00:47.390> there's<00:00:48.390> a<00:00:48.480> lot<00:00:48.629> of

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
also make neutrals so there's a lot of

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.479 
also make neutrals so there's a lot of
versatility<00:00:49.260> you<00:00:49.559> can<00:00:49.710> have<00:00:49.860> with<00:00:50.070> just<00:00:50.219> using

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
versatility you can have with just using

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.770 
versatility you can have with just using
a<00:00:50.850> complimentary<00:00:51.600> color<00:00:51.840> palette<00:00:53.629> we'll<00:00:54.629> get

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
a complimentary color palette we'll get

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.920 
a complimentary color palette we'll get
into<00:00:54.899> that<00:00:55.170> in<00:00:55.860> a<00:00:56.129> little<00:00:56.160> bit<00:00:56.489> here<00:00:56.930> split

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
into that in a little bit here split

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.610 
into that in a little bit here split
complementary<00:00:58.230> is<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:59.100> next<00:00:59.460> one<00:01:00.440> which<00:01:01.440> is<00:01:01.469> a

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
complementary is the next one which is a

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.529 
complementary is the next one which is a
variation<00:01:02.250> of<00:01:02.340> the<00:01:02.489> complementary<00:01:03.180> it's

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
variation of the complementary it's

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.500 
variation of the complementary it's
using<00:01:03.960> two<00:01:04.199> adjacent<00:01:04.589> colors<00:01:05.220> on<00:01:05.760> each<00:01:05.820> side

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
using two adjacent colors on each side

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.670 
using two adjacent colors on each side
of<00:01:06.619> one<00:01:07.619> opposite<00:01:08.220> so<00:01:09.080> for<00:01:10.080> instance<00:01:10.380> if<00:01:10.560> you

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
of one opposite so for instance if you

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.010 
of one opposite so for instance if you
have<00:01:10.830> yellow<00:01:11.189> and<00:01:11.369> purple<00:01:11.689> you<00:01:12.689> would<00:01:12.840> use

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
have yellow and purple you would use

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.190 
have yellow and purple you would use
yellow<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.590> then<00:01:13.710> you<00:01:13.830> would<00:01:13.950> use<00:01:14.750> red<00:01:15.750> violet

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
yellow and then you would use red violet

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.499 
yellow and then you would use red violet
and<00:01:16.320> blue<00:01:16.439> violet<00:01:16.979> so<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.790> two<00:01:17.970> colors<00:01:18.450> that

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
and blue violet so the two colors that

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.160 
and blue violet so the two colors that
are<00:01:18.689> on<00:01:18.780> the<00:01:18.869> opposite<00:01:19.320> sides<00:01:19.380> of<00:01:20.340> purple

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:21.170 
are on the opposite sides of purple

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:23.749 
are on the opposite sides of purple
analogous<00:01:22.170> that's<00:01:22.740> using<00:01:23.100> four<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.520> five

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
analogous that's using four to five

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.730 
analogous that's using four to five
colors<00:01:24.450> that<00:01:24.689> are<00:01:24.810> adjacent<00:01:25.110> on<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.560> color

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
colors that are adjacent on the color

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.929 
colors that are adjacent on the color
wheel<00:01:25.830> and<00:01:26.220> a<00:01:27.030> lot<00:01:27.360> of<00:01:27.479> these<00:01:28.700> you<00:01:29.700> know<00:01:29.820> that

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
wheel and a lot of these you know that

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.399 
wheel and a lot of these you know that
creates<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.360> lot<00:01:30.509> of<00:01:30.540> harmony<00:01:31.020> in<00:01:31.110> your<00:01:31.200> work

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
creates a lot of harmony in your work

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.390 
creates a lot of harmony in your work
using<00:01:31.680> a<00:01:31.890> lot<00:01:32.070> of<00:01:32.100> reds<00:01:33.000> yellows<00:01:33.229> oranges<00:01:34.400> and

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
using a lot of reds yellows oranges and

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.920 
using a lot of reds yellows oranges and
greens<00:01:35.850> all<00:01:36.450> together<00:01:37.640> very<00:01:38.640> nice<00:01:38.930> harmony

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
greens all together very nice harmony

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.260 
greens all together very nice harmony
but<00:01:40.290> you<00:01:40.380> also<00:01:40.530> want<00:01:40.860> contrasting<00:01:41.729> tones<00:01:42.000> as

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
but you also want contrasting tones as

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.210 
but you also want contrasting tones as
well<00:01:42.479> so<00:01:43.079> a<00:01:43.110> lot<00:01:43.200> of<00:01:43.350> those<00:01:43.530> shadows<00:01:43.770> would<00:01:44.070> be

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
well so a lot of those shadows would be

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.190 
well so a lot of those shadows would be
darker<00:01:44.729> etc<00:01:46.759> triad<00:01:47.759> this<00:01:48.420> is<00:01:48.600> three<00:01:48.899> colors

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
darker etc triad this is three colors

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.590 
darker etc triad this is three colors
evenly<00:01:49.649> spaced<00:01:49.979> but<00:01:50.310> it<00:01:50.549> creates<00:01:50.909> a<00:01:51.030> triangle

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
evenly spaced but it creates a triangle

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.090 
evenly spaced but it creates a triangle
on<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:52.200> color<00:01:52.710> wheel<00:01:54.590> tetrad<00:01:55.590> act<00:01:55.770> is<00:01:55.890> two

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
on the color wheel tetrad act is two

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.459 
on the color wheel tetrad act is two
complementary<00:01:56.850> 'aa<00:01:56.939> ranged<00:01:57.479> in<00:01:57.630> a<00:01:57.780> rectangle

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
complementary 'aa ranged in a rectangle

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.780 
complementary 'aa ranged in a rectangle
on<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:59.009> wheel<00:02:00.860> but<00:02:01.860> it's<00:02:02.009> just<00:02:02.130> two<00:02:02.340> pairs<00:02:02.700> of

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
on the wheel but it's just two pairs of

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.749 
on the wheel but it's just two pairs of
complementary<00:02:03.420> and<00:02:04.100> then<00:02:05.100> the<00:02:05.219> square<00:02:05.549> is

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
complementary and then the square is

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:09.290 
complementary and then the square is
four<00:02:06.000> colors<00:02:06.360> evenly<00:02:06.840> spaced<00:02:07.789> which<00:02:08.789> again<00:02:09.119> is

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
four colors evenly spaced which again is

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.680 
four colors evenly spaced which again is
just<00:02:09.330> two<00:02:10.020> complementary<00:02:10.739> pairs

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
just two complementary pairs

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.950 
just two complementary pairs
so<00:02:13.700> hopefully<00:02:14.700> I<00:02:14.760> give<00:02:14.910> you<00:02:15.000> some<00:02:15.270> insight<00:02:15.720> and

so hopefully I give you some insight and

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:19.460 
so hopefully I give you some insight and
you<00:02:16.050> can<00:02:16.200> mix<00:02:16.440> and<00:02:16.620> match<00:02:16.740> these<00:02:17.360> you<00:02:18.360> know<00:02:18.510> the

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
you can mix and match these you know the

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.120 
you can mix and match these you know the
color<00:02:19.680> schemes<00:02:20.040> it<00:02:21.380> you<00:02:22.380> don't<00:02:22.590> have<00:02:22.710> to<00:02:22.920> just

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
color schemes it you don't have to just

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
color schemes it you don't have to just
use<00:02:23.190> one<00:02:23.670> in<00:02:24.270> each<00:02:24.510> pane<00:02:25.730> you<00:02:26.730> know<00:02:26.880> you<00:02:26.940> can

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
use one in each pane you know you can

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.970 
use one in each pane you know you can
use<00:02:27.300> mini<00:02:27.540> you<00:02:27.690> can<00:02:27.840> use<00:02:27.960> analogous<00:02:28.560> and<00:02:28.830> then

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
use mini you can use analogous and then

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.190 
use mini you can use analogous and then
also<00:02:29.460> use<00:02:29.880> the<00:02:30.060> complementary<00:02:30.780> it<00:02:30.870> can't<00:02:31.080> you

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
also use the complementary it can't you

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.290 
also use the complementary it can't you
use<00:02:31.350> complement<00:02:31.920> or<00:02:32.010> you<00:02:32.130> all<00:02:32.280> the<00:02:32.430> time

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
use complement or you all the time

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.260 
use complement or you all the time
reds<00:02:33.810> and<00:02:33.930> greens<00:02:34.140> and<00:02:34.790> you<00:02:35.790> know<00:02:35.910> it's<00:02:36.060> all

work and see you know trying to critique
it<00:05:00.789> and<00:05:01.030> think<00:05:01.210> what<00:05:01.569> makes<00:05:01.870> this<00:05:02.229> what<00:05:03.220> would

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:03.340 
it and think what makes this what would

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.600 
it and think what makes this what would
make<00:05:03.520> this<00:05:03.729> better<00:05:04.030> why<00:05:04.330> does<00:05:04.509> it<00:05:04.659> not<00:05:04.810> look

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:05.610 
make this better why does it not look

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:09.059 
make this better why does it not look
good<00:05:06.610> but<00:05:07.000> just<00:05:07.960> focus<00:05:08.259> on<00:05:08.409> the<00:05:08.500> color<00:05:08.680> theory

00:05:09.059 --> 00:05:09.069 
good but just focus on the color theory

00:05:09.069 --> 00:05:11.520 
good but just focus on the color theory
and<00:05:09.099> see<00:05:09.610> how<00:05:09.729> you<00:05:09.789> could<00:05:10.090> improve<00:05:10.389> it<00:05:10.900> just

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:11.530 
and see how you could improve it just

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:14.100 
and see how you could improve it just
try<00:05:11.650> to<00:05:11.710> think<00:05:11.919> of<00:05:12.069> it<00:05:12.190> that<00:05:12.219> way<00:05:12.520> so<00:05:13.110> hopefully

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110 
try to think of it that way so hopefully

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:15.420
