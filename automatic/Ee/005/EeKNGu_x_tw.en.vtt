00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:11.429
 Top game in German ice hockey 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.440
 league between the kÃ¶lner sharks and the 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.000
 Eagles from Mannheim and one 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.650
 interesting game for him mirko 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.869
 He had last night against the 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.000
 hannover scorpions his first de l tor 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.220
 scored on the other side 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.380
 Andreas Falk caused a stir 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.810
 Swedish newcomer to the cologne 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.590
 I said I do not know a single player 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.810
 from Mannheim 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.329
 but uwe krupp his training team 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.980
 defends the important thing is what 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.559
 Player pointing on the ice and 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.700
 they were cheered on by over 16,000 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.530
 415 fans in the Cologne lanxess arena 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.870
 into the game and the mannheimer 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:50.100
 same with the first opportunity 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:53.489
 In this case, they test the youri 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.440
 ziffzer out for the injured danny 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:58.620
 the birch stands between the posts 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.859
 not quite so with this 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:06.379
 dangerous shot from now but the 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.379
 Cologne is the leading team 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:13.619
 first opportunity for philip gogulla 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:16.400
 here on the way to saisontor number 65 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.900
 times so far was successful and 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.490
 fail here among other things to dennis 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.320
 endras but the cologne 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.350
 they let themselves be forgiven by one 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:29.310
 opportunity does not discourage next 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:34.520
 chance alexander white is approaching here 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.520
 dangerous to the 10 for the sharks 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.000
 excellent mood that seems the 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.909
 Cologne despite the defeat last 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:45.990
 to drive against Ingolstadt on 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:47.880
 holmqvist minaj and then the single 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.610
 referee decides immediately 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.350
 gate later demand the video proof 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.290
 but the decision remains 1 0 for 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:59.570
 cologne and nathan robinson of all things 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:02.219
 next to robinson the 2011 harold circle 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:06.000
 you had been sorted out telling her that 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:08.619
 some for the cattle sharks in ins 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.909
 second third and continue the hr 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.120
 the trigger and the goal 

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:19.170
 22 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:19.170
 rok ticar with his third goal of the season 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:28.000
 the 23 year old takes advantage of the opportunity 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:33.360
 after you first turn in here 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:36.730
 has prepared this puck excellent 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:39.660
 and again, it is cologne here despite 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:43.269
 the 2 to 0 zoffen bar are not gogulla 

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:44.549
 again with the huge chance and again 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:47.410
 he missed 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:49.349
 Season 6 against the eagle 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:52.599
 Mannheim 

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:56.230
 from now on but the mannheimer with 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:58.680
 clearly more play proportions seem like 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:02.109
 replaced with the first one 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:05.560
 opportunity by the blow of 

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:08.829
 frank wall but ultimately youri 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:14.590
 ziffzer sure afterwards still scramble ago 

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:16.870
 his goal but ultimately the 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:20.549
 able despite this interesting 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:24.239
 be calmed down 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:26.139
 into the final third and easily the 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.790
 mannheimer with the first opportunity 

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:29.049
 through this shot of adam mitchell 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.379
 but the scene 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:35.560
 she continues unabridged mannheim 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:39.720
 it is still moving forward again 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:41.709
 Girl 's eye and 70 again 

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.030
 special game also for youri ziffzer 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:45.940
 you can feel that 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:49.389
 because he plays against his 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:52.389
 father in law in harold circle of 

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:54.579
 Father of his girlfriend but just the 

00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:59.049
 team of harry circle she lays 

00:03:54.579 --> 00:04:01.959
 aggressively continue to next chance and 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:03.510
 now in powerplay for the one time 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:07.120
 the gate 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:10.299
 marcel goc with the 16 mannheimer 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:13.660
 powerplay-goal the lonely league top 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:14.930
 and he brings his team here 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:18.440
 cologne restore 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:22.280
 and mannheim now with upper water 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:26.419
 now mannheim the stronger team again 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:29.960
 marcel goc forgiving here and again 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:32.449
 the scene recut further next 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.520
 chance for a god for you again 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:37.460
 yanick lehoux and the best 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:39.590
 Template of the de l shows at gates 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:43.449
 shoot off and anja but his 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.449
 it is not specialty 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:49.580
 We are already in the final seconds 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:51.020
 you risk everything again brings 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.770
 the sixth field player 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:57.229
 but cologne then comes to the disc and 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:05:02.180
 scored by felix contactor 

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:06.199
 empty-net-goal 3 to 1 the endstand for 

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:11.630
 The clowns are doing so despite the 

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:14.750
 free rid of mad mannheimer attacks 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:17.150
 can and thus a new victory in 

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:19.389
 can secure the lanxess arena and the 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:22.389
 Table guide to the Adler Mannheim 

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:22.389
 build up 

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:28.620
 a very very good old one 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.080
 both teams both teams 

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:32.910
 played to win 

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:33.960
 In the attempt gates to shoot pressure 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:36.600
 to make pressure 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.280
 maybe we had a little bit 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:41.040
 Slice luck in front of the goal will be some 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:43.050
 abpralle deflected discs but the 

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:44.700
 we are not in our favor 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:46.200
 we played very strong from the beginning 

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.220
 We said we were among the top four 

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:49.200
 want us to play upstairs 

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:50.540
 the have the most sophisticated that has the good 

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:52.530
 worked the first two games on 

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:54.540
 sunday nuremberg is a top team 

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:56.460
 After that all teams have seen once 

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:58.470
 and then you count on every three 

00:05:56.460 --> 00:06:00.930
 and every game starts from scratch 

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:02.160
 and will see how they get up 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:03.510
 knife cutting some players were the 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.900
 We won and so it will be 

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:05.900
 be in future
