may have old rubik brand cubes or cubes
that<00:00:37.350> just<00:00:37.530> aren't<00:00:37.739> as<00:00:37.860> fast<00:00:38.100> as<00:00:38.309> your<00:00:38.460> main

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
that just aren't as fast as your main

DIY now I'm wait here we have a 25th

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.720 
DIY now I'm wait here we have a 25th
anniversary<00:00:42.090> cube<00:00:42.329> and<00:00:42.510> we<00:00:42.570> have<00:00:42.690> an<00:00:42.809> alpha<00:00:43.050> 5

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:43.730 
anniversary cube and we have an alpha 5

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:45.740 
anniversary cube and we have an alpha 5
the<00:00:44.730> noticeable<00:00:45.149> difference<00:00:45.510> between<00:00:45.690> the

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
the noticeable difference between the

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.660 
the noticeable difference between the
two<00:00:45.870> right<00:00:46.050> now<00:00:46.200> is<00:00:46.379> well<00:00:47.070> first<00:00:47.309> this<00:00:47.550> has

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
two right now is well first this has

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.970 
two right now is well first this has
smooth<00:00:48.539> tiles<00:00:48.809> on<00:00:48.960> it<00:00:49.050> and<00:00:49.140> this<00:00:49.200> one<00:00:49.350> has<00:00:49.440> just

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
smooth tiles on it and this one has just

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.220 
smooth tiles on it and this one has just
regular<00:00:50.250> stickers<00:00:50.520> but<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.239> wait<00:00:51.420> there's<00:00:52.110> a

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
regular stickers but the wait there's a

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.010 
regular stickers but the wait there's a
huge<00:00:52.620> weight<00:00:52.829> difference<00:00:53.190> here<00:00:53.600> now<00:00:54.600> what

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
huge weight difference here now what

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.110 
huge weight difference here now what
we've<00:00:55.170> come<00:00:55.350> up<00:00:55.379> with<00:00:55.500> is<00:00:55.829> an<00:00:56.640> interesting<00:00:56.879> way

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
we've come up with is an interesting way

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.119 
we've come up with is an interesting way
to<00:00:57.149> warm<00:00:57.390> up<00:00:57.539> is<00:00:57.719> in<00:00:58.410> preparing<00:00:58.800> for<00:00:59.010> something

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
to warm up is in preparing for something

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.500 
to warm up is in preparing for something
that's<00:00:59.399> really<00:00:59.550> loosened<00:00:59.969> fast<00:01:00.210> warm

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
that's really loosened fast warm

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.599 
that's really loosened fast warm
yourself<00:01:00.750> up<00:01:00.840> for<00:01:00.899> it<00:01:01.109> do<00:01:01.710> solves<00:01:02.250> on<00:01:02.370> a<00:01:02.399> slow

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
yourself up for it do solves on a slow

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.189 
yourself up for it do solves on a slow
cube<00:01:02.850> so<00:01:03.329> we're<00:01:03.510> going<00:01:03.600> to<00:01:03.690> try<00:01:03.780> that<00:01:03.989> for<00:01:04.140> a

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
cube so we're going to try that for a

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.080 
cube so we're going to try that for a
bit<00:01:04.350> I'm<00:01:05.040> not<00:01:05.189> that<00:01:05.400> warmed<00:01:05.640> up<00:01:05.729> I<00:01:05.820> just<00:01:05.970> came

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
bit I'm not that warmed up I just came

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.730 
bit I'm not that warmed up I just came
from<00:01:06.119> my<00:01:06.299> room<00:01:06.510> over<00:01:06.900> here<00:01:06.930> to<00:01:07.140> film<00:01:07.350> this<00:01:07.500> i'm

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
from my room over here to film this i'm

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.609 
from my room over here to film this i'm
in<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:07.920> library<00:01:08.150> um<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.450> we're<00:01:10.380> gonna<00:01:10.530> do

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
in the library um and we're gonna do

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:11.600 
in the library um and we're gonna do
some<00:01:10.650> Sol's<00:01:10.920> on<00:01:11.040> this<00:01:11.159> and<00:01:11.340> then<00:01:11.460> we're<00:01:11.549> gonna

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
some Sol's on this and then we're gonna

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.399 
some Sol's on this and then we're gonna
try<00:01:11.790> some<00:01:11.939> solving<00:01:12.210> this<00:01:12.299> and<00:01:12.540> see<00:01:12.930> what<00:01:13.290> it's

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
try some solving this and see what it's

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:14.420 
try some solving this and see what it's
like<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:13.710> see<00:01:13.830> if<00:01:13.890> there's<00:01:14.070> an<00:01:14.159> improvement

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
like and see if there's an improvement

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.300 
like and see if there's an improvement
let's<00:01:15.390> say<00:01:15.570> to<00:01:15.630> salt<00:01:16.020> three<00:01:16.350> cells<00:01:16.530> here<00:01:16.710> to

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
let's say to salt three cells here to

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.160 
let's say to salt three cells here to
salt<00:01:17.520> here<00:01:17.670> yeah<00:01:18.360> so<00:01:18.570> like<00:01:18.689> a<00:01:18.750> little<00:01:18.990> average

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
salt here yeah so like a little average

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.230 
salt here yeah so like a little average
of<00:01:19.259> five<00:01:19.350> 32<00:01:20.210> I've<00:01:21.210> I<00:01:21.390> I<00:01:21.420> timer<00:01:21.750> open<00:01:22.140> QQ<00:01:22.530> timer

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
of five 32 I've I I timer open QQ timer

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.520 
of five 32 I've I I timer open QQ timer
whatever<00:01:24.240> I<00:01:24.479> don't<00:01:24.869> have<00:01:24.960> a<00:01:24.990> stack<00:01:25.200> them<00:01:25.350> at<00:01:25.409> my

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
whatever I don't have a stack them at my

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.469 
whatever I don't have a stack them at my
site<00:01:25.710> lets<00:01:25.890> out<00:01:25.979> of<00:01:26.070> batteries<00:01:26.369> I<00:01:26.580> have<00:01:27.390> not

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
site lets out of batteries I have not

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.270 
site lets out of batteries I have not
used<00:01:27.630> to<00:01:27.720> stack<00:01:27.900> met<00:01:28.110> in<00:01:28.200> very<00:01:28.860> long<00:01:29.040> time

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
used to stack met in very long time

00:01:29.280 --> 00:02:05.639 
used to stack met in very long time
actually<00:01:30.110> so<00:01:31.110> yeah<00:01:31.590> let's<00:01:31.770> just<00:01:31.829> try<00:01:32.460> some

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:05.649 

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:31.470 

that<00:02:06.649> was<00:02:06.799> a<00:02:06.829> 2033<00:02:08.619> goodness<00:02:29.890> that's<00:02:30.890> 3001

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
that was a 2033 goodness that's 3001

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.449 
that was a 2033 goodness that's 3001
okay<00:02:32.480> so<00:02:32.540> we<00:02:32.900> did<00:02:33.049> these<00:02:33.200> really<00:02:34.099> slow

00:02:34.449 --> 00:02:34.459 
okay so we did these really slow

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:37.059 
okay so we did these really slow
sluggish<00:02:35.110> poor<00:02:36.110> souls<00:02:36.440> with<00:02:36.680> this<00:02:36.799> really

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:37.069 
sluggish poor souls with this really

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:39.880 
sluggish poor souls with this really
heavy<00:02:37.280> cube<00:02:38.090> that<00:02:38.299> um<00:02:38.480> was<00:02:39.019> it<00:02:39.049> one<00:02:39.349> time<00:02:39.590> good

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
heavy cube that um was it one time good

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.979 
heavy cube that um was it one time good
but<00:02:40.190> is<00:02:40.340> now<00:02:40.640> a<00:02:40.670> little<00:02:41.030> it<00:02:41.420> locks<00:02:41.599> up<00:02:41.720> a<00:02:41.780> little

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
but is now a little it locks up a little

00:02:41.989 --> 00:03:13.390 
but is now a little it locks up a little
bit<00:02:42.079> too<00:02:42.170> much<00:02:42.579> now<00:02:43.579> I'll<00:03:11.470> 560<00:03:12.470> 95<00:03:12.859> you<00:03:13.310> know

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
bit too much now I'll 560 95 you know

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.789 
bit too much now I'll 560 95 you know
it's<00:03:13.549> good<00:03:14.180> time<00:03:14.389> to<00:03:14.510> start<00:03:14.690> with<00:03:14.870> so<00:03:15.650> there's

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:15.799 
it's good time to start with so there's

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:16.930 
it's good time to start with so there's
a<00:03:15.829> lot<00:03:15.950> of<00:03:16.010> things<00:03:16.130> that<00:03:16.310> go<00:03:16.400> into<00:03:16.579> that<00:03:16.700> um

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:16.940 
a lot of things that go into that um

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.699 
a lot of things that go into that um
amount<00:03:17.750> of<00:03:17.810> shape<00:03:17.989> I<00:03:18.079> didn't<00:03:18.260> warm<00:03:18.380> up<00:03:18.440> as<00:03:18.590> much

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
amount of shape I didn't warm up as much

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:21.190 
amount of shape I didn't warm up as much
as<00:03:18.829> I<00:03:18.889> could<00:03:19.160> but<00:03:19.819> that<00:03:20.239> meat<00:03:20.480> transition<00:03:21.049> into

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
as I could but that meat transition into

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.449 
as I could but that meat transition into
something<00:03:21.560> from<00:03:21.709> that's<00:03:21.859> really<00:03:22.130> heavy<00:03:22.280> too

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
something from that's really heavy too

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:23.470 
something from that's really heavy too
sometimes<00:03:22.819> really<00:03:23.000> like<00:03:23.150> is<00:03:23.359> really

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
sometimes really like is really

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.440 
sometimes really like is really
refreshing<00:03:23.720> and<00:03:24.260> it's<00:03:24.410> actually<00:03:24.530> um<00:03:25.329> really<00:03:26.329> I

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
refreshing and it's actually um really I

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.539 
refreshing and it's actually um really I
could<00:03:26.680> kind<00:03:27.680> of<00:03:27.769> feel<00:03:28.010> some<00:03:28.310> sort<00:03:28.430> of

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:28.549 
could kind of feel some sort of

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:33.970 
could kind of feel some sort of
different<00:03:28.810> start<00:03:29.810> to<00:03:30.200> my<00:03:30.319> solve<00:03:31.810> 16<00:03:32.810> is<00:03:33.109> about

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
different start to my solve 16 is about

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.740 
different start to my solve 16 is about
average<00:03:34.130> Oh<00:03:34.519> around<00:03:35.180> average<00:03:35.359> for<00:03:35.569> me<00:03:35.630> these

there<00:03:58.730> are<00:03:58.819> very<00:03:59.000> cubic<00:03:59.390> events<00:03:59.690> it's<00:03:59.810> we<00:03:59.930> have

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:00.049 
there are very cubic events it's we have

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:01.630 
there are very cubic events it's we have
been<00:04:00.140> practicing<00:04:00.260> for<00:04:00.739> my<00:04:01.040> for<00:04:01.280> a<00:04:01.310> whole<00:04:01.489> lot

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640 
been practicing for my for a whole lot

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.520 
been practicing for my for a whole lot
and<00:04:01.849> there<00:04:02.540> wasn't<00:04:02.659> forward<00:04:02.930> but<00:04:03.200> that's<00:04:03.319> okay

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530

and there wasn't forward but that's okay
this<00:04:04.400> channel<00:04:04.640> has<00:04:04.700> been<00:04:04.849> basically<00:04:05.030> um

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739 
this channel has been basically um

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:08.580 
this channel has been basically um
what's<00:04:06.739> a<00:04:06.799> fancy<00:04:07.099> way<00:04:07.190> of<00:04:07.220> saying<00:04:07.459> dead
