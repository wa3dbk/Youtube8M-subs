00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:08.290 
and there's old wires out wires mean you

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:09.540 
and there's old wires out wires mean you
can<00:01:08.440> connect<00:01:08.710> directly<00:01:08.800> to<00:01:09.040> the<00:01:09.250> main<00:01:09.400> wall

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:09.550 
can connect directly to the main wall

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:11.730 
can connect directly to the main wall
any<00:01:09.760> control<00:01:10.120> the<00:01:10.270> voltage<00:01:10.390> on<00:01:10.750> it<00:01:10.780> one

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
any control the voltage on it one

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.499 
any control the voltage on it one
important<00:01:12.189> thing<00:01:12.220> and<00:01:12.520> that<00:01:12.670> we<00:01:12.880> can<00:01:13.060> see<00:01:13.329> that

00:01:13.499 --> 00:01:13.509 
important thing and that we can see that

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:15.389 
important thing and that we can see that
there<00:01:13.869> is<00:01:13.990> like<00:01:14.229> some<00:01:14.409> extreme<00:01:14.740> overclockers

00:01:15.389 --> 00:01:15.399 
there is like some extreme overclockers

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:17.520 
there is like some extreme overclockers
working<00:01:15.820> on<00:01:15.880> that<00:01:16.060> board<00:01:16.329> you<00:01:16.960> they<00:01:17.350> have

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
working on that board you they have

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.010 
working on that board you they have
sweep<00:01:18.340> throw<00:01:18.579> temp<00:01:18.970> probe<00:01:19.270> connectors<00:01:19.810> on<00:01:19.930> it

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020 
sweep throw temp probe connectors on it

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.020 
sweep throw temp probe connectors on it
so<00:01:20.200> you<00:01:20.290> can<00:01:20.320> directly<00:01:20.829> connect<00:01:21.250> your<00:01:21.490> temp

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
so you can directly connect your temp

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.450 
so you can directly connect your temp
probe<00:01:22.270> on<00:01:22.509> your<00:01:23.079> your<00:01:23.560> main<00:01:23.740> board<00:01:23.950> it's<00:01:24.340> an

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
probe on your your main board it's an

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.450 
probe on your your main board it's an
event<00:01:24.700> that<00:01:24.880> on<00:01:25.240> on<00:01:25.600> your<00:01:25.840> thermo<00:01:26.380> meter<00:01:26.619> on

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
event that on on your thermo meter on

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.910 
event that on on your thermo meter on
about<00:01:27.759> so<00:01:28.750> yeah<00:01:29.320> that's<00:01:29.500> pretty<00:01:29.530> much<00:01:29.740> about

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:29.920 
about so yeah that's pretty much about

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.670 
about so yeah that's pretty much about
the<00:01:30.189> important<00:01:30.820> thing<00:01:31.000> about<00:01:31.090> that<00:01:31.240> ball<00:01:31.680> this

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:32.680 
the important thing about that ball this

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.440 
the important thing about that ball this
is<00:01:32.890> some<00:01:33.189> other<00:01:33.340> features<00:01:33.729> like<00:01:33.939> you<00:01:34.090> have<00:01:34.210> the

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
is some other features like you have the

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.740 
is some other features like you have the

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
yeah that's definitely the main board I

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.100 
yeah that's definitely the main board I
don't<00:01:50.560> know<00:01:50.619> yet<00:01:50.799> when<00:01:51.210> we<00:01:52.210> launch<00:01:52.810> we<00:01:53.079> will

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
don't know yet when we launch we will

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.740 
don't know yet when we launch we will
see<00:01:53.320> once<00:01:53.500> when<00:01:53.829> is<00:01:53.890> gonna<00:01:54.070> be<00:01:54.189> and<00:01:54.640> yeah<00:01:55.509> this
