00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.490
 how do you analyze the 

00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:04.020
 hot counter performance of timoko 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.509
 today I find the point 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:10.080
 poor performance I have managers who 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:12.269
 rolled he rolled is good I 'm fine 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.910
 see how to avoid shocks 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.850
 today good 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:20.119
 first kilometer 7 after good cause 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:23.750
 a little by child niqab sail be the 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:25.400
 world against horses against the 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:26.930
 things like that scout to finish 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:31.220
 like that I think if you will find me again 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:32.840
 hide after months after classes them I 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:35.300
 think as he can run in time to 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.730
 raw 1000 meters 7 and 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.680
 thousands of others like this before I 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.870
 think he's not that bad so that's actually 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:42.980
 you told him to do as low 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:44.780
 when I tell you it looks to be 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.920
 very offensive what do you think that 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.660
 your horse is still able to do 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.610
 that today 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:52.450
 Well, I thought before precisely I want 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.450
 see this and 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.770
 it was today to do because if 

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:59.250
 we make the next side april is true 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:02.920
 that it's too late is good now 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.790
 me I think I thought me candy thing 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.830
 to see today 

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.530
 good result we can not do it good 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.790
 we can not do it 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.560
 I had everything I trust I am 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.960
 there never led how like I do 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.370
 me an offensive era like that I 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.900
 even asked that I did not believe 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:21.350
 happy because he returned immediately 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:25.640
 of the track and mother I do not understand 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:27.790
 but after we see the clear things 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.710
 now and then you see the others 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.540
 they are faster to finish good 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.180
 can not you can not the heads or the 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:38.020
 authors finished that's it 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:40.400
 army something involved precisely 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.509
 would I still be his pilot 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.240
 the day is what it puts back 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:48.440
 thing in cause precisely a name a 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:49.910
 for me joe slovo bailly out of the 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.940
 track is common to done there today 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:55.250
 it's not happy if he's angry 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.500
 me who gives the order unrolled and can 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:01.400
 to be angry at me dad the choices the 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:04.130
 choice be the units nothing is good I 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:05.750
 think he did not deserve that after after 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.680
 for no god if he will stay or what 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.680
 no problem
