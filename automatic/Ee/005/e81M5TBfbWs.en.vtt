00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
this was probably my favorite match of

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.160 
this was probably my favorite match of
all<00:01:41.520> time<00:01:41.790> I've<00:01:42.240> never<00:01:42.390> been<00:01:42.659> in<00:01:42.780> a<00:01:42.810> wrestling

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
all time I've never been in a wrestling

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.039 
all time I've never been in a wrestling
show<00:01:43.290> orange<00:01:43.799> standing<00:01:44.340> there<00:01:44.460> like<00:01:45.049> then

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
show orange standing there like then

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:47.810 
show orange standing there like then
that's<00:01:46.649> why<00:01:46.799> I<00:01:46.829> get<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.130> shirt<00:01:47.310> actually<00:01:47.790> I

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
that's why I get the shirt actually I

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.249 
that's why I get the shirt actually I
thought<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.119> shirt<00:01:48.329> look<00:01:48.540> pretty<00:01:48.720> stupid<00:01:48.990> I

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
thought the shirt look pretty stupid I

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.569 
thought the shirt look pretty stupid I
think<00:01:49.409> both<00:01:49.530> are<00:01:49.649> pretty<00:01:49.860> stupid<00:01:50.369> and<00:01:50.490> they'll

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
think both are pretty stupid and they'll

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:51.889 
think both are pretty stupid and they'll
probably<00:01:50.790> never<00:01:50.939> really<00:01:51.299> where'd<00:01:51.509> that<00:01:51.689> much

00:01:51.889 --> 00:01:51.899 
probably never really where'd that much

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:54.260 
probably never really where'd that much
but<00:01:52.140> I<00:01:52.409> match<00:01:53.189> was<00:01:53.460> just<00:01:53.610> like<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:53.850> best<00:01:54.030> ever

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
but I match was just like the best ever
