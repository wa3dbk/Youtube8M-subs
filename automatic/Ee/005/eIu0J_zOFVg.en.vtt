00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.420

 I meet again by chance 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.880
 made who gets that as 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.990
 other helpers spend too much and too much 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.659
 what do you actually have to do again 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.729
 a small little thing and indeed 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:31.830
 many of you know the tradition 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:34.979
 Nicholas in the evening on 5 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:36.780
 you imagine his shoes cleaned 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.840
 the door and the next morning has the 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.670
 nicholas inserted a latching 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.049
 because actually everyone has you sooner 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.420
 as a child I always did 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:47.189
 i still do my parents 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.020
 or so is just tradition and me 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:50.790
 I want to keep it up a bit 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.409
 leave and what is your task at 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:56.580
 to participate in the contest for one 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:58.979
 the 5,6 he puts your shoes 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.110
 somewhere so the beautiful the pictures 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.939
 the better and maybe that makes 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.960
 the little community video out so 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.580
 always if here at this 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.830
 gamble on individual counts 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.810
 So that he wants the world 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.860
 my public is shown 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.940
 really happy 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.560
 I am always happy about everyone 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.060
 Send in if someone tries hard 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.040
 Of course he wants to do that 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:17.720
 So I would like to have a picture of yours 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.990
 school there must be at least one magic 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.430
 his card in there in the ever heard one 

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:24.020
 usually not at home so has 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.490
 a bit too when must be I think 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:27.200
 It can be done quickly 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:30.550
 no great photo is just enough 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:33.230
 Handyfoto I think in our current 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.800
 The age of technology should do that 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.840
 his 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.280
 away from Kommander I think it's up 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.140
 every case a fair thing so once 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.880
 the shoes with at least one magic 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.750
 the larger headphones this is 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:43.850
 the more I am, of course, happy 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.700
 Of course, no requirement 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:48.530
 no better chances than the other one 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.570
 because everything is going to start again 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.060
 ultimately over all under all 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:54.950
 correct one endings then made the 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.990
 Will then send me my match 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.660
 chipcount but sure everything is again 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:01.340
 on the slides we do it the best 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.959
 and I think that's definitely 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.730
 easy to do I give a few 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:06.410
 technical tips just because maybe 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.330
 one or the other then not so 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.820
 a lot I think that should actually 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.140
 everything is running and yes I hope you guys 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.640
 that has it, however, can the 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.440
 have celebrated natural to nikolaus 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.820
 extra chic for you what i did 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.600
 but you probably noticed that 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:22.760
 not but I hope you bode on it and 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:24.019
 he says this advent calendar door 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.180

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:27.560

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:30.310
