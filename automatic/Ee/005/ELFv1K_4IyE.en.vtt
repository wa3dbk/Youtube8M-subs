00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 Well we greet everyone in cx 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.279
 kaisen I hope you are well and 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.080
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.069
 new video on gta 5 online 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:09.300
 playstation 4 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.370
 in this video I introduced you to the 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.870
 official spawn of the canis but that's the 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.400
 vehicle mercenaries home mary 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.400
 water on its parts 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.590
 so already to start you go 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:27.939
 have to go to the same place as 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.380
 me at the back of the track 

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:31.810
 landing of the fort ah koon high 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.129
 level of a beach between 21h and 23h 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:34.780
 so obviously there was another 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:36.790
 way of having this vehicle by calling 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.650
 simply mayor water but this 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.879
 was going to cost you a little over $ 4,500 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.440
 so this method remains the most 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:42.760
 profitable because it is free 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.350
 so really makes you do it 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.239
 especially that even for the players who 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.920
 begin gta5 that do not necessarily have the 

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:49.870
 can call city ​​water for 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.300
 the moment really see a vehicle well 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.260
 friendly for free so as I 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.789
 you said you're going to have to 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.199
 go to the beach and once on the 

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:56.680
 beach you're going to have to eliminate all 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:58.300
 enemies 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.320
 once the gang tacc is over 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.329
 you will be able to take the vehicle 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.769
 and not before if you are not finished 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:04.239
 bank robberies you can not 

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:06.340
 leave with the vehicle because it will be everything 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.450
 simply locked so it has to be 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.830
 the girls and attack him two english 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.450
 you have the vehicle you can 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.740
 return to your apartment a message 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:12.940
 will appear as what you do not 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:13.270
 can not put the vehicle in your 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.770
 garage 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.050
 so you just have to search 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.070
 any blue rank of activities 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.450
 which is on map two 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.159
 possibilities closest to your 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.539
 garage you need the window where you 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:23.830
 go put your vehicle to 

00:01:22.539 --> 00:01:25.780
 inside during blues so 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.770
 that both wheels be inside you 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.970
 go down once you go 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.020
 go down the business will launch 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.250
 automatically 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.569
 so once you're in the 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:33.489
 menu you're going to wait a few 

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:35.110
 seconds then you're going to leave it takes 

00:01:33.489 --> 00:01:37.030
 you will leave the activity on 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.739
 vehicle will end up not far from you 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.750
 so either he'll be right in front of the place 

00:01:38.739 --> 00:01:42.069
 where you started the activity be it 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.179
 will find a little further down the road 

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:45.190
 so then you can recover 

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:46.569
 your vehicle and bring it back into your 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.800
 garage and you can of course 

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:48.880
 customize it 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.229
 unfortunately there is not much 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.879
 choice in terms of customization 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:53.200
 for this vehicle millas mill to do 

00:01:51.879 --> 00:01:54.340
 really a very nice vehicle 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.899
 especially at the color level 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.039
 if you want to use a color 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:58.649
 will really devote myself to getting a 

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:00.610
 Vehicle mode is very nice 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:02.229
