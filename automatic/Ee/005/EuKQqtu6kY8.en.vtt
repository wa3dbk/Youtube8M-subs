00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:06.660
 to myself 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.260
 I would like to check today 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.219
 nourishing hand mask 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.920
 enters 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.719
 honey one teaspoon olive oil 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.289
 one teaspoon 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:22.140
 chicken yolk 1 thing and juice 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:25.859
 fresh lemon one teaspoon 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.410
 this mask should brighten a little skin 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:33.210
 hands due to the fact that the composition includes lemon 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:36.809
 If you are dealt a tanning since come to 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:39.450
 the beach from the sea and do not want your tan 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.670
 so the lemon was torn off you in this mask not 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.920
 add 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:46.829
 yolk smooth fine lines and 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.980
 olive oil and honey soak well 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:53.010
 skin will dry dry small cracks 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:57.739
 so now we will apply this mask and 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:01:01.949
 let's see try to put it on the pens 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:05.300
 then we wear polyethylene gloves and 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.300
 15 minutes of entry 

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:13.190
 hand masks desirable to do at night 

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:16.650
 when you have done all the housework 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:19.780
 you will not accept van damm 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:21.580
 make more contact with water 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.780
 [music] 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:26.240
 It is recommended to make masks for hands 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:29.240
 somewhere once a week if the skin is very 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.360
 dry you first need to do 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.360
 scrub 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.210
 all waiting 15 minutes 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.250
 [music] 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:41.979
 Well I am very washed masochku 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:45.060
 the pens are very gentle very 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:47.380
 smooth skin turned a little faded 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.830
 redness meaning mask good she 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:53.350
 really nourishes the skin very well 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:55.659
 here you can even basically do not lubricate 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.509
 skin nourishing cream because here 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:01.860
 anyway olive oil is absorbed 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:03.040
 and the skin is very tender therefore I advise you 

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.869
