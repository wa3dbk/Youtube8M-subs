the<00:00:37.620> first<00:00:37.920> and<00:00:38.160> most<00:00:38.370> obvious<00:00:38.579> question<00:00:39.360> is

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
the first and most obvious question is

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.869 
the first and most obvious question is
why<00:00:40.170> choose<00:00:40.469> a<00:00:40.500> silhouette<00:00:40.980> decoy<00:00:41.340> from<00:00:41.730> real

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
why choose a silhouette decoy from real

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.660 
why choose a silhouette decoy from real
geese<00:00:42.149> being<00:00:43.140> a<00:00:43.200> silhouette<00:00:43.620> decoy<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.340> not<00:00:44.640> a

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
geese being a silhouette decoy and not a

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.180 
geese being a silhouette decoy and not a
full<00:00:44.910> body<00:00:45.120> it<00:00:45.270> takes<00:00:45.480> up<00:00:45.629> very<00:00:45.660> little<00:00:45.870> space

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:46.190 
full body it takes up very little space

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.670 
full body it takes up very little space
so<00:00:47.190> storage<00:00:47.879> is<00:00:48.090> it<00:00:48.270> is<00:00:48.690> when<00:00:49.410> you're<00:00:49.530> not

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
so storage is it is when you're not

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.369 
so storage is it is when you're not
hunting<00:00:50.059> when<00:00:51.059> you're<00:00:51.180> going<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.899> field<00:00:52.110> I

hunting when you're going to the field I

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.680 
hunting when you're going to the field I
mean<00:00:52.770> you<00:00:52.860> need<00:00:52.980> a<00:00:53.039> pickup<00:00:53.399> truck<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:53.699> or<00:00:54.090> a

mean you need a pickup truck and or a

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.029 
mean you need a pickup truck and or a
hatchback<00:00:55.559> instead<00:00:56.430> of<00:00:56.610> a<00:00:56.879> big<00:00:57.180> trailer<00:00:57.480> and
