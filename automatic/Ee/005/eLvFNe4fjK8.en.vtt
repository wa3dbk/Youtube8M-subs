first<00:00:45.390> batch<00:00:46.260> of<00:00:46.290> 10<00:00:46.739> and<00:00:47.040> we're<00:00:47.550> using<00:00:47.670> a

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
first batch of 10 and we're using a

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.150 
first batch of 10 and we're using a
slower<00:00:48.120> tempo<00:00:48.390> four<00:00:48.780> seconds<00:00:49.200> down<00:00:49.350> no<00:00:49.890> pause

two<00:00:50.550> seconds<00:00:50.940> right<00:00:51.090> back<00:00:51.300> up<00:00:51.570> and<00:00:51.829> lots<00:00:52.829> of

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
two seconds right back up and lots of

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.620 
two seconds right back up and lots of
tension<00:00:53.280> on<00:00:53.579> the<00:00:53.700> mall<00:00:53.850> so<00:00:54.030> we're<00:00:54.210> really

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:54.630 
tension on the mall so we're really

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:56.270 
tension on the mall so we're really
really<00:00:55.230> going<00:00:55.470> to<00:00:55.590> train<00:00:55.829> that<00:00:55.860> I'm<00:00:56.160> also

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
really going to train that I'm also

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.430 
really going to train that I'm also
through<00:00:56.579> that<00:00:56.730> same<00:00:57.630> range<00:00:57.899> of<00:00:58.020> motion<00:00:58.350> a

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
through that same range of motion a

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.710 
through that same range of motion a
force<00:00:58.739> neurological<00:00:59.489> growth<00:00:59.700> and<00:01:00.030> it's<00:01:00.600> your

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:00.720 
force neurological growth and it's your

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.510 
force neurological growth and it's your
really<00:01:01.020> efficient<00:01:01.530> up<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.800> exercise<00:01:02.280> more

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
really efficient up the exercise more

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.879 
really efficient up the exercise more
efficient<00:01:03.059> you<00:01:03.180> are<00:01:03.210> at<00:01:03.450> these<00:01:03.600> exercises<00:01:04.110> the

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:04.889 
efficient you are at these exercises the

00:01:04.889 --> 00:01:06.679 
efficient you are at these exercises the
more<00:01:05.129> you'll<00:01:05.309> be<00:01:05.460> able<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:05.700> lift<00:01:05.850> later<00:01:06.090> on<00:01:06.389> so

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
more you'll be able to lift later on so

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.899 
more you'll be able to lift later on so
I<00:01:06.719> when<00:01:07.200> we<00:01:07.289> go<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:07.469> some<00:01:07.740> lower<00:01:08.310> rep<00:01:08.549> ranges

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
I when we go to some lower rep ranges

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.620 
I when we go to some lower rep ranges
okay<00:01:09.719> so<00:01:10.729> like<00:01:11.729> I<00:01:11.850> said<00:01:11.909> in<00:01:12.179> the<00:01:12.240> last<00:01:12.359> two

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
okay so like I said in the last two

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.620 
okay so like I said in the last two
videos<00:01:12.780> in<00:01:13.259> theory<00:01:13.740> 10<00:01:13.979> by<00:01:14.130> 10<00:01:14.460> would<00:01:15.149> be<00:01:15.299> way

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
videos in theory 10 by 10 would be way

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.199 
videos in theory 10 by 10 would be way
too<00:01:15.689> easy<00:01:15.929> because<00:01:16.679> you<00:01:16.829> would<00:01:17.009> be<00:01:17.209> completing

00:01:18.199 --> 00:01:18.209 
too easy because you would be completing

00:01:18.209 --> 00:01:20.239 
too easy because you would be completing
the<00:01:18.299> workouts<00:01:18.719> with<00:01:18.990> two<00:01:19.170> light<00:01:19.409> of<00:01:19.619> waves<00:01:19.889> so

00:01:20.239 --> 00:01:20.249 
the workouts with two light of waves so

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:21.770 
the workouts with two light of waves so
what<00:01:20.819> we're<00:01:20.969> doing<00:01:20.999> is<00:01:21.209> we're<00:01:21.359> picking<00:01:21.659> on

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
what we're doing is we're picking on

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.120 
what we're doing is we're picking on
record<00:01:22.170> right<00:01:22.200> we're<00:01:22.469> picking<00:01:22.799> a<00:01:22.889> wave

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
record right we're picking a wave

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.449 
record right we're picking a wave
selection<00:01:23.850> that<00:01:23.999> is<00:01:24.149> to<00:01:24.240> do<00:01:24.389> around<00:01:24.479> 20<00:01:24.959> times

00:01:25.449 --> 00:01:25.459 
selection that is to do around 20 times

00:01:25.459 --> 00:01:28.879 
selection that is to do around 20 times
and<00:01:26.459> you'll<00:01:26.729> probably<00:01:26.999> be<00:01:27.270> able<00:01:27.299> to<00:01:27.539> do<00:01:28.289> the<00:01:28.469> 10

00:01:28.879 --> 00:01:28.889 
and you'll probably be able to do the 10

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:31.279 
and you'll probably be able to do the 10
reps<00:01:29.189> for<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.609> first<00:01:29.819> five<00:01:30.149> or<00:01:30.179> six<00:01:30.509> s<00:01:30.719> it's

00:01:31.279 --> 00:01:31.289 
reps for the first five or six s it's

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:33.319 
reps for the first five or six s it's
the<00:01:31.469> last<00:01:31.679> couple<00:01:32.159> sex<00:01:32.639> you're<00:01:32.909> really<00:01:33.209> going

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329
