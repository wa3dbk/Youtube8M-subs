00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.770
 but jean le cam said it before his 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.339
 capsize arrival at cap horn is already 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:07.620
 a feat 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.630
 the past with a fragile sailboat is 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.820
 very random even with two skippers 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.009
 of the quench of rio the cam perbet has 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.599
 dismasted that night taken in tow by 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.160
 a ship from the Chilean Navy the 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.690
 boat is now docked at the port 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.640
 military of puerto williams en 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.320
 Patagonia is a very end of the race 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:36.210
 difficult to live for the 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:38.550
 as a big laugh at the carpet at the cape 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.290
 horn and in front of two fish 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.850
 to saint helene roland daydain east 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.750
 always looking for the grail a problem 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:58.890
 before the grail 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:01:01.620
 there are jewels referee of this duel a 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.000
 1800 km wide low front gate 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.830
 who block the road to the two skippers 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.930
 it will have to work the head 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.549
 and legs in a nutshell it's going to reel 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.020
 duroux himmich but also in 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:17.759
 caboches people are really 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:20.130
 equitably distributed veolia this is 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.500
 rather to do the gunner by minimizing 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.689
 the duration of exposure to the anticyclone 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.369
 whereas the logic foncia is rather 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.009
 to keep for as long as possible 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.990
 and to make the crossing last 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.820
 moment then we have two logical 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.680
 different for a very vague system 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.280
 that can lead to rediff 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.079
 the show redistributes the cards certainly 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:45.259
 but the game is in the hands of 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:47.880
 hooves quÃ©villon through the 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:51.340
 revision 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.570
 it's okay it's not too bad I had bad 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:58.479
 remember people who want to be holy 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:59.740
 Helene eight years ago as one of 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:02.320
 jewels to the center of the Atlantic 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:03.850
 south a pile or rather north that will 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.250
 the first to the equator do your games 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.869
 and a little patience the chess game 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:10.080
 risk of lasting a good ten 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:10.080
 days
