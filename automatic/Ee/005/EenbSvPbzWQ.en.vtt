flight down here was pretty long so just

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:41.770 
flight down here was pretty long so just
kind<00:01:40.340> of<00:01:40.400> managing<00:01:40.880> just<00:01:41.299> trying<00:01:41.509> to<00:01:41.600> figure

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
kind of managing just trying to figure

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.539 
kind of managing just trying to figure
everything<00:01:41.990> out<00:01:42.409> but<00:01:42.950> we<00:01:43.040> did<00:01:43.220> come<00:01:43.369> in<00:01:43.490> a

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549 
everything out but we did come in a

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:44.710 
everything out but we did come in a
little<00:01:43.670> bit<00:01:43.820> dry<00:01:44.000> i<00:01:44.030> would<00:01:44.360> say<00:01:44.450> maybe<00:01:44.600> about

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
little bit dry i would say maybe about

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.870 
little bit dry i would say maybe about
three<00:01:45.049> pounds<00:01:45.200> drive<00:01:45.619> from<00:01:45.950> from<00:01:46.369> the<00:01:46.460> europa

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
three pounds drive from from the europa

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.330 
three pounds drive from from the europa
we<00:01:47.060> rated<00:01:47.240> about<00:01:47.540> 208<00:01:47.869> europa<00:01:48.830> lose<00:01:48.979> about<00:01:49.130> to

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:49.340 
we rated about 208 europa lose about to

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:51.609 
we rated about 208 europa lose about to
11<00:01:49.790> so<00:01:50.360> the<00:01:50.509> idea<00:01:50.630> is<00:01:50.869> just<00:01:51.110> to<00:01:51.200> tighten<00:01:51.470> down

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
11 so the idea is just to tighten down

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:53.679 
11 so the idea is just to tighten down
maintain<00:01:52.430> good<00:01:52.610> conditioning<00:01:53.210> and<00:01:53.390> just<00:01:53.420> show

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:53.689 
maintain good conditioning and just show

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:55.840
