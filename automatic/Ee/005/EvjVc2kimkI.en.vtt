00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:06.330
 hi guys welcome to the second and 

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:08.370
 last part of how is the level of 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.380
 power of bills the god of destruction 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:14.150
 let's go for points of 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.150
 transformations of the characters 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:21.360
 the state of goku in phase 3 is 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.509
 a little high approximately in this 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.849
 figure because because after the 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:29.820
 Bu's fight kept training but from 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.800
 Anyway it raised slightly its power not 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.870
 I will mention their powers of state 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.860
 normal or super sayayin because they are 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:40.140
 unnecessary remember that the state 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.090
 base of bills is this but this power what 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.820
 can raise a bit like to do 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.890
 warm-ups or things like that I do not think 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.809
 bill that power has been used to beat 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.879
 to goku because we remember that goku 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.190
 he had a match with ma jin wook when 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.290
 absorbed exhausted c's and remember that 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.930
 Goku kept the fight with all his strength 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:00.410
 in this case goku was defeated with two 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.989
 simple blows 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:05.120
 in the case of vegueta his fighting power 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:08.150
 it rises a little but I mean in the 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.680
 state of super sayayin phase 2 due to 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.410
 that vegueta if he has maintained a 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.540
 Decent training as surprises of 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:17.000
 There was a lot of comment from the teacher 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.580
 roshi that for which vegueta exceeded 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.040
 powers of goku that happens when bills 

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.310
 hit burma until I realize 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:27.650
 the blows that he gave vegueta bills 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:30.350
 in bills theories gets mad when ma jin 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.330
 hooligan lack of respect or something like that 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.759
 fighting power exceeds that of any 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.920
 adversary so far we already know 

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:39.560
 perfectly that this level of power 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.350
 would overcome adversaries like yang mba ma 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.539
 jin wook on one and gilbert great we're not going 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.480
 to mention dragon ball characters gt 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:50.180
 because that's another story 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:52.190
 in a few words bills would increase more 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.070
 triple their power because of their 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:57.140
 eye emotions I'm not mentioning the 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.330
 true power of bills because that's 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.570
 will know when they fight against goku in mode 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.570
 God 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:10.100
 when vegueta gets angry his power of 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:12.080
 quarrel abruptly changes eye the power of 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.300
 vegueta fight does not compare to that of 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.530
 bills nothing else increased it in few 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.780
 seconds 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.310
 suddenly bills would be surprised with 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.400
 similar power that had elevated 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.470
 vegueta but after a while his fighting power 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.630
 decreases 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.060
 the power of goian by my point of view 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:31.070
 has decreased considerably in 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.900
 actually that happens because of not having a 

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:35.300
 due training and it's no longer 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.610
 considered a great mystic but a goya 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:40.040
 in common 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:42.470
 in the case of its transformation into super 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.630
 Sayayin is like waking up a part of 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.840
 his powers that varies along with his 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.700
 emotions besides in goya fights 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.190
 has shown greater power in fights 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.170
 if I had a fair training 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:58.240
 perhaps it would surpass the power of 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.240
 his father in state sayayin phase 3 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:13.599
 wants to become god mode decided 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.489
 gather the others sayayin is for 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:17.799
 gather all the amount of energy that 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:20.170
 you could do your fighting power it 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:21.909
 also rises but gold peak ensures 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.430
 that with that power he can not beat 

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:26.319
 bills that means that peak gold 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.750
 I could feel the true power of 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:31.950
 Coconut bills reaches a super level 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.950
 very superior saiyan 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:41.940
 when it reaches the power of the super saiyan 

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:44.670
 god his fighting power increases triple 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.650
 but when he fights with bills he ensures 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:48.900
 that he is not using all his power in 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:51.980
 the fight but not even goku fighting 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:54.260
 to the maximum could beat bills 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.510
 the maximum power of goku rises a little 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.340
 because it is so much the power that is 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.240
 use to be able to fight at a very high level 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:03.910
 similar to bills 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:06.190
 but bis before when he fights with go in 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:08.740
 way god he nothing else proves his power 

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:11.170
 but then he takes things a little 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:13.330
 really but watching a little the fight 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:15.730
 in blows and techniques he earns bills to 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:18.410
 goku there you see the big difference of 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:20.900
 power between the two 

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:23.990
 and that would not be the maximum power bills 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.880
 I think of him for being a god of 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:28.040
 soon his powers would go beyond 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.260
 our imagination but bills feels 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:32.630
 grateful and proud for fighting together 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:34.790
 with a super saiyans god but I still 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:37.310
 train much more I would arrive at the same 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:39.260
 level that bills up to now we do not 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:41.150
 we know how much real power would be 

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:43.820
 of bills because he has not yet shown 

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:46.310
 everything he could show but 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:48.320
 Well, here I leave you my great point of 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:51.020
 view if you liked this delen video 

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:53.410
 Thumb up subscribe if you want more 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.410
 videos 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:05:00.139
 it was decided by the public 7 to 5 

00:04:57.379 --> 00:05:03.110
 then chapter 2 could do it 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:05.210
 in less than 3 days but I have problems 

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:07.490
 with the video editor I would have to 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:09.500
 do it short I hope it is not short 

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:13.870
 at least 8 or 12 minutes 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.870
 good guys until next time
