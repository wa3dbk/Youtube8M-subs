this<00:00:29.090> is<00:00:29.240> our<00:00:29.390> small<00:00:29.540> one<00:00:29.900> we're<00:00:30.050> building<00:00:30.380> a

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:30.439 
this is our small one we're building a

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:33.340 
this is our small one we're building a
much<00:00:30.619> larger<00:00:31.009> one<00:00:31.189> pretty<00:00:31.400> soon<00:00:32.170> it<00:00:33.170> was<00:00:33.290> time

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:33.350 
much larger one pretty soon it was time

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:34.900 
much larger one pretty soon it was time
that<00:00:33.739> we<00:00:33.829> took<00:00:34.040> control<00:00:34.250> of<00:00:34.489> the<00:00:34.700> building

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:34.910 
that we took control of the building

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.690 
that we took control of the building
here<00:00:35.270> because<00:00:35.570> we<00:00:35.720> have<00:00:35.840> so<00:00:36.050> much<00:00:36.700> interest

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:37.700 
here because we have so much interest

here because we have so much interest
that<00:00:38.480> it<00:00:38.570> makes<00:00:38.780> sense<00:00:38.899> for<00:00:39.170> us<00:00:39.380> to<00:00:39.440> take

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.250 
that it makes sense for us to take

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.280 
that it makes sense for us to take
control<00:00:40.610> and<00:00:41.090> make<00:00:41.420> sure<00:00:41.630> that<00:00:41.870> the<00:00:42.050> quality

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:42.290 
control and make sure that the quality

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:52.310 
you a little indication that it's not as

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:54.250 
you a little indication that it's not as
scary<00:00:52.610> as<00:00:52.760> you<00:00:52.880> may<00:00:53.030> think<00:00:53.060> build<00:00:53.750> in<00:00:53.870> Costa

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 
scary as you may think build in Costa

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.180 
scary as you may think build in Costa
Rica<00:00:54.560> it's<00:00:55.340> not<00:00:55.640> that<00:00:56.000> much<00:00:56.270> different<00:00:56.980> if<00:00:57.980> you

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
Rica it's not that much different if you

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:59.590 
Rica it's not that much different if you
don't<00:00:58.340> speak<00:00:58.610> Spanish<00:00:59.090> it<00:00:59.240> could<00:00:59.450> be

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.600 
don't speak Spanish it could be

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.570 
don't speak Spanish it could be
intimidating<00:00:59.900> so<00:01:00.470> that's<00:01:00.620> why<00:01:00.830> we<00:01:01.070> act<00:01:01.250> as<00:01:01.430> the

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:01.580 
intimidating so that's why we act as the

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.730 
intimidating so that's why we act as the
middleman<00:01:02.030> and<00:01:02.360> we<00:01:03.290> work<00:01:03.470> with<00:01:03.650> the

then we're going to go down to a

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:12.969 
then we're going to go down to a
construction<00:01:10.909> site<00:01:11.329> and<00:01:12.200> I'm<00:01:12.320> going<00:01:12.470> to<00:01:12.560> do<00:01:12.950> a

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:19.510 
the ground up what kind of construction
you<00:01:17.689> can<00:01:17.900> expect<00:01:18.320> here<00:01:18.470> in<00:01:18.619> Costa<00:01:18.979> Rica

especially with Caribbean sunrise

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:25.599 
especially with Caribbean sunrise
construction<00:01:22.969> and<00:01:23.090> green<00:01:23.270> new<00:01:23.509> estates<00:01:24.609> very

construction and green new estates very

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:27.669 
construction and green new estates very
simple<00:01:26.060> process<00:01:26.270> it's<00:01:26.899> very<00:01:26.990> similar<00:01:27.469> to<00:01:27.590> the

00:01:27.669 --> 00:01:27.679 
simple process it's very similar to the

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:29.950 
simple process it's very similar to the
United<00:01:28.009> States<00:01:28.039> and<00:01:28.579> using<00:01:29.119> architects<00:01:29.810> and

engineers and getting your permission
from<00:01:32.509> the<00:01:32.659> municipality<00:01:33.789> it's<00:01:34.789> a<00:01:34.939> little<00:01:35.210> bit

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:35.329 
from the municipality it's a little bit

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:39.120 
from the municipality it's a little bit
different<00:01:35.749> here<00:01:35.780> as<00:01:36.229> all<00:01:36.679> our<00:01:36.889> building<00:01:37.280> is

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:39.130 
different here as all our building is

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.830 
different here as all our building is
seismically<00:01:40.130> reinforced<00:01:41.060> because<00:01:41.270> we<00:01:41.569> are<00:01:41.719> in

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:41.840 
seismically reinforced because we are in

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.469 
seismically reinforced because we are in
an<00:01:41.960> earthquake<00:01:42.350> zone<00:01:42.459> so<00:01:43.459> what<00:01:43.909> I<00:01:43.939> suggest

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:44.479 
an earthquake zone so what I suggest

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:47.020 
an earthquake zone so what I suggest
with<00:01:44.659> people<00:01:45.109> to<00:01:45.950> sit<00:01:46.189> down<00:01:46.340> with<00:01:46.579> the<00:01:46.670> local

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.030 
with people to sit down with the local

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.719 
with people to sit down with the local
architect<00:01:47.569> maybe<00:01:48.170> do<00:01:48.889> it<00:01:48.920> yourself<00:01:49.429> there's<00:01:49.670> a

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
architect maybe do it yourself there's a

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:51.370 
architect maybe do it yourself there's a
lot<00:01:49.880> of<00:01:49.999> great<00:01:50.209> software<00:01:50.780> out<00:01:50.899> there<00:01:50.929> you<00:01:51.229> can

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
lot of great software out there you can

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:54.190 
lot of great software out there you can
design<00:01:51.530> your<00:01:51.740> own<00:01:52.039> home<00:01:52.780> reason<00:01:53.780> being<00:01:53.959> it

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:54.200 
design your own home reason being it

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.679 
design your own home reason being it
have<00:01:54.439> to<00:01:54.789> submit<00:01:55.789> it<00:01:55.939> to<00:01:55.969> an<00:01:56.119> engineer<00:01:56.509> here

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:56.689 
have to submit it to an engineer here

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:59.499 
have to submit it to an engineer here
anyway<00:01:57.139> and<00:01:57.409> an<00:01:57.859> architect<00:01:58.429> they<00:01:59.060> have<00:01:59.329> to

00:01:59.499 --> 00:01:59.509 
anyway and an architect they have to

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:01.660 
anyway and an architect they have to
make<00:01:59.689> sure<00:01:59.719> that<00:01:59.959> that<00:02:00.590> the<00:02:00.770> design<00:02:01.130> is<00:02:01.159> is

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
make sure that that the design is is

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.499 
make sure that that the design is is
adequate<00:02:02.479> for<00:02:02.719> the<00:02:03.939> system<00:02:04.939> that<00:02:05.029> we<00:02:05.119> use<00:02:05.299> here

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:05.509 
adequate for the system that we use here

00:04:35.959 --> 00:04:35.969 
the site preparation we ran some

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:39.409 
the site preparation we ran some
temporary<00:04:36.840> electric<00:04:37.409> is<00:04:37.590> in<00:04:37.949> place<00:04:38.280> and<00:04:39.180> we

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:39.419 
temporary electric is in place and we

00:04:39.419 --> 00:05:26.450 
temporary electric is in place and we
have<00:04:39.539> water<00:04:39.810> and<00:04:39.960> everything<00:05:25.219> something<00:05:26.219> that

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:26.460 
have water and everything something that

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.390 
have water and everything something that
I<00:05:26.490> want<00:05:26.729> to<00:05:26.789> point<00:05:27.060> out<00:05:27.889> checking<00:05:28.889> up<00:05:29.099> over

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:29.400 
I want to point out checking up over

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:35.119 
I want to point out checking up over
here<00:05:32.419> because<00:05:33.419> when<00:05:33.690> you<00:05:33.719> twist<00:05:34.080> and<00:05:34.409> turn<00:05:34.680> in

00:05:35.119 --> 00:05:35.129 
here because when you twist and turn in

00:05:35.129 --> 00:05:37.579 
here because when you twist and turn in
case<00:05:35.400> there<00:05:35.639> is<00:05:35.669> any<00:05:35.909> tremors<00:05:36.509> and<00:05:37.080> we<00:05:37.229> want<00:05:37.500> to

00:05:37.579 --> 00:05:37.589 
case there is any tremors and we want to

00:05:37.589 --> 00:05:39.019 
case there is any tremors and we want to
have<00:05:37.680> more<00:05:37.710> support<00:05:38.370> down<00:05:38.550> here<00:05:38.610> in<00:05:38.940> your

00:05:39.019 --> 00:05:39.029 
have more support down here in your

00:05:39.029 --> 00:05:45.050 
have more support down here in your
column<00:05:39.449> therefore<00:05:43.430> and<00:05:44.430> when<00:05:44.669> we<00:05:44.759> get<00:05:44.940> this

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:45.060 
column therefore and when we get this

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:47.089 
column therefore and when we get this
recut<00:05:45.389> top<00:05:45.629> will<00:05:45.900> be<00:05:46.020> closer<00:05:46.259> together<00:05:46.529> again

00:05:47.089 --> 00:05:47.099 
recut top will be closer together again

00:05:47.099 --> 00:05:50.019 
recut top will be closer together again
and<00:05:47.610> the<00:05:48.180> lateral<00:05:48.539> pieces<00:05:48.990> will<00:05:49.169> be<00:05:49.199> the<00:05:49.469> same

00:05:50.019 --> 00:05:50.029 
and the lateral pieces will be the same

00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:53.719 
and the lateral pieces will be the same
where<00:05:51.029> you<00:05:51.089> can<00:05:51.270> basically<00:05:51.449> see<00:05:52.430> this<00:05:53.430> is<00:05:53.610> the

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:53.729 
where you can basically see this is the

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:56.329 
where you can basically see this is the
beginning<00:05:54.180> of<00:05:54.330> our<00:05:54.629> footer<00:05:55.069> now<00:05:56.069> we're<00:05:56.219> going

00:05:56.329 --> 00:05:56.339 
beginning of our footer now we're going

00:05:56.339 --> 00:05:57.640 
beginning of our footer now we're going
to<00:05:56.400> go<00:05:56.520> over<00:05:56.550> it

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:57.650 
to go over it

00:05:57.650 --> 00:05:59.620 
to go over it
and<00:05:57.949> I<00:05:58.010> really<00:05:58.340> thought<00:05:58.610> about<00:05:58.669> seismic

00:05:59.620 --> 00:05:59.630 
and I really thought about seismic

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:02.920 
and I really thought about seismic
considerations<00:06:00.410> here<00:06:01.240> so<00:06:02.240> this<00:06:02.419> is<00:06:02.570> what<00:06:02.780> the

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:02.930 
considerations here so this is what the

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:05.260 
considerations here so this is what the
architects<00:06:03.620> and<00:06:03.770> engineers<00:06:03.949> main<00:06:04.610> job<00:06:04.970> is

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:05.270 
architects and engineers main job is

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:09.010 
architects and engineers main job is
just<00:06:05.900> to<00:06:06.080> take<00:06:06.290> you<00:06:06.560> err<00:06:06.620> I<00:06:07.570> mean<00:06:08.570> can<00:06:08.780> you<00:06:08.810> be<00:06:08.990> a

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:09.020 
just to take you err I mean can you be a

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:10.600 
just to take you err I mean can you be a
sketch<00:06:09.350> actually<00:06:09.830> because<00:06:10.070> you<00:06:10.190> don't<00:06:10.340> detect

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:10.610 
sketch actually because you don't detect

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:12.879 
sketch actually because you don't detect
us<00:06:10.820> to<00:06:10.970> do<00:06:11.120> a<00:06:11.150> lot<00:06:11.360> of<00:06:11.479> work<00:06:11.630> but<00:06:11.900> most<00:06:12.500> people

00:06:12.879 --> 00:06:12.889 
us to do a lot of work but most people

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:14.770 
us to do a lot of work but most people
take<00:06:13.130> it<00:06:13.310> to<00:06:13.430> the<00:06:13.550> next<00:06:13.729> level<00:06:13.880> make<00:06:14.389> sure<00:06:14.419> they

take it to the next level make sure they
have<00:06:14.930> food<00:06:15.199> elevations<00:06:15.860> or<00:06:15.979> for<00:06:16.250> clams<00:06:16.580> but<00:06:17.330> no
