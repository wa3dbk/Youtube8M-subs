00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
unnecessarily hard to solve route

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.540 
unnecessarily hard to solve route
through<00:01:01.140> books<00:01:01.320> cube<00:01:01.500> so<00:01:02.010> a<00:01:02.039> few<00:01:02.309> things<00:01:02.340> to

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
essentially means is a single light

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.740 
essentially means is a single light
source<00:01:28.890> so<00:01:29.400> if<00:01:29.549> you've<00:01:29.729> got<00:01:29.909> overhead<00:01:30.540> light

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
source so if you've got overhead light

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.359 
source so if you've got overhead light
and<00:01:30.960> like<00:01:31.110> coming<00:01:31.439> in<00:01:31.500> from<00:01:31.680> outside<00:01:31.799> and<00:01:32.040> then

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
and like coming in from outside and then

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:34.190 
and like coming in from outside and then
you<00:01:32.400> got<00:01:32.579> a<00:01:32.610> lamp<00:01:32.970> it's<00:01:33.720> going<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:33.930> make<00:01:34.049> things

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
you got a lamp it's going to make things

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.560 
you got a lamp it's going to make things
look<00:01:34.380> very<00:01:34.439> weird<00:01:35.189> on<00:01:35.430> camera<00:01:35.490> this<00:01:36.329> is<00:01:36.420> a<00:01:36.450> good

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
look very weird on camera this is a good

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.539 
look very weird on camera this is a good
advice<00:01:36.780> for<00:01:36.960> really<00:01:37.140> whatever<00:01:37.290> camera<00:01:37.829> you're

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
advice for really whatever camera you're

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.090 
advice for really whatever camera you're
using<00:01:38.790> so<00:01:39.360> either<00:01:39.570> try<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:39.780> film<00:01:40.079> outside<00:01:40.320> or

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
using so either try to film outside or

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.010 
using so either try to film outside or
if<00:01:41.430> you're<00:01:41.549> inside<00:01:41.880> you<00:01:42.180> to<00:01:42.299> try<00:01:42.479> and<00:01:42.630> turn<00:01:42.810> off

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
if you're inside you to try and turn off

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.960 
if you're inside you to try and turn off
the<00:01:43.409> overhead<00:01:43.710> lights<00:01:44.130> or<00:01:44.369> using<00:01:44.610> only<00:01:44.729> light

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
the overhead lights or using only light

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.910 
the overhead lights or using only light
coming<00:01:45.299> in<00:01:45.450> or<00:01:45.659> if<00:01:45.720> it's<00:01:45.840> dark<00:01:46.079> out<00:01:46.259> you<00:01:46.770> can

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
coming in or if it's dark out you can

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.530 
coming in or if it's dark out you can
just<00:01:47.159> use<00:01:47.369> one<00:01:47.640> single<00:01:48.000> light<00:01:48.149> source<00:01:48.180> that's

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
just use one single light source that's

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.600 
just use one single light source that's
going<00:01:48.689> to<00:01:48.750> make<00:01:48.869> life<00:01:49.079> a<00:01:49.229> lot<00:01:49.649> easier<00:01:49.950> for<00:01:50.460> you

going to make life a lot easier for you
the<00:01:51.479> next<00:01:51.840> thing<00:01:51.990> is<00:01:52.170> try<00:01:52.590> and<00:01:52.710> mount<00:01:52.799> your

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
the next thing is try and mount your

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.249 
the next thing is try and mount your
camera<00:01:53.490> if<00:01:53.850> you<00:01:54.030> can<00:01:54.390> if<00:01:54.810> you<00:01:54.869> notice<00:01:55.140> when<00:01:55.200> I

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
camera if you can if you notice when I

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.480 
camera if you can if you notice when I
hold<00:01:55.409> my<00:01:55.530> hand<00:01:55.740> up<00:01:55.890> it's<00:01:56.040> not<00:01:56.130> resting<00:01:56.430> on

anything
things<00:01:57.030> get<00:01:57.210> a<00:01:57.240> little<00:01:57.990> bit<00:01:58.170> shaky<00:01:58.590> if<00:01:59.460> you

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
things get a little bit shaky if you

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.370 
things get a little bit shaky if you
don't<00:01:59.820> have<00:01:59.939> a<00:01:59.969> mount<00:02:00.270> what<00:02:00.479> you<00:02:00.540> can<00:02:00.689> do<00:02:00.869> is

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
don't have a mount what you can do is

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.620 
don't have a mount what you can do is
either<00:02:01.560> rest<00:02:01.920> your<00:02:02.159> hands<00:02:02.759> down<00:02:03.060> on<00:02:03.180> a<00:02:03.210> table

either rest your hands down on a table

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.260 
either rest your hands down on a table
or<00:02:03.780> put<00:02:04.560> your<00:02:04.710> elbows<00:02:05.100> down<00:02:05.340> and<00:02:05.610> sort<00:02:06.000> of<00:02:06.060> use

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
or put your elbows down and sort of use

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.270 
or put your elbows down and sort of use
that<00:02:06.299> as<00:02:06.750> an<00:02:07.140> anchor<00:02:07.439> and<00:02:07.829> then<00:02:07.950> you<00:02:08.039> can<00:02:08.160> do<00:02:08.250> it

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
that as an anchor and then you can do it

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.469 
that as an anchor and then you can do it
can<00:02:08.550> add<00:02:08.670> weight<00:02:08.910> is<00:02:09.000> going<00:02:09.119> to<00:02:09.179> keep<00:02:09.270> it<00:02:09.390> from

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
can add weight is going to keep it from

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.240 
can add weight is going to keep it from
shaking<00:02:09.750> and<00:02:10.530> it's<00:02:10.649> going<00:02:10.739> to<00:02:10.830> help<00:02:10.950> stabilize

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
shaking and it's going to help stabilize

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.069 
shaking and it's going to help stabilize
your<00:02:11.730> shot

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:13.079 
your shot

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:14.780 
your shot
next<00:02:13.680> you<00:02:13.769> want<00:02:13.920> to<00:02:13.980> see<00:02:14.129> if<00:02:14.370> your<00:02:14.519> phone's

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
next you want to see if your phone's

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.610 
next you want to see if your phone's
going<00:02:15.090> to<00:02:15.150> let<00:02:15.390> you<00:02:15.569> have<00:02:15.780> grids<00:02:16.200> and<00:02:16.409> we<00:02:16.470> can

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
going to let you have grids and we can

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.920 
going to let you have grids and we can
do<00:02:16.739> that<00:02:16.890> here<00:02:17.189> on<00:02:17.760> the<00:02:17.970> G<00:02:18.150> flex<00:02:18.390> so<00:02:18.599> that<00:02:18.750> just

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
do that here on the G flex so that just

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.509 
do that here on the G flex so that just
pulls<00:02:19.140> essentially<00:02:19.709> what<00:02:19.799> it<00:02:19.890> sounds<00:02:20.159> like<00:02:20.189> a

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:20.519 
pulls essentially what it sounds like a

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:23.390 
pulls essentially what it sounds like a
list<00:02:21.329> of<00:02:21.540> grids<00:02:22.110> here<00:02:22.439> lets<00:02:22.920> you<00:02:23.010> kind<00:02:23.189> of<00:02:23.220> use

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
list of grids here lets you kind of use

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:24.830 
list of grids here lets you kind of use
the<00:02:23.579> rule<00:02:23.790> of<00:02:23.819> thirds<00:02:24.180> which<00:02:24.450> is<00:02:24.540> basically

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
the rule of thirds which is basically

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:25.850 
the rule of thirds which is basically
placing<00:02:25.230> your<00:02:25.349> subject<00:02:25.709> at<00:02:25.799> the

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
placing your subject at the

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.289 
placing your subject at the
intersections<00:02:26.340> and<00:02:26.730> next<00:02:27.060> you're<00:02:27.150> gonna<00:02:27.209> want

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:27.299 
intersections and next you're gonna want

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:28.970 
intersections and next you're gonna want
to<00:02:27.480> turn<00:02:27.689> off<00:02:27.900> image<00:02:28.379> products<00:02:28.769> things<00:02:28.890> you

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
to turn off image products things you

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.380 
to turn off image products things you
have<00:02:29.069> more<00:02:29.189> flexibility<00:02:29.730> in<00:02:29.849> color<00:02:30.060> grading

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
have more flexibility in color grading

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.199 
have more flexibility in color grading
so<00:02:30.510> things<00:02:30.780> like<00:02:30.989> HDR<00:02:31.650> and<00:02:31.680> such<00:02:32.010> I<00:02:32.280> get<00:02:32.819> a<00:02:32.849> lot

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
so things like HDR and such I get a lot

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:34.789 
so things like HDR and such I get a lot
more<00:02:33.689> flexibility<00:02:34.230> sort<00:02:34.439> of<00:02:34.500> tweak<00:02:34.680> your

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:34.799 
more flexibility sort of tweak your

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:36.649 
more flexibility sort of tweak your
colors<00:02:35.159> and<00:02:35.310> make<00:02:35.400> them<00:02:35.549> look<00:02:35.760> however<00:02:36.060> you

00:02:36.649 --> 00:02:36.659 
colors and make them look however you

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:39.229 
colors and make them look however you
want<00:02:37.019> and<00:02:37.650> also<00:02:38.250> again<00:02:38.549> high<00:02:38.760> resolution<00:02:39.180> the

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
want and also again high resolution the

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:40.309 
want and also again high resolution the
better<00:02:39.269> high<00:02:39.540> resolution<00:02:39.959> is<00:02:40.019> going<00:02:40.170> to<00:02:40.230> let

00:02:40.309 --> 00:02:40.319 
better high resolution is going to let

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:41.960 
better high resolution is going to let
you<00:02:40.439> do<00:02:40.590> things<00:02:40.769> like<00:02:40.980> crop<00:02:41.280> again<00:02:41.459> also<00:02:41.700> leave

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
you do things like crop again also leave

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.940 
you do things like crop again also leave
it<00:02:42.150> allow<00:02:42.239> you<00:02:42.299> to<00:02:42.420> stabilize<00:02:42.659> shots<00:02:43.140> in<00:02:43.590> post

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
it allow you to stabilize shots in post

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.490 
it allow you to stabilize shots in post
so<00:02:44.579> this<00:02:44.940> guy<00:02:45.120> can<00:02:45.329> shoot<00:02:45.569> in<00:02:45.659> 4k<00:02:45.840> so<00:02:46.079> you<00:02:46.349> want

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
so this guy can shoot in 4k so you want

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.509 
so this guy can shoot in 4k so you want
to<00:02:46.560> go<00:02:46.620> through<00:02:46.769> and<00:02:46.859> check<00:02:46.980> your<00:02:47.099> resolution

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
to go through and check your resolution

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:49.520 
to go through and check your resolution
so<00:02:47.940> we've<00:02:48.120> got<00:02:48.299> it<00:02:48.480> set<00:02:48.659> for<00:02:48.930> you<00:02:49.109> way<00:02:49.260> too<00:02:49.319> deep

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
so we've got it set for you way too deep
