ahead and take a look at some of these
profiles<00:00:53.049> so<00:00:53.649> prototype<00:00:54.129> X<00:00:54.399> his<00:00:54.819> allegiance

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:55.389 
profiles so prototype X his allegiance

00:00:55.389 --> 00:01:00.419 
profiles so prototype X his allegiance
is<00:00:56.879> cept<00:00:57.879> Ron's<00:00:58.350> function<00:00:59.350> security<00:01:00.039> drone

00:01:00.419 --> 00:01:00.429 
is cept Ron's function security drone

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:03.149 
is cept Ron's function security drone
and<00:01:00.909> then<00:01:01.149> it<00:01:01.389> has<00:01:01.690> his<00:01:01.959> profile<00:01:02.469> there<00:01:02.859> as

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:03.159 
and then it has his profile there as

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:07.050 
and then it has his profile there as
well<00:01:03.760> as<00:01:04.030> project<00:01:04.660> Z<00:01:05.130> same<00:01:06.130> except<00:01:06.490> Ron's<00:01:06.760> and

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
well as project Z same except Ron's and

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.320 
well as project Z same except Ron's and
security<00:01:07.480> drones<00:01:07.690> so<00:01:08.020> very<00:01:08.470> very<00:01:09.000> very<00:01:10.000> cool

but alright let's go ahead and review
these<00:01:13.750> figures<00:01:14.110> on<00:01:14.980> one<00:01:15.190> of<00:01:15.280> the<00:01:15.340> box<00:01:18.090> right<00:01:19.090> so

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:19.330 
these figures on one of the box right so

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:20.760 
these figures on one of the box right so
taking<00:01:19.570> a<00:01:19.630> look<00:01:19.660> at<00:01:19.840> these<00:01:19.960> guys<00:01:20.140> in<00:01:20.350> alt<00:01:20.590> mode

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
taking a look at these guys in alt mode

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:26.160 
taking a look at these guys in alt mode
once<00:01:21.490> again<00:01:21.760> its<00:01:23.430> prototype<00:01:24.430> X<00:01:24.850> and<00:01:25.150> project<00:01:25.900> Z

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
once again its prototype X and project Z

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.860 
once again its prototype X and project Z
over<00:01:26.410> on<00:01:27.130> the<00:01:27.250> right-hand<00:01:27.460> side<00:01:27.850> and<00:01:28.690> yeah

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:28.870

very<00:01:29.590> very<00:01:29.950> cool<00:01:30.160> read<00:01:30.400> echoes<00:01:31.500> share<00:01:32.500> the

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:32.620 
very very cool read echoes share the

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
very very cool read echoes share the
same<00:01:32.880> all<00:01:33.880> modes<00:01:34.210> as<00:01:34.450> apex<00:01:34.960> and<00:01:35.110> gymnast<00:01:35.580> but<00:01:36.580> I

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
same all modes as apex and gymnast but I

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.790 
same all modes as apex and gymnast but I
really<00:01:37.180> do<00:01:37.360> like<00:01:37.570> the<00:01:37.720> chromed<00:01:38.050> accents<00:01:40.800> they

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:41.800 
really do like the chromed accents they

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.820 
really do like the chromed accents they
were<00:01:41.890> just<00:01:42.040> fantastic<00:01:43.380> really<00:01:44.380> offset<00:01:44.740> the

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 
were just fantastic really offset the

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.040 
were just fantastic really offset the
figures<00:01:45.100> well<00:01:45.400> I<00:01:45.670> do<00:01:46.270> like<00:01:46.420> the<00:01:46.780> fact<00:01:46.810> that

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.050 
figures well I do like the fact that

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.370 
figures well I do like the fact that
it's<00:01:47.500> colored<00:01:48.010> plastic<00:01:48.370> for<00:01:48.850> the<00:01:48.940> most<00:01:49.120> part

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
it's colored plastic for the most part

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
it's colored plastic for the most part
rather<00:01:50.380> than<00:01:50.560> paint<00:01:50.860> it<00:01:51.010> so<00:01:51.190> you're<00:01:51.310> not

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:51.400 
rather than paint it so you're not

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.740 
rather than paint it so you're not
worried<00:01:51.610> about<00:01:51.700> that<00:01:51.880> rub<00:01:52.300> and<00:01:52.330> stuff<00:01:52.659> like

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:52.750 
worried about that rub and stuff like

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:54.630 
worried about that rub and stuff like
that<00:01:52.840> when<00:01:53.050> you're<00:01:53.080> playing<00:01:53.350> with<00:01:53.620> them<00:01:53.740> okay

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
that when you're playing with them okay

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.120 
that when you're playing with them okay
and<00:01:54.940> one<00:01:55.630> thing<00:01:55.659> I<00:01:55.900> do<00:01:55.960> have<00:01:56.080> to<00:01:56.200> say<00:01:56.320> they

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
and one thing I do have to say they

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.520 
and one thing I do have to say they
retain<00:01:57.520> the<00:01:57.610> same<00:01:57.790> weapons<00:01:58.150> storage<00:01:58.409> here<00:01:59.409> on

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
retain the same weapons storage here on

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.630 
retain the same weapons storage here on
the<00:01:59.650> bottom<00:01:59.770> I<00:02:01.470> did<00:02:02.470> have<00:02:02.680> a<00:02:02.710> problem<00:02:03.190> on<00:02:03.310> each

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
the bottom I did have a problem on each

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.800 
the bottom I did have a problem on each
of<00:02:03.880> these<00:02:04.000> getting<00:02:04.510> the<00:02:04.890> stick<00:02:05.890> part<00:02:05.920> of<00:02:06.280> the

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
of these getting the stick part of the

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.450 
of these getting the stick part of the
mallets

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:09.460 
mallets

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.310 
mallets
separated<00:02:10.460> so<00:02:11.030> just<00:02:11.630> go<00:02:11.720> ahead<00:02:11.750> and<00:02:12.020> make<00:02:12.290> sure

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.320 
separated so just go ahead and make sure

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.070 
separated so just go ahead and make sure
that<00:02:12.500> you<00:02:12.710> twist<00:02:13.100> those<00:02:13.370> to<00:02:13.850> you<00:02:14.750> know<00:02:14.870> take

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
that you twist those to you know take

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.660 
that you twist those to you know take
them<00:02:15.230> apart<00:02:15.670> all<00:02:16.670> right<00:02:16.790> i'm<00:02:17.510> outside<00:02:17.660> of<00:02:17.960> that

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
them apart all right i'm outside of that

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.760 
them apart all right i'm outside of that
here's<00:02:19.670> the<00:02:19.880> all<00:02:20.000> modes<00:02:20.440> and<00:02:21.440> let's<00:02:21.620> take<00:02:21.710> a

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
here's the all modes and let's take a

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.950 
here's the all modes and let's take a
look<00:02:21.890> at<00:02:21.980> the<00:02:22.040> robot<00:02:22.310> modes<00:02:22.720> no<00:02:23.720> get<00:02:23.900> you

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:23.960 
look at the robot modes no get you

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.750 
look at the robot modes no get you
taking<00:02:24.200> a<00:02:24.230> look<00:02:24.350> at<00:02:24.470> the<00:02:24.560> robot<00:02:24.980> modes<00:02:25.310> once

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
taking a look at the robot modes once

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:29.440 
taking a look at the robot modes once
again<00:02:26.530> prototype<00:02:27.530> x<00:02:27.800> project<00:02:28.400> Z<00:02:28.670> make<00:02:29.120> ideas

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:29.450 
again prototype x project Z make ideas

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:36.210 
again prototype x project Z make ideas
all<00:02:30.170> right<00:02:30.610> so<00:02:31.610> one<00:02:32.060> little<00:02:34.030> design<00:02:35.030> thing<00:02:35.450> i

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:36.220 
all right so one little design thing i

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.280 
all right so one little design thing i
always<00:02:37.220> take<00:02:38.060> these<00:02:38.360> it<00:02:38.720> doesn't<00:02:38.990> look<00:02:39.080> like

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290 
always take these it doesn't look like

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
them forward so let me do that on the

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:56.350 
them forward so let me do that on the
other<00:02:50.900> guy<00:02:51.080> here<00:02:54.550> well<00:02:55.550> I<00:02:55.580> really<00:02:56.090> don't<00:02:56.120> like

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
other guy here well I really don't like

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.880 
other guy here well I really don't like
it<00:02:56.510> on<00:02:56.600> him<00:02:56.780> because<00:02:56.930> I<00:02:57.080> know<00:02:57.110> those<00:02:57.680> are

00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:57.890 
it on him because I know those are

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:00.040 
it on him because I know those are
supposed<00:02:58.190> to<00:02:58.250> face<00:02:58.400> forward<00:02:58.760> but<00:02:59.090> you<00:02:59.660> know<00:02:59.780> I

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
supposed to face forward but you know I

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.740 
supposed to face forward but you know I
think<00:03:00.890> that<00:03:00.980> looks<00:03:01.160> a<00:03:01.250> little<00:03:01.400> bit<00:03:01.580> better<00:03:01.790> but

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
think that looks a little bit better but

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.430 
think that looks a little bit better but
anyway<00:03:03.130> just<00:03:04.130> like<00:03:04.400> apex<00:03:04.940> and<00:03:05.120> Jimena<00:03:05.540> they

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
anyway just like apex and Jimena they

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.430 
anyway just like apex and Jimena they
are<00:03:06.620> definitely<00:03:06.860> plenty<00:03:07.790> poseable<00:03:08.600> I<00:03:08.810> like

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:09.440 
are definitely plenty poseable I like

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.140 
are definitely plenty poseable I like
that<00:03:09.650> they<00:03:09.920> do<00:03:09.980> have<00:03:10.190> the<00:03:10.310> ability<00:03:10.400> to<00:03:10.730> holster

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
that they do have the ability to holster

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.590 
that they do have the ability to holster
the<00:03:11.360> guns<00:03:11.570> and<00:03:11.810> the<00:03:12.100> back<00:03:13.100> like<00:03:13.340> so<00:03:13.580> so<00:03:14.420> that's

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
the guns and the back like so so that's

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.600 
the guns and the back like so so that's
pretty<00:03:14.780> cool<00:03:14.930> in<00:03:15.110> terms<00:03:15.320> of<00:03:15.590> just<00:03:16.220> weapons

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:20.270 
was a little bit better of a way to

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:23.230
