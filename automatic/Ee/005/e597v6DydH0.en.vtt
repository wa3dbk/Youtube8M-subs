tornado coil I've taken the cover off

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:21.679 
tornado coil I've taken the cover off
because<00:00:16.890> I<00:00:17.160> want<00:00:17.400> to<00:00:20.060> keep<00:00:21.060> it<00:00:21.240> as<00:00:21.330> light<00:00:21.539> as

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
deep but it helps have the smaller coil
