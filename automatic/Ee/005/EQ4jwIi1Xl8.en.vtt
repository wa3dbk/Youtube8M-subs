00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:12.820
 Hi, I'm Carmen from driving schools 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:14.530
 first we are in badalona and we are going to 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.439
 talk about the agents that regulate the 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:19.990
 traffic if we know there is an order 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:22.869
 of signals circumstantial agents 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:25.119
 vertical and horizontal traffic lights or 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:27.699
 road markings and the agents we 

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:31.020
 we find in the first category are the 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:34.090
 that we always have to obey if 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:37.270
 then we can not find an agent 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:39.789
 that has the arm raised if the arm 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.920
 lifted vertically and we have to 

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:44.589
 know that in this case you have to 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:47.440
 stop all vehicle users 

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:50.199
 all users who come to the 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:53.190
 people come from where they come in front of 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:57.570
 back from left to right all 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:01:00.390
 ok here in this case they stop all 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:03.539
 road users who approach 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.299
 the people all the users that is if 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.610
 this can be a tourism outside a group 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.310
 of pedestrians also stops or a 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.799
 pedestrian in a wheelchair or a cyclist 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.920
 walking with the bike next to all 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.899
 users of life yes yes when has 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.149
 raised the arm we have already 

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:24.780
 entered the intersection then already 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:28.140
 we left vale and if instead of being in a 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.450
 intersection is on a normal highway 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.580
 that is not a crossroad then we 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.000
 stop immediately before the 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.000
 people 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.950
 OK 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.470
 here we see that people have the arm 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.570
 lifted vertically because there has been 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.470
 an accident then we stop 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.470
 before the intersection 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:56.770
 if it turns out that people have arms 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:59.560
 stretched horizontally now in this 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:02.320
 case that only has the right it 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.330
 stop all who cut the 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.340
 trajectory of the arm all 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:09.640
 drivers of vehicles that cut the 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:12.160
 trajectory of the arm is worth and if it has 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.650
 the two arms extended because they would be 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.220
 the drivers who come in front and 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.650
 behind 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.650
 ok here we see the one that cuts the 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.540
 trajectory of the arm and if you have both 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.450
 extended arms those who come by 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.540
 front and back here to have in 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.400
 mind that even if you lower your arms 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:34.520
 we have to continue to have detainees 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.360
 until people change position or 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.190
 another sign 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.260
 as we have seen in the video 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.810
 if you move your arm from top to bottom 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:47.709
 moderate the speed that we go a little 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:51.859
 slower than there 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:54.620
 if the agent has a red light or 

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:57.890
 yellow on the arm swinging the 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:03:02.359
 has to stop swinging a light 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:06.190
 red or yellow stop it worth where 

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:08.620
 Well, not where the people tell us 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:12.220
 whenever an agent swings a light 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:14.530
 red or yellow you have to stop 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.690
 users to whom it directs to light and 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.140
 where he tells us that we have to 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.140
 having 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:27.200
 with the whistle with the whistle can 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:31.190
 make a long touch and short touches and 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:33.140
 frequent and pipi worth this is like in 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.390
 a football game let's say when the 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:38.000
 umpire starts the match 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:42.410
 not because players start running 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.350
 and we resume the march yes yes 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.820
 makes short and frequent touches 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.980
 stop like in a football match 

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:51.500
 the game is over or the players for 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:54.380
 we also play short and 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:57.489
 frequent stop and a long touch 

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.489
 resume the march 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:03.480
 OK 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:06.120
 and then what we have seen so far 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.400
 are the signals that can be 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:10.709
 agents and that are regulated by the 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.690
 code then know that the agents 

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:15.000
 they can make any kind of signal 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:17.639
 let's say they can do whatever they want 

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.850
 as long as they are understandable by all 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:22.560
 the users of the road are worth and always 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.270
 that you are regulating traffic have 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.860
 that having any have to have the 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:29.880
 reflective vest his garments 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:34.139
 reflective visible at 150 meters as 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:38.669
 all reflective garments yes 

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:40.560
 we know that if there is a person regulating 

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:43.199
 traffic for example on a trip 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:46.710
 school because we have to obey what 

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:49.259
 as if it were an agent if in this case 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.810
 are going through one step to 

00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:54.599
 pedestrians but if it were in the middle of the 

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:57.389
 causeway that this person puts the palette 

00:04:54.599 --> 00:05:00.120
 of stop we have to obey the same 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:03.389
 as if he were an agent and we should leave 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:05.599
 pass to all the people who have 

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:05.599
 what to pass 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:12.949
 from the vehicle you can have the arm 

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:16.010
 extended and fixed here is telling us 

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:18.110
 that we have to stop behind the 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:21.949
 police vehicle where we are 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:24.410
 indicating knowing that it may be that 

00:05:21.949 --> 00:05:27.110
 sometimes we find ourselves policemen who pass 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:29.120
 with the bike and a flag for any 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:32.780
 circumstance for example a career of 

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:35.419
 bikes or something like that if it happens with a flag 

00:05:32.780 --> 00:05:38.270
 Red is worth the motorcycle with a red flag 

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:41.479
 know that the roadway is temporarily 

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:43.040
 closed to traffic if from step 

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:46.700
 of the people the road is left 

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:50.870
 temporarily closed to traffic 

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:53.630
 if instead of being red is green because we 

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:55.640
 is saying that the road is already 

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:58.640
 new open to traffic you can already 

00:05:55.640 --> 00:06:00.620
 happen but keep in mind is not you 

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:03.410
 can advance the police with the 

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:05.840
 flags can not be overtaken 

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:07.490
 if they asked us from the step of 

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:10.490
 the people with the green flag we can 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:13.639
 overtake not 

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:15.800
 and if it's yellow , it's telling us 

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:18.169
 you can pass the step is open but 

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:20.449
 With caution it indicates for example 

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:23.150
 well this the proximity of any 

00:06:20.449 --> 00:06:25.300
 danger can be passed but with 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:28.120
 caution 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:31.750
 if from the police car if from 

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:35.620
 the police car we found some 

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:38.349
 flashing red or yellow lights 

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:41.620
 for us that is to say we are driving 

00:06:38.349 --> 00:06:43.780
 our vehicle and behind comes a car 

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:46.030
 of police with red lights or 

00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:49.270
 yellow as the red hand or 

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:52.060
 yellow has happened something we have to 

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:55.240

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:57.729

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:59.440

00:06:57.729 --> 00:07:01.659
 police vehicle right on 

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:04.389

 It has a red light 

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:20.320

00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:22.810
 security conditions and we do not
