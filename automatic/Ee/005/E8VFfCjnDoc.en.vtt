back on the back two sections and on the

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.860 
back on the back two sections and on the

highlighted<00:00:52.739> pores<00:00:53.070> hair<00:00:53.370> because<00:00:54.239> this

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
highlighted pores hair because this

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.110 
highlighted pores hair because this
section<00:00:54.719> of<00:00:55.140> my<00:00:55.170> hair<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.739> front<00:00:56.010> is<00:00:56.219> a<00:00:56.609> lot

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
section of my hair the front is a lot

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.479 
section of my hair the front is a lot
thinner<00:00:57.500> so<00:00:58.500> I<00:00:58.530> wanted<00:00:58.949> to<00:00:59.039> see<00:00:59.129> how<00:00:59.250> that

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
thinner so I wanted to see how that

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.520 
thinner so I wanted to see how that
would<00:00:59.850> work<00:00:59.910> on<00:01:00.329> my<00:01:00.420> hair<00:01:00.600> and<00:01:00.629> I<00:01:00.750> thought<00:01:00.930> it

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
would work on my hair and I thought it

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.560 
would work on my hair and I thought it
might<00:01:01.769> not<00:01:02.280> straighten<00:01:02.609> my<00:01:02.670> hair<00:01:02.699> as<00:01:03.030> much<00:01:03.329> or

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
might not straighten my hair as much or

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.919 
might not straighten my hair as much or
black<00:01:03.780> smoke<00:01:03.899> curl<00:01:04.199> as<00:01:04.350> much<00:01:04.729> so<00:01:05.729> this<00:01:06.660> is<00:01:06.810> how

00:01:06.919 --> 00:01:06.929 
black smoke curl as much so this is how

00:01:06.929 --> 00:01:11.480 
black smoke curl as much so this is how
it<00:01:07.050> turned<00:01:07.080> out<00:01:07.380> so<00:01:08.539> I<00:01:09.539> liked<00:01:10.140> it<00:01:10.170> but<00:01:11.039> I<00:01:11.100> didn't

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
it turned out so I liked it but I didn't

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.370 
it turned out so I liked it but I didn't
notice<00:01:11.759> that<00:01:11.789> my<00:01:12.420> hair<00:01:12.630> feels<00:01:12.869> very<00:01:13.200> very

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
notice that my hair feels very very

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.560 
notice that my hair feels very very
coated<00:01:14.070> compared<00:01:14.640> to<00:01:14.759> the<00:01:14.880> last<00:01:15.030> time<00:01:15.270> I<00:01:15.390> did

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
coated compared to the last time I did

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.320 
coated compared to the last time I did
my<00:01:15.720> hair<00:01:15.929> I'm<00:01:16.440> back<00:01:16.740> last<00:01:17.039> year<00:01:17.340> if<00:01:17.880> there's<00:01:18.240> a

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
my hair I'm back last year if there's a

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.210 
my hair I'm back last year if there's a
lot<00:01:18.539> coating<00:01:18.899> that's<00:01:19.110> a<00:01:19.530> little<00:01:20.009> bit<00:01:20.130> of

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
lot coating that's a little bit of

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.550 
lot coating that's a little bit of
coding<00:01:20.399> in<00:01:20.550> a<00:01:20.610> minute<00:01:20.880> very<00:01:21.209> hard<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:22.170> kind<00:01:22.440> of

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
coding in a minute very hard to kind of

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.889 
coding in a minute very hard to kind of
brush<00:01:22.830> my<00:01:23.039> hair<00:01:23.069> and<00:01:23.310> call<00:01:23.700> me<00:01:23.880> so<00:01:24.539> I<00:01:24.599> said<00:01:24.780> well

brush my hair and call me so I said well

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:26.270 
brush my hair and call me so I said well
maybe<00:01:24.990> it's<00:01:25.200> because<00:01:25.319> of<00:01:25.560> a<00:01:25.619> part<00:01:25.890> from<00:01:26.009> when<00:01:26.190> I

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280
