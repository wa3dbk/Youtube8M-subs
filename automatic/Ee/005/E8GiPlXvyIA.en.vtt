 hair reduces frizz ndjoku san 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:32.120
 road book and in addition they are very very 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:36.500
 well an exotic fragrance that remains that I 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:38.090
 I was pissed off if a few games 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.830
 have trouble looping you can test 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.120
 your hair or wrap them around 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:43.120
 roof to draw the loop 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:47.450
 then I go from a very 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.280
 important and the stage of the chemistry screen 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.750
 in fact it's technical is to 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.600
 crinkle the hair to give them a 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.640
 maximum of feeling so we press the 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.680
 hair from the bottom and we go back 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.450
 up and rebels once 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:03.459
 this operation which we press in 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.459
 from the bottom and upwards demos 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:13.200
 after I apply my styling mousse 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.910
 grass that will fix and give even more 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.280
 of tone at the end so always by 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.860
 sections on the entire hair is 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.230
 again I cross hair in 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.870
 from the bottom and going up to the 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:32.520
 top I repeat this operation several 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:34.319
 points when I finished applying it 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.000
 mamouth I crumple again all 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:38.780
 gentlemen 2 for maximum 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.780
 of spring 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.459
 after applying the care and the 

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:53.150
 fly wedges my hair is saturated 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:54.859
 of public 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.959
 I take it then wanted to review in 

00:03:54.859 --> 00:04:00.920
 Microfiber back absorb the surplus 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:02.719
 is not so li té the drying it can not 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:04.700
 especially not face the hair but 

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:06.620
 there again we press the whole of the 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:10.060
 hair in the turban then we go back 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:10.060
 from the bottom to the roots 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:15.650
 after observing the excess water and 

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:17.690
 of product I go to the last stage of the 

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:21.280
 diffuser drying to obtain a 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.280
 beautiful volume and beautiful curls 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:27.889
 I dream the camera on speed and 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.449
 maximum heat of course it's not 

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:29.720
 advised but this is the mode that I can 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:32.060
 make 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.710
 after if you want less volume 

00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:36.889
 set the camera under normal speed 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:38.750
 and drying learns so that's gone I 

00:04:36.889 --> 00:04:40.940
 tilts his head forward again for 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.620
 get more boulou and then I try 

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:45.740
 to group a maximum of hair that 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:47.720
 I place in the goal if i there I leave 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:51.160
 of the lease I was making the roots and I 

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.160
 repeats movement several times 

00:04:56.319 --> 00:05:03.289
 then I go to the side and I repair 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:04.819
 and movements the advantage diffuser 

00:05:03.289 --> 00:05:06.289
 it is precisely that the heat is 

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:08.090
 diffuses homogeneously 

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:09.800
 this way we can pass the 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.990
 diffusions inside the hair 

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.819
 and also at the root level for 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:16.090
 take off and here again to get neither 

00:05:13.819 --> 00:05:16.090
 volume 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:30.069
 unfortunately my damaged spikes do not 

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:32.199
 loop more suddenly I take my stick 

00:05:30.069 --> 00:05:35.819
 the water heights about 30 cm and 

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:35.819
 I add a hail of torturers 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:51.130
 I spray on the tips and I believe 

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:55.110
 only slightly to get a slight 

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:55.110
 sure hold and a moment plus a grave 

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:16.850
 it's almost over 

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:24.170
 I spend one last time 

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:25.370
 diffusers for the finishes I 

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:26.000
 do not hesitate to blur the wicks 

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:28.280
 finds 

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:31.420
 and to finish I work together 

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:31.420
 to give me a final shape 

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:56.050
 it is true that my hair is damaged 

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:59.020
 but I still get and buckle 

00:06:56.050 --> 00:07:00.670
 with a good one better we will say that 

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:03.270
 the spikes to double its highest in 

00:07:00.670 --> 00:07:03.270
 play range 

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.950
 this is finished I hope this 

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:14.630
 video will help you loop more 

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:14.630
 easily beauchamp work
