00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:14.460
 hello everyone here we are with a new 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.610
 analysis of globe weapons quarters 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.380
 and today it's the turn of the cw r this weapon of 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.510
 the engineer class to unlock 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.150
 we have to do the next mission 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:27.720
 achieve 20 deaths with anti-tank missiles 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:30.450
 and 30 deaths with carbines the country of 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.720
 origin of this weapon is USA and the 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:36.300
 firing rate of the cw r is 850 

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.760
 shots per minute which places it as 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.710
 one of the assault carbines with greater 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.710
 firing rate only has to 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.510
 over encourage another weapon of the 

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:48.120
 barracks that we will analyze in a video 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:52.410
 later the size of the charger the 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:55.020
 wrc is 26 bullets plus one chamber and the 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:58.410
 The weapon's recharge time is 185 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:00.660
 seconds when a has bullets and 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.270
 both in the charger or in the chamber and 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:06.180
 of 250 seconds to make a recharge 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:09.000
 Complete this weapon has two modes 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:12.000
 automatic and semi-automatic firing 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.060
 the damage it produces is 20% per 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.110
 shot up to 8 meters and 16.7 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.410
 hundred 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.570
 per shot up to 50 meters is the 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:24.830
 second carbine with greater damage 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:28.190
 only behind the scale h 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:31.610
 the recoil of this weapon is 0.1 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:34.970
 to the left 0.2 up and 0.3 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:37.310
 to the right as you can see is a 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.230
 it has very little setback and actually 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.840
 is one of the carbines with minor 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:44.490
 kick of the whole game 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.390
 good 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:51.149
 as you see under numbers and under the data 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:54.030
 technicians is practically the best weapon 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:57.210
 within the engineer class of 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:00.090
 battlefield 3 but for me it has a great 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.189
 problem the charger the charger 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.530
 four or five bullets are missing if it was a 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:06.960
 31 bullet magazine 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.610
 surely the weapon would change a lot 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.099
 because many times we find that 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.870
 we found the enemies at the second 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:15.960
 when one is firing you run out 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:20.520
 bullets and many times then 

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:22.590
 the gun fails so because 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.740
 finds that some bullets are missing in the 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:29.520
 charger and from my point of view to 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:31.500
 supply this lack of bullets within the 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.480
 maps of which the lantern the 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.220
 Flashlight what it does is an advantage 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.900
 tactic makes 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:40.900
 and many times when you find others 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.310
 enemies with a charger reaches you by 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:46.000
 basically because you make the 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:48.400
 enemies do not go to you can not you 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.340
 kill before and you can shoot them your best 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.770
 to them because the blinds no other 

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:56.830
 accessory that would be indispensable if not 

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:59.890
 you play in the barracks would be the laser 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:02.050
 to have better better aim from the 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.490
 hip and to also bother a little 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:07.300
 the enemies when we are 

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:09.340
 shooting and the other advisors that stops 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.230
 me are indispensable are two in the 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:15.180
 holographic peephole for me the best 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:18.790
 peephole that you can carry in this weapon and 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:20.830
 the grip because the grip if 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.770
 it has just recoil is the carbine 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:24.670
 with lower recoil of the whole game 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:27.850
 Because even if very little 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:30.100
 recoil with the hilt will suppress 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:34.000
 any recoil what still 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:37.120
 makes this better and much more deadly 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.760
 weapon not as you see is a very good weapon 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:42.190
 but it lacks the little problem that it has 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:46.220
 is the charger that is missing four or 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:49.760
 five more bullets you were 45 more bullets 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:53.570
 really this weapon would be without any 

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:55.250
 doubt the best the best the best of the 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:57.430
 gender class anyway is very 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.930
 very good weapon and I recommend it very much 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:03.230
 and nothing you already know like favorites has 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:07.810
 liked this analysis and nothing kids 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.810
 see you in the next come chao 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:14.379
 ah 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.110
 and
