surprising<00:03:00.800> for<00:03:01.370> the<00:03:01.459> current<00:03:01.700> crop<00:03:02.030> of<00:03:02.090> cars

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
surprising for the current crop of cars

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.390 
surprising for the current crop of cars
what<00:03:02.690> are<00:03:02.750> you<00:03:02.810> forecasting<00:03:03.410> for<00:03:03.530> 2010<00:03:04.220> for

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
what are you forecasting for 2010 for

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.710 
what are you forecasting for 2010 for
the<00:03:04.459> mini<00:03:05.530> okay<00:03:06.530> well<00:03:06.709> 2009<00:03:07.489> surprisingly<00:03:08.300> was

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
the mini okay well 2009 surprisingly was

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.380 
the mini okay well 2009 surprisingly was
our<00:03:08.900> second<00:03:09.320> best<00:03:09.530> year<00:03:09.770> ever<00:03:09.830> and<00:03:10.370> we<00:03:11.060> expect

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390 
our second best year ever and we expect

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:15.550 
our second best year ever and we expect
that<00:03:11.540> 2009<00:03:12.500> will<00:03:13.040> be<00:03:13.220> better<00:03:13.459> than<00:03:14.560> 2000-2010

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:15.560 
that 2009 will be better than 2000-2010

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.010 
that 2009 will be better than 2000-2010
will<00:03:15.800> be<00:03:15.920> better<00:03:16.070> than<00:03:16.310> 2009<00:03:17.060> so<00:03:17.780> from<00:03:17.989> that

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.020 
will be better than 2009 so from that

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.620 
will be better than 2009 so from that
perspective<00:03:18.350> we<00:03:18.950> don't<00:03:19.160> see<00:03:19.370> a<00:03:19.580> huge<00:03:20.270> growth

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:20.630 
perspective we don't see a huge growth

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.840 
perspective we don't see a huge growth
in<00:03:20.810> the<00:03:20.959> market<00:03:21.350> but<00:03:21.380> sustained<00:03:21.920> growth<00:03:22.190> all
