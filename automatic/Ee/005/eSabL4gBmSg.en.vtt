absolutely amazing but with lower
maintenance<00:02:01.450> and<00:02:01.870> generally<00:02:02.350> lower<00:02:02.530> costs

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
maintenance and generally lower costs

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.910 
maintenance and generally lower costs
and<00:02:03.160> of<00:02:04.060> course<00:02:04.330> you<00:02:04.510> might<00:02:04.660> use<00:02:04.960> these<00:02:05.290> accent

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:05.920

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.419 
and of course you might use these accent
tiles<00:02:06.370> or<00:02:06.580> deco<00:02:07.150> trails

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
six subway like like this but we might

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.280 
six subway like like this but we might
just<00:02:18.610> use<00:02:18.820> maybe<00:02:19.270> five<00:02:19.510> or<00:02:19.540> six<00:02:19.690> of<00:02:19.930> these<00:02:20.020> in<00:02:20.230> a
