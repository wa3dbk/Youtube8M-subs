00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.830
 here I live 

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.960
 and very good to all I am fury we are going to 

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:35.030
 see this trick to be able to fly with 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.220
 our bike is worth what we have to 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.110
 do is load this race is very 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:41.000
 simple to assert the race is the 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.190
 peak performance and we will choose 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.540
 this bike the cork does not look like 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.699
 this mountain bike the one that has 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:49.489
 fender back and forth and once 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:52.070
 that you have put this race we are going to 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:54.230
 do the following thing you pay attention to 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.780
 the details of the video 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:59.149
 Now we have to make a good jump 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.500
 It's worth to be able to fly more time 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:02.770
 we have to do is we come by 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:06.050
 this part of back we climb this slope 

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:07.520
 and here and I say okay, I did not get the 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:10.460
 first you have to do several jumps 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.229
 the first time I got stuck with a rock 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.850
 the other time I came to the city but this 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:16.190
 It is the biggest leap we have to 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.020
 do you do when you're on this ramp 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.490
 look good in this rock and when 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.289
 let's be here what we are going to do is 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.930
 give poisoning back as if it were 

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:26.040
 we are going to do a 360 but we are staying 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.620
 in this position and as you see 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.180
 we are literally flying alone that the 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.820
 gravity for the rest we're not leaving 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.160
 lowering very little this effect of 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.930
 be flying with the bike is worth here os 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.880
 I leave the highest jump that has achieved 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.640
 do not say the one arrived from the 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.950
 highest mountain to the water and now 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.390
 let's go I'll put the map so you can see 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.040
 where is this location is the 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.750
 highest mountain in the game 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.000
 where is the chairlift right there 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.979
 above you will see 22 activities worth it is 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.720
 one is a parachute and another is this 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.830
 career then legislate 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.229
 you can invite your friends 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.119
 etcetera and see who makes the jump more 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.259
 long since that has been everything I hope that 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:02.130
 you liked it and see you in the 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.320
 next video 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.360
 until next time by the way the video that 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.770
 I climbed yesterday from the limit car to which 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.240
 it can also be done in play 3 os 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.630
 left the links in the description of 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.630
 that video 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.200
