00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.540
I was the first one in position, as always.

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:12.450
I met my enemies head-on.

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:15.820
They wanted to stop me…

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.570
but my vehicle did its job, and so did I.

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.210
Then the rest of the team arrived and it was time for me to move on.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.120
But it seems that was exactly what they were waiting for…

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:40.960
The AMX 50 B got into trouble

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.620
because it lost concentration for a moment.

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:46.930
A tank like this doesn't allow for mistakes.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.440
It's large, and easy to hit.

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:51.600
It's a juicy target for artillery,

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.960
and because of its size it's difficult to find cover.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.640
If only its size were the sole problem.

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.060
There's also no armor-most guns can penetrate it easily.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.340
And when they do, you lose so many modules

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.900
that your eyes will hurt from the red glare in corner of the screen.

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.370
Then there's the four shot magazine.

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.290
Average damage from a drum is only 1600.

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.410
It's not enough to destroy a target one-on-one.

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.850
This is not a duelist.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.560
That was nasty, but I survived.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.900
There's a strong opponent somewhere up ahead.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:37.820
I may end up regretting this,

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.160
but a dash forward and a surprise attack are what is needed right now.

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.000
Ouch! He was waiting for me.

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:50.910
That was the final hit.

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.480
It could have happened to anyone. Remember,

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.860
the AMX 50 B always has a choice in where and when it wants to be.

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.540
This is a tank with the spirit of a warrior.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.250
The warrior cares nothing for pain.

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.790
The warrior knows his capabilities and what is needed to win.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.080
There are different paths to victory,

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.530
and the AMX 50 B is the master of finding them.

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.450
For example, at the start of a battle there are several options to choose from.

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.480
You can follow allied heavy tanks into the city,

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.810
or you could join a wolf pack with your medium tanks.

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.830
You can even stay close to the base, provide long range fire support,

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:37.840
and wait to see how the battle develops.

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:43.700
This diversity of tactical options comes from the mobility of the AMX 50 B.

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.480
It is the fastest of the heavy tanks.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.090
The combination of speed and manoeuvrability allows it to compete

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.180
with medium tanks and even outmatch many of them.

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:59.470
These are very respectable traits and they explain the lack of armor.

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:04.850
By the way, the situation with the armor isn't quite as simple as the numbers make out.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.340
The front of the tank is well-armored and well-sloped.

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.460
There's even a strip that is 230-mm thick.

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:18.160
With this, you may think that all you have to do is hide the turret and tank with your front plate!

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.850
Well, that can sort of work until you need to take a shot…

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:23.530
But not always!

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:30.400
The warrior has a secret move-ramming, and the AMX 50 B is one of the best at it!

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.770
You may be turning a corner in a city,

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:36.530
and suddenly you realize you've just crushed

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:40.000
an AMX 13 90, or any other light tank.

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:47.720
The 50 B is so good at ramming that it even outperforms the E 50 M.

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:53.140
When tanks collide, the impact point is determined on each vehicle,

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.140
and damage is received through this spot.

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.450
The amount of damage received depends on a number of different factors.

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:03.140
The primary ones are the tank's weight and speed,

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:04.670
and the thickness of its armor.

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:10.450
The combination of these traits makes the 50 B an exceptional vehicle for ramming.

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.650
I was caught off guard but I reacted in time.

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.360
Now it's an easy target.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.460
There's a chance to look around and,

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.470
with a little luck, I can relax for a moment.

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:31.520
No such luck.

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.710
The enemy appeared right in front of me, while I was reloading!

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:41.300
Yes, you can't take out a full-HP tank with a single magazine

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.530
but things look much better if you can ram your opponent first.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.610
In other respects the gun is very good.

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.830
The magazine reload is fast,

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:52.930
and the shells fly true.

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:56.560
Armour penetration is good enough and the gun depression is fine.

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:02.090
These traits make it possible to fight effectively at both close and long ranges.

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:05.660
The AMX 50 B is purely a warrior.

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:08.930
Probably because of this, it's very unforgiving.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.850
Then again, the AMX 50 100

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:14.240
and AMX 50 120,

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.340
which come before the 50 B, are very similar.

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:20.730
You won't encounter anything particularly new or shocking.

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:24.920
The cost of making a mistake is just higher than ever.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.650
You have to make choices when driving this tank.

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:30.000
Do you head for the town now or later?

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.770
Do you take the shot and run away for a reload, or wait for a better opportunity?

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:36.980
Do you finish off two damaged vehicles,

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:41.360
or unload the whole magazine into a full-health enemy?

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:43.960
Do you heal your Commander or your Driver?

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:52.810
When engaging in a melee, you need to stay behind your teammates,

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:57.770
replying with four shells for every enemy shot.

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:59.900
You should always look for the opportunity

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.940
to empty your magazine and withdraw for a reload.

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:07.840
Surviving the reload is the second most important task for the AMX 50 B.

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:12.680
The most important one is finding a way to hide the huge hull.

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.870
Later in the battle, when you get a feel for the locations

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:20.520
of the enemy vehicles, the AMX 50 B becomes a hunter.

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:24.760
It tracks down targets, lures them out, and destroys them with confidence.

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:30.640
The thing to remember is keeping an eye on the mini-map to avoid being cornered.

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:34.210
My rival, we meet at last!

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:35.890
Why isn't he shooting?

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:39.020
He must be reloading, like me.

00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:43.530
Ok, let's do it, one by one.

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.620
Hit me! Do it! Come on, tough guy, hit me!

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:50.340
Show me what you've got!

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:54.940
Is that the best you can do?

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:57.150
THIS is how you hit!

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.570
Good luck on the battlefield!
