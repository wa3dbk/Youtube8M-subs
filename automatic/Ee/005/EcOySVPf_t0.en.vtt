chamber here which is seven display by
nine<00:00:23.130> this<00:00:23.460> way<00:00:23.670> and<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.210> height<00:00:24.390> doesn't

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
nine this way and the height doesn't

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:38.830 
so I chamber so start with dealing this

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:41.670 
so I chamber so start with dealing this
out<00:00:39.070> you'll<00:00:39.430> have<00:00:39.460> to<00:00:39.580> do<00:00:39.760> this<00:00:39.880> outside<00:00:40.680> will

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:41.680 
out you'll have to do this outside will

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:43.320 
out you'll have to do this outside will
start<00:00:42.010> like<00:00:42.160> that<00:00:42.340> with<00:00:42.489> you<00:00:42.610> into<00:00:42.850> a<00:00:42.880> put

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:43.330 
start like that with you into a put

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.390 
start like that with you into a put
spawner<00:00:43.690> and<00:00:43.960> you<00:00:44.680> have<00:00:44.800> to<00:00:44.890> do<00:00:45.040> that<00:00:45.220> one

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:45.400 
spawner and you have to do that one

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.390 
spawner and you have to do that one
layer<00:00:45.580> down<00:00:46.350> that<00:00:47.350> is<00:00:47.500> so<00:00:47.680> you<00:00:47.739> can<00:00:47.980> flow<00:00:48.250> the

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:48.400 
layer down that is so you can flow the

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.160 
layer down that is so you can flow the
water<00:00:48.520> underneath<00:00:48.940> start<00:00:49.780> with<00:00:49.870> it<00:00:49.960> looks

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:57.220 
the seven sided one here we're running

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:00.000 
the seven sided one here we're running
the<00:00:57.280> water<00:00:57.430> from<00:00:58.110> put<00:00:59.110> in<00:00:59.199> water<00:00:59.350> every<00:00:59.680> second

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
the water from put in water every second

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.250 
the water from put in water every second
one<00:01:00.100> until<00:01:00.430> gives<00:01:01.300> you<00:01:01.390> a<00:01:01.420> perfect<00:01:01.629> flow<00:01:02.019> right

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 
one until gives you a perfect flow right

one until gives you a perfect flow right
down<00:01:02.290> to<00:01:02.530> the<00:01:02.649> end<00:01:02.800> and<00:01:03.270> from<00:01:04.270> there<00:01:04.479> you<00:01:04.690> will

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:04.809 
down to the end and from there you will

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:09.690 
down to the end and from there you will
get<00:01:05.490> one<00:01:06.490> extra<00:01:06.729> area<00:01:08.009> that's<00:01:09.009> exactly<00:01:09.520> what

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:20.270 

training<00:01:13.439> in<00:01:13.560> a<00:01:13.619> run<00:01:13.770> through<00:01:13.920> there

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.340 

okay

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:23.350

you<00:01:23.740> guys<00:01:24.010> are<00:01:24.189> now<00:01:24.340> the<00:01:24.400> chamber<00:01:24.909> there<00:01:25.119> ends

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
you guys are now the chamber there ends

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.350 
you guys are now the chamber there ends
and<00:01:27.100> you<00:01:27.549> can<00:01:27.729> fortune

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 
and you can fortune

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.590 
and you can fortune
bla<00:01:30.350> bla<00:01:30.380> I<00:01:30.590> should<00:01:31.010> be<00:01:31.130> up<00:01:31.580> there

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.710 

so<00:01:35.260> you<00:01:35.320> dig<00:01:35.560> back<00:01:35.740> three<00:01:36.070> I<00:01:36.580> believe<00:01:37.240> it's

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720 
so you dig back three I believe it's

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:43.080 
so you dig back three I believe it's
right

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110 
should flow up the end and stay amount

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.980 
should flow up the end and stay amount
of<00:01:47.229> government<00:01:47.920> all<00:01:48.040> won't<00:01:48.250> occur<00:01:48.990> that's

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
of government all won't occur that's

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:51.730 
of government all won't occur that's
right

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 
right

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.380 
right
and<00:01:51.799> then<00:01:51.920> here<00:01:52.490> you<00:01:52.880> need<00:01:53.060> a<00:01:53.090> place<00:01:53.360> to

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
and then here you need a place to

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.020 
and then here you need a place to
collect<00:01:53.720> your<00:01:53.930> drops<00:01:54.820> okay<00:01:55.820> it's

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
collect your drops okay it's

conventional<00:01:56.360> done<00:01:56.990> now

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:01.929 

get<00:02:00.659> rid<00:02:00.780> of<00:02:00.810> all<00:02:00.899> these<00:02:01.049> tortures<00:02:01.530> in<00:02:01.710> the

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:01.939 
get rid of all these tortures in the

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:03.889 
get rid of all these tortures in the
spawning<00:02:02.939> chamber<00:02:03.329> which<00:02:03.420> might<00:02:03.630> make<00:02:03.750> it

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
spawning chamber which might make it

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.980 
spawning chamber which might make it
harder<00:02:04.200> you<00:02:04.289> go<00:02:04.380> to<00:02:04.439> see<00:02:04.740> much

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
harder you go to see much

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:07.960 
harder you go to see much
just<00:02:06.829> listen<00:02:07.070> my<00:02:07.159> voice<00:02:07.340> we'll<00:02:07.670> see<00:02:07.850> what

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
just listen my voice we'll see what

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:16.330 
just listen my voice we'll see what
happens

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.000 

as<00:02:16.459> I<00:02:16.520> sorted<00:02:16.940> out<00:02:17.090> because<00:02:17.270> of<00:02:17.750> this<00:02:17.930> money

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
as I sorted out because of this money

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:25.990 
as I sorted out because of this money
so<00:02:19.370> delete<00:02:19.730> that<00:02:19.879> that<00:02:20.599> way

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.100 

as<00:02:27.000> you<00:02:27.180> can<00:02:27.270> see<00:02:27.420> you<00:02:27.540> get<00:02:27.690> dropped<00:02:27.900> through

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110 
as you can see you get dropped through

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:46.050 
as you can see you get dropped through
there<00:02:28.700> do<00:02:29.700> is<00:02:30.120> just<00:02:30.330> stick<00:02:30.480> tricky

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.270 

so<00:02:46.630> this<00:02:47.050> is<00:02:47.200> exactly<00:02:47.590> where<00:02:47.770> the<00:02:47.800> audit<00:02:48.069> again

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
so this is exactly where the audit again

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:56.480 
so this is exactly where the audit again
Durante<00:02:48.670> can<00:02:48.819> just<00:02:48.970> make<00:02:49.120> a<00:02:50.220> typo

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.490 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:21.699 

blathers<00:02:57.490> I<00:02:57.700> guess
