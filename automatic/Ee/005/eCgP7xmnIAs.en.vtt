00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.700
 the captain lucas wolves from the team 

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:07.160
 tiger gently wants to sit down already in 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.650
 santos lagoon, a rival of which stands out 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:12.530
 the offensive characteristics especially 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.929
 that he has to be able to attack the box 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:17.700
 feline in this case in the day number 

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:20.550
 6 of Mexican soccer 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:23.040
 then you have quick blocks up with 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.410
 the sides so you have to be there 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:28.200
 watch out for the bands that are 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.820
 players quickie lucas lobos knows about 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.650
 the petition that was made in the region 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.200
 so that the people supporting the saint 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.059
 lagoon can cram its bleachers and 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.910
 avoid a feline invasion however 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.370
 for wolves that could not be factor in 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.829
 at a given moment those who go too 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.469
 can you support team is 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.100
 it's normal that how good that is 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.200
 do not want 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:53.820
 that I do not want that 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:56.829
 that people go not from here so 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:00.820
 they are in their right 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:02.739
 to his people who also support despite 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.720
 that the match was on Saturday and it 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:07.479
 he celebrated as well he mentioned it lucas 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.580
 wolves there is still some emotion in the 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:12.009
 words of the Argentine when remembering the 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.920
 triumph and the celebration that he had of his goal 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:19.020
 in the duel before monterrey the relief 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.020
 from me 

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:26.660
 that that goal needed him so 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.660
 that nothing made me very happy and 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:34.640
 to be able to celebrate it and he got a 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:37.450
 little bit of fury not like I said in the week 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.170
 previous matches were given means 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:43.240
 boring because 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:46.360
 but one of them is a team that 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.850
 that do not let you play and back out 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.920
 then it does not go out to play it does not come out 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.409
 to 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:56.430
 so that's why I said it but 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:58.189
 good luckily came out xavi to play a 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:01.110
 entertaining party so let's wait 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:02.399
 it's good that the classics are still 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.960
 so emotive 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.960
