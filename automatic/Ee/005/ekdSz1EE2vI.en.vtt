00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.959 

it's<00:00:40.510> like<00:00:40.659> Gus<00:00:41.140> coming<00:00:41.620> in<00:00:41.769> here<00:00:42.069> not<00:00:42.519> too<00:00:42.729> bad

00:00:42.959 --> 00:00:42.969 
it's like Gus coming in here not too bad

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:46.919
