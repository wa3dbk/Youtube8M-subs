 in Ukrainian Mariupol clearing the street 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.340
 broken glass reminds of shelling 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.440
 who happened a few days ago 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.330
 blame clashes intensified on 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.130
 Eastern Ukraine, President of Russia 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.029
 Vladimir Putin laid on Monday 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.230
 blame west is a foreign legion in 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.890
 In this case, the foreign NATO 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:26.240
 legion which of course does not pursue 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:29.960
 goals of national interests of Ukraine 

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:32.669
 there are very different goals they are connected with 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.130
 achieving geopolitical goals 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.149
 Russia's deterrence general response 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.160
 nato secretary 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.980
 jens stoltenberg did not force himself 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.680
 wait until it is man and the rice 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.539
 a legend in ukraine is now since 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.360
 statement that in Ukraine there 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:51.000
 legion then this is nonsense there is no legion 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.930
 NATO foreign troops in Ukraine came 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.910
 I ask from Russia 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:59.100
 NATO and the United States accuse Russia of delivery 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.899
 separatists advanced technology including 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.000
 missile systems tanks heavy 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.489
 artillery and electronic systems 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.479
 wrestling one high ranking 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.880
 a US official said to the voice 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.799
 America that Russia according to him without 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.530
 conscience implants people and 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:16.110
 the technique is just enough to prevent 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.090
 stabilization but it is likely in Ukraine 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.159
 the whole of us will be the new answer 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:25.259
 economic sanctions says the minister 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:27.450
 us finance jack we have 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.520
 additional tools I will not them 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.070
 today to list but we have them 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.240
 Lew says that Russia has already suffered from 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.130
 some sanctions which 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.259
 developed very carefully and now 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.750
 impose a heavy burden on the Russian 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.880
 economy but democrat senator christopher 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.310
 Murphy says only sanctions are more 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.280
 not enough win break off myself 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.170
 significa but also i think that now we 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.820
 need to put a significant amount 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.829
 defensive weapons Ukrainian 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.899
 the military home came the moment when they 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:57.060
 can take advantage of this technology 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:00.580
 I hope that this will be part of the discussion in 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:04.600
 coming weeks and months kashina 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:06.430

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.410
 to work with the Ukrainian military 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.869
 also equipment requests ukraine 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.200
 supplies of lethal assistance remain without 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:13.200
 answer
