00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.170 
this is actually like you know a
thumbnail<00:01:19.710> /<00:01:20.100> loading<00:01:20.490> screen<00:01:20.700> kind<00:01:20.970> of<00:01:21.030> thing

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
thumbnail / loading screen kind of thing

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.350 
thumbnail / loading screen kind of thing
is<00:01:21.330> that<00:01:21.900> it's<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.140> exact<00:01:22.500> same<00:01:22.530> size<00:01:23.220> as<00:01:23.729> most

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
is that it's the exact same size as most

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.789 
is that it's the exact same size as most
of<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.570> other<00:01:24.780> thumbnails<00:01:25.290> in<00:01:25.500> the<00:01:25.590> game

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
of the other thumbnails in the game

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.230 
of the other thumbnails in the game
which<00:01:26.070> makes<00:01:26.310> you<00:01:26.430> wonder<00:01:26.610> hey<00:01:26.970> that's

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
which makes you wonder hey that's

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.149 
which makes you wonder hey that's
probably<00:01:27.930> a<00:01:28.049> thumbnail<00:01:28.470> or<00:01:28.530> a<00:01:28.740> loading<00:01:29.130> screen

all<00:01:40.259> that<00:01:40.500> jazz<00:01:40.650> but<00:01:40.710> it<00:01:41.009> came<00:01:41.189> with<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.460> idea

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
all that jazz but it came with the idea

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.819 
all that jazz but it came with the idea
of<00:01:41.880> a<00:01:42.060> race<00:01:42.420> now<00:01:43.079> if<00:01:43.229> you<00:01:43.290> guys<00:01:43.409> look<00:01:43.649> at<00:01:43.740> the

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
of a race now if you guys look at the

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.859 
of a race now if you guys look at the
picture<00:01:44.250> closely<00:01:45.119> enough<00:01:45.270> you'll<00:01:45.479> see<00:01:45.689> that

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
picture closely enough you'll see that

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.590 
picture closely enough you'll see that
almost<00:01:46.590> it<00:01:46.770> looks<00:01:46.950> like<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.820> path<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.420> road

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
almost it looks like the path the road

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.450 
almost it looks like the path the road
almost<00:01:48.899> is<00:01:49.110> divided<00:01:49.560> into<00:01:49.649> two<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:50.100> I<00:01:50.189> kind<00:01:50.399> of

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
almost is divided into two and I kind of

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.249 
almost is divided into two and I kind of
have<00:01:50.579> like<00:01:50.610> directional<00:01:51.329> arrows<00:01:51.659> pointing<00:01:52.170> to

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
have like directional arrows pointing to

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.620 
have like directional arrows pointing to
which<00:01:52.380> way<00:01:52.649> so<00:01:53.250> what<00:01:53.399> I'm<00:01:53.490> thinking<00:01:53.520> is<00:01:54.000> meet

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
which way so what I'm thinking is meet

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:55.910 
which way so what I'm thinking is meet
on<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.869> tarmac<00:01:55.140> is<00:01:55.439> both<00:01:55.590> going<00:01:55.770> to<00:01:55.799> be<00:01:55.860> a

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
on the tarmac is both going to be a

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.709 
on the tarmac is both going to be a
survival<00:01:56.340> map<00:01:56.640> but<00:01:57.000> also<00:01:57.210> is<00:01:57.420> going<00:01:57.600> to<00:01:57.659> be

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
survival map but also is going to be

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.959 
survival map but also is going to be
special<00:01:58.170> for<00:01:58.200> race<00:01:58.590> now<00:01:59.189> basically<00:01:59.490> what<00:01:59.759> race

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
special for race now basically what race

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.880 
special for race now basically what race
is<00:02:00.000> what<00:02:00.960> I'm<00:02:01.049> guessing<00:02:01.409> it's<00:02:01.530> kind<00:02:01.740> of<00:02:01.770> like

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
is what I'm guessing it's kind of like

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.859 
is what I'm guessing it's kind of like
34<00:02:02.520> before<00:02:02.909> you're<00:02:03.060> going<00:02:03.270> but<00:02:03.420> everybody's

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
34 before you're going but everybody's

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.319 
34 before you're going but everybody's
going<00:02:04.049> to<00:02:04.140> have<00:02:04.259> their<00:02:04.439> own<00:02:04.469> bus<00:02:04.860> and<00:02:05.159> my<00:02:06.000> idea

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
going to have their own bus and my idea

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:07.789 
going to have their own bus and my idea
is<00:02:06.540> you<00:02:06.689> got<00:02:06.780> to<00:02:06.869> try<00:02:07.020> and<00:02:07.140> keep<00:02:07.259> zombies<00:02:07.680> off

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
is you got to try and keep zombies off

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.589 
is you got to try and keep zombies off
the<00:02:07.920> bus<00:02:08.099> or<00:02:08.369> else<00:02:08.520> it'll<00:02:08.729> slow<00:02:08.970> you<00:02:09.030> down<00:02:09.300> kind

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
the bus or else it'll slow you down kind

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:10.760 
the bus or else it'll slow you down kind
of<00:02:09.660> thing<00:02:09.810> or<00:02:09.989> you<00:02:10.080> might<00:02:10.200> be<00:02:10.349> able<00:02:10.440> to<00:02:10.560> pick<00:02:10.709> up

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
of thing or you might be able to pick up

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.290 
of thing or you might be able to pick up
like<00:02:11.099> parts<00:02:11.730> and<00:02:11.879> build<00:02:12.030> onto<00:02:12.270> your<00:02:12.510> bus

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300 
like parts and build onto your bus

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.150 
like parts and build onto your bus
because<00:02:13.840> you<00:02:13.930> know<00:02:14.050> that's<00:02:14.230> all<00:02:14.380> added<00:02:14.770> in<00:02:14.890> and

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
because you know that's all added in and

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.770 
because you know that's all added in and
you<00:02:15.280> might<00:02:15.490> be<00:02:15.700> able<00:02:15.850> to<00:02:15.970> attach<00:02:16.360> like<00:02:16.630> an

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
you might be able to attach like an

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.510 
you might be able to attach like an
engine<00:02:17.200> upgrade<00:02:17.560> that<00:02:17.800> kind<00:02:17.980> of<00:02:18.040> jazz<00:02:18.250> and

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
engine upgrade that kind of jazz and

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.220 
engine upgrade that kind of jazz and
basically<00:02:19.240> whoever<00:02:19.450> makes<00:02:19.720> it<00:02:19.870> to<00:02:19.990> the<00:02:20.050> end

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
basically whoever makes it to the end

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:21.960 
basically whoever makes it to the end
wins<00:02:20.440> kind<00:02:20.770> of<00:02:20.830> thing<00:02:20.980> or<00:02:21.160> survives<00:02:21.820> the

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
wins kind of thing or survives the

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.880 
wins kind of thing or survives the
longest<00:02:22.360> and<00:02:22.930> it<00:02:23.050> kind<00:02:23.230> of<00:02:23.260> made<00:02:23.410> me<00:02:23.440> thought

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
longest and it kind of made me thought

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.050 
longest and it kind of made me thought
start<00:02:24.190> to<00:02:24.280> think<00:02:24.430> that<00:02:24.610> this<00:02:24.760> could<00:02:24.820> be

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
start to think that this could be

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.610 
start to think that this could be
actually<00:02:25.390> a<00:02:25.420> very<00:02:25.600> viable<00:02:25.930> game<00:02:26.260> mode<00:02:26.440> because

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
actually a very viable game mode because

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.680 
actually a very viable game mode because
actually<00:02:27.100> if<00:02:27.160> you<00:02:27.250> look<00:02:27.280> in<00:02:27.490> the<00:02:27.580> tunnel<00:02:28.030> on

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:28.690 
actually if you look in the tunnel on

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.540 
actually if you look in the tunnel on
transit<00:02:29.260> it's<00:02:29.410> basically<00:02:29.650> it's<00:02:29.890> it's<00:02:30.130> a<00:02:30.250> 2

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:30.550 
transit it's basically it's it's a 2

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:32.490 
transit it's basically it's it's a 2
it's<00:02:30.940> 2<00:02:31.060> part<00:02:31.450> highway<00:02:31.780> and<00:02:32.020> you<00:02:32.350> can

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
it's 2 part highway and you can

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:33.780 
it's 2 part highway and you can
basically<00:02:32.650> just<00:02:32.890> clear<00:02:33.130> the<00:02:33.280> debris<00:02:33.400> and<00:02:33.700> you

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
basically just clear the debris and you

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.200 
basically just clear the debris and you
would<00:02:33.910> have<00:02:34.030> a<00:02:34.090> nice<00:02:34.840> simple<00:02:35.250> roadway<00:02:36.250> so<00:02:36.880> what

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:37.210 
would have a nice simple roadway so what

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:38.550 
would have a nice simple roadway so what
you<00:02:37.390> might<00:02:37.660> be<00:02:37.780> seeing<00:02:38.050> with<00:02:38.200> meat<00:02:38.350> on<00:02:38.470> the

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:38.560 
you might be seeing with meat on the

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.500 
you might be seeing with meat on the
tarmac<00:02:38.800> is<00:02:39.160> it<00:02:39.370> might<00:02:39.520> be<00:02:39.640> actually<00:02:39.820> transit

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
tarmac is it might be actually transit

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.200 
tarmac is it might be actually transit
what<00:02:40.630> it<00:02:40.720> is<00:02:40.840> now<00:02:41.050> except<00:02:42.210> re-worked

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:43.210 
what it is now except re-worked

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:46.650 
what it is now except re-worked
basically<00:02:43.930> everything's<00:02:44.410> not<00:02:44.770> really<00:02:45.660> kind

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
basically everything's not really kind

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.480 
basically everything's not really kind
of<00:02:46.750> destroyed<00:02:47.110> is<00:02:47.260> actually<00:02:47.620> like<00:02:47.800> kind<00:02:48.400> of

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
of destroyed is actually like kind of

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:50.310 
of destroyed is actually like kind of
comedy<00:02:48.910> like<00:02:49.510> almost<00:02:49.900> where<00:02:50.110> you<00:02:50.170> have<00:02:50.290> all

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:50.320 
comedy like almost where you have all

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:52.470 
comedy like almost where you have all
the<00:02:50.560> signs<00:02:50.800> saying<00:02:51.100> oh<00:02:51.250> brains<00:02:51.670> come<00:02:52.090> get<00:02:52.330> your

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
the signs saying oh brains come get your

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.720 
the signs saying oh brains come get your
brains<00:02:52.690> all<00:02:52.930> that<00:02:53.110> kind<00:02:53.320> of<00:02:53.410> jazz<00:02:53.470> and<00:02:53.830> like

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
brains all that kind of jazz and like

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.730 
brains all that kind of jazz and like
you<00:02:54.880> would<00:02:55.030> see<00:02:55.180> like<00:02:55.390> more<00:02:55.630> of<00:02:55.660> the<00:02:55.780> map<00:02:55.990> kind

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:56.740 
you would see like more of the map kind

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.200 
you would see like more of the map kind
of<00:02:56.770> like<00:02:56.890> that<00:02:56.980> with<00:02:57.130> a<00:02:57.160> bunch<00:02:57.550> of<00:02:57.670> neon<00:02:57.940> signs

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:58.210 
of like that with a bunch of neon signs

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:00.090 
of like that with a bunch of neon signs
about<00:02:58.510> a<00:02:58.570> bunch<00:02:59.020> of<00:02:59.140> random<00:02:59.530> stuff<00:02:59.740> more<00:03:00.040> or

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
about a bunch of random stuff more or

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:02.160 
about a bunch of random stuff more or
less<00:03:00.250> because<00:03:00.400> the<00:03:01.240> thumbnail<00:03:01.630> people<00:03:01.960> close

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:02.170 
less because the thumbnail people close

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:03.780 
less because the thumbnail people close
enough<00:03:02.410> it<00:03:02.530> is<00:03:02.650> of<00:03:02.860> town<00:03:03.160> and<00:03:03.520> you<00:03:03.670> can

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
enough it is of town and you can

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:04.770 
enough it is of town and you can
actually<00:03:03.940> see<00:03:04.090> the<00:03:04.330> church<00:03:04.570> in<00:03:04.690> the

release of it soon I'm guessing that

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.820 
release of it soon I'm guessing that
might<00:03:13.270> be<00:03:13.420> part<00:03:13.570> of<00:03:13.630> the<00:03:13.720> first<00:03:13.960> DLC<00:03:14.500> it<00:03:14.620> might

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:16.590 
might be part of the first DLC it might
be<00:03:14.950> an<00:03:15.040> addition<00:03:15.520> kind<00:03:15.730> of<00:03:15.790> thing<00:03:15.940> which<00:03:16.390> would

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
be an addition kind of thing which would

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.470 
be an addition kind of thing which would

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
how it looks now but it'd be interesting

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:25.530 
how it looks now but it'd be interesting
to<00:03:24.100> see<00:03:24.250> how<00:03:24.280> it<00:03:24.400> would<00:03:24.489> look<00:03:24.550> like<00:03:24.700> with<00:03:25.360> that

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
to see how it would look like with that

containment<00:03:31.540> now<00:03:32.350> containment<00:03:33.040> was<00:03:33.190> listed

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
containment now containment was listed

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.660 
containment now containment was listed
with<00:03:33.850> Terese<00:03:34.239> and<00:03:34.540> knocked<00:03:34.810> and<00:03:35.080> basically

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
with Terese and knocked and basically

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.470 
with Terese and knocked and basically
containment<00:03:36.670> what<00:03:36.790> I'm<00:03:36.880> thinking<00:03:37.180> is<00:03:37.270> is

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
containment what I'm thinking is is

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.100 
containment what I'm thinking is is
another<00:03:37.780> 4v4<00:03:38.739> kind<00:03:39.160> of<00:03:39.280> deal<00:03:39.580> except<00:03:40.420> I<00:03:40.570> really

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
another 4v4 kind of deal except I really

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:42.900 
another 4v4 kind of deal except I really
don't<00:03:41.290> know<00:03:41.440> how<00:03:41.590> it's<00:03:41.739> gonna<00:03:41.830> work<00:03:41.950> when<00:03:42.880> I

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
don't know how it's gonna work when I

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.699 
don't know how it's gonna work when I
think<00:03:43.150> of<00:03:43.209> containment<00:03:43.630> I<00:03:43.930> think<00:03:44.200> of<00:03:44.380> you<00:03:44.590> know

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:44.709 
think of containment I think of you know

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:46.410 
think of containment I think of you know
trying<00:03:44.770> to<00:03:45.100> hold<00:03:45.340> zombies<00:03:45.820> back<00:03:46.030> from<00:03:46.360> a

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
would be interesting to see but I'm

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.790 
would be interesting to see but I'm
really<00:04:22.330> I<00:04:22.450> don't<00:04:22.780> know<00:04:22.930> how<00:04:23.200> else<00:04:23.229> that<00:04:23.650> could

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
really I don't know how else that could

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.159 
really I don't know how else that could
work<00:04:23.979> um<00:04:24.250> you<00:04:25.000> may<00:04:25.150> be<00:04:25.210> seeing<00:04:25.510> that<00:04:25.690> one<00:04:25.900> teams

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:26.169 
work um you may be seeing that one teams

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:26.730 
work um you may be seeing that one teams
in<00:04:26.380> fact

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
in fact

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.589 
in fact
day<00:04:26.860> the<00:04:27.130> other<00:04:27.220> teams<00:04:27.520> non-factor<00:04:28.330> you<00:04:28.419> try

00:04:28.589 --> 00:04:28.599 
day the other teams non-factor you try

00:04:28.599 --> 00:04:30.540 
day the other teams non-factor you try
and<00:04:28.720> have<00:04:28.840> to<00:04:28.960> basically<00:04:29.620> can<00:04:29.949> become<00:04:30.310> one<00:04:30.520> of

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
and have to basically can become one of

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.219 
and have to basically can become one of
the<00:04:30.669> zombies<00:04:31.090> that<00:04:31.270> would<00:04:31.449> be<00:04:31.599> that'd<00:04:32.110> be

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:32.229 
the zombies that would be that'd be

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:33.659 
the zombies that would be that'd be
interesting<00:04:32.349> to<00:04:32.889> but<00:04:33.099> I<00:04:33.130> really<00:04:33.430> don't<00:04:33.580> know

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:33.669 
interesting to but I really don't know

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:35.490 
interesting to but I really don't know
how<00:04:34.030> that<00:04:34.300> would<00:04:34.419> work<00:04:34.479> on<00:04:34.780> der<00:04:34.960> riese<00:04:35.139> or<00:04:35.319> not

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.500 
how that would work on der riese or not

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.309 
how that would work on der riese or not
but<00:04:36.220> I<00:04:36.370> my<00:04:36.430> welder<00:04:37.120> ISA<00:04:37.300> could<00:04:37.569> work<00:04:37.780> knocked

00:04:38.309 --> 00:04:38.319 
but I my welder ISA could work knocked
