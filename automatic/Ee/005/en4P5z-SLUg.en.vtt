00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
war zone compared to say like a banshee

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.940 
war zone compared to say like a banshee
like<00:01:57.659> a<00:01:57.750> rocket<00:01:58.200> launch<00:01:58.380> so<00:01:58.619> there's<00:01:58.770> a<00:01:58.829> little

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
like a rocket launch so there's a little

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.530 
like a rocket launch so there's a little
bit<00:01:59.100> of<00:01:59.189> a<00:01:59.280> balance<00:01:59.670> there<00:01:59.790> because<00:02:00.390> in

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
bit of a balance there because in

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.289 
bit of a balance there because in
