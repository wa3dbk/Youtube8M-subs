00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
three slabs like this and then we're

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.120 
three slabs like this and then we're
going<00:01:46.079> to<00:01:46.170> do<00:01:46.290> where<00:01:46.530> you've<00:01:46.649> got<00:01:46.799> your<00:01:46.920> stair

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
going to do where you've got your stair

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.800 
going to do where you've got your stair
you<00:01:47.220> going<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.399> bring<00:01:47.549> slabs<00:01:47.909> across<00:01:48.060> to<00:01:48.630> join

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
you going to bring slabs across to join

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.120 
you going to bring slabs across to join
those<00:01:48.960> two<00:01:49.259> and<00:01:49.439> behind<00:01:49.710> this<00:01:49.890> you<00:01:50.040> know

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
those two and behind this you know

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.840 
those two and behind this you know
putting<00:01:50.340> free<00:01:50.810> sandstone<00:01:51.810> stairs<00:01:52.140> like<00:01:52.500> this

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850 
putting free sandstone stairs like this

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.710 
putting free sandstone stairs like this
then<00:01:53.850> we're<00:01:53.970> going<00:01:54.119> to<00:01:54.210> do<00:01:54.299> is<00:01:54.450> we're<00:01:54.570> going<00:01:54.600> to

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
then we're going to do is we're going to

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.469 
then we're going to do is we're going to
build<00:01:54.899> up<00:01:55.079> the<00:01:55.290> turret<00:01:55.619> itself<00:01:56.360> so<00:01:57.360> it's

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
build up the turret itself so it's

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:58.880 
build up the turret itself so it's
probably<00:01:57.689> best<00:01:57.840> to<00:01:57.930> build<00:01:58.110> it<00:01:58.259> off<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.710> back

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
probably best to build it off the back

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.370 
probably best to build it off the back
going<00:01:59.880> to<00:01:59.969> leave<00:02:00.090> this<00:02:00.270> block<00:02:00.509> here<00:02:00.750> have<00:02:01.229> this

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
going to leave this block here have this

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.709 
going to leave this block here have this
one<00:02:01.530> coming<00:02:01.740> here<00:02:02.009> get<00:02:02.189> one<00:02:02.399> two<00:02:02.759> three<00:02:03.509> and

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
one coming here get one two three and

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.030 
one coming here get one two three and
then<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:03.990> fourth<00:02:04.229> one<00:02:04.469> you<00:02:04.500> get<00:02:04.649> a<00:02:04.710> wraparound

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
then the fourth one you get a wraparound

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.370 
then the fourth one you get a wraparound
should<00:02:05.490> be<00:02:05.610> overhanging<00:02:06.000> just<00:02:06.299> by<00:02:06.390> one<00:02:06.600> I'm

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
should be overhanging just by one I'm

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.650 
should be overhanging just by one I'm
putting<00:02:07.649> a<00:02:07.680> full<00:02:07.829> block<00:02:08.009> here<00:02:08.390> and<00:02:09.390> this<00:02:09.509> one's

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
putting a full block here and this one's

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:10.760 
putting a full block here and this one's
going<00:02:09.750> to<00:02:09.810> wrap<00:02:09.989> around<00:02:10.020> as<00:02:10.319> well<00:02:10.440> so<00:02:10.590> you<00:02:10.679> got

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:10.770 
going to wrap around as well so you got

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.870 
going to wrap around as well so you got
one<00:02:10.950> two<00:02:10.979> three<00:02:11.879> and<00:02:12.300> four

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
one two three and four

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.940 
one two three and four
just<00:02:13.690> like<00:02:13.840> this<00:02:13.990> and<00:02:14.050> wrap<00:02:14.470> it<00:02:14.620> around<00:02:14.710> the

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
just like this and wrap it around the

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.150 
just like this and wrap it around the
back<00:02:15.360> like<00:02:16.360> that<00:02:16.570> so<00:02:16.840> it's<00:02:17.740> up<00:02:17.830> to<00:02:17.950> you<00:02:18.040> where

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
back like that so it's up to you where

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.530 
back like that so it's up to you where
you<00:02:18.250> want<00:02:18.400> to<00:02:18.430> put<00:02:18.640> in<00:02:18.730> the<00:02:18.790> trapdoor<00:02:19.150> I<00:02:19.300> put<00:02:19.480> it

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
you want to put in the trapdoor I put it

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:20.340 
you want to put in the trapdoor I put it
in<00:02:19.600> the<00:02:19.660> front<00:02:19.870> because<00:02:20.050> you've<00:02:20.170> got<00:02:20.260> this

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:20.350 
in the front because you've got this

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.860 
in the front because you've got this
kind<00:02:20.560> of<00:02:20.590> side<00:02:20.830> gun<00:02:21.070> in<00:02:21.220> here<00:02:21.550> I<00:02:21.760> sit<00:02:22.510> put<00:02:22.720> that

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
kind of side gun in here I sit put that

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.310 
kind of side gun in here I sit put that

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
in here this and I put a slab on slab

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.280 
in here this and I put a slab on slab
over<00:02:26.830> there<00:02:27.070> just<00:02:27.700> like<00:02:27.880> that<00:02:28.080> and<00:02:29.080> come

forwards five with your stone slabs one

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.960 
forwards five with your stone slabs one
two<00:02:31.390> three<00:02:31.720> four<00:02:31.990> five<00:02:32.520> now<00:02:33.520> for<00:02:33.700> your<00:02:33.760> gun

itself<00:02:34.300> what<00:02:34.540> you'll<00:02:34.660> need<00:02:34.810> is<00:02:35.050> a<00:02:35.350> fence<00:02:35.620> and

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
itself what you'll need is a fence and

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.530 
itself what you'll need is a fence and
fence<00:02:36.070> gate<00:02:36.340> nice<00:02:36.550> place<00:02:36.820> it<00:02:36.940> on<00:02:37.030> this<00:02:37.210> part

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
fence gate nice place it on this part

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.930 
fence gate nice place it on this part
here<00:02:37.840> so<00:02:38.680> a<00:02:38.740> piece<00:02:38.890> of<00:02:39.040> fence<00:02:39.280> I<00:02:39.550> don't<00:02:39.790> have<00:02:39.910> a

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
here so a piece of fence I don't have a

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.990 
here so a piece of fence I don't have a
fence<00:02:40.210> gate<00:02:40.450> joining<00:02:40.750> on<00:02:41.490> and<00:02:42.490> I'm<00:02:42.640> pretty

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
fence gate joining on and I'm pretty

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.740 
fence gate joining on and I'm pretty
much<00:02:43.360> what<00:02:44.260> always<00:02:44.590> completes<00:02:45.010> it<00:02:45.360> so<00:02:46.360> on<00:02:46.600> the

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
much what always completes it so on the

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.360 
much what always completes it so on the
back<00:02:46.900> three<00:02:47.470> here<00:02:47.710> you<00:02:47.770> going<00:02:47.890> to<00:02:47.950> place<00:02:48.190> down

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:48.370 
back three here you going to place down

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.250 
back three here you going to place down
three<00:02:48.700> slabs<00:02:48.970> and<00:02:49.300> then<00:02:49.450> on<00:02:49.540> top<00:02:49.720> of<00:02:49.870> that<00:02:49.960> free

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
three slabs and then on top of that free

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.790 
three slabs and then on top of that free
slabs<00:02:50.560> so<00:02:51.400> this<00:02:51.970> is<00:02:52.120> this<00:02:52.270> kind<00:02:52.480> of<00:02:52.510> back<00:02:53.410> part

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:53.800 
slabs so this is this kind of back part

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.650 
slabs so this is this kind of back part
onto<00:02:54.130> it<00:02:54.250> I'm<00:02:54.370> not<00:02:54.610> too<00:02:54.760> sure<00:02:54.940> what<00:02:55.210> it<00:02:55.300> is<00:02:55.330> but

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:55.660 
onto it I'm not too sure what it is but

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.080 
onto it I'm not too sure what it is but
it's<00:02:55.900> on<00:02:56.020> the<00:02:56.110> back<00:02:56.260> of<00:02:56.290> it<00:02:56.700> so<00:02:57.700> hopefully<00:02:57.790> you

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
it's on the back of it so hopefully you

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:00.090 
it's on the back of it so hopefully you
guys<00:02:58.210> enjoyed<00:02:58.480> this<00:02:58.840> build<00:02:59.170> if<00:02:59.410> you<00:02:59.500> have<00:02:59.740> make
