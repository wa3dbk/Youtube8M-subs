00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:11.180
 hello hello what happens chaves that such as 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:13.010
 we are come so today we go with another 

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:14.900
 building is worth seeing a little 

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:17.090
 features how to level up and 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:20.620
 such in this case is going to be the workshop 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:24.610
 comic ok come 

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:27.970
 this mainly I do not advise 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:30.040
 as an essential building is going to 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.080
 read more now when you already have everything 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:34.780
 you give others you can try to make yourself 

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:37.120
 this one did not yet find anything that 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.700
 that is vital so to speak it is worth 

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.450
 we're not going to see it a little bit here what 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.450
 we have level 1 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.879
 and there have abysses 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:55.670
 contracts and things all ok come 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.670
 then once we have it at level 1 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.380
 we will have it here so it will tell us how 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.409
 inventions work that will go 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:07.080
 doing several each one a little but 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.409
 doing it if we see it here we have the 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.600
 gauntlet of power tires 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:14.840
 basically every day we can come here 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.650
 to the workshop and in the work tables of the 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.650
 Gnome will have an invention 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.430
 the terminator arm 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:33.130
 move away 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.909
 come, we take it 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.909
 to the east for example 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.050
 the 

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:46.940
 Come and see throw a string rolled up 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:50.380
 your goal what inflicts physical damage 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:52.690
 and attracts him to you that would be 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:55.420
 a chain type 

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:58.250
 time like what they have those from home to 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.690
 see if here 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:03.410
 around here in having enemies 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.410
 I do not think that 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.390
 but I will not be able to catch 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.630
 I come to look for an enemy we go to 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.270
 there 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:14.570
 here we have flowers we are going to catch 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.570
 a 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.010
 Well I do not bring it here because 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.010
 He has directly killed him 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.629
 has two minutes of reuse 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.510
 they are like that said knees now have 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:32.190
 nine charges we expect if you spend them 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.000
 you can go during this same day 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.680
 and get back another ten 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.680
 since we are here I will teach by 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:43.120
 example other other gadgets that create 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.120
 the prototype of fitting it 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:50.390
 culture is a motorcycle it is not a saddle 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:52.550
 does not count as a mount 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.620
 the only peculiarity that has 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:58.180
 example because it has the button button and 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.180
 hector some fighters 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:05.930
 that time to stop 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:07.510
 are more than useful things chorradas 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.879
 example the personal distribution system 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:13.930
 terrify heavens you are not bad at all 

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:17.959
 to reach some areas or leave 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:20.409
 the zones comes well in doubts here you 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:20.409
 throw up 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:27.380
 and now they ride you for the mind of these 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:31.569
 you can not go far enough 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:34.590
 to this within the bad is the subtle 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:38.160
 now let's go down 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:40.110
 come on let's go up to level 2 and 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.410
 calculate more the fall and they are not against 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.410
 soil 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.290
 now thanks or come out to 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.990
 upload it to level 2 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:53.710
 you can or with certain missions we 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:56.800
 will preside over some coins 

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:59.680
 ok ok we can change in ashram 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:02.320
 by level 2 planes or wait for us 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.650
 level 100 where they will give us, let's go 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.640
 they will give we can we can buy 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:09.620
 here 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:12.409
 let's start side of the architect's table 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:14.870
 any level 2 ballet plane through 

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:16.880
 thousand eurillos ok the level 3 are 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:21.109
 blocked because they require require of 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:23.919
 mission we achieve well then we go 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:23.919
 to go up to level 2 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:28.900
 It will cost us 300 golds it will take an hour 

00:04:29.009 --> 00:04:34.370
 here we go to music 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.370
 here we are going to do tricks 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:44.140
 come and we do not have at level 2 we are going to 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.140
 see her 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:55.370
 and now they are much more 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:05:00.040
 drain and I 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:04.889
 at level 2 we won that here the friend 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:06.539
 will begin to manufacture five new objects 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:08.759
 for example right now we are going to 

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:12.319
 take our arm off and see if it gives us 

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:12.319
 another when leveling 

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:20.749
 we have there for your type of mercalli 

00:05:17.899 --> 00:05:22.879
 nothing because he played and at level 2 already 

00:05:20.749 --> 00:05:24.469
 you have seen a little bit come then 

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:28.189
 say for example 8 knees there 

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:31.399
 another one that you keep invoking us we use 

00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:32.929
 invocas you get three cannons worth here 

00:05:31.399 --> 00:05:34.369
 around you 

00:05:32.929 --> 00:05:36.669
 everything that attacks you so that you 

00:05:34.369 --> 00:05:39.739
 attacks those cannons are going to hit me 

00:05:36.669 --> 00:05:41.719
 that just as well if in 

00:05:39.739 --> 00:05:47.080
 certain moments that between is not 

00:05:41.719 --> 00:05:47.080
 one thing that is really useful 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:52.969
 to climb to level 3 

00:05:50.569 --> 00:05:54.800
 once we add them level 3 already here 

00:05:52.969 --> 00:05:56.870
 power we can create a tank of 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.910
 battle once a day 

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:02.450
 which will not serve for missions so 

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:04.490
 that we want the pvp whatever and for 

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:07.430
 can upload it to level 3 we have to 

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:09.360
 complete an achievement worth what it consists of 

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:12.180
 nothing 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:13.770
 It was a day another day another day until 

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:15.479
 we return all the toys these 

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:16.860
 Mark the list with toys 

00:06:15.479 --> 00:06:19.340
 all the inventions that mark us the 

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:23.490
 list and once we've sung all 

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:25.139
 we can buy the level 3 plane 

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:28.120
 to the girl who was here next to 

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:29.920
 the architect's table 

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:31.780
 come on let's give 

00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:33.360
 that do not have 

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:37.819
 so 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:37.819
 we can say that this is this building 

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:45.400
 but it does not take a plane it would cost us 

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:47.170
 400 resources one hour of work and one 

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:48.440
 Once we make the achievement if we would buy it 

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:49.870
 here 

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:51.820
 friendly 

00:06:49.870 --> 00:06:54.370
 by my rollers 

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:58.380
 and little else this would be the non- mystic workshop 

00:06:54.370 --> 00:07:02.830
 ok I'll tell you my opinion a building 

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:04.930
 very secondary is to say that is not 

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:06.569
 I would hurry to do it unless 

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:09.090
 you are a fan of 

00:07:06.569 --> 00:07:11.070
 of the bullshit you're 

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:13.230
 we wait for this category and 

00:07:11.070 --> 00:07:13.889
 buildings that come that come pretty 

00:07:13.230 --> 00:07:17.389
 best 

00:07:13.889 --> 00:07:19.979
 come in anyway I have out there 

00:07:17.389 --> 00:07:23.580
 some image and such of other art of 

00:07:19.979 --> 00:07:26.790
 other gadgets I leave them worth and nothing 

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:28.710
 more than a greeting that we see the 

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:30.810
 next and as I always say if it has 

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:31.830
 liked to the hand and to be at 

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:34.199

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:36.000
 apart from subscribing here below I leave you 

00:07:34.199 --> 00:07:38.850
 the link to the blog where you are going to have 

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.520
 much more information and such are worth come 

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:44.419
 so I said see you later chau
