00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
different sides and somewhere along the

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.810 
different sides and somewhere along the
way<00:01:49.110> I<00:01:49.229> can<00:01:49.560> remember<00:01:49.740> these<00:01:50.070> girls<00:01:50.369> having<00:01:50.729> a

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820

way I can remember these girls having a
match<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.450> I<00:01:52.110> think<00:01:52.320> I'm<00:01:52.470> just<00:01:52.770> sort<00:01:52.979> of

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
match and I think I'm just sort of

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.550 
match and I think I'm just sort of
forgetting<00:01:53.729> that<00:01:53.880> they<00:01:54.060> were<00:01:54.259> feuding<00:01:55.259> and

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
forgetting that they were feuding and

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.990 
forgetting that they were feuding and
just<00:01:55.710> putting<00:01:56.009> them<00:01:56.130> right<00:01:56.159> back<00:01:56.520> together

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
just putting them right back together

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.810 
just putting them right back together
because<00:01:57.420> there<00:01:57.600> was<00:01:57.689> no<00:01:57.869> real<00:01:58.159> no<00:01:59.159> real<00:01:59.399> good

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
because there was no real no real good

great i know that when SummerSlam came
around<00:04:51.460> I<00:04:51.820> thought<00:04:52.030> that<00:04:52.210> Stephanie<00:04:52.780> versus

00:04:53.129 --> 00:04:53.139 
around I thought that Stephanie versus

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:55.379 
around I thought that Stephanie versus
Brie<00:04:53.440> honestly<00:04:54.400> was<00:04:54.550> one<00:04:54.699> of<00:04:54.790> the<00:04:54.880> main<00:04:55.030> event

00:04:55.379 --> 00:04:55.389

matches<00:04:55.630> of<00:04:55.990> the<00:04:56.020> night<00:04:56.260> and<00:04:56.500> I<00:04:56.590> thought<00:04:56.710> it

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:56.889 
matches of the night and I thought it

00:04:56.889 --> 00:04:59.250 
matches of the night and I thought it
really<00:04:57.040> did<00:04:57.340> deliver<00:04:57.669> at<00:04:57.880> the<00:04:58.000> show<00:04:58.240> even<00:04:59.020> when

00:04:59.250 --> 00:04:59.260 
really did deliver at the show even when

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:00.990 
really did deliver at the show even when
Nikki<00:04:59.620> did<00:04:59.830> the<00:04:59.950> heel<00:05:00.220> turn<00:05:00.520> and<00:05:00.729> sort<00:05:00.910> of

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000 
Nikki did the heel turn and sort of

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.719 
Nikki did the heel turn and sort of
stole<00:05:01.240> the<00:05:01.300> finish<00:05:01.810> away<00:05:02.139> from<00:05:03.100> bri<00:05:03.340> being

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:03.729 
stole the finish away from bri being

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:06.629 
stole the finish away from bri being
able<00:05:04.000> to<00:05:04.120> beat<00:05:04.360> Stephanie<00:05:05.050> um<00:05:05.260> I<00:05:06.040> thought<00:05:06.520> that

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:06.639 
able to beat Stephanie um I thought that

00:05:06.639 --> 00:05:08.129 
able to beat Stephanie um I thought that
it<00:05:06.790> was<00:05:06.880> a<00:05:06.910> really<00:05:07.120> good<00:05:07.360> match<00:05:07.540> one<00:05:07.900> that<00:05:08.050> I

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:08.139 
it was a really good match one that I

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:09.540 
it was a really good match one that I
haven't<00:05:08.350> watched<00:05:08.680> back<00:05:08.979> since<00:05:09.310> but

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:09.550 
haven't watched back since but

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:10.920 
haven't watched back since but
definitely<00:05:09.970> one<00:05:10.150> that<00:05:10.270> I<00:05:10.330> think<00:05:10.389> I<00:05:10.630> will<00:05:10.690> be

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:10.930 
definitely one that I think I will be

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:12.600
