00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.870 
one didn't seem to grow I would have
some<00:00:26.070> options<00:00:26.250> and<00:00:26.750> when<00:00:27.750> I<00:00:27.779> came<00:00:27.930> back<00:00:28.820> my<00:00:29.820> two

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
other options were gone but luckily that

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.780 
other options were gone but luckily that
softball<00:00:33.329> sized<00:00:33.570> pumpkin<00:00:34.140> had<00:00:34.739> grown<00:00:35.070> just<00:00:35.640> a

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
softball sized pumpkin had grown just a

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.970 
softball sized pumpkin had grown just a
little<00:00:36.090> bit<00:00:36.270> it's<00:00:36.989> interesting<00:00:37.290> because<00:00:37.710> the

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
little bit it's interesting because the

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.500 
little bit it's interesting because the
leaves<00:00:38.160> behind<00:00:38.370> me<00:00:38.670> tell<00:00:38.940> a<00:00:38.969> little<00:00:39.210> bit<00:00:39.329> of

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
leaves behind me tell a little bit of

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.650 
leaves behind me tell a little bit of
story<00:00:39.870> of<00:00:40.230> how<00:00:40.410> this<00:00:40.620> pumpkin<00:00:41.070> was<00:00:41.219> doing<00:00:41.660> with

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
story of how this pumpkin was doing with

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.900 
story of how this pumpkin was doing with
the<00:00:42.690> nutrients<00:00:43.320> it's<00:00:43.530> been<00:00:43.710> taking<00:00:44.070> up<00:00:44.219> you'll

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
the nutrients it's been taking up you'll

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.510 
the nutrients it's been taking up you'll
notice<00:00:45.300> that<00:00:45.710> when<00:00:46.710> things<00:00:46.950> started<00:00:47.219> off<00:00:47.340> with

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
notice that when things started off with

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.400 
notice that when things started off with
this<00:00:47.640> Punk<00:00:47.910> but<00:00:48.180> Kim<00:00:48.420> things<00:00:48.780> were<00:00:48.930> nice<00:00:49.140> and

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
this Punk but Kim things were nice and

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.060 
this Punk but Kim things were nice and
green<00:00:49.890> and<00:00:50.449> then<00:00:51.449> I<00:00:51.480> left<00:00:51.930> for<00:00:52.260> work<00:00:52.410> there<00:00:52.770> and

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
green and then I left for work there and

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.729 
green and then I left for work there and
it<00:00:53.430> slowly<00:00:53.789> ate<00:00:54.180> up<00:00:54.360> all<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.660> nutrients<00:00:55.500> that

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
it slowly ate up all the nutrients that

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.939 
it slowly ate up all the nutrients that
we're<00:00:56.129> in<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.399> reservoir<00:00:56.789> and<00:00:57.590> you<00:00:58.590> can<00:00:58.739> tell

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
we're in the reservoir and you can tell

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.470 
we're in the reservoir and you can tell
if<00:00:59.250> you<00:00:59.340> look<00:00:59.489> at<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.670> leaves<00:00:59.850> from<00:01:00.270> that

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
if you look at the leaves from that

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.810 
if you look at the leaves from that
point<00:01:00.780> they're<00:01:01.140> really<00:01:01.649> yellow<00:01:02.129> and<00:01:02.370> then

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
point they're really yellow and then

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.820 
point they're really yellow and then
when<00:01:02.940> I<00:01:02.969> came<00:01:03.090> back<00:01:03.270> from<00:01:03.629> work<00:01:03.870> i<00:01:04.199> refilled

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
when I came back from work i refilled

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.100 
when I came back from work i refilled
the<00:01:05.400> reservoir<00:01:05.939> with<00:01:06.150> nutrients<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:06.869> thinks

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
the reservoir with nutrients and thinks

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.960 
the reservoir with nutrients and thinks
her<00:01:07.260> to<00:01:07.350> get<00:01:07.500> green<00:01:07.770> again<00:01:08.130> so<00:01:08.580> I<00:01:08.610> just<00:01:08.820> found

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
her to get green again so I just found

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.700 
her to get green again so I just found
that<00:01:09.150> interesting<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:09.869> it<00:01:09.990> really<00:01:10.170> does<00:01:10.409> show

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
that interesting and it really does show

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.520 
that interesting and it really does show
how<00:01:10.979> important<00:01:11.460> it<00:01:11.580> is<00:01:11.700> that<00:01:12.290> you're<00:01:13.290> using

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
how important it is that you're using

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.050 
how important it is that you're using
the<00:01:13.710> right<00:01:13.890> kind<00:01:14.130> of<00:01:14.189> nutrients<00:01:14.700> when<00:01:14.939> you're

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
the right kind of nutrients when you're

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.690 
the right kind of nutrients when you're
growing<00:01:15.270> this<00:01:15.509> plant<00:01:16.250> unfortunately<00:01:17.250> when<00:01:17.640> I

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
growing this plant unfortunately when I

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.630 
growing this plant unfortunately when I
came<00:01:17.820> back<00:01:18.060> the<00:01:18.659> auto<00:01:19.290> top<00:01:19.740> off<00:01:19.950> valve<00:01:20.310> had

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
came back the auto top off valve had

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.999 
came back the auto top off valve had
failed<00:01:21.119> and<00:01:21.920> the<00:01:22.920> main<00:01:23.460> reservoir<00:01:24.049> was<00:01:25.049> bone

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
failed and the main reservoir was bone

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.380 
failed and the main reservoir was bone
dry<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.850> roots<00:01:27.150> turned<00:01:27.930> brown<00:01:28.500> and<00:01:29.090> it<00:01:30.090> was

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
dry the roots turned brown and it was

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.840 
dry the roots turned brown and it was
not<00:01:30.630> looking<00:01:31.110> good<00:01:31.409> I<00:01:31.710> was<00:01:32.159> able<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.490> fix<00:01:32.670> that

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
not looking good I was able to fix that

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.880 
not looking good I was able to fix that
just<00:01:33.119> by<00:01:33.240> jiggling<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.110> float<00:01:34.350> a<00:01:34.380> little<00:01:34.619> bit

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
just by jiggling the float a little bit

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.370 
just by jiggling the float a little bit
and<00:01:35.040> started<00:01:36.030> to<00:01:36.119> fill<00:01:36.270> up<00:01:36.420> again<00:01:36.540> and<00:01:36.930> I<00:01:37.200> was<00:01:37.350> a

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
and started to fill up again and I was a

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.140 
and started to fill up again and I was a
little<00:01:37.799> worried<00:01:38.130> whether<00:01:38.460> or<00:01:38.670> not<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.970> roots

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
little worried whether or not the roots

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.149 
little worried whether or not the roots
would<00:01:39.570> be<00:01:39.990> able<00:01:40.170> to<00:01:40.229> take<00:01:40.409> up<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.619> nutrients

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
would be able to take up the nutrients

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.370 
would be able to take up the nutrients
they<00:01:41.430> were<00:01:41.880> just<00:01:42.000> looking<00:01:42.329> like<00:01:42.659> I<00:01:42.810> said<00:01:43.049> brown

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
they were just looking like I said brown

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.639 
they were just looking like I said brown
and<00:01:43.890> pretty<00:01:44.520> dead<00:01:45.049> fortunately<00:01:46.049> once<00:01:46.530> it

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
and pretty dead fortunately once it

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.010 
and pretty dead fortunately once it
filled<00:01:46.920> up<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.369> roots<00:01:48.119> were<00:01:48.329> drinking<00:01:48.780> water

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
filled up the roots were drinking water

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.160 
filled up the roots were drinking water
and<00:01:49.430> it<00:01:50.430> continues<00:01:51.420> to<00:01:51.570> drink<00:01:51.780> a<00:01:51.869> healthy

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
and it continues to drink a healthy

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.899 
and it continues to drink a healthy
amount<00:01:52.380> of<00:01:52.590> about<00:01:52.860> three<00:01:53.189> gallons<00:01:53.340> of<00:01:53.729> water

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
amount of about three gallons of water

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:56.959 
amount of about three gallons of water
per<00:01:54.210> day<00:01:54.570> I'm<00:01:55.350> continuing<00:01:56.009> to<00:01:56.250> burry<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.729> vine

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
per day I'm continuing to burry the vine

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.539 
per day I'm continuing to burry the vine
as<00:01:57.240> it<00:01:57.540> grows<00:01:57.719> out<00:01:57.990> as<00:01:58.829> well<00:01:59.040> because<00:01:59.399> it's

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
as it grows out as well because it's

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.190

September here so that's good for this

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:33.510 
September here so that's good for this
plant<00:02:32.260> because<00:02:32.680> it<00:02:32.920> needs<00:02:33.100> a<00:02:33.220> bit<00:02:33.490> more

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:33.520

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
weeks left in it to grow some more I'd

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:58.860 
weeks left in it to grow some more I'd
really<00:02:57.640> like<00:02:57.760> to<00:02:57.820> see<00:02:58.060> how<00:02:58.240> big<00:02:58.450> we<00:02:58.660> can<00:02:58.690> get

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
really like to see how big we can get

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.740

this<00:02:59.020> thing<00:02:59.260> going<00:02:59.340> by<00:03:00.340> no<00:03:00.400> means<00:03:00.610> is<00:03:01.300> this<00:03:01.330> a

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.540 
think I'd call it that it's big but it's
not<00:03:07.510> a<00:03:07.630> giant<00:03:08.110> still<00:03:08.740> think<00:03:08.920> it's<00:03:09.010> really<00:03:09.340> cool

that<00:03:09.610> it's<00:03:09.940> gone<00:03:10.090> this<00:03:10.300> far<00:03:10.570> in<00:03:11.410> a<00:03:11.620> hydroponic

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
that it's gone this far in a hydroponic

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.520 
that it's gone this far in a hydroponic
system<00:03:12.580> who<00:03:13.180> knows<00:03:13.390> we<00:03:13.750> might<00:03:13.900> get<00:03:14.050> lucky<00:03:14.230> in

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
system who knows we might get lucky in

system who knows we might get lucky in
this<00:03:14.620> thing<00:03:14.920> just<00:03:15.250> might<00:03:15.490> break<00:03:15.670> 100<00:03:16.150> pounds

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630
