00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
to a mini linear actuator it's kind of

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.970 
to a mini linear actuator it's kind of
cool<00:00:39.660> what<00:00:39.750> opens<00:00:40.140> and<00:00:40.290> closes<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.800> rear

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:40.980 
cool what opens and closes the rear

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.250 
cool what opens and closes the rear
hatch<00:00:41.219> this<00:00:41.879> is<00:00:42.030> probably<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.719> only<00:00:42.960> part<00:00:43.230> of

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
hatch this is probably the only part of

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.840 
hatch this is probably the only part of
the<00:00:43.379> model<00:00:43.770> that<00:00:43.800> I<00:00:44.010> really<00:00:44.370> didn't<00:00:44.610> care<00:00:44.789> for

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
the model that I really didn't care for

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.040 
the model that I really didn't care for
because<00:00:45.510> it's<00:00:46.020> so<00:00:46.440> tedious<00:00:47.390> turning<00:00:48.390> gear<00:00:48.840> to

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
because it's so tedious turning gear to

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.049 
because it's so tedious turning gear to
get<00:00:49.200> it<00:00:49.320> to<00:00:49.530> go<00:00:49.649> up<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:50.010> down<00:00:50.160> once<00:00:50.610> you<00:00:50.760> do<00:00:50.940> it

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
get it to go up and down once you do it

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:53.150 
get it to go up and down once you do it
once<00:00:51.180> or<00:00:51.420> twice<00:00:51.449> you<00:00:51.960> probably<00:00:52.469> won't<00:00:52.800> do<00:00:53.039> it

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
once or twice you probably won't do it

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.130 
once or twice you probably won't do it
again<00:00:53.460> but<00:00:53.969> it's<00:00:54.149> still<00:00:54.360> pretty<00:00:54.539> cool<00:00:54.899> that<00:00:55.020> he

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
again but it's still pretty cool that he

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.110 
again but it's still pretty cool that he
threw<00:00:55.410> this<00:00:55.559> in<00:00:55.739> with<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:56.010> model<00:00:56.370> because<00:00:56.670> you

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
threw this in with the model because you

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.689 
threw this in with the model because you
really<00:00:57.420> didn't<00:00:57.629> have<00:00:57.690> to<00:00:57.809> and<00:00:58.350> it<00:00:58.440> was<00:00:58.590> just<00:00:59.579> a

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
really didn't have to and it was just a

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.189 
really didn't have to and it was just a
neat<00:00:59.850> little<00:00:59.969> feature<00:01:00.329> to<00:01:00.629> add<00:01:00.690> on<00:01:00.899> if<00:01:01.079> you

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
neat little feature to add on if you

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.900 
neat little feature to add on if you
don't<00:01:01.410> know<00:01:01.590> anything<00:01:01.829> about<00:01:02.070> actuators

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
don't know anything about actuators

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.990 
don't know anything about actuators
you'll<00:01:03.390> definitely<00:01:03.870> learn<00:01:04.049> something<00:01:04.530> but

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:05.000 
you'll definitely learn something but

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.090 
you'll definitely learn something but

suspension very very solid model and

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:40.789 
suspension very very solid model and
here<00:01:39.750> we<00:01:39.869> have<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.049> little<00:01:40.350> bit<00:01:40.470> more<00:01:40.590> of<00:01:40.710> a

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
here we have a little bit more of a

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.950 
here we have a little bit more of a
steering<00:01:41.130> I<00:01:41.490> really<00:01:42.060> really<00:01:42.329> like<00:01:42.540> what<00:01:42.810> he

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
steering I really really like what he

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.280 
steering I really really like what he
did<00:01:43.200> with<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.500> steering<00:01:43.860> wheel<00:01:44.159> because<00:01:44.850> the

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:45.290 
did with the steering wheel because the

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:47.929 
did with the steering wheel because the
42000<00:01:46.290> didn't<00:01:47.070> come<00:01:47.250> with<00:01:47.399> a<00:01:47.490> steering<00:01:47.790> wheel

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
42000 didn't come with a steering wheel

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.179 
42000 didn't come with a steering wheel
so<00:01:48.390> he<00:01:48.570> improvised<00:01:49.170> as<00:01:49.470> he<00:01:49.590> always<00:01:49.770> does<00:01:50.130> and

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
so he improvised as he always does and

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.609 
so he improvised as he always does and
came<00:01:50.610> up<00:01:50.820> with<00:01:50.850> an<00:01:51.180> excellent<00:01:51.990> design<00:01:52.110> for

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
came up with an excellent design for

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.139 
came up with an excellent design for
steering<00:01:52.890> wheel<00:01:53.189> it<00:01:53.610> has<00:01:53.640> a<00:01:53.790> Knight<00:01:54.119> Rider
