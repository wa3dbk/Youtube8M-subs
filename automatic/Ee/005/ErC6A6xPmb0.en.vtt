00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:04.720
 you have no escape from the alternator train station 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.930
 maurizio maroc that of thousands of travelers who every day must 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:11.900
 get to work place and go home a real daily business between 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.030
 a thousand troubles 

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:18.340
 delays crowded dirty wagons we took the 7 23 train to Milan 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.480
 it brings garibaldi via carnate ten kilometers less than the line of a 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.380
 treviglio but from the path more or less troubled if possible on paper 1 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.380
 now 7 minutes but in practice more than an unknown quantity 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:34.990
 this action or if you can do it 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.640
 this station fs advice 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.060
 they do it every day 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.840
 I offer cleaning 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.960
 includes 123 heating do not find are dead 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.130
 recipe 

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.410
 bad danilo rock and maybe 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.200
 continue somehow they are not which one gets gay they can be adopted kind 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.370
 we will do this because they are all very unhappy with being attracted 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.280
 absolutely 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.440
 unworthy 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:07.490
 constituent 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.770
 line 77 Italian fan and now 2 hours monthly 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.540
 this is always hot 7 15 the first company at least 10 minutes late 

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.340
 certainly those who work 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:19.520
 besides paying 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.160
 the cost of the ticket will also promise you these additional costs 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.040
 which is high the end of the year are days of vacation June 13th 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.480
 starting from bergamo the journey is certainly more comfortable because yes 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:35.469
 find a seat but already from the first stop Ponte San Pietro 

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:38.700
 and even more from paderno to find a free armchair is really 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.700
 a utopia look 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.310
 and if to reach Milan the conditions of travel via Treviglio are 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.550
 very bad look what happens from the flesh the cars are overflowing do not 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.400
 even fails to pass 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.250
 it is closer to a cattle car that does not have a transport service 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:02.850
 for commuters 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.470
 how many minutes is full 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:06.360
 all deal - milan 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.800
 therefore 40 5 minutes mountain view beyond discomfort also the lack of respect 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.690
 of safety regulations 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.110
 and it is not over here over the delays and the overcrowding also leaves more hygiene 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.570
 that to be desired the seats of mine are evident proof are kept in 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:25.529
 I would say a very shameful state 

00:02:25.529 --> 00:02:28.739
 vacations we are in 2008 in Italian 

00:02:29.679 --> 00:02:32.469
 let's look at one thing around the world 

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:33.659
 terrifying 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:37.170
 as you can see from the sign the last thorough cleaning on this wagon 

00:02:37.169 --> 00:02:39.370
 was performed in November 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.819
 we understand something more than the unattainable hygienic conditions too 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:47.250
 thanks to the explanation of a commuter reason 5 May in the afternoon you should 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.149
 come here in garibaldi you would see that they do so come 

00:02:50.149 --> 00:02:51.519
 splash 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:54.519
 in this way stefano this pepoli 

00:02:57.139 --> 00:03:01.149
 hungary or this world of cleaning trains but they are not gods seats but 

00:03:01.149 --> 00:03:02.089
 also 

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:05.479
 in the floor I lower I don't know where to see where 

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:10.029
 you can see that someone did but if you then check the status of the seats 

00:03:10.029 --> 00:03:10.569
 It's really
