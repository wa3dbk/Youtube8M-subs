00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.940
 of silos 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:31.520
 all right 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:36.380
 accompanied twice 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.380
 special guests very early 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.760
 best 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:54.839
 six and a half years 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.820
 before when I was studying in the 

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:59.129
 university and or advertising studio 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.589
 then the subject was a bit complicated 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:07.309
 of my schedules the subject of coordinating 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:07.309
 things but good as is the goal 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.510
 with the championship 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.790
 they are on the way working and working in 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:20.320
 the ranges 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.320
 and it's what I love that better 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:29.810
 it's horrible because my first 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:30.830
 experience in esRadio 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.049
 once they invited me because 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.640
 they needed some things off of a 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:36.159
 Argentina for the qualifiers of the 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.539
 world 2010 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:40.430
 then I went because I from time to time 

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:43.149
 when he recorded wedges and almost a small 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.149
 to pay for college 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:49.630
 to have in your pocket and pay the 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.630
 next semester 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.340
 but I did not know what was left 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.860
 they gave me 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:08.720
 with hearing aids microphones and talk in 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.720
 I was shaking my voice 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.930
 I was getting into 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.930
 but little more 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:23.330
 among family friends they made me in 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.330
 a news bar 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.849
 that was my first time on radio the 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.849
 first time 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.610
 do not ask me how and I just tried 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.120
 of 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.890
 give me 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:46.010
 if you give publicity it gave me 

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:48.310
 communication no teacher to handle 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.310
 the nerves 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.060
 in a moment I felt so comfortable that I 

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:58.120
 I forgot that someone was listening to me 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.670
 on the other side 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.840
 conversation 

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.730
 more fluid 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.090
 it arrived that I was that newly known 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:07.090
 where 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:15.350
 it would also be the nerves but that 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:18.030
 breathe 

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:20.590
 and try to give the best 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:23.980
 I have seemed to be calming 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:25.890
 do you have a trick like taking something 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:30.840
 before for 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:30.840
 I drink like four glasses of brandy 

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:37.739
 and there are many people who heat the voice 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:48.670
 is imported from the radio 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:55.560
 what counts is more the personality 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:59.440
 it purely has 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:01.930
 nice medium to the air because 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:05.930
 Y 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:07.560
 and as we go harmonious it 's good 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.520
 thought 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:13.110
 do not 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.110
 if you have to take good care of yourself 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:26.270
 and the usual ones 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:28.569
 of water and deficiency 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.569
 good 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.490
 of a passion 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:41.120
 with all my heart and always with the 

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:41.120
 account 

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:51.150
 although it's a natural thing how you do to 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.150
 do 

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:55.820
 going on air as fear the best 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.409
 face 

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:00.239
 and being good asleep 

00:04:58.409 --> 00:05:03.059
 and obviously none of them listen as 

00:05:00.239 --> 00:05:05.309
 fede or roads and sometimes I felt very 

00:05:03.059 --> 00:05:06.980
 bad with fever but try to give what 

00:05:05.309 --> 00:05:11.170
 better always 

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:11.170
 Billy to everyone who murders 

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:17.580
 for that line 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:19.770
 Have patience that do not wait for 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:21.870
 graduate from college to start 

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:23.400
 to work or to try it on the radio 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:25.740
 that they take into account your body 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:27.389
 from long before 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:29.340
 and I think that nobody came here 

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:32.300
 nobody's word like 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:34.729
 communicators 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.870
 with people who believe 

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:37.180
 it is the effort what good 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:40.289
 confrontation 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:40.289
 to nobody without cost 

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:45.150
 T shirt 

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:50.990
 loading cables and putting there behind 

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:54.800
 the 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:58.690
 until we get here and day 

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:58.690
 dear ones for the vision there for evil 

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:08.250
 good is an experience that makes you 

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:08.250
 marked when it's sad 

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:14.440
 and experiences that make me marked 

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:14.440
 positive to negative good is negative 

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:19.600
 at 45 kilos 

00:06:28.389 --> 00:06:33.670
 many 

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:36.870
 with the same 

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:40.680
 learn the sea and learn events 

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:40.680
 demarcated be with the client 

00:06:41.529 --> 00:06:47.249
 as a person we also want 

00:06:44.679 --> 00:06:47.249
 experts 

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:55.790
 the car very well 

00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:00.410
 the ugly duckling 

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:05.880
 when did you see 

00:07:05.889 --> 00:07:11.220
 Even artists are going 

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:14.630
 I never went Columbia for me this 

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:14.630
 in a famous artist of education 

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:18.449
 yes 

00:07:24.210 --> 00:07:28.500
 he did not show me the barbarous
