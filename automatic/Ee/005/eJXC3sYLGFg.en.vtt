00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.589
 Hello, I'm Alexey 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.900
 this is the fifth release of the second season vlog two 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:15.490
 wheels 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.280
 if you are joining just now 

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:20.170
 I advise you to look at previous issues 

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:24.000
 there is a link in the description there are many 

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:24.000
 I hope so interesting 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.110
 the third season will most likely come out at the end 

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:34.060
 spring we will try it very much 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.520
 to bring but here how the card will fall 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:38.530
 if you watched the very beginning you should 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.600
 there were notice inconsistencies which 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.180
 It turned out that we have at the beginning 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:46.329
 it was said about the three classes of bikes in 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:48.129
 as a result, we have already voiced them 4 and in the fifth 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:49.840
 the release we will sound another class 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:52.359
 bikes which will be essentially already 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:53.980
 fifth so what's really all 

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:56.680
 classifications are rather blurred 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.449
 By the way, once again I remind you that this 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.710
 version classification only 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:02.140
 outdoor time project 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.490
 and you may disagree with it 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.090
 your right 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:07.840
 well in this issue we will look at 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.850
 non-standard bikes 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:12.040
 some afternoon with fire in russia not 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.720
 you find love really is not 

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.790
 standard bike I once saw 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:20.080
 video on youtube and tricycle 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:21.490
 bike and 6 shock absorbers that all 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.220
 sometimes monocycle 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:28.000
 this bike has come from the circus 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.750
 one pedal wheel on the seat bushing and 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.030
 fork 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.790
 actually everything turns corps 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:36.540
 this bike is designed for pretty 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:38.229
 such a spectacular appearance 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.320
 short ride 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:43.690
 non-durable close because 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:46.300
 itâ€™s not very easy to balance 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.550
 want really a matter of habit in 

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.680
 In general, it is rather such a bike 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:52.720
 although those who use monocycle can 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.700
 disagree with me tandem it 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.650
 bike for two people taxis 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.750
 front pedals both thanks 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:01.090
 special transmission design is 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.250
 bikes are quite popular in europe in 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.050
 Russia they can not often meet 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:07.630
 because they are very specific in 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:10.899
 the train with them will not fit in the subway 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:13.270
 do not come down they can not be folded 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:15.940
 soils also not ride because 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:18.550
 he has a very long base 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:21.040
 landing and over uneven terrain he doesn't 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:23.590
 very well prepare for you know 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.180
 cries we have roads in Russia tricycles 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.060
 bicycle on three wheels 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:30.790
 most often they have one wheel in front and 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.200
 two behind very rarely the other way around as the 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.250
 the rule is all the same bikes 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.350
 rear wheel drive 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.900
 I myself common design 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.040
 tricycle is a cargo bike from him 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.800
 there is a big minus 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:45.700
 for example on dirt roads with 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:48.520
 deep ruts in it there are no grant 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:52.780
 in the narrow vestibule of the train too 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:54.640
 fit trike is the most specific 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.770
 Bicycle class in Europe such 

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.020
 bikes are also called leagues of birth 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:00.580
 eric bandage is a bike in which 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:02.980
 how would you lie 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:05.530
 advantage due to ultra-low fit 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.690
 this bike is awesome 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:10.150
 streamline can develop huge 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.340
 speed besides lying back you 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.460
 get extra footrest and 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.670
 can attach much 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:20.010
 still effort with less effort a for 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:22.290
 through ultra low center with mass center 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:25.080
 gravity on them you can lay 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.430
 very steep turns but this one has 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.310
 back side 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:32.400
 due to the ultra low fit essentially you 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:34.740
 lie you a fig is not visible behind the machines 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.600
 and in town enjoy such roll with 

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:40.470
 dinners strongly discouraged 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:43.320
 This is Russia and we have such drivers that 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.580
 you can not see well, even Bigfoot 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:46.350
 that's all 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:48.030
 I hope you liked it and it was useful 

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:53.240
 the information that I told 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:53.240
 thank you for being with us and alexey see you
