update on the five gallon nano tank and
unfortunately<00:00:13.610> it's<00:00:14.000> not<00:00:14.210> a<00:00:14.270> good<00:00:14.630> update<00:00:14.900> so

if you take a look at the counter here
in<00:00:18.260> front<00:00:18.800> of<00:00:18.890> the<00:00:18.980> tank<00:00:19.599> there<00:00:20.599> is<00:00:20.960> a<00:00:21.320> bunch<00:00:21.590> of

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:21.740 
in front of the tank there is a bunch of

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.460 
in front of the tank there is a bunch of
water<00:00:22.040> and<00:00:22.490> I<00:00:22.700> can<00:00:22.849> actually<00:00:23.000> see<00:00:23.330> it<00:00:23.470> moving

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:24.470 
water and I can actually see it moving

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.429 
water and I can actually see it moving
now<00:00:24.650> I<00:00:24.919> didn't<00:00:25.489> see<00:00:25.610> that<00:00:25.640> before<00:00:26.230> but<00:00:27.230> I'm

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:27.439 
now I didn't see that before but I'm

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:29.350 
now I didn't see that before but I'm
pretty<00:00:27.710> sure<00:00:28.009> when<00:00:28.400> I<00:00:28.430> sold<00:00:28.820> my<00:00:28.970> cleaner

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:29.360 
pretty sure when I sold my cleaner

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:30.999 
pretty sure when I sold my cleaner
shrimp<00:00:29.750> or<00:00:30.079> when<00:00:30.230> I<00:00:30.259> traded<00:00:30.590> my<00:00:30.680> cleaner

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:31.009 
shrimp or when I traded my cleaner

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:34.660 
shrimp or when I traded my cleaner
shrimp<00:00:31.399> that<00:00:32.210> I<00:00:32.860> had<00:00:33.860> I<00:00:34.070> mean<00:00:34.250> I<00:00:34.310> had<00:00:34.430> to<00:00:34.520> take

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:34.670 
shrimp that I had I mean I had to take

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.430 
shrimp that I had I mean I had to take
out<00:00:34.790> the<00:00:34.910> rocks<00:00:35.120> in<00:00:35.450> order<00:00:35.660> to<00:00:35.750> catch<00:00:35.930> him<00:00:36.110> and

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:36.440 
out the rocks in order to catch him and

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.350 
out the rocks in order to catch him and
I'm<00:00:37.100> pretty<00:00:37.309> certain<00:00:37.550> that<00:00:37.790> when<00:00:38.030> I<00:00:38.059> put<00:00:38.270> the

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:38.360 
I'm pretty certain that when I put the

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.170 
I'm pretty certain that when I put the
rocks<00:00:38.570> back<00:00:38.809> in<00:00:39.020> I<00:00:39.260> either<00:00:40.190> push<00:00:40.580> down<00:00:40.850> too

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.180 
rocks back in I either push down too

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.090 
rocks back in I either push down too
hard<00:00:41.210> on<00:00:41.570> them<00:00:41.750> when<00:00:41.960> I<00:00:41.990> was<00:00:42.350> moving<00:00:42.710> them<00:00:42.980> back

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:43.100 
hard on them when I was moving them back

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.460 
hard on them when I was moving them back
into<00:00:43.280> place<00:00:43.490> or<00:00:44.090> I<00:00:44.210> set<00:00:44.600> them<00:00:44.750> down<00:00:44.780> too<00:00:45.200> tough

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:45.470 
into place or I set them down too tough

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.190 
into place or I set them down too tough
or<00:00:45.740> too<00:00:46.040> hard<00:00:46.250> and<00:00:46.630> of<00:00:47.630> course<00:00:47.870> I<00:00:47.990> didn't

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:48.200 
or too hard and of course I didn't

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.110 
or too hard and of course I didn't
follow<00:00:48.350> my<00:00:48.560> own<00:00:48.590> advice<00:00:48.710> I<00:00:49.250> have<00:00:49.280> no<00:00:49.610> egg<00:00:49.820> crate

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.120 
follow my own advice I have no egg crate

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.260 
follow my own advice I have no egg crate
at<00:00:50.450> the<00:00:50.600> bottom<00:00:50.870> of<00:00:50.990> this<00:00:51.080> tank<00:00:51.320> so<00:00:52.000> I'm<00:00:53.000> pretty

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:53.270 
at the bottom of this tank so I'm pretty

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.510 
at the bottom of this tank so I'm pretty
certain<00:00:53.840> that<00:00:53.870> I<00:00:54.380> cracked<00:00:54.830> the<00:00:54.980> bottom<00:00:55.310> and

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 
certain that I cracked the bottom and

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.940 
certain that I cracked the bottom and
that<00:00:56.510> is<00:00:56.810> what's<00:00:57.080> causing<00:00:57.350> it<00:00:57.590> to<00:00:57.710> leak<00:00:57.860> so

00:00:59.940 --> 00:00:59.950 
that is what's causing it to leak so

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:03.400 
that is what's causing it to leak so
yeah<00:01:00.950> so<00:01:01.880> what<00:01:02.030> I'm<00:01:02.090> gonna<00:01:02.180> do<00:01:02.450> temporarily<00:01:03.079> is

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:03.410 
yeah so what I'm gonna do temporarily is

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.140 
yeah so what I'm gonna do temporarily is
I'm<00:01:03.560> going<00:01:03.650> to<00:01:03.740> move<00:01:03.950> these<00:01:04.159> corals<00:01:04.610> into<00:01:05.030> the

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
I'm going to move these corals into the

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.719 
I'm going to move these corals into the
bio<00:01:05.329> cube<00:01:05.750> I'm<00:01:06.350> not<00:01:06.650> sure<00:01:06.920> exactly<00:01:07.250> where<00:01:07.610> I'm

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
bio cube I'm not sure exactly where I'm

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:09.190 
bio cube I'm not sure exactly where I'm
gonna<00:01:07.850> put<00:01:08.060> all<00:01:08.090> of<00:01:08.329> them<00:01:08.450> right<00:01:08.630> now<00:01:08.659> but

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
gonna put all of them right now but

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.200 
gonna put all of them right now but
we're<00:01:09.710> gonna<00:01:09.799> figure<00:01:10.070> it<00:01:10.159> out<00:01:10.369> here<00:01:10.640> shortly

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
we're gonna figure it out here shortly

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:12.969 
we're gonna figure it out here shortly

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:12.979 
and then I'll make another video of it

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:16.719 
and then I'll make another video of it
after<00:01:13.219> we're<00:01:13.340> done<00:01:13.520> and<00:01:13.869> then<00:01:15.009> as<00:01:16.009> you<00:01:16.609> guys

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
know I'm dismantling my ten gallon tank

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.130 
know I'm dismantling my ten gallon tank
my<00:01:18.920> 10<00:01:19.189> gallon<00:01:19.429> freshwater<00:01:19.579> tank<00:01:20.090> so<00:01:20.359> rather

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
my 10 gallon freshwater tank so rather

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:22.719 
my 10 gallon freshwater tank so rather
than<00:01:21.350> buying<00:01:21.530> another<00:01:21.859> tank<00:01:22.130> I<00:01:22.369> already<00:01:22.579> have

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
than buying another tank I already have

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:24.209 
than buying another tank I already have
all<00:01:22.880> the<00:01:23.030> equipment<00:01:23.179> and<00:01:23.509> things<00:01:23.659> that<00:01:23.719> I<00:01:23.869> need

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:24.219 
all the equipment and things that I need

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:28.510 
all the equipment and things that I need
so<00:01:25.219> I<00:01:25.249> think<00:01:25.399> that<00:01:25.670> I<00:01:25.729> think<00:01:26.090> I'm<00:01:26.179> going<00:01:26.359> to<00:01:27.520> use

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
so I think that I think I'm going to use

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.489 
so I think that I think I'm going to use
you<00:01:29.060> know<00:01:29.179> the<00:01:29.329> heater<00:01:29.509> and<00:01:29.630> the<00:01:29.960> filter<00:01:30.289> and

00:01:30.489 --> 00:01:30.499 
you know the heater and the filter and

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:32.469 
you know the heater and the filter and
all<00:01:30.619> that<00:01:30.799> good<00:01:31.039> stuff<00:01:31.100> and<00:01:31.670> put<00:01:32.119> that<00:01:32.210> in<00:01:32.389> my

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
all that good stuff and put that in my

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:34.809 
all that good stuff and put that in my
ten<00:01:32.689> gallon<00:01:33.020> tank<00:01:33.049> and<00:01:33.530> bring<00:01:34.159> that<00:01:34.280> back<00:01:34.579> up

00:01:34.809 --> 00:01:34.819 
ten gallon tank and bring that back up

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:37.300 
ten gallon tank and bring that back up
as<00:01:35.060> small<00:01:35.450> nano<00:01:35.869> reef<00:01:36.229> so<00:01:36.649> I<00:01:36.679> can<00:01:36.950> put<00:01:37.130> some<00:01:37.280> of

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
as small nano reef so I can put some of

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.160 
as small nano reef so I can put some of
these<00:01:37.429> corals<00:01:37.819> back<00:01:38.060> into<00:01:38.509> their<00:01:38.659> own<00:01:38.810> tank

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:39.170 
these corals back into their own tank

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:40.779 
these corals back into their own tank
because<00:01:39.560> my<00:01:39.679> bio<00:01:39.859> keeps<00:01:40.219> getting<00:01:40.429> pretty<00:01:40.609> full

00:01:40.779 --> 00:01:40.789 
because my bio keeps getting pretty full

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:43.899 
because my bio keeps getting pretty full
so<00:01:41.619> after<00:01:42.619> we<00:01:42.709> take<00:01:42.920> these<00:01:43.039> out<00:01:43.249> I'm<00:01:43.459> going<00:01:43.759> to

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 
so after we take these out I'm going to

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:46.569 
so after we take these out I'm going to
pick<00:01:44.479> up<00:01:44.600> the<00:01:44.719> tank<00:01:44.929> and<00:01:45.259> see<00:01:46.069> if<00:01:46.189> it's<00:01:46.310> cracked

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:46.579 
pick up the tank and see if it's cracked

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:47.980 
pick up the tank and see if it's cracked
and<00:01:46.880> I'll<00:01:47.060> take<00:01:47.209> a<00:01:47.240> video<00:01:47.389> of<00:01:47.569> it<00:01:47.749> and<00:01:47.840> I'll<00:01:47.899> let

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
and I'll take a video of it and I'll let

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.569 
and I'll take a video of it and I'll let
you<00:01:48.139> guys<00:01:48.289> know<00:01:48.459> what<00:01:49.459> is<00:01:49.609> going<00:01:49.909> down<00:01:51.579> alright

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:52.579 
you guys know what is going down alright

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:56.499 
you guys know what is going down alright
so<00:01:52.880> we're<00:01:53.029> back<00:01:53.060> and<00:01:54.279> something<00:01:55.279> might<00:01:55.939> not

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:56.509 
so we're back and something might not

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:00.419 
so we're back and something might not
quite<00:01:56.899> look<00:01:57.170> right<00:01:57.679> with<00:01:58.130> the<00:01:58.249> tank<00:01:58.520> now<00:01:58.700> and

00:02:00.419 --> 00:02:00.429 
quite look right with the tank now and

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:02.949 
quite look right with the tank now and
what<00:02:01.429> doesn't<00:02:01.759> look<00:02:01.789> right<00:02:02.029> about<00:02:02.299> it<00:02:02.539> is<00:02:02.719> it's

00:02:02.949 --> 00:02:02.959 
what doesn't look right about it is it's

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:06.279 
what doesn't look right about it is it's
no<00:02:03.229> longer<00:02:03.469> a<00:02:03.649> saltwater<00:02:04.099> nano<00:02:04.819> reef<00:02:05.289> so

00:02:06.279 --> 00:02:06.289 
no longer a saltwater nano reef so

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:10.389 
no longer a saltwater nano reef so
indeed<00:02:07.279> I<00:02:07.639> took<00:02:08.450> everything<00:02:08.840> out<00:02:09.349> of<00:02:09.410> this

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
indeed I took everything out of this

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.220 
indeed I took everything out of this
five<00:02:10.670> gallon<00:02:10.880> tank<00:02:11.330> and<00:02:11.510> attempts<00:02:11.930> to<00:02:11.959> find

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
five gallon tank and attempts to find

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.750 
five gallon tank and attempts to find
the<00:02:12.349> leak<00:02:12.530> and<00:02:12.680> I<00:02:12.860> did<00:02:13.130> not<00:02:13.280> find<00:02:13.819> a<00:02:14.180> leak<00:02:15.760> after

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
the leak and I did not find a leak after

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.490 
the leak and I did not find a leak after
thinking<00:02:17.000> about<00:02:17.150> it<00:02:17.330> for<00:02:17.570> a<00:02:17.630> while<00:02:17.870> I<00:02:17.930> think<00:02:18.230> it

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
thinking about it for a while I think it

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.250 
thinking about it for a while I think it
could<00:02:18.680> possibly<00:02:18.710> be<00:02:19.400> because<00:02:19.820> I<00:02:20.060> put<00:02:20.480> peer

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
could possibly be because I put peer

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.530 
could possibly be because I put peer
Kuragin<00:02:21.530> in<00:02:21.650> the<00:02:21.739> filter<00:02:22.099> at<00:02:22.340> the<00:02:22.370> top<00:02:22.670> and<00:02:23.180> the

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
Kuragin in the filter at the top and the

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.130 
Kuragin in the filter at the top and the
water<00:02:23.569> was<00:02:24.970> not<00:02:25.970> quite<00:02:26.450> going<00:02:26.659> through<00:02:27.019> the

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
water was not quite going through the

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.240 
water was not quite going through the
mesh<00:02:27.349> bag<00:02:28.629> and<00:02:29.629> was<00:02:30.170> rather<00:02:30.379> going<00:02:30.739> around<00:02:31.040> it

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
mesh bag and was rather going around it

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.369 
mesh bag and was rather going around it
in<00:02:31.430> some<00:02:31.700> cases<00:02:31.939> and<00:02:32.329> flowing<00:02:32.810> over<00:02:32.930> the<00:02:33.049> side

00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:33.379 
in some cases and flowing over the side

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:34.809 
in some cases and flowing over the side
of<00:02:33.590> the<00:02:33.680> filter<00:02:33.950> and<00:02:34.099> that's<00:02:34.400> what<00:02:34.549> I<00:02:34.579> think

00:02:34.809 --> 00:02:34.819 
of the filter and that's what I think

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:38.500 
of the filter and that's what I think
what<00:02:34.970> was<00:02:35.090> going<00:02:35.390> on<00:02:35.480> so<00:02:36.790> what<00:02:37.790> I<00:02:37.819> decided<00:02:38.360> to

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
what was going on so what I decided to

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.819 
what was going on so what I decided to
do<00:02:38.950> was<00:02:39.950> as<00:02:40.430> you<00:02:41.150> know<00:02:41.180> from<00:02:42.110> my<00:02:42.319> other<00:02:42.409> videos

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:42.829 
do was as you know from my other videos

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:44.530 
do was as you know from my other videos
I'm<00:02:43.040> dismantling<00:02:43.640> my<00:02:43.819> ten<00:02:44.060> gallon<00:02:44.360> freshwater

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
I'm dismantling my ten gallon freshwater

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.440 
I'm dismantling my ten gallon freshwater
tank<00:02:45.140> well<00:02:45.640> since<00:02:46.640> I<00:02:46.730> had<00:02:46.849> already<00:02:46.970> taken

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
tank well since I had already taken

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.630 
tank well since I had already taken
everything<00:02:47.540> out<00:02:47.900> of<00:02:47.930> the<00:02:48.170> five<00:02:48.500> gallon<00:02:49.010> nano

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
everything out of the five gallon nano

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.630 
everything out of the five gallon nano
reef<00:02:49.940> tank<00:02:50.269> and<00:02:50.569> put<00:02:50.750> in<00:02:50.870> my<00:02:50.959> bio<00:02:51.170> cube<00:02:51.640> which

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:52.640 
reef tank and put in my bio cube which

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.309 
reef tank and put in my bio cube which
you'll<00:02:53.180> be<00:02:53.329> able<00:02:53.420> to<00:02:53.599> see<00:02:53.780> everything<00:02:54.079> that

00:02:54.309 --> 00:02:54.319 
you'll be able to see everything that

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:57.640 
you'll be able to see everything that
was<00:02:54.379> in<00:02:54.530> that<00:02:54.560> tank<00:02:54.890> on<00:02:55.159> a<00:02:56.060> bio<00:02:56.629> cube<00:02:57.200> update

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
was in that tank on a bio cube update

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:00.789 
was in that tank on a bio cube update
that<00:02:57.829> I'll<00:02:57.920> post<00:02:58.129> soon<00:02:58.940> as<00:02:59.239> well<00:02:59.769> what<00:03:00.769> I

that I'll post soon as well what I
decided<00:03:01.159> to<00:03:01.250> do<00:03:01.459> was<00:03:01.790> take<00:03:02.569> everything<00:03:03.200> out<00:03:03.470> of

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
decided to do was take everything out of

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.479 
decided to do was take everything out of
the<00:03:04.159> ten<00:03:04.400> gallon<00:03:04.700> freshwater<00:03:04.879> tank<00:03:06.099> put<00:03:07.099> the

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489 
the ten gallon freshwater tank put the

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:09.220 
the ten gallon freshwater tank put the
Guppies<00:03:08.090> you<00:03:08.299> can<00:03:08.420> see<00:03:08.540> all<00:03:08.629> the<00:03:08.750> Guppies<00:03:09.049> you

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:09.230 
Guppies you can see all the Guppies you

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:11.530 
Guppies you can see all the Guppies you
can<00:03:09.379> see<00:03:09.819> then<00:03:10.819> you<00:03:10.909> can<00:03:11.030> see<00:03:11.180> like<00:03:11.329> three

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540 
can see then you can see like three

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.470 
can see then you can see like three
times<00:03:11.780> there<00:03:12.019> I<00:03:12.819> put<00:03:13.819> all<00:03:13.940> the<00:03:14.030> Guppies<00:03:14.299> into

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:14.480 
times there I put all the Guppies into

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.110 
times there I put all the Guppies into
the<00:03:14.569> five<00:03:14.750> gallon<00:03:15.170> tank<00:03:15.470> and<00:03:15.739> I'm<00:03:16.730> going<00:03:17.090> to

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
the five gallon tank and I'm going to

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.640 
the five gallon tank and I'm going to
make<00:03:17.389> the<00:03:17.599> 10<00:03:17.959> gallon<00:03:18.200> tank<00:03:18.440> a<00:03:18.980> nano<00:03:19.760> reef<00:03:20.090> a<00:03:20.650> to

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:21.650 
make the 10 gallon tank a nano reef a to

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:24.729 
make the 10 gallon tank a nano reef a to
give<00:03:21.769> myself<00:03:21.920> some<00:03:22.370> more<00:03:22.489> room<00:03:22.819> for<00:03:23.739> more

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
give myself some more room for more

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:28.809 
give myself some more room for more
corals<00:03:25.280> more<00:03:25.760> whatever<00:03:26.239> etc<00:03:27.199> and<00:03:27.410> be<00:03:28.099> to<00:03:28.459> also

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:28.819 
corals more whatever etc and be to also

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:30.069 
corals more whatever etc and be to also
make<00:03:29.060> it<00:03:29.090> a<00:03:29.269> little<00:03:29.419> easier<00:03:29.629> to<00:03:29.930> maintain

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:30.079 
make it a little easier to maintain

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:32.589 
make it a little easier to maintain
because<00:03:30.680> with<00:03:30.859> a<00:03:30.889> higher<00:03:31.129> water<00:03:31.699> volume<00:03:32.209> the

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:32.599 
because with a higher water volume the

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:35.500 
because with a higher water volume the
parameters<00:03:33.319> will<00:03:33.590> swing<00:03:34.040> I<00:03:34.340> mean<00:03:35.120> a<00:03:35.299> thing

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
parameters will swing I mean a thing

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.119 
parameters will swing I mean a thing
gallon<00:03:35.780> tank<00:03:35.959> is<00:03:36.079> still<00:03:36.410> small<00:03:36.799> so<00:03:37.040> the

00:03:37.119 --> 00:03:37.129 
gallon tank is still small so the

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:40.420 
gallon tank is still small so the
parameters<00:03:37.639> will<00:03:38.180> be<00:03:39.010> subject<00:03:40.010> to<00:03:40.069> swinging

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:40.430 
parameters will be subject to swinging

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.119 
parameters will be subject to swinging
quite<00:03:40.970> a<00:03:41.000> bit<00:03:41.239> but<00:03:41.989> not<00:03:42.169> the<00:03:42.650> same<00:03:42.889> as<00:03:43.040> they

00:03:43.119 --> 00:03:43.129 
quite a bit but not the same as they

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:47.199 
quite a bit but not the same as they
would<00:03:43.280> in<00:03:43.489> a<00:03:43.549> five<00:03:43.790> gallon<00:03:43.819> tank<00:03:44.419> so<00:03:45.049> the<00:03:46.209> five

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
would in a five gallon tank so the five

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:51.099 
would in a five gallon tank so the five
gallon<00:03:47.810> nano<00:03:48.349> reef<00:03:49.030> tank<00:03:50.030> videos<00:03:50.449> are<00:03:50.810> going

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:51.109 
gallon nano reef tank videos are going

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:54.430 
gallon nano reef tank videos are going
to<00:03:51.230> be<00:03:51.349> no<00:03:51.500> more<00:03:51.769> and<00:03:52.840> they<00:03:53.840> will<00:03:54.019> be<00:03:54.139> replaced

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
to be no more and they will be replaced

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:58.210 
to be no more and they will be replaced
by<00:03:54.769> a<00:03:54.799> 10<00:03:55.220> gallon<00:03:55.400> nano<00:03:55.819> reef<00:03:56.739> series<00:03:57.739> that<00:03:58.099> I'm

by a 10 gallon nano reef series that I'm

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.159 
by a 10 gallon nano reef series that I'm
going<00:03:58.549> to<00:03:58.639> start<00:03:58.910> today<00:03:59.090> actually<00:03:59.510> I'm<00:03:59.930> going

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:00.169 
going to start today actually I'm going

gallon<00:04:27.400> nano<00:04:28.400> reef<00:04:28.669> series<00:04:29.060> which<00:04:29.719> will<00:04:29.870> have

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
gallon nano reef series which will have

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:31.930 
gallon nano reef series which will have
everything<00:04:30.650> that<00:04:30.800> the<00:04:30.889> 5<00:04:31.130> gallon<00:04:31.370> in<00:04:31.669> our<00:04:31.789> reef

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940 
everything that the 5 gallon in our reef

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:33.930 
everything that the 5 gallon in our reef
series<00:04:32.300> had<00:04:32.539> and<00:04:33.050> more

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:33.940 
series had and more

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.190 
series had and more
so<00:04:35.790> this<00:04:36.790> is<00:04:37.120> probably<00:04:37.510> the<00:04:37.630> last<00:04:37.810> video

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:38.200 
so this is probably the last video

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.470 
so this is probably the last video
you'll<00:04:38.470> see<00:04:38.530> of<00:04:38.830> this<00:04:38.980> little<00:04:39.280> tank<00:04:39.550> I'm<00:04:40.120> just

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:42.300 
you'll see of this little tank I'm just
going<00:04:40.780> to<00:04:40.810> keep<00:04:41.020> it<00:04:41.170> around<00:04:41.290> until<00:04:41.650> I<00:04:41.830> can<00:04:42.040> find

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
going to keep it around until I can find

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.340 
going to keep it around until I can find
