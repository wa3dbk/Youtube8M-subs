only<00:01:41.159> seven<00:01:41.700> hours<00:01:41.790> in<00:01:42.119> I<00:01:42.360> have<00:01:43.020> to<00:01:43.170> say<00:01:43.320> this

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
only seven hours in I have to say this

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.609

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
might be not the top of the list because

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:47.899 
might be not the top of the list because
I<00:01:46.770> haven't<00:01:46.920> even<00:01:47.070> finished<00:01:47.280> it<00:01:47.579> yet<00:01:47.729> so<00:01:47.880> I

I haven't even finished it yet so I

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.639 
I haven't even finished it yet so I
couldn't<00:01:48.180> say<00:01:48.420> that<00:01:48.659> but<00:01:48.869> it's<00:01:49.020> definitely

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
couldn't say that but it's definitely

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.830

would say probably the Elder Scrolls

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.350
