00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.980
 along the streets of nuts 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.980
 it seemed possible and 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.710
 as you can see, I even come across steles 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:50.710

 the resulting mass is set on fire 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:30.630
 bring to a boil continuously stirring 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:41.910
 when the mass starts to boil 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:45.570
 put there butter nuts and 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.570
 add some salt 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:55.740
 cook until the mass thickens and does not 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:55.740
 will become homogeneous 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:08.190
 give a little cool and pour in 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:08.190
