a lot of dishes between using blenders

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.509 
a lot of dishes between using blenders
and<00:00:25.050> then<00:00:25.140> putting<00:00:25.320> it<00:00:25.500> in<00:00:25.590> a<00:00:25.650> cup<00:00:25.859> and<00:00:26.099> if

and then putting it in a cup and if

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:27.800 
and then putting it in a cup and if
you're<00:00:26.640> doing<00:00:26.760> that<00:00:26.939> twice<00:00:27.060> a<00:00:27.150> day<00:00:27.390> that<00:00:27.660> can

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
you're doing that twice a day that can

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.599 
you're doing that twice a day that can
add<00:00:27.930> up<00:00:27.960> to<00:00:28.109> a<00:00:28.260> lot<00:00:28.470> so<00:00:28.800> what<00:00:29.039> I've<00:00:29.130> been<00:00:29.310> doing

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
add up to a lot so what I've been doing

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.720 
add up to a lot so what I've been doing
instead<00:00:30.060> is<00:00:30.330> using<00:00:31.289> mason<00:00:31.679> jars<00:00:31.890> I<00:00:32.130> don't<00:00:32.610> know

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
instead is using mason jars I don't know

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.670 
instead is using mason jars I don't know
if<00:00:32.850> you<00:00:32.969> know<00:00:33.180> this<00:00:33.390> but<00:00:33.630> most<00:00:33.870> mason<00:00:34.350> jars<00:00:34.530> the

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
if you know this but most mason jars the

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.470 
if you know this but most mason jars the
standard<00:00:35.190> lids<00:00:35.430> on<00:00:35.610> mason<00:00:35.969> jars<00:00:36.180> are

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
standard lids on mason jars are

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.840 
standard lids on mason jars are
compatible<00:00:37.140> with<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.620> bottom<00:00:38.010> blender

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
compatible with the bottom blender

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.090 
compatible with the bottom blender
mechanisms<00:00:39.390> on<00:00:39.540> most<00:00:39.780> blenders<00:00:40.110> so<00:00:40.829> what<00:00:40.980> I've

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
mechanisms on most blenders so what I've

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.389 
mechanisms on most blenders so what I've
been<00:00:41.219> doing<00:00:41.520> is<00:00:42.360> I<00:00:42.629> got<00:00:43.320> my<00:00:43.770> standard<00:00:43.980> mason

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
been doing is I got my standard mason

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.369 
been doing is I got my standard mason
jar<00:00:44.550> that's<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:45.030> wrong<00:00:45.180> side<00:00:45.360> so<00:00:45.570> this<00:00:46.230> one

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
jar that's the wrong side so this one

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.260 
jar that's the wrong side so this one
lets<00:00:46.590> me<00:00:46.710> measure<00:00:46.950> out<00:00:47.219> how<00:00:47.550> much<00:00:47.670> milk<00:00:47.940> I<00:00:48.059> put
