00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
know what it is but he doesn't really

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.160 
know what it is but he doesn't really
feel<00:01:13.890> like<00:01:13.950> that<00:01:14.250> much<00:01:14.490> more<00:01:14.900> we<00:01:15.900> got<00:01:16.020> our

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
feel like that much more we got our

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.480 
feel like that much more we got our
MagSafe<00:01:16.740> power<00:01:16.770> brick<00:01:17.900> and<00:01:18.900> these<00:01:19.200> are<00:01:19.500> fairly

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
MagSafe power brick and these are fairly

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.570 
MagSafe power brick and these are fairly
ubiquitous<00:01:20.970> they<00:01:21.420> all<00:01:21.570> look<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.840> same<00:01:22.580> across

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
ubiquitous they all look the same across

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.690 
ubiquitous they all look the same across
the<00:01:23.700> entire<00:01:24.150> macbook<00:01:24.780> product<00:01:25.259> line<00:01:25.439> but<00:01:25.770> they

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
the entire macbook product line but they

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.490 
the entire macbook product line but they
are<00:01:26.909> different<00:01:27.240> because<00:01:27.720> they<00:01:28.049> supply

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
are different because they supply

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.520 
are different because they supply
different<00:01:28.740> amounts<00:01:29.220> of<00:01:29.340> power<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:30.530> these

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
different amounts of power and these

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.440 
different amounts of power and these
sizes<00:01:31.770> are<00:01:32.220> a<00:01:32.460> little<00:01:32.700> bit<00:01:32.939> different<00:01:33.150> too

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
sizes are a little bit different too

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.830 
sizes are a little bit different too
depending<00:01:33.960> on<00:01:34.850> which<00:01:35.850> macbook<00:01:36.360> we're<00:01:36.509> talking

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
depending on which macbook we're talking

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.530 
depending on which macbook we're talking
about<00:01:37.250> but<00:01:38.250> what's<00:01:38.430> nice<00:01:38.610> about<00:01:38.640> these<00:01:39.150> is

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
about but what's nice about these is

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.770 
about but what's nice about these is
they<00:01:39.659> have<00:01:39.810> this<00:01:40.020> removable<00:01:41.270> prong<00:01:42.270> system

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
they have this removable prong system

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.710 
they have this removable prong system
here<00:01:42.960> so<00:01:43.170> you<00:01:43.229> can<00:01:43.500> pop<00:01:44.009> that<00:01:44.189> baby<00:01:44.490> off<00:01:44.790> and

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
here so you can pop that baby off and

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.270 
here so you can pop that baby off and
use<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.110> extension<00:01:46.710> if<00:01:46.860> you<00:01:46.950> need<00:01:47.100> to<00:01:47.189> be

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
use the extension if you need to be

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.030 
use the extension if you need to be
further<00:01:47.549> away<00:01:47.820> from<00:01:47.850> the<00:01:48.090> outlet<00:01:48.479> or<00:01:49.049> you<00:01:49.860> can

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
further away from the outlet or you can

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.719 
further away from the outlet or you can
leave<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.399> extension<00:01:50.939> at<00:01:51.060> home<00:01:51.299> and<00:01:52.670> travel<00:01:53.670> a

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
leave the extension at home and travel a

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.330 
leave the extension at home and travel a
little<00:01:53.850> bit<00:01:54.000> lighter<00:01:54.890> so<00:01:55.890> it's<00:01:56.009> nice<00:01:56.159> to<00:01:56.189> have

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
little bit lighter so it's nice to have

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.090 
little bit lighter so it's nice to have
that<00:01:56.579> option<00:01:56.790> and<00:01:57.240> PC<00:01:58.110> manufacturers<00:01:58.799> haven't

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
that option and PC manufacturers haven't

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.740 
that option and PC manufacturers haven't
really<00:01:59.250> figured<00:01:59.460> that<00:01:59.729> one<00:01:59.880> out<00:02:00.030> yet<00:02:00.090> I<00:02:00.509> don't

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
really figured that one out yet I don't

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.749 
really figured that one out yet I don't
know<00:02:00.899> why<00:02:01.850> anyway<00:02:02.850> we've<00:02:03.090> got<00:02:03.119> our<00:02:03.649> actual

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:04.759 
know why anyway we've got our actual

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:06.920 
know why anyway we've got our actual
MagSafe<00:02:05.759> portion<00:02:06.329> and<00:02:06.509> that's<00:02:06.659> been

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
MagSafe portion and that's been

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.570 
MagSafe portion and that's been
redesigned<00:02:07.439> for<00:02:07.590> a<00:02:07.649> while<00:02:07.890> now<00:02:08.099> I<00:02:08.340> actually

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
redesigned for a while now I actually

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.040 
redesigned for a while now I actually
had<00:02:08.789> some<00:02:08.940> older<00:02:09.209> Mac<00:02:09.390> books<00:02:09.660> with<00:02:09.869> the

whole set up sequence but I'll show you
guys<00:03:36.570> the<00:03:36.810> first<00:03:37.019> boot<00:03:37.410> nonetheless<00:03:39.980> you<00:03:40.980> can

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
guys the first boot nonetheless you can

get a look at the keyboard here too and
it's<00:03:42.870> a<00:03:42.930> nice<00:03:43.110> size<00:03:43.140> when<00:03:43.739> you<00:03:43.830> consider<00:03:44.160> the

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
it's a nice size when you consider the

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.300 
it's a nice size when you consider the
overall<00:03:45.000> size<00:03:45.239> of<00:03:45.390> the<00:03:45.450> laptop<00:03:46.070> so<00:03:47.070> there<00:03:47.220> we

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
overall size of the laptop so there we

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:53.320 
overall size of the laptop so there we
are<00:03:47.370> that's<00:03:47.730> that<00:03:47.910> first<00:03:48.150> boot<00:03:49.070> virgin<00:03:50.070> boot

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:53.330 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.100 

anyway<00:03:54.330> I'm<00:03:54.450> not<00:03:54.480> gonna<00:03:54.660> do<00:03:54.900> the<00:03:55.080> whole

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
anyway I'm not gonna do the whole

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:56.960 
anyway I'm not gonna do the whole
complete<00:03:55.709> set<00:03:55.950> up<00:03:56.070> but<00:03:56.220> at<00:03:56.310> least<00:03:56.459> you<00:03:56.640> can<00:03:56.790> see

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970 
complete set up but at least you can see

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:58.430 
complete set up but at least you can see
how<00:03:57.090> quickly<00:03:57.360> it<00:03:57.510> boots<00:03:57.810> the<00:03:57.989> first<00:03:58.200> time

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
how quickly it boots the first time

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.910 
how quickly it boots the first time
around

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
around

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.810 
around
now<00:03:59.700> it<00:04:00.030> should<00:04:00.360> speed<00:04:00.750> up<00:04:01.370> after<00:04:02.370> the<00:04:02.459> initial

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
now it should speed up after the initial

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:04.370 
now it should speed up after the initial
boot<00:04:03.000> because<00:04:03.150> there's<00:04:03.480> all<00:04:03.600> that<00:04:03.630> setup

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:04.380 
boot because there's all that setup

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:07.040 
boot because there's all that setup
going<00:04:04.709> on<00:04:04.800> but<00:04:05.510> you're<00:04:06.510> not<00:04:06.660> really<00:04:06.900> gonna

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.050 
going on but you're not really gonna

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:08.570 
going on but you're not really gonna
shut<00:04:07.320> this<00:04:07.470> thing<00:04:07.530> down<00:04:07.739> too<00:04:08.160> much<00:04:08.310> because

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:08.580 
shut this thing down too much because

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.460 
shut this thing down too much because
it's<00:04:08.820> got<00:04:08.970> that<00:04:09.150> instant-on<00:04:09.900> kind<00:04:10.230> of<00:04:10.320> thing

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
it's got that instant-on kind of thing

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.770 
it's got that instant-on kind of thing
where<00:04:10.620> you<00:04:10.650> pop<00:04:10.980> the<00:04:11.250> lid<00:04:11.519> up<00:04:12.360> and<00:04:12.600> you're

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
where you pop the lid up and you're

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.250 
where you pop the lid up and you're
right<00:04:13.140> into<00:04:13.470> the<00:04:13.590> OS<00:04:13.920> so<00:04:14.780> it's<00:04:15.780> not<00:04:15.930> gonna<00:04:16.049> be<00:04:16.229> a

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:16.260 
right into the OS so it's not gonna be a

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.020 
right into the OS so it's not gonna be a
real<00:04:16.470> issue<00:04:16.709> waiting<00:04:17.280> the<00:04:17.370> boot<00:04:17.580> I<00:04:17.820> don't

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:18.030 
real issue waiting the boot I don't

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.880 
real issue waiting the boot I don't
think<00:04:19.070> so<00:04:20.070> you<00:04:20.160> have<00:04:20.340> it<00:04:21.320> time<00:04:22.320> to<00:04:22.470> get<00:04:22.620> close
