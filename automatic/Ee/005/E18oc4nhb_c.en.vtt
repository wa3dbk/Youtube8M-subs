here at HC bar seat and Paul I'll turn

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.130 
here at HC bar seat and Paul I'll turn
it<00:02:27.980> over<00:02:28.099> to<00:02:28.280> you<00:02:28.459> what's<00:02:28.840> tell<00:02:29.840> me<00:02:29.959> about<00:02:30.050> the

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
it over to you what's tell me about the

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.840 
it over to you what's tell me about the
south<00:02:30.790> well<00:02:31.790> the<00:02:32.000> cell<00:02:32.270> was<00:02:33.550> loosely<00:02:34.550> designed

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
south well the cell was loosely designed

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:37.390 
south well the cell was loosely designed
to<00:02:35.420> fit<00:02:35.660> a<00:02:35.690> horse<00:02:36.020> that's<00:02:36.260> got<00:02:36.560> really<00:02:37.130> baked

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
to fit a horse that's got really baked

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.320 
to fit a horse that's got really baked
shoulder<00:02:38.830> had<00:02:39.830> a<00:02:39.860> hard<00:02:40.130> time<00:02:40.209> getting<00:02:41.209> that

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
shoulder had a hard time getting that

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.979 
shoulder had a hard time getting that
standards<00:02:42.110> out<00:02:42.459> to<00:02:43.459> fit<00:02:43.930> and<00:02:44.930> so<00:02:45.530> dave<00:02:46.519> was

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
standards out to fit and so dave was

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:50.470 
standards out to fit and so dave was
asked<00:02:47.989> to<00:02:48.160> fit<00:02:49.160> the<00:02:49.370> whoreson<00:02:49.910> so<00:02:50.150> we<00:02:50.269> got<00:02:50.450> a

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
asked to fit the whoreson so we got a

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.229 
asked to fit the whoreson so we got a
tree<00:02:51.110> here<00:02:51.440> that's<00:02:51.709> a<00:02:52.069> little<00:02:52.610> wider<00:02:52.819> in<00:02:53.120> the

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
tree here that's a little wider in the

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:56.530 
tree here that's a little wider in the
villa<00:02:53.450> a<00:02:53.780> little<00:02:54.530> bigger<00:02:54.739> overall<00:02:55.220> than<00:02:55.580> most

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
villa a little bigger overall than most

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.970 
villa a little bigger overall than most
sound<00:02:57.049> trees<00:02:57.410> and<00:02:58.540> we<00:02:59.540> proceeded<00:03:00.019> to<00:03:00.470> build

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
sound trees and we proceeded to build

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.110 
sound trees and we proceeded to build
kind<00:03:01.370> of<00:03:01.430> an<00:03:01.549> old-timey<00:03:02.030> rich<00:03:04.120> associations

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:05.120 
kind of an old-timey rich associations

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:11.100

out<00:03:06.489> the<00:03:07.489> metal<00:03:08.299> stirrups<00:03:09.730> try<00:03:10.730> to<00:03:10.790> make<00:03:11.060> it

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
out the metal stirrups try to make it

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.570 
out the metal stirrups try to make it
hope<00:03:12.110> he<00:03:12.709> bet<00:03:13.090> very<00:03:14.090> functional<00:03:14.450> very<00:03:14.780> usable
