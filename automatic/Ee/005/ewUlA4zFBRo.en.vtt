hey<00:00:10.469> guys<00:00:10.710> the<00:00:11.010> airsoft<00:00:11.309> tech<00:00:11.550> here<00:00:11.759> and<00:00:11.940> today

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
hey guys the airsoft tech here and today

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.079 
hey guys the airsoft tech here and today
are<00:00:12.780> we<00:00:12.929> talking<00:00:13.200> about<00:00:13.259> Sorbo<00:00:13.830> versus<00:00:14.700> faucet

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
are we talking about Sorbo versus faucet

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.439 
are we talking about Sorbo versus faucet
washer<00:00:15.420> both<00:00:16.410> faucet<00:00:16.890> washers<00:00:17.279> and<00:00:17.520> so

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
washer both faucet washers and so

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.150 
washer both faucet washers and so
methane<00:00:18.779> are<00:00:19.050> used<00:00:19.320> to<00:00:19.500> correct<00:00:19.680> angled

the<00:00:24.900> two<00:00:25.080> of<00:00:25.199> these<00:00:25.350> is<00:00:25.820> their<00:00:26.820> hardness<00:00:27.119> those

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
the two of these is their hardness those

Thayne<00:00:29.760> let's<00:00:30.269> go<00:00:30.420> over<00:00:30.660> it<00:00:30.779> so<00:00:31.289> everything<00:00:31.590> is

not so much

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:34.340

so when using faucet washers remember

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.710 
so when using faucet washers remember
you<00:02:34.620> won't<00:02:34.769> be<00:02:34.860> taking<00:02:35.250> much<00:02:35.430> as<00:02:36.269> much<00:02:36.450> stress

you won't be taking much as much stress

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
now I'm not saying so both aim sucks and

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.710 
now I'm not saying so both aim sucks and
that<00:03:08.400> you<00:03:08.549> don't<00:03:08.730> need<00:03:08.940> in<00:03:09.060> your<00:03:09.090> gearbox<00:03:09.360> show

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
that you don't need in your gearbox show

that you don't need in your gearbox show
which<00:03:10.079> is<00:03:10.230> true<00:03:10.380> you<00:03:10.470> don't<00:03:10.620> need<00:03:10.799> in<00:03:10.950> your

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
which is true you don't need in your

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.850 
which is true you don't need in your
gearbox<00:03:11.220> shell<00:03:11.519> but<00:03:12.090> it's<00:03:12.900> not<00:03:13.260> the<00:03:13.470> greatest

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
gearbox shell but it's not the greatest

thing<00:03:14.010> that<00:03:14.040> you<00:03:14.220> want<00:03:14.579> exactly<00:03:14.760> either<00:03:15.360> in<00:03:15.870> my

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:16.079 
thing that you want exactly either in my

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:18.289 
thing that you want exactly either in my
opinion<00:03:16.440> faucet<00:03:16.860> washers<00:03:17.280> just<00:03:17.579> last<00:03:17.940> longer

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
opinion faucet washers just last longer

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:20.390 
opinion faucet washers just last longer
and<00:03:18.540> they<00:03:18.630> helped<00:03:18.840> to<00:03:18.870> reduce<00:03:19.380> the<00:03:20.040> stress<00:03:20.310> on

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
and they helped to reduce the stress on

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.280 
and they helped to reduce the stress on
the<00:03:20.459> gearbox<00:03:20.670> show<00:03:20.940> pretty<00:03:21.150> well<00:03:21.420> in<00:03:21.630> addition

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
the gearbox show pretty well in addition

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.550 
the gearbox show pretty well in addition
keeping<00:03:22.799> the<00:03:22.890> AOE<00:03:23.220> on<00:03:23.700> point<00:03:24.329> so<00:03:24.900> I<00:03:25.200> typically

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
keeping the AOE on point so I typically

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.380 
keeping the AOE on point so I typically
find<00:03:25.829> myself<00:03:25.980> using<00:03:26.220> foster<00:03:26.760> washers<00:03:27.090> almost

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:27.390

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:30.349 
find myself using foster washers almost
always<00:03:27.660> I<00:03:28.230> do<00:03:28.590> however<00:03:28.950> use<00:03:29.400> Sorbo<00:03:30.120> Thane<00:03:30.329> and

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:30.359 
always I do however use Sorbo Thane and

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:32.800

00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:38.129 
know plenty now I'm not saying the sort

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:39.470

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
in your gearbox show because it's a good

but<00:03:42.700> you<00:03:42.760> don't<00:03:42.880> need<00:03:43.180> it<00:03:43.480> fossa<00:03:43.840> Watchers<00:03:44.380> can

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:44.560

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.860 
but you don't need it fossa Watchers can
really<00:03:44.890> do<00:03:45.400> just<00:03:45.640> about<00:03:45.820> the<00:03:45.970> same<00:03:46.180> thing<00:03:46.420> they

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
really do just about the same thing they

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.390
