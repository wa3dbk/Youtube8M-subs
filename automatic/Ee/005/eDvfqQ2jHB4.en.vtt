00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:05.880
 welcome to another 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.170
 line tutorial that was already 

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.150
 announced because I had the last 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.629
 I'll show you how 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.690
 folder outside of lightroom 

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:15.429
 could move 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.680
 and then you in lines again 

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:20.289
 can insert because I had said yes 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:23.220
 It usually does not work when I am 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:26.539
 now here's the folder cut out 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.539
 and insert it here now 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.500
 then say sorry about the pictures are 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.610
 not existent 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.290
 and 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.050
 if i'm a developer module 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.670
 change then 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.170
 is also no longer rendered and 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.770
 I can not do anything here anymore 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.770
 to edit 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:49.740
 good also here if the pictures now as 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:52.010
 missing displayed 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:55.010
 there are multiple possibilities 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:57.920
 to do that one would be new to the pictures 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.449
 to import that would be the least favorable 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.230
 Variation because we would the 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:03.550
 Lose caption of the folder 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:05.320
 A new folder will be created here 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.790
 and not this folder anymore 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.670
 be used 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:13.110
 And the files would also be your names 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.430
 to lose 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.450
 So I'll do it again 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:22.070
 cut out undo 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.479
 insert so shoupp are back and 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:27.360
 Now I want these pictures in one 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:30.329
 Move to another catalog 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.060
 i have two options the first one is me 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:36.810
 just sync 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:39.509
 in the new catalog the pictures into it 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.659
 I take the pictures cut 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.030
 she out 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:44.469
 I can do that with several folders 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.490
 do it at the same time does not have to 

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:48.100
 only one is here now 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.719
 as an example, say others now 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.080
 Photoshootings and I would like to see you 

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:54.300
 have in here 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.650
 yes the picture is known to us now 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.920
 I also say remove 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:58.730
 Yes 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.290
 O 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:02.290
 Now I changed my catalog 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:08.110
 I have an extra catalog for this 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.110
 created 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.709
 lightroom needs to change for each catalog 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:15.690
 start anew 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:17.160
 and now the pictures are in 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.640
 same main directory and now you can 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.640
 I simply say 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.319
 partner synchrony 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.739
 Now he tells me two new photos 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:25.739
 import 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:28.870
 and pretty 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:31.700
 me the folder 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.709
 with the corresponding ones 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.209
 photos 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:37.709
 sync everything into me that can 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:40.620
 I also later on it walls and 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:42.989
 say say this folder now 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:46.250
 if I sync it right now 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:46.250
 because it would have been included 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.030
 yes I can now the pictures again 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:53.030
 to edit 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:59.850
 remind her too 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:02.730
 the picture is sharp 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.770
 and we can do that again now 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:07.670
 after ours 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.670
 imaginations 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.909
 to edit 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.909
 Well 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:20.800
 that would be the one possibility over the 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.730
 synchronization function the other 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.470
 possibility would be 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:28.760
 we simply export 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:30.890
 the pictures as a catalog and 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.910
 Import the pictures into another 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.800
 catalog again 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:37.580
 This is how we say 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.580
 this folder here 

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:45.230
 export this folder as a catalog 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:50.739
 then he asks us where I am going to say now 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:54.879
 just go here and just say export 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:54.879
 so he puts me on a folder now 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.200
 and just this 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.819
 I can say both pictures now 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:03.370
 remove 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:06.030
 Yes 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:08.990
 change the catalog again 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.990
 to my 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:14.420
 original tutorial catalog 

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:20.550
 and just say it now 

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:26.240
 import from another catalog 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:31.070
 Here I have exported and yes 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.960
 just say open now 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:34.880
 crawl dialog and just say it now 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.930
 I'll just set and so 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.930
 just say import 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:46.730
 Of course, now I have that 

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:46.730
 complete folder structure with 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:52.660
 I can now take that export 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:52.660
 move back 

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:57.940
 away for you saying 

00:04:56.020 --> 00:05:00.160
 and I'm back again I have the 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:01.780
 Images exported from the one 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.100
 catalog and in the other catalogs 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:07.459
 imported 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:09.949
 if you have one 

00:05:07.459 --> 00:05:12.689
 wanted to make structural changes 

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:14.969
 archiving strategy is that now 

00:05:12.689 --> 00:05:17.249
 a possibility quick and easy 

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:21.169
 his pictures for a catalog in the 

00:05:17.249 --> 00:05:21.169
 other catalog to push back and forth 

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:26.740
 It was again that was a small one 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.740
 kick tip from me 

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:33.370
 I'm so far out 

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:36.280
 and if you also like to see you 

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:37.750
 next time should be there to ask 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:40.300
 Of course that could be in the 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:42.930
 Write comments provided me 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:47.410
 possible to answer these questions 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:49.930
 I will do that and maybe one 

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:51.820
 make video I believe the video 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:53.480
 something most suitable to them 

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:56.080
 to show when it 

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:57.699
 whatever you write it down 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:00.930
 Well, now I'm out and if you 

00:05:57.699 --> 00:06:00.930
 would like to see you next time
