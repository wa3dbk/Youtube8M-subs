them from moving back and forth like

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.849 
them from moving back and forth like
this<00:00:26.580> so<00:00:27.029> that<00:00:27.179> when<00:00:27.269> the<00:00:27.359> dog<00:00:27.509> stands<00:00:28.109> the<00:00:28.679> leg

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
this so that when the dog stands the leg

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.159 
this so that when the dog stands the leg
stays<00:00:29.160> stable<00:00:29.490> so<00:00:30.390> we've<00:00:30.509> got<00:00:30.660> this<00:00:30.779> model

00:00:31.159 --> 00:00:31.169 
stays stable so we've got this model

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:33.800 
stays stable so we've got this model
here<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:32.070> cruciate<00:00:32.340> ligament<00:00:32.760> prevents<00:00:33.180> that

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:33.810 
here the cruciate ligament prevents that

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:40.010 
here the cruciate ligament prevents that
from<00:00:33.870> happening<00:00:34.490> in<00:00:35.490> this<00:00:36.330> model<00:00:36.750> I<00:00:39.020> can

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
from happening in this model I can

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.230 
from happening in this model I can
advance<00:00:40.650> it<00:00:40.950> because<00:00:41.280> I've<00:00:41.430> got<00:00:41.610> a<00:00:41.640> torn

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:42.240 
advance it because I've got a torn

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.690 
advance it because I've got a torn
ligament<00:00:42.390> in<00:00:42.720> there<00:00:42.900> and<00:00:43.460> when<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.550> dog

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
ligament in there and when the dog

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.270 
ligament in there and when the dog
stands<00:00:45.420> this<00:00:45.930> bone<00:00:46.260> wants<00:00:46.680> to<00:00:46.800> fall<00:00:46.980> off<00:00:47.130> the

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
stands this bone wants to fall off the

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.450 
stands this bone wants to fall off the
backside<00:00:47.700> of<00:00:47.760> this<00:00:48.150> bone<00:00:48.360> like<00:00:49.260> that<00:00:49.290> and<00:00:49.740> the

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
backside of this bone like that and the

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:51.590 
backside of this bone like that and the
cruciate<00:00:50.730> ligament<00:00:51.120> prevents<00:00:51.420> that<00:00:51.540> from

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
cruciate ligament prevents that from

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.990 
cruciate ligament prevents that from
happening<00:00:51.750> so<00:00:52.380> the<00:00:52.770> goal<00:00:53.130> of<00:00:53.310> the<00:00:53.400> surgery<00:00:53.820> is

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
happening so the goal of the surgery is

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.790 
happening so the goal of the surgery is
to<00:00:54.210> provide<00:00:54.450> stabilization<00:00:55.140> of<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.590> knee

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
to provide stabilization of the knee

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.340 
to provide stabilization of the knee
joint<00:00:55.830> so<00:00:56.640> that<00:00:56.790> the<00:00:56.880> dog<00:00:57.030> can<00:00:57.240> stand<00:00:57.720> walk<00:00:58.110> and

is<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:10.009> tangent<00:02:11.009> on<00:02:11.160> the<00:02:11.250> curve<00:02:11.490> it's<00:02:11.850> called

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
is the tangent on the curve it's called

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.199 
is the tangent on the curve it's called

procedures<00:02:18.180> for<00:02:18.470> stabilizing<00:02:19.470> the<00:02:19.770> knee<00:02:19.920> of

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
procedures for stabilizing the knee of

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:23.870 
procedures for stabilizing the knee of
the<00:02:20.160> dog<00:02:21.120> and<00:02:21.390> the<00:02:21.480> TTA<00:02:22.400> procedure<00:02:23.400> is<00:02:23.580> one<00:02:23.730> of

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
the dog and the TTA procedure is one of

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.850 
the dog and the TTA procedure is one of
the<00:02:24.000> newer<00:02:24.840> ones<00:02:24.959> it's<00:02:25.380> considered

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
the newer ones it's considered

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.220 
the newer ones it's considered
state-of-the-art<00:02:26.100> and<00:02:26.670> we've<00:02:27.480> had<00:02:27.720> fantastic

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
state-of-the-art and we've had fantastic

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.680 
state-of-the-art and we've had fantastic
success<00:02:28.890> here<00:02:29.340> so<00:02:29.670> at<00:02:30.180> the<00:02:30.330> end<00:02:30.450> of<00:02:30.540> the<00:02:30.600> day

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
stable leg when they stand walk and run

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.610 
stable leg when they stand walk and run
they<00:02:35.340> have<00:02:35.730> less<00:02:36.090> pain<00:02:36.390> actually<00:02:36.989> right<00:02:37.230> after

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
they have less pain actually right after

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.170 
they have less pain actually right after
surgery<00:02:37.800> they<00:02:38.220> get<00:02:38.550> up<00:02:38.670> and<00:02:38.790> are<00:02:38.880> walking

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.780 
with medicine so we give them a good leg
to<00:02:47.730> use<00:02:47.940> and<00:02:48.300> they<00:02:48.690> go<00:02:48.840> back<00:02:49.019> to<00:02:49.290> having<00:02:49.830> a<00:02:50.190> life
