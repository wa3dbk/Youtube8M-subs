that's Terrence capes comm you know that

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.070 
that's Terrence capes comm you know that
I<00:00:23.369> don't<00:00:23.460> list<00:00:23.820> any<00:00:24.060> of<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.300> kits<00:00:24.539> from<00:00:24.750> Hirst

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
I don't list any of the kits from Hirst

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.620 
I don't list any of the kits from Hirst
arts<00:00:25.289> until<00:00:25.740> I<00:00:25.769> build<00:00:26.130> it<00:00:26.279> myself<00:00:26.760> primarily

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
arts until I build it myself primarily

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.599 
arts until I build it myself primarily
so<00:00:28.170> I<00:00:28.199> can<00:00:28.470> get<00:00:28.590> a<00:00:28.619> judge<00:00:28.949> of<00:00:29.160> its<00:00:29.310> level<00:00:29.550> of

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
so I can get a judge of its level of

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.389 
so I can get a judge of its level of
complexity<00:00:30.060> and<00:00:30.920> then<00:00:31.920> I<00:00:32.009> can<00:00:32.160> price<00:00:32.369> it

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
complexity and then I can price it

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.340 
complexity and then I can price it
accordingly<00:00:32.610> as<00:00:33.210> a<00:00:33.239> finished<00:00:33.630> piece<00:00:33.930> but<00:00:34.200> also

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
accordingly as a finished piece but also

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.680 
accordingly as a finished piece but also
so<00:00:34.739> that<00:00:34.920> I<00:00:34.950> can<00:00:35.280> see<00:00:35.969> if<00:00:36.090> there<00:00:36.239> are<00:00:36.270> any<00:00:36.329> tips

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690

or or tricks or improvements that I
could<00:00:39.329> add<00:00:39.510> to<00:00:39.809> it<00:00:39.950> so<00:00:40.950> or<00:00:41.250> that<00:00:41.550> I<00:00:41.640> can<00:00:41.850> support

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
people who are building it you could

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.720 
people who are building it you could
always<00:00:43.440> give<00:00:43.649> me<00:00:43.739> a<00:00:43.770> call<00:00:43.829> if<00:00:44.219> you<00:00:44.280> buy<00:00:44.460> one<00:00:44.700> of

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
is the dragon in or the Dragons in I

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.779 
is the dragon in or the Dragons in I
forget<00:00:54.629> what<00:00:54.780> she<00:00:54.870> calls<00:00:55.110> it<00:00:55.320> and<00:00:55.760> when<00:00:56.760> I

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
forget what she calls it and when I

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.340 
forget what she calls it and when I
first<00:00:57.120> looked<00:00:57.329> at<00:00:57.390> this<00:00:57.510> kit<00:00:57.750> I<00:00:57.899> didn't<00:00:58.109> really

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
first looked at this kit I didn't really

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.139 
first looked at this kit I didn't really
think<00:00:58.379> it<00:00:59.160> was<00:00:59.309> going<00:00:59.489> to<00:00:59.550> be<00:00:59.640> very<00:00:59.820> impressive

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
think it was going to be very impressive

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.360 
think it was going to be very impressive
in<00:01:00.480> fact<00:01:00.690> I've<00:01:00.899> had<00:01:01.050> this<00:01:01.230> mold<00:01:01.500> for<00:01:01.829> probably

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
in fact I've had this mold for probably

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.189 
in fact I've had this mold for probably
almost<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:02.940> better<00:01:03.090> part<00:01:03.329> of<00:01:03.359> two<00:01:03.570> years<00:01:03.989> and

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
almost a better part of two years and

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.010 
almost a better part of two years and
have<00:01:04.769> not<00:01:04.949> released<00:01:05.339> it<00:01:05.700> as<00:01:05.880> a<00:01:05.909> kit<00:01:06.420> because<00:01:06.869> I

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
have not released it as a kit because I

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.020 
have not released it as a kit because I
kept<00:01:07.290> putting<00:01:07.560> off<00:01:07.650> building<00:01:08.159> it<00:01:08.250> and<00:01:08.400> I<00:01:08.880> have

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
kept putting off building it and I have

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.210 
kept putting off building it and I have
to<00:01:09.210> say<00:01:09.390> that<00:01:09.630> once<00:01:09.960> I<00:01:10.170> put<00:01:10.439> this<00:01:10.590> together<00:01:10.799> I

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
to say that once I put this together I

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.100 
to say that once I put this together I
was<00:01:12.090> pretty<00:01:12.299> impressed<00:01:12.450> with<00:01:12.869> it

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
was pretty impressed with it

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.410 
was pretty impressed with it
this<00:01:13.260> is<00:01:13.380> one<00:01:13.530> of<00:01:13.650> his<00:01:13.740> earlier<00:01:14.070> kits<00:01:14.430> so<00:01:15.240> it's

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
this is one of his earlier kits so it's

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.840 
this is one of his earlier kits so it's
not<00:01:15.570> necessarily<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.680> most<00:01:16.830> complicated<00:01:17.430> in

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
not necessarily the most complicated in

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.270 
not necessarily the most complicated in
terms<00:01:17.880> of<00:01:18.240> its<00:01:18.390> overall<00:01:18.750> design<00:01:19.040> but<00:01:20.040> I<00:01:20.070> will

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
terms of its overall design but I will

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.620 
terms of its overall design but I will
say<00:01:20.460> it<00:01:20.580> did<00:01:20.729> take<00:01:20.880> me<00:01:20.909> quite<00:01:21.299> a<00:01:21.330> while<00:01:21.450> to

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
say it did take me quite a while to

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.920 
say it did take me quite a while to
assemble<00:01:22.409> it<00:01:22.759> because<00:01:23.759> it<00:01:23.939> features<00:01:24.330> some

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
assemble it because it features some

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.960 
assemble it because it features some
interior<00:01:25.320> layout<00:01:25.799> that<00:01:26.250> adds<00:01:26.549> a<00:01:26.700> little<00:01:26.850> bit

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
interior layout that adds a little bit

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.700 
interior layout that adds a little bit
of<00:01:27.210> complexity<00:01:27.750> let's<00:01:28.049> take<00:01:28.200> the<00:01:28.320> roof<00:01:28.500> off

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
of complexity let's take the roof off

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.950 
of complexity let's take the roof off
and<00:01:28.829> you<00:01:28.920> can<00:01:29.100> see<00:01:29.420> so<00:01:30.420> it's<00:01:30.600> got<00:01:30.810> this

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
and you can see so it's got this

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.350 
and you can see so it's got this
interior<00:01:31.829> wall<00:01:32.130> here<00:01:32.430> that<00:01:32.610> sets<00:01:32.820> in<00:01:33.030> so<00:01:33.210> it's

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
interior wall here that sets in so it's

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.350 
interior wall here that sets in so it's
got<00:01:33.509> to<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:34.470> sort<00:01:34.829> of<00:01:34.890> room<00:01:35.220> areas<00:01:35.820> if<00:01:36.030> you<00:01:36.150> will

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
got to to sort of room areas if you will

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.429 
got to to sort of room areas if you will
features<00:01:37.200> a<00:01:37.310> fireplace<00:01:38.310> and<00:01:39.049> several<00:01:40.049> windows

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
features a fireplace and several windows

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:43.460 
features a fireplace and several windows
and<00:01:40.909> two<00:01:41.909> sections<00:01:42.420> of<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.689> roof<00:01:42.899> line<00:01:43.049> and

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
and two sections of the roof line and

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.380 
and two sections of the roof line and
getting<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.280> roof<00:01:44.430> line<00:01:44.640> actually<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.210> match

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
getting the roof line actually to match

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.020 
getting the roof line actually to match
up<00:01:45.689> so<00:01:45.720> that<00:01:46.110> I<00:01:46.140> got<00:01:46.409> a<00:01:46.439> good<00:01:46.649> seam<00:01:47.040> on<00:01:47.310> it<00:01:47.460> took

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
up so that I got a good seam on it took

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.179 
up so that I got a good seam on it took
me<00:01:48.210> a<00:01:48.509> little<00:01:49.020> bit<00:01:49.110> longer<00:01:49.350> than<00:01:49.590> I<00:01:49.680> expected

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
me a little bit longer than I expected

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.740 
me a little bit longer than I expected
as<00:01:50.310> well<00:01:50.520> see<00:01:50.850> if<00:01:50.939> I<00:01:51.000> can<00:01:51.119> put<00:01:51.270> that<00:01:51.360> back<00:01:51.540> on

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
as well see if I can put that back on

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.960 
as well see if I can put that back on
there<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.229> show<00:01:52.439> you<00:01:52.700> you<00:01:53.700> know<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:53.880> real

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
there and show you you know the real

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.969 
there and show you you know the real
trick<00:01:54.270> is<00:01:54.420> getting<00:01:54.630> this<00:01:54.899> part<00:01:55.200> to<00:01:55.409> line<00:01:55.799> up

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
trick is getting this part to line up

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.230 
trick is getting this part to line up
with<00:01:56.159> a<00:01:56.189> nice<00:01:56.369> tight<00:01:56.640> seam<00:01:56.909> without

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
with a nice tight seam without

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.319 
with a nice tight seam without
overlapping<00:01:57.780> and<00:01:58.670> sanding<00:01:59.670> those<00:01:59.850> bits<00:02:00.090> to

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
overlapping and sanding those bits to

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.010 
overlapping and sanding those bits to
end<00:02:00.479> up<00:02:00.659> that<00:02:00.840> that<00:02:01.020> finish<00:02:01.439> is<00:02:02.399> a<00:02:03.180> little<00:02:03.899> bit

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
end up that that finish is a little bit

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.929 
end up that that finish is a little bit
tricky<00:02:04.290> and<00:02:04.530> so<00:02:05.130> what<00:02:05.340> I've<00:02:05.460> done<00:02:05.579> is<00:02:05.790> I've

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
tricky and so what I've done is I've

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.800 
tricky and so what I've done is I've
used<00:02:06.210> his<00:02:07.069> wood<00:02:08.069> shingle<00:02:08.459> mold<00:02:08.670> for<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:09.629> roof

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
used his wood shingle mold for the roof

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.309 
used his wood shingle mold for the roof
line<00:02:10.080> and<00:02:10.319> then

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:11.319 
line and then

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:15.300 
line and then
it<00:02:11.590> gets<00:02:11.860> mounted<00:02:12.580> to<00:02:13.560> corrugated<00:02:14.560> board<00:02:14.769> with

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
it gets mounted to corrugated board with

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.339 
it gets mounted to corrugated board with
some<00:02:15.610> foam<00:02:15.879> core<00:02:16.209> supports<00:02:16.750> to<00:02:16.900> give<00:02:17.049> it<00:02:17.140> some

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349 
some foam core supports to give it some

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:21.899 
some foam core supports to give it some
structural<00:02:17.860> rigidity<00:02:19.080> the<00:02:20.459> dragons<00:02:21.459> in<00:02:21.610> fee

00:02:21.899 --> 00:02:21.909 
structural rigidity the dragons in fee

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:23.520 
structural rigidity the dragons in fee
is<00:02:22.060> about<00:02:22.390> eight<00:02:22.629> inches<00:02:22.959> by<00:02:23.290> the<00:02:23.319> eight

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
is about eight inches by the eight

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.640 
is about eight inches by the eight
inches<00:02:23.890> by<00:02:24.099> about<00:02:24.340> six<00:02:24.700> inches<00:02:25.000> tall<00:02:25.470> so<00:02:26.470> it's

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
inches by about six inches tall so it's

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.229 
inches by about six inches tall so it's
a<00:02:26.739> fairly<00:02:27.040> substantial<00:02:27.250> piece<00:02:27.819> when<00:02:28.030> you<00:02:28.060> pick

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
a fairly substantial piece when you pick

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:30.500 
a fairly substantial piece when you pick
it<00:02:28.330> up<00:02:28.420> in<00:02:28.569> your<00:02:28.690> hand<00:02:28.900> when<00:02:29.739> I<00:02:29.769> finish<00:02:30.129> it<00:02:30.160> I

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
it up in your hand when I finish it I

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.600 
it up in your hand when I finish it I
include<00:02:31.510> doors<00:02:31.810> the<00:02:32.739> doors<00:02:32.980> are<00:02:33.099> not<00:02:33.220> included

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
include doors the doors are not included

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.430 
include doors the doors are not included
in<00:02:33.700> the<00:02:33.849> do-it-yourself<00:02:34.450> kit<00:02:34.690> but<00:02:34.870> when<00:02:35.410> I

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.440 
in the do-it-yourself kit but when I

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.199 
in the do-it-yourself kit but when I
finish<00:02:35.799> it<00:02:35.830> I'm<00:02:36.040> going<00:02:36.190> to<00:02:36.250> put<00:02:36.849> in<00:02:36.940> a<00:02:37.030> couple

00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
double sided so shows on both sides it

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:43.080 
double sided so shows on both sides it
does<00:02:41.049> not<00:02:41.200> open<00:02:41.409> however<00:02:41.920> there's<00:02:42.579> no<00:02:42.670> hinging

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
does not open however there's no hinging

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.069 
does not open however there's no hinging
available<00:02:43.569> on<00:02:43.690> these<00:02:43.900> and<00:02:45.660> because<00:02:46.660> of<00:02:46.900> the

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:47.079 
available on these and because of the

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:50.910 
available on these and because of the
extra<00:02:48.010> you<00:02:48.310> know<00:02:48.400> sort<00:02:48.640> of<00:02:48.670> added<00:02:49.150> on<00:02:49.920> room

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
extra you know sort of added on room

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.559 
extra you know sort of added on room
section<00:02:51.280> it<00:02:51.640> gives<00:02:51.790> it<00:02:51.910> a<00:02:51.970> really<00:02:52.209> nice

dynamic<00:02:52.959> feel<00:02:53.640> again<00:02:54.640> like<00:02:54.819> a<00:02:54.970> like<00:02:55.540> I<00:02:55.569> said

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
dynamic feel again like a like I said

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.930 
dynamic feel again like a like I said
even<00:02:55.959> when<00:02:56.829> I<00:02:56.859> took<00:02:57.099> the<00:02:57.190> photos<00:02:57.519> of<00:02:57.700> it<00:02:57.760> for

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:57.940 
even when I took the photos of it for

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:00.180 
even when I took the photos of it for
the<00:02:58.030> site<00:02:58.269> and<00:02:58.480> I<00:02:59.200> put<00:02:59.410> the<00:02:59.500> photos<00:02:59.829> up<00:02:59.980> it

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
the site and I put the photos up it

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:01.830 
the site and I put the photos up it
still<00:03:00.549> didn't<00:03:00.879> look<00:03:00.940> as<00:03:01.120> impressive<00:03:01.269> in

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
still didn't look as impressive in

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.930 
still didn't look as impressive in
picture<00:03:02.260> as<00:03:02.470> it<00:03:02.739> really<00:03:02.920> does<00:03:03.250> on<00:03:03.489> the

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
picture as it really does on the

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.390 
picture as it really does on the
tabletop<00:03:04.299> so<00:03:04.750> I<00:03:04.959> wanted<00:03:05.620> to<00:03:05.709> sort<00:03:06.040> of<00:03:06.160> make

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
tabletop so I wanted to sort of make

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.670 
tabletop so I wanted to sort of make
sure<00:03:06.970> that<00:03:07.359> I<00:03:07.420> got<00:03:07.510> a<00:03:07.569> video<00:03:07.870> up<00:03:08.079> of<00:03:08.230> it<00:03:08.379> so<00:03:08.560> that

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
sure that I got a video up of it so that

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:11.079 
you could sort of see it in another yet

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:13.110 
you could sort of see it in another yet
another<00:03:11.260> view<00:03:11.590> and<00:03:11.769> get<00:03:12.310> that<00:03:12.459> sense<00:03:12.790> of<00:03:12.940> what

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
another view and get that sense of what

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.509 
another view and get that sense of what
this<00:03:13.269> kit<00:03:13.540> has<00:03:13.750> to<00:03:13.870> offer<00:03:14.340> really<00:03:15.340> quite

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:15.519 
this kit has to offer really quite

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:17.280 
this kit has to offer really quite
pleased<00:03:15.760> with<00:03:15.790> it<00:03:16.120> so<00:03:16.750> there's<00:03:16.930> a<00:03:16.989> few<00:03:17.169> other

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
pleased with it so there's a few other

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:18.780 
pleased with it so there's a few other
molds<00:03:17.709> that<00:03:17.829> I've<00:03:17.919> got<00:03:18.130> that<00:03:18.310> I<00:03:18.370> have<00:03:18.549> yet<00:03:18.760> to

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
molds that I've got that I have yet to

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:21.629 
molds that I've got that I have yet to
assemble<00:03:19.780> and<00:03:19.989> so<00:03:20.440> that's<00:03:21.010> a<00:03:21.099> major<00:03:21.250> goal<00:03:21.519> of

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:21.639 
assemble and so that's a major goal of

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:24.150 
assemble and so that's a major goal of
mine<00:03:21.819> for<00:03:22.060> this<00:03:22.150> year<00:03:22.389> we'll<00:03:22.540> see<00:03:22.720> I've<00:03:23.079> I<00:03:23.440> said

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
mine for this year we'll see I've I said

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.559 
mine for this year we'll see I've I said
a<00:03:24.190> lot<00:03:24.370> of<00:03:24.400> goals<00:03:24.639> and<00:03:24.940> I<00:03:25.000> don't<00:03:25.060> always<00:03:25.269> reach

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:25.569 
a lot of goals and I don't always reach

00:03:25.569 --> 00:03:27.150 
a lot of goals and I don't always reach
them<00:03:25.690> because<00:03:25.989> things<00:03:26.739> have<00:03:26.859> been<00:03:26.919> pretty

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
them because things have been pretty

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.250 
them because things have been pretty
busy<00:03:27.280> around<00:03:27.400> here<00:03:27.730> but<00:03:27.880> but<00:03:28.389> hopefully<00:03:29.139> I'll

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:29.260 
busy around here but but hopefully I'll

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:30.509 
busy around here but but hopefully I'll
be<00:03:29.290> able<00:03:29.410> to<00:03:29.560> release<00:03:29.739> a<00:03:29.799> few<00:03:30.069> more<00:03:30.280> of<00:03:30.400> these

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
be able to release a few more of these

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:33.420 
be able to release a few more of these
and<00:03:30.930> I'm<00:03:31.930> sure<00:03:32.169> I'll<00:03:32.319> be<00:03:32.470> surprised<00:03:32.950> yet<00:03:33.190> again

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:33.430 
and I'm sure I'll be surprised yet again

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.509 
and I'm sure I'll be surprised yet again
by<00:03:33.639> the<00:03:33.700> quality<00:03:34.500> and<00:03:35.500> the<00:03:35.560> interesting
