00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:08.149
 Don read day 

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:12.950
 This time , I would like to explain the difference in the role of arcade cs. 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:16.240
 5 people subjective why I is not even as much as I explain how specific it I'm what I thought 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:20.610
 Well I hope that it will be helpful 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.610
 That Kedomo we will immediately went down to business 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:27.460
 Well, it has become a new case and roll power has been improved 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:27.460
 Have lost 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:36.730
 Thinking that the I mean entering After doing if Toka do not enter now was was why by me 

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:39.960
 I think there are many people who have had 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:39.960
 I also Nde one of them of 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.690
 I mean 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:45.890
 in ac and cs 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.880
 Already 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:53.010
 It's very easy to say that the principle of roll high is different 

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:55.530
 It does not grow out in the same way 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.810
 And say What is the difference 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:03.000
 As you know, ac is the limit 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:06.860
 If Kuwaware a new vibration certain color of praise 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.860
 It is a mechanism to say that it reacts 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:15.350
 Still quite simply 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:19.700
 The lower the lower limit, the better the rebound 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:23.930
 Yes Rutte say though it is I'm an easy-to-understand form 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:28.320
 cs once the sensor 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:29.210
 Although I think that it will be understood if the person who has decomposed and differentiated to the sensor unit 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:34.800
 High 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:37.260
 If there is a side and there is a hall, a current flows and it reacts 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:43.100
 It feels like a switch, isn't it? 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:45.730
 So I Arcade'm such not extend if there are vibrations in OshiPPa 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:50.290
 Know much over here path but 

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:53.350
 There is no reaction that is reacting only to the following . 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:57.840
 To bring in more than 5 groups 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:02:01.770
 It's also good to be slow and it's good if there is a weight on one roll 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:04.310
 In other words, there is a sense of sensor science that opens once 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:08.259
 I like a city road and 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:09.200
 Then go inside this 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:12.560
 Oh dear 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:15.930
 It is amazing confusing Seeing is not deer to look 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.610
 I think I want to go a little to actually words that say 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.480
 Speaking of 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.480
 Please wait a moment 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:30.440
 But this man is I place people in Chico 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:33.810
 About 38 ac well in the body 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:36.000
 Also I'd punishment of about 3839 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:40.380
 In that city 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.100
 I will do a little bit about what happens if I try the same thing with se on Tatakon 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:47.050
 I would like to 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:53.800
 I also think there who say Toka by what you doing to say Toka Tatakon to the tune of your own 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:58.560
 Kedomo story Why this repulsion of the sensor is why say this tree than of course Tata now 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:03:03.660
 Please be careful not to misunderstand that the way of entering is same . 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:07.430
 Let's put it in the arcade and roll it in the arcade and say a little in the arcade 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.430
 I want to roll in here 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:18.569
 Well, I'm expecting growth with this kind of feeling 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:20.870
 I just say what happens if I do it now 

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:22.120
 Bach 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:25.230
 I will 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.230
 What is the aflicun 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.340
 th 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.340
 pr 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.110
 eh 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.800
 Haa 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:39.370
 Yes 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:40.960
 This really goes to No. 38 in the arcade ThatLookLikeThis 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.250
 eh 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:48.050
 Then this time at the arcade 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:50.120
 I would like to do it like it was time to put it in with one move 

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:52.110
 tan tan 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.440
 There was 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:54.440
 Pop 

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:00.569
 ban 

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.569
 Yes, it's such a feeling 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:06.260
 The 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:11.930
 How do I get in ? 

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:13.060
 And a heavy punishment is one shot to Omi I'm a mean girl low may be residents in other words long, as we said 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.250
 I mean 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:21.579
 I like such a drum stick like a feeling 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:21.579
 Wow is nice extremely speaking Oh say rebound 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:29.640
 So I would like to try it a bit 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.640
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:38.449
 It's like this 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:38.449
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:43.350
 It's okay to go for free time 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.830
 Ah ah 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:48.540
 Or do I Na whether he had been feeling great roll 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:50.430
 enter 

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:51.540
 Huh huh huh 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.900
 Ha 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:53.900
 mother 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:59.069
 Yes 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:03.380
 Conversely, if you do this ac, 11 lives 

00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:03.380
 Of course it is better to eat because it takes a long time 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:05.950
 Ah 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:06.720
 There was 

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:09.500
 eh 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.500
 Yes 

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:16.169
 Roughly average Tsu do about 15 or 16 

00:05:15.139 --> 00:05:17.249
 Ah 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:18.529
 Yes 

00:05:17.249 --> 00:05:20.139
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:05:18.529 --> 00:05:22.620

 Yes 

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:27.889
 Ha 

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:31.040
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:38.940
 Even after a minute , the number should grow 

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:40.139
 Mountains that cat in the form of a child 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:43.550
 Yes 

00:05:40.139 --> 00:05:46.270
 2 wii Tachuse even if it is 18 erotic 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:48.070
 It is impossible order but 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:50.569
 Mr. Sakai is 

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:53.050
 Another role very much 

00:05:50.569 --> 00:05:53.050
 I'm doing 

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:58.969
 I agree 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:58.969
 It is such a feeling 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:04.710
 Yes 

00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:06.700
 I hope you understand 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:11.460
 after 

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:14.580
 Here say Jan reflect the Jande w how Ne buy after all in one swing in 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:16.420
 Of course after all it is still 

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:21.510
 Roll day 

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:23.580
 Become I Na or in something this when I do whether I w when you are taking the system 

00:06:21.510 --> 00:06:25.169
 If it was various, it is frozen now 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:29.990
 It is Koike 

00:06:25.169 --> 00:06:33.800
 So when wanting Well obtained in roll to the extent not that slow 

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:35.000
 I'm not doing it many times to beat the blue 

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:39.289
 First hand look- 

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:41.550
 I can not get Ryuzaki quite if I press it 

00:06:39.289 --> 00:06:45.330
 Because 

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:47.020
 I say put but is difficult to get used to Well 

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:52.110
 You can get rid of it 

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:57.920
 Prepare for the next time when putting in and pulling out by repeating the crying 

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:57.920
 Or say in order to also ends have entered even when you are preparing 

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:06.120
 good of the people of roll growth in ac is it was solidified is entering I Zehnder but this is 

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:09.150
 Like people from other people who were already 

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:11.200
 If you do the guy who goes 

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:12.820
 Poop 

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:19.210
 eh 

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:19.210
 Same thing 

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:22.449
 The 

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:27.220
 Goon 

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:30.960
 Bach 

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:35.730
 Well then, it was a movie like feces like this 

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:42.120
 Thank you in prison 

00:07:42.569 --> 00:07:44.779
 Oh 

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:53.000
 Then I ended up being Professor Aso prefecture 

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:53.870
 It finished not you'll is to say it is Tattea of to have finally finished the result is over 

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.729
 Not 

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:59.330
 Perhaps 

00:07:55.729 --> 00:08:01.090
 Nde there to eat but I also do some of Tteyuu has received a level low 

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:05.970
 The other in the future 

00:08:01.090 --> 00:08:05.970
 There we would like to continue the up life beneathｰｰｰ
