00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:56.100
 many topics so that the best 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:58.980
 performance 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.780
 still the lethal effect paste 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.220
 this is a demonstration that is 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:09.000
 placed the demonstration 

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:11.540
 the motion is multiplied by three 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.540
 Really 

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.100
 only to cure the delay 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:26.210
 but comment this 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.210
 so that it goes well 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:35.000
 and we do not know 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.359
 and first of all there are people who ask and 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:45.619
 how can you make it more fluid then here 

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:48.200
 we put here to start and other people 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:50.060
 who does not know about everything about 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.340
 redirect saw games that are put to 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.030
 put it to play without looking or anything like 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.750
 be in addition 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:00.940
 so here in that let halo is like 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:03.130
 you have to go rename it again 

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:07.270
 because when you do the installation that 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:09.789
 comes with the q4 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.980
 so you have to leave like this if it goes 

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:14.819
 inside him 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:21.180
 we have the phone but in my case it would be 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:21.180
 the sdk halo for an sd card 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:27.130
 for the controls 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:29.070
 let me this mac volume this 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.990
 It serves that if you select from the box 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:34.960
 you can shoot and make the clock with 

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:37.360
 the volume buttons as if it were 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:40.340
 triggers if it is already disabled 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:43.640
 I can only play with tactiles 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.560
 then configure the controls that 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:47.660
 you play here and since I have more 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.600
 icon of the normal when you have 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.310
 installed you 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.800
 then in this bar you have to 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:55.569
 clarify is where the rest of 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.749
 the buttons down here 

00:02:55.569 --> 00:03:01.030
 you drag you wait up here and 

00:02:58.749 --> 00:03:03.430
 the noise up here you touch here and the 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:06.459
 you have all here you put it to your 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:12.290
 taste you put the clarity of 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:16.310
 transparency and the volume of large 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:19.000
 and well that we already have done what 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.860
 they are the tactiles to be able to play 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.410
 we go back 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:26.150
 and here we have to in the section 

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:30.349
 graphic is important 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:32.239
 that yes that selections 05 

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:35.470
 yes me that is of enough quality and that 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:38.260
 go to medium fluid medium 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:42.610
 and I advise to stabilize it 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:44.980
 640 x 480 that is playing here and out 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:48.350
 to write it you put it to your 

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:51.160
 unjust taste leave it unfair 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:53.470
 and this will make it go much more fluid 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:56.800
 still so that they go more fluid 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:04:00.310
 still would be to lower his life and 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:02.200
 increase the texture quality that I make 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.350
 He taught how he's going 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:07.400
 and we put the game 

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:10.069
 how do we do what 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:14.250
 more or less with the change 

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:17.130
 the map is made 

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:20.430
 so we know options that 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:22.680
 will be doing to your reader and mind and 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.270
 selecting it then nothing different from 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:26.910
 Start 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:29.069
 stop talking on the channel keep your 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:32.449
 corresponding power some will have 

00:04:29.069 --> 00:04:36.610
 to fly others have to be able to 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:36.610
 the shield and osasuna to be able to 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:42.880
 then having that also in the 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:45.409
 map is has been reduce what fail and 

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:48.019
 be able to play to taste of that map 

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:50.870
 limited the changing willing the 

00:04:48.019 --> 00:04:53.050
 metal sector floor 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:55.790
 so the style 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:58.190
 and that's why we think that 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:05:00.470
 to reduce 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:03.660
 the size of what the map is 

00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:04.980
 it has more to do 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:07.100
 seems to have more for those of 

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:10.160
 investments 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:11.870
 the slow motion is placed 

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:14.020
 here 

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:16.740
 and we put the event 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.740
 but good 

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:21.480
 good 

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:24.890
 plus 

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:24.890
 but it is still difficult 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:31.620
 is that download options 

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:31.620
 and here in this 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:37.510
 the day 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.610
 here 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:42.060
 the one who worked in the loss of work 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:44.500
 for a long time this new 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:52.590
 this will be complete with 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:52.590
 to compress quality textures 

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:58.529
 instead of what we do there 

00:05:55.599 --> 00:06:02.389
 we are still there and we can 

00:05:58.529 --> 00:06:05.770
 shows the quality gets a quality 

00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:08.610
 300 is a quality 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:08.610
 a low of 3 

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:15.020
 and later 

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:19.539
 when that brings us to the hand 

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:19.539
 you have to replenish the pixels 

00:06:20.429 --> 00:06:29.529
 to apply 

00:06:25.849 --> 00:06:29.529
 and then a restart is made 

00:06:29.729 --> 00:06:34.909
 and whether he does studies in minor 

00:06:32.039 --> 00:06:34.909
 quality comfort 

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:39.720
 and good 

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:41.720
 that's all I wanted to comment people 

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:44.820
 I wanted to know how it gets more fluid 

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:47.289
 I 'm going to have them like that, the game 

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:49.270
 much softer 

00:06:47.289 --> 00:06:51.599
 at this very moment by recording itself 

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:51.599
 with him 

00:06:52.050 --> 00:06:56.850
 Y 

00:06:54.480 --> 00:07:00.300
 and it is that there will be like fire in good 

00:06:56.850 --> 00:07:06.620
 days and that is the destination we 

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:06.620
 and good too many things 

00:07:06.799 --> 00:07:09.799
 all right 

00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:16.320
 it was necessary in the city 

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:16.320
 and good 

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:20.180
 you ask me general
