00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
out like a regular hammer would so it

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.109 
out like a regular hammer would so it
doesn't<00:01:25.740> catch<00:01:25.950> on<00:01:26.159> anything<00:01:26.189> if<00:01:26.790> you<00:01:26.909> were<00:01:27.000> to

which<00:03:11.110> are<00:03:11.260> still<00:03:11.530> quite<00:03:11.800> low<00:03:11.950> profile<00:03:12.690> but

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:13.690

concealed-carry version I actually think

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:19.050

you<00:03:17.560> get<00:03:17.709> an<00:03:17.800> extra<00:03:18.040> round<00:03:18.370> on<00:03:18.550> this<00:03:18.730> comes

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
you get an extra round on this comes

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.490 
you get an extra round on this comes
with<00:03:19.239> an<00:03:19.360> eighth<00:03:19.570> round<00:03:19.870> double<00:03:20.290> stack

because of that pinky extension but I
believe<00:03:49.900> this<00:03:50.080> is<00:03:50.230> only<00:03:50.350> a<00:03:50.500> seven<00:03:50.920> rail

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.100 
believe this is only a seven rail

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.400 
believe this is only a seven rail
magazine<00:03:51.550> so<00:03:51.700> you<00:03:51.760> actually<00:03:51.940> get<00:03:52.410> larger

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
magazine so you actually get larger

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:55.740 
magazine so you actually get larger
capacity<00:03:54.070> on<00:03:54.250> the<00:03:54.700> concealed-carry<00:03:55.180> version

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:55.750 
capacity on the concealed-carry version

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.270 
capacity on the concealed-carry version
as<00:03:56.470> far<00:03:56.830> as<00:03:56.980> the<00:03:57.160> decocker<00:03:57.610> goes<00:03:59.190> function<00:04:00.190> is

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
as far as the decocker goes function is

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.320 
as far as the decocker goes function is
fine<00:04:01.530> there<00:04:02.530> you<00:04:02.620> go<00:04:02.800> so<00:04:03.340> now<00:04:03.580> you<00:04:04.000> know<00:04:04.120> if<00:04:04.300> you

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:04.330 
fine there you go so now you know if you

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.150 
fine there you go so now you know if you
were<00:04:04.480> going<00:04:04.600> to<00:04:04.660> carry<00:04:04.900> it<00:04:05.019> hot<00:04:05.200> you<00:04:05.860> can<00:04:06.040> go

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
were going to carry it hot you can go

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.100 
were going to carry it hot you can go
back<00:04:06.400> to<00:04:06.640> your<00:04:06.760> double<00:04:07.090> action<00:04:07.450> you<00:04:07.930> could

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110 
back to your double action you could

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:10.290 
back to your double action you could
leave<00:04:08.230> the<00:04:08.350> safety<00:04:08.590> on<00:04:08.890> you<00:04:09.640> could<00:04:09.820> leave<00:04:10.000> the

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:10.300 
leave the safety on you could leave the

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:12.300 
leave the safety on you could leave the
now<00:04:11.019> I<00:04:11.290> have<00:04:11.470> to<00:04:11.590> go<00:04:11.709> down<00:04:11.890> a<00:04:11.920> little<00:04:12.100> further

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
now I have to go down a little further

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:14.910 
now I have to go down a little further
there<00:04:12.700> and<00:04:13.660> that<00:04:13.810> essentially<00:04:14.260> deadens<00:04:14.860> the

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:14.920 
there and that essentially deadens the

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:17.520 
there and that essentially deadens the
trigger<00:04:15.250> when<00:04:15.459> the<00:04:15.489> safety<00:04:15.940> is<00:04:16.060> on<00:04:16.239> so<00:04:16.930> it's

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:17.530 
trigger when the safety is on so it's

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:20.279 
trigger when the safety is on so it's
kind<00:04:17.799> of<00:04:17.830> a<00:04:17.919> long<00:04:18.220> safety<00:04:19.150> yes<00:04:19.630> there<00:04:19.900> I<00:04:20.080> mean

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:20.289 
kind of a long safety yes there I mean

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:22.440 
kind of a long safety yes there I mean
that's<00:04:20.440> in<00:04:20.680> a<00:04:20.770> safe<00:04:20.979> position<00:04:21.160> but<00:04:22.120> it<00:04:22.210> go<00:04:22.300> all

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:22.450 
that's in a safe position but it go all

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:24.090 
that's in a safe position but it go all
the<00:04:22.600> way<00:04:22.630> up<00:04:22.960> so

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:24.100 
the way up so

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.249 
the way up so
it's<00:04:24.340> kind<00:04:24.580> of<00:04:24.610> a<00:04:24.729> long<00:04:24.910> maneuver<00:04:25.750> there<00:04:25.960> but

00:04:26.249 --> 00:04:26.259 
it's kind of a long maneuver there but

00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:27.719 
it's kind of a long maneuver there but
not<00:04:26.410> a<00:04:26.440> big<00:04:26.710> deal<00:04:26.949> you<00:04:27.250> know<00:04:27.280> nothing<00:04:27.639> to

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:27.729 
not a big deal you know nothing to

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:28.560 
not a big deal you know nothing to
complain<00:04:28.030> about

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:28.570 
complain about

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:30.779

these<00:04:28.960> guns<00:04:29.199> are<00:04:29.380> accurate<00:04:29.949> but<00:04:30.160> they're

00:04:30.779 --> 00:04:30.789 
these guns are accurate but they're

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:31.920 
these guns are accurate but they're
going<00:04:30.940> to<00:04:31.000> be<00:04:31.060> a<00:04:31.090> little<00:04:31.330> more<00:04:31.419> difficult<00:04:31.600> to

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
going to be a little more difficult to

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:33.659 
going to be a little more difficult to
shoot<00:04:32.110> like<00:04:32.470> I<00:04:32.620> said<00:04:32.830> because<00:04:33.130> of<00:04:33.190> the<00:04:33.340> sights

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:33.669 
shoot like I said because of the sights

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:35.610 
shoot like I said because of the sights
but<00:04:34.270> you'll<00:04:34.389> find<00:04:34.690> that<00:04:34.780> the<00:04:34.900> accuracy<00:04:35.470> is

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
but you'll find that the accuracy is

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.860 
but you'll find that the accuracy is
top-notch<00:04:36.190> the<00:04:36.550> recoil<00:04:37.000> is<00:04:37.210> light<00:04:37.449> because

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
top-notch the recoil is light because

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.560 
top-notch the recoil is light because
it's<00:04:38.080> steel<00:04:38.440> gun<00:04:38.740> and<00:04:39.009> you<00:04:39.850> know<00:04:39.970> for<00:04:40.479> the
