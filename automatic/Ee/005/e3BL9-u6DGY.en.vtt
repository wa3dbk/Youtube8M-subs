00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:11.010
 in automotive studios opel has like every week a scoop 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.540
 and in this case we are showing this new product that honda and tucson 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.010
 it deserves to find me which engine versions really brings a design 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.980
 flashy that will do flavio I'll ask you to explain it to me tell me what 

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.920
 engines have got 11 hour at the moment only traction and integrates what 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.349
 has come some version 4 by 2 that canyon of thirty one thousand 900 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:33.150
 Dollars 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.810
 the eleven detainees until we have in this opinion has been testing is a 

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:37.990
 initial prolog 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:40.290
 with all this half an hour to understand 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.700
 184 horses a true super powerful 2 liters 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.950
 with a value of 46 million dollars 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.230
 the most important change of minds and design happen to have a car and I say 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.269
 because if not the end of the war, 

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:55.330
 now it's time to wait for celia 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:59.590
 to have a really very attractive car with German design says let's talk 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.300
 percent and with all a gold technology like this engine with 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.260
 4 euro technology 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.020
 percent and all the comfort and safety equipment that is usually 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.890
 has has what I think 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.860
 He again had a leading role at the time about how he tells me that 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:16.640
 the other one we treat a friend hand 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:21.120
 after the ignition praised the one of belgrade a few years ago they were transferred to a 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.070
 embargo 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.390
 and this has a lot to do with the key design that piqued you have of 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:26.619
 different cars 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:29.330
 today that a baby are more German or not 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.860
 they have exactly German influence 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.910
 I love to classify the first in four factors 

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:39.000
 we breed choose the german design because it explained sunny lee called its success 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.460
 within the world of design 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.460
 but also this design that can apply the precepts not so much 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.460
 we just attractive young and 30 that is one of the most successful to our country 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:51.950
 let's see some these resources that are used first the surface 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.119
 that in times of encouragement yes sir secondly the geometric cuts 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:59.479
 entered to steal in the classic I told him that if they wanted his coronation 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:00.970
 just now they use it 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.840
 almost every 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.200
 100 voices a clear German element 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.860
 then they openly end 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:08.579
 talgo jara de hacienda y tucson 

00:02:08.579 --> 00:02:13.689
 both models he was produced 15 years in came in that has foundation 

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:17.219
 from jaén that to be German also 

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:20.219
 the one way they are also sold or of some German philosophy 

00:02:20.779 --> 00:02:23.049
 and then I have where we are going to see 

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:27.079
 is going to be some lines with more character yes i where they are also going to 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:29.969
 play a lot with concave and convex surfaces 

00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:34.249
 that this is a hard pulse that a floor almost for the first time bitter has come 

00:02:34.249 --> 00:02:34.889
 mild 

00:02:34.889 --> 00:02:36.679
 that has to do with that a daughter 

00:02:36.679 --> 00:02:38.889
 the current bosses in the gym 

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:40.659
 previously worked in berna 

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:43.799
 it is not by chance okazaki that thing of god that happen 

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:47.239
 that one does not know what happened but it is but all these elements 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:50.979
 what they do is give it one more point at this height before in the general that has 

00:02:51.679 --> 00:02:55.159
 on the other hand in antiquity say the Korean cars in the cars 

00:02:55.159 --> 00:02:59.359
 japanese the world tasty from tandil is opposed germany made in 

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:00.899
 Europe 

00:03:00.899 --> 00:03:03.249
 the engine is Korean 

00:03:03.249 --> 00:03:07.189
 it is indeed so there are many times in the table was inside the 

00:03:07.189 --> 00:03:10.220
 bug asks what to do from recurrently amused 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.870
 because hacienda authorized to operate the 130 if in Argentina the maximum speed is 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:16.469
 that and because ultimately 

00:03:16.469 --> 00:03:19.239
 do not be a car for this country is a world car 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:23.549
 obviously adapted in many things to the Argentine Republic but that car 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:26.549
 you also have to send it in japan in the united states in germany in france 

00:03:27.279 --> 00:03:30.459
 p everywhere 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:34.759
 last week we played with you for a watch casio this one will remember 

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:36.230
 and we asked him 

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.450
 how much the chele accelerated yesterday that the recovery time in fifth gear 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:42.510
 from 80 to 120 kilometers 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:45.299
 the public delegate 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:48.919
 messi who won we have the image for you to see the proof we did 

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:52.519
 us but it is counting I know who and who was the winner on 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:57.829
 swimmer are born of time are not about 20 seconds of the winner is André Martin 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:03:59.969
 of the province of Buenos Aires 

00:03:59.969 --> 00:04:04.159
 r scared him of the two best of the continent like 5 seconds 

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:07.920
 it was the most approximate took a little longer 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.830
 Of course, let's take into account that those who have the fourth 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.140
 who in addition that people still more on advances is a vehicle that 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:15.930
 is set with everything 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.930
 to go very well down but up 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.069
 no more in this case by approximation be a good option 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:25.110
 be now the parents martín of bragado province of buenos aires was quite 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:28.149
 lucky hunger because they sued for enough more than that 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.229
 since he took people to communicate with us we are going to do 

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:38.259
 a demo face to all motor of the seat to support the two thousand friends we want it 

00:04:38.259 --> 00:04:39.789
 ucla roberto carlos 

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:43.379
 but we have also alluded to being chosen 

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:44.300
 that the beloved ones 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:47.819
 He says they started using seat belts because they will hear your voice 

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:51.120
 and they saved their lives in accidents thanks to that consensus 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.340
 well with this I have it 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:59.150
 all done of both is gone one hundred saved the life definitively all 16 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:02.830
 years I was on the inside were not in vain absolutely 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:09.030
 ezequiel with pamela the strip that I have for the agent July for this watch 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:12.710
 casio that you have to which today we speak with matías alé as it is a return and 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:16.139
 I felt race week we are going to play with the claw of formula 1 

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:20.439
 that mail last week in Spain accommodation before the question of how 

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:24.339
 it's free to answer the email when you have at full power 1 point com 

00:05:24.339 --> 00:05:27.849
 which was the difference between the record back in the race and the time 

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:31.489
 of classification not that there is no more time but what was the difference of 

00:05:31.489 --> 00:05:34.089
 time between one and the other octopus 

00:05:34.089 --> 00:05:37.099
 when we say monotony of the pacific of this country 

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:45.480
 we are also together with classic cars and I want to tell you 

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:49.510
 that from October 8 to 11 in San Isidro at San Isidro racecourse 

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:54.680

 right in the classic car club 

00:06:06.469 --> 00:06:11.489
 of san isidro and if he simply wants to give it, do not miss it from 8 to 11 

00:06:11.489 --> 00:06:15.519
 October at the San Isidro racecourse a car show 

00:06:15.519 --> 00:06:16.999
 classic and sport 

00:06:16.999 --> 00:06:19.960
 really spectacular 

00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:22.819
 Citigroup rodeo for Toyota in the United States 

00:06:22.819 --> 00:06:26.949
 in this case mother broccoli accommodated one million crowns 

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:30.800
 the vehicle electronics failed 

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:34.569
 already in 2009 for a failure in the accelerator pedal had to be 

00:06:34.569 --> 00:06:37.689
 will make more than conce millions of previously sold cars
