the<00:02:41.870> other<00:02:42.020> wise<00:02:42.200> guy<00:02:42.530> didn't<00:02:42.770> explain<00:02:43.099> much

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
the other wise guy didn't explain much

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.309 
the other wise guy didn't explain much
can<00:02:44.180> you<00:02:44.330> run<00:02:44.720> a<00:02:44.750> blue<00:02:45.080> guy<00:02:45.290> help<00:02:45.680> us<00:02:45.830> I<00:02:46.130> am

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:47.319 
can you run a blue guy help us I am

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:54.430 
can you run a blue guy help us I am
scientist<00:02:48.319> man<00:02:50.050> okay<00:02:51.400> well<00:02:53.440> phototropism

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
scientist man okay well phototropism

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.589 
scientist man okay well phototropism
increases<00:02:55.370> the<00:02:55.489> chance<00:02:55.760> of<00:02:55.880> survival<00:02:56.420> of<00:02:56.510> the

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:56.599 
increases the chance of survival of the

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:58.750 
increases the chance of survival of the
plant<00:02:56.870> by<00:02:57.170> making<00:02:57.560> the<00:02:57.650> client<00:02:57.890> grow<00:02:58.220> into<00:02:58.700> a

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
plant by making the client grow into a

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.790 
plant by making the client grow into a
position<00:02:58.940> that<00:02:59.239> has<00:02:59.480> popped<00:02:59.810> on<00:02:59.959> exposure<00:03:00.470> to

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800 
position that has popped on exposure to

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.979 
position that has popped on exposure to
Sonic<00:03:01.190> so<00:03:01.730> it<00:03:01.790> can<00:03:01.940> photosynthesize<00:03:02.269> more

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
Sonic so it can photosynthesize more

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:05.020 
Sonic so it can photosynthesize more
efficiently<00:03:03.500> this<00:03:04.160> means<00:03:04.430> it<00:03:04.580> has<00:03:04.730> a<00:03:04.760> better

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
efficiently this means it has a better

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:08.320 
efficiently this means it has a better
chance<00:03:05.180> of<00:03:05.569> survival<00:03:06.110> Oh<00:03:07.330> what's

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:08.330 
chance of survival Oh what's

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:13.750 
chance of survival Oh what's
photosynthesis<00:03:10.600> well<00:03:11.860> it's<00:03:12.860> what<00:03:13.130> plants<00:03:13.370> do

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
photosynthesis well it's what plants do

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.120 
photosynthesis well it's what plants do
to<00:03:13.910> make<00:03:14.060> food<00:03:14.390> through<00:03:15.170> sunlight<00:03:15.650> and<00:03:15.860> carbon

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
to make food through sunlight and carbon

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:23.770 
to make food through sunlight and carbon
dioxide<00:03:17.170> food<00:03:18.170> like<00:03:19.180> hamburgers<00:03:21.610> yes<00:03:22.780> quite

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
dioxide food like hamburgers yes quite

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.839 
dioxide food like hamburgers yes quite
but<00:03:24.530> so<00:03:25.340> how<00:03:25.430> do<00:03:25.489> we<00:03:25.580> kill<00:03:25.790> it<00:03:27.190> well<00:03:28.190> if<00:03:28.640> you

00:03:28.839 --> 00:03:28.849 
but so how do we kill it well if you

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:30.339 
but so how do we kill it well if you
just<00:03:29.060> chopped<00:03:29.299> it<00:03:29.420> down<00:03:29.480> then<00:03:29.840> the<00:03:29.930> customers

00:03:30.339 --> 00:03:30.349 
just chopped it down then the customers

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:31.990 
just chopped it down then the customers
would<00:03:30.470> grow<00:03:30.680> get<00:03:30.950> into<00:03:31.310> clones<00:03:31.610> of<00:03:31.819> the

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
would grow get into clones of the

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.059 
would grow get into clones of the
original<00:03:32.360> pop<00:03:32.599> you<00:03:33.170> so<00:03:33.470> you'd<00:03:33.620> have<00:03:33.650> more

00:03:34.059 --> 00:03:34.069 
original pop you so you'd have more

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:36.910 
original pop you so you'd have more
zombie<00:03:34.790> parts<00:03:35.090> to<00:03:35.209> deal<00:03:35.390> with<00:03:35.599> so<00:03:36.170> i<00:03:36.410> suggest

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:36.920 
zombie parts to deal with so i suggest

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:39.220 
zombie parts to deal with so i suggest
you<00:03:37.010> burn<00:03:37.310> kill<00:03:38.150> the<00:03:38.299> cells<00:03:38.540> so<00:03:38.870> the<00:03:38.989> plants

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:39.230 
you burn kill the cells so the plants

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:41.740 
you burn kill the cells so the plants
won't<00:03:39.500> be<00:03:39.709> able<00:03:39.890> to<00:03:40.040> regrow<00:03:40.430> why<00:03:41.420> do<00:03:41.480> they

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
won't be able to regrow why do they

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:46.599 
won't be able to regrow why do they
regrow<00:03:43.239> well<00:03:44.260> the<00:03:45.260> plant<00:03:45.560> hormone<00:03:46.040> orton

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:46.609 
regrow well the plant hormone orton

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:48.220 
regrow well the plant hormone orton
makes<00:03:46.880> the<00:03:47.060> remains<00:03:47.329> of<00:03:47.450> the<00:03:47.600> plant<00:03:47.870> grow

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
makes the remains of the plant grow

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.310 
makes the remains of the plant grow
roots<00:03:48.560> and<00:03:48.920> start<00:03:49.190> growing<00:03:49.459> as<00:03:49.640> new<00:03:49.850> plant

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:50.320
