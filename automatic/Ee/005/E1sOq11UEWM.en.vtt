the<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.899> wall<00:01:01.440> between<00:01:01.680> developer<00:01:02.340> and<00:01:02.670> in

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
the the wall between developer and in

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.410 
the the wall between developer and in
player<00:01:04.290> and<00:01:05.189> gamer<00:01:05.460> has<00:01:05.760> really<00:01:06.090> dissolved

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
and you know it's it's I think in

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.679 
and you know it's it's I think in
history<00:01:10.170> you<00:01:10.740> know<00:01:10.979> in<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.100> past<00:01:11.280> you<00:01:11.760> know<00:01:12.119> I

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
think a lot of developers were sort of

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.820 
think a lot of developers were sort of
being<00:01:15.840> able<00:01:16.049> to<00:01:16.140> shoot<00:01:16.320> down<00:01:16.560> shield

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:35.070 
to be like so um so we decided and say

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:36.200 
to be like so um so we decided and say
look<00:04:35.280> I<00:04:35.430> mean<00:04:35.580> we<00:04:35.670> could<00:04:35.820> build<00:04:35.910> this<00:04:36.030> over

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:36.210 
look I mean we could build this over

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:37.910 
look I mean we could build this over
time<00:04:36.420> and<00:04:36.720> eventually<00:04:37.020> get<00:04:37.560> to<00:04:37.680> where<00:04:37.800> we<00:04:37.890> want

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:37.920 
time and eventually get to where we want

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:42.980 
time and eventually get to where we want
to<00:04:38.130> go<00:04:38.190> right<00:04:39.120> okay<00:04:40.050> so<00:04:40.220> that<00:04:41.220> means<00:04:41.720> pc<00:04:42.720> is

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
to go right okay so that means pc is

challenges and you know with PC and one

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.960 
challenges and you know with PC and one
can<00:05:52.200> play<00:05:52.320> with<00:05:52.410> everyone<00:05:52.770> it's<00:05:53.490> completely

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:53.970

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:55.790 
can play with everyone it's completely
customizable<00:05:54.690> and<00:05:54.870> I<00:05:55.320> think<00:05:55.560> the<00:05:55.620> biggest

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:55.800 
customizable and I think the biggest

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:57.530 
customizable and I think the biggest
part<00:05:56.070> is<00:05:56.220> we<00:05:56.430> give<00:05:56.640> the<00:05:56.820> community<00:05:56.970> the<00:05:57.300> tools

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:57.540 
part is we give the community the tools

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:59.780 
part is we give the community the tools
to<00:05:58.169> literally<00:05:58.710> make<00:05:58.830> whatever<00:05:59.160> they<00:05:59.400> want<00:05:59.580> and

00:05:59.780 --> 00:05:59.790 
to literally make whatever they want and

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:02.150 
to literally make whatever they want and
that<00:06:00.450> is<00:06:00.720> the<00:06:00.900> future<00:06:01.229> right<00:06:01.470> is<00:06:01.710> allowing

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:02.160 
that is the future right is allowing

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.430 
that is the future right is allowing
people<00:06:02.310> to<00:06:02.490> make<00:06:02.700> whatever<00:06:02.880> they<00:06:03.120> want<00:06:03.440> and

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:04.440 
people to make whatever they want and

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:07.250 
people to make whatever they want and
yeah<00:06:05.250> it's<00:06:05.820> a<00:06:05.940> lot<00:06:06.450> harder<00:06:06.600> on<00:06:06.810> the<00:06:06.870> consoles

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:07.260 
yeah it's a lot harder on the consoles

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:09.560 
yeah it's a lot harder on the consoles
but<00:06:07.410> the<00:06:07.979> console<00:06:08.280> is<00:06:08.370> a<00:06:08.430> very<00:06:08.610> focused<00:06:09.150> it's<00:06:09.450> a

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:09.570 
but the console is a very focused it's a

00:06:09.570 --> 00:06:14.060 
but the console is a very focused it's a
very<00:06:09.750> focused<00:06:10.260> experience<00:06:11.270> and<00:06:12.500> in<00:06:13.500> a<00:06:13.950> very

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:14.070 
very focused experience and in a very
