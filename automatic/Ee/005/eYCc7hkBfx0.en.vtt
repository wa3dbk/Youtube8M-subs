another one that's spiking right now as
we<00:01:23.159> talk<00:01:23.369> so<00:01:23.970> when<00:01:24.210> this<00:01:24.299> is<00:01:24.479> uploaded<00:01:24.990> I<00:01:25.080> don't

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
we talk so when this is uploaded I don't

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.390 
we talk so when this is uploaded I don't
know<00:01:25.320> if<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.500> spike<00:01:25.740> is<00:01:25.890> going<00:01:26.040> to<00:01:26.100> be<00:01:26.159> done

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
know if the spike is going to be done

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.070 
know if the spike is going to be done
but<00:01:26.640> Kevin<00:01:26.939> show<00:01:27.060> is<00:01:27.180> something<00:01:27.540> a<00:01:27.659> card<00:01:27.930> it's

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
but Kevin show is something a card it's

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.859 
but Kevin show is something a card it's
very<00:01:28.320> unique<00:01:28.610> it<00:01:29.610> has<00:01:29.759> no<00:01:30.119> downside<00:01:30.600> because

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
very unique it has no downside because

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.679 
very unique it has no downside because
for<00:01:31.530> land<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:32.040> main<00:01:32.460> downside<00:01:32.729> I<00:01:33.060> look<00:01:33.329> at<00:01:33.509> is

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
for land the main downside I look at is

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.719 
for land the main downside I look at is
does<00:01:33.960> it<00:01:34.110> come<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:34.439> play<00:01:34.590> tapped<00:01:34.950> so<00:01:35.579> if<00:01:35.640> it

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
does it come and play tapped so if it

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.370 
does it come and play tapped so if it
comes<00:01:35.909> into<00:01:36.090> play<00:01:36.210> tapped<00:01:36.540> it<00:01:36.840> must<00:01:37.200> do

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
comes into play tapped it must do

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.609 
comes into play tapped it must do
something<00:01:37.619> very<00:01:38.189> very<00:01:38.430> good<00:01:39.170> Kevin<00:01:40.170> show<00:01:40.290> does

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
something very very good Kevin show does

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.319 
something very very good Kevin show does
not<00:01:40.650> come<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:41.340> play<00:01:41.460> tapped<00:01:41.729> it<00:01:41.970> comes<00:01:42.150> and

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
not come and play tapped it comes and

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.910 
not come and play tapped it comes and
play<00:01:42.509> untapped<00:01:43.049> which<00:01:43.530> makes<00:01:43.770> it

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
play untapped which makes it

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.899 
play untapped which makes it
tremendously<00:01:44.850> ballet<00:01:45.180> then<00:01:46.579> most<00:01:47.579> people

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
tremendously ballet then most people

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.130 
tremendously ballet then most people
will<00:01:48.030> give<00:01:48.180> it<00:01:48.299> credit<00:01:48.600> for<00:01:48.630> it<00:01:48.810> because<00:01:48.899> it's

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
will give it credit for it because it's

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.649 
will give it credit for it because it's
only<00:01:49.350> upside<00:01:49.890> uncountable<00:01:50.610> and<00:01:51.180> you<00:01:51.509> get

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
only upside uncountable and you get

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.109
