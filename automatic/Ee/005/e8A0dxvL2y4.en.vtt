00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
isn't much easier I won't have that

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.570 
isn't much easier I won't have that
option<00:02:05.520> on<00:02:05.850> the<00:02:06.000> annunciator<00:02:06.560> or<00:02:07.560> RCU<00:02:08.250> which

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
option on the annunciator or RCU which

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.479 
option on the annunciator or RCU which
will<00:02:08.819> which<00:02:09.450> will<00:02:09.479> be<00:02:10.110> a<00:02:10.140> nun<00:02:10.679> theater<00:02:11.069> one<00:02:11.370> it

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
will which will be a nun theater one it

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.360 
will which will be a nun theater one it
is<00:02:11.640> a<00:02:11.670> 4100

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
is a 4100

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.150 
is a 4100
so<00:02:14.720> reason<00:02:15.720> being<00:02:15.870> how<00:02:16.110> I<00:02:16.140> can<00:02:16.320> have<00:02:16.440> an<00:02:16.620> es<00:02:16.920> is

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
so reason being how I can have an es is

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.160 
so reason being how I can have an es is
because<00:02:17.490> I<00:02:17.580> know<00:02:17.640> some<00:02:17.940> guys<00:02:18.090> very<00:02:18.480> well<00:02:18.630> and

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
because I know some guys very well and

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:20.780 
because I know some guys very well and
have<00:02:19.380> a<00:02:19.410> lot<00:02:19.530> of<00:02:19.800> good<00:02:19.920> friends<00:02:20.100> that<00:02:20.490> ever

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
have a lot of good friends that ever

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.720 
have a lot of good friends that ever
loved<00:02:21.090> that<00:02:21.380> so<00:02:22.380> and<00:02:22.830> I<00:02:23.100> don't<00:02:23.250> think<00:02:23.460> it<00:02:23.580> would

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
loved that so and I don't think it would

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.160 
loved that so and I don't think it would
really<00:02:23.910> be<00:02:24.120> able<00:02:24.270> to<00:02:24.420> be<00:02:24.570> possible<00:02:25.020> for

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
really be able to be possible for

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.010 
really be able to be possible for
anybody<00:02:25.500> else<00:02:25.880> wish<00:02:26.880> it<00:02:27.060> could<00:02:27.270> be<00:02:27.300> but<00:02:27.630> it<00:02:27.780> can

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
anybody else wish it could be but it can

00:02:28.020 --> 00:03:46.450 
anybody else wish it could be but it can
be<00:02:28.200> so<00:02:28.800> let's<00:02:29.700> do<00:02:29.910> it

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:46.460 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:50.570 

but<00:03:47.460> yeah<00:03:48.050> it's<00:03:49.050> gonna<00:03:49.230> be<00:03:49.350> a<00:03:49.380> 4,100<00:03:50.100> yes<00:03:50.310> by

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 
but yeah it's gonna be a 4,100 yes by

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.060 
but yeah it's gonna be a 4,100 yes by
far<00:03:50.970> I<00:03:51.000> think<00:03:51.300> it<00:03:51.600> is<00:03:51.750> the<00:03:51.930> best<00:03:52.140> it<00:03:52.440> is<00:03:52.950> the

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:53.070 
far I think it is the best it is the

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:55.040 
far I think it is the best it is the
most<00:03:53.250> latest<00:03:53.550> panel<00:03:54.000> for<00:03:54.210> simplex<00:03:54.660> for<00:03:54.870> big

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.050 
most latest panel for simplex for big

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:57.350 
most latest panel for simplex for big
systems<00:03:55.500> and<00:03:56.250> by<00:03:56.400> far<00:03:56.670> I<00:03:56.700> think<00:03:56.940> it'll<00:03:57.180> be<00:03:57.330> the

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:57.360 
systems and by far I think it'll be the

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.930 
systems and by far I think it'll be the
best<00:03:57.690> four<00:03:57.990> years<00:03:58.020> for<00:03:58.860> many<00:03:59.100> many<00:03:59.340> years<00:03:59.670> to

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
best four years for many many years to

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.810 
best four years for many many years to
come

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:01.820 
come

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:04.070 
come

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
and as you may notice the four thousand

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.170 
and as you may notice the four thousand

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
five is on the wall moved over that's so

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.510 
five is on the wall moved over that's so
I<00:04:06.210> could<00:04:06.480> fit<00:04:06.750> the<00:04:06.930> other<00:04:07.110> es<00:04:07.530> back<00:04:07.830> box<00:04:08.130> on<00:04:08.430> the

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:08.520 
I could fit the other es back box on the

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:11.030 
I could fit the other es back box on the
wall<00:04:08.700> and<00:04:09.030> the<00:04:09.990> four<00:04:10.170> thousand<00:04:10.500> five<00:04:10.620> once<00:04:10.890> the

wall and the four thousand five once the

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.500 
wall and the four thousand five once the
es<00:04:11.310> is<00:04:11.490> done<00:04:11.700> will<00:04:12.180> be<00:04:12.210> moved<00:04:12.570> to<00:04:13.040> upstairs<00:04:14.040> and

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
the four thousand one will no longer be

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.710 
the four thousand one will no longer be
used<00:04:19.880> plus<00:04:20.880> this<00:04:21.060> will<00:04:21.239> be<00:04:21.359> with<00:04:21.510> the<00:04:21.600> four
