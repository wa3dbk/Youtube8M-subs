00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.419
 yo everybody closes and chic rom and 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.800
 today we find ourselves for a 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.019
 so small video on an animal crossing 

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.460
 nolifes on 3ds so I 'm going to you 

00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:10.350
 show my city zelda so a city 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.450
 filled with patterns so it's pretty 

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:13.940
 it's pretty good but it's true too 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.170
 it's a lot of work 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:19.020
 so I'll show you wise and we'll 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:22.800
 go around a bit sorry for the 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:25.670
 quality on the other hand we are good for 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:29.220
 the moment is not completely finished 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:34.949
 so there you can see that I did 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:38.460
 well there is the flash and feline that we do not 

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:41.089
 do not see very well so a hen a 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.929
 trunk that takes four reasons there is 

00:00:41.089 --> 00:00:44.929
 the hymn that makes the flute 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:50.729
 so here it is a saber planted in so 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:56.819
 in the grass 

00:00:50.729 --> 00:01:01.019
 still a hen we have an inhabitant I 

00:00:56.819 --> 00:01:03.359
 does a boot a beginnings are like I 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:05.690
 told you it's over and I have 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.940
 other zelda motifs 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.590
 I think it is really cool 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.140
 saw rest of trees to bring down I 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.820
 find it really cool what game 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.750
 will make a video once finished lukla 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.750
 I made mushrooms 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.950
 then here I am I really find that 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.540
 it's really back and after it's true 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.940
 that some say yes so the 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.830
 patterns are more fossils 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.060
 5 it's a choice but it's good for me 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:34.920
 not to make money because 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.530
 here are the fossils I was fishing was eating 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.750
 all rap of insects and I find I 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.620
 find the game much more fun with 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.480
 patterns like that for example I can 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.160
 show you 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:51.000
 so look for example I have some 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:53.070
 grounds there a class and it is that the 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.080
 grounds so on my personal about my father 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.730
 self here otherwise because I had to do 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.440
 three characters blow the grounds are 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:01.590
 fulfilled so that I have not yet everything 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:05.220
 1000 g I made some of 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:08.820
