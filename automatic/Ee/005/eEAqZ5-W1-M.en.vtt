00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
hi guys this rule and I will show you

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.700 
hi guys this rule and I will show you
how<00:00:08.519> I<00:00:08.550> do<00:00:08.730> color<00:00:09.300> separation<00:00:09.960> in<00:00:10.139> Illustrator

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
how I do color separation in Illustrator

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.020 
how I do color separation in Illustrator
cs5<00:00:12.170> so<00:00:13.170> here<00:00:13.349> you<00:00:13.469> can<00:00:13.590> see<00:00:13.799> there's<00:00:14.099> colors

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
cs5 so here you can see there's colors

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.689 
cs5 so here you can see there's colors
that<00:00:15.299> are<00:00:15.660> excess<00:00:16.170> or<00:00:16.440> overlapping<00:00:17.160> under<00:00:17.520> the

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
that are excess or overlapping under the

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.609 
that are excess or overlapping under the
lines<00:00:17.880> and<00:00:18.119> other<00:00:18.240> colors<00:00:18.660> so<00:00:19.170> we<00:00:19.380> need<00:00:19.500> to

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
lines and other colors so we need to

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.660 
lines and other colors so we need to
trim<00:00:20.340> them<00:00:20.730> or<00:00:21.060> color<00:00:21.689> separate<00:00:22.199> it<00:00:22.380> so<00:00:22.670> it

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
trim them or color separate it so it

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:30.190 
trim them or color separate it so it
will<00:00:23.910> be<00:00:24.090> ready<00:00:24.269> for<00:00:24.510> printing

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:30.200 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.280 

make<00:00:31.200> sure<00:00:31.410> everything<00:00:32.130> is<00:00:32.520> unlocked<00:00:33.260> so<00:00:34.260> you

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
make sure everything is unlocked so you

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.250 
make sure everything is unlocked so you
can<00:00:34.680> select<00:00:35.070> them<00:00:35.460> by<00:00:35.910> just<00:00:36.150> clicking<00:00:36.540> control

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
can select them by just clicking control

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.100 
can select them by just clicking control
a<00:00:37.380> on<00:00:37.560> your<00:00:37.710> keyboard<00:00:37.890> and<00:00:38.780> then<00:00:39.780> make<00:00:39.960> sure

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
a on your keyboard and then make sure

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.960 
a on your keyboard and then make sure
everything<00:00:40.560> expanded<00:00:41.160> that<00:00:41.460> will<00:00:41.670> make<00:00:41.850> your

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:41.970 
everything expanded that will make your

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.680 
everything expanded that will make your
stroke<00:00:42.300> pads<00:00:42.570> in<00:00:43.050> shape<00:00:43.500> warm<00:00:43.770> so<00:00:44.010> you<00:00:44.070> will<00:00:44.370> be

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
stroke pads in shape warm so you will be

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.130 
stroke pads in shape warm so you will be
not<00:00:45.690> having<00:00:46.020> troubles<00:00:46.470> when<00:00:47.400> you<00:00:48.210> merge<00:00:48.840> them

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
not having troubles when you merge them

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.140

on<00:00:54.270> your<00:00:54.300> Pathfinder<00:00:54.989> that<00:00:55.260> will<00:00:55.440> merge<00:00:56.250> all

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
on your Pathfinder that will merge all

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.900 
on your Pathfinder that will merge all
the<00:00:56.820> layers<00:00:56.850> into<00:00:57.449> one<00:00:57.480> layer<00:00:58.520> if<00:00:59.520> you<00:00:59.730> cannot

00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:35.399 
color that will select all the shapes

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:37.490 
color that will select all the shapes
with<00:01:35.700> the<00:01:35.729> same<00:01:36.149> fill<00:01:36.689> color<00:01:36.719> in<00:01:37.140> that<00:01:37.289> layer

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
with the same fill color in that layer

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.630 
with the same fill color in that layer
and<00:01:37.829> then<00:01:38.460> drag<00:01:38.789> the<00:01:39.630> blue<00:01:40.439> colored<00:01:40.740> right

side<00:01:41.909> and<00:01:42.149> the<00:01:42.990> empty<00:01:43.320> layer<00:01:43.439> so<00:01:44.399> you<00:01:44.430> can<00:01:44.729> see

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
side and the empty layer so you can see

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.999 
side and the empty layer so you can see
that<00:01:45.060> we<00:01:45.420> already<00:01:45.539> extracted<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.469> outline

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
that we already extracted the outline

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.300 
that we already extracted the outline
from<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.549> topmost<00:01:47.759> layer<00:01:48.740> then<00:01:49.740> just<00:01:50.009> do<00:01:50.189> it

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
from the topmost layer then just do it

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.859 
from the topmost layer then just do it
repeatedly<00:01:50.759> click<00:01:51.689> a<00:01:52.640> shape<00:01:53.640> by<00:01:53.880> holding<00:01:54.420> ctrl

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
repeatedly click a shape by holding ctrl

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.760 
repeatedly click a shape by holding ctrl
and<00:01:55.079> clicking<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.649> shape<00:01:55.890> go<00:01:56.549> to<00:01:56.780> slab<00:01:57.780> go<00:01:58.649> the

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
and clicking the shape go to slab go the

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:08.919 
and clicking the shape go to slab go the
same<00:01:58.979> and<00:01:59.280> then<00:01:59.429> select<00:02:00.240> fill<00:02:00.479> color

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:14.460 

you

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:17.710 

we<00:02:15.470> need<00:02:15.650> two<00:02:16.070> more<00:02:16.100> layers<00:02:16.610> so<00:02:16.910> just<00:02:17.180> add<00:02:17.390> two

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
we need two more layers so just add two

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:24.100 
we need two more layers so just add two
layers<00:02:18.640> and<00:02:20.830> and<00:02:21.830> then<00:02:22.670> do<00:02:23.180> the<00:02:23.570> same<00:02:23.750> process

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
layers and and then do the same process

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.970 
layers and and then do the same process
goes<00:02:24.920> to<00:02:25.040> select<00:02:25.490> same<00:02:26.330> fill<00:02:26.630> color<00:02:26.680> then<00:02:27.680> drag

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:27.980 
goes to select same fill color then drag

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:37.960 
goes to select same fill color then drag
the<00:02:28.280> color<00:02:28.760> to<00:02:28.940> the<00:02:29.090> empty<00:02:29.480> layer

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:40.850 

you

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.089 

so<00:02:41.860> you<00:02:41.920> can<00:02:42.069> see<00:02:42.159> some<00:02:42.340> of<00:02:42.459> the<00:02:42.610> whites<00:02:42.819> are

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
so you can see some of the whites are

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:47.360 
so you can see some of the whites are
left<00:02:44.400> in<00:02:44.700> the<00:02:44.879> topmost<00:02:45.120> layer<00:02:45.680> because<00:02:46.680> it<00:02:47.040> has

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
left in the topmost layer because it has

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.220 
left in the topmost layer because it has
to<00:02:47.579> set<00:02:47.790> the<00:02:47.819> different<00:02:48.480> sheet<00:02:48.780> than<00:02:49.109> the

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
to set the different sheet than the

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.039 
to set the different sheet than the
other<00:02:49.349> whites<00:02:49.650> so<00:02:49.950> just<00:02:50.219> select<00:02:50.760> one<00:02:51.150> and<00:02:51.450> then

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
other whites so just select one and then

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:55.520 
other whites so just select one and then
go<00:02:52.829> to<00:02:52.890> select<00:02:53.359> same<00:02:54.359> and<00:02:54.689> then<00:02:54.810> see<00:02:55.049> the<00:02:55.109> fill

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
go to select same and then see the fill

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.069 
go to select same and then see the fill
color<00:02:55.739> and<00:02:56.189> then<00:02:56.340> drag<00:02:56.549> it<00:02:56.700> to<00:02:57.359> the<00:02:57.390> layer<00:02:57.659> of

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079 
color and then drag it to the layer of

only shapes inside will be selected and

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:08.020 
only shapes inside will be selected and

delete<00:03:09.030> the<00:03:09.180> topmost<00:03:09.390> layer<00:03:09.720> which<00:03:10.049> contains

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
delete the topmost layer which contains

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.849 
delete the topmost layer which contains
the<00:03:10.799> parts<00:03:11.129> that<00:03:11.310> won't<00:03:12.269> be<00:03:12.389> needed<00:03:12.689> so<00:03:12.959> just

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:13.859 
the parts that won't be needed so just

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:25.000 
the parts that won't be needed so just
delete<00:03:14.099> them<00:03:14.250> it<00:03:14.609> won't<00:03:14.879> affect<00:03:15.299> your<00:03:15.930> design

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:30.230 

you

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:30.240 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.180 

so<00:03:31.240> here<00:03:31.480> we<00:03:31.630> can<00:03:31.810> see<00:03:32.050> that<00:03:32.260> everything<00:03:32.980> is

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
so here we can see that everything is

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.390 
so here we can see that everything is
perfectly<00:03:34.350> shaped<00:03:35.350> and<00:03:35.680> not<00:03:35.920> overlapping

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
perfectly shaped and not overlapping

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.970 
perfectly shaped and not overlapping
each<00:03:36.670> other<00:03:36.850> so<00:03:37.810> it<00:03:38.110> is<00:03:38.290> ready<00:03:38.560> for<00:03:38.650> printing

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
each other so it is ready for printing

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.950 
each other so it is ready for printing
and<00:03:39.250> it<00:03:39.820> is<00:03:39.970> color<00:03:40.300> separated<00:03:41.490> so<00:03:42.780> that's<00:03:43.780> all

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:43.960 
and it is color separated so that's all

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:46.760 
and it is color separated so that's all
for<00:03:44.140> now<00:03:44.170> stay<00:03:44.770> tuned<00:03:44.980> for<00:03:45.090> more<00:03:46.090> videos<00:03:46.570> and
