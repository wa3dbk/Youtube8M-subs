00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:08.130
 before the start of fc groningen ajax and fc groningen director hans nijland in 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.130
 iran wanted for the camera of studio sport what was it about 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.889
 or have the lyrics 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.289
 if I have to do that then it will happen 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.189
 and how many tips were cost 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:23.179
 and then whether all those are already back on the amount that he forms in two years 

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:25.829
 to get 

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:29.320
 and I also believe that of an ice cream, he said 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.060
 that here enjoyed the 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.890
 that matt does the sales well at psv he is also about the football fan 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.510
 versions also like to stay here 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.880
 texeira has set itself with three goals in four games with one in the spotlight 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:40.760
 played 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.910
 but what does Jan Mulder actually think of the qualities of the striker to the corner? 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.670
 that is odd that image 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:49.930
 I love the technology and in this case the striker 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.690
 fancy in the penalty area he set her on fire 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.059
 and people with a kind of high quality 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.030
 I think the striker must have 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.170
 well that is the great beauty of having played the soccer they had just known 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:04.010
 of course that too 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:05.400
 before every ball went 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.710
 However, it is a bit sure that I also think a good striker 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.899
 I think the team will be themselves from now on 

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:17.110
 the striker has to adjust, then you will benefit greatly 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.250
 that is your tip to fc groningen yes 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.490
 especially 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.540
 they said the peak professor your mail 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.060
 what do you expect from FC Groningen ajax top no idea says the 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.390
 minister look it is warm 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.450
 I remember that from my life and career 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.370
 as the first in the b core is also the game played anyway offers 

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:42.360
 you have to switch again especially mentally the legs side streets of the fact 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.020
 that you don't play against real madrid but the event 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.540
 sorry the lesser opponent 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:51.540
 de and especially with this heat so ajax that all times can break up a bit 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.730
 from the first minute trying to call something like that the mulder played 

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:01.130
 from 1990 75 for ajax but is the groninger 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.070
 then we are naturally curious about what his preference is for this afternoon 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.080
 look i am a bit for twente because joey 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:11.790
 since the assistant trainer the two do have a kind of bond with them 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:15.900
 I don't really have that anymore with my partner Ajax makes yes I dare not 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:21.870
 because I know I am not here in this stadium I am making ajax like 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.399
 groningen plays well 

00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:26.769
 and they win then I will not anyway from 10 am 

00:02:27.279 --> 00:02:30.279
 drown the cell in cognac 

00:02:30.999 --> 00:02:34.219
 the white wine to forget this shameful day
