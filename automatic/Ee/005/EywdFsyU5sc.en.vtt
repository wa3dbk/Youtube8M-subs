I'll<00:01:38.960> be<00:01:39.110> setting<00:01:39.320> it<00:01:39.500> all<00:01:39.560> the<00:01:39.650> way<00:01:39.770> down<00:01:40.000> that

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
I'll be setting it all the way down that

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.120 
I'll be setting it all the way down that
means<00:01:41.270> that<00:01:41.659> if<00:01:41.900> you<00:01:42.200> somehow<00:01:42.439> get<00:01:42.740> a<00:01:42.770> master

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
means that if you somehow get a master

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:44.920 
means that if you somehow get a master
chess<00:01:43.159> and<00:01:43.610> you<00:01:43.670> get<00:01:43.880> it<00:01:44.030> at<00:01:44.180> level<00:01:44.360> 15<00:01:44.780> you'll

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
chess and you get it at level 15 you'll

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:47.289 
chess and you get it at level 15 you'll
go<00:01:45.079> up<00:01:45.229> level<00:01:45.740> and<00:01:45.860> crazy<00:01:46.070> right<00:01:46.400> that's<00:01:47.030> good

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:47.299 
go up level and crazy right that's good

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:49.810 
go up level and crazy right that's good
because<00:01:47.780> that<00:01:47.960> means<00:01:48.140> you<00:01:48.380> can<00:01:48.530> level<00:01:48.740> up<00:01:48.979> get

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
because that means you can level up get

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.260 
because that means you can level up get
another<00:01:50.119> perk<00:01:50.540> and<00:01:51.850> reinforce<00:01:52.850> stamina

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
another perk and reinforce stamina

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.289 
another perk and reinforce stamina
health<00:01:53.509> or<00:01:53.720> Magica<00:01:54.200> so<00:01:54.920> you<00:01:55.790> do<00:01:56.030> have<00:01:56.210> the

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:56.299 
health or Magica so you do have the

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:57.550 
health or Magica so you do have the
disadvantage<00:01:56.540> of<00:01:56.840> get<00:01:57.170> losing<00:01:57.439> all<00:01:57.530> your

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
disadvantage of get losing all your

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.050 
disadvantage of get losing all your
perks<00:01:57.890> but<00:01:58.040> if<00:01:58.159> you<00:01:58.220> pick<00:01:58.399> something<00:01:58.430> useless

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
perks but if you pick something useless

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.630 
perks but if you pick something useless

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
you're gonna wonder what am I going to

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.180 
you're gonna wonder what am I going to
focus<00:03:20.050> on<00:03:20.260> right<00:03:20.290> now<00:03:20.470> well<00:03:20.860> what<00:03:21.040> I'm<00:03:21.130> going

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:21.190 
focus on right now well what I'm going

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:23.000 
focus on right now well what I'm going
to<00:03:21.280> focus<00:03:21.460> on<00:03:21.670> right<00:03:21.850> now<00:03:21.880> is<00:03:22.630> actually

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
to focus on right now is actually

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.740 
to focus on right now is actually
restoration<00:03:24.010> I<00:03:24.190> think<00:03:24.760> it's<00:03:24.880> very<00:03:24.940> useful<00:03:25.090> so

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
restoration I think it's very useful so

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.780 
restoration I think it's very useful so
let's<00:03:26.380> go<00:03:26.530> ahead<00:03:26.680> and<00:03:26.920> do<00:03:27.070> recovery<00:03:27.520> first

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
let's go ahead and do recovery first

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:30.210 
let's go ahead and do recovery first
because<00:03:28.210> then<00:03:28.360> 25%<00:03:28.900> faster<00:03:29.500> rate<00:03:29.740> recovers

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
because then 25% faster rate recovers

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.110 
because then 25% faster rate recovers
that's<00:03:30.670> good<00:03:31.050> that's<00:03:32.050> good<00:03:32.320> so<00:03:33.100> see<00:03:33.460> 50%

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
that's good that's good so see 50%

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:34.530 
that's good that's good so see 50%
faster

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:34.540 
faster

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:36.090 
faster
that's<00:03:34.870> amazing<00:03:35.140> automatically<00:03:35.860> that

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
that's amazing automatically that

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.740 
that's amazing automatically that
doubled<00:03:36.550> the<00:03:36.790> rate<00:03:37.060> of<00:03:37.240> my<00:03:37.360> magical

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
doubled the rate of my magical

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.840 
doubled the rate of my magical
restoration<00:03:38.320> you<00:03:39.130> know<00:03:39.250> you<00:03:39.310> can<00:03:39.520> never<00:03:39.640> go

or if you can like legend terrorize it
again<00:04:44.580> and<00:04:44.820> you<00:04:45.030> had<00:04:45.180> like<00:04:45.210> two<00:04:45.479> little<00:04:45.660> Skyrim

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:46.260 
again and you had like two little Skyrim

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:47.990 
again and you had like two little Skyrim
symbols<00:04:46.590> instead<00:04:46.740> of<00:04:46.860> one<00:04:47.010> not<00:04:47.580> entirely<00:04:47.850> sure

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 
symbols instead of one not entirely sure

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.840 
symbols instead of one not entirely sure
but<00:04:48.360> I<00:04:48.990> can<00:04:49.320> even<00:04:49.470> do<00:04:49.830> heavy<00:04:50.100> armor<00:04:50.490> but<00:04:50.669> that

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:50.850 
but I can even do heavy armor but that

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:53.240 
but I can even do heavy armor but that
have<00:04:51.090> you<00:04:51.180> armor<00:04:51.479> holding<00:04:51.900> two<00:04:52.020> because<00:04:52.440> like

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
have you armor holding two because like

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:56.090 
have you armor holding two because like
t<00:04:53.750> increases<00:04:54.750> are<00:04:55.110> waiting<00:04:55.440> for<00:04:55.500> heavy<00:04:55.800> armor

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:56.100 
t increases are waiting for heavy armor

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:57.950 
t increases are waiting for heavy armor
by<00:04:56.220> a<00:04:56.250> hundred<00:04:56.520> percent<00:04:56.639> I<00:04:57.090> have<00:04:57.419> it<00:04:57.720> all<00:04:57.930> the

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
by a hundred percent I have it all the

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.020 
by a hundred percent I have it all the
way<00:04:58.169> up<00:04:58.199> so<00:04:58.650> like<00:04:58.830> I'll<00:04:58.979> literally<00:04:59.340> be<00:04:59.669> really

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.030 
way up so like I'll literally be really

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:02.150 
way up so like I'll literally be really
weak<00:05:00.270> if<00:05:00.510> I<00:05:00.600> get<00:05:00.810> rid<00:05:00.960> of<00:05:01.080> it<00:05:01.229> I<00:05:01.410> really<00:05:01.979> don't

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 
weak if I get rid of it I really don't

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.430 
weak if I get rid of it I really don't
want<00:05:02.340> to<00:05:02.460> so<00:05:03.419> that's<00:05:03.960> probably<00:05:04.110> something<00:05:04.320> I

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
want to so that's probably something I

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.760 
want to so that's probably something I
will<00:05:04.560> never<00:05:04.710> legendre<00:05:05.250> eyes<00:05:05.370> and<00:05:05.610> if<00:05:05.729> I<00:05:05.940> do

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:06.770 
will never legendre eyes and if I do

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:08.750 
will never legendre eyes and if I do
I'll<00:05:07.770> probably<00:05:08.070> rely<00:05:08.400> a<00:05:08.430> lot<00:05:08.580> on<00:05:08.639> my

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:08.760 
I'll probably rely a lot on my

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:10.490 
I'll probably rely a lot on my
restoration<00:05:09.150> in<00:05:09.510> fact<00:05:09.720> I<00:05:09.840> may<00:05:09.990> actually<00:05:10.169> do

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 
restoration in fact I may actually do

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:15.560 
restoration in fact I may actually do
that<00:05:10.650> for<00:05:11.040> that<00:05:11.190> reason<00:05:11.550> but<00:05:12.300> um<00:05:12.600> yeah<00:05:14.330> like<00:05:15.330> I

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:15.570 
that for that reason but um yeah like I

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:17.000 
that for that reason but um yeah like I
don't<00:05:15.690> have<00:05:15.990> anything<00:05:16.290> else<00:05:16.590> that<00:05:16.680> I<00:05:16.800> really

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.010 
don't have anything else that I really

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:18.560 
don't have anything else that I really
want<00:05:17.280> so<00:05:17.490> there's<00:05:17.729> no<00:05:17.820> reason<00:05:18.150> sacrifice

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:18.570 
want so there's no reason sacrifice

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:23.360 
want so there's no reason sacrifice
