 do what the vegetables and so on and 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.560
 the ingredients are more important here 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.390
 I like the seasoning to so therefore I 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.449
 for spices and sauces and so 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.460
 missions and yes it shows that's going on 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.230
 do you need ingredients for you? 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.790

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.450
 really all things are still her 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.059
 home from paprika cauliflower carrots 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.530
 mushrooms so zucchini bean sprouts so 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.280
 There is really no limit to the fantasy 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.170
 set 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.840
 everything in this 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.370
 Direction fits you then just then 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.170
 I'll take glass noodles with me 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.120
 It really makes it clear that they are so 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.160
 So raise a little and then 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.289
 of course also rice and soy oil around 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.160
 The whole coriander around the 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:01.649
 to decorate whole and on spices and 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.449
 so I take kari pasta coffee limes 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.939
 She gets her leaves in the best 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.820
 edeka in this asia corner or in asia 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.170
 Market then fresh ginger curry powder 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.420
 Soy sauce instead of salt miracle of course 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.790
 still coconut milk there I find the dm 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.990
 from alnatura really mega awesome so 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.920
 Try them out more by heart 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.750
 as had not yet 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.460
 We just start like that to the 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.920
 He cooks rice as usual, he needs it like that 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.540
 that means it's the longest 20 minutes 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.610
 is always good to start with and 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.560
 then you can do that 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.390
 cut vegetables into appropriate sizes like that 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.250
 that the mouth is then then 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.630
 always dice very finely and 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.250
 Optionally, you can already do it 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.689
 The glass noodles in a bowl with 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.490
 pour over boiling water 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.560
 they need three minutes to go 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.630
 the soft ones are around until the al dente ga 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.490
 are and then you can then soybean oil in 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.560
 heat a wok and then gives the 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.659
 ginger the care4 lime leaves and 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.119
 Let the caritas in and let it all go 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.680
 lightly roast 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.840
 then add the vegetables with it 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.759
 and all in the flavored oil 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.649
 then it takes that so beautifully 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.820
 flavors and forms again 

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:01.380
 Himself up there 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.610
 if necessary, it could also be one 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.560
 few minutes later the glass noodles 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.299
 sometimes add it a bit 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.950
 later because yes in itself already very much 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.560
 have a lot of moisture and up 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.940
 otherwise it will be so muddy after about three 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.340
 We can do the whole thing for five minutes 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.540
 so that the coconut milk deglaze and then 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.700
 again continue to simmer a bit 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.200
 let the vegetables really be that way 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.690
 garpunkt has reached as you would like 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.709
 until the al dente is needed 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.450
 really only a few minutes 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.099
 otherwise stop longer if you have the one 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.569
 then want to have a bit softer 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:29.790
 you can still do it with curry powder 

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:32.370
 and soy sauce we will stop 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.870
 Season the salt and then everything 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.910
 arrange along with the rice 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.959
 maybe garnish with a little coriander 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.519
 and serve 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:40.470

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:50.959

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.890
