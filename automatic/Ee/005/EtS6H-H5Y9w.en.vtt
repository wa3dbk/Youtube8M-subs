00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.030
 hello how about personal friends of tomer 

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:04.470
 of means this is your channel and in this 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:08.720
 I'm going to show you a keyboard 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.720
 laser and good we begin 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:16.990
 very young that most of us 

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:20.109
 we are used to many use this 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:22.119
 type of mouse that are the mouse because 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:23.710
 have yes as a laser because before 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:25.750
 They were like ball but good we are 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.759
 used to using this type of mouse 

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:29.980
 we can click on any of the videos 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:33.579
 for example I did the third motogp 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:35.829
 generation and well this can move the 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:38.110
 speed and other things today should 

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:40.750
 present this alternative that is this 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.430
 mouse that is called odin wishes pins them 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.050
 will leave the link in the description and 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.610
 Well I asked for it and it made me pretty 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.620
 interesting to prove it they sent me 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.180
 also a case to store it and 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.860
 Well, you just have to see what 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.320
 we are going to open it so that you can 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.989
 observe what it is that includes us 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.489
 directly because the box simply 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:01:00.550
 will have to do a slip here comes what 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:03.040
 what is the logo and then nothing else 

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:05.860
 then we had to slide we're going to 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:09.090
 take out a small box and have like 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:11.170
 this are like some manuals I think 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.570
 they are indeed manuals then that 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.070
 really I do not care I guess 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.050
 must come some functions and how 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.750
 handle it then you must 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.550
 read it and good here comes the device 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.100
 that is like a robot is half weird 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.960
 well let's take it out and let's see what 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.080
 it includes the box because I think that nothing 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:31.270
 more is that and a usb cable to be able 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.979
 connect it to the computer directly 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:36.610
 and well, it's going to be as simple as 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:39.310
 just take our usb cable that 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:42.490
 one side is usb and the other side is 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:45.880
 micro usb there you can observe 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.860
 and we're just going to connect it to the 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.380
 device that the device in the 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.840
 back side comes with then the 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.490
 micro usb opening we're going to 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.869
 connect and we will connect in the 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.460
 computer of that for example we're going 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:00.520
 to leave on the table we will leave this 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.110
 mouse to the side I just connected it and 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.860
 you saw just turn on let's go to 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:07.960
 turn off the light 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.960
 and let's see let's put this other light 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.310
 and you can see that there is already 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.680
 directly the mouse we can move it 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:16.870
 what we want 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.790
 and it works and works pretty well and 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.650
 this I am going to show you simply 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.680
 we will have to place our finger on the 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.659
 part of there is cancer well to see 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.540
 here close simply you will have to place 

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:29.980
 the right click left click and we have 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.900
 some functions like with two fingers 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.269
 etcetera etcetera then let's see it 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:35.920
 on the screen directly and you 

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:37.659
 are watching here I'm moving 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.700
 directly the magician let's put him 

00:02:37.659 --> 00:02:42.430
 pause the video we can do the scroll 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.049
 with two fingers down you 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.420
 there you are seeing it 

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:48.459
 I 'm doing it pretty enough 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.780
 well just two fingers and here it 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:52.780
 can you see then that it works pretty 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.760
 well the scroll we go here and we can 

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:58.239
 select a page for example let's 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.189
 to go to the page of seraphim dotcom and 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:01.510
 well here is the page where I 

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:02.620
 I 'm going to leave it in the 

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.450
 description so they can go to 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.069
 buy it if they like it comes in 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.439
 white and black I asked for the black 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:09.939
 because it was made to me as more aesthetic 

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:11.859
 but you can choose then 

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:14.460
 here is like the timeline and 

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:16.320
 here as you can see I'm going down 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:18.390
 and so it's pretty simple because it 

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.190
 supposes that he has a better position and 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.320
 here we have the answers we have 

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.430
 some movements we can do the 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:26.310
 scroll that is the one that I am doing 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.690
 we can move the cursor from here to here 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.540
 to do as a selection and 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:33.210
 drag we can select to move 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:36.060
 the icons from the left click 

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:38.250
 down right slip zoom 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.870
 you can zoom in there is like you 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:43.740
 they may be seeing what they should 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:45.930
 to do is put it in a smooth part 

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:47.430
 because if you can not be in a little 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.370
 more complicated but for example here I go 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.810
 to pee to zoom out to 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.180
 zoom in 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.280
 and then there is the zoom then it is 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.810
 pretty well I think it's very 

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.300
 recommendable has enough actions 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:02.220
 that we can perform and go to 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:04.660
 be fine then but I'm going to leave 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.640
 here below in the description 

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.230
 and well, I think that has been all 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.640
 I hope you liked that they were 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:10.900
 liked to leave me a little hand up that 

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.210

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:23.370
