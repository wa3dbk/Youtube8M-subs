 the bar expires in here and that's 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.810
 to always pay attention to 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.279
 muscle level to not fall back

 know nothing so that's the first 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.079
 exercise their wing to tomorrow a tile

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.640
 take support for the bar my side 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:02.309
 to start your action and then 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:09.630
 you're going to shoot back up you have 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:11.189
 aimed at the ceiling with the other hand for 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.500
 a number of weft repetitions 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.880
 an exercise with the leaks be of a 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.880
 side and more of him 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:25.350
 another variant of the basic exercise 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.689
 they will concern wings this is the version 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.520
 alternate well you will take support 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.700
 always on your bar must go 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.190
 make a pull on one side say the 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:42.720
 bar on the other side of the alternating wells 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:44.630
 exercise left and right of course 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.009
 always watch your support 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.289
 relatively robust materials for 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:52.340
 avoid potential problems and all 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:52.340
 always control the autonomy 

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:03.470
 then the second group of technique 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:06.420
 regards exercises to succeed 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:09.000
 since you know when in karate and in 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.420
 sport one could say fist fists of 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.540
 hit 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.550
 we have a lot of exercise a 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.920
 repulsion and to do that we're going 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:21.090
 obviously use the pumps with 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:26.160
 some variants the first 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:29.820
