00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.920 
off because it does adhere to the hair

gotten clear you can't really see any of

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.410 
gotten clear you can't really see any of
the<00:00:59.010> latex<00:00:59.340> anymore<00:00:59.760> that's<00:00:59.969> when<00:01:00.149> you<00:01:00.270> know

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
the latex anymore that's when you know

the latex anymore that's when you know
that<00:01:00.570> it's<00:01:00.750> dry<00:01:01.079> is<00:01:01.350> that<00:01:01.559> it's<00:01:01.739> become<00:01:02.250> clear

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
that it's dry is that it's become clear

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.420 
that it's dry is that it's become clear
or<00:01:02.879> sort<00:01:03.539> of<00:01:03.629> more<00:01:03.989> like<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:04.650> skin<00:01:05.100> colour

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.240 
or sort of more like a skin colour
instead<00:01:05.820> of<00:01:06.000> this<00:01:06.150> white<00:01:06.450> pasty<00:01:06.960> pink<00:01:07.260> so<00:01:08.189> I'm

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:08.250 
instead of this white pasty pink so I'm

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.850 
instead of this white pasty pink so I'm
just<00:01:08.460> gonna<00:01:08.549> apply<00:01:08.760> another<00:01:09.330> layer

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
just gonna apply another layer

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.109 
just gonna apply another layer
keeping<00:01:10.860> in<00:01:10.979> mind<00:01:11.010> not<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:11.430> get<00:01:11.670> her<00:01:11.729> hair<00:01:11.939> in

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
keeping in mind not to get her hair in

keeping in mind not to get her hair in
it

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:14.710 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.620 

just<00:01:15.430> evenly<00:01:17.400> spreading<00:01:18.400> this<00:01:18.549> out<00:01:18.850> you<00:01:19.450> want

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
just evenly spreading this out you want

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.090 
just evenly spreading this out you want
to<00:01:19.720> make<00:01:19.840> it<00:01:19.990> thinner<00:01:20.290> at<00:01:20.440> the<00:01:20.530> edges<00:01:20.979> because

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
to make it thinner at the edges because

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.500 
to make it thinner at the edges because
that's<00:01:21.369> what<00:01:21.580> makes<00:01:21.729> it<00:01:21.909> look<00:01:21.970> like<00:01:22.180> it's

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:22.510 
that's what makes it look like it's

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.090 
that's what makes it look like it's
actually<00:01:22.960> your<00:01:23.080> skin<00:01:23.409> as<00:01:23.560> you<00:01:23.590> have<00:01:23.890> this

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
actually your skin as you have this

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.570 
actually your skin as you have this
blended<00:01:24.729> out<00:01:24.850> edge<00:01:25.119> here<00:01:25.690> so<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:27.100> bird<00:01:27.280> is<00:01:27.430> now

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
blended out edge here so the bird is now

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.469 
blended out edge here so the bird is now
ready<00:01:27.850> to<00:01:27.940> kind<00:01:28.390> of<00:01:28.450> start<00:01:28.690> working<00:01:29.200> with<00:01:29.409> here

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
ready to kind of start working with here

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.609 
ready to kind of start working with here
probably<00:01:31.479> wondering<00:01:31.810> how<00:01:31.930> it<00:01:32.050> becomes<00:01:32.229> a<00:01:32.409> burn

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:32.619 
probably wondering how it becomes a burn

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:34.880 
probably wondering how it becomes a burn
when<00:01:32.890> it's<00:01:33.040> just<00:01:33.250> a<00:01:33.430> couple<00:01:33.640> layers<00:01:33.880> of<00:01:34.000> latex

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
when it's just a couple layers of latex

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.440 
when it's just a couple layers of latex
it's<00:01:35.890> a<00:01:35.950> really<00:01:36.460> cool<00:01:36.670> process<00:01:36.909> and<00:01:37.360> it's

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
it's a really cool process and it's

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.480 
it's a really cool process and it's
really<00:01:37.780> easy<00:01:37.869> and<00:01:38.560> after<00:01:38.890> you<00:01:39.100> have<00:01:39.250> your

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.449 
create you're actually pulling it off
and<00:02:07.090> you<00:02:07.360> want<00:02:07.630> to<00:02:07.750> open<00:02:08.380> up<00:02:08.440> a<00:02:08.590> hole<00:02:08.890> in<00:02:09.130> it<00:02:09.280> and

00:02:09.449 --> 00:02:09.459 
and you want to open up a hole in it and

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:12.690 
and you want to open up a hole in it and
start<00:02:10.149> pulling<00:02:10.390> the<00:02:10.630> edges<00:02:10.989> out<00:02:11.250> that<00:02:12.250> looks

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
start pulling the edges out that looks

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.170 
start pulling the edges out that looks
like<00:02:12.910> it<00:02:13.060> ought<00:02:13.239> to<00:02:13.270> hurt<00:02:14.670> it's<00:02:15.670> basically

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
like it ought to hurt it's basically

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.290 
like it ought to hurt it's basically
just<00:02:16.330> kind<00:02:16.959> of<00:02:17.080> pinching<00:02:17.680> and<00:02:18.150> folding<00:02:19.150> the

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:19.300 
just kind of pinching and folding the

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.570 
just kind of pinching and folding the
skin<00:02:19.630> because<00:02:20.110> it's<00:02:20.260> already<00:02:20.590> adhered<00:02:21.250> to<00:02:21.430> it

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
skin because it's already adhered to it

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.009 
skin because it's already adhered to it
and<00:02:22.470> because<00:02:23.470> you<00:02:23.650> haven't<00:02:23.860> set<00:02:24.340> the<00:02:25.209> liquid

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:26.019 
and because you haven't set the liquid

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:28.710 
and because you haven't set the liquid
latex<00:02:26.440> after<00:02:26.950> it's<00:02:27.099> dried<00:02:27.489> it's<00:02:27.819> sticky<00:02:28.450> so

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
latex after it's dried it's sticky so

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.380 
latex after it's dried it's sticky so
it'll<00:02:28.900> stick<00:02:29.200> to<00:02:29.380> itself<00:02:29.769> and<00:02:30.250> this<00:02:30.940> is<00:02:31.000> kind

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
it'll stick to itself and this is kind

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.600 
it'll stick to itself and this is kind
of<00:02:31.450> like<00:02:31.690> what<00:02:31.930> will<00:02:32.019> happen<00:02:32.410> around<00:02:32.680> burns<00:02:33.310> is

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
of like what will happen around burns is

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.180 
of like what will happen around burns is
you'll<00:02:33.760> get<00:02:33.940> that<00:02:34.120> shrinkage<00:02:34.830> but<00:02:35.830> in<00:02:35.950> other

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
you'll get that shrinkage but in other

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.400 
you'll get that shrinkage but in other
areas<00:02:36.250> I'm<00:02:36.790> gonna<00:02:36.940> try<00:02:37.209> and<00:02:37.480> get<00:02:37.750> like<00:02:38.380> a

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
areas I'm gonna try and get like a

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.780 
areas I'm gonna try and get like a
bigger<00:02:38.739> hole<00:02:39.280> here<00:02:39.760> oh<00:02:41.069> I<00:02:42.069> have<00:02:42.519> this<00:02:42.640> little

bigger hole here oh I have this little

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.360 
bigger hole here oh I have this little
hole<00:02:43.090> here<00:02:43.120> and<00:02:43.870> so<00:02:44.620> I'm<00:02:44.709> just<00:02:44.860> kinda<00:02:45.100> gonna

hole here and so I'm just kinda gonna

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.320 
hole here and so I'm just kinda gonna
pull<00:02:46.060> the<00:02:46.239> edges<00:02:46.569> out<00:02:46.720> and<00:02:47.430> her<00:02:48.430> actual<00:02:48.880> skin

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
gonna be like the fresh skin underneath

00:02:54.010 --> 00:03:00.600 
gonna be like the fresh skin underneath
of<00:02:54.370> the<00:02:54.489> burn<00:02:54.700> part

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
and you can you can kind of roll it out

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.270 
and you can you can kind of roll it out
and<00:03:04.900> it's<00:03:05.110> always<00:03:05.320> good<00:03:05.620> to<00:03:05.710> have<00:03:05.860> research

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
and it's always good to have research

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:08.610 
and it's always good to have research
pictures<00:03:06.730> by<00:03:07.000> the<00:03:07.060> way<00:03:07.300> a<00:03:07.540> lot<00:03:08.080> of<00:03:08.110> people<00:03:08.200> try

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
pictures by the way a lot of people try

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.290 
pictures by the way a lot of people try
to<00:03:08.650> jump<00:03:09.010> in<00:03:09.160> and<00:03:09.310> do<00:03:09.490> this<00:03:09.640> without<00:03:10.060> looking

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300 
to jump in and do this without looking

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.420 
to jump in and do this without looking
at<00:03:10.600> anything<00:03:11.370> but<00:03:12.370> it's<00:03:12.490> always<00:03:12.940> good<00:03:13.210> to<00:03:13.390> have

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
pictures of what you want because you

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.520 
pictures of what you want because you
can<00:03:17.610> replicate<00:03:18.610> it<00:03:19.060> and<00:03:19.210> most<00:03:19.990> people<00:03:20.320> learn

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
can replicate it and most people learn

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.240 
can replicate it and most people learn
by<00:03:20.830> imitating<00:03:21.460> so<00:03:22.680> so<00:03:23.680> I'm<00:03:23.770> starting<00:03:24.040> another

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
by imitating so so I'm starting another

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.070 
by imitating so so I'm starting another
hole<00:03:24.550> here<00:03:24.850> and<00:03:25.120> kind<00:03:25.300> of<00:03:25.330> attaching<00:03:25.690> it<00:03:25.930> to

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.080 
hole here and kind of attaching it to

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:31.200 
hole here and kind of attaching it to
the<00:03:26.170> other<00:03:26.350> one<00:03:27.300> pulling<00:03:28.300> it<00:03:28.420> apart<00:03:30.210> creating

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:31.210 
the other one pulling it apart creating

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:34.500 
the other one pulling it apart creating
a<00:03:31.450> sort<00:03:32.110> of<00:03:32.170> lip<00:03:32.530> here<00:03:32.970> but<00:03:33.970> I'm<00:03:34.120> gonna<00:03:34.270> start

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:34.510 
a sort of lip here but I'm gonna start

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.510 
a sort of lip here but I'm gonna start
going<00:03:34.810> in<00:03:34.930> there<00:03:35.140> and<00:03:35.410> creating<00:03:35.920> this<00:03:36.070> sort<00:03:36.430> of

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:36.520 
going in there and creating this sort of

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:41.810 
going in there and creating this sort of
red<00:03:37.440> burned<00:03:38.440> look<00:03:38.950> here<00:03:39.340> on<00:03:39.550> her<00:03:39.970> actual<00:03:40.360> face

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
red burned look here on her actual face

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.190 
red burned look here on her actual face
shading<00:03:42.820> is<00:03:42.970> very<00:03:43.300> important<00:03:43.870> because<00:03:43.990> you

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
shading is very important because you

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.770 
shading is very important because you
don't<00:03:44.320> want<00:03:44.530> it<00:03:44.620> to<00:03:44.740> look<00:03:44.860> 2d<00:03:45.390> you<00:03:46.390> want<00:03:46.540> it<00:03:46.630> to

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
don't want it to look 2d you want it to

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:51.150 
don't want it to look 2d you want it to
look<00:03:47.760> very<00:03:48.760> dimensional<00:03:49.680> so<00:03:50.680> you<00:03:50.740> get<00:03:50.890> the

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
look very dimensional so you get the

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.240 
look very dimensional so you get the
darker<00:03:51.520> edges<00:03:51.730> future<00:03:52.300> shadows<00:03:52.810> there<00:03:53.250> you

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
darker edges future shadows there you

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:59.220 
darker edges future shadows there you
can<00:03:54.400> go<00:03:54.610> into<00:03:54.970> all<00:03:55.300> these<00:03:55.780> other<00:03:55.840> places<00:03:58.230> you

00:03:59.220 --> 00:03:59.230 
can go into all these other places you

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.480 
can go into all these other places you
have<00:03:59.410> pinches<00:03:59.950> and<00:04:00.430> pulls<00:04:00.790> a<00:04:01.740> good<00:04:02.740> rule<00:04:03.459> of

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:03.490 
have pinches and pulls a good rule of

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:05.340 
have pinches and pulls a good rule of
thumb<00:04:03.640> is<00:04:03.880> if<00:04:04.270> you<00:04:04.420> want<00:04:04.660> it<00:04:04.720> to<00:04:04.840> look<00:04:04.959> fresh

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:05.350 
thumb is if you want it to look fresh

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:09.300 
thumb is if you want it to look fresh

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:11.350 
you want it to look like it's decayed

you want to use browns and greens and
things<00:04:14.980> that<00:04:15.390> would<00:04:16.390> come<00:04:16.660> after<00:04:16.989> an

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 
things that would come after an

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.020 
things that would come after an
infection<00:04:17.620> so<00:04:18.250> think<00:04:18.790> about<00:04:19.019> pus<00:04:20.790> think<00:04:21.790> about

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
infection so think about pus think about

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:24.270 
infection so think about pus think about
things<00:04:22.270> like<00:04:22.360> that<00:04:22.750> look<00:04:23.290> up<00:04:23.470> pictures<00:04:23.680> if<00:04:24.190> you

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
things like that look up pictures if you

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.300 
things like that look up pictures if you
can<00:04:24.550> if<00:04:24.880> you<00:04:25.060> aren't<00:04:25.660> squeamish<00:04:26.169> so<00:04:27.040> once<00:04:27.220> you

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:27.310 
can if you aren't squeamish so once you

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:30.540 
can if you aren't squeamish so once you
have<00:04:27.400> that<00:04:27.580> basic<00:04:28.320> red<00:04:29.320> on<00:04:29.470> there<00:04:29.680> I<00:04:29.890> go<00:04:30.400> in

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
have that basic red on there I go in

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.520 
have that basic red on there I go in
with<00:04:30.700> a<00:04:30.730> darker<00:04:31.360> kind<00:04:31.690> of<00:04:31.810> reddish-brown

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
with a darker kind of reddish-brown

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.570 
with a darker kind of reddish-brown
color<00:04:32.950> and<00:04:34.440> I<00:04:35.440> just<00:04:35.470> start<00:04:36.010> making<00:04:36.430> the

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:36.580 
color and I just start making the

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:42.480 
color and I just start making the
shadows<00:04:37.030> deeper<00:04:37.510> here

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:45.219 

good<00:04:43.490> rule<00:04:43.759> of<00:04:43.910> thumb<00:04:44.150> with<00:04:44.330> makeup<00:04:44.810> like<00:04:44.990> this

00:04:45.219 --> 00:04:45.229 
good rule of thumb with makeup like this

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:48.610 
good rule of thumb with makeup like this
is<00:04:45.530> less<00:04:46.099> is<00:04:46.460> more<00:04:47.210> you<00:04:47.629> don't<00:04:48.139> want<00:04:48.259> to<00:04:48.319> overdo

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:48.620 
is less is more you don't want to overdo

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:51.129 
is less is more you don't want to overdo
it<00:04:48.889> because<00:04:49.190> you<00:04:49.430> want<00:04:49.639> lighter<00:04:50.629> stuff<00:04:51.020> to

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:51.139 
it because you want lighter stuff to

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:52.689 
it because you want lighter stuff to
come<00:04:51.319> through<00:04:51.620> a<00:04:51.650> lot<00:04:51.860> of<00:04:51.979> people<00:04:52.280> kind<00:04:52.580> of

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:52.699 
come through a lot of people kind of

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:55.119 
come through a lot of people kind of
like<00:04:52.879> put<00:04:53.120> a<00:04:53.150> whole<00:04:53.449> bunch<00:04:53.479> on<00:04:53.960> and<00:04:54.289> expect<00:04:55.009> it

00:04:55.119 --> 00:04:55.129 
like put a whole bunch on and expect it

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:57.279 
like put a whole bunch on and expect it
to<00:04:55.280> look<00:04:55.460> good<00:04:55.699> but<00:04:56.360> it<00:04:56.479> won't<00:04:56.750> because<00:04:57.169> you're

00:04:57.279 --> 00:04:57.289 
to look good but it won't because you're

00:04:57.289 --> 00:04:58.809 
to look good but it won't because you're
not<00:04:57.470> getting<00:04:57.830> the<00:04:58.009> highlights<00:04:58.490> and<00:04:58.759> the

00:04:58.809 --> 00:04:58.819 
not getting the highlights and the

00:04:58.819 --> 00:05:01.689 
not getting the highlights and the
shadows<00:04:58.970> and<00:04:59.690> things<00:04:59.870> like<00:05:00.080> that<00:05:00.319> I<00:05:00.699> noticed

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:01.699 
shadows and things like that I noticed

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:04.180 
shadows and things like that I noticed
that<00:05:01.819> this<00:05:01.909> particular<00:05:02.120> liquid<00:05:02.720> latex<00:05:03.080> is<00:05:03.530> not

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.190 
that this particular liquid latex is not

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:06.520 
that this particular liquid latex is not
too<00:05:04.430> far<00:05:04.639> off<00:05:04.819> from<00:05:04.849> her<00:05:05.180> skin<00:05:05.389> tone<00:05:05.599> if<00:05:06.379> you're

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:06.530 
too far off from her skin tone if you're

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:08.439 
too far off from her skin tone if you're
african-american<00:05:06.949> or<00:05:07.520> Hispanic<00:05:07.970> or<00:05:08.270> anything

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:08.449 
african-american or Hispanic or anything

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:09.279 
african-american or Hispanic or anything
like<00:05:08.750> that

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:09.289 
like that

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:10.960 
like that
are<00:05:09.470> there<00:05:10.039> different<00:05:10.370> shades<00:05:10.580> of<00:05:10.669> liquid

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:10.970 
are there different shades of liquid

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:13.749 
are there different shades of liquid
latex<00:05:11.240> um<00:05:11.599> you<00:05:12.229> know<00:05:12.380> you<00:05:12.470> can<00:05:12.830> mix<00:05:13.159> liquid

00:05:13.749 --> 00:05:13.759 
latex um you know you can mix liquid

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:17.920 
latex um you know you can mix liquid
latex<00:05:14.270> with<00:05:14.780> paint<00:05:15.909> just<00:05:16.909> acrylic<00:05:17.330> paint<00:05:17.630> and

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:17.930 
latex with paint just acrylic paint and

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:20.649 
latex with paint just acrylic paint and
it<00:05:18.560> will<00:05:18.770> create<00:05:19.190> a<00:05:19.310> color<00:05:19.580> that<00:05:19.789> you<00:05:19.909> want<00:05:20.150> but

00:05:20.649 --> 00:05:20.659 
it will create a color that you want but

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:22.659 
it will create a color that you want but
what<00:05:20.930> I<00:05:20.960> recommend<00:05:21.229> doing<00:05:21.620> is<00:05:21.889> just<00:05:22.190> having

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:22.669 
what I recommend doing is just having

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:24.370 
what I recommend doing is just having
the<00:05:22.819> liquid<00:05:23.120> latex<00:05:23.419> on<00:05:23.690> there<00:05:23.930> and<00:05:24.080> then

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:24.380 
the liquid latex on there and then

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:27.370 
the liquid latex on there and then
covering<00:05:25.159> it<00:05:25.340> with<00:05:25.550> a<00:05:25.610> base<00:05:25.909> color<00:05:26.360> so<00:05:27.169> her

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:27.380 
covering it with a base color so her

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:29.080 
covering it with a base color so her
face<00:05:27.590> is<00:05:27.800> pretty<00:05:28.039> close<00:05:28.280> to<00:05:28.310> what<00:05:28.639> the<00:05:28.759> liquid

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:29.090 
face is pretty close to what the liquid

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:31.080 
face is pretty close to what the liquid
latex<00:05:29.449> is<00:05:29.750> but<00:05:30.440> if<00:05:30.590> she<00:05:30.860> were

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:31.090 
latex is but if she were

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:33.309 
latex is but if she were
african-american<00:05:32.090> or<00:05:32.330> if<00:05:32.419> she<00:05:32.690> were<00:05:32.870> Mexican

00:05:33.309 --> 00:05:33.319 
african-american or if she were Mexican

00:05:33.319 --> 00:05:35.680 
african-american or if she were Mexican
American<00:05:33.800> I<00:05:33.979> would<00:05:34.310> probably<00:05:34.849> pick<00:05:35.330> a<00:05:35.360> base

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:35.690 
American I would probably pick a base

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:38.140 
American I would probably pick a base
color<00:05:36.080> and<00:05:36.409> then<00:05:36.770> cover<00:05:37.069> the<00:05:37.340> entire<00:05:37.729> thing

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:38.150 
color and then cover the entire thing

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:40.059 
color and then cover the entire thing
with<00:05:38.509> a<00:05:38.569> color<00:05:38.870> that<00:05:39.050> matched<00:05:39.319> her<00:05:39.500> face<00:05:39.770> to

00:05:40.059 --> 00:05:40.069 
with a color that matched her face to

00:05:40.069 --> 00:05:41.529 
with a color that matched her face to
match<00:05:40.190> it<00:05:40.430> first<00:05:40.729> so<00:05:41.180> if<00:05:41.240> you're<00:05:41.360> a<00:05:41.389> woman

00:05:41.529 --> 00:05:41.539 
match it first so if you're a woman

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:43.480 
match it first so if you're a woman
whatever<00:05:41.870> makeup<00:05:42.199> base<00:05:42.830> you<00:05:43.039> would<00:05:43.190> normally

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:43.490 
whatever makeup base you would normally

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:46.320 
whatever makeup base you would normally
use<00:05:43.520> the<00:05:43.759> foundation<00:05:44.060> would<00:05:44.389> be<00:05:44.509> fine<00:05:44.659> exactly

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:46.330 
use the foundation would be fine exactly

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:49.209 
use the foundation would be fine exactly
so<00:05:47.330> yeah<00:05:47.509> that's<00:05:47.810> pretty<00:05:47.930> much<00:05:48.440> it<00:05:48.770> if<00:05:49.069> you

00:05:49.209 --> 00:05:49.219 
so yeah that's pretty much it if you

00:05:49.219 --> 00:05:51.279 
so yeah that's pretty much it if you
wanted<00:05:49.550> to<00:05:49.729> use<00:05:50.030> if<00:05:50.419> you<00:05:50.599> wanted<00:05:50.870> to<00:05:50.990> make<00:05:51.139> it

00:05:51.279 --> 00:05:51.289 
wanted to use if you wanted to make it

00:05:51.289 --> 00:05:53.469 
wanted to use if you wanted to make it
look<00:05:51.530> like<00:05:51.740> charred<00:05:52.190> or<00:05:52.550> bruised<00:05:53.030> you

00:05:53.469 --> 00:05:53.479 
look like charred or bruised you

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:55.330 
look like charred or bruised you
obviously<00:05:53.990> want<00:05:54.169> to<00:05:54.229> go<00:05:54.380> with<00:05:54.530> a<00:05:54.560> darker<00:05:55.039> black

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:55.340 
obviously want to go with a darker black

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:58.029 
obviously want to go with a darker black
sort<00:05:55.819> of<00:05:55.909> color<00:05:56.180> so<00:05:57.080> you<00:05:57.169> can<00:05:57.349> go<00:05:57.560> in<00:05:57.770> there<00:05:58.009> and

00:05:58.029 --> 00:05:58.039 
sort of color so you can go in there and

00:05:58.039 --> 00:06:02.559 
sort of color so you can go in there and
kind<00:05:58.550> of<00:05:58.639> create<00:05:58.969> a<00:05:59.210> little<00:05:59.810> charred<00:06:01.509> sort<00:06:02.509> of

00:06:02.559 --> 00:06:02.569 
kind of create a little charred sort of

00:06:02.569 --> 00:06:10.140 
kind of create a little charred sort of
burns<00:06:02.990> here

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:10.150 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:14.180 

so<00:06:10.720> now<00:06:10.840> it's<00:06:10.990> really<00:06:11.290> starting<00:06:11.620> to<00:06:11.800> look<00:06:12.040> like

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:14.190 
so now it's really starting to look like
