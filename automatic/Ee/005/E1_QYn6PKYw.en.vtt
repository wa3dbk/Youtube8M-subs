00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
CD for win actually has the recovery

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.410 
CD for win actually has the recovery
console<00:00:59.070> itself<00:00:59.250> for<00:00:59.760> themselves<00:01:00.149> i'm<00:01:00.300> going

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
console itself for themselves i'm going

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.510

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
thing as the windows XP the only

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.630 
thing as the windows XP the only
difference<00:01:12.780> is<00:01:13.049> they<00:01:13.200> this<00:01:13.500> has<00:01:13.680> a<00:01:13.710> extra
