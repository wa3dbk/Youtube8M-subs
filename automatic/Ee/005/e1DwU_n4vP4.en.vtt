00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:06.430 
this is our video to just show how our

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:09.990 
this is our video to just show how our
hip<00:00:06.700> flashing<00:00:07.180> would<00:00:07.300> work<00:00:08.490> the<00:00:09.490> profile<00:00:09.970> of

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:10.000 
hip flashing would work the profile of

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.590 
hip flashing would work the profile of
the<00:00:10.269> hip<00:00:10.420> flashing<00:00:11.940> three<00:00:12.940> and<00:00:13.060> a<00:00:13.090> half<00:00:13.210> inches

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:13.600 
the hip flashing three and a half inches

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:19.980 
the hip flashing three and a half inches
each<00:00:13.810> side<00:00:14.170> of<00:00:14.380> Center<00:00:18.390> I'm<00:00:19.390> assuming<00:00:19.930> I'm

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:19.990 
each side of Center I'm assuming I'm

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:26.970 
each side of Center I'm assuming I'm
going<00:00:20.230> up<00:00:20.350> a<00:00:20.470> hip<00:00:20.590> line<00:00:20.830> here<00:00:25.860> generally<00:00:26.860> at

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:26.980 
going up a hip line here generally at

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.930 
going up a hip line here generally at
the<00:00:27.100> bottom<00:00:27.460> end<00:00:27.670> I'll<00:00:28.300> cut<00:00:28.660> and<00:00:28.810> fold<00:00:29.110> here<00:00:29.500> I

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:29.940 
the bottom end I'll cut and fold here I

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:36.800 
the bottom end I'll cut and fold here I
can<00:00:30.940> just<00:00:30.970> I<00:00:34.020> can<00:00:35.020> look<00:00:35.140> down<00:00:35.380> mine<00:00:35.649> might

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:36.810 
can just I can look down mine might

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:39.300 
can just I can look down mine might
start<00:00:37.810> of<00:00:37.930> shingle<00:00:38.260> there<00:00:38.500> I<00:00:38.530> see<00:00:38.950> that<00:00:39.130> this

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:39.310 
start of shingle there I see that this

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:43.639 
start of shingle there I see that this
is<00:00:39.489> the<00:00:39.760> way<00:00:39.880> it<00:00:39.970> comes<00:00:40.090> across<00:00:40.239> here<00:00:42.090> here<00:00:43.090> and

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
is the way it comes across here here and

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.200 
is the way it comes across here here and
if<00:00:44.649> I<00:00:44.770> want<00:00:44.950> to<00:00:45.040> fold<00:00:45.309> on<00:00:45.610> I<00:00:45.880> should<00:00:46.059> be<00:00:46.180> a

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:46.210 
if I want to fold on I should be a

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:53.549 
if I want to fold on I should be a
little<00:00:46.510> bit<00:00:46.980> longer<00:00:47.980> there<00:00:52.170> I'm<00:00:53.170> going<00:00:53.320> to<00:00:53.410> cut

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:53.559 
little bit longer there I'm going to cut

00:00:53.559 --> 00:01:14.340 
little bit longer there I'm going to cut
the<00:00:53.739> rib<00:01:02.219> at<00:01:03.509> this<00:01:04.509> end<00:01:04.809> corner<00:01:13.140> I'm<00:01:14.140> going<00:01:14.229> to

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
the rib at this end corner I'm going to

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.060 
the rib at this end corner I'm going to
cut<00:01:14.530> it<00:01:14.650> back<00:01:14.830> a<00:01:14.890> little<00:01:15.070> bit<00:01:15.250> out<00:01:15.400> of<00:01:15.460> the<00:01:15.520> way

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
cut it back a little bit out of the way

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:26.820 
cut it back a little bit out of the way
I'm<00:01:18.070> going<00:01:18.220> to<00:01:18.310> bend<00:01:18.490> this<00:01:18.729> one<00:01:19.030> down

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:26.830 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:28.950 

now<00:01:27.370> I'm<00:01:27.490> just<00:01:27.640> going<00:01:27.820> to<00:01:27.880> make<00:01:28.060> the<00:01:28.270> bend<00:01:28.540> here

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
now I'm just going to make the bend here

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.040 
now I'm just going to make the bend here
now<00:01:29.610> it's<00:01:30.610> easier<00:01:30.970> to<00:01:31.090> do<00:01:31.210> with<00:01:31.390> this<00:01:31.540> piece<00:01:31.810> is

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:32.050 
now it's easier to do with this piece is

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:52.610 
now it's easier to do with this piece is
larger<00:01:34.890> and<00:01:36.270> then<00:01:37.270> I'll<00:01:37.450> cut<00:01:37.720> the<00:01:38.440> second<00:01:38.860> line

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:52.620 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.260 

when<00:01:53.620> these<00:01:53.770> overlap<00:01:54.220> they're<00:01:54.580> going<00:01:54.730> to<00:01:54.790> run

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270 
when these overlap they're going to run

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
when these overlap they're going to run
into<00:01:55.300> each<00:01:55.600> other<00:01:55.810> I'm<00:01:55.960> going<00:01:56.050> to<00:01:56.170> take<00:01:56.260> a

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 
into each other I'm going to take a

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:04.800 
into each other I'm going to take a
little<00:01:56.470> more<00:01:56.590> material<00:01:57.070> off<00:01:57.190> the<00:01:57.220> corner<00:02:03.810> and

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:04.810 
little more material off the corner and

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.400 
little more material off the corner and
now<00:02:05.710> I<00:02:05.740> should<00:02:06.160> be<00:02:06.190> able<00:02:06.310> to<00:02:07.200> bend<00:02:08.200> them<00:02:08.350> a

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
now I should be able to bend them a

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:21.510 
now I should be able to bend them a
little<00:02:08.619> sharper<00:02:09.010> around<00:02:20.160> so<00:02:21.160> they're<00:02:21.370> the

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
little sharper around so they're the

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.640 
little sharper around so they're the
bottom<00:02:21.820> of<00:02:21.940> my<00:02:22.120> hip<00:02:22.390> is<00:02:22.570> hooked<00:02:22.840> on<00:02:22.960> plate<00:02:23.500> in

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
bottom of my hip is hooked on plate in

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.410 
bottom of my hip is hooked on plate in
place<00:02:25.620> and<00:02:26.620> then<00:02:27.550> I<00:02:27.580> would<00:02:27.880> use<00:02:28.030> the<00:02:28.390> same

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:28.420 
place and then I would use the same

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.310 
place and then I would use the same
screws<00:02:29.320> again<00:02:29.560> with<00:02:29.980> the<00:02:30.070> rubber<00:02:30.220> washers<00:02:30.730> and

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
screws again with the rubber washers and

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.740 
screws again with the rubber washers and
fast<00:02:32.320> them<00:02:32.700> just<00:02:33.700> a<00:02:33.790> little<00:02:34.030> back<00:02:34.239> from<00:02:34.600> the

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
fast them just a little back from the

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:41.120 
fast them just a little back from the
line<00:02:36.420> every<00:02:37.420> two<00:02:38.140> feet<00:02:38.170> up<00:02:38.680> the<00:02:39.220> hip<00:02:39.340> line<00:02:39.959> and

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
line every two feet up the hip line and

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.790 
line every two feet up the hip line and
that's<00:02:42.130> it<00:02:42.280> for<00:02:42.489> my<00:02:42.610> hip
