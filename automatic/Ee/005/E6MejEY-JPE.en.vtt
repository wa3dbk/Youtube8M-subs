00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
you can actually see what they're trying

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.450 
you can actually see what they're trying
to<00:00:20.580> do<00:00:20.910> with<00:00:21.390> these<00:00:21.689> books<00:00:22.140> in<00:00:22.439> themselves<00:00:23.070> in

to do with these books in themselves in

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:24.980 
to do with these books in themselves in
the<00:00:23.550> way<00:00:23.730> that<00:00:23.970> they<00:00:24.029> actually<00:00:24.240> align<00:00:24.810> up

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
the way that they actually align up

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.170 
the way that they actually align up
together<00:00:25.170> and<00:00:25.590> I<00:00:26.099> really<00:00:26.369> like<00:00:26.519> the<00:00:26.730> idea<00:00:26.760> of

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
together and I really like the idea of

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.330 
together and I really like the idea of
the<00:00:27.359> gold<00:00:27.840> motives<00:00:28.380> on<00:00:28.650> the<00:00:28.769> brown<00:00:28.980> because

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
the gold motives on the brown because

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.519 
the gold motives on the brown because
we're<00:00:29.609> on<00:00:29.730> you'd<00:00:29.910> usually<00:00:30.090> think<00:00:30.570> of<00:00:30.810> as<00:00:31.109> a

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
we're on you'd usually think of as a

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.680 
we're on you'd usually think of as a
really<00:00:31.920> kind<00:00:32.040> of<00:00:32.160> boring<00:00:32.610> color<00:00:33.059> that's

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
really kind of boring color that's

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:34.729 
really kind of boring color that's
something<00:00:34.110> that<00:00:34.140> you<00:00:34.350> wouldn't<00:00:34.620> necessarily

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
something that you wouldn't necessarily

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.060 
something that you wouldn't necessarily
pick<00:00:35.670> but<00:00:36.270> page<00:00:36.750> of<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.020> gold<00:00:37.260> it<00:00:37.590> definitely

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
pick but page of the gold it definitely

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.130 
pick but page of the gold it definitely
brings<00:00:38.250> something<00:00:38.579> out<00:00:38.850> of<00:00:38.879> it<00:00:39.149> and<00:00:39.329> it<00:00:39.930> adds

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
brings something out of it and it adds

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.380 
brings something out of it and it adds
to<00:00:40.440> the<00:00:40.559> kind<00:00:40.739> of<00:00:40.890> vintage<00:00:41.100> feel<00:00:41.520> as<00:00:41.730> these

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
to the kind of vintage feel as these

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.840 
to the kind of vintage feel as these
little<00:00:42.780> the<00:00:43.350> little<00:00:43.379> motifs<00:00:43.980> on<00:00:44.219> the<00:00:44.309> side<00:00:44.550> as

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
little the little motifs on the side as

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.660 
little the little motifs on the side as
well<00:00:45.210> kind<00:00:45.930> of<00:00:46.110> resonate<00:00:46.559> what's<00:00:46.800> in<00:00:47.070> the<00:00:47.430> book

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
well kind of resonate what's in the book

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.430 
well kind of resonate what's in the book
itself<00:00:47.969> people<00:00:48.870> that<00:00:48.960> have<00:00:49.050> read<00:00:49.170> this<00:00:49.289> will

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
itself people that have read this will

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.330 
itself people that have read this will
actually<00:00:49.559> know<00:00:49.800> what<00:00:49.920> I'm<00:00:49.980> talking<00:00:50.280> about

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
actually know what I'm talking about

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.029 
actually know what I'm talking about
like<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:50.730> era<00:00:50.940> that<00:00:51.149> part<00:00:51.780> of<00:00:52.020> it<00:00:52.140> is<00:00:52.410> set<00:00:52.800> it's

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
like the era that part of it is set it's

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.389 
like the era that part of it is set it's
quite<00:00:53.280> vintage<00:00:54.030> as<00:00:54.329> such<00:00:54.660> so<00:00:55.230> these<00:00:55.440> kind<00:00:56.280> of

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
quite vintage as such so these kind of

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.220 
quite vintage as such so these kind of
little<00:00:56.670> motifs<00:00:57.120> on<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.539> bottom<00:00:57.840> and<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.020> tops

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
little motifs on the bottom and the tops

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.529 
little motifs on the bottom and the tops
of<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.469> spine<00:00:58.680> actually<00:00:59.309> makes<00:00:59.820> sense<00:00:59.969> with

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
of the spine actually makes sense with

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.840 
of the spine actually makes sense with
the<00:01:00.570> book<00:01:00.870> itself<00:01:01.020> and<00:01:01.739> it<00:01:02.190> kind<00:01:02.430> of<00:01:02.520> reminds

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
the book itself and it kind of reminds

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.170 
the book itself and it kind of reminds
me<00:01:03.000> of<00:01:03.120> old<00:01:03.710> classic<00:01:04.710> books<00:01:04.949> as<00:01:05.159> well<00:01:05.400> with<00:01:05.850> the

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
me of old classic books as well with the

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.990 
me of old classic books as well with the
little<00:01:06.479> top<00:01:06.630> and<00:01:06.840> bottom<00:01:07.110> designs<00:01:08.100> intended

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
little top and bottom designs intended

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.270 
little top and bottom designs intended
to<00:01:09.090> outline<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:09.630> spine<00:01:10.110> rather<00:01:10.650> than<00:01:10.950> to

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
to outline the spine rather than to

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.670 
to outline the spine rather than to
actually<00:01:11.430> decorate<00:01:12.360> them<00:01:12.600> in<00:01:12.810> full<00:01:13.170> from<00:01:13.500> what

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
actually decorate them in full from what

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.260 
actually decorate them in full from what
I've<00:01:13.830> actually<00:01:13.979> seen<00:01:14.369> but<00:01:14.729> I<00:01:14.760> just<00:01:14.970> generally

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
I've actually seen but I just generally

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.550 
I've actually seen but I just generally
think<00:01:15.479> that<00:01:15.600> these<00:01:15.720> spines<00:01:16.020> are<00:01:16.290> really

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
think that these spines are really

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.620 
think that these spines are really
beautiful<00:01:16.710> really<00:01:17.189> simple<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:18.000> just<00:01:18.420> really

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
beautiful really simple and just really

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.749 
beautiful really simple and just really
stylistic<00:01:19.350> more<00:01:19.530> than<00:01:19.680> anything<00:01:19.890> a<00:01:20.220> monster

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
stylistic more than anything a monster

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.969 
stylistic more than anything a monster
caused<00:01:20.939> by<00:01:21.150> Patrick<00:01:21.600> Ness<00:01:21.630> this<00:01:22.290> spine<00:01:22.650> is

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
caused by Patrick Ness this spine is

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.380 
caused by Patrick Ness this spine is
actually<00:01:23.430> really<00:01:23.640> different<00:01:24.060> because<00:01:24.119> the

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
actually really different because the

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.450 
actually really different because the
fact<00:01:24.570> that<00:01:24.630> it's<00:01:24.810> rounded<00:01:25.530> rather<00:01:26.189> than

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
fact that it's rounded rather than

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.670 
fact that it's rounded rather than
square<00:01:26.880> because<00:01:27.390> a<00:01:27.420> lot<00:01:27.600> of<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:28.020> books<00:01:28.229> I<00:01:28.439> own

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
square because a lot of the books I own

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.580 
square because a lot of the books I own
and<00:01:28.920> just<00:01:29.009> like<00:01:29.280> flat<00:01:30.060> flat<00:01:30.630> flat<00:01:30.659> so<00:01:31.409> it's

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
and just like flat flat flat so it's

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.350 
and just like flat flat flat so it's
more<00:01:31.770> of<00:01:31.890> a<00:01:31.979> rectangular<00:01:32.460> book<00:01:32.790> but<00:01:33.060> this<00:01:33.180> is<00:01:33.329> a

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
more of a rectangular book but this is a

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.080 
more of a rectangular book but this is a
more<00:01:33.630> of<00:01:33.750> a<00:01:33.869> kind<00:01:34.320> of<00:01:34.490> rounded<00:01:35.490> one<00:01:35.700> as<00:01:35.939> well

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
more of a kind of rounded one as well

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.690 
more of a kind of rounded one as well
and<00:01:36.299> I<00:01:36.360> think<00:01:36.630> that<00:01:36.750> adds<00:01:36.900> to<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.700> prettiness

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
and I think that adds to the prettiness

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.310 
and I think that adds to the prettiness
of<00:01:39.030> the<00:01:39.210> design<00:01:39.540> because<00:01:39.840> of<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.020> fact<00:01:40.200> that

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
of the design because of the fact that

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.990 
of the design because of the fact that
it's<00:01:40.530> something<00:01:40.799> really<00:01:41.280> different<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.880> what

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
it's something really different to what

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.270 
it's something really different to what
i<00:01:42.060> normally<00:01:42.240> own<00:01:42.720> but<00:01:43.439> with<00:01:43.470> regards<00:01:44.040> to<00:01:44.100> the

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
i normally own but with regards to the

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.490 
i normally own but with regards to the
actual<00:01:44.490> design<00:01:44.820> on<00:01:45.119> the<00:01:45.450> spine<00:01:45.720> itself<00:01:45.899> I

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
actual design on the spine itself I

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.260 
actual design on the spine itself I
really<00:01:46.740> enjoy<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.130> typography<00:01:47.729> on<00:01:47.850> this<00:01:48.000> it's

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
really enjoy the typography on this it's

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.080 
really enjoy the typography on this it's
a<00:01:48.329> normal<00:01:48.509> sans-serif<00:01:49.140> text<00:01:49.979> but<00:01:50.490> it<00:01:50.759> looks<00:01:51.000> as

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
a normal sans-serif text but it looks as

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.340 
a normal sans-serif text but it looks as
though<00:01:51.149> it's<00:01:51.360> been<00:01:51.450> left<00:01:51.600> out<00:01:51.750> in<00:01:51.780> the<00:01:51.899> rain<00:01:51.990> is

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
though it's been left out in the rain is

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.260 
though it's been left out in the rain is
there<00:01:52.500> are<00:01:52.590> actually<00:01:52.829> smudges<00:01:53.280> and<00:01:53.310> you<00:01:54.119> can

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
there are actually smudges and you can

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.719 
there are actually smudges and you can
see<00:01:54.420> where<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:54.810> ink<00:01:55.259> looks<00:01:55.590> as<00:01:55.799> though<00:01:55.979> it<00:01:56.280> has

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
see where the ink looks as though it has

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.389 
see where the ink looks as though it has
run<00:01:57.299> from<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.320> rain<00:01:58.500> or<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:58.829> water<00:01:59.100> that's

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
run from the rain or the water that's

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.609 
run from the rain or the water that's
been<00:01:59.520> splashed<00:01:59.820> on<00:02:00.030> it<00:02:00.210> and<00:02:00.390> I<00:02:01.020> like<00:02:01.200> the<00:02:01.229> way

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
been splashed on it and I like the way

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.399 
been splashed on it and I like the way
that<00:02:01.979> part<00:02:02.640> of<00:02:02.909> the<00:02:03.270> front<00:02:03.570> and<00:02:03.750> back<00:02:03.930> designs

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
that part of the front and back designs

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.590 
that part of the front and back designs
have<00:02:04.710> actually<00:02:05.040> kind<00:02:05.280> of<00:02:05.369> overlapped<00:02:05.880> onto

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
have actually kind of overlapped onto

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.220 
have actually kind of overlapped onto
the

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:07.230 
the

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:09.200 
the
spine<00:02:07.410> itself<00:02:07.710> I<00:02:08.190> really<00:02:08.610> enjoy<00:02:08.850> it<00:02:09.030> when

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:09.210 
spine itself I really enjoy it when

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.110 
spine itself I really enjoy it when
books<00:02:09.900> do<00:02:10.200> that<00:02:10.470> but<00:02:10.740> I<00:02:10.770> think<00:02:10.890> the<00:02:11.700> idea<00:02:11.820> that

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
books do that but I think the idea that

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.340 
books do that but I think the idea that
this<00:02:12.330> has<00:02:12.480> actually<00:02:12.570> got<00:02:12.840> a<00:02:12.870> rounded<00:02:13.260> spine

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
this has actually got a rounded spine

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:14.990 
this has actually got a rounded spine
rather<00:02:13.680> than<00:02:13.800> square<00:02:14.100> spying<00:02:14.430> kind<00:02:14.700> of<00:02:14.790> adds

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
rather than square spying kind of adds

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.550 
rather than square spying kind of adds
to<00:02:15.150> that<00:02:15.210> a<00:02:15.300> little<00:02:15.420> bit<00:02:15.660> more<00:02:15.900> so<00:02:16.050> it<00:02:16.170> looks<00:02:16.380> as

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
to that a little bit more so it looks as

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.770 
to that a little bit more so it looks as
though<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:17.220> kind<00:02:17.490> of<00:02:17.550> design<00:02:17.850> is<00:02:18.180> running<00:02:18.570> all

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
though the kind of design is running all

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.600 
though the kind of design is running all
the<00:02:18.990> way<00:02:19.020> around<00:02:19.200> rather<00:02:19.770> than<00:02:19.920> front<00:02:20.280> side

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
the way around rather than front side

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.490 
the way around rather than front side
back<00:02:20.970> I<00:02:21.180> mean<00:02:21.330> I<00:02:21.450> know<00:02:21.510> they<00:02:21.930> do<00:02:21.990> because

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
back I mean I know they do because

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:23.630 
back I mean I know they do because
they're<00:02:22.620> running<00:02:22.890> all<00:02:22.980> the<00:02:23.070> way<00:02:23.130> around<00:02:23.220> like

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
they're running all the way around like

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.940 
they're running all the way around like
that<00:02:23.820> it's<00:02:24.330> kind<00:02:24.450> of<00:02:24.570> adds<00:02:24.840> to<00:02:25.260> the<00:02:25.470> detail<00:02:25.920> of

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
that it's kind of adds to the detail of

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.610 
that it's kind of adds to the detail of
it<00:02:26.220> as<00:02:26.490> well<00:02:26.730> I<00:02:26.760> believe<00:02:27.110> Leviathan<00:02:28.110> by<00:02:28.290> Scott

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
it as well I believe Leviathan by Scott

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.110 
it as well I believe Leviathan by Scott
Westerfeld<00:02:28.650> I'm<00:02:29.280> not<00:02:29.430> quite<00:02:29.580> sure<00:02:29.610> how<00:02:29.760> were

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.120 
Westerfeld I'm not quite sure how were

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.160 
Westerfeld I'm not quite sure how were
you<00:02:30.210> going<00:02:30.300> to<00:02:30.360> say<00:02:30.540> this<00:02:30.720> because<00:02:30.900> of<00:02:31.050> the

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
you going to say this because of the

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.020 
you going to say this because of the
show<00:02:31.290> any<00:02:31.470> text<00:02:31.950> I<00:02:32.130> just<00:02:32.340> have<00:02:32.610> the<00:02:32.700> boldness

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
show any text I just have the boldness

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:34.370 
show any text I just have the boldness
of<00:02:33.090> the<00:02:33.360> text<00:02:33.600> i<00:02:33.690> love<00:02:33.810> the<00:02:33.930> way<00:02:34.020> they<00:02:34.170> actually

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
of the text i love the way they actually

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.740 
of the text i love the way they actually
takes<00:02:34.770> up<00:02:34.950> the<00:02:35.040> whole<00:02:35.070> of<00:02:35.220> the<00:02:35.400> spine<00:02:35.700> and<00:02:35.970> it

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:36.750 
takes up the whole of the spine and it

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.140 
takes up the whole of the spine and it
fits<00:02:37.110> really<00:02:37.440> well<00:02:37.560> with<00:02:38.190> it<00:02:38.220> and<00:02:38.580> i<00:02:38.820> believe

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150 
fits really well with it and i believe

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:41.720 
fits really well with it and i believe
that<00:02:39.570> the<00:02:39.840> kind<00:02:40.110> of<00:02:40.140> silver<00:02:40.680> adds<00:02:41.010> something

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
that the kind of silver adds something

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.270 
that the kind of silver adds something
different<00:02:42.270> to<00:02:42.360> i<00:02:42.390> think<00:02:42.990> that<00:02:43.260> any<00:02:43.560> kind<00:02:44.040> of

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
different to i think that any kind of

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.540 
different to i think that any kind of
silver<00:02:44.760> or<00:02:44.970> gold<00:02:45.440> accent<00:02:46.440> makes<00:02:46.710> the<00:02:47.220> design

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
silver or gold accent makes the design

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.130 
silver or gold accent makes the design
of<00:02:47.730> something<00:02:48.060> stand<00:02:48.270> out<00:02:48.420> i<00:02:48.450> have<00:02:48.660> a<00:02:48.690> lot<00:02:48.960> more

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
of something stand out i have a lot more

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.660 
of something stand out i have a lot more
but<00:02:49.410> i<00:02:49.440> just<00:02:49.680> love<00:02:49.830> the<00:02:49.920> way<00:02:49.950> that<00:02:50.040> the<00:02:50.280> text

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
but i just love the way that the text

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.670 
but i just love the way that the text
takes<00:02:50.880> up<00:02:51.030> the<00:02:51.150> whole<00:02:51.180> of<00:02:51.450> the<00:02:51.540> spine<00:02:51.780> and<00:02:52.170> it

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
takes up the whole of the spine and it

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.350 
takes up the whole of the spine and it
doesn't<00:02:52.980> necessarily<00:02:53.520> need<00:02:53.550> anything<00:02:54.120> of

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360 
doesn't necessarily need anything of

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.730 
doesn't necessarily need anything of
design<00:02:54.690> because<00:02:55.080> the<00:02:55.230> fact<00:02:55.410> that<00:02:55.500> sometimes

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
design because the fact that sometimes

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.040 
design because the fact that sometimes
typography<00:02:56.490> is<00:02:56.700> just<00:02:57.000> all<00:02:57.150> you<00:02:57.270> need<00:02:57.480> and<00:02:57.840> to

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
typography is just all you need and to

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.840 
typography is just all you need and to

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
part the design it doesn't necessarily

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.409 
part the design it doesn't necessarily
need<00:04:18.100> to<00:04:18.280> be<00:04:18.400> something<00:04:18.729> on<00:04:18.970> a<00:04:19.000> completely

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:19.419 
need to be something on a completely

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:20.759 
need to be something on a completely
different<00:04:19.600> spectrum<00:04:20.289> it<00:04:20.380> doesn't<00:04:20.590> need<00:04:20.650> to<00:04:20.709> be

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:20.769 
different spectrum it doesn't need to be

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:22.680 
different spectrum it doesn't need to be
designed<00:04:21.130> and<00:04:21.400> then<00:04:21.549> there's<00:04:21.729> text<00:04:22.060> on<00:04:22.180> top<00:04:22.210> I

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
designed and then there's text on top I

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.600 
designed and then there's text on top I
love<00:04:23.139> it<00:04:23.259> when<00:04:23.440> both<00:04:23.830> of<00:04:23.860> them<00:04:24.009> are<00:04:24.130> combined

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:24.610 
love it when both of them are combined

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.700 
love it when both of them are combined
together<00:04:24.789> I<00:04:25.240> think<00:04:25.780> that<00:04:25.960> that's<00:04:26.080> absolutely

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710 
together I think that that's absolutely

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:28.290 
together I think that that's absolutely
stunning<00:04:27.130> and<00:04:27.250> with<00:04:27.490> regards<00:04:27.820> to<00:04:27.850> the<00:04:27.970> kind<00:04:28.180> of

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
stunning and with regards to the kind of

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:29.760 
stunning and with regards to the kind of
rugged<00:04:28.479> eroded<00:04:28.990> text<00:04:29.289> there's<00:04:29.440> also<00:04:29.560> a

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
rugged eroded text there's also a

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.490 
rugged eroded text there's also a
gradient<00:04:30.580> that<00:04:30.820> does<00:04:31.210> go<00:04:31.570> with<00:04:31.870> the<00:04:32.110> eroded

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
gradient that does go with the eroded

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.290 
gradient that does go with the eroded
text<00:04:32.889> feel<00:04:33.130> as<00:04:33.370> well<00:04:33.610> in<00:04:33.820> the<00:04:33.910> way<00:04:34.000> that<00:04:34.120> it's

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
text feel as well in the way that it's

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.960
