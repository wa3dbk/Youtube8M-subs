00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:21.029 
question November 30th 1950 I think
that's<00:01:19.600> part<00:01:19.990> of<00:01:20.110> it<00:01:20.259> because<00:01:20.560> some<00:01:20.860> of<00:01:20.890> them

00:01:21.029 --> 00:01:21.039 
that's part of it because some of them

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:22.980 
that's part of it because some of them
have<00:01:21.220> their<00:01:21.369> moms<00:01:21.610> there<00:01:22.060> in<00:01:22.420> the<00:01:22.539> grandmas

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
again you're older than they are and I

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.580
