00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
interesting he hasn't flown gliders that

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.650 
interesting he hasn't flown gliders that
much<00:00:29.220> and<00:00:29.550> I<00:00:29.880> just<00:00:30.150> stopped<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.510> whole

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
much and I just stopped the whole

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.359 
much and I just stopped the whole
process<00:00:30.930> because<00:00:31.350> I<00:00:31.800> want<00:00:32.009> to<00:00:32.070> make<00:00:32.160> sure<00:00:32.189> to

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
process because I want to make sure to

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:40.729 
process because I want to make sure to
get<00:00:32.460> pictures<00:00:32.790> of<00:00:32.910> it<00:00:33.000> before<00:00:33.059> he<00:00:33.329> launches<00:00:39.739> so

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
get pictures of it before he launches so

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.970 
get pictures of it before he launches so
alright<00:00:41.399> so<00:00:41.609> we're<00:00:41.730> out<00:00:41.879> I<00:00:42.649> think<00:00:43.649> this<00:00:43.800> thing

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
alright so we're out I think this thing

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.819 
alright so we're out I think this thing
is<00:00:44.070> called<00:00:44.219> a<00:00:44.339> zdk<00:00:44.820> it's<00:00:45.149> a<00:00:45.239> glider<00:00:45.449> I<00:00:45.870> don't

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
is called a zdk it's a glider I don't

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.759 
is called a zdk it's a glider I don't
know<00:00:46.920> much<00:00:47.190> about<00:00:47.219> gliders<00:00:47.909> and<00:00:48.149> I<00:00:49.050> have<00:00:49.620> only

00:00:49.759 --> 00:00:49.769 
know much about gliders and I have only

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:52.610 
know much about gliders and I have only
flown<00:00:50.239> maybe<00:00:51.239> two<00:00:51.480> other<00:00:51.659> ones<00:00:51.929> Matt<00:00:52.170> had<00:00:52.379> one

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
flown maybe two other ones Matt had one

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.610 
flown maybe two other ones Matt had one
so<00:00:53.550> we<00:00:53.609> got<00:00:53.730> this<00:00:53.850> in<00:00:53.999> on<00:00:54.089> a<00:00:54.179> trade<00:00:54.449> and<00:00:54.659> built

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
so we got this in on a trade and built

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.799 
so we got this in on a trade and built
it<00:00:55.769> up<00:00:55.859> through<00:00:56.550> some<00:00:56.760> gear<00:00:56.969> on<00:00:57.089> it<00:00:57.269> we're<00:00:57.780> just

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
it up through some gear on it we're just

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.569 
it up through some gear on it we're just
kind<00:00:58.019> of<00:00:58.079> fun<00:00:58.229> today<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:58.679> by<00:00:59.039> finally<00:00:59.399> me<00:00:59.489> and

00:01:07.959 --> 00:01:07.969 

00:01:07.969 --> 00:02:36.990 

not<00:01:08.969> gonna<00:01:09.210> know<00:01:09.359> long

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
don't really know much about gliders

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:44.349 
don't really know much about gliders
that's<00:02:43.099> why<00:02:43.250> we're<00:02:43.430> doing<00:02:43.519> this<00:02:43.730> here<00:02:43.909> today

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:44.359 
that's why we're doing this here today

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:46.479 
that's why we're doing this here today

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:49.069 
had put on I forgot to connect her to

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:51.729 
had put on I forgot to connect her to
put<00:02:49.280> the<00:02:49.310> fpv<00:02:49.730> gear<00:02:49.939> on<00:02:50.090> but<00:02:50.470> i'm<00:02:51.470> excited

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
put the fpv gear on but i'm excited

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:52.869 
put the fpv gear on but i'm excited
about<00:02:51.980> getting<00:02:52.220> it<00:02:52.310> in<00:02:52.400> the<00:02:52.489> air<00:02:52.609> and<00:02:52.790> just

00:02:52.869 --> 00:02:52.879 
about getting it in the air and just

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:54.490 
about getting it in the air and just
kind<00:02:53.060> of<00:02:53.090> poking<00:02:53.299> around<00:02:53.480> because<00:02:53.840> all<00:02:54.439> I

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
kind of poking around because all I

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.289 
kind of poking around because all I
needed<00:02:54.769> about<00:02:54.950> was<00:02:55.220> quarter<00:02:55.579> throttle<00:02:56.150> and

00:02:56.289 --> 00:02:56.299 
needed about was quarter throttle and

00:02:56.299 --> 00:02:58.720 
needed about was quarter throttle and
she<00:02:56.959> was<00:02:57.170> she<00:02:57.409> was<00:02:57.530> doing<00:02:57.739> fine<00:02:57.950> kinda<00:02:58.609> looks

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
she was she was doing fine kinda looks

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.119 
she was she was doing fine kinda looks
like<00:02:58.790> Adolf<00:02:59.120> Hitler<00:02:59.389> but<00:02:59.599> I<00:03:00.040> don't<00:03:01.040> really

00:03:01.119 --> 00:03:01.129 
like Adolf Hitler but I don't really

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:03.339 
like Adolf Hitler but I don't really
think<00:03:01.250> you<00:03:01.400> were<00:03:01.489> going<00:03:01.609> for<00:03:01.730> that<00:03:01.909> is<00:03:02.900> this<00:03:03.319> a

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:03.349 
think you were going for that is this a

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:06.520 
think you were going for that is this a
German<00:03:03.799> aircraft<00:03:04.510> polish<00:03:05.510> a<00:03:05.540> thing<00:03:05.840> polish

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
German aircraft polish a thing polish

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:53.970 
German aircraft polish a thing polish
oh<00:03:06.560> boy<00:03:07.159> that<00:03:07.340> doesn't<00:03:07.549> mix

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.050 

all<00:03:54.980> right<00:03:55.069> so<00:03:55.159> we<00:03:55.250> got<00:03:55.370> a<00:03:55.400> four<00:03:55.610> thousand

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
all right so we got a four thousand

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.899 
all right so we got a four thousand
milliamp<00:03:56.360> 3s<00:03:57.019> pack<00:03:57.290> in<00:03:57.530> here<00:03:57.830> we're<00:03:58.670> running

00:03:58.899 --> 00:03:58.909 
milliamp 3s pack in here we're running

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:00.460 
milliamp 3s pack in here we're running
the<00:03:58.970> same<00:03:59.150> motor<00:03:59.390> combo<00:03:59.810> that<00:03:59.989> we<00:04:00.080> put<00:04:00.290> in<00:04:00.379> the

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:00.470 
the same motor combo that we put in the

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:03.930 
the same motor combo that we put in the
specter<00:04:00.950> and<00:04:01.700> 1/8<00:04:02.030> for<00:04:02.360> carbon<00:04:02.780> prop<00:04:03.019> so<00:04:03.410> I

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:03.940 
specter and 1/8 for carbon prop so I

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.580 
specter and 1/8 for carbon prop so I
think<00:04:04.940> maybe<00:04:05.390> we<00:04:05.840> could<00:04:05.959> go<00:04:06.140> a<00:04:06.170> little<00:04:06.410> bit

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:06.590 
think maybe we could go a little bit

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:10.690 
think maybe we could go a little bit
bigger<00:04:06.739> on<00:04:06.799> the<00:04:06.980> prop<00:04:07.190> area<00:04:07.519> I<00:04:09.640> think<00:04:10.640> the

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
bigger on the prop area I think the

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.309 
bigger on the prop area I think the
battery<00:04:11.000> size<00:04:11.299> is<00:04:11.599> probably<00:04:11.870> plenty<00:04:12.110> enough

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:12.319 
battery size is probably plenty enough

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:13.660 
battery size is probably plenty enough
for<00:04:12.620> what<00:04:12.739> we're<00:04:12.860> going<00:04:12.980> to<00:04:13.010> do<00:04:13.159> with<00:04:13.340> this<00:04:13.489> for

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:13.670 
for what we're going to do with this for

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.840 
for what we're going to do with this for
fpv<00:04:14.120> in<00:04:14.269> a<00:04:14.569> little<00:04:15.019> simple<00:04:15.349> sore<00:04:15.560> it<00:04:16.549> doesn't
