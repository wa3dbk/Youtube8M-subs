it's<00:00:29.670> going<00:00:29.849> to<00:00:29.939> be<00:00:30.000> a<00:00:30.029> different<00:00:30.359> phone

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
it's going to be a different phone

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:31.939 
it's going to be a different phone
they're<00:00:30.750> going<00:00:30.929> to<00:00:30.990> be<00:00:31.050> some<00:00:31.199> upgraded

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
they're going to be some upgraded

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.910 
they're going to be some upgraded
components<00:00:32.430> to<00:00:32.610> it<00:00:32.730> so<00:00:33.110> sure<00:00:34.110> sure<00:00:34.590> I<00:00:34.770> mean

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
components to it so sure sure I mean

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.729 
components to it so sure sure I mean
that<00:00:35.070> so<00:00:35.610> as<00:00:35.940> you<00:00:36.450> hold<00:00:36.809> them<00:00:36.930> both<00:00:37.110> you'll

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
that so as you hold them both you'll

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:38.869 
that so as you hold them both you'll
notice<00:00:38.010> they<00:00:38.129> both<00:00:38.309> have<00:00:38.460> about<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.850> same

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
notice they both have about the same

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.020 
notice they both have about the same
with<00:00:39.210> right<00:00:39.480> there<00:00:39.930> bought<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.230> same<00:00:40.350> length

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:41.030 
with right there bought the same length

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.150 
with right there bought the same length
the<00:00:42.030> s4<00:00:42.390> is<00:00:42.450> a<00:00:42.510> little<00:00:42.690> thinner<00:00:42.960> and<00:00:43.260> a<00:00:43.920> little

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
the s4 is a little thinner and a little

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.430 
the s4 is a little thinner and a little
bit<00:00:44.280> lighter<00:00:44.520> and<00:00:45.300> you'll<00:00:46.079> feel<00:00:46.260> the

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
bit lighter and you'll feel the

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.080 
bit lighter and you'll feel the
constructions<00:00:47.160> a<00:00:47.250> little<00:00:47.460> bit<00:00:47.550> more<00:00:47.700> solid

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
constructions a little bit more solid

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.850 
constructions a little bit more solid
construction<00:00:48.329> they're<00:00:49.020> both<00:00:49.140> great<00:00:49.379> devices

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
construction they're both great devices

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.150 
construction they're both great devices
the<00:00:50.730> nice<00:00:50.879> thing<00:00:50.910> about<00:00:51.149> s4<00:00:51.780> is<00:00:52.649> this<00:00:52.890> just

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
the nice thing about s4 is this just

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.860 
the nice thing about s4 is this just
kind<00:00:53.309> of<00:00:53.430> takes<00:00:53.789> it<00:00:53.940> up<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.210> notch<00:00:54.420> from<00:00:54.719> an

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
kind of takes it up a notch from an

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.450 
kind of takes it up a notch from an
already<00:00:55.289> really<00:00:55.710> great<00:00:55.890> device<00:00:56.190> in<00:00:56.370> the

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
already really great device in the

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.930 
already really great device in the
galaxy<00:00:56.820> s3<00:00:57.320> so<00:00:58.320> you're<00:00:58.680> looking<00:00:58.980> at<00:00:59.129> 1080p

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
galaxy s3 so you're looking at 1080p

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.270 
galaxy s3 so you're looking at 1080p
screen<00:01:00.510> versus<00:01:00.870> 720<00:01:01.469> so<00:01:01.710> of<00:01:01.829> course<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.219> S

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
screen versus 720 so of course the S

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.590 
screen versus 720 so of course the S
course<00:01:02.660> 1080p<00:01:04.430> 8-megapixel<00:01:05.430> camera<00:01:05.850> versus

00:01:10.179 --> 00:01:10.189 
the new 13 megapixel camera on the s4

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:15.649 
the new 13 megapixel camera on the s4
bigger<00:01:11.189> battery<00:01:12.830> you<00:01:13.830> know<00:01:13.950> at<00:01:14.220> LTE<00:01:14.970> speeds<00:01:15.479> we

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
bigger battery you know at LTE speeds we

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.240 
bigger battery you know at LTE speeds we
talked<00:01:15.869> about<00:01:15.960> LT<00:01:16.290> a<00:01:16.320> little<00:01:16.590> bit<00:01:16.680> ly<00:01:16.770> unboxing

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
talked about LT a little bit ly unboxing

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.850 
talked about LT a little bit ly unboxing
right<00:01:17.369> so<00:01:17.549> LTE<00:01:17.850> speed<00:01:18.210> versus<00:01:18.630> our<00:01:18.810> 4G<00:01:19.710> speeds

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
right so LTE speed versus our 4G speeds

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.899 
right so LTE speed versus our 4G speeds
which<00:01:20.159> are<00:01:20.310> still<00:01:20.460> great<00:01:20.670> on<00:01:21.180> galaxy<00:01:21.930> s3<00:01:22.909> you

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
which are still great on galaxy s3 you

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.679 
which are still great on galaxy s3 you
know<00:01:24.030> I<00:01:24.509> think<00:01:25.409> my<00:01:25.770> I<00:01:26.100> definitely<00:01:26.790> see<00:01:27.060> smaller

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
know I think my I definitely see smaller

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:28.850 
know I think my I definitely see smaller
differences<00:01:28.080> but<00:01:28.409> I<00:01:28.470> don't<00:01:28.650> think<00:01:28.740> the

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
differences but I don't think the

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.350 
differences but I don't think the
average<00:01:28.950> user<00:01:29.250> is<00:01:29.400> going<00:01:29.610> to<00:01:29.700> necessarily<00:01:29.820> see

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
average user is going to necessarily see

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.200 
average user is going to necessarily see
him<00:01:30.450> say<00:01:30.750> for<00:01:31.229> example<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.890> button<00:01:32.369> is<00:01:32.820> in<00:01:33.119> a

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
him say for example the button is in a

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.780 
him say for example the button is in a
slightly<00:01:33.479> different<00:01:33.570> position<00:01:33.930> on<00:01:34.799> me<00:01:35.400> is

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
slightly different position on me is

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.210 
slightly different position on me is
sure<00:01:36.420> it's<00:01:36.659> so<00:01:36.900> much<00:01:37.079> I<00:01:37.530> know<00:01:37.619> and<00:01:37.860> well<00:01:37.950> even

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
sure it's so much I know and well even

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.130 
sure it's so much I know and well even
but<00:01:38.460> even<00:01:38.729> looking<00:01:39.060> at<00:01:39.150> a<00:01:39.180> side<00:01:39.540> profile<00:01:39.960> it

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
but even looking at a side profile it

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.660 
but even looking at a side profile it
seems<00:01:40.380> that<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.890> plastic<00:01:41.250> back<00:01:41.400> on<00:01:41.579> the

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
seems that the the plastic back on the

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.940 
seems that the the plastic back on the
s3<00:01:41.790> is<00:01:42.000> a<00:01:42.090> bit<00:01:42.270> more<00:01:42.420> tapered<00:01:42.659> has<00:01:43.470> a<00:01:43.500> curve<00:01:43.920> to

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
s3 is a bit more tapered has a curve to

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.530 
s3 is a bit more tapered has a curve to
it<00:01:44.250> a<00:01:44.369> little<00:01:44.610> bit<00:01:44.759> more<00:01:44.909> of<00:01:44.970> a<00:01:45.030> curve<00:01:45.210> right

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
it a little bit more of a curve right

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.420 
it a little bit more of a curve right
compared<00:01:46.290> to<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:46.470> s4<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.100> volume<00:01:47.369> rocker

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
switch on the s3 is also seems to be

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.399 
switch on the s3 is also seems to be
about<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.180> same<00:01:51.299> length<00:01:51.570> no<00:01:51.990> a<00:01:52.020> little

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
about the same length no a little

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.789 
about the same length no a little
shorter<00:01:52.799> and<00:01:53.009> also<00:01:53.700> further<00:01:54.210> down<00:01:54.799> details

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
shorter and also further down details

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.420 
shorter and also further down details
that<00:01:55.950> only<00:01:56.070> I<00:01:56.490> would<00:01:56.820> ever<00:01:57.149> see<00:01:58.100> and<00:01:59.100> then<00:01:59.340> on

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
that only I would ever see and then on

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.459 
that only I would ever see and then on
the<00:01:59.520> back<00:01:59.670> I<00:01:59.909> see<00:02:00.060> there's<00:02:00.240> this<00:02:00.450> a<00:02:00.509> grill<00:02:01.439> that

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
the back I see there's this a grill that

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.770 
the back I see there's this a grill that
a<00:02:01.770> speaker<00:02:02.189> then<00:02:02.340> it's<00:02:02.490> just<00:02:02.579> as<00:02:03.030> a<00:02:03.299> whole<00:02:03.600> for

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
a speaker then it's just as a whole for

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.179 
a speaker then it's just as a whole for
the<00:02:03.840> speaker<00:02:04.110> came<00:02:04.350> back<00:02:04.530> on<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.649> back<00:02:04.770> and

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
the speaker came back on the back and

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:06.830 
the speaker came back on the back and
you'll<00:02:05.759> notice<00:02:05.880> it's<00:02:06.090> got<00:02:06.180> a<00:02:06.240> little<00:02:06.390> bump<00:02:06.630> so

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
you'll notice it's got a little bump so

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.660 
you'll notice it's got a little bump so
that<00:02:06.960> even<00:02:07.140> if<00:02:07.200> you<00:02:07.320> lay<00:02:07.469> the<00:02:07.649> phone<00:02:07.860> flat<00:02:08.310> on<00:02:08.610> a

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
that even if you lay the phone flat on a

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.339 
that even if you lay the phone flat on a
table<00:02:08.910> you'd<00:02:09.660> actually<00:02:09.810> have<00:02:10.020> a<00:02:10.140> little

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
table you'd actually have a little

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:11.510 
table you'd actually have a little
boarding<00:02:10.709> so<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.069> game

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520

on<00:02:24.870> the<00:02:24.960> defense<00:02:25.320> pretty<00:02:25.980> smart<00:02:26.190> engineering

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
on the defense pretty smart engineering

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.420 
on the defense pretty smart engineering
I'd<00:02:26.820> say<00:02:27.000> so<00:02:27.300> you'll<00:02:27.420> see<00:02:27.600> up<00:02:27.840> on<00:02:27.960> the<00:02:28.110> top<00:02:28.430> 3.5

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
I'd say so you'll see up on the top 3.5

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:30.860 
I'd say so you'll see up on the top 3.5
millimeter<00:02:29.670> jack<00:02:29.910> and<00:02:30.600> you'll<00:02:30.750> notice

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
millimeter jack and you'll notice

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.780 
millimeter jack and you'll notice
another<00:02:31.200> small<00:02:31.620> little<00:02:31.830> dots<00:02:32.130> up<00:02:32.370> there<00:02:32.580> and

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
another small little dots up there and

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.810 
another small little dots up there and
that<00:02:32.850> is<00:02:33.330> a<00:02:33.620> integrated<00:02:34.620> infrared<00:02:35.610> remote

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
that is a integrated infrared remote

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.300 
that is a integrated infrared remote
control<00:02:36.270> okay<00:02:36.660> so<00:02:37.620> we'll<00:02:37.800> be<00:02:37.920> playing<00:02:38.130> with

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
control okay so we'll be playing with

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.650 
control okay so we'll be playing with
the<00:02:38.520> team<00:02:38.820> you<00:02:38.940> behind<00:02:39.240> us<00:02:39.300> here<00:02:39.450> in<00:02:39.540> a<00:02:39.570> couple

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
the team you behind us here in a couple

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.630 
the team you behind us here in a couple
minutes<00:02:39.840> to<00:02:40.110> show<00:02:40.320> that<00:02:40.470> off<00:02:40.650> oh<00:02:40.770> cool<00:02:41.160> that'll

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
minutes to show that off oh cool that'll

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.160 
minutes to show that off oh cool that'll
be<00:02:41.760> as<00:02:41.940> a<00:02:41.970> part<00:02:42.210> of<00:02:42.270> my<00:02:42.360> initial<00:02:42.720> impressions

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
be as a part of my initial impressions

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.040 
be as a part of my initial impressions
video<00:02:43.320> so<00:02:44.040> a<00:02:44.580> faster<00:02:45.240> processor<00:02:45.750> faster

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
video so a faster processor faster

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.020 
video so a faster processor faster
processor<00:02:46.710> bigger<00:02:46.920> battery<00:02:47.310> better<00:02:47.580> camera

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
processor bigger battery better camera

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.000 
processor bigger battery better camera
better<00:02:48.510> camera<00:02:48.900> and<00:02:49.050> the<00:02:49.110> you<00:02:49.170> know<00:02:49.230> the<00:02:49.350> cool

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
better camera and the you know the cool

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:51.200 
better camera and the you know the cool
thing<00:02:50.130> about<00:02:50.190> the<00:02:50.400> camera<00:02:50.730> for<00:02:50.880> instance

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:51.210 
thing about the camera for instance

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:52.730 
thing about the camera for instance
though<00:02:51.420> is<00:02:51.660> Samsung<00:02:52.050> makes<00:02:52.200> the<00:02:52.350> galaxy

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:52.740 
though is Samsung makes the galaxy

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.950 
though is Samsung makes the galaxy
camera<00:02:52.950> right<00:02:53.280> and<00:02:53.460> so<00:02:53.880> with<00:02:54.090> gs3<00:02:54.630> you<00:02:54.780> had<00:02:54.930> a

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960 
camera right and so with gs3 you had a

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.500 
camera right and so with gs3 you had a
really<00:02:55.230> good<00:02:55.440> camera<00:02:55.950> phone<00:02:56.670> in<00:02:57.000> this

particular case they've essentially

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:01.310 
particular case they've essentially
taken<00:02:59.940> that<00:03:00.060> interface<00:03:00.510> from<00:03:00.690> galaxy<00:03:01.110> camera

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:01.320 
taken that interface from galaxy camera

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:03.080 
taken that interface from galaxy camera
and<00:03:01.500> those<00:03:01.590> great<00:03:01.800> features<00:03:02.220> and<00:03:02.490> put<00:03:03.000> it

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:28.830 
much that you'd have to evolve it yeah I

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.350 
much that you'd have to evolve it yeah I
think<00:04:28.919> they<00:04:29.190> were<00:04:29.250> they<00:04:29.639> refined<00:04:30.060> it<00:04:30.240> they

imported some great features remember

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:35.629 
imported some great features remember
when<00:04:34.410> we<00:04:34.500> did<00:04:34.620> galaxy<00:04:35.070> note<00:04:35.250> we<00:04:35.340> were<00:04:35.400> talking

a little larger but I nails are pretty

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.780 
a little larger but I nails are pretty
close<00:04:46.080> yeah<00:04:46.440> it's<00:04:46.680> a<00:04:46.710> fantastic<00:04:47.370> software

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:50.870 
feature and again I think that's
probably<00:04:49.650> beyond<00:04:50.130> the<00:04:50.250> hardware<00:04:50.639> one<00:04:50.790> of

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:50.880 
probably beyond the hardware one of

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.690 
probably beyond the hardware one of
Samsung's<00:04:51.330> biggest<00:04:52.050> drinks<00:04:52.500> is<00:04:52.740> bolstering
