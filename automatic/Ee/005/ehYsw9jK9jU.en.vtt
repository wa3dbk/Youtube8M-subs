00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
fixed but I don't know why there's an

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.890 
fixed but I don't know why there's an
update<00:00:27.029> to<00:00:27.150> the<00:00:27.300> new<00:00:27.990> version<00:00:28.760> but<00:00:29.760> yet<00:00:30.570> my

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
update to the new version but yet my

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.930 
update to the new version but yet my
friend<00:00:31.199> has<00:00:31.349> something<00:00:31.769> to<00:00:31.800> do<00:00:32.099> with<00:00:32.250> that<00:00:32.309> so

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
friend has something to do with that so

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.990 
friend has something to do with that so
I'll<00:00:33.300> just<00:00:33.540> leave<00:00:33.870> it<00:00:33.989> at<00:00:34.170> that<00:00:34.200> and<00:00:34.790> if<00:00:35.790> you

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
I'll just leave it at that and if you

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.020 
I'll just leave it at that and if you
have<00:00:36.149> any<00:00:36.300> apps<00:00:36.630> crashing<00:00:37.530> or<00:00:37.920> like<00:00:38.460> and<00:00:41.030> it's

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
have any apps crashing or like and it's

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.260 
have any apps crashing or like and it's
really<00:00:42.840> slow<00:00:43.170> the<00:00:43.559> battery<00:00:43.980> drains<00:00:44.370> out<00:00:44.789> fast

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
really slow the battery drains out fast

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.220 
really slow the battery drains out fast
and<00:00:46.700> then<00:00:47.700> you<00:00:47.940> might<00:00:48.149> want<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.480> think<00:00:49.020> of

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
and then you might want to think of

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:49.729 
and then you might want to think of
doing<00:00:49.350> that

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
doing that

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.450 
doing that
so<00:00:50.480> if<00:00:51.480> you<00:00:51.629> downloaded<00:00:52.260> any<00:00:52.410> new<00:00:52.739> apps<00:00:52.980> that

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
so if you downloaded any new apps that

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.049 
so if you downloaded any new apps that
would<00:00:53.879> be<00:00:54.090> fine<00:00:54.390> so<00:00:55.199> like<00:00:55.860> if<00:00:56.190> it's<00:00:56.489> really

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
would be fine so like if it's really

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.950 
would be fine so like if it's really
laggy<00:00:57.390> which<00:00:58.350> mine<00:00:58.649> isn't<00:00:59.010> you<00:00:59.969> want<00:01:00.180> to<00:01:00.300> put

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
laggy which mine isn't you want to put

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.179 
laggy which mine isn't you want to put
it<00:01:01.079> to<00:01:01.230> safe<00:01:01.500> mode<00:01:01.530> so<00:01:03.110> just<00:01:04.110> press<00:01:04.379> this<00:01:04.769> home

disable all of them and then are you're

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.500 
disable all of them and then are you're
going<00:02:31.370> to<00:02:31.430> like<00:02:31.700> if<00:02:32.090> that<00:02:32.540> lag<00:02:32.900> still<00:02:33.560> exists

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:34.510 
going to like if that lag still exists

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.550 
going to like if that lag still exists
which<00:02:35.680> so<00:02:36.680> if<00:02:37.310> the<00:02:37.760> lags<00:02:38.000> exists<00:02:38.720> then<00:02:39.350> you

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
which so if the lags exists then you

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
which so if the lags exists then you
know<00:02:39.770> that<00:02:40.190> like<00:02:40.550> it's<00:02:40.850> caused<00:02:41.300> by<00:02:41.510> these

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
know that like it's caused by these

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.130 
know that like it's caused by these
third-party<00:02:43.580> apps<00:02:43.820> so<00:02:44.270> you<00:02:44.300> want<00:02:44.690> to<00:02:44.810> figure

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
third-party apps so you want to figure
