00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:13.250
Greetings, and welcome to Earthling
Cinema. I am your host, Garyx Wormuloid. This

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:18.330
week’s artifact is The Empire Strikes Back,
the fifth film in the Disney franchise Star

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.270
Wars, and the most critically acclaimed until
Episode 12: Rise of Darth Goofy.

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:28.270
The film is a sequel, which means means all
your favorite characters are back: Vader,

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.279
Leia, TARS, this guy. Even Luke couldn’t
stay away!

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.690
When Empire begins, the gang is hiding at
a ski resort called Hoth. Vader is pissed

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.800
that they're hogging all the slopes,
so he attacks them with giant robot turtles.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.120
Foregoing a concentrated attack from behind,
the rebels fly around erratically, then make

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.010
a trip-wire out of the strongest rope in the
universe.

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.000
Han and Leia escape with their sidekicks and
hide inside a snake. Luke escapes to planet

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.500
Dagobah with his sidekick and meets Yoda,
who inexplicably acts like a crazy

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:05.570
person just to trick Luke for five minutes.
Luke begins his Jedi training, which consists

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.990
of wearing a backpack while doing some light
exercise.

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:14.400
Meanwhile, Han and Leia go to the lazily-named
Cloud City to get ambushed by Vader, who freezes

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.560
Han in carbonite just to show he can afford
it.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:23.360
Fun fact: actor Harrison Ford ad-libbed the
line “I know” instead of using the written

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.370
line “I know you are but what am I?”
Leia and the sidekicks escape with some help

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:33.480
from the mayor, but not before Luke falls
for Vader’s bait like a total Yajj noobula.

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:38.080
Vader disarms Luke and tries to have a heart
to heart with him, but Luke bails. Classic

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.030
teenager, embarrassed to be seen with his
dad.

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.110
The Empire Strikes Back is visually distinct
from its predecessor, and not just because

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:50.190
of the decisive lack of sidebuns. Whereas
before it was mostly sand and starships, here

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.950
it is predominantly snow, swamp, and clouds,
with some lizard bowels thrown in for good

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.580
measure.
Still, the film touches on a few of the same

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:03.730
themes, such as humanism and nature over technology.
Yoda, like Obi-Wan in Episode IV, lives a

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:08.349
simple life on the bayou — the Jedi master
way, but not something traditionally associated

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:13.930
with power. When Darth Vader is in his power
pod, we catch a brief glimpse of his milky

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.590
white head, revealing that he does have some
humanity left in him, and probably takes his

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.879
helmet off for naps and showers. Later, when
Luke misplaces his hand, he puts on a cybernetic

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:28.799
prosthesis, symbolically moving him one step
closer to his father, a hybrid of man and

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:33.859
machine. He’s still got that squeaky voice
though. Must’ve gotten that from his mother’s

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.240
side.
The Dark Side of the Force

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.519
becomes a central conflict for Luke. Swiss psychiatrist
Carl Jung believed in something called “the

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:45.510
shadow,” the unknown dark part of human
personality. Inside Yoda’s cave practice

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.989
facility, Luke confronts an illusion of Darth
Vader and defeats him by slicing his neck

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:51.069
with the light-thingy.

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:54.499
But behind Vader’s mask, Luke sees
his own face. As Jung say

00:02:54.969 --> 00:02:58.170
"Everyone carries a shadow,
and the less it is embodied in the individual's

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:03.639
conscious life, the blacker and denser it
is.” Black and dense like... Vader’s helmet?

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:09.340
Ooh, I’m getting goosebumps! Which, of course,
means it’s nearly time for me to molt.

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.760
You might say that the Dark Side threatens
to turn Luke’s world upside down. And indeed,

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.439
Luke does spend much of the movie inverted
like some sort of bat-boy. This can be related

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:24.379
to the idea of the Hanged Man as seen in Tarot
symbolism. Remember Miss Cleo? Yeah, me neither.

00:03:24.379 --> 00:03:28.849
Luke is upside down three times in the movie:
in the wampa cave, training with Yoda, and

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:35.359
trying to fix a TV antenna, and in each instance
Luke uses the force. This is in line with

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:39.499
the description of the hanged man as being
in deep concentration -- complete calm and

00:03:39.499 --> 00:03:41.309
assurance -- rather than pain.

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:45.099
Another element that separates this film from
the previous one is the addition of Yoda,

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:49.849
a very popular character among humans and
frogs alike. Yoda’s name means “warrior”

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:54.950
in Sanskrit, and “badass” in every other
language. The make-up artist Stuart Freeborn

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:59.999
based Yoda partly on his own face and partly
on the face of celebrated patent clerk Albert

00:03:59.999 --> 00:04:00.779
Einstein.

00:04:00.779 --> 00:04:04.650
In addition to being a handsome
devil, Yoda ascribes to the principles of

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:09.340
stoicism, an ancient Greek philosophy whose
faithful believed emotions like fear, envy,

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.920
lust, or passion arose from false judgments.

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.040
"Excitement, a jedi craves not these things."

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.200
The sage -- a person who had attained moral

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:23.420
and intellectual perfection -- would not succumb
to such trivial pursuits, despite a love for

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.270
knowledge-based board games.
Empire’s most lasting impact is the line

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:34.260
“I am your father”. Often misquoted as
“Luke, I am your father,”

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:43.840
this phrase was inescapable on Earth, especially at adoption agencies. Vader’s reveal was one of the

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:48.280
original twist endings in Earth’s cinematic
history, and therefore a source of the very

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:53.420
first spoilers. In fact, historians believe
they can trace the phrase “spoiler alert”

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:59.150
to a ticket line outside a screening of Episode
V in Pensacola, Florida. This alert lead Earth

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:04.700
down a dangerous path, eventually culminating
in a spoiler culture that left humans paralyzed

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:09.270
with fear of checking the internet unless
completely caught up with Game of Thrones.

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.260
Fortunately, this all stopped when their planet
exploded.

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:19.260
For Earthling Cinema, I’m Garyx Wormuloid.
