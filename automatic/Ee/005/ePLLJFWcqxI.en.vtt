 dreamed of life great you are 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.309
 really good until the time 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:47.489
 when her step-sister comes to the house 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:50.010
 reset is a beautiful picture 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:53.280
 Looked for and she is still there 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.899
 ehlich goes lisette is unfortunately 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.570
 Not so well treated by life 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.609
 her mother was very poor her 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.680
 father in which she says he 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:03.870
 has found shelter 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:05.430
 Mother just left with her mother 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.320
 by emma to live together 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.939
 they were financially quite whole 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.530
 bad and her mother is actually 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.409
 also died because they die 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.330
 health insurance could not pay 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:17.580
 yes and now this girl comes in 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:19.130
 this household and bring the household 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.890
 a little bit confused 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:26.970
 if lisette really is so super nice 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:28.860
 and so nice or if emma is the bad guy 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.860
 you have to find out for yourself 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:35.240
 it's a whole new one 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.220
 interpretation of this fairy tale 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.530
 yes it has me very often too 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.060
 to think it is one 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.939
 history full of intrigues 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.979
 I really enjoyed that 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:47.659
 But in everything you get a whole 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:49.009
 different perspective on the story 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:50.810
 Maybe it could not be too 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:52.990
 to have been so much as in the 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.399
 classic cinderella fairy tale 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:58.189
 it is based on the story at the very 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:00.770
 The beginning tells of chamberlains as they do 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:03.289
 This witch has become her now 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.630
 is and ketterer even has to go here once 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:07.039
 in this book in july the good fairy 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.970
 hat what you do not think so 

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:10.610
 liked it 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.959
 the only thing that's not so good about the book 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.060
 it was only two 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:15.920
 small things and that is the 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.380
 history of emma and lisette twice 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.810
 interrupted home for the story 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.720
 a French king and once 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.730
 it's about the titanic has a lot to do with it 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:29.360
 kendra to do but it has me 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:31.100
 a bit disturbed in the flow of reading yes for whom 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.099
 the book is suitable for everyone 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:36.970
 The fairy tales love and the years one 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:40.160
 fun maybe too intriguing 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:43.299
 maybe not quite like that either 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:46.160
 have happy sibling relationship 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:48.410
 I really liked it really well 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:51.250
 and I hope you enjoy it 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.250
