00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
plan so yeah I thought it just I don't

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.150 
plan so yeah I thought it just I don't
know<00:00:26.730> why<00:00:26.849> but<00:00:27.150> my<00:00:27.210> hair<00:00:28.109> videos<00:00:28.560> are<00:00:28.830> the<00:00:29.010> most

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
know why but my hair videos are the most

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.450 
know why but my hair videos are the most
popular<00:00:29.340> ones<00:00:29.580> on<00:00:30.449> my<00:00:30.660> channel<00:00:30.990> so<00:00:31.349> I<00:00:31.710> guess<00:00:32.279> I

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
popular ones on my channel so I guess I

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:33.920 
popular ones on my channel so I guess I
thought<00:00:32.910> that<00:00:33.090> you<00:00:33.210> might<00:00:33.420> want<00:00:33.630> to<00:00:33.660> see<00:00:33.780> what

thought that you might want to see what

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.900 
thought that you might want to see what
it<00:00:34.020> looks<00:00:34.170> like<00:00:34.200> when<00:00:34.410> I<00:00:34.440> take<00:00:35.160> these
