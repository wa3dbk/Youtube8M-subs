okay for the next stage we're going to
make<00:00:02.700> some<00:00:02.879> modifications<00:00:03.629> to<00:00:03.780> our<00:00:04.140> game

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:04.650 
make some modifications to our game

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.769 
make some modifications to our game
engine<00:00:04.680> project<00:00:05.279> first<00:00:05.790> of<00:00:05.940> all<00:00:06.120> what<00:00:06.690> we're

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
engine project first of all what we're

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:07.940 
engine project first of all what we're
going<00:00:06.899> to<00:00:06.930> do<00:00:07.049> is<00:00:07.170> right<00:00:07.379> click<00:00:07.410> on<00:00:07.740> game

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950 
going to do is right click on game

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.560 
going to do is right click on game
engine<00:00:08.370> and<00:00:10.340> so<00:00:11.340> let's<00:00:11.730> keep<00:00:11.910> on<00:00:12.120> going

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
engine and so let's keep on going

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.180 
engine and so let's keep on going
then<00:00:13.080> we're<00:00:13.290> going<00:00:13.410> to<00:00:13.440> do<00:00:13.559> is<00:00:13.679> add<00:00:13.889> a

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
then we're going to do is add a

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:15.440 
then we're going to do is add a
reference<00:00:14.370> this<00:00:14.880> time<00:00:15.089> going<00:00:15.210> to<00:00:15.269> add<00:00:15.420> a

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
reference this time going to add a

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:17.060 
reference this time going to add a
reference<00:00:15.839> to<00:00:15.960> the<00:00:16.049> drawing<00:00:16.379> system<00:00:16.859> that's

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
reference to the drawing system that's

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.040 
reference to the drawing system that's
built<00:00:17.310> into<00:00:17.550> Microsoft<00:00:18.060> on<00:00:18.600> that<00:00:18.779> framework

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
built into Microsoft on that framework

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.630 
built into Microsoft on that framework
so<00:00:20.010> let's<00:00:20.250> do<00:00:20.400> it

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
so let's do it

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.010 
so let's do it
and<00:00:21.090> this<00:00:21.210> will<00:00:21.359> take<00:00:21.510> a<00:00:21.539> little<00:00:21.779> while<00:00:21.990> to

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
and this will take a little while to

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.590 
and this will take a little while to
load<00:00:22.199> up<00:00:22.590> and<00:00:22.830> for<00:00:23.730> substant<00:00:24.090> isn't<00:00:24.269> always<00:00:24.420> an

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
load up and for substant isn't always an

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.660 
load up and for substant isn't always an
alphabetical<00:00:25.080> order<00:00:25.350> either<00:00:25.529> but<00:00:26.490> the<00:00:26.550> one

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
alphabetical order either but the one

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.700 
alphabetical order either but the one
that<00:00:26.789> we're<00:00:27.000> looking<00:00:27.090> for<00:00:27.300> is<00:00:27.599> system<00:00:28.080> dot

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
that we're looking for is system dot

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.310 
that we're looking for is system dot
drawing<00:00:29.490> okay<00:00:30.090> so<00:00:30.359> once<00:00:30.779> we've<00:00:30.960> got<00:00:30.990> that

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
drawing okay so once we've got that

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.069 
drawing okay so once we've got that
we're<00:00:31.560> going<00:00:31.650> to<00:00:31.710> hit<00:00:31.859> OK<00:00:32.309> and<00:00:32.750> make<00:00:33.750> sure<00:00:33.930> that

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
we're going to hit OK and make sure that

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.040 
we're going to hit OK and make sure that
then<00:00:34.290> gets<00:00:34.500> added<00:00:34.739> to<00:00:35.040> our<00:00:35.309> system<00:00:35.780> it's<00:00:36.780> just

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
then gets added to our system it's just

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.569 
then gets added to our system it's just
here<00:00:37.500> going<00:00:38.180> now<00:00:39.180> use<00:00:39.690> it<00:00:39.960> within<00:00:40.290> our<00:00:40.620> usings

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
here going now use it within our usings

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.729 
here going now use it within our usings
at<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:41.820> top<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.300> make<00:00:42.379> life<00:00:43.379> easier<00:00:43.710> for

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
at the top to make life easier for

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.650 
at the top to make life easier for
ourselves<00:00:44.000> what<00:00:45.000> we're<00:00:45.120> going<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.300> work<00:00:45.450> on

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
ourselves what we're going to work on

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.290 
ourselves what we're going to work on
first<00:00:45.930> of<00:00:46.020> all<00:00:46.079> is<00:00:46.200> the<00:00:46.320> camera<00:00:47.059> so<00:00:48.059> what<00:00:48.210> we're

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
first of all is the camera so what we're

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.240 
first of all is the camera so what we're
going<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.450> add<00:00:48.539> is<00:00:48.750> a<00:00:49.110> using<00:00:49.620> system<00:00:50.070> dot

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
going to add is a using system dot

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.850 
going to add is a using system dot
drawing<00:00:50.520> this<00:00:51.239> contains<00:00:51.690> things<00:00:51.960> like<00:00:52.289> the

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
drawing this contains things like the

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.850 
drawing this contains things like the
points<00:00:53.250> variable<00:00:53.850> a<00:00:54.230> bitmap<00:00:55.230> which<00:00:55.559> obviously

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
points variable a bitmap which obviously

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.049 
points variable a bitmap which obviously
we're<00:00:56.100> going<00:00:56.250> to<00:00:56.340> need<00:00:56.460> because<00:00:56.850> we<00:00:56.910> could<00:00:57.030> be

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
we're going to need because we could be

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.540 
we're going to need because we could be
drawing<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.510> graphics<00:00:58.050> quite<00:00:58.350> a<00:00:58.379> lot<00:00:58.710> and<00:00:59.190> will

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
drawing to graphics quite a lot and will

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.319 
drawing to graphics quite a lot and will
allow<00:00:59.789> us<00:00:59.820> to<00:00:59.969> create<00:01:00.239> our<00:01:00.750> class<00:01:01.530> of<00:01:01.829> camera

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:02.329 
allow us to create our class of camera

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:05.299 
allow us to create our class of camera
now<00:01:03.329> first<00:01:03.809> time<00:01:03.930> go<00:01:04.080> do<00:01:04.290> is<00:01:04.530> make<00:01:04.830> this<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:04.979> pod

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
now first time go do is make this a pod

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.070 
now first time go do is make this a pod
class<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:06.030> camera<00:01:06.330> needs<00:01:06.450> to<00:01:06.600> be<00:01:06.659> visible

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
class the camera needs to be visible

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.679 
class the camera needs to be visible
within<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.470> form<00:01:07.770> itself<00:01:08.189> and<00:01:08.580> we're<00:01:09.570> going

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
within the form itself and we're going

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.120 
within the form itself and we're going
to<00:01:09.750> need<00:01:09.840> a<00:01:09.900> few<00:01:10.200> different<00:01:10.500> bits<00:01:10.770> and<00:01:10.920> pieces

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
to need a few different bits and pieces

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.060 
to need a few different bits and pieces
of<00:01:11.909> variables<00:01:12.600> to<00:01:12.900> actually<00:01:13.350> run<00:01:13.470> our<00:01:13.650> camera

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
of variables to actually run our camera

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.370 
of variables to actually run our camera
so<00:01:14.760> I'm<00:01:14.850> going<00:01:15.000> to<00:01:15.060> start<00:01:15.330> with<00:01:15.540> the<00:01:15.840> variables

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
so I'm going to start with the variables

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.070 
so I'm going to start with the variables
themselves<00:01:16.909> the<00:01:17.909> first<00:01:18.150> variable<00:01:18.479> is<00:01:18.840> going

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
themselves the first variable is going

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.410 
themselves the first variable is going
to<00:01:19.200> be<00:01:19.350> the<00:01:19.500> offset<00:01:20.070> if<00:01:20.310> the<00:01:20.520> world<00:01:20.729> okay<00:01:21.360> so

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
to be the offset if the world okay so

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.060 
to be the offset if the world okay so
this<00:01:21.720> is<00:01:21.869> where<00:01:22.049> the<00:01:22.200> camera<00:01:22.590> currently

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
this is where the camera currently

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.600 
this is where the camera currently
drawing<00:01:23.340> that<00:01:23.700> can't<00:01:24.000> located<00:01:25.400> we're<00:01:26.400> going

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
drawing that can't located we're going

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.060 
drawing that can't located we're going
to<00:01:26.729> need<00:01:26.970> a<00:01:27.270> bitmap<00:01:27.930> which<00:01:28.320> actually<00:01:28.799> forms

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
to need a bitmap which actually forms

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.109 
to need a bitmap which actually forms
Andrus<00:01:29.520> screen<00:01:30.350> as<00:01:31.350> well<00:01:31.530> put<00:01:31.680> that<00:01:31.710> in<00:01:32.060> and<00:01:33.060> we

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
Andrus screen as well put that in and we

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.780 
Andrus screen as well put that in and we
also<00:01:33.270> want<00:01:33.540> to<00:01:33.659> know<00:01:33.810> where<00:01:34.079> on<00:01:34.439> our<00:01:34.740> fall

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
also want to know where on our fall

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.399 
also want to know where on our fall
we're<00:01:35.909> actually<00:01:36.030> going<00:01:36.240> to<00:01:36.360> draw<00:01:36.630> this<00:01:36.900> camera

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
we're actually going to draw this camera

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.499 
we're actually going to draw this camera
so<00:01:38.009> for<00:01:38.670> that<00:01:38.850> we're<00:01:39.030> going<00:01:39.119> to<00:01:39.210> use<00:01:39.329> another

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
so for that we're going to use another

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.340 
so for that we're going to use another
item<00:01:40.020> within<00:01:40.439> just<00:01:41.430> drawing<00:01:41.880> a<00:01:41.939> rectangle<00:01:42.350> and

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
item within just drawing a rectangle and

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.999 
item within just drawing a rectangle and
I'm<00:01:43.470> gonna<00:01:43.590> call<00:01:43.799> that<00:01:43.829> draw<00:01:44.280> a<00:01:44.310> location<00:01:45.829> if<00:01:46.829> I

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
I'm gonna call that draw a location if I

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:50.030 
I'm gonna call that draw a location if I
can<00:01:47.189> know<00:01:47.310> how<00:01:47.460> to<00:01:47.520> spell<00:01:48.079> now<00:01:49.140> we're<00:01:49.740> going<00:01:49.920> to

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
can know how to spell now we're going to

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.789 
can know how to spell now we're going to
draw<00:01:50.340> a<00:01:50.729> whole<00:01:51.000> series<00:01:51.299> of<00:01:51.420> Zed<00:01:51.780> levels<00:01:52.229> on<00:01:52.560> our

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
draw a whole series of Zed levels on our

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.670 
draw a whole series of Zed levels on our
camera<00:01:53.540> and<00:01:54.540> so<00:01:54.899> it's<00:01:55.079> a<00:01:55.229> we've<00:01:55.380> got<00:01:55.530> like

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
camera and so it's a we've got like

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.830 
camera and so it's a we've got like
objects<00:01:56.219> at<00:01:56.340> Zed<00:01:56.549> level<00:01:56.850> ones<00:01:57.060> at<00:01:57.299> level<00:01:57.509> two<00:01:57.689> Z

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
objects at Zed level ones at level two Z

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.270 
objects at Zed level ones at level two Z
level<00:01:57.990> three<00:01:58.229> there's<00:01:58.409> different<00:01:58.829> distances

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
level three there's different distances

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.520 
level three there's different distances
and<00:01:59.430> Heights<00:01:59.700> and<00:02:00.450> we<00:02:00.570> draw<00:02:00.810> in<00:02:01.049> Zed<00:02:01.259> level

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
and Heights and we draw in Zed level

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:02.990 
and Heights and we draw in Zed level
orders<00:02:01.829> through<00:02:02.040> all<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.369> items<00:02:02.399> on<00:02:02.850> Zed

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
orders through all the items on Zed

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.730 
orders through all the items on Zed
level<00:02:03.240> one<00:02:03.390> first<00:02:03.689> of<00:02:03.869> all<00:02:04.020> then<00:02:04.500> all<00:02:04.649> the

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
level one first of all then all the

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.770 
level one first of all then all the
items<00:02:05.040> said<00:02:05.189> level<00:02:05.430> two<00:02:05.549> drawn<00:02:05.820> on<00:02:05.969> top<00:02:06.240> and<00:02:06.540> so

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
items said level two drawn on top and so

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.900 
items said level two drawn on top and so
on<00:02:06.930> so<00:02:07.680> what<00:02:07.890> we<00:02:07.979> actually<00:02:08.099> need<00:02:08.369> to<00:02:08.520> know<00:02:08.580> well

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
on so what we actually need to know well

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.330 
on so what we actually need to know well
is<00:02:09.209> we<00:02:09.420> need<00:02:09.840> to<00:02:09.959> know<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.229> start<00:02:10.649> of<00:02:10.979> those

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
is we need to know the start of those

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.100 
is we need to know the start of those
draw<00:02:11.790> level<00:02:12.569> we're<00:02:12.840> going<00:02:13.020> to<00:02:13.140> draw

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
draw level we're going to draw

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:20.630 
draw level we're going to draw
and<00:02:16.110> the<00:02:16.440> end<00:02:18.680> otherwise<00:02:19.680> we<00:02:20.010> won't<00:02:20.159> know<00:02:20.370> how

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
and the end otherwise we won't know how

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.670 
and the end otherwise we won't know how
many<00:02:20.879> draw<00:02:21.150> this<00:02:21.840> might<00:02:22.110> mean<00:02:22.290> that<00:02:22.319> you<00:02:22.530> can

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
many draw this might mean that you can

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.940 
many draw this might mean that you can
attend<00:02:23.129> higher<00:02:23.640> up<00:02:23.849> than<00:02:24.000> the<00:02:24.150> camera<00:02:24.480> can<00:02:24.659> see

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
attend higher up than the camera can see

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.289 
attend higher up than the camera can see
that<00:02:25.950> are<00:02:26.099> hidden<00:02:26.430> from<00:02:26.459> view<00:02:26.700> if<00:02:26.970> you<00:02:27.120> like

00:02:27.289 --> 00:02:27.299 
that are hidden from view if you like

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:29.630 
that are hidden from view if you like
until<00:02:27.659> you<00:02:27.750> actually<00:02:27.870> need<00:02:28.230> them<00:02:28.440> we<00:02:29.430> need<00:02:29.580> to

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
until you actually need them we need to

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:30.800 
until you actually need them we need to
know<00:02:29.730> what<00:02:29.879> type<00:02:30.060> of<00:02:30.090> camera<00:02:30.329> it's<00:02:30.569> going<00:02:30.750> to

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
know what type of camera it's going to

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.170 
know what type of camera it's going to
be<00:02:31.069> so<00:02:32.069> again<00:02:32.400> we're<00:02:32.579> going<00:02:32.670> to<00:02:32.730> set<00:02:33.030> up

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
be so again we're going to set up

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.670 
be so again we're going to set up
something<00:02:33.450> this<00:02:33.659> one's<00:02:33.870> the<00:02:34.049> camera<00:02:34.440> type

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
something this one's the camera type

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.390 
something this one's the camera type
that<00:02:34.829> we've<00:02:35.209> we<00:02:36.209> put<00:02:36.450> together<00:02:36.569> this<00:02:36.810> video

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:37.400 
that we've we put together this video

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.970 
that we've we put together this video
the<00:02:38.400> enumerator<00:02:38.849> type<00:02:39.379> we<00:02:40.379> also<00:02:40.530> want<00:02:40.799> to<00:02:40.860> know

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
the enumerator type we also want to know

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.309 
the enumerator type we also want to know
whether<00:02:41.129> to<00:02:41.340> draw<00:02:41.840> the<00:02:42.840> background<00:02:43.349> or<00:02:43.620> not

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:45.319 
whether to draw the background or not

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:47.270 
whether to draw the background or not
what<00:02:46.319> times<00:02:46.560> we<00:02:46.739> actually<00:02:46.829> what's<00:02:47.129> wrong

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
what times we actually what's wrong

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.440 
what times we actually what's wrong
things<00:02:47.519> with<00:02:47.670> your<00:02:47.760> camera<00:02:48.090> that<00:02:48.209> don't

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
things with your camera that don't

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:49.610 
things with your camera that don't
include<00:02:48.720> the<00:02:48.930> background<00:02:49.379> that<00:02:49.530> you're

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
include the background that you're

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.190 
include the background that you're
drawing<00:02:49.859> on<00:02:50.069> top<00:02:50.420> so<00:02:51.420> how<00:02:51.510> do<00:02:51.569> we<00:02:51.690> set<00:02:51.900> up<00:02:51.930> this

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
drawing on top so how do we set up this

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.619 
drawing on top so how do we set up this
camera<00:02:52.410> well<00:02:52.829> just<00:02:53.370> like<00:02:53.900> we<00:02:54.900> did<00:02:55.049> with<00:02:55.260> the

00:02:56.619 --> 00:02:56.629 
camera well just like we did with the

00:02:56.629 --> 00:03:01.520 
camera well just like we did with the
structures<00:02:57.769> we<00:02:58.769> go<00:02:58.890> set<00:02:59.569> the<00:03:00.569> camera<00:03:00.930> up<00:03:00.959> with

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
structures we go set the camera up with

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.789 
structures we go set the camera up with
a<00:03:01.829> what's<00:03:02.159> called<00:03:02.220> initializer<00:03:03.799> draw

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 
a what's called initializer draw

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:10.130 
a what's called initializer draw
location<00:03:05.640> and<00:03:06.090> camera<00:03:08.720> stand<00:03:09.720> that<00:03:09.900> is<00:03:10.049> the

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
location and camera stand that is the

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.589 
location and camera stand that is the
capitalization<00:03:10.560> I'm<00:03:11.040> using<00:03:11.250> again<00:03:11.700> so<00:03:12.420> that

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:12.599 
capitalization I'm using again so that

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:13.940 
capitalization I'm using again so that
there's<00:03:12.840> a<00:03:12.900> difference<00:03:13.290> in<00:03:13.349> the<00:03:13.530> capital

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
there's a difference in the capital

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.849 
there's a difference in the capital
letter<00:03:14.159> C<00:03:14.549> for<00:03:14.760> camera<00:03:15.359> style<00:03:15.599> alone<00:03:16.140> camera

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:16.859 
letter C for camera style alone camera

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:20.720 
letter C for camera style alone camera
style<00:03:17.159> there<00:03:17.930> so<00:03:18.950> if<00:03:19.950> we<00:03:20.040> don't<00:03:20.160> actually<00:03:20.340> tell

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
style there so if we don't actually tell

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:24.589 
style there so if we don't actually tell
the<00:03:20.910> computer<00:03:23.090> where<00:03:24.090> we're<00:03:24.299> actually<00:03:24.359> going

00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:24.599 
the computer where we're actually going

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:26.059 
the computer where we're actually going
to<00:03:24.660> start<00:03:24.750> the<00:03:25.079> effect<00:03:25.440> as<00:03:25.680> in<00:03:25.829> when<00:03:25.980> the

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:26.069 
to start the effect as in when the

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:28.869 
to start the effect as in when the
location<00:03:26.400> will<00:03:26.700> start<00:03:26.940> at<00:03:27.120> zero<00:03:27.150> zero<00:03:27.450> zero

00:03:28.869 --> 00:03:28.879 
location will start at zero zero zero

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:32.300 
location will start at zero zero zero
the<00:03:29.879> screen<00:03:30.450> need<00:03:31.290> supposed<00:03:31.590> to<00:03:31.709> be<00:03:31.799> a<00:03:31.829> new<00:03:32.010> app

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
the screen need supposed to be a new app

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:33.800 
the screen need supposed to be a new app
and<00:03:32.609> we're<00:03:32.910> going<00:03:33.030> to<00:03:33.060> set<00:03:33.269> it<00:03:33.450> at<00:03:33.480> whatever

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
and we're going to set it at whatever

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.879 
and we're going to set it at whatever
size<00:03:34.230> that<00:03:34.980> the<00:03:35.099> resolution<00:03:36.139> has<00:03:37.139> been<00:03:37.440> set<00:03:37.709> so

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:37.889 
size that the resolution has been set so

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:44.000 
size that the resolution has been set so
this<00:03:38.099> is<00:03:38.220> the<00:03:38.340> camera<00:03:38.579> solution<00:03:41.989> the<00:03:42.989> a<00:03:43.019> might

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.010 
this is the camera solution the a might

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.689 
this is the camera solution the a might
be<00:03:44.099> 320<00:03:44.579> by<00:03:44.669> 240<00:03:44.849> 640<00:03:45.810> by<00:03:45.930> 480<00:03:46.139> who<00:03:46.709> knows

draw<00:03:48.150> a<00:03:48.180> location<00:03:48.690> we'll<00:03:48.780> just<00:03:48.989> set<00:03:49.139> to<00:03:49.169> the

00:03:49.369 --> 00:03:49.379 
draw a location we'll just set to the

have more detail or such as the actual
the<00:04:19.109> offset<00:04:19.500> so<00:04:20.120> I'm<00:04:21.120> going<00:04:21.329> to<00:04:21.389> create<00:04:21.630> a<00:04:21.930> new

00:04:22.219 --> 00:04:22.229 
the offset so I'm going to create a new

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:23.750 
the offset so I'm going to create a new
one<00:04:22.680> you<00:04:22.740> can<00:04:22.890> see<00:04:23.099> I've<00:04:23.159> just<00:04:23.219> copied<00:04:23.460> and

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
one you can see I've just copied and

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.010 
one you can see I've just copied and
pasted

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
pasted

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.870

and<00:04:27.020> what<00:04:27.350> we're<00:04:27.470> going<00:04:27.590> to<00:04:27.770> do<00:04:27.919> is<00:04:28.250> just<00:04:28.729> now

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:28.880 
and what we're going to do is just now

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.610 
and what we're going to do is just now
set<00:04:29.210> the<00:04:29.300> offset<00:04:29.449> I<00:04:31.690> think<00:04:32.690> really<00:04:33.050> all<00:04:33.410> the

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:33.620 
set the offset I think really all the

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.370 
set the offset I think really all the
rest<00:04:33.800> of<00:04:33.919> it's<00:04:34.040> pretty<00:04:34.220> same<00:04:34.610> and<00:04:35.139> now<00:04:36.139> this<00:04:36.290> is

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:36.380 
rest of it's pretty same and now this is

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:37.920 
rest of it's pretty same and now this is
one<00:04:36.530> the<00:04:36.620> other<00:04:36.650> things<00:04:36.800> that<00:04:36.949> we<00:04:37.100> could<00:04:37.280> do

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
one the other things that we could do

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:42.670 
one the other things that we could do
inside<00:04:38.930> a<00:04:39.380> program<00:04:40.180> is<00:04:41.180> we<00:04:41.389> can<00:04:41.540> overload<00:04:42.169> the

00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:42.680 
inside a program is we can overload the

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.580 
inside a program is we can overload the
function<00:04:42.710> so<00:04:43.370> the<00:04:43.610> the<00:04:44.320> ability<00:04:45.320> to<00:04:45.350> create

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:45.590 
function so the the ability to create

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:47.230 
function so the the ability to create
camera<00:04:46.100> you<00:04:46.220> actually<00:04:46.490> catch<00:04:46.639> with<00:04:46.820> different

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
camera you actually catch with different

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.750 
camera you actually catch with different
creations<00:04:48.020> if<00:04:48.290> you<00:04:48.410> like<00:04:48.590> it's<00:04:49.460> known<00:04:49.610> as

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:49.760 
creations if you like it's known as

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.719 
creations if you like it's known as
overloading<00:04:50.449> a<00:04:50.600> function<00:04:51.550> there<00:04:52.550> are<00:04:52.580> other

00:04:52.719 --> 00:04:52.729 
overloading a function there are other

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:54.310 
overloading a function there are other
things<00:04:52.940> we<00:04:53.090> might<00:04:53.210> want<00:04:53.419> our<00:04:53.570> function<00:04:54.050> our

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:54.320 
things we might want our function our

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.800 
things we might want our function our
camera<00:04:54.949> to<00:04:54.979> be<00:04:55.130> able<00:04:55.160> to<00:04:55.370> do<00:04:55.550> so<00:04:56.419> I'm<00:04:56.600> going<00:04:56.780> to

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:56.810 
camera to be able to do so I'm going to

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:58.930 
camera to be able to do so I'm going to
create<00:04:57.020> two<00:04:57.169> more<00:04:57.620> public<00:04:58.250> functions<00:04:58.760> which

00:04:58.930 --> 00:04:58.940 
create two more public functions which

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:04.960 
create two more public functions which
everyone<00:04:59.419> can<00:04:59.570> access<00:05:02.949> first<00:05:03.949> of<00:05:04.100> all<00:05:04.250> I<00:05:04.520> might

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:04.970 
everyone can access first of all I might

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:07.360 
everyone can access first of all I might
want<00:05:05.120> to<00:05:05.150> have<00:05:05.270> to<00:05:05.360> move<00:05:05.570> my<00:05:05.900> camera<00:05:06.370> insane

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:07.370 
want to have to move my camera insane

00:05:07.370 --> 00:05:09.070 
want to have to move my camera insane
and<00:05:07.699> I<00:05:08.060> might<00:05:08.210> want<00:05:08.240> to<00:05:08.419> move<00:05:08.600> it<00:05:08.690> to<00:05:08.720> a<00:05:08.810> set

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:09.080 
and I might want to move it to a set

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:13.860 
and I might want to move it to a set
location<00:05:09.800> so<00:05:10.610> what<00:05:10.850> I<00:05:10.880> can<00:05:10.970> do<00:05:11.270> I<00:05:11.300> can<00:05:11.449> actually

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:13.870 
location so what I can do I can actually

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:19.150 
location so what I can do I can actually
create<00:05:14.870> a<00:05:15.220> a<00:05:16.690> piece<00:05:17.690> of<00:05:17.840> code<00:05:18.080> of<00:05:18.410> a<00:05:18.620> function

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:19.160 
create a a piece of code of a function

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:21.909 
create a a piece of code of a function
this<00:05:19.699> is<00:05:19.760> a<00:05:19.940> method<00:05:20.120> returns<00:05:21.110> no<00:05:21.320> value<00:05:21.680> that

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:21.919 
this is a method returns no value that

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:24.040 
this is a method returns no value that
will<00:05:22.550> move<00:05:22.760> the<00:05:22.970> camera<00:05:23.270> to<00:05:23.300> whichever<00:05:23.600> select

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:24.050 
will move the camera to whichever select

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:27.070 
will move the camera to whichever select
section<00:05:24.650> that<00:05:25.460> we<00:05:25.610> set<00:05:25.850> so<00:05:26.210> officer<00:05:26.630> equals

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:27.080 
section that we set so officer equals

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.920 
section that we set so officer equals
new<00:05:27.229> position<00:05:27.820> so<00:05:28.820> instantly<00:05:29.360> that<00:05:29.539> camera

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:29.930 
new position so instantly that camera

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:31.450 
new position so instantly that camera
will<00:05:30.080> move<00:05:30.320> to<00:05:30.620> the<00:05:30.710> new<00:05:30.830> position<00:05:30.979> when<00:05:31.370> I

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:31.460 
will move to the new position when I

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:34.270 
will move to the new position when I
call<00:05:31.669> that<00:05:31.789> piece<00:05:32.000> of<00:05:32.150> code<00:05:33.010> sometimes<00:05:34.010> I

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:34.280 
call that piece of code sometimes I

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:36.670 
call that piece of code sometimes I
might<00:05:34.430> want<00:05:34.610> to<00:05:34.639> scroll<00:05:35.240> the<00:05:35.450> camera<00:05:35.900> by<00:05:36.380> so

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:36.680 
might want to scroll the camera by so

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:40.029 
might want to scroll the camera by so
many<00:05:37.330> pixels<00:05:38.330> so<00:05:39.320> what<00:05:39.470> I'm<00:05:39.530> going<00:05:39.650> to<00:05:39.680> do<00:05:39.889> is

00:05:40.029 --> 00:05:40.039 
many pixels so what I'm going to do is

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:47.379 
many pixels so what I'm going to do is
add<00:05:40.280> another<00:05:41.139> piece<00:05:42.139> of<00:05:42.349> code<00:05:43.660> points<00:05:44.660> 3d<00:05:46.389> I'll

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:47.389 
add another piece of code points 3d I'll

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:51.010 
add another piece of code points 3d I'll
call<00:05:47.630> this<00:05:47.720> one<00:05:47.780> new<00:05:48.110> offsets<00:05:49.510> no<00:05:50.510> so<00:05:50.720> create

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:51.020 
call this one new offsets no so create

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:52.690 
call this one new offsets no so create
my<00:05:51.139> curly<00:05:51.620> brackets<00:05:52.070> one<00:05:52.250> after<00:05:52.550> the<00:05:52.639> other

life<00:06:09.710> a<00:06:09.740> lot<00:06:09.919> quicker<00:06:10.130> so<00:06:12.039> now<00:06:13.039> I<00:06:13.099> can<00:06:13.310> move<00:06:13.460> my

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:13.520 
life a lot quicker so now I can move my

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.000 
life a lot quicker so now I can move my
camera<00:06:13.910> either<00:06:14.120> to<00:06:14.389> a<00:06:14.419> set<00:06:14.690> location<00:06:15.380> using

camera either to a set location using

00:06:16.010 --> 00:06:18.580 
camera either to a set location using
that<00:06:16.310> or<00:06:16.970> I<00:06:17.030> can<00:06:17.419> actually<00:06:17.510> scroll<00:06:18.020> my<00:06:18.199> camera

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:18.590 
that or I can actually scroll my camera

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:20.529 
that or I can actually scroll my camera
around<00:06:18.800> the<00:06:18.979> screen<00:06:19.340> which<00:06:20.090> is<00:06:20.240> life<00:06:20.389> a<00:06:20.449> lot

00:06:20.529 --> 00:06:20.539 
around the screen which is life a lot

00:06:20.539 --> 00:06:21.540 
around the screen which is life a lot
easier

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:21.550 
easier

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:23.469 
easier
finally<00:06:22.550> what<00:06:22.699> I<00:06:22.729> want<00:06:22.970> the<00:06:23.120> other<00:06:23.240> one<00:06:23.389> I'm

00:06:23.469 --> 00:06:23.479 
finally what I want the other one I'm

00:06:23.479 --> 00:06:25.180 
finally what I want the other one I'm
going<00:06:23.690> to<00:06:23.840> do<00:06:24.050> I'm<00:06:24.380> going<00:06:24.500> to<00:06:24.590> have<00:06:24.710> the<00:06:24.889> change

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:25.190 
going to do I'm going to have the change

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:32.680 
going to do I'm going to have the change
of<00:06:25.340> resolution

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:32.690 

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:36.230 

and<00:06:33.740> the<00:06:34.740> reason<00:06:35.070> for<00:06:35.190> this<00:06:35.340> is<00:06:35.610> you<00:06:35.940> can<00:06:36.060> use

00:06:36.230 --> 00:06:36.240 
and the reason for this is you can use

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:39.230 
and the reason for this is you can use
this<00:06:36.390> basically<00:06:37.020> to<00:06:37.380> zoom<00:06:37.650> you<00:06:37.680> know<00:06:37.980> how<00:06:38.910> it

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:39.240 
this basically to zoom you know how it

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:44.330 
this basically to zoom you know how it
will<00:06:39.330> look<00:06:39.360> on<00:06:39.630> your<00:06:41.540> on<00:06:42.540> your<00:06:42.720> screen<00:06:43.340> bitmap

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:44.340 
will look on your on your screen bitmap

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:45.680 
will look on your on your screen bitmap
and<00:06:44.610> we're<00:06:44.820> going<00:06:44.940> to<00:06:45.000> choose<00:06:45.180> it<00:06:45.390> the

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:45.690 
and we're going to choose it the

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:49.750 
and we're going to choose it the
isolation<00:06:46.140> dock<00:06:46.500> with<00:06:47.960> resolution<00:06:48.960> height

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:49.760 
isolation dock with resolution height

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:53.090 
isolation dock with resolution height
below<00:06:50.760> these<00:06:51.210> numbers<00:06:51.690> the<00:06:52.230> more<00:06:52.440> like<00:06:52.620> oil

00:06:53.090 --> 00:06:53.100 
below these numbers the more like oil

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:55.640 
below these numbers the more like oil
look<00:06:53.340> like<00:06:53.490> using<00:06:53.850> the<00:06:54.360> higher<00:06:55.170> the<00:06:55.320> numbers

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:55.650 
look like using the higher the numbers

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:58.010 
look like using the higher the numbers
the<00:06:55.770> monkey<00:06:56.160> zooming<00:06:56.490> out<00:06:56.640> okay<00:06:57.300> but<00:06:57.930> the

00:06:58.010 --> 00:06:58.020 
the monkey zooming out okay but the

00:06:58.020 --> 00:06:59.000 
the monkey zooming out okay but the
bigger<00:06:58.230> the<00:06:58.290> numbers<00:06:58.650> the<00:06:58.740> bigger<00:06:58.920> the

00:06:59.000 --> 00:06:59.010 
bigger the numbers the bigger the

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:01.550 
bigger the numbers the bigger the
resolution<00:06:59.490> of<00:06:59.580> the<00:06:59.640> camera<00:06:59.790> screen<00:07:00.360> the<00:07:01.170> slow

00:07:01.550 --> 00:07:01.560 
resolution of the camera screen the slow

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:03.170 
resolution of the camera screen the slow
your<00:07:01.800> game<00:07:02.010> will<00:07:02.190> be<00:07:02.220> because<00:07:02.640> the<00:07:02.670> more<00:07:02.910> work

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:03.180 
your game will be because the more work

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:06.080 
your game will be because the more work
the<00:07:03.450> software<00:07:03.810> actually<00:07:03.900> has<00:07:04.260> to<00:07:04.440> do<00:07:04.620> so<00:07:05.550> by<00:07:05.700> is

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:06.090 
the software actually has to do so by is

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:08.810 
the software actually has to do so by is
actually<00:07:06.240> our<00:07:06.750> camera<00:07:07.260> object<00:07:07.710> a<00:07:08.100> simple<00:07:08.730> and

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:08.820 
actually our camera object a simple and

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:10.210 
actually our camera object a simple and
straightforward<00:07:08.880> as<00:07:09.240> that<00:07:09.330> so<00:07:09.750> we've<00:07:09.960> got

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:10.220 
straightforward as that so we've got

00:07:10.220 --> 00:07:13.310 
straightforward as that so we've got
series<00:07:11.220> of<00:07:11.310> variables<00:07:11.610> there<00:07:11.990> which<00:07:12.990> we<00:07:13.170> can

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:13.320 
series of variables there which we can

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:15.920 
series of variables there which we can
use<00:07:13.530> to<00:07:13.560> set<00:07:14.130> up<00:07:14.310> the<00:07:14.460> camera<00:07:14.840> we<00:07:15.840> can

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:15.930 
use to set up the camera we can

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:17.180 
use to set up the camera we can
initialize<00:07:16.350> the<00:07:16.470> camera<00:07:16.770> in<00:07:16.860> two<00:07:17.010> different

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:17.190 
initialize the camera in two different

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:18.920 
initialize the camera in two different
ways<00:07:17.490> and<00:07:17.790> we<00:07:18.030> can<00:07:18.180> move<00:07:18.360> the<00:07:18.600> camera<00:07:18.870> around

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:18.930 
ways and we can move the camera around

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:20.780 
ways and we can move the camera around
either<00:07:19.260> to<00:07:19.560> a<00:07:19.590> fixed<00:07:19.920> position<00:07:20.070> before<00:07:20.610> we

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:20.790 
either to a fixed position before we

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:22.820 
either to a fixed position before we
switch<00:07:20.910> it<00:07:21.120> back<00:07:21.240> on<00:07:21.300> or<00:07:21.780> scroll<00:07:22.410> it<00:07:22.560> around

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:22.830 
switch it back on or scroll it around

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:24.530 
switch it back on or scroll it around
and<00:07:23.340> if<00:07:23.460> we<00:07:23.580> need<00:07:23.730> to<00:07:23.760> we<00:07:24.000> can<00:07:24.030> change<00:07:24.420> the

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:24.540 
and if we need to we can change the

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:26.990 
and if we need to we can change the
resolution<00:07:24.690> I<00:07:25.230> assume<00:07:25.680> in<00:07:25.830> and<00:07:25.980> zoom<00:07:26.160> out<00:07:26.370> and

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:27.000 
resolution I assume in and zoom out and

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.050 
resolution I assume in and zoom out and
that<00:07:27.360> once<00:07:27.780> saved<00:07:28.110> all<00:07:28.770> the<00:07:29.130> bill<00:07:29.340> gaming<00:07:29.730> is

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:30.060 
that once saved all the bill gaming is

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:41.980 
that once saved all the bill gaming is
that<00:07:30.240> your<00:07:30.480> camera<00:07:30.780> created

00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:41.990 

00:07:41.990 --> 00:07:44.050
