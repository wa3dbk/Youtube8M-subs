00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.300

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.150
 phone 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.619
 this phone takes the criteria 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.369
 Primal of Bazile Telecom 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.449
 ergonomics and simplicity composed of 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.390
 robust materials 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:37.770
 the doro 338 allows itself to be very 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.690
 lightweight 97 grams only this phone 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:44.120
 is available at bazile telecom en 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.120
 two colors in white like this one 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:50.850
 and in black as previously said 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.530
 the particularity of this phone etc it 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.780
 is used in the same way as a 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.600
 landline phone ie the doro 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.180
 338 is equipped with a large screen with a 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.010
 big print display and a 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.750
 numeric keyboard 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.130
 so he only offers the functions 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.270
 essential to be able to call or 

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:08.700
 receive calls 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:12.000
 like for a landline phone except 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:16.410
 that obviously it is portable in there 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.920
 dial a number and call for help 

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.920
 of the sea button 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.070
 when you receive a call on the hook 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:28.900
 just with that same key for 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.900
 to hang is the red key 

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:34.039
 the user at first sight does not have 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:36.549
 no menu that for benefit of 

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:38.450
 simplify the use as much as possible 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:40.460
 the user can not therefore 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.119
 deceive or do nonsense using 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.549
 the device 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:45.679
 there is obviously a touch menu that 

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:47.380
 is discreet and is on the edge 

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:50.360
 left of the phone 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.310
 so this menu allows you to do 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:57.380
 some settings like the management of 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:02:00.560
