00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:33.619 
really just the yellow parts so this is
a<00:00:30.300> seed<00:00:30.660> we're<00:00:30.960> not<00:00:31.080> going<00:00:31.230> to<00:00:31.289> eat<00:00:31.440> that<00:00:32.629> see

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:36.529 
a seed we're not going to eat that see
and<00:00:34.129> it<00:00:35.129> tastes<00:00:35.519> like<00:00:35.579> almost<00:00:36.149> like<00:00:36.359> you're

00:00:36.529 --> 00:00:36.539

and it tastes like almost like you're
eating<00:00:37.249> something<00:00:38.269> nature's<00:00:39.269> candy<00:00:39.600> that's

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
eating something nature's candy that's

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.989 
eating something nature's candy that's
what<00:00:40.140> it<00:00:40.260> tastes<00:00:40.440> like<00:00:40.530> to<00:00:40.800> me<00:00:40.829> this<00:00:41.670> is<00:00:41.850> the

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:41.999 
what it tastes like to me this is the

00:00:41.999 --> 00:00:43.819 
what it tastes like to me this is the
pod<00:00:42.210> or<00:00:42.539> this<00:00:42.780> is<00:00:42.929> the<00:00:43.050> part<00:00:43.289> that<00:00:43.350> you<00:00:43.530> eat<00:00:43.679> and

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
pod or this is the part that you eat and

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.879 
pod or this is the part that you eat and
I'll<00:00:44.339> cut<00:00:44.579> it<00:00:44.670> here<00:00:44.909> it's<00:00:45.839> kind<00:00:46.139> of<00:00:46.199> this<00:00:46.589> part

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:46.889 
I'll cut it here it's kind of this part

00:00:46.889 --> 00:00:48.919 
I'll cut it here it's kind of this part
is<00:00:47.010> a<00:00:47.039> little<00:00:47.129> on<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.519> tougher<00:00:48.059> side<00:00:48.269> in<00:00:48.600> it<00:00:48.719> I

00:00:48.919 --> 00:00:48.929 
is a little on the tougher side in it I

00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:52.099 
is a little on the tougher side in it I
guess<00:00:49.350> it<00:00:49.530> protects<00:00:50.179> these<00:00:51.179> little<00:00:51.600> things<00:00:51.870> on

00:00:52.099 --> 00:00:52.109 
guess it protects these little things on

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:56.840 
guess it protects these little things on
the<00:00:52.229> inside<00:00:52.379> see<00:00:54.620> Wow<00:00:55.679> and<00:00:56.010> then<00:00:56.159> you<00:00:56.280> reach<00:00:56.519> in

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
the inside see Wow and then you reach in

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.759 
the inside see Wow and then you reach in
and<00:00:57.149> you<00:00:57.379> pull<00:00:58.379> these<00:00:58.559> out<00:00:58.799> and<00:00:59.729> then<00:01:00.589> they<00:01:01.589> can

00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:01.769 
and you pull these out and then they can

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:07.280 
and you pull these out and then they can
be<00:01:01.920> eaten<00:01:02.339> see<00:01:02.690> for<00:01:03.690> me<00:01:03.839> yeah<00:01:05.840> but<00:01:06.840> they<00:01:06.990> taste
