right now the car is cruising at it has
been<00:00:33.989> for<00:00:34.290> a<00:00:34.730> little<00:00:35.730> bit<00:00:35.880> now<00:00:36.059> at<00:00:36.600> about<00:00:36.780> 75

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
been for a little bit now at about 75

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.979 
been for a little bit now at about 75
miles<00:00:37.500> per<00:00:37.770> hour<00:00:37.890> and<00:00:38.190> we<00:00:39.090> are<00:00:39.120> clocked<00:00:39.570> in<00:00:39.750> at

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
miles per hour and we are clocked in at

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.369 
miles per hour and we are clocked in at
a<00:00:40.020> twenty<00:00:40.559> eight<00:00:40.890> point<00:00:41.219> seven<00:00:41.840> MPG<00:00:42.840> average

so<00:00:44.219> my<00:00:44.789> father's<00:00:45.360> car<00:00:45.870> actually<00:00:46.500> went<00:00:46.800> up<00:00:46.980> or

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
so my father's car actually went up or

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.090 
so my father's car actually went up or
at<00:00:47.610> least<00:00:47.670> stayed<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.239> same<00:00:48.590> after<00:00:49.590> the<00:00:49.739> cold

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
at least stayed the same after the cold

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.920 
at least stayed the same after the cold
air<00:00:50.219> intake<00:00:50.550> installed<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.570> Mishimoto

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
air intake installed the Mishimoto

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.490 
air intake installed the Mishimoto
colder<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:52.590> take<00:00:52.739> install

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:54.500 
colder and take install

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.130 
colder and take install
in<00:00:54.980> that<00:00:55.310> video<00:00:55.520> the<00:00:56.270> immediate<00:00:56.690> results<00:00:57.050> that

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.140 
in that video the immediate results that

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.440 
in that video the immediate results that
we<00:00:57.230> gave<00:00:57.410> was<00:00:57.860> that<00:00:58.010> it's<00:00:58.250> it<00:00:58.670> was<00:00:58.880> dropping<00:00:59.360> a

00:00:59.440 --> 00:00:59.450 
we gave was that it's it was dropping a

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.840 
we gave was that it's it was dropping a
tiny<00:00:59.660> bit<00:00:59.900> but<00:01:00.140> we<00:01:00.260> said<00:01:00.500> at<00:01:01.040> least<00:01:01.160> I<00:01:01.340> said<00:01:01.640> it

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
tiny bit but we said at least I said it

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.000 
tiny bit but we said at least I said it
could<00:01:02.030> be<00:01:02.060> that<00:01:02.540> he<00:01:02.780> was<00:01:02.840> a<00:01:02.930> little<00:01:03.140> more

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010 
could be that he was a little more

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.820 
could be that he was a little more
I<00:01:04.960> would<00:01:05.960> say<00:01:06.110> he<00:01:06.200> had<00:01:06.290> a<00:01:06.350> little<00:01:06.560> more<00:01:06.680> of<00:01:06.740> a

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
I would say he had a little more of a

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.250 
I would say he had a little more of a
lead<00:01:07.040> foot<00:01:07.330> so<00:01:08.330> he's<00:01:08.480> probably<00:01:08.570> driving<00:01:09.080> it<00:01:09.200> a

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:09.260 
lead foot so he's probably driving it a

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:10.900 
lead foot so he's probably driving it a
little<00:01:09.440> more<00:01:09.560> quickly<00:01:09.740> after<00:01:10.460> the<00:01:10.580> install

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:10.910 
little more quickly after the install

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.390 
little more quickly after the install
and<00:01:11.180> or<00:01:11.510> maybe<00:01:12.050> the<00:01:12.200> car<00:01:12.440> had<00:01:12.650> to<00:01:12.680> tune<00:01:12.950> itself

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 
and or maybe the car had to tune itself

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.700 
and or maybe the car had to tune itself
I<00:01:13.670> mean<00:01:13.700> the<00:01:13.910> car<00:01:14.060> does<00:01:14.330> react<00:01:14.720> the<00:01:15.020> ECU<00:01:15.380> reacts

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
I mean the car does react the ECU reacts

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.490 
I mean the car does react the ECU reacts
to<00:01:16.250> changes<00:01:16.280> and<00:01:16.730> maybe<00:01:17.090> just<00:01:17.360> had<00:01:17.870> to<00:01:18.080> you

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
to changes and maybe just had to you

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.060 
to changes and maybe just had to you
know<00:01:18.590> get<00:01:18.740> to<00:01:18.800> that<00:01:19.010> point<00:01:19.220> so<00:01:20.260> there's<00:01:21.260> that

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
know get to that point so there's that

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.600 
know get to that point so there's that
next<00:01:22.730> time<00:01:22.910> I<00:01:23.240> pop<00:01:23.540> this<00:01:23.720> back<00:01:23.960> on

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.660 

you<00:01:26.970> know<00:01:27.120> I'll<00:01:27.300> give<00:01:27.840> you<00:01:27.930> an<00:01:28.080> update<00:01:28.170> I<00:01:28.440> guess

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
you know I'll give you an update I guess

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:32.810 
you know I'll give you an update I guess
you

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.870 

so<00:01:33.540> in<00:01:33.660> the<00:01:33.750> second<00:01:34.140> our<00:01:34.280> mpg<00:01:35.280> just<00:01:35.580> went<00:01:35.760> up

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
so in the second our mpg just went up

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.640 
so in the second our mpg just went up
one<00:01:36.480> tenth<00:01:37.490> of<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:39.060> gallon<00:01:39.240> nothing<00:01:39.930> major<00:01:40.140> so

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
one tenth of a gallon nothing major so

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.000 
one tenth of a gallon nothing major so
no<00:01:40.950> real<00:01:41.160> change<00:01:41.430> there<00:01:41.730> and<00:01:42.570> I'm<00:01:43.260> still

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.010 
no real change there and I'm still

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:49.320 
no real change there and I'm still
a<00:01:45.070> long<00:01:45.760> way<00:01:45.970> away<00:01:46.000> from<00:01:46.210> my<00:01:46.480> destination

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:49.330 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.120 

I<00:01:49.360> will<00:01:49.750> let<00:01:49.930> you<00:01:49.990> know<00:01:50.110> what's<00:01:50.440> going<00:01:50.620> on<00:01:50.800> I

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
I will let you know what's going on I

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.040 
I will let you know what's going on I
guess<00:01:52.230> in<00:01:53.230> another<00:01:53.530> hour

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:55.050 
guess in another hour

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:02.720 
guess in another hour

you

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.140 

can't<00:02:38.830> just<00:02:39.069> slow<00:02:39.250> down<00:02:39.520> because<00:02:39.730> I<00:02:39.880> gotten

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
can't just slow down because I gotten

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.590 
can't just slow down because I gotten
some<00:02:40.330> traffic<00:02:41.190> my<00:02:42.190> gears<00:02:42.520> are<00:02:42.760> shot<00:02:42.819> because

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
some traffic my gears are shot because

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.090

down to EcoBoost but just bears
