00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 everyone and welcome to efe 2 cl academy 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:08.660
 a series of short and concise videos 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:12.330
 where you will learn to master this phase of 

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:15.000
 The frydrych method is aimed primarily at 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.779
 beginners but later there will be 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.289
 videos also with advanced techniques 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:25.350
 well two things two requirements that you should 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.779
 meet to see these videos are 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.710
 first you have to master the method of 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:33.390
 beginners and second you have to know 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:35.969
 make the cross already the first step 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.760
 of the frydrych method aligned with its 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.750
 colors I can make it down you can make it 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.740
 up and then go around the cube 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:48.290
 well once those two things are mastered 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:51.440
 come on in this introduction video os 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:54.380
 I will give two general ideas so that 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:57.650
 you go practice the next videos what 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:59.660
 I will upload soon so that not many 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.330
 days because this needs a 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:05.380
 continuity not well then these two 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:09.050
 first important tips are that 

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:11.090
 as you know for f2 l is a defense the 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.790
 cross then let's do the first two 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:17.270
 layers that we will do inserting these 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:19.550
 2 x 1 blocks for this you have to 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.820
 look for these pieces on the top 

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:25.390
 and if we do not have them on top 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:27.650
 climb there are more advanced techniques 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.050
 for 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.330
 and learn to make the blocks without 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:35.060
 need to have the pieces in the 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:37.640
 top but for the moment you have to 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:40.520
 start with the easy and we will upload the 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:44.530
 pieces up well then for example 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.530
 we look for pieces that may interest us 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:52.770
 let's see if we have here above 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.450
 those on the orange side and green on the corner 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.130
 green orange white and the edge 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:00.060
 orange 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.950
 orange and green here is the corner and 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.289
 here is the edge and we have them 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.000
 up then depending on how the color is 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:07.890
 up there will be a series of movements 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.340
 which is what to explain in the next 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.200
 videos to be able to insert them 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.080
 but now let's find another one for 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.440
 example the orange blue orange corner 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.860
 and white 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.930
 the orange and blue edge is not up 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:28.070
 but it's down then we have to 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:30.440
 learn to climb this edge as 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:32.650
 so we are careful with for example 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.239
 do not take the corner 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.670
 down because we also have to 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:41.829
 have the corner above we leave here 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:44.290
 where it does not bother us and we raise the edge 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:48.310
 we already have it up but we have been 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:50.400
 undone the cross then we remove the 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:53.579
 top layer 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:56.879
 and we pray the cross we have two 

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:58.360
 pieces that interest us in the part of 

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:01.660
 above 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:04.300
 well this in terms of uploading the pieces to 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:06.970
 the top layer we also have to 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:10.750
 learn how to insert these blocks of 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:14.980
 2 x 1 once we have the layers or 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:18.420
 the pieces in the top layer and we were 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:21.910
 they form blocks ready to insert 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:24.880
 how they are inserted as there are different 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:27.130
 techniques I tell you the basic one the 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.709
 we have to start learning what would be 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.930
 well here we see that it is good in its 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:34.959
 block that inserts well but it 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:37.920
 undo the produces then as we will 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:42.650
 we look for the free space 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.650
 and we insert it in this way you see 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:47.330
 you have to look for the free space and if 

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:52.000
 we are here because we rotate the cube 

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:56.000
 and insert it another day would be to avoid 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.980
 these rotations do not, but that's why 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.690
 advanced techniques to insert 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:03.410
 directly but this is explained in 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:06.960
 our video for now let's dominate this 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:09.600
 let's not dominate this even 

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:12.500
 if we already have many heights if we 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:15.620
 will plow back this block 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:19.079
 you do not have to turn the bucket 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:22.650
 we could insert it like this 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:25.319
 well back up here this first 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:28.229
 introductory video I hope it's very 

00:04:25.319 --> 00:04:31.259
 useful for everyone recapitulating 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:34.319
 raise the pieces up the corners and 

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:37.500
 the edges we need and know how 

00:04:34.319 --> 00:04:40.759
 insert blocks two by one very very 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:43.939
 soon we continue with the next video 

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:43.939
 see you later
