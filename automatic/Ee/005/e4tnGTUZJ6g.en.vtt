how<00:01:40.270> big<00:01:40.600> a<00:01:40.630> wheel<00:01:40.899> stud<00:01:41.229> actually<00:01:41.799> is<00:01:42.009> it<00:01:42.459> goes

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
how big a wheel stud actually is it goes

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.699 
how big a wheel stud actually is it goes
in<00:01:42.819> through<00:01:42.969> the<00:01:43.090> drive<00:01:43.329> hub<00:01:43.569> a<00:01:43.780> full<00:01:44.140> four<00:01:44.469> and

00:01:44.699 --> 00:01:44.709 
in through the drive hub a full four and

in through the drive hub a full four and
a<00:01:44.770> half<00:01:44.799> inches<00:01:45.280> and<00:01:45.819> this<00:01:45.939> is<00:01:46.090> what<00:01:46.240> normally

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
a half inches and this is what normally

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.330 
a half inches and this is what normally
sticks<00:01:46.929> out<00:01:47.109> well<00:01:47.349> if<00:01:47.470> you<00:01:47.590> take<00:01:48.009> a<00:01:48.039> look<00:01:48.220> at

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
sticks out well if you take a look at

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.190 
sticks out well if you take a look at
the<00:01:48.489> right<00:01:48.849> side<00:01:48.880> of<00:01:49.270> that<00:01:49.360> car<00:01:49.630> you're<00:01:50.110> going

the right side of that car you're going

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.469 
the right side of that car you're going
to<00:01:50.289> see<00:01:50.439> exactly<00:01:50.640> where<00:01:51.640> all<00:01:51.759> of<00:01:51.880> those<00:01:51.970> bolts

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 
to see exactly where all of those bolts

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:54.300 
to see exactly where all of those bolts
have<00:01:52.689> been<00:01:52.750> sheared<00:01:53.289> off<00:01:53.409> in<00:01:53.709> fact<00:01:53.890> we<00:01:54.159> can

well you know and we did have a shot of
the<00:02:15.160> of<00:02:15.400> the<00:02:15.579> wheel<00:02:15.849> studs<00:02:16.239> after<00:02:17.019> the<00:02:17.110> run<00:02:17.260> now

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:17.410 
the of the wheel studs after the run now

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:18.930 
the of the wheel studs after the run now
the<00:02:17.470> key<00:02:17.680> here<00:02:17.709> is<00:02:17.950> you<00:02:18.129> look<00:02:18.310> at<00:02:18.459> the<00:02:18.549> top<00:02:18.730> here

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
the key here is you look at the top here

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.640 
the key here is you look at the top here
these<00:02:19.120> are<00:02:19.180> all<00:02:19.420> sheared<00:02:19.750> off<00:02:19.870> very<00:02:20.260> cleanly

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
these are all sheared off very cleanly

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.979 
these are all sheared off very cleanly
this<00:02:21.340> stud<00:02:21.670> right<00:02:21.880> here<00:02:22.209> isn't<00:02:22.660> so<00:02:22.840> what

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
this stud right here isn't so what

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:25.020 
this stud right here isn't so what
possibly<00:02:23.530> could<00:02:23.829> have<00:02:23.859> happened<00:02:23.950> is<00:02:24.519> this

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
possibly could have happened is this

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.849 
possibly could have happened is this
stud<00:02:25.359> here<00:02:25.569> was<00:02:25.720> actually<00:02:25.870> cracked<00:02:26.500> possibly

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:26.859 
stud here was actually cracked possibly

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:29.759 
stud here was actually cracked possibly
before<00:02:27.370> that<00:02:27.819> run<00:02:28.150> and<00:02:28.420> as<00:02:28.870> a<00:02:28.900> result<00:02:29.230> it

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:29.769 
before that run and as a result it

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:31.440 
before that run and as a result it
fractured<00:02:30.310> first<00:02:30.609> when<00:02:30.819> that<00:02:31.000> happens

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
fractured first when that happens

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.240 
fractured first when that happens
there's<00:02:31.569> way<00:02:31.989> too<00:02:32.019> much<00:02:32.440> load<00:02:32.739> on<00:02:32.889> those<00:02:33.069> other

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
there's way too much load on those other

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:34.589 
there's way too much load on those other
studs<00:02:33.609> when<00:02:33.760> you're<00:02:33.880> talking<00:02:34.180> about<00:02:34.329> a<00:02:34.389> car

00:02:34.589 --> 00:02:34.599 
studs when you're talking about a car

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:36.569 
studs when you're talking about a car
making<00:02:34.810> eight<00:02:35.079> thousand<00:02:35.560> horsepower<00:02:35.829> and<00:02:36.190> all

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:36.579 
making eight thousand horsepower and all

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:37.890 
making eight thousand horsepower and all
the<00:02:36.730> torque<00:02:37.000> that<00:02:37.150> one<00:02:37.329> of<00:02:37.389> these<00:02:37.480> top<00:02:37.690> fuel

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
the torque that one of these top fuel

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:39.750 
the torque that one of these top fuel
dragsters<00:02:38.290> make<00:02:38.500> and<00:02:38.739> it<00:02:39.040> just<00:02:39.280> shears<00:02:39.549> off

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
dragsters make and it just shears off

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.879 
dragsters make and it just shears off
the<00:02:39.940> other<00:02:40.120> studs<00:02:40.480> and<00:02:40.780> then<00:02:41.170> basically<00:02:41.410> sent

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:41.889 
the other studs and then basically sent

00:02:41.889 --> 00:02:45.030 
the other studs and then basically sent
Joe<00:02:42.069> Hartley<00:02:42.370> for<00:02:42.549> that<00:02:42.670> wild
