punch I'm just going to try and drive

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.280 
punch I'm just going to try and drive
those<00:01:23.870> pins<00:01:24.140> there's<00:01:24.560> four<00:01:24.830> of<00:01:24.920> them<00:01:25.040> one<00:01:25.250> two

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:26.290 
those pins there's four of them one two

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:30.600 
those pins there's four of them one two
three<00:01:27.290> four<00:01:29.110> through<00:01:30.110> to<00:01:30.290> the<00:01:30.380> other<00:01:30.470> side

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
three four through to the other side

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.920 
three four through to the other side
rather<00:01:31.610> than<00:01:31.759> trying<00:01:31.970> to<00:01:32.090> back<00:01:32.600> them<00:01:32.780> out

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:34.930 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:39.100 

those<00:01:35.930> pins<00:01:36.320> still<00:01:36.650> seem<00:01:37.130> to<00:01:37.160> be<00:01:38.110> keeping

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 
those pins still seem to be keeping

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.080 
those pins still seem to be keeping
those<00:01:39.380> plugs<00:01:39.770> expanded<00:01:40.430> on<00:01:40.550> the<00:01:40.610> backside<00:01:41.060> so

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:41.090 
those plugs expanded on the backside so

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.660 
those plugs expanded on the backside so
I'm<00:01:41.360> going<00:01:41.600> to<00:01:41.690> plan<00:01:41.930> B<00:01:41.960> which<00:01:42.440> is<00:01:42.650> to<00:01:43.250> finish

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
I'm going to plan B which is to finish

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.740 
I'm going to plan B which is to finish
this<00:01:44.210> off<00:01:44.479> by<00:01:44.750> drilling<00:01:45.560> it<00:01:45.649> out<00:01:45.770> instead<00:01:46.750> with

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
this off by drilling it out instead with

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.060 
this off by drilling it out instead with
a<00:01:47.780> quarter<00:01:48.200> inch<00:01:48.410> drill<00:01:50.440> all<00:01:51.440> we<00:01:51.649> need<00:01:51.830> to<00:01:51.920> do

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:52.070 
a quarter inch drill all we need to do

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:53.830 
a quarter inch drill all we need to do
is<00:01:52.220> make<00:01:52.369> sure<00:01:52.399> that<00:01:52.610> our<00:01:52.820> drill<00:01:53.180> is<00:01:53.360> not<00:01:53.509> so

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
is make sure that our drill is not so

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:01.890 
is make sure that our drill is not so
big<00:01:54.080> that<00:01:54.470> it's<00:01:54.649> going<00:01:54.830> to<00:01:55.630> hit<00:01:56.630> the<00:01:56.750> metal

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:01.900 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.180 

so<00:02:02.900> I'm<00:02:03.080> going<00:02:03.170> to<00:02:03.229> double<00:02:03.530> check<00:02:03.560> the<00:02:03.830> size<00:02:04.070> of

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190 
so I'm going to double check the size of

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.870 
so I'm going to double check the size of
the<00:02:04.250> drill<00:02:04.490> against<00:02:04.820> the<00:02:04.940> size<00:02:05.210> of<00:02:05.420> that

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:06.880 
the drill against the size of that

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.960 
the drill against the size of that
expansion<00:02:07.880> pin<00:02:08.330> on<00:02:08.509> the<00:02:08.600> backside<00:02:09.020> I<00:02:09.910> have<00:02:10.910> a

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
expansion pin on the backside I have a

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.320 
expansion pin on the backside I have a
new<00:02:11.120> drill<00:02:11.360> it's<00:02:11.560> 7/32<00:02:12.560> a<00:02:12.590> little<00:02:12.890> smaller<00:02:13.330> is

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
new drill it's 7/32 a little smaller is

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.949 
new drill it's 7/32 a little smaller is
if<00:02:14.860> so<00:02:15.860> I'm<00:02:15.920> just<00:02:16.069> going<00:02:16.220> to<00:02:16.280> drill<00:02:16.490> this<00:02:16.610> out

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:23.410 

that's<00:02:20.959> all<00:02:21.230> just<00:02:21.650> real<00:02:22.040> slow<00:02:22.370> was<00:02:23.060> enough<00:02:23.300> to

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
that's all just real slow was enough to

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:56.850 
that's all just real slow was enough to
break<00:02:23.690> that<00:02:23.840> one

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.800 

okay<00:02:57.860> there<00:02:58.099> it<00:02:58.220> goes<00:02:58.700> so<00:02:59.180> now<00:02:59.330> we<00:02:59.390> can<00:02:59.599> clean

00:02:59.800 --> 00:02:59.810 
okay there it goes so now we can clean

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:02.880 
okay there it goes so now we can clean
the<00:02:59.930> rest<00:03:00.080> of<00:03:00.230> that<00:03:00.319> off<00:03:01.330> put<00:03:02.330> the<00:03:02.450> new<00:03:02.599> one<00:03:02.750> on

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
the rest of that off put the new one on

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.440 
the rest of that off put the new one on
so<00:03:03.890> the<00:03:04.010> next<00:03:04.220> step<00:03:04.489> is<00:03:04.640> to<00:03:04.730> get<00:03:04.879> the<00:03:04.970> old<00:03:05.150> hinge

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
so the next step is to get the old hinge

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.899 
so the next step is to get the old hinge
off<00:03:05.780> the<00:03:05.959> fuel<00:03:06.230> door<00:03:06.500> and<00:03:06.769> since<00:03:07.519> the<00:03:07.640> fuel

00:03:07.899 --> 00:03:07.909 
off the fuel door and since the fuel

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:09.580 
off the fuel door and since the fuel
door<00:03:08.090> is<00:03:08.299> plastic<00:03:08.870> I<00:03:09.019> want<00:03:09.230> to<00:03:09.290> be<00:03:09.349> kind<00:03:09.560> of

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
door is plastic I want to be kind of

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:13.890 
door is plastic I want to be kind of
careful<00:03:09.769> about<00:03:10.129> this<00:03:10.720> I'm<00:03:11.720> going<00:03:11.989> to<00:03:12.080> try<00:03:12.290> and

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
careful about this I'm going to try and

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.740 
careful about this I'm going to try and
twist<00:03:14.900> that<00:03:15.019> hinge<00:03:15.410> and<00:03:15.650> pop<00:03:15.860> it<00:03:16.010> off<00:03:16.750> just

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
twist that hinge and pop it off just

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:38.510 
twist that hinge and pop it off just
break<00:03:18.200> it

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:38.520 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.650 

despite<00:03:39.520> being<00:03:39.550> so<00:03:39.910> old<00:03:40.090> it's<00:03:40.300> still<00:03:40.480> got<00:03:40.630> a

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
despite being so old it's still got a

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:58.350 
despite being so old it's still got a
good<00:03:41.020> grip<00:03:41.290> on<00:03:41.470> that<00:03:43.560> hinge<00:03:44.560> piece

00:03:58.350 --> 00:03:58.360 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.750 

so<00:03:59.360> the<00:03:59.480> hinge<00:03:59.720> didn't<00:04:00.020> find<00:04:00.560> my<00:04:00.770> screwdriver

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:01.760 
so the hinge didn't find my screwdriver

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.780 
so the hinge didn't find my screwdriver
prying<00:04:02.180> too<00:04:02.390> compelling<00:04:02.990> I<00:04:03.580> just<00:04:04.580> went<00:04:04.730> across

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 
prying too compelling I just went across

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:09.910 
prying too compelling I just went across
the<00:04:06.850> back<00:04:07.850> the<00:04:08.090> hinge<00:04:08.360> with<00:04:09.050> a<00:04:09.080> box<00:04:09.380> knife<00:04:09.680> like

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 
the back the hinge with a box knife like

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.400 
the back the hinge with a box knife like
20<00:04:10.310> times<00:04:10.490> I'm<00:04:11.390> going<00:04:11.630> to<00:04:11.690> try<00:04:11.840> and<00:04:11.990> pry<00:04:12.200> it<00:04:12.260> on

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 
20 times I'm going to try and pry it on

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:16.750 
20 times I'm going to try and pry it on
the<00:04:12.500> front<00:04:12.770> again<00:04:15.430> we'll<00:04:16.430> see<00:04:16.640> if<00:04:16.730> that

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 
the front again we'll see if that

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.810 
the front again we'll see if that
changes<00:04:17.239> its<00:04:18.170> mind<00:04:18.470> about<00:04:18.560> coming<00:04:18.829> off

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.550 

all<00:04:22.450> right<00:04:22.630> I<00:04:22.660> finally<00:04:22.840> got<00:04:23.080> that<00:04:23.200> thing<00:04:23.260> loose

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
all right I finally got that thing loose

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.590 
all right I finally got that thing loose
I<00:04:23.800> ended<00:04:24.010> up<00:04:24.070> taking<00:04:24.280> a<00:04:24.430> box<00:04:24.670> knife<00:04:24.910> across<00:04:25.240> the

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 
I ended up taking a box knife across the

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.040 
I ended up taking a box knife across the
ins<00:04:26.130> inside<00:04:27.130> face<00:04:27.400> the<00:04:27.640> hinge<00:04:27.910> the<00:04:28.510> back<00:04:28.750> side

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
ins inside face the hinge the back side

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:30.360 
ins inside face the hinge the back side
of<00:04:29.080> the<00:04:29.230> hinge<00:04:29.350> didn't<00:04:29.680> break<00:04:29.860> it<00:04:29.980> off<00:04:30.100> so<00:04:30.310> I

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
of the hinge didn't break it off so I

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.900 
of the hinge didn't break it off so I
just<00:04:31.590> came<00:04:32.590> in<00:04:32.650> through<00:04:33.010> here<00:04:33.280> and<00:04:33.460> carved<00:04:33.820> it

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:33.910 
just came in through here and carved it

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:35.400 
just came in through here and carved it
carved<00:04:34.210> carved<00:04:34.450> it<00:04:34.660> until<00:04:34.900> this<00:04:35.020> one<00:04:35.200> came<00:04:35.380> off
