 Hello, Alaa with you again. 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
 Now I will give you this educational paragraph on how to prepare the braids in crown form. 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:21.000
 The hairstyle in the form of a hairstyle crown is perfect for a hot summer as it keeps your hair up to the top. 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 We need a comb, and a lot of catheters. And also a hair fixator to fix the small parts of the hair. 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
 Now I will show you how to prepare this hairstyle. 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 Simply put, you have to quit your hair, so. 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.200
 Completely rest until the back. 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
 Then you will make a strand on each side. 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
 You can create this style if your hair is corrugated or uncoated. 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 I recommend you use a cream or a serum to control the small parts of the hair, or you can spray hair fixer. 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:36.000
 I will use Sansilk Koo Krishn cream, put a little of it, and then tie the hair so, specifically the end of the hair. 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:51.000
 Now argue your hair tightly 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
 You can use a clip to install it 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:46.000
 Now to the other half of the hair. As we did before, little of it. 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:43.000
 Now put it over your head and hold it firmly 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:04:05.000
 The last plexus is removed from the front. 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.000
 And now I get it from its end under the first plexus. 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
 Then fix it. 

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:36.000
 You can either use the clamps or leave them loose. 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:49.000
 Another tip. If your hair is on layers, you will have small flying hair. 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:05:01.000
 You can use the hairpin and small clips to hide it. 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:13.000
 Then brush the hair stabilizer, to make sure everything is in its proper place. 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:26.000
 As for the makeup I added a little kohl and eyes remained simple. I do not like to put a lot of make-up. I care more about clothes. 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:35.000
 I will wear jeans, a white shirt and a jacket. I also like to wear a scarf, especially if it is embossed or embossed. 

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:47.000
 This fancy scarf will be great. For this square scarf, the secret here is to wrap it around your neck like this. 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:53.000
 I hope you liked this paragraph, see you later.
