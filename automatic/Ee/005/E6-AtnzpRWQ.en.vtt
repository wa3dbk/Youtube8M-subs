00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
backstage politic problems and I was

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.220 
backstage politic problems and I was
almost<00:03:35.160> thinking<00:03:35.580> that<00:03:35.940> the<00:03:36.060> WWE<00:03:36.780> was<00:03:36.959> going

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
almost thinking that the WWE was going

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.860 
almost thinking that the WWE was going
to<00:03:37.380> release<00:03:37.830> him<00:03:38.220> but<00:03:38.880> it<00:03:39.000> looks<00:03:39.270> as<00:03:39.450> if<00:03:39.510> that's

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
to release him but it looks as if that's

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:43.010 
to release him but it looks as if that's
not<00:03:40.110> the<00:03:40.290> case<00:03:40.700> you<00:03:41.700> know<00:03:41.820> I<00:03:41.850> guess<00:03:42.239> the<00:03:42.390> WWE

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:43.020 
not the case you know I guess the WWE

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:44.930 
not the case you know I guess the WWE
does<00:03:43.350> need<00:03:43.739> someone<00:03:44.100> like<00:03:44.250> him<00:03:44.430> on<00:03:44.610> the<00:03:44.730> roster

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 
does need someone like him on the roster

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.380 
does need someone like him on the roster
but<00:03:45.930> I<00:03:45.989> don't<00:03:46.260> see<00:03:46.500> the<00:03:46.530> WWE<00:03:47.370> pushing<00:03:47.970> him<00:03:48.180> to

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:48.390 
but I don't see the WWE pushing him to

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.440 
but I don't see the WWE pushing him to
the<00:03:48.510> championship<00:03:49.320> match<00:03:49.350> any<00:03:49.860> time<00:03:50.190> soon<00:03:50.610> he

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
the championship match any time soon he

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.720 
the championship match any time soon he
might<00:03:51.690> get<00:03:51.930> a<00:03:51.989> taste<00:03:52.410> of<00:03:52.680> the<00:03:52.800> midcard<00:03:53.310> scene

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
might get a taste of the midcard scene

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.510 
might get a taste of the midcard scene
with<00:03:54.120> the<00:03:54.270> midcard<00:03:54.750> titles<00:03:55.320> but<00:03:55.620> as<00:03:56.160> far<00:03:56.459> as

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:56.520 
with the midcard titles but as far as

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.090 
with the midcard titles but as far as
going<00:03:56.820> after<00:03:57.300> a<00:03:57.330> WWE<00:03:58.140> title<00:03:58.620> or<00:03:58.800> a<00:03:58.830> World

that happening whatsoever and don't get
me<00:04:04.110> wrong<00:04:04.940> I'm<00:04:05.940> not<00:04:06.000> saying<00:04:06.420> that<00:04:06.510> Randy<00:04:06.900> Orton

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
me wrong I'm not saying that Randy Orton

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.170 
me wrong I'm not saying that Randy Orton
doesn't<00:04:07.290> deserve<00:04:07.830> it<00:04:07.860> I<00:04:08.220> mean<00:04:08.580> I<00:04:08.610> don't<00:04:08.910> like

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
doesn't deserve it I mean I don't like

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:12.170 
doesn't deserve it I mean I don't like
him<00:04:09.450> very<00:04:09.480> much<00:04:09.810> but<00:04:10.050> you<00:04:11.040> know<00:04:11.130> he<00:04:11.280> has<00:04:11.610> earned

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
him very much but you know he has earned

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.140 
him very much but you know he has earned
his<00:04:12.540> spot<00:04:12.930> on<00:04:12.989> the<00:04:13.230> roster<00:04:13.590> but<00:04:14.580> I<00:04:14.640> think<00:04:15.000> he

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
his spot on the roster but I think he

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:16.759 
his spot on the roster but I think he
seriously<00:04:15.690> needs<00:04:15.810> to<00:04:16.230> change<00:04:16.530> his<00:04:16.650> attitude

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
seriously needs to change his attitude

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:19.250 
seriously needs to change his attitude
if<00:04:17.489> he<00:04:17.609> ever<00:04:17.790> wants<00:04:18.209> to<00:04:18.239> get<00:04:18.540> back<00:04:18.870> to<00:04:19.109> the<00:04:19.230> top

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
if he ever wants to get back to the top

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.670 
if he ever wants to get back to the top
of<00:04:19.530> the<00:04:19.769> mountain<00:04:20.250> so<00:04:20.940> that's<00:04:21.239> that<00:04:21.680> Randy

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
of the mountain so that's that Randy

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.940 
of the mountain so that's that Randy
