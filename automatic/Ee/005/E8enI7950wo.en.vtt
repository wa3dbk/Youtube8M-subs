and have a dance

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:41.719 
and have a dance
I<00:04:39.110> suppose<00:04:40.110> so<00:04:40.919> the<00:04:41.070> thing<00:04:41.250> is<00:04:41.280> that<00:04:41.400> when<00:04:41.639> you

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:41.729 
I suppose so the thing is that when you

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:42.800 
I suppose so the thing is that when you
swat<00:04:42.000> them<00:04:42.150> they<00:04:42.270> probably<00:04:42.479> let<00:04:42.690> off

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
swat them they probably let off

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.510 
swat them they probably let off
pheromones<00:04:43.350> and<00:04:43.590> you<00:04:43.740> get<00:04:43.889> more<00:04:44.070> attacking

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:44.520 
pheromones and you get more attacking

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:52.330 
pheromones and you get more attacking
air<00:04:44.760> you<00:04:44.850> know<00:04:44.970> or<00:04:45.780> they<00:04:46.110> get<00:04:46.260> wound<00:04:46.500> up
