00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:05.859
 the intense rain that falls on pucallpa generates some havoc streets and 

00:00:05.859 --> 00:00:09.750
 shops in the city were flooded the gutters are 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.750
 obstructed and come now complain for lack of prevention 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.550
 in this season the rains are torrential 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:35.570
 After four hours I congratulate the fa were left without transit 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.230
 the water ran and the danger was latent because most of the gutters that 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.630
 they were full of trash the streets looked like river 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.160
 the shopping center trial 2 was completely flooded due to the strong 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.970
 rain 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.720
 the water was stagnant that did not allow the passage of pedestrians 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.720
 they have to take off their shoes and cross sewage 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.200
 the alpha lfp would be maybe the pgr in the fed should leave a pass to 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.200
 to be able to walk like this when it rains 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.200
 facetime of some disease that is 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.200
 degenerate 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:25.360
 the action of improvement to walk are characterized by force 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.159
 on the day of the Haitian tragedy 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:30.159
 Felix spend digital 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.370
 cereté was great and 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:37.370
 the relocation of the people of eta 

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:46.140
 is what they promise 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.890
 everything he says and what he does 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.310
 the health services studies were poorly executed 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.340
 because whenever there is a torrential rain it floods 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:56.790
 and delay more than three days 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.790
 let the waters come down 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.090
 in the for between fasa and is starting 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.520
 it brings bad smell 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.999
 in the kitchen 

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:10.769
 Of course I can not even be afraid 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:12.439
 that worry 

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:14.449
 have concern about this 

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:17.829
 from the thriving city he stated that it is an orderly and clean city 

00:02:18.669 --> 00:02:20.159
 for example let's give 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:23.459
 it is true that the mayor and who takes part in this matter 

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:26.519
 gonzález-sinde 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:27.939
 yes 

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:30.200
 always when I usually say 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.579
 It is always so 

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:34.579
 that people can not pass 

00:02:36.779 --> 00:02:38.539
 that if they fall 

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:42.769
 and the business and the investment business under the agent but welfare 

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:45.990
 but you can see that the mayor 

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.990
 defend the title 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:52.419
 somehow 

00:02:52.419 --> 00:02:54.110
 and this one is dragged 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.110
 buffoons that then ended up collapsing 

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:02.249
 the authorities should take immediate action 

00:03:02.249 --> 00:03:04.649
 my biggest party cleaning 

00:03:04.649 --> 00:03:07.489
 to prevent the drain pipes from collapsing 

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:09.370
 especially during the rainy season
