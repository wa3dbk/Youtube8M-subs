00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:11.240 

okay<00:00:08.360> this<00:00:09.360> is<00:00:09.599> step<00:00:09.929> number<00:00:09.960> two<00:00:10.590> again<00:00:10.860> we're

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
okay this is step number two again we're

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.730 
okay this is step number two again we're
building<00:00:11.730> a<00:00:11.820> routine<00:00:12.330> when<00:00:12.630> when<00:00:13.200> the<00:00:13.320> routine

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
building a routine when when the routine

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.430 
building a routine when when the routine
is<00:00:13.769> done<00:00:14.250> hopefully<00:00:15.150> we'll<00:00:15.570> practice<00:00:15.900> each

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
is done hopefully we'll practice each

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.380 
is done hopefully we'll practice each
step<00:00:16.859> of<00:00:16.980> the<00:00:17.100> routine<00:00:17.520> so<00:00:17.940> that<00:00:18.150> we<00:00:18.270> don't

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
step of the routine so that we don't

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.480 
step of the routine so that we don't
have<00:00:18.600> to<00:00:18.750> think<00:00:19.020> about<00:00:19.170> it<00:00:19.500> but<00:00:19.949> step<00:00:20.250> number

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
have to think about it but step number

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.759 
have to think about it but step number
two<00:00:20.910> is<00:00:21.470> ball<00:00:22.470> position<00:00:23.090> now<00:00:24.090> I<00:00:24.510> will<00:00:25.140> say<00:00:25.470> this

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
two is ball position now I will say this

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:28.910 
two is ball position now I will say this
for<00:00:25.830> your<00:00:26.220> average<00:00:26.699> golfer<00:00:27.300> if<00:00:27.990> we<00:00:28.320> play<00:00:28.650> a

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
for your average golfer if we play a

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.160 
for your average golfer if we play a
ball<00:00:29.279> position<00:00:29.730> in<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.269> center<00:00:30.720> as<00:00:30.900> you're

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
ball position in the center as you're

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.370 
ball position in the center as you're
learning<00:00:31.700> that's<00:00:32.700> probably<00:00:33.420> not<00:00:33.719> a<00:00:33.780> bad<00:00:33.930> way

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
learning that's probably not a bad way

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.510 
learning that's probably not a bad way
to<00:00:34.410> go<00:00:34.760> but<00:00:35.760> as<00:00:35.969> you<00:00:36.120> become<00:00:36.300> a<00:00:36.540> better<00:00:36.780> player

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:37.520 
to go but as you become a better player

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:40.340 
to go but as you become a better player
it's<00:00:38.520> not<00:00:38.670> a<00:00:38.730> bad<00:00:39.030> idea<00:00:39.059> to<00:00:39.450> have<00:00:39.690> three<00:00:40.050> ball

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
it's not a bad idea to have three ball

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.080 
it's not a bad idea to have three ball
positions<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.160> ball<00:00:41.340> positions<00:00:41.940> are

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
positions the ball positions are

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:43.970 
positions the ball positions are
somewhere<00:00:42.540> between<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:43.200> outside<00:00:43.620> of<00:00:43.829> your

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
too far back we hit it too soon and we

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.039 
too far back we hit it too soon and we

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
the club to do its work if I play it too

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.010 
the club to do its work if I play it too
far<00:01:30.450> forward<00:01:30.930> with<00:01:31.140> a<00:01:31.320> mid-iron<00:01:32.810> we<00:01:33.810> would

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
far forward with a mid-iron we would

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.140 
far forward with a mid-iron we would
tend<00:01:34.380> to<00:01:34.500> top<00:01:34.890> it<00:01:35.159> or<00:01:35.280> hit<00:01:35.430> it<00:01:35.460> on<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.700> upswing

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
tend to top it or hit it on the upswing

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.200 
tend to top it or hit it on the upswing
so<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:37.259> first<00:01:37.590> ball<00:01:37.860> position<00:01:38.310> with<00:01:38.729> most<00:01:39.060> of

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
so the first ball position with most of

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.990 
so the first ball position with most of
our<00:01:39.360> irons<00:01:39.780> are<00:01:40.770> going<00:01:40.979> to<00:01:41.040> be<00:01:41.189> in<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.430> center

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.000 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.360 

I'm<00:01:45.000> going<00:01:45.150> to<00:01:45.240> grab<00:01:45.330> another<00:01:45.750> club<00:01:46.250> I'm<00:01:47.250> going

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:47.370 
I'm going to grab another club I'm going

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:52.670 
I'm going to grab another club I'm going
to<00:01:47.490> take<00:01:47.670> my<00:01:48.480> 52-degree<00:01:49.380> gap<00:01:49.890> wedge<00:01:50.250> and<00:01:51.680> the

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
to take my 52-degree gap wedge and the

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.890 
to take my 52-degree gap wedge and the
ball<00:01:52.950> position<00:01:53.220> with<00:01:53.760> your<00:01:53.940> wedges<00:01:54.240> we<00:01:54.630> want

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:54.900 
ball position with your wedges we want

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.930 
ball position with your wedges we want
the<00:01:55.050> ball<00:01:55.290> to<00:01:55.320> be<00:01:55.500> just<00:01:55.890> a<00:01:56.040> little<00:01:56.070> back<00:01:56.580> from

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:56.940 
the ball to be just a little back from

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.540 
the ball to be just a little back from
center<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:58.200> idea<00:01:58.710> is<00:01:58.830> when<00:01:59.160> you<00:01:59.310> have<00:01:59.490> a

00:01:59.540 --> 00:01:59.550 
center the idea is when you have a

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.330 
center the idea is when you have a
system<00:02:00.090> of<00:02:00.270> wedges<00:02:00.780> what<00:02:01.710> we're<00:02:01.890> going<00:02:02.070> to<00:02:02.160> do

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
system of wedges what we're going to do

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:03.800 
system of wedges what we're going to do
is<00:02:02.610> we're<00:02:02.760> going<00:02:02.850> to<00:02:02.940> play<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.240> ball<00:02:03.450> probably

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
is we're going to play the ball probably

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.640 
is we're going to play the ball probably
just<00:02:04.170> inside<00:02:04.620> our<00:02:04.820> right<00:02:05.820> pet<00:02:06.350> we're<00:02:07.350> trying

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:07.650 
just inside our right pet we're trying

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.190 
just inside our right pet we're trying
to<00:02:07.920> make<00:02:08.100> a<00:02:08.160> more<00:02:08.580> of<00:02:08.759> a<00:02:08.850> descending<00:02:09.540> blow<00:02:09.750> and

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
to make a more of a descending blow and

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.700 
to make a more of a descending blow and
