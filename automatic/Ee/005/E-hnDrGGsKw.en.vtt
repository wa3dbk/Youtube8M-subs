here they're sitting up basically the

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:20.240 
here they're sitting up basically the
same<00:02:17.370> level<00:02:17.849> the<00:02:18.030> 10<00:02:18.810> is<00:02:18.989> at<00:02:19.109> its<00:02:19.260> max<00:02:19.530> strap

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.599 
same level the 10 is at its max strap
length<00:02:20.549> this<00:02:21.390> is<00:02:21.680> significantly<00:02:22.680> shorter<00:02:22.769> now

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:23.609 
length this is significantly shorter now

too<00:02:26.219> short<00:02:26.579> and<00:02:27.540> it<00:02:27.989> goes<00:02:28.139> much<00:02:28.290> longer<00:02:28.349> so

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:28.859 
too short and it goes much longer so

00:02:28.859 --> 00:02:30.920 
too short and it goes much longer so
it's<00:02:29.280> a<00:02:29.370> nice<00:02:29.639> option<00:02:30.389> to<00:02:30.420> be<00:02:30.629> able<00:02:30.719> to<00:02:30.810> go

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
have plenty of options with where to

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:44.640 
have plenty of options with where to
stick<00:03:42.129> things<00:03:42.569> the<00:03:43.569> one<00:03:43.810> complaint<00:03:44.290> I've<00:03:44.470> read

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
stick things the one complaint I've read

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.460 
stick things the one complaint I've read
from<00:03:44.769> other<00:03:44.950> reviewers<00:03:45.310> where<00:03:46.209> it<00:03:46.390> with<00:03:46.629> an

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.470 
from other reviewers where it with an

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:49.530 
from other reviewers where it with an
air<00:03:47.680> in<00:03:47.859> there<00:03:48.010> it<00:03:48.129> becomes<00:03:48.220> very<00:03:48.640> flat<00:03:49.090> and

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:49.540 
air in there it becomes very flat and

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.640 
air in there it becomes very flat and
stiff<00:03:49.989> on<00:03:50.739> that<00:03:50.980> side<00:03:51.299> that's<00:03:52.299> true<00:03:52.629> but<00:03:53.560> it

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
stiff on that side that's true but it

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.020 
stiff on that side that's true but it
really<00:03:53.829> doesn't<00:03:54.190> make<00:03:54.340> it<00:03:54.430> less<00:03:54.519> comfortable

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
really doesn't make it less comfortable

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:57.509 
really doesn't make it less comfortable
I<00:03:55.120> think<00:03:55.359> it's<00:03:55.480> stick<00:03:55.750> out<00:03:55.900> a<00:03:55.930> little<00:03:56.079> more<00:03:56.519> the

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:57.519 
I think it's stick out a little more the

00:03:57.519 --> 00:03:59.490 
I think it's stick out a little more the
one<00:03:57.670> thing<00:03:57.790> I've<00:03:58.000> done<00:03:58.180> is<00:03:58.510> if<00:03:58.690> you<00:03:58.870> don't<00:03:59.230> like

00:03:59.490 --> 00:03:59.500 
one thing I've done is if you don't like

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.470 
one thing I've done is if you don't like
that<00:03:59.709> and<00:04:00.010> if<00:04:00.370> you<00:04:00.459> don't<00:04:00.609> have<00:04:00.730> landscaping

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
that and if you don't have landscaping

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.750 
that and if you don't have landscaping
filters<00:04:02.230> and<00:04:02.379> things<00:04:02.470> in<00:04:02.650> the<00:04:02.709> front<00:04:02.980> you<00:04:03.579> wear

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
filters and things in the front you wear

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.339 
filters and things in the front you wear
it<00:04:03.849> backwards<00:04:04.150> it<00:04:04.569> will<00:04:04.659> hug<00:04:04.810> your<00:04:04.989> body<00:04:05.139> a

00:04:05.339 --> 00:04:05.349 
it backwards it will hug your body a

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:08.120 
it backwards it will hug your body a
little<00:04:05.560> bit<00:04:05.650> more

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:09.710 

but<00:04:08.520> it<00:04:08.610> does<00:04:08.760> help<00:04:09.120> if<00:04:09.300> you're<00:04:09.510> really

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
but it does help if you're really

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.950 
but it does help if you're really
concerned<00:04:10.020> how<00:04:10.260> flat<00:04:10.620> it<00:04:10.650> is<00:04:11.090> but<00:04:12.090> really<00:04:12.750> if

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:12.960 
concerned how flat it is but really if

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:15.110 
concerned how flat it is but really if
you're<00:04:13.140> looking<00:04:13.410> for<00:04:13.590> a<00:04:13.620> bag

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
you're looking for a bag

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.210 
you're looking for a bag
that's<00:04:15.360> going<00:04:15.599> to<00:04:15.810> hold<00:04:15.989> a<00:04:16.139> laptop<00:04:16.290> you're

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
that's going to hold a laptop you're

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.430 
that's going to hold a laptop you're
going<00:04:17.400> to<00:04:17.459> have<00:04:17.609> to<00:04:17.790> deal<00:04:18.000> with<00:04:18.209> a<00:04:18.239> firm<00:04:18.930> piece

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:19.440 
going to have to deal with a firm piece

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:20.629 
going to have to deal with a firm piece
of<00:04:19.560> equipment<00:04:19.980> in<00:04:20.040> a<00:04:20.100> bag

of equipment in a bag

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:22.640 
of equipment in a bag
I<00:04:20.669> would<00:04:21.030> assume<00:04:21.239> since<00:04:21.480> laptops<00:04:21.989> are<00:04:22.500> all

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.400 
I would assume since laptops are all
pretty<00:04:23.160> well<00:04:23.280> firm<00:04:23.660> so<00:04:24.660> yeah<00:04:24.810> this<00:04:25.080> this

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:25.410
