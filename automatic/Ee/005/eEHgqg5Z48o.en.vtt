00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
and I discovered that there is a new

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.310 
and I discovered that there is a new
firmware<00:00:12.210> for<00:00:12.780> the<00:00:12.870> samsung<00:00:13.469> galaxy<00:00:13.500> s3

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:15.320 
firmware for the samsung galaxy s3

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.570 
firmware for the samsung galaxy s3
that's<00:00:16.320> just<00:00:16.619> being<00:00:16.890> leaked<00:00:17.250> and<00:00:19.310> so<00:00:20.310> here's

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
that's just being leaked and so here's

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.410 
that's just being leaked and so here's
the<00:00:20.760> article<00:00:20.910> that<00:00:21.300> I<00:00:21.480> read<00:00:21.869> and<00:00:23.119> okay<00:00:24.119> so<00:00:24.180> I

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
the article that I read and okay so I

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.240 
the article that I read and okay so I
thought<00:00:24.720> why<00:00:25.050> I<00:00:25.080> better<00:00:25.410> install<00:00:26.039> this

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
thought why I better install this

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.179 
thought why I better install this
firmware<00:00:26.550> and<00:00:27.210> I<00:00:27.890> encountered<00:00:28.890> a<00:00:28.980> few

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
firmware and I encountered a few

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.389 
firmware and I encountered a few
problems<00:00:29.460> so<00:00:30.210> i<00:00:30.539> thought<00:00:31.320> i'd<00:00:31.529> share<00:00:32.189> my

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
problems so i thought i'd share my

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.049 
problems so i thought i'd share my
problems<00:00:32.579> with<00:00:32.969> you<00:00:33.090> guys<00:00:33.329> and<00:00:34.340> hopefully<00:00:35.340> get

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
problems with you guys and hopefully get

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.590 
problems with you guys and hopefully get
you<00:00:36.180> guys<00:00:36.210> all<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.899> new<00:00:37.110> firmware<00:00:38.210> so<00:00:39.210> the

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
you guys all the new firmware so the

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.610 
you guys all the new firmware so the
first<00:00:39.840> thing<00:00:39.989> mm<00:00:41.690> that<00:00:42.690> was<00:00:42.809> discussed<00:00:43.320> was

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
first thing mm that was discussed was

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.979 
first thing mm that was discussed was
why<00:00:43.980> would<00:00:44.190> you<00:00:44.340> install<00:00:44.730> this<00:00:44.879> new<00:00:45.149> firmware

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
why would you install this new firmware

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.889 
why would you install this new firmware
well<00:00:46.789> apparently<00:00:47.789> there<00:00:48.329> are<00:00:48.360> some<00:00:48.629> features

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
well apparently there are some features

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.069 
well apparently there are some features
that<00:00:49.230> are<00:00:49.590> on<00:00:49.710> the<00:00:49.969> s4<00:00:51.680> galaxy<00:00:52.680> s4<00:00:53.399> that<00:00:53.789> can

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:54.079 
that are on the s4 galaxy s4 that can

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:58.279 
that are on the s4 galaxy s4 that can
that<00:00:55.079> can<00:00:55.140> now<00:00:55.500> be<00:00:55.559> worked<00:00:56.309> with<00:00:56.579> s3<00:00:57.300> so<00:00:57.719> that

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
that can now be worked with s3 so that

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:00.080 
that can now be worked with s3 so that
is<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.590> reason<00:00:58.620> why<00:00:59.010> you<00:00:59.219> should<00:00:59.640> get<00:00:59.820> this

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
is the reason why you should get this

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.399 
is the reason why you should get this
firmware<00:01:00.590> some<00:01:01.590> other<00:01:01.770> features<00:01:02.280> include<00:01:03.409> new

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
firmware some other features include new

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.289 
firmware some other features include new
lock<00:01:04.710> screens<00:01:06.049> driving<00:01:07.049> mode<00:01:08.119> addition<00:01:09.119> of

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
lock screens driving mode addition of

lock screens driving mode addition of
voice<00:01:09.540> controls<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:11.010> so<00:01:11.970> on<00:01:12.060> read<00:01:12.299> this

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
voice controls and so on read this

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.310 
voice controls and so on read this
article<00:01:12.720> to<00:01:13.350> find<00:01:13.619> out<00:01:13.890> more<00:01:14.990> but<00:01:15.990> basically

first step once you have downloaded it

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.479 
first step once you have downloaded it
so<00:02:23.540> I've<00:02:24.500> downloaded<00:02:24.890> into<00:02:25.370> this<00:02:26.120> folder<00:02:26.420> here

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
so I've downloaded into this folder here

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:31.150 
so I've downloaded into this folder here
into<00:02:28.489> my<00:02:28.610> desktop<00:02:29.180> and<00:02:30.010> once<00:02:31.010> you've
