brain<00:03:55.110> slash<00:04:19.910> carbon<00:04:20.959> hybrid<00:04:21.959> boom<00:04:22.169> do<00:04:22.889> it

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
brain slash carbon hybrid boom do it

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:28.310 
brain slash carbon hybrid boom do it
which<00:04:25.260> is<00:04:25.380> pretty<00:04:25.560> nice<00:04:26.630> okay<00:04:27.630> I<00:04:27.720> noticed<00:04:28.110> oh

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
which is pretty nice okay I noticed oh

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.820 
which is pretty nice okay I noticed oh
and<00:04:28.800> also<00:04:29.520> carbon<00:04:30.180> supports<00:04:30.870> are<00:04:31.020> there<00:04:31.050> one

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
and also carbon supports are there one

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.170 
and also carbon supports are there one
thing<00:04:31.949> I<00:04:32.070> notice<00:04:32.310> that<00:04:32.520> these<00:04:32.699> links<00:04:33.060> are

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
thing I notice that these links are

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.629 
thing I notice that these links are
already<00:04:33.449> pre-made<00:04:33.870> so<00:04:34.860> that's<00:04:35.340> gonna<00:04:35.490> save

00:04:35.629 --> 00:04:35.639 
already pre-made so that's gonna save

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:54.620 
already pre-made so that's gonna save
you<00:04:35.729> a<00:04:35.760> lot<00:04:35.880> of<00:04:35.940> time<00:04:44.960> metal<00:04:45.960> tour<00:04:46.169> -<00:04:53.539> one<00:04:54.539> other

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
you a lot of time metal tour - one other

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:57.529 
you a lot of time metal tour - one other
thing<00:04:54.900> I<00:04:54.960> did<00:04:55.110> notice<00:04:55.320> is<00:04:55.680> that<00:04:56.539> this

00:04:57.529 --> 00:04:57.539 
thing I did notice is that this

00:04:57.539 --> 00:05:02.960 
thing I did notice is that this
particular<00:04:57.840> model<00:04:58.139> has<00:04:59.539> these<00:05:01.039> clamping<00:05:02.039> this

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:02.970 
particular model has these clamping this

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:04.490 
particular model has these clamping this
is<00:05:03.120> clamping<00:05:03.450> mechanism<00:05:03.479> that<00:05:03.960> goes<00:05:04.080> on<00:05:04.320> the

00:05:04.490 --> 00:05:04.500 
is clamping mechanism that goes on the

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.830 
is clamping mechanism that goes on the
on<00:05:04.889> the<00:05:05.039> servos<00:05:05.460> so<00:05:06.150> there's<00:05:06.360> no<00:05:06.479> you<00:05:06.750> know

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
on the servos so there's no you know

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.420 
on the servos so there's no you know
it's<00:05:07.020> setting<00:05:07.349> subterms<00:05:07.740> up<00:05:07.950> on<00:05:08.070> the<00:05:08.130> servos

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:08.430 
it's setting subterms up on the servos

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:09.589 
it's setting subterms up on the servos
anymore<00:05:08.729> you<00:05:08.820> just<00:05:09.000> mount<00:05:09.210> these<00:05:09.360> little

00:05:09.589 --> 00:05:09.599 
anymore you just mount these little

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:12.980 
anymore you just mount these little
inserts<00:05:09.900> and<00:05:10.349> then<00:05:11.250> you<00:05:12.180> do<00:05:12.630> these<00:05:12.780> little

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 
inserts and then you do these little

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:16.760 
inserts and then you do these little
split<00:05:13.320> clamp<00:05:14.780> arms<00:05:15.780> that<00:05:16.080> slip<00:05:16.440> over<00:05:16.620> the

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.770 
split clamp arms that slip over the

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:20.120 
split clamp arms that slip over the
insert<00:05:17.160> and<00:05:17.539> you<00:05:18.539> set<00:05:18.720> up<00:05:18.810> your<00:05:18.990> your<00:05:19.650> linkages

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:20.130 
insert and you set up your your linkages

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:22.670 
insert and you set up your your linkages
straight<00:05:21.060> and<00:05:21.479> then<00:05:22.080> you<00:05:22.110> just<00:05:22.320> clamp<00:05:22.500> them

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 
straight and then you just clamp them

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:25.670 
straight and then you just clamp them
down<00:05:22.710> at<00:05:23.010> zero<00:05:23.190> degrees<00:05:23.490> so<00:05:23.669> trim<00:05:23.940> and<00:05:24.680> you're

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:25.680 
down at zero degrees so trim and you're

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:26.870 
down at zero degrees so trim and you're
ready<00:05:25.860> to<00:05:25.950> go

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:26.880 
ready to go

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.580 
ready to go
looks<00:05:27.450> like<00:05:27.570> this<00:05:27.690> stuff<00:05:27.900> is<00:05:28.080> all<00:05:28.200> pretty<00:05:28.380> high

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:28.590 
looks like this stuff is all pretty high

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:37.890 
looks like this stuff is all pretty high
quality<00:05:28.650> here<00:05:31.580> specific<00:05:32.580> grips<00:05:32.820> are<00:05:33.000> together

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:37.900 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:41.129 

together<00:05:38.199> so<00:05:38.889> they're<00:05:39.100> already<00:05:39.930> ready<00:05:40.930> to<00:05:41.020> go

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:41.139 
together so they're already ready to go

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:44.249 
together so they're already ready to go
another<00:05:41.680> thing<00:05:41.919> in<00:05:42.070> those<00:05:42.250> this<00:05:42.810> these<00:05:43.810> arms

00:05:44.249 --> 00:05:44.259 
another thing in those this these arms

00:05:44.259 --> 00:05:46.100 
another thing in those this these arms
the<00:05:44.380> pitch<00:05:44.680> arms<00:05:44.949> going<00:05:45.160> to<00:05:45.250> the<00:05:45.310> swashplate

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:46.110 
the pitch arms going to the swashplate

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:48.870 
the pitch arms going to the swashplate
they're<00:05:47.110> pretty<00:05:47.350> large<00:05:47.560> so<00:05:48.460> you're<00:05:48.639> gonna<00:05:48.729> get

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:48.880 
they're pretty large so you're gonna get

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.300 
they're pretty large so you're gonna get
a<00:05:48.940> lot<00:05:49.030> of<00:05:49.150> resolution<00:05:49.630> from<00:05:49.780> them<00:05:49.930> but<00:05:50.860> the

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:51.310 
a lot of resolution from them but the

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:54.360 
a lot of resolution from them but the
reason<00:05:51.639> why<00:05:51.759> the<00:05:51.820> large<00:05:52.180> is<00:05:53.160> because<00:05:54.160> there's

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:54.370 
reason why the large is because there's

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:58.320 
reason why the large is because there's
actually<00:05:54.580> a<00:05:55.030> bell<00:05:55.870> crank<00:05:56.259> on<00:05:56.860> the<00:05:57.490> seesaw<00:05:57.940> or

00:05:58.320 --> 00:05:58.330 
actually a bell crank on the seesaw or

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:02.340 
actually a bell crank on the seesaw or
none<00:05:59.050> of<00:05:59.080> the<00:05:59.229> seesaw<00:05:59.590> but<00:05:59.979> the<00:06:01.169> yeah<00:06:02.169> I<00:06:02.199> guess

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:02.350 
none of the seesaw but the yeah I guess

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:05.909 
none of the seesaw but the yeah I guess
it's<00:06:02.500> a<00:06:02.530> seesaw<00:06:02.889> and<00:06:04.229> it's<00:06:05.229> like<00:06:05.440> a<00:06:05.470> double

00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:05.919 
it's a seesaw and it's like a double

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:08.040 
it's a seesaw and it's like a double
mechanism<00:06:06.820> that<00:06:06.910> goes<00:06:07.060> from<00:06:07.330> the<00:06:07.479> swashplate

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:08.050 
mechanism that goes from the swashplate

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:12.450 
mechanism that goes from the swashplate
to<00:06:08.620> the<00:06:09.449> blade<00:06:10.449> grass<00:06:10.690> so<00:06:11.380> that<00:06:11.650> takes<00:06:12.130> care<00:06:12.400> of

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:12.460 
to the blade grass so that takes care of

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:14.640 
to the blade grass so that takes care of
the<00:06:12.639> anti<00:06:12.910> rotation<00:06:13.289> anti-radiation<00:06:14.289> okay

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:14.650 
the anti rotation anti-radiation okay

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:16.800 
the anti rotation anti-radiation okay
let's<00:06:14.949> say<00:06:15.100> takes<00:06:16.030> care<00:06:16.180> the<00:06:16.210> anti<00:06:16.539> rotation

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:16.810 
let's say takes care the anti rotation

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:19.439 
let's say takes care the anti rotation
and<00:06:17.680> also<00:06:18.130> the<00:06:18.250> pitch<00:06:18.460> length<00:06:18.699> going<00:06:19.150> to<00:06:19.300> this

00:06:19.439 --> 00:06:19.449 
and also the pitch length going to this

00:06:19.449 --> 00:06:21.779 
and also the pitch length going to this
are<00:06:19.810> going<00:06:20.199> to<00:06:20.260> the<00:06:20.350> blade<00:06:20.530> room<00:06:20.770> so<00:06:21.070> kind<00:06:21.729> of

00:06:21.779 --> 00:06:21.789 
are going to the blade room so kind of

00:06:21.789 --> 00:06:23.250 
are going to the blade room so kind of
kill<00:06:21.910> a<00:06:21.940> couple<00:06:22.090> birds<00:06:22.360> at<00:06:22.510> that<00:06:22.690> and<00:06:22.990> you

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:23.260 
kill a couple birds at that and you

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:24.779 
kill a couple birds at that and you
split<00:06:23.590> up<00:06:23.710> the<00:06:23.800> resolution<00:06:24.070> a<00:06:24.340> little<00:06:24.550> bit<00:06:24.639> see

00:06:24.779 --> 00:06:24.789 
split up the resolution a little bit see

00:06:24.789 --> 00:06:26.909 
split up the resolution a little bit see
if<00:06:24.820> he's<00:06:25.150> really<00:06:25.270> long<00:06:25.539> like<00:06:25.750> our<00:06:25.960> longer<00:06:26.680> arms

00:06:26.909 --> 00:06:26.919 
if he's really long like our longer arms

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:29.760 
if he's really long like our longer arms
up<00:06:27.039> here<00:06:27.220> so<00:06:27.400> that's<00:06:28.120> kinda<00:06:28.330> innovative

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:29.770 
up here so that's kinda innovative

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:30.689 
up here so that's kinda innovative
let's<00:06:30.160> take<00:06:30.250> everything's<00:06:30.550> pretty

00:06:30.689 --> 00:06:30.699 
let's take everything's pretty

00:06:30.699 --> 00:06:34.469 
let's take everything's pretty
high-quality<00:06:30.940> and<00:06:33.180> looking<00:06:34.180> forward<00:06:34.360> to

00:06:34.469 --> 00:06:34.479 
high-quality and looking forward to

00:06:34.479 --> 00:06:37.550 
high-quality and looking forward to
building<00:06:34.750> it<00:06:34.870> so<00:06:35.820> thanks<00:06:36.820> for<00:06:36.910> watching<00:06:36.970> and

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:37.560 
building it so thanks for watching and

00:06:37.560 --> 00:06:40.860
