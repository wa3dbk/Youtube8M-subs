yesterday with the Avril Lavigne show it

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.139 
yesterday with the Avril Lavigne show it
was<00:00:46.469> very<00:00:46.829> rock<00:00:47.100> and<00:00:47.340> roll<00:00:47.520> but<00:00:47.940> it<00:00:48.059> was

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
was very rock and roll but it was

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.549 
was very rock and roll but it was
important<00:00:48.600> that<00:00:48.629> I<00:00:48.719> took<00:00:48.840> that<00:00:49.050> rock<00:00:49.350> and

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
important that I took that rock and

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.200 
important that I took that rock and
roller<00:00:49.770> look<00:00:50.070> and<00:00:50.340> made<00:00:50.640> it<00:00:50.760> look<00:00:50.940> a<00:00:51.059> little

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
roller look and made it look a little

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.209 
roller look and made it look a little
more<00:00:51.420> fashion-forward<00:00:51.930> and<00:00:52.680> I<00:00:52.770> think<00:00:53.010> that<00:00:53.129> we

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
more fashion-forward and I think that we

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.850 
more fashion-forward and I think that we
really<00:00:53.250> accomplished<00:00:53.910> that<00:00:54.059> and<00:00:54.739> you<00:00:55.739> know<00:00:55.829> I

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
really accomplished that and you know I

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.500 
really accomplished that and you know I
go<00:00:56.070> back<00:00:56.100> and<00:00:56.370> forth<00:00:56.550> between<00:00:56.670> work<00:00:57.149> in<00:00:57.270> LA

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
go back and forth between work in LA

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.569 
go back and forth between work in LA
sometimes<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.260> LA<00:00:58.530> design<00:00:58.920> aesthetic<00:00:59.399> is

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
sometimes the LA design aesthetic is

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.810 
sometimes the LA design aesthetic is
very<00:00:59.940> different<00:01:00.539> so<00:01:00.719> I<00:01:00.750> have<00:01:00.989> to<00:01:01.199> wear<00:01:01.410> a

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.950 
that feels timely and timeless at the
same<00:01:35.250> time<00:01:35.579> because<00:01:36.060> I<00:01:36.090> want<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.600> makeup<00:01:36.810> to

same time because I want the makeup to

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.319 
same time because I want the makeup to
feel<00:01:37.229> modern<00:01:37.740> but<00:01:38.070> I<00:01:38.100> also<00:01:38.430> wanted<00:01:39.000> to<00:01:39.060> do

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.600 
feel modern but I also wanted to do
Hanoi<00:01:39.869> but<00:01:40.200> I<00:01:40.590> never<00:01:40.920> want<00:01:41.130> someone<00:01:41.400> to<00:01:41.490> look

back<00:01:41.820> at<00:01:42.000> a<00:01:42.030> picture<00:01:42.450> and<00:01:42.630> say<00:01:42.810> oh<00:01:43.020> that<00:01:43.140> so

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420

2012

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.840 
2012
I<00:01:47.740> think<00:01:48.740> the<00:01:48.830> biggest<00:01:49.040> struggle<00:01:49.220> for<00:01:49.640> a<00:01:49.670> lot

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
I think the biggest struggle for a lot

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:51.400 
I think the biggest struggle for a lot
of<00:01:49.880> young<00:01:50.150> artists<00:01:50.510> is<00:01:50.660> understanding<00:01:51.290> the

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:51.410 
of young artists is understanding the

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.650 
of young artists is understanding the
balance<00:01:51.560> between<00:01:51.920> art<00:01:52.340> and<00:01:52.430> commerce<00:01:52.550> I<00:01:53.210> think

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:53.660 
balance between art and commerce I think

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.650 
balance between art and commerce I think
that<00:01:53.990> this<00:01:54.950> is<00:01:55.160> a<00:01:55.190> business<00:01:55.700> and<00:01:56.000> so<00:01:56.480> many

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:56.660 
that this is a business and so many

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.360 
that this is a business and so many
people<00:01:56.750> want<00:01:57.050> to<00:01:57.080> BRD<00:01:57.590> and<00:01:57.770> they<00:01:57.860> always<00:01:58.040> want

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:58.370 
people want to BRD and they always want

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:00.970 
people want to BRD and they always want
to<00:01:58.430> throw<00:01:58.670> on<00:01:58.850> a<00:01:58.880> crazy<00:01:59.270> lash<00:01:59.600> or<00:02:00.050> a<00:02:00.110> funky

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:00.980 
to throw on a crazy lash or a funky

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
so many jobs that I think I would be

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:21.460 
so many jobs that I think I would be
perfect<00:04:18.919> for<00:04:19.070> that<00:04:19.130> I<00:04:19.549> don't<00:04:19.729> get<00:04:20.090> to<00:04:21.049> maintain

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
perfect for that I don't get to maintain

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.840 
perfect for that I don't get to maintain
a<00:04:22.400> positive<00:04:23.620> perspective<00:04:24.620> on<00:04:25.070> and<00:04:25.340> that's

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 
a positive perspective on and that's

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:27.610 
a positive perspective on and that's
really<00:04:26.090> what<00:04:26.510> it<00:04:26.600> comes<00:04:26.630> down<00:04:26.900> to<00:04:27.020> sometimes

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
really what it comes down to sometimes

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.400 
really what it comes down to sometimes
is<00:04:27.889> not<00:04:27.970> not<00:04:28.970> even<00:04:29.000> just<00:04:29.449> the<00:04:29.600> artistry<00:04:30.169> but

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:30.410 
is not not even just the artistry but

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:32.080 
is not not even just the artistry but
the<00:04:30.560> personality<00:04:31.220> I<00:04:31.250> need<00:04:31.580> to<00:04:31.699> be<00:04:31.789> with<00:04:31.910> people

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:32.090 
the personality I need to be with people

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:35.260 
the personality I need to be with people
that<00:04:32.419> I<00:04:32.479> can<00:04:32.600> work<00:04:32.900> with<00:04:32.960> for<00:04:33.289> 20<00:04:33.560> hours<00:04:33.820> no<00:04:34.820> and

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:35.270 
that I can work with for 20 hours no and

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.689 
that I can work with for 20 hours no and
I<00:04:35.990> don't<00:04:36.440> think<00:04:36.740> you<00:04:36.830> can<00:04:36.949> make<00:04:37.100> it<00:04:37.250> personal<00:04:37.669> I

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:37.699 
I don't think you can make it personal I

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:39.189 
I don't think you can make it personal I
think<00:04:37.910> it<00:04:38.030> is<00:04:38.150> still<00:04:38.300> a<00:04:38.360> business<00:04:38.600> and<00:04:39.110> you've

00:04:39.189 --> 00:04:39.199 
think it is still a business and you've

00:04:39.199 --> 00:04:42.280 
think it is still a business and you've
got<00:04:39.380> to<00:04:39.470> look<00:04:39.590> at<00:04:39.740> it<00:04:39.919> that<00:04:40.070> way
