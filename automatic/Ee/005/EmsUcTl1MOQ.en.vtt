hey<00:00:01.410> youtubers<00:00:01.949> this<00:00:02.100> is<00:00:02.159> cube<00:00:02.490> addict<00:00:02.790> and

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:03.000 
hey youtubers this is cube addict and

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.180 
hey youtubers this is cube addict and
this<00:00:03.360> is<00:00:03.510> my<00:00:03.689> tutorial<00:00:04.049> on<00:00:04.440> the<00:00:04.620> keyhole

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
this is my tutorial on the keyhole

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.839 
this is my tutorial on the keyhole
method<00:00:05.690> now<00:00:06.690> this<00:00:07.140> method<00:00:07.529> is<00:00:07.649> not<00:00:08.010> highly

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
method now this method is not highly

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.780 
method now this method is not highly
known<00:00:09.290> but<00:00:10.290> it<00:00:10.500> is<00:00:10.679> good<00:00:11.010> for<00:00:11.280> those<00:00:11.400> who<00:00:11.460> are

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
known but it is good for those who are

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.539 
known but it is good for those who are
learning<00:00:12.690> the<00:00:13.139> advanced<00:00:13.799> methods<00:00:14.280> for

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
learning the advanced methods for

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.960 
learning the advanced methods for
solving<00:00:14.880> a<00:00:15.150> Rubik's<00:00:15.420> Cube<00:00:15.509> for<00:00:15.960> speed<00:00:16.440> cubing

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:16.970 
solving a Rubik's Cube for speed cubing

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.269 
solving a Rubik's Cube for speed cubing
now<00:00:17.970> the<00:00:18.900> reason<00:00:19.140> why<00:00:19.230> this<00:00:19.289> method<00:00:19.560> is<00:00:19.980> not

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
now the reason why this method is not

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.279 
now the reason why this method is not
highly<00:00:20.699> known<00:00:20.910> is<00:00:21.150> because<00:00:21.510> most<00:00:21.840> people<00:00:22.140> just

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
highly known is because most people just

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:23.990 
highly known is because most people just
go<00:00:22.470> straight<00:00:22.830> from<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.160> beginners<00:00:23.550> method<00:00:23.730> to

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:24.000 
go straight from the beginners method to

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.310 
go straight from the beginners method to
f2l<00:00:24.480> PLL's<00:00:25.050> and<00:00:25.230> olls<00:00:25.590> but<00:00:26.519> this<00:00:26.670> is<00:00:26.849> a<00:00:26.880> good

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:27.320 
f2l PLL's and olls but this is a good

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.669 
f2l PLL's and olls but this is a good
good<00:00:28.320> transition<00:00:28.980> good<00:00:29.250> way<00:00:29.429> to<00:00:29.490> get<00:00:30.480> started

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:30.679 
good transition good way to get started

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:33.080 
good transition good way to get started
understanding<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.769> f2l<00:00:32.309> while<00:00:32.910> you're

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
understanding the f2l while you're

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.470 
understanding the f2l while you're
trying<00:00:33.420> to<00:00:33.630> learn<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.440> f2l<00:00:34.829> and<00:00:35.360> there<00:00:36.360> are<00:00:36.450> a

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
trying to learn the f2l and there are a

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.030 
trying to learn the f2l and there are a
lot<00:00:36.540> of<00:00:36.719> algorithms<00:00:36.930> that<00:00:37.140> you<00:00:37.290> can<00:00:37.440> do<00:00:37.559> but<00:00:37.860> I

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
lot of algorithms that you can do but I

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.260 
lot of algorithms that you can do but I
like<00:00:38.160> to<00:00:38.280> do<00:00:38.399> this<00:00:38.520> intuitively<00:00:39.149> and<00:00:41.120> this<00:00:42.120> is

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
like to do this intuitively and this is

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.700 
like to do this intuitively and this is
a<00:00:42.300> very<00:00:42.660> very<00:00:42.899> good<00:00:43.079> method<00:00:43.350> that<00:00:43.469> I<00:00:43.500> show<00:00:43.680> a

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
a very very good method that I show a

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:44.690 
a very very good method that I show a
lot<00:00:43.860> of<00:00:43.890> people<00:00:44.129> that<00:00:44.219> are<00:00:44.309> wanting<00:00:44.520> to<00:00:44.610> get

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
lot of people that are wanting to get

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.690 
lot of people that are wanting to get
better<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.590> but<00:00:46.590> they're<00:00:46.739> not<00:00:46.890> fully<00:00:47.219> able<00:00:47.399> to

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
better and but they're not fully able to

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.000 
better and but they're not fully able to
understand<00:00:48.329> the<00:00:48.420> f2l<00:00:48.840> so<00:00:49.440> this<00:00:49.590> is<00:00:49.710> a<00:00:49.739> good<00:00:49.860> way

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
understand the f2l so this is a good way

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.490 
understand the f2l so this is a good way
to<00:00:50.039> learn<00:00:50.309> and<00:00:50.610> to<00:00:51.000> kind<00:00:51.719> of<00:00:51.780> get<00:00:51.870> started<00:00:52.260> now

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
to learn and to kind of get started now

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.650 
to learn and to kind of get started now
if<00:00:52.590> you<00:00:52.680> don't<00:00:52.770> know<00:00:52.890> what<00:00:53.010> f2l<00:00:53.309> is<00:00:53.460> f2l<00:00:54.420> is

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
if you don't know what f2l is f2l is

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.830 
if you don't know what f2l is f2l is
solving<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:56.489> two<00:00:56.910> layers<00:00:57.120> at<00:00:57.360> the<00:00:57.390> same<00:00:57.480> time

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:57.840 
solving the two layers at the same time

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.709 
solving the two layers at the same time
like<00:00:58.440> these<00:00:58.680> two<00:00:58.859> pieces<00:00:59.219> I<00:00:59.520> just<00:01:00.120> solve<00:01:00.300> both

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
like these two pieces I just solve both

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:04.369 
like these two pieces I just solve both
of<00:01:00.870> them<00:01:00.960> at<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.109> same<00:01:01.260> time<00:01:01.699> so<00:01:03.199> that's<00:01:04.199> just

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
of them at the same time so that's just

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.760 
of them at the same time so that's just
that's<00:01:04.680> a<00:01:04.890> that<00:01:05.369> was<00:01:05.519> a<00:01:05.549> setup<00:01:05.790> move<00:01:06.030> so<00:01:06.270> but

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:06.770 
that's a that was a setup move so but

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.390 
that's a that was a setup move so but
anyway<00:01:07.770> what<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:09.920> what<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.130> normal

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
anyway what the what the normal

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.770 
anyway what the what the normal
beginners<00:01:11.729> method<00:01:12.000> requires<00:01:12.299> as<00:01:12.510> you<00:01:12.600> solve

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
beginners method requires as you solve

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.060 
beginners method requires as you solve
the<00:01:12.900> cross<00:01:13.110> and<00:01:13.290> then<00:01:13.409> you<00:01:13.470> solve<00:01:13.650> the<00:01:13.799> corner

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
the cross and then you solve the corner

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.670 
the cross and then you solve the corner
pieces<00:01:14.450> now<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.509> keyhole<00:01:16.020> method<00:01:16.290> is<00:01:16.409> a<00:01:16.439> cross

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
pieces now the keyhole method is a cross

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.550 
pieces now the keyhole method is a cross
between<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.100> two<00:01:17.340> where<00:01:18.090> you<00:01:18.390> do<00:01:18.780> kind<00:01:19.530> of

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
between the two where you do kind of

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.160 
between the two where you do kind of
both<00:01:19.830> at<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.549> same<00:01:20.729> time<00:01:20.810> and<00:01:21.810> what<00:01:21.930> I<00:01:21.960> mean<00:01:22.110> by

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
both at the same time and what I mean by

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.840 
both at the same time and what I mean by
that<00:01:22.320> is<00:01:22.680> I'm<00:01:23.220> just<00:01:23.280> going<00:01:23.549> to<00:01:23.580> take<00:01:23.759> this

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
that is I'm just going to take this

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.090 
that is I'm just going to take this
piece<00:01:24.060> out<00:01:24.210> is<00:01:24.420> you<00:01:25.020> have<00:01:25.200> a<00:01:25.229> thing<00:01:25.680> called<00:01:25.710> a

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
piece out is you have a thing called a

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.590 
piece out is you have a thing called a
keyhole<00:01:26.700> which<00:01:26.909> is<00:01:27.060> one<00:01:27.210> of<00:01:27.299> our<00:01:27.390> corner

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
keyhole which is one of our corner

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.840 
keyhole which is one of our corner
pieces<00:01:27.930> that<00:01:28.049> we<00:01:28.140> don't<00:01:28.439> stick<00:01:28.710> in<00:01:28.920> so<00:01:29.729> when

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
pieces that we don't stick in so when

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.039 
pieces that we don't stick in so when
you're<00:01:29.970> solving<00:01:30.090> to<00:01:30.299> keep<00:01:30.479> you<00:01:30.600> don't<00:01:30.810> stick

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
you're solving to keep you don't stick

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.050 
you're solving to keep you don't stick
you<00:01:31.500> leave<00:01:31.950> a<00:01:31.979> corner<00:01:32.280> piece<00:01:32.400> out<00:01:32.640> and<00:01:32.670> I'll

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
you leave a corner piece out and I'll

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.780 
you leave a corner piece out and I'll
show<00:01:33.090> you<00:01:33.240> why<00:01:33.479> here<00:01:33.509> in<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.869> sec<00:01:34.159> but<00:01:35.159> we<00:01:35.610> have

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
show you why here in a sec but we have

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.490 
show you why here in a sec but we have
all<00:01:36.119> these<00:01:36.329> different<00:01:36.479> edge<00:01:36.810> pieces<00:01:37.140> that<00:01:37.380> are

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
all these different edge pieces that are

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.840 
all these different edge pieces that are
missing<00:01:37.650> now<00:01:38.900> what<00:01:39.900> we<00:01:40.020> would<00:01:40.110> normally<00:01:40.229> do<00:01:40.590> is

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
missing now what we would normally do is

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.210 
missing now what we would normally do is
we<00:01:41.850> would<00:01:41.970> have<00:01:42.150> this<00:01:42.360> orange<00:01:43.140> of<00:01:43.259> green<00:01:43.470> we'd

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
we would have this orange of green we'd

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.859 
we would have this orange of green we'd
have<00:01:44.430> it<00:01:44.520> right<00:01:44.610> here<00:01:44.970> this<00:01:45.479> will<00:01:45.630> take<00:01:45.750> about

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
have it right here this will take about

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.389 
have it right here this will take about
six<00:01:46.229> to<00:01:46.409> eight<00:01:46.439> moves<00:01:46.740> this<00:01:46.950> one<00:01:47.159> in

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
six to eight moves this one in

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:48.499 
six to eight moves this one in
particular<00:01:47.790> is<00:01:47.850> gonna<00:01:47.970> take<00:01:48.090> eight<00:01:48.240> minutes

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
particular is gonna take eight minutes

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:52.639 
particular is gonna take eight minutes
I've<00:01:48.600> got<00:01:48.750> one<00:01:49.020> two<00:01:49.680> three<00:01:50.009> four<00:01:50.990> five<00:01:51.990> six

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
I've got one two three four five six

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.429 
I've got one two three four five six
seven<00:01:53.369> eight

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:54.439 
seven eight

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:56.899 
seven eight
took<00:01:55.439> me<00:01:55.619> six<00:01:55.649> moves<00:01:56.040> to<00:01:56.250> get<00:01:56.369> that<00:01:56.549> piece<00:01:56.729> in

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
took me six moves to get that piece in

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.590 
took me six moves to get that piece in
there<00:01:57.090> and<00:01:57.590> just<00:01:58.590> it's<00:01:59.219> a<00:01:59.549> long<00:02:00.000> time<00:02:00.299> to<00:02:00.450> do

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
there and just it's a long time to do

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.770 
there and just it's a long time to do
and<00:02:00.960> it's<00:02:01.880> kind<00:02:02.880> of<00:02:02.969> gruesome<00:02:03.180> when<00:02:03.659> you're

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
and it's kind of gruesome when you're

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.990 
and it's kind of gruesome when you're
doing<00:02:04.110> that<00:02:04.200> for<00:02:04.409> every<00:02:04.740> single<00:02:04.950> side<00:02:05.670> now<00:02:05.880> if

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
doing that for every single side now if

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.069 
doing that for every single side now if
you're<00:02:06.119> not<00:02:06.210> getting<00:02:06.509> it<00:02:06.600> a<00:02:06.659> speedcubing

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
you're not getting it a speedcubing

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.130 
you're not getting it a speedcubing
that's<00:02:07.229> not<00:02:07.439> required<00:02:07.829> but<00:02:08.479> when<00:02:09.479> you<00:02:09.599> are<00:02:09.840> and

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
that's not required but when you are and

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.770 
that's not required but when you are and
trying<00:02:10.619> to<00:02:10.770> get<00:02:11.220> faster<00:02:11.640> that<00:02:12.030> takes<00:02:12.239> up<00:02:12.390> a<00:02:12.480> lot

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
trying to get faster that takes up a lot

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.460 
trying to get faster that takes up a lot
of

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:13.470 
of

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:14.900 
of
so<00:02:13.950> I'm<00:02:14.010> going<00:02:14.160> to<00:02:14.220> show<00:02:14.310> you<00:02:14.370> a<00:02:14.460> little<00:02:14.670> method

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
so I'm going to show you a little method

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.970 
so I'm going to show you a little method
that<00:02:15.300> will<00:02:15.600> help<00:02:16.020> speed<00:02:16.350> that<00:02:16.500> up<00:02:16.530> if<00:02:16.920> you

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
that will help speed that up if you

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.850 
that will help speed that up if you
don't<00:02:17.190> know<00:02:17.340> f2l<00:02:17.820> yet<00:02:18.170> so<00:02:19.170> like<00:02:19.470> I<00:02:19.590> said<00:02:19.770> with

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
don't know f2l yet so like I said with

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.190 
don't know f2l yet so like I said with
the<00:02:19.950> keyhole<00:02:20.160> method<00:02:20.750> we<00:02:21.750> leave<00:02:21.900> a<00:02:21.930> corner

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
the keyhole method we leave a corner

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.230 
the keyhole method we leave a corner
piece<00:02:22.320> out<00:02:22.560> what<00:02:23.280> we<00:02:23.370> want<00:02:23.580> to<00:02:23.640> do<00:02:23.730> is<00:02:24.000> whatever

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:24.240 
piece out what we want to do is whatever

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.210 
piece out what we want to do is whatever
edge<00:02:24.540> piece<00:02:24.780> we're<00:02:24.930> wanting<00:02:25.110> to<00:02:25.200> fix<00:02:25.410> you<00:02:26.100> know

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
edge piece we're wanting to fix you know

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.440 
edge piece we're wanting to fix you know
how<00:02:26.370> we're<00:02:26.520> normally<00:02:26.850> line<00:02:27.000> up<00:02:27.150> the<00:02:27.300> edge

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
how we're normally line up the edge

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:30.200 
how we're normally line up the edge
piece<00:02:27.660> right<00:02:27.810> here<00:02:27.870> we<00:02:28.740> actually<00:02:29.060> that's<00:02:30.060> the

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
piece right here we actually that's the

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:31.730 
piece right here we actually that's the
edge<00:02:30.330> piece<00:02:30.570> that<00:02:30.690> we<00:02:30.750> need<00:02:30.870> to<00:02:30.930> fix<00:02:31.170> so<00:02:31.620> we

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
edge piece that we need to fix so we

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:35.180 
edge piece that we need to fix so we
stick<00:02:31.920> that<00:02:32.070> keyhole<00:02:32.460> right<00:02:32.940> under<00:02:33.210> it<00:02:34.190> now

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
stick that keyhole right under it now

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.770 
stick that keyhole right under it now
instead<00:02:35.460> of<00:02:35.520> doing<00:02:35.700> that<00:02:35.820> long<00:02:36.150> algorithm

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
instead of doing that long algorithm

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.630 
instead of doing that long algorithm
that<00:02:36.930> I<00:02:36.960> just<00:02:37.170> showed<00:02:37.290> you<00:02:37.370> you've<00:02:38.370> got<00:02:38.610> a

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
that I just showed you you've got a

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.640 
that I just showed you you've got a
simple<00:02:39.090> move<00:02:39.360> that<00:02:39.510> you<00:02:39.570> can<00:02:39.720> do<00:02:39.810> you<00:02:40.440> line

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
simple move that you can do you line

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.730 
simple move that you can do you line
this<00:02:40.800> up<00:02:40.980> here<00:02:41.750> bring<00:02:42.750> it<00:02:42.840> down<00:02:43.430> pull<00:02:44.430> back<00:02:44.610> up

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:45.740 
this up here bring it down pull back up

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:49.190 
this up here bring it down pull back up
and<00:02:46.740> bring<00:02:47.370> this<00:02:47.490> back<00:02:47.700> where<00:02:47.910> it<00:02:47.970> was<00:02:48.000> as<00:02:48.360> you

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
and bring this back where it was as you

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.710 
and bring this back where it was as you
can<00:02:49.410> see<00:02:49.620> now<00:02:50.040> if<00:02:50.160> I<00:02:50.280> it<00:02:51.090> doesn't<00:02:51.330> look<00:02:51.420> fixed

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
can see now if I it doesn't look fixed

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.930 
can see now if I it doesn't look fixed
because<00:02:51.900> I<00:02:52.590> don't<00:02:53.310> have<00:02:53.400> my<00:02:53.520> key<00:02:53.700> hole<00:02:53.820> in<00:02:53.880> the

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
because I don't have my key hole in the

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.970 
because I don't have my key hole in the
right<00:02:54.030> spot<00:02:54.270> so<00:02:54.480> I<00:02:54.900> flip<00:02:55.080> it<00:02:55.170> put<00:02:55.470> it<00:02:55.860> back

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
right spot so I flip it put it back

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.020 
right spot so I flip it put it back
where<00:02:56.160> it<00:02:56.190> was<00:02:56.340> and<00:02:56.550> put<00:02:56.640> that<00:02:56.790> corner<00:02:57.000> piece

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
where it was and put that corner piece

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.180 
where it was and put that corner piece
where<00:02:57.300> it<00:02:57.390> originally<00:02:57.750> was<00:02:57.870> you<00:02:58.710> can<00:02:58.860> see<00:02:58.890> that

00:02:59.180 --> 00:02:59.190 
where it originally was you can see that

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:01.790 
where it originally was you can see that
it<00:02:59.310> lined<00:02:59.610> up<00:02:59.790> now<00:03:00.630> that<00:03:00.810> takes<00:03:01.020> four<00:03:01.560> moves

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
it lined up now that takes four moves

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.570 
it lined up now that takes four moves
instead<00:03:02.430> of<00:03:02.520> the<00:03:02.640> usual<00:03:03.380> six<00:03:04.380> to<00:03:04.590> eight<00:03:04.740> so

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
instead of the usual six to eight so

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.910 
instead of the usual six to eight so
you're<00:03:05.760> cutting<00:03:06.060> up<00:03:06.240> your<00:03:06.740> algorithms<00:03:07.740> by

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
you're cutting up your algorithms by

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.640 
you're cutting up your algorithms by
half<00:03:08.310> so<00:03:09.150> to<00:03:09.210> speak<00:03:09.450> so<00:03:10.140> let's<00:03:10.260> do<00:03:10.350> another<00:03:10.470> one

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
half so to speak so let's do another one

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:11.870 
half so to speak so let's do another one
real<00:03:10.830> quick<00:03:10.860> we've<00:03:11.100> got<00:03:11.220> this<00:03:11.340> orange<00:03:11.700> and

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
real quick we've got this orange and

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.680 
real quick we've got this orange and
green<00:03:12.060> or<00:03:12.360> orange<00:03:12.660> and<00:03:12.930> blue<00:03:13.080> I<00:03:13.370> have<00:03:14.370> to<00:03:14.690> take

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
green or orange and blue I have to take

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.680 
green or orange and blue I have to take
my<00:03:15.870> corner<00:03:16.620> piece<00:03:16.800> that's<00:03:17.190> the<00:03:17.400> keyhole<00:03:17.790> stick

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
my corner piece that's the keyhole stick

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.600 
my corner piece that's the keyhole stick
it<00:03:18.780> right<00:03:18.810> here<00:03:18.980> I'll<00:03:19.980> show<00:03:20.130> you<00:03:20.190> what<00:03:20.340> happens

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
it right here I'll show you what happens

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:23.120 
it right here I'll show you what happens
if<00:03:20.640> I<00:03:20.760> do<00:03:20.820> it<00:03:20.970> with<00:03:21.120> without<00:03:21.570> it<00:03:21.870> I<00:03:22.050> do<00:03:22.650> it<00:03:22.770> here

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
if I do it with without it I do it here

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:28.280 
if I do it with without it I do it here
and<00:03:23.250> go<00:03:23.400> down<00:03:24.239> down<00:03:25.230> up<00:03:25.680> up<00:03:26.720> then<00:03:27.720> I've<00:03:28.110> got

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
and go down down up up then I've got

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.050 
and go down down up up then I've got
this<00:03:28.440> piece<00:03:28.709> in<00:03:28.860> the<00:03:28.890> right<00:03:29.070> spot<00:03:29.370> but<00:03:29.790> I<00:03:29.820> mess

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
this piece in the right spot but I mess

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.660 
this piece in the right spot but I mess
up<00:03:30.239> this<00:03:30.480> piece<00:03:30.750> right<00:03:30.900> here<00:03:30.989> I<00:03:31.410> don't<00:03:32.340> want<00:03:32.610> to

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:32.670 
up this piece right here I don't want to

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.670 
up this piece right here I don't want to
do<00:03:32.760> that<00:03:32.940> I<00:03:33.180> want<00:03:33.510> to<00:03:33.570> be<00:03:33.750> able<00:03:33.840> to<00:03:34.050> stick<00:03:34.470> it<00:03:34.590> in

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
do that I want to be able to stick it in

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.330 
do that I want to be able to stick it in
correctly<00:03:35.360> so<00:03:36.360> we'll<00:03:37.080> try<00:03:37.230> that<00:03:37.260> again<00:03:37.470> I'm

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
correctly so we'll try that again I'm

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:39.470 
correctly so we'll try that again I'm
going<00:03:38.520> to<00:03:38.580> stick<00:03:38.700> this<00:03:38.820> piece<00:03:38.880> all<00:03:39.300> the<00:03:39.420> way

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:39.480 
going to stick this piece all the way

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:41.630 
going to stick this piece all the way
over<00:03:39.750> here<00:03:40.140> under<00:03:40.560> the<00:03:40.709> piece<00:03:41.220> that<00:03:41.310> needs<00:03:41.520> to

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
over here under the piece that needs to

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.050 
over here under the piece that needs to
be<00:03:41.930> got<00:03:42.930> this<00:03:43.080> piece<00:03:43.290> here<00:03:43.560> so<00:03:43.709> I<00:03:43.800> go<00:03:43.950> down<00:03:44.160> down

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
be got this piece here so I go down down

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.880 
be got this piece here so I go down down
up

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:48.890 

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:51.440 

bring<00:03:49.890> the<00:03:50.040> bottom<00:03:50.820> piece<00:03:50.940> back<00:03:51.150> where<00:03:51.360> it<00:03:51.420> was

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
bring the bottom piece back where it was

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.490 
bring the bottom piece back where it was
there<00:03:52.290> you<00:03:52.410> go<00:03:52.760> so<00:03:53.900> but<00:03:54.900> it's<00:03:54.989> really<00:03:55.230> good

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
there you go so but it's really good

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.660 
there you go so but it's really good
it's<00:03:56.190> a<00:03:56.220> really<00:03:56.250> good<00:03:56.640> method<00:03:56.820> and<00:03:58.400> the<00:03:59.400> finger

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
it's a really good method and the finger

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.400 
it's a really good method and the finger
tricking<00:04:00.060> this<00:04:00.660> also<00:04:00.810> helps<00:04:01.080> you<00:04:01.140> with<00:04:01.320> a

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
tricking this also helps you with a

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.410 
tricking this also helps you with a
little<00:04:01.500> bit<00:04:01.590> of<00:04:01.680> finger<00:04:01.920> moving<00:04:02.300> because<00:04:03.300> you

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:03.420 
little bit of finger moving because you

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:05.510 
little bit of finger moving because you
just<00:04:04.200> do<00:04:04.350> this<00:04:04.470> rotation<00:04:04.890> here<00:04:05.190> and<00:04:05.340> then<00:04:05.430> you

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:05.520 
just do this rotation here and then you

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:10.130 
just do this rotation here and then you
do<00:04:05.640> this<00:04:06.050> so<00:04:07.430> if<00:04:08.430> you<00:04:09.150> look<00:04:09.360> at<00:04:09.480> this<00:04:09.720> direction

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
do this so if you look at this direction

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.910 
do this so if you look at this direction
because<00:04:10.709> this<00:04:10.860> is<00:04:10.950> where<00:04:11.070> you<00:04:11.130> want<00:04:11.280> it<00:04:11.370> or<00:04:12.920> Wow

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
because this is where you want it or Wow

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:15.159 
because this is where you want it or Wow
okay<00:04:14.340> there<00:04:14.730> we<00:04:14.820> go

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:15.169 
okay there we go

00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:17.270 
okay there we go
since<00:04:16.169> we're<00:04:16.290> trying<00:04:16.470> to<00:04:16.560> fix<00:04:16.709> in<00:04:16.859> this<00:04:17.010> piece

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
since we're trying to fix in this piece

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.960 
since we're trying to fix in this piece
right<00:04:17.430> here<00:04:17.750> we'll<00:04:18.750> have<00:04:18.959> if<00:04:19.320> it's<00:04:19.730> if<00:04:20.730> it's<00:04:20.820> on

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
right here we'll have if it's if it's on

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.840 
right here we'll have if it's if it's on
our<00:04:21.000> left<00:04:21.330> we<00:04:21.750> go<00:04:21.870> left<00:04:22.080> down<00:04:22.340> it's<00:04:23.340> on<00:04:23.490> a<00:04:23.640> riot

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
our left we go left down it's on a riot

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:26.000 
our left we go left down it's on a riot
if<00:04:24.120> we<00:04:24.330> if<00:04:24.750> we<00:04:24.810> had<00:04:25.020> to<00:04:25.110> stick<00:04:25.260> it<00:04:25.350> in<00:04:25.470> if<00:04:25.919> this

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
if we if we had to stick it in if this

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.969 
if we if we had to stick it in if this
were

00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:26.979 
were

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:28.740 
were
then<00:04:27.550> we<00:04:27.910> were<00:04:28.000> doing<00:04:28.180> on<00:04:28.270> this<00:04:28.360> side<00:04:28.419> but

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
then we were doing on this side but

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.159 
then we were doing on this side but
we're<00:04:28.870> not<00:04:28.960> going<00:04:29.199> to<00:04:29.259> we're<00:04:29.470> going<00:04:29.500> to<00:04:29.620> do<00:04:29.770> so

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:31.169 
we're not going to we're going to do so

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:40.770 
we're not going to we're going to do so
l<00:04:33.090> F<00:04:34.090> prime<00:04:34.889> L<00:04:35.889> prime<00:04:36.250> F<00:04:38.699> there's<00:04:39.699> a<00:04:39.789> piece<00:04:40.090> just

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:40.780 
l F prime L prime F there's a piece just

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:45.629 
l F prime L prime F there's a piece just
slide<00:04:41.020> it<00:04:41.110> right<00:04:41.139> in<00:04:42.960> and<00:04:44.069> from<00:04:45.069> there<00:04:45.250> we'll

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:45.639 
slide it right in and from there we'll

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:49.439 
slide it right in and from there we'll
just<00:04:46.620> solve<00:04:47.620> the<00:04:48.060> corner<00:04:49.060> piece<00:04:49.210> like<00:04:49.360> we

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:49.449 
just solve the corner piece like we

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:52.860 
just solve the corner piece like we
normally<00:04:49.599> would<00:04:49.810> and<00:04:50.169> then<00:04:50.380> just<00:04:51.569> match<00:04:52.569> the<00:04:52.780> F

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
normally would and then just match the F

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:56.909 
normally would and then just match the F
to<00:04:53.050> L<00:04:53.520> so<00:04:54.520> or<00:04:54.789> the<00:04:55.000> edge<00:04:55.660> piece<00:04:55.960> then<00:04:56.740> you<00:04:56.770> could

00:04:56.909 --> 00:04:56.919 
to L so or the edge piece then you could

00:04:56.919 --> 00:04:59.550 
to L so or the edge piece then you could
just<00:04:56.949> solve<00:04:57.190> the<00:04:57.340> cube<00:04:57.520> regularly<00:04:58.470> let's<00:04:59.470> go

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
just solve the cube regularly let's go

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.020 
just solve the cube regularly let's go
ahead<00:04:59.680> and<00:04:59.830> just<00:04:59.919> do<00:05:00.070> one<00:05:00.280> more<00:05:00.310> just<00:05:00.820> so<00:05:00.940> you

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:01.030 
ahead and just do one more just so you

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:06.300 
ahead and just do one more just so you
guys<00:05:01.150> can<00:05:01.210> see<00:05:02.009> the<00:05:03.009> way<00:05:03.130> it<00:05:03.220> works<00:05:03.630> so<00:05:05.310> I've

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:06.310 
guys can see the way it works so I've

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:15.990 
guys can see the way it works so I've
got<00:05:06.580> my<00:05:09.810> cross<00:05:10.810> here<00:05:11.380> and<00:05:14.250> then<00:05:15.250> what<00:05:15.729> we<00:05:15.820> want

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:16.000 
got my cross here and then what we want

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.969 
got my cross here and then what we want
to<00:05:16.090> do<00:05:16.150> here<00:05:16.479> is<00:05:16.539> we<00:05:16.750> want<00:05:16.870> to<00:05:16.990> try<00:05:17.139> to<00:05:17.169> line<00:05:17.830> up

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:17.979 
to do here is we want to try to line up

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:24.689 
to do here is we want to try to line up
all<00:05:18.159> the<00:05:21.150> corners<00:05:22.150> now<00:05:23.340> again<00:05:24.340> we<00:05:24.490> want<00:05:24.639> to

00:05:24.689 --> 00:05:24.699 
all the corners now again we want to

00:05:24.699 --> 00:05:27.029 
all the corners now again we want to
make<00:05:24.789> sure<00:05:24.940> we<00:05:25.060> don't<00:05:25.180> put<00:05:25.539> one<00:05:26.349> in<00:05:26.530> and<00:05:26.949> we

00:05:27.029 --> 00:05:27.039 
make sure we don't put one in and we

00:05:27.039 --> 00:05:28.980 
make sure we don't put one in and we
want<00:05:27.250> to<00:05:27.310> just<00:05:27.539> go<00:05:28.539> ahead<00:05:28.630> and<00:05:28.810> start<00:05:28.960> doing

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:28.990 
want to just go ahead and start doing

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:30.600 
want to just go ahead and start doing
the<00:05:29.169> other<00:05:29.289> pieces<00:05:29.530> now<00:05:29.770> I<00:05:29.800> notice<00:05:30.159> that<00:05:30.310> I've

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:30.610 
the other pieces now I notice that I've

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:32.520 
the other pieces now I notice that I've
already<00:05:30.849> solved<00:05:31.090> this<00:05:31.180> one<00:05:31.449> so<00:05:32.289> I'm<00:05:32.349> going<00:05:32.500> to

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:32.530 
already solved this one so I'm going to

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:36.089 
already solved this one so I'm going to
go<00:05:32.620> ahead<00:05:32.740> and<00:05:32.919> move<00:05:32.979> on<00:05:33.159> to<00:05:33.370> this<00:05:33.849> one<00:05:35.099> and

00:05:36.089 --> 00:05:36.099 
go ahead and move on to this one and

00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:39.659 
go ahead and move on to this one and
there's<00:05:36.340> my<00:05:36.810> edge<00:05:38.130> so<00:05:39.130> I'm<00:05:39.220> going<00:05:39.400> to<00:05:39.460> move<00:05:39.550> it

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:39.669 
there's my edge so I'm going to move it

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:43.499 
there's my edge so I'm going to move it
right<00:05:39.789> here<00:05:41.400> then<00:05:42.400> I've<00:05:42.520> got<00:05:42.759> I<00:05:43.030> know<00:05:43.300> that

00:05:43.499 --> 00:05:43.509 
right here then I've got I know that

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:44.670 
right here then I've got I know that
it's<00:05:43.780> going<00:05:43.930> to<00:05:43.990> be<00:05:44.050> on<00:05:44.110> my<00:05:44.169> right<00:05:44.289> side<00:05:44.530> so

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:44.680 
it's going to be on my right side so

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:49.730 
it's going to be on my right side so
it's<00:05:44.830> going<00:05:44.979> to<00:05:45.039> be<00:05:45.099> our<00:05:45.520> prime<00:05:45.849> F<00:05:46.509> our<00:05:47.380> F<00:05:48.280> Prime

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.740 
it's going to be our prime F our F Prime

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:53.010 
it's going to be our prime F our F Prime
there<00:05:50.740> it's<00:05:50.889> matched<00:05:51.180> spin<00:05:52.180> my<00:05:52.330> keyhole<00:05:52.870> back

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:53.020 
there it's matched spin my keyhole back

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:53.659 
there it's matched spin my keyhole back
where<00:05:53.289> it<00:05:53.349> was

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:53.669 
where it was

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:56.070 
where it was
then<00:05:54.669> look<00:05:54.849> for<00:05:55.000> my<00:05:55.090> next<00:05:55.330> one<00:05:55.599> it's<00:05:55.930> already

00:05:56.070 --> 00:05:56.080 
then look for my next one it's already

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:57.629 
then look for my next one it's already
in<00:05:56.259> place<00:05:56.560> it<00:05:56.770> needs<00:05:56.889> to<00:05:56.979> be<00:05:57.070> right<00:05:57.219> here<00:05:57.460> so

00:05:57.629 --> 00:05:57.639 
in place it needs to be right here so

00:05:57.639 --> 00:06:00.839 
in place it needs to be right here so
I'm<00:05:57.699> going<00:05:57.820> to<00:05:57.880> slide<00:05:58.060> it<00:05:58.210> in<00:05:59.610> I'm<00:06:00.610> going<00:06:00.789> to

00:06:00.839 --> 00:06:00.849 
I'm going to slide it in I'm going to

00:06:00.849 --> 00:06:03.959 
I'm going to slide it in I'm going to
come<00:06:01.000> in<00:06:02.430> bring<00:06:03.430> it<00:06:03.490> back

00:06:03.959 --> 00:06:03.969 
come in bring it back

00:06:03.969 --> 00:06:05.909 
come in bring it back
now<00:06:04.840> one<00:06:04.990> thing<00:06:05.139> on<00:06:05.259> what<00:06:05.349> you<00:06:05.469> know<00:06:05.620> is<00:06:05.830> that

00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:05.919 
now one thing on what you know is that

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:08.100 
now one thing on what you know is that
you<00:06:06.039> cannot<00:06:06.430> do<00:06:06.610> this<00:06:06.789> part<00:06:07.090> if<00:06:07.360> I<00:06:07.479> did<00:06:07.659> this<00:06:07.870> if

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:08.110 
you cannot do this part if I did this if

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:10.189 
you cannot do this part if I did this if
I<00:06:08.289> did<00:06:08.440> that<00:06:08.560> with<00:06:09.070> this<00:06:09.190> side<00:06:09.490> right<00:06:09.699> here

00:06:10.189 --> 00:06:10.199 
I did that with this side right here

00:06:10.199 --> 00:06:12.839 
I did that with this side right here
it's<00:06:11.199> in<00:06:11.320> the<00:06:11.380> right<00:06:11.530> spot<00:06:11.800> but<00:06:12.070> I<00:06:12.460> mean<00:06:12.669> I

00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:12.849 
it's in the right spot but I mean I

00:06:12.849 --> 00:06:15.749 
it's in the right spot but I mean I
can't<00:06:13.210> get<00:06:13.360> that<00:06:13.539> corner<00:06:13.900> fixed<00:06:14.289> I<00:06:14.669> need<00:06:15.669> to

00:06:15.749 --> 00:06:15.759 
can't get that corner fixed I need to

00:06:15.759 --> 00:06:17.730 
can't get that corner fixed I need to
make<00:06:15.909> sure<00:06:16.030> that<00:06:16.180> my<00:06:16.330> like<00:06:17.050> corners<00:06:17.469> in<00:06:17.590> there

00:06:17.730 --> 00:06:17.740 
make sure that my like corners in there

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:20.550 
make sure that my like corners in there
as<00:06:17.830> well<00:06:18.039> so<00:06:18.810> you<00:06:19.810> just<00:06:19.960> solved<00:06:20.199> the<00:06:20.229> corner

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:20.560 
as well so you just solved the corner

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:24.659 
as well so you just solved the corner
first<00:06:20.740> and<00:06:21.099> then<00:06:22.060> just<00:06:22.740> solve<00:06:23.740> the<00:06:23.949> edge<00:06:24.370> piece

00:06:24.659 --> 00:06:24.669 
first and then just solve the edge piece

00:06:24.669 --> 00:06:29.339 
first and then just solve the edge piece
after<00:06:25.000> that<00:06:26.009> so<00:06:27.599> well<00:06:28.599> I<00:06:28.630> hope<00:06:28.900> that<00:06:29.110> helped

00:06:29.339 --> 00:06:29.349 
after that so well I hope that helped

00:06:29.349 --> 00:06:33.110 
after that so well I hope that helped
you<00:06:29.409> out<00:06:29.669> it's<00:06:30.669> a<00:06:30.789> very<00:06:31.030> good<00:06:31.240> method<00:06:32.039> it's

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:33.120 
you out it's a very good method it's

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:36.390 
you out it's a very good method it's
it's<00:06:34.120> a<00:06:34.240> nice<00:06:34.389> transition<00:06:34.650> between<00:06:35.650> going

00:06:36.390 --> 00:06:36.400 
it's a nice transition between going

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.640 
it's a nice transition between going
from<00:06:36.520> across<00:06:36.880> to<00:06:37.120> an<00:06:37.210> f2l

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:38.650 
from across to an f2l

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:40.860 
from across to an f2l
and<00:06:39.120> you're<00:06:40.120> not<00:06:40.210> having<00:06:40.389> to<00:06:40.509> memorize

00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:40.870 
and you're not having to memorize

00:06:40.870 --> 00:06:42.659 
and you're not having to memorize
anything<00:06:41.229> it<00:06:41.500> just<00:06:41.680> it's<00:06:42.100> a<00:06:42.160> different

00:06:42.659 --> 00:06:42.669 
anything it just it's a different

00:06:42.669 --> 00:06:48.390 
anything it just it's a different
technique<00:06:43.259> so<00:06:44.259> you<00:06:45.100> just<00:06:45.310> come<00:06:45.460> in<00:06:45.580> here<00:06:47.400> and

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:48.400 
technique so you just come in here and

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.029 
technique so you just come in here and
slide<00:06:48.820> that<00:06:49.000> in<00:06:49.620> and<00:06:50.620> the<00:06:50.740> more<00:06:50.919> you

00:06:51.029 --> 00:06:51.039 
slide that in and the more you

00:06:51.039 --> 00:06:55.560 
slide that in and the more you
understand<00:06:51.490> it<00:06:51.669> the<00:06:52.630> easier<00:06:52.960> it'll<00:06:53.139> be<00:06:53.669> so<00:06:54.669> but

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:55.570 
understand it the easier it'll be so but

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:57.870 
understand it the easier it'll be so but
that's<00:06:55.960> just<00:06:56.050> going<00:06:56.229> to<00:06:56.289> be<00:06:56.410> required<00:06:56.880> some

00:06:57.870 --> 00:06:57.880 
that's just going to be required some

00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:02.100 
that's just going to be required some
actual<00:06:58.840> time<00:06:59.020> and<00:06:59.199> effort<00:06:59.440> to<00:06:59.669> figure<00:07:00.669> out<00:07:01.110> so

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:02.110 
actual time and effort to figure out so

00:07:02.110 --> 00:07:03.629 
actual time and effort to figure out so
but<00:07:02.199> anyway<00:07:02.530> I<00:07:02.710> hope<00:07:02.949> you<00:07:03.039> guys<00:07:03.160> enjoyed<00:07:03.520> this
