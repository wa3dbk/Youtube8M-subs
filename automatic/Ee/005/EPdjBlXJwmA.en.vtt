Welcome to my makeup world! I don't have to present you Zoeva products. These brushes created real sensation on blogs and in visage world.

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:26.100
I'm not suprised, because it has good price for gorgeous quality.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:43.980
Owing to House of Beauty shop, you can buy in Poland other brushes which are worth your attention. It's Nanshy from UK. They offer only vegan products.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:01:01.740
Zoeva and Nanshy brushes have really nice design. Occasionally comes out new Zoeva collection with colorful handles, for example in mint, in pink, in rose gold, etc.

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:08.800
If we want to buy Nanshy brushes, we can choose between handles in black or in white pearl.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:39.240
Every brush is clearly marked with logo and name of brush. Zoeva numbers every brush additionally. I'd like to give you advice - signatures on Nanshy brushes wear down, so fix them with colorless nail polish.

00:01:39.240 --> 00:02:02.840
Nanshy extrudes their logo on ferrule of brushes - that's why I like their products more! I think their graphic sign looks very attractive. Nanshy brushes are shorter than Zoeva.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:12.220
Bristle of both brands is squishy, delicate and subtle.

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:23.280
Eye set includes seven brushes. I'm going to talk every one over and compare with Zoeva.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:38.160
LARGE SHADER is flat, oval-shaped brush. Great to put eyeshadows on eyelid. Construction of bristle allows to do makeup without dust of eyeshadow under eye. Price: 29 PLN.

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:52.880
ZOEVA 220 LUXE GRAND SHADER - brush has the same shape as Large Shader, but it's bigger. If you have smaller eyelid, you can choose brush by Nanshy. Price: 36 PLN.

00:02:52.920 --> 00:03:06.960
BLENDING EYESHADOW - it's great for blending eyeshadows in crease. It has long, delicate and oval-shaped bristle. Price: 29 PLN.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:26.040
ZOEVA 227 LUXE SOFT DEFINER - this brush looks like Blending Eyeshadow by Nanshy. Unfortunately, single hair dropped out. Price: 32 PLN.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:39.500
EYE CREASE - it's made for putting eyeshadow into crease. It's similar to Blending Eyeshadow, but bristle is arranged in circle. Price: 29 PLN.

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:59.380
ZOEVA 224 LUXE DEFINE CREASE - has less firmed bristle, than Eye Crease. It like it more than brush by Nanshy to blend eyeshadows, but bristle also became a little bit distorted... :( Price: 32 PLN.

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:12.140
TAPERED CREASE - next brush, which serves to blend eyeshadows. It has stiff, firm, but delicate bristle. I like using it on lower eyelid or in inner corner of the eye to highlight this area. Price: 29 PLN.

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:27.360
ZOEVA 223 PETIT EYE BLINDER - it's bigger equivalent of Tapered Crease, so it's good choice for people with bigger eyes. Price: 32 PLN.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:42.680
FLAT DEFINER - flat, slightly sheared brush for eyebrows. You can also use it for gel liner. Price: 29 PLN.

00:04:42.740 --> 00:05:05.820
ZOEVA 322 BROW LINE - has shorter, more firm and placed at a greater slant bristle, than Flat Definer. Makes possible to draw single hair in eyebrow. It's my favourite brow brush! And it's cheaper, than similar brush by Nanshy - 28 PLN.

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:22.880
ANGLED DETAILER - designed for drawing winged liner or for eyebrows. I like using it on lower lashline or smudge pencil on eye. Price: 29.5 PLN

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:39.540
ZOEVA 318 SOFT PAINT LINER - has longer bristle, than Angled Detailer and it's bigger. Unluckily my specimen is unevenly sheared, so single hair stand out. Price: 28 PLN.

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:48.680
PRECISE BENT EYELINER - it's classic, tenuous brush you need to make perfect winged liner! Price: 29 PLN.

00:05:48.680 --> 00:06:01.680
ZOEVA 315 FINE LINER - it's a little bit shorter, than Precise Bent Eyeliner, but both of them are good. So it's your decision, which one would you like to buy! Price: 28 PLN.

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:22.800
Now you know price of every brush, but both brands have in their offer ready sets. You can save some money. Nanshy eye set includes 7 items and costs 157 PLN. You can buy it in House of Beauty - www.housebeauty.pl

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:34.880
The most similar to Nanshy eye set is eye set by Zoeva, which contains six brushes. Price: 152 PLN. As you can see, Nanshy brushes are cheaper and aren't worse at the same time.

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:44.600
Generally Nanshy brushes have more firmed bristle and have shorter handles. I washed them few times and look the same like at first moment.

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:52.180
I recommed them everybody - from begginers to pro. Especially good for smaller eyes.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:58.800
If you are interested, visit House of Beauty shop. You can also buy there face brushes by Nanshy.

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:19.920
So far I saw only few Polish reviews about Nanshy products. If you used this brand - tell me about it in comment. Let me know do you want to test new brand in Poland?

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:29.180
