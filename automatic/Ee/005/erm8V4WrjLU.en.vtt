00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:20.840
 healthy are you all on the ng channel for three days 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:24.859
 let's see vidos about t-54 soviet tank 

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:28.329
 Level 9 by its indestructibility it is not 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:31.610
 reminds vaz 2101 or in common 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:34.820
 penny because it has long been outdated 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:38.570
 long gone off the assembly line but still 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:42.079
 he continues to buy ride ride 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:44.840
 bend over suffer and in general etc. etc. 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:47.980
 about the fact that bend and suffer it 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:51.320
 said absolutely not in vain because the tank 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:53.660
 extremely demanding hands top that 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:56.660
 nor spoke there today we will see 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:59.120
 fight in execution vova va you already 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:02.809
 imagine that it will be so 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:05.780
 let's look at the map as we see the steppe 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:09.079
 and not a single artillery so vovanu 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:11.090
 where will be played out at the beginning of the battle 

00:01:09.079 --> 00:01:13.850
 we see it takes to classic 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.039
 such a missionary position even so 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.709
 let 's say on the enemy 

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:21.490
 is trying to tell you the strength and 

00:01:18.709 --> 00:01:25.390
 look at what test he 

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:28.570
 lan here we come across an enemy 54-ka 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:31.180
 we begin to disassemble it so little 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.640
 but in fact the lot was surprised because 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.680
 Boban usually on this card immediately month 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.990
 ahead and here he plays a little bit 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.630
 cautiously doesn't know if he is there 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:43.330
 the phone was talking waist something 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:47.049
 engaged in parallel in general not 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:50.170
 I know the practice is absolutely not his from 

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:52.659
 54-ka enemy goes to the hangar and 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.350
 if we look at the map in principle 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:59.200
 flank is more or less such 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:02.319
 liberated here alone remained there 54 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:05.170
 points well 34 and all the other tanks for now 

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:07.270
 outside the lumbar zone and so you can safely 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:10.119
 move forward borrow more 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.970
 vantage point to fire a 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.580
 otherwise what for we play on ester of course 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:17.860
 that's where I prefer more anyway 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:20.230
 tyazhe but sometimes of course the speed is not 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:22.269
 enough here this here to us 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.150
 given the opportunity to take not 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:28.500
 bad position and you can play from the tower 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.790
 move 50 four and nerve or there and armor and 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.400
 reduced but nonetheless anyway 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.650
 You can play from the tower and if the enemy is 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:38.189
 more 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:41.670
 bbh those who have a chance of breaking through him 

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:44.610
 and extremely small so another pisi 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.269
 Four goes to hangar it goes to 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:48.360
 farther 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:50.819
 many probably wonder maybe 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.640
 worth it to buy the more so from whom she 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:55.829
 prokacha in my opinion of course not worth it 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:03:00.359
 because throws it in exactly the same way 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:03:03.689
 as 52 x 140 and for all specifications and 

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:05.849
 the parameters are kept at 54 inferior to them 

00:03:03.689 --> 00:03:09.510
 already for such let just fans 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:12.420
 lovers complicate their task for them 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:15.540
 maybe this tank is suitable for them 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:18.629
 here we see the enemy thirty four 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:21.329
 which is already farm and couple in the hangar and 

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:22.710
 drive on actually here are 30 

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:24.960
 four of course 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:28.910
 developers don't know what they thought 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:32.670
 will come up with a tank that China 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:35.820
 a dozen shot down his plywood case 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:38.790
 put on this plywood impenetrable 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:41.100
 cannon supposedly yes now look he tanchik 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.800
 stuck in there a cat with a break 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:45.690
 awesome then breaking through agree good 

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.660
 but only you will not need it because 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:50.850
 that the gun is so slanting so that no dick 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:53.070
 no one will get in and if you still 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.900
 miss the same likely 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:57.690
 probably you will need more 

00:03:54.900 --> 00:04:00.330
 recharge helped 15 seconds and 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:03.660
 drove these creations into your straight 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:06.900
 the store set a target of 50 bucks on those 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:10.020
 boys all for you tank for the elite and 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:12.810
 everything is cool and damask and punches me too 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:13.620
 got into this number of favorites so 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:15.990
 is said 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:18.930
 bought this tank on general garbage full 

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:21.510
 so do not buy it better buy 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:24.690
 qv-5 or 6 of course if you 

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:27.330
 mean by direct farm money well, 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:30.540
 while we were discussing masterpieces of architecture from 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:33.720
 Vowan wargaming a little bit on 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:36.720
 home goal live 4 almost to 4 with 

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:39.420
 half a thousand damage and it's like you 

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:41.910
 understand, of course, not all, but here we are 

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:42.770
 we see t30 is actually like this should 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:45.810
 be 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:48.660
 t-34 but oh well figs with him and here we are 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:52.080
 we see there are only four 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:54.000
 the enemy and here of course ice-t can 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.770
 realize yourself in full because 

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.740
 as a rule we have many times tarot 

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:00.570
 noticed when we play hard 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:02.790
 two or three opponents who already 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:05.100
 guaranteed how to merge but to 

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:07.449
 Unfortunately you can not get on them 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:09.879
 because st come from 

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:13.509
 clean them first well we are lucky we 

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:15.999
 today we drive on with t and therefore fat 

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:18.819
 we will get the pieces and now we start 

00:05:15.999 --> 00:05:21.249
 shoot and the first comes across to you 

00:05:18.819 --> 00:05:23.620
 Panther as we can see we shoot gold 

00:05:21.249 --> 00:05:25.629
 because the head would have ended but 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:27.219
 in fact for an effective game you 

00:05:25.629 --> 00:05:30.520
 want to play well and show 

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:32.559
 good results for 50 fours you 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.629
 Gold will need just really 

00:05:32.559 --> 00:05:37.809
 you can generally run and forget to run 

00:05:34.629 --> 00:05:40.210
 full gold but this is your sidekick 

00:05:37.809 --> 00:05:43.029
 because many principled not not 

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:47.139
 play even at the cost of victory and here we see 

00:05:43.029 --> 00:05:49.300
 luxury version of the t-34 because well 

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:49.689
 such a popular model can not be 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:52.779
 without 

00:05:49.689 --> 00:05:55.990
 exclusive option this t30 

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:59.080
 logical continuation of the tank t-34 

00:05:55.990 --> 00:06:02.289
 Wargaming's opinion is the same 

00:05:59.080 --> 00:06:05.439
 did more alpha on dick on need you 

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:08.559
 hear developers tank misses neither 

00:06:05.439 --> 00:06:11.319
 where he just misses a thousand 

00:06:08.559 --> 00:06:12.460
 fry and do not fall to 2000 

00:06:11.319 --> 00:06:15.639
 will be here we see 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:17.710
 the next creation of the Chinese vargeaming 

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:20.050
 aptly okay this is still a chair transfer 

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:23.139
 in the style of Chinese Kung Fu wants to inflict 

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:25.270
 double blow with overclocking but unfortunately 

00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:28.180
 misses but as we see judging by 

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:31.839
 his maneuver is absolutely not affected 

00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:34.899
 his fighting spirit and here he takes a distance 

00:06:31.839 --> 00:06:37.539
 for probably more powerful overclocking but 

00:06:34.899 --> 00:06:40.539
 unfortunately it has not been and remains 

00:06:37.539 --> 00:06:42.639
 Our Chinese Samurai is sent to 

00:06:40.539 --> 00:06:43.180
 hangar so let's see the results 

00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:45.909
 fights 

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:48.339
 Well, of course the master is natural 

00:06:45.909 --> 00:06:50.080
 Basic caliber and support if I don’t 

00:06:48.339 --> 00:06:52.569
 wrong in my opinion so this is a medal 

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:53.199
 called 115 thousand silver to us 

00:06:52.569 --> 00:06:56.649
 piled up 

00:06:53.199 --> 00:06:59.919
 all with a half thousand damage we did 

00:06:56.649 --> 00:07:01.749
 awesome number for ninth level yes and 

00:06:59.919 --> 00:07:05.860
 according to the mind for 10 too 

00:07:01.749 --> 00:07:09.669
 besides homework we still blocked 1350 

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:12.819
 damage and lit up a half thousand 

00:07:09.669 --> 00:07:14.709
 fanfare applause vovanu provided 

00:07:12.819 --> 00:07:18.189
