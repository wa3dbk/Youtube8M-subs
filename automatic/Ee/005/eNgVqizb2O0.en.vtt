an important part of the work that you
see<00:01:04.649> in<00:01:04.830> streetwise<00:01:05.399> is<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:06.660> level<00:01:06.960> of

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:07.050 
see in streetwise is the level of

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:08.840 
see in streetwise is the level of
engagement<00:01:07.380> that<00:01:07.800> the<00:01:08.040> photographer's<00:01:08.640> had

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
engagement that the photographer's had

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.330 
engagement that the photographer's had
with<00:01:09.240> their<00:01:09.450> subject<00:01:09.899> matter<00:01:10.110> they<00:01:11.009> were<00:01:11.070> also

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
with their subject matter they were also

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.260 
with their subject matter they were also
really<00:01:12.560> looking<00:01:13.560> for<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.190> outsiders<00:01:14.789> the

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
really looking for the outsiders the

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.570 
really looking for the outsiders the

and<00:01:17.820> this<00:01:18.539> was<00:01:18.899> partially<00:01:19.530> because<00:01:19.799> it<00:01:19.920> was

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
and this was partially because it was

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.950 
and this was partially because it was
not<00:01:20.190> a<00:01:20.220> typical<00:01:20.460> subject<00:01:20.850> matter<00:01:21.270> at<00:01:21.600> the<00:01:21.750> time

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
not a typical subject matter at the time

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.830
