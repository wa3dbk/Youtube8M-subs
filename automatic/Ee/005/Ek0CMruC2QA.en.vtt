 of butter 200 g of egg white 200 g of 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.899
 flour 200 g of icing sugar and for the 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.060
 finish then to garnish ours 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.820
 cup 100 grams of strawberries and 200 grams 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.860
 of melon 100 g of raspberries are a bit of 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.549
 mixed fruit 5 grams of peel of 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.810
 lemon and is red currant 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:17.900
 finally to make the liquid sugar there 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.930
 main recipe for making sorbets 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:24.720
 166 grams of glucose powder 49 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:27.900
 grams of dextrose 600 73 grams of 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:31.140
 granulated sugar and 362 g of water 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:36.659
 per hour in the proletarian 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:39.909
 we put the softened butter 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:42.369
 icing sugar ok 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:43.770
 then make the butter fit 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:47.740
 with icing sugar 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:50.350
 when the butter is a little mounted 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.670
 we begin to incorporate the egg white and 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.819
 the over we are careful attention to not 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:02:00.670
 to separate the whole so little for 

00:01:54.819 --> 00:02:02.859
 time and now I open the bowl of 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.270
 planetary I insert the whole flour 

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:06.849
 of a hit with the whip 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.200
 keep stirring so don't like how 

00:02:06.849 --> 00:02:08.759
 if it was a sponge cake but with the 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.989
 whip 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.910
 in the meantime prepare a mask 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:15.340
 on a baking sheet we go to put some 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.769
 in 100 on baking paper and spa 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:20.709
 we remove in such a way as to create one 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:24.840
 kind of nice round design like the 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:28.230
 thickness mask approx 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:36.549
 millimeter thick 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:39.489
 let's do another here we take away 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:42.160
 via the other mask again 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:43.810
 we go into the oven at around 190 degrees 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.579
 let's move on the liquid sugar 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.690
 base of fruit sorbet ice creams 

00:02:45.579 --> 00:02:50.049
 at the fruit 

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:52.599
 put on the water in a pan one 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:54.639
 let us wait for that type of ska 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:56.169
 slightly so that the powders 

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:58.720
 that fall into it melt more 

00:02:56.169 --> 00:03:02.950
 easily and we mix the three together 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:05.169
 powders ie the dextrose syrup of 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:08.410
 glucose powder and sugar 

00:03:05.169 --> 00:03:12.519
 unplug and mix together here 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:14.620
 now the rain in the water one 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:18.579
 once 85g of decanting arrived in one 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:21.940
 bowl or better a carafe and cover 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:23.980
 immediately with contact film and leave 

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:26.709
 cool now we see it and it 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.780
 we observe and opaque when it will relax 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:31.239
 becomes transparent and clear as 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.489
 this in the bowl and is the basis for i 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:37.959
 my sorbets let's do the al 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:39.090
 lemon now we take the juice of 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:41.590
 lemon 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:47.310
 the water you see back what I have 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:47.310
 said I put the blender inside 

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:57.050
 and puts in cold neutral so go 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:04:01.040
 I combine one liquid sugar 

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:04.790
 grated lemon peel is one 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:06.980
 chopped mint leaves just barely 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:10.750
 shredded so that we still see them at 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:15.260
 small pieces inside ours 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:17.150
 sorbet ok and now this can finish i 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.880
 sorbets were you see mint leaves 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.440
 they are nice because you can see them from sight 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:23.630
 lemon peel from its scent e 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:32.990
 let's put everything in sorbets 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:34.700
 it was about the mango one 

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:37.340
 and that raspberry doesn't change 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:39.350
 absolutely nothing i mean i take it 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.800
 liquid sugar the raspberry door or 

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:44.780
 the marco pulp which is the neutral 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.460
 water the lemon juice to give a 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:47.810
 bit of acidity naturally up here of 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:49.130
 remain major in the 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:51.200
 other sites will serve to give some 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:52.310
 vinegar and demolished everything and puts a 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:54.620
 sorbet was therefore always with one 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:58.100
 same basis I make more recipes I go to 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:05:02.270
 take from the wafer formulas we pull 

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:03.770
 so they are soft with a spatula 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:06.410
 because they are hot as soon as they cool down 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:08.990
 they become crunchy and I insert inside 

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:11.210
 on my cover and prepare some 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:14.389
 fruit decorated to make our cup 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:16.490
 we put a dot of cream on the plate 

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:19.690
 pastry on the bottom I put the waffle in the 

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:21.770
 half in such a way that it stays that way 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:23.870
 I'm going to get my first two 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:26.780
 sorbets that are stabilized in 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:28.280
 that is, the mango and raspberry freezers 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:31.270
 that I've done before 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:34.280
 take a ball of the mango ball 

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:37.910
 and we put a little ball of it in the center 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:40.729
 the raspberry one on one side and let's go 

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:43.370
 to pick up a little ball of this lemon 

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:45.830
 at this point we begin to compose with i 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:50.120
 our flowers and complete with a 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:53.470
 tiny little mint sprig for 

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:53.470
 give a little green bet
