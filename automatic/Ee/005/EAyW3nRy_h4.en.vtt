it<00:00:44.850> it<00:00:45.570> just<00:00:45.870> it<00:00:46.110> was<00:00:46.350> really<00:00:46.920> a<00:00:46.950> hard<00:00:47.280> thing<00:00:47.730> to

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
it it just it was really a hard thing to

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.770 
it it just it was really a hard thing to
do<00:00:48.780> because<00:00:49.250> we're<00:00:50.250> riding<00:00:50.670> 55<00:00:51.210> miles<00:00:51.510> an<00:00:51.660> hour

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
do because we're riding 55 miles an hour

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.979 
do because we're riding 55 miles an hour
down<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.469> road<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:54.149> truck<00:00:54.180> slammed<00:00:54.719> on

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
down the road and the truck slammed on

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.319 
down the road and the truck slammed on
the<00:00:55.140> brakes<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.860> you're<00:00:56.550> going<00:00:56.789> on<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:57.030> turns

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
the brakes and you're going on the turns

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.139 
the brakes and you're going on the turns
and<00:00:57.690> I<00:00:57.930> mean<00:00:58.350> it<00:00:58.530> was<00:00:58.680> really<00:00:59.250> really<00:00:59.640> a<00:00:59.820> hard

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
and I mean it was really really a hard

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.450 
and I mean it was really really a hard
match<00:01:00.539> to<00:01:00.780> have<00:01:00.930> it<00:01:01.079> and<00:01:01.260> but<00:01:01.530> like<00:01:02.160> I<00:01:02.250> say<00:01:02.430> I

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
match to have it and but like I say I

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.740
