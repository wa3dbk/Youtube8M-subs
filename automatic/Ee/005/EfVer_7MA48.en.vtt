00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.649
 street makes me feel special ok let's 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.110
 start with a spoonful of 

00:01:07.649 --> 00:01:11.430
 butter without salt melted down here 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.770
 in the descriptions he left all the 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.869
 exact amounts one tablespoon of 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.600
 brown sugar or mascabado and a 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.090
 spoonful of normal sugar if you do not have 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.950
 brown sugar uses two tablespoons of 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.840
 normal sugar but the dark suter gives 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.090
 the flavor of chaco chef cookies and in 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.399
 rich ok now a pinch of salt and 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.310
 also a yolk of an egg look let's go 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:36.330
 to separate the yolk from the egg whites is like this 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:38.970
 nothing simpler nothing more now we pass 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.770
 the yolk here and we mix it very well 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.409
 until it is well creamy and two 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.140
 Spoons of chocolate sparks and 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.060
 nuts or almonds or whatever you want 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.250

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.380

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.420

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.899

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:04.140

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:06.360

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:12.480

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:16.500

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:19.010

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.010
