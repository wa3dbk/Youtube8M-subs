00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:07.359
 it was a different bus so sit here 

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:09.309
 two doubles toute la la 

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:11.889
 mara in that other bus was the thing 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:13.990
 a single chair and I was just behind the 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:15.669
 driver so I only saw a glass 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.130
 prepare forest ranger main place 

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:19.869
 exotic scents is sometimes not yes 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.300
 but I will be quite right 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:23.560
 backwards smell and it went to 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.109
 Outside 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.060
 yes that went out to the door 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:30.519
 check because he opened and closed 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.680
 and he was busy with the door and then 

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:34.120
 the door suddenly closed and the bus closed 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.650
 started to drive and I had that in the 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:40.450
 holes for me is that the driver 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:42.400
 outside is doing after and then started 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.320
 the driver to ride the bus and 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.950
 all brahms beat because he went like that 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:51.040
 marije and no summer ar yes ar no so bad 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:53.200
 I do not know well that happened and 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:57.130
 then too hard for the children 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:01:00.610
 if well he can go pretty fast 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:02.260
 he pulled a lot and ron with them 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.700
 all were children between 12 and with 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.199
 14 in the stock market 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.310
 now we of course didn't know what they were 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:07.869
 had to do that were not all 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.609
 painter of yes someone has to clean up 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:11.350
 someone has to clean up and that bus driver 

00:01:09.609 --> 00:01:13.240
 it all knocks the window and then thought 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:14.439
 yes then I must be I am the oldest 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.939
 this is actually mine 

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:16.390
 responsibility to 

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:19.509
 to jump 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.140
 so i jumped on i jumped over you 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:23.049
 out 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.670
 of which the box closes I 'm at the 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:27.249
 sit down 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.689
 and we were already on the left half of me 

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:30.759
 thought i should adjust quickly before 

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:32.109
 someone else us to a i goat 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:33.640
 could not find him 

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:35.939
 so then I am further on the bike path 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:40.220
 go rajda and finally i am there 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:43.460
 between this sphere of stone 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.560
 yes peace and this pole and the store and 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.390
 still pretty handsome or say enter to 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.220
 in addition, that white pole stood a whole 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.100
 big fat tree just as thick as that 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:54.830
 behind that and you fully devoted yourself to it 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.630
 and name is to be midnight after that 

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.170
 floor and then we are at a standstill 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.560
 come 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.390
 yes and then you saw what did I do 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.490
 yes indeed a daughter from then and 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.050
 then the bus driver came and suddenly it was 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.640
 in europe i do n't know if he had it 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.820
 done because he's automatic over it 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.590
 and then you would stop me home and I 

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:15.050
 was very nicely realized then I thought of it 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.910
 he puts me now choose items wrong though 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.310
 agree to be angry with me in that 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.720
 I try to help and then was realized 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.160
 I that he just served everyone 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.620
 had to go out 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.209
 look out of the box and be able to 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:29.090
 everyone is taken out and is in one 

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:31.250
 saw another street and you have one 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.220
 driving license 9 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:35.660
 almost you pray what lessons she had 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.280
 already pretty soft seated at the wheel 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.800
 yes yes I have sent over stores 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:41.360
 does not make b plus no because the pedals 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.180
 are also different and short before my eyes 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.730
 mouth kicks in there both pedals 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:49.280
 but did nothing and then later comes 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.410
 tower you have to pay for a bus 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.120
 kick in very hard before they do something 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.860
 and of course I didn't know because I was 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.120
 used to a car so I come 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.010
 stairs on which both deep valleys 

00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:01.010
 turns to see which one is the 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:02.420
 window was he did nothing 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.739
 then I didn't know what to do but 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.190
 luckily that tree was there 

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:10.340
 startled 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:13.330

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:16.459

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:18.920
 but yes you are actually helping me 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:20.480
 my hero everyone would do it too 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.110
 what is just your responsibility 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.819
 That 

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.290
 why a little kids i thought i 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:25.910
 must do something or the happens with the 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.250
 children that would have been bad 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.330
 because if you had done nothing where would the 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.860
 blues then ended up 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:32.690
 the will tell you for a reason lamb 

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:35.180

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:37.849
 of the parked cars or 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:40.160
 we were hit or if I stood 

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:41.629
 there was the shop manager 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.160
 we wanted to do a lot of damage 

00:03:41.629 --> 00:03:46.280
 and we were probably whole 

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.330
 many children just ask by and that 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:52.640

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:54.380
