and we'll now check out the fit this pad

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.960 
and we'll now check out the fit this pad
because<00:01:31.860> of<00:01:32.009> this<00:01:32.100> web<00:01:32.369> is<00:01:32.580> a<00:01:32.610> little<00:01:32.850> bit

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
because of this web is a little bit

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.300 
because of this web is a little bit
harder<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:33.240> get<00:01:33.509> on<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.650> rubber<00:01:34.890> really

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
harder to get on the the rubber really

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.609 
harder to get on the the rubber really
kind<00:01:35.579> of<00:01:35.670> sticks<00:01:35.970> to<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:36.240> arm<00:01:36.450> which<00:01:37.110> once<00:01:37.500> you

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
kind of sticks to the arm which once you

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.640 
kind of sticks to the arm which once you
get<00:01:37.770> it<00:01:37.890> on<00:01:38.810> its<00:01:39.810> really<00:01:40.049> what<00:01:40.200> you<00:01:40.350> want<00:01:40.530> in

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
get it on its really what you want in

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.710 
get it on its really what you want in
the<00:01:40.740> pad<00:01:40.950> but<00:01:41.520> getting<00:01:41.700> it<00:01:41.909> on<00:01:42.060> takes<00:01:42.509> a<00:01:42.600> little

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
the pad but getting it on takes a little

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.899 
the pad but getting it on takes a little
longer<00:01:43.020> than<00:01:43.259> others<00:01:43.590> but<00:01:44.400> so<00:01:44.520> once<00:01:44.670> you<00:01:44.790> get

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
longer than others but so once you get

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:47.510 
longer than others but so once you get
