00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:10.940
 today is again heavily weathered that 

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:15.019
 she became your five minutes again 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:17.960
 asked for a cost-effective and 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:20.360
 easy possibility several tracks too 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.800
 grain people i think i 've been in 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.260
 a lot of videos I said 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.490
 personally i am completely laffan i 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.750
 I do not have the device here but 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:32.029
 i own it all the people in 

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:35.300
 purely to take a look at things 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:39.350
 I put the zoom r16 or something 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:40.640
 dearer r 24 to the heart of the difference 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.809
 between these two devices is 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:46.880
 pretty easy 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:50.870
 r 16 16 tracks simultaneously reflect 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:53.059
 24 24 tracks and 24 can too 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:56.090
 record at 48 kilohertz 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:58.129
 These are so different the differences 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:00.320
 I do not know what the zoom r16 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:04.070
 now costs the 16th 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:08.690
 cook I think he will cost 300 350 new 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:11.390
 euro including memory card why 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:14.869
 I think the great now comes the zoom 

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:17.990
 can record eight tracks at the same time 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:20.060
 So that has eight combos sockets either 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:26.840
 you can plug in there or xl 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:28.929
 and xxl and he can do what you do not say 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.459
 he has two channels have phantom power 

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:33.800
 and the zoom still has two internally 

00:01:31.459 --> 00:01:36.259
 Microphones with which you can easily do it 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.270
 as a stereo moderately thing his live 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:40.880
 could record the session then the 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.349
 16 can be operated with batteries 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.700
 We pretty cool what I know if you take 

00:01:42.349 --> 00:01:47.000
 make the acoustic session on the beach 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.860
 I want to start things with record and 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.330
 the absolute best thing about this 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.479
 just gets super awesome 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:56.660
 class he has either internally one 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:58.190
 memory card of the sd card is the one 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.080
 normal he can do so much 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.250
 record how big card is there 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.819
 also one of the come all for 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.399
 plug in 

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:06.709
 or you can connect the usb 

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:08.690
 connect the thing to the computer and 

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:10.759
 then you do not take on the 16 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:12.350
 on his eight tracks but you can 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.910
 the eight tracks directly on the computer 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.890
 that can be a laptop that can 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:19.310
 real computers should be recorded 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:21.050
 everything relatively easy I believe in the original 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.940
 even software is such a small cubase 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:26.600
 version to record is believed 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.230
 I even have great features what I want 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.220
 one more 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:34.430
 or the box also has itself 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.680
 some internal effects that means he has 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.420
 I believe a guitar input and up 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.340
 you could even do that input 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.840
 always diverse guitars on the are 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.910
 Of course not the world sounds 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:46.880
 but the 100 to capture the idea 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:49.340
 and so quickly what is going to reach 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.170
 It is completely out of the country so it can 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.120
 you really join in everything 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.130
 and that's thinking like it's said 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:56.840
 own idiots and bomb themselves but 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:58.370
 once there is a cable pure man leveled 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.690
 then you press record there so there 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.050
 You can not really go wrong 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.600
 do 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:03.770
 the thing has an internal metronome that 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.050
 If you are just exact time 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:08.120
 does not want to record a problem if 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:10.100
 one just stops on the box 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.790
 of course, no graphical interface 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.650
 that is clear 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:16.340
 But I take the traces on computer 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:17.720
 on the channels always see my immediately 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.100
 Traces what I recorded then 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.510
 Of course I can also cut nicely 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.280
 Of course this will work fine , too 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.010
 very nice i could track the tracks too 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:26.300
 retrospectively from the memory card in 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.270
 get the computer that works, of course 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:31.190
 that's completely clear and I can 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:33.500
 of course always eight tracks simultaneously 

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:36.260
 but that does not take me away 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:38.420
 I would stop if I now too 

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:40.910
 the xoom itself with memory card without 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.350
 I can record eight traces of computers 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:44.120
 and then i still have the possibility 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:46.450
 So it can take another eight 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.680
 That's why 16 of them are called 16 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.850
 he can not play 16 

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.970
 record simultaneously 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:55.250
 but that would not be a problem if you 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:57.380
 a second zoom he would have 16 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.300
 maybe you own in the band 

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:01.820
 or in such a thing then you can 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:04.040
 cascade two and then you can 16 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:06.530
 At the same time call is also possible 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:09.980
 still for people who need it but around 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:11.660
 I find a device at the same time 

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:13.790
 a sound card for a computer is 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:16.609
 what you can take with you at the same time 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.060
 with with so with so battery operates 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:19.700
 what you are 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:23.389
 only as a recording device 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:25.669
 this 300 euro supergeil invested money 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:28.460
 I recommend that everyone tied and was 

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:31.130
 since you are so far at the beginning of the 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:34.130
 Record songwriting and tape rehearsal 

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:37.100
 There is nothing more sensible than this 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:38.990
 gadgets microsd a bit and 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:41.090
 you have the whole band session right away 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.980
 You do not have to do everything in the world 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:45.500
 great tam tam tam tam tam record 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:46.370
 but it's enough to say the right 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.500
 to decrease 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:51.110
 The bass individually from increasingly over the 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:53.960
 the output of the guitar by means of a microphone 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:56.120
 paint because of and just stop the drums 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.050
 the most important parts 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.850
 make better use of 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.979
 you already have that country 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:02.360
 then you are already very far ahead 

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:04.430
 maybe even a top microphone 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.470
 to get the sheet metal and the whole 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:08.960
 platform drums for eight rich 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:09.830
 drove off easily and as I said who then 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.139
 want to do more 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:13.610
 as soon as you are in the computer you can yes 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:15.680
 the eight tracks that one simultaneously 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:17.900
 you can still pick up some 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.280
 to record that means as soon as you look at yourself 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:21.130
 moving in the computer is in the 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:24.470
 infinite two loop so to speak 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:25.280
 and then the 16 o'clock serves as 

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:27.410
 interface 

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:29.630
 I know the traces in the computer then 

00:05:27.410 --> 00:05:31.640
 also rework as I want effects 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:34.130
 otherwise what then then off then yes 

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:35.090
 everything and let you tell nothing of 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:36.979
 any people 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:38.120
 I also find the sound quality me 

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:39.560
 have been using the thing already been what 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.720
 if done reasonably 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:43.580
 has reasonable microphones and in 

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:44.930
 reasonably priced 

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:48.130
 will be able to produce 

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:50.930
 because is the sound quality of a xoom 16 

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:54.139
 actually terrifyingly good you have to 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:55.850
 just say as said for 300 it 

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:58.310
 in my opinion is the thing 

00:05:55.850 --> 00:06:00.860
 pretty unrivaled what this act 

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:02.919
 What's this all about these tracks 

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:04.669
 what the device can do as a single 

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:07.310
 sumerer 16 

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:09.110
 Look at that it is the hottest 

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:11.720
 in my opinion the hottest 

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:14.800
 cheapest variant very flexible 

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:14.800
 to be in his pictures
