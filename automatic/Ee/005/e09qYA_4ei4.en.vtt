00:00:59.690 --> 00:00:59.700 
over not too hard

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:01.930

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.690 
look just make sure it's all nice and
everywhere<00:01:03.949> so<00:01:04.949> then<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.369> paint<00:01:05.579> will<00:01:05.670> stick

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
everywhere so then the paint will stick

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.399 
everywhere so then the paint will stick
because<00:01:05.999> I've<00:01:06.270> painted<00:01:09.079> plastic<00:01:10.079> surfaces

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
because I've painted plastic surfaces

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.230

before<00:01:10.679> and<00:01:11.609> it's<00:01:12.060> too<00:01:12.689> because<00:01:13.280> the<00:01:14.280> paint

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
before and it's too because the paint

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.459 
before and it's too because the paint
had<00:01:15.359> nothing<00:01:15.630> to<00:01:15.719> grip<00:01:15.869> onto<00:01:16.189> so<00:01:17.189> i<00:01:17.219> sanded<00:01:17.729> it

00:01:18.459 --> 00:01:18.469
