00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:07.249 

performance<00:00:04.759> I'm<00:00:05.759> happy<00:00:06.420> with<00:00:06.660> the<00:00:06.810> way<00:00:06.960> I'm

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259 
performance I'm happy with the way I'm

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.009 
performance I'm happy with the way I'm
not<00:00:08.220> so<00:00:08.429> happy<00:00:08.580> with<00:00:08.910> the<00:00:09.030> result<00:00:09.420> because<00:00:09.990> I

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
not so happy with the result because I

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.650 
not so happy with the result because I
think<00:00:10.200> we<00:00:10.590> have<00:00:10.730> the<00:00:11.730> opportunity<00:00:11.759> the

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
think we have the opportunity the

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.900 
think we have the opportunity the
chances<00:00:13.139> to<00:00:13.380> to<00:00:14.040> end<00:00:14.219> this<00:00:14.370> game<00:00:14.460> and

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
chances to to end this game and

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.680 
chances to to end this game and
certainly<00:00:15.920> when<00:00:16.920> we<00:00:17.160> were<00:00:17.430> the<00:00:17.880> best<00:00:18.119> in<00:00:18.420> in

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
certainly when we were the best in in

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.910 
certainly when we were the best in in
the<00:00:18.840> match<00:00:19.020> I<00:00:19.350> mean<00:00:19.740> the<00:00:20.010> first<00:00:20.510> 25<00:00:21.510> minutes<00:00:21.920> we

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
the match I mean the first 25 minutes we

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.960 
the match I mean the first 25 minutes we
have<00:00:23.070> a<00:00:23.699> lot<00:00:24.060> of<00:00:24.210> chances<00:00:25.310> yeah

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
have a lot of chances yeah

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.630 
have a lot of chances yeah
after<00:00:27.510> it<00:00:27.630> was<00:00:27.869> a<00:00:28.170> little<00:00:28.560> more<00:00:29.070> difficult<00:00:29.519> but

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
after it was a little more difficult but

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.550 
after it was a little more difficult but
it's<00:00:29.849> quite<00:00:30.090> normal<00:00:30.269> you<00:00:30.570> cannot<00:00:30.990> stay<00:00:31.289> with

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
it's quite normal you cannot stay with

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.940 
it's quite normal you cannot stay with
this<00:00:31.710> temper<00:00:32.340> of<00:00:32.520> 45<00:00:33.180> minutes<00:00:33.450> so<00:00:34.290> we<00:00:34.559> control

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
this temper of 45 minutes so we control

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.100 
this temper of 45 minutes so we control
till<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.610> game<00:00:35.790> and<00:00:36.059> even<00:00:36.480> in<00:00:36.600> the<00:00:36.719> second

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
till the game and even in the second

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.680 
till the game and even in the second
half<00:00:37.590> I<00:00:37.860> think<00:00:38.010> that<00:00:38.489> with<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.940> chance<00:00:39.540> of

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
half I think that with the chance of

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.819 
half I think that with the chance of
Marvin<00:00:41.030> if<00:00:42.030> we<00:00:42.239> score<00:00:42.480> at<00:00:42.660> this<00:00:42.840> moment<00:00:43.079> we

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
Marvin if we score at this moment we

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:46.790 
Marvin if we score at this moment we
never<00:00:44.040> know<00:00:44.190> of<00:00:44.340> course<00:00:44.579> but<00:00:44.640> I<00:00:44.789> think<00:00:44.910> that<00:00:45.800> we

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
never know of course but I think that we

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.529 
never know of course but I think that we
will<00:00:46.950> have<00:00:47.010> three<00:00:47.579> points<00:00:47.969> so<00:00:48.920> happy<00:00:49.920> but<00:00:50.129> I

00:00:50.529 --> 00:00:50.539 
will have three points so happy but I

00:00:50.539 --> 00:01:00.709 
will have three points so happy but I
can<00:00:51.539> be<00:00:51.719> more<00:00:51.930> happy<00:00:52.350> than<00:00:52.379> this<00:00:58.640> no<00:00:59.640> I<00:00:59.670> think<00:00:59.850> I

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
can be more happy than this no I think I

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.119 
can be more happy than this no I think I
do<00:01:00.989> what<00:01:01.379> I<00:01:01.410> do<00:01:01.730> January<00:01:02.730> I<00:01:03.059> I<00:01:03.870> share<00:01:04.680> my

work<00:01:12.780> in<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:13.110> stuff<00:01:13.380> and<00:01:13.790> I<00:01:14.810> must<00:01:15.810> say<00:01:15.960> that<00:01:15.990> the

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
work in a stuff and I must say that the

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.190 
work in a stuff and I must say that the
way<00:01:16.650> that<00:01:16.950> the<00:01:17.250> members<00:01:17.939> of<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.720> staff<00:01:18.930> and

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
way that the members of the staff and

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.410 
way that the members of the staff and
certainly<00:01:19.950> all<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.220> employees<00:01:20.820> of<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.210> club

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
certainly all the employees of the club

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.890 
certainly all the employees of the club
helped<00:01:22.290> me<00:01:22.409> a<00:01:22.439> lot<00:01:22.650> because<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:24.299> Welcome<00:01:24.720> was

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
helped me a lot because the Welcome was

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.390 
helped me a lot because the Welcome was
great<00:01:25.229> and<00:01:25.470> I<00:01:26.310> think<00:01:26.610> that<00:01:26.790> in<00:01:26.970> two<00:01:27.299> days<00:01:28.250> we<00:01:29.250> do

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
great and I think that in two days we do

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.789 
great and I think that in two days we do
a<00:01:29.430> good<00:01:29.640> job<00:01:29.700> but<00:01:30.630> it's<00:01:30.869> only<00:01:31.079> a<00:01:31.229> first<00:01:31.500> step<00:01:31.740> of

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
a good job but it's only a first step of

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:38.830 
a good job but it's only a first step of
course

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.749 

you<00:01:39.799> know<00:01:39.920> when<00:01:40.490> I'm<00:01:40.719> there<00:01:41.719> I<00:01:42.020> think<00:01:42.920> only<00:01:43.369> on

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 
you know when I'm there I think only on

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:46.539 
you know when I'm there I think only on
my<00:01:44.240> team<00:01:44.509> I<00:01:44.539> mean<00:01:44.869> I'm<00:01:45.049> completely<00:01:45.770> in<00:01:46.340> the

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:46.549 
my team I mean I'm completely in the

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:50.800 
my team I mean I'm completely in the
game<00:01:46.759> I<00:01:48.189> must<00:01:49.189> say<00:01:49.310> that's<00:01:49.490> that's<00:01:50.090> story<00:01:50.600> of

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
game I must say that's that's story of

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.499 
game I must say that's that's story of
football<00:01:51.289> I<00:01:51.319> mean<00:01:51.590> it's<00:01:51.770> nothing<00:01:52.520> new<00:01:52.700> I<00:01:53.030> have

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:53.509 
football I mean it's nothing new I have

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:56.440 
football I mean it's nothing new I have
a<00:01:53.539> so<00:01:53.869> lot<00:01:54.109> of<00:01:54.170> respect<00:01:54.770> for<00:01:54.979> DX<00:01:55.490> manager<00:01:56.000> but

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:56.450 
a so lot of respect for DX manager but

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.990 
a so lot of respect for DX manager but
it's<00:01:56.810> football<00:01:57.079> and<00:01:57.500> for<00:01:57.770> the<00:01:57.920> rest<00:01:58.100> the

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
it's football and for the rest the

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.639 
it's football and for the rest the
reaction<00:01:59.450> of<00:01:59.600> the<00:01:59.750> fans<00:01:59.990> at<00:02:00.259> the<00:02:00.439> end

00:02:00.639 --> 00:02:00.649 
reaction of the fans at the end

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:03.130 
reaction of the fans at the end
certainly<00:02:01.549> for<00:02:01.729> the<00:02:01.819> players<00:02:02.090> and<00:02:02.450> I<00:02:02.840> think

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:03.140 
certainly for the players and I think

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.340 
certainly for the players and I think
for<00:02:03.380> what<00:02:03.740> they<00:02:03.920> sow<00:02:04.640> is<00:02:05.479> the<00:02:05.659> most<00:02:05.840> important

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
for what they sow is the most important

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.859 
for what they sow is the most important
because<00:02:07.039> I'm<00:02:07.399> not<00:02:07.579> here<00:02:07.819> for<00:02:07.850> me<00:02:08.179> I'm<00:02:08.420> here<00:02:08.690> for

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
because I'm not here for me I'm here for

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.410 
because I'm not here for me I'm here for
