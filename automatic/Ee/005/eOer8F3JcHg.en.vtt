weapon has a very slow fire rate so

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:57.930 
weapon has a very slow fire rate so
enabling<00:03:56.019> ready<00:03:56.349> up<00:03:56.500> in<00:03:56.739> your<00:03:57.040> perk<00:03:57.310> slot<00:03:57.489> it's

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:01.690 
bit quicker with the weapon and be able

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:03.659 
bit quicker with the weapon and be able
to<00:04:01.900> shoot<00:04:02.290> people<00:04:02.530> quicker<00:04:03.220> than<00:04:03.459> if<00:04:03.579> you

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:03.669 
to shoot people quicker than if you

00:04:03.669 --> 00:04:05.430 
to shoot people quicker than if you
don't<00:04:03.849> have<00:04:04.030> the<00:04:04.239> actual<00:04:04.599> radio<00:04:04.750> 3<00:04:05.139> all<00:04:05.380> right

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
don't have the actual radio 3 all right

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.319 
don't have the actual radio 3 all right
so<00:04:05.650> the<00:04:05.769> next<00:04:05.919> perk<00:04:06.190> we<00:04:06.370> have<00:04:06.519> up<00:04:06.669> is<00:04:06.849> stalker

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:07.329 
so the next perk we have up is stalker

00:04:07.329 --> 00:04:09.210 
so the next perk we have up is stalker
and<00:04:07.569> I<00:04:07.630> would<00:04:07.780> probably<00:04:07.959> say<00:04:08.620> this<00:04:08.859> is<00:04:09.010> the

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
and I would probably say this is the

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:10.860 
and I would probably say this is the
most<00:04:09.430> addicting<00:04:10.090> perk<00:04:10.299> in<00:04:10.480> the<00:04:10.660> game<00:04:10.840> just

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 
most addicting perk in the game just

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.140 
most addicting perk in the game just

really<00:04:34.990> realize<00:04:35.260> it<00:04:35.560> is<00:04:35.979> it<00:04:36.220> allows<00:04:36.430> you<00:04:36.580> to

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
really realize it is it allows you to

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.189 
really realize it is it allows you to
get<00:04:36.820> triple<00:04:37.270> kills<00:04:37.479> double<00:04:37.840> kills<00:04:37.990> a<00:04:38.080> lot

00:04:38.189 --> 00:04:38.199 
get triple kills double kills a lot

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:39.750 
get triple kills double kills a lot
easier<00:04:38.560> because<00:04:38.860> if<00:04:39.010> you<00:04:39.160> don't<00:04:39.280> have<00:04:39.430> stalker

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:39.760 
easier because if you don't have stalker

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:40.980 
easier because if you don't have stalker
and<00:04:40.000> you<00:04:40.060> have<00:04:40.150> two<00:04:40.330> or<00:04:40.389> three<00:04:40.419> people<00:04:40.539> coming

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:40.990 
and you have two or three people coming

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:42.689 
and you have two or three people coming
at<00:04:41.110> you<00:04:41.289> you<00:04:41.470> can't<00:04:41.949> really<00:04:42.130> straight<00:04:42.550> from

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:42.699 
at you you can't really straight from

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:44.010 
at you you can't really straight from
left<00:04:42.880> to<00:04:42.940> right<00:04:43.120> as<00:04:43.330> quick<00:04:43.660> so<00:04:43.810> you're<00:04:43.930> gonna

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:44.020 
left to right as quick so you're gonna

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:45.390 
left to right as quick so you're gonna
be<00:04:44.169> a<00:04:44.199> lot<00:04:44.470> easier<00:04:44.530> to<00:04:45.039> kill

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:45.400 
be a lot easier to kill

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.070 
be a lot easier to kill
so<00:04:45.729> therefore<00:04:45.880> stalker<00:04:46.330> is<00:04:46.570> a<00:04:46.599> perk<00:04:46.960> that

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:47.080 
so therefore stalker is a perk that

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:49.200 
so therefore stalker is a perk that
allows<00:04:47.289> you<00:04:47.440> to<00:04:47.530> get<00:04:47.620> multi<00:04:48.070> kills<00:04:48.340> a<00:04:48.580> lot<00:04:48.969> more

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
allows you to get multi kills a lot more

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:50.640 
allows you to get multi kills a lot more
frequently<00:04:49.419> than<00:04:49.870> if<00:04:50.080> you<00:04:50.200> didn't<00:04:50.440> have<00:04:50.500> the

00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:50.650 
frequently than if you didn't have the

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:51.110 
frequently than if you didn't have the
perks

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 
perks

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:53.060 
perks
take<00:04:51.210> down<00:04:51.389> is<00:04:51.540> the<00:04:51.660> next<00:04:51.840> perk<00:04:52.020> up<00:04:52.199> and<00:04:52.410> of

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:53.070 
take down is the next perk up and of

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:54.830 
take down is the next perk up and of
course<00:04:53.310> as<00:04:53.490> we<00:04:53.820> all<00:04:53.850> know<00:04:54.150> take<00:04:54.419> that<00:04:54.600> allows

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
course as we all know take that allows

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:56.240 
course as we all know take that allows
us<00:04:54.870> to<00:04:55.050> kill<00:04:55.320> enemies<00:04:55.680> without<00:04:55.830> revealing

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
us to kill enemies without revealing

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:57.980 
us to kill enemies without revealing
their<00:04:56.550> death<00:04:56.760> locations<00:04:57.360> and<00:04:57.570> you<00:04:57.630> might<00:04:57.780> ask

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:57.990 
their death locations and you might ask

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:59.600 
their death locations and you might ask
yeah<00:04:58.560> but<00:04:58.770> you<00:04:58.830> don't<00:04:58.979> have<00:04:59.040> a<00:04:59.130> silenced

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
yeah but you don't have a silenced

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:00.140 
yeah but you don't have a silenced
weapon

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
weapon

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:01.550 
weapon
you<00:05:00.330> know<00:05:00.419> people<00:05:00.810> can<00:05:00.930> still<00:05:01.169> see<00:05:01.380> where

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 
you know people can still see where

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:02.750 
you know people can still see where
you're<00:05:01.710> at<00:05:01.830> but<00:05:02.190> then<00:05:02.340> again<00:05:02.550> you'll<00:05:02.729> be

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:02.760 
you're at but then again you'll be

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.129 
you're at but then again you'll be
surprised<00:05:03.210> because<00:05:03.360> there<00:05:03.630> are<00:05:03.750> so<00:05:04.020> many

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:04.139 
surprised because there are so many

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:05.900 
surprised because there are so many
players<00:05:04.470> out<00:05:04.680> there<00:05:04.979> that<00:05:05.160> don't<00:05:05.370> ever<00:05:05.639> look

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:05.910 
players out there that don't ever look

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.120 
players out there that don't ever look
at<00:05:06.090> their<00:05:06.389> minimaps<00:05:06.600> so<00:05:07.410> therefore<00:05:07.830> you<00:05:08.010> know

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
at their minimaps so therefore you know

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:09.800 
at their minimaps so therefore you know
that's<00:05:08.400> how<00:05:08.550> you<00:05:08.610> can<00:05:08.850> actually<00:05:09.000> rely<00:05:09.419> on<00:05:09.449> take

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:09.810 
that's how you can actually rely on take

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:11.689 
that's how you can actually rely on take
down<00:05:09.990> some<00:05:10.229> players<00:05:10.440> rely<00:05:10.800> on<00:05:10.830> take<00:05:11.220> down<00:05:11.460> and

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:11.699 
down some players rely on take down and

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:13.580 
down some players rely on take down and
don't<00:05:12.060> rely<00:05:12.270> on<00:05:12.300> their<00:05:12.720> mini-map<00:05:13.080> whether

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:13.590 
don't rely on their mini-map whether

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:14.870 
don't rely on their mini-map whether
obviously<00:05:14.010> it<00:05:14.130> should<00:05:14.280> be<00:05:14.430> the<00:05:14.550> other<00:05:14.669> way

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:14.880 
obviously it should be the other way

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.909 
obviously it should be the other way
around<00:05:14.910> so<00:05:15.570> next<00:05:15.750> up<00:05:15.930> we<00:05:16.080> have<00:05:16.110> dead<00:05:16.500> silence

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:16.919 
around so next up we have dead silence

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:19.280 
around so next up we have dead silence
as<00:05:17.070> I<00:05:17.280> said<00:05:17.550> dead<00:05:17.729> silence<00:05:18.120> is<00:05:18.270> a<00:05:18.300> must<00:05:18.810> it

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:19.290 
as I said dead silence is a must it

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:20.719 
as I said dead silence is a must it
obviously<00:05:19.590> gives<00:05:19.830> you<00:05:20.070> you<00:05:20.190> know<00:05:20.220> silent

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:20.729 
obviously gives you you know silent

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:22.670 
obviously gives you you know silent
footsteps<00:05:21.210> but<00:05:21.750> you<00:05:21.810> must<00:05:21.990> be<00:05:22.139> aware<00:05:22.169> they

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:22.680 
footsteps but you must be aware they

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.140 
footsteps but you must be aware they
actually<00:05:23.010> put<00:05:23.250> it<00:05:23.370> back<00:05:23.520> how<00:05:23.729> it<00:05:23.850> used<00:05:23.970> to<00:05:24.060> be

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:24.150 
actually put it back how it used to be

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:25.070 
actually put it back how it used to be
in<00:05:24.210> the<00:05:24.270> beginning<00:05:24.539> of<00:05:24.600> the<00:05:24.690> Call<00:05:24.840> of<00:05:24.870> Duty

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.080 
in the beginning of the Call of Duty

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:25.520 
in the beginning of the Call of Duty
ghosts

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:25.530 
ghosts

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:28.279 
ghosts
series<00:05:26.280> when<00:05:26.460> it<00:05:26.550> came<00:05:26.699> out<00:05:26.760> that<00:05:27.360> amplifier

00:05:28.279 --> 00:05:28.289 
series when it came out that amplifier

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:29.870 
series when it came out that amplifier
could<00:05:28.470> actually<00:05:28.650> hear<00:05:29.070> your<00:05:29.250> footsteps

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:29.880 
could actually hear your footsteps

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.240 
could actually hear your footsteps
so<00:05:30.240> now<00:05:30.479> amplified<00:05:31.229> can<00:05:31.410> still<00:05:31.710> hear<00:05:31.949> dead

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:32.250 
so now amplified can still hear dead

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:33.860 
so now amplified can still hear dead
silent<00:05:32.729> footstep<00:05:33.120> they<00:05:33.210> have<00:05:33.330> taken<00:05:33.539> it<00:05:33.750> out

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:33.870 
silent footstep they have taken it out

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:35.719 
silent footstep they have taken it out
but<00:05:34.289> I<00:05:34.320> believe<00:05:34.770> that<00:05:34.949> now<00:05:35.070> they<00:05:35.250> put<00:05:35.460> it<00:05:35.550> back

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:35.729 
but I believe that now they put it back

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:37.969 
but I believe that now they put it back
so<00:05:36.000> you<00:05:36.330> got<00:05:36.570> to<00:05:36.690> still<00:05:36.930> beware<00:05:37.320> for<00:05:37.830> those

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:37.979 
so you got to still beware for those

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:39.560 
so you got to still beware for those
guys<00:05:38.190> they<00:05:38.430> have<00:05:38.550> amplifier<00:05:39.060> which<00:05:39.270> comes

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:39.570 
guys they have amplifier which comes

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:41.390 
guys they have amplifier which comes
into<00:05:39.780> play<00:05:40.050> with<00:05:40.470> the<00:05:40.650> next<00:05:40.949> perk<00:05:41.190> that's

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:41.400 
into play with the next perk that's

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:43.040 
into play with the next perk that's
coming<00:05:41.729> up<00:05:41.820> in<00:05:42.000> the<00:05:42.120> list<00:05:42.300> which<00:05:42.479> is<00:05:42.600> amplify

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.050 
coming up in the list which is amplify

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.379 
coming up in the list which is amplify
itself<00:05:43.380> and<00:05:43.620> it<00:05:43.979> obviously<00:05:44.490> allows<00:05:44.850> us<00:05:45.120> to

00:05:45.379 --> 00:05:45.389 
itself and it obviously allows us to

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:47.689 
itself and it obviously allows us to
hear<00:05:45.570> footsteps<00:05:45.930> louder<00:05:46.620> and<00:05:47.010> if<00:05:47.490> I'm<00:05:47.669> not

00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:47.699 
hear footsteps louder and if I'm not

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:50.150 
hear footsteps louder and if I'm not
mistaken<00:05:47.930> when<00:05:48.930> you<00:05:49.080> have<00:05:49.199> amplified<00:05:49.919> and

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:50.160 
mistaken when you have amplified and

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:52.580 
mistaken when you have amplified and
dead<00:05:50.400> silence<00:05:50.639> together<00:05:51.210> you<00:05:51.930> literally<00:05:52.380> like

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:52.590 
dead silence together you literally like

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:55.279 
dead silence together you literally like
minimize<00:05:53.160> your<00:05:53.550> friendly<00:05:54.050> footsteps<00:05:55.050> you

00:05:55.279 --> 00:05:55.289 
minimize your friendly footsteps you

00:05:55.289 --> 00:05:56.750 
minimize your friendly footsteps you
know<00:05:55.320> you<00:05:55.440> can't<00:05:55.770> really<00:05:55.979> hear<00:05:56.280> the<00:05:56.520> footsteps

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:56.760 
know you can't really hear the footsteps
