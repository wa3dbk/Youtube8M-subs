just wanna point out is quite important

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:48.570 
just wanna point out is quite important
that<00:02:46.060> just<00:02:46.420> because<00:02:46.750> these<00:02:47.380> numbers<00:02:47.739> work<00:02:48.370> for

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
that just because these numbers work for

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.070 
that just because these numbers work for
our<00:02:48.730> goal<00:02:48.970> it<00:02:49.150> doesn't<00:02:49.480> mean<00:02:49.630> that<00:02:49.660> they<00:02:49.959> will

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
our goal it doesn't mean that they will

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.370 
our goal it doesn't mean that they will
work<00:02:50.290> for<00:02:51.299> normal<00:02:52.299> created<00:02:52.870> characters

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
work for normal created characters

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.589 
work for normal created characters
because<00:02:53.920> the<00:02:54.549> face<00:02:54.790> shapes<00:02:55.330> are<00:02:55.569> different

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:55.599 
because the face shapes are different

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:58.020 
because the face shapes are different
and<00:02:56.049> it<00:02:56.110> actually<00:02:56.260> really<00:02:56.680> does<00:02:56.799> affect<00:02:57.310> the

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
and it actually really does affect the

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.599 
and it actually really does affect the
positioning<00:02:58.630> and<00:02:58.720> the<00:02:58.810> numbers<00:02:59.200> of<00:02:59.320> the<00:02:59.440> eyes

00:02:59.599 --> 00:02:59.609 
positioning and the numbers of the eyes

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:05.099 
positioning and the numbers of the eyes
