it is now this is one of the key
features<00:00:35.880> that<00:00:36.180> i<00:00:36.270> liked<00:00:36.450> about<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.780> stand

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
placed on the stand and it does a great

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.830 
placed on the stand and it does a great

job of keeping the cables need and

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.830 
job of keeping the cables need and
well-hidden<00:00:46.530> I<00:00:46.800> think<00:00:47.149> now<00:00:48.149> as<00:00:48.329> far<00:00:48.539> as<00:00:48.600> what

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
well-hidden I think now as far as what

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.630 
well-hidden I think now as far as what
the<00:00:48.960> stand<00:00:49.230> is<00:00:49.379> made<00:00:49.559> out<00:00:49.739> of<00:00:49.770> its<00:00:50.070> aluminum

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
the stand is made out of its aluminum

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.549 
the stand is made out of its aluminum
with<00:00:50.879> rubber<00:00:51.390> reinforcement<00:00:52.199> at<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.379> lower

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
with rubber reinforcement at the lower

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.369 
with rubber reinforcement at the lower
base<00:00:53.120> making<00:00:54.120> it<00:00:54.300> not<00:00:54.480> only<00:00:54.660> a<00:00:54.840> well-designed

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
base making it not only a well-designed

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.799 
base making it not only a well-designed
but<00:00:56.039> also<00:00:56.219> Nelligan<00:00:56.820> match<00:00:57.030> and<00:00:57.329> combo<00:00:57.629> for

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
but also Nelligan match and combo for

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:01.700 
but also Nelligan match and combo for
your<00:00:57.899> iPad<00:00:58.289> it<00:00:58.890> looks<00:00:59.250> very<00:00:59.309> Apple<00:00:59.879> ish<00:01:00.710> and

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
your iPad it looks very Apple ish and

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.709 
your iPad it looks very Apple ish and
one<00:01:01.920> other<00:01:02.010> observation<00:01:02.250> on<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.180> foot<00:01:03.449> here

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
one other observation on the foot here

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.960 
one other observation on the foot here
as<00:01:03.930> you<00:01:04.049> can<00:01:04.080> see<00:01:04.350> it's<00:01:04.559> got<00:01:04.710> rubber<00:01:04.979> I<00:01:05.250> think

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
as you can see it's got rubber I think

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.640 
as you can see it's got rubber I think
it's<00:01:06.090> a<00:01:06.180> good<00:01:06.330> idea<00:01:06.510> i'm<00:01:06.900> making<00:01:07.290> sure<00:01:07.320> it

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
it's a good idea i'm making sure it

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.100 
it's a good idea i'm making sure it
doesn't<00:01:08.010> slide<00:01:08.280> or<00:01:08.520> move<00:01:08.700> around<00:01:09.060> i<00:01:09.360> think

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
doesn't slide or move around i think

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.320 
doesn't slide or move around i think
it's<00:01:10.229> really<00:01:10.560> well-built<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.640> aluminum<00:01:12.150> the

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
it's really well-built the aluminum the

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.030 
it's really well-built the aluminum the
rubber<00:01:12.540> combination<00:01:13.350> gives<00:01:13.799> it<00:01:13.979> a

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
rubber combination gives it a

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.460 
rubber combination gives it a
well-balanced<00:01:14.930> protects<00:01:15.930> really<00:01:16.229> well<00:01:16.380> from

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
well-balanced protects really well from

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.410 
well-balanced protects really well from
scratching<00:01:17.130> now<00:01:18.060> one<00:01:18.240> of<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.390> interesting

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
scratching now one of the interesting

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.660 
scratching now one of the interesting
way<00:01:19.049> that<00:01:19.080> Griffin<00:01:19.650> has<00:01:19.830> designed<00:01:20.250> for<00:01:20.549> these

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
way that Griffin has designed for these

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.359 
way that Griffin has designed for these
stands<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.240> be<00:01:21.360> used<00:01:21.630> is<00:01:21.900> in<00:01:22.590> the<00:01:22.830> position

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
stands to be used is in the position

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.460 
stands to be used is in the position
they<00:01:23.640> call<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.119> lower<00:01:24.450> risk<00:01:24.810> position<00:01:24.960> I

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
they call the lower risk position I

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.590 
they call the lower risk position I
guess<00:01:26.009> by<00:01:26.159> placing<00:01:26.430> your<00:01:26.640> iPad<00:01:27.090> on<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.330> stand

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
guess by placing your iPad on the stand

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.480 
guess by placing your iPad on the stand
and<00:01:27.869> allowing<00:01:28.320> it<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:28.439> rest<00:01:28.710> flat<00:01:29.100> on<00:01:29.430> its

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
and allowing it to rest flat on its

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.179 
and allowing it to rest flat on its
surface<00:01:30.030> thus<00:01:30.780> am<00:01:31.020> somewhat<00:01:31.619> has<00:01:31.860> enough

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
surface thus am somewhat has enough

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.640 
surface thus am somewhat has enough
elevation<00:01:32.520> and<00:01:33.119> you<00:01:33.630> get<00:01:33.780> a<00:01:33.810> viewing<00:01:34.229> angle

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
elevation and you get a viewing angle

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.819 
elevation and you get a viewing angle
it's<00:01:35.280> very<00:01:35.450> ergonomically<00:01:36.450> friendly<00:01:37.380> I<00:01:37.409> would

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
it's very ergonomically friendly I would

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.460 
it's very ergonomically friendly I would
say<00:01:38.070> now<00:01:38.909> let<00:01:39.090> me<00:01:39.119> call<00:01:39.360> up<00:01:39.390> my<00:01:39.630> calculator<00:01:40.259> up

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
say now let me call up my calculator up

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:42.740 
say now let me call up my calculator up
to<00:01:40.619> better<00:01:40.799> demonstrate<00:01:40.950> this<00:01:41.430> for<00:01:41.700> you<00:01:41.850> now

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
to better demonstrate this for you now

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.780 
to better demonstrate this for you now
this<00:01:42.899> is<00:01:43.079> not<00:01:43.259> a<00:01:43.340> position<00:01:44.340> that<00:01:44.490> I<00:01:44.610> would

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
this is not a position that I would

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.230 
this is not a position that I would
normally<00:01:44.880> use<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.420> stand<00:01:45.689> all<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:45.930> time<00:01:46.140> but

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
normally use the stand all the time but

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:51.050 
normally use the stand all the time but
it's<00:01:48.240> very<00:01:48.420> useful<00:01:49.100> I'm<00:01:50.100> sure<00:01:50.310> if<00:01:50.430> you<00:01:50.610> used<00:01:50.939> to

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
it's very useful I'm sure if you used to

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.719 
it's very useful I'm sure if you used to
working<00:01:51.390> on<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:51.659> number<00:01:51.960> pad<00:01:52.140> now<00:01:53.040> again<00:01:53.310> let

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
working on the number pad now again let

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.899 
working on the number pad now again let
me<00:01:54.030> open<00:01:54.509> it<00:01:54.810> up<00:01:54.960> here<00:01:55.200> and<00:01:55.430> let<00:01:56.430> me<00:01:56.520> just<00:01:56.729> show

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
me open it up here and let me just show

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:02.130 
me open it up here and let me just show
you<00:01:56.939> it's<00:01:57.450> dirty<00:01:57.719> see<00:01:58.439> it's<00:01:58.710> very<00:01:59.009> sturdy
