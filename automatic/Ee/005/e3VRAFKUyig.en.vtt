you<00:02:25.910> know<00:02:26.300> obviously<00:02:27.140> when<00:02:27.440> we<00:02:27.590> lived<00:02:27.769> in

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
you know obviously when we lived in

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.530 
you know obviously when we lived in
Europe<00:02:28.250> they<00:02:28.430> played<00:02:28.670> soccer<00:02:28.970> a<00:02:29.150> lot<00:02:29.209> more

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
Europe they played soccer a lot more

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.710 
Europe they played soccer a lot more
than<00:02:29.750> they<00:02:29.900> do<00:02:30.319> over<00:02:30.739> here<00:02:30.769> but<00:02:31.390> you<00:02:32.390> know<00:02:32.510> what

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
than they do over here but you know what

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.750 
than they do over here but you know what
I<00:02:32.750> think<00:02:33.470> it's<00:02:33.680> so<00:02:33.830> important<00:02:34.250> that<00:02:34.400> kids<00:02:34.580> are

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
I think it's so important that kids are

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.430 
I think it's so important that kids are
involved<00:02:35.150> in<00:02:35.269> sport<00:02:35.599> because<00:02:35.810> it<00:02:35.959> keeps<00:02:36.080> them

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
involved in sport because it keeps them

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.170 
involved in sport because it keeps them
you<00:02:36.950> know<00:02:37.040> off<00:02:37.160> the<00:02:37.190> streets<00:02:37.640> and<00:02:37.849> it<00:02:37.970> gives

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
you know off the streets and it gives

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.930 
you know off the streets and it gives
them<00:02:38.330> that<00:02:38.540> kind<00:02:38.870> of<00:02:39.400> competitive<00:02:40.400> edge<00:02:40.610> that

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
them that kind of competitive edge that

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.940 
them that kind of competitive edge that
I<00:02:40.970> think<00:02:41.390> you<00:02:41.780> know<00:02:41.930> is<00:02:42.080> great<00:02:42.560> for<00:02:42.769> kids

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
I think you know is great for kids

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:44.979 
I think you know is great for kids
sometimes<00:02:43.549> you<00:02:43.670> have<00:02:43.790> to<00:02:43.940> lose<00:02:44.120> to<00:02:44.450> be<00:02:44.750> able<00:02:44.900> to

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:44.989 
sometimes you have to lose to be able to

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:46.990 
sometimes you have to lose to be able to
appreciate<00:02:45.200> women<00:02:45.560> without<00:02:46.040> a<00:02:46.250> doubt<00:02:46.489> and<00:02:46.730> to

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
appreciate women without a doubt and to

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.180 
appreciate women without a doubt and to
be<00:02:47.090> honest<00:02:47.330> when<00:02:47.599> my<00:02:47.720> boys<00:02:47.959> lose<00:02:48.290> they're<00:02:49.010> as

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
be honest when my boys lose they're as

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.070 
be honest when my boys lose they're as
bad<00:02:49.370> as<00:02:49.549> me<00:02:49.760> when<00:02:49.940> I<00:02:49.970> lose<00:02:50.269> so<00:02:50.629> you<00:02:50.959> know

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
bad as me when I lose so you know

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.110 
bad as me when I lose so you know
they've<00:02:51.319> definitely<00:02:51.860> got<00:02:52.129> that<00:02:52.340> competitive

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
they've definitely got that competitive

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.550 
they've definitely got that competitive
but<00:02:53.239> I<00:02:53.330> think<00:02:53.569> that's<00:02:53.720> okay<00:02:54.019> because<00:02:54.200> you<00:02:54.470> know

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
but I think that's okay because you know

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.140 
but I think that's okay because you know
kids<00:02:54.799> now<00:02:55.010> in<00:02:55.040> school<00:02:55.430> they<00:02:55.579> jump<00:02:55.910> rope

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150 
kids now in school they jump rope

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.900 
kids now in school they jump rope
without<00:02:56.599> a<00:02:56.630> rope<00:02:56.930> that's<00:02:57.709> okay<00:02:58.099> so<00:02:58.640> there's<00:02:58.849> no

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
without a rope that's okay so there's no

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.850 
without a rope that's okay so there's no
failure<00:02:59.450> this<00:02:59.599> is<00:02:59.660> like<00:02:59.900> your<00:03:00.019> great<00:03:00.500> Oh

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
and I don't get too low when things are

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.710

going<00:04:35.760> tough<00:04:36.060> and<00:04:36.690> I<00:04:36.870> think<00:04:37.140> that<00:04:38.330> that<00:04:39.330> has

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
going tough and I think that that has

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.980 
going tough and I think that that has
helped<00:04:40.110> me<00:04:40.860> and<00:04:41.130> the<00:04:41.460> organization<00:04:41.990> stay

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:42.990 
helped me and the organization stay

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:46.070 
helped me and the organization stay
