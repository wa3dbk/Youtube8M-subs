I am in the room waiting for Santa and for Claus.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.560
Suddenly, by night, they will arrive

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:49.520
can't you feel the typical cling cling cling cling cling?

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.640
Presents for the good, coal for the bad

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:01.960
proprio come diceva mia mamma

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.700
Christmas with the yours, Easter what you want

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.360
Peace between Blur and Oasis

Christmas with the yours, Easter what you want

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:28.280
Dont't throw atomic bombs because it's Christmas time

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:47.940
Panettone is on the table, and everybody's drinking Moscato

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:54.220
Go to buy a tree, but not a true tree

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:01.100
because otherwise it would die die die die die 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:06.980
Panettone is on the table but it is another one

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.800
infatti Ã¨ quello senza canditi!!!

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:20.600
Christmas with the yours, Easter what you want 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:27.040
Peace between Lino e Cecchetto

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:33.440
Christmas with the yours, Easter what you want

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:39.960
Don't drop atomic bombs at least at Christmas time

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:04.560
Proprio come diceva mia mamma

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:11.960
Sai cosa diceva mia mamma?

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:18.200
Christmas with the yours, Easter what you want

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:23.800
Peace between Lino e Cecchetto

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:31.280
Christmas with the yours, Easter what you want

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:37.800
