00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 hello dear partridges I want to teach 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:06.779
 make the gift pouches are super 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:08.429
 easy to do it and from now on 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:10.740
 forward you will not have to return them to 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.750
 buy and you can make them with your 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.940
 own designs or with the paper that most 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.470
 you like the materials that 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:21.180
 we will need are decorated papers 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:23.369
 the bigger the bigger leaf 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.750
 the gift sleeve will come out 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.029
 download these ccoo papers 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.920
 printables of the website the links in 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.570
 the description of the video or 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.369
 You can buy decorated paper in your 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.870
 nearest store 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:39.500
 we will use scissors and thread or rope and 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.500
 glue 

00:00:41.089 --> 00:00:46.109
 we will take the leaf and on the longer side 

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:48.949
 we will do a fold to generate a 

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:48.949
 small flap 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:55.070
 we will put gum in it 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:58.870
 and then we will bring the upper end and 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.870
 we will stick it on top of this lapel 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.190
 ah 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.050
 now we will make another fold in one of 

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.490
 the ends of about 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:15.420
 three centimeters wide 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.420
 no no 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:21.690
 and will do the same with the opposite end 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.410
 try that the two folds have the 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.410
 same width 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.060
 now we unfold and we will send the 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.360
 folds inwards opening the 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.360
 cast 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.920
 ah 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.920
 Y 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.570
 these folds must remain as one 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.570
 kind of accordion 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.460
 now at the bottom we will perform 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.110
 another doubles this should be a little more 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.110
 big than the previous folds 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:05.070
 we will talk to you and open the fundita and 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:08.990
 we will begin to cut at the ends 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.990
 until you reach the doubles line 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.120
 we will have left a kind of flaps 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:18.550
 we'll have the flaps on the ends 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:21.210
 inwards and we will put rubber 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.210
 ah 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.220
 then we will stick the flaps on top of 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.220
 these 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.690
 no no 

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.970
 Y 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.140
 now we will begin to close the fundita and 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.280
 when we are arriving at the part 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.230
 lower 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.819
 we will begin to bend it with much 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.510
 Be careful to mark the folds 

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:46.510
 in diagonal 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.730
 and we'll end up sending everything to a 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.730
 side 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.870
 and now you have your finished bag 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:02.690
 now all that remains is to put the thread in this 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.489
 case I'm putting hemp thread for 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:08.530
 we just have to make a knot and 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:08.530
 go through the gaps that we will have made 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.019
 and you have finished your gift coins 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:15.489
 as you see are super simple to do and 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:17.590
 now you will not have to buy them 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:20.819
 you can make them yourself and as you see it 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.819
 super fast to do 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.040
 or not 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.480
 and if you do this craft do not forget 

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:31.620
 to send me photos to social networks 

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.720
