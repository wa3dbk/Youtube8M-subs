commentaries in this channel so my scuf

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.670 
commentaries in this channel so my scuf
controller<00:00:42.239> i<00:00:42.329> sent<00:00:42.570> it<00:00:42.660> back<00:00:42.780> exactly<00:00:43.110> a<00:00:43.500> week

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
controller i sent it back exactly a week

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.529 
controller i sent it back exactly a week
ago<00:00:43.980> for<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.489> past<00:00:44.730> seven<00:00:45.059> days<00:00:45.090> i've<00:00:45.420> been

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
ago for the past seven days i've been

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:46.639 
ago for the past seven days i've been
playing<00:00:45.690> with<00:00:45.809> just<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.050> normal<00:00:46.230> controller

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
playing with just a normal controller

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.150 
playing with just a normal controller
and<00:00:46.920> for<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:48.539> past<00:00:48.719> two<00:00:49.050> months<00:00:49.260> or<00:00:49.530> since<00:00:50.010> i

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
and for the past two months or since i

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.650 
and for the past two months or since i
got<00:00:50.250> myself<00:00:50.399> controller<00:00:50.879> I've<00:00:51.270> been<00:00:51.480> dealing

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
got myself controller I've been dealing

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.240 
got myself controller I've been dealing
with<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:52.050> biggest<00:00:52.500> problem<00:00:52.620> in<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.070> world

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
with the biggest problem in the world

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.340 
with the biggest problem in the world
and<00:00:53.550> it<00:00:53.879> became<00:00:54.090> worse<00:00:54.329> throughout<00:00:54.719> time<00:00:55.020> so

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
and it became worse throughout time so

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.139 
and it became worse throughout time so
the<00:00:55.739> right<00:00:55.949> analog<00:00:56.219> which<00:00:56.520> is<00:00:56.670> basically<00:00:57.030> a

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
the right analog which is basically a

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.869 
the right analog which is basically a
key<00:00:57.480> to<00:00:57.719> call<00:00:57.930> of<00:00:58.050> duty<00:00:58.289> it<00:00:58.710> was<00:00:58.980> broken<00:00:59.430> so<00:00:59.460> if

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
key to call of duty it was broken so if

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.849 
key to call of duty it was broken so if
you<00:01:00.030> move<00:01:00.210> up<00:01:00.420> move<00:01:00.870> left<00:01:01.140> move<00:01:01.320> right<00:01:01.649> move

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
you move up move left move right move

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.520 
you move up move left move right move
down<00:01:02.100> and<00:01:02.340> you<00:01:02.670> move<00:01:02.940> up<00:01:02.969> like<00:01:03.510> far<00:01:03.960> enough<00:01:04.199> it

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
down and you move up like far enough it

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.380 
down and you move up like far enough it
will<00:01:04.890> go<00:01:05.040> even<00:01:05.189> higher<00:01:05.460> by<00:01:05.729> itself<00:01:06.000> so<00:01:06.210> I<00:01:06.240> had

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
will go even higher by itself so I had

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.090 
will go even higher by itself so I had
to<00:01:06.420> be<00:01:06.570> aware<00:01:06.840> making<00:01:07.229> sure<00:01:07.409> I<00:01:07.470> don't<00:01:07.560> go<00:01:08.070> up

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
to be aware making sure I don't go up

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.670 
to be aware making sure I don't go up
too<00:01:08.460> fast<00:01:08.490> because<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.420> analog<00:01:10.110> will<00:01:10.320> go<00:01:10.470> up

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
too fast because the analog will go up

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.920 
too fast because the analog will go up
even<00:01:10.799> further<00:01:11.130> so<00:01:11.460> picture<00:01:12.330> this<00:01:12.479> I'm<00:01:12.750> in

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
even further so picture this I'm in

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.420 
even further so picture this I'm in

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.359 
high to get to kick get the kill top on
because<00:01:22.350> it<00:01:22.560> will<00:01:22.680> go<00:01:22.799> even<00:01:22.950> higher<00:01:23.130> and<00:01:23.310> I'll

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
because it will go even higher and I'll

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.760 
because it will go even higher and I'll
just<00:01:23.520> die<00:01:23.700> so<00:01:24.060> that's<00:01:24.600> basically<00:01:25.080> it's<00:01:25.590> very

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
just die so that's basically it's very

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.830 
just die so that's basically it's very
hard<00:01:25.979> to<00:01:26.009> explain<00:01:26.130> that<00:01:26.549> problem<00:01:27.090> but<00:01:27.299> other

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
hard to explain that problem but other

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.020 
hard to explain that problem but other
than<00:01:28.049> that<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.409> left<00:01:28.590> analog<00:01:28.799> had<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.820> same

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
than that the left analog had the same

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.819 
than that the left analog had the same
similar<00:01:30.420> problem<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:30.960> right<00:01:31.110> analog<00:01:31.470> but

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
similar problem to the right analog but

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.789 
similar problem to the right analog but
just<00:01:31.950> not<00:01:32.040> as<00:01:32.100> much<00:01:32.369> and<00:01:32.729> then<00:01:33.119> left<00:01:33.360> trigger

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:33.799 
just not as much and then left trigger

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:36.140 
just not as much and then left trigger
the<00:01:34.799> foam<00:01:35.040> thing<00:01:35.220> that<00:01:35.369> stops<00:01:35.579> it<00:01:35.729> from<00:01:35.759> making

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
the foam thing that stops it from making

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.789 
the foam thing that stops it from making
noise<00:01:36.299> when<00:01:36.479> you<00:01:36.509> click<00:01:36.750> it<00:01:36.960> it<00:01:37.110> fell<00:01:37.320> off<00:01:37.350> and

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
noise when you click it it fell off and

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.230 
noise when you click it it fell off and
then<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.189> paddle<00:01:38.520> screws<00:01:38.729> and<00:01:38.909> tighten<00:01:39.060> up

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
then the paddle screws and tighten up

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.420 
then the paddle screws and tighten up
anymore<00:01:39.509> so<00:01:39.840> every<00:01:40.200> time<00:01:40.229> I<00:01:40.650> click<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.130> paddle

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
anymore so every time I click the paddle

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:42.770 
anymore so every time I click the paddle
how<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.549> make<00:01:41.729> sure<00:01:41.850> they'll<00:01:42.000> click<00:01:42.270> it<00:01:42.390> enough

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
how to make sure they'll click it enough

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.690 
how to make sure they'll click it enough
