00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.119
 start 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.330
 As you know, I already said the last 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.570

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:41.570
 the maximum amount of ram me as you see 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.570
 16 GB 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.079
 you give to no start that is the 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:50.960
 little screen that puts you before you start 

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:53.260
 and you give 30 to 15 seconds 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.870
 15 seconds 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:57.360
 A) Yes 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:02:00.170
 I'm going to leave it at 30 because I can not 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:03.300
 change the computer because it's not mine yes 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:08.450
 yes it's mine but it's a roll here 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:08.450
 and then that fails services 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:14.340
 deactivate all programs that do not 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.709
 miss 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.050

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:24.080

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.400
