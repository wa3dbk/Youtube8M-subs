00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.830
 to create this bmw motorcycle has not been 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.559
 taken advantage of no mechanical basis 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:39.930
 known because the scooter sector demands 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.210
 be something very different the engine and 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.650
 transmission of the 600 sports form 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.690
 an independent set of the 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:48.329
 rear suspension thus following the 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.100
 path marked by the yamaha from max to 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.989
 not have to support the weight of parts 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.550
 of the engine the rear suspension is now 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.550
 much more stable and comfortable 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.690
 and 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.320
 the transmission is composed of a 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:16.290
 mechanical variator and a clutch 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.460
 centrifugal shoe chassis features 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.490
 with a rigid inverted fork 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.500
 front and a large single-arm swingarm 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.390
 rear all with a body of 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.490
 sports forms with protection 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.380
 unsurpassed from the wind or cold too 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:31.490
 with more comfortable seats and a greater 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.490
 load capacity 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.770
 when you get on and you start up 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.500
 The CSI hundreds of esports is done 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.299
 tremendously agile the touch of the gas is 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.850
 very direct and the engine pushes with force 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:58.280
 the posture is perfect with a lot of space 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.560
 to put the feet to taste the braking 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.619
 It is powerful and safe thanks to the abs of 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:02.619
 series 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:23.319
 precisely in series this scooter comes 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.090
 very well equipped for example with the 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:27.340
 flexible hollow bottom under the seat 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.560
 that allows to save a second helmet 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.910
 It also has pressure sensors 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.910
