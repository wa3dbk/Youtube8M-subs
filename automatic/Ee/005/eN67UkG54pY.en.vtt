00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160
 I spent so much time climbed on 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.710
 people who don't even know there 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.050
 amazing how disgusting can 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.480
 be people depending on the circumstances 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.849
 most people are normal while they have 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.130
 everything is fine with themselves but if you change 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.109
 your circumstances change well here 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.199
 for example when I am in my car 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.359
 completely different set of values when 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.910
 i get behind the wheel i get worse 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.609
 man on earth you are not to the same this 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.439
 the worst person is very dangerous and it is in 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.960
 the moment you should be more 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.969
 impassive focused than in any 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.850
 another time because you control 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.950
 deadly thing deadly 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.219
 a monster and people become 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.649
 terrible i myself terrible once i rode and 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:48.300
 here is the guy in front of me but he kind of 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.440
 wagged a little along the way 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.050
 a second or two 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.910
 I broke off straight I said well 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.910
 and shit you're a piece 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:07.300
 Th for it to present such how is it 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:11.240
 can talk about a human being 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:13.570
 a piece of nothingness long ago it and someone else too 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.570
 a son 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:22.190
 what things I say to other people once 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:27.980
 food and next guy in a pickup I don't even 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:30.380
 remember he made my screamer go to 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:37.070
 what place of the earth besides the car is it 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:38.530
 not at least a little ok 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.180
 for example you are in an elevator 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.760
 here you are standing with someone almost to him 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:46.010
 clinging but he is a little bit on you 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:48.380
 let's say leaned and you turn 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:02:00.160
 court and to face action you tell them 

00:01:48.380 --> 00:02:00.160
 fuck you a worthless piece of shit 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:08.810
 no yes no you in the world did not 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.150
 do but put between two people 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.850
 two windows and a piece of the road there is nothing 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.990
 lest they tell each other yes 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.830
 you died 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:19.940
 I told someone so yes yes that you 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.250
 died 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.260
 why yes because i had to 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.600
 slightly turn the wheel half a second 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:32.930
 life is gone 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:36.819
 why did you check my reaction and your children 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.819
 I hope they will grow up without a mother 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.470
 I am capable of anything 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:53.670
 i think i'm a nice dude 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.670
 then I doubt all the circumstances such
