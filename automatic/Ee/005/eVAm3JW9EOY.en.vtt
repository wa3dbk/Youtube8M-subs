00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
K bar don't quote me on that because I'm

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:24.660 
K bar don't quote me on that because I'm
not<00:01:15.770> sure<00:01:16.539> certain<00:01:18.729> it<00:01:19.729> is<00:01:20.149> I<00:01:20.979> believe<00:01:23.109> 6<00:01:24.109> and

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
not sure certain it is I believe 6 and

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.169 
not sure certain it is I believe 6 and
3/4<00:01:25.670> inch<00:01:25.880> overall<00:01:26.420> the<00:01:27.319> cutting<00:01:27.950> edge<00:01:28.189> which

00:01:29.169 --> 00:01:29.179 
3/4 inch overall the cutting edge which

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:33.580 
3/4 inch overall the cutting edge which
is<00:01:29.210> this<00:01:29.509> edge<00:01:29.749> right<00:01:29.829> there<00:01:30.829> is<00:01:31.869> 3<00:01:32.869> and<00:01:33.139> 1/4

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
is this edge right there is 3 and 1/4

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:40.389 
is this edge right there is 3 and 1/4
inch<00:01:34.960> it<00:01:35.960> has<00:01:36.469> a<00:01:36.889> black<00:01:37.280> coating<00:01:39.100> as<00:01:40.100> you<00:01:40.280> can

00:01:40.389 --> 00:01:40.399 
inch it has a black coating as you can

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:43.539 
inch it has a black coating as you can
see<00:01:41.049> so<00:01:42.049> it's<00:01:42.170> non<00:01:42.350> reflective<00:01:42.590> and<00:01:43.159> that

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549 
see so it's non reflective and that

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:48.129 
see so it's non reflective and that
coating<00:01:43.969> also<00:01:44.149> helps<00:01:44.299> it<00:01:44.719> from<00:01:46.060> from<00:01:47.139> rusting

00:01:48.129 --> 00:01:48.139 
coating also helps it from from rusting

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:51.870 
coating also helps it from from rusting
or<00:01:48.469> corroding<00:01:49.270> what<00:01:50.270> I<00:01:50.299> did<00:01:50.749> though<00:01:50.990> was<00:01:51.259> I

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
or corroding what I did though was I

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:57.999 
or corroding what I did though was I
sanded<00:01:53.469> the<00:01:54.469> blade<00:01:55.209> with<00:01:56.209> a<00:01:56.240> fine<00:01:56.990> sandpaper

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
sanded the blade with a fine sandpaper

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:00.069 
sanded the blade with a fine sandpaper
so<00:01:58.280> that<00:01:58.490> it<00:01:58.609> I<00:01:58.789> took<00:01:59.090> the<00:01:59.270> black<00:01:59.569> finish<00:01:59.899> off

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:00.079 
so that it I took the black finish off

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:04.959 
so that it I took the black finish off
and<00:02:00.380> then<00:02:01.249> I<00:02:02.200> left<00:02:03.200> it<00:02:03.409> in<00:02:03.619> a<00:02:04.100> cup<00:02:04.520> of<00:02:04.700> vinegar

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:04.969 
and then I left it in a cup of vinegar

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:08.889 
and then I left it in a cup of vinegar
just<00:02:05.899> plain<00:02:06.529> I<00:02:06.920> think<00:02:07.819> it's<00:02:07.909> called<00:02:08.149> white

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
just plain I think it's called white

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.140 
just plain I think it's called white
distilled<00:02:09.350> vinegar<00:02:09.679> or<00:02:10.220> something<00:02:10.429> to<00:02:11.030> that

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
distilled vinegar or something to that

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.460 
distilled vinegar or something to that
effect<00:02:12.159> overnight<00:02:13.159> and<00:02:13.370> as<00:02:14.239> you<00:02:14.360> can<00:02:14.480> see<00:02:14.659> the

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
effect overnight and as you can see the

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:16.530 
effect overnight and as you can see the
color<00:02:15.769> is

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
color is

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.649 
color is
about<00:02:16.810> the<00:02:16.959> same<00:02:17.200> as<00:02:17.500> the<00:02:17.920> handle<00:02:18.299> so<00:02:19.299> didn't

00:02:19.649 --> 00:02:19.659 
about the same as the handle so didn't

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:23.490 
about the same as the handle so didn't
change<00:02:19.840> it<00:02:19.959> color<00:02:20.170> much<00:02:20.439> but<00:02:21.930> what<00:02:22.930> the

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
change it color much but what the

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.069 
change it color much but what the
difference<00:02:23.950> is<00:02:24.340> is<00:02:24.879> now<00:02:25.329> instead<00:02:25.870> of<00:02:25.930> having

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:26.079 
difference is is now instead of having

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:28.679 
difference is is now instead of having
this<00:02:26.379> black<00:02:26.709> coating<00:02:27.189> on<00:02:27.340> it<00:02:27.489> which<00:02:28.180> will<00:02:28.450> not

00:02:28.679 --> 00:02:28.689 
this black coating on it which will not

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:30.539 
this black coating on it which will not
strike<00:02:29.079> on<00:02:29.260> a<00:02:29.290> fire<00:02:29.530> okay<00:02:29.859> so<00:02:30.219> now<00:02:30.340> we're<00:02:30.459> going

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:30.549 
strike on a fire okay so now we're going

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:33.990 
strike on a fire okay so now we're going
to<00:02:30.640> go<00:02:30.730> over<00:02:30.760> the<00:02:30.939> sheath<00:02:31.620> this<00:02:32.620> is<00:02:32.799> a<00:02:33.099> glass

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.000 
to go over the sheath this is a glass

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.740 
to go over the sheath this is a glass
filled<00:02:34.480> nylon<00:02:34.870> sheath<00:02:35.769> it<00:02:36.400> is<00:02:36.790> not<00:02:37.120> Kydex

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:37.750 
filled nylon sheath it is not Kydex

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.330 
filled nylon sheath it is not Kydex
glass<00:02:38.590> filled<00:02:39.040> nylon<00:02:41.159> personally<00:02:42.159> I've<00:02:42.310> never

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
glass filled nylon personally I've never

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.759 
glass filled nylon personally I've never
had<00:02:42.970> a<00:02:43.000> Kydex<00:02:43.329> sheath<00:02:43.629> so<00:02:44.230> I<00:02:44.260> don't<00:02:44.560> know<00:02:44.650> what

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
had a Kydex sheath so I don't know what

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:48.289 
had a Kydex sheath so I don't know what
the<00:02:44.859> difference<00:02:44.950> is<00:02:45.629> as<00:02:46.650> you<00:02:47.650> can<00:02:47.769> see<00:02:47.980> it's

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:48.299 
the difference is as you can see it's

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:54.920 
the difference is as you can see it's
form-fitting<00:02:49.590> it's<00:02:51.209> has<00:02:52.209> a<00:02:52.239> really<00:02:52.780> snug<00:02:53.170> fit

right here with my fire steel under that

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.099 
right here with my fire steel under that
and<00:03:13.989> then<00:03:14.260> under<00:03:14.829> the<00:03:15.040> first<00:03:15.569> bicycle<00:03:16.569> tube<00:03:16.810> I

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:17.109 
and then under the first bicycle tube I

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:23.939 
and then under the first bicycle tube I
have<00:03:19.019> some<00:03:20.190> Bank<00:03:21.190> line<00:03:22.049> which<00:03:23.049> is<00:03:23.290> pretty

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:23.949

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
coating on it that makes it water

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.349 
coating on it that makes it water
resistant<00:03:32.609> what<00:03:33.609> I<00:03:33.639> did<00:03:33.970> was<00:03:34.239> I<00:03:34.269> took<00:03:34.479> the

resistant what I did was I took the

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:39.949 
resistant what I did was I took the
lengths<00:03:37.359> of<00:03:37.449> paracord<00:03:38.049> that<00:03:38.319> they<00:03:38.500> give<00:03:38.769> you

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
lengths of paracord that they give you

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:45.180 
lengths of paracord that they give you
which<00:03:40.959> is<00:03:41.199> about<00:03:41.650> 7<00:03:42.519> foot<00:03:42.879> and<00:03:43.769> I<00:03:44.769> didn't

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
which is about 7 foot and I didn't

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.009 
which is about 7 foot and I didn't
really<00:03:45.340> want<00:03:45.489> to<00:03:45.519> use<00:03:45.699> that<00:03:45.940> so<00:03:46.329> I<00:03:46.359> cut<00:03:46.780> a<00:03:46.810> piece

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:47.019 
really want to use that so I cut a piece

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:49.589 
really want to use that so I cut a piece
off<00:03:47.260> and<00:03:47.560> I<00:03:48.310> put<00:03:48.549> it<00:03:48.639> through<00:03:48.879> these<00:03:49.209> holes

00:03:49.589 --> 00:03:49.599 
off and I put it through these holes

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:51.289
