 Now yes, yes, I will not leave without 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.960
 gameplay here in luque town and also in 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.000
 the next game is to the truth that 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:43.180
 I was pretty good but I liked it better 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.340
 it's on top also the game is super 

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.690
 cut the only good thing I've put the 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.820
 piece of the mega low 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.650
 and then it's a little bit longer but 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:53.410
 well I the truth that 

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:55.540
 I was in the mood for it, and well 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:57.940
 Today is also the day of luque town by 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:01.510
 what because I have uploaded the black ops the 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:05.470
 first that came out and that map came out 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:08.350
 not that maybe 2025 that I think 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.450
 what is this logo to I do not know that I do not know how 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.580
 I do it for real I promise it or not 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.320
 I know how I do it but I always invent 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.300
 the name the moment is good and what 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.880
 Well the other day by twitter besides that 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:21.040
 I'm super bad for names games 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.680
 for the faces and the truth that a face 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:26.860
 I 'm never forgetting to know but yes 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:29.950
 for the names I'm a bit crappy but 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.360
 good is that the truth that makes grace 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.000
 especially when they introduce you to someone 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:36.760
 that you know and looks at you this was a half 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.860
 of course well yes there are very well says 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:42.150
 forgive such I am very sorry 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.150
 sorry to know it well 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:48.490
 then it's a bit that's a little 

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:50.679
 true and good what I said I've seen 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.600
 that you really liked the game that 

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:55.390
 I uploaded to and maintaining water and 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.189
 cable and aunts my mother and how have you thrown 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.719
 with a shit milk were smashed 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:03.069
 in party for the metal although badly they have 

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:04.709
 cut off at that time week today 

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:07.360
 I'm studying ankle, I'm really good 

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:10.660
 summarizing that I have seen that we use the 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:12.519
 It's pretty worth the game that Luque 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.670
 town good especially not that they are a 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:16.329
 such but good as it has gone up the 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.640
 first white 

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:21.190
 let's leave it only in black ops 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:22.959
 well to dry and well then we also 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:24.610
 went up pretty cool golf ar 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:27.579
 3 then well then apart from 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:30.819
 go up other games like to try to 

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:33.519
 the zombies or ni for speed or be some 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:35.709
 little thing out there that other then from time to time 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:38.650
 when I upload this also because I 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:41.709
 mola is fine and also because I know 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:44.260
 are games that I'm not tired a lot 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:46.720
 less and I'm on top of power there you know 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.950
 and there is certainly one thing that you 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.610
 I wanted to comment very important 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:54.790
 very important and remember that the other 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:56.349
 day you told me in the comments what 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.940
 comets reluctance is playing 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:59.590
 reluctance game another game that you like 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.110
 something that you like I have always said 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.849
 that this game is cool to me, it's me 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.190
 why I play this game is that is if 

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:08.620
 I would not play this game but it's good 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:11.620
 Above all, it was the subject of what 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.870
 of lifting in the morning then playing 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.420
 I played well because I played well and such 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:19.330
 Only then, when commenting on it, you can tell me 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.890
 espesito let's leave it there 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.620
 they cross me then do not look at the 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.959
 sides and such and then he is what 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.090
 it usually happens that in the morning her boyfriend 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:29.680
 I'm also very typical that when 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.560
 get up when I get up by the 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.480
 mornings pgr flipa moments in the morning 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.500
 I feel like there's some face like that 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:40.780
 of half wet and I do not know honestly 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:42.579
 I love people who get up by 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:45.519
 the mornings with a smiley face like 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:47.769
 saying to me how happy there comes, let's go to 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:49.660
 run there come I do not need a 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:52.569
 adaptation time then nothing is , 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:54.910
 then it started up pim pam pim pam 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:58.300
 but that I know is first 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:04:01.410
 and now not that critical area that's there 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:04.540
 and it is also that yesterday 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:06.280
 I threw myself out of bed I went there to record 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.530
 the success then I am good then 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.350
 maybe I notice a little more of 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:13.570
 you win and for August 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:15.550
 but what will remain kids about that 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:18.280
 otherwise I would have uploaded other games 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:20.680
 It is already directly that I know or one day 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:22.540
 me the highs there were white two or me that 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.520
 if there are a lot of games so do not 

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:27.610
 nothing happens if I do not really go up 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:29.950
 that's why I'm really cool 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.270
 Well, that's sometimes good 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.980
 Well, you want another game because this one 

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:35.410
 We've been kids for almost two years now 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:41.250
 We are there to pipe from the mouth and 

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:41.250

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:48.610

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:53.440
 low we won 74 7 to her top of payment in 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:55.630
 the truth is that that's why he also molded me 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:58.240
 very much and also it was very fast be 

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:00.010
 we killed the two teams a lot and it was like that 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.200
 good cool this from my team is a 

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:03.120
