00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 Now I will teach you how to fix the 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.130
 electronic pedal for machine 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.319
 stitching of all threads 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.260
 here I have in my hands the simple pedal 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:13.200
 that the triangular pin has the pedal 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:16.320
 jim the global model and has pedal 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.660
 fashion than the rectangular model 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.760
 then all all models pedal 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.369
 works in the system are the electronics 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.500
 there are the ancients who were electrical 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.410
 I have at hand an engine model of 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.359
 angular the engine of the fashion model and 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.070
 tools I needed to work on 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.960
 so let's do some testing for 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.989
 be able to identify defects such as 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:40.770
 time in. I can test the cable. 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:46.440
 a terminal port here 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:48.090
 and another that means that side of the son 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.260
 It's not bad, I'm going to switch now to 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.129
 other side 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:58.260
 It's going to be one of those 25 here's this here. 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:01:01.590
 the other is going to be a blast now let's go 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.850
 test the leg that goes to the pedal to 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.710
 open the pedal, I'll have to do the 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:08.939
 next with a ball screwdriver 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:11.130
 bank wire has been fitted one side the 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.020
 box the other and costs in front wear 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.210
 ahead because I have a 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.930
 and the child is not only the 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.930
 first wire 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:25.310
 to test the wire making the following goes 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.310
 identify now which one links here 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:40.230
 one is correct the other is not going 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.980
 give because the other return that comes from 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.140
 motor 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:45.210
 so I even went out to see if the 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.140
 problem is in the end you on the board 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.730
 electronics 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.730
 I'll put these two legs together. 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.510
 I'm going to get a motor a machine has a 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.210
 engine that is working to make a 

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:59.280
 test the first is sorry if the engine 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.640
 yours is good 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:05.270
 I put the wire in the public machine on the 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.270
 power plug 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:10.290
 I'm going to start the engine 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:13.070
 in this position that the film is the engine has 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:17.580
 that work throughout his celebration 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:19.380
 and pedal son mean the end of the 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.010
 pedal is not bad the effect will be on the 

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.470
 board 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.980
 it does not work to perfection on the plate 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.239
 plate being good 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.800
 turn off has been resumed always 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:33.200
 taking care to unplug the mains cord 

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.200
 retreat your plugins into it 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.670
 I'm going to do a test with her now. 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:44.100
 It works to show you another one. 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:46.920
 clock that has 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:49.820
 So where did you call asking? 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.820
 acceleration there 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.920
 I was with the bag plate and it did not work. 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.930
 popular electronics is bad here in 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.490
 electronic card has 136 zinho that 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.140
 regular acceleration 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:10.570
 if you come there counterclockwise 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.760
 decreases the power it will generate 

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:14.500
 a motor rotate clockwise and goes 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:17.050
 give maximum engine power that is 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:19.630
 here is not only the tests for the models 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.620
 electronics all of them is even in years 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:23.140
 of work 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.660
 If you're going to get the electric check on my 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.190
 on my channel on youtube that has another one 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.150
 video that teaches pedal repair 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.020
 electric 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:33.460
 done that engine ran is trouble 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:35.170
 on the electronic board 

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:39.210
 if it did not work, it's going to be a problem in 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.210
 it is necessary for you to change the engine
