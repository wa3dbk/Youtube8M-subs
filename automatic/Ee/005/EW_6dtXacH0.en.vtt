00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.130
 Hello everyone and today in this review I 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:08.099
 I would like to draw an analogy between the two 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.650
 tablets and taurine and 13 which was 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.610
 I in the previous review is not a tablet from 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.480
 dns companies 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:18.210
 it f or 76 in the box we have all the same 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.820
 most that of the winner a13 but one 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.830
 This headphones here is really very 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:29.880
 bad so choose there to yourself 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:30.779
 tablet will draw an analogy will 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.149
 one way 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.980
 I will show exactly the difference between 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.870
 these two tablets because 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.410
 they have a lot of similarity as they 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.450
 done on a single processor and completely 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.210
 identical to each other but still 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.160
 some difference there are these differences i 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.399
 I will show you using the program 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.340
 antutu benchmark 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:53.940
 let's start with this tablet and here it is us 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:59.149
 shows 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:02.100
 parrot 3385 and the same tablet shows 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:09.320
 3555 to scare but when we insert there 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:09.320
 flash drive it show 3780 parrots also 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:16.740
 go in and what information is here 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.890
 us differences frequency central 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:24.689
 processor on this tablet we have 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:28.290
 from 60 to 1000 8 megahertz and on this 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:30.540
 a tablet from 60 to 1200 megahertz that is 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.500
 200 megahertz difference between them 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.509
 apparently from this just 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:39.990
 speed on this tablet 

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:44.310
 a little bit quicker also the difference then 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:48.450
 that on this tablet only 120 points on 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:50.579
 inch and here also 160 dpi and another 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:53.220
 the difference here is we have 8 gigabytes 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:55.460
 internal memory here we have 4 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:59.040
 gigabytes of internal memory otherwise 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:03.750
 they are completely consistent with each other 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:06.000
 android it costs version 404 provider 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:11.920
 also main 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:16.150
 and we have the rn model chm or 400 m p 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:21.900
 producer cp fight yourself oh well 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:23.640
 model crm version 7 is another difference in what 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.650
 the camera 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:29.410
 what I like on this tablet 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.300
 the fact that the camera we have here is the center 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:34.959
 it is very uncomfortable when we 

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:37.209
 we talk on skype but the camera is here 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:39.880
 really very bad 0 3 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:43.420
 megapixels and it is the same as 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:46.870
 phones around 2004 2005 then 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:50.200
 there is if you remember this blur this 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:54.150
 braking when we remove on this 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:57.400
 tablet camera is also 0 3 megapixels but 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:00.280
 what I don't like is that where is she 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:02.019
 located located in the corner and this 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:04.709
 very uncomfortable constantly having to 

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:06.130
 look for the place where you can see and 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:10.090
 does not matter 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:12.250
 The review is very bad but the camera itself 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.209
 much better than here I don't know why 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:15.900
 it depends 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:21.430
 but it removes it somehow more clearly and 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:24.120
 smoothly what i don't like yet in this 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:28.660
 button tablet is very convenient 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:30.420
 that is, from above we see what's here 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:34.230
 us go on-off button 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:37.260
 charging and yusbi also microphone here 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:40.989
 volume rocker and 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:43.810
 headphone input here with us 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:45.940
 is all on one panel and this 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.489
 very comfortable that is when we keep 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:51.730
 tablet like that whatever hand it was 

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:53.739
 we completely close all exits and everything 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.560
 push buttons that is turning on 

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:59.890
 turning off the volume rocker and if 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:02.200
 let's say we want to connect genuine 

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:03.700
 same charging or same headphones will 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.340
 very uncomfortable all this together 

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:10.900
 connect the more holder if we 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:13.030
 we will play or watch a movie and most 

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:16.870
 the main difference i wanted 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:19.600
 say it of course the price is the price given 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:21.310
 tablet and a half thousand this tablet 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:24.890
 3000 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:27.320
 tns really overpriced for exactly the same 

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:29.750
 tablet though i'm sure it buys 

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:32.980
 in large batches of it and just 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:36.350
 cheat prices slightly changing the body 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:38.720
 although the case is also very on each other 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:40.640
 similar well, of course, if you do not take the bill 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:44.030
 the fact that the buttons are a little bit 

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:46.820
 differently and so all to each other 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:50.480
 corresponds we of course the choice is always 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:52.520
 is yours i wish you 

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:54.770
 advise if you have money if 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.630
 you have 3 3 thousand still take 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:58.640
 anything in the chinese market for these 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:05:01.970
 money can already take dual core and 

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:04.520
 good enough for everyone 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:06.800
