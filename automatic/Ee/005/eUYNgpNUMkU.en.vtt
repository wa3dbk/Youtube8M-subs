very<00:00:15.269> interesting<00:00:15.920> flight<00:00:16.920> control<00:00:17.220> here

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
very interesting flight control here

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.310 
very interesting flight control here
what<00:00:17.670> this<00:00:17.850> does<00:00:18.119> it's<00:00:18.720> actually<00:00:18.990> got<00:00:19.080> three

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
what this does it's actually got three

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.200 
what this does it's actually got three
basic<00:00:19.710> modes<00:00:19.890> first<00:00:20.400> is<00:00:20.670> the<00:00:20.789> basic

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
basic modes first is the basic

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.880 
basic modes first is the basic
stabilisation<00:00:21.779> mode<00:00:22.140> and<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.619> way<00:00:22.710> this

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
stabilisation mode and the way this

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.400 
stabilisation mode and the way this
works<00:00:23.100> is<00:00:23.369> this<00:00:23.609> is<00:00:23.730> just<00:00:23.939> going<00:00:24.090> to<00:00:24.240> fight<00:00:25.170> any

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
works is this is just going to fight any

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.529 
works is this is just going to fight any
unwanted<00:00:26.070> attitude<00:00:26.640> changes<00:00:27.029> in<00:00:27.119> your<00:00:27.240> model

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
unwanted attitude changes in your model

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.269 
unwanted attitude changes in your model
so<00:00:27.660> it<00:00:27.720> will<00:00:27.810> help<00:00:27.960> stabilize<00:00:28.260> by<00:00:28.980> either

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
so it will help stabilize by either

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.250 
so it will help stabilize by either
feeling<00:00:29.760> an<00:00:29.820> aileron<00:00:30.029> elevator<00:00:30.269> or<00:00:30.840> rudder<00:00:31.080> to

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
feeling an aileron elevator or rudder to

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.260 
feeling an aileron elevator or rudder to
the<00:00:31.349> model<00:00:31.650> to<00:00:32.070> make<00:00:32.099> sure<00:00:32.460> that<00:00:32.610> it's<00:00:32.790> not

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
the model to make sure that it's not

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.510 
the model to make sure that it's not
being<00:00:33.510> pushed<00:00:33.809> off<00:00:33.960> course<00:00:34.290> by<00:00:34.500> wind<00:00:34.829> or<00:00:35.130> any

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
being pushed off course by wind or any

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.130 
being pushed off course by wind or any
other<00:00:35.640> factors<00:00:36.149> that<00:00:36.180> would<00:00:36.480> cause<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:36.930> model

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
other factors that would cause the model

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.170 
other factors that would cause the model
to<00:00:37.260> not<00:00:37.440> otherwise<00:00:37.739> fly<00:00:38.489> stable<00:00:38.969> on<00:00:39.030> its

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
to not otherwise fly stable on its

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.600 
to not otherwise fly stable on its
current<00:00:39.719> path<00:00:39.750> now<00:00:40.500> the<00:00:40.620> next<00:00:40.890> mode<00:00:41.100> is<00:00:41.129> self

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
current path now the next mode is self

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.389 
current path now the next mode is self
leveling<00:00:42.149> and<00:00:42.300> what<00:00:43.050> you<00:00:43.170> do<00:00:43.379> is<00:00:43.559> to<00:00:43.860> exit<00:00:44.250> this

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
leveling and what you do is to exit this

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:45.889 
leveling and what you do is to exit this
mode<00:00:44.460> you<00:00:44.670> use<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.180> spare<00:00:45.390> channel<00:00:45.690> on<00:00:45.750> your

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
mode you use the spare channel on your

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.170 
mode you use the spare channel on your
transmitter<00:00:46.590> it's<00:00:46.739> either<00:00:46.920> 5<00:00:47.129> or<00:00:47.370> 6<00:00:47.610> and<00:00:47.850> what

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
transmitter it's either 5 or 6 and what

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:49.580 
transmitter it's either 5 or 6 and what
you<00:00:48.239> do<00:00:48.360> is<00:00:48.450> flip<00:00:48.570> a<00:00:48.719> switch<00:00:48.750> and<00:00:49.050> will<00:00:49.230> go<00:00:49.320> into

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
you do is flip a switch and will go into

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.920 
you do is flip a switch and will go into
self<00:00:49.860> level<00:00:50.250> so<00:00:50.610> what<00:00:50.820> it<00:00:50.910> will<00:00:51.000> do<00:00:51.120> is<00:00:51.270> it

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
self level so what it will do is it

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.389 
self level so what it will do is it
doesn't<00:00:52.079> matter<00:00:52.260> what<00:00:52.379> orientation<00:00:53.160> models

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
doesn't matter what orientation models

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.040 
doesn't matter what orientation models
that<00:00:53.520> if<00:00:53.610> you<00:00:53.699> flip<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.360> switch<00:00:54.390> it's<00:00:54.870> going

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
that if you flip the switch it's going

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.779 
that if you flip the switch it's going
to<00:00:55.110> go<00:00:55.260> into<00:00:55.680> self<00:00:55.949> leveling<00:00:56.340> mode<00:00:56.520> it<00:00:56.670> will

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
to go into self leveling mode it will

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.910 
to go into self leveling mode it will
level<00:00:57.030> out<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.530> really<00:00:58.530> get<00:00:58.649> you<00:00:58.739> out<00:00:58.829> of

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
level out and really get you out of

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.170 
level out and really get you out of
trouble<00:00:59.010> in<00:00:59.280> case<00:00:59.460> you<00:00:59.579> make<00:00:59.730> some<00:00:59.879> mistakes

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
trouble in case you make some mistakes

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.970 
trouble in case you make some mistakes
while<00:01:00.329> you're<00:01:00.420> flying<00:01:00.690> I<00:01:00.899> say<00:01:01.170> fpv<00:01:01.710> if<00:01:01.890> you

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
while you're flying I say fpv if you

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.349 
while you're flying I say fpv if you
lose<00:01:02.219> your<00:01:02.460> video<00:01:02.820> feed

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
lose your video feed

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:04.910 
lose your video feed
simply<00:01:03.780> flip<00:01:03.930> that<00:01:04.140> switch<00:01:04.379> in<00:01:04.650> the<00:01:04.710> model

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
simply flip that switch in the model

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.830 
simply flip that switch in the model
will<00:01:05.040> level<00:01:05.339> out<00:01:05.460> and<00:01:05.489> you've<00:01:06.180> got<00:01:06.330> no<00:01:06.450> words

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
will level out and you've got no words

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.010 
will level out and you've got no words
now<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.710> third<00:01:08.010> mode<00:01:08.310> is<00:01:08.670> a<00:01:08.939> hover<00:01:09.510> mode<00:01:09.810> for

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
now the third mode is a hover mode for

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.260 
now the third mode is a hover mode for
3d<00:01:10.409> which<00:01:10.860> is<00:01:10.979> very<00:01:11.159> cool<00:01:11.369> so<00:01:11.670> if<00:01:11.939> you<00:01:12.060> want<00:01:12.240> to

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
3d which is very cool so if you want to

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.609 
3d which is very cool so if you want to
put<00:01:12.420> this<00:01:12.510> in<00:01:12.659> a<00:01:12.720> model<00:01:12.990> say<00:01:13.140> you're<00:01:13.260> learning

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
put this in a model say you're learning

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:16.429 
put this in a model say you're learning
to<00:01:13.799> do<00:01:13.979> aerobatic<00:01:14.909> so<00:01:15.119> 3d<00:01:15.479> flight<00:01:15.750> with<00:01:16.020> us<00:01:16.049> say

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
to do aerobatic so 3d flight with us say

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.679 
to do aerobatic so 3d flight with us say
like<00:01:16.560> a<00:01:16.650> mid<00:01:16.830> wing<00:01:17.040> mop<00:01:17.250> which<00:01:18.060> you<00:01:18.180> can<00:01:18.330> do<00:01:18.479> is

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
like a mid wing mop which you can do is

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.420 
like a mid wing mop which you can do is
when<00:01:18.960> you<00:01:19.080> flip<00:01:19.380> the<00:01:19.409> switch<00:01:19.590> for<00:01:20.009> that<00:01:20.070> third

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
when you flip the switch for that third

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.940 
when you flip the switch for that third
mode<00:01:20.670> it<00:01:21.509> will<00:01:21.600> actually<00:01:21.869> go<00:01:22.229> into<00:01:22.259> a<00:01:22.590> hover

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
mode it will actually go into a hover

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.789 
mode it will actually go into a hover
stabilization<00:01:23.759> mode<00:01:23.909> so<00:01:24.420> if<00:01:24.689> you<00:01:24.780> put<00:01:25.590> those

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
stabilization mode so if you put those

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.770 
stabilization mode so if you put those
on<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.040> model<00:01:26.250> up<00:01:26.369> put<00:01:26.580> it<00:01:26.640> into<00:01:26.880> a<00:01:27.299> hover<00:01:27.689> you

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
on the model up put it into a hover you

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.420 
on the model up put it into a hover you
can<00:01:27.900> flip<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.229> switch<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:28.680> it<00:01:29.009> will<00:01:29.100> actually

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
can flip the switch and it will actually

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.149 
can flip the switch and it will actually
make<00:01:30.390> all<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.689> necessary<00:01:31.049> inputs<00:01:31.829> on<00:01:32.009> your

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
make all the necessary inputs on your

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.800 
make all the necessary inputs on your
control<00:01:32.430> surfaces<00:01:32.880> to<00:01:33.090> hold<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.450> model<00:01:33.570> on<00:01:33.780> a

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
control surfaces to hold the model on a

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:34.100 
control surfaces to hold the model on a
hover

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
hover

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.020 
hover
so<00:01:34.530> very<00:01:34.770> cool<00:01:35.009> a<00:01:35.070> very<00:01:35.430> nice<00:01:35.610> feature<00:01:35.880> for
