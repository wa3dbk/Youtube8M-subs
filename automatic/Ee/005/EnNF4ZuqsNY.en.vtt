00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
turn on the swells and then I can know

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.870 
turn on the swells and then I can know
basically<00:01:04.260> how<00:01:04.500> I<00:01:04.530> built<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.339> sound<00:01:05.549> is<00:01:05.729> just

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
basically how I built the sound is just

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:15.649 
basically how I built the sound is just
to<00:01:06.000> start<00:01:06.270> with<00:01:06.450> a<00:01:06.479> regular<00:01:06.840> t<00:01:07.080> wah<00:01:14.420> and<00:01:15.420> then

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
to start with a regular t wah and then

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.170 
to start with a regular t wah and then
um<00:01:15.990> then<00:01:16.830> I'll<00:01:16.950> add<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.520> delay<00:01:17.790> which<00:01:18.030> is

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
um then I'll add the delay which is

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.880 
um then I'll add the delay which is
already<00:01:18.500> preset<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.159> tempo<00:01:20.790> of<00:01:20.850> the<00:01:20.909> music

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
already preset to the tempo of the music

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.289 
already preset to the tempo of the music
and<00:01:22.890> then<00:01:23.070> with<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.340> expression<00:01:23.790> pedal<00:01:24.060> I<00:01:24.119> can

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
and then with the expression pedal I can

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.679 
and then with the expression pedal I can
control<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.650> regions<00:01:26.159> and<00:01:26.549> and<00:01:27.540> then

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
control the the regions and and then

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:37.639 
control the the regions and and then
sometimes<00:01:28.080> I'll<00:01:28.229> kick<00:01:28.409> on<00:01:28.590> the<00:01:28.619> harmonizer

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:37.649 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:40.889 

then<00:01:38.649> if<00:01:38.740> I<00:01:38.890> I<00:01:39.159> can<00:01:39.490> turn<00:01:39.640> that<00:01:39.880> delay<00:01:40.479> off<00:01:40.689> but

00:01:40.889 --> 00:01:40.899 
then if I I can turn that delay off but

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:42.599 
then if I I can turn that delay off but
the<00:01:41.049> regions<00:01:41.590> will<00:01:41.740> keep<00:01:41.920> going<00:01:42.250> and<00:01:42.429> then<00:01:42.549> I

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:42.609 
the regions will keep going and then I

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:51.090 
the regions will keep going and then I
can<00:01:42.789> keep<00:01:42.939> kind<00:01:43.240> of<00:01:43.299> soloing<00:01:48.509> it's<00:01:49.509> a<00:01:50.039> kind<00:01:51.039> of

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:51.100 
can keep kind of soloing it's a kind of

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.929 
can keep kind of soloing it's a kind of
