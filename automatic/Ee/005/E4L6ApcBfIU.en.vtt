know to be in these movies and I think I

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.410

think looks has something to do with it
but<00:02:09.660> I<00:02:09.899> think<00:02:10.170> a<00:02:10.379> lot<00:02:10.530> of<00:02:10.560> it<00:02:10.739> is<00:02:10.800> they're<00:02:10.950> just

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
but I think a lot of it is they're just

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.580 
but I think a lot of it is they're just
they're<00:02:11.400> pulling<00:02:11.730> from<00:02:11.879> this<00:02:12.060> weird<00:02:12.390> pool<00:02:12.750> of
