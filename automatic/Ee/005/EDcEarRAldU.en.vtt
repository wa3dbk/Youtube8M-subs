00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:02.090
 Do you enjoy your time? 

00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:03.700
 Yeah 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:05.770
 Oh really .. 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.300
 We sang and danced nonstop from the start of the party. 

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:12.880
 But there are still two songs 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:18.970
 In fact .. 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.110
 The concert is held in this grand stadium. 

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:27.250
 It made us feel very upset and worried 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.900
 The concert was not perfect .. 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.480
 But we sang .. 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:40.850
 We danced and chanted together until the end. 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.320
 Which makes me very grateful to you 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:43.820
 Oh really .. 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.580
 JUD is still practicing so far 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.290
 Our bodies and thought are very tired because of the continuous performance .. 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:58.460
 But thanks to your support .. 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:04.330
 We managed to finish the party until the end 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.500
 I always wanted to tell you this 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:09.970
 Thank you with all my heart .. 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.440
 For all the support you gave to JUD .. 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.320
 I hope you always remember .. 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.780
 The fun we enjoyed at this party which passed peacefully without incident 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:23.330
 It was with you (t-woo) 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.050
 With you (Danny) 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:36.700
 As you saw at the beginning, you guys .. 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:38.940
 My hair flew 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.690
 What I was invited to do .. 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.340
 Is just one thing 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.600
 It shows you how much I trust you 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:01.520
 Ka is a very difficult decision 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:06.360
 But I wanted to show you how much I believe in you by any means at this party .. 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.320
 So my hair flew 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.720
 The trust I have always spoken to you about 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.550
 Now is the time .. 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.130
 To show us your faith in us 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.420
 There have been many things that you would like to talk about at this party 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:35.690
 We faced many difficulties. 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.650
 And we made a lot of mistakes. 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.500
 Which I hope you understand 

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:45.960
 We will continue to develop ourselves and trust in our confidence 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.870
 We will always be in the spirit of JUD .. 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.510
 Who will not regret to give them your admiration 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.280
 thank you 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.690
 Yeah. With you (Hu-yong) you guys 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.430
 It was a resounding success. 

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.890
 To stand on the largest platform in Korea .. 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.500
 We hold a special party for JUD 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:21.020
 We felt a lot of fear and anxiety before we went on stage. 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:27.310
 But with you all this has completely disappeared 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.310
 Your view was really beautiful 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.170
 For you .. 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.060
 I will pay my respects 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:55.150
 thank you all 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:59.200
 That's what I intended to do 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:02.500
 With you (Ki-sang) 

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:04.290
 Firstly .. 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.510
 I want to express my sincere thanks 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.390
 I'm not really lonely anymore. 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.230
 It is exactly what I felt 

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:20.740
 I will do my best from now on and on .. 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.320
 As much as you believe in us, we will believe in you 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.980
 I will always be proud .. 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:36.040
 With the most memorable memories .. 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.020
 May be .. 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:43.650
 Between singer and fans. Between singer and his family 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.000
 I hope we never change .. 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:49.960
 And we stay together forever 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.050
 thank you 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:56.590
 Halo ~ 

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:03.320
 Wow! 

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:05.680
 For me, we really .. 

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:09.520
 When we first set up our team .. 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.300
 It was not even in our dreams that people like us would stand. 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:16.790
 On this platform. Oh really ... 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:20.420
 in case .. 

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:24.650
 If the appearance of these young people changed .. 

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.780
 Make sure only one order 

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:29.570
 Our hearts are the five .. 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.150
 It will remain the same as the first platform we took 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:34.020
 thank you 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:35.020
 thank you all 

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:37.760
 This is the last part to start music please
