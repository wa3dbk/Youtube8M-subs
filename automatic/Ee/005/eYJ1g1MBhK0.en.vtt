00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:35.379 
really neat design with it oh sure and
you<00:03:32.299> can<00:03:32.450> blur<00:03:32.690> it<00:03:32.870> if<00:03:32.959> you<00:03:33.109> want<00:03:33.319> to<00:03:34.329> but<00:03:35.329> I

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:35.389 
you can blur it if you want to but I

00:03:35.389 --> 00:03:37.539 
you can blur it if you want to but I
think<00:03:35.750> with<00:03:35.870> the<00:03:35.959> prism<00:03:36.380> OH

00:03:37.539 --> 00:03:37.549 
think with the prism OH

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:42.610 
think with the prism OH
-<00:03:38.180> oh<00:03:39.579> wow<00:03:40.579> so<00:03:41.510> you<00:03:41.569> have<00:03:41.750> almost<00:03:41.959> like<00:03:42.079> a<00:03:42.169> 3d

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
- oh wow so you have almost like a 3d

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.860 
- oh wow so you have almost like a 3d
type<00:03:42.889> effect<00:03:43.400> you<00:03:43.489> really<00:03:43.880> do<00:03:44.060> and<00:03:44.750> of<00:03:44.840> course

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
type effect you really do and of course

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:48.069 
type effect you really do and of course
these<00:03:45.200> have<00:03:45.410> index<00:03:45.950> and<00:03:46.450> prism<00:03:47.450> and<00:03:47.720> gobo

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:48.079 
these have index and prism and gobo

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:50.050 
these have index and prism and gobo
indexing<00:03:48.799> which<00:03:49.190> basically<00:03:49.519> means<00:03:49.819> if<00:03:49.940> you

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
indexing which basically means if you

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.240 
indexing which basically means if you
want<00:03:50.269> at<00:03:50.419> a<00:03:50.450> specific<00:03:50.720> angle<00:03:51.230> you<00:03:51.769> can<00:03:51.950> do<00:03:52.069> that

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:52.250 
want at a specific angle you can do that

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:53.710 
want at a specific angle you can do that
this<00:03:52.579> makes<00:03:52.819> this<00:03:52.940> a<00:03:53.120> kind<00:03:53.299> of<00:03:53.389> moving<00:03:53.599> at

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
this makes this a kind of moving at

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.379 
this makes this a kind of moving at

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
get a carny where they say well can you

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.289

00:03:59.289 --> 00:03:59.299 
have the gobo on the floor and then we

00:03:59.299 --> 00:03:59.900 
have the gobo on the floor and then we

zoom<00:04:22.410> oh<00:04:22.650> it<00:04:22.980> is<00:04:23.100> hot<00:04:23.280> Pro<00:04:23.520> that's<00:04:23.790> what<00:04:23.880> I

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
zoom oh it is hot Pro that's what I

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:25.340 
zoom oh it is hot Pro that's what I
talked<00:04:24.150> about<00:04:24.180> that<00:04:24.510> one<00:04:24.720> what<00:04:24.990> it<00:04:25.050> sounds

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.130 
good
yeah<00:04:26.340> no<00:04:26.400> spot<00:04:26.640> bro<00:04:26.850> is<00:04:27.000> the<00:04:27.120> only<00:04:27.450> one<00:04:27.780> out<00:04:28.080> of

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:28.140 
yeah no spot bro is the only one out of

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:32.360 
yeah no spot bro is the only one out of
the<00:04:28.290> family<00:04:28.500> that<00:04:28.920> has<00:04:29.990> nearly<00:04:30.990> zoom<00:04:31.470> so<00:04:32.100> this

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:32.370 
the family that has nearly zoom so this

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.100 
the family that has nearly zoom so this
makes<00:04:32.580> it<00:04:32.730> an<00:04:32.850> ideal<00:04:32.940> goal<00:04:33.390> projection<00:04:34.020> again

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
makes it an ideal goal projection again

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:35.960 
makes it an ideal goal projection again
even<00:04:34.530> as<00:04:34.620> a<00:04:34.650> single<00:04:35.040> fixture<00:04:35.340> because<00:04:35.700> you<00:04:35.820> can

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
even as a single fixture because you can

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:37.880 
even as a single fixture because you can
zoom<00:04:36.180> in<00:04:36.390> or<00:04:36.570> zoom<00:04:36.600> out<00:04:36.960> you<00:04:37.440> still<00:04:37.650> have<00:04:37.770> your

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:37.890 
zoom in or zoom out you still have your

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:40.160 
zoom in or zoom out you still have your
motorized<00:04:38.430> focus<00:04:38.940> so<00:04:39.330> you<00:04:39.570> can<00:04:39.930> tell<00:04:40.080> you

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:40.170 
motorized focus so you can tell you

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:41.630 
motorized focus so you can tell you
probably<00:04:40.470> look<00:04:40.590> when<00:04:40.740> you<00:04:40.830> come<00:04:41.070> in<00:04:41.220> we're

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:41.640 
probably look when you come in we're

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.070 
probably look when you come in we're
gonna<00:04:41.760> have<00:04:42.030> the<00:04:42.300> nice<00:04:42.540> in<00:04:42.750> your<00:04:42.870> name

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
gonna have the nice in your name

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:35.669 
like to like for example I'll put the

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:38.330 
like to like for example I'll put the
prism<00:05:36.270> on<00:05:36.360> this<00:05:36.600> particular<00:05:37.230> one<00:05:37.470> and<00:05:37.800> then

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:38.340 
prism on this particular one and then

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:41.380 
prism on this particular one and then
I'll<00:05:38.490> blur<00:05:38.760> it<00:05:38.820> a<00:05:38.970> little<00:05:39.180> bit<00:05:39.480> oh<00:05:39.950> cool<00:05:40.950> yeah

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:41.390 
I'll blur it a little bit oh cool yeah

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:44.570 
I'll blur it a little bit oh cool yeah
and<00:05:42.390> then<00:05:42.570> I<00:05:42.600> you<00:05:42.750> know<00:05:42.960> whoops<00:05:43.380> and<00:05:43.710> just<00:05:44.430> like

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:44.580 
and then I you know whoops and just like

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.670 
and then I you know whoops and just like
the<00:05:44.730> elite<00:05:45.000> as<00:05:45.660> I<00:05:45.780> say<00:05:45.930> this<00:05:46.050> one<00:05:46.230> has<00:05:46.380> so<00:05:46.530> many

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:46.680 
the elite as I say this one has so many

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.560 
the elite as I say this one has so many
features<00:05:46.950> it's<00:05:47.340> almost<00:05:47.790> overwhelming

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:48.570 
features it's almost overwhelming

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:50.370 
now let's just go ahead and do

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:56.290 
now let's just go ahead and do
nice<00:05:50.550> soft<00:05:50.850> index<00:05:52.190> if<00:05:53.190> you<00:05:53.400> really<00:05:53.910> blur<00:05:54.180> it

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:56.300 
nice soft index if you really blur it

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:59.330 
nice soft index if you really blur it
Wow<00:05:57.330> you<00:05:57.750> create<00:05:58.080> that<00:05:58.199> soft<00:05:58.500> index<00:05:59.010> right

00:05:59.330 --> 00:05:59.340 
Wow you create that soft index right

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:01.060 
Wow you create that soft index right
let's<00:05:59.580> see<00:05:59.669> we<00:05:59.790> have<00:05:59.880> the<00:06:00.060> index<00:06:00.419> here<00:06:00.750> a

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:01.070 
let's see we have the index here a

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:02.680 
let's see we have the index here a
rotation<00:06:02.070> excuse<00:06:02.340> me

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:02.690 
rotation excuse me

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:04.969 
rotation excuse me
then<00:06:03.690> I'll<00:06:03.930> let's<00:06:04.139> say<00:06:04.260> you<00:06:04.350> do<00:06:04.500> our<00:06:04.650> gobo

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:04.979 
then I'll let's say you do our gobo

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:07.760 
then I'll let's say you do our gobo
rotation<00:06:05.669> or<00:06:06.229> index<00:06:07.229> whichever<00:06:07.560> one<00:06:07.650> you

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:07.770
