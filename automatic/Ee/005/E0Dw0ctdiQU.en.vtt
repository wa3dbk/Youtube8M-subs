that I could like that much and I was

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:24.199 
that I could like that much and I was
sitting<00:02:21.810> in<00:02:22.019> the<00:02:22.169> back<00:02:22.349> and<00:02:22.739> just<00:02:23.129> see<00:02:23.400> if<00:02:23.700> it

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
sitting in the back and just see if it

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.179 
sitting in the back and just see if it
was<00:02:24.359> the<00:02:24.510> color<00:02:24.749> I<00:02:24.840> want<00:02:25.260> like<00:02:25.499> I<00:02:25.620> let<00:02:25.919> the<00:02:26.040> hair

00:02:26.179 --> 00:02:26.189 
was the color I want like I let the hair

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:27.180 
was the color I want like I let the hair
sit<00:02:26.400> in<00:02:26.489> for<00:02:26.669> me

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
sit in for me

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.970 
sit in for me
five<00:02:27.280> minutes<00:02:27.640> to<00:02:27.790> see<00:02:28.030> if<00:02:28.300> it<00:02:28.960> would<00:02:29.170> take

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:29.980 
five minutes to see if it would take

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.770 
five minutes to see if it would take
this<00:02:30.310> probably<00:02:30.730> why<00:02:30.820> my<00:02:30.970> camera<00:02:31.330> doctors<00:02:31.660> it

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
this probably why my camera doctors it

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.410 
this probably why my camera doctors it
took<00:02:31.930> me<00:02:32.080> maybe<00:02:32.230> like<00:02:32.530> an<00:02:32.680> hour<00:02:32.800> to<00:02:33.210> really<00:02:34.210> get

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
took me maybe like an hour to really get

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:37.500 
took me maybe like an hour to really get
the<00:02:34.570> color<00:02:34.840> that<00:02:34.990> I<00:02:35.320> really<00:02:35.650> wanted<00:02:36.040> so<00:02:36.850> that

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
the color that I really wanted so that

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:39.420 
the color that I really wanted so that
would<00:02:37.870> be<00:02:38.020> you<00:02:38.800> know<00:02:38.920> something<00:02:39.220> you<00:02:39.280> would

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
would be you know something you would

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.030 
would be you know something you would
want<00:02:39.640> to<00:02:39.700> do<00:02:39.850> instead<00:02:40.210> of<00:02:40.300> just<00:02:40.920> hoping<00:02:41.920> and

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:42.040 
want to do instead of just hoping and

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.560 
want to do instead of just hoping and
wishing<00:02:42.190> and<00:02:42.550> guessing<00:02:43.000> that<00:02:43.120> you<00:02:43.330> have<00:02:43.480> the

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
wishing and guessing that you have the

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.420 
wishing and guessing that you have the
color<00:02:43.810> right<00:02:44.020> you'd<00:02:44.530> be<00:02:44.800> better<00:02:44.980> if<00:02:45.160> you<00:02:45.220> just

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
color right you'd be better if you just

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.040 
color right you'd be better if you just
cut<00:02:45.640> a<00:02:45.670> couple<00:02:45.910> strands<00:02:46.240> off<00:02:46.390> the<00:02:46.510> back<00:02:46.720> no
