 his body which is the church without the church 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:06.320

 spirit a word of wisdom not 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:43.670

 word of wisdom to another one word 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:49.549
 according to the same 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:53.060

 all these things are fulfilled unto them 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:17.659
 and the same spirit that distributes the 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.900
 each one according to what is then paulo 

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:22.020
 quotes some gifts as some gifts that are 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.810

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.680
 he accompanied 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.950
 not all Christian communities had 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.960
 these gifts the communities of são joão de 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:38.070
 Pedro were not so gifted 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:41.460

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:44.160
 they come and disappear is sure to 

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:46.530
 according to the need of the church is 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.250
 I need to understand this, then Sao Paulo. 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:52.200
 here he quotes various tones the gift of wisdom 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.840
 which is the gift of having the discernment of the 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:58.650
 things of God is not a word of 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:01.650
 recognition that shows you know the 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.210
 God's plans that know the plans of 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:07.470

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:13.830
 amazing supernatural out of the ordinary 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:17.040
 others where he cures another power to do 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:19.710
 miracles to prophecy 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.650
 You see in the church itself 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:24.570
 that there were prophets who spoke of a famine 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:26.370
 that they see it jerusalem 

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:28.830
 There was a prophet who said that Paul 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.940
 would be arrested there is another discernment of 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.370
 spirits 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.560
 the other language university was 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.870
 people who spoke in clean has a 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.630
 distinction between praying and speaking 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:42.360
 languages pray languages ​​is to praise God 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:44.820
 comes at a point where you make the words 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:48.810
 it's not enough for you, then explode 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:50.430
 praise with moans and another thing is to speak 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.770
 the language speaks the language gives some 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.810
 message to someone for a community 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:58.110
 language and then needs someone to 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:00.720
 telling you how to interpret these 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:02.880
 gifts are not gifts are free 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:04.380
 the charisms are free no one is 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.420
 Thank you to speak the language. 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:09.060
 no one is obliged to interpret 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:11.270
 No one is obliged to pray in 

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:15.090
 this happens more in environments 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:18.600
 charismatic is correct and is obliged to 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:20.609
 everybody is not god's if it's for 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.730
 building the body of Christ for good 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:26.360
 of the church its trajectory of Christ great 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:29.100
 who has this is superior that has not 

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:32.580
 have these gifts is essential for the 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:34.320
 salvation not then 12 charisma was born 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.420
 date you want it anytime you want 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:38.100
 because wants 

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:39.960
 i then realized which can not 

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.390
 missing is charity 

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:45.750
 we are in chapter 12 of the first 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:47.520
 to the Corinthians in chapter 13 são paulo 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:50.520
 will tell you which is the greatest gift is the 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:53.580
 charity the love to him will tell if I 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:56.340
 Do not have love, I can speak languages. 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:59.190
 I can do miracles I can do the 

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:02.190
 that none of this will serve is the 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:05.100
 love that is born of faith in our 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:06.870
 Sir, very well, what matters is here. 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:11.220
 is what is in verse 11 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:13.860
 all these things are accomplished by one and the 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:16.980
 same spirit that distributes to each 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:19.290
 as you want and distribute to break the 

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:21.690
 growth of Christ's body 

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:23.790
 and São Paulo will talk about this body of 

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:25.050
 christ is the church look there 

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:28.440
 verse 12 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:31.650
 as the body is one although it has many 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:34.860
 and all members of the body 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:38.070
 although many are one body form 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:42.270
 so it is with Christ 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:45.360
 indeed all of us Jews or Greeks either 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:48.870
 say from the people of israel or come 

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:52.080
 of slave or free paganism we were 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:54.210
 baptized in one spirit sees that the 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:56.880
 sacrament of baptism 

00:05:54.210 --> 00:06:00.120
 see what gives the holy spirit we were 

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:03.900
 baptized not only spirit to form 

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:07.290
 one body in the Eucharist and that the body 

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:09.870
 church and we all drink from a single 

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:10.470
 What a beautiful thing, what a thing. 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:13.740
 beautiful 

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:16.650
 we drink of the one spirit in baptism in the 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:18.510
 the Eucharist because in each sacrament the 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:21.480
 people receive the grace of the spirit 

00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:23.250
 holy to grow more and more like the 

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:25.650
 body of Christ that is the church 

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:28.620

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:31.620
