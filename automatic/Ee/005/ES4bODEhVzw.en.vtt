00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:08.000
 let's make chocolate pallor by 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:10.250
 so much 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.219
 at another time I commented on doing it in the 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.600
 machine we did it on the machine but not 

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:16.620
 everyone has machine then 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.430
 let's do 

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:21.010
 in a bowl 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:23.110
 of almond 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:25.190
 the sugar 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:28.300
 cocoa powder 

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:28.300
 nothing very little 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:34.580
 egg white 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:34.580
 and move them 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:41.500
 you have to mix everything well so that it 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.500
 be uniform 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:51.539
 as you see is forming and thus row 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.239
 and now 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.530
 we cut a piece 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:05.530
 we work a little more our friend 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.530
 sugar gas 

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:13.610
 tray and baking paper 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:17.390
 we make a ball for icing sugar and 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.950
 so we can do what we want with 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.100
 this recipe usually comes out in 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:24.820
 about 30 grams come out about 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.659
 15 between 15 and 30 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:27.659
 30 balls 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.609
 we crave 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.830
 we remove a little excess sugar 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.140
 and we put 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.140
 in the tray 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:46.900
 we get in the oven 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.900
 without burning 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.950
 we go
