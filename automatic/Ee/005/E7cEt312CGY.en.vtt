faster<00:00:39.480> so<00:00:40.170> when<00:00:40.320> you<00:00:40.379> turn<00:00:40.680> it<00:00:40.890> off

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
faster so when you turn it off

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.180 
faster so when you turn it off
you're<00:00:42.059> not<00:00:42.270> using<00:00:42.570> as<00:00:42.840> much<00:00:43.020> battery<00:00:43.559> because

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
you're not using as much battery because

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.630 
you're not using as much battery because
now<00:00:44.399> you're<00:00:44.640> downgrading<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.270> the<00:00:45.780> 3G<00:00:46.379> network

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:46.640 
now you're downgrading to the 3G network

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.310 
now you're downgrading to the 3G network
this<00:00:47.640> is<00:00:47.760> really<00:00:48.090> one<00:00:48.239> of<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.420> top<00:00:48.450> ways<00:00:48.899> to

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
this is really one of the top ways to

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.279 
this is really one of the top ways to
improve<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.309> battery<00:00:50.460> life<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.960> second

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
improve the battery life and the second

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.729 
improve the battery life and the second
thing<00:00:52.410> you<00:00:52.559> can<00:00:52.710> do<00:00:52.890> is<00:00:53.870> turn<00:00:54.870> off<00:00:54.930> location

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
thing you can do is turn off location

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.950 
thing you can do is turn off location
services<00:00:56.640> so<00:00:57.329> you<00:00:57.360> don't<00:00:57.600> want<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:57.780> go<00:00:57.899> to
