00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:19.040 

in<00:00:17.790> this<00:00:17.940> next<00:00:18.180> part<00:00:18.420> of<00:00:18.510> building<00:00:18.660> the<00:00:18.810> foot

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
in this next part of building the foot

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.380 
in this next part of building the foot
we're<00:00:19.619> going<00:00:19.770> to<00:00:19.890> have<00:00:20.100> to<00:00:20.310> look<00:00:20.910> at<00:00:21.060> putting

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
we're going to have to look at putting

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.940 
we're going to have to look at putting
together<00:00:21.600> the<00:00:21.900> toes<00:00:22.140> so<00:00:22.680> I<00:00:22.920> want<00:00:23.880> to<00:00:24.500> cut<00:00:25.500> up<00:00:25.680> my

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:25.950 
together the toes so I want to cut up my

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:30.530 
together the toes so I want to cut up my
edges<00:00:27.800> so<00:00:28.800> that<00:00:28.860> I<00:00:29.070> have<00:00:29.400> a<00:00:29.430> match<00:00:29.880> going<00:00:30.300> on

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:30.540 
edges so that I have a match going on

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:35.090 
edges so that I have a match going on
from<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:31.940> top<00:00:32.940> to<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.360> bottom<00:00:33.920> now<00:00:34.920> that's

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
from the top to the bottom now that's

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.920 
from the top to the bottom now that's
right<00:00:35.280> now<00:00:35.399> I've<00:00:35.489> got<00:00:35.520> four<00:00:35.970> I<00:00:36.000> really<00:00:36.720> don't

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
right now I've got four I really don't

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.900 
right now I've got four I really don't
have<00:00:37.020> a<00:00:37.170> fifth<00:00:37.680> for<00:00:38.070> my<00:00:38.160> pinky<00:00:38.579> and<00:00:38.730> I'm<00:00:38.820> gonna

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
have a fifth for my pinky and I'm gonna

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.950 
have a fifth for my pinky and I'm gonna
have<00:00:39.060> to<00:00:39.120> add<00:00:39.270> this<00:00:39.660> one<00:00:39.960> in<00:00:41.540> that<00:00:42.540> means<00:00:42.809> I've

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
have to add this one in that means I've

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.960 
have to add this one in that means I've
got<00:00:42.989> a<00:00:43.140> missing<00:00:43.680> edge<00:00:43.829> here<00:00:44.130> on<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.340> side<00:00:44.579> and

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:44.970 
got a missing edge here on the side and

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.110 
got a missing edge here on the side and
I'm<00:00:45.210> gonna<00:00:45.329> have<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:45.570> add<00:00:45.720> that<00:00:45.750> in<00:00:46.320> as<00:00:46.500> well

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
I'm gonna have to add that in as well

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.759 
I'm gonna have to add that in as well
now<00:00:48.120> note<00:00:48.359> for<00:00:48.539> right<00:00:48.690> now<00:00:48.719> I'm<00:00:49.079> adding<00:00:49.410> in

00:00:49.759 --> 00:00:49.769 
now note for right now I'm adding in

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:53.299 
now note for right now I'm adding in
these<00:00:50.010> edges<00:00:50.539> but<00:00:51.539> I'm<00:00:51.690> leaving<00:00:52.289> five<00:00:52.949> sided

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
these edges but I'm leaving five sided

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.040 
these edges but I'm leaving five sided
faces<00:00:53.879> at<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.179> back<00:00:54.359> of<00:00:54.390> each<00:00:54.690> of<00:00:54.899> these

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
faces at the back of each of these

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.259 
faces at the back of each of these
that's<00:00:55.859> going<00:00:56.039> to<00:00:56.129> be<00:00:56.160> kind<00:00:56.519> of<00:00:56.730> problematic

00:00:57.259 --> 00:00:57.269 
that's going to be kind of problematic

00:00:57.269 --> 00:00:59.990 
that's going to be kind of problematic
later<00:00:57.719> on<00:00:57.929> but<00:00:58.890> we're<00:00:59.460> going<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.699> work<00:00:59.820> around

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
later on but we're going to work around

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.329 
later on but we're going to work around
that<00:01:00.390> later<00:01:00.960> just<00:01:01.649> know<00:01:01.859> that<00:01:01.890> we're<00:01:02.190> going<00:01:02.280> to

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:02.339 
that later just know that we're going to

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:05.570 
that later just know that we're going to
come<00:01:02.550> back<00:01:02.579> to<00:01:03.059> these<00:01:03.680> five<00:01:04.680> side<00:01:04.980> faces<00:01:05.400> and

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
come back to these five side faces and

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.360 
come back to these five side faces and
deal<00:01:05.790> with<00:01:06.000> them<00:01:06.240> then<00:01:07.020> we're<00:01:07.950> not<00:01:08.070> going<00:01:08.310> to

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:08.370 
deal with them then we're not going to

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:11.240 
deal with them then we're not going to
work<00:01:08.490> with<00:01:08.610> them<00:01:08.820> right<00:01:09.570> now<00:01:10.010> I'm<00:01:11.010> going<00:01:11.190> to

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
work with them right now I'm going to

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.880 
work with them right now I'm going to
wine<00:01:11.430> this<00:01:11.610> out<00:01:11.790> so<00:01:12.030> it<00:01:12.150> fits<00:01:12.390> with<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:13.020> pinky

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
wine this out so it fits with the pinky

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.000 
wine this out so it fits with the pinky
toe<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.400> fifth<00:01:14.670> toe<00:01:15.170> and<00:01:16.170> now<00:01:16.620> we<00:01:16.680> have<00:01:16.980> one

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:17.010 
toe the fifth toe and now we have one

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.590 
toe the fifth toe and now we have one
division<00:01:17.670> for<00:01:18.710> essentially<00:01:19.710> each<00:01:19.920> toe<00:01:20.600> for

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
division for essentially each toe for

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.000 
division for essentially each toe for
the<00:01:21.689> foot

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:27.010 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:28.620 

like<00:01:27.640> I<00:01:27.760> said<00:01:27.820> these<00:01:28.000> problems<00:01:28.360> are<00:01:28.420> going<00:01:28.570> to

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
like I said these problems are going to

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.340 
like I said these problems are going to
come<00:01:28.810> from<00:01:29.230> the<00:01:30.360> five<00:01:31.360> side<00:01:31.630> faces<00:01:32.110> that<00:01:32.260> we

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
come from the five side faces that we

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.320 
come from the five side faces that we
have<00:01:32.640> but<00:01:33.640> there<00:01:33.850> are<00:01:33.880> several<00:01:34.090> ways<00:01:34.270> to

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.330 
have but there are several ways to

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.360 
have but there are several ways to
eliminate<00:01:34.720> these<00:01:35.110> back<00:01:35.500> and<00:01:36.100> that's<00:01:36.280> what

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:36.370 
eliminate these back and that's what

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:39.150 
eliminate these back and that's what
we're<00:01:36.490> going<00:01:36.580> to<00:01:36.670> work<00:01:36.790> on<00:01:36.970> next<00:01:37.300> year<00:01:37.720> I<00:01:38.160> can

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:39.160 
we're going to work on next year I can

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.990 
we're going to work on next year I can
cut<00:01:39.400> this<00:01:39.610> in<00:01:39.910> with<00:01:40.120> a<00:01:40.270> extra<00:01:41.520> split<00:01:42.520> polygon

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
cut this in with a extra split polygon

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000 
cut this in with a extra split polygon
tool<00:01:43.240> in<00:01:44.080> either<00:01:44.230> direction<00:01:44.380> or<00:01:44.740> i<00:01:44.800> can<00:01:44.860> bring

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.010 
tool in either direction or i can bring

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:47.040 
tool in either direction or i can bring
the<00:01:45.130> next<00:01:45.280> one<00:01:45.400> down<00:01:45.730> and<00:01:46.180> close<00:01:46.420> this<00:01:46.600> off<00:01:46.780> and

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.050 
the next one down and close this off and

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.410 
the next one down and close this off and
you<00:01:47.140> notice<00:01:47.410> what<00:01:47.530> happens<00:01:47.710> now<00:01:48.160> what<00:01:49.150> what's

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
you notice what happens now what what's

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.480 
you notice what happens now what what's
three<00:01:49.720> phases<00:01:49.960> turns<00:01:50.410> into<00:01:50.620> two<00:01:50.920> and<00:01:51.220> then

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
three phases turns into two and then

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.820 
three phases turns into two and then
eventually<00:01:51.610> into<00:01:52.180> one<00:01:52.450> and<00:01:52.780> that's<00:01:53.410> a<00:01:53.560> sort<00:01:53.770> of

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 
eventually into one and that's a sort of

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.440 
eventually into one and that's a sort of
general<00:01:53.890> pattern<00:01:54.640> that<00:01:54.820> you<00:01:54.940> really<00:01:55.180> want<00:01:55.360> to

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
general pattern that you really want to

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.840 
general pattern that you really want to
look<00:01:55.570> at<00:01:55.720> using<00:01:56.050> as<00:01:56.920> one<00:01:57.220> of<00:01:57.250> two<00:01:57.490> different

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:57.850 
look at using as one of two different

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:00.570 
look at using as one of two different
strategies<00:01:58.510> for<00:01:58.900> eliminating<00:01:59.770> out<00:02:00.010> extra

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
strategies for eliminating out extra

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.210 
strategies for eliminating out extra
faces<00:02:00.970> as<00:02:01.090> they<00:02:01.120> sort<00:02:01.720> of<00:02:01.780> play<00:02:02.020> back<00:02:02.290> onto<00:02:02.680> the

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:03.220 
faces as they sort of play back onto the

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.990 
faces as they sort of play back onto the
foot<00:02:03.430> so<00:02:04.420> that<00:02:04.450> idea<00:02:04.810> was<00:02:05.020> that<00:02:05.050> I<00:02:05.729> kind<00:02:06.729> of<00:02:06.790> use

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:07.000 
foot so that idea was that I kind of use

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.450 
foot so that idea was that I kind of use
my<00:02:07.030> split<00:02:07.450> polygon<00:02:07.930> tool<00:02:08.140> as<00:02:08.440> I<00:02:09.190> were<00:02:09.310> to<00:02:09.399> say

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:09.460 
my split polygon tool as I were to say

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:13.530 
my split polygon tool as I were to say
essentially<00:02:09.790> a<00:02:09.940> gate<00:02:11.040> shutting<00:02:12.040> off<00:02:12.220> two<00:02:12.580> into

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
essentially a gate shutting off two into

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.910 
essentially a gate shutting off two into
one<00:02:13.570> section<00:02:15.750> and<00:02:16.750> again<00:02:17.020> three<00:02:17.290> phases<00:02:17.710> go<00:02:17.860> to

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
one section and again three phases go to

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.660 
one section and again three phases go to
to<00:02:18.160> go<00:02:18.670> to<00:02:18.730> one<00:02:19.470> and<00:02:20.470> soften<00:02:21.040> my<00:02:21.130> edges<00:02:21.400> here

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
to go to one and soften my edges here

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.420 
to go to one and soften my edges here
let's<00:02:22.420> work<00:02:22.600> with<00:02:22.630> this<00:02:22.840> back<00:02:23.110> one<00:02:23.410> now<00:02:23.620> and

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
let's work with this back one now and

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:25.770 
let's work with this back one now and
I'm<00:02:24.520> going<00:02:24.670> to<00:02:24.700> try<00:02:24.880> and<00:02:24.910> take<00:02:25.240> this<00:02:25.450> all<00:02:25.720> the

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:25.780 
I'm going to try and take this all the

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.260 
I'm going to try and take this all the
way<00:02:26.080> around<00:02:26.290> the<00:02:26.770> foot<00:02:27.130> to<00:02:27.610> merge<00:02:27.790> up<00:02:28.060> with

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:28.270 
way around the foot to merge up with

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.510 
way around the foot to merge up with
what<00:02:28.420> was<00:02:28.510> going<00:02:28.720> on<00:02:28.840> on<00:02:28.900> my<00:02:29.200> other<00:02:29.410> side<00:02:29.770> near

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
what was going on on my other side near

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.030 
what was going on on my other side near
the<00:02:30.550> big<00:02:30.850> toe<00:02:31.290> I'm<00:02:32.290> going<00:02:32.440> to<00:02:32.500> draw<00:02:32.650> this<00:02:32.830> back

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
the big toe I'm going to draw this back

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.010 
the big toe I'm going to draw this back
out<00:02:33.250> across<00:02:33.520> the<00:02:33.640> heel<00:02:34.180> and<00:02:34.330> I'm<00:02:34.720> gonna<00:02:34.810> turn

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:35.020 
out across the heel and I'm gonna turn

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:37.979 
out across the heel and I'm gonna turn
this<00:02:35.170> corner<00:02:35.410> here<00:02:35.860> and<00:02:36.840> that<00:02:37.840> of<00:02:37.959> course

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:37.989 
this corner here and that of course

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:39.780 
this corner here and that of course
presents<00:02:38.320> me<00:02:38.590> a<00:02:38.650> triangle<00:02:39.100> and<00:02:39.220> a<00:02:39.280> five<00:02:39.520> side

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
presents me a triangle and a five side

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:40.890 
presents me a triangle and a five side
we're<00:02:39.940> gonna<00:02:40.030> get<00:02:40.150> back<00:02:40.330> to<00:02:40.480> that<00:02:40.510> in<00:02:40.690> just<00:02:40.750> a

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 
we're gonna get back to that in just a

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:46.770 
we're gonna get back to that in just a
minute<00:02:43.590> and<00:02:44.590> now<00:02:44.709> we<00:02:44.830> can<00:02:45.040> link<00:02:45.220> this<00:02:45.370> up<00:02:45.780> make

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
minute and now we can link this up make

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.460 
minute and now we can link this up make
our<00:02:46.930> quad<00:02:47.260> along<00:02:47.560> the<00:02:47.680> bottom<00:02:47.860> looking<00:02:48.370> great

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
our quad along the bottom looking great

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.960 
our quad along the bottom looking great
now<00:02:50.470> to<00:02:50.560> fix<00:02:50.739> this<00:02:50.890> up<00:02:50.950> that<00:02:51.400> triangle<00:02:51.820> I'll

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
now to fix this up that triangle I'll

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.340 
now to fix this up that triangle I'll
just<00:02:52.150> split<00:02:52.390> it<00:02:52.420> in<00:02:52.510> half<00:02:52.540> and<00:02:53.050> draw<00:02:53.200> that

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
just split it in half and draw that

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.350 
just split it in half and draw that
connection<00:02:53.830> to<00:02:54.040> the<00:02:54.310> far<00:02:54.550> side<00:02:54.820> of<00:02:54.850> the<00:02:55.090> five

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
connection to the far side of the five

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.870 
connection to the far side of the five
side<00:02:55.600> move<00:02:56.260> this<00:02:56.410> point<00:02:56.680> up<00:02:56.860> and<00:02:57.100> lo<00:02:57.730> and

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
side move this point up and lo and

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:04.430 
side move this point up and lo and
behold<00:02:58.000> I<00:02:58.510> have<00:02:58.650> three<00:02:59.650> quads

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.500 

we'll<00:03:05.440> be<00:03:05.560> doing<00:03:05.680> that<00:03:05.920> construction<00:03:06.490> quite<00:03:07.480> a

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
we'll be doing that construction quite a

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.030 
we'll be doing that construction quite a
bit<00:03:07.720> more<00:03:07.900> as<00:03:08.050> we<00:03:08.170> finish<00:03:08.440> up<00:03:08.560> this<00:03:08.680> foot<00:03:08.920> as

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
bit more as we finish up this foot as

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:32.570 
bit more as we finish up this foot as
well

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.640 

alright<00:03:33.390> so<00:03:33.540> we're<00:03:33.630> just<00:03:33.660> going<00:03:33.870> to<00:03:33.960> continue

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
alright so we're just going to continue

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:37.100 
alright so we're just going to continue
rounding<00:03:35.310> out<00:03:35.430> the<00:03:35.670> shape<00:03:36.000> now<00:03:36.300> now<00:03:36.900> that<00:03:37.020> I've

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
rounding out the shape now now that I've

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.730 
rounding out the shape now now that I've
got<00:03:37.290> a<00:03:37.320> whole<00:03:37.770> chunk<00:03:38.340> of<00:03:38.550> this<00:03:38.700> foot<00:03:39.030> in<00:03:39.740> I'm

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:40.740 
got a whole chunk of this foot in I'm

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.160 
got a whole chunk of this foot in I'm
going<00:03:41.100> to<00:03:41.310> just<00:03:41.940> rima<00:03:42.450> nip<00:03:42.570> you<00:03:42.660> late<00:03:42.810> it<00:03:42.930> so<00:03:43.050> it

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
going to just rima nip you late it so it

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.500 
going to just rima nip you late it so it
works<00:03:43.710> I<00:03:44.070> think<00:03:44.580> a<00:03:44.640> little<00:03:44.760> bit<00:03:44.940> more<00:03:45.780> evenly

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
works I think a little bit more evenly

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.060 
works I think a little bit more evenly
again<00:03:48.510> this<00:03:48.690> step<00:03:48.900> is<00:03:49.080> just<00:03:49.110> moving<00:03:49.500> vertices

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
again this step is just moving vertices

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.910 
again this step is just moving vertices
so<00:03:50.280> there's<00:03:50.460> no<00:03:50.750> specific<00:03:51.750> way<00:03:52.320> I<00:03:52.350> can<00:03:52.650> say<00:03:52.890> to

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
so there's no specific way I can say to

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.620 
so there's no specific way I can say to
do<00:03:53.370> it<00:03:53.580> other<00:03:54.570> than<00:03:55.700> examine<00:03:56.700> the<00:03:57.240> actual

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
do it other than examine the actual

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.500 
do it other than examine the actual
shape<00:03:57.900> of<00:03:57.930> a<00:03:58.260> foot<00:03:58.560> look<00:03:59.490> at<00:03:59.670> it<00:03:59.880> look<00:04:00.030> at<00:04:00.120> your

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:00.510 
shape of a foot look at it look at your

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.870 
shape of a foot look at it look at your
actual<00:04:00.960> foot<00:04:01.230> and<00:04:01.530> figure<00:04:01.770> out<00:04:01.830> how<00:04:02.220> you<00:04:02.670> can

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:02.880 
actual foot and figure out how you can

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.380 
actual foot and figure out how you can
translate<00:04:03.330> that<00:04:03.450> shape<00:04:03.750> into<00:04:04.020> 3d<00:04:05.180> again<00:04:06.180> to

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
translate that shape into 3d again to

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.510 
translate that shape into 3d again to
soften<00:04:06.780> the<00:04:06.840> edges<00:04:06.960> here<00:04:07.320> delete<00:04:07.920> my<00:04:08.070> history

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:08.520 
soften the edges here delete my history

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:12.080 
soften the edges here delete my history
and<00:04:09.590> I<00:04:10.590> think<00:04:10.830> we've<00:04:10.950> got<00:04:11.100> that<00:04:11.280> foot<00:04:11.580> wrapped

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090 
and I think we've got that foot wrapped

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.000 
and I think we've got that foot wrapped
up<00:04:12.420> completely<00:04:12.990> nice<00:04:13.200> and<00:04:13.440> ready<00:04:13.590> for<00:04:13.800> toes

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
up completely nice and ready for toes

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.060 
up completely nice and ready for toes
which<00:04:14.459> was<00:04:14.670> that<00:04:15.290> fourth<00:04:16.290> step<00:04:16.620> that<00:04:16.859> we<00:04:16.980> were

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
which was that fourth step that we were

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.519 
which was that fourth step that we were
working<00:04:17.220> on
