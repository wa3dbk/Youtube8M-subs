00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:15.420
 [music] 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:17.310
 hello guys today finally at 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.859
 solo you a video on how to do here 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.600
 such a makeup result for me here 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.060
 it turns out so if you like that 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:27.330
 please proceed to watch and not 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:31.189
 scold me for the technique because 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.189
 pen and not the best 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:36.930
 perhaps it will seem strange to many 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:40.290
 but I never use powder or 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.510
 tonal your everyday makeup on 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.739
 This is my reason for the mass and therefore I 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.230
 I will not tell you now 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.739
 concealer I put on problem areas 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.410
 namely on the skin under the eyes to 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.559
 cover up our bruises in triangular 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.840
 form to look natural and 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:00.600
 I got a little pimple somewhere 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.329
 near the nose and there I will put concealer and 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.600
 between the eyebrows because this zone 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:09.180
 for some reason I am always reddish with 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:10.920
 help sponge from cops mix I'll 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.939
 Stir makeup on face to 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.939
 looked natural 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.770
 either i just put my favorite shadows 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.229
 from you at the expense of form 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:27.020
 I just adore this palette because 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:29.329
 it is exactly the same as newt from mac but 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.780
 a hundred times cheaper is my best 

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:31.780
 find 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.710
 I use a napkin so that everything 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:47.520
 stir without crossing the line and it is very 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:49.410
 handy trick by the way i use a brush and 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.720
 from ecotools they are certainly not so 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:54.060
 cool as brushes from sigma but at the same time 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:59.370
 They are very affordable and fit 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:02.160
 lovers on the inner corners of the eyes I 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:03.890
 I put shiny shadows in bright colors 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.570
 to make the view more open 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:09.920
 By the way, many models of victoria secret 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.920
 use this technique 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.659
 about this step i'm very much 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:21.579
 worried it seemed to me that I did not 

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:24.540
 get on the video to do it because 

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:28.150
 which is hard for me to live 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:30.069
 plan which i use order in 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.469
 real life is very often missed 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:34.180
 this step but in this video you wanted 

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:37.650
 just specify which form 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.650
 read arrows do 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.670
 this part of makeup i most 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.910
 I hate it because I wash it off very much 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.710
 hard mascara where 

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:04.430
 mascara that I use from the company 

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:07.430
 meybellin 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.810
 she steeply lengthens the cilia and therefore her 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.360
 and put the first 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:14.530
 and after it I use another mascara from 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:16.790
 Meibelin which cilia do. 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.980
 by the way mascara number one 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.630
 really my very first mascara I her 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:23.350
 still in use because me 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:25.910
 it seems that it really works 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:28.250
 What about technology that is used to 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:30.350
 their lips have been much controversy but not 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.270
 less I like this particular technique 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:34.060
 if you don't like you can do 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:36.860
 just different 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:39.110
 first I outline my lips for a bit 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:43.640
 crossing the line to make lips 

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:46.430
 visually more and then mac lipstick 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:50.080
 color cleveland lafite yes just 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.080
 fill the remaining space 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.440
 to make lipstick like me 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:02.610
 more matte 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:04.740
 I pass a napkin over my lips slightly 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:08.660
 pushing on came without wiping off the lipstick 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:11.610
 this will help remove the extra shine 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:13.320
 since my one eyebrow is shorter than the other and and 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.120
 I always try to do visually 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.620
 longer 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.720
 my eyebrows are thick enough 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.570
 so especially about the pencil i'm not 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:23.520
 I am steaming 

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:26.220
 at the end the main thing is to carefully comb 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.080
 eyebrows because it stirs a pencil 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.990
 and make it more natural on 

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.640
 your lessons 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:35.370
 by the way the most and your every not a matter but 

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:38.010
 if you want a tumblr effect 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:40.500
 eyebrow which is now so popular then 

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:43.590
 emphasize the shape of the eyebrow concealer and 

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:46.670
 stir well then it will do 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:49.350
 their visually neater and clear 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:51.510
 to emphasize the cheekbones which nature 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:52.170
 I was not particularly awarded I use 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:55.260
 bronzer 

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:57.980
 from estee lauder who comes in 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:00.690

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:02.280

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:03.960
