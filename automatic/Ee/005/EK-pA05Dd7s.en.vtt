00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.949
 see the second issue of anatomy transfer 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.960
 games in which we will talk about the third 

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:48.899
 parts of the prince of famous trilogy 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.370
 persia is also worth knowing that opinion 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.390
 author may not coincide with the opinion 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:56.960
 the viewer to me deeply fuck 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.960
 pleasant viewing 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.190
 the third part of the prince of persia is 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:14.890
 perhaps the most distressful state 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:16.930
 relog main problem 2 thrones 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.450
 proved to be the strongest competitor in the face 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:22.119
 codes thief who smashed 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.430
 prince on playstation as well as permanent 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:26.500
 transformation into game concepts which 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.270
 eventually led to her leaving 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.900
 not at all as planned 

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.300
 initially 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.220
 a bunch of uncomfortable questions for developers and 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.260
 The playerâ€™s screenwriter arises as early as 

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.600
 initial video 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:39.790
 first and foremost what the fuck 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.130
 the prince throws his amulet overboard 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:45.790
 who so often saved him from death 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:47.290
 In the second part, for example, I thought that 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.570
 time reversal 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:53.350
 this most valuable gift which must be protected 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:56.440
 like your car isn't it at all 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:59.560
 makes this a fucking damn answer to this 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:03.550
 there is simply no second question is also very 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:05.890
 uncomfortable what happened to viburnum where her 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:08.050
 huge mouthwatering booties on 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.970
 who called their u and thousands 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.530
 gamers 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.690
 how could so profane 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:16.150
 empress 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.340
 pitiful plot in two thrones 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.489
 frankly pulled by the ears and sucked out 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.110
 finger his main chip is 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:25.810
 inappropriate is simply a ridiculous return 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.549
 vizier glavgada from the first part which 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.350
 still dreaming to capture 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:31.150
 power over the world 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:35.980
 the old man ruthlessly kills the empress 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:37.420
 bastard paypal and turns into 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.340
 ugly sand monster 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.280
 and at the same time gives the prince magical 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.530
 abilities of chance of course also 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.150
 random loses the dagger of time which 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:48.940
 quickly falls into our hands 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.890
 dentures and so everything revolves around again 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.920
 save the world from the sand beasts and 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:56.920
 love intrigues princesses headlights yes and 

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:58.570
 headlight also returned at all to that johns 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.049
 a lot of parallels from the first part 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:01.870
 trilogy 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:03.760
 as the plot and gameplay is 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.860
 the impression that developed were trying to please 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:09.100
 all and fans of the first part and 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.630
 fans 2 turned out or not controversial 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.910
 question 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.800
 inherited from the sands of time game 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.780
 got a children's rating which 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:18.840
 implies a complete lack of hard 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.460
 violence mat and porn absurdity is that 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:22.680
 combat this system migrated from 

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:24.690
 sweet fate of the chieftain as we remember 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.520
 accompanied by the separation of limbs 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:28.680
 krovishchi kids on the ceiling 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:31.170
 now it was very funny to watch 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.510
 for how prince huyachit combo which 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.580
 the idea should tear off the tower to the enemy but 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:50.130
 it doesn't happen 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:51.690
 looks very ridiculous brighten 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:53.790
 gameplay called so-called 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:55.770
 secretive killings prince learned 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.270
 act quietly and stealing up the enemy from 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:59.550
 back without problems can crank 

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:01.740
 spectacular bomb which in an instant 

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:03.360
 send the enemy to the light from the player 

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:05.220
 you only need to click while left 

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:07.050
 click and stock up 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.270
 valerian in case the combo doesn't 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:12.210
 because then you have to fight 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:13.680
 a whole crowd of horned foes back 

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:14.730
 with the prince's magical abilities 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.680
 mentioned above 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.870
 now the prince by the will of the great 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.030
 the script turns into an ugly hell 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.760
 funny hair and it happens 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:25.710
 almost always at the most unexpected moment 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:28.320
 as soon as he manages to reach the water spell 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:30.240
 for the time being destroyed in the game for prince in 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.580
 dark appearance almost no pluses 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.200
 only one minus is constantly ending 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.480
 health which is performed only 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:37.610
 magic sand and chicks do not pick up 

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.170
 with such and fucked 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:42.210
 all that comes out of the dark hand 

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:44.070
 prince looks cool but in battle not 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.290
 much more efficient than a regular sword 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:47.910
 true clinging chain for all that sticks out 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:49.590
 you can jump further and thus 

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:52.260
 travel long distances to 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:53.550
 you will not be bored faster 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:55.560
 a voice that will often be 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:57.900
 comment on what is usually in 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:00.360
 funny form he is always ready to play a trick 

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:03.150
 over prince and how woman decide 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.540
 problems creating new ones or give valuable 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:08.080
 tips 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:10.270
 although of course the alter ego of the prince is not 

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:12.550
 is a positive character though 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:14.710
 cause sympathy worth telling i 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:16.450
 the bright prince in the first part he 

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:18.160
 a bunch and flaunted in front of us 

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:20.770
 often wagging my ass for that 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:22.780
 the side of the monitor in the second became abruptly 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:24.220
 brutal bearded straight and a 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:26.710
 The third part and it seems like at all 

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:28.750
 bisexual that is like and headlight him 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:29.980
 like a kind of like with a dark prince 

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:32.560
 he develops such a sickly 

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:34.720
 romance in the general orientation of the prince 

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.210
 which I certainly care about 

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:39.280
 covered in darkness 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:41.470
 incredibly deliver bosses to you for a long time 

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:44.190
 remembered a hefty fat man like 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:44.190
 crazy professor 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:55.270
 my goodness is going to burst 

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:07.089
 with him really have to tinker 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:08.919
 twin brothers and big axes 

00:06:07.089 --> 00:06:10.629
 who should just gape make 

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:12.969
 of you chops no matter how experienced 

00:06:10.629 --> 00:06:15.339
 gamers in this them well or trip 

00:06:12.969 --> 00:06:18.399
 riding wild pains and also 

00:06:15.339 --> 00:06:20.259
 spectacular final battle of communication for glory 

00:06:18.399 --> 00:06:22.300
 succeeded chariot races which 

00:06:20.259 --> 00:06:24.069
 something like shoots but even from 

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:26.199
 the second part of the player is required 

00:06:24.069 --> 00:06:27.819
 fit in right turns and in 

00:06:26.199 --> 00:06:30.430
 time to fend off enemies so as not to 

00:06:27.819 --> 00:06:32.439
 you can not slow down time, but 

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:34.419
 reel back if you can fail 

00:06:32.439 --> 00:06:36.849
 nitro and court tuning unfortunately not 

00:06:34.419 --> 00:06:38.740
 screwed one of the strongest sides 

00:06:36.849 --> 00:06:41.439
 games is the local atmosphere 

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:43.119
 she is just wonderful not only because 

00:06:41.439 --> 00:06:45.279
 great design but also gorgeous 

00:06:43.119 --> 00:06:47.979
 music component and here's the graphics 

00:06:45.279 --> 00:06:50.439
 frankly fucking can't be said otherwise 

00:06:47.979 --> 00:06:52.569
 character models just God forbid 

00:06:50.439 --> 00:06:54.399
 square shoulders prince triangular 

00:06:52.569 --> 00:06:55.330
 boobs headlights and low poly 

00:06:54.399 --> 00:06:57.689
 identical enemies 

00:06:55.330 --> 00:07:00.129
 cause melancholy and badly affect an erection 

00:06:57.689 --> 00:07:02.020
 about a bunch of minor flaws like 

00:07:00.129 --> 00:07:04.389
 even falling through the hair 

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:06.370
 speaking somehow awkward by and large 

00:07:04.389 --> 00:07:08.289
 the third part of the trilogy despite all 

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:09.959
 shortcomings and a lot of controversial moments 

00:07:08.289 --> 00:07:12.939
 turned out a good game 

00:07:09.959 --> 00:07:14.769
 good but no more passing and and i 

00:07:12.939 --> 00:07:16.709
 sincerely enjoyed it 

00:07:14.769 --> 00:07:20.879
 perhaps the main argument in favor of the game 

00:07:16.709 --> 00:07:23.889
 my score is as much as 8 points out of 10 

00:07:20.879 --> 00:07:26.080
 Here came the end of my review of all this 

00:07:23.889 --> 00:07:31.050
 time with you was Vasily Zabubensky 

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:31.050
 see you in exactly 18 days bye
