the<00:00:04.740> integration<00:00:05.310> into<00:00:05.730> our<00:00:05.910> science

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
the integration into our science

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.210 
the integration into our science
curriculum<00:00:07.170> in<00:00:07.319> class<00:00:07.529> has<00:00:07.740> been<00:00:07.859> a<00:00:07.919> very

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
curriculum in class has been a very

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.070 
curriculum in class has been a very
successful<00:00:08.460> learning<00:00:08.940> experience<00:00:09.150> I<00:00:09.780> found

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
successful learning experience I found

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.589 
successful learning experience I found
that<00:00:10.200> the<00:00:10.349> Lego<00:00:10.530> education<00:00:11.280> system<00:00:11.790> really

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
that the Lego education system really

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.660 
that the Lego education system really
addressed<00:00:13.019> meeting<00:00:13.980> the<00:00:14.099> needs<00:00:14.280> of<00:00:14.429> all

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
addressed meeting the needs of all

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.070 
addressed meeting the needs of all
learners<00:00:14.700> no<00:00:15.450> matter<00:00:15.660> how<00:00:16.500> diverse<00:00:16.920> no<00:00:17.369> matter

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:18.080 
learners no matter how diverse no matter

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:20.240 
learners no matter how diverse no matter
academically<00:00:19.080> where<00:00:19.439> they<00:00:19.590> were<00:00:19.650> performing

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
academically where they were performing

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.010 
academically where they were performing
in<00:00:20.340> other<00:00:20.520> areas<00:00:21.029> they<00:00:21.240> were<00:00:21.300> all<00:00:21.630> able<00:00:21.869> to

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
in other areas they were all able to

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.660 
in other areas they were all able to
achieve<00:00:22.230> and<00:00:22.560> be<00:00:22.590> successful<00:00:22.859> using<00:00:23.430> these

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
achieve and be successful using these

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.120 
achieve and be successful using these
materials<00:00:26.570> they<00:00:27.570> had<00:00:28.230> high<00:00:28.410> interest<00:00:28.800> level

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
materials they had high interest level

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.040 
materials they had high interest level
right<00:00:29.279> from<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.580> start<00:00:29.880> because<00:00:30.210> it<00:00:30.720> really

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
right from the start because it really

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.510 
right from the start because it really
puts<00:00:31.260> the<00:00:31.410> learning<00:00:31.769> in<00:00:31.949> the<00:00:32.130> hands<00:00:32.309> of<00:00:32.430> the

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
puts the learning in the hands of the

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.729 
puts the learning in the hands of the
students<00:00:32.880> I<00:00:33.149> think<00:00:33.270> it<00:00:33.630> helps<00:00:33.930> me<00:00:34.200> learn<00:00:34.530> you

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
students I think it helps me learn you

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.869 
students I think it helps me learn you
remember<00:00:35.219> because<00:00:35.610> I<00:00:36.290> can<00:00:37.290> actually<00:00:37.559> feel<00:00:38.370> it

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
remember because I can actually feel it

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.530 
remember because I can actually feel it
and<00:00:39.890> do<00:00:40.890> it<00:00:40.920> with<00:00:41.219> my<00:00:41.489> hands<00:00:41.730> instead<00:00:42.120> of<00:00:42.360> like

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
and do it with my hands instead of like

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.990 
and do it with my hands instead of like
the<00:00:43.410> teacher<00:00:43.680> doing<00:00:44.010> it<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.370> just<00:00:44.399> watching

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
the teacher doing it and just watching

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.630 
the teacher doing it and just watching
her<00:00:45.180> do<00:00:45.420> it<00:00:45.450> they<00:00:46.379> really<00:00:46.649> didn't<00:00:46.950> realize<00:00:47.489> at

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
her do it they really didn't realize at

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.790 
her do it they really didn't realize at
the<00:00:47.670> time<00:00:47.760> how<00:00:48.000> much<00:00:48.539> they<00:00:48.750> were<00:00:48.809> learning<00:00:49.230> but

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
the time how much they were learning but

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.260 
the time how much they were learning but
through<00:00:50.039> a<00:00:50.070> review<00:00:50.430> I<00:00:50.460> can<00:00:50.820> tell<00:00:51.000> that<00:00:51.030> they've

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
through a review I can tell that they've

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.970 
through a review I can tell that they've
retained<00:00:51.690> so<00:00:52.110> much<00:00:52.289> more<00:00:52.530> than<00:00:52.710> what<00:00:52.829> they

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
retained so much more than what they

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.410 
retained so much more than what they
would<00:00:53.160> have<00:00:53.190> had<00:00:53.879> this<00:00:54.030> just<00:00:54.270> been<00:00:54.390> a

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
would have had this just been a

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.350 
would have had this just been a
paper/pencil<00:00:55.170> lesson<00:00:55.559> I<00:00:55.710> think<00:00:55.800> that<00:00:56.520> usually

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
paper/pencil lesson I think that usually

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.209 
paper/pencil lesson I think that usually
if<00:00:57.600> we<00:00:57.840> wouldn't<00:00:58.140> have<00:00:58.230> had<00:00:58.410> this<00:00:58.590> experience

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
if we wouldn't have had this experience

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.590 
if we wouldn't have had this experience
we<00:00:59.370> would<00:00:59.550> have<00:00:59.670> been<00:00:59.760> doing<00:00:59.969> this<00:01:00.149> on<00:01:00.300> paper

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
we would have been doing this on paper

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.689 
we would have been doing this on paper
and<00:01:00.899> it<00:01:00.989> would<00:01:01.170> have<00:01:01.289> just<00:01:01.530> been<00:01:01.739> a<00:01:02.160> lot<00:01:02.430> harder

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
and it would have just been a lot harder

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:06.709 
and it would have just been a lot harder
to<00:01:02.969> understand

00:01:06.709 --> 00:01:06.719 

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:09.889 

math<00:01:07.409> is<00:01:07.799> a<00:01:07.859> tie-in<00:01:08.700> to<00:01:08.729> science<00:01:09.210> most<00:01:09.450> often

00:01:09.889 --> 00:01:09.899 
math is a tie-in to science most often

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:12.709 
math is a tie-in to science most often
we<00:01:10.380> use<00:01:10.409> terms<00:01:10.829> with<00:01:11.039> ratio<00:01:11.460> right<00:01:11.909> angles<00:01:12.420> the

00:01:12.709 --> 00:01:12.719 
we use terms with ratio right angles the

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:14.599 
we use terms with ratio right angles the
effect<00:01:13.020> that<00:01:13.109> that<00:01:13.200> had<00:01:13.560> on<00:01:13.859> the<00:01:13.890> build<00:01:14.460> that

00:01:14.599 --> 00:01:14.609 
effect that that had on the build that

00:01:14.609 --> 00:01:17.539 
effect that that had on the build that
they<00:01:14.759> were<00:01:14.819> working<00:01:15.060> on<00:01:15.359> I<00:01:15.659> liked<00:01:16.170> how<00:01:16.710> it<00:01:17.130> was

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
they were working on I liked how it was

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:21.889 
they were working on I liked how it was
shaped<00:01:18.240> like<00:01:18.359> a<00:01:18.479> right<00:01:18.840> angle<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:19.700> and<00:01:20.899> and

00:01:21.889 --> 00:01:21.899 
shaped like a right angle and and and

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:24.980 
shaped like a right angle and and and
the<00:01:22.380> small<00:01:22.740> wheel<00:01:23.039> thing<00:01:23.520> hit<00:01:24.179> the<00:01:24.450> video<00:01:24.659> and

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
the small wheel thing hit the video and

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.459 
the small wheel thing hit the video and
so<00:01:25.170> it<00:01:25.289> could<00:01:25.439> move<00:01:25.819> the<00:01:26.819> gears<00:01:27.450> turn<00:01:27.810> like<00:01:28.229> if

00:01:28.459 --> 00:01:28.469 
so it could move the gears turn like if

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:31.010 
so it could move the gears turn like if
they're<00:01:28.709> the<00:01:28.920> same<00:01:29.159> size<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:30.390> two<00:01:30.599> gears<00:01:30.780> are

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
they're the same size the two gears are

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.990 
they're the same size the two gears are
the<00:01:31.109> same<00:01:31.289> size<00:01:31.530> they're<00:01:31.770> gonna<00:01:31.920> spin<00:01:32.250> faster

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
the same size they're gonna spin faster

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.389 
the same size they're gonna spin faster
because<00:01:33.899> their<00:01:34.109> teeth<00:01:34.349> are<00:01:34.740> all<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.009> same

00:01:35.389 --> 00:01:35.399 
because their teeth are all the same

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:38.569 
because their teeth are all the same
size<00:01:35.729> but<00:01:36.030> if<00:01:36.270> you<00:01:36.630> have<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:37.049> smaller<00:01:37.579> driven

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
size but if you have a smaller driven

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.089 
size but if you have a smaller driven
gear<00:01:38.969> then<00:01:39.360> it's<00:01:39.569> gonna<00:01:39.750> get<00:01:39.959> slower<00:01:40.409> the

00:01:41.089 --> 00:01:41.099 
gear then it's gonna get slower the

00:01:41.099 --> 00:01:42.469 
gear then it's gonna get slower the
diagrams<00:01:41.610> that<00:01:41.819> they're<00:01:42.000> looking<00:01:42.149> at<00:01:42.420> and

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
diagrams that they're looking at and

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.449 
diagrams that they're looking at and
studying<00:01:42.989> that's<00:01:43.379> you<00:01:43.829> know<00:01:43.920> a<00:01:43.950> text<00:01:44.280> feature

00:01:44.449 --> 00:01:44.459 
studying that's you know a text feature

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:48.020 
studying that's you know a text feature
that<00:01:44.789> we<00:01:45.349> stress<00:01:46.349> and<00:01:46.590> reading<00:01:46.890> and<00:01:47.009> to<00:01:47.520> help

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
that we stress and reading and to help

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.429 
that we stress and reading and to help
them<00:01:48.149> understand<00:01:48.599> their<00:01:49.140> reading

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
them understand their reading

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:53.719 
them understand their reading
comprehension<00:01:49.560> and<00:01:50.069> how<00:01:50.129> to<00:01:50.189> read<00:01:50.399> a<00:01:50.429> diagram

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.459 

the<00:01:54.240> students<00:01:54.600> were<00:01:54.689> in<00:01:54.780> charge<00:01:54.930> of<00:01:55.110> learning

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:55.469 
the students were in charge of learning

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:57.469 
the students were in charge of learning
this<00:01:55.649> and<00:01:55.979> that<00:01:56.909> seemed<00:01:57.240> to<00:01:57.360> make

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
this and that seemed to make

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.539 
this and that seemed to make
observations<00:01:57.890> where<00:01:58.890> I<00:01:58.920> had<00:01:59.189> not<00:01:59.369> already

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
observations where I had not already

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.160 
observations where I had not already
given<00:02:00.180> them<00:02:00.360> they<00:02:00.719> were<00:02:00.780> able<00:02:01.020> to

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
given them they were able to
