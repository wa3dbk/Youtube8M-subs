 well that's it's everybody 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.100
 risky cost I hope you go 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.390
 all very well friends today we 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.269
 is found for a new video 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.159
 regarding youtube subscriptions one 

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:44.699
 Video here with no ill enough information 

00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:46.440
 important 

00:00:44.699 --> 00:00:47.850
 as you could see gmi intro 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.260
 of code qg in any case I thank them 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.000
 of advanced poses me since I count their 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.010
 send this little video for what 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.079
 is the gameplay we are on black ops 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.119
 two old gameplay to me in melee 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.949
 general the gases on the flames map to 

00:00:57.119 --> 00:00:59.969
 the msm so it's not very gameplay 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.530
 very important but it's a melee 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.159
 general nice enough that goes pretty well 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.690
 happen 

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:04.860
 I will still detail you a 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.630
 little place for those 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.520
 so interested play with to lighten 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.869
 robust and these extreme conditions 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.399
 and for the series of 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.679
 appointments I was playing with drones 

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:14.729
 lightning and stealthy aircraft so 

00:01:13.679 --> 00:01:16.409
 that's what's a little bit of 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.819
 gameplay but that's how I said it's 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.710
 not what is most important in 

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:21.060
 this video is simply the 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.280
 subject since I'm going to give you a 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.899
 pretty important info 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.039
 so in fact recently I'm all of 

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:27.179
 subsequently attacked since I have not too much 

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:29.759
 time to know that the gameplay is 

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:31.799
 pretty fast so in fact recently 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.990
 youtube sent to his partners 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:36.600
 french so here's for laon the clanche 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.439
 speaking here is french partners a 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.329
 E-mail 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.950
 concerning the arrival of the 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.270
 paying subscriptions friends so 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.799
 attention and youtube does not become 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.119
 paying I still want to put a 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.500
 stop all those who are in the process of 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.799
 to be careful and youtube gets paid 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.479
 in one year 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.880
 it's only subscriptions so 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.729
 it's a little more than subscriptions 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.520
 who will arrive on youtube 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.469
 so all that and of course reliable I you 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.960
 will put in the description the link of the 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.700
 site where I have strong from my sources at wholesale 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.049
 this is so youtube basically 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.579
 I will give you in this video the 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.890
 price the advantages of the disadvantages 

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:10.289
 finally what are you going to have in 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.880
 paying a youtube subscription so already 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.260
 so it's not free I'm not going too 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.489
 debate in this video of if this is 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.049
 good or not good etc 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:17.310
 it's not for me to judge but 

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:19.500
 only give you the info 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.840
 necessary concerning precisely these 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.609
 subscriptions youtube so in fact according to 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.640
 an american magazine 

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:28.799
 this subscription will cost around $ 10 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.980
 guys then $ 10 that's 9 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:34.079
 euros 30 in euros so that's 9 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.420
 30 euros will make 30 euros anywhere 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:37.500
 what but finally, well, that's not it 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.850
 free frankly I find it a 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.890
 little bit expensive I think it's by 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.960
 month 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.330
 is not given I spent how 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.430
 time the subscription hard that I did not have 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.840
 information on it in any case it is 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.870
 will know I think very soon we will 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:53.060
 to be informed of all this is actually it 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.560
 so simply allow the sword 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:57.680
 to the people who will take the subscription 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.360
 youtube to download the videos on 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.490
 their mobile devices and 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:04.010
 look at without having the wii done so in 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:05.660
 being orly and not having any more 

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.820
 youtube ads 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.590
 so here are two ends of not having 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:12.950
 the commercials on the videos if you 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:14.830
 prefer but here are the consequences and 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.480
 the partners will have to obligatorily 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:18.920
 make some of their 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.620
 videos to paying subscribers 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.390
 finally to subscribers who have paid so under 

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.730
 worth seeing the full videos 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:27.860
 presented on their channel privately 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.050
 friends so here what I deduce that 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.970
 means that basically the people who 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:34.250
 will take a subscription will see 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:35.450
 videos that are privately on our 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.340
 chains so that I have a little bit of 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.200
 wrong to understand exactly what that 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.780
 means for those who understood 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:43.220
 do not hesitate to a little debate 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.290
 in the comments it's going to be a 

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:47.570
 big little rocker that you 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.670
 have understood by that precisely by 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:52.280
 this consequence I have a little bit of 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.180
 wrong because I do not see finally I 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.070
 find it a little bit of enemies that would want 

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:56.480
 to say that when we put a video on us 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:57.890
 a channel on our youtube channel 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.870
 it means that people who have paid 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:01.760
 a subscription will be able to see them and that I 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:03.829
 find it a bit shocking even I find 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:04.970
 it's a little hot but hey I do not think so 

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:07.160
 that's it but if that's it 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:09.500
 do not hesitate by my sentence to tell me 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.140
 what did you understand this video 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:13.670
 of a fake she is there too for you 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.780
 make interacting make you debate and 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:15.920
 tell me what you understood because 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.840
 that even I have a little bit like me 

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.489
 I'm lost I saw that and I wanted 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.229
 really make you this video but 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:22.789
 I did not exactly understand that term 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:24.530
 and finally brief 

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:26.990
 so here is actually that these info 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.280
 for now so far on on his 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:31.310
 paid subscriptions good there's no big 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.030
 thing either to say I told you the 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:33.560
 consequences 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.700
 what is it going to bring you there is 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.229
 only these two things so that wants 

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:38.630
 may be added as and when 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:39.680
 I also give you the price we did not 

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:41.660
 no more info than that for now 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.860
 so in any case, that's already the end 

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:44.120
 of this video so do not hesitate a 

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.800
 little bit of debate in the comments 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:47.450
 good not debated either remains that 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:48.800
 it's good or not that's it I mean 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:51.080
 today if youtube way it's not 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.210
 mandatory as I said we can 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:55.520
 always use the youtube platform 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:56.930
 just an add so that's it 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.789
 do not hesitate also to try one 

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:00.979
 little live that would do it always 

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:02.180
 pleasure and then and so here I am 

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:04.729

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:06.009

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:09.949
 a good little general scrum and 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.539
 I hope you enjoy the gameplay 

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:12.650
