00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
time and you'll see that it does look a

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.399 
time and you'll see that it does look a
lot<00:01:29.070> smoother<00:01:29.579> but<00:01:30.270> actually<00:01:30.689> i<00:01:30.900> think<00:01:31.079> what

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
lot smoother but actually i think what

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:34.039 
lot smoother but actually i think what
2k<00:01:31.740> did<00:01:31.950> is<00:01:32.329> they<00:01:33.329> sort<00:01:33.540> of<00:01:33.630> looked<00:01:33.750> at<00:01:33.900> what

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
2k did is they sort of looked at what

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.020 
2k did is they sort of looked at what
the<00:01:34.140> show<00:01:34.380> did<00:01:34.409> i<00:01:34.799> do<00:01:34.860> believe<00:01:35.159> i'm<00:01:35.400> not<00:01:35.670> one

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
the show did i do believe i'm not one

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.539 
the show did i do believe i'm not one
hundred<00:01:36.119> percent<00:01:36.299> sure<00:01:36.600> but<00:01:37.250> I've<00:01:38.250> watched

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
hundred percent sure but I've watched

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.819 
hundred percent sure but I've watched
some<00:01:38.729> MLB<00:01:39.000> too<00:01:39.360> sorry<00:01:40.079> and<00:01:40.320> will<00:01:40.409> be<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.680> show

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
some MLB too sorry and will be the show

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.910 
some MLB too sorry and will be the show
videos<00:01:41.659> the<00:01:42.659> pitching<00:01:43.020> looks<00:01:43.200> pretty<00:01:43.710> similar

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
videos the pitching looks pretty similar

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.249 
videos the pitching looks pretty similar
to<00:01:44.159> those<00:01:44.490> so<00:01:44.909> I<00:01:45.119> think<00:01:45.450> what<00:01:45.780> they<00:01:45.899> did<00:01:46.110> is

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
to those so I think what they did is

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.490 
to those so I think what they did is
they<00:01:46.290> tried<00:01:46.740> to<00:01:46.950> mimic<00:01:47.640> what<00:01:48.450> the<00:01:49.259> show<00:01:49.470> did

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
they tried to mimic what the show did

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.910 
they tried to mimic what the show did
with<00:01:49.829> their<00:01:50.009> pitching<00:01:50.720> but<00:01:51.720> um<00:01:51.930> basically

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
with their pitching but um basically

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.920 
with their pitching but um basically
pitching<00:01:53.430> controls<00:01:53.970> are<00:01:54.119> all<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.360> same<00:01:54.570> still

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
pitching controls are all the same still

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.020 
pitching controls are all the same still
on<00:01:55.229> they<00:01:55.890> couldn't<00:01:55.920> really<00:01:56.340> improve<00:01:56.700> on<00:01:56.880> those

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
on they couldn't really improve on those

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.660 
on they couldn't really improve on those
those<00:01:57.329> are<00:01:57.570> pretty<00:01:57.780> solid<00:01:58.290> I<00:01:58.500> even<00:01:59.310> think<00:01:59.579> the

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
those are pretty solid I even think the

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.870 
those are pretty solid I even think the
show<00:01:59.939> was<00:02:00.360> trying<00:02:00.689> to<00:02:01.369> go<00:02:02.369> to<00:02:02.430> similar

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
show was trying to go to similar

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.569 
show was trying to go to similar
controls<00:02:03.390> I<00:02:03.659> do<00:02:03.780> believe<00:02:04.310> but<00:02:05.310> those<00:02:05.490> have

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
controls I do believe but those have

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.890 
controls I do believe but those have
always<00:02:05.759> been<00:02:05.969> good<00:02:06.119> for<00:02:06.299> 2k

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:07.900 
always been good for 2k

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.749 
always been good for 2k
um<00:02:07.990> the<00:02:08.619> cutscenes<00:02:09.100> have<00:02:09.280> gotten<00:02:09.520> a<00:02:09.580> lot<00:02:09.700> of

00:02:09.749 --> 00:02:09.759 
um the cutscenes have gotten a lot of

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:13.080 
um the cutscenes have gotten a lot of
letters<00:02:10.060> you<00:02:10.240> see<00:02:10.420> their<00:02:11.640> batter<00:02:12.640> stepping

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
letters you see their batter stepping

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.060 
letters you see their batter stepping
out<00:02:13.180> of<00:02:13.210> the<00:02:13.360> box<00:02:13.390> a<00:02:13.810> little<00:02:13.840> bit<00:02:14.080> just

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
out of the box a little bit just

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:16.740 
out of the box a little bit just
collecting<00:02:15.730> these<00:02:15.820> thoughts<00:02:16.120> it<00:02:16.390> just<00:02:16.420> looks

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
collecting these thoughts it just looks

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.450 
collecting these thoughts it just looks
a<00:02:16.840> lot<00:02:16.990> better<00:02:17.140> than<00:02:17.470> it<00:02:17.500> did<00:02:17.710> last<00:02:17.770> year<00:02:18.160> in

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.460 
a lot better than it did last year in

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:22.470 
a lot better than it did last year in
New<00:02:19.090> Year's<00:02:19.240> pass<00:02:19.450> for<00:02:19.720> 2k<00:02:20.050> and<00:02:21.090> the<00:02:22.090> one<00:02:22.270> thing

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:22.480 
New Year's pass for 2k and the one thing

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.020 
New Year's pass for 2k and the one thing
that<00:02:22.510> they<00:02:22.870> brought<00:02:23.080> back<00:02:23.320> it's<00:02:23.740> not<00:02:24.040> that<00:02:24.790> big

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
that they brought back it's not that big

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.300 
that they brought back it's not that big
of<00:02:25.090> a<00:02:25.180> deal<00:02:25.360> but<00:02:25.600> when<00:02:26.410> you<00:02:26.440> hit<00:02:26.680> a<00:02:26.710> ball<00:02:26.980> that

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
of a deal but when you hit a ball that

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.460 
of a deal but when you hit a ball that
little<00:02:27.850> like<00:02:28.090> line<00:02:28.480> thing<00:02:28.930> I<00:02:29.140> don't<00:02:29.290> think

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
little like line thing I don't think

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.520 
little like line thing I don't think
they<00:02:29.560> had<00:02:29.740> that<00:02:29.950> in<00:02:30.100> 2k11<00:02:30.900> they<00:02:31.900> headed<00:02:32.170> in<00:02:32.230> 2k

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
they had that in 2k11 they headed in 2k

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:34.200 
they had that in 2k11 they headed in 2k
10<00:02:32.740> I<00:02:32.770> know<00:02:32.920> that<00:02:33.220> end<00:02:33.430> in<00:02:33.580> previous<00:02:34.060> versions

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210 
10 I know that end in previous versions

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:36.000 
10 I know that end in previous versions
of<00:02:34.600> the<00:02:34.690> game<00:02:34.720> i<00:02:35.080> don't<00:02:35.320> really<00:02:35.470> like<00:02:35.590> that<00:02:35.890> it

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
of the game i don't really like that it

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.400 
of the game i don't really like that it
looks<00:02:36.160> pretty<00:02:36.250> unrealistic<00:02:36.870> but<00:02:37.870> that's<00:02:38.080> okay

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
looks pretty unrealistic but that's okay

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.170 
looks pretty unrealistic but that's okay
I<00:02:38.620> mean<00:02:39.010> it's<00:02:39.100> not<00:02:39.130> really<00:02:39.340> that<00:02:39.520> big<00:02:39.790> a<00:02:39.850> deal

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
I mean it's not really that big a deal

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:46.760 
I mean it's not really that big a deal
some<00:02:41.110> for<00:02:41.560> some<00:02:41.709> people<00:02:41.980> might<00:02:42.280> be<00:02:44.790> and<00:02:45.790> also<00:02:45.940> I

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
some for some people might be and also I

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.500 
some for some people might be and also I
noticed<00:02:47.770> that<00:02:47.980> the<00:02:48.430> graphics<00:02:48.880> do<00:02:49.120> look<00:02:49.390> a

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
noticed that the graphics do look a

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:51.540 
noticed that the graphics do look a
little<00:02:49.540> bit<00:02:49.900> better<00:02:50.080> just<00:02:50.590> the<00:02:50.709> shading<00:02:51.220> and

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:51.550 
little bit better just the shading and

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.460 
little bit better just the shading and
lighting<00:02:52.090> I<00:02:52.450> mean<00:02:52.900> I'm<00:02:53.020> a<00:02:53.050> guy<00:02:53.230> that<00:02:53.410> will

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
lighting I mean I'm a guy that will

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.980 
lighting I mean I'm a guy that will
notice<00:02:53.860> that<00:02:53.910> as<00:02:54.910> you<00:02:55.030> see<00:02:55.180> there<00:02:55.360> that's<00:02:55.870> a

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:55.990 
notice that as you see there that's a

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:58.110 
notice that as you see there that's a
realistic<00:02:56.260> shadow<00:02:56.770> on<00:02:57.130> the<00:02:57.190> play<00:02:57.640> right<00:02:57.880> there

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
realistic shadow on the play right there

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.880 
realistic shadow on the play right there
and<00:02:58.450> from<00:02:58.690> his<00:02:58.840> helmet<00:02:59.230> and<00:02:59.260> his<00:02:59.410> head<00:02:59.650> all

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
and from his helmet and his head all

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.590 
and from his helmet and his head all
that<00:03:00.310> stuff<00:03:00.670> so<00:03:02.610> they<00:03:03.610> also<00:03:03.760> improved<00:03:04.330> what

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
that stuff so they also improved what

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:07.650 
that stuff so they also improved what
the<00:03:04.780> jerseys<00:03:05.200> look<00:03:05.350> like<00:03:05.590> you<00:03:05.740> see<00:03:06.070> some<00:03:06.660> some

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
the jerseys look like you see some some

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.570 
the jerseys look like you see some some
I<00:03:07.990> don't<00:03:08.950> know<00:03:09.010> I<00:03:09.040> guess<00:03:09.220> you<00:03:09.370> could<00:03:09.490> say

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:09.580 
I don't know I guess you could say

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.229 
I don't know I guess you could say
wrinkled<00:03:09.970> up<00:03:10.060> pants<00:03:10.510> stuff<00:03:11.110> like<00:03:11.260> that<00:03:12.239> the

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
wrinkled up pants stuff like that the

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:15.330 
wrinkled up pants stuff like that the
cameras<00:03:13.690> are<00:03:13.810> a<00:03:13.989> little<00:03:14.530> bit<00:03:14.739> better<00:03:14.920> but<00:03:15.220> I'm

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
cameras are a little bit better but I'm

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.190 
cameras are a little bit better but I'm
pretty<00:03:15.459> sure<00:03:15.610> there's<00:03:15.700> the<00:03:16.269> exact<00:03:16.690> same<00:03:16.959> as

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
pretty sure there's the exact same as

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.470 
pretty sure there's the exact same as
2k11<00:03:17.620> I<00:03:18.220> just<00:03:18.489> probably<00:03:18.610> haven't<00:03:18.940> noticed<00:03:19.000> it

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
2k11 I just probably haven't noticed it

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.500 
2k11 I just probably haven't noticed it
I<00:03:20.380> don't<00:03:21.160> know<00:03:21.250> if<00:03:21.370> you're<00:03:21.519> aware<00:03:22.180> of<00:03:22.239> this<00:03:22.360> but

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 
I don't know if you're aware of this but

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.960 
I don't know if you're aware of this but
for<00:03:23.110> 2k<00:03:23.410> 11<00:03:23.440> i<00:03:23.830> do<00:03:23.890> believe<00:03:24.190> for<00:03:24.550> the<00:03:24.610> pitching

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
for 2k 11 i do believe for the pitching

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.720 
for 2k 11 i do believe for the pitching
camera<00:03:25.390> they<00:03:25.959> put<00:03:26.200> it<00:03:26.320> as<00:03:26.500> what<00:03:26.950> they're<00:03:27.190> the

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
camera they put it as what they're the

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:33.360 
camera they put it as what they're the
home<00:03:27.910> team's<00:03:28.530> um<00:03:29.530> i<00:03:31.410> think<00:03:32.410> TV<00:03:32.920> station<00:03:33.280> would

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
home team's um i think TV station would

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.729 
home team's um i think TV station would
have<00:03:33.519> it<00:03:33.700> at<00:03:33.850> i<00:03:34.060> do<00:03:34.239> believe<00:03:34.570> so<00:03:35.290> that's

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
have it at i do believe so that's

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:37.199 
have it at i do believe so that's
probably<00:03:35.980> because<00:03:36.280> I'm<00:03:36.580> not<00:03:36.730> used<00:03:36.940> to<00:03:37.060> playing

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
probably because I'm not used to playing

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:39.960 
probably because I'm not used to playing
as<00:03:37.600> the<00:03:37.900> Cardinals<00:03:38.410> I<00:03:38.650> guess<00:03:39.310> I<00:03:39.430> just<00:03:39.459> noticed

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:39.970 
as the Cardinals I guess I just noticed

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:41.340 
as the Cardinals I guess I just noticed
it<00:03:40.060> in<00:03:40.180> that<00:03:40.330> sense<00:03:40.600> because<00:03:40.870> i<00:03:40.959> usually<00:03:41.080> play

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:41.350 
it in that sense because i usually play

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:43.190 
it in that sense because i usually play
as<00:03:41.530> the<00:03:41.620> Blue<00:03:41.769> Jays<00:03:41.980> when<00:03:42.220> I<00:03:42.250> play<00:03:42.400> this<00:03:42.519> game

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
as the Blue Jays when I play this game

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.050 
as the Blue Jays when I play this game
so<00:03:44.200> uh<00:03:44.230> I<00:03:44.860> guess<00:03:44.980> yeah<00:03:45.700> that's<00:03:45.880> pretty

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
so uh I guess yeah that's pretty

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:51.990 
so uh I guess yeah that's pretty
realistic<00:03:48.720> but<00:03:49.720> uh<00:03:50.340> pretty<00:03:51.340> much<00:03:51.370> a<00:03:51.519> lot<00:03:51.880> of

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
realistic but uh pretty much a lot of

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.740 
realistic but uh pretty much a lot of
stuff<00:03:52.209> still<00:03:52.630> the<00:03:52.750> same<00:03:53.019> as<00:03:53.799> you<00:03:53.950> see<00:03:54.160> there

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:54.750 
stuff still the same as you see there

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:57.000 
stuff still the same as you see there
pitching<00:03:55.750> mechanics<00:03:55.900> and<00:03:56.380> actually<00:03:56.860> like

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
pitching mechanics and actually like

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.070 
pitching mechanics and actually like
that<00:03:57.220> little<00:03:57.540> animation<00:03:58.540> right<00:03:58.690> there<00:03:58.900> as

00:03:59.070 --> 00:03:59.080 
that little animation right there as

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.930 
that little animation right there as
their<00:03:59.769> battery<00:04:00.310> was<00:04:00.400> stepping<00:04:00.700> out<00:04:00.790> of<00:04:00.820> the

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:00.940 
their battery was stepping out of the

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.479 
their battery was stepping out of the
box<00:04:00.970> he<00:04:01.299> picked<00:04:01.630> up<00:04:01.750> some<00:04:01.959> dirt<00:04:02.290> from<00:04:02.530> the

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:03.489 
box he picked up some dirt from the

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:05.699 
box he picked up some dirt from the
batter's<00:04:04.360> box<00:04:04.390> and<00:04:04.810> put<00:04:04.989> it<00:04:05.080> in<00:04:05.200> his<00:04:05.260> gloves<00:04:05.530> to

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:05.709 
batter's box and put it in his gloves to

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:07.680 
batter's box and put it in his gloves to
get<00:04:05.830> one<00:04:05.920> more<00:04:06.040> grip<00:04:06.310> on<00:04:06.580> the<00:04:06.700> bat<00:04:06.880> I<00:04:07.180> think

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
get one more grip on the bat I think

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:08.850 
get one more grip on the bat I think
that's<00:04:07.840> pretty<00:04:07.989> realistic<00:04:08.290> they<00:04:08.620> didn't<00:04:08.769> had

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:08.860 
that's pretty realistic they didn't had

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:11.250 
that's pretty realistic they didn't had
that<00:04:09.010> last<00:04:09.220> year<00:04:09.430> I<00:04:09.489> know<00:04:09.670> that<00:04:09.880> for<00:04:10.060> sure<00:04:10.260> it's

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 
that last year I know that for sure it's

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.490 
that last year I know that for sure it's
just<00:04:11.350> a<00:04:11.470> little<00:04:11.650> fixes<00:04:12.010> like<00:04:12.190> that<00:04:13.380> i'm<00:04:14.380> going

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:14.500 
just a little fixes like that i'm going

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:16.410 
just a little fixes like that i'm going
to<00:04:14.560> show<00:04:14.739> you<00:04:14.769> later<00:04:15.340> on<00:04:15.489> here<00:04:15.880> in<00:04:15.970> this<00:04:16.090> video

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:16.420 
to show you later on here in this video

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:18.030 
to show you later on here in this video
there<00:04:16.600> is<00:04:16.630> a<00:04:16.750> little<00:04:17.109> bit<00:04:17.230> of<00:04:17.320> a<00:04:17.380> glitch<00:04:17.650> with

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:18.040 
there is a little bit of a glitch with

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.569 
there is a little bit of a glitch with
base<00:04:18.609> running

00:04:19.569 --> 00:04:19.579 
base running

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:21.849 
base running
I<00:04:19.699> believe<00:04:20.299> they<00:04:20.419> will<00:04:20.569> fix<00:04:20.840> it<00:04:21.019> though<00:04:21.169> once

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:21.859 
I believe they will fix it though once

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:24.999 
I believe they will fix it though once
they<00:04:21.979> released<00:04:22.430> the<00:04:22.550> first<00:04:22.699> patch<00:04:23.560> but<00:04:24.560> so<00:04:24.770> far

00:04:24.999 --> 00:04:25.009 
they released the first patch but so far

00:04:25.009 --> 00:04:27.129 
they released the first patch but so far
I'm<00:04:25.159> liking<00:04:25.189> it<00:04:25.669> I<00:04:25.909> had<00:04:26.389> a<00:04:26.449> pretty<00:04:26.599> fun<00:04:26.930> time

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:27.139 
I'm liking it I had a pretty fun time

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:30.459 
I'm liking it I had a pretty fun time
playing<00:04:27.169> it<00:04:27.620> earlier<00:04:27.949> today<00:04:28.099> um<00:04:28.960> I<00:04:29.960> also

00:04:30.459 --> 00:04:30.469 
playing it earlier today um I also

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:32.260 
playing it earlier today um I also
noticed<00:04:30.830> that<00:04:30.860> the<00:04:30.949> crowd<00:04:31.370> doesn't<00:04:31.759> say<00:04:32.060> the

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
noticed that the crowd doesn't say the

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.020 
noticed that the crowd doesn't say the
same<00:04:32.780> thing<00:04:33.020> over<00:04:33.169> and<00:04:33.319> over<00:04:33.530> well<00:04:34.400> I<00:04:34.430> guess<00:04:34.879> I

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
same thing over and over well I guess I

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:36.730 
same thing over and over well I guess I
really<00:04:35.240> haven't<00:04:35.389> noticed<00:04:35.750> that<00:04:35.810> yet<00:04:35.900> but<00:04:36.259> I'm

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740 
really haven't noticed that yet but I'm

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:38.469 
really haven't noticed that yet but I'm
pretty<00:04:36.919> sure<00:04:37.009> the<00:04:37.189> crowd<00:04:37.400> isn't<00:04:38.030> less

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:38.479 
pretty sure the crowd isn't less

00:04:38.479 --> 00:04:40.270 
pretty sure the crowd isn't less
repetitive<00:04:38.810> than<00:04:39.259> it<00:04:39.379> was<00:04:39.500> last<00:04:39.530> year<00:04:39.949> so

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 
repetitive than it was last year so

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.159 
repetitive than it was last year so
that's<00:04:40.580> a<00:04:40.669> good<00:04:40.819> thing<00:04:40.879> to<00:04:41.120> see<00:04:41.900> that<00:04:42.050> they

00:04:42.159 --> 00:04:42.169 
that's a good thing to see that they

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:46.959 
that's a good thing to see that they
somewhat<00:04:42.590> improved<00:04:42.919> on<00:04:45.310> also<00:04:46.310> they<00:04:46.610> improved

00:04:46.959 --> 00:04:46.969 
somewhat improved on also they improved

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:50.770 
somewhat improved on also they improved
on<00:04:47.150> some<00:04:47.449> organ<00:04:47.930> music<00:04:48.250> some<00:04:49.250> of<00:04:49.340> the<00:04:49.460> I<00:04:49.819> don't

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780 
on some organ music some of the I don't

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:52.510 
on some organ music some of the I don't
know<00:04:50.960> I<00:04:51.199> guess<00:04:51.409> music<00:04:51.830> you<00:04:51.919> hear<00:04:52.250> from<00:04:52.370> the

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 
know I guess music you hear from the

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.390 
know I guess music you hear from the
organ<00:04:52.819> after<00:04:53.379> batters<00:04:54.379> out<00:04:54.560> or<00:04:54.860> a<00:04:54.889> hit<00:04:55.280> or

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:55.400 
organ after batters out or a hit or

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.730 
organ after batters out or a hit or
something<00:04:55.639> like<00:04:55.729> that<00:04:55.789> is<00:04:56.210> a<00:04:56.690> kind<00:04:57.409> of<00:04:57.500> music

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:57.740 
something like that is a kind of music

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:59.290 
something like that is a kind of music
you<00:04:57.770> would<00:04:57.919> hear<00:04:58.129> if<00:04:58.280> you<00:04:58.430> go<00:04:58.520> to<00:04:58.580> a<00:04:58.669> ballpark

00:04:59.290 --> 00:04:59.300 
you would hear if you go to a ballpark

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.659 
you would hear if you go to a ballpark
and<00:04:59.719> watch<00:04:59.840> a<00:04:59.960> game<00:05:00.110> so<00:05:01.039> that's<00:05:01.250> a<00:05:01.340> little<00:05:01.520> bit

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:01.669 
and watch a game so that's a little bit

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:03.969 
and watch a game so that's a little bit
better<00:05:01.909> and<00:05:02.840> it's<00:05:03.050> they<00:05:03.650> have<00:05:03.740> a<00:05:03.800> better

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:03.979 
better and it's they have a better

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:07.330 
better and it's they have a better
variety<00:05:04.400> this<00:05:04.819> year<00:05:05.949> I've<00:05:06.949> heard<00:05:07.099> a<00:05:07.190> couple

just<00:05:27.500> a<00:05:27.770> nice<00:05:28.009> little<00:05:28.250> catch<00:05:28.580> barely<00:05:29.120> gets<00:05:29.330> to

00:05:29.499 --> 00:05:29.509 
just a nice little catch barely gets to

00:05:29.509 --> 00:05:32.290 
just a nice little catch barely gets to
that<00:05:29.659> one<00:05:30.340> they're<00:05:31.340> actually<00:05:31.699> showing<00:05:32.120> the

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:32.300 
that one they're actually showing the

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:33.730 
that one they're actually showing the
old<00:05:32.449> champion<00:05:32.990> sing<00:05:33.259> there<00:05:33.440> from<00:05:33.650> the

old champion sing there from the
Cardinals<00:05:34.159> and<00:05:34.310> 06<00:05:34.699> i'm<00:05:34.849> not<00:05:35.000> sure<00:05:35.150> if<00:05:35.210> they

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:35.330 
Cardinals and 06 i'm not sure if they

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:37.390 
Cardinals and 06 i'm not sure if they
had<00:05:35.449> that<00:05:35.659> in<00:05:36.020> 2k11<00:05:36.379> i<00:05:36.710> never<00:05:36.919> really<00:05:37.219> played

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:37.400 
had that in 2k11 i never really played

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:41.619 
had that in 2k11 i never really played
in<00:05:37.550> st.<00:05:37.759> Louis<00:05:38.060> so<00:05:38.979> I<00:05:40.060> found<00:05:41.060> it<00:05:41.240> I<00:05:41.419> actually

00:05:41.619 --> 00:05:41.629 
in st. Louis so I found it I actually

00:05:41.629 --> 00:05:43.180 
in st. Louis so I found it I actually
found<00:05:41.900> it<00:05:42.080> a<00:05:42.110> lot<00:05:42.289> easier<00:05:42.319> hitting<00:05:42.979> in<00:05:43.099> this

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:43.190

00:06:51.659 --> 00:06:54.949 
know if that's a glitch or anything like
that<00:06:51.779> but<00:06:52.050> I'm<00:06:52.169> sure<00:06:52.199> they<00:06:52.499> will<00:06:52.589> fix<00:06:52.860> that<00:06:53.959> but

00:06:54.949 --> 00:06:54.959 
that but I'm sure they will fix that but

00:06:54.959 --> 00:06:56.779 
that but I'm sure they will fix that but
yeah<00:06:55.199> as<00:06:55.529> you<00:06:55.679> can<00:06:55.739> see<00:06:55.919> there<00:06:56.099> I<00:06:56.129> just<00:06:56.219> found

00:06:56.779 --> 00:06:56.789 
yeah as you can see there I just found

00:06:56.789 --> 00:06:58.519 
yeah as you can see there I just found
it<00:06:56.939> a<00:06:57.029> lot<00:06:57.300> easier<00:06:57.330> to<00:06:57.689> lay<00:06:57.929> off<00:06:58.079> those<00:06:58.229> kind<00:06:58.499> of

00:06:58.519 --> 00:06:58.529 
it a lot easier to lay off those kind of

00:06:58.529 --> 00:07:00.290 
it a lot easier to lay off those kind of
pitches<00:06:58.860> in<00:06:58.979> this<00:06:59.099> game<00:06:59.189> and<00:06:59.489> I<00:06:59.550> did<00:06:59.729> last

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:00.300 
pitches in this game and I did last

00:07:00.300 --> 00:07:03.259 
pitches in this game and I did last
year's<00:07:00.629> game<00:07:00.979> but<00:07:01.979> as<00:07:02.279> you<00:07:02.429> see<00:07:02.639> a<00:07:02.819> nice<00:07:03.089> little

00:07:03.259 --> 00:07:03.269 
year's game but as you see a nice little

00:07:03.269 --> 00:07:05.239 
year's game but as you see a nice little
double<00:07:03.809> extra<00:07:04.319> bases<00:07:04.529> and<00:07:04.889> that's<00:07:05.009> going<00:07:05.189> to

00:07:05.239 --> 00:07:05.249 
double extra bases and that's going to

00:07:05.249 --> 00:07:07.850 
double extra bases and that's going to
actually<00:07:05.339> win<00:07:05.789> the<00:07:05.939> game<00:07:06.149> for<00:07:06.179> me<00:07:06.539> and<00:07:06.860> no

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:07.860

glitch<00:07:08.159> this<00:07:08.429> time<00:07:08.669> as<00:07:08.879> I'm<00:07:09.029> actually<00:07:09.179> going

00:07:09.409 --> 00:07:09.419 
glitch this time as I'm actually going
