because this battlefield game that came

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:51.779 
because this battlefield game that came
out<00:01:50.500> is<00:01:50.619> much<00:01:50.770> better<00:01:50.979> than<00:01:51.130> ghosts<00:01:51.520> in<00:01:51.670> my

00:01:51.779 --> 00:01:51.789

decided<00:02:02.189> to<00:02:03.189> use<00:02:03.429> my<00:02:03.460> xbox<00:02:03.880> controller<00:02:04.210> and

00:02:04.349 --> 00:02:04.359 
decided to use my xbox controller and

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:05.669 
decided to use my xbox controller and
see<00:02:04.479> how<00:02:04.600> well<00:02:04.780> I<00:02:04.810> fight<00:02:05.079> against<00:02:05.380> everybody

00:02:05.669 --> 00:02:05.679 
see how well I fight against everybody

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:08.999 
see how well I fight against everybody
else<00:02:06.299> so<00:02:07.299> it's<00:02:07.990> connected<00:02:08.380> up<00:02:08.470> it's<00:02:08.800> good

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
else so it's connected up it's good

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:10.650 
else so it's connected up it's good
because<00:02:09.160> when<00:02:09.729> you<00:02:09.820> connect<00:02:10.300> the<00:02:10.360> Explorer's

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
because when you connect the Explorer's

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.510 
because when you connect the Explorer's
controller<00:02:10.990> all<00:02:11.740> the<00:02:11.950> buttons<00:02:12.250> already

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
controller all the buttons already

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.270 
controller all the buttons already
mapped<00:02:12.730> as<00:02:13.060> to<00:02:13.330> what<00:02:13.480> they<00:02:13.600> would<00:02:13.720> be<00:02:13.780> on<00:02:14.080> as<00:02:14.470> if

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
mapped as to what they would be on as if

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.500 
mapped as to what they would be on as if
you<00:02:15.400> are<00:02:15.490> playing<00:02:15.700> on<00:02:15.880> a<00:02:16.710> console<00:02:18.510> however

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
you are playing on a console however

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.899 
you are playing on a console however
there<00:02:20.319> is<00:02:20.470> one<00:02:20.500> massive<00:02:21.010> difference<00:02:21.580> that

00:02:21.899 --> 00:02:21.909 
there is one massive difference that

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:24.680 
there is one massive difference that
would<00:02:22.150> put<00:02:22.450> you<00:02:22.540> a<00:02:22.590> big<00:02:23.590> disadvantage

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
would put you a big disadvantage

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.110 
would put you a big disadvantage
using<00:02:24.840> a<00:02:24.960> controller<00:02:25.440> on<00:02:25.650> PC<00:02:26.040> and<00:02:26.910> that<00:02:27.030> is

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
using a controller on PC and that is

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.360 
using a controller on PC and that is
that<00:02:27.270> if<00:02:27.390> you<00:02:27.600> if<00:02:28.140> you<00:02:28.290> have<00:02:28.470> played<00:02:28.710> on<00:02:29.340> a

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
that if you if you have played on a

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.670 
that if you if you have played on a
console<00:02:29.760> you'll<00:02:29.940> notice<00:02:30.240> when<00:02:30.390> you<00:02:30.560> when<00:02:31.560> you

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
console you'll notice when you when you

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.100 
console you'll notice when you when you
like<00:02:31.980> aim<00:02:32.700> towards<00:02:33.210> an<00:02:33.300> enemy<00:02:33.570> you<00:02:33.720> get<00:02:33.900> a<00:02:33.930> bit

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
like aim towards an enemy you get a bit

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.470 
like aim towards an enemy you get a bit
of<00:02:34.200> a<00:02:34.380> bit<00:02:34.620> of<00:02:34.710> stick<00:02:35.100> towards<00:02:35.580> them<00:02:35.700> not<00:02:36.090> full

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
of a bit of stick towards them not full

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:39.020 
of a bit of stick towards them not full
stick<00:02:36.780> but<00:02:37.080> you<00:02:37.230> get<00:02:37.470> a<00:02:37.500> little<00:02:37.650> bit<00:02:37.890> of<00:02:38.040> little

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
stick but you get a little bit of little

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:40.730 
stick but you get a little bit of little
bit<00:02:39.150> of<00:02:39.210> a<00:02:39.270> draw<00:02:39.540> towards<00:02:39.990> the<00:02:40.170> player<00:02:40.440> and

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
bit of a draw towards the player and

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.800 
bit of a draw towards the player and
that<00:02:41.550> will<00:02:41.670> help<00:02:41.850> your<00:02:42.060> aim<00:02:42.210> it's<00:02:42.480> called<00:02:42.660> aim

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
that will help your aim it's called aim

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.750 
that will help your aim it's called aim
assist<00:02:42.960> it's<00:02:43.770> what<00:02:43.890> it'll<00:02:44.040> do<00:02:44.190> is<00:02:44.340> it'll<00:02:44.490> lock

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
assist it's what it'll do is it'll lock

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.370 
assist it's what it'll do is it'll lock
on<00:02:44.940> to<00:02:45.060> them<00:02:45.180> a<00:02:45.240> little<00:02:45.390> bit<00:02:45.510> so<00:02:46.020> it<00:02:46.170> gives<00:02:46.320> you

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
on to them a little bit so it gives you

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.140 
on to them a little bit so it gives you
a<00:02:46.410> bit<00:02:46.620> better<00:02:46.770> accuracy<00:02:47.130> because<00:02:47.820> it<00:02:47.940> allows

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
a bit better accuracy because it allows

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.880 
a bit better accuracy because it allows
you<00:02:48.240> to<00:02:48.330> compensate<00:02:48.570> better<00:02:48.930> using<00:02:49.830> a

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
you to compensate better using a

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.950 
you to compensate better using a
controller<00:02:50.220> it's<00:02:50.370> hard<00:02:50.610> to<00:02:50.790> manage<00:02:51.420> recoil

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:51.960 
controller it's hard to manage recoil

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:54.830 
controller it's hard to manage recoil
and<00:02:52.230> stuff<00:02:52.440> and<00:02:52.620> track<00:02:52.890> targets<00:02:53.360> but<00:02:54.360> on<00:02:54.510> with

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
and stuff and track targets but on with

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.240 
and stuff and track targets but on with
the<00:02:54.900> mouse<00:02:55.080> it's<00:02:55.350> easy<00:02:55.530> to<00:02:55.740> do<00:02:55.860> that<00:02:55.890> so

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
the mouse it's easy to do that so

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.420 
the mouse it's easy to do that so
there's<00:02:56.430> no<00:02:56.520> aim<00:02:56.640> assist<00:02:56.790> on<00:02:57.060> PC<00:02:57.620> which<00:02:58.620> in<00:02:59.280> my

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
there's no aim assist on PC which in my

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.790 
there's no aim assist on PC which in my
opinion<00:02:59.520> is<00:02:59.850> a<00:02:59.910> bit<00:03:00.120> I<00:03:00.360> don't<00:03:01.080> see<00:03:01.530> why<00:03:01.740> you

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
opinion is a bit I don't see why you

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.080 
opinion is a bit I don't see why you
don't<00:03:02.100> allow<00:03:02.810> my<00:03:03.810> dice<00:03:04.050> don't<00:03:04.350> allow<00:03:04.730> PC<00:03:05.730> games

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
don't allow my dice don't allow PC games

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.080 
don't allow my dice don't allow PC games
as<00:03:07.050> a<00:03:07.110> random<00:03:07.500> rag<00:03:07.950> flying<00:03:08.280> across<00:03:08.430> the<00:03:08.550> I

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
as a random rag flying across the I

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.490 
as a random rag flying across the I
don't<00:03:09.600> see<00:03:09.720> why<00:03:09.840> dice<00:03:10.020> don't<00:03:10.260> allow

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:10.500 
don't see why dice don't allow

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.260 
don't see why dice don't allow
battlefield<00:03:11.070> people<00:03:11.700> playing<00:03:12.060> with

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
battlefield people playing with

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.810 
battlefield people playing with
controller<00:03:13.080> to<00:03:13.290> have<00:03:13.410> an<00:03:13.530> assist<00:03:13.890> cuz<00:03:14.220> my

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
controller to have an assist cuz my

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.000 
controller to have an assist cuz my
opinion<00:03:15.150> it<00:03:15.960> would<00:03:16.110> make<00:03:16.260> it<00:03:16.440> a<00:03:16.500> bit<00:03:16.710> more<00:03:16.890> of<00:03:16.950> a

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
opinion it would make it a bit more of a

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.430 
opinion it would make it a bit more of a
viable<00:03:17.280> option<00:03:17.640> because<00:03:18.270> I<00:03:18.480> mean<00:03:18.840> I<00:03:19.080> did<00:03:19.320> do

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
viable option because I mean I did do

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.870 
viable option because I mean I did do
pretty<00:03:19.590> well<00:03:19.740> during<00:03:20.070> this<00:03:20.220> gameplay<00:03:20.460> this<00:03:20.760> is

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
pretty well during this gameplay this is

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.910 
pretty well during this gameplay this is
like<00:03:21.000> my<00:03:21.120> first<00:03:21.330> game<00:03:21.660> using<00:03:22.290> it<00:03:22.440> in<00:03:22.680> the

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
like my first game using it in the

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.400 
like my first game using it in the
second<00:03:23.280> game<00:03:23.400> and<00:03:23.660> I<00:03:24.660> they<00:03:24.810> pretty<00:03:25.020> well<00:03:25.110> using

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
second game and I they pretty well using

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.860 
second game and I they pretty well using
a<00:03:25.620> controller<00:03:26.460> but<00:03:26.550> I<00:03:26.880> noticed<00:03:27.330> that<00:03:27.420> at<00:03:27.600> some

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
a controller but I noticed that at some

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.080 
a controller but I noticed that at some
points<00:03:28.200> at<00:03:28.320> long<00:03:28.530> ranges<00:03:28.950> I<00:03:29.190> was<00:03:29.730> getting<00:03:29.970> out

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
points at long ranges I was getting out

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.060 
points at long ranges I was getting out
beaten<00:03:30.510> because<00:03:30.900> the<00:03:31.530> enemies<00:03:31.800> would<00:03:31.920> just

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:32.070 
beaten because the enemies would just

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:33.410 
beaten because the enemies would just
mowed<00:03:32.220> me<00:03:32.340> down<00:03:32.370> before<00:03:32.700> I<00:03:32.850> had<00:03:32.970> a<00:03:33.060> chance<00:03:33.270> to

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
mowed me down before I had a chance to

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.240 
mowed me down before I had a chance to
lock<00:03:33.780> onto<00:03:33.989> them<00:03:34.200> because<00:03:34.890> that's<00:03:35.010> the

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
lock onto them because that's the

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.300 
lock onto them because that's the
precision<00:03:36.060> you<00:03:36.090> get<00:03:36.330> using<00:03:36.570> a<00:03:36.630> mouse

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:37.310 
precision you get using a mouse

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:38.840 
precision you get using a mouse
obviously<00:03:38.310> you're<00:03:38.430> going<00:03:38.520> to<00:03:38.580> do<00:03:38.700> better

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
obviously you're going to do better

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.900 
obviously you're going to do better
against<00:03:39.270> lower<00:03:39.720> quality<00:03:40.170> players<00:03:40.790> because<00:03:41.790> if

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
against lower quality players because if

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.310 
against lower quality players because if
you<00:03:42.000> have<00:03:42.090> a<00:03:42.120> somebody<00:03:42.690> who's<00:03:42.870> not<00:03:42.989> quite<00:03:43.170> as

about<00:04:01.530> 20<00:04:02.040> 30<00:04:02.070> pound<00:04:02.519> 25<00:04:03.150> 30<00:04:03.330> pound<00:04:03.540> it's<00:04:04.410> the

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
about 20 30 pound 25 30 pound it's the

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.890 
about 20 30 pound 25 30 pound it's the
Xbox<00:04:04.830> elite<00:04:05.040> controller<00:04:05.459> and<00:04:05.700> then<00:04:06.630> I<00:04:06.720> had<00:04:06.840> to

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
Xbox elite controller and then I had to

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.420 
Xbox elite controller and then I had to
buy<00:04:06.989> a<00:04:07.019> little<00:04:07.200> adapter<00:04:07.470> thing<00:04:07.860> to<00:04:08.010> go<00:04:08.130> with<00:04:08.280> it

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
buy a little adapter thing to go with it

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.460 
buy a little adapter thing to go with it
so<00:04:08.720> because<00:04:09.720> it's<00:04:09.840> a<00:04:09.900> wireless<00:04:10.080> controller

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
so because it's a wireless controller

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:11.570 
so because it's a wireless controller
you<00:04:10.590> could<00:04:10.739> get<00:04:10.860> a<00:04:10.890> wired<00:04:11.100> controller<00:04:11.280> via

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:11.580 
you could get a wired controller via

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.570 
you could get a wired controller via
Wireless<00:04:12.350> so<00:04:13.350> you<00:04:13.410> can<00:04:13.620> get<00:04:13.739> a<00:04:13.769> little<00:04:13.890> adapter

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:14.580 
Wireless so you can get a little adapter

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.460 
Wireless so you can get a little adapter
and<00:04:14.760> then<00:04:15.060> plug<00:04:15.120> that<00:04:15.570> into<00:04:15.750> your<00:04:15.930> PC<00:04:16.200> and<00:04:16.410> then

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
and then plug that into your PC and then

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.380 
and then plug that into your PC and then
it<00:04:17.010> will<00:04:17.100> link<00:04:17.310> the<00:04:17.459> controller<00:04:17.790> to<00:04:18.030> it<00:04:18.150> when

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:18.390 
it will link the controller to it when

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:20.570 
it will link the controller to it when
you<00:04:18.480> connect<00:04:18.750> it<00:04:18.930> allowing<00:04:19.830> you<00:04:20.040> once<00:04:20.459> you've

it up and so how did I fare against
others<00:04:43.130> I<00:04:43.370> found<00:04:44.270> I<00:04:44.600> was<00:04:44.870> at<00:04:45.440> a<00:04:45.500> bit<00:04:45.770> of<00:04:45.800> an

00:04:45.939 --> 00:04:45.949 
others I found I was at a bit of an

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:47.379 
others I found I was at a bit of an
advantage<00:04:46.220> in<00:04:46.580> close<00:04:46.820> range

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:47.389 
advantage in close range

00:04:47.389 --> 00:04:49.810 
advantage in close range
I<00:04:47.419> would<00:04:47.630> say<00:04:47.810> an<00:04:47.870> advantage<00:04:48.350> I<00:04:48.650> would<00:04:49.610> say<00:04:49.790> I

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:49.820 
I would say an advantage I would say I

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.150 
I would say an advantage I would say I
was<00:04:50.030> a<00:04:50.090> pretty<00:04:50.990> much<00:04:51.110> level<00:04:51.500> playing<00:04:51.740> field<00:04:52.010> in

was a pretty much level playing field in
close<00:04:52.340> quarters<00:04:52.729> engagements<00:04:54.040> so<00:04:55.040> one<00:04:55.160> thing

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.310 
close quarters engagements so one thing

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:56.439 
close quarters engagements so one thing
in<00:04:55.370> controller<00:04:55.669> does<00:04:55.910> give<00:04:56.060> us<00:04:56.240> great

00:04:56.439 --> 00:04:56.449 
in controller does give us great

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:37.160 
and mouse

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:40.990 
and mouse
I<00:05:37.190> would<00:05:38.180> do<00:05:38.270> much<00:05:38.450> better<00:05:38.750> than<00:05:39.490> if<00:05:40.490> I<00:05:40.669> didn't

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:41.000 
I would do much better than if I didn't

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.379 
I would do much better than if I didn't
for<00:05:41.120> example<00:05:41.510> and<00:05:42.250> I<00:05:43.250> think<00:05:43.280> that's<00:05:43.610> that's

00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:44.389 
for example and I think that's that's

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:46.779 
for example and I think that's that's
worth<00:05:44.570> noting<00:05:44.930> but<00:05:45.380> overall<00:05:46.160> I<00:05:46.370> found<00:05:46.580> it<00:05:46.760> a

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:46.789 
worth noting but overall I found it a

00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:50.710 
worth noting but overall I found it a
much<00:05:48.340> once<00:05:49.340> in<00:05:49.490> much<00:05:49.639> more<00:05:49.820> enjoyable<00:05:50.030> I<00:05:50.330> find

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:50.720 
much once in much more enjoyable I find

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:53.320 
much once in much more enjoyable I find
it<00:05:50.840> an<00:05:51.020> enjoyable<00:05:52.010> experience<00:05:52.430> to<00:05:53.180> use<00:05:53.300> a

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:53.330 
it an enjoyable experience to use a

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:55.120 
it an enjoyable experience to use a
controller<00:05:53.690> because<00:05:54.470> it<00:05:54.560> took<00:05:54.680> me<00:05:54.830> a<00:05:54.860> bit<00:05:54.889> back

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:55.130 
controller because it took me a bit back

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:57.850 
controller because it took me a bit back
to<00:05:55.250> my<00:05:55.340> roots<00:05:55.639> and<00:05:55.880> stuff<00:05:56.150> engine<00:05:56.450> I<00:05:56.630> also<00:05:57.500> find

00:05:57.850 --> 00:05:57.860 
to my roots and stuff engine I also find

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:58.930 
to my roots and stuff engine I also find
it<00:05:57.979> fun<00:05:58.130> using<00:05:58.340> the<00:05:58.400> controller<00:05:58.669> because<00:05:58.849> you

00:05:58.930 --> 00:05:58.940 
it fun using the controller because you

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:02.379 
it fun using the controller because you
can<00:05:59.120> sit<00:05:59.389> back<00:05:59.419> and<00:05:59.599> play<00:05:59.840> but<00:06:00.880> one<00:06:01.880> thing<00:06:02.090> I

00:06:02.379 --> 00:06:02.389 
can sit back and play but one thing I

00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:04.629 
can sit back and play but one thing I
would<00:06:02.750> like<00:06:02.900> to<00:06:03.050> know<00:06:03.200> is<00:06:03.650> join<00:06:04.010> this<00:06:04.190> you<00:06:04.520> will

00:06:04.629 --> 00:06:04.639 
would like to know is join this you will

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:07.060 
would like to know is join this you will
see<00:06:04.880> that<00:06:05.090> there<00:06:05.510> are<00:06:05.539> multiple<00:06:05.780> chip<00:06:06.260> places

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:07.070 
see that there are multiple chip places

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:10.750 
see that there are multiple chip places
where<00:06:07.280> by<00:06:07.430> I<00:06:08.139> get<00:06:09.139> kills<00:06:09.470> like<00:06:10.190> the<00:06:10.340> last<00:06:10.580> few

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:10.760 
where by I get kills like the last few

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:13.409 
where by I get kills like the last few
bullets<00:06:11.060> in<00:06:11.150> my<00:06:11.240> magazine<00:06:11.419> and<00:06:11.870> that<00:06:12.680> is

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:13.419 
bullets in my magazine and that is

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:16.600 
bullets in my magazine and that is
probably<00:06:14.419> due<00:06:14.750> to<00:06:14.780> poor<00:06:15.139> accuracy<00:06:15.710> the

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:16.610 
probably due to poor accuracy the

00:06:16.610 --> 00:06:19.570 
probably due to poor accuracy the
controller<00:06:17.030> gives<00:06:17.300> you<00:06:18.190> notice<00:06:19.190> I<00:06:19.280> found<00:06:19.460> out

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:19.580 
controller gives you notice I found out

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:20.860 
controller gives you notice I found out
there<00:06:19.700> that<00:06:19.910> I<00:06:19.940> couldn't<00:06:20.180> accept<00:06:20.479> it<00:06:20.630> back

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:20.870 
there that I couldn't accept it back

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:22.120 
there that I couldn't accept it back
with<00:06:21.050> my<00:06:21.169> controller<00:06:21.440> which<00:06:21.740> is<00:06:21.889> a<00:06:21.919> bit<00:06:22.099> weird

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:22.130 
with my controller which is a bit weird

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:24.339 
with my controller which is a bit weird
so<00:06:23.030> I<00:06:23.090> had<00:06:23.240> to<00:06:23.330> actually<00:06:23.479> press<00:06:23.870> space<00:06:24.110> on<00:06:24.289> the

00:06:24.339 --> 00:06:24.349 
so I had to actually press space on the

00:06:24.349 --> 00:06:26.290 
so I had to actually press space on the
keyboard<00:06:24.800> but<00:06:24.830> that's<00:06:25.789> why<00:06:25.880> it<00:06:25.940> took<00:06:26.030> a<00:06:26.150> while

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:26.300 
keyboard but that's why it took a while

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:31.839 
keyboard but that's why it took a while
to<00:06:26.330> kick<00:06:26.990> in<00:06:27.050> but<00:06:29.169> yeah<00:06:30.169> so<00:06:30.410> I<00:06:30.710> found<00:06:31.250> the<00:06:31.400> so

00:06:31.839 --> 00:06:31.849 
to kick in but yeah so I found the so

00:06:31.849 --> 00:06:33.969 
to kick in but yeah so I found the so
overall<00:06:32.150> to<00:06:32.300> summarize<00:06:32.710> advantages<00:06:33.710> of<00:06:33.740> using

00:06:33.969 --> 00:06:33.979 
overall to summarize advantages of using

00:06:33.979 --> 00:06:35.379 
overall to summarize advantages of using
the<00:06:34.190> keyboard<00:06:34.520> you<00:06:34.729> have<00:06:34.880> increased

00:06:35.379 --> 00:06:35.389 
the keyboard you have increased

00:06:35.389 --> 00:06:39.820 
the keyboard you have increased
precision<00:06:36.190> so<00:06:37.190> greater<00:06:38.060> accuracy<00:06:38.680> you<00:06:39.680> have

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:39.830 
precision so greater accuracy you have

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:42.940 
precision so greater accuracy you have
more<00:06:40.070> keys<00:06:40.310> to<00:06:40.550> map<00:06:40.729> thing<00:06:41.539> controls<00:06:41.990> to<00:06:42.229> so

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:42.950 
more keys to map thing controls to so

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:43.909 
more keys to map thing controls to so
therefore

00:06:43.909 --> 00:06:43.919 
therefore

00:06:43.919 --> 00:06:46.969 
therefore
technically<00:06:44.400> you<00:06:44.759> can<00:06:44.939> do<00:06:45.090> more<00:06:45.860> however<00:06:46.860> you

00:06:46.969 --> 00:06:46.979 
technically you can do more however you

00:06:46.979 --> 00:06:48.950 
technically you can do more however you
can<00:06:47.129> get<00:06:47.249> accessories<00:06:47.729> for<00:06:47.819> controllers<00:06:48.180> get

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:48.960 
can get accessories for controllers get

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:51.260 
can get accessories for controllers get
modded<00:06:49.229> controller<00:06:49.639> modded<00:06:50.639> but<00:06:50.819> customize

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:51.270 
modded controller modded but customize

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:52.909 
modded controller modded but customize
control<00:06:51.569> away<00:06:51.749> but<00:06:51.930> you<00:06:52.050> got<00:06:52.229> more<00:06:52.409> buttons<00:06:52.800> on

00:06:52.909 --> 00:06:52.919 
control away but you got more buttons on

00:06:52.919 --> 00:06:59.140 
control away but you got more buttons on
it<00:06:54.439> you<00:06:55.439> thought<00:06:55.650> something<00:06:55.860> you<00:06:56.069> want<00:06:56.249> and

00:06:59.140 --> 00:06:59.150 

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:01.279 

more<00:07:00.150> of<00:07:00.240> us<00:07:00.360> using<00:07:00.689> the<00:07:00.749> mouse<00:07:00.900> on<00:07:00.990> keyboard

00:07:01.279 --> 00:07:01.289 
more of us using the mouse on keyboard

00:07:01.289 --> 00:07:05.929 
more of us using the mouse on keyboard
you<00:07:03.139> it's<00:07:04.139> mainly<00:07:04.439> just<00:07:04.710> the<00:07:05.009> accuracy<00:07:05.789> to<00:07:05.909> be

00:07:05.929 --> 00:07:05.939 
you it's mainly just the accuracy to be

00:07:05.939 --> 00:07:08.510 
you it's mainly just the accuracy to be
honest<00:07:06.379> the<00:07:07.379> overall<00:07:07.650> accuracy<00:07:07.919> you<00:07:08.249> get<00:07:08.400> is

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:08.520 
honest the overall accuracy you get is

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:09.249 
honest the overall accuracy you get is
greater

00:07:09.249 --> 00:07:09.259

another<00:07:10.259> granted<00:07:10.740> so<00:07:11.219> then<00:07:11.400> on<00:07:11.550> to<00:07:11.699> the

00:07:11.719 --> 00:07:11.729 
another granted so then on to the

00:07:11.729 --> 00:07:14.749 
another granted so then on to the
controller<00:07:12.120> advantages<00:07:12.689> of<00:07:12.779> that<00:07:13.639> when<00:07:14.639> you

00:07:14.749 --> 00:07:14.759 
controller advantages of that when you

00:07:14.759 --> 00:07:17.659 
controller advantages of that when you
are<00:07:14.879> running<00:07:15.090> and<00:07:15.330> moving<00:07:15.689> you<00:07:15.870> do<00:07:16.080> have<00:07:16.669> you

00:07:17.659 --> 00:07:17.669 
are running and moving you do have you

00:07:17.669 --> 00:07:20.689 
are running and moving you do have you
can<00:07:18.080> change<00:07:19.080> how<00:07:19.469> much<00:07:19.740> you<00:07:19.979> move<00:07:20.159> so<00:07:20.460> you<00:07:20.550> can

00:07:20.689 --> 00:07:20.699 
can change how much you move so you can

00:07:20.699 --> 00:07:21.950 
can change how much you move so you can
move<00:07:20.789> at<00:07:20.939> different<00:07:21.029> speeds<00:07:21.270> you<00:07:21.599> could<00:07:21.750> turn

00:07:21.950 --> 00:07:21.960 
move at different speeds you could turn

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:24.950 
move at different speeds you could turn
at<00:07:22.110> different<00:07:22.379> speeds<00:07:22.650> and<00:07:23.539> you<00:07:24.539> just<00:07:24.689> have<00:07:24.870> to

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:24.960 
at different speeds and you just have to

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:27.709 
at different speeds and you just have to
hold<00:07:25.169> the<00:07:25.379> thing<00:07:25.590> the<00:07:25.949> thumb<00:07:26.159> stick<00:07:26.370> them<00:07:27.090> to

00:07:27.709 --> 00:07:27.719 
hold the thing the thumb stick them to

00:07:27.719 --> 00:07:29.719 
hold the thing the thumb stick them to
the<00:07:27.750> to<00:07:28.590> the<00:07:28.710> side<00:07:28.889> to<00:07:29.069> turn<00:07:29.250> rather<00:07:29.610> than

00:07:29.719 --> 00:07:29.729 
the to the side to turn rather than

00:07:29.729 --> 00:07:32.300 
the to the side to turn rather than
using<00:07:29.939> rice<00:07:30.150> you<00:07:30.270> got<00:07:30.389> to<00:07:30.449> move<00:07:30.599> it<00:07:30.719> around<00:07:31.310> so

00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:32.310 
using rice you got to move it around so

00:07:32.310 --> 00:07:33.950 
using rice you got to move it around so
yeah<00:07:32.490> that's<00:07:32.699> but<00:07:33.300> Emily<00:07:33.599> if<00:07:33.659> you<00:07:33.719> need<00:07:33.870> to

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:33.960 
yeah that's but Emily if you need to

00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:36.499 
yeah that's but Emily if you need to
summarize<00:07:34.319> I<00:07:34.439> think<00:07:34.710> that<00:07:34.860> if<00:07:35.150> you<00:07:36.150> wanted<00:07:36.449> to

00:07:36.499 --> 00:07:36.509 
summarize I think that if you wanted to

00:07:36.509 --> 00:07:38.570 
summarize I think that if you wanted to
use<00:07:36.629> a<00:07:36.659> controller<00:07:37.050> and<00:07:37.379> you're<00:07:37.830> good<00:07:38.400> with
