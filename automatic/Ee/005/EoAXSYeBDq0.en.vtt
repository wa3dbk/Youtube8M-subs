too<00:02:11.680> hard<00:02:11.830> just<00:02:12.340> to<00:02:12.550> get<00:02:12.670> a<00:02:12.700> little<00:02:12.880> pressure

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
too hard just to get a little pressure

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:25.820 
too hard just to get a little pressure
on<00:02:13.269> it<00:02:15.810> see<00:02:16.810> the<00:02:16.930> clips<00:02:17.170> kind<00:02:17.470> of<00:02:17.530> coming<00:02:17.800> out

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:30.600 

more<00:02:26.830> in<00:02:26.980> the<00:02:27.040> back<00:02:28.019> all<00:02:29.019> right<00:02:29.080> no<00:02:29.680> part<00:02:30.370> of

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
more in the back all right no part of

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.539 
more in the back all right no part of
this<00:02:31.299> is<00:02:31.510> loose<00:02:31.799> so<00:02:32.799> what<00:02:32.890> I'm<00:02:32.980> gonna<00:02:33.069> do<00:02:33.280> is

00:02:33.539 --> 00:02:33.549 
this is loose so what I'm gonna do is

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:36.000 
this is loose so what I'm gonna do is
you<00:02:33.880> can<00:02:34.060> slide<00:02:34.870> it<00:02:35.049> back<00:02:35.349> and<00:02:35.380> forth

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
you can slide it back and forth

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.240 
you can slide it back and forth
if<00:02:36.069> the<00:02:36.250> bottoms<00:02:36.580> don't<00:02:36.790> want<00:02:36.970> to<00:02:37.030> come<00:02:37.150> out

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
if the bottoms don't want to come out

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.650 
if the bottoms don't want to come out
just<00:02:39.250> kind<00:02:39.400> of<00:02:39.519> loose<00:02:39.670> them<00:02:39.849> up<00:02:40.000> and<00:02:40.209> then<00:02:40.390> push

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:40.660 
just kind of loose them up and then push

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:43.259 
just kind of loose them up and then push
straight<00:02:40.959> down<00:02:41.580> then<00:02:42.580> your<00:02:42.730> trim<00:02:42.940> piece<00:02:43.120> will

00:02:43.259 --> 00:02:43.269 
straight down then your trim piece will

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:46.770 
straight down then your trim piece will
come<00:02:43.420> off<00:02:43.569> show<00:02:44.530> y'all<00:02:44.739> these<00:02:44.980> clips<00:02:45.250> work<00:02:45.780> and

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:46.780 
come off show y'all these clips work and

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.099 
come off show y'all these clips work and
why<00:02:47.440> why<00:02:47.920> it<00:02:47.980> comes<00:02:48.310> off<00:02:48.489> that<00:02:48.760> way<00:02:48.989> at<00:02:49.989> the

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:50.109 
why why it comes off that way at the

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:53.039 
why why it comes off that way at the
bottom<00:02:50.440> of<00:02:50.709> these<00:02:50.890> clips<00:02:51.900> going<00:02:52.900> to<00:02:52.959> this

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:53.049 
bottom of these clips going to this

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:56.430 
bottom of these clips going to this
bottom<00:02:53.410> channel<00:02:53.769> in<00:02:53.950> the<00:02:55.170> they<00:02:56.170> allow<00:02:56.410> a

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:56.440 
bottom channel in the they allow a

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.199 
bottom channel in the they allow a
little<00:02:56.709> give<00:02:56.890> to<00:02:57.040> push<00:02:57.250> up<00:02:57.519> and<00:02:57.940> then<00:02:58.030> we'll

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
little give to push up and then we'll

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:00.300 
little give to push up and then we'll
pop<00:02:58.359> it<00:02:58.420> off<00:02:58.690> the<00:02:58.870> top<00:02:59.079> and<00:02:59.829> then<00:03:00.040> once<00:03:00.190> you've

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
pop it off the top and then once you've

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.849 
pop it off the top and then once you've
got<00:03:00.459> that<00:03:00.640> push<00:03:01.180> you're<00:03:01.329> straight<00:03:01.569> down<00:03:01.859> now

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:02.859 
got that push you're straight down now

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:04.770 
got that push you're straight down now
if<00:03:02.950> you're<00:03:03.069> at<00:03:03.190> the<00:03:03.310> junkyard<00:03:03.730> and<00:03:04.000> you're

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
if you're at the junkyard and you're

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.479 
if you're at the junkyard and you're
taking<00:03:05.079> this<00:03:05.170> piece<00:03:05.410> off<00:03:05.680> I<00:03:05.950> would<00:03:06.250> take<00:03:06.370> these

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
taking this piece off I would take these

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:08.520 
taking this piece off I would take these
clips<00:03:06.760> off<00:03:06.970> too<00:03:07.180> because<00:03:07.359> odds<00:03:07.959> are<00:03:08.200> you<00:03:08.380> might

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
clips off too because odds are you might

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.710 
clips off too because odds are you might
break<00:03:08.769> them<00:03:08.950> like<00:03:09.459> this<00:03:09.640> one<00:03:09.819> broke<00:03:10.450> a<00:03:10.480> little

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:10.720 
break them like this one broke a little

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.509 
break them like this one broke a little
ear<00:03:10.900> off<00:03:11.079> along<00:03:11.650> the<00:03:11.709> time<00:03:11.950> so<00:03:12.100> I<00:03:12.130> took<00:03:12.190> it<00:03:12.340> off

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
ear off along the time so I took it off

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:16.590 
ear off along the time so I took it off
so<00:03:13.420> all<00:03:13.480> you<00:03:13.569> got<00:03:13.690> to<00:03:13.750> do<00:03:15.120> push<00:03:16.120> him<00:03:16.269> that<00:03:16.420> way

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:16.600 
so all you got to do push him that way

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.110 
so all you got to do push him that way
and<00:03:16.859> then<00:03:17.859> go<00:03:17.980> straight<00:03:18.280> up<00:03:18.430> and<00:03:18.670> you<00:03:18.760> come<00:03:18.910> off

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
and then go straight up and you come off

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.930 
and then go straight up and you come off
pretty<00:03:19.780> simple<00:03:20.290> and<00:03:21.190> I'll<00:03:21.549> show<00:03:21.730> you<00:03:21.819> how<00:03:21.910> to

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
pretty simple and I'll show you how to

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.930 
pretty simple and I'll show you how to
put<00:03:22.150> it<00:03:22.239> on<00:03:22.299> just<00:03:22.569> in<00:03:22.840> case<00:03:22.900> you're<00:03:23.170> curious<00:03:23.200> or

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
put it on just in case you're curious or

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.940 
put it on just in case you're curious or
how<00:03:24.940> I<00:03:24.970> do<00:03:25.150> it<00:03:25.389> anyway<00:03:25.720> I<00:03:25.870> don't<00:03:26.650> know<00:03:26.739> if<00:03:26.799> this

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
how I do it anyway I don't know if this

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:28.110 
how I do it anyway I don't know if this
is<00:03:27.069> the<00:03:27.160> right<00:03:27.280> way<00:03:27.459> this<00:03:27.609> is<00:03:27.760> just<00:03:27.850> the<00:03:28.000> way

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:28.120 
is the right way this is just the way

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.759 
is the right way this is just the way
that<00:03:28.269> works<00:03:28.420> for<00:03:28.600> me<00:03:28.720> I<00:03:29.400> take<00:03:30.400> it<00:03:31.350> and<00:03:32.350> I<00:03:32.470> get<00:03:32.650> it

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 
that works for me I take it and I get it

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:35.460 
that works for me I take it and I get it
almost<00:03:32.980> flat<00:03:33.579> on<00:03:33.760> here<00:03:34.090> so<00:03:34.450> that<00:03:34.480> these<00:03:35.109> clips

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
almost flat on here so that these clips

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.910 
almost flat on here so that these clips
engage<00:03:36.069> into<00:03:36.310> this<00:03:36.430> channel<00:03:36.700> just<00:03:37.650> like<00:03:38.650> this

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
engage into this channel just like this

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:41.360 
engage into this channel just like this
I<00:03:39.310> push<00:03:40.299> you<00:03:40.420> up

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
I push you up

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.320 
I push you up
once<00:03:42.330> I've<00:03:42.480> got<00:03:42.510> it<00:03:42.750> up<00:03:43.790> you<00:03:44.790> just<00:03:44.970> paying<00:03:45.209> her

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
once I've got it up you just paying her

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:48.770 
once I've got it up you just paying her
in<00:03:45.620> you're<00:03:46.620> not<00:03:46.739> completely<00:03:47.160> centered<00:03:47.780> just

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
in you're not completely centered just

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:50.390 
in you're not completely centered just
slide<00:03:48.989> it<00:03:49.140> over<00:03:49.230> where<00:03:49.530> if<00:03:49.620> you<00:03:49.709> need<00:03:49.860> it<00:03:50.010> put

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
slide it over where if you need it put

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.000 
slide it over where if you need it put
that<00:03:50.580> screw<00:03:50.819> back<00:03:51.330> in<00:03:51.560> make<00:03:52.560> sure<00:03:52.590> all<00:03:52.830> your

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
that screw back in make sure all your

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.910 
that screw back in make sure all your
clips<00:03:53.280> are<00:03:53.430> engaged<00:03:54.170> and<00:03:55.170> you're<00:03:55.290> good<00:03:55.440> to<00:03:55.560> go

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
clips are engaged and you're good to go

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.229 
clips are engaged and you're good to go
I<00:03:55.950> mean<00:03:56.250> it's<00:03:56.400> pretty<00:03:56.520> simple<00:03:56.670> once<00:03:57.120> you've

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
I mean it's pretty simple once you've

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:59.270 
I mean it's pretty simple once you've
done<00:03:57.390> it<00:03:57.450> a<00:03:57.569> few<00:03:57.630> times<00:03:57.959> but<00:03:58.530> if<00:03:59.010> you<00:03:59.099> don't

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
done it a few times but if you don't

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:00.170 
done it a few times but if you don't
know<00:03:59.340> how<00:03:59.459> you<00:03:59.519> do<00:03:59.730> it<00:03:59.760> and<00:04:00.030> you're<00:04:00.120> just

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
know how you do it and you're just

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.970 
know how you do it and you're just
prying<00:04:00.630> that<00:04:00.750> stuff<00:04:01.050> you're<00:04:01.560> gonna<00:04:01.620> break<00:04:01.920> the

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
prying that stuff you're gonna break the

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.500 
prying that stuff you're gonna break the
clips<00:04:02.340> that's<00:04:02.700> what<00:04:02.819> I<00:04:02.880> did<00:04:03.060> on<00:04:03.090> the<00:04:03.269> front

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
clips that's what I did on the front

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:05.540 
clips that's what I did on the front
door<00:04:03.660> here<00:04:04.069> before<00:04:05.069> I<00:04:05.099> knew<00:04:05.250> how<00:04:05.370> it<00:04:05.400> was

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:05.550 
door here before I knew how it was

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:09.530 
door here before I knew how it was
together<00:04:05.849> so<00:04:06.170> that's<00:04:07.170> how<00:04:07.290> it's<00:04:07.470> done
