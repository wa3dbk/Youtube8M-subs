00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:32.570 
like putting it up in the top corner now

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:33.910 
like putting it up in the top corner now
it<00:02:32.630> will<00:02:32.870> show<00:02:33.110> up<00:02:33.230> in<00:02:33.320> your<00:02:33.380> video<00:02:33.709> there's

it will show up in your video there's

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.229 
it will show up in your video there's
really<00:02:34.040> nothing<00:02:34.459> you<00:02:34.489> could<00:02:34.700> do<00:02:34.820> about<00:02:34.850> it<00:02:35.150> but

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
really nothing you could do about it but

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:37.000 
really nothing you could do about it but
the<00:02:35.390> good<00:02:35.540> thing<00:02:35.750> is<00:02:35.870> the<00:02:36.020> opacity<00:02:36.380> of<00:02:36.680> it<00:02:36.860> is

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010 
the good thing is the opacity of it is

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.130 
the good thing is the opacity of it is
very<00:02:37.580> low<00:02:37.850> so<00:02:38.030> you<00:02:38.120> really<00:02:38.390> can't<00:02:38.630> notice<00:02:38.959> it

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
very low so you really can't notice it

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.720 
very low so you really can't notice it
that<00:02:39.170> much<00:02:39.560> especially<00:02:39.739> if<00:02:40.220> it's<00:02:40.370> in<00:02:40.489> the<00:02:40.550> top

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
that much especially if it's in the top

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.790 
that much especially if it's in the top
corner<00:02:41.209> that's<00:02:41.959> where<00:02:42.170> I<00:02:42.230> usually<00:02:42.620> like

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
corner that's where I usually like

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.670 
corner that's where I usually like
putting<00:02:43.190> it<00:02:43.310> so<00:02:44.270> after<00:02:44.630> that<00:02:44.780> is<00:02:45.050> done<00:02:45.080> you<00:02:45.560> can

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.680 
putting it so after that is done you can

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.530 
putting it so after that is done you can
go<00:02:45.770> ahead<00:02:45.800> and<00:02:46.010> back<00:02:46.370> out<00:02:46.910> of<00:02:46.970> that

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:47.540 
go ahead and back out of that

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.910 
go ahead and back out of that
