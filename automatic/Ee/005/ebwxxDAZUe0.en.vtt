00:00:01.649 --> 00:00:04.870
 People who use blends for pet notebooks 

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:07.210
 It is a story but 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:10.009
 It is bto PC It is paint 

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:13.499
 I think that there are a lot of three parties, usually the brand remains the ten key 

00:00:13.499 --> 00:00:15.859
 Seven Anjo Men's 

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:20.249
 It is a side that disappears 3 people side-this is like a camera with 0 

00:00:20.249 --> 00:00:23.710
 You can use the numeric keypad to change the screen and use it 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:26.619
 If this system is used, there is no numeric keypad. 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:30.670
 Set this with the number keys above ordinary alphabets 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:33.870
 Actually, the fate of that alphabet line is 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.900
 Egg sight is switched and that's that number 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.670
 I can not switch ge 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:42.760
 Well then 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.510
 I wonder if you can not operate without the numeric keypad 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.520
 It is good to be eco-friendly because there is a plan but pet 

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.580
 At 1213.137 above the line 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.500
 You can switch between shrimps 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.500
 Well, where can we do it? 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:00:59.990
 It is a file menu 

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:03.440
 There are places that repeat miscarriage 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.920
 There are various things when you look at such a woman Konno but Moe 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.040
 It's about input 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.830
 Where input is 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.830
 8 flavors on the left 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.570
 The m-root name is also not part 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.700
 I'm Koko that South Pad for decoration 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.900
 It means that it is 29 

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.800
 Said 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.800
 Well below Toms the good luck default to default 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.570
 Then you 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:37.400
 If you do so, it will be normal to eco-reima rather than that numeric keypad 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.230
 That number key is better Go with the number key Now 27 emotions 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:46.320
 It is a face then 1 front view Mr. right foot 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.320
 I switched to a zero camera 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.490
 I do not have cats 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:57.970
 Also that man without a numeric keypad also looks economythat science ence 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.610
 To where 

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.200
 Speaking of the function called Nam Pad coordination 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.530
 If there is no weather then there is no switching of that beauty 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.689
 Come in 

00:02:10.689 --> 00:02:12.839
 It was talked about putting a laptop
