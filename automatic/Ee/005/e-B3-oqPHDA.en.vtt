there you go all right so being these

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:32.440 
there you go all right so being these
really<00:01:31.220> thin<00:01:31.460> strings<00:01:31.820> I'm<00:01:32.060> not<00:01:32.180> used<00:01:32.360> to

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
really thin strings I'm not used to

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:33.880 
really thin strings I'm not used to
really<00:01:32.630> thin<00:01:32.810> strings<00:01:33.200> so<00:01:33.409> I<00:01:33.500> was<00:01:33.680> kind<00:01:33.860> of

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:33.890 
really thin strings so I was kind of

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.560 
really thin strings so I was kind of
skeptical<00:01:34.250> going<00:01:34.640> into<00:01:34.820> this<00:01:34.970> going<00:01:35.390> into

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:35.570 
skeptical going into this going into

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.480 
skeptical going into this going into
drop<00:01:35.810> B<00:01:35.990> or<00:01:36.140> drop<00:01:36.350> C<00:01:36.590> those<00:01:36.770> low<00:01:37.010> ones<00:01:37.250> I

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
drop B or drop C those low ones I

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.550 
drop B or drop C those low ones I
thought<00:01:37.790> the<00:01:38.030> strings<00:01:38.300> would<00:01:38.479> be<00:01:38.630> like<00:01:39.170> floppy

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
thought the strings would be like floppy

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:41.200 
thought the strings would be like floppy
and<00:01:40.040> like<00:01:40.250> they<00:01:40.400> would<00:01:40.490> sound<00:01:40.729> buzzy

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
and like they would sound buzzy

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:42.880 
and like they would sound buzzy
they<00:01:41.780> really<00:01:42.020> don't<00:01:42.170> these<00:01:42.440> strings<00:01:42.680> hold

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
they really don't these strings hold

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.140 
they really don't these strings hold
their<00:01:43.040> own<00:01:43.070> pretty<00:01:43.400> good<00:01:43.640> and<00:01:43.820> they<00:01:43.880> sound

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.150 
their own pretty good and they sound

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:46.540 
their own pretty good and they sound
very<00:01:44.479> good<00:01:44.600> and<00:01:44.869> drop<00:01:45.140> being<00:01:45.380> drop<00:01:46.130> see<00:01:46.369> this
