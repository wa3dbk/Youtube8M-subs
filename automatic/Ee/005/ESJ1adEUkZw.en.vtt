00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
geometrical and I looked a lot into

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.600 
geometrical and I looked a lot into
architecture<00:01:24.000> for<00:01:24.240> inspiration<00:01:25.310> so<00:01:26.310> where's

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
architecture for inspiration so where's

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:36.190 
architecture for inspiration so where's
your<00:01:26.760> Fall<00:01:27.180> collection

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.880 
fall collection is actually one of the
most<00:01:40.170> popular<00:01:40.740> shoes<00:01:41.720> in<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.900> line<00:01:43.110> it's<00:01:43.680> got

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
most popular shoes in the line it's got

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.950 
most popular shoes in the line it's got
a<00:01:43.950> double<00:01:44.190> platform<00:01:44.970> and<00:01:45.270> a<00:01:45.510> little<00:01:45.750> bit<00:01:45.870> of

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
a double platform and a little bit of

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.440 
a double platform and a little bit of
color<00:01:46.170> pop<00:01:46.470> I<00:01:46.770> think<00:01:46.950> yellow<00:01:47.580> is<00:01:47.880> a<00:01:47.910> really<00:01:48.270> hot

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
color pop I think yellow is a really hot

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.660 
color pop I think yellow is a really hot
color<00:01:48.690> and<00:01:48.990> then<00:01:49.440> it's<00:01:49.680> got<00:01:49.800> the<00:01:50.070> cone<00:01:50.400> old

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
color and then it's got the cone old

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:54.110 
color and then it's got the cone old
heel<00:01:50.930> so<00:01:52.040> geometrical<00:01:53.040> shapes<00:01:53.310> it's<00:01:53.760> actually

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:54.120 
heel so geometrical shapes it's actually

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.120 
heel so geometrical shapes it's actually
comfortable<00:01:54.570> too<00:01:54.750> I<00:01:54.960> think<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.620> color<00:01:55.860> is

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
comfortable too I think the color is

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:59.120 
comfortable too I think the color is
really<00:01:56.310> important<00:01:56.820> just<00:01:56.850> popping<00:01:57.950> how<00:01:58.950> did

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
really important just popping how did
