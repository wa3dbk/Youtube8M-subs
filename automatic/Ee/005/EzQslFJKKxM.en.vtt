00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
going across the bridge was not a good

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.920

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:48.490 
know it's pretty good it's not very long

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:49.980 
know it's pretty good it's not very long
you'll<00:01:48.789> beat<00:01:48.939> it<00:01:49.060> in<00:01:49.119> about<00:01:49.299> eight<00:01:49.599> to<00:01:49.780> ten

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
you'll beat it in about eight to ten

was<00:01:55.299> a<00:01:55.329> good<00:01:55.539> idea<00:01:55.569> but<00:01:56.259> uh<00:01:56.289> I<00:01:56.799> felt<00:01:57.310> Bungie

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
was a good idea but uh I felt Bungie

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:58.529 
was a good idea but uh I felt Bungie
probably<00:01:57.939> could<00:01:58.030> have<00:01:58.060> done<00:01:58.149> a<00:01:58.270> little<00:01:58.390> more

00:01:58.529 --> 00:01:58.539 
probably could have done a little more

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:02.160 
probably could have done a little more
with<00:01:58.810> it<00:01:59.609> the<00:02:00.609> second<00:02:00.969> disk<00:02:01.179> you<00:02:01.390> get<00:02:01.569> the<00:02:01.689> 24
