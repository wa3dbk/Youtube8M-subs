00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:26.869 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:29.540 

they're<00:00:27.869> stronger<00:00:28.289> than<00:00:28.320> that<00:00:28.470> I'm<00:00:28.769> I'm

they're stronger than that I'm I'm

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.299 
they're stronger than that I'm I'm
really<00:00:30.150> upset<00:00:30.480> and<00:00:31.080> I'm<00:00:31.260> really<00:00:31.500> angry<00:00:31.710> and

really upset and angry about stuff and I

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.790 
really upset and angry about stuff and I
guess<00:00:35.309> angers<00:00:35.760> a<00:00:35.790> good<00:00:36.090> thing<00:00:36.300> because

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:36.800 
guess angers a good thing because

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.000 
guess angers a good thing because
usually<00:00:37.800> you're<00:00:38.219> angry<00:00:38.730> because<00:00:39.000> of<00:00:40.010> some

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
usually you're angry because of some

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.580 
usually you're angry because of some
kind<00:00:41.190> of<00:00:41.340> injustice<00:00:41.730> some<00:00:42.480> kind<00:00:42.750> of<00:00:42.809> cause<00:00:43.590> and

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:45.590 
kind of injustice some kind of cause and

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.900 
kind of injustice some kind of cause and
probably<00:00:46.670> the<00:00:48.050> there's<00:00:49.050> a<00:00:49.079> good<00:00:49.320> reason<00:00:49.559> for

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
probably the there's a good reason for

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.490 
probably the there's a good reason for
anger<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.180> it's<00:00:51.420> so<00:00:51.570> that<00:00:51.750> you<00:00:51.870> can<00:00:52.079> sort

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
anger and it's so that you can sort

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.010 
anger and it's so that you can sort
these<00:00:52.649> things<00:00:52.710> out<00:00:53.190> but<00:00:54.120> I<00:00:54.420> don't<00:00:54.750> want<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:54.930> be

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.869 
these things out but I don't want to be
a<00:00:55.050> confrontational<00:00:55.890> person<00:00:55.949> I<00:00:56.460> don't<00:00:56.670> want<00:00:56.789> to

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
a confrontational person I don't want to

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.619 
a confrontational person I don't want to
like<00:00:57.600> make<00:00:58.199> it<00:00:58.410> worse<00:00:58.770> by<00:00:59.280> confronting<00:00:59.850> people

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
and so I'm just going to think of what's

the wisest way to go ahead and not

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.980 
the wisest way to go ahead and not
sometimes<00:01:09.870> like<00:01:10.080> just<00:01:10.400> feel<00:01:11.400> exhausted<00:01:11.990> and

sometimes like just feel exhausted and
don't<00:01:13.470> know<00:01:13.560> which<00:01:13.710> way<00:01:13.920> to<00:01:13.980> turn<00:01:15.380> everything

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
don't know which way to turn everything

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:34.160 
don't know which way to turn everything
seems<00:01:16.800> to<00:01:16.890> be<00:01:17.010> like<00:01:17.460> a<00:01:17.490> dead<00:01:17.790> end
