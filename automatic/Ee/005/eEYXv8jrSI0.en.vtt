00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.860 
was to work with my visceral connections
so<00:02:26.230> that<00:02:26.409> when<00:02:26.590> I<00:02:26.620> felt<00:02:27.190> something<00:02:27.819> and<00:02:28.120> that's

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
so that when I felt something and that's

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.110 
so that when I felt something and that's
when<00:02:29.200> I<00:02:29.230> would<00:02:29.349> make<00:02:29.650> a<00:02:29.680> photograph<00:02:30.250> rather

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
when I would make a photograph rather

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.020 
when I would make a photograph rather
than<00:02:31.540> just<00:02:31.959> eyeball<00:02:32.920> it<00:02:32.950> and<00:02:33.459> give<00:02:33.730> it<00:02:33.849> some

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
than just eyeball it and give it some

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:35.940 
than just eyeball it and give it some
shape<00:02:34.329> and<00:02:34.569> everything<00:02:34.840> this<00:02:35.470> was<00:02:35.680> not

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
shape and everything this was not

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:42.390 
shape and everything this was not
something<00:02:36.549> to<00:02:36.730> be<00:02:36.879> an<00:02:37.709> aesthetic<00:02:41.400> recognition

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
something to be an aesthetic recognition

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.490 
something to be an aesthetic recognition
of<00:02:42.609> it<00:02:42.909> was<00:02:43.120> about<00:02:43.420> the<00:02:44.170> connective<00:02:46.500> sensation

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
of it was about the connective sensation

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.009 
of it was about the connective sensation
that<00:02:47.739> makes<00:02:48.099> you<00:02:48.519> and<00:02:48.819> the<00:02:49.060> event<00:02:49.450> align

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
that makes you and the event align

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:52.140 
that makes you and the event align
itself<00:02:50.530> in<00:02:50.799> some<00:02:51.069> way<00:02:51.250> that<00:02:51.280> it<00:02:51.670> goes<00:02:51.879> in

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
itself in some way that it goes in

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.420 
itself in some way that it goes in
deeply<00:02:52.599> and<00:02:52.810> if<00:02:53.260> these<00:02:53.409> pictures<00:02:53.680> have<00:02:54.099> any

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
deeply and if these pictures have any

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:57.660 
deeply and if these pictures have any
resonance<00:02:54.940> it's<00:02:55.420> because<00:02:55.900> they<00:02:56.560> demanded<00:02:57.459> to

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:57.670 
resonance it's because they demanded to

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:03.559 
resonance it's because they demanded to
be<00:02:58.420> made<00:02:58.780> and<00:02:59.260> whatever<00:03:01.200> emotion<00:03:02.200> or<00:03:02.409> beauty

are you know come from the photographs

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:10.140 
are you know come from the photographs
come<00:03:08.590> because<00:03:08.920> that's<00:03:09.129> how<00:03:09.310> it<00:03:09.489> was<00:03:09.730> when<00:03:10.030> it

this idea of beauty because it seems

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:02.580 
were thousands of chairs that had flown

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.360

made a kind of bleachers around the site

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:13.760 
made a kind of bleachers around the site
and<00:05:10.220> workers<00:05:11.220> who<00:05:11.670> were<00:05:11.850> in<00:05:11.880> there<00:05:12.390> for<00:05:13.350> hours

at<00:05:13.950> a<00:05:13.980> time<00:05:14.300> would<00:05:15.300> come<00:05:15.360> out<00:05:15.690> and<00:05:16.880> retreat<00:05:17.880> to

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:18.270 
at a time would come out and retreat to

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.030 
at a time would come out and retreat to
the<00:05:18.420> bleachers<00:05:18.690> which<00:05:19.260> were<00:05:19.470> really<00:05:19.680> let's

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:20.040 
the bleachers which were really let's

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:22.580 
the bleachers which were really let's
say<00:05:20.130> on<00:05:20.340> West<00:05:20.640> Street<00:05:21.030> and<00:05:21.630> Liberty<00:05:22.200> Street

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:25.130 
say on West Street and Liberty Street
and<00:05:22.980> Church<00:05:23.490> Street<00:05:24.000> all<00:05:24.240> the<00:05:24.330> way<00:05:24.420> around<00:05:24.750> and

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:25.140 
and Church Street all the way around and

00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:27.050 
and Church Street all the way around and
they'd<00:05:25.830> sit<00:05:26.070> there<00:05:26.250> with<00:05:26.370> a<00:05:26.400> sandwich<00:05:26.850> or<00:05:27.000> a

they'd sit there with a sandwich or a

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:29.950 
they'd sit there with a sandwich or a
drink<00:05:27.360> and<00:05:27.990> they<00:05:28.200> just<00:05:28.470> stare<00:05:28.890> at<00:05:29.250> the<00:05:29.460> pile

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:29.960

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:32.540 
drink and they just stare at the pile
because<00:05:30.960> the<00:05:31.470> activity<00:05:32.010> on<00:05:32.190> it<00:05:32.400> was

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:32.550 
because the activity on it was

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:34.750 
because the activity on it was
continuing<00:05:33.240> we<00:05:33.480> even<00:05:33.660> when<00:05:33.870> they<00:05:34.020> retreated

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:34.760 
continuing we even when they retreated

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:38.720 
continuing we even when they retreated
it<00:05:35.760> was<00:05:36.120> that<00:05:36.450> much<00:05:36.750> of<00:05:36.780> a<00:05:37.110> visual<00:05:37.590> magnet<00:05:38.160> you

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:38.730 
it was that much of a visual magnet you

00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:40.640 
it was that much of a visual magnet you
could<00:05:38.970> never<00:05:39.270> stop<00:05:39.720> looking<00:05:39.990> at<00:05:40.350> it<00:05:40.500> because

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:40.650 
could never stop looking at it because

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.910 
could never stop looking at it because
it<00:05:41.010> was<00:05:41.210> transforming<00:05:42.210> itself<00:05:42.570> every<00:05:43.500> single

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:43.920 
it was transforming itself every single

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.580 
it was transforming itself every single
day<00:05:44.100> all<00:05:44.610> of<00:05:44.670> the<00:05:45.000> ants<00:05:45.480> were<00:05:45.990> crawling<00:05:46.470> over

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:46.590 
day all of the ants were crawling over

day all of the ants were crawling over
the<00:05:46.830> pile<00:05:47.070> pulling<00:05:47.970> it<00:05:48.060> apart<00:05:48.740> retrieving<00:05:49.740> the

the pile pulling it apart retrieving the

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:52.440 
useful throwing away that the treatise

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:57.170 
useful throwing away that the treatise
it<00:05:52.620> was<00:05:53.040> a<00:05:53.340> constant<00:05:54.090> change<00:05:54.420> so<00:05:54.810> I<00:05:54.990> think<00:05:56.180> the

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:57.180 
it was a constant change so I think the

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.890 
it was a constant change so I think the
properties<00:05:57.480> inherent<00:05:58.470> in<00:05:58.620> the<00:05:58.740> place<00:05:59.010> itself
