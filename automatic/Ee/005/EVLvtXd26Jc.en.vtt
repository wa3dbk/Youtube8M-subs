basically<00:03:37.310> that<00:03:37.820> was<00:03:38.269> the<00:03:38.299> comparison<00:03:38.720> of<00:03:39.200> the

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
basically that was the comparison of the

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:41.920 
basically that was the comparison of the
real<00:03:40.130> first<00:03:40.519> arm<00:03:40.970> real<00:03:41.239> first<00:03:41.450> fake<00:03:41.600> Gucci

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
real first arm real first fake Gucci

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:47.110 
real first arm real first fake Gucci
well<00:03:42.160> these<00:03:43.160> don't<00:03:43.400> have<00:03:43.670> the<00:03:43.970> red<00:03:44.840> green<00:03:46.120> red

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
well these don't have the red green red

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:50.229 
well these don't have the red green red
or<00:03:47.420> whatever<00:03:47.510> the<00:03:47.959> green<00:03:48.200> red<00:03:48.860> green<00:03:49.239> pattern

00:03:50.229 --> 00:03:50.239 
or whatever the green red green pattern

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:52.300 
or whatever the green red green pattern
so<00:03:50.480> I<00:03:50.750> can't<00:03:51.079> really<00:03:51.170> compare<00:03:51.500> it<00:03:51.650> I<00:03:51.829> can

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
so I can't really compare it I can

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.189 
so I can't really compare it I can
compare<00:03:52.609> the<00:03:52.820> double<00:03:53.150> G's<00:03:53.389> I<00:03:53.540> guess<00:03:53.780> between

00:03:54.189 --> 00:03:54.199 
compare the double G's I guess between

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:56.440 
compare the double G's I guess between
these<00:03:54.530> two

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:56.450 
these two

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:00.730 
these two

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:36.500 
Gucci you'll probably figure it out

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.860 
Gucci you'll probably figure it out

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:40.760 
it's on online trying to figure out
