jazz<00:01:50.610> so<00:01:51.299> I<00:01:51.630> think<00:01:51.840> it's<00:01:52.170> best<00:01:52.409> we<00:01:52.530> start<00:01:52.920> at

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
jazz so I think it's best we start at

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.039 
jazz so I think it's best we start at
the<00:01:53.130> beginning<00:01:53.250> and<00:01:53.700> take<00:01:54.180> it<00:01:54.360> in<00:01:54.479> small<00:01:54.630> steps

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
the beginning and take it in small steps

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:56.870 
the beginning and take it in small steps
so<00:01:55.409> you'll<00:01:55.560> understand<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.280> concept<00:01:56.700> and

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
so you'll understand the concept and

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.569 
so you'll understand the concept and
billed<00:01:57.119> as<00:01:57.360> the<00:01:57.810> series<00:01:58.170> can<00:01:58.560> go<00:01:58.680> on<00:01:58.860> with

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
billed as the series can go on with

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.550

subsequent discs that will follow up

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.380 
subsequent discs that will follow up
that's<00:02:01.950> why<00:02:02.070> I<00:02:02.100> chose<00:02:02.340> to<00:02:02.520> call<00:02:02.700> this<00:02:02.850> jazz<00:02:03.180> the

ask me questions I noticed that that's

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.660 
ask me questions I noticed that that's
where<00:02:34.870> they<00:02:35.290> lack<00:02:35.709> they're<00:02:35.980> playing<00:02:36.310> lacks

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
where they lack they're playing lacks

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.140 
where they lack they're playing lacks
chords<00:02:37.540> for<00:02:37.930> naming<00:02:38.260> the<00:02:38.530> chords<00:02:38.950> or<00:02:39.160> ability

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
chords for naming the chords or ability

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.979 
chords for naming the chords or ability
to<00:02:40.270> play<00:02:40.540> many<00:02:40.900> cords<00:02:41.530> etc<00:02:42.239> so<00:02:43.239> I<00:02:43.540> think<00:02:43.690> that's

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
to play many cords etc so I think that's

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:45.930 
to play many cords etc so I think that's
one<00:02:44.230> of<00:02:44.260> the<00:02:44.380> most<00:02:44.620> important<00:02:45.250> aspects<00:02:45.790> of

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
one of the most important aspects of

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:47.640 
one of the most important aspects of

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
jazz guitar playing because eventually

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.949 
jazz guitar playing because eventually
you're<00:02:48.640> not<00:02:48.820> always<00:02:48.940> going<00:02:49.150> to<00:02:49.239> be<00:02:49.270> soloing

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959

and<00:02:50.170> playing<00:02:50.860> lines<00:02:51.340> through<00:02:51.760> changes<00:02:52.540> other

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
and playing lines through changes other

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.690 
and playing lines through changes other
instruments<00:02:53.380> will<00:02:53.500> be<00:02:53.590> playing<00:02:53.890> and<00:02:54.130> they're
