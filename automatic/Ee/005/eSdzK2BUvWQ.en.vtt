00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.190 
opposed to using the like the long
keyboard<00:02:55.700> I<00:02:55.849> really<00:02:56.360> do<00:02:56.540> recommend<00:02:56.720> that<00:02:57.110> you

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
keyboard I really do recommend that you

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.470 
keyboard I really do recommend that you
don't<00:02:57.500> type<00:02:57.829> like<00:02:58.250> a<00:02:58.400> blot<00:02:58.849> on<00:02:59.060> this<00:02:59.299> because

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
don't type like a blot on this because

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:00.910 
don't type like a blot on this because
it<00:02:59.720> really<00:02:59.959> is<00:03:00.049> kind<00:03:00.200> of<00:03:00.319> difficult<00:03:00.500> to<00:03:00.709> type

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
it really is kind of difficult to type

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.009 
it really is kind of difficult to type
on<00:03:01.099> and<00:03:01.280> it<00:03:01.879> would<00:03:02.060> probably<00:03:02.299> get<00:03:02.629> old<00:03:02.810> pretty

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.019 
on and it would probably get old pretty

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:04.150 
on and it would probably get old pretty
fast<00:03:03.349> so<00:03:03.500> I<00:03:03.590> would<00:03:03.799> definitely<00:03:04.099> recommend

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
fast so I would definitely recommend

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.400 
fast so I would definitely recommend
plug<00:03:04.489> in<00:03:04.640> a<00:03:04.730> keyboard<00:03:04.940> or<00:03:05.299> using<00:03:05.870> a<00:03:05.930> chat<00:03:06.170> pad

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
plug in a keyboard or using a chat pad

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.380 
plug in a keyboard or using a chat pad
with<00:03:06.620> your<00:03:06.799> book<00:03:07.069> and<00:03:07.280> quill<00:03:07.489> but<00:03:08.060> as<00:03:08.180> far<00:03:08.359> as

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
with your book and quill but as far as

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:09.610 
with your book and quill but as far as
the<00:03:08.540> book<00:03:08.629> and<00:03:08.810> quill<00:03:08.900> goes<00:03:09.140> I<00:03:09.290> think<00:03:09.500> that's

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
the book and quill goes I think that's

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:11.199 
the book and quill goes I think that's
about<00:03:09.739> all<00:03:10.010> that<00:03:10.040> there<00:03:10.340> is<00:03:10.489> to<00:03:10.700> note<00:03:10.849> on<00:03:11.000> it<00:03:11.030> if

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
about all that there is to note on it if

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:12.339 
about all that there is to note on it if
you<00:03:11.269> guys<00:03:11.359> have<00:03:11.569> any<00:03:11.720> questions<00:03:11.900> about<00:03:12.230> how

00:03:12.339 --> 00:03:12.349
