00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
into the bottom rack now it may be kind

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.479 
into the bottom rack now it may be kind
of<00:02:19.450> confusing<00:02:19.630> to<00:02:20.319> know<00:02:20.470> how<00:02:20.860> much<00:02:21.010> charcoal

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
of confusing to know how much charcoal

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:24.120 
of confusing to know how much charcoal
you<00:02:21.640> need<00:02:21.880> but<00:02:22.750> as<00:02:22.989> a<00:02:23.260> general<00:02:23.650> rule<00:02:23.799> of<00:02:24.040> thumb

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:24.130 
you need but as a general rule of thumb

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.660 
you need but as a general rule of thumb
you<00:02:25.000> can<00:02:25.209> do<00:02:25.360> this<00:02:25.599> you<00:02:26.380> can<00:02:26.590> determine<00:02:26.980> the

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670 
you can do this you can determine the

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.699 
you can do this you can determine the
total<00:02:28.030> surface<00:02:28.269> area<00:02:28.599> that<00:02:29.049> your<00:02:29.200> food<00:02:29.560> will

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
total surface area that your food will

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:33.390 
total surface area that your food will
take<00:02:29.950> up<00:02:30.190> on<00:02:30.430> the<00:02:30.760> top<00:02:30.970> rack<00:02:31.299> and<00:02:32.160> pour<00:02:33.160> the

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
take up on the top rack and pour the

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.699 
take up on the top rack and pour the
charcoal<00:02:33.970> so<00:02:34.540> that<00:02:34.720> you'll<00:02:34.870> have<00:02:35.049> an<00:02:35.200> evenly

distributed single layer of charcoal on
the<00:02:38.739> bottom<00:02:39.040> rack<00:02:39.450> now<00:02:40.450> I'll<00:02:41.410> pour<00:02:41.739> the

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:41.829 
the bottom rack now I'll pour the

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:44.729 
the bottom rack now I'll pour the
charcoal<00:02:42.959> after<00:02:43.959> you<00:02:44.079> have<00:02:44.200> dumped<00:02:44.410> the<00:02:44.470> coals

into<00:02:45.069> the<00:02:45.280> bottom<00:02:45.609> rack<00:02:45.819> you<00:02:46.780> construct<00:02:47.470> a

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
into the bottom rack you construct a

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.520 
into the bottom rack you construct a
pyramid<00:02:48.100> to<00:02:48.459> allow<00:02:48.670> the<00:02:49.150> coals<00:02:49.420> to<00:02:49.660> get

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
pyramid to allow the coals to get

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:53.129 
pyramid to allow the coals to get
properly<00:02:50.950> heated<00:02:51.400> through<00:02:51.840> after<00:02:52.840> you<00:02:52.930> light

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:53.139 
properly heated through after you light

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:55.470 
properly heated through after you light
it<00:02:53.170> now<00:02:54.040> it<00:02:54.250> is<00:02:54.340> very<00:02:54.579> important<00:02:55.090> that<00:02:55.359> before

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
it now it is very important that before

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.650 
it now it is very important that before
you<00:02:55.720> let<00:02:55.959> your<00:02:56.109> coals<00:02:56.350> to<00:02:56.980> open<00:02:57.370> any<00:02:57.660> bottom

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
you let your coals to open any bottom

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.379 
you let your coals to open any bottom
vents<00:02:59.049> that<00:02:59.170> you<00:02:59.260> might<00:02:59.500> have<00:02:59.769> on<00:03:00.220> your

vents that you might have on your
charcoal<00:03:01.389> grill<00:03:01.750> this<00:03:02.200> is<00:03:02.380> a<00:03:02.410> this<00:03:02.769> allows<00:03:03.099> for

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
charcoal grill this is a this allows for

I'm<00:04:29.860> going<00:04:29.920> to<00:04:30.100> knock<00:04:30.310> down<00:04:30.520> the<00:04:31.000> coals<00:04:31.300> here

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 
I'm going to knock down the coals here

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:35.160 
I'm going to knock down the coals here
I'm<00:04:32.530> going<00:04:32.680> to<00:04:32.740> start<00:04:33.040> to<00:04:33.820> develop<00:04:34.120> my<00:04:34.690> even

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:35.170 
I'm going to start to develop my even

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:37.860 
I'm going to start to develop my even
distribution<00:04:35.800> of<00:04:36.280> coals<00:04:36.640> on<00:04:36.940> the<00:04:37.390> bottom<00:04:37.420> rack

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
distribution of coals on the bottom rack

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.790 
distribution of coals on the bottom rack
now<00:04:38.830> when<00:04:39.010> you<00:04:39.100> do<00:04:39.280> this<00:04:39.520> you<00:04:40.450> want<00:04:41.050> to<00:04:41.290> develop

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:41.800 
now when you do this you want to develop

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:49.050 
now when you do this you want to develop
a<00:04:43.020> coat<00:04:44.020> of<00:04:44.290> just<00:04:44.830> one<00:04:45.220> cool<00:04:45.610> deep<00:04:46.330> and<00:04:48.060> you

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:49.060 
a coat of just one cool deep and you

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:51.510 
a coat of just one cool deep and you
want<00:04:49.240> to<00:04:49.360> spread<00:04:49.600> out<00:04:49.750> the<00:04:50.110> coals<00:04:50.320> so<00:04:50.740> ones

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:51.520 
want to spread out the coals so ones

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.580 
want to spread out the coals so ones
that<00:04:51.700> maybe<00:04:51.850> aren't<00:04:52.150> as<00:04:52.360> warm<00:04:52.960> you<00:04:53.320> want<00:04:53.500> to

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.590 
that maybe aren't as warm you want to

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:59.040 
that maybe aren't as warm you want to
put<00:04:53.740> them<00:04:53.890> between<00:04:54.040> ones<00:04:54.550> that<00:04:54.790> are<00:04:55.000> one

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.899 

now<00:05:00.050> this<00:05:00.229> is<00:05:00.379> after<00:05:00.530> I<00:05:00.740> have<00:05:01.159> evenly

00:05:01.899 --> 00:05:01.909 
now this is after I have evenly

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:04.119 
now this is after I have evenly
distributed<00:05:02.720> the<00:05:02.870> coals<00:05:03.139> now<00:05:03.470> as<00:05:03.860> you<00:05:03.949> can<00:05:04.069> see

00:05:04.119 --> 00:05:04.129

here<00:05:04.580> this<00:05:04.729> is<00:05:04.909> very<00:05:05.120> even<00:05:05.569> distribution<00:05:05.689> of

00:05:06.369 --> 00:05:06.379 
here this is very even distribution of

00:05:06.379 --> 00:05:11.080 
here this is very even distribution of
one<00:05:07.099> coal<00:05:07.460> deep<00:05:08.210> and<00:05:08.680> a<00:05:09.680> good<00:05:10.400> way<00:05:10.520> to<00:05:10.580> test<00:05:10.909> to

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:11.090 
one coal deep and a good way to test to

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.390 
one coal deep and a good way to test to
see<00:05:11.270> if<00:05:11.300> your<00:05:11.539> coals<00:05:11.810> are<00:05:12.139> evenly<00:05:12.710> heated<00:05:13.099> on

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:13.400 
see if your coals are evenly heated on

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:16.089 
see if your coals are evenly heated on
the<00:05:13.909> rack<00:05:14.090> is<00:05:14.419> to<00:05:14.750> put<00:05:15.349> your<00:05:15.469> hand<00:05:15.740> over<00:05:15.889> the
