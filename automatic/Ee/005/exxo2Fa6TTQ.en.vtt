00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:32.880 
monday jun 6 2014 ones though

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:35.990

unfortunately<00:07:33.480> there<00:07:34.170> was<00:07:34.380> no<00:07:34.650> iphone<00:07:35.190> 5<00:07:35.580> um

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:36.000 
unfortunately there was no iphone 5 um

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.510 
unfortunately there was no iphone 5 um
so<00:07:36.660> basically<00:07:36.740> because<00:07:37.740> i<00:07:37.770> was<00:07:38.160> five<00:07:38.370> is

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:38.520 
so basically because i was five is

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:39.560 
so basically because i was five is
coming<00:07:38.760> out<00:07:38.850> in<00:07:38.940> the<00:07:38.970> fall<00:07:39.030> i'm<00:07:39.420> going<00:07:39.510> to

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:39.570 
coming out in the fall i'm going to

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:41.900 
coming out in the fall i'm going to
assume<00:07:39.750> that<00:07:39.990> a<00:07:40.260> fall<00:07:40.590> launch<00:07:40.860> for<00:07:41.520> the<00:07:41.610> iphone

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:41.910 
assume that a fall launch for the iphone

00:07:41.910 --> 00:07:44.270 
assume that a fall launch for the iphone
5<00:07:42.120> is<00:07:42.300> likely<00:07:42.630> probably<00:07:42.900> around<00:07:43.230> September<00:07:43.800> so

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:44.280 
5 is likely probably around September so

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:45.980 
5 is likely probably around September so
