00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.230
 all right 

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:09.870
 Welcome to the video before you start 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.269
 I'll explain something very fast, you can 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.490
 jump when you click on the note what 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:16.650
 we will install is a system will create a 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.170
 partition on the pc and we can start it 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.760
 once we turn on the pc it will leave us 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.429
 select the system with which 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.679
 we want to start the system more than anything 

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:27.539
 You could say it's a menu but this 

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:30.300
 menu has the function of selecting with 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.759
 what device to start either usb cd 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.460
 dvd or some partition on the same disk 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.680
 hard this same function we can do it 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.260
 from mine or good most of the 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.510
 computers are coming out lately 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.760
 new computers trying to do 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.070
 more difficult access to this menu to 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.350
 that they do not modify the system by default 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.480
 but thanks to this system we can 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.490
 stop relying on mine and we can 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.890
 start other systems from the pc 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:58.530
 it also works on computers 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.400
 old we can not burn in a cb e 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.980
 start it 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:05.500
 well we entered the page club point more 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.570
 is the official page of this system the 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:11.560
 link will be in the description good 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:14.560
 we go down the plt bt-50 zip and we download it from 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.330
 the url that I'm marking on the screen in 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.000
 this zip file includes everything 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.950
 necessary for its installation well a 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.620
 Once we finished downloading the file 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:25.630
 zip we open or decompress inside 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.790
 from this will come everything necessary for its 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.710
 installation for several systems and 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.350
 even an iso file to burn it in 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.510
 A CD or USB installation is simple 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:37.710
 we take out the folder that says windows and what 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.710
 we go to the desk 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:46.380
 well we execute the batch file called 

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:46.380
 installed bold menu as administrator 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:55.070
 we press twice and enter and when 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.170
 let's see install complete has been completed 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.570
 the installation in less than five 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:02.230
 seconds now it only remains to restart the 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.230
 computer 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.360
 well once I turn on the computer 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:10.460
 this menu will appear where we 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.650
 allows you to select the menu vote well 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:14.750
 start with windows normally for 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.480
 prove that it works we will start the menu 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:20.209
 bot and we will select the usb where I have 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.730
 wifi is the one that gave me an error but this 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:24.980
 it was because I had the usb connected when 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.600
 start it, so we just take out the 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.000
 usb and reconnect 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:31.220
 we select usb and ready will start the 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.930
 good system explained the first two 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.570
 options are the partitions of the 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.820
 computer the first one is windows 8 the 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:39.890
 second this menu I think that floppy is the 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:42.170
 entrance of old cafes or maybe of 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.720
 memories I'm not sure good then 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:47.320
 is the cd and dvd input and finally 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.320
 the usb 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:58.760
 well I wanted to record off screen for 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.470
 they saw that if it works that not only 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:02.750
 is an emulator and that is compatible with 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:04.610
 all windows and systems in general 

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:06.860
 we can see that the administrator 

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:09.200
 home is different in windows 7 but 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.300
 works the same we select the second 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.430
 system and the same menu appears 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:15.440
 we select usb and as you see start the 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:18.290
 system that I have flipped in memory 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.480
 I think it's all for this video I hope 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.100
 that is useful or interesting not 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.240
 forget to like the video and 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.240
