00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:34.850 
alsa well not exactly Elsa directly but
in<00:04:33.120> her<00:04:33.300> castle<00:04:33.660> she<00:04:34.410> would<00:04:34.530> be<00:04:34.650> on<00:04:34.740> the

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:34.860 
in her castle she would be on the

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:37.040
