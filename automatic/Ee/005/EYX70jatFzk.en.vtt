honest with you I think it was just a
masterclass<00:00:34.980> and<00:00:35.100> it<00:00:35.370> should<00:00:35.579> be<00:00:35.670> more<00:00:35.850> than

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910

well<00:00:51.300> we<00:00:51.420> played<00:00:51.660> them<00:00:52.020> but<00:00:52.469> worse<00:00:52.680> we<00:00:53.250> played

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489

him<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.760> following<00:00:54.090> year<00:00:54.300> would<00:00:54.510> be<00:00:54.539> vanilla

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
also suffered as well and I think

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.630

obviously<00:00:57.960> three<00:00:58.199> noise<00:00:58.379> it<00:00:58.590> 6-1<00:00:58.890> but<00:00:59.370> I<00:00:59.399> mean

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
obviously three noise it 6-1 but I mean

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.260 
obviously three noise it 6-1 but I mean

it wasn't even close and he's so in such

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.170 
it wasn't even close and he's so in such
a<00:01:03.390> long<00:01:03.510> time<00:01:03.710> his<00:01:04.710> City<00:01:05.489> fans<00:01:05.790> have<00:01:05.939> been<00:01:05.970> able
