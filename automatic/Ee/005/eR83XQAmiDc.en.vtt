00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:41.470 
but that one was more just like driving

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.589 
but that one was more just like driving
in<00:04:41.710> a<00:04:41.770> car<00:04:41.949> and<00:04:42.400> dancing<00:04:42.789> like<00:04:42.940> I<00:04:43.210> couldn't

00:04:43.589 --> 00:04:43.599 
in a car and dancing like I couldn't

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:45.240 
in a car and dancing like I couldn't
really<00:04:43.659> follow<00:04:44.080> it<00:04:44.409> there<00:04:44.530> definitely<00:04:44.710> was

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250 
really follow it there definitely was

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:46.830 
really follow it there definitely was
something<00:04:45.639> there<00:04:45.849> because<00:04:46.240> they<00:04:46.419> went<00:04:46.630> like

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:46.840 
something there because they went like

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:48.210 
something there because they went like
all<00:04:47.020> the<00:04:47.139> way<00:04:47.229> forward<00:04:47.530> and<00:04:47.830> I<00:04:47.949> they<00:04:48.039> made<00:04:48.190> a

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:48.220 
all the way forward and I they made a

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:49.860 
all the way forward and I they made a
point<00:04:48.430> to<00:04:48.550> go<00:04:48.729> reverse<00:04:49.030> like<00:04:49.360> then<00:04:49.539> put<00:04:49.720> in<00:04:49.840> the

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:49.870 
point to go reverse like then put in the

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.680 
point to go reverse like then put in the
water<00:04:49.960> falling<00:04:50.710> so<00:04:51.159> we'd<00:04:51.340> see<00:04:51.490> it<00:04:51.610> go<00:04:51.760> back<00:04:52.030> see

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:52.690 
water falling so we'd see it go back see

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:54.240 
water falling so we'd see it go back see
something<00:04:53.050> very<00:04:53.080> and<00:04:53.530> this<00:04:53.680> would<00:04:53.800> be<00:04:53.889> so<00:04:54.070> much

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:54.250 
something very and this would be so much

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:58.469 
something very and this would be so much
easier<00:04:56.580> way<00:04:57.580> to<00:04:57.610> know<00:04:57.820> there<00:04:58.000> definitely<00:04:58.150> was

00:04:58.469 --> 00:04:58.479 
easier way to know there definitely was

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:00.000 
easier way to know there definitely was
something<00:04:58.750> there<00:04:58.840> but<00:04:59.110> that's<00:04:59.229> not<00:04:59.560> my

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:00.010
