 its director 

00:00:14.729 --> 00:00:19.419
 Bolivia is supposedly routine transformed into a nightmare is that the 

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:22.669
 September 23 will be a day that you can hardly forget 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:28.190
 in these delicate and busy they miraculously saved themselves after sinking their ship to 

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:33.150
 160 kilometers of the national coasts in the Caribbean sea 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.400
 two small boats were their only shelters 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.620
 during a storm that for almost three hours almost takes them to the bottom of the ocean 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.640
 the water entered the machinery area everywhere 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.020
 images recorded by the crew themselves seemed to become 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:00.379
 businessman 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:03.379
 it would be practically impossible to avoid the shipwreck 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.800
 it does not make sense that he transported cardboard 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.800
 set sail from pier begin on the morning of September 23 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.369
 destination to puerto venezuela hair however almost 24 hours later in 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.160
 Middle of the Caribbean Sea 

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.320
 in women 58 feet of length the same scenario 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.120
 we were sailing very well the weather was pretty hard we had league 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.299
 approximately between 12 and 15 feet the captain says that the first voice of 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:35.479
 alert gave the machinist venegas his guard 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.360
 a approximately 11 and 35 minutes 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.610
 when it says good to me there is a strong presence of water in the machine 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.080
 entós lf machine low 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.210
 he notices what the situation was since the water was on the floor of the machine 

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.540
 it tells me capital there is problem in the machine account that all were made 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.180
 the processes to avoid the shipwreck 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:02.920
 what in spite of occupying several pumps to drain the mountain 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.920
 the objective was not achieved as can be seen in the images 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.610
 there were four pumps running 

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:12.219
 4 electric pump 

00:02:12.219 --> 00:02:16.379
 when the water continued to rise, the flow of water continued to increase 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:22.219
 Heras was tremendous with everything we would incorporate two bombs to the laptop 

00:02:23.289 --> 00:02:27.939
 which did not turn out either according to fabian coins the boat was carrying 

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:33.449
 that day 611 tons of cargo did not have capacity for one thousand three hundred 

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:37.319
 therefore discards that the sinking was his expulsion from Jesus 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:41.829
 in the state of the ship to set sail so has raised suspicions between 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:46.479
 crew had been standing on us for two years we regret that boat had 

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:48.229
 worked here on it 

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:52.479
 In San Pedro de Macorís and had made several trips of cement and plaster 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:56.889
 but if he had been unemployed for only two years he remarked that he trains 

00:02:59.419 --> 00:03:01.589
 the worst condition 

00:03:01.589 --> 00:03:04.459
 when you have been standing for so long 

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:07.459
 one on the pier of san pedro de macorís 

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:10.689
 port on a dock that does not have 

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:15.759
 Closing care when I stop I love for the boat daniel de jesús garcía 

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:18.430
 apple tree was the chief engineer of a dream 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.659
 always giving blows to the sale on Tuesday 

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:24.879
 knocking against the pier because I did not even have 

00:03:24.879 --> 00:03:27.029
 in a place that was there was no 

00:03:27.029 --> 00:03:28.389
 to say it 

00:03:28.389 --> 00:03:29.889
 defending 

00:03:29.889 --> 00:03:35.509
 for the network ensures that the problem recognize the lack of review before 

00:03:35.509 --> 00:03:36.840
 jump to venezuela 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:40.100
 considered this one had though that day 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.819
 warning 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:44.739
 the ship's hull 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:46.719
 after loading 

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:49.719
 to go on a voyage to the sea 

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:51.949
 quite 

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:56.249
 e it is not for the time that is taken but for the complexity of marking and 

00:03:56.829 --> 00:03:59.829
 the Caribbean a 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:01.759
 i 

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:05.429
 not even the table the opportunity is fine 

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:11.139
 some diver or drought well the pact of the bunker 

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:15.970
 but hey the thefts are not fulfilled only the euro zone that yes no 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:20.490
 Both crew members reported that people are dealing with a critical situation that 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:25.080
 could have influenced the performance or 

00:04:26.559 --> 00:04:29.559
 of the water entering on one side and a mountain set 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.729
 bravo pedro marín 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:37.460
 trying to survive in the mediocre 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:39.909
 of the Caribbean Sea 

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:45.509
 a storm like this the weather is quite strong had absolved of area 

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:47.499
 there was strong wind 

00:04:47.499 --> 00:04:54.119
 solar percent the work that was covering the quality of the paper already 

00:04:54.119 --> 00:04:57.349
 they had broken even older 

00:04:57.349 --> 00:05:00.020
 to start the motor pump 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:03.020
 zelaya I got excited 

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:04.770
 it turned on 

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:06.599
 but not now 

00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:12.399
 I cheer up carlos reinoso of 16 helmsman of the ship when 

00:05:13.439 --> 00:05:16.569
 the population in 2009 the mind before this mom 

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:21.210
 The user's experience is that the boat 

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:23.180
 it can not be done anymore 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:26.120
 many things come back even if you answer me 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.909
 of a song 

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:30.830

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:38.039
 from honda to about evil 

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:39.419
 those who give 

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:43.590
 finger of the feder the wrong marker reminds me this song is good here 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:45.460
 and the quarry and 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.449
 quarry a little and 

00:05:47.449 --> 00:05:50.449
 I painted doing my job a pretty experience 

00:05:51.319 --> 00:05:52.520
 quite 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:54.650
 very flattering very good 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:57.650
 us when they later shouted emergency 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:00.680
 I already had food is 

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:05.770
 food that we do not meet antonio valle look at the video I was left without eating something 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:07.729
 some bought another no 

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:10.589
 but I can from outside dante 

00:06:10.589 --> 00:06:14.089
 pretty bad to experience some calm seal calm crewmembers 

00:06:14.089 --> 00:06:15.400
 we have another 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:18.559
 let's talk i believe in god 

00:06:18.559 --> 00:06:20.259
 that we have alive 

00:06:20.259 --> 00:06:23.860
 if they do not keep it alive Carlos Carlos Reyes 

00:06:24.809 --> 00:06:27.150
 the boiled hope 

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:29.259
 I met at the point 

00:06:29.259 --> 00:06:32.589
 specified that we have a meeting point 

00:06:32.589 --> 00:06:34.409
 to rotate to 

00:06:34.409 --> 00:06:37.409
 but when totaling the lifeboats 

00:06:38.279 --> 00:06:40.240
 all is 

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:42.610
 and what he did not mention in a low 

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:45.529
 in my first phase 

00:06:45.529 --> 00:06:48.529
 I felt so bad because it made me worse 

00:06:52.499 --> 00:06:56.759
 or witness how they survived for three hours on the rafts and what 

00:06:56.759 --> 00:07:01.539
 What was waiting for them when the immigration arrived on the ground after paying passports? 

00:07:01.539 --> 00:07:06.199
