00:00:02.989 --> 00:00:06.410
 or not 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:17.640
 The first thing we are going to place are the 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:20.750
 peace grapes 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:24.380
 little by little too 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:27.710
 how are you cooking us because the grapes 

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:30.770
 rates because right now you're by 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:33.410
 example have schulze then we 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:37.370
 we have to look at the milk can 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:39.800
 condensed how much we are going to put 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.570
 our dessert 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:46.200
 without us being able to access the candy 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:49.070
 that fits us well with candy then 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.070
 here we have 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:58.750
 milk cloves cinnamon sugar 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:04.000
 the eggs and the sword 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:06.630
 let's add now a trickle 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.250
 of extra 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.250
 coconut extract 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:17.350
 we already have it at this point we have it 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:19.300
 in low fire let's add the rest 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.610
 of sugar 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.010
 then we put them all the cup of 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.390
 sugar 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:28.130
 we stir 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:33.490
 we let this cook us in another 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:36.040
 Let's take as little at this point 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:39.470
 the sweet 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:42.500
 to know how sweet it is 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:44.840
 and how much milk that he still 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.220
 we can put are how it is 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:51.420
 perfect 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:55.860
 now let's add the milk 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:02:00.920
 condensed I think we're going to 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.920
 place half a jar of condensed milk 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:11.050
 well mixed and we're going to let it boil 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.050
 again 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:21.170
 very very very very satisfied with the 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:22.910
 texture with everything as we have already been 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:27.080
 at this time then we 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:28.820
 we turn off I must clarify that this is yesterday 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:31.790
 asked more or less for space between 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:36.110
 10 and 15 minutes because the egg should 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:38.870
 to be well cooked very well cooked 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:42.050
 egg we have it ready then in 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:45.350
 this moment we are going to proceed to 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:50.330
 pass it to a source to a refractory 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:54.800
 Well what you have for good now 

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:58.260
 hands so that to cool it down 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:03.500
 like most desserts 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.500
 it's a dish that looks better 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:10.409
 the next day or this dessert 

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:14.840
 tomorrow is absolutely delicious in 

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:18.890
 this moment and when it is already taken 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:21.200
 as we say happened a while later 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:24.290
 from the hard moment of cooking then 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:29.470
 we proceed to put the 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.470
 trickle of liquor of our preference 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:36.600
 place this amount of rum what 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:40.860
 we mix well mixed to me in what 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:43.860
 I like more with rum than with 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:48.660
 aguardiente but that's what it is 

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:52.560
 choice of you good I hope that 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:57.920
 elaborate this easy and simple dessert 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.920
 see you in a next opportunity
