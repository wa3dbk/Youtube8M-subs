00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
not have asked question about the test

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:16.599 
not have asked question about the test
subject<00:00:11.690> who<00:00:12.690> were<00:00:12.960> they<00:00:13.460> before<00:00:15.020> cognitive

subject who were they before cognitive
isn't<00:00:17.609> just<00:00:17.910> science<00:00:18.390> fiction<00:00:18.510> it<00:00:19.109> will<00:00:19.439> allow

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
isn't just science fiction it will allow

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.759 
isn't just science fiction it will allow
us<00:00:19.830> to<00:00:20.070> remove<00:00:20.609> specific<00:00:21.000> memories<00:00:21.930> of<00:00:22.140> severe

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
us to remove specific memories of severe

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.189 
us to remove specific memories of severe
psychological<00:00:23.189> trauma<00:00:24.029> what<00:00:24.930> is<00:00:25.019> knowledge

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
psychological trauma what is knowledge

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.170 
psychological trauma what is knowledge

new video from call of duty from the
snapchat<00:00:29.820> and<00:00:29.939> this<00:00:30.119> one<00:00:30.359> is<00:00:30.570> extremely

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
snapchat and this one is extremely

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.200 
snapchat and this one is extremely
interesting<00:00:31.500> so<00:00:32.070> basically<00:00:32.399> what<00:00:32.610> dr.<00:00:32.880> Salim

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
interesting so basically what dr. Salim

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.120 
interesting so basically what dr. Salim
says<00:00:33.510> is<00:00:33.719> that<00:00:33.750> he<00:00:33.899> asked<00:00:34.200> a<00:00:34.260> very<00:00:34.290> important

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
says is that he asked a very important

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.700 
says is that he asked a very important
question<00:00:35.250> he<00:00:35.910> asks<00:00:36.300> who<00:00:36.660> were<00:00:36.840> they<00:00:37.079> who<00:00:37.500> were

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
question he asks who were they who were

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.740 
question he asks who were they who were
they<00:00:37.890> before<00:00:37.969> basically<00:00:38.969> questioning<00:00:39.570> his

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
they before basically questioning his

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.959 
they before basically questioning his
whole<00:00:39.930> entire<00:00:40.170> process<00:00:40.530> then<00:00:41.219> he<00:00:41.309> also<00:00:41.460> states

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
whole entire process then he also states

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.630 
whole entire process then he also states
that<00:00:42.120> cognitive<00:00:42.860> manipulation<00:00:43.860> will<00:00:44.340> allow

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
that cognitive manipulation will allow

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.880 
that cognitive manipulation will allow
them<00:00:44.910> to<00:00:45.090> remove<00:00:45.420> certain<00:00:45.809> memories<00:00:46.350> that

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
them to remove certain memories that

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.860 
them to remove certain memories that
were<00:00:47.039> not<00:00:47.219> so<00:00:47.520> good<00:00:47.789> so<00:00:47.969> basically<00:00:48.420> it's<00:00:48.570> dr.

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
were not so good so basically it's dr.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.119 
were not so good so basically it's dr.
Salim<00:00:49.200> a<00:00:49.289> good<00:00:49.440> guy<00:00:49.590> that's<00:00:49.800> what<00:00:50.010> we're

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
Salim a good guy that's what we're

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.290 
Salim a good guy that's what we're
getting<00:00:50.219> from<00:00:50.399> it<00:00:50.550> so<00:00:50.670> let's<00:00:50.850> break<00:00:51.090> it<00:00:51.270> down

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
getting from it so let's break it down

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.779 
getting from it so let's break it down
so<00:00:52.079> we<00:00:52.230> start<00:00:52.469> off<00:00:52.649> of<00:00:52.890> course<00:00:53.160> with<00:00:53.370> our<00:00:53.399> brain

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
so we start off of course with our brain

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.790 
so we start off of course with our brain
and<00:00:53.820> we<00:00:54.090> never<00:00:54.270> actually<00:00:54.660> see<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:55.350> brain

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
and we never actually see the brain

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.709 
and we never actually see the brain
being<00:00:56.129> implanted<00:00:56.610> with<00:00:56.910> something<00:00:57.239> rather

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
being implanted with something rather

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.650 
being implanted with something rather
people<00:00:58.050> being<00:00:58.379> tested<00:00:58.949> now<00:00:59.520> these<00:01:00.030> testings

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
people being tested now these testings

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.810 
people being tested now these testings
whether<00:01:00.930> they're<00:01:01.199> zombies<00:01:01.520> whether<00:01:02.520> this<00:01:02.760> is

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
whether they're zombies whether this is

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.149 
whether they're zombies whether this is
all<00:01:03.090> part<00:01:03.420> of<00:01:03.480> like<00:01:03.629> a<00:01:03.660> gk<00:01:04.080> no<00:01:04.199> 6<00:01:04.530> or<00:01:04.739> it's<00:01:04.920> part

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
all part of like a gk no 6 or it's part

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.469 
all part of like a gk no 6 or it's part
of<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.280> campaign<00:01:05.640> we<00:01:05.790> don't<00:01:06.000> know<00:01:06.150> but<00:01:06.330> what

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
of the campaign we don't know but what

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.450 
of the campaign we don't know but what
we<00:01:06.600> do<00:01:06.810> know<00:01:06.840> is<00:01:07.260> that<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.799> lot<00:01:07.979> of<00:01:08.040> this<00:01:08.250> is

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
we do know is that a lot of this is

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.480 
we do know is that a lot of this is
relating<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.659> the<00:01:10.200> people<00:01:10.650> essentially<00:01:11.130> being

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
relating to the people essentially being

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:12.410 
relating to the people essentially being
desert<00:01:11.790> on<00:01:11.880> having<00:01:12.119> their<00:01:12.240> brains

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
desert on having their brains

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.810 
desert on having their brains
manipulated<00:01:13.020> and<00:01:13.170> in<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.409> future<00:01:13.619> robots<00:01:14.610> and

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
manipulated and in the future robots and

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.730 
manipulated and in the future robots and
humans<00:01:14.850> almost<00:01:15.630> being<00:01:15.810> one<00:01:16.170> so<00:01:16.380> be<00:01:16.530> very

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
humans almost being one so be very

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.940 
humans almost being one so be very
interesting<00:01:17.189> to<00:01:17.310> see<00:01:17.520> where<00:01:18.119> they<00:01:18.299> take<00:01:18.330> that

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
interesting to see where they take that

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.320 
interesting to see where they take that
so<00:01:19.950> as<00:01:20.100> we<00:01:20.250> keep<00:01:20.430> going<00:01:20.640> through<00:01:20.970> this<00:01:21.119> we

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
so as we keep going through this we

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.359 
so as we keep going through this we
scroll<00:01:21.630> we<00:01:22.110> just<00:01:22.350> see<00:01:22.470> a<00:01:22.500> lot<00:01:22.740> of<00:01:22.770> the<00:01:22.950> testing

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
scroll we just see a lot of the testing

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.010 
scroll we just see a lot of the testing
in<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.520> brain<00:01:23.820> functioning<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:24.659> then

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
in the brain functioning and then

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.890 
in the brain functioning and then
something<00:01:25.259> really<00:01:25.530> just<00:01:26.460> interesting<00:01:27.090> like

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
something really just interesting like

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.870 
something really just interesting like
about<00:01:28.140> these<00:01:28.320> shots<00:01:28.650> is<00:01:28.829> how<00:01:28.979> much<00:01:29.490> you<00:01:29.700> can

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
about these shots is how much you can

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.429 
about these shots is how much you can
see<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.240> skull<00:01:30.570> like<00:01:30.750> there's<00:01:30.930> a<00:01:31.020> shot<00:01:31.229> of<00:01:31.350> the

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
see the skull like there's a shot of the

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.200 
see the skull like there's a shot of the
skull<00:01:31.740> here<00:01:32.009> for<00:01:32.220> a<00:01:32.250> real<00:01:32.460> quick<00:01:32.729> second<00:01:33.119> that

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
skull here for a real quick second that

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.850 
skull here for a real quick second that
you<00:01:33.329> can<00:01:33.509> see<00:01:33.659> almost<00:01:33.869> what<00:01:34.320> looks<00:01:34.530> like<00:01:34.590> to<00:01:34.740> be

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
you can see almost what looks like to be

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.249 
you can see almost what looks like to be
a<00:01:34.979> skull<00:01:35.310> and<00:01:35.460> whether<00:01:36.329> or<00:01:36.420> not<00:01:36.659> this<00:01:36.840> testing

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
a skull and whether or not this testing

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.660 
a skull and whether or not this testing
will<00:01:37.409> relate<00:01:37.710> to<00:01:37.829> zombies<00:01:38.130> we<00:01:38.280> really<00:01:38.520> won't

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
will relate to zombies we really won't

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.520 
will relate to zombies we really won't
know<00:01:38.820> and<00:01:39.329> then<00:01:39.689> once<00:01:39.960> again<00:01:40.200> we<00:01:40.290> get<00:01:40.409> our

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
know and then once again we get our

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.649 
know and then once again we get our
William<00:01:40.740> Shatner<00:01:41.340> being<00:01:41.579> tested<00:01:41.970> on<00:01:42.090> freaking

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
William Shatner being tested on freaking

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.030 
William Shatner being tested on freaking
on<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:42.899> chair<00:01:43.140> but<00:01:43.290> you<00:01:43.409> never<00:01:43.619> actually<00:01:43.799> see

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
on the chair but you never actually see

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.789 
on the chair but you never actually see
anything<00:01:44.790> go<00:01:44.909> over<00:01:44.939> him<00:01:45.420> other<00:01:45.659> than<00:01:46.140> him<00:01:46.560> with

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
anything go over him other than him with

get doesn't really discuss much but then

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.319 
get doesn't really discuss much but then
we<00:01:54.899> get<00:01:55.079> a<00:01:55.110> brain<00:01:55.560> like<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:56.280> bring<00:01:56.579> going<00:01:57.030> over

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
we get a brain like to bring going over

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.240 
we get a brain like to bring going over
like<00:01:57.509> what<00:01:57.689> looks<00:01:57.869> like<00:01:57.960> film<00:01:58.409> with<00:01:59.070> the

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
like what looks like film with the

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.010 
like what looks like film with the
character<00:01:59.759> in<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.030> back<00:02:00.210> so<00:02:00.420> that's<00:02:00.600> very

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
character in the back so that's very

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.920 
character in the back so that's very
interesting<00:02:01.229> to<00:02:01.619> see<00:02:01.770> all<00:02:01.979> of<00:02:02.159> them<00:02:02.369> scared

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
interesting to see all of them scared

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
interesting to see all of them scared
questioning<00:02:03.930> where<00:02:04.170> they<00:02:04.350> are<00:02:04.500> what<00:02:04.799> they

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
questioning where they are what they

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.459 
questioning where they are what they
were<00:02:05.009> doing<00:02:05.369> dr.<00:02:05.939> Salim<00:02:06.240> wondering<00:02:06.689> if<00:02:07.259> they

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
were doing dr. Salim wondering if they

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.080 
were doing dr. Salim wondering if they
had<00:02:07.619> a<00:02:07.649> family<00:02:07.979> before<00:02:08.099> you<00:02:08.580> know<00:02:08.700> that<00:02:08.910> kind

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
had a family before you know that kind

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.540 
had a family before you know that kind
of<00:02:09.209> a<00:02:09.330> deal<00:02:09.539> then<00:02:10.259> cognitive<00:02:10.890> manipulation

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
of a deal then cognitive manipulation

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.580 
of a deal then cognitive manipulation
really<00:02:11.849> manipulate

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
really manipulate

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:13.930 
really manipulate
the<00:02:12.680> brain<00:02:12.890> is<00:02:13.069> what<00:02:13.250> another<00:02:13.489> interesting

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:13.940 
the brain is what another interesting

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.360 
the brain is what another interesting
thing<00:02:13.970> is<00:02:14.300> now<00:02:14.900> you<00:02:14.930> can<00:02:15.260> almost<00:02:15.410> see<00:02:15.830> a<00:02:15.860> drone

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
thing is now you can almost see a drone

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.640 
thing is now you can almost see a drone
and<00:02:16.730> I'll<00:02:16.879> play<00:02:17.150> it<00:02:17.180> back<00:02:17.420> here<00:02:17.810> what<00:02:18.290> appears

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
and I'll play it back here what appears

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.380 
and I'll play it back here what appears
to<00:02:18.769> be<00:02:18.800> a<00:02:18.890> drone<00:02:19.280> come<00:02:19.640> from<00:02:20.090> the<00:02:20.209> future

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
to be a drone come from the future

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.960 
to be a drone come from the future
flying<00:02:21.379> over<00:02:21.800> what<00:02:21.950> appears<00:02:22.280> to<00:02:22.400> be<00:02:22.430> a<00:02:22.519> red

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
flying over what appears to be a red

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.740 
flying over what appears to be a red
sunset<00:02:23.450> or<00:02:23.930> blood<00:02:24.680> it's<00:02:24.950> hard<00:02:25.220> to<00:02:25.370> tell<00:02:25.690> so<00:02:26.690> you

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
sunset or blood it's hard to tell so you

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.089 
sunset or blood it's hard to tell so you
have<00:02:27.080> I<00:02:27.290> mean<00:02:27.440> all<00:02:27.560> of<00:02:27.590> these<00:02:27.769> are<00:02:27.890> extremely

00:02:28.089 --> 00:02:28.099 
have I mean all of these are extremely

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:30.339 
have I mean all of these are extremely
hard<00:02:28.310> to<00:02:28.400> tell<00:02:28.640> but<00:02:29.180> then<00:02:29.360> you<00:02:29.480> have<00:02:29.629> the<00:02:30.110> brain

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:30.349 
hard to tell but then you have the brain

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:32.619 
hard to tell but then you have the brain
being<00:02:30.590> manipulated<00:02:31.250> upon<00:02:31.519> again<00:02:31.819> truly<00:02:32.599> you

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:32.629 
being manipulated upon again truly you

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:34.839 
being manipulated upon again truly you
see<00:02:32.959> blood<00:02:33.230> and<00:02:33.500> then<00:02:33.620> you<00:02:33.739> get<00:02:33.860> a<00:02:33.920> really<00:02:34.430> good

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:34.849 
see blood and then you get a really good

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:36.789 
see blood and then you get a really good
shot<00:02:35.209> of<00:02:35.269> the<00:02:35.480> drone<00:02:35.900> going<00:02:36.080> across<00:02:36.379> and<00:02:36.500> it

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:36.799 
shot of the drone going across and it

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:39.130 
shot of the drone going across and it
could<00:02:37.040> even<00:02:37.250> be<00:02:37.310> a<00:02:37.430> hand<00:02:37.819> going<00:02:38.180> the<00:02:38.299> wave<00:02:38.510> what

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:39.140 
could even be a hand going the wave what

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.770 
could even be a hand going the wave what
hang<00:02:39.739> loose<00:02:40.040> sign<00:02:40.370> you<00:02:41.000> can't<00:02:41.269> really<00:02:41.450> tell

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
hang loose sign you can't really tell

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.780 
hang loose sign you can't really tell
but<00:02:41.930> it<00:02:42.080> is<00:02:42.260> definitely<00:02:42.590> a<00:02:42.920> drone<00:02:43.370> flying

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
but it is definitely a drone flying

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.940 
but it is definitely a drone flying
across<00:02:44.150> so<00:02:44.870> troika<00:02:45.290> is<00:02:45.349> returning<00:02:45.739> to<00:02:45.829> the

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
across so troika is returning to the

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.650 
across so troika is returning to the
future<00:02:46.190> which<00:02:46.370> we<00:02:46.489> all<00:02:46.640> kind<00:02:46.849> of<00:02:46.880> knew<00:02:47.090> from

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:47.660 
future which we all kind of knew from

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:50.920 
future which we all kind of knew from
the<00:02:47.810> leak<00:02:47.989> about<00:02:48.290> the<00:02:48.410> description<00:02:49.329> now<00:02:50.329> the

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:50.930 
the leak about the description now the

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.300 
the leak about the description now the
rest<00:02:51.140> of<00:02:51.290> it<00:02:51.410> is<00:02:51.530> really<00:02:51.769> just<00:02:51.950> a<00:02:52.069> lot<00:02:52.280> of

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
rest of it is really just a lot of

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.449 
rest of it is really just a lot of
testing<00:02:52.880> on<00:02:53.030> people<00:02:53.540> make<00:02:54.349> up<00:02:54.560> the<00:02:54.890> cognitive

00:02:55.449 --> 00:02:55.459 
testing on people make up the cognitive

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:57.670 
testing on people make up the cognitive
testing<00:02:55.970> and<00:02:56.269> you<00:02:56.420> get<00:02:56.569> a<00:02:56.599> cot<00:02:56.900> a<00:02:56.930> shot<00:02:57.379> of<00:02:57.530> what

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
testing and you get a cot a shot of what

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.400 
testing and you get a cot a shot of what
looks<00:02:57.890> like<00:02:57.980> to<00:02:58.099> be<00:02:58.250> teeth<00:02:58.870> more<00:02:59.870> functioning

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.410 
looks like to be teeth more functioning

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.800 
looks like to be teeth more functioning
on<00:03:00.500> the<00:03:00.620> brain<00:03:00.829> removing<00:03:01.370> memories<00:03:01.790> and<00:03:02.060> the

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
on the brain removing memories and the

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.960 
on the brain removing memories and the
brown<00:03:03.260> again<00:03:03.590> and<00:03:03.860> then<00:03:03.980> lifting<00:03:04.549> up<00:03:04.700> the

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
brown again and then lifting up the

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.089 
brown again and then lifting up the
person<00:03:05.480> from<00:03:05.660> the<00:03:05.900> bed<00:03:06.110> who<00:03:06.560> looks<00:03:06.799> like<00:03:06.860> he's

00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:07.099 
person from the bed who looks like he's

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:08.979 
person from the bed who looks like he's
extremely<00:03:07.519> confused<00:03:08.150> and<00:03:08.329> lost<00:03:08.480> at<00:03:08.780> what's

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
extremely confused and lost at what's

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:11.050 
extremely confused and lost at what's
going<00:03:09.049> on<00:03:09.440> and<00:03:09.769> then<00:03:10.549> you<00:03:10.700> have<00:03:10.790> the<00:03:10.879> drone

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
going on and then you have the drone

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.819 
going on and then you have the drone
again<00:03:11.269> so<00:03:11.870> what<00:03:12.049> does<00:03:12.140> this<00:03:12.290> mean<00:03:12.500> is<00:03:12.739> this

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:12.829 
again so what does this mean is this

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:14.080 
again so what does this mean is this
showing<00:03:13.129> that<00:03:13.250> as<00:03:13.459> we<00:03:13.640> are<00:03:13.760> going<00:03:13.970> to<00:03:14.060> the

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
showing that as we are going to the

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:15.580 
showing that as we are going to the
future<00:03:14.420> because<00:03:14.660> we<00:03:14.780> do<00:03:14.930> have<00:03:15.110> a<00:03:15.140> trailer<00:03:15.560> on

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
future because we do have a trailer on

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.590 
future because we do have a trailer on
sunday<00:03:16.069> so<00:03:16.129> proves<00:03:16.700> that<00:03:16.850> we<00:03:17.030> are<00:03:17.060> going<00:03:17.510> to

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:17.600 
sunday so proves that we are going to

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.569 
sunday so proves that we are going to
the<00:03:17.690> future<00:03:17.959> even<00:03:18.260> more<00:03:18.620> but<00:03:19.280> what's<00:03:19.459> really

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:19.579 
the future even more but what's really

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:21.430 
the future even more but what's really
cool<00:03:19.790> about<00:03:19.880> this<00:03:20.120> guy's<00:03:20.329> is<00:03:20.600> that<00:03:20.780> we<00:03:21.260> get<00:03:21.410> a

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
cool about this guy's is that we get a

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.740 
cool about this guy's is that we get a
