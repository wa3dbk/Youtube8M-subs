00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.030
 you know already and today 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.269
 I answer again a question of 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.440
 you and the sebastian has me 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.240
 written 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.940
 Christian I have my question and that 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.539
 I have new ones on my western guitar 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:25.170
 strings reared the old goods 10 up 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:27.779
 47 and the new ones are eleven at 52 so 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.519
 thicker now I have now the neck 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.099
 died newly set or new 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.079
 set and if so should I 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.790
 Do it yourself or a professional 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.120
 thank you in advance 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.570
 so actually a very interesting 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.969
 question 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:45.960
 I would say 10 on it 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:48.180
 7 40 is now so at western guitar me 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.739
 say a thin thin one 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.210
 pages I put myself play well ma 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:56.969
 10 to 7 40 resp 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:01:00.149
 I also think I play and think 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.840
 had my velvet my pages set times 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.510
 look at 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.100
 In any case, 11 8 would be 50 sat 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.950
 not so thick now there's a lot 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.420
 Christians have twelve pages for 13 pages 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.299
 you have to have the acoustic guitars already 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.270
 let's see that one died at the neck 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:18.210
 times you have to be so the times 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.979
 Old town would be that here the e 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.170
 guitar but this would be up here 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.509
 or with some acoustic guitars there 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.810
 Below is a quasi this heating rod in it 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:30.570
 for the man or with the man then 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.310
 can readjust the neck if you can 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.829
 will see that relatively quickly if the 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.640
 neck pulls directly or whether the 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:40.259
 side strength or the sides is approaching 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.390
 not yet or not so strong 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.100
 that you now have to work on it 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.590
 can do that yourself it is actually 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.420
 not much to do that 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.890
 there are some people who are 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.600
 maybe artisanal or not 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.180
 quite as talented iGreen else or 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.829
 get the allen key in the most 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:00.299
 The bowl I'm looking for here 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:01.920
 Once , of course, then you know 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.469
 always get out of here so always 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.000
 key is there so it is putting a lot 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.910
 Thinner is also very thick I have yes 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.020
 also here for example here 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.610
 16 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.510
 your set of always break with it 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.980
 you put your 1 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:19.840
 and I would not do it right now 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.060
 let there are some luthier the 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.230
 do that as a service said here 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.330
 can you switch sides and 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:29.170
 it is still a service but 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:30.850
 You can do it all yourself, yes 

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:32.500
 I would not look it directly 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:33.850
 just look at the neck 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.340
 again, if you have her on it 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.600
 shoots and then he sees that as himself 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.340
 then you have to turn it on everyone 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.390
 falling slightly adjust as 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:45.220
 but you can still get acoustic guitars 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.650
 Break a lot so not too much 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:49.060
 turn when it cracks then it is very 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.400
 bad sign that there 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.200
 something perhaps with the guitar of 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.930
 inner something broke broken 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.370
 It's great if you continue to do so 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.140
 Just ask here and ask 

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.850
 write video yes comes on mine 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:02.590
 internet site over there are many 

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.230
 other videos or 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.930
 there you can also have one 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.460
 look around and look at my main 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:12.670
 channel on youtube could of course also 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:14.860
 quite a lot of videos here too 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.940
 then ask questions yes and as I said 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.290
 if you ask like you have 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:21.060
 just write with and the video yes 

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.060
 be honest until next time
