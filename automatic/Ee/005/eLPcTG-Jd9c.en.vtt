00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
however you want I initially wanted to

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:57.500 
however you want I initially wanted to
spell<00:03:54.990> out<00:03:55.140> the<00:03:55.170> word<00:03:55.320> love<00:03:55.920> but<00:03:56.760> my<00:03:56.790> cord<00:03:57.330> was

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
spell out the word love but my cord was

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.150 
spell out the word love but my cord was
not<00:03:57.660> lining<00:03:57.870> out<00:03:58.110> so<00:03:58.290> I<00:03:58.320> decided<00:03:58.650> to<00:03:58.770> make<00:03:58.980> it

00:03:59.150 --> 00:03:59.160 
not lining out so I decided to make it

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.370 
not lining out so I decided to make it
into<00:03:59.400> a<00:03:59.430> heart<00:03:59.940> and<00:04:00.210> I<00:04:00.450> think<00:04:00.750> it<00:04:00.840> still<00:04:01.080> comes

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
into a heart and I think it still comes

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:03.140 
into a heart and I think it still comes
out<00:04:01.530> pretty<00:04:01.710> good<00:04:02.010> you<00:04:02.520> just<00:04:02.700> need<00:04:02.850> a<00:04:02.880> nice

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
out pretty good you just need a nice

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.330 
out pretty good you just need a nice
strong<00:04:03.480> stapler<00:04:03.960> and<00:04:04.140> I<00:04:04.230> have<00:04:04.470> to<00:04:04.710> line

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
strong stapler and I have to line

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:08.150 
strong stapler and I have to line
because<00:04:05.760> mine<00:04:06.090> does<00:04:06.270> not<00:04:06.300> go<00:04:06.630> flat<00:04:07.110> at<00:04:07.800> all

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
because mine does not go flat at all

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.970 
because mine does not go flat at all
it's<00:04:08.580> like<00:04:08.820> this<00:04:08.970> weird<00:04:09.330> curve<00:04:09.930> see<00:04:10.380> it<00:04:10.620> curves

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
it's like this weird curve see it curves

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.350 
it's like this weird curve see it curves
and<00:04:11.370> it<00:04:11.520> doesn't<00:04:11.820> go<00:04:11.880> flat

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 
and it doesn't go flat

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:13.640 
and it doesn't go flat
I<00:04:12.390> don't<00:04:12.570> know<00:04:12.630> what's<00:04:12.810> tapered<00:04:13.200> doesn't<00:04:13.560> do

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:13.340 
continue to do that but I did like when

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:15.070 
continue to do that but I did like when
I<00:06:13.370> put<00:06:13.699> it<00:06:13.789> down<00:06:13.970> though<00:06:14.270> I<00:06:14.479> felt<00:06:14.750> like<00:06:14.930> it

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:15.080 
I put it down though I felt like it

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:17.649 
I put it down though I felt like it
wasn't<00:06:15.229> permanent<00:06:15.710> so<00:06:16.430> I<00:06:16.669> did<00:06:17.120> take<00:06:17.389> some<00:06:17.419> of

00:06:17.649 --> 00:06:17.659 
wasn't permanent so I did take some of

00:06:17.659 --> 00:06:19.420 
wasn't permanent so I did take some of
the<00:06:17.720> glue<00:06:17.840> and<00:06:18.110> I<00:06:18.139> just<00:06:18.379> pushed<00:06:18.650> it<00:06:18.860> around<00:06:19.280> the

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:19.430 
the glue and I just pushed it around the

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:22.119 
the glue and I just pushed it around the
edges<00:06:19.909> to<00:06:19.940> just<00:06:20.389> give<00:06:21.169> a<00:06:21.199> little<00:06:21.319> bit<00:06:21.650> extra<00:06:21.979> of

00:06:22.119 --> 00:06:22.129 
edges to just give a little bit extra of

00:06:22.129 --> 00:06:24.309 
edges to just give a little bit extra of
a<00:06:22.250> stick<00:06:22.550> it<00:06:22.729> took<00:06:22.879> maybe<00:06:23.090> about<00:06:23.419> five<00:06:23.810> minutes

00:06:24.309 --> 00:06:24.319
