00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
roughly three thousand waypoints so it

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.760 
roughly three thousand waypoints so it
might<00:01:41.280> be<00:01:41.340> a<00:01:41.520> little<00:01:41.820> slow<00:01:42.229> you<00:01:43.229> got<00:01:43.560> to<00:01:43.649> let<00:01:43.710> it

might be a little slow you got to let it

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.609 
might be a little slow you got to let it
catch<00:01:44.040> up<00:01:44.310> here<00:01:45.680> so<00:01:46.680> what<00:01:47.220> you<00:01:47.369> want<00:01:47.520> to<00:01:47.610> do<00:01:47.759> is

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
catch up here so what you want to do is

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:53.170 
catch up here so what you want to do is
take<00:01:49.619> a<00:01:49.649> set<00:01:49.950> of<00:01:50.040> waypoints<00:01:51.439> for<00:01:52.439> this<00:01:52.590> file

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:53.180 
take a set of waypoints for this file

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:55.940 
take a set of waypoints for this file
and<00:01:54.180> I'll<00:01:54.479> show<00:01:54.720> you<00:01:54.780> how<00:01:54.960> to<00:01:55.020> do<00:01:55.259> this<00:01:55.409> by<00:01:55.680> leg

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
and I'll show you how to do this by leg

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.069 
and I'll show you how to do this by leg
so<00:01:56.280> eventually<00:01:57.030> you<00:01:57.450> can<00:01:59.149> eventually<00:02:00.149> do<00:02:00.960> them

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
so eventually you can eventually do them

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.440 
so eventually you can eventually do them
all<00:02:01.200> and<00:02:01.469> you<00:02:01.740> shouldn't<00:02:01.979> have<00:02:02.070> any<00:02:02.450> waypoints

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
all and you shouldn't have any waypoints

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.780 
all and you shouldn't have any waypoints
left<00:02:03.719> on<00:02:03.990> this<00:02:04.229> when<00:02:04.409> you're<00:02:04.530> done<00:02:04.740> one<00:02:05.610> thing

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
left on this when you're done one thing

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:06.859 
left on this when you're done one thing
I<00:02:05.880> want<00:02:06.000> to<00:02:06.060> show<00:02:06.210> you<00:02:06.270> real<00:02:06.420> quick<00:02:06.630> while<00:02:06.810> I'm

the numbers I have in format that's

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.850 
the numbers I have in format that's
compatible<00:02:11.700> to<00:02:12.090> what<00:02:12.120> GPS<00:02:13.110> is<00:02:13.349> used

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
compatible to what GPS is used

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.040 
compatible to what GPS is used
the<00:02:14.460> way<00:02:14.610> you<00:02:14.670> do<00:02:14.970> that<00:02:15.210> is<00:02:15.630> go<00:02:15.900> to<00:02:15.960> tools

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
the way you do that is go to tools

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.850 
the way you do that is go to tools
options<00:02:17.360> and<00:02:18.360> then<00:02:19.350> you're<00:02:19.440> going<00:02:19.590> to<00:02:19.650> see

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
options and then you're going to see

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.190 
options and then you're going to see
degrees<00:02:20.400> decimal<00:02:21.000> and<00:02:21.120> minutes<00:02:21.450> make<00:02:22.050> sure

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
degrees decimal and minutes make sure

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.630 
degrees decimal and minutes make sure
you<00:02:22.290> have<00:02:22.440> that<00:02:22.590> check<00:02:22.920> mark<00:02:23.190> and<00:02:23.280> just<00:02:23.490> hit

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
you have that check mark and just hit

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:29.590 
you have that check mark and just hit
apply<00:02:23.880> and<00:02:25.640> okay<00:02:26.690> so<00:02:27.690> I'm<00:02:27.810> gonna<00:02:27.930> zoom<00:02:28.020> in

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
apply and okay so I'm gonna zoom in

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.490 
apply and okay so I'm gonna zoom in
taking<00:02:30.600> a<00:02:30.630> little<00:02:30.780> bit<00:02:30.930> of<00:02:31.020> time<00:02:31.200> still

to go to these waypoints and I'm going

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:46.699 
to go to these waypoints and I'm going
to<00:03:42.239> show<00:03:42.390> the<00:03:42.510> first<00:03:42.690> couple<00:03:43.050> numbers<00:03:43.500> just<00:03:45.709> so

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
to show the first couple numbers just so

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:48.440 
to show the first couple numbers just so
we<00:03:46.800> can<00:03:46.920> reference<00:03:47.100> these<00:03:47.370> so<00:03:48.030> the<00:03:48.270> first

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
we can reference these so the first

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.000 
we can reference these so the first
thing<00:03:48.600> I<00:03:48.660> want<00:03:48.810> to<00:03:48.840> do<00:03:49.020> is<00:03:49.440> I<00:03:49.650> want<00:03:49.800> to<00:03:49.830> go<00:03:49.950> ahead

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
thing I want to do is I want to go ahead

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.210 
thing I want to do is I want to go ahead
and<00:03:50.130> organize<00:03:50.400> the<00:03:50.910> latitude<00:03:51.540> and<00:03:52.100> what<00:03:53.100> this

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
and organize the latitude and what this

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.190 
and organize the latitude and what this
is<00:03:53.400> going<00:03:53.580> to<00:03:53.640> do<00:03:53.820> is<00:03:54.180> put<00:03:54.540> it<00:03:54.630> in<00:03:54.720> order<00:03:54.900> from

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
is going to do is put it in order from

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.470 
is going to do is put it in order from
least<00:03:55.500> to<00:03:55.709> greatest<00:03:55.800> and<00:03:56.370> so<00:03:56.610> the<00:03:57.060> numbers<00:03:57.360> I

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
least to greatest and so the numbers I

00:03:57.480 --> 00:03:59.060 
least to greatest and so the numbers I
wrote<00:03:57.660> down<00:03:57.900> I'm<00:03:58.290> looking<00:03:58.530> for<00:03:58.890> everything

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070 
wrote down I'm looking for everything

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:04.210 
wrote down I'm looking for everything
between<00:03:59.640> 33<00:04:00.209> 44<00:04:01.700> so<00:04:02.700> we<00:04:02.790> go<00:04:02.940> down<00:04:03.120> here<00:04:03.200> between

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
between 33 44 so we go down here between

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:12.590 
between 33 44 so we go down here between
33<00:04:05.360> 44<00:04:06.380> and<00:04:08.300> I<00:04:09.300> missed<00:04:10.080> it<00:04:10.290> 33<00:04:10.920> 44<00:04:11.480> select<00:04:12.480> the

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
33 44 and I missed it 33 44 select the

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:21.950 
33 44 and I missed it 33 44 select the
first<00:04:12.810> one<00:04:12.989> and<00:04:14.570> between<00:04:17.540> 82<00:04:18.540> and<00:04:20.209> well<00:04:21.209> no<00:04:21.600> 33

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:21.960 
first one and between 82 and well no 33

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:24.740

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:24.750 
44 and 34 35 that's why you write this

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:27.000 
44 and 34 35 that's why you write this
down<00:04:24.960> so<00:04:25.550> 34

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
down so 34

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:33.550 
35 looking for 35 34 35 and going get

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:37.490 
35 looking for 35 34 35 and going get
all<00:04:33.640> the<00:04:33.760> 35<00:04:34.440> now<00:04:35.440> hold<00:04:35.800> down<00:04:35.860> shift<00:04:36.310> select

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
all the 35 now hold down shift select

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:42.750 
all the 35 now hold down shift select
that<00:04:38.500> I<00:04:38.830> want<00:04:39.580> to<00:04:39.640> copy<00:04:41.220> then<00:04:42.220> I<00:04:42.310> want<00:04:42.460> to<00:04:42.520> paste

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:42.760 
that I want to copy then I want to paste

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.200 
that I want to copy then I want to paste
them<00:04:44.220> all<00:04:45.220> right<00:04:45.310> so<00:04:45.520> here<00:04:45.700> we<00:04:45.730> have<00:04:45.970> all<00:04:46.180> the

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210 
them all right so here we have all the

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.170 
them all right so here we have all the
waypoints<00:04:46.420> in<00:04:47.350> the<00:04:47.530> new<00:04:47.650> file<00:04:47.950> now<00:04:48.580> these<00:04:48.910> are

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180 
waypoints in the new file now these are

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:52.440 
waypoints in the new file now these are
just<00:04:49.210> between<00:04:49.810> the<00:04:50.020> latitude<00:04:50.790> ranges<00:04:51.790> so<00:04:52.390> you

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:52.450 
just between the latitude ranges so you

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:54.390 
just between the latitude ranges so you
still<00:04:52.960> have<00:04:53.110> a<00:04:53.140> master<00:04:53.680> in<00:04:53.710> this<00:04:53.920> that's<00:04:54.220> why<00:04:54.370> I

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400 
still have a master in this that's why I

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.370 
still have a master in this that's why I
encourage<00:04:54.700> is<00:04:54.940> copy<00:04:55.270> and<00:04:55.420> paste<00:04:55.810> and<00:04:56.050> keeping

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:56.380 
encourage is copy and paste and keeping

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:58.440 
encourage is copy and paste and keeping
your<00:04:56.500> master<00:04:56.890> untouched<00:04:57.460> and<00:04:57.790> just

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:58.450 
your master untouched and just

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:00.420 
your master untouched and just
duplicating<00:04:59.140> it<00:04:59.260> in<00:04:59.380> other<00:04:59.620> files<00:05:00.040> and<00:05:00.370> you

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.430 
duplicating it in other files and you

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:02.420 
duplicating it in other files and you
can<00:05:00.460> always<00:05:00.700> double<00:05:00.970> check<00:05:01.150> in<00:05:01.510> Google<00:05:01.840> Earth

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
can always double check in Google Earth

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.760 
can always double check in Google Earth
those<00:05:03.430> waypoints<00:05:04.030> as<00:05:04.120> well<00:05:04.390> so<00:05:04.960> go<00:05:05.260> to<00:05:05.320> your

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 
those waypoints as well so go to your

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:07.830 
those waypoints as well so go to your
longitude<00:05:06.100> now<00:05:06.730> and<00:05:07.090> do<00:05:07.180> the<00:05:07.210> same<00:05:07.510> thing<00:05:07.750> you

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 
longitude now and do the same thing you

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:09.930 
longitude now and do the same thing you
did<00:05:07.990> with<00:05:08.110> your<00:05:08.200> latitude<00:05:08.620> is<00:05:08.980> you<00:05:09.520> organize

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:09.940 
did with your latitude is you organize

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:13.260 
did with your latitude is you organize
these<00:05:10.270> and<00:05:10.770> then<00:05:11.770> at<00:05:11.980> this<00:05:12.160> point<00:05:12.460> you<00:05:12.850> want

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:13.270 
these and then at this point you want

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:19.140 
these and then at this point you want
everything<00:05:13.960> between<00:05:15.060> 80<00:05:16.230> 52<00:05:17.230> and<00:05:17.530> 82<00:05:17.950> 11<00:05:18.430> so

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:19.150 
everything between 80 52 and 82 11 so

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:24.090 
everything between 80 52 and 82 11 so
8050<00:05:19.930> -<00:05:20.260> that's<00:05:20.770> good<00:05:21.010> and<00:05:21.690> 82<00:05:22.830> 11<00:05:23.830> now<00:05:23.950> what

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:24.100 
8050 - that's good and 82 11 now what

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:25.590 
8050 - that's good and 82 11 now what
you're<00:05:24.220> going<00:05:24.310> to<00:05:24.370> see<00:05:24.580> here's<00:05:25.180> an<00:05:25.300> example

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:25.600 
you're going to see here's an example

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.710 
you're going to see here's an example
then<00:05:26.410> you<00:05:26.530> have<00:05:26.650> stuff<00:05:26.950> in<00:05:27.100> the<00:05:27.190> same<00:05:27.720> northern

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:28.720 
then you have stuff in the same northern

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.900 
then you have stuff in the same northern
reference<00:05:29.320> but<00:05:29.860> they're<00:05:30.070> not<00:05:30.280> in<00:05:30.610> the<00:05:30.640> same

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:30.910 
reference but they're not in the same

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:33.390 
reference but they're not in the same
westerly<00:05:31.600> reference<00:05:32.080> so<00:05:32.740> everything<00:05:33.160> outside

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:33.400 
westerly reference so everything outside

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:38.190 
westerly reference so everything outside
of<00:05:34.120> 82<00:05:34.630> 11<00:05:35.140> is<00:05:35.700> no<00:05:36.700> good<00:05:36.970> now<00:05:37.570> before<00:05:38.170> doing

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:38.200 
of 82 11 is no good now before doing

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.200 
of 82 11 is no good now before doing
this<00:05:38.710> you<00:05:39.100> want<00:05:39.220> to<00:05:39.310> make<00:05:39.460> sure<00:05:39.490> you<00:05:39.850> still<00:05:40.060> got

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:40.210 
this you want to make sure you still got

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:41.790 
this you want to make sure you still got
these<00:05:40.360> waypoints<00:05:40.540> but<00:05:41.050> I<00:05:41.080> know<00:05:41.170> I<00:05:41.290> have<00:05:41.620> them

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:41.800 
these waypoints but I know I have them

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.240 
these waypoints but I know I have them
so<00:05:42.550> this<00:05:42.970> is<00:05:43.030> just<00:05:43.360> a<00:05:43.510> copy<00:05:43.720> so<00:05:44.500> on<00:05:44.680> this<00:05:44.920> file

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:45.250 
so this is just a copy so on this file

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:48.330 
so this is just a copy so on this file
I'm<00:05:46.000> going<00:05:46.090> to<00:05:46.270> delete<00:05:46.600> everything<00:05:47.340> outside

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:48.340 
I'm going to delete everything outside

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:52.560 
I'm going to delete everything outside
of<00:05:49.060> that<00:05:49.150> longitude<00:05:50.580> for<00:05:51.580> this<00:05:51.790> file<00:05:52.030> and<00:05:52.330> now

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:52.570 
of that longitude for this file and now

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:56.760 
of that longitude for this file and now
I<00:05:52.600> know<00:05:52.810> the<00:05:53.380> only<00:05:54.040> thing<00:05:54.310> left<00:05:54.910> is<00:05:55.770> just

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:56.770 
I know the only thing left is just

00:05:56.770 --> 00:05:58.800 
I know the only thing left is just
things<00:05:57.010> for<00:05:57.220> like<00:05:57.340> Murray<00:05:57.640> so<00:05:58.390> that's<00:05:58.600> how<00:05:58.750> you

00:05:58.800 --> 00:05:58.810 
things for like Murray so that's how you

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:01.740 
things for like Murray so that's how you
do<00:05:59.050> that<00:05:59.230> that's<00:05:59.860> how<00:06:00.070> you<00:06:00.100> make<00:06:00.340> a<00:06:00.370> lake<00:06:00.750> file

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:01.750 
do that that's how you make a lake file

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:03.720 
do that that's how you make a lake file
and<00:06:02.050> so<00:06:02.620> there's<00:06:02.800> my<00:06:02.980> like<00:06:03.190> so<00:06:03.400> you<00:06:03.490> can<00:06:03.610> go

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:03.730 
and so there's my like so you can go

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:05.580 
and so there's my like so you can go
back<00:06:03.940> and<00:06:04.120> do<00:06:04.240> every<00:06:04.570> lake<00:06:04.780> after<00:06:05.050> that<00:06:05.350> and<00:06:05.500> if

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:05.590 
back and do every lake after that and if

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:07.260 
back and do every lake after that and if
you<00:06:05.680> want<00:06:05.710> to<00:06:05.950> double-check<00:06:06.220> it<00:06:06.580> is<00:06:06.730> just<00:06:07.090> go

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:07.270 
you want to double-check it is just go

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:09.630 
you want to double-check it is just go
to<00:06:07.330> your<00:06:07.480> Google<00:06:07.810> Earth<00:06:08.080> and<00:06:08.380> bring<00:06:09.280> this<00:06:09.430> up

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:09.640 
to your Google Earth and bring this up

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.720 
to your Google Earth and bring this up
