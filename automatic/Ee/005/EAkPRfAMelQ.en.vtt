00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.700
 welcome people who are not 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.100
 home 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.390
 today we will learn a simple circuit 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.760
 to regulate the speed of a motor 

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:47.910
 motorcycle down with just one 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.580
 potentiometer for this we will need 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.820
 of a food here in case I go 

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:57.390
 use four aaa batteries totaling 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:00.120
 Six other using a potent yesterday 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:04.440
 punishments value should vary from one 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:07.950
 car up to 15k so you get one 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:11.039
 very sensitive setting if you use 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.899
 more if 15k as soon as you become a 

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:16.110
 little potential crash the driver 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:18.630
 it will tire to generate enough first step 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.850
 Let's get the potential yesterday and let's go 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.539
 fix it anywhere in the 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.539
 practice the board 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:31.020
 Let's connect positive from our stack or 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.950
 our battery in the middle pin of the 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.950
 potential yesterday 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.930
 let's choose any aquino from 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.210
 potential yesterday and let's get the positive 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:51.280
 of our engine 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.280
 I'll get the pin on the right side here. 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:03.369
 now let's connect negative battery 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:06.229
 on any track 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:09.340
 same track we will connect the 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:09.340
 engine negative 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.760
 I'm going to connect here at the tip of the 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:22.670
 engine a kind of propeller for you 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:25.340
 watch the engine by turning a rubber 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.269
 that with a chopstick crossed in the middle 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.459
 her 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:30.700
 I will start here to decrease the 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:30.700
 resistance 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.660
 as the resistance decreases 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:44.060
 starts to pass more current 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:49.000
 watch rotating here and sturdy is 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:49.000
 lowering began to turn 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:57.850
 as the least resistance more 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.850
 current passing and faster than a motor 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:07.780
 we will observe the electronic scheme of 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:11.440
 how it was made is that the 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:14.290
 here use a 9-volt battery 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:17.239
 power and an engine 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:21.790
 Let's get the positive out of our battery. 

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:21.790
 in the middle of potential yesterday 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:34.410
 Let's choose any corner of the 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:36.920
 potentiated another and we'll call and a pin 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.920
 of the engine 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:45.050
 Let's get the last engine 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:47.310
 Let's connect to the negative of our battery. 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:48.420
 thus completing our circuit 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.550
 electronic 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.710
 If you liked the video, I like it. 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:53.850
 the first video of the channel you 

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:55.770
 is watching 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:58.320
 write to keep track of all the 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:59.610
 news visit a friend's channel 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:03.450
 Luis Torres 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:05.310
 just click on his photo is a 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.440
 pleasure sharing knowledge with 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:12.710
 you 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:12.710
 hugs get well
