00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
cut out there is two pieces here which

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.190 
cut out there is two pieces here which
will<00:01:04.830> explain<00:01:05.339> but<00:01:06.030> I<00:01:06.090> first<00:01:06.390> off<00:01:06.600> as<00:01:06.960> you<00:01:07.110> can

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
will explain but I first off as you can

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.719 
will explain but I first off as you can
see<00:01:07.380> here<00:01:07.590> I<00:01:07.619> mean<00:01:07.770> this<00:01:07.890> isn't<00:01:08.070> a<00:01:08.250> hundred

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
see here I mean this isn't a hundred

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.359 
see here I mean this isn't a hundred
percent<00:01:09.439> accurate<00:01:10.439> as<00:01:10.560> far<00:01:10.799> as<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.040> cut<00:01:11.220> out

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
percent accurate as far as the cut out

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.550 
percent accurate as far as the cut out
but<00:01:11.520> it's<00:01:11.670> pretty<00:01:12.000> close<00:01:12.260> over<00:01:13.260> here<00:01:13.290> the

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
but it's pretty close over here the

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.830 
but it's pretty close over here the
cutouts<00:01:13.920> are<00:01:14.159> perfect<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.090> then<00:01:15.570> down<00:01:15.810> below

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
cutouts are perfect and then down below

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.350 
cutouts are perfect and then down below
we<00:01:16.350> have<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.830> you<00:01:17.610> know<00:01:17.700> that<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.030> cutouts

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
we have the you know that the cutouts

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.820 
we have the you know that the cutouts
here<00:01:18.630> and<00:01:18.780> then<00:01:18.869> obviously<00:01:19.020> you<00:01:19.320> can<00:01:19.439> see<00:01:19.650> it's

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
here and then obviously you can see it's

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.520 
here and then obviously you can see it's
just<00:01:20.189> a<00:01:20.400> thin<00:01:21.210> I<00:01:21.540> mean<00:01:21.900> adds<00:01:22.110> a<00:01:22.170> little<00:01:22.290> bit<00:01:22.439> of

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
just a thin I mean adds a little bit of

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.219 
just a thin I mean adds a little bit of
thickness<00:01:22.770> obviously<00:01:23.640> but<00:01:24.360> not<00:01:24.659> a<00:01:24.689> lot<00:01:24.810> and

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
thickness obviously but not a lot and

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.160 
thickness obviously but not a lot and
then<00:01:25.770> you<00:01:26.729> get<00:01:26.820> your<00:01:26.850> microphone<00:01:27.689> pinholes

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
then you get your microphone pinholes

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.170 
then you get your microphone pinholes

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
it works it's very very simple you just

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.240 
it works it's very very simple you just
slide<00:01:47.130> off<00:01:47.159> the<00:01:47.340> individual<00:01:48.149> pieces<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:49.250> you

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
slide off the individual pieces and you

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.910 
slide off the individual pieces and you
are<00:01:50.399> good<00:01:50.579> to<00:01:50.610> go<00:01:50.729> so<00:01:51.270> slide<00:01:52.049> it<00:01:52.200> off<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:52.649> there

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
are good to go so slide it off and there

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.740 
are good to go so slide it off and there
you<00:01:53.009> have<00:01:53.070> it<00:01:53.220> again<00:01:53.880> here<00:01:54.090> there's<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.390> Nexus

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
you have it again here there's the Nexus

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.740 
you have it again here there's the Nexus
7<00:01:55.079> and<00:01:55.259> a<00:01:55.350> lot<00:01:55.770> of<00:01:55.799> cases<00:01:56.119> you<00:01:57.119> know<00:01:57.240> or<00:01:57.540> a<00:01:57.570> lot

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
7 and a lot of cases you know or a lot

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.300 
7 and a lot of cases you know or a lot
of<00:01:57.840> tablets<00:01:58.200> get<00:01:58.380> scratched<00:01:58.710> on<00:01:58.890> the<00:01:58.950> back<00:01:59.100> so

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
of tablets get scratched on the back so

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.670 
of tablets get scratched on the back so
having<00:01:59.549> a<00:01:59.610> good<00:01:59.820> case<00:02:00.060> that's<00:02:00.360> lightweight

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
having a good case that's lightweight

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.569 
having a good case that's lightweight
something<00:02:01.680> I'm<00:02:01.770> sure<00:02:01.920> a<00:02:01.950> lot<00:02:02.009> of<00:02:02.159> people<00:02:02.280> are

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
something I'm sure a lot of people are

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.539 
something I'm sure a lot of people are
interested<00:02:03.060> in<00:02:03.210> so<00:02:03.509> set<00:02:04.140> that<00:02:04.320> aside<00:02:04.439> and<00:02:04.950> let

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
interested in so set that aside and let

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.389 
interested in so set that aside and let
you<00:02:05.700> see<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.719> actual<00:02:06.960> two-piece<00:02:07.500> design<00:02:07.710> here

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
you see the actual two-piece design here

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:11.089 
you see the actual two-piece design here
and<00:02:09.300> it<00:02:09.420> just<00:02:09.450> simply<00:02:09.780> snaps<00:02:10.259> together<00:02:10.470> very

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
and it just simply snaps together very

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.780 
and it just simply snaps together very
nice<00:02:11.340> it's<00:02:11.610> very<00:02:11.670> lightweight

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
nice it's very lightweight

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:18.630 
nice it's very lightweight
so<00:02:13.239> as<00:02:13.980> you<00:02:14.980> can<00:02:15.250> see<00:02:15.780> it's<00:02:16.780> super<00:02:17.140> thin<00:02:17.439> I<00:02:17.640> mean

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
so as you can see it's super thin I mean

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.729 
so as you can see it's super thin I mean
really<00:02:18.879> thin<00:02:19.269> obviously<00:02:20.109> the<00:02:20.200> corners<00:02:20.530> have<00:02:20.709> a

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
really thin obviously the corners have a

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:22.530 
really thin obviously the corners have a
little<00:02:20.920> bit<00:02:21.040> of<00:02:21.069> a<00:02:21.189> reinforcement<00:02:21.819> to<00:02:22.209> help

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
little bit of a reinforcement to help

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.209 
little bit of a reinforcement to help
you<00:02:22.810> know<00:02:22.900> protect<00:02:23.260> the<00:02:23.349> device<00:02:23.620> if<00:02:23.859> it<00:02:23.980> drops

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:24.219 
you know protect the device if it drops

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:26.369 
you know protect the device if it drops
or<00:02:24.489> Falls<00:02:24.760> and<00:02:25.209> then<00:02:25.480> the<00:02:25.569> corners<00:02:25.870> up<00:02:26.019> here<00:02:26.260> as

00:02:26.369 --> 00:02:26.379 
or Falls and then the corners up here as

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:29.869 
or Falls and then the corners up here as
well<00:02:26.560> are<00:02:26.980> going<00:02:27.519> to<00:02:27.579> be<00:02:27.790> a<00:02:28.000> little<00:02:28.569> more<00:02:28.719> no

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:29.879 
well are going to be a little more no

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:32.460 
well are going to be a little more no
strengthen<00:02:30.879> so<00:02:31.180> it<00:02:31.209> does<00:02:31.870> have<00:02:32.019> this<00:02:32.170> soft

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
strengthen so it does have this soft

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.229 
strengthen so it does have this soft
coating<00:02:33.000> my<00:02:34.000> microfiber<00:02:34.629> or<00:02:34.900> vinyl<00:02:35.819> no<00:02:36.819> cloth

be concerned of sliding the tablet in
the<00:02:49.239> corners<00:02:49.599> might<00:02:50.319> get<00:02:50.500> scratched<00:02:50.919> I<00:02:51.129> mean

again this is the 10th era Nexus 7
eco-friendly<00:03:11.560> bamboo<00:03:11.950> case<00:03:12.459> so<00:03:13.120> you<00:03:13.150> nicely

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
eco-friendly bamboo case so you nicely

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:15.210 
eco-friendly bamboo case so you nicely
slide<00:03:13.930> it<00:03:14.079> in<00:03:14.169> there<00:03:14.200> it<00:03:14.470> goes<00:03:14.620> in<00:03:14.769> quite<00:03:14.980> easy

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
slide it in there it goes in quite easy

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:17.219 
slide it in there it goes in quite easy
if<00:03:15.519> you<00:03:15.939> like<00:03:16.150> maybe<00:03:16.419> stop<00:03:16.750> before<00:03:16.930> you<00:03:17.079> get

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:17.229 
if you like maybe stop before you get

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:19.110 
if you like maybe stop before you get
all<00:03:17.349> the<00:03:17.470> way<00:03:17.620> and<00:03:17.889> then<00:03:18.549> you<00:03:18.699> just<00:03:18.879> simply

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:19.120 
all the way and then you just simply

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.210 
all the way and then you just simply
slide<00:03:19.479> the<00:03:19.510> bottom<00:03:19.930> on<00:03:20.049> as<00:03:20.229> well<00:03:20.440> and<00:03:20.769> the<00:03:21.129> way

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
slide the bottom on as well and the way

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.240 
slide the bottom on as well and the way
it<00:03:21.340> works<00:03:21.549> is<00:03:21.760> with<00:03:21.940> pressure<00:03:22.750> or<00:03:23.079> friction<00:03:23.440> so

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
it works is with pressure or friction so

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:26.399 
it works is with pressure or friction so
just<00:03:24.400> maybe<00:03:24.579> push<00:03:24.790> down<00:03:24.970> right<00:03:25.150> here<00:03:25.449> and<00:03:25.479> snap

00:03:26.399 --> 00:03:26.409 
just maybe push down right here and snap

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:28.949 
just maybe push down right here and snap
it<00:03:26.440> on<00:03:26.739> and<00:03:27.040> then<00:03:27.220> there<00:03:27.609> you<00:03:28.209> have<00:03:28.540> it<00:03:28.569> a

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:28.959 
it on and then there you have it a

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.949 
it on and then there you have it a
beautiful<00:03:29.590> elegant<00:03:30.220> and<00:03:30.340> classy<00:03:30.909> case<00:03:31.180> that

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
beautiful elegant and classy case that
