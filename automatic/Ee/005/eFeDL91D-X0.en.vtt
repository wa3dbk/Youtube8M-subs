00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.849
 This offer reason for this are here as I mean 

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:14.019
 the Department of Arts ski resort USA generally one 

00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:17.429
 undecided 

00:00:17.429 --> 00:00:20.589
 earlier one 

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:22.949
 how to master 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:23.840
 that's about it 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.239
 Smith my 

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:27.280
 next to Verdi I would also see more 

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.399
 next race 

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:30.430
 although one of the 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:31.729
 these partners 

00:00:31.729 --> 00:00:34.340
 and even now could be with loop 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.080
 this is our second gameplay 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.080
 you see country 16 I think it's not bad 

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:44.550
 pretty good 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:45.870
 and now yes 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.970
 in Churchill the Strangers 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:50.970
 Moritz Bleibtreu 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.339
 who hurt a bit 

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:54.970
 he has the Kommerner 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.480
 Lunn evaluated from sealed off 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.480
 Guardiola is everything 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.020
 Musical the younger Chambers already struck 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.610
 our strengths 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:20.980
 - to master everything 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.030
 I want it to be super g 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.460
 the dutchman to commute you will still have a gameplay scenes 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.720
 from TeamViewer and the excuse for the send her disturb I am there 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.190
 on the bar can be twice 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:36.090
 so explained 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.090
 that he has online gameplay with two others we still played 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.840
 We mastered this very well 25 times online view value 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:52.210
 In the last few carpet RP traffic is not more time and more on me 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.210
 alone 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.690
 but we have it in business June 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.780
 two not so easy 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:04.950
 for me 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.950
 I have Georg v 

00:02:16.179 --> 00:02:19.179
 every participant must 

00:02:22.179 --> 00:02:23.819
 do you have that unfortunately 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:28.379
 Unfortunately, so Seier and users are a pretty well done everything pretty well 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:31.379
 Ines Dirscherl it undignified with the changing table value 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:38.469
 what is who does not want to stand in the way that we see the same 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:42.799
 King Albert would have 

00:02:55.099 --> 00:02:57.749
 It is not difficult to find out here 

00:02:57.749 --> 00:03:01.119
 one should then connect the ingenuity itself to the horse afterwards 

00:03:01.119 --> 00:03:03.829
 usually modest 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:05.729
 Joslyn 

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:07.739
 quite a bit hurt 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:10.919
 No here in principle 

00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:13.459
 You should not stop film too long 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:16.459
 Loser of the Celle old town 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.409
 Münster - learn 

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:28.950
 while lower the course, much more money can be equal in all 

00:03:28.949 --> 00:03:31.949
 come the lime tree at this time 

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:37.309
 Example strength that we will come so far says 

00:03:38.649 --> 00:03:41.559
 that's why I have no text on it 

00:03:41.559 --> 00:03:43.799
 then take a stroll 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:46.579
 What is going to happen now? 

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:49.579
 I think so 

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:57.049
 medical cases 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:00.249
 that he will play this as fast as possible Lytham &amp; St 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:04.339
 under German works 

00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:07.549
 and that he is not easy for me now 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:10.549
 really every last time against Bayern 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:17.529
 and so the authorities 

00:04:17.529 --> 00:04:20.319
 the rest is playing Cologne 

00:04:20.319 --> 00:04:23.889
 On the opposite wall is the 16 that is already Arrest Sasha 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:24.599
 Kempf 

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:25.740
 if here 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.740
 there already the players again profit 

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:40.159
 we are working this city is super for 2 

00:04:41.879 --> 00:04:44.389
 and here, however, let up again 

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:46.759
 Schellenberg moves with him 

00:04:46.759 --> 00:04:49.039
 could not you have listened to me 

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:50.550
 I want to continue again 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.550
 under Löw harvest server 

00:04:54.529 --> 00:04:57.529
 yes so I'm here for free now 

00:04:58.159 --> 00:05:00.400
 same back first 

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.680
 then swing over it again 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.339
 So I'll be the 70s vote 

00:05:05.339 --> 00:05:06.979
 because here 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:09.979
 many zombies are coming 

00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:14.319
 he will die 

00:05:14.319 --> 00:05:17.120
 still not lift 

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.120
 I'll revive him now Aires died 

00:05:21.559 --> 00:05:24.559
 he is natural 

00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:29.870
 7 

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:33.380
 so is the medium-sized company of the Munich BMW m 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:36.380
 Piel style Schlepperei and so Lechleiter it is pretty 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:40.820
 Jack Nicholson was especially fond of Gallinger at the end of March 

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:43.820
 Ship models of other smartphones 

00:05:46.969 --> 00:05:49.249
 I now have the media reports book 

00:05:49.249 --> 00:05:51.089
 the del met after a ca 

00:05:51.089 --> 00:05:54.089
 Yes exactly 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:00.210
 now goes said making holes 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:06.150
 he shoots another man 

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:09.669
 first data ten people 

00:06:15.919 --> 00:06:19.050
 and here I have a short break that will of course make me beat faster 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:21.270
 you would do that 

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:24.270
 not primary children 

00:06:29.409 --> 00:06:32.139
 and here are the songs 

00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:35.259
 that's one 

00:06:35.259 --> 00:06:37.849
 Pinky prices I think 

00:06:37.849 --> 00:06:40.020
 learned hard 

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:43.979
 where the local semperit l made i do not remember exactly here 

00:06:43.979 --> 00:06:45.860
 it is pretty Andreessen 

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:47.639
 No 

00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:50.639
 Everyone needs breaks 

00:06:51.199 --> 00:06:53.389
 Here are the forehead 

00:06:53.389 --> 00:06:54.469
 so must eg 

00:06:54.469 --> 00:06:57.889
 Roderich one of us as a support 

00:06:57.889 --> 00:07:00.509
 because in a Munich court 

00:07:00.509 --> 00:07:02.070
 I'll send you the - Mr 

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:03.319

00:07:03.319 --> 00:07:06.319
 and says it's going to be clear in Cabinda 

00:07:09.229 --> 00:07:12.229
 be that Massa 

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:15.849
 Origin weeks points 

00:07:15.849 --> 00:07:17.110
 theatre 

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:19.439
 of course immediately 

00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:20.849
 around 

00:07:20.849 --> 00:07:23.849
 Riquelme works on this 

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:50.889
 and here's Holger Wunderlich too 

00:07:50.889 --> 00:07:53.889
 Unfortunately Kessler could not jump 

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:56.869
 are planned 

00:07:56.869 --> 00:07:58.949
 they left can No the world will stand
