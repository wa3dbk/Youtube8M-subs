00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
code obviously because it's been used

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:13.340 
code obviously because it's been used

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
picture is quite weird because in the

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.520 
picture is quite weird because in the

program<00:03:37.680> in<00:03:38.220> the<00:03:38.459> end<00:03:39.500> but<00:03:41.780> obviously<00:03:42.780> this<00:03:43.109> is

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.410 
program in the end but obviously this is

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.000 
program in the end but obviously this is
kept<00:03:43.680> on<00:03:43.829> the<00:03:43.890> coin<00:03:44.190> to<00:03:44.519> make<00:03:44.670> them<00:03:44.820> markable

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
kept on the coin to make them markable

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.120 
kept on the coin to make them markable
side<00:03:47.010> okay<00:03:47.459> so<00:03:47.880> it's<00:03:48.060> got<00:03:48.239> the<00:03:48.359> skyline<00:03:48.840> the

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130 
side okay so it's got the skyline the

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:53.270 
side okay so it's got the skyline the
cloud<00:03:50.130> line<00:03:50.459> up<00:03:51.440> see<00:03:52.440> your<00:03:52.590> egg<00:03:52.709> on<00:03:52.890> the<00:03:53.040> train

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:53.280 
cloud line up see your egg on the train

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.720 
cloud line up see your egg on the train
line<00:03:53.430> them<00:03:53.670> so<00:03:54.269> anyway<00:03:55.049> so<00:03:55.140> that's<00:03:55.350> it<00:03:55.620> for<00:03:55.859> the

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
line them so anyway so that's it for the

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.849 
line them so anyway so that's it for the
coin<00:03:56.970> and<00:03:57.239> it<00:03:57.630> just<00:03:57.870> says<00:03:58.079> verizon

00:03:58.849 --> 00:03:58.859
