00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
find a silver safety lock you need to

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.360 
find a silver safety lock you need to
lift<00:00:53.640> that<00:00:53.850> up<00:00:54.110> now<00:00:55.110> both<00:00:55.379> channels<00:00:55.770> are<00:00:56.160> self

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
lift that up now both channels are self

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.040 
lift that up now both channels are self
locking<00:00:56.670> so<00:00:57.059> you<00:00:57.120> need<00:00:57.359> to<00:00:57.510> hold<00:00:57.780> both
