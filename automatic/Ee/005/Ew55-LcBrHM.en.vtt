exactly<00:00:44.000> yes<00:00:45.000> a<00:00:45.059> good<00:00:45.360> example<00:00:45.840> yeah<00:00:46.350> yes<00:00:46.829> a

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
exactly yes a good example yeah yes a

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.799 
exactly yes a good example yeah yes a
very<00:00:47.489> good<00:00:47.640> example<00:00:48.270> that<00:00:48.300> shows<00:00:48.629> exactly

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
very good example that shows exactly

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:51.830 
very good example that shows exactly
where<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.379> heart<00:00:49.590> is<00:00:49.789> above<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:51.270> elbow<00:00:51.629> in
