00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
don't feel a thing it is virtually

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.060 
don't feel a thing it is virtually
painless<00:00:39.969> without<00:00:40.690> sensation<00:00:41.379> but<00:00:41.920> they

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:42.070 
painless without sensation but they

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.459 
painless without sensation but they
certainly<00:00:42.309> can<00:00:42.719> extract<00:00:43.719> their<00:00:44.020> pound<00:00:44.260> of

00:00:44.459 --> 00:00:44.469 
certainly can extract their pound of

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:46.380 
certainly can extract their pound of
flesh<00:00:44.530> as<00:00:44.980> it<00:00:45.219> were<00:00:45.370> let's<00:00:45.850> take<00:00:46.030> a<00:00:46.059> look<00:00:46.270> at

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 
flesh as it were let's take a look at

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.810 
flesh as it were let's take a look at
bedbugs<00:00:46.870> feeding<00:00:47.320> it<00:00:47.949> doesn't<00:00:48.340> take<00:00:48.520> long<00:00:48.550> for

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:48.820 
bedbugs feeding it doesn't take long for

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.349 
bedbugs feeding it doesn't take long for
the<00:00:49.180> bed<00:00:49.210> bug<00:00:49.690> to<00:00:49.899> decide<00:00:50.289> this<00:00:51.250> is<00:00:51.609> a<00:00:51.879> feasible

00:00:52.349 --> 00:00:52.359 
the bed bug to decide this is a feasible

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:56.340 
the bed bug to decide this is a feasible
moment<00:00:53.940> bedbug<00:00:54.940> inserts<00:00:55.449> its<00:00:55.660> mouth<00:00:55.899> parts

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350 
moment bedbug inserts its mouth parts

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.279 
moment bedbug inserts its mouth parts
without<00:00:56.500> sensation<00:00:57.570> you<00:00:58.570> don't<00:00:58.780> feel<00:00:59.079> a<00:00:59.109> thing

00:00:59.279 --> 00:00:59.289 
without sensation you don't feel a thing

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:02.099 
without sensation you don't feel a thing
so<00:01:00.219> when<00:01:00.399> you're<00:01:00.519> sleeping<00:01:00.969> nobody<00:01:01.570> wakes<00:01:01.840> up

00:01:02.099 --> 00:01:02.109 
so when you're sleeping nobody wakes up

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:04.920 
so when you're sleeping nobody wakes up
perhaps<00:01:03.100> we<00:01:03.340> can<00:01:03.489> see<00:01:03.730> as<00:01:04.059> the<00:01:04.269> blood<00:01:04.540> begins

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
perhaps we can see as the blood begins

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:17.880 
perhaps we can see as the blood begins
to<00:01:05.410> enter<00:01:05.980> the<00:01:06.130> bedbug<00:01:10.979> there's<00:01:11.979> one<00:01:16.710> there<00:01:17.710> we

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:17.890 
to enter the bedbug there's one there we

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.120 
to enter the bedbug there's one there we
go<00:01:19.080> bro<00:01:20.080> look<00:01:20.259> at<00:01:20.380> that<00:01:20.530> look<00:01:20.680> at<00:01:20.770> that<00:01:20.829> look<00:01:20.950> at
