00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
so we just need to hit the switch down

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.010 
so we just need to hit the switch down
here<00:01:47.550> you<00:01:48.550> can<00:01:48.700> see<00:01:48.910> their<00:01:49.090> radar<00:01:49.420> sensors<00:01:49.840> on

here you can see their radar sensors on
either<00:01:50.170> side<00:01:50.470> of<00:01:50.500> the<00:01:50.680> mini<00:01:53.100> so<00:01:54.100> we'll<00:01:54.190> just

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
either side of the mini so we'll just

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.070 
either side of the mini so we'll just
take<00:01:54.520> our<00:01:54.580> time<00:01:54.759> now<00:01:55.149> I'm<00:01:55.360> gonna<00:01:55.570> drive<00:01:55.750> past

I'd<00:01:58.030> say<00:01:58.360> the<00:01:58.690> beam<00:01:59.259> will<00:01:59.440> be<00:01:59.470> short<00:01:59.800> and<00:02:02.160> the

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:03.160 
I'd say the beam will be short and the

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.469 
I'd say the beam will be short and the
mini<00:02:03.369> should<00:02:05.610> indicate<00:02:06.610> to<00:02:06.910> us<00:02:06.940> that<00:02:07.090> there's

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
mini should indicate to us that there's

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:20.150
