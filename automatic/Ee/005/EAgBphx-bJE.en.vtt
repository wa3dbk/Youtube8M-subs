00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:17.770 
important Justin came about when a bunch

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.230 
important Justin came about when a bunch
of<00:01:17.920> these<00:01:18.070> kids<00:01:18.400> that<00:01:18.580> live<00:01:18.790> in<00:01:18.940> the<00:01:19.030> mountains

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
of these kids that live in the mountains

of these kids that live in the mountains
in<00:01:19.630> Japan<00:01:19.990> the<00:01:20.470> roads<00:01:20.980> really<00:01:21.340> whiny<00:01:21.670> though

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:21.940 
in Japan the roads really whiny though

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:23.490 
in Japan the roads really whiny though
I'm<00:01:22.240> find<00:01:22.480> like<00:01:22.630> the<00:01:22.750> fastest<00:01:23.110> way<00:01:23.140> to<00:01:23.290> get

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:23.500 
I'm find like the fastest way to get

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.460 
I'm find like the fastest way to get
down<00:01:23.740> these<00:01:23.950> roads<00:01:24.630> we<00:01:25.630> needed<00:01:25.960> to<00:01:26.080> get<00:01:26.320> some

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:26.470 
down these roads we needed to get some

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:28.260 
down these roads we needed to get some
of<00:01:26.530> the<00:01:26.590> best<00:01:26.800> drivers<00:01:26.920> in<00:01:27.190> the<00:01:27.310> world<00:01:27.400> don't

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
of the best drivers in the world don't

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.380 
of the best drivers in the world don't
be<00:01:28.360> afraid<00:01:28.450> to<00:01:28.930> feed<00:01:29.710> a<00:01:29.740> little<00:01:30.100> too<00:01:30.310> much<00:01:30.520> if

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
be afraid to feed a little too much if

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.140 
be afraid to feed a little too much if
you<00:01:31.570> get<00:01:31.720> it<00:01:31.840> a<00:01:31.900> little<00:01:32.050> too<00:01:32.290> sideways<00:01:33.150> we

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.150 
you get it a little too sideways we

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:35.940 
you get it a little too sideways we
actually<00:01:34.300> put<00:01:34.900> the<00:01:35.020> car<00:01:35.230> into<00:01:35.470> a<00:01:35.620> slider

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
actually put the car into a slider

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.770 
actually put the car into a slider

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:47.260 
straight line setting the angle and then

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.050 
straight line setting the angle and then
dumping<00:01:47.680> the<00:01:47.830> clutch<00:01:48.040> to<00:01:48.340> slide<00:01:48.670> through<00:01:49.000> the
