night's<00:01:02.250> sleep<00:01:02.340> and<00:01:02.640> a<00:01:03.359> lot<00:01:03.960> of<00:01:03.989> water

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
night's sleep and a lot of water

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.890 
night's sleep and a lot of water
especially<00:01:04.949> when<00:01:05.369> we're<00:01:05.519> on<00:01:05.549> tour<00:01:05.790> and<00:01:06.180> it's

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
especially when we're on tour and it's

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.140 
especially when we're on tour and it's
really<00:01:07.170> important<00:01:07.560> that<00:01:07.680> we<00:01:08.040> stay<00:01:08.760> really

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
really important that we stay really

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.030 
really important that we stay really
well<00:01:09.270> hydrated<00:01:09.689> not<00:01:10.049> only<00:01:10.260> for<00:01:10.500> beauty<00:01:10.799> but

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
well hydrated not only for beauty but

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.160 
well hydrated not only for beauty but
their<00:01:11.400> muscles<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.270> through<00:01:12.510> general

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
their muscles and through general

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.240 
their muscles and through general
well-being<00:01:13.380> I<00:01:15.500> think<00:01:16.500> it's<00:01:16.590> very<00:01:16.680> important

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
well-being I think it's very important

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.710 
well-being I think it's very important
for<00:01:17.310> everybody<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:17.820> really<00:01:18.150> look<00:01:18.210> after<00:01:18.570> their

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
for everybody to really look after their

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.260 
for everybody to really look after their
feet<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.430> you're<00:01:20.430> on<00:01:20.640> your<00:01:20.820> feet<00:01:20.970> all<00:01:21.030> the

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
feet and you're on your feet all the

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.270 
feet and you're on your feet all the
time<00:01:21.420> and<00:01:21.750> I<00:01:21.810> think<00:01:21.990> we<00:01:22.080> don't<00:01:22.200> realize<00:01:22.590> the

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
time and I think we don't realize the

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.060 
time and I think we don't realize the
toll<00:01:23.520> that<00:01:23.790> just<00:01:24.689> general<00:01:25.110> living<00:01:25.470> takes<00:01:25.799> on

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
toll that just general living takes on

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.530 
toll that just general living takes on
your<00:01:26.250> feet<00:01:26.430> they<00:01:26.970> say<00:01:27.150> that<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.420> average

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
your feet they say that the average

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.060 
your feet they say that the average
person<00:01:27.689> actually<00:01:28.229> walks<00:01:28.560> around<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.860> world

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
person actually walks around the world

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.910 
person actually walks around the world
twice<00:01:29.549> in<00:01:29.970> a<00:01:30.119> lifetime<00:01:30.350> so<00:01:31.350> it's<00:01:31.680> really

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
twice in a lifetime so it's really

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.679 
twice in a lifetime so it's really
really<00:01:32.159> important<00:01:32.610> that<00:01:32.909> your<00:01:33.270> feet<00:01:33.479> always
