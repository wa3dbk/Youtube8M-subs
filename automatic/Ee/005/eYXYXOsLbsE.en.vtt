00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.939 
he's trying to come in get a little bit
more<00:00:26.730> harassment<00:00:26.970> down<00:00:27.359> there<00:00:27.710> I'm<00:00:28.710> not<00:00:28.890> sure

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
more harassment down there I'm not sure

exactly<00:00:29.519> where<00:00:29.789> the<00:00:30.029> factory<00:00:30.570> went<00:00:30.840> for

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
exactly where the factory went for

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.560 
exactly where the factory went for
fantasy<00:00:32.009> I<00:00:32.189> think<00:00:32.640> he<00:00:32.790> probably<00:00:32.969> floated<00:00:33.360> that

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
fantasy I think he probably floated that

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.870 
fantasy I think he probably floated that
maybe<00:00:33.780> back<00:00:34.350> to<00:00:34.680> his<00:00:34.950> base<00:00:35.190> I'm<00:00:35.610> not<00:00:35.820> sure

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
maybe back to his base I'm not sure

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.850 
maybe back to his base I'm not sure
where<00:00:36.239> it<00:00:36.360> went<00:00:36.480> to<00:00:36.690> be<00:00:36.809> honest<00:00:37.110> but<00:00:37.710> yeah

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
where it went to be honest but yeah

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.280

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
take this tank down I'm not sure if he's

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.210 
take this tank down I'm not sure if he's
going<00:01:10.409> to<00:01:10.500> be<00:01:10.560> able<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:10.770> do<00:01:10.890> it<00:01:10.979> though<00:01:11.100> I<00:01:11.130> think

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
going to be able to do it though I think

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.030

up for cannot-a scans the Rays almost

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.350 
up for cannot-a scans the Rays almost
takes<00:01:17.159> down<00:01:17.340> one<00:01:17.520> of<00:01:17.580> those<00:01:17.640> rates<00:01:17.939> so<00:01:18.180> this

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
takes down one of those rates so this

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.950 
takes down one of those rates so this
plan<00:01:19.020> might<00:01:19.290> be<00:01:19.320> backfiring<00:01:19.920> for<00:01:20.369> fantasy

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
guys I'd say are pretty tied up here as

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.010 
guys I'd say are pretty tied up here as
far<00:01:53.250> as<00:01:53.369> economy<00:01:54.180> goes<00:01:54.299> because<00:01:54.540> kannada<00:01:54.840> is

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
far as economy goes because kannada is

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.859 
far as economy goes because kannada is
finally<00:01:55.409> se<00:01:55.740> bead<00:01:55.920> back<00:01:56.549> up<00:01:56.790> gotten<00:01:57.630> a<00:01:57.689> bunch

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
finally se bead back up gotten a bunch

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:00.590 
finally se bead back up gotten a bunch
of<00:01:58.020> suvs<00:01:58.409> at<00:01:58.619> his<00:01:58.799> main<00:01:59.040> but<00:01:59.820> cannot<00:02:00.060> i<00:02:00.090> think

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
of suvs at his main but cannot i think

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.280 
of suvs at his main but cannot i think
has<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:01.049> larger<00:02:01.439> military<00:02:01.649> count<00:02:03.290> because

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:04.290 
has the larger military count because

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.830 
has the larger military count because
mostly<00:02:04.770> because<00:02:04.950> fantasy<00:02:05.579> had<00:02:05.850> well<00:02:06.570> actually

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
mostly because fantasy had well actually

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.380 
mostly because fantasy had well actually
fantasy<00:02:07.530> has<00:02:07.740> some<00:02:08.069> attacks<00:02:08.849> on<00:02:09.060> the<00:02:09.149> ground

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
fantasy has some attacks on the ground

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.360 
fantasy has some attacks on the ground
right<00:02:09.599> now<00:02:09.690> he<00:02:09.780> has<00:02:09.869> four<00:02:10.170> tanks<00:02:10.560> couple<00:02:11.220> of

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
right now he has four tanks couple of

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.730 
right now he has four tanks couple of
Marines<00:02:11.690> he<00:02:12.690> has<00:02:12.810> two<00:02:12.959> machine<00:02:13.290> shops

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:13.740 
Marines he has two machine shops

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.860 
Marines he has two machine shops
spinning<00:02:14.130> so<00:02:14.400> I<00:02:14.430> think<00:02:14.670> yeah<00:02:15.420> this<00:02:15.630> is<00:02:15.720> going

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
spinning so I think yeah this is going

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.810 
spinning so I think yeah this is going
to<00:02:15.960> be<00:02:16.050> very<00:02:16.380> very<00:02:16.710> bad<00:02:17.010> for<00:02:17.310> kannada<00:02:17.580> if<00:02:17.700> he

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
to be very very bad for kannada if he

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.800 
to be very very bad for kannada if he
lets<00:02:18.030> fantasy<00:02:18.810> use<00:02:19.200> his<00:02:19.500> vulture<00:02:19.950> upgrades

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
lets fantasy use his vulture upgrades

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:23.870 
lets fantasy use his vulture upgrades
effectively<00:02:21.810> man<00:02:22.410> fantasy<00:02:22.950> is<00:02:23.040> so<00:02:23.280> scary<00:02:23.700> with

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
effectively man fantasy is so scary with

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.690 
effectively man fantasy is so scary with
those<00:02:24.060> vultures<00:02:24.390> I<00:02:24.870> would<00:02:25.650> be<00:02:25.770> quaking<00:02:26.340> in<00:02:26.640> my

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
those vultures I would be quaking in my

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.790 
those vultures I would be quaking in my
boots<00:02:26.880> if<00:02:27.270> I<00:02:27.360> saw<00:02:27.540> one<00:02:28.020> of<00:02:28.110> fantasies<00:02:28.470> vultures

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
boots if I saw one of fantasies vultures

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.910 
boots if I saw one of fantasies vultures
coming<00:02:29.040> into<00:02:29.190> my<00:02:29.310> base<00:02:29.520> but<00:02:30.270> yeah<00:02:31.080> kannada<00:02:31.770> it

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
coming into my base but yeah kannada it

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.530 
coming into my base but yeah kannada it
looks<00:02:32.070> like<00:02:32.250> is<00:02:32.430> going<00:02:32.550> to<00:02:32.760> play<00:02:32.970> defensively

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
looks like is going to play defensively

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.720 
looks like is going to play defensively
I<00:02:33.870> think<00:02:34.470> he<00:02:34.560> has<00:02:34.680> some<00:02:34.860> troops<00:02:35.130> out<00:02:35.280> in<00:02:35.550> the

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
I think he has some troops out in the

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.270 
I think he has some troops out in the
field<00:02:36.000> but<00:02:36.900> that's<00:02:37.350> probably<00:02:37.800> not<00:02:37.950> going<00:02:38.190> to

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
field but that's probably not going to

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.980 
field but that's probably not going to
work<00:02:38.430> because<00:02:38.580> fantasy<00:02:39.090> is<00:02:39.240> Mac<00:02:39.480> rowing<00:02:39.750> back

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
work because fantasy is Mac rowing back

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.530 
work because fantasy is Mac rowing back
up<00:02:40.230> to<00:02:40.530> compete<00:02:40.920> with<00:02:41.100> konata<00:02:41.700> and<00:02:41.970> it<00:02:42.360> looks

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
up to compete with konata and it looks

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.210 
up to compete with konata and it looks
like<00:02:42.600> we're<00:02:42.900> going<00:02:43.050> to<00:02:43.140> transition<00:02:43.830> into<00:02:44.070> a

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
like we're going to transition into a

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.240 
like we're going to transition into a
pretty<00:02:44.550> standard<00:02:45.450> game<00:02:45.720> now<00:02:45.990> starting<00:02:46.530> off

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
pretty standard game now starting off

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.080 
pretty standard game now starting off
with<00:02:47.490> 2-port<00:02:48.120> versus<00:02:48.870> a<00:02:48.990> fast<00:02:49.260> expand<00:02:49.970> but<00:02:50.970> now

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:51.090 
with 2-port versus a fast expand but now

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:52.850 
with 2-port versus a fast expand but now
we're<00:02:51.300> starting<00:02:51.540> to<00:02:51.690> get<00:02:51.840> into<00:02:52.140> more<00:02:52.350> oh<00:02:52.560> the

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
we're starting to get into more oh the

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.070 
we're starting to get into more oh the
vultures<00:02:53.190> trying<00:02:53.220> to<00:02:53.490> sneak<00:02:53.700> by<00:02:53.940> cannot<00:02:54.780> doing

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
vultures trying to sneak by cannot doing

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.870 
vultures trying to sneak by cannot doing
a<00:02:55.170> good<00:02:55.650> job<00:02:55.710> picking<00:02:56.130> those<00:02:56.370> vultures<00:02:56.610> off

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
a good job picking those vultures off

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.730 
a good job picking those vultures off
making<00:02:57.060> sure<00:02:57.240> they<00:02:57.390> can't<00:02:57.570> get<00:02:57.750> any<00:02:58.050> economic

00:02:58.730 --> 00:02:58.740 
making sure they can't get any economic

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:00.830 
making sure they can't get any economic
her<00:02:58.860> ass<00:02:59.010> but<00:02:59.220> there<00:02:59.490> and<00:02:59.760> I<00:03:00.270> think<00:03:00.330> fast<00:03:00.720> he

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
her ass but there and I think fast he

her ass but there and I think fast he
was<00:03:00.900> actually<00:03:01.080> laying<00:03:01.470> some<00:03:01.710> mines<00:03:01.920> I<00:03:02.100> see<00:03:02.220> a

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
was actually laying some mines I see a

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.360 
was actually laying some mines I see a
lot<00:03:02.460> of<00:03:02.490> white<00:03:02.760> dots<00:03:03.000> there<00:03:03.270> on<00:03:03.420> the<00:03:03.570> map<00:03:04.370> the

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
lot of white dots there on the map the

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:07.010 
lot of white dots there on the map the
barracks<00:03:05.700> finally<00:03:06.030> coming<00:03:06.270> back<00:03:06.390> up<00:03:06.600> oh<00:03:06.780> the

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
barracks finally coming back up oh the

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.690 
barracks finally coming back up oh the
taking<00:03:07.350> out<00:03:07.440> that<00:03:07.470> barracks<00:03:08.010> might<00:03:08.550> have

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
taking out that barracks might have

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.120 
taking out that barracks might have
really<00:03:09.120> hurt<00:03:09.390> Kannada<00:03:09.750> because<00:03:10.170> fantasy<00:03:11.010> is

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
really hurt Kannada because fantasy is

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:12.860 
really hurt Kannada because fantasy is
getting<00:03:11.430> a<00:03:11.520> lot<00:03:11.820> of<00:03:11.850> factories<00:03:12.450> out<00:03:12.660> and

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.330 
Kannada can't he has no way of getting

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.240 
Kannada can't he has no way of getting
factories<00:03:15.840> up<00:03:15.990> before<00:03:16.290> he<00:03:16.380> built<00:03:16.650> another

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
factories up before he built another

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:20.210 
factories up before he built another
barracks<00:03:17.820> so<00:03:18.450> yeah<00:03:19.260> taking<00:03:20.070> out<00:03:20.190> that

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
barracks so yeah taking out that

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:21.680 
barracks so yeah taking out that
barracks<00:03:20.640> could<00:03:20.820> have<00:03:20.910> been<00:03:21.000> crucial<00:03:21.330> a

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
barracks could have been crucial a

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.990 
barracks could have been crucial a
crucial<00:03:22.230> point<00:03:22.410> in<00:03:22.620> the<00:03:22.740> game<00:03:22.850> looks<00:03:23.850> like

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
crucial point in the game looks like

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.220 
crucial point in the game looks like
fancies<00:03:24.390> coming<00:03:24.660> up<00:03:24.750> here<00:03:24.900> with<00:03:25.050> another

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
coming up for kannada so it's probably

soon going to try to use drop ships in

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.170 
soon going to try to use drop ships in
his<00:04:25.380> advantage

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
his advantage

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:31.020

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.030 
and I is doing a good job picking off

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:33.240 
and I is doing a good job picking off
the<00:04:31.270> mines<00:04:31.509> making<00:04:32.080> sure<00:04:32.259> that<00:04:32.590> a<00:04:32.860> lot<00:04:33.009> of

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:37.419 
texts are not really fast enough to pick

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:39.770 
texts are not really fast enough to pick
off<00:04:37.569> mines<00:04:37.870> but<00:04:38.139> a<00:04:38.169> bunch<00:04:38.349> of<00:04:38.470> glass<00:04:38.740> are<00:04:39.009> and

vultures he has vulture speed ups and he
has<00:04:45.879> mines<00:04:46.270> so<00:04:46.810> this<00:04:46.930> voltage<00:04:47.080> is<00:04:47.319> going<00:04:47.379> to<00:04:47.530> be

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:47.590 
has mines so this voltage is going to be

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:49.320 
has mines so this voltage is going to be
very<00:04:47.620> deadly<00:04:48.129> here<00:04:48.430> if<00:04:48.520> he<00:04:48.639> manages<00:04:48.759> to<00:04:49.030> drop

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.450 
very deadly here if he manages to drop
even<00:04:49.690> more<00:04:49.960> into<00:04:50.500> the<00:04:50.620> main<00:04:50.800> here<00:04:51.069> he's<00:04:51.190> going

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:51.460 
even more into the main here he's going

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.969 
even more into the main here he's going
in<00:04:51.580> with<00:04:51.759> his<00:04:51.940> dropship<00:04:52.620> picking<00:04:53.620> up<00:04:53.740> three

00:04:53.969 --> 00:04:53.979

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:56.139 
vultures and he's going to drop them in

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:59.010 
vultures and he's going to drop them in
and<00:04:56.379> try<00:04:56.500> to<00:04:56.530> get<00:04:56.710> even<00:04:57.099> more<00:04:57.449> SCV<00:04:58.449> kills<00:04:58.690> but

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.020 
and try to get even more SCV kills but

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:00.779 
and try to get even more SCV kills but
that<00:04:59.199> tank<00:04:59.530> there<00:04:59.770> might<00:05:00.370> make<00:05:00.639> the

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:00.789 
that tank there might make the

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:05.999 
that tank there might make the
difference<00:05:00.819> I<00:05:02.069> mean<00:05:04.169> konata<00:05:05.169> finally<00:05:05.680> got<00:05:05.860> his

00:05:05.999 --> 00:05:06.009 
difference I mean konata finally got his

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:07.999 
difference I mean konata finally got his
barracks<00:05:06.430> back<00:05:06.550> up<00:05:06.699> so<00:05:06.849> he<00:05:06.940> can<00:05:07.030> make<00:05:07.210> more

00:05:07.999 --> 00:05:08.009 
barracks back up so he can make more

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:11.120 
barracks back up so he can make more
factories<00:05:09.009> and<00:05:09.220> actually<00:05:09.520> Wow<00:05:10.360> fantasy<00:05:11.080> is

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.020 
denying the factories here he picked off

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:15.960 
denying the factories here he picked off
an<00:05:14.319> SUV<00:05:14.650> that<00:05:14.800> was<00:05:14.979> building<00:05:15.370> another<00:05:15.550> factory

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:15.970 
an SUV that was building another factory

00:05:20.339 --> 00:05:20.349 
is a vulture inside there and he has

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:22.080 
is a vulture inside there and he has
mines<00:05:20.650> all<00:05:20.800> over<00:05:20.949> the<00:05:21.069> place<00:05:21.250> so<00:05:21.490> fantasies

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:22.090 
mines all over the place so fantasies

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:24.990 
mines all over the place so fantasies
playing<00:05:22.259> very<00:05:23.259> brilliantly<00:05:23.919> and<00:05:24.759> he<00:05:24.849> has<00:05:24.969> a

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.000 
playing very brilliantly and he has a

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.730 
playing very brilliantly and he has a
lot<00:05:25.270> of<00:05:25.300> tanks<00:05:25.840> out<00:05:25.960> here<00:05:26.169> so<00:05:26.349> he<00:05:26.379> might<00:05:26.590> be

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:26.740 
lot of tanks out here so he might be

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:29.219 
lot of tanks out here so he might be
able<00:05:26.830> to<00:05:26.949> defend<00:05:27.129> against<00:05:27.940> this<00:05:28.330> push<00:05:28.930> from

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:29.229 
able to defend against this push from

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:31.469 
able to defend against this push from
canada<00:05:29.650> canada<00:05:29.860> is<00:05:30.190> going<00:05:30.460> behind<00:05:30.639> the<00:05:31.120> base

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:31.479 
canada canada is going behind the base

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:33.839 
canada canada is going behind the base
so<00:05:31.690> he's<00:05:31.840> probably<00:05:32.020> going<00:05:32.229> to<00:05:32.349> try<00:05:32.500> to<00:05:32.849> destroy

00:05:33.839 --> 00:05:33.849 
so he's probably going to try to destroy

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:36.390 
so he's probably going to try to destroy
the<00:05:33.969> pyramid<00:05:34.419> and<00:05:34.569> maybe<00:05:34.719> go<00:05:34.960> back<00:05:35.110> there<00:05:35.440> and

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:36.400 
the pyramid and maybe go back there and

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:37.290 
the pyramid and maybe go back there and
maybe<00:05:36.580> he's<00:05:36.729> going<00:05:36.880> to<00:05:36.940> try<00:05:37.060> to<00:05:37.090> intercept

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:37.300 
maybe he's going to try to intercept

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:38.969 
maybe he's going to try to intercept
anymore<00:05:37.960> dropships<00:05:38.409> that<00:05:38.560> might<00:05:38.710> be<00:05:38.800> coming

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:38.979 
anymore dropships that might be coming

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:41.640 
anymore dropships that might be coming
his<00:05:39.190> way<00:05:39.900> but<00:05:40.900> yeah<00:05:41.020> this<00:05:41.169> is<00:05:41.289> absolutely

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:41.650 
his way but yeah this is absolutely

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:43.409 
his way but yeah this is absolutely
insane<00:05:41.800> from<00:05:42.219> both<00:05:42.370> players<00:05:42.639> here<00:05:42.940> I<00:05:43.090> thought

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:43.419 
insane from both players here I thought

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:45.149 
insane from both players here I thought
the<00:05:43.569> fancy<00:05:43.930> was<00:05:44.080> way<00:05:44.289> behind<00:05:44.500> after<00:05:44.979> his

00:05:45.149 --> 00:05:45.159 
the fancy was way behind after his

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:47.309 
the fancy was way behind after his
attack<00:05:45.639> failed<00:05:46.000> with<00:05:46.479> his<00:05:46.690> race<00:05:46.930> but<00:05:47.259> he

00:05:47.309 --> 00:05:47.319 
attack failed with his race but he

00:05:47.319 --> 00:05:49.709 
attack failed with his race but he
seemed<00:05:47.560> to<00:05:47.650> demócrata<00:05:48.310> just<00:05:48.669> fine<00:05:48.940> to<00:05:49.389> compete

this play from fantasy I've never seen
anything<00:06:28.000> like<00:06:28.150> this<00:06:28.569> cuz<00:06:29.080> fantasy

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:29.650 
anything like this cuz fantasy

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:32.570 
anything like this cuz fantasy
definitely<00:06:30.069> was<00:06:30.279> behind<00:06:30.639> after<00:06:31.000> that<00:06:31.479> Wraith

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:32.580 
definitely was behind after that Wraith

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:35.490 
definitely was behind after that Wraith
well<00:06:33.580> I<00:06:33.789> guess<00:06:34.150> the<00:06:34.360> number<00:06:34.389> of<00:06:34.779> SUVs<00:06:35.259> the

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:35.500 
well I guess the number of SUVs the

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:38.129 
well I guess the number of SUVs the
fantasy<00:06:35.889> took<00:06:36.130> out<00:06:36.310> about<00:06:36.849> even<00:06:37.599> the<00:06:37.630> game<00:06:37.899> up

00:06:38.129 --> 00:06:38.139 
fantasy took out about even the game up

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:40.410 
fantasy took out about even the game up
enough<00:06:38.469> so<00:06:38.800> even<00:06:39.759> though<00:06:39.940> he<00:06:40.149> law

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:40.420 
enough so even though he law

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:42.420 
enough so even though he law
all<00:06:40.570> of<00:06:40.780> his<00:06:40.900> brace<00:06:41.170> at<00:06:41.560> the<00:06:41.830> beginning<00:06:42.280> it

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:42.430 
all of his brace at the beginning it

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:44.160 
all of his brace at the beginning it
didn't<00:06:43.090> make<00:06:43.210> a<00:06:43.240> difference<00:06:43.330> because<00:06:43.720> he<00:06:43.960> took

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:44.170 
didn't make a difference because he took

00:06:44.170 --> 00:06:46.850 
didn't make a difference because he took
out<00:06:44.290> enough<00:06:44.590> SUVs<00:06:45.040> to<00:06:45.220> really<00:06:45.490> even<00:06:46.000> it<00:06:46.090> out

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:46.860 
out enough SUVs to really even it out

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:49.740 
out enough SUVs to really even it out
but<00:06:47.860> man<00:06:48.070> absolutely<00:06:48.670> insane<00:06:49.300> look<00:06:49.570> at<00:06:49.660> this

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:49.750 
but man absolutely insane look at this

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:52.110 
but man absolutely insane look at this
macro<00:06:50.140> from<00:06:50.920> fantasy<00:06:51.370> bringing<00:06:51.730> it<00:06:51.790> all<00:06:51.940> of

00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:58.170 
his tanks and Kannada just can't keep up
and<00:06:56.010> taking<00:06:57.010> out<00:06:57.130> that<00:06:57.160> barracks<00:06:57.700> I<00:06:57.790> think<00:06:58.030> was

00:06:58.170 --> 00:06:58.180 
and taking out that barracks I think was

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:00.390 
and taking out that barracks I think was
absolutely<00:06:58.960> crucial<00:06:59.230> usually<00:07:00.010> when<00:07:00.160> you<00:07:00.250> see

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:00.400 
absolutely crucial usually when you see

00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.640 
absolutely crucial usually when you see
a<00:07:00.430> barracks<00:07:00.790> go<00:07:00.970> down<00:07:01.180> in<00:07:01.420> a<00:07:01.720> terran<00:07:02.170> vs<00:07:02.470> terran

00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:02.650
