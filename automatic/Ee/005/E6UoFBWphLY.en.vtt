00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:09.430
 like simyo the ball is perfect here 

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:11.620
 upholds 

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:13.990
 ajax will be against az this Sunday 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:15.730
 want to defend the lead 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.800
 for the young this technique is lucas 

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:20.110
 Sanders Hong is also kept 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:21.490
 no problem like he already abus here 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.080
 militia 

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:26.380
 with immediately the after compliments of 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.999
 none other than Dennis Bergkamp 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.919
 trainer Frank de Boer is not allowed on Sunday 

00:00:27.999 --> 00:00:31.419
 has dual fieldman's 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:33.160
 injured defender is replaced 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:34.660
 by ruben michonne 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:36.820
 half of the parties are viktor 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.469
 fischer he and his teammates will 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.370
 the low-ranked az is not 

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:40.960
 underestimate 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.850
 certainly after the recent experience in it 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.489
 cup tournament it is always taxing ge 

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.600
 match against az I think and it is 

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:47.800
 just not a good team there 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.600
 to forget 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.570
 natural standing is not that high and the 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.160
 competition but food will always be a good one 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.329
 team with good players and we 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.559
 have to be very careful and just yes 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.480
 do our very best to deal with 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:04.480
 win defending the lead 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:07.390
 will provide extra motivation 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.230
 for me however I have also 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:09.850
 the team 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.950
 I think it's a wonderful feeling anyway 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.930
 that you have everything in your own hands 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.920
 And then we also have to show that we 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.869
 just yes 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:22.820
 We started radiating that it was quite 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:24.710
 a lot of pass inn and yes we have confidence 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.060
 plays 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:27.409
 it's been a while since you 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.729
 scored you remember when you 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:32.149
 last does it made 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:34.430
 yes anyway i know the vvv and 

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:36.729
 that is very long ago is also too long 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.729
 ago 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:42.830
 the young 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:46.399
 there is schÃ¶ne and fischer and angela 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.780
 it is 0 2 by vector token but me i 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:50.479
 am confident that I will return 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:53.690
 come and I am a player who who 

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:57.229
 that skon ability has a and 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:58.700
 come in anyway trick and and we must too 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:01.069
 we must also remembered third kidney 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.690
 most important thing is that i'm going to score 

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:04.100
 of course the team record and that 

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.810
 we all know 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.390
 been busy all week with you 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.519
 Next to tighten up won with Dennis 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.380
 bergkamp you talk about it 

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:12.860
 we did have a few times 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.920
 talked about 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.670
 yes and it is mainly about quiet for the 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:23.000
 remain a tool and I think so myself 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:24.799
 just my gods and one of the things 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.090
 those that are your very best can only be the 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:27.890
 last five games is the one 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:31.100
 little too much 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:34.100
 want and and maybe a bit too much 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.660
 strength to eat chicken would love 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.510
 start scoring again 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.190
 chip must choose you must so you do 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.109
 first goal against feyenoord was one 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.120
 false highlights so far the 

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:46.010
 18 year old attacker hope there soon 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.750
 to add another 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:51.320
 i still need a tia maria would be nice 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:55.250
 be a champion before you turn 19 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:58.250
 is going to be but yes a match one 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:59.630
 contest how do you say step by step yes 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.329
 and that is during it already 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:05.540
 most important at this time and Sunday 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:07.040
 the weather will be better on Sunday 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.620
 I hope a lot is now very hot 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:12.260
 too cold this is mind once circumstances 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:14.120
 between eco very much for fact sheet 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.690
 will be Danish again on Sunday 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.340
 expected 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:20.260
 hopefully his prospects for the 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:20.260
 game against az a lot sunnier
