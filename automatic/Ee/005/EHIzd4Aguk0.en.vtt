through a neighborhood on the weekend a

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.620 
through a neighborhood on the weekend a

can't have that yeah that's you know
that<00:02:42.390> I<00:02:42.420> think<00:02:42.780> that<00:02:42.870> is<00:02:43.020> a<00:02:43.050> pretty<00:02:43.350> much<00:02:43.560> a

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
that I think that is a pretty much a

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:45.260 
that I think that is a pretty much a
logical<00:02:44.070> next<00:02:44.190> step<00:02:44.310> and<00:02:44.580> then<00:02:44.700> it<00:02:44.730> also<00:02:44.970> makes

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
logical next step and then it also makes

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:46.970 
logical next step and then it also makes
me<00:02:45.420> wonder<00:02:45.630> you<00:02:45.959> know<00:02:46.080> what<00:02:46.380> do<00:02:46.440> you<00:02:46.500> do<00:02:46.709> about

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
me wonder you know what do you do about

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.550

question<00:04:23.250> because<00:04:23.340> some<00:04:23.610> of<00:04:23.640> the<00:04:23.760> stuff<00:04:23.970> we

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:24.120 
question because some of the stuff we

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.659 
question because some of the stuff we
cover<00:04:24.330> in<00:04:24.510> this<00:04:24.660> segment<00:04:25.140> is<00:04:25.260> proposed<00:04:25.770> this

00:04:26.659 --> 00:04:26.669 
cover in this segment is proposed this

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:27.530 
cover in this segment is proposed this
one<00:04:26.910> is<00:04:27.030> in<00:04:27.150> effect

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
one is in effect

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.390 
one is in effect
the<00:04:27.630> state<00:04:27.900> of<00:04:28.050> Virginia<00:04:28.500> adopted<00:04:29.040> these<00:04:29.130> new

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 
rules last July and it's kind of

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:34.730 
rules last July and it's kind of
filtering<00:04:33.450> down<00:04:33.720> now<00:04:34.020> so<00:04:34.230> the<00:04:34.350> local

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
filtering down now so the local
