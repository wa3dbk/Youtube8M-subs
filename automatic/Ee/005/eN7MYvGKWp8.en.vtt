we're<00:00:50.160> going<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:50.370> do<00:00:50.489> here<00:00:50.700> is<00:00:50.730> we're<00:00:50.879> going<00:00:50.969> to

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
we're going to do here is we're going to

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.130 
we're going to do here is we're going to
show<00:00:51.210> off<00:00:51.390> a<00:00:51.420> couple<00:00:51.809> of<00:00:51.870> things<00:00:52.670> using<00:00:53.670> that

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
show off a couple of things using that

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.279 
show off a couple of things using that
ring<00:00:55.140> over<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.440> samples<00:00:56.039> directory<00:00:56.520> and<00:00:57.289> run

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
ring over the samples directory and run

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:09.690 
ring over the samples directory and run
an<00:00:58.410> S<00:00:58.590> basic<00:00:59.129> skirt

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.370 

the<00:01:10.700> basic<00:01:11.540> script<00:01:11.810> we're<00:01:11.930> going<00:01:12.050> to<00:01:12.110> run<00:01:12.170> here

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
the basic script we're going to run here

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.410 
the basic script we're going to run here
is<00:01:12.530> test<00:01:12.890> bas<00:01:13.820> and<00:01:14.860> just<00:01:15.860> like<00:01:16.010> dusk<00:01:16.340> this<00:01:17.210> is

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
is test bas and just like dusk this is

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.360 
is test bas and just like dusk this is
going<00:01:17.600> to<00:01:17.870> know<00:01:18.230> what<00:01:18.410> current<00:01:18.740> directory<00:01:19.160> we

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:19.370 
going to know what current directory we

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:21.070 
going to know what current directory we
are<00:01:19.520> in<00:01:19.700> and<00:01:20.000> if<00:01:20.150> it<00:01:20.270> doesn't<00:01:20.540> find<00:01:20.690> a<00:01:20.780> command

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
are in and if it doesn't find a command

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.600 
are in and if it doesn't find a command
that<00:01:21.170> matches<00:01:21.680> what<00:01:21.710> I've<00:01:21.980> entered<00:01:22.370> it's

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:22.610 
that matches what I've entered it's

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.240 
that matches what I've entered it's
going<00:01:22.820> to<00:01:22.940> see<00:01:23.090> if<00:01:23.210> there<00:01:23.390> is<00:01:23.510> a<00:01:24.250> executable

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 
going to see if there is a executable

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.520 
going to see if there is a executable
that<00:01:25.430> matches<00:01:26.060> it<00:01:26.090> in<00:01:26.570> this<00:01:26.690> case<00:01:26.930> test<00:01:27.350> not

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
that matches it in this case test not

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:33.730 
that up parse it all out and process it

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:37.050

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:20.819 
text and again it alternately breaks and

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:23.929 
text and again it alternately breaks and
you<00:03:20.879> can<00:03:21.030> do<00:03:21.150> a<00:03:21.389> control<00:03:21.780> see<00:03:22.079> if<00:03:22.739> it<00:03:22.980> has<00:03:23.129> a<00:03:23.459> p4

00:03:23.929 --> 00:03:23.939 
you can do a control see if it has a p4

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:27.649 
you can do a control see if it has a p4
last<00:03:24.120> command<00:03:24.480> like<00:03:24.780> in<00:03:24.930> Dallas<00:03:25.260> and<00:03:26.659> while

00:03:27.649 --> 00:03:27.659 
last command like in Dallas and while

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:30.559 
last command like in Dallas and while
the<00:03:28.099> command<00:03:29.099> set<00:03:29.370> is<00:03:29.579> fairly<00:03:29.819> limited<00:03:30.150> you

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569 
the command set is fairly limited you

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:35.300 
the command set is fairly limited you
can<00:03:30.720> do<00:03:30.900> copy<00:03:31.849> move<00:03:32.849> rename<00:03:33.480> delete<00:03:34.310> things

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
can do copy move rename delete things

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.000 
can do copy move rename delete things
like<00:03:35.579> that<00:03:36.500> everything<00:03:37.500> can<00:03:37.650> be<00:03:37.680> expanded

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
like that everything can be expanded

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.000 
like that everything can be expanded
because<00:03:38.370> you<00:03:38.670> can<00:03:38.819> use<00:03:39.060> not<00:03:39.540> only<00:03:39.569> s<00:03:39.989> basic<00:03:40.590> but

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
because you can use not only s basic but

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.509 
because you can use not only s basic but
full<00:03:41.669> net<00:03:42.389> micro<00:03:42.660> framework<00:03:43.109> as<00:03:43.349> well<00:03:43.829> as<00:03:44.160> the
