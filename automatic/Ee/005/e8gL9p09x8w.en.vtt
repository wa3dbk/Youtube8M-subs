however<00:00:16.150> if<00:00:16.299> you<00:00:16.420> have<00:00:16.570> a<00:00:16.600> Mac<00:00:16.869> you<00:00:17.170> need<00:00:17.350> to

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:17.440 
however if you have a Mac you need to

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.500 
however if you have a Mac you need to
note<00:00:17.650> that<00:00:17.680> Mac<00:00:18.160> only<00:00:18.460> has<00:00:18.610> one<00:00:18.820> sort<00:00:19.150> of<00:00:19.300> video

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:19.510 
note that Mac only has one sort of video

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:21.600 
note that Mac only has one sort of video
out<00:00:19.840> that<00:00:20.199> can<00:00:20.320> lead<00:00:20.500> to<00:00:20.530> an<00:00:20.800> external<00:00:21.100> monitor

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:21.610 
out that can lead to an external monitor

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:23.730 
out that can lead to an external monitor
and<00:00:21.820> that's<00:00:22.270> called<00:00:22.420> mini<00:00:22.690> DisplayPort<00:00:23.350> I'll
