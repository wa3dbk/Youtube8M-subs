00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.650 
really cool is there's this guy all the
way<00:02:34.200> up<00:02:34.440> here<00:02:34.680> and<00:02:34.940> it<00:02:35.940> doesn't<00:02:36.209> give<00:02:36.329> you<00:02:36.450> any

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:36.660 
way up here and it doesn't give you any

way up here and it doesn't give you any
points<00:02:36.989> whatsoever<00:02:37.680> for<00:02:37.890> actually<00:02:38.280> taking

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
points whatsoever for actually taking

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.880 
points whatsoever for actually taking
him<00:02:38.760> down<00:02:39.000> but<00:02:39.630> it's<00:02:39.780> still<00:02:39.989> fun<00:02:40.319> just<00:02:40.620> to<00:02:40.680> see

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
him down but it's still fun just to see

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.740 
him down but it's still fun just to see
the<00:02:41.010> body<00:02:41.160> fall<00:02:41.640> from<00:02:41.970> like<00:02:42.239> you<00:02:42.390> know<00:02:42.420> that

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
the body fall from like you know that

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.809 
the body fall from like you know that
high<00:02:43.140> in<00:02:43.290> the<00:02:43.380> sky<00:02:43.620> something<00:02:44.519> go<00:02:44.610> a<00:02:44.640> little

00:02:44.809 --> 00:02:44.819 
high in the sky something go a little

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:46.309 
high in the sky something go a little
bit<00:02:44.970> of<00:02:45.060> strategies<00:02:45.540> of<00:02:45.569> what<00:02:45.810> I<00:02:45.840> think<00:02:46.110> when<00:02:46.290> I

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
bit of strategies of what I think when I

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:48.500 
bit of strategies of what I think when I
actually<00:02:46.500> go<00:02:46.799> through<00:02:46.829> this<00:02:47.129> level<00:02:47.489> here<00:02:47.700> it's

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
actually go through this level here it's

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.449 
actually go through this level here it's
best<00:02:48.750> to<00:02:48.959> get<00:02:49.079> a<00:02:49.319> lot<00:02:49.769> of<00:02:49.799> your<00:02:50.040> head<00:02:50.190> shots

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
best to get a lot of your head shots

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.220 
best to get a lot of your head shots
when<00:02:50.700> they're<00:02:50.849> on<00:02:50.970> the<00:02:51.150> run<00:02:51.360> you<00:02:51.810> just<00:02:51.989> kind<00:02:52.170> of

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
when they're on the run you just kind of

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.710 
when they're on the run you just kind of
got<00:02:52.349> to<00:02:52.500> get<00:02:52.620> familiar<00:02:53.099> with<00:02:53.250> the<00:02:54.030> meters<00:02:54.510> and

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
got to get familiar with the meters and

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.000 
got to get familiar with the meters and
stuff<00:02:54.870> like<00:02:54.989> that<00:02:55.049> so<00:02:55.200> you<00:02:55.410> know<00:02:55.620> about<00:02:55.860> the

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.010 
stuff like that so you know about the

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.160 
stuff like that so you know about the
windage<00:02:56.370> and<00:02:56.400> about<00:02:57.299> what<00:02:57.510> you<00:02:57.540> need<00:02:57.750> to<00:02:57.840> be<00:02:57.989> as

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
windage and about what you need to be as

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:59.990 
windage and about what you need to be as
far<00:02:58.410> as<00:02:58.560> the<00:02:58.709> distance<00:02:59.160> time<00:02:59.430> travel<00:02:59.849> and<00:02:59.970> all

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
far as the distance time travel and all

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.580 
far as the distance time travel and all
that<00:03:00.180> kind<00:03:00.360> of<00:03:00.420> stuff<00:03:00.480> that<00:03:00.840> a<00:03:01.140> bullet<00:03:01.290> takes

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
that kind of stuff that a bullet takes

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.650 
that kind of stuff that a bullet takes
to<00:03:01.739> actually<00:03:01.860> hit<00:03:02.220> its<00:03:02.370> target<00:03:02.610> now<00:03:03.209> granted

whole silent kind of
now<00:04:09.250> the<00:04:09.880> way<00:04:10.030> that<00:04:10.060> I've<00:04:10.330> set<00:04:10.570> this<00:04:10.690> up<00:04:10.750> is

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:11.110 
now the way that I've set this up is

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:13.200 
now the way that I've set this up is
kind<00:04:11.440> of<00:04:11.560> perfectly<00:04:11.950> so<00:04:12.220> far<00:04:12.460> if<00:04:12.700> you<00:04:12.820> deviate

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:13.210 
kind of perfectly so far if you deviate

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:14.700 
kind of perfectly so far if you deviate
from<00:04:13.330> this<00:04:13.630> whatsoever<00:04:13.870> if<00:04:14.410> you<00:04:14.530> get<00:04:14.680> a

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:14.710 
from this whatsoever if you get a

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:16.800 
from this whatsoever if you get a
caution<00:04:15.010> or<00:04:15.430> if<00:04:16.060> you<00:04:16.150> do<00:04:16.300> something<00:04:16.480> like<00:04:16.690> that

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
caution or if you do something like that

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:19.080 
caution or if you do something like that
that<00:04:17.020> stops<00:04:17.560> one<00:04:17.980> of<00:04:18.100> the<00:04:18.190> patrolling<00:04:18.610> guards

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
that stops one of the patrolling guards

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:20.880 
that stops one of the patrolling guards
on<00:04:19.239> their<00:04:19.420> normal<00:04:19.750> pattern<00:04:20.170> then<00:04:20.650> it's<00:04:20.800> going

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:20.890 
on their normal pattern then it's going

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:22.380 
on their normal pattern then it's going
to<00:04:20.980> screw<00:04:21.250> up<00:04:21.400> the<00:04:21.520> whole<00:04:21.550> timing<00:04:22.000> for<00:04:22.330> the

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:22.390 
to screw up the whole timing for the

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:24.510 
to screw up the whole timing for the
thing<00:04:22.630> so<00:04:23.320> as<00:04:23.410> you<00:04:23.530> can<00:04:23.650> see<00:04:23.860> both<00:04:24.100> those<00:04:24.370> other

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:24.520 
thing so as you can see both those other

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.010 
thing so as you can see both those other
guys<00:04:24.700> are<00:04:24.940> moving<00:04:25.060> out<00:04:25.330> of<00:04:25.450> the<00:04:25.510> way<00:04:25.630> I'm<00:04:25.870> gonna

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020
