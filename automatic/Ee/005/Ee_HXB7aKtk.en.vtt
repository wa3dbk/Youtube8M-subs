00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:06.290
 Hello everyone and in this video I am telling 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:10.830
 about ink 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:12.170
 that is, the difference in ink between paint &amp; 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:17.840
 young 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:24.930
 starting with yang take a bottle of grog 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:25.590
 here see the grog baf right ink 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.670
 with an inscription 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.560
 young be hammers anzor grog 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:35.660
 Anything at all yes says that 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:39.930
 ink is alcohol based and 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:43.140
 translucent so let's say that they are 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.390
 pretty well overlap but still 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.750
 if the blessings are dirt and 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.390
 Well, I mean of the games who will be black 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.670
 see if it is 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:58.710
 colors you ink that is blue red 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:03.080
 green black well, more or less that 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:07.950
 there now look see the bank goes transparent 

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:10.260
 shocked and now we are flowing and again 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:15.799
 becomes transparent ie ink 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.799
 much more fluid ink than paint 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:23.850
 paint cans blowjob I'll show you by example 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:26.630
 squeezy cancer ring to 60 is tucked 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:33.380
 curved ink 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:37.880
 that's how they look they go thicker 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:41.280
 the color is saturated and this ink here 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:45.030
 they are much better overlap at all 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:48.119
 all that is but they have a minus 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.159
 let's say if taking grotovski such 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:53.070
 just to not be young here 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.509
 opponent written ink paint and here 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.350
 suddenly they 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:02:00.420
 Well in the marker it will be very bad to write for 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.950
 due to their consistency that is they 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:08.910
 much thicker and worse pass through the feather 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:15.090
 therefore it is better to pour only fsk leader and but 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:17.280
 These inks also have plus the cops 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:21.000
 have ink rifles they have a plus in 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:23.730
 the fact that they are a little harder to remove but 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:28.349
 not even slightly more difficult 

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:30.769
 remove say from glass despite 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:33.840
 that it is completely smooth surface 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:35.900
 that is, if there is such cheap ink 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.390
 300-350 glasses in the city 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:42.420
 Granovsky remove them from the glass altogether 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:45.890
 very simple because alcohol 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:49.170
 ink as they are more liquid 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:52.349
 translucent and satisfied and just 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:55.890
 removed with ordinary solvent there or 

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:59.599
 nail polish remover then this ink 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:01.500
 due to the fact that they are thick they are straight 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:04.470
 open and create such a small 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.959
 a layer like paint will take though it 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:11.090
 How much did you understand some kind of acrylic ? 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:14.390
 divorced plate blackened point of ski 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:16.050
 Generally if in vk vizir and take something 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:19.379
 will be much better 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:22.110
 and removing them is harder since I already 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:25.379
 said such find feeling as if 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:28.319
 thats really painted painted then 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:31.830
 there is but even network ink will be ck 

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:35.030
 viziers that is, they will write well 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:39.090
 but if the surface is dirty there 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:40.500
 important musket rough little then they 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:44.280
 just stopped writing 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:48.209
 especially dad wet on dirty so 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:51.870
 in general, that is, there is no point in taking if 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:54.840
 going to just run around like that 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:59.610
 on the glass on smooth plates somehow 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:04.709
 very nice to be under the only 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:07.670
 minus them it turns out that they are like me 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:11.160
 already said do not go to markers 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:14.610
 that is, the basis of the horn paint such 

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.930
 same and will not go token here if you take 

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:21.239
 acrylic mots 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:23.070
 here is such a warhol that's what it will go 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:25.650
 already in the marker they also have such 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:30.780
 the hammer marker is already refilled so 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:32.430
 acrylic will also fall and it makes it look like 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.600
 principle doesn't burn paper if u 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:37.470
 sides of the sketchbook 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:40.200
 ok will this ink and go and 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:43.740
 pzk reticle and token that is to say they 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:47.419
 better but they are more expensive in such a tube 30 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:50.940
 milliliters worth 200 rubles in the city 

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:55.229
 a large small jar like this 

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:58.470
 maybe a little less is worth 700 500 rubles 

00:04:55.229 --> 00:05:02.400
 husband is much more expensive though they 

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:05.630
 pretty just erased i.e. 

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:11.880
 just because of the color you can take them 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:13.200
 ink inko any packaging is written as 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:16.830
 I already said ink on alcohol 

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:21.900
 basis they go more liquid but they have 

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:23.900
 there is also a minus minus such that all 

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:27.419
 colors that is 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:29.930
 which is not black whether that is there 

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:33.599
 green blue red 

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:36.900
 there i don't know yellow they go no like 

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:38.190
 how not generally they all burn out on 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:42.300
 the sun is very fast 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:45.300
 it is literally two weeks that is not important 

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:47.789
 what are you grotesque sighting with a marker like 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:50.700
 thick not thick they anyway you believe and 

00:05:47.789 --> 00:05:53.570
 it is also very easy to erase them but they are better 

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:57.660
 fall on any surface at all 

00:05:53.570 --> 00:06:00.210
 dirty there rough wet on wet well 

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:02.940
 a little worse will go somehow marker 

00:06:00.210 --> 00:06:04.900
 my slip but they will write 

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:09.190
 let's say rather than acrylic 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:13.630
 and in the marker that is it is their plus therefore 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:17.080
 if you take cheap ink out there grog 

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:21.400
 molotov refill is he for the round of flop and 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:25.180
 a live from such that is these banks in 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:27.400
 the price of 300 350 rubles is colorful than 

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:29.500
 no better not take but they just 

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:32.080
 look very fast and how would you make sense 

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:36.190
 because if you take a cheap take 

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:39.190
 black-black at least they do not burn well, 

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:42.669
 keeps much longer also erased 

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:45.090
 easy as a game gofsky there are not colored 

00:06:42.669 --> 00:06:57.160
 black wine just do not fade 

00:06:45.090 --> 00:07:00.070
 this is a plus let's say so what else but 

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:02.789
 there is generally like acrylic in markers 

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:06.910
 it is better to take the hammers McFaul 

00:07:02.789 --> 00:07:11.440
 but again the price is very high I do not see 

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:15.580
 sense to lie them that purely poke on 

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:17.340
 this all subscribe to my channel 

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:20.919
 put likes 

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:25.050
 I think you liked I think available 

00:07:20.919 --> 00:07:25.050
 explained to everyone bye
