00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.680
 and this would be the video with the explanation 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.209
 the challenge of the two bottles is a 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.919
 challenge that is very good because no 

00:00:06.209 --> 00:00:09.419
 it only puts your creativity at stake 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.700
 imagination but also puts in 

00:00:09.419 --> 00:00:13.049
 I play your dexterity if you did not see it happen 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.999
 below I leave the link for you to see 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.010
 the challenge that you try to do first 

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:18.810
 because it 's good when you do it 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.250
 on your own and good if you do not succeed 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.279
 take out and suddenly you want to know how to 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.689
 does now the explanation comes first 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.519
 I'm going to show it at normal speed 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.410
 if at the speed that you would 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.759
 but then I'll explain it a little 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.589
 slower so you can understand a 

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:32.790
 little better although already having what they are going 

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:34.290
 to start practicing and they will take it out 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.870
 we have to take saying then of 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:42.020
 this way the two bottles yes and now 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:44.240
 we started we started and we took over 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:50.200
 we looked 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:50.200
 we go down in this way we take out 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:56.320
 and we got to the position that we had 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.020
 said and now comes the part that is a 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.060
 little harder than it is to go back to the 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.950
 position if you already achieve I'm going to meet you 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:05.020
 the goal but now if you can get back 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:09.060
 it's much better then you have to do 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:09.060
 everything in reverse we again take 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.579
 Y 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.759
 we got back to the position 

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:23.460
 initial ok let's explain it now a 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.409
 little slower I'm doing this 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.960
 way I start with the two bottles well 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.640
 in this way 6 try not to be left 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.399
 not too high not too low put the in 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.720
 the middle of the hand in this way and 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:37.860
 Now what we do is go down first 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.570
 we work there and now we put the 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.369
 finger inside this one that try to make the 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:43.380
 finger fit but we did not stay 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.840
 making a lot of force use more than 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.220
 nothing to put your finger and hold and not 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.860
 that is under pressure because later we 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.110
 they will be able to take it out if it was there already 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.670
 they have it on its side it does not fall now 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.610
 this allows us to maneuver the other 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.729
 bottle and we passed it up the 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:02.280
 another bottle of the green and we inverted it 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.929
 if until now we can not invest anything 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.810
 what we have to do is lower this 

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:08.549
 hour by hand and what is not going to 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.410
 allow now maneuver the other bottle 

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:13.620
 is that we are going to sustain this with the 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.959
 ring and pinky fingers and the palm of the 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.690
 hand in this way we have these three 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:21.210
 free fingers can be seen then and if 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.980
 we take this bottle again 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:24.600
 and now comes a part that is a bit 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.000
 difficult that is what 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.710
 it's harder to bring it that way 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.580
 yes because it will not take much more 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:35.800
 time but it's more effective now there's 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.110
 another way that is faster than it is 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:41.050
 throwing it but it is also more dangerous 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:43.630
 we throw it and we grab it and we upload it 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:46.280
 with practice they do it and there 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:48.080
 we change the position we invest 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:52.310
 and to go back we have to do all the 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:54.340
 inverse we lower it we have it here now 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:58.440
 we turn this one 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:03:01.030
 we lower it like this in this way 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:03.040
 we hold it with these fingers 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.620
 we have and now if they are going to take place from 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.390
 throw give him a clean squeeze to upload 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.890
 in this good way I hope that it has 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.569
 understood practice it because it is very 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:13.000
 Well, it's a big challenge because it's not 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:14.920
 only design but also has a lot 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.270
 of dexterity and if you want to see me there 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:20.550
 like this you have to go to the page 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:20.550
 one for all 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.710
 in the channel we have another challenge that 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.600
 It is also so good to make your 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:32.780
 friends are challenges that really go to 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.730
 break your head and there is one who has a 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.950
 little of this what is skill but 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.810
 that is also a bit of technique that is 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.490
 the challenge of how to start a guide 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.350
 telephone with your own hands I'll go 

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:44.990
 to leave here below and what is good is 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:46.970
 that is not strength but technique and is 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:48.800
 a good challenge to do to people and 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.410
 If I do not leave you another here above what 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:53.270
 we recorded quite a long time ago and it's the 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:54.590
 challenge of the tape you can see it as 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:56.480
 a challenge can be seen as a trick 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:59.300
 of magic and is very good is one that 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.970
 you are tied to a thread in both 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:04.519
 hands and put a ribbon in the form of a hoop 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:06.980
 in a circular way and the challenge of achieving 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:08.989
 take it out without untying the knot is great 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:12.080
 go through that video and good without more than 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:13.360
 say see you in the next video ciao 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:18.720
 bye 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:18.720
