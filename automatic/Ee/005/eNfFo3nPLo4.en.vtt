going to be talking about quick attack
cancelling<00:00:05.609> and<00:00:05.790> it<00:00:06.000> did<00:00:06.240> actually<00:00:06.420> return

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:07.250 
cancelling and it did actually return

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:10.070 
cancelling and it did actually return
you<00:00:08.250> could<00:00:08.400> still<00:00:08.639> do<00:00:08.760> it<00:00:08.790> which<00:00:09.210> is<00:00:09.389> pretty

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
you could still do it which is pretty

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.240 
you could still do it which is pretty
amazing<00:00:10.320> it's<00:00:10.650> just<00:00:10.800> a<00:00:10.920> little<00:00:11.040> bit

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
amazing it's just a little bit

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.339 
amazing it's just a little bit
situational<00:00:12.059> not<00:00:12.450> as<00:00:12.630> situational<00:00:13.200> as<00:00:13.259> you

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
situational not as situational as you

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:14.660 
situational not as situational as you
might<00:00:13.500> think<00:00:13.530> though<00:00:13.889> you<00:00:13.950> can<00:00:14.219> still<00:00:14.429> do<00:00:14.549> it

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
might think though you can still do it

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.930 
might think though you can still do it
like<00:00:14.849> on<00:00:15.059> entire<00:00:15.450> stages<00:00:15.990> but<00:00:16.980> it<00:00:17.279> depends<00:00:17.760> on

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
like on entire stages but it depends on

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.570 
like on entire stages but it depends on
the<00:00:18.060> stage<00:00:18.270> is<00:00:18.449> terrain<00:00:21.830> so<00:00:22.830> everybody<00:00:23.490> was

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
the stage is terrain so everybody was

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.460 
the stage is terrain so everybody was
disappointed<00:00:23.730> because<00:00:24.150> you<00:00:24.420> in<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.869> demo<00:00:25.199> in

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
disappointed because you in the demo in

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.640 
disappointed because you in the demo in
the<00:00:25.529> week<00:00:25.740> 3<00:00:25.980> in<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.880> wii<00:00:27.029> u<00:00:27.180> demo<00:00:27.570> you<00:00:28.439> could

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
the week 3 in the wii u demo you could

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.370 
the week 3 in the wii u demo you could
do<00:00:28.769> it<00:00:28.949> on<00:00:29.160> the<00:00:29.789> pilot<00:00:30.240> wings<00:00:30.420> stage<00:00:30.689> but<00:00:31.230> then

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
do it on the pilot wings stage but then

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.940 
do it on the pilot wings stage but then
this<00:00:31.859> happens<00:00:32.189> when<00:00:32.309> you<00:00:32.369> try<00:00:32.550> to<00:00:32.579> do<00:00:32.790> it<00:00:33.950> now

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
this happens when you try to do it now

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.920 
this happens when you try to do it now
look<00:00:35.160> if<00:00:35.340> you<00:00:35.489> do<00:00:35.670> it<00:00:35.760> on<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:35.880> curved<00:00:36.239> surface<00:00:36.329> on

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
look if you do it on a curved surface on

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.110 
look if you do it on a curved surface on
any<00:00:37.200> curved<00:00:37.620> surface<00:00:38.040> you<00:00:38.219> can<00:00:38.370> just<00:00:38.730> jump

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
any curved surface you can just jump

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.779 
any curved surface you can just jump
right<00:00:39.210> out<00:00:39.329> of<00:00:39.480> it<00:00:40.940> now<00:00:41.940> yoshi's<00:00:42.390> island<00:00:42.710> is

00:00:43.779 --> 00:00:43.789 
right out of it now yoshi's island is

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:47.930 
right out of it now yoshi's island is
like<00:00:44.789> entirely<00:00:45.780> curved<00:00:46.079> so<00:00:46.559> it<00:00:47.550> works<00:00:47.760> out

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
like entirely curved so it works out

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.360 
like entirely curved so it works out
perfectly<00:00:51.559> you<00:00:52.559> can<00:00:52.739> click<00:00:52.920> a<00:00:52.980> tech<00:00:53.160> into

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
perfectly you can click a tech into

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.090 
perfectly you can click a tech into
quick<00:00:53.520> attack<00:00:53.850> if<00:00:54.390> you<00:00:55.140> hold<00:00:55.410> down<00:00:55.500> will<00:00:55.920> cook

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
quick attack if you hold down will cook

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.709 
quick attack if you hold down will cook
attacking<00:00:56.489> into<00:00:56.699> that<00:00:56.850> top<00:00:57.059> platform<00:00:57.329> now

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
attacking into that top platform now

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.450 
attacking into that top platform now
that<00:00:57.899> it's<00:00:58.020> curved<00:00:58.350> does<00:00:58.920> it<00:00:59.039> kind<00:00:59.219> of<00:00:59.250> turned

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
that it's curved does it kind of turned

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.160 
that it's curved does it kind of turned
a<00:00:59.550> little<00:00:59.789> bit<00:00:59.940> you<00:01:00.480> can<00:01:00.629> now<00:01:00.719> put<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:00.989> attack

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
a little bit you can now put the attack

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.540 
a little bit you can now put the attack
through<00:01:01.469> it<00:01:01.620> if<00:01:01.739> you<00:01:01.829> hold<00:01:02.070> down<00:01:02.129> you<00:01:02.399> will

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
through it if you hold down you will

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.590 
through it if you hold down you will
sink<00:01:02.820> through<00:01:03.000> if<00:01:03.719> you<00:01:03.870> go<00:01:03.989> into<00:01:04.140> any<00:01:04.379> um<00:01:05.600> for

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
sink through if you go into any um for

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.359 
sink through if you go into any um for
all<00:01:06.689> like<00:01:06.900> or<00:01:07.229> if<00:01:07.350> you<00:01:07.439> go<00:01:07.530> through<00:01:07.799> any<00:01:07.979> curved

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
all like or if you go through any curved

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.590 
all like or if you go through any curved
stage<00:01:09.740> through<00:01:10.740> any<00:01:10.950> curved<00:01:11.340> platform<00:01:12.030> or

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
stage through any curved platform or

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.950 
stage through any curved platform or
slanted<00:01:13.080> platform<00:01:13.470> that<00:01:13.590> curved<00:01:13.890> slanted

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
slanted platform that curved slanted

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.530 
slanted platform that curved slanted
then<00:01:15.960> you<00:01:16.170> can<00:01:16.409> just<00:01:17.280> do<00:01:17.490> anything<00:01:18.090> you<00:01:18.270> could

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
then you can just do anything you could

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.030 
then you can just do anything you could
do<00:01:18.630> in<00:01:18.750> brawl<00:01:18.960> except<00:01:19.259> you<00:01:19.380> don't<00:01:19.500> get<00:01:19.710> our<00:01:19.830> co

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
do in brawl except you don't get our co

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.730 
do in brawl except you don't get our co
legs<00:01:20.369> so<00:01:20.820> it's<00:01:20.970> kind<00:01:21.150> of<00:01:21.180> better<00:01:21.360> but<00:01:22.110> not

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
legs so it's kind of better but not

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.460 
legs so it's kind of better but not
better<00:01:23.009> because<00:01:23.310> you<00:01:23.400> can't<00:01:23.580> do<00:01:23.759> it

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470 
better because you can't do it

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:31.200 
better because you can't do it
unconditionally

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:39.960 

just<00:01:32.080> pretty<00:01:32.229> nice

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:39.970 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.460 

just<00:01:40.660> like<00:01:40.810> in<00:01:40.960> bro<00:01:41.140> now<00:01:42.130> it<00:01:42.370> works<00:01:42.610> because<00:01:43.470> um

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 
just like in bro now it works because um

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:46.650 
just like in bro now it works because um
when<00:01:44.770> Pikachu's<00:01:44.950> I<00:01:45.460> or<00:01:46.120> this<00:01:46.270> is<00:01:46.390> what<00:01:46.420> I'm

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:46.660 
when Pikachu's I or this is what I'm

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.260 
when Pikachu's I or this is what I'm
guessing<00:01:46.990> happens<00:01:47.350> when<00:01:47.950> Pikachu<00:01:48.490> lands<00:01:49.030> with

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
guessing happens when Pikachu lands with

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.370 
guessing happens when Pikachu lands with
his<00:01:49.510> quick<00:01:49.720> attack<00:01:50.020> he<00:01:50.980> um<00:01:51.930> he<00:01:52.930> kind<00:01:53.110> of<00:01:53.140> slides

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:53.380 
his quick attack he um he kind of slides

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:56.070 
his quick attack he um he kind of slides
a<00:01:53.560> little<00:01:53.650> bit<00:01:54.330> well<00:01:55.330> okay<00:01:55.720> if<00:01:55.810> you're<00:01:55.930> in<00:01:56.020> a

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080 
a little bit well okay if you're in a

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.780 
a little bit well okay if you're in a
slanted<00:01:56.770> platform<00:01:57.160> there's<00:01:57.400> part<00:01:57.640> of<00:01:57.670> his

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:57.790 
slanted platform there's part of his

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.430 
slanted platform there's part of his
body<00:01:57.940> that's<00:01:58.240> still<00:01:58.480> in<00:01:58.600> the<00:01:58.690> air<00:01:58.840> and<00:01:59.110> part<00:01:59.380> of

00:01:59.430 --> 00:01:59.440 
body that's still in the air and part of

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.200 
body that's still in the air and part of
it<00:01:59.530> that's<00:01:59.620> still<00:01:59.890> on<00:01:59.980> the<00:02:00.070> ground<00:02:00.280> so<00:02:00.940> you<00:02:00.970> can

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
it that's still on the ground so you can

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.930 
it that's still on the ground so you can
just<00:02:01.240> jump<00:02:02.190> that's<00:02:03.190> what<00:02:03.370> I'm<00:02:03.460> guessing<00:02:03.850> it

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
just jump that's what I'm guessing it

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.840 
just jump that's what I'm guessing it
has<00:02:04.450> to<00:02:04.660> do<00:02:04.780> with<00:02:05.350> that's<00:02:05.950> why<00:02:06.250> it's<00:02:06.400> slanted

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
has to do with that's why it's slanted

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:08.760 
has to do with that's why it's slanted
so<00:02:07.330> that's<00:02:07.840> why<00:02:07.960> you<00:02:08.020> get<00:02:08.200> your<00:02:08.290> double<00:02:08.560> jump

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
so that's why you get your double jump

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:10.560 
so that's why you get your double jump
animation<00:02:09.250> when<00:02:09.399> you<00:02:09.460> press<00:02:09.670> X<00:02:09.940> but<00:02:10.450> you're
