just<00:00:23.939> going<00:00:24.060> to<00:00:24.119> take<00:00:24.359> and<00:00:24.539> quarter<00:00:24.869> the

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
just going to take and quarter the

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.589 
just going to take and quarter the
apples<00:00:25.439> doesn't<00:00:26.220> take<00:00:26.369> very<00:00:26.400> much<00:00:26.640> time<00:00:27.060> but

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
apples doesn't take very much time but

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.179 
apples doesn't take very much time but
definitely<00:00:28.050> helps<00:00:28.410> to<00:00:28.439> process<00:00:28.920> all<00:00:29.099> the

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
definitely helps to process all the

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.849 
definitely helps to process all the
ingredients<00:00:29.670> a<00:00:29.699> little<00:00:29.789> bit<00:00:29.970> better<00:00:30.150> so<00:00:30.859> it's

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
ingredients a little bit better so it's

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:33.440 
ingredients a little bit better so it's
going<00:00:31.980> to<00:00:32.070> start<00:00:32.250> by<00:00:32.430> tossing<00:00:32.640> these<00:00:33.000> in<00:00:33.239> one

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
going to start by tossing these in one

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.350 
going to start by tossing these in one
of<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:33.719> time<00:00:33.960> here

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.720 
to water it down too much put the lid on
definitely<00:00:55.800> use<00:00:56.010> the<00:00:56.100> tamper<00:00:56.309> for<00:00:56.610> this

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
definitely want to use a high speed to

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.160 
definitely want to use a high speed to
process<00:01:03.210> all<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.510> apples<00:01:04.369> use<00:01:05.369> it
