the

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.940 
the
you<00:02:07.800> picture<00:02:08.800> quality<00:02:09.239> of<00:02:10.239> it<00:02:10.539> so<00:02:11.379> there's<00:02:11.800> no

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
you picture quality of it so there's no

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.880 
you picture quality of it so there's no
way<00:02:12.129> to<00:02:12.459> get<00:02:12.760> around<00:02:12.849> that<00:02:13.239> it<00:02:13.810> just<00:02:14.110> does<00:02:14.410> and

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:14.890 
way to get around that it just does and

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:17.759 
way to get around that it just does and
with<00:02:15.280> the<00:02:15.370> ipad<00:02:15.730> mini<00:02:15.760> not<00:02:16.239> being<00:02:16.650> ready<00:02:17.650> to

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:17.769 
with the ipad mini not being ready to

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:21.570 
with the ipad mini not being ready to
display<00:02:18.129> and<00:02:18.879> all<00:02:19.090> that<00:02:19.360> i<00:02:20.580> personally

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
display and all that i personally

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.990 
display and all that i personally
probably<00:02:22.480> will<00:02:22.599> not<00:02:22.750> keep<00:02:22.989> it<00:02:23.140> on<00:02:23.260> there<00:02:24.000> it

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
probably will not keep it on there it

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.290 
probably will not keep it on there it
just<00:02:25.269> goes<00:02:26.080> a<00:02:26.110> little<00:02:26.319> bit<00:02:26.500> too<00:02:26.680> far<00:02:26.890> on

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
just goes a little bit too far on

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.800 
just goes a little bit too far on
degrading<00:02:28.300> the<00:02:28.750> picture<00:02:29.290> quality<00:02:29.680> so<00:02:29.980> um<00:02:30.910> but

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
degrading the picture quality so um but

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.360 
degrading the picture quality so um but
I<00:02:31.840> think<00:02:32.260> most<00:02:32.470> people<00:02:32.739> that<00:02:32.830> buy<00:02:32.980> this<00:02:33.040> in

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
I think most people that buy this in

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.089 
I think most people that buy this in
turn<00:02:33.459> on<00:02:33.580> money<00:02:33.819> for<00:02:34.200> the<00:02:35.200> screen<00:02:35.530> protector

00:02:36.089 --> 00:02:36.099 
turn on money for the screen protector

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:44.039 
turn on money for the screen protector
so<00:02:37.590> it's<00:02:38.590> kind<00:02:38.860> of<00:02:40.709> negligible<00:02:41.709> so<00:02:42.630> but<00:02:43.630> to

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:44.049 
so it's kind of negligible so but to

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:46.740 
so it's kind of negligible so but to
give<00:02:44.200> you<00:02:44.290> an<00:02:44.380> idea<00:02:44.500> if<00:02:45.250> it<00:02:45.880> can<00:02:46.090> pick<00:02:46.390> it<00:02:46.510> up<00:02:46.599> on

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
give you an idea if it can pick it up on

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.069 
give you an idea if it can pick it up on
camera<00:02:46.810> you<00:02:47.440> can<00:02:47.590> see<00:02:47.799> it<00:02:48.280> is<00:02:48.459> kind<00:02:48.819> of<00:02:48.880> a

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:49.079 
camera you can see it is kind of a

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:54.780 
camera you can see it is kind of a
semi-gloss<00:02:52.079> covering<00:02:53.079> so<00:02:53.290> it's<00:02:53.860> not<00:02:54.069> bad<00:02:54.340> if

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
semi-gloss covering so it's not bad if

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.729 
semi-gloss covering so it's not bad if
you<00:02:55.239> want<00:02:55.420> to<00:02:55.510> use<00:02:55.660> it<00:02:55.840> in<00:02:56.019> don't<00:02:56.200> spend<00:02:56.470> extra

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
you want to use it in don't spend extra

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:58.319 
you want to use it in don't spend extra
money<00:02:56.860> screen<00:02:57.310> protectors<00:02:57.730> for<00:02:57.880> the<00:02:58.000> minions

money screen protectors for the minions

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:01.620 
money screen protectors for the minions
are<00:02:58.450> kind<00:02:58.660> of<00:02:58.750> expensive<00:03:00.329> compared<00:03:01.329> to<00:03:01.420> some

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
are kind of expensive compared to some

in<00:03:24.040> somebody's<00:03:24.459> mind<00:03:24.670> but<00:03:26.400> everything

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
in somebody's mind but everything

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.340 
in somebody's mind but everything
everything<00:03:28.389> matched<00:03:28.630> up<00:03:28.930> your<00:03:29.139> well

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
everything matched up your well

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.890 
everything matched up your well
everything<00:03:29.950> fit<00:03:30.190> real<00:03:30.430> well<00:03:30.459> the<00:03:31.030> adhesive<00:03:31.540> i

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
everything fit real well the adhesive i

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:34.979 
everything fit real well the adhesive i
say<00:03:32.500> is<00:03:32.560> really<00:03:33.010> strong<00:03:33.280> so<00:03:33.340> i<00:03:33.970> don't<00:03:34.480> see<00:03:34.750> the

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:34.989 
say is really strong so i don't see the

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:36.870 
say is really strong so i don't see the
edges<00:03:35.139> are<00:03:35.560> going<00:03:36.100> to<00:03:36.160> peel<00:03:36.340> up<00:03:36.489> too<00:03:36.700> much

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
edges are going to peel up too much

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.800 
edges are going to peel up too much
eventually<00:03:37.810> it<00:03:37.959> will<00:03:38.139> just<00:03:38.889> with<00:03:39.069> everything

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
eventually it will just with everything

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:45.050 
eventually it will just with everything
just<00:03:40.810> with<00:03:41.730> everything<00:03:42.730> of<00:03:43.239> that<00:03:43.269> nature

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
just with everything of that nature

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.229 
just with everything of that nature
they'll<00:03:46.060> eventually<00:03:46.359> peel<00:03:46.870> up<00:03:47.609> given<00:03:48.609> the

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
they'll eventually peel up given the

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:55.140 
they'll eventually peel up given the
right<00:03:49.420> amount<00:03:49.690> of<00:03:49.750> use<00:03:52.170> but<00:03:53.220> no<00:03:54.220> i<00:03:54.519> think<00:03:54.910> it

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
right amount of use but no i think it

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.680 
right amount of use but no i think it
looks<00:03:55.329> good<00:03:55.540> it<00:03:55.840> matched<00:03:56.109> up<00:03:56.380> fine<00:03:56.680> um<00:03:57.010> i<00:03:57.970> took

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
looks good it matched up fine um i took

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.920 
looks good it matched up fine um i took
me<00:03:58.870> like<00:03:59.019> two<00:03:59.349> minutes<00:03:59.730> to<00:04:00.730> put<00:04:00.910> it<00:04:01.000> on<00:04:01.120> and<00:04:01.480> it

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
me like two minutes to put it on and it

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.599 
me like two minutes to put it on and it
matched<00:04:02.170> up<00:04:02.380> perfectly<00:04:02.410> so<00:04:03.190> um<00:04:05.220> it's<00:04:06.220> none<00:04:06.579> of

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:06.609 
matched up perfectly so um it's none of

00:04:06.609 --> 00:04:09.000 
matched up perfectly so um it's none of
those<00:04:06.790> where<00:04:07.150> it's<00:04:07.750> super<00:04:08.200> thin<00:04:08.500> you're<00:04:08.889> gonna

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010 
those where it's super thin you're gonna

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.890 
those where it's super thin you're gonna
get<00:04:09.160> bubbles<00:04:09.639> or<00:04:10.000> or<00:04:10.750> something<00:04:11.200> like<00:04:11.319> that

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
get bubbles or or something like that

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.770 
get bubbles or or something like that
but<00:04:13.900> it's<00:04:14.650> pretty<00:04:14.799> nice<00:04:14.980> all<00:04:15.280> the<00:04:15.519> the<00:04:16.359> edges

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:16.780 
but it's pretty nice all the the edges

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.240 
but it's pretty nice all the the edges
match<00:04:17.620> up<00:04:17.950> pretty<00:04:18.700> well<00:04:18.849> if<00:04:19.539> the<00:04:19.870> camera<00:04:20.289> hole

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
match up pretty well if the camera hole

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.900 
match up pretty well if the camera hole
and<00:04:21.340> all<00:04:21.970> the<00:04:22.240> edges<00:04:22.570> got<00:04:22.780> kind<00:04:23.050> of<00:04:23.110> a

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
and all the edges got kind of a

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:27.480 
and all the edges got kind of a
wraparound<00:04:25.140> little<00:04:26.140> strap<00:04:26.440> if<00:04:26.650> you<00:04:26.800> can<00:04:26.950> if

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490
