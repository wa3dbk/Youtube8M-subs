00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.070 
and like our North Carolina game I mean

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.220 
and like our North Carolina game I mean
it<00:02:24.220> kicks<00:02:24.460> in<00:02:24.610> in<00:02:24.820> the<00:02:24.910> second<00:02:25.240> quarter<00:02:25.420> it

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
it kicks in in the second quarter it

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.650 
it kicks in in the second quarter it
starts<00:02:26.680> in<00:02:26.890> and<00:02:27.190> then<00:02:27.790> continues<00:02:28.390> through<00:02:28.600> the

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
starts in and then continues through the

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:33.060 
starts in and then continues through the
game<00:02:28.930> so<00:02:30.420> strength<00:02:31.420> speed<00:02:31.690> all<00:02:32.620> that<00:02:32.650> kind<00:02:33.010> of

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
game so strength speed all that kind of

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:39.830 
game so strength speed all that kind of
stuff<00:02:33.130> is<00:02:33.580> extremely<00:02:34.239> important<00:02:34.930> no<00:02:35.709> question

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.479 

the<00:02:40.840> TV<00:02:41.170> show<00:02:41.410> but<00:02:42.270> I<00:02:43.270> guess<00:02:43.450> national<00:02:44.489> yeah

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:45.489 
the TV show but I guess national yeah
