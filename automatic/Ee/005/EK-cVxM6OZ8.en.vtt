00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 work is to produce these 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:07.950
 bicycles and takes three months for each 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.630
 one gets ready for a first glance all over 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.780
 the woodwork looks the same 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:16.440
 the difference is in the joiner and this 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.460
 Japanese history of generations ago 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.130
 200 years 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.500
 the year suicide family has always done the 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.930
 that wanted with wood were specialists 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.810
 low it but perfection in 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:31.679
 to take a helm took the Lord to 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:35.630
 other circles wheel frame the bench 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:37.710
 of gift and the passion to create was born 

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:40.829
 bicycles 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:44.850
 the brightness is reached after twenty hands 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:48.350
 and stays until connect crosses 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.350
 with other more powerful machines 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:56.300
 the first model from 2007 to this one 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.199
 latest developments but several were 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.550
 for the saints 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:01.280
 the main one to leave the 

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:04.430
 lighter bike this one weighs 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:07.190
 only seven and a half pounds and impresses 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:11.540
 also the whim in the details until the 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:13.970
 Bottle holder is made of wood 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:17.990
 The style of the bike may vary 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:21.560
 wood is one only the mahogany manufacture the wheel 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:26.270
 requires more attention are 14 layers 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:28.580
 very thin marks cut together as 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:31.429
 I try to do that. 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.320
 after it's ready, it's no good looking 

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:35.840
 we do not think the amendments in 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.720
 wood and lord saints have fun 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.880
 when you discover technology behind 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.159
 so much accuracy I asked him if he would use 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.040
 the computer to do the calculations 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:50.300
 he showed calculators 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:52.130
 and dusty the result is resistant to 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:55.250
 People watch in the race tracks. 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.800
 these 2012 images show proof 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:00.620
 long- life and the wood model 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.730
 overtakes easy racing bike 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.670
 common 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:07.250
 those who get excited have to be patient and 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:10.190
 money each bike costs the equivalent of 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:11.540
 40,000 real and takes three months to 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.610
 Get ready 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.280
 this customer has his wooden wheels 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.560
 by a traditional bicycle 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.750
 people stop me on the street and 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.360
 impressed by the beauty and the beauty 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:27.170
 but I guarantee it is not very functional is 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:29.690
 light and strong is the world 's best wheel 

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.030
 Mr. Sandro is happy but does not hide. 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:36.200
 a worry is not for whom 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:38.510
 knowledge to young people. 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.030
 Japanese are materialistic nowadays 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:41.900
 and in this profession you need to 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:45.410
 to dedicate 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.950
 you prioritize pride the knowledge 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:51.410
 of generations such as riding a bicycle 

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:54.010
 is in a fine balance is good
