00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
because we live in this society of speed

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.700 
because we live in this society of speed
everything's<00:00:39.989> got<00:00:40.110> to<00:00:40.140> be<00:00:40.230> done<00:00:40.469> right<00:00:40.649> now

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
everything's got to be done right now

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.260 
everything's got to be done right now
it's<00:00:41.160> got<00:00:41.280> to<00:00:41.370> happen<00:00:41.489> now<00:00:41.790> if<00:00:41.910> it<00:00:42.000> doesn't

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:42.270 
it's got to happen now if it doesn't

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:43.459 
it's got to happen now if it doesn't
happen<00:00:42.390> now<00:00:42.660> then<00:00:42.899> it's<00:00:43.020> never<00:00:43.230> going<00:00:43.410> to

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
happen now then it's never going to

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.830 
happen now then it's never going to
happen<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:44.010> this<00:00:44.550> this<00:00:44.850> madness<00:00:45.450> is<00:00:45.629> what's

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
happen and this this madness is what's

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.049 
happen and this this madness is what's
kind<00:00:46.110> of<00:00:46.170> taking<00:00:46.590> this<00:00:46.680> all<00:00:46.890> out<00:00:47.129> of<00:00:47.309> context

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
kind of taking this all out of context

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.600 
kind of taking this all out of context
and<00:00:48.180> I<00:00:48.809> think<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.289> real<00:00:49.500> thing<00:00:49.829> is<00:00:50.070> the

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
and I think the real thing is the

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:54.139 
and I think the real thing is the
content<00:00:51.149> is<00:00:51.329> if<00:00:52.170> we<00:00:52.590> just<00:00:53.340> realize<00:00:53.460> or<00:00:54.059> the

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
content is if we just realize or the

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:56.840 
content is if we just realize or the
studio's<00:00:54.660> realize<00:00:55.170> that<00:00:55.410> it's<00:00:55.590> not<00:00:55.680> about<00:00:56.579> the

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
studio's realize that it's not about the

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.700 
studio's realize that it's not about the
process<00:00:57.420> and<00:00:57.629> this<00:00:57.690> is<00:00:57.870> something<00:00:58.020> Steve<00:00:58.440> Jobs

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
process and this is something Steve Jobs

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.709 
process and this is something Steve Jobs
had<00:00:58.949> said<00:00:59.190> it's<00:00:59.370> not<00:00:59.489> about<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.969> process<00:01:00.510> it's

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
had said it's not about the process it's

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.529 
had said it's not about the process it's
about<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.170> content<00:01:01.710> and<00:01:01.890> if<00:01:02.550> we<00:01:02.760> understand

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
about the content and if we understand

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.289 
about the content and if we understand
that<00:01:03.660> it's<00:01:03.960> not<00:01:04.199> about<00:01:04.610> what<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.760> studios

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
that it's not about what the studios

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.910 
that it's not about what the studios
have<00:01:06.570> come<00:01:06.780> to<00:01:08.000> think<00:01:09.000> is<00:01:09.210> that<00:01:09.530> if<00:01:10.530> we<00:01:10.740> just

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
have come to think is that if we just

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.030 
have come to think is that if we just
call<00:01:11.189> you<00:01:11.369> um<00:01:11.700> get<00:01:12.540> all<00:01:12.750> this<00:01:12.930> merchandise<00:01:13.439> out

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
call you um get all this merchandise out

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.770 
call you um get all this merchandise out
we've<00:01:14.460> got<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.790> do<00:01:14.939> all<00:01:14.970> this<00:01:15.210> we<00:01:15.390> got<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.659> do

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
we've got to do all this we got to do

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.480 
we've got to do all this we got to do
that<00:01:15.930> they<00:01:16.080> lose<00:01:16.320> sight<00:01:16.770> they<00:01:17.130> get

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
that they lose sight they get

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.399 
that they lose sight they get
sidetracked<00:01:17.850> you<00:01:18.630> know<00:01:18.750> because<00:01:19.110> they're<00:01:19.290> not

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
sidetracked you know because they're not

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.140 
sidetracked you know because they're not
artists<00:01:20.040> and<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.520> it's<00:01:20.670> all<00:01:20.820> becomes

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
artists and and it's all becomes

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.330 
artists and and it's all becomes
business<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:21.900> that's<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.290> reality<00:01:22.619> becomes

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
business and that's the reality becomes

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.660 
business and that's the reality becomes
business<00:01:23.939> and<00:01:24.150> so<00:01:24.930> that<00:01:25.140> this<00:01:25.409> is<00:01:25.590> where<00:01:25.920> the

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
business and so that this is where the

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.840 
business and so that this is where the
process<00:01:27.540> can<00:01:28.020> often<00:01:28.560> outweigh<00:01:29.070> the<00:01:29.280> content

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
process can often outweigh the content

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.149 
process can often outweigh the content
and<00:01:30.000> thereby<00:01:30.689> the<00:01:30.990> artists<00:01:31.740> at<00:01:31.829> the<00:01:31.950> end<00:01:32.070> of

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
and thereby the artists at the end of

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.740 
and thereby the artists at the end of
the<00:01:32.220> day<00:01:32.369> gets<00:01:32.640> screwed<00:01:32.939> because<00:01:33.270> there's

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
the day gets screwed because there's

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.690 
the day gets screwed because there's
such<00:01:34.140> this<00:01:34.380> rush<00:01:34.740> in<00:01:34.950> this<00:01:35.100> need<00:01:35.340> and<00:01:35.579> this

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
such this rush in this need and this

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.340 
such this rush in this need and this
urgency<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:36.630> inside<00:01:36.840> we<00:01:36.960> don't<00:01:37.140> care<00:01:37.259> how

and it's got to be spread because at

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.670 
and it's got to be spread because at
what<00:05:26.700> point<00:05:26.970> does<00:05:27.150> it<00:05:27.210> change<00:05:27.540> so<00:05:28.110> I<00:05:28.140> just<00:05:28.470> want

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
what point does it change so I just want

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.010 
what point does it change so I just want
you<00:05:28.800> to<00:05:28.920> think<00:05:28.950> about<00:05:29.460> that<00:05:29.790> on<00:05:30.060> these<00:05:30.660> levels

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:31.020 
you to think about that on these levels

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:35.300 
you to think about that on these levels
that<00:05:31.770> you<00:05:32.220> can<00:05:32.490> take<00:05:32.760> the<00:05:33.540> control<00:05:34.050> if<00:05:34.410> you

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:35.310 
that you can take the control if you

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:37.580 
that you can take the control if you
speak<00:05:35.700> up<00:05:35.880> and<00:05:36.090> say<00:05:36.390> something<00:05:36.450> so<00:05:37.170> whatever
