00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:18.660 
braid another name for it is cornrow so

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:22.280 
braid another name for it is cornrow so
you<00:03:18.750> start<00:03:19.080> off<00:03:19.230> with<00:03:19.260> three<00:03:19.830> strands<00:03:20.930> and<00:03:21.930> you

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
you start off with three strands and you

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.710 
you start off with three strands and you
doing<00:03:22.770> basically<00:03:23.220> a<00:03:23.340> normal<00:03:23.940> braid<00:03:24.270> but<00:03:24.510> you

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
doing basically a normal braid but you

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.920 
doing basically a normal braid but you
picking<00:03:25.080> up<00:03:25.170> hair<00:03:25.410> as<00:03:25.530> you're<00:03:25.680> going<00:03:25.830> along

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:26.930 
picking up hair as you're going along

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:29.750 
picking up hair as you're going along
and<00:03:27.930> again<00:03:28.410> I'm<00:03:28.560> doing<00:03:28.590> a<00:03:28.950> loose<00:03:29.190> one<00:03:29.489> so<00:03:29.640> you

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
and again I'm doing a loose one so you

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:31.670 
and again I'm doing a loose one so you
can<00:03:29.910> see<00:03:30.209> what<00:03:30.390> I'm<00:03:30.480> doing<00:03:30.510> and<00:03:31.049> then<00:03:31.110> the<00:03:31.260> next

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
can see what I'm doing and then the next

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.610 
can see what I'm doing and then the next
time<00:03:32.040> I<00:03:32.400> will<00:03:32.580> do<00:03:32.790> a<00:03:33.060> slower<00:03:33.780> one<00:03:34.080> bringing<00:03:34.440> it

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
time I will do a slower one bringing it

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:40.729 
time I will do a slower one bringing it
closer<00:03:34.890> to<00:03:35.130> the<00:03:35.400> scalp<00:03:35.850> so<00:03:38.959> just<00:03:39.959> pretend<00:03:40.200> if

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
closer to the scalp so just pretend if

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:45.750 
closer to the scalp so just pretend if
you<00:03:41.040> were<00:03:41.190> doing<00:03:41.610> a<00:03:41.820> normal<00:03:42.769> three-strand

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
you were doing a normal three-strand

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.630 
you were doing a normal three-strand
great<00:03:46.450> but<00:03:47.379> you're<00:03:47.530> just<00:03:47.739> gathering<00:03:47.980> here<00:03:48.550> is

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640 
great but you're just gathering here is

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.460 
great but you're just gathering here is
he<00:03:48.760> going<00:03:49.030> long<00:03:51.659> I'm<00:03:52.659> gonna<00:03:52.810> slow<00:03:53.170> it<00:03:53.200> down<00:03:53.319> a

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:53.470 
he going long I'm gonna slow it down a

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:56.699 
he going long I'm gonna slow it down a
little<00:03:53.860> bed<00:03:54.010> and<00:03:54.840> starting<00:03:55.840> off<00:03:55.989> with<00:03:56.170> three

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:56.709 
little bed and starting off with three

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:00.420 
little bed and starting off with three
strands<00:03:58.260> so<00:03:59.260> if<00:03:59.319> you<00:03:59.500> would<00:03:59.620> do<00:03:59.769> normal

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:00.430 
strands so if you would do normal

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:05.490 
strands so if you would do normal
braided<00:04:02.700> and<00:04:03.700> using<00:04:04.239> your<00:04:04.390> index<00:04:04.599> finger<00:04:05.290> to

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
braided and using your index finger to

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:15.270 
braided and using your index finger to
scoop<00:04:05.920> up<00:04:06.099> hair<00:04:06.340> behind<00:04:06.849> you<00:04:07.120> as<00:04:07.360> you<00:04:07.390> go<00:04:07.750> along

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:15.280 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:21.340 

exposing<00:04:16.280> it<00:04:16.900> an<00:04:18.700> expose<00:04:19.700> an<00:04:19.970> end<00:04:20.350> and

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.350 
exposing it an expose an end and

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:23.320 
exposing it an expose an end and
sometimes<00:04:21.920> with<00:04:22.160> these<00:04:22.340> when<00:04:23.060> you<00:04:23.180> learn

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:23.330 
sometimes with these when you learn

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:24.790 
sometimes with these when you learn
something<00:04:23.600> new<00:04:23.870> you<00:04:23.900> have<00:04:24.200> to<00:04:24.230> come<00:04:24.470> up<00:04:24.500> with<00:04:24.620> a

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
something new you have to come up with a

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.060 
something new you have to come up with a
rhythm<00:04:25.370> or<00:04:25.730> something<00:04:26.300> to<00:04:26.450> help<00:04:26.660> you<00:04:26.930> to<00:04:27.080> keep

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070
