cable and so to begin with what you
would<00:00:26.070> need<00:00:26.340> is<00:00:27.020> your<00:00:28.020> hard<00:00:28.380> drive<00:00:28.560> of<00:00:28.590> course

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:28.770 
would need is your hard drive of course

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:35.180 
would need is your hard drive of course
SATA<00:00:29.550> hard<00:00:29.759> drive<00:00:30.029> and<00:00:32.059> drug<00:00:33.059> caddy<00:00:33.329> cable<00:00:34.290> so

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
SATA hard drive and drug caddy cable so

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.030 
SATA hard drive and drug caddy cable so
let's<00:00:35.399> start<00:00:35.730> off<00:00:35.940> by<00:00:36.590> assembling<00:00:37.590> both<00:00:37.829> the

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
let's start off by assembling both the

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:44.900 
let's start off by assembling both the
hard<00:00:38.370> drive<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:38.820> caddy<00:00:39.270> together<00:00:43.760> you<00:00:44.760> would

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910 
hard drive and caddy together you would

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:52.850 
hard drive and caddy together you would
just<00:00:45.120> attach<00:00:45.540> then<00:00:46.730> the<00:00:47.730> four<00:00:48.150> screws<00:00:51.740> to<00:00:52.740> the

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
just attach then the four screws to the

00:00:52.860 --> 00:01:00.200 
just attach then the four screws to the
sides<00:00:53.130> of<00:00:53.310> the<00:00:53.400> hard<00:00:53.610> drive

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.460 

and<00:01:00.750> what<00:01:00.960> we're<00:01:01.110> using<00:01:01.290> here<00:01:01.560> is<00:01:01.770> a<00:01:02.240> SATA

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:03.470 
and what we're using here is a SATA

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.980 
and what we're using here is a SATA
two-and-a-half<00:01:04.470> inch<00:01:04.680> hard<00:01:04.980> drive<00:01:05.900> and<00:01:06.900> you

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
two-and-a-half inch hard drive and you

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.620 
two-and-a-half inch hard drive and you
can<00:01:07.140> also<00:01:07.290> use<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.620> SATA<00:01:08.390> two-and-a-half<00:01:09.390> inch

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
can also use a SATA two-and-a-half inch

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:17.780 
can also use a SATA two-and-a-half inch
SSD

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.920 

now<00:01:18.790> this<00:01:19.090> laptop<00:01:19.570> here<00:01:20.080> is<00:01:20.320> the<00:01:20.500> HP<00:01:21.340> and<00:01:21.970> b-17

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:22.930 
now this laptop here is the HP and b-17

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:28.490 
now this laptop here is the HP and b-17

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.980 
3000 series earth 3000 or 3 X X X series
we<00:01:29.500> have<00:01:29.800> a<00:01:29.830> different<00:01:30.610> solution<00:01:30.910> for<00:01:31.390> the

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
we have a different solution for the

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.340 
we have a different solution for the
older<00:01:32.350> ND<00:01:32.650> 17<00:01:33.220> which<00:01:34.000> are<00:01:34.210> the<00:01:34.360> 1000<00:01:35.200> series

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
older ND 17 which are the 1000 series

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.600 
older ND 17 which are the 1000 series
and<00:01:35.890> the<00:01:36.520> 2000<00:01:37.090> series<00:01:37.560> so<00:01:38.560> now<00:01:38.680> that<00:01:39.010> not<00:01:39.430> that

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
and the 2000 series so now that not that

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.080 
and the 2000 series so now that not that
we<00:01:39.729> have<00:01:39.910> a<00:01:40.140> hard<00:01:41.140> drive<00:01:41.410> and<00:01:41.890> caddy<00:01:42.760> or

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
we have a hard drive and caddy or

and hard drive caddy into the laptop so

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.580 
and hard drive caddy into the laptop so
it's<00:04:13.500> just<00:04:13.680> a<00:04:13.950> matter<00:04:13.980> off<00:04:15.080> and<00:04:16.080> starting<00:04:16.500> it
