00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:14.080
 there was a firmware and we are 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.869
 at the ifa 2013 this time in the so 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.369
 said international well that is the 

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:20.380
 funny hall 26 in the very many 

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:23.260
 small Chinese and other Asian 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:25.480
 company and I'm at the moment 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:27.730
 company super trap a few pretty 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.869
 we have interesting mockups here 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.670
 Once again, not quite done 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:33.160
 to finish the equipment to the fair 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:35.290
 what lies ahead is here 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:38.830
 product for a 58 inch full hd 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:41.610
 smartphone and a 5 inch also possible 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:43.720
 kohl hd is just happy for now 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.850
 smartphone one is so one 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.640
 only three in the style of the galaxy s 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:52.059
 or only two or in that direction 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:55.420
 very big as says full hd scheduled 

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:57.790
 a 13 megapixel camera get eight 

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:59.680
 megabyte 8 megapixel on the from up there 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.970
 there is a led flash and so on and so on 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.130
 on 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:06.220
 ips panel is thought to be the device 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:09.010
 at the end with a price of about 350 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.420
 come to 400 euros in the trade if 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:11.950
 it is because a customer finds 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.010
 Of course, have yourself in these companies 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.850
 always difficult the devices too 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.380
 to bring europe 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.660
 next to it we have the other colleagues 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.130
 that is a 5 inch device as I said 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:24.610
 full hd resp 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.680
 June provided very flat you can 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:31.030
 but compare it very briefly 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:32.740
 the one up here is a huawei smp 6 with 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.030
 its six millimeters or just short 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:38.140
 six and a half or somehow so close 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:41.110
 under 6 mm the supertalent model with 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.620
 five inches is scarce 7 mm thick likely 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.970
 So also be very compact 

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:47.680
 The model comes with a 1600 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.360
 milliamp batteries in this form 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.860
 therefore coming is of course a bit 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.869
 very small but i have the colleague 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.310
 already said more battery is at the 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:56.800
 Customer always better but what actually 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.259
 really interesting is that this 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.360
 Devices are a few of the first smartphones 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:04.090
 and third-party tablets 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.190
 become the one exynos five samsung 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.750
 course will have in it is so 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:10.119
 with the small one can either with 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:13.239
 the 44 12 so the old quadcore 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:16.420
 Expect the galaxy s3 and the big one 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:20.410
 super great comes in any case with the 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:21.940
 Exynos potter and in order to 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.739
 The colleagues already have evidence here 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.390
 the right mainboard with you 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:27.880
 it does not stop in the 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.040
 and the shape of a smart phone being poured 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.690
 and if he looks closely and mine 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.370
 he sees the camera to catch the catch 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.610
 there he is definitely the samsung 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:38.560
 exynos factor at the bottom left is 54 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.350
 So 10 is the older model too 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:44.280
 in the galaxy s 4 is 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:45.720
 and the motherboard for the big one 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.370
 device is thought then sitting 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.050
 probably like that here now 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.820
 looks 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:52.770
 somewhere down here I guess 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.190
 I think so had the whole installed 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:55.190
 become 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.840
 which already contains the lips small 

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:00.160
 outlook on what they contain 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.830
 so we'll have that singles one 

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.860
 micro sd cards slot and there a micro 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:08.170
 usb port and then to come stop 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:11.770
 the usual other details such as 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:13.360
 example in 2gb ram chips and so on 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:17.320
 as I said that it was one of the first 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:20.050
 devices with the seed are exactly 54 10 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:24.010
 that will come from third party manufacturers 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:26.650
 the super trap 58 inch tablet and a 50 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.940
 inch model then within the 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.440
 next week already in the form of 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.940
 hardware should be present if so 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.100
 colleague who somehow happens to be 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.240
 just stay in spain because after that 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.680
 then he wants to look out 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:38.190
 soon probably find it there 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.190
 Many Thanks
