um<00:00:00.269> how<00:00:00.750> important<00:00:01.260> is<00:00:01.350> it<00:00:01.380> for<00:00:01.589> Intel<00:00:02.190> to<00:00:02.879> be

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090 
um how important is it for Intel to be

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.420 
um how important is it for Intel to be
in<00:00:03.360> some<00:00:03.659> place<00:00:03.810> you<00:00:04.529> know<00:00:04.650> smartphones

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
in some place you know smartphones

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.210 
in some place you know smartphones
really<00:00:05.759> are<00:00:05.879> can't<00:00:06.330> help<00:00:06.509> computers<00:00:06.839> and<00:00:07.259> as

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:08.220 
really are can't help computers and as

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.780 
really are can't help computers and as
such<00:00:08.550> Intel<00:00:09.980> so<00:00:10.980> it's<00:00:11.099> just<00:00:11.160> naturally<00:00:11.700> were

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
such Intel so it's just naturally were

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.070 
such Intel so it's just naturally were
there<00:00:11.969> it's<00:00:12.210> very<00:00:12.269> important<00:00:12.870> for<00:00:12.960> our<00:00:12.990> future

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
there it's very important for our future

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.400 
there it's very important for our future
that<00:00:13.500> we<00:00:14.120> I<00:00:15.120> think<00:00:15.240> it's<00:00:15.509> taken<00:00:15.719> you<00:00:15.809> a<00:00:16.080> long

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
that we I think it's taken you a long

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.580 
that we I think it's taken you a long
time<00:00:16.680> to<00:00:16.830> get<00:00:16.980> that<00:00:17.449> well<00:00:18.449> you<00:00:18.960> know<00:00:19.080> it's<00:00:19.350> um

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
time to get that well you know it's um

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:20.990 
time to get that well you know it's um
it<00:00:19.740> turns<00:00:19.890> out<00:00:20.100> that<00:00:20.310> doing<00:00:20.670> a<00:00:20.760> handheld

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
it turns out that doing a handheld

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.359 
it turns out that doing a handheld
device<00:00:21.090> is<00:00:21.449> very<00:00:21.480> difficult<00:00:21.900> and<00:00:22.369> not

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
device is very difficult and not

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:24.920 
device is very difficult and not
everybody<00:00:23.970> can<00:00:24.090> do<00:00:24.180> it<00:00:24.210> we<00:00:24.539> have<00:00:24.689> all<00:00:24.810> the

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
everybody can do it we have all the

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.050 
everybody can do it we have all the
pieces<00:00:25.109> we<00:00:25.320> need<00:00:25.500> in-house<00:00:25.769> we<00:00:26.699> just<00:00:26.880> need<00:00:27.029> a

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
pieces we need in-house we just need a

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.120 
pieces we need in-house we just need a
little<00:00:27.150> bit<00:00:27.300> better<00:00:27.420> focus<00:00:27.779> so<00:00:28.260> the<00:00:29.010> only

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
little bit better focus so the only

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.830 
little bit better focus so the only
difference<00:00:29.279> right<00:00:29.910> now<00:00:29.970> really<00:00:30.300> is<00:00:30.420> we've<00:00:30.660> put

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
difference right now really is we've put

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.139 
difference right now really is we've put
together<00:00:30.960> a<00:00:31.140> world-class<00:00:31.380> team<00:00:31.800> of<00:00:31.949> people

00:00:32.139 --> 00:00:32.149

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
obviously all chip makers are going to

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.420 
obviously all chip makers are going to
base<00:00:58.350> that<00:00:58.590> they<00:00:58.710> have<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:58.980> best<00:00:59.010> phone

that's the fastest phone there will be a

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.680 
that's the fastest phone there will be a
new<00:01:01.980> fastest<00:01:02.489> better<00:01:02.730> than<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.059> few<00:01:03.239> months

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
new fastest better than a few months

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.510 
new fastest better than a few months
what<00:01:04.320> would<00:01:04.739> differentiate<00:01:05.189> in<00:01:05.700> cell<00:01:06.000> phone

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
what would differentiate in cell phone

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.740 
what would differentiate in cell phone
well<00:01:08.520> you<00:01:08.549> know<00:01:08.670> it's<00:01:08.820> not<00:01:08.939> about<00:01:09.090> fastest

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
well you know it's not about fastest

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.690 
well you know it's not about fastest
it's<00:01:10.080> about<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.680> user<00:01:10.830> experience<00:01:10.920> I<00:01:11.549> mean

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
it's about the user experience I mean

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.010 
it's about the user experience I mean
what<00:01:11.880> really<00:01:12.030> counts<00:01:12.299> at<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.630> end<00:01:12.720> of<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.840> day

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
what really counts at the end of the day

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.300 
what really counts at the end of the day
is<00:01:13.229> what<00:01:13.380> people<00:01:13.650> can<00:01:13.770> do<00:01:13.890> with<00:01:13.979> your<00:01:14.159> phone

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
is what people can do with your phone

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.770 
is what people can do with your phone
exactly<00:01:18.080> what<00:01:19.080> would<00:01:19.170> be<00:01:19.259> the<00:01:19.530> purchasing<00:01:20.040> it

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
exactly what would be the purchasing it

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.499 
exactly what would be the purchasing it
I'd<00:01:21.780> say<00:01:22.140> it<00:01:22.170> does<00:01:22.380> I'd<00:01:22.619> say<00:01:22.830> that<00:01:23.509> we're

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
I'd say it does I'd say that we're

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:25.820 
I'd say it does I'd say that we're
building<00:01:24.750> things<00:01:24.960> into<00:01:25.229> the<00:01:25.320> silicon<00:01:25.680> it's

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
building things into the silicon it's

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.670 
building things into the silicon it's
not<00:01:25.950> just<00:01:26.159> about<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.880> chip<00:01:27.869> it's<00:01:28.110> about<00:01:28.290> the

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
not just about the chip it's about the

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.499 
not just about the chip it's about the
pieces<00:01:28.950> we<00:01:29.040> build<00:01:29.220> around<00:01:29.280> it<00:01:29.579> we're<00:01:30.270> building

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
pieces we build around it we're building

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:31.999 
pieces we build around it we're building
the<00:01:30.600> capability<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.140> play<00:01:31.350> high-definition

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
the capability to play high-definition

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.950 
the capability to play high-definition
video<00:01:32.189> that<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:32.670> very<00:01:32.909> very<00:01:33.360> power<00:01:33.540> efficient

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
video that a very very power efficient

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.120 
video that a very very power efficient
weighing<00:01:34.079> so<00:01:34.200> you'll<00:01:34.350> play<00:01:34.439> video<00:01:34.799> for<00:01:34.979> a<00:01:35.009> long

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
weighing so you'll play video for a long

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.370 
weighing so you'll play video for a long
time<00:01:35.310> we're<00:01:36.150> building<00:01:36.479> camera<00:01:36.869> features<00:01:37.200> in

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
time we're building camera features in

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.039 
time we're building camera features in
that'll<00:01:37.829> let<00:01:37.920> you<00:01:37.950> do<00:01:38.600> motion<00:01:39.600> motion

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
that'll let you do motion motion

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.660 
that'll let you do motion motion
consultations<00:01:40.740> so<00:01:40.890> anti-shake<00:01:41.670> for<00:01:42.150> video

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670 
consultations so anti-shake for video

into<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.320> chip<00:01:47.689> something<00:01:48.689> that<00:01:48.780> someone<00:01:49.020> has

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
into the chip something that someone has

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.050 
into the chip something that someone has
to<00:01:49.320> know<00:01:49.710> so<00:01:49.950> they<00:01:49.979> just<00:01:50.310> be<00:01:50.430> pumped<00:01:50.759> I<00:01:50.820> know<00:01:50.939> in

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
to know so they just be pumped I know in

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.700 
to know so they just be pumped I know in
fact<00:01:51.210> that's<00:01:51.360> key<00:01:51.630> you<00:01:51.810> know<00:01:51.930> hardware<00:01:52.530> and

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
fact that's key you know hardware and

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.319 
fact that's key you know hardware and
software<00:01:52.920> working<00:01:53.490> in<00:01:53.549> combination<00:01:54.090> is<00:01:54.210> what

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
software working in combination is what

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.569 
software working in combination is what
makes<00:01:54.509> a<00:01:54.600> great<00:01:54.780> device<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.860> you<00:01:56.070> can't<00:01:56.280> start

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
makes a great device and you can't start

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:57.740 
makes a great device and you can't start
with<00:01:56.729> hardware<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.090> then<00:01:57.240> figure<00:01:57.509> out<00:01:57.630> what

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
with hardware and then figure out what

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.149 
with hardware and then figure out what
to<00:01:57.840> do<00:01:57.960> with<00:01:58.079> it<00:01:58.170> you<00:01:58.350> have<00:01:58.680> to<00:01:58.770> start<00:01:59.009> with<00:01:59.070> an

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
to do with it you have to start with an

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:01.429 
to do with it you have to start with an
idea<00:01:59.460> and<00:01:59.790> then<00:02:00.090> build<00:02:00.360> both<00:02:00.750> in<00:02:00.930> concert<00:02:01.320> to

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
idea and then build both in concert to

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.020 
idea and then build both in concert to
work<00:02:01.560> well<00:02:01.710> together<00:02:01.860> and<00:02:02.460> that's<00:02:02.610> what<00:02:02.729> we<00:02:02.850> do

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
work well together and that's what we do

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.130 
work well together and that's what we do
Shalini<00:02:04.020> told<00:02:04.380> me

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
Shalini told me

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.840 
Shalini told me
yeah<00:02:05.350> but<00:02:05.620> obviously<00:02:05.920> having<00:02:06.130> an<00:02:06.370> intel-based

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
yeah but obviously having an intel-based

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.660 
yeah but obviously having an intel-based
portable<00:02:07.510> device<00:02:08.039> it's<00:02:09.039> great<00:02:09.429> because

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
portable device it's great because

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.030 
portable device it's great because
windows<00:02:10.270> works<00:02:10.570> much<00:02:10.869> better<00:02:10.899> with<00:02:11.470> Intel<00:02:11.830> and

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
windows works much better with Intel and

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.360 
windows works much better with Intel and
has<00:02:12.250> done<00:02:12.460> for<00:02:12.910> many<00:02:13.000> years<00:02:13.150> yes<00:02:13.750> so<00:02:14.560> can<00:02:15.220> you
