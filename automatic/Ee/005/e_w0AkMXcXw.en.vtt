00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:48.490
 then giorgia today I found one 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.320
 big red motorcycle a motorcycle from 

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:52.780
 Competition is not what you love 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:56.560
 more, however, it is such a chapter 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:59.350
 I say important and exciting 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:02.650
 then an Italian motorcycle is a weapon that is 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.930
 a 250 has a past boasts a past 

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.650
 very important in the world of 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.530
 competitions 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:10.450
 so this model is a 250 and is 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:13.990
 was produced in 1967 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:17.200
 however the history of the maquis la 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:22.360
 gold starts some years before 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:25.150
 in 1957 and a talented technical alfredo 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:29.350
 whites in force precisely to lerma that 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:31.330
 designed together with a design that is 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:35.290
 the count became extremely famous 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:37.690
 revelli ought to beaumont the bags 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:42.220
 chimera for mike i kymera was a 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:45.369
 Air Mag transition from half-time to 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:48.100
 four times with engine always made in 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:50.080
 this horizontal way of 175 of 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.200
 displacement to be very short then 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.720
 the following year of 21250 always team 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:02:00.100
 was then began the series of wings 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:03.580
 from the white 175 the red 250 then 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.380
 followed the green the blue one one 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:08.500
 extremely lucky series that has 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:11.530
 then brought the aermacchi to the levels that 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.390
 everyone knew the success that it is 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.920
 was decreed on this type of 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.840
 motorbike was primarily due to 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.060
 to private riders who have it 

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:23.130
 abundantly used in the various 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:25.950
 classes both 250 and 50 precisely because 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:30.580
 he was trustworthy and extremely tough 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:32.580
 economical and naturally manageable as 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.520
 spare parts because you know that 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:38.040
 motorcycles can and should 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.810
 absolutely have spare parts from 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.020
 use to change in the various 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:45.570
 events and this motorcycle 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:48.840
 in particular it gave satisfaction to 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:51.510
 all the pilots who used it 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:54.510
 because in the first lower classes then 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:57.120
 in the upper classes until how 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:59.850
 actor arrive at age 35 43 and 50 at 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.130
 gold than level 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:04.200
 let's say so European was a prerogative 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:07.380
 all private runners because he has 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:10.350
 had an incredible success of its own 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:14.330
 for this reason it is extremely parking 

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:17.880
 in consumption, management costs are not 

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:20.880
 impossible purchase price than in 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:23.400
 this case of the motorcycle that 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.170
 we are examining that it is a 250 gold wing 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.630
 in 1967 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:29.880
 the price to the public was 690 thousand lire 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:32.880
 which was complete with fairing and the 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:35.989
 carburetor 35 ss in this case on the 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:39.180
 this motorcycle that was in part 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:43.070
 we say so updated to the model 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:45.300
 next was further 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:47.489
 increased the carburetor because i 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:51.410
 carburetors at a 38 ss 

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:54.540
 while the tires have gone from 275 to 18 

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:58.560
 rear and a 250 18 front to a 3 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:04:01.590
 0 0 18 front and a 325 18 rear 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:04.320
 for which like speed 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.510
 this model reached over 200 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.790
 kilometers per hour hull with the hull 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.800
 obviously how many marches change the 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:16.320
 engine power therefore the power of the 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:22.290
 engine is quite manageable in 35 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:24.720
 horses at 10,000 rpm the change was 5 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:27.979
 marches like frame we said that a 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:31.860
 frame in tubes equipped with fork 

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:34.200
 wheels and brakes all Ceriani for one thing 

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:36.300
 important this motorcycle is the 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:40.740
 fortieth produced of the 118 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:44.340
 build the pilots who have had way 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:45.470
 to use this renzo type motorcycle 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:48.080
 pasolini 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:51.050
 are bergamonti victory brambilla the 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:52.720
 world champion dieter braun angel 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:56.540
 tenconi who was Italian champion 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:58.760
 it is not known for how many times of races in 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:01.450
 Campiano mountain climb 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:04.520
 alberto pagani giberto milani for which 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:06.710
 this this motorcycle has 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:10.460
 represented mainly in the class 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:13.670
 250 a point of arrival for those who do not 

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.390
 They were obviously in families and for pilots 

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:18.610
 private 

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:22.940
 but we must say that also in 1966 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:27.740
 Bobby won the foster tt so in 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:29.690
 lightweight accordingly another 

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:32.210
 another pearl to add to the over 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:33.830
 200 victories that have been made 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:37.280
 worldwide 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:39.830
 7 July 1968 in the third test 

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:42.070
 of the European mountain championship a 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:44.600
 mendrisio that is the generous mountain 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:47.690
 mike had been invited with his honda 

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:49.370
 6 cylinders and of course it was given for 

00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:52.010
 assumed that he won them because in short 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:55.240
 mike hailwood was not just the legend 

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:57.919
 he was a trump card for an ace 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:01.190
 unfortunately he found two pilots 

00:05:57.919 --> 00:06:04.100
 official golden 250 course 

00:06:01.190 --> 00:06:06.050
 walter langhe and angel tenconi that 

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:08.030
 we have already listed before and sitting 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:10.240
 be content to finish third were 

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:14.570
 entered the company at 50 percent 

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:18.320
 aermacchi and harley davidson in 1960 then 

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:21.580
 then the company absolutely absolutely 

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:25.790
 absorbed by harley davidson 

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:30.560
 important in 1971 villiam soncini 

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:34.330
 yet he was to see the sports actor 

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:37.340
 he designs two-stroke machines 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:38.930
 twin cylinders that began to be 

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:44.570
 tested by renzo pasolini 

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:47.090
 unfortunately in 1973 with the tragedy of 

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:48.800
 monza well let's say so investigated by the 

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:50.930
 part of the commission as 

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:53.280
 project manager e 

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:55.840
 as well as 

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:58.600
 responsible for let's say so 

00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:01.590
 aermacchi team harley davidson i 

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:04.390
 brothers castiglioni cagiva later 

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:07.540
 absorbed what remained of it 

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:08.890
 end of the 70s thanks also to you 

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:10.690

00:07:08.890 --> 00:07:12.850
