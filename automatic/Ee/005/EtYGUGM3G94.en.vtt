00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:22.800
 the friezin is waiting for a hell of a job because people from Eindhoven have to put things right 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.839
 after the zeperd against FC Groningen 

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:29.529
 PSV still has a chance to win the champions league 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:33.329
 Heerenveen can now forget about direct placement for European football 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.909
 a place in the playoffs that seems to be the highest attainable in Friesland North 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.580

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.040
 a third of the crosses came from the base of the capricious rotterdammers 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:12.640
 Van La Parra can be proud of that, but he can also compete with the masked 

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.880
 winger of psv who they are nice to see why the parade itself 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.540

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.460

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:49.500
