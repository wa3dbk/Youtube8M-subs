00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:02.860
 the water level of the Yenisei rises to 8 meters (in Dudinka), the whole 

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:03.860
 a mass of drifting ice begins to crawl to the shore, 

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:04.860
 and since fast ice more than a meter thick, 

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:05.860
 how creepy bulldozer makes all that is not cleaned 

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:06.860
 (cranes, beams) and not covered with gravel (rails) 

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:07.860
 Yenisei refers to the type of rivers mixed food 

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:08.860
 with a predominance of snow. 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:09.860
 The share of the latter is slightly less than 50%, rainwater 36-38 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:10.860
 %, underground in the upper reaches up to 16%, to the lower reaches it decreases. 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:11.860
 The freezing of the Yenisei begins in the lower reaches (early October) 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:12.860
 . Intensive education is characteristic of the Yenisei. 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:13.860
 intrawater ice, autumn drift. 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:14.860
 Ice age in the lower reaches from the end of October, in the middle of November 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:15.860
 in the middle reaches of Krasnoyarsk and at the end of November - December 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:16.860
 in the mountainous part. 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:17.860
 In some areas in the streamway powerful 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:18.860
 frost 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:19.860
 For the most part of the Yenisei, the stretched 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:20.860
 spring flood and summer floods, in winter a sharp decline 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:21.860
 drain. The upper reaches are characterized by stretched spring-summer 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:22.860
 flood 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:23.860
 The flood on the Yenisei begins in May, sometimes in April, on 

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:24.860
 the average Yenisey is somewhat earlier than on the upper 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:25.860
 in the bottom in the middle of May - the beginning of June. 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:26.860
 Spring break-up is accompanied by congestion. 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:27.860
 The range of fluctuations of the level of the Yenisei in the upper reaches of 5-7 m 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:28.860
 in extensions and 15–16 m in constrictions, in the lower reaches 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:29.860
 it is larger (28 m at Kureika), decreases to the mouth (11.7 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:30.860
 m at Ust-Port). 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:31.860
 The rivers of the Krasnoyarsk region will clear of ice before 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:32.860
 ordinary 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:33.860
 The rivers of the Krasnoyarsk Territory will be cleared of ice for several 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:34.860
 weeks earlier, the deputy head said April 1 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:35.860
 Krasnoyarsk Hydrological Forecast Department 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:36.860
 Hydrometeorological Center Ivan Gordeev. 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:37.860
 According to him, despite the fact that in general, in winter 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:38.860
 more snow than usual, almost snow 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:39.860
 immediately melted. 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:40.860
 So, in the central and southern areas of precipitation was - half 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:41.860
 or almost within it, in the mountains of the south of the region and in Kansk 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:42.860
 group of areas - a little more than the norm. 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:43.860
 Currently, the snow on the plains is almost completely 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:44.860
 gone, remaining only in the forests and foothills. 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:45.860
 The only area where snowfall continues 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:46.860
 - The northern part of the region. 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:47.860
 Here, some stations have accumulated record 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:48.860
 the amount of snow, on average, the reserves do not exceed 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:49.860
 one and a half norms. 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:50.860
 The ice throughout the Yenisei basin this year was thinner by 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:51.860
 10-20 cm than usual, which will contribute to a calmer 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:52.860
 the passage of the flood. 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:53.860
 Based on the weather conditions, hydrologists promise that 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:54.860
 autopsy of the southern tributaries of the Yenisei - Abakan, Upper 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:55.860
 Yenisei, Tuba, Kana will be held much earlier than usual 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:56.860
 deadlines. 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:57.860
 “We believe that by April 15 these rivers should completely 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:58.860
 clear of ice. 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:59.860
 Currently, some rivers have already opened, for example, 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:00.860
 at the end of March, Oya and Kebezh near the villages of Yermakovskoe 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:01.860
 and Grigorievka. 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:02.860
 This was never recorded for the entire observation period, 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:03.860
 This is an extremely early date. 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:04.860
 Today the ice drift on the Tuba River near Kuragino just went. 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:05.860
 This is also 17 days earlier than usual. 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:06.860
 The exit of ice from Mana to Yenisei is expected within 10-12 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:07.860
 April, the opening of the Yenisei near Yeniseisk will occur 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:08.860
 by washing and is expected around April 11, ”explained 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:09.860
 Ivan Gordeev. 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:10.860
 As for ice jams that can provoke 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:11.860
 rise of water and flooding of settlements, 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:12.860
 considers residents of the southern districts of the region not to be afraid of them, 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:13.860
 specialist: ice has already melted in some places and will not resist 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:14.860
 spring water pressure. 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:15.860
 Trouble can only bring northern rivers and 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:16.860
 the Yenisei itself is the mouth of the Podkamennaya Tunguska, almost the whole of the Lower 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:17.860
 Tunguska and Yenisei in the Yartsevo district. 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:18.860
 “As for the flood, in the southern regions of the water's edge 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:19.860
 will be less than usual, but in the north the maximum 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:20.860
 water levels on the Yenisei will be approximately 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:21.860
 at the same time with the ice drift, therefore, flooding is not excluded 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:22.860
 settlements along the coast. 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:23.860
 The same situation will be on Podkamennaya Tunguska, 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:24.860
 and also on the left bank tributaries - the rivers Kas and 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:25.860
 Sym ", - said Ivan Gordeev. 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:26.860
 Slightly stabilizes the situation in the north of Boguchanskaya 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:27.860
 HPS - due to the accumulation of the reservoir is now in 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:28.860
 the lower pool gets about half of all water 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:29.860
 stocks, relative to what was in previous years. 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:30.860
 If such discharges persist in April, it is beneficial. 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:31.860
 will affect the passage of the flood on the Angara and on 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:32.860
 Yenisey below Arrows. 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:33.860
 As for the rivers flowing in Krasnoyarsk, 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:34.860
 this year troubles from Kachi and Bugach not wait 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:35.860
 worth it. 

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:36.860
 Thanks to the work to strengthen the coast 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.100
 Kachi she has become almost safe, the specialist concluded. 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.350
 The city of Lesosibirsk is founded and arrives as 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.350
 cities since 1975. 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.909
 The city belongs to the Far North and is located 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:53.330
 on the territory of the Yenisei district. 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.570
 Lesosibirsk is located on the banks of the Yenisei River in 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:03.630
 275 kilometers from Krasnoyarsk and 40 kilometers from the Angara. 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.479
 The population is 64 thousand people, the city is 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.720
 the largest center of forest chemistry and lumbering due to 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.750
 being close to extensive forest belts. 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:18.780
 The city imposes an advantageous geographical position 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.420
 in terms of transport, railway 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.450
 connects Lesosibirsk with the Trans-Siberian Railway, 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.480
 which looks very cost effective. 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.720
 Proximity to the Yenisei River gives the city a significant 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.570
 plus in terms of using river resources as 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:41.810
 trade relations between the adjacent areas. 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.060
 Having access to the federal highway "Baikal", having 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.090
 appointment of the most powerful port, Lesosibirsk looks 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.330
 as the most economically advantageous area in terms of 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:57.569
 shipments from one point to another. 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:01.810
 Having such a significant plus as an excellent transport 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.450
 node, Lesosibirsk included in the project of the North-Siberian 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:06.660
 railway line. 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.900
 In addition, the city of Lesosibirsk is a free haven. 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.150
 both for Muslim people and 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:18.780
 for Baptists and for Christians. 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:23.020
 The city has several palaces of culture, urban 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:27.269
 exhibition hall, local history museum of the forest, 2 art 

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:31.510
 and 3 music schools, more than ten libraries. 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.150
 There are such folk ensembles as "Freckles", 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:41.209
 "Patterns", dance theater "Miracles", as well as the folk choir of veterans 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:42.209
 "Ivushka". 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:46.599
 In Lesosibirsk, there is also quite extensive 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:50.250
 union of artists which through collective work 

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.910
 publishes its own collections and author publications. 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:58.170
 There are two theaters in Lesosibirsk - one dramatic 

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:59.990
 and one youth.
