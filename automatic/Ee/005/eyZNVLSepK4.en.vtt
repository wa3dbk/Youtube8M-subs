the<00:01:45.570> spot<00:01:45.840> your<00:01:46.500> mousepad<00:01:46.740> will<00:01:47.100> get<00:01:47.280> wet<00:01:47.460> but

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
the spot your mousepad will get wet but

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.120 
the spot your mousepad will get wet but
it's<00:01:47.820> okay<00:01:48.150> just<00:01:48.600> don't<00:01:48.990> do<00:01:49.410> it<00:01:49.440> too<00:01:49.890> hard

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
it's okay just don't do it too hard

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.360 
it's okay just don't do it too hard
because<00:01:50.940> if<00:01:51.180> you<00:01:51.210> press<00:01:51.960> too<00:01:52.290> hard<00:01:52.320> or<00:01:52.980> if<00:01:53.220> you

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:53.370 
because if you press too hard or if you

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:55.880 
because if you press too hard or if you
move<00:01:53.520> too<00:01:53.790> fast<00:01:54.090> or<00:01:54.510> circular<00:01:55.290> motions<00:01:55.710> you'll

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
move too fast or circular motions you'll

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.470 
move too fast or circular motions you'll
probably<00:01:56.160> end<00:01:56.520> up<00:01:56.640> damaging<00:01:56.910> the<00:01:57.240> cloth

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:57.480 
probably end up damaging the cloth

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:58.550 
probably end up damaging the cloth
finish<00:01:57.870> on<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.110> mousepad

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
finish on the mousepad

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.450 
finish on the mousepad
and<00:01:59.510> that's<00:02:00.510> not<00:02:00.930> good<00:02:01.200> for<00:02:01.230> gaming<00:02:01.590> am<00:02:02.370> i

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
and that's not good for gaming am i

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.840 
and that's not good for gaming am i
right<00:02:02.700> so<00:02:03.510> I<00:02:03.890> don't<00:02:04.890> know<00:02:05.130> if<00:02:05.340> you<00:02:05.490> can<00:02:05.610> see

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850

wet spot here now

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.380 
wet spot here now
so<00:02:10.200> now<00:02:11.200> any<00:02:11.860> other<00:02:12.070> little<00:02:12.370> areas<00:02:12.790> oh<00:02:12.940> maybe<00:02:13.270> I

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390

mmm<00:02:16.480> up<00:02:16.660> here<00:02:16.990> looks<00:02:17.230> like<00:02:17.350> it<00:02:17.590> could<00:02:17.740> use<00:02:17.770> a

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:17.920 
mmm up here looks like it could use a

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.000 
mmm up here looks like it could use a
little<00:02:18.010> bit<00:02:18.340> okay<00:02:18.930> those<00:02:19.930> pads<00:02:20.260> all<00:02:20.500> clean<00:02:20.800> no

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
little bit okay those pads all clean no

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.890 
little bit okay those pads all clean no
now<00:02:21.670> what<00:02:21.790> you're<00:02:21.940> going<00:02:22.030> to<00:02:22.090> do<00:02:22.270> is<00:02:22.480> let<00:02:22.810> your

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
now what you're going to do is let your

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.020 
now what you're going to do is let your
mousepad<00:02:23.080> dry<00:02:23.530> doesn't<00:02:24.070> take<00:02:24.220> too<00:02:24.460> long<00:02:24.490> you

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
mousepad dry doesn't take too long you

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.460 
mousepad dry doesn't take too long you
can<00:02:25.150> actually<00:02:25.360> use<00:02:25.810> your<00:02:25.930> mousepad

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
can actually use your mousepad

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.340 
can actually use your mousepad
while<00:02:26.980> it's<00:02:27.280> still<00:02:27.850> drying<00:02:28.360> I'd<00:02:28.959> recommend

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:29.350 
while it's still drying I'd recommend

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:31.440 
while it's still drying I'd recommend
not<00:02:29.650> to<00:02:29.709> though<00:02:30.220> just<00:02:30.820> in<00:02:30.910> case<00:02:30.970> you've<00:02:31.270> got

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
not to though just in case you've got

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:33.060 
not to though just in case you've got
something<00:02:31.840> on<00:02:31.930> your<00:02:32.110> mouth<00:02:32.350> that<00:02:32.650> might<00:02:32.860> end

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.070 
something on your mouth that might end

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.730 
something on your mouth that might end
up<00:02:33.250> messing<00:02:33.459> up<00:02:33.790> the<00:02:33.910> mousepad<00:02:34.120> I<00:02:34.570> keep<00:02:35.560> mine

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740 
up messing up the mousepad I keep mine

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.199 
up messing up the mousepad I keep mine
necessarily<00:02:36.310> clean<00:02:36.550> though<00:02:36.700> on<00:02:36.790> the<00:02:36.880> bottom

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
necessarily clean though on the bottom

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:39.330 
necessarily clean though on the bottom
so<00:02:37.450> I'm<00:02:38.050> not<00:02:38.230> too<00:02:38.410> worried<00:02:38.680> about<00:02:38.770> that<00:02:39.130> you

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
so I'm not too worried about that you

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.610 
so I'm not too worried about that you
can<00:02:39.490> go<00:02:39.610> right<00:02:39.790> back<00:02:39.820> to<00:02:40.030> gaming<00:02:40.630> as<00:02:41.170> long<00:02:41.410> as

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
can go right back to gaming as long as

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.560 
can go right back to gaming as long as
you<00:02:41.770> haven't<00:02:41.980> like<00:02:42.370> you<00:02:42.520> know<00:02:42.670> what<00:02:43.420> the

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:43.570 
you haven't like you know what the

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:46.890 
you haven't like you know what the
entire<00:02:43.930> mousepad<00:02:44.590> I<00:02:45.520> do<00:02:46.330> not<00:02:46.570> recommend

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
ended up messing up the finish a tiny

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:22.680 
ended up messing up the finish a tiny
bit<00:03:21.130> not<00:03:21.400> that<00:03:21.700> big<00:03:21.970> of<00:03:22.000> a<00:03:22.150> deal<00:03:22.360> though

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
bit not that big of a deal though

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:26.160 
bit not that big of a deal though
but<00:03:23.290> the<00:03:23.410> big<00:03:23.830> problem<00:03:24.580> with<00:03:24.700> it<00:03:24.880> is<00:03:25.060> the<00:03:25.870> cloth

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
but the big problem with it is the cloth

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.520 
but the big problem with it is the cloth
started<00:03:26.709> coming<00:03:27.070> up<00:03:27.190> from<00:03:27.489> the<00:03:27.549> backing<00:03:27.940> and

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
started coming up from the backing and

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.080 
started coming up from the backing and
it<00:03:29.530> actually<00:03:29.709> peels<00:03:30.100> away<00:03:30.250> quite<00:03:30.640> easily<00:03:30.670> I

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
it actually peels away quite easily I

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.229 
it actually peels away quite easily I
shouldn't<00:03:31.480> do<00:03:31.600> that<00:03:31.780> anymore<00:03:32.049> and<00:03:32.850> the<00:03:33.850> corner

00:03:34.229 --> 00:03:34.239 
shouldn't do that anymore and the corner

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:38.970 
shouldn't do that anymore and the corner
