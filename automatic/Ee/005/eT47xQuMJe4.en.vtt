00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:19.360
 Hah! 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:41.590
 Mystery of the Special Dragonfly 

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:44.650
 Welcome to the venue where the upstream looked up 

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:48.040
 It came from all over the world in this back 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:52.329
 Many wing dragons are waiting for you 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:57.940
 Work that I was looking forward to all the time 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:01:02.570
 There are plenty of famous detains such as Pteranodon and Lanforinx . 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:07.760
 Was found was found brother Hayakumi Koyo 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:13.840
 I am looking forward to discovering the secrets of the pterosaurs. 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:13.840
 So Super Ju into the venue 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.800
 here we go 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:23.170
 First, let's see what kind of creature the detention was 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:26.740
 What kind of ability was there to fly in the sky 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:31.149
 Well there is a huge wing 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:36.020
 Then what was the wing made of? 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:44.719
 It was a thin membrane made of muscle and blood vessels 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:47.800
 The reason why I was flying in the sky with a large wing that stretched this membrane between my arms and legs 

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:52.659
 Yeah Ne is similar to Homori 

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:57.220
 But even with wings I can not fly if my body is heavy 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:02:04.540
 The ridge was thin, light and strong 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:05.690
 Furthermore , if you look at the bones of the chest, etc., you can see that a large muscle has been developed to move the wing. 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.289
 The 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:14.800
 An elder sister who is similar to taking something 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:20.410
 The wings of the pterosaurs seem to be like birds and bats, but they look different 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:21.620
 Here we compare each wing so let's take a good look 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.060
 For example 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:32.120
 Pterosaur wing of the name Nai ship 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:34.860
 That will be the fourth ring finger counting from the thumb of our hands 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.790
 Look at the base of a long bone 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:42.310
 I have 3 other fingers 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.310
 I was able to move that ring freely 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:54.770
 Hone of the long wings 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:57.400
 In this way, the wings for flying in the sky are different. 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:57.400
 Naa strange 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.910
 n 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.910
 Haa 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:13.740
 tan 

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.880
 ana 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.600
 tan 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.600
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.300
