00:05:47.690 --> 00:05:52.850

00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:00.350
 I'm really curious 

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:02.180
 24 at eleven did not score the best on you 

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:04.070
 but i give i just had a look of it 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:05.600
 18 meters is a litter 

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:07.670
 and teammate who doesn't kill any team it 

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:09.260
 a bait thieme that doesn't notice anything 

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:11.480

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:13.610

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:15.770
 of course that still happens 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:17.300
 I still need fx in the game 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:18.950
 of course it has to get used to him year 

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.140
