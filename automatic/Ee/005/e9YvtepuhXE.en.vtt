gonna be cut out at 1 in 3/4 by 6 and
1/8<00:03:02.970> and<00:03:03.360> then<00:03:04.320> you're<00:03:04.440> gonna<00:03:04.530> have<00:03:04.739> a<00:03:04.770> smaller

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
1/8 and then you're gonna have a smaller

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:07.580 
1/8 and then you're gonna have a smaller
one<00:03:05.400> that's<00:03:05.730> one<00:03:06.090> in<00:03:06.239> three<00:03:06.480> quarters<00:03:06.930> by

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
one that's one in three quarters by

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.560 
one that's one in three quarters by
three<00:03:07.620> and<00:03:08.130> seven<00:03:08.310> eighths<00:03:08.640> now<00:03:09.360> we're<00:03:09.480> gonna

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
three and seven eighths now we're gonna

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:13.340 
three and seven eighths now we're gonna
go<00:03:09.780> ahead<00:03:09.930> and<00:03:10.350> get<00:03:10.500> our<00:03:10.590> ATG<00:03:11.160> gun<00:03:11.370> and<00:03:12.350> adhere

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:13.350 
go ahead and get our ATG gun and adhere

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:18.979 
go ahead and get our ATG gun and adhere
this<00:03:13.530> down<00:03:16.370> and<00:03:17.370> you're<00:03:17.700> gonna<00:03:17.820> put<00:03:18.150> this<00:03:18.690> one

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
this down and you're gonna put this one

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.380 
this down and you're gonna put this one
of<00:03:19.650> the<00:03:19.709> longer<00:03:20.100> ones<00:03:20.130> so<00:03:20.940> this<00:03:21.060> is<00:03:21.180> what<00:03:21.300> we're

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
of the longer ones so this is what we're

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:22.760 
of the longer ones so this is what we're
going<00:03:21.480> to<00:03:21.540> end<00:03:21.690> up<00:03:21.870> with<00:03:22.020> something<00:03:22.380> like<00:03:22.500> this

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:22.770 
going to end up with something like this

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:26.120 
going to end up with something like this
so<00:03:23.160> on<00:03:23.400> the<00:03:23.520> inside<00:03:24.350> you're<00:03:25.350> gonna<00:03:25.440> put<00:03:25.800> one<00:03:25.980> of

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
so on the inside you're gonna put one of

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.750 
so on the inside you're gonna put one of
your<00:03:26.280> pattern<00:03:26.640> papers<00:03:28.010> and<00:03:29.010> I'm<00:03:29.489> going<00:03:29.640> to<00:03:29.700> do

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
your pattern papers and I'm going to do

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.050 
your pattern papers and I'm going to do
the<00:03:29.850> same<00:03:30.060> thing<00:03:30.330> on<00:03:30.510> the<00:03:30.630> back

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.160 

so<00:03:34.060> there<00:03:34.209> we<00:03:34.300> go<00:03:34.330> we've<00:03:34.569> got<00:03:34.599> the<00:03:34.870> front<00:03:35.110> in

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
so there we go we've got the front in

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:36.690 
so there we go we've got the front in
the<00:03:35.200> back<00:03:35.260> and<00:03:35.709> then<00:03:35.890> we're<00:03:36.040> gonna<00:03:36.130> do<00:03:36.459> since

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
the back and then we're gonna do since

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.280 
the back and then we're gonna do since
this<00:03:36.819> is<00:03:36.940> gonna<00:03:37.060> be<00:03:37.270> flipped<00:03:37.599> forward<00:03:37.959> like

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
this is gonna be flipped forward like

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:55.930 
this is gonna be flipped forward like
this<00:03:38.470> we're<00:03:38.709> gonna<00:03:38.830> put<00:03:39.069> one<00:03:39.099> piece<00:03:39.550> here

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:55.940 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.960 

here<00:03:56.540> we<00:03:56.630> go<00:03:56.720> so<00:03:57.620> it's<00:03:57.740> gonna<00:03:57.860> be<00:03:58.070> folded<00:03:58.520> like

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970 
here we go so it's gonna be folded like

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:01.630 
here we go so it's gonna be folded like
this<00:03:59.240> so<00:03:59.960> you've<00:04:00.110> got<00:04:00.260> it<00:04:00.290> on<00:04:00.470> the<00:04:00.680> back<00:04:01.400> in<00:04:01.550> the

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:01.640 
this so you've got it on the back in the

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:02.890 
this so you've got it on the back in the
front<00:04:01.670> then<00:04:02.120> the<00:04:02.240> next<00:04:02.480> thing<00:04:02.630> that<00:04:02.660> we're

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
front then the next thing that we're

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.500 
front then the next thing that we're
gonna<00:04:02.960> do<00:04:03.320> is<00:04:03.620> we're<00:04:03.980> going<00:04:04.160> to<00:04:04.280> get<00:04:05.270> our

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:05.510 
gonna do is we're going to get our

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:09.850 
gonna do is we're going to get our
one-inch<00:04:06.080> hole<00:04:06.380> punch<00:04:07.720> our<00:04:08.720> circle<00:04:09.140> punch<00:04:09.350> and

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:09.860 
one-inch hole punch our circle punch and

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:11.950 
one-inch hole punch our circle punch and
we're<00:04:10.340> gonna<00:04:10.430> go<00:04:10.700> down<00:04:11.120> and<00:04:11.450> we're<00:04:11.630> gonna<00:04:11.690> on

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:11.960 
we're gonna go down and we're gonna on
