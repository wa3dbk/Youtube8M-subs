00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:10.660
 let's check other widowers with our battery 12 volts 

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:14.229
 here I have my cabales 

00:00:14.229 --> 00:00:17.460
 I have my battery and down is not that big and 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.460
 I can not follow it here but it's two epoch cables 

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:24.109
 if we have a bit of 12 bosh too 

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.050
 va mouche baskets god 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:31.699
 reach to distinguish 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:34.699
 which is negative which is positive 

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.620
 to Cordoba are the refaccionaria to buy sank 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.130
 positive 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.100
 obviously the widowers that you buy 

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:48.100
 of osaka quality after bringing the name of the brand 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.390
 how much is 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.390
 and with red letters you know it's positive 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:58.550
 the same negative look for an attractive name all black letters 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.100
 then you realize which one is negative and with the post-it 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.390
 but it has happened to me that sometimes you go to buy them 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.200
 and they give them to you without any 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.550
 singul without any mark then isis to face then which is positive when I 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:14.970
 remove 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.560
 now let's check 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.560
 which is positive and which negative 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:23.180
 here it is 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.190
 I have put him here 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.380
 red so you realize that this is my battery output 12 volts 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:31.810
 currents 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.210
 then it is negative because this focus the professional 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.960
 but the check 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.800
 I'm going to check out 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.700
 there are those who will learn it contained 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.700
 here does not turn me on 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.810
 there are those who wait for it 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.610
 here if you turn me on 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.410
 then it's coming out 

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:59.410
 positive current current here is positive 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.290
 I get positive current 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.290
 this guy is positive 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.859
 let's do it again 

00:02:09.859 --> 00:02:12.859
 continuity 

00:02:14.679 --> 00:02:17.239
 here it does not come out 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:19.699
 here yes 

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:22.699
 positive this is a positive dialogue 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.069
 now let's check the other 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:34.099
 continuity 

00:02:35.139 --> 00:02:37.399
 here the nasa to then this one 

00:02:37.399 --> 00:02:40.609
 here yes then this is a negative god 

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:41.919
 if they see well 

00:02:41.919 --> 00:02:43.759
 the previous one turns me king 

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:46.459
 We knew that it was positive 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:49.459
 now this turns me on here we know it is 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:50.889
 negative 

00:02:50.889 --> 00:02:53.889
 then this negative would go 

00:02:54.419 --> 00:02:57.419
 and this positive 

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:03.109
 we agree 

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:07.139
 Now we're going to Czech matos rotor as savater equaling pos 

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:10.699
 this does not matter how you put it 100 situation 

00:03:10.699 --> 00:03:13.699
 you have to be positive or negative it's the same 

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:17.149
 no the producer does not have to give 

00:03:17.149 --> 00:03:20.259
 a light like that 

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:23.119
 pretty blue 

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:24.499
 if it gives us a light 

00:03:24.499 --> 00:03:25.979
 red 

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:29.199
 the hill stoyanova load enough 

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:30.639
 you have to give us 

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:33.639
 A) Yes 

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:39.149
 so we hope it's broken it's good 

00:03:39.149 --> 00:03:41.039
 and it will give us 

00:03:41.039 --> 00:03:41.979
 a good pear
