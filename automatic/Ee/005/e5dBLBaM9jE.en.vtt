to<00:01:51.509> understand<00:01:52.200> other<00:01:52.500> ideas<00:01:52.950> about

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
to understand other ideas about

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.850 
to understand other ideas about
interpretation<00:01:54.600> we<00:01:55.200> need<00:01:55.320> to<00:01:55.439> understand

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
interpretation we need to understand

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.709 
interpretation we need to understand
that<00:01:56.009> either<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.430> management<00:01:57.180> and<00:01:57.360> ethics

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
that either the management and ethics

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.180 
that either the management and ethics
and<00:01:58.290> so<00:01:58.770> we've<00:01:59.040> got<00:01:59.219> a

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:00.190 
and so we've got a

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:02.580 
and so we've got a
core<00:02:00.820> courses<00:02:01.270> that<00:02:01.480> speak<00:02:02.020> to<00:02:02.050> the<00:02:02.290> base

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:51.970 
but I think that gives you a sense of
who<00:05:49.190> we<00:05:49.220> are<00:05:49.430> and<00:05:49.550> what<00:05:49.669> we<00:05:49.820> do
