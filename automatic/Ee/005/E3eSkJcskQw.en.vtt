00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.480
 hello everyone and everyone welcome to 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:15.339
 channel of recycling and reuse 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.260
 I am bea 'and I invite you to subscribe to 

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:20.230
 channel so you do not miss any video 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:22.960
 of recycling today we are going to recycle a 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:25.600
 little piece of cloth and some beads that 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:28.830
 we have at home but we do not like it 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:32.679
 as they are either the design or they are 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:34.510
 descaling paint and so on and 

00:00:32.679 --> 00:00:36.249
 more or less big dates that are not 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.469
 as small as they see and sent me more or 

00:00:36.249 --> 00:00:41.199
 the less you see the size we are also going to 

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:42.760
 need another kind of accounts I have 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:44.409
 these are flat but can be 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.999
 any account that you want 

00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:51.339
 be a little showy we will need 

00:00:47.999 --> 00:00:53.289
 rings and key to make a bracelet 

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:56.109
 because what we are going to do also 

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:59.679
 we can use this is optional this 

00:00:56.109 --> 00:01:02.289
 type of pendant 2 that we can also 

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:04.239
 add to the good bracelet we will need 

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:06.990
 thread and needle 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:09.490
 we will need a safety pin 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.310
 we will need wire and you know 

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:15.000
 that this wire is a wire like 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.799
 hardware store we will need some scissors 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.810
 tools to work with wire and 

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:21.729
 it's nothing else we're going to start well 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.799
 the first thing we are going to do is cut 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:27.429
 a piece of cloth that has about 5 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:29.510
 centimeters wide by 25 

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:33.950
 long 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:36.830
 to sew let's take an account of 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.900
 what we have and we are going to put it here 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:41.180
 in the center good you see there the 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:44.930
 locked account and what I'm doing 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:47.690
 is to press here to see where 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:50.480
 I have to leave so that the account 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:53.450
 fit perfectly so here it is 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:55.820
 where will I start to sew we are going to 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.680
 own the entire tree until you reach 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:00.650
 another good side once we have sewn 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:04.400
 let's turn it around for that we're going to 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:06.380
 to use a safety pin we puncture 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:12.319
 only one half the other we have not 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:14.560
 punctured and we're going to get 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.569
 inward 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.330
 then with this we are going to go 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:21.610
 helping so we can turn around the 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.500
 this is what we have done and leave him 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.690
 of the right we can remove the 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.090
 safety pin 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:30.850
 and the next step is to cut a 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:36.390
 piece of wire to which we are going to 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:36.390
 make a ring on the tip 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.689
 and let's put the accounts 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:51.840
 I'm going to make you on the tip 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.150
 another ring so they do not go away 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.890
 the accounts but once we have 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.989
 finished now let's put this 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.939
 inside the plaster we have done for 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:03.239
 that is important that the fabric that 

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:06.180
 we are using is a bit elastic like this 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:08.519
 it can be when we are putting the 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.930
 good accounts once there are the 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:12.629
 accounts all inside we're going to 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:15.359
 distribute them by the strip I will open the 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:19.349
 ring and I'm going to close it inside the 

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:22.740
 another to keep everything inside only 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:26.250
 it's not ready yet 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:28.860
 and ready to use good the following 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:32.820
 step is going to be cut pieces of wire 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:36.330
 about 5 or 6 centimeters that we're going to go 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:38.520
 wrapping in the intermediates between 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.620
 account and account if you want to do 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.470
 this with other material than the 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.870
 Hunger can be a 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:48.380
 a tape or whatever you want 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:52.690
 you can also logically do what I 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.690
 I'll do with wire let's wrap 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:59.530
 and with the tweezers we're going 

00:03:55.150 --> 00:04:00.870
 arranging we cut the ends so that 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:03.490
 do not 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:06.580
 they are going to hurt us 

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:10.360
 and so we're going to continue doing it in the 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:12.040
 middle of the accounts I suggest that this does not 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.990
 it becomes very tight so we can 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.910
 move it in case we have to 

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:19.540
 do it let's take the measure to 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:22.450
 be able to cut the excess wire 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:26.410
 and we do the ring again and that's how it is 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:30.569
 how we would have the bracelet in 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:33.180
 the only principle would be to add 

00:04:30.569 --> 00:04:35.940
 the accounts of the 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:38.520
 of the key to put the key 1 in the 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:41.039
 start and another in the end 

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:44.000
 and if he wants it that simple, 

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:48.569
 I would be ready but as I had told you 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:51.360
 that we need some accounts or 

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:53.780
 songs, then let's decorate it 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.780
 bit 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:05:00.440
 especially if it is for gifts because it is 

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:00.440
 much better if decorated 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:09.960
 come I have put the key 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.910
 and practically there the list would be ready 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:15.000
 bracelet but as I say we are going to 

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:19.320
 add a few more things to decorate 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:22.160
 our our bracelet good if we go to 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:25.440
 put any account for example this 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:27.870
 and to put it on the bracelet we're going to 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:31.910
 cut a piece of wire we make a 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:31.910
 ring at one end 

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:41.490
 we went through it and at the other end 

00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:46.279
 we return to do the same another ring and 

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:46.279
 we would stay like this and here I have several 

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:53.440
 and this we are going to put on the bracelet 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:55.300
 with small rings then in the 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:57.610
 part where they have the unions of 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:06:00.250
 wire let's find him some one a 

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:03.780
 little hole to insert the ring 

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:03.780
 we closed the ring 

00:06:06.169 --> 00:06:12.530
 and there would be a little red sheet 

00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:16.669
 we can do the same with the 

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:18.560
 we are going to take the goiÃ¡s and go 

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:22.520
 looking for some small space that can be 

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:24.349
 you can go long there is that 

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.480
 we have to have is that we have long 

00:06:24.349 --> 00:06:29.510
 already in 

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:31.700
 we put a pendant or the encount that 

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:34.070
 want to put well and that's how we 

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:36.650
 is finally the bracelet we have 

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:40.310
 done on this occasion is a recycling 

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:41.570
 to give me for example I could say 

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:44.860
 what would you do for mother's day 

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:47.319
 a birthday would be pretty good 

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:48.830
 for some friend that you want 

00:06:47.319 --> 00:06:50.780
 give away 

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:53.270
 now we simply have to register 

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:55.280
 bracelet and is now ready Bracelet 

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:57.500
 I hope you liked recycling 

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:59.180
 today I hope you also what 

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:02.180
 do the truth is that it is a very 

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:05.140
 nice and see you in the next video 

00:07:02.180 --> 00:07:05.140
 until next time
