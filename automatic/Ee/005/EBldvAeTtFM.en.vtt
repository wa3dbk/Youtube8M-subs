okay<00:00:14.240> we're<00:00:14.389> gonna<00:00:14.480> take<00:00:14.660> a<00:00:14.719> look<00:00:14.990> at<00:00:26.830> the<00:00:27.830> form

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:28.100 
okay we're gonna take a look at the form

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.939 
okay we're gonna take a look at the form
is<00:00:28.369> a<00:00:28.850> training<00:00:29.660> tool<00:00:29.990> whenever<00:00:30.650> you<00:00:30.800> do<00:00:30.920> a

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:30.949 
is a training tool whenever you do a

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:33.520 
is a training tool whenever you do a
motion<00:00:31.250> it's<00:00:32.239> not<00:00:32.480> going<00:00:32.660> to<00:00:32.750> be<00:00:32.840> exactly<00:00:33.290> like

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
motion it's not going to be exactly like

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.750 
motion it's not going to be exactly like
that<00:00:33.559> when<00:00:33.949> you<00:00:34.070> apply<00:00:34.340> it<00:00:34.489> you<00:00:35.210> have<00:00:35.390> to<00:00:35.600> apply

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:36.760 
that when you apply it you have to apply

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.460 
that when you apply it you have to apply
natural<00:00:37.760> motion<00:00:38.720> to<00:00:38.900> it<00:00:39.050> what<00:00:39.230> would<00:00:39.350> be

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:39.470 
natural motion to it what would be

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.439 
natural motion to it what would be
natural<00:00:40.070> that<00:00:40.340> would<00:00:40.730> make<00:00:40.910> it<00:00:41.059> much<00:00:41.210> more

00:00:41.439 --> 00:00:41.449 
natural that would make it much more

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:43.990 
natural that would make it much more
efficient<00:00:42.379> and<00:00:42.559> much<00:00:42.650> more<00:00:42.800> effective<00:00:43.010> and

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.000 
efficient and much more effective and

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.079 
efficient and much more effective and
just<00:00:44.269> to<00:00:44.420> give<00:00:44.629> a<00:00:44.830> idea<00:00:45.830> in<00:00:46.250> the<00:00:46.580> form<00:00:46.879> you

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:47.089 
just to give a idea in the form you

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:50.259 
just to give a idea in the form you
would<00:00:47.210> have<00:00:47.420> a<00:00:47.780> brush<00:00:48.290> neat<00:00:48.589> palm<00:00:49.580> strike

00:00:50.259 --> 00:00:50.269 
would have a brush neat palm strike

00:00:50.269 --> 00:00:53.049 
would have a brush neat palm strike
something<00:00:50.930> of<00:00:51.170> this<00:00:51.409> nature<00:00:51.760> if<00:00:52.760> you<00:00:52.909> were

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:53.059 
something of this nature if you were

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:55.090 
something of this nature if you were
delivering<00:00:53.540> it<00:00:53.659> to<00:00:53.809> like<00:00:53.960> the<00:00:54.080> chin<00:00:54.409> it<00:00:54.949> would

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:55.100 
delivering it to like the chin it would

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.270 
delivering it to like the chin it would
come<00:00:55.309> out<00:00:55.510> with<00:00:56.619> this<00:00:57.619> with<00:00:57.830> the<00:00:57.949> fingers

00:00:58.270 --> 00:00:58.280 
come out with this with the fingers

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.280 
come out with this with the fingers
pointed<00:00:58.670> up<00:00:58.820> and<00:00:59.000> so<00:00:59.150> forth<00:00:59.449> but<00:00:59.690> that's<00:01:00.110> not

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:00.290 
pointed up and so forth but that's not

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:01.509 
pointed up and so forth but that's not
the<00:01:00.440> natural<00:01:00.830> motion<00:01:00.979> that<00:01:01.280> you<00:01:01.369> would

00:01:01.509 --> 00:01:01.519 
the natural motion that you would

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:03.280 
the natural motion that you would
necessarily<00:01:01.640> use<00:01:02.180> in<00:01:02.360> the<00:01:02.479> in<00:01:02.839> a<00:01:02.989> real<00:01:03.170> life

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.290 
necessarily use in the in a real life

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.609 
necessarily use in the in a real life
application<00:01:04.420> give<00:01:05.420> you<00:01:05.510> an<00:01:05.600> example

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
application give you an example

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.690 
application give you an example
in<00:01:08.270> such<00:01:09.270> a<00:01:09.299> moment

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
in such a moment

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.310 
in such a moment
here

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.320 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.740 

motion<00:01:15.320> is<00:01:15.829> not<00:01:16.130> here<00:01:16.579> this<00:01:16.820> excusing<00:01:17.390> must<00:01:17.600> be

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:17.750 
motion is not here this excusing must be

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:18.999 
motion is not here this excusing must be
their<00:01:17.899> strength<00:01:18.109> I'm<00:01:18.380> coming<00:01:18.740> here<00:01:18.920> I'm

00:01:18.999 --> 00:01:19.009 
their strength I'm coming here I'm

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:21.789 
their strength I'm coming here I'm
shifting<00:01:19.310> my<00:01:19.549> weight<00:01:19.579> and<00:01:20.359> I'm<00:01:20.479> jamming<00:01:21.049> my<00:01:21.229> my

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:21.799 
shifting my weight and I'm jamming my my

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:24.340 
shifting my weight and I'm jamming my my
hand<00:01:22.159> towards<00:01:22.789> his<00:01:23.030> face<00:01:23.299> I<00:01:23.659> want<00:01:24.109> everything

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:24.350 
hand towards his face I want everything

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.859 
hand towards his face I want everything
that<00:01:24.530> happened<00:01:25.100> in<00:01:25.429> terms<00:01:25.789> of<00:01:26.030> like<00:01:26.509> in<00:01:26.659> use<00:01:26.840> of

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:26.869 
that happened in terms of like in use of

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:30.160 
that happened in terms of like in use of
physics<00:01:27.789> so<00:01:28.789> the<00:01:28.909> natural<00:01:29.060> motion<00:01:29.479> would<00:01:29.959> just

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
physics so the natural motion would just

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.550 
physics so the natural motion would just
be<00:01:30.319> to<00:01:30.530> to<00:01:31.189> rotate<00:01:31.700> my<00:01:32.689> my<00:01:33.049> hand<00:01:33.350> would

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
be to to rotate my my hand would

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.859 
be to to rotate my my hand would
naturally<00:01:34.039> turn<00:01:34.280> and<00:01:34.850> strike<00:01:35.539> to<00:01:35.719> be

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:35.869 
naturally turn and strike to be

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:38.800 
naturally turn and strike to be
delivered<00:01:36.380> in<00:01:36.979> this<00:01:37.250> fashion<00:01:37.490> just<00:01:38.270> a<00:01:38.450> mere

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
delivered in this fashion just a mere

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.319 
delivered in this fashion just a mere
fact<00:01:39.679> that<00:01:39.950> I'm<00:01:40.219> shifting<00:01:40.520> my<00:01:40.700> weight<00:01:40.850> and

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:41.329 
fact that I'm shifting my weight and

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:45.520 
fact that I'm shifting my weight and
turning<00:01:41.719> my<00:01:41.840> waist<00:01:42.170> that<00:01:43.009> deliver<00:01:44.530> actual

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
turning my waist that deliver actual

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:51.219 
turning my waist that deliver actual
strike<00:01:47.380> so<00:01:48.380> this<00:01:49.069> is<00:01:49.539> rotation<00:01:50.539> as<00:01:50.719> opposed<00:01:51.110> to

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
strike so this is rotation as opposed to

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:53.889 
strike so this is rotation as opposed to
trying<00:01:52.069> to<00:01:52.219> strike<00:01:52.579> here<00:01:52.909> you<00:01:53.420> can<00:01:53.569> see<00:01:53.750> this

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:53.899 
trying to strike here you can see this

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:56.229 
trying to strike here you can see this
is<00:01:54.079> the<00:01:54.259> muscular<00:01:55.250> strength<00:01:55.670> this<00:01:55.880> is<00:01:55.939> me

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:56.239 
is the muscular strength this is me

00:01:56.239 --> 00:01:58.479 
is the muscular strength this is me
taking<00:01:56.420> the<00:01:56.780> initiative<00:01:57.530> to<00:01:57.920> try<00:01:58.039> to<00:01:58.159> strike

00:01:58.479 --> 00:01:58.489 
taking the initiative to try to strike

00:01:58.489 --> 00:02:00.999 
taking the initiative to try to strike
this<00:01:58.700> individual<00:01:59.360> in<00:01:59.689> which<00:02:00.170> case<00:02:00.469> is<00:02:00.649> easier

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:01.009 
this individual in which case is easier

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:03.850 
this individual in which case is easier
for<00:02:01.039> him<00:02:01.399> to<00:02:01.429> react<00:02:01.879> to<00:02:02.020> coming<00:02:03.020> here<00:02:03.349> he<00:02:03.739> could

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:03.860 
for him to react to coming here he could

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.949 
for him to react to coming here he could
try<00:02:04.009> to<00:02:04.069> block<00:02:04.310> it<00:02:04.369> or<00:02:04.640> do<00:02:04.759> something<00:02:04.810> but<00:02:05.810> in

00:02:05.949 --> 00:02:05.959 
try to block it or do something but in

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:09.069 
try to block it or do something but in
its<00:02:06.140> natural<00:02:06.379> state<00:02:07.509> rotates<00:02:08.509> like<00:02:08.929> the

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:09.079 
its natural state rotates like the

00:02:09.079 --> 00:02:11.160 
its natural state rotates like the
rotation<00:02:09.679> is<00:02:09.920> this<00:02:10.160> business<00:02:10.819> right

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
rotation is this business right

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.420 
rotation is this business right
everything<00:02:12.170> rotates<00:02:12.349> so<00:02:12.769> that<00:02:12.920> the<00:02:13.010> joints

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
everything rotates so that the joints

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.410 
everything rotates so that the joints
have<00:02:13.459> to<00:02:13.730> be<00:02:13.849> relaxed<00:02:14.620> and<00:02:15.620> just<00:02:15.980> turn<00:02:16.420> right

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
have to be relaxed and just turn right

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:26.200 
have to be relaxed and just turn right
here<00:02:17.630> whether<00:02:18.139> either<00:02:18.500> hand

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.210 

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:29.320 

it<00:02:26.630> doesn't<00:02:26.990> matter<00:02:27.410> strike<00:02:27.770> the<00:02:27.950> body<00:02:28.330> here

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:29.330 
it doesn't matter strike the body here

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.470 
it doesn't matter strike the body here
doesn't<00:02:30.230> matter<00:02:30.410> the<00:02:31.220> rotation<00:02:31.820> is<00:02:32.210> the

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
doesn't matter the rotation is the

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.170 
doesn't matter the rotation is the
strike<00:02:32.780> it's<00:02:33.440> a<00:02:33.530> natural<00:02:33.950> motion<00:02:34.180> nothing

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:35.180 
strike it's a natural motion nothing

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:52.330 
strike it's a natural motion nothing
more<00:02:35.390> you<00:02:35.570> have<00:02:35.780> to<00:02:35.810> do<00:02:36.460> very<00:02:49.600> not<00:02:51.100> okay<00:02:52.100> so

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
more you have to do very not okay so

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.660 
more you have to do very not okay so
take<00:02:52.640> a<00:02:52.670> look<00:02:52.910> at<00:02:53.090> it<00:02:53.500> try<00:02:54.500> it<00:02:54.620> see<00:02:55.490> what<00:02:55.640> you

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:55.670 
take a look at it try it see what you

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.790 
take a look at it try it see what you
think
