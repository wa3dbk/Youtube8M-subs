00:00:00.949 --> 00:00:07.049
 they are both alive a very special greeting 

00:00:03.989 --> 00:00:09.180
 for my friend live jane eddy santana in 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.240
 Juarez City 

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:15.300
 Today in this video tutorial I will show how 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.850
 they call you or also known as 

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.710
 ricketts although they forget to stretch 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.550
 because that will serve us a lot 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.550
 images 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:58.829
 ok let's start with tutoring for this 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.539
 jack gamer we will need one thing that is 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.589
 something very basic that we must learn 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:07.729
 when we are starting the break that is 

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:11.869
 very simple that tries to put your 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:11.869
 forearm and part of the elbow 

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:17.570
 we have to put the arm of the area 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.320
 A) Yes 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:31.259
 while you have to remember that it is not like that 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:39.210
 well we have to say 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.580
 after 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:48.090
 we have to be in the position of 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:48.570
 frizz here and it's here in the arm 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.510
 left 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:54.840
 in this case today and they put it with the arm 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:57.360
 left in the abdomen would be our 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.600
 contrary but in this case we have to 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.790
 put your right hand and arm 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.630
 left you will have to download us 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:09.899
 we are going to be pulling 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:13.819
 would be our flight one extra with 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.819
 our impulse to relax 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:32.189
 that's the rotation we have to do 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:35.870
 to travel I have to stop and 

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:35.870
 our body does not pull 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:41.740
 and we have when we are pulling 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.380
 we our legs have to 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:47.050
 be elevated with a balance also 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:49.860
 in the arm 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.860
 plus 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:58.560
 ah 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:05.550
 as they saw that we have to throw 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:07.230
 but 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:10.320
 it is the hand that is going to give us the 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:12.930
 impulse and is giving us the momentum the 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:17.190
 hand our other hand also has to 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:20.780
 be working what will be the hand 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.780
 the one that is going to give you the corner 

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:24.770
 this 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:31.050
 the bread 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.050
 they are going to be some surveys 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:33.859
 A) Yes 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:44.130
 but you have to remember that our side 

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:44.130
 Men has to be firm 

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:54.000
 when we are in the hurry position 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.880
 of death 

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.670
 let's see this movement 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.200
 ah 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:22.660
 that's what we have to be doing 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:33.840
 it's going to be an impulse and a jump and so 

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:36.990
 constantly if we can control 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:39.480
 hammett with both hands for that hour 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.580
 to level up and we would have to 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:43.650
 let us jump with one hand and 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:46.220
 be jumping constantly with a 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:46.220
 single hand 

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:56.460
 I give advice to this and 

00:04:53.999 --> 00:04:59.880
 is that yes 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:04.470
 if your turn to par for the right 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:07.560
 or to there with her then when 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:10.949
 is facing, look, have half 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:12.840
 just for the right 

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:16.740
 and if it's for the other side also what 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:19.229
 same other recommendation that I give to 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:22.229
 that they do the already eating with only one hand 

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:23.580
 is that always in that part of that 

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:27.870
 it's always in questions for the side 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:31.410
 that they go that of small kicks not very 

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:34.030
 remarkable that you do not notice much so that 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:36.960
 they can jump by the hand 

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:36.960
 we can not 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:43.539
 share friday 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:59.220
 ah 

00:05:46.260 --> 00:06:01.610
 and remind us to take our feet a little 

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:01.610
 open 

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:15.510
 remember that I am already satisfied or 

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:17.340
 I need a lot of time a lot 

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:21.360
 dedication of agreement to achieve 

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:23.010
 keep it specialize in frizz and 

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:30.150
 everything we need so 

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:32.450
 I practiced this movement a lot and it 's more 

00:06:30.150 --> 00:06:32.450
 alive
