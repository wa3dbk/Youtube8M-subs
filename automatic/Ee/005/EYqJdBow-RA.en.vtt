audience

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.369 
audience
no<00:00:14.519> varying<00:00:14.849> from<00:00:15.000> beginner<00:00:15.330> solvers<00:00:15.780> to

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
no varying from beginner solvers to

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:18.200 
no varying from beginner solvers to
people<00:00:17.130> who've<00:00:17.250> been<00:00:17.340> cubing<00:00:17.670> for<00:00:17.789> many<00:00:17.940> years

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
people who've been cubing for many years

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.599 
people who've been cubing for many years
so<00:00:18.779> some<00:00:19.050> tips<00:00:19.230> may<00:00:19.500> be<00:00:19.560> relevant<00:00:19.859> to<00:00:20.100> some<00:00:20.130> may

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
so some tips may be relevant to some may

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.970 
so some tips may be relevant to some may
not<00:00:20.820> so<00:00:21.720> just<00:00:22.230> keep<00:00:22.380> that<00:00:22.529> in<00:00:22.619> mind<00:00:22.830> because

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
not so just keep that in mind because

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.250 
not so just keep that in mind because
it's<00:00:23.760> pretty<00:00:24.119> much<00:00:24.180> impossible<00:00:24.330> for<00:00:24.750> you<00:00:25.140> know

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
it's pretty much impossible for you know

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.019 
it's pretty much impossible for you know
one<00:00:25.439> tip<00:00:25.710> to<00:00:25.740> be<00:00:25.920> really<00:00:26.340> really<00:00:26.550> useful<00:00:26.580> to

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
one tip to be really really useful to

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.269 
one tip to be really really useful to
absolutely<00:00:27.449> everyone<00:00:27.810> all<00:00:28.800> right<00:00:28.859> so<00:00:29.160> this

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
absolutely everyone all right so this

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.970 
absolutely everyone all right so this
first<00:00:29.519> tip<00:00:29.849> is<00:00:30.029> for<00:00:30.269> 4x4<00:00:30.449> edges<00:00:31.140> with<00:00:31.679> yeah

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
first tip is for 4x4 edges with yeah

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.979 
first tip is for 4x4 edges with yeah
it's<00:00:32.309> somewhat<00:00:33.030> of<00:00:33.059> a<00:00:33.180> beginner<00:00:33.510> tip<00:00:33.750> but

00:00:33.979 --> 00:00:33.989 
it's somewhat of a beginner tip but

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:35.600 
it's somewhat of a beginner tip but
there<00:00:34.140> might<00:00:34.230> be<00:00:34.290> some<00:00:34.590> of<00:00:34.649> you<00:00:34.770> out<00:00:34.800> there<00:00:34.920> who

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
there might be some of you out there who

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.280 
there might be some of you out there who
you<00:00:35.670> know<00:00:35.820> Matt<00:00:36.090> may<00:00:36.390> be<00:00:36.450> averaging<00:00:36.989> you<00:00:37.200> know

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
you know Matt may be averaging you know

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.290 
you know Matt may be averaging you know
less<00:00:37.530> than<00:00:37.680> 50<00:00:37.920> seconds<00:00:38.340> who<00:00:38.460> maybe<00:00:39.090> don't

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
less than 50 seconds who maybe don't

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.840 
less than 50 seconds who maybe don't
even<00:00:39.420> do<00:00:39.629> this<00:00:39.780> yet<00:00:39.989> but<00:00:40.200> I<00:00:40.530> wouldn't<00:00:41.489> think<00:00:41.550> so

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
even do this yet but I wouldn't think so

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.049 
even do this yet but I wouldn't think so
so<00:00:42.480> what<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.770> case<00:00:44.010> we<00:00:44.160> have<00:00:44.340> here<00:00:44.579> is<00:00:44.700> we<00:00:44.910> have

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
so what the case we have here is we have

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.410 
so what the case we have here is we have
to<00:00:45.329> double<00:00:45.600> swap<00:00:45.960> of<00:00:46.140> edges<00:00:46.500> so<00:00:47.190> we<00:00:47.340> have<00:00:47.550> these

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
to double swap of edges so we have these

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.060 
to double swap of edges so we have these
two<00:00:48.719> and<00:00:48.989> these<00:00:49.230> two<00:00:49.289> so<00:00:49.739> they<00:00:49.829> need<00:00:49.980> to<00:00:50.010> be

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
two and these two so they need to be

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.549 
two and these two so they need to be
swapped<00:00:50.399> and<00:00:50.670> then<00:00:51.149> we<00:00:51.239> got<00:00:51.390> these<00:00:51.960> two<00:00:52.199> pairs

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
swapped and then we got these two pairs

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.750 
swapped and then we got these two pairs
so<00:00:53.870> sort<00:00:54.870> of<00:00:54.960> intuitively<00:00:55.770> how<00:00:56.129> someone<00:00:56.730> might

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
so sort of intuitively how someone might

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:57.920 
so sort of intuitively how someone might
tackle<00:00:57.090> this<00:00:57.360> when<00:00:57.539> they're<00:00:57.690> first<00:00:57.840> learning

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
tackle this when they're first learning

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.470 
tackle this when they're first learning
4x4<00:00:58.590> or<00:00:58.770> first<00:00:59.039> learning<00:00:59.250> Yale<00:00:59.520> would<00:01:00.149> be<00:01:00.329> to

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
4x4 or first learning Yale would be to

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.029 
4x4 or first learning Yale would be to
do<00:01:00.600> something<00:01:00.989> like<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.260> following<00:01:01.680> so<00:01:01.920> they

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
do something like the following so they

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.189 
do something like the following so they
would<00:01:02.329> they<00:01:03.329> would<00:01:03.449> flip<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.780> edge<00:01:03.899> here

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
would they would flip the edge here

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.100 
would they would flip the edge here
first<00:01:04.640> replace<00:01:05.640> it<00:01:05.820> with<00:01:05.909> that<00:01:05.939> edge<00:01:06.180> flip<00:01:06.960> it

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
first replace it with that edge flip it

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.859 
first replace it with that edge flip it
back<00:01:07.290> and<00:01:07.640> then<00:01:08.640> maybe<00:01:08.850> bring<00:01:09.090> these<00:01:09.360> two<00:01:09.630> into

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
back and then maybe bring these two into

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.539 
back and then maybe bring these two into
the<00:01:09.960> front<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:11.180> then<00:01:12.180> flip<00:01:12.479> it<00:01:12.510> again<00:01:13.549> now

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
the front and then flip it again now

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.429 
the front and then flip it again now
you'll<00:01:14.760> notice<00:01:14.939> that<00:01:15.090> that<00:01:15.479> took<00:01:15.659> a<00:01:15.720> fair<00:01:16.170> few

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
you'll notice that that took a fair few

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.620 
you'll notice that that took a fair few
that<00:01:17.250> took<00:01:17.400> that<00:01:17.670> took<00:01:17.790> a<00:01:17.850> lot<00:01:17.939> of<00:01:18.060> moves<00:01:18.299> and

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
that took that took a lot of moves and

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.260 
that took that took a lot of moves and
it<00:01:18.990> probably<00:01:19.500> wasn't<00:01:19.830> very<00:01:20.100> efficient<00:01:20.520> so

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
it probably wasn't very efficient so

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.330 
it probably wasn't very efficient so
there<00:01:21.630> is<00:01:21.780> actually<00:01:22.560> a<00:01:22.619> much<00:01:22.650> fast<00:01:23.040> way<00:01:23.310> of

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
there is actually a much fast way of

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.200 
there is actually a much fast way of
doing<00:01:23.700> something<00:01:23.939> like<00:01:24.030> this<00:01:25.490> so<00:01:26.490> instead<00:01:26.970> of

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
doing something like this so instead of

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.170 
doing something like this so instead of
doing<00:01:27.540> two<00:01:27.780> at<00:01:28.409> a<00:01:28.470> time<00:01:29.009> so<00:01:29.369> in<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:30.030> first

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
doing two at a time so in the first

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.539 
doing two at a time so in the first
example<00:01:30.329> I<00:01:30.750> solved<00:01:31.079> two<00:01:31.290> and<00:01:31.590> then<00:01:31.799> two<00:01:32.070> what

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
example I solved two and then two what

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.010 
example I solved two and then two what
we're<00:01:32.670> going<00:01:32.790> to<00:01:32.820> do<00:01:32.939> is<00:01:33.150> solve<00:01:33.360> one<00:01:33.570> edge<00:01:33.750> and

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
we're going to do is solve one edge and

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.200 
we're going to do is solve one edge and
then<00:01:34.140> solve<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.470> remaining<00:01:34.650> three<00:01:35.130> so<00:01:36.000> what

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
then solve the remaining three so what

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:39.140 
then solve the remaining three so what
we're<00:01:36.299> going<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.450> do<00:01:36.630> is<00:01:36.840> slice<00:01:37.650> two<00:01:38.070> to<00:01:38.909> pair

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
we're going to do is slice two to pair

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.630 
we're going to do is slice two to pair
up<00:01:39.270> one<00:01:39.450> edge<00:01:39.650> so<00:01:40.650> I<00:01:40.680> set<00:01:41.009> up<00:01:41.100> the<00:01:41.189> same<00:01:41.369> pretty

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
up one edge so I set up the same pretty

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.039 
up one edge so I set up the same pretty
much<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.850> same<00:01:42.030> case<00:01:42.270> here<00:01:42.479> so<00:01:42.659> we've<00:01:42.810> got<00:01:42.930> the

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
much the same case here so we've got the

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.440 
much the same case here so we've got the
pair's<00:01:43.619> in<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:43.860> past<00:01:44.100> so<00:01:44.520> we<00:01:44.549> sliced<00:01:44.909> to<00:01:45.240> solve

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
pair's in the past so we sliced to solve

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.429 
pair's in the past so we sliced to solve
one<00:01:45.600> edge<00:01:45.920> insert<00:01:46.920> any<00:01:47.670> one<00:01:47.909> of<00:01:48.000> the<00:01:48.090> top<00:01:48.240> edges

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:48.439 
one edge insert any one of the top edges

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:51.350 
one edge insert any one of the top edges
slice<00:01:49.439> back<00:01:49.710> so<00:01:50.460> we've<00:01:50.579> sold<00:01:50.729> our<00:01:50.880> first<00:01:51.060> edge

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
slice back so we've sold our first edge

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.230 
slice back so we've sold our first edge
and<00:01:51.799> because<00:01:52.799> we<00:01:52.979> know<00:01:53.159> we<00:01:53.490> had<00:01:53.700> these<00:01:54.000> two

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
and because we know we had these two

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.460 
and because we know we had these two
here<00:01:54.479> and<00:01:54.600> these<00:01:54.689> two<00:01:54.750> here<00:01:55.079> to<00:01:55.229> begin<00:01:55.350> with

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
here and these two here to begin with

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.800 
here and these two here to begin with
when<00:01:56.130> we<00:01:56.250> slice<00:01:56.460> back<00:01:56.700> again<00:01:57.000> it<00:01:57.479> will<00:01:57.570> form

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
when we slice back again it will form

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.469 
when we slice back again it will form
this<00:01:58.020> new<00:01:58.500> edge<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:59.310> all<00:01:59.729> we<00:01:59.850> need<00:01:59.969> to<00:02:00.060> do<00:02:00.210> is

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
this new edge and all we need to do is

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.139 
this new edge and all we need to do is
replace<00:02:00.840> this<00:02:01.829> with<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.369> corresponding<00:02:02.939> edge

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
replace this with the corresponding edge

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.389 
replace this with the corresponding edge
in<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.780> right<00:02:03.930> orientation<00:02:04.110> and<00:02:04.770> it<00:02:05.280> will

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
in the right orientation and it will

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:09.529 
in the right orientation and it will
solve<00:02:05.640> remaining<00:02:06.390> two<00:02:07.280> so<00:02:08.280> there<00:02:08.520> you<00:02:08.580> go<00:02:08.700> see

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
solve remaining two so there you go see

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:11.810 
solve remaining two so there you go see
you<00:02:09.599> tomorrow
