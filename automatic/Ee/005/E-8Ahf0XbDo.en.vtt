00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:09.179
 hello to the video on the topic 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.509
 Twins research in this video 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:14.160
 do you learn the purpose of twin studies? 

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:16.710
 We talk about the implementation 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.170
 these studies on the statements that one 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.609
 can meet and the difficulties the 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.609
 I give up at the twin research 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.539
 Scientists have been searching for a long time 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.579
 an answer to the question what can 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.250
 to the people their mature ways are 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.680
 what influences our external characteristics 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.710
 what is our character how big is that 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.690
 Influence of the environment how big the 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.020
 Influence of the genetic material so the gene in 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:47.880
 our dna 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:50.040
 the environmental influences include eg 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:52.110
 education education cultural and 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.880
 social influences as well as the 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.180
 including the lifestyle 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:58.340
 nutritional habits around the 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.960
 environmental and genetic 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:05.220
 To determine influences one uses oneself 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:07.500
 the twin research is identical 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:11.550
 Gemini also benefits as a mono 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.350
 Gemini refers to identical twins 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:16.140
 develop like the name already 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:20.479
 says that from the same cell 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:23.100
 A sperm was fertilized from the to 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:25.200
 develop two individually as 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:28.290
 carry exactly the same hereditary equipment 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.990
 so 100 percent genetically identical 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.030
 are 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:38.420
 the full movie and many more
