00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:02.190 
hi I'm Dave troll to trial gallery and

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:03.500 
hi I'm Dave troll to trial gallery and
we're<00:00:02.520> going<00:00:02.639> to<00:00:02.669> talk<00:00:02.820> today<00:00:03.000> about<00:00:03.090> how<00:00:03.330> to

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:03.510 
we're going to talk today about how to

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.749 
we're going to talk today about how to
make<00:00:03.750> router<00:00:04.080> templates<00:00:04.620> a<00:00:04.830> router<00:00:05.400> template

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
make router templates a router template

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:08.120 
make router templates a router template
could<00:00:05.879> be<00:00:05.940> something<00:00:06.270> simple<00:00:06.629> as<00:00:06.899> this<00:00:07.109> just<00:00:07.919> a

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
could be something simple as this just a

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.610 
could be something simple as this just a
curved<00:00:08.849> piece<00:00:09.059> of<00:00:09.300> wood<00:00:09.660> that<00:00:10.230> would<00:00:10.349> be<00:00:10.469> used

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
curved piece of wood that would be used

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.640 
curved piece of wood that would be used
in<00:00:10.769> making<00:00:10.860> repetitive<00:00:11.519> cuts<00:00:12.410> it<00:00:13.410> can<00:00:13.559> be

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
in making repetitive cuts it can be

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.200 
in making repetitive cuts it can be
something<00:00:14.040> I<00:00:14.130> could<00:00:14.190> jig<00:00:14.460> like<00:00:14.490> this<00:00:14.880> that<00:00:15.150> I

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
something I could jig like this that I

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.830 
something I could jig like this that I
used<00:00:15.389> in<00:00:15.509> making<00:00:16.039> dedos<00:00:17.039> and<00:00:17.279> in<00:00:17.460> stock<00:00:17.850> I<00:00:18.240> just

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
used in making dedos and in stock I just

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.439 
used in making dedos and in stock I just
run<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:19.050> router<00:00:19.289> through<00:00:19.619> here<00:00:20.180> or<00:00:21.180> something

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
run the router through here or something

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:22.640 
run the router through here or something
a<00:00:21.480> little<00:00:21.510> bit<00:00:21.720> more<00:00:21.869> complex<00:00:22.320> like<00:00:22.619> this

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
a little bit more complex like this

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.710 
a little bit more complex like this
which<00:00:23.400> is<00:00:23.550> used<00:00:23.760> to<00:00:23.850> cut<00:00:24.060> out<00:00:24.090> the<00:00:24.269> mortises

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
which is used to cut out the mortises

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.689 
which is used to cut out the mortises
for<00:00:24.750> hinges<00:00:25.260> and<00:00:26.039> this<00:00:26.160> is<00:00:26.250> one<00:00:26.400> I'm<00:00:26.490> going<00:00:26.609> to

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
for hinges and this is one I'm going to

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.790 
for hinges and this is one I'm going to
show<00:00:26.849> you<00:00:26.910> how<00:00:27.090> to<00:00:27.150> do<00:00:27.390> the<00:00:27.840> theory<00:00:28.170> used<00:00:28.380> here

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
show you how to do the theory used here

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.410 
show you how to do the theory used here
can<00:00:29.010> be<00:00:29.099> used<00:00:29.130> in<00:00:29.429> your<00:00:29.609> other<00:00:29.760> pieces<00:00:29.970> as<00:00:30.269> well

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
can be used in your other pieces as well

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.420 
can be used in your other pieces as well
so<00:00:31.230> let<00:00:31.349> me<00:00:31.410> show<00:00:31.560> you<00:00:31.650> how<00:00:31.740> to<00:00:31.800> build<00:00:32.009> that<00:00:32.130> jig

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
so let me show you how to build that jig

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.959 
so let me show you how to build that jig
I've<00:00:32.850> pre-cut<00:00:33.180> some<00:00:33.480> pieces<00:00:33.719> of<00:00:33.899> stock<00:00:34.290> so<00:00:37.969> on

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
I've pre-cut some pieces of stock so on

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.700 
I've pre-cut some pieces of stock so on
the<00:00:39.059> base<00:00:39.239> of<00:00:39.270> my<00:00:39.570> jig<00:00:39.930> I've<00:00:40.079> already<00:00:40.320> notched

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
the base of my jig I've already notched

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.420 
the base of my jig I've already notched
out<00:00:41.300> the<00:00:42.300> waist<00:00:42.510> area<00:00:42.809> and<00:00:43.170> done<00:00:44.129> some<00:00:44.309> basic

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
out the waist area and done some basic

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.430 
out the waist area and done some basic
layout<00:00:44.940> lines<00:00:45.239> the<00:00:45.930> first<00:00:46.170> thing<00:00:46.260> we're<00:00:46.350> going

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
layout lines the first thing we're going

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.840 
layout lines the first thing we're going
to<00:00:46.500> do<00:00:46.649> is<00:00:48.200> a<00:00:49.200> piece<00:00:50.100> with<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.340> nice<00:00:50.489> straight

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
to do is a piece with a nice straight

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.100 
to do is a piece with a nice straight
edge<00:00:50.879> I'm<00:00:51.690> going<00:00:51.870> to<00:00:51.930> put<00:00:52.020> on<00:00:52.140> a<00:00:52.289> layout<00:00:52.530> line

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:54.110 
edge I'm going to put on a layout line

00:00:54.110 --> 00:01:00.889 
edge I'm going to put on a layout line
I'm<00:00:55.110> gonna<00:00:55.620> clamp<00:00:56.010> it<00:00:56.160> in<00:00:56.250> place<00:00:59.719> double<00:01:00.719> check

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
I'm gonna clamp it in place double check

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.959 
I'm gonna clamp it in place double check
to<00:01:01.020> make<00:01:01.050> sure<00:01:01.320> we're<00:01:02.190> still<00:01:02.370> on<00:01:02.430> our<00:01:02.609> layout

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
to make sure we're still on our layout

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.560 
to make sure we're still on our layout
line<00:01:04.400> then<00:01:05.400> I'm<00:01:05.460> gonna<00:01:05.549> flip<00:01:05.729> this<00:01:05.939> over<00:01:06.180> and

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
line then I'm gonna flip this over and

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.210 
line then I'm gonna flip this over and
just<00:01:06.990> shoot<00:01:07.140> a<00:01:07.229> couple<00:01:07.380> of<00:01:07.560> Brad's<00:01:07.830> in<00:01:08.070> there

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
just shoot a couple of Brad's in there

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.910 
just shoot a couple of Brad's in there
to<00:01:08.310> hold<00:01:08.430> it<00:01:08.580> in<00:01:08.670> place<00:01:09.560> the<00:01:10.560> next<00:01:10.770> thing<00:01:10.860> I'm

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
to hold it in place the next thing I'm

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.260 
to hold it in place the next thing I'm
gonna<00:01:11.010> do<00:01:11.100> is<00:01:11.310> gonna<00:01:11.369> bring<00:01:11.610> in<00:01:11.670> our<00:01:11.909> first

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
gonna do is gonna bring in our first

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.480 
gonna do is gonna bring in our first
side<00:01:12.810> piece<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.770> I'm<00:01:13.860> going<00:01:13.979> to<00:01:14.010> line<00:01:14.220> it<00:01:14.250> up

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
side piece and I'm going to line it up

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.490 
side piece and I'm going to line it up
just<00:01:15.060> so<00:01:15.180> that<00:01:15.210> it<00:01:15.450> overhangs<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:16.140> knotch

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
just so that it overhangs the knotch

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.100 
just so that it overhangs the knotch
we've<00:01:16.740> already<00:01:16.950> cut<00:01:17.630> because<00:01:18.630> this<00:01:18.869> is<00:01:18.990> the

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
we've already cut because this is the

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.289 
we've already cut because this is the
edge<00:01:19.229> we<00:01:19.409> want<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.650> register<00:01:19.799> off<00:01:20.250> of<00:01:20.520> and

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
edge we want to register off of and

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.700 
edge we want to register off of and
again<00:01:21.750> I'm<00:01:21.840> just<00:01:21.900> going<00:01:22.049> to<00:01:22.110> clamp<00:01:22.409> that<00:01:22.590> in

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
again I'm just going to clamp that in

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:31.340 
again I'm just going to clamp that in
place<00:01:26.060> and<00:01:27.170> put<00:01:28.170> a<00:01:28.200> couple<00:01:28.380> Brad's<00:01:28.740> in<00:01:30.350> we're

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
place and put a couple Brad's in we're

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.620 
place and put a couple Brad's in we're
building<00:01:31.650> this<00:01:31.770> 2<00:01:32.009> or<00:01:32.610> 3<00:01:32.909> inch<00:01:33.060> hinge<00:01:33.390> and

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
building this 2 or 3 inch hinge and

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:34.819 
building this 2 or 3 inch hinge and
because<00:01:33.900> we're<00:01:34.049> using<00:01:34.170> a<00:01:34.290> template<00:01:34.619> guide

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
because we're using a template guide

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:37.580 
because we're using a template guide
that<00:01:35.700> is<00:01:35.729> an<00:01:36.119> eighth<00:01:36.299> of<00:01:36.450> an<00:01:36.570> inch<00:01:36.720> larger<00:01:37.320> than

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
that is an eighth of an inch larger than

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.679 
that is an eighth of an inch larger than
the<00:01:37.829> bit<00:01:38.009> we're<00:01:38.250> going<00:01:38.430> to<00:01:38.640> use<00:01:38.850> I<00:01:39.119> need<00:01:39.540> to

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
the bit we're going to use I need to

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.870 
the bit we're going to use I need to
allow<00:01:39.930> for<00:01:39.960> that<00:01:40.259> eighth<00:01:40.439> of<00:01:40.650> an<00:01:40.740> inch<00:01:40.920> so<00:01:41.790> I'm

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
allow for that eighth of an inch so I'm

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.910 
allow for that eighth of an inch so I'm
going<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.060> set<00:01:42.329> this<00:01:42.509> off<00:01:42.689> three<00:01:43.530> and<00:01:43.680> 1/8

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
going to set this off three and 1/8

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.649 
going to set this off three and 1/8
inches<00:01:44.490> we're<00:01:45.000> going<00:01:45.119> to<00:01:45.180> line<00:01:45.360> up<00:01:45.390> that

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
inches we're going to line up that

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:48.410 
inches we're going to line up that
second<00:01:46.049> side<00:01:46.259> piece<00:01:46.590> up<00:01:47.000> hold<00:01:48.000> it<00:01:48.149> in<00:01:48.240> place

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
second side piece up hold it in place

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.960 
second side piece up hold it in place
while<00:01:48.720> we<00:01:48.840> put<00:01:49.049> a<00:01:49.079> clamp<00:01:49.380> on<00:01:49.560> there<00:01:49.890> the<00:01:50.729> next

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
while we put a clamp on there the next
