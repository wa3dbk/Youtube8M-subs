00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 hello to all the restorers 

00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:06.600
 Welcome to my channel this time 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.980
 I do a small video quickie yes 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.809
 but first I want to send a greeting to 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.450
 our friend smoke brown until the 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:15.139
 mochis sinaloa who thanks to him was 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.139
 possible this video 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:24.490
 as you can see behind me with 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:26.920
 Venetian stucco with palladium 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:29.800
 and many know this effect that 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:31.680
 it must be marbled and a little 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.239
 bright it costs us a lot always 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.190
 Brighten up then our friend 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:39.489
 hugo gave us a technique we are going 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:41.650
 in practice and is using will be for 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:44.280
 shoes here fat for shoes the 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:49.019
 that many already know 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:51.059
 in neutral color and a clean cloth and the 

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:54.360
 spatula let's get that shine 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:58.379
 mirror so difficult and so sought after by 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:02.699
 all of us so that's the secret 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:06.060
 and it's just applying with the cloth a 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:09.090
 little wax in stretches of no more than one 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:12.330
 square meter or small traps 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:14.970
 and immediately with a spatula a 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.160
 little inclined and generating average strength 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.009
 we will be able to achieve that brightness 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:23.070
 immediately ok then there is is 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.229
 a somewhat quick dress and I hope that 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.720
 thank you again and so on 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:29.429
