00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:07.230
 We passed the thread through the back and 

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:07.230
 a fan that hooks 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:14.940
 we found the thread in a rubber 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:17.599
 so that it is centered in the lighthouse 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.550
 because you want the trunk of the town 

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:23.060
 We passed the thread through the slot in the 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.060
 door 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:29.520
 passed the thread and we make a small 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.230
 knot 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:35.240
 so that the stone does not go to 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.240
 inside there is soon 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.550
 let's put him 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.930
 and three 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.860
 3 avn what 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.860
 rafa alfa 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.900
 we put him 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:54.590
 until well 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:57.400
 here we can 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:01:00.930
 squeeze them with friends 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.930
 when a little bit we settle 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.289
 and then we continue a little more 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:16.120
 and then they get hooked 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:20.910
 we passed the press and we downloaded it to 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:20.910
 killing him until he sees what's left 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.920
 we take 

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:45.080
 then the dam 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:48.370
 we give him then 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.370
 and descents 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.210
 we continue full 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:00.300
 they are three tight more or less than 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:04.280
 what 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.280
 the bale of those ten 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:12.760
 we download the last one rendered 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.760
 let say 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.230
 do not 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.790
 under the table 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:29.950
 and pulled the thread from the back 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:35.280
 pulled out a thread 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:42.110
 step with the needle 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.110
 through the slot 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:48.400
 The nest caught my shots and outside 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.720
 in your batch 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.300
 there it goes 

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:05.750
 he greeted me 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:09.560
 I get hooked 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:12.050
 put them to shot to be for 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.870
 inside for full plane I do not 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:16.799
 the knot is very low 

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.799
 But so 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.160
 there it goes 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.160
 now under the press 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.640
 and there goes 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.260
 threw 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:41.280
 fed up with a bow 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:45.870
 somehow bun 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.870
 with the animals 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.480
 I open the door and it remains 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:10.390
 the sane soon 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:10.390
 as you can see them very firm 

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:14.740
 and as for me
