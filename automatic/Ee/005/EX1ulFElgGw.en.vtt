00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
photoshop tutorial what we are going to

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.410 
photoshop tutorial what we are going to
do<00:00:09.000> right<00:00:09.179> now<00:00:09.240> is<00:00:09.599> we<00:00:10.110> were<00:00:10.290> just<00:00:10.559> going<00:00:10.830> to

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:11.420 
do right now is we were just going to

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:14.900 
do right now is we were just going to
change<00:00:12.420> the<00:00:12.840> eye<00:00:12.870> color<00:00:13.320> and<00:00:13.559> I<00:00:14.340> know<00:00:14.549> I've

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
change the eye color and I know I've

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.800 
change the eye color and I know I've
done<00:00:15.210> one<00:00:15.900> in<00:00:16.199> an<00:00:16.470> earlier<00:00:16.859> tutorial<00:00:17.490> but<00:00:18.210> this

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
done one in an earlier tutorial but this

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.230 
done one in an earlier tutorial but this
way<00:00:19.020> is<00:00:19.199> just<00:00:19.529> much<00:00:19.770> more<00:00:20.039> efficient<00:00:20.850> and<00:00:21.060> it's

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
way is just much more efficient and it's

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.009 
way is just much more efficient and it's
much<00:00:21.600> much<00:00:22.529> cleaner<00:00:23.180> so<00:00:24.180> we're<00:00:24.720> going<00:00:24.779> to<00:00:24.900> get

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
much much cleaner so we're going to get

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.200 
much much cleaner so we're going to get
started<00:00:25.170> here<00:00:25.650> and<00:00:25.830> as<00:00:26.369> always<00:00:26.580> you're<00:00:27.000> going

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
started here and as always you're going

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.060 
started here and as always you're going
to<00:00:27.269> drag<00:00:27.630> your<00:00:27.810> background<00:00:28.289> layer<00:00:28.439> to<00:00:28.859> a<00:00:28.890> new

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
to drag your background layer to a new

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.240 
to drag your background layer to a new
layer<00:00:29.279> and<00:00:30.320> then<00:00:31.320> what<00:00:31.590> we're<00:00:31.740> going<00:00:31.890> to<00:00:32.099> do

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
layer and then what we're going to do

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.770 
layer and then what we're going to do
here<00:00:32.279> is<00:00:32.640> we<00:00:32.850> are<00:00:32.940> going<00:00:33.030> to<00:00:33.149> go<00:00:33.180> over<00:00:33.300> here

here is we are going to go over here
just<00:00:34.050> a<00:00:34.260> third<00:00:34.559> but<00:00:35.100> um<00:00:35.280> third<00:00:35.969> tool<00:00:36.570> and<00:00:36.899> it<00:00:37.530> is

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
just a third but um third tool and it is

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.979 
just a third but um third tool and it is
the<00:00:37.980> magnetic<00:00:38.340> lasso<00:00:38.700> you<00:00:39.420> might<00:00:39.600> see<00:00:39.840> the

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
the magnetic lasso you might see the

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.770 
the magnetic lasso you might see the
lasso<00:00:40.469> on<00:00:40.680> just<00:00:41.520> click<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:41.910> hold<00:00:42.059> and<00:00:42.329> go<00:00:42.600> down

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
to the magnetic lasso and what you're

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.229 
to the magnetic lasso and what you're
going<00:00:45.719> to<00:00:45.809> do<00:00:46.020> is<00:00:46.460> here's<00:00:47.460> my<00:00:47.640> photo<00:00:47.940> here

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
going to do is here's my photo here

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
much easier to use the magnetic lasso

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.670 
much easier to use the magnetic lasso
and<00:00:58.790> what<00:00:59.660> you're<00:00:59.780> going<00:00:59.899> to<00:00:59.960> start<00:01:00.170> doing<00:01:00.379> is

all the way around the eye and this is

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.030 
all the way around the eye and this is
going<00:01:06.979> to<00:01:07.190> be<00:01:07.369> making<00:01:07.850> us<00:01:08.270> selection<00:01:08.960> so<00:01:09.740> that

this looks good here

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.470 
this looks good here
so<00:02:14.220> first<00:02:14.610> we're<00:02:14.790> just<00:02:14.940> going<00:02:15.120> to<00:02:15.180> zoom<00:02:15.330> out

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480 
so first we're just going to zoom out

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.400 
so first we're just going to zoom out
and<00:02:15.720> see<00:02:16.260> the<00:02:16.410> difference<00:02:17.420> you<00:02:18.420> can<00:02:18.450> deselect

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
and see the difference you can deselect

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:22.580 
and see the difference you can deselect
that<00:02:19.680> now<00:02:20.480> so<00:02:21.480> as<00:02:21.750> you<00:02:21.930> can<00:02:22.110> already<00:02:22.260> see

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:22.590 
that now so as you can already see

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.350 
that now so as you can already see
there's<00:02:22.860> a<00:02:22.920> big<00:02:23.280> difference<00:02:23.550> between<00:02:23.849> the

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
there's a big difference between the

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.610 
there's a big difference between the
before<00:02:24.720> and<00:02:24.989> the<00:02:25.050> after<00:02:26.930> okay<00:02:27.930> now<00:02:28.290> what<00:02:28.440> we're

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
before and the after okay now what we're

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.390 
before and the after okay now what we're
going<00:02:28.800> to<00:02:28.890> do<00:02:29.040> to<00:02:29.220> make<00:02:29.370> this<00:02:29.550> even<00:02:29.790> better

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
going to do to make this even better

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.800 
going to do to make this even better
zoom<00:02:32.400> back<00:02:32.610> in<00:02:33.349> open<00:02:34.349> a<00:02:34.410> new<00:02:34.590> layer<00:02:34.800> and<00:02:35.810> then

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
zoom back in open a new layer and then

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.589 
zoom back in open a new layer and then
get<00:02:37.230> this<00:02:37.670> circle<00:02:38.670> to<00:02:38.790> the<00:02:38.819> ellipse<00:02:39.330> marque

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
get this circle to the ellipse marque

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:42.290 
get this circle to the ellipse marque
tool<00:02:39.840> and<00:02:40.830> what<00:02:41.519> you're<00:02:41.700> going<00:02:41.819> to<00:02:41.880> do<00:02:42.000> is

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
tool and what you're going to do is

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.280 
tool and what you're going to do is
you're<00:02:42.599> going<00:02:42.840> to<00:02:43.110> read<00:02:43.380> you<00:02:43.410> the<00:02:43.830> pupil<00:02:44.220> and

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
you're going to read you the pupil and

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.170 
you're going to read you the pupil and
so<00:02:46.290> you're<00:02:46.830> going<00:02:46.950> to<00:02:47.010> just<00:02:47.100> make<00:02:47.790> a<00:02:47.819> circle

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
so you're going to just make a circle

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.120 
so you're going to just make a circle
like<00:02:48.360> that<00:02:49.340> then<00:02:50.340> with<00:02:51.120> a<00:02:51.150> black<00:02:51.780> color<00:02:52.410> you

are just going to fill
and<00:02:56.069> deselect<00:02:57.030> and<00:02:57.269> York's<00:02:57.510> for<00:02:58.050> us<00:02:58.170> you're
