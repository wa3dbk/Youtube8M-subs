00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:27.569
The MPV does not go out of fashion? And we will transform it into crossover. This is what

00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:31.769
happens with the new Renault Espace, which tries to abandon old clothes

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.020
to wear the trendiest.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.270
It will not be easy, especially in Italy, where only 30% of its market

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:43.310
is set to private and the remaining 70% to companies; however, it remains a comfortable car

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:47.830
and suitable for long trips, practice and a little 'more robust than before.

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:51.640
"We wanted to keep this word, Espace,

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.229
because

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:57.470
there always is the absolute brightness of the Espace,

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.370
but we propose a much

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.690
lower car,

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:07.070
much lighter (250 Kg less), with a absolutely extraordinary

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:13.190
technology, and with a driving pleasure thanks to MultSense, which is a absolute

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:15.240
innovation in the world of the automotive".

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.500
The engines have been optimized: Renault lightens Espace of 250 Kg

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:25.720
and adopts the "downsizing": 3 engines, all Energy, two diesel 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:31.800
(one of 130 and another Twin Turbo of 160 HP), and a petrol of 200 HP.

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.500
Inside is cozy, spacious and bright.

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.880
For the new Espace, the designers were inspired by the world of aeronautics;

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:57.820
so inside predominates this big "suspended" console,

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:03.060
which remembers the plane cockpit and in the middle is

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:09.009
characterized by this big screen, positioned at the top of the

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.000
console. Another important change is the MultiSense:

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.810
a single command to access the five driving modes available (four

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.350
planned and 1 customizable), what the French describe as "5

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.090
multisensory experiences to immerse yourself in complete driving pleasure" , and that

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.870
we (more trivially) we summarize in Eco, Comfort, Neutral, Sport and

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.449
programmable mode! In short, matter of point of view .

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:39.689
In essence, the system allows to coordinate the driving parameters with

00:02:39.689 --> 00:02:42.479
environmental ones and the suspension control.
