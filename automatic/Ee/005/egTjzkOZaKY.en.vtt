00:03:19.759 --> 00:03:19.769 
I remember at least in in one in the

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:21.380 
I remember at least in in one in the
chamber<00:03:19.980> it<00:03:20.459> wasn't<00:03:20.790> on<00:03:20.880> until<00:03:21.150> there<00:03:21.300> was

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
chamber it wasn't on until there was

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:22.729 
chamber it wasn't on until there was
like<00:03:21.540> three<00:03:21.870> players<00:03:22.110> left<00:03:22.230> or<00:03:22.530> something

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
like three players left or something

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:25.370

anyways<00:03:22.980> here<00:03:23.340> we<00:03:23.400> go<00:03:23.519> for<00:03:23.940> the<00:03:24.030> win<00:03:24.209> yes<00:03:24.600> in

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
anyways here we go for the win yes in

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.190 
anyways here we go for the win yes in
the<00:03:25.440> back<00:03:25.829> and<00:03:26.160> you<00:03:26.730> can<00:03:27.000> see<00:03:27.209> from<00:03:27.390> the<00:03:27.600> the

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
the back and you can see from the the

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.620 
the back and you can see from the the
ending<00:03:28.620> lobby<00:03:28.950> or<00:03:29.280> the<00:03:29.760> game<00:03:29.940> summary<00:03:30.360> there

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
ending lobby or the game summary there

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.210 
ending lobby or the game summary there
were<00:03:30.750> actually<00:03:31.049> 14<00:03:31.500> players<00:03:31.709> left<00:03:32.010> then<00:03:32.190> I

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
were actually 14 players left then I

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.979 
were actually 14 players left then I
think<00:03:32.579> there<00:03:32.730> might<00:03:32.970> have<00:03:33.030> been<00:03:33.150> four<00:03:33.780> players

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
think there might have been four players

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:35.569 
think there might have been four players
