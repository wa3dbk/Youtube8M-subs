because<00:03:11.420> of<00:03:11.569> the<00:03:11.720> variant<00:03:12.379> ways<00:03:12.590> of<00:03:12.799> scoring

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
because of the variant ways of scoring

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.699 
because of the variant ways of scoring
when<00:03:14.420> you<00:03:14.540> score<00:03:14.780> players<00:03:15.079> use<00:03:15.319> these<00:03:15.500> little

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
when you score players use these little

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:19.059 
when you score players use these little
score<00:03:16.010> sheets<00:03:16.280> and<00:03:17.139> you<00:03:18.139> can<00:03:18.319> score<00:03:18.620> one<00:03:18.949> of

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:19.069 
score sheets and you can score one of

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:20.770 
score sheets and you can score one of
four<00:03:19.250> different<00:03:19.549> ways<00:03:19.669> you<00:03:20.030> can<00:03:20.150> score<00:03:20.629> the

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
four different ways you can score the

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.170 
four different ways you can score the
highest<00:03:21.190> number<00:03:22.190> in<00:03:22.310> each<00:03:22.400> color<00:03:22.730> so<00:03:23.150> for

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
highest number in each color so for

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.530 
highest number in each color so for
example<00:03:23.750> this<00:03:23.900> is<00:03:24.049> what<00:03:24.169> I<00:03:24.199> had<00:03:24.440> a<00:03:24.709> green<00:03:25.579> seven

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
example this is what I had a green seven

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.770 
example this is what I had a green seven
and<00:03:26.660> three<00:03:26.959> and<00:03:27.260> a<00:03:27.620> blue<00:03:28.489> for<00:03:28.849> the<00:03:29.359> highest<00:03:29.569> in

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
and three and a blue for the highest in

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.360 
and three and a blue for the highest in
each<00:03:29.870> card<00:03:30.109> I<00:03:30.290> would<00:03:30.349> get<00:03:30.560> a<00:03:30.590> total<00:03:30.769> of<00:03:30.980> eleven

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
each card I would get a total of eleven

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.129 
each card I would get a total of eleven
for<00:03:31.549> this<00:03:31.699> round<00:03:31.940> or<00:03:32.599> I<00:03:32.629> could<00:03:32.870> pick<00:03:32.959> the

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:33.139 
for this round or I could pick the

00:03:33.139 --> 00:03:35.110 
for this round or I could pick the
lowest<00:03:33.319> in<00:03:33.590> each<00:03:33.709> color<00:03:34.010> in<00:03:34.340> which<00:03:34.760> case<00:03:34.970> I

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:35.120 
lowest in each color in which case I

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.809 
lowest in each color in which case I
would<00:03:35.239> get<00:03:35.359> a<00:03:35.389> seven<00:03:35.840> or<00:03:35.989> I<00:03:36.620> could<00:03:36.859> pick<00:03:37.010> all<00:03:37.250> in

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:37.819 
would get a seven or I could pick all in

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:39.970 
would get a seven or I could pick all in
one<00:03:38.209> color<00:03:38.449> and<00:03:38.569> if<00:03:39.079> I<00:03:39.199> had<00:03:39.349> these<00:03:39.500> two<00:03:39.560> here<00:03:39.949> I

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:39.980 
one color and if I had these two here I

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.309 
one color and if I had these two here I
would<00:03:40.250> get<00:03:40.400> ten<00:03:40.639> points<00:03:40.849> or<00:03:41.660> I<00:03:41.690> could<00:03:41.989> pick<00:03:42.109> all

00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:42.319 
would get ten points or I could pick all

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:45.009 
would get ten points or I could pick all
cards<00:03:42.799> in<00:03:43.190> which<00:03:44.000> case<00:03:44.239> I'd<00:03:44.419> get<00:03:44.599> fourteen

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:45.019 
cards in which case I'd get fourteen

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:47.409 
cards in which case I'd get fourteen
points<00:03:45.470> the<00:03:45.919> thing<00:03:46.190> is<00:03:46.430> you<00:03:46.849> can<00:03:47.030> only<00:03:47.150> pick

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:47.419 
points the thing is you can only pick

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:50.470 
points the thing is you can only pick
one<00:03:47.750> of<00:03:47.900> these<00:03:47.989> scoring<00:03:48.379> things<00:03:48.739> per<00:03:49.400> round<00:03:49.699> so

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
one of these scoring things per round so

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.259 
one of these scoring things per round so
if<00:03:50.629> you<00:03:50.750> pick<00:03:51.049> the<00:03:51.319> all<00:03:51.500> of<00:03:51.919> one<00:03:52.310> color<00:03:52.340> you<00:03:52.910> can

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:53.269 
if you pick the all of one color you can

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:54.640 
if you pick the all of one color you can
never<00:03:53.419> do<00:03:53.599> that<00:03:53.720> again<00:03:53.870> for<00:03:54.230> the<00:03:54.319> rest<00:03:54.470> of<00:03:54.560> the

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
never do that again for the rest of the

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:56.080 
never do that again for the rest of the
game<00:03:54.829> there's<00:03:55.250> gonna<00:03:55.400> be<00:03:55.519> four<00:03:55.730> score<00:03:56.060> and

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.090 
game there's gonna be four score and

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.330 
game there's gonna be four score and
rounds<00:03:56.419> and<00:03:56.540> you<00:03:56.900> must<00:03:57.199> pick<00:03:57.470> each<00:03:57.889> one<00:03:58.220> of

00:03:58.330 --> 00:03:58.340 
rounds and you must pick each one of

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:59.830 
rounds and you must pick each one of
these<00:03:58.430> categories<00:03:58.699> once<00:03:59.239> per<00:03:59.449> game<00:03:59.480> that's

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
these categories once per game that's

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.390 
these categories once per game that's
really<00:04:00.169> the<00:04:00.290> game<00:04:00.440> in<00:04:00.590> a<00:04:00.650> nutshell<00:04:00.769> I<00:04:01.220> mean

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
really the game in a nutshell I mean

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.670 
really the game in a nutshell I mean
you're<00:04:02.209> taking<00:04:02.389> China<00:04:02.780> you're<00:04:03.260> breaking

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:03.680 
you're taking China you're breaking

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.680 
you're taking China you're breaking
China<00:04:03.889> and<00:04:04.250> then<00:04:04.760> you're<00:04:04.879> trying<00:04:05.030> to<00:04:05.180> score<00:04:05.540> at

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:05.690 
China and then you're trying to score at

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:07.930 
China and then you're trying to score at
the<00:04:05.780> right<00:04:05.930> possible<00:04:06.199> moment<00:04:06.739> and<00:04:06.889> I<00:04:07.430> I<00:04:07.579> think

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
the right possible moment and I I think

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.189 
the right possible moment and I I think
that's<00:04:08.209> more<00:04:08.480> of<00:04:08.540> it<00:04:08.690> than<00:04:08.780> anything<00:04:08.989> else

00:04:09.189 --> 00:04:09.199 
that's more of it than anything else

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:10.479 
that's more of it than anything else
that<00:04:09.379> you're<00:04:09.500> trying<00:04:09.709> to<00:04:09.799> score<00:04:10.099> but<00:04:10.310> you're

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:10.489 
that you're trying to score but you're

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:12.039 
that you're trying to score but you're
watching<00:04:10.699> what<00:04:11.030> everyone<00:04:11.299> else<00:04:11.449> scores<00:04:11.810> and

00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:12.049 
watching what everyone else scores and

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:13.629 
watching what everyone else scores and
you're<00:04:12.440> trying<00:04:12.680> to<00:04:12.769> manipulate<00:04:12.889> it<00:04:13.370> so<00:04:13.400> that

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:13.639 
you're trying to manipulate it so that

00:04:13.639 --> 00:04:15.909 
you're trying to manipulate it so that
they<00:04:13.790> have<00:04:14.569> to<00:04:14.780> either<00:04:14.959> buy<00:04:15.290> china<00:04:15.620> cards

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:15.919 
they have to either buy china cards

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:17.729 
they have to either buy china cards
which<00:04:16.099> aren't<00:04:16.489> worth<00:04:16.789> much<00:04:16.820> to<00:04:17.269> them<00:04:17.419> or

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
which aren't worth much to them or

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:20.949 
which aren't worth much to them or
destroy<00:04:18.739> china<00:04:19.190> cards<00:04:19.519> that<00:04:19.699> are<00:04:19.849> and<00:04:20.120> because

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
of that this is a very interactive game

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.180 
of that this is a very interactive game

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:33.020 
might slow the game down but it really

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:34.840 
might slow the game down but it really
doesn't<00:04:33.380> because<00:04:33.979> there's<00:04:34.130> only<00:04:34.190> a<00:04:34.310> few<00:04:34.520> cards

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:34.850

opponent<00:04:42.050> I<00:04:42.139> don't<00:04:42.169> see<00:04:42.440> that<00:04:42.560> as<00:04:42.710> much<00:04:42.740> but

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.220 
opponent I don't see that as much but

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:44.980 
opponent I don't see that as much but
it's<00:04:43.370> just<00:04:43.520> a<00:04:43.729> very<00:04:44.120> entertaining<00:04:44.360> ly<00:04:44.720> fast

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 
it's just a very entertaining ly fast

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.590 
it's just a very entertaining ly fast
game<00:04:45.260> and<00:04:45.470> trying<00:04:45.710> to<00:04:45.830> figure<00:04:46.040> out<00:04:46.190> which<00:04:46.790> you

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:47.600 
game and trying to figure out which you

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.450 
game and trying to figure out which you
know<00:04:47.750> which<00:04:48.260> one<00:04:48.440> of<00:04:48.470> the<00:04:48.590> four<00:04:48.740> categories<00:04:48.949> of

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:49.460 
know which one of the four categories of

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:51.689 
know which one of the four categories of
storage<00:04:49.790> time<00:04:50.090> to<00:04:50.540> me<00:04:50.690> that<00:04:50.930> that's<00:04:51.139> the<00:04:51.320> whole

00:04:51.689 --> 00:04:51.699 
storage time to me that that's the whole

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:54.400 
storage time to me that that's the whole
crux<00:04:52.699> of<00:04:52.880> the<00:04:53.000> game<00:04:53.180> I<00:04:53.360> really<00:04:53.930> enjoy<00:04:54.229> that

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:54.410 
crux of the game I really enjoy that

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:56.140 
crux of the game I really enjoy that
because<00:04:54.560> scoring<00:04:55.250> all<00:04:55.430> your<00:04:55.580> cards<00:04:55.880> is<00:04:55.970> a<00:04:56.030> lot

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:56.150 
because scoring all your cards is a lot

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:58.120 
because scoring all your cards is a lot
of<00:04:56.270> points<00:04:56.600> but<00:04:56.720> when<00:04:57.229> will<00:04:57.440> you<00:04:57.560> have<00:04:57.830> a<00:04:57.860> lot

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:58.130 
of points but when will you have a lot

00:04:58.130 --> 00:04:59.800 
of points but when will you have a lot
of<00:04:58.250> cards<00:04:58.550> you<00:04:58.760> have<00:04:58.940> a<00:04:58.970> decent<00:04:59.449> amount<00:04:59.510> in<00:04:59.720> the

00:04:59.800 --> 00:04:59.810 
of cards you have a decent amount in the

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:01.659 
of cards you have a decent amount in the
first<00:04:59.990> round<00:05:00.260> should<00:05:00.830> you<00:05:00.949> do<00:05:01.100> it<00:05:01.250> then

00:05:01.659 --> 00:05:01.669 
first round should you do it then

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:03.040 
first round should you do it then
or<00:05:02.000> should<00:05:02.240> you<00:05:02.270> wait<00:05:02.360> till<00:05:02.630> the<00:05:02.660> second

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.050 
or should you wait till the second

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:04.120 
or should you wait till the second
scoring<00:05:03.289> round<00:05:03.440> when<00:05:03.530> you<00:05:03.620> might<00:05:03.770> have<00:05:03.800> more

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:04.130 
scoring round when you might have more

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:06.159 
scoring round when you might have more
but<00:05:04.490> you<00:05:04.639> might<00:05:04.789> also<00:05:05.000> lose<00:05:05.330> most<00:05:05.630> of<00:05:05.840> them<00:05:05.990> and

00:05:06.159 --> 00:05:06.169 
but you might also lose most of them and

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:08.529 
but you might also lose most of them and
the<00:05:07.010> game<00:05:07.190> is<00:05:07.400> constantly<00:05:07.880> buying<00:05:08.210> China

00:05:08.529 --> 00:05:08.539 
the game is constantly buying China

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:10.090 
the game is constantly buying China
breaking<00:05:08.930> China<00:05:09.080> buying<00:05:09.380> China<00:05:09.710> breaking

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:10.100 
breaking China buying China breaking

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:12.010 
breaking China buying China breaking
China<00:05:10.280> and<00:05:10.760> it<00:05:10.910> only<00:05:11.030> takes<00:05:11.300> about<00:05:11.389> 20<00:05:11.990> minutes

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:12.020 
China and it only takes about 20 minutes

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.800 
China and it only takes about 20 minutes
to<00:05:12.350> play<00:05:12.560> and<00:05:12.860> with<00:05:13.460> 4<00:05:13.729> or<00:05:13.850> 5<00:05:13.880> players<00:05:14.330> there's

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:14.810 
to play and with 4 or 5 players there's

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:17.260 
to play and with 4 or 5 players there's
a<00:05:14.870> really<00:05:15.169> interactive<00:05:15.440> feel<00:05:15.889> it's<00:05:16.789> even<00:05:17.090> not

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:17.270 
a really interactive feel it's even not

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:19.240 
a really interactive feel it's even not
a<00:05:17.300> bad<00:05:17.720> game<00:05:17.990> for<00:05:18.229> 3<00:05:18.440> but<00:05:18.620> I<00:05:18.650> think<00:05:18.949> it<00:05:19.039> works

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:19.250 
a bad game for 3 but I think it works

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:22.090 
a bad game for 3 but I think it works
best<00:05:19.550> with<00:05:19.760> for<00:05:20.120> that<00:05:20.690> 2<00:05:21.590> players<00:05:21.830> is<00:05:21.979> not

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:22.100 
best with for that 2 players is not

00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.610 
best with for that 2 players is not
really<00:05:22.310> possible<00:05:22.520> a<00:05:23.030> fast<00:05:23.690> bowler<00:05:23.990> with

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:24.620 
really possible a fast bowler with

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:26.350 
really possible a fast bowler with
excellent<00:05:25.100> artwork<00:05:25.400> I<00:05:25.550> like<00:05:25.880> the<00:05:26.030> pictures<00:05:26.330> of

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:26.360 
excellent artwork I like the pictures of

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.330 
excellent artwork I like the pictures of
the<00:05:26.570> bowls<00:05:26.780> and<00:05:27.050> the<00:05:27.289> cards<00:05:27.770> are<00:05:27.860> very<00:05:28.130> good

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:28.340 
the bowls and the cards are very good

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:31.779 
the bowls and the cards are very good
quality<00:05:28.610> and<00:05:29.110> the<00:05:30.110> the<00:05:31.039> only<00:05:31.070> thing<00:05:31.340> I<00:05:31.400> guess<00:05:31.760> I

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:31.789 
quality and the the only thing I guess I

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:34.029 
quality and the the only thing I guess I
would<00:05:31.970> complain<00:05:32.240> about<00:05:32.300> is<00:05:32.750> that<00:05:33.289> they<00:05:33.830> have

00:05:34.029 --> 00:05:34.039 
would complain about is that they have

00:05:34.039 --> 00:05:35.469 
would complain about is that they have
red<00:05:34.280> and<00:05:34.400> green<00:05:34.460> cards<00:05:35.000> and<00:05:35.210> they<00:05:35.300> look

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:35.479 
red and green cards and they look

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:37.510 
red and green cards and they look
exactly<00:05:35.810> the<00:05:36.050> same<00:05:36.380> I<00:05:36.620> would<00:05:37.160> think<00:05:37.280> that<00:05:37.370> they

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:37.520 
exactly the same I would think that they

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:38.890 
exactly the same I would think that they
should<00:05:37.729> have<00:05:37.760> made<00:05:38.000> them<00:05:38.090> look<00:05:38.510> a<00:05:38.599> little<00:05:38.720> bit

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:38.900 
should have made them look a little bit

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.600 
should have made them look a little bit
different<00:05:39.169> but<00:05:39.260> everything<00:05:39.470> fits<00:05:39.830> inside<00:05:40.400> a

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:40.610 
different but everything fits inside a

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:41.379 
different but everything fits inside a
nice<00:05:40.880> box

00:05:41.379 --> 00:05:41.389 
nice box

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:44.589 
nice box
you<00:05:42.349> know<00:05:42.919> the<00:05:43.160> card<00:05:43.610> decks<00:05:43.820> fit<00:05:44.030> in<00:05:44.120> here

00:05:44.589 --> 00:05:44.599 
you know the card decks fit in here

00:05:44.599 --> 00:05:46.930 
you know the card decks fit in here
the<00:05:44.900> scoring<00:05:45.229> sheets<00:05:45.590> you<00:05:46.130> don't<00:05:46.310> really<00:05:46.639> need

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:46.940 
the scoring sheets you don't really need

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:49.000 
the scoring sheets you don't really need
them<00:05:47.240> I<00:05:47.419> suppose<00:05:48.200> you<00:05:48.289> only<00:05:48.349> need<00:05:48.560> one<00:05:48.800> then

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:49.010 
them I suppose you only need one then

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:50.140 
them I suppose you only need one then
you<00:05:49.099> just<00:05:49.220> mark<00:05:49.430> it<00:05:49.490> down<00:05:49.550> a<00:05:49.639> separate<00:05:50.000> sheet

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:50.150 
you just mark it down a separate sheet

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:51.730 
you just mark it down a separate sheet
of<00:05:50.240> paper<00:05:50.360> there's<00:05:50.960> enough<00:05:51.229> here<00:05:51.410> for<00:05:51.440> maybe

00:05:51.730 --> 00:05:51.740 
of paper there's enough here for maybe

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:55.060 
of paper there's enough here for maybe
10<00:05:52.610> games<00:05:52.940> or<00:05:53.180> so<00:05:53.360> using<00:05:54.320> just<00:05:54.560> as<00:05:54.740> scoring

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:55.070 
10 games or so using just as scoring

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:57.219 
10 games or so using just as scoring
sheets<00:05:55.340> but<00:05:55.580> I<00:05:55.639> would<00:05:56.120> say<00:05:56.240> after<00:05:56.479> that<00:05:56.599> you

00:05:57.219 --> 00:05:57.229 
sheets but I would say after that you

00:05:57.229 --> 00:05:58.570 
sheets but I would say after that you
just<00:05:57.289> hang<00:05:57.560> on<00:05:57.710> to<00:05:57.830> one<00:05:57.979> scoring<00:05:58.310> sheet<00:05:58.490> and

00:05:58.570 --> 00:05:58.580 
just hang on to one scoring sheet and

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:00.689 
just hang on to one scoring sheet and
use<00:05:58.669> a<00:05:58.699> regular<00:05:59.060> piece<00:05:59.270> of<00:05:59.300> paper<00:05:59.440> very<00:06:00.440> easy

00:06:00.689 --> 00:06:00.699 
use a regular piece of paper very easy

00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:03.400 
use a regular piece of paper very easy
