00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:08.049
 heras and droppers to a new tutorial 

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:10.240
 endow good and we will learn something 

00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:12.400
 basic and it's like making stacks with the kun 

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.190
 here with the torrent quite simple if 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:17.320
 we have with tinker to take out his apothecary 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.779
 or if not for ourselves to be able 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.359
 It is quite simple, we are going to 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:24.460
 game and good the idea is this stay in 

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:27.279
 safe areas where they will not appear 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.349
 our magic creeps for example 

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:32.290
 this is a safe area or if not a 

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:34.629
 part of hyundai in this the 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:37.930
 version ensures good forgiveness that we 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:41.800
 ensures and this we are going to the grain at the minute 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:45.570
 57 we throw the torrent and 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.570
 will see what is based 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:57.010
 every second 57 what we are going to do 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:58.929
 we are power 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.960
 this is what we get scripts 

00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:03.969
 yes, good for us for x or e motive 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.180
 let's go here we get closer we put torrent 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:09.549
 in 57 minutes and season jones it 's pretty 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.770
 we can do it one or the other and 

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:14.590
 again as long as this kind of 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.180
 stax magical scripts do not appear and 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.700
 we do it in this part those 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.440
 scripts that are white and they are going to 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.530
 load the states since they do not 

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:27.250
 they can elevate so it does not affect them 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.899
 no magic only if they are 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.479
 similar to the ancestral ones that do not 

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:33.130
 affects any kind of magic then they go 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:35.110
 to occur problems we will be of 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.330
 again then let's place the 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.590
 torrent here hopefully we will raise all 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.240
 the clips because you have to pick them up 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:44.789
 mandatory or not is not going us 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.789
 operate 56-57 current measurement 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:52.570
 to be born now the students have 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:55.250
 centaurs, we have these shits 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:58.450
 thieves the causes 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.450
 sergio cause k 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.430
 etcetera we have to be clear every 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:09.270
 moment each place the key again 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:12.240
 we have to place at 57 this torrent and 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:14.870
 so let's do stacks over and over and 

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.870
 again, always 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.870
 and as I say this type of stack is 

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:26.910
 ago when we go to the base 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.520
 what do I know at some time when 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:32.880
 let us be in the king who maximizes the splash 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.680
 and the X and the WTI for the combo and then 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:36.450
 the torrent only angel to levels 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.210
 good those that handle the conca or which 

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:43.200
 almost way that is one of the best 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:47.030
 Well better is that 15 that to be able 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:47.030
 kill someone or if not equal play 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:54.270
 so they gave us shares, another was born 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:59.040
 centaur the shell we get it 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:59.040
 at amateur level 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.670
 do not 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:09.760
 I am use 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.450
 but we already realized how is the 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:15.940
 combo the stack if we realize with 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.500
 many many many scripts and how to 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:20.100
 I say it's quite simple to touch that 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.100
 practice 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:25.940
 this variation all boys see you 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.670
 then in the next video how 

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:31.390
 good 

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:35.620
 as you are told 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:38.260
 of these micro tutorials teach them 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.850
 secrets of some people who do not 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.660
 they know good if they start calling 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:42.660
 children rats 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.510
 rooms 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.930
 then in a next video 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.780
 see you later 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:08.049
