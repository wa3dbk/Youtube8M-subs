yesterday<00:00:24.480> I<00:00:24.689> got<00:00:24.840> an<00:00:24.930> idea<00:00:25.019> um<00:00:26.359> this<00:00:27.359> is<00:00:27.630> just

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
yesterday I got an idea um this is just

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.460 
yesterday I got an idea um this is just
simple<00:00:28.949> blue<00:00:29.340> polystyrene<00:00:30.240> nothing<00:00:31.140> special

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
simple blue polystyrene nothing special

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.740 
simple blue polystyrene nothing special
about<00:00:31.769> it<00:00:32.120> I'm<00:00:33.120> going<00:00:33.239> to<00:00:33.329> show<00:00:33.420> you<00:00:33.480> how<00:00:33.570> to

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
about it I'm going to show you how to

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.700 
about it I'm going to show you how to
use<00:00:33.840> this<00:00:34.200> to<00:00:34.260> make<00:00:34.500> something<00:00:34.800> similar<00:00:35.399> um

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:36.710

what<00:00:37.710> you're<00:00:37.920> looking<00:00:38.430> at<00:00:38.870> is<00:00:40.219> I<00:00:41.219> call<00:00:42.180> it<00:00:42.300> the

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:44.660 

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.770 

like<00:00:45.660> a<00:00:46.430> stone<00:00:47.430> ice<00:00:47.670> titan<00:00:48.000> I'm<00:00:48.420> not<00:00:48.570> sure

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
like a stone ice titan I'm not sure

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.590 
like a stone ice titan I'm not sure
exactly<00:00:49.110> what<00:00:49.260> I<00:00:49.289> what<00:00:50.100> I<00:00:50.129> would<00:00:50.399> call<00:00:50.579> it<00:00:50.640> but

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
exactly what I what I would call it but

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.069 
exactly what I what I would call it but
once<00:00:52.350> again<00:00:52.469> for<00:00:52.949> scale<00:00:53.340> there's<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.449> the

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
once again for scale there's the the

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.200 
once again for scale there's the the
figure<00:00:55.440> and<00:00:56.039> all<00:00:56.430> I<00:00:56.460> did<00:00:56.760> was<00:00:57.469> use<00:00:58.469> this

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
figure and all I did was use this

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.599 
figure and all I did was use this
tearing<00:01:00.210> up<00:01:00.379> bits<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:01.680> then<00:01:01.949> cutting<00:01:02.219> on<00:01:02.430> that

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
tearing up bits and then cutting on that

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.119 
tearing up bits and then cutting on that
angle<00:01:02.850> so<00:01:03.210> they<00:01:03.390> would<00:01:03.539> fit<00:01:03.750> together<00:01:04.129> you

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
angle so they would fit together you

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.250 
angle so they would fit together you
know<00:01:05.299> you<00:01:06.299> don't<00:01:06.390> want<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.689> joints<00:01:07.049> to<00:01:07.140> be

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
know you don't want the joints to be

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.929 
know you don't want the joints to be
super<00:01:07.650> obvious<00:01:07.830> but<00:01:08.340> you<00:01:08.490> want<00:01:08.700> to<00:01:08.790> have

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
super obvious but you want to have

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.440 
super obvious but you want to have
enough<00:01:09.240> surface<00:01:09.570> area<00:01:10.070> that<00:01:11.070> it'll<00:01:12.000> connect

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
enough surface area that it'll connect

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.649 
enough surface area that it'll connect
well<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:12.990> then<00:01:13.799> what<00:01:14.369> i<00:01:14.400> did<00:01:14.670> was<00:01:15.180> i<00:01:15.360> hollowed

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
well and then what i did was i hollowed

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.899 
well and then what i did was i hollowed
out<00:01:15.840> an<00:01:15.990> area<00:01:16.229> i<00:01:16.590> wanted<00:01:17.280> to<00:01:17.340> have<00:01:17.430> kind<00:01:17.700> of<00:01:17.759> a

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
out an area i wanted to have kind of a

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.539 
out an area i wanted to have kind of a
bluish<00:01:18.630> ice<00:01:18.869> orb<00:01:21.200> be<00:01:22.200> the<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.950> power<00:01:23.159> source

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
bluish ice orb be the the power source

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.230 
bluish ice orb be the the power source
for<00:01:23.880> this<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.360> then<00:01:25.110> I<00:01:25.140> utilized<00:01:25.890> my<00:01:26.369> my<00:01:27.030> heat

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
for this and then I utilized my my heat

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.069 
for this and then I utilized my my heat
tool<00:01:27.290> my<00:01:28.290> soldering<00:01:28.740> iron<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:29.420> I<00:01:30.420> burnt<00:01:30.810> in

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
tool my soldering iron and I burnt in

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:37.429 
tool my soldering iron and I burnt in
these<00:01:34.189> open<00:01:35.189> areas<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:36.060> then<00:01:36.900> I<00:01:36.930> wanted<00:01:37.380> to

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
these open areas and then I wanted to

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:43.010 
these open areas and then I wanted to
have<00:01:37.560> cracks<00:01:38.040> going<00:01:38.520> up<00:01:38.729> it<00:01:41.420> and<00:01:42.420> kind<00:01:42.780> of<00:01:42.840> see

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
have cracks going up it and kind of see

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:51.020 
have cracks going up it and kind of see
the<00:01:43.140> crack<00:01:43.380> work<00:01:43.649> there<00:01:45.590> and<00:01:47.119> then<00:01:48.119> um<00:01:49.700> mmm<00:01:50.700> so

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.230 
the crack work there and then um mmm so
it<00:01:51.119> has<00:01:51.149> like<00:01:51.420> kind<00:01:51.750> of<00:01:51.780> a<00:01:51.899> stone<00:01:52.229> ice<00:01:52.590> core

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
it has like kind of a stone ice core

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.719 
it has like kind of a stone ice core
kind<00:01:54.240> of<00:01:54.420> thing<00:01:54.659> and<00:01:55.009> then<00:01:56.009> what<00:01:56.280> I<00:01:56.310> did<00:01:56.520> is<00:01:56.640> I

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.980 
then I went up with a pale blue and then
I<00:02:34.920> highlighted<00:02:35.810> around<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:37.640> the<00:02:38.990> polystyrene

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
I highlighted around the the polystyrene

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:44.960 
I highlighted around the the polystyrene
that<00:02:40.320> was<00:02:40.440> exposed<00:02:40.890> in<00:02:41.540> Titan<00:02:42.540> white<00:02:42.900> and<00:02:43.970> it

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
that was exposed in Titan white and it

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.970 
that was exposed in Titan white and it
gives<00:02:45.300> you<00:02:45.480> this<00:02:45.660> really<00:02:46.020> interesting<00:02:48.980> effect

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
gives you this really interesting effect

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.600 
gives you this really interesting effect
like<00:02:50.790> it's<00:02:51.000> glowing<00:02:52.010> and<00:02:53.010> I<00:02:53.100> still<00:02:53.340> got<00:02:53.430> to<00:02:53.520> go

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
like it's glowing and I still got to go

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.100 
like it's glowing and I still got to go
through<00:02:53.640> with<00:02:53.970> the<00:02:54.120> tweezers<00:02:54.330> and<00:02:54.720> pick<00:02:54.930> out

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
through with the tweezers and pick out

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:56.960 
through with the tweezers and pick out
some<00:02:55.380> of<00:02:55.470> the<00:02:55.530> black<00:02:55.830> that's<00:02:56.160> that's<00:02:56.520> still<00:02:56.820> in

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:56.970 
some of the black that's that's still in

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:59.720 
some of the black that's that's still in
there<00:02:57.410> but<00:02:58.410> I<00:02:58.890> thought<00:02:59.310> it<00:02:59.459> was<00:02:59.550> rather

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
there but I thought it was rather

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:06.530 
there but I thought it was rather
effective<00:03:00.360> and<00:03:01.250> oh<00:03:02.250> and<00:03:03.030> I<00:03:03.209> got<00:03:05.330> just<00:03:06.330> hard

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
effective and oh and I got just hard

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:09.020 
effective and oh and I got just hard
board<00:03:06.810> and<00:03:07.140> cut<00:03:07.500> a<00:03:07.560> standard<00:03:08.130> size<00:03:08.280> base<00:03:08.580> in<00:03:08.880> it

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
board and cut a standard size base in it

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.300 
board and cut a standard size base in it
but<00:03:09.959> I<00:03:10.230> think<00:03:10.380> it's<00:03:10.709> got<00:03:10.830> a<00:03:10.860> really<00:03:11.040> dramatic

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
but I think it's got a really dramatic

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:17.420 
but I think it's got a really dramatic
look<00:03:11.850> to<00:03:12.750> it<00:03:12.900> I<00:03:13.140> like<00:03:13.620> it<00:03:13.830> and<00:03:16.010> it's<00:03:17.010> something

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
look to it I like it and it's something

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:20.930 
look to it I like it and it's something
