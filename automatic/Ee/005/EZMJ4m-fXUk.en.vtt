00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:10.450
 He plays now in the game. 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:28.770
 the use of idea 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.940
 d'alessandro and nilmar who are two 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.910
 players who will only reach the 

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:34.500
 weekend them 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.000
 so even those who can not afford to 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.680
 affirm nothing now even because it has the 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.030
 judgment also by alessandro 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.620
 I keep working with the 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.970
 possibilities, including in the training of 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.339
 this morning when you want to track 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:45.809
 possibility of designing one or 

00:00:44.339 --> 00:00:48.000
 another situation I will be able to count on him 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.879
 the newspaper that how legally 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.739
 to be able to count or not be evidently ti 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.570
 monitor the media and has 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.250
 accompanied in the last days knows that 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.780
 there is a very strong repercussion on 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.019
 relation to some events of the 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.750
 of week and it's for you 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:06.420
 these events what was said did not 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.240
 ends up not being anything related 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:13.229
 to the reality you can relate to 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:15.660
 and the opinions and greatness and maturity 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:17.490
 of a guy who is already quite focused 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:21.660
 time in football and knows absorb all 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:24.060
 criticism is constructive only 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.380
 Care to put you that information 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.670
 and these are not liable to 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.600
 that they are reliable 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.760
 Only this you think it is these subjects. 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.850
 these questions are raised are 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:38.550
 placed only because the result of 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.960
 field it is not positive of not home 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:43.080
 because they are real 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.000
 some laps and some facts they are 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:46.950
 interpreted in one form or another 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.450
 due to the result, we already know the 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.720
 What happens there, nobody wants a fact. 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.720
 none 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:56.460
 does not create gives us a greater repercussion 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.140
 depending on one or another situation 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.260
 maybe I understand you said some 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.000
 situations are real is this 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.990
 no one wanted at least 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.850
 I deliberately believe that no one 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.350
 wanted that someone surely creates the 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.119
 audience who will be listening to the 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.380
 that have a critical meaning and to maintain 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:15.600
 condition of evaluating not I said 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:18.030
 opinion policy and I respect and 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:21.210
 information just how to take care of this kind of 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.760
 opposing ideas that are not 

00:02:21.210 --> 00:02:25.910
 the game that had a conversation 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.510
 with skinny 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.030
 [Music] 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.890
 It's been a long time. 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.700
 time you once I put the 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.580
 I say 

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:38.700
 the idea of withdrawal is not of magan 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.860
 the wheel is then left the edinho will 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.200
 ask me good, I think it's a kiss 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.090
 So I replied that it is not the withdrawal of 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.740
 A flyer because at that moment I was 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.800
 I was in a good moment to use 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:51.090
 of a team situation is more aggressive 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.680
 a circumstance at home in a game 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:55.500
 important flame wins remember that the 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.560
 I did it against sao paulo 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.180
 circumstance of the game more than the name 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.680
 last Tuesday you came 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.860
 for your press conference 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:07.470
 crestfallen face closed some bad 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:11.550
 Mood until appeared today you arrive 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:13.620
 smiling playing is only 1 to 0 against 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:17.130
 Portuguese beauty that no no I'm not 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:20.910
 I also do not tolerate I'm not happy 

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:22.860
 I do not want to and I have the exact notion 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.200
 that the international of which he is 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:27.420
 position I have the exact notion 

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:29.940
 also my work when he took over the 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:33.209
 international team position him 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.590
 was and the 51% of use that 

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:36.630
 After I got here in a moment 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.340
 Difficult transition that I had 

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:41.040
 aware of it also that for example 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:43.140
 a campaign that is two-point and 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.420
 half of difference from sao paulo 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.250
 this percentage of utilization 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:50.489
 could be in a better situation 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:52.890
 fighting for a liberator and I have 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:55.140
 consciousness but is aware that 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:57.980
 It's not where I'd like to be. 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:03.000
 it is not a place where international deserves 

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:05.489
 tite is to have a group of players is 15 16 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.650
 players are pointed out as the 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:10.140
 players at title level 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:13.709
 This is positive or negative to be 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:16.380
 positive as it rises elevates the 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:19.440
 competitiveness that you have been wanting 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:20.970
 group work loyalty and compete 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.720
 because the technical book can be 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.699
 improved 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.590
 the stage of sets of 

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:27.990
 find the team that is the stage that the 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:30.360
 People find you have this evil I 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:31.080
 I have work, yes, I have the search for 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.900
 each one 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.910
 day-to-day life and the question of 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.949
 group and if it is more the 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:41.190
 confidence she has only one thing that is 

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:42.900
 fundamental the time behavior that 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:44.520
 does not pass and does not build a team 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:45.449
 making beating the money of one day 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.330
 To the other 

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:50.910
 in the group of athletes who are entering 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:52.770
 knowing and recognizing what kind 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:55.199
 It is the coach that kind of behavior 

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:57.810
 He has the good time at the bad time. 

00:04:55.199 --> 00:05:00.810
 time allows this and does not 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:03.450
 creates everything in a fight that is not for 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:05.430
 kills this time and ceases with the 

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:08.360
 importance of winning outside the home 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:10.440
 because it had 6 for the liberators is 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:12.690
 fundamental 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:15.780
 I said god, I put it before 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:17.490
 had the entire campaign from the beginning 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:19.500
 that this percentage of utilization 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:21.660
 When I got here, I wanted more. 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.700
 we are a victory to get into the fight 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:25.979
 now we are the two can be a 

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:27.539
 way it becomes essential that I 

00:05:25.979 --> 00:05:29.729
 I put two of these four 

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:31.740
 objective games we have make ten 

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:32.880
 points that we spent the first era 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.830
 important to win 

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:36.810
 it was important to win not to find 

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:39.539
 further details of the situation also 

00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:41.340
 not at any cost does not change that idea 

00:05:39.539 --> 00:05:43.349
 but it is important to note we have three 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.949
 games in Brazil we will do seven 

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:45.840
 points 

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:48.240
 I already saw a specific work 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:50.400
 with the defensive sector and today we are 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.590
 planning differently to face the 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:54.510
 Botafogo is necessary to return this of course is 

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:56.760
 a defensive consistency is a 

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:59.340
 Aggression is also professional 

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:01.229
 ti for example the game we did against 

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:05.500
 the state of Rio de Janeiro is its 

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:07.180
 opportunities that wanted to kill me is t 

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:10.870
 is a pattern similar to what happened 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:13.240
 it is important to take these examples 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:17.380
 own team has had so that she can 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:19.420
 to design the team president I started 

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:20.710
 to do these possibilities does not have a 

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:22.690
 definition I still have to see the 

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:26.040
 players recover the legal situation and 

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:26.040
 d'alessandro to design
