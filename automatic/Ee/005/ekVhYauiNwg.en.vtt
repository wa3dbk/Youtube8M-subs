abdomen after initial identification of
attacked<00:01:10.680> it<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.790> vet<00:01:12.030> has<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.540> find<00:01:12.810> out<00:01:13.049> what

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
attacked it the vet has to find out what

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.880 
attacked it the vet has to find out what
the<00:01:13.860> root<00:01:14.040> cause<00:01:14.340> of<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.880> problem<00:01:15.270> is<00:01:15.890> the

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
the root cause of the problem is the

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.100 
the root cause of the problem is the
fluid<00:01:17.250> within<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.850> animals<00:01:18.240> abdomen<00:01:18.810> can

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
fluid within the animals abdomen can

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.140 
fluid within the animals abdomen can
tell<00:01:19.290> us<00:01:19.439> a<00:01:19.470> lot<00:01:19.770> about<00:01:19.979> what<00:01:20.369> is<00:01:20.549> causing<00:01:20.850> it

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
tell us a lot about what is causing it

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:27.070 
tell us a lot about what is causing it
Actives<00:01:23.630> okay<00:01:24.630> basically<00:01:25.140> what<00:01:25.650> do<00:01:26.100> when<00:01:26.670> the

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080 
Actives okay basically what do when the

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.899 
Actives okay basically what do when the
slightest<00:01:28.080> case<00:01:28.470> comes<00:01:28.770> in<00:01:29.009> is<00:01:29.189> we<00:01:29.369> do<00:01:29.520> what's

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
slightest case comes in is we do what's

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.090 
slightest case comes in is we do what's
called<00:01:29.970> a<00:01:30.240> double<00:01:30.570> dose<00:01:30.659> and<00:01:30.900> thesis<00:01:31.320> so<00:01:31.920> what

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
called a double dose and thesis so what

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.580 
called a double dose and thesis so what
we<00:01:32.220> do<00:01:32.340> is<00:01:32.460> we<00:01:32.610> stick<00:01:32.850> a<00:01:32.880> needle<00:01:33.360> in<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:34.140> we

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
we do is we stick a needle in and we

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.830 
we do is we stick a needle in and we
extract<00:01:34.950> some<00:01:35.159> of<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.369> fluid<00:01:35.700> after<00:01:36.329> which<00:01:36.689> we

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
extract some of the fluid after which we

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.929 
extract some of the fluid after which we
sell<00:01:37.020> it<00:01:37.170> off<00:01:37.290> my<00:01:37.470> dialysis<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.430> fluid<00:01:38.759> is

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
sell it off my dialysis the fluid is

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.719 
sell it off my dialysis the fluid is
then<00:01:39.180> sent<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.869> a<00:01:40.229> laboratory<00:01:40.590> for<00:01:40.950> analysis

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
then sent to a laboratory for analysis

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.420 
then sent to a laboratory for analysis
using<00:01:42.659> information<00:01:43.049> on<00:01:43.590> what<00:01:43.799> the<00:01:43.950> course<00:01:44.250> of

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
using information on what the course of

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.749 
using information on what the course of
a<00:01:44.520> scientist<00:01:45.000> might<00:01:45.600> know<00:01:46.079> what<00:01:46.439> this

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759 
a scientist might know what this

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:50.060 
a scientist might know what this
analysis<00:01:47.759> does<00:01:48.060> is<00:01:48.390> it<00:01:48.630> allows<00:01:49.409> us<00:01:49.680> to<00:01:49.860> narrow

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
analysis does is it allows us to narrow

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.249 
analysis does is it allows us to narrow
down<00:01:50.280> the<00:01:50.460> course<00:01:50.790> of<00:01:51.060> why<00:01:51.329> does<00:01:51.390> this<00:01:51.840> fluid

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
down the course of why does this fluid

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.810 
down the course of why does this fluid
buildup<00:01:52.649> for<00:01:53.520> example<00:01:53.939> if<00:01:54.180> it's<00:01:54.390> just<00:01:54.659> a<00:01:54.840> pure

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
buildup for example if it's just a pure

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.480 
buildup for example if it's just a pure
liquid<00:01:56.820> for<00:01:57.659> just<00:01:58.020> several<00:01:58.530> cells<00:01:58.829> it<00:01:59.250> could

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
liquid for just several cells it could

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:00.170 
liquid for just several cells it could
be<00:01:59.610> because

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
be because

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.600 
be because
a<00:02:00.210> heart<00:02:01.080> problem<00:02:01.590> so<00:02:01.800> maybe<00:02:02.010> congestive

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
a heart problem so maybe congestive

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.690 
a heart problem so maybe congestive
heart<00:02:02.640> failure<00:02:02.930> so<00:02:03.930> this<00:02:04.830> information<00:02:04.980> allows

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
heart failure so this information allows

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.469 
heart failure so this information allows
us<00:02:05.760> to<00:02:06.210> narrow<00:02:06.420> down<00:02:06.720> the<00:02:07.440> problem<00:02:07.920> basically

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
us to narrow down the problem basically

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.820 
us to narrow down the problem basically
ascites<00:02:09.479> could<00:02:09.899> be<00:02:09.990> caused<00:02:10.259> by<00:02:10.530> several

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
ascites could be caused by several

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.900 
ascites could be caused by several
conditions<00:02:12.350> first<00:02:13.350> of<00:02:13.620> which<00:02:13.830> is<00:02:14.160> right-sided
