00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
algorithm man no you want to let go of

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.209 
algorithm man no you want to let go of
the<00:00:45.360> power<00:00:45.570> or<00:00:45.899> else<00:00:46.500> it'll<00:00:46.680> just<00:00:46.860> be<00:00:47.039> in<00:00:47.129> a

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:50.420 
the power or else it'll just be in a
loop<00:00:47.399> of<00:00:47.579> restarting<00:00:48.570> so<00:00:48.950> hold<00:00:49.950> down<00:00:50.039> the

power home and up like that let go when

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.830 
power home and up like that let go when
that<00:00:55.379> comes<00:00:55.739> up<00:00:56.000> and<00:00:57.000> then<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.329> Android<00:00:57.629> man
