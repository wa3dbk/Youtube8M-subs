00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:10.670
 Hello everyone 

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:15.590
 My name is Yoneda from Meijo University Women's Ekiden coach 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:20.060
 South of March a today to everyone that aims to balance not a famous 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:26.450
 I would like to talk about how to choose shoes 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:28.039
 An important point in choosing the shoes will have someday one by one talk about to the point 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:31.039
 We will carry out 

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:33.240
 Recent surgery is very good performance 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:37.970
 Many light shoes are out 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:43.010
 If Ka but you tend to think Fu that it would do run easier 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:47.630
 That it is light has gathered only the minimum function so much 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:51.620
 That's why novices still choose shoes 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:56.540
 Firmly absorb the impact 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:01:05.550
 For example, yes , say in the part of this sole 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:08.390
 If the thickness to rescue and absorb this shock of the heel is still firmly to some extent 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.390
 I think it's good 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:15.700
 Approximate their body weight of about 3 times 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:18.850
 It is said that it will come upon impact 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:27.080
 So it is on absorbing the impact 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:32.960
 For beginners, I think it is important to first choose thick bottom shoes 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:41.180
 Here are the shoes that ad and Lander put on at the time of the race 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:42.530
 When the thickness of the portion of this card is about half as compared to the earlier of a housewife 

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:47.750
 Do you think 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:48.890
 This kind of shoes is really running and of course wearing to try Toka Ruiru to speed exits 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:55.729
 It is easy 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:57.659
 It is firmly equipped with muscle strength and the training just to be it on the spit this surgery 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:03.420
 I have to leave the lander 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:05.710
 On the contrary that you will not be able to make wear this shoe using this shoe in daily training 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:09.369
 If 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:12.370
 Pain in the muscles or pain in the joints 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:17.530
 Because it becomes easy to get injured 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:23.140
 There is only the thickness of the person who can do more of beginners 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:24.140
 It is one of the important points to choose such a storage that absorbs shock well 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.100
 think 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.319
 Yes the second point a 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:34.749
 Shoes 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:40.030
 It is but that's to fit well how much their feet 

00:02:34.749 --> 00:02:41.520
 a The condition of the foot is when you wake up in the morning and then in the evening 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:46.710
 When you leave 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:52.430
 You have changed at all size is also the same, for example, 26 centimeters of leg 

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:56.390
 So the evening time zone is the time to choose shoes 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:59.390
 Good at is said to Fu that or not is people who are doing it from the usual plating 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:03.620
 After the end of the of the training 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:07.790
 I think that it is good to choose such shoes 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:12.810
 At that time firmly on the foot 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:13.780
 As a point to try to let the yarn especially select the toe part 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:19.510
 Good 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:22.890
 It means that it has room of 1 cm to 1.5 cm 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:25.930
 It is good for Japanese people 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:30.480
 It becomes such a habit to wear shoes 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:32.670
 If I wear shoes like that 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.660
 Spear 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:38.720
 Because play is in shoes 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:42.840
 I hurt my toes or a 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:48.760
 It's very easy to get hurt in this way too 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:51.750
 That there is a margin of 1 cm to 1.5 cm on the toe 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:55.260
 It will be an important point 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:04:03.120
 By all means we are living now firmly training 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:06.500
 I also hope that in the home race of March 10, I can renew my personal best even in one second 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:06.500
 Please do your best by all means
