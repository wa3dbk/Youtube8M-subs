way anyways what I would do is I get
super<00:02:43.410> glue<00:02:43.590> and<00:02:43.830> I<00:02:43.860> put<00:02:44.280> it<00:02:44.370> in<00:02:44.840> this<00:02:45.840> little

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
super glue and I put it in this little

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.060 
super glue and I put it in this little
area<00:02:46.620> right<00:02:46.860> here<00:02:48.080> and<00:02:49.080> then<00:02:49.410> I<00:02:49.650> would<00:02:49.830> just

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
area right here and then I would just

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:59.470 
area right here and then I would just
sit<00:02:50.280> there

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:13.410 

stick<00:03:00.110> it<00:03:00.230> over<00:03:00.319> the<00:03:00.650> bottom

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.589 

anyways<00:03:14.290> say<00:03:14.830> it's<00:03:15.250> the<00:03:15.790> Super<00:03:16.180> Bowl<00:03:16.209> just

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:16.599 
anyways say it's the Super Bowl just

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:18.210 
anyways say it's the Super Bowl just
make<00:03:16.810> sure<00:03:17.020> it's<00:03:17.170> about<00:03:17.380> it<00:03:17.500> stings<00:03:17.830> it

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
make sure it's about it stings it

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.250 
make sure it's about it stings it
doesn't<00:03:18.930> go<00:03:19.930> which<00:03:21.690> its<00:03:22.690> you<00:03:22.810> look<00:03:22.959> is<00:03:23.080> going

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
doesn't go which its you look is going

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:39.680 
doesn't go which its you look is going
to<00:03:23.319> come<00:03:23.440> off<00:03:23.560> here<00:03:23.860> but<00:03:24.010> you<00:03:24.130> never<00:03:24.310> know

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:45.800 

ok<00:03:40.410> she<00:03:40.620> could<00:03:40.770> use<00:03:40.950> it<00:03:41.100> without

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:51.440 

what<00:03:46.470> will<00:03:46.590> probably<00:03:46.739> just<00:03:47.099> be<00:03:47.190> better<00:03:50.450> making

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
what will probably just be better making

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:58.980 
what will probably just be better making
sure<00:03:51.720> that<00:03:51.959> it<00:03:52.080> stays

00:03:58.980 --> 00:03:58.990 

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:01.020 

but<00:03:59.620> I'm<00:03:59.710> sure<00:03:59.950> you<00:04:00.100> could<00:04:00.250> do<00:04:00.460> it<00:04:00.580> I<00:04:00.640> group<00:04:00.880> the

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
but I'm sure you could do it I group the

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:20.880 
but I'm sure you could do it I group the
small<00:04:01.420> ones<00:04:01.690> like<00:04:06.420> too<00:04:07.420> babe

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:20.890 

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:29.550 

works

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:38.680 

do<00:04:30.370> it<00:04:30.490> that<00:04:30.639> way<00:04:30.790> though

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690
