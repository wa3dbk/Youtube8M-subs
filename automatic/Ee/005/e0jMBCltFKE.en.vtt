another hot-button issue is a
cholesterol<00:00:03.149> and<00:00:03.560> people<00:00:04.560> go<00:00:04.710> back<00:00:04.890> and<00:00:05.100> forth

will<00:00:11.309> try<00:00:11.429> to<00:00:11.490> drive<00:00:11.730> that<00:00:11.880> number<00:00:12.179> into<00:00:12.330> the

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:12.450 
will try to drive that number into the

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.560 
will try to drive that number into the
ground<00:00:13.190> where<00:00:14.190> do<00:00:14.309> you<00:00:14.400> stand<00:00:14.639> on<00:00:14.880> that<00:00:15.210> whole

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
ground where do you stand on that whole

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.650 
ground where do you stand on that whole
issue<00:00:15.859> we<00:00:16.859> need<00:00:16.890> cholesterol<00:00:17.430> for<00:00:18.180> many

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
issue we need cholesterol for many

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.960 
issue we need cholesterol for many
physical<00:00:19.109> processes<00:00:19.619> so<00:00:19.980> for<00:00:20.189> example<00:00:20.250> all<00:00:20.789> of

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
physical processes so for example all of

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.000 
physical processes so for example all of
the<00:00:21.150> steroid<00:00:21.960> hormones<00:00:22.410> in<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:22.619> body<00:00:22.830> the

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
the steroid hormones in the body the

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.279 
the steroid hormones in the body the
base<00:00:23.519> for<00:00:23.939> making<00:00:24.300> all<00:00:24.449> the<00:00:24.600> steroid<00:00:24.930> hormones

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
base for making all the steroid hormones

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.429 
base for making all the steroid hormones
is<00:00:25.439> cholesterol<00:00:26.010> it's<00:00:26.310> in<00:00:26.910> our<00:00:27.060> cell<00:00:27.300> walls<00:00:27.570> we

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
is cholesterol it's in our cell walls we

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.030 
is cholesterol it's in our cell walls we
need<00:00:28.650> it<00:00:28.800> for<00:00:29.070> a<00:00:29.340> whole<00:00:29.730> variety<00:00:29.939> of<00:00:30.300> different

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:31.040 
need it for a whole variety of different

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.900 
need it for a whole variety of different
functions<00:00:32.040> in<00:00:32.189> the<00:00:32.219> body<00:00:32.309> so<00:00:32.669> it's<00:00:32.790> been

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
functions in the body so it's been

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.430

realize<00:01:22.350> is<00:01:22.830> eating<00:01:23.250> simple<00:01:23.700> carbohydrates

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
realize is eating simple carbohydrates

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.560 
realize is eating simple carbohydrates
is<00:01:24.740> that<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.979> body<00:01:26.189> if<00:01:26.460> it<00:01:26.640> has<00:01:26.880> more<00:01:27.150> simple

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
is that the body if it has more simple

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.600 
is that the body if it has more simple
carbohydrate<00:01:28.229> more<00:01:28.619> blood<00:01:28.890> sugar<00:01:29.189> than<00:01:29.460> it

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
carbohydrate more blood sugar than it

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.700 
carbohydrate more blood sugar than it
can<00:01:29.790> utilize<00:01:30.210> right<00:01:30.479> away<00:01:30.689> it's<00:01:30.930> converted

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
can utilize right away it's converted

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.429 
can utilize right away it's converted
into<00:01:31.860> cholesterol<00:01:32.460> and<00:01:32.520> triglycerides<00:01:33.150> so<00:01:34.079> we

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
into cholesterol and triglycerides so we

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.020 
into cholesterol and triglycerides so we
just<00:01:34.619> have<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:35.130> precursor<00:01:35.700> to<00:01:35.909> the

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
just have the precursor to the

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.590 
just have the precursor to the
cholesterol<00:01:36.570> so<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.770> a<00:01:38.369> lot<00:01:39.000> of<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.360> work

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
cholesterol so the a lot of the work

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.600 
cholesterol so the a lot of the work
i've<00:01:40.409> actually<00:01:40.799> had<00:01:41.009> patients<00:01:41.400> who<00:01:41.430> were

able to lower their cholesterol levels
statins<00:01:54.659> are<00:01:54.780> an<00:01:54.899> option<00:01:55.229> for<00:01:55.259> people<00:01:55.799> who

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
statins are an option for people who

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.270 
statins are an option for people who
refuse<00:01:56.729> they<00:01:57.000> just<00:01:57.210> won't<00:01:57.390> make<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.750> changes

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
refuse they just won't make the changes

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.429 
refuse they just won't make the changes
so<00:01:59.280> there<00:02:00.090> are<00:02:00.119> a<00:02:00.270> lot<00:02:00.509> of<00:02:00.540> options<00:02:01.140> available

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
so there are a lot of options available

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.539 
so there are a lot of options available
and<00:02:02.090> I'd<00:02:03.090> again<00:02:03.719> my<00:02:04.049> biases<00:02:04.680> if<00:02:04.920> people<00:02:05.460> are

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
and I'd again my biases if people are

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.730 
and I'd again my biases if people are
willing<00:02:05.579> to<00:02:06.060> make<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.509> lifestyle<00:02:07.320> changes

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
willing to make the lifestyle changes

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.369 
willing to make the lifestyle changes
they<00:02:08.160> often<00:02:08.340> can<00:02:08.729> bypass<00:02:09.149> the<00:02:09.660> statins<00:02:10.170> and

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
they often can bypass the statins and

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:10.559 
they often can bypass the statins and
the

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569 
the

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:18.680 
the
drugs

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690
