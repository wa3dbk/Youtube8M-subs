00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:40.850

if<00:01:39.780> they<00:01:39.930> were<00:01:39.990> employed<00:01:40.350> more<00:01:40.620> in<00:01:40.740> this

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
if they were employed more in this

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.690 
if they were employed more in this
country<00:01:41.720> thirdly<00:01:42.720> then<00:01:43.230> to<00:01:43.710> really<00:01:44.370> retain

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
country thirdly then to really retain

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.060 
country thirdly then to really retain
your<00:01:44.940> staff<00:01:45.300> there<00:01:45.930> are<00:01:46.110> very<00:01:46.380> simple<00:01:46.860> things

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
your staff there are very simple things

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.649 
your staff there are very simple things
that<00:01:47.280> you<00:01:47.430> need<00:01:47.580> to<00:01:47.730> do<00:01:47.909> and<00:01:48.240> I<00:01:48.300> think<00:01:48.510> it's

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
that you need to do and I think it's

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.710 
that you need to do and I think it's
about<00:01:48.780> being<00:01:49.200> open<00:01:49.530> honest<00:01:50.280> and<00:01:50.659> giving<00:01:51.659> them

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
about being open honest and giving them

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.410 
about being open honest and giving them
a<00:01:51.840> clear<00:01:52.050> career<00:01:52.380> path<00:01:52.740> and<00:01:53.100> with<00:01:54.000> regard<00:01:54.120> to

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
a clear career path and with regard to

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.380 
a clear career path and with regard to
paying<00:01:55.320> people<00:01:55.650> effectively<00:01:56.460> I<00:01:56.880> think<00:01:57.240> that

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
paying people effectively I think that

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.660 
paying people effectively I think that
you<00:01:57.540> need<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:57.810> pay<00:01:58.080> people<00:01:58.320> market<00:01:59.070> rate<00:01:59.310> and

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
you need to pay people market rate and

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.940 
you need to pay people market rate and
although<00:02:00.390> having<00:02:00.780> said<00:02:01.110> that<00:02:01.140> i<00:02:01.500> would<00:02:01.620> say

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
although having said that i would say

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.600 
although having said that i would say
that<00:02:02.280> market<00:02:03.060> rate<00:02:03.210> does<00:02:03.450> change<00:02:03.870> so<00:02:04.620> often<00:02:05.310> it

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
that market rate does change so often it

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.969 
that market rate does change so often it
goes<00:02:05.850> up<00:02:06.240> but<00:02:06.570> actually<00:02:06.990> quite<00:02:07.229> often<00:02:07.409> it<00:02:07.650> also

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
goes up but actually quite often it also

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.309 
goes up but actually quite often it also
goes<00:02:08.190> down<00:02:08.429> in<00:02:08.670> the<00:02:08.700> current<00:02:09.060> market<00:02:09.239> so<00:02:10.050> this

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
goes down in the current market so this

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.990 
goes down in the current market so this
is<00:02:10.470> really<00:02:10.649> the<00:02:10.830> time<00:02:11.039> to<00:02:11.069> get<00:02:11.400> good<00:02:11.580> salary

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
is really the time to get good salary

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.300 
is really the time to get good salary

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
partnership or from other businesses

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.620 
partnership or from other businesses
that<00:02:17.610> you<00:02:17.730> know

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:27.570 

I<00:02:24.150> think<00:02:25.150> that<00:02:25.360> good<00:02:25.660> hiring<00:02:26.460> starts<00:02:27.460> at

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:27.580 
I think that good hiring starts at

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.480 
I think that good hiring starts at
having<00:02:27.850> a<00:02:27.940> good<00:02:28.120> hiring<00:02:28.630> process<00:02:29.200> so<00:02:30.040> in<00:02:30.340> order

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
having a good hiring process so in order

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:32.820 
having a good hiring process so in order
to<00:02:30.670> evaluate<00:02:31.000> all<00:02:31.480> the<00:02:31.630> candidates<00:02:32.110> my<00:02:32.560> first

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:32.830 
to evaluate all the candidates my first

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.250 
to evaluate all the candidates my first
need<00:02:33.130> to<00:02:33.310> start<00:02:33.610> with<00:02:33.940> what<00:02:34.870> you're<00:02:35.020> really

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
need to start with what you're really

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.400 
need to start with what you're really
looking<00:02:35.500> for<00:02:35.950> in<00:02:36.190> the<00:02:36.760> person<00:02:37.300> and<00:02:37.540> I<00:02:38.140> think

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
looking for in the person and I think

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.140 
looking for in the person and I think
that<00:02:38.620> throughout<00:02:39.070> the<00:02:39.280> process<00:02:39.490> which

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
that throughout the process which

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.090 
that throughout the process which
normally<00:02:40.600> shouldn't<00:02:40.960> last<00:02:41.260> for<00:02:41.680> less<00:02:41.860> than

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:42.100 
normally shouldn't last for less than

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.940 
normally shouldn't last for less than
four<00:02:42.370> six<00:02:42.760> weeks<00:02:43.500> you<00:02:44.500> should<00:02:44.530> reevaluate

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
four six weeks you should reevaluate

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.250 
four six weeks you should reevaluate
what<00:02:45.490> it<00:02:45.850> is<00:02:46.000> that<00:02:46.240> you're<00:02:46.300> looking<00:02:46.510> for<00:02:46.720> and

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
what it is that you're looking for and

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.350 
what it is that you're looking for and
reanalyzed<00:02:47.950> the<00:02:48.160> candidates<00:02:48.610> based<00:02:48.820> on<00:02:49.180> your

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
reanalyzed the candidates based on your

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.780 
reanalyzed the candidates based on your
needs<00:02:49.680> often<00:02:50.680> a<00:02:50.740> lot<00:02:50.920> of<00:02:51.040> the<00:02:51.130> work<00:02:51.310> that<00:02:51.550> we<00:02:51.640> do

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
needs often a lot of the work that we do

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.370 
needs often a lot of the work that we do
with<00:02:51.970> companies<00:02:52.420> is<00:02:52.630> to<00:02:52.780> really<00:02:53.020> pin<00:02:53.350> down

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
with companies is to really pin down

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.830 
with companies is to really pin down
what<00:02:54.070> the<00:02:54.220> organizational<00:02:55.030> needs<00:02:55.210> are<00:02:55.570> at<00:02:55.750> the

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
what the organizational needs are at the

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:58.830 
what the organizational needs are at the

change in the course of the process I
would<00:03:01.690> also<00:03:01.780> suggest<00:03:02.080> that<00:03:02.440> for<00:03:02.590> more<00:03:02.710> senior

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.100 
would also suggest that for more senior

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.950 
would also suggest that for more senior
hires<00:03:03.310> there<00:03:03.700> are<00:03:03.850> at<00:03:04.060> least<00:03:04.090> three

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:04.960 
hires there are at least three

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.090 
hires there are at least three
interviews<00:03:05.740> stages<00:03:06.550> and<00:03:07.590> certainly<00:03:08.590> to<00:03:08.920> have

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
interviews stages and certainly to have

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.070 
interviews stages and certainly to have
the<00:03:09.250> most<00:03:09.370> relevant<00:03:10.000> individuals<00:03:10.690> involved

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
the most relevant individuals involved

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.070 
the most relevant individuals involved
at<00:03:11.590> the<00:03:11.740> right<00:03:11.920> times<00:03:12.250> I<00:03:12.700> would<00:03:13.540> suggest<00:03:13.720> that

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
at the right times I would suggest that

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.040 
at the right times I would suggest that
the<00:03:14.560> most<00:03:15.100> important<00:03:15.760> aspect<00:03:15.880> however<00:03:16.630> of

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:17.050 
the most important aspect however of

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:19.440 
the most important aspect however of
really<00:03:17.800> feeling<00:03:18.190> if<00:03:18.310> the<00:03:18.430> right<00:03:18.610> person<00:03:19.210> is

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:19.450 
really feeling if the right person is

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:22.110 
really feeling if the right person is
joining<00:03:19.750> your<00:03:20.020> company<00:03:20.470> is<00:03:20.650> still<00:03:21.340> about<00:03:21.820> gut

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
joining your company is still about gut

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.910 
joining your company is still about gut
instinct<00:03:22.750> I<00:03:22.870> don't<00:03:23.080> think<00:03:23.260> there's<00:03:23.410> any<00:03:23.560> test

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
instinct I don't think there's any test

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.640 
instinct I don't think there's any test
out<00:03:24.280> there<00:03:24.550> which<00:03:25.210> will<00:03:25.450> tell<00:03:25.720> you<00:03:25.870> more<00:03:26.140> than

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:26.650 
out there which will tell you more than

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.770 
out there which will tell you more than
your<00:03:26.860> own<00:03:27.070> gut<00:03:27.370> instinct<00:03:27.880> will<00:03:28.060> and<00:03:28.360> normally

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
your own gut instinct will and normally

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:37.420 
your own gut instinct will and normally
that<00:03:28.870> of<00:03:29.200> your<00:03:29.350> management<00:03:29.920> team<00:03:30.130> as<00:03:30.610> well

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.360 

in<00:03:38.180> 2014<00:03:38.959> I<00:03:39.230> think<00:03:39.530> that<00:03:39.650> will<00:03:39.769> start<00:03:40.040> see<00:03:40.340> a

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.370 
in 2014 I think that will start see a

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.059 
in 2014 I think that will start see a
bit<00:03:40.579> more<00:03:40.609> of<00:03:40.790> a<00:03:40.969> return<00:03:41.299> to<00:03:41.780> some<00:03:42.560> sense<00:03:42.859> of

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:43.069 
bit more of a return to some sense of

00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:46.539 
bit more of a return to some sense of
normality<00:03:43.430> in<00:03:44.030> hiring<00:03:44.480> trends<00:03:45.079> I<00:03:45.530> think<00:03:46.459> that

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:46.549 
normality in hiring trends I think that

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:49.959 
normality in hiring trends I think that
with<00:03:46.939> regard<00:03:47.120> to<00:03:47.590> recent<00:03:48.939> redundancies<00:03:49.939> that

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:49.969 
with regard to recent redundancies that

00:03:49.969 --> 00:03:52.089 
with regard to recent redundancies that
taken<00:03:50.540> place<00:03:50.719> over<00:03:50.989> the<00:03:51.170> last<00:03:51.230> few<00:03:51.650> years<00:03:51.739> I

00:03:52.089 --> 00:03:52.099 
taken place over the last few years I

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:53.440 
taken place over the last few years I
think<00:03:52.280> that's<00:03:52.400> probably<00:03:52.609> coming<00:03:53.120> to<00:03:53.239> an<00:03:53.329> end

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:53.450 
think that's probably coming to an end

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.429 
think that's probably coming to an end
now<00:03:54.129> hopefully<00:03:55.129> at<00:03:55.400> least<00:03:55.489> and<00:03:56.090> I<00:03:56.599> think<00:03:57.319> we're

00:03:57.429 --> 00:03:57.439 
now hopefully at least and I think we're

00:03:57.439 --> 00:03:59.530 
now hopefully at least and I think we're
starting<00:03:57.889> to<00:03:58.010> see<00:03:58.040> more<00:03:58.670> companies<00:03:59.299> now

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
starting to see more companies now

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.390 
starting to see more companies now
investing<00:04:00.200> in<00:04:00.319> new<00:04:00.469> positions<00:04:01.010> which<00:04:01.250> is<00:04:01.370> a

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
investing in new positions which is a

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.459 
investing in new positions which is a
very<00:04:01.609> positive<00:04:01.909> sign<00:04:02.389> for<00:04:02.450> the<00:04:02.719> industry<00:04:03.260> I

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:03.469 
very positive sign for the industry I

00:04:03.469 --> 00:04:06.280 
very positive sign for the industry I
would<00:04:03.980> also<00:04:04.280> say<00:04:04.760> that<00:04:04.790> the<00:04:05.269> largest<00:04:05.870> growth

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
would also say that the largest growth

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.190 
would also say that the largest growth
area<00:04:06.739> we've<00:04:06.920> seen<00:04:07.189> will<00:04:07.870> continue<00:04:08.870> and<00:04:09.079> that's

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
area we've seen will continue and that's

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.159 
area we've seen will continue and that's
within<00:04:09.409> risk<00:04:10.010> and<00:04:10.280> compliance<00:04:10.400> I<00:04:11.150> think<00:04:12.019> that

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:12.169 
within risk and compliance I think that

00:04:12.169 --> 00:04:14.530 
within risk and compliance I think that
that's<00:04:12.319> predominantly<00:04:13.099> because<00:04:14.090> of<00:04:14.419> the

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:14.540 
that's predominantly because of the

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.689 
that's predominantly because of the
AIFMD<00:04:15.379> but<00:04:15.769> it's<00:04:15.889> also<00:04:16.070> because<00:04:16.430> of<00:04:16.549> other

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:16.699 
AIFMD but it's also because of other

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:19.659 
AIFMD but it's also because of other
related<00:04:17.030> directors<00:04:17.780> and<00:04:18.079> i<00:04:18.680> would<00:04:18.859> say<00:04:19.160> that

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:19.669 
related directors and i would say that

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:22.600 
related directors and i would say that
because<00:04:20.539> of<00:04:20.900> these<00:04:21.019> increases<00:04:21.709> in<00:04:22.039> compliance

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:22.610 
because of these increases in compliance

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.900 
because of these increases in compliance
and<00:04:22.970> risk<00:04:23.150> and<00:04:23.570> the<00:04:24.639> requirements<00:04:25.639> for<00:04:25.669> those

and risk and the requirements for those

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:28.570 
and risk and the requirements for those
skills<00:04:26.389> the<00:04:27.080> other<00:04:27.289> aspects<00:04:27.979> of<00:04:28.130> the<00:04:28.370> fund
