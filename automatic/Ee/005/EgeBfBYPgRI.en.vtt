00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.060
 is 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.670
 look at this spiritual monkey leaving 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:19.900
 those millions 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:26.170
 Micao is a pet is that the canine Micao 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:29.230
 canine not feline also looks only the dvd 

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:31.509
 I always do this because the 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.760
 my assurance that people will not 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:39.100
 They'll get me wrong. 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:41.620
 How good is animals with me, right? 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.739
 I have six kittens and have one 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:47.440
 doggy 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:50.980
 outside have several animals because a 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:57.280
 car on the map now or even tried to pass it 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:59.620
 porcupine monkey once while you have 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:02.050
 a snake who gets everything right 

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.660
 and then I think I learned to live well 

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:07.300
 with this, do not 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:11.140
 the insect also in these things there 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:13.900
 well then this is for nobody to say look 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:17.110
 you discriminate animals can take away 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.010
 your mind because it does not work if 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:22.050
 No, right? 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:22.050
 What I've been doing is true. 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.660
 together with all staff 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.880
 of the century 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:30.700
 we take better care of the 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.650
 animals is the one who does not care will have 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.480
 we learn to care because we have to 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:38.170
 learn to relate to everything that 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:40.420
 There is in the best shape but 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:45.150
 our lack of knowledge often 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:51.310
 leads us to pay the monkeys who are 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:53.110
 fantastic and a lot of things happened 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.000
 in my life right? 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.890
 I can not say I've always been 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.820
 No one is perfect, I 'm not myself. 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:02.470
 I already did things that I myself review 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:04.150
 disapprove with certain and I think that everybody 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:10.830
 have to do this 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:14.830
 but one fine day I was walking local 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:17.320
 place on the beach and when I look and 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:21.460
 boardwalk welcome 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:26.080
 a lady with a little dog a little dog 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:28.750
 I was on this, you're not going to me. 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.370
 take it bad because I'm talking 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.870
 then I will complete what he's talking 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.420
 and so 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:37.300
 the little dog came with shoes with a 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:41.380
 dress came with a little hat and with 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:44.890
 sunglasses walking on the beach 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:47.770
 his owner who was also dressed 

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:51.370
 more or less like a dark sunglasses or 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:52.150
 clothing for the environment of 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.330
 Beach 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.890
 When I saw that, I did not say our 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:01.810
 funny that right because the code 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:03.820
 shoe and it makes funny saying that it is 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:07.180
 right and wrong a dog to wear shoes 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:10.810
 Kisses do not get boring of my 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:13.780
 side at the moment, but look what 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.920
 It happens that this is a big monkey. 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.890
 spiritual 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:22.330
 besides being an emotional level is because 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:24.670
 you organize an animal is it flake nÃ© 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:27.670
 if you are taking care of the animal of a 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:29.459
 such that you take away all defenses 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.750
 his 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:33.430
 it ceases to be an animal 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.370
 We're looking for him to become a 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.830
 be human and I must tell you that 

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:40.350
 we humans will improve a lot to 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:43.269
 to want someone to be the same as us 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:44.820
 Let's improve working more with everyone. 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:49.440
 the resources that we have 

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:52.450
 but the great monkey of all is that 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:55.510
 any animal you have, right? 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:58.480
 if you catch a dog get a cat right? 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:01.120
 they have their own lifeline 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.950
 has a course of evolution of them then 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:06.160
 they have to do this course because 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:07.959
 edit this way and we can not 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:13.500
 want to change it because we're not 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:16.060
 neither god nor anything is true then 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:19.870
 attempt to humanize 11 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:23.050
 evil is a great spiritual monk and there 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:27.250
 you forgive me if you think I'm 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:29.380
 being castrator of human affection does not 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:32.070
 I'm wanting the animals to go a lot. 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:34.780
 well alone who are treated well are 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:37.600
 respected and that we can have a 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:40.600
 coexistence between the different 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:43.139
 This is a spiritual micony of my 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.139
 Portuguese 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:47.440
 Now that time is every time I 

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:51.100
 I'll do something, I'll drive a car. 

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:52.930
 passes a plane that would disk space 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:54.490
 flying too right 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:56.639
 but if I pass a flying saucer I'll go 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:59.050
 to film for you to see 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:01.180
 I have to now is passing a 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:06.930
 helicopter but left end what 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:09.280
 I was talking about our site or 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:12.220

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:14.110

 You to relate to us 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.810
 I think there's something that is 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:18.910
 on this planet that the 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.960
 relationship if we learn to 

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:24.370
 list 

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:30.760
