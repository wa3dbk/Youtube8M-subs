those to the expedition would not have

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:28.040 
those to the expedition would not have
succeeded<00:06:26.330> but<00:06:27.330> somehow<00:06:27.540> I<00:06:27.660> feel<00:06:27.870> the

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:28.050 
succeeded but somehow I feel the

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:29.930 
succeeded but somehow I feel the
Charlie's<00:06:28.470> been<00:06:28.710> shortchanged<00:06:29.460> a<00:06:29.550> bit<00:06:29.700> over

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:29.940 
Charlie's been shortchanged a bit over

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:30.590 
Charlie's been shortchanged a bit over
the<00:06:30.030> years

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:30.600 
the years

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:32.390 
the years
didn't<00:06:31.260> quite<00:06:31.350> get<00:06:31.650> the<00:06:31.800> recognition<00:06:32.070> he

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:32.400 
didn't quite get the recognition he

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.480 
didn't quite get the recognition he
deserves<00:06:33.020> well<00:06:34.020> maybe<00:06:34.950> there's<00:06:35.250> something<00:06:35.280> we

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:35.490 
deserves well maybe there's something we

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:38.540 
deserves well maybe there's something we
can<00:06:35.670> really<00:06:35.880> do<00:06:36.120> about<00:06:36.240> that
