how to approach this is an example of
something<00:00:30.750> you<00:00:30.900> don't<00:00:31.230> want<00:00:31.529> to<00:00:31.590> attack<00:00:31.830> there

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
the collector but if you look at this

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.470 
the collector but if you look at this
storage<00:00:37.410> it's<00:00:37.680> really<00:00:38.280> filled<00:00:38.520> up<00:00:38.670> and<00:00:38.910> if<00:00:39.390> you
