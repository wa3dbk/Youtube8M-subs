00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.320
 Well, let's start 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:17.370
 removing the cuticle and me in my case 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.690
 good is already 

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:20.690
 and it's already retired 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.640
 but anyway we're going a little bit 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.640
 a little more 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:33.710
 with a fine- grained file we're going to 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.710
 encourage a little but very little 

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:41.610
 only good 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.610
 so that the adhesive takes well 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.320
 we will cast a condition with a 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:52.059
 Nail conditioner for 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.059
 degrease the nail do 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.190
 as our type 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:05.239
 we have to 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.239
 of the measure that we need 

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.560
 and more 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.070
 4 to you 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:27.390
 and now with a cutter like this 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.000
 and now we are going to reinforce the union of 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.640
 tip with our nail to remove this 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.570
 little step from here we are going to do it with 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.570
 porcelain 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:07.160
 things 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:07.160
 ace 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.869
 Now let's take the lathe 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:36.340
 and we change the head 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.340
 we put everything finer with more 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.590
 This is an agent of use 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.440
 try to touch the cuticle on 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.440
 gel 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:16.000
 because then when we put it to the 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:16.000
 lamp 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.519
 is going to burn you and we are 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.409
 m 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.150
 ah 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.690
 and me 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:39.719
 do not 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.840
 let's do is put your hand in the 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.840
 lamp v 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.750
 we have to see here the light and for 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:04:00.560
 in 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:04.490
 we will be more or less 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:06.410
 from 1 to 2 minutes 

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:09.960
 and meanwhile with the other hand what 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:14.330
 we can do is pick up a cotton quoted 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:14.330
 a cotton disk like this 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:20.500
 and soak it 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.500
 in alcohol 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:28.590
 with the 

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:31.600
 and now what we do is with the disk 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:35.730
 soaked in alcohol 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.730
 we drag towards the tips 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:44.780
 to remove the excess gel 

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:55.919
 and they would be ready to paint good 

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:57.869
 I hope it has been good for you 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:59.889
 this is the way I do 

00:04:57.869 --> 00:05:04.840
 the ones 

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:07.689
 6 and good is not the best way is not the 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:10.479
 Neither perfect nor the most professional way 

00:05:07.689 --> 00:05:13.680
 But I'm worth it and I hope that you 

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:13.680
 also chao 

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:20.260
 here 

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:25.640
 I like it
