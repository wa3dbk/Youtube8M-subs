your<00:02:46.630> spawners<00:02:46.989> all<00:02:47.410> around<00:02:47.770> the<00:02:47.920> world<00:02:48.070> so

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
your spawners all around the world so

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:49.710 
your spawners all around the world so
that's<00:02:48.700> what<00:02:48.850> he's<00:02:48.940> talking<00:02:49.239> about<00:02:49.300> basically

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
that's what he's talking about basically

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.750 
that's what he's talking about basically
and<00:02:50.080> unfortunately<00:02:50.709> guys<00:02:50.980> at<00:02:51.220> the<00:02:51.370> moment<00:02:51.670> we

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
and unfortunately guys at the moment we

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.550 
and unfortunately guys at the moment we
can't<00:02:52.030> really<00:02:52.180> have<00:02:52.510> that<00:02:52.690> because<00:02:52.930> again

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
can't really have that because again

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.860 
can't really have that because again
like<00:02:53.770> I<00:02:53.950> mentioned<00:02:53.980> our<00:02:54.610> hardware<00:02:55.120> is<00:02:55.270> not<00:02:55.330> up

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
like I mentioned our hardware is not up

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.110 
like I mentioned our hardware is not up
to<00:02:56.050> par<00:02:56.080> with<00:02:56.530> the<00:02:56.739> PC<00:02:57.160> Edition<00:02:57.370> for<00:02:57.700> minecraft

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.790 
to par with the PC Edition for minecraft
so<00:02:58.390> maybe<00:02:58.600> in<00:02:58.810> the<00:02:58.930> future<00:02:59.080> let<00:02:59.350> me<00:02:59.440> get<00:02:59.590> maybe

00:02:59.790 --> 00:02:59.800 
so maybe in the future let me get maybe

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.040 
so maybe in the future let me get maybe
new<00:03:00.010> consoles<00:03:00.550> maybe<00:03:01.000> we<00:03:01.180> can<00:03:01.330> have<00:03:01.540> that<00:03:01.570> so

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.050 
new consoles maybe we can have that so

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:03.360
