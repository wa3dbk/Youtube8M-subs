considered that to be the best subwoofer
on<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:58.649> market<00:00:59.039> then<00:00:59.579> you'll<00:00:59.730> notice<00:01:00.059> that

00:01:00.459 --> 00:01:00.469 
on the market then you'll notice that

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:03.650 
on the market then you'll notice that
the<00:01:01.469> amplifiers<00:01:02.039> actually<00:01:02.609> motorized<00:01:03.090> in<00:01:03.390> so

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
the amplifiers actually motorized in so

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.960 
the amplifiers actually motorized in so
that<00:01:03.809> it<00:01:03.930> closes<00:01:04.170> that<00:01:04.589> window<00:01:05.010> so<00:01:05.700> then<00:01:05.850> at

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
that it closes that window so then at

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.250 
that it closes that window so then at
that<00:01:06.090> point<00:01:06.150> you<00:01:06.450> can<00:01:06.630> see<00:01:06.810> all<00:01:06.960> three

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
that point you can see all three

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.740 
that point you can see all three
amplifiers<00:01:07.860> then<00:01:08.700> we<00:01:08.790> have<00:01:08.880> panels<00:01:09.390> that<00:01:09.600> can

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
amplifiers then we have panels that can

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.740 
amplifiers then we have panels that can
go<00:01:09.960> on<00:01:09.990> all<00:01:10.560> of<00:01:10.860> these<00:01:11.010> pieces<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:12.119> cover<00:01:12.420> it<00:01:12.630> up

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
go on all of these pieces to cover it up

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.330 
go on all of these pieces to cover it up
so<00:01:12.960> that<00:01:13.020> you<00:01:13.229> can<00:01:13.350> still<00:01:13.590> store<00:01:13.920> stuff<00:01:14.159> in

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
so that you can still store stuff in

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.010 
so that you can still store stuff in
there<00:01:14.549> so<00:01:15.150> what<00:01:15.299> you've<00:01:15.450> got<00:01:15.479> is<00:01:15.869> there's

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
there so what you've got is there's

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.690 
there so what you've got is there's
three<00:01:16.259> amplifiers<00:01:16.799> you've<00:01:17.040> got<00:01:17.220> one<00:01:17.400> run<00:01:17.580> of

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
three amplifiers you've got one run of

speaker<00:01:56.070> so<00:01:56.520> we<00:01:56.640> made<00:01:56.820> a<00:01:56.850> custom<00:01:57.119> center

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
speaker so we made a custom center

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.719 
speaker so we made a custom center
channel<00:01:57.780> this<00:01:58.020> is<00:01:58.170> all<00:01:58.350> one<00:01:58.560> piece<00:01:58.860> that's<00:01:59.520> now

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
channel this is all one piece that's now

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.389 
channel this is all one piece that's now
got<00:01:59.970> a<00:02:00.000> mid-range<00:02:00.390> in<00:02:00.570> a<00:02:00.630> tweeter<00:02:00.930> and<00:02:01.259> we<00:02:02.190> even

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
got a mid-range in a tweeter and we even

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.399 
got a mid-range in a tweeter and we even
were<00:02:02.790> able<00:02:02.850> to<00:02:03.149> get<00:02:03.299> the<00:02:03.420> factory<00:02:03.869> woodgrain

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
were able to get the factory woodgrain

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:05.930 
were able to get the factory woodgrain
to<00:02:04.680> match<00:02:04.860> the<00:02:05.100> rest<00:02:05.250> of<00:02:05.369> the<00:02:05.430> wood<00:02:05.580> grain<00:02:05.759> in

LED<00:02:31.500> in<00:02:31.620> the<00:02:31.709> instrument<00:02:32.100> cluster<00:02:32.130> that's<00:02:32.910> the

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
LED in the instrument cluster that's the

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.970 
LED in the instrument cluster that's the
only<00:02:33.269> thing<00:02:33.450> that<00:02:33.630> you<00:02:33.780> see<00:02:34.019> we<00:02:34.500> actually<00:02:34.800> took

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
only thing that you see we actually took

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.259 
only thing that you see we actually took
the<00:02:35.130> instrument<00:02:35.459> cluster<00:02:35.519> out<00:02:35.880> of<00:02:36.000> the<00:02:36.060> card

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
the instrument cluster out of the card

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:38.000 
the instrument cluster out of the card
this<00:02:36.390> is<00:02:36.450> someone<00:02:36.840> to<00:02:36.900> put<00:02:37.050> the<00:02:37.140> LED<00:02:37.560> in<00:02:37.739> there

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
this is someone to put the LED in there

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.640 
this is someone to put the LED in there
and<00:02:38.220> then<00:02:38.790> now<00:02:38.970> what<00:02:39.120> you've<00:02:39.300> got<00:02:39.540> is<00:02:39.989> all<00:02:40.380> of

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
and then now what you've got is all of

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.250 
and then now what you've got is all of
your<00:02:40.769> all<00:02:41.069> of<00:02:41.100> your<00:02:41.340> radar<00:02:42.030> and<00:02:42.450> laser<00:02:42.750> and

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:43.260 
your all of your radar and laser and

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:46.130 
your all of your radar and laser and
it's<00:02:43.950> completely<00:02:44.220> undetectable<00:02:45.030> so<00:02:46.019> it's

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
it's completely undetectable so it's

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.750 
it's completely undetectable so it's
completely<00:02:46.290> stealth<00:02:46.920> integrated<00:02:47.459> into<00:02:47.640> the

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
completely stealth integrated into the

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.809 
completely stealth integrated into the
car<00:02:47.970> so<00:02:48.780> future<00:02:49.560> plans<00:02:49.830> for<00:02:50.100> this<00:02:50.190> car<00:02:50.459> would

00:02:50.809 --> 00:02:50.819 
car so future plans for this car would

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:53.690 
car so future plans for this car would
be<00:02:51.140> we<00:02:52.140> want<00:02:52.350> to<00:02:52.410> integrate<00:02:52.650> a<00:02:52.890> car<00:02:53.190> computer

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
be we want to integrate a car computer

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.850 
be we want to integrate a car computer
into<00:02:54.060> the<00:02:54.180> car<00:02:54.390> feeding<00:02:55.200> into<00:02:55.440> the<00:02:55.530> factory

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
into the car feeding into the factory

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:58.100 
into the car feeding into the factory
screen<00:02:56.209> so<00:02:57.209> can<00:02:57.360> you<00:02:57.390> tell<00:02:57.630> us<00:02:57.660> a<00:02:57.810> little<00:02:57.840> bit

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
screen so can you tell us a little bit

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.479 
screen so can you tell us a little bit
about<00:02:58.470> some<00:02:58.650> of<00:02:58.769> the<00:02:58.829> challenges<00:02:58.980> you<00:02:59.370> had

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
about some of the challenges you had

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.039 
about some of the challenges you had
with<00:02:59.640> most<00:02:59.880> busts<00:03:00.209> in<00:03:00.299> this<00:03:00.420> car<00:03:00.600> there's<00:03:00.959> a

00:03:01.039 --> 00:03:01.049 
with most busts in this car there's a

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:02.660 
with most busts in this car there's a
lot<00:03:01.079> of<00:03:01.260> challenges<00:03:01.530> in<00:03:01.890> this<00:03:02.040> car<00:03:02.250> if<00:03:02.489> you

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
lot of challenges in this car if you

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.199 
lot of challenges in this car if you
take<00:03:02.940> any<00:03:03.209> of<00:03:03.690> the<00:03:04.170> most<00:03:04.859> bus<00:03:05.220> pieces<00:03:05.760> out<00:03:05.970> of

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:06.209 
take any of the most bus pieces out of

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:08.360 
take any of the most bus pieces out of
the<00:03:06.329> car<00:03:06.600> you'll<00:03:07.590> end<00:03:07.769> up<00:03:07.859> killing<00:03:08.250> the

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
the car you'll end up killing the

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.050 
the car you'll end up killing the
battery<00:03:08.549> so<00:03:09.120> for<00:03:09.870> instance<00:03:10.549> this<00:03:11.549> car<00:03:11.850> was

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
battery so for instance this car was

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.150 
battery so for instance this car was
designed<00:03:12.239> from<00:03:12.810> the<00:03:12.959> factory<00:03:13.410> with<00:03:13.560> a<00:03:13.620> changer

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
designed from the factory with a changer

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.920 
designed from the factory with a changer
right<00:03:14.190> here<00:03:14.700> and<00:03:14.880> you'll<00:03:15.209> notice<00:03:15.480> i'm<00:03:15.810> going

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
right here and you'll notice i'm going

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.319 
right here and you'll notice i'm going
to<00:03:15.989> motorized<00:03:16.380> this<00:03:16.650> open<00:03:17.100> you'll<00:03:17.910> notice

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
to motorized this open you'll notice

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:20.509 
to motorized this open you'll notice
that<00:03:18.359> there's<00:03:19.170> no<00:03:19.380> longer<00:03:19.620> a<00:03:19.769> changer<00:03:20.310> there

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
that there's no longer a changer there

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:24.229 
that there's no longer a changer there
now<00:03:21.180> that<00:03:21.540> is<00:03:21.780> a<00:03:22.220> controller<00:03:23.220> for<00:03:23.579> my

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
now that is a controller for my

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:27.140 
now that is a controller for my
equalizer<00:03:25.019> that's<00:03:25.410> in<00:03:25.530> the<00:03:25.620> trunk<00:03:25.970> well<00:03:26.970> the

changer is still in this vehicle it's

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.470 
changer is still in this vehicle it's
actually<00:03:29.370> just<00:03:29.519> hidden<00:03:29.730> behind<00:03:29.940> the<00:03:30.239> dash

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
actually just hidden behind the dash

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.960 
actually just hidden behind the dash
still<00:03:31.290> connected<00:03:31.769> into<00:03:31.980> the<00:03:32.070> loop<00:03:32.250> if<00:03:32.489> we

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
still connected into the loop if we

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.210 
still connected into the loop if we
would<00:03:33.120> have<00:03:33.180> taken<00:03:33.450> it<00:03:33.690> out<00:03:33.780> of<00:03:33.840> the<00:03:34.019> loop<00:03:34.320> we

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
would have taken it out of the loop we

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:36.410 
would have taken it out of the loop we
would<00:03:35.370> eventually<00:03:35.579> killed<00:03:36.090> the<00:03:36.209> battery

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
would eventually killed the battery

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:38.390 
would eventually killed the battery
because<00:03:36.900> when<00:03:37.290> you<00:03:37.380> turn<00:03:37.530> the<00:03:37.560> car<00:03:37.890> on<00:03:37.920> the

because when you turn the car on the
mercedes<00:03:39.209> would<00:03:39.420> have<00:03:39.510> been<00:03:39.660> looking<00:03:40.019> for

00:03:40.039 --> 00:03:40.049 
mercedes would have been looking for

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:42.080 
mercedes would have been looking for
that<00:03:40.230> changer<00:03:40.829> and<00:03:41.010> just<00:03:41.040> continues<00:03:41.820> to<00:03:41.850> look

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
that changer and just continues to look

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.360 
that changer and just continues to look
for<00:03:42.390> it<00:03:42.600> like<00:03:42.780> as<00:03:42.930> a<00:03:42.959> lost<00:03:43.230> child<00:03:43.560> so<00:03:44.190> that's

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
for it like as a lost child so that's

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.160 
for it like as a lost child so that's
one<00:03:44.579> of<00:03:44.609> the<00:03:44.760> things<00:03:44.790> is<00:03:45.239> you<00:03:45.510> have<00:03:45.870> to<00:03:46.019> leave

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
one of the things is you have to leave

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:47.960 
one of the things is you have to leave
the<00:03:46.290> radio<00:03:46.590> in<00:03:46.769> the<00:03:46.859> car<00:03:46.890> the<00:03:47.609> factory

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
the radio in the car the factory

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.270 
the radio in the car the factory
amplifier<00:03:48.390> has<00:03:48.600> to<00:03:48.810> stay<00:03:49.019> in<00:03:49.170> the<00:03:49.290> car<00:03:49.500> the

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
amplifier has to stay in the car the

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.949 
amplifier has to stay in the car the
factory<00:03:50.579> changer<00:03:51.000> has<00:03:51.150> to<00:03:51.299> stay<00:03:51.480> in<00:03:51.660> the<00:03:51.750> car

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
factory changer has to stay in the car

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:54.380 
factory changer has to stay in the car
so<00:03:52.470> when<00:03:52.590> you<00:03:52.680> add<00:03:52.859> pieces<00:03:53.310> there<00:03:54.000> they're

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
so when you add pieces there they're

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.469 
so when you add pieces there they're
built<00:03:54.750> into<00:03:55.140> a<00:03:55.170> loop<00:03:55.500> so<00:03:56.010> you<00:03:56.910> actually<00:03:57.120> have<00:03:57.359> a

00:03:57.469 --> 00:03:57.479 
built into a loop so you actually have a

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:59.449 
built into a loop so you actually have a
fiber<00:03:57.810> optic<00:03:57.959> input<00:03:58.380> and<00:03:58.680> output<00:03:59.010> and<00:03:59.190> that's

00:03:59.449 --> 00:03:59.459 
fiber optic input and output and that's

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:01.099 
fiber optic input and output and that's
how<00:03:59.579> the<00:03:59.639> Bluetooth<00:04:00.030> module<00:04:00.209> goes<00:04:00.630> that's<00:04:01.019> how

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:01.109 
how the Bluetooth module goes that's how

00:04:01.109 --> 00:04:02.840 
how the Bluetooth module goes that's how
the<00:04:01.169> ipod<00:04:01.590> module<00:04:02.040> goes<00:04:02.160> and<00:04:02.400> so<00:04:02.549> on

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
the ipod module goes and so on

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.930 
the ipod module goes and so on
now<00:04:03.480> there's<00:04:04.140> a<00:04:04.200> company<00:04:04.620> getting<00:04:05.430> ready<00:04:05.670> to

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
now there's a company getting ready to

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.800 
now there's a company getting ready to
release<00:04:06.120> a<00:04:06.750> preamp<00:04:07.970> that<00:04:08.970> will<00:04:09.180> allow<00:04:09.510> us<00:04:09.540> to

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:09.810 
release a preamp that will allow us to

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.680 
release a preamp that will allow us to
take<00:04:10.470> the<00:04:10.830> factory<00:04:11.640> amplifier<00:04:12.090> in<00:04:12.300> this<00:04:12.480> car

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
take the factory amplifier in this car

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:16.610 
take the factory amplifier in this car
out<00:04:12.900> and<00:04:13.550> so<00:04:14.550> now<00:04:14.790> all<00:04:15.240> of<00:04:15.810> the<00:04:15.900> equalization

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
out and so now all of the equalization

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:18.080 
out and so now all of the equalization
that<00:04:16.770> was<00:04:16.860> built<00:04:17.130> into<00:04:17.430> the<00:04:17.520> original<00:04:17.850> stereo

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
that was built into the original stereo

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.660 
that was built into the original stereo
system<00:04:18.510> will<00:04:18.630> be<00:04:18.720> gone<00:04:18.959> and<00:04:19.350> now<00:04:19.770> I<00:04:19.800> can<00:04:20.370> go<00:04:20.489> in

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:20.670 
system will be gone and now I can go in

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:22.820 
system will be gone and now I can go in
and<00:04:20.820> customize<00:04:21.000> that<00:04:21.660> and<00:04:21.930> it's<00:04:22.290> actually<00:04:22.500> got

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
and customize that and it's actually got

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.100 
and customize that and it's actually got
a<00:04:22.860> fiber<00:04:23.220> optic<00:04:23.400> input<00:04:23.850> and<00:04:24.330> it's<00:04:24.720> either<00:04:24.900> got

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
a fiber optic input and it's either got

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:26.480 
a fiber optic input and it's either got
an<00:04:25.230> analog<00:04:25.590> output<00:04:25.980> to<00:04:26.070> go<00:04:26.160> to<00:04:26.250> a<00:04:26.310> normal

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
an analog output to go to a normal

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:28.640 
an analog output to go to a normal
amplifier<00:04:27.090> or<00:04:27.570> they've<00:04:27.870> got<00:04:27.900> one<00:04:28.350> that's

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
amplifier or they've got one that's

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.800 
amplifier or they've got one that's
going<00:04:28.830> to<00:04:28.920> have<00:04:29.100> a<00:04:29.130> fiber<00:04:29.490> optic<00:04:29.640> output<00:04:30.450> it's

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:30.810 
going to have a fiber optic output it's

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:31.970 
going to have a fiber optic output it's
going<00:04:30.990> to<00:04:31.050> be<00:04:31.110> the<00:04:31.200> feed<00:04:31.410> into<00:04:31.650> an<00:04:31.740> amplifier

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:31.980 
going to be the feed into an amplifier

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.950 
going to be the feed into an amplifier
that<00:04:32.370> has<00:04:32.490> a<00:04:32.520> fiber<00:04:32.790> optic<00:04:32.940> input<00:04:33.300> so<00:04:33.840> what

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:33.960 
that has a fiber optic input so what

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.420 
that has a fiber optic input so what
other<00:04:34.050> challenges<00:04:34.320> have<00:04:34.710> you<00:04:34.770> had<00:04:34.920> this<00:04:35.190> car

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.430 
other challenges have you had this car

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.720 
other challenges have you had this car
they<00:04:35.580> were<00:04:35.640> it<00:04:36.060> took<00:04:36.270> a<00:04:36.360> while<00:04:36.480> oh<00:04:37.400> these<00:04:38.400> cars

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:38.730 
they were it took a while oh these cars

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:41.480 
they were it took a while oh these cars
love<00:04:39.090> to<00:04:39.870> go<00:04:40.050> into<00:04:40.260> what's<00:04:40.470> called<00:04:40.560> a<00:04:40.860> battery

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
love to go into what's called a battery

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:43.190 
love to go into what's called a battery
voltage<00:04:41.670> protection<00:04:42.300> everything<00:04:42.960> on<00:04:43.080> this

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:43.200 
voltage protection everything on this

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:45.980 
voltage protection everything on this
car<00:04:43.260> runs<00:04:44.250> off<00:04:44.460> of<00:04:44.490> electricity<00:04:45.090> and<00:04:45.510> so<00:04:45.930> you

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990 
car runs off of electricity and so you

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:48.260 
car runs off of electricity and so you
put<00:04:46.260> amplifiers<00:04:46.800> in<00:04:46.950> the<00:04:47.160> car<00:04:47.370> and<00:04:47.760> you<00:04:48.030> start

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
put amplifiers in the car and you start

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.030 
put amplifiers in the car and you start
to<00:04:48.300> really<00:04:48.480> crank<00:04:48.750> the<00:04:48.900> stereo<00:04:48.960> system<00:04:49.680> up<00:04:49.830> and

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:50.040 
to really crank the stereo system up and

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:51.410 
to really crank the stereo system up and
all<00:04:50.550> of<00:04:50.640> a<00:04:50.670> sudden<00:04:50.700> the<00:04:51.030> battery<00:04:51.300> voltage

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:51.420 
all of a sudden the battery voltage

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:52.880 
all of a sudden the battery voltage
protection<00:04:51.990> can<00:04:52.290> kick<00:04:52.470> on<00:04:52.560> and<00:04:52.770> all<00:04:52.830> the

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:52.890 
protection can kick on and all the

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:54.680 
protection can kick on and all the
sudden<00:04:53.040> your<00:04:53.190> heated<00:04:53.430> seats<00:04:53.670> turn<00:04:53.940> off<00:04:54.150> or

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:54.690 
sudden your heated seats turn off or

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:56.810 
sudden your heated seats turn off or
certain<00:04:55.410> like<00:04:55.530> your<00:04:55.710> power<00:04:55.950> seats<00:04:56.340> won't<00:04:56.610> move

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:56.820 
certain like your power seats won't move

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:01.010 
certain like your power seats won't move
and<00:04:57.180> so<00:04:57.360> you<00:04:57.900> you<00:04:58.260> really<00:04:58.650> have<00:04:59.550> to<00:04:59.940> be<00:05:00.660> very

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
and so you you really have to be very

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:02.360 
and so you you really have to be very
careful<00:05:01.320> when<00:05:01.620> you're<00:05:01.710> doing<00:05:01.950> the<00:05:02.010> mods<00:05:02.190> in

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370 
careful when you're doing the mods in

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:05.300 
careful when you're doing the mods in
this<00:05:02.490> car<00:05:02.870> so<00:05:03.870> if<00:05:04.440> I<00:05:04.530> brought<00:05:04.710> this<00:05:04.920> card<00:05:05.190> in

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.310 
this car so if I brought this card in

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:06.650 
this car so if I brought this card in
stock<00:05:05.610> how<00:05:05.850> much<00:05:06.000> would<00:05:06.240> this<00:05:06.390> type<00:05:06.630> of
