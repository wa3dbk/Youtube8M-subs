00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.930
 We are here on the Lord's site. 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:09.300
 Jorge the sack is Jorge in the 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.929
 county of piety 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:15.690
 today is day 13, 11 of 2012 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:19.109
 Jorge, what you have to tell me about 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.930
 use of those products in which they 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:26.340
 You've been pouring the sips 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:28.859
 using and what you noticed is in the 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:29.730
 their artichoke with the application of these 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:35.880
 products 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:42.989
 Good, I know Bombardier is on the day that 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:46.590
 I had a lecture at the house and then I went 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:51.960
 studying what is a good day 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:56.750
 then people came to know that it is a product 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:01:02.449
 improved better than 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:06.080
 hold was curious to use it 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:10.220
 I spoke by robert 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:18.170
 I bought a bombardier and started using 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:21.869
 and during that day that was applied until 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:28.080
 I started using it before harvest 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:32.810
 so I began to notice the difference in caliber 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:36.900
 it gets bigger but it 's thicker 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:38.130
 more firm and spoken is a product 

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.950
 tasso product 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.030
 then I asked him several times 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.960
 also 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:50.220
 I'm telling the truth for two months. 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:53.310
 but I have not used it all at one stage 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:57.320
 vegetative dog so all in 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:02:01.630
 vegetative phase and began to vote 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:04.360
 Look, I was not leaving. 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:07.210
 Artichoke become a thousand of his 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:12.190
 difference in terms of dog weight 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:13.330
 I noted the difference of the weight of the 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:16.780
 fruit 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:22.410
 It was much heavier and heavier as well 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:25.660
 the better it is in correlation 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:29.349
 did you do so many applications in the 

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:32.950
 whole dog cycle is I met 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:37.269
 before then the harvest cycle 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:47.380
 policy is I applied four times only 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:49.450
 which dose is 5 6 liter for 2006 

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:51.430
 letters 2000 and change the lord 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:55.480
 content with the results then with the 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:03:02.230
 good applications from was very 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:04.209
 surprise by what bombardier is made 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:08.620
 It gives the result nÃ© 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:14.200
 and now, after you 've finished, 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:18.280
 sprayed in combat and he shoots 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:22.150
 It looks like it's coming or voting more 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:24.700
 more vigorous than we thought 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:28.030
 this force you are only noticing is a 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:31.660
 force of leaving the plant soft or 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:35.579
 plant is coming vigorous with structure 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:39.819
 the plant is coming with the structure is 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:44.830
 planting healthy and hard is not not hard 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:49.650
 plant to be such a film 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:53.650
 a plant that's the way it's coming 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:54.220
 even illness I do not think it goes into 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.660
 shock 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.120
 So you 're happy with the 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.260
 bombardino use of a culture of 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.630
 dog 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.500
 I'm satisfied, thank you, Mr. Jorge. 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:04.500
 anything
