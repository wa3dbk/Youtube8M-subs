 The Faculty of Pharmacy of the University of Navarre has a 

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:20.220
 trajectory of more than 40 years 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.470
 its objectives to train health professionals of excellence in different 

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:25.899
 areas of health 

00:00:25.899 --> 00:00:30.039
 pharmaceutics specialists of a establishment and its application to 

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:30.939
 patient 

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:33.939
 and dietitians nutritionists specialists 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.530
 nutrition clinic nutrition education your industry management 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:39.860
 food 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:42.150
 has many professional possibilities 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.600
 and is that apart from the defense that of course 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.860
 the results of the research the midfielder with the outs 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.380
 hospitals does not have information tic osuna people who 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:57.310
 spaces in the semifinals but topics in biology topics in biochemistry from 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:00.580
 Become a professional like a hook 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:03.530
 that can adapt very well in many positions 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.489
 to achieve these objectives 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.369
 we have three fundamental pillars in the first place the internationalization 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:12.510
 the students that wish it 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.980
 they can carry out part of their training billy 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.990
 studying elective subjects in general English both part of their 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.660
 theoretical training this practice abroad tutored stays 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.660
 it is a compulsory subject of the degree studies 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:30.100
 participate in 

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.580
 in hospital tasks or in pharmacy offices 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.580
 we have an agreement to facilitate these stays abroad 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.170
 with 25 American universities 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.890
 Seven United States and South America as Florida Oxilia 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:48.500
 and also from the main European universities as the audience 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:49.920
 from Barcelona 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.310
 and bonn in germany we also receive students to make their stays 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.300
 supervised in the university clinic 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.430
 and in different centers of Navarre with which we have agreements 

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.210
 and 46 are 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.130
 Many students come to carry out their final research projects. 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:07.660
 liked by the participant 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.509
 in investigations with different departments 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.290
 would send to internationalization 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.980
 this hike very present in our department we are now 

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:20.160
 I would say that we are like the first option because we have something 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.160
 Italian students Bulgarian Portuguese Brazilian students 

00:02:23.999 --> 00:02:26.999
 she is very international salty shetty 

00:02:27.899 --> 00:02:28.909
 the career theme 

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:29.999
 I had the chance 

00:02:29.999 --> 00:02:33.359
 d go abroad pierina london make them fail 

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:37.809
 in the rest of the hospitals in the center of the goal to meet people 

00:02:40.149 --> 00:02:41.669
 the device works 

00:02:41.669 --> 00:02:42.700
 the second pillar 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.229
 this investigation 

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:48.089
 the faculty is set in a field of medical study 

00:02:48.649 --> 00:02:52.159
 with research centers of France enough as the center of 

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:54.419
 medical research applied top 

00:02:54.419 --> 00:02:57.419
 the applied pharmacobiology research center 

00:02:58.529 --> 00:03:02.879
 also has other centers such as the university clinic the pilot plant 

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:07.039
 of drug manufacturing science institutes of the 

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:10.809
 We are in a unique biomedical campus in Spain 

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:14.239
 nor with the hurricane is it an indelible mark to have a synergy between 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:17.540
 centers like the climate with better figures 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.669
 the Valencian center the field 

00:03:19.669 --> 00:03:22.649
 then of course all the faculties I think we have the potential 

00:03:22.649 --> 00:03:26.849
 to be able to develop in different fields like those that now 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:29.369
 raised biomedical research 

00:03:29.369 --> 00:03:33.849
 Good thing it generates a lot of great challenges from donosti that the pharmacist is 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:37.759
 a professional I know perfectly well his collaboration business with a good 

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:39.519
 team researchers 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:43.040
 the third pillar is the humanistic education that provides a glimpse 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.619
 to his students 

00:03:44.619 --> 00:03:48.419
 and if we consider a fundamental element for any professional performance 

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:49.999
 a pretty career 

00:03:49.999 --> 00:03:51.259
 that trend 

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:53.519
 very well what are agencies l 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:55.709
 that is something important that is 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:59.279
 from the faculty of pharmacy of the University of Navarre we prepare every year 

00:03:59.279 --> 00:04:00.499
 future professionals 

00:04:00.499 --> 00:04:02.459
 from the moment they enter through the door 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:05.459
 coves of alfaz eminently practical 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:09.449
 possibly the best prepared ones advancing 

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:12.449
 the pharmacy holiday as a destination 

00:04:13.499 --> 00:04:15.959
 if you have professional ambition 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:16.470
 make known
