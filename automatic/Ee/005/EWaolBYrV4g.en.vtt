00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
here is that they really cared they're

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.870

struggle<00:02:02.810> with<00:02:03.020> the<00:02:03.140> material<00:02:03.800> then<00:02:04.310> they

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
struggle with the material then they

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:06.310

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
help and time and I think that that's

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.180

something<00:02:08.720> that's<00:02:08.960> really<00:02:09.200> really<00:02:09.440> important

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.190 
something that's really really important

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:12.850 
something that's really really important
and<00:02:10.399> growing<00:02:11.360> and<00:02:11.540> learning<00:02:11.720> as<00:02:12.080> a<00:02:12.110> person<00:02:12.620> and

and growing and learning as a person and

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.740 
and growing and learning as a person and
it's<00:02:13.100> just<00:02:13.400> something<00:02:13.910> that<00:02:14.090> you<00:02:14.330> can't<00:02:14.600> get

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
it's just something that you can't get

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.750 
it's just something that you can't get
anywhere<00:02:14.810> else<00:02:15.230> I<00:02:15.560> feel<00:02:15.830> like<00:02:16.160> we<00:02:16.310> have<00:02:16.430> a<00:02:16.460> big
