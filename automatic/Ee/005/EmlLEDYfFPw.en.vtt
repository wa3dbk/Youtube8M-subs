00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:08.359
 Welcome back to this 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.359
 First, thank you very much 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:15.529
 Josephine tears and laughs well here 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.150
 namely on my facebook page 

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:20.070
 leave a comment, then 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.480
 Just posted to the pin board and me 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.519
 said that see the next video 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.430
 and that's why you see what we do 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.960
 So here today , thanks to the two 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.929
 and here you see her youtube now 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.070
 channels if you send me the links 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:34.290
 Let's see something again 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.980
 Well, now we come to 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:41.430
 so-called turnover pass the turn overs 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.750
 It looks something like this 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.450
 as if you would just take the cards 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:47.340
 turn around but what happened 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.170
 I have a card here now 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.920
 with , for example, in the case 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:55.079
 angular 3 and in which I have the cards 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.730
 turn around I control these three after 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.989
 at the top 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:02.190
 how this works I show you 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:04.760
 now from behind the camera so that the 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:08.820
 the whole thing happened the following 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:10.350
 you have a break over the map 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.110
 you want to control upwards now 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.549
 or of course under the card you 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.930
 so want to control down that 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.060
 Deck will be at this point, then 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.689
 that's the essential thing like 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:24.299
 Well, that's what the bottom package is all about 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:27.360
 is essentially on the upper package 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:29.100
 put on it and with these upwards 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.350
 the upper package will simply be lying 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.820
 turned that that is the whole 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.840
 fundamental so and now we come 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.970
 to how to then performs the whole 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.939
 So you keep the cards as always completely 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.560
 normal index finger here thumb in front so 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.860
 at the side and the three fingers 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:50.250
 now, however, is the index finger 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:53.310
 down and touched with this first one 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:56.040
 limb down here 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:57.570
 the bottom card will be the same 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.700
 important because if we are here now 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.799
 then it is with the 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.399
 index finger helps these cards 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:07.469
 to turn this package over here and so 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.610
 all this from the beginning so there 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:11.390
 You have to introduce yourself in front 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.390
 are the spectators 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.060
 the right hand goes in a bit before 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:19.090
 a small angle so that the 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.410
 spectators a bit more this deck 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.230
 seen and less the cards but they 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:29.110
 go a bit and to the side that 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:31.239
 So it's about as and before 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.640
 a little bit up is almost over this corner 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:35.800
 something about the corner and at the same time 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.840
 but you found that turning so here 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:41.530
 out you can just one 

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.970
 a little bit so practice the thumb out 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.950
 stay at the side 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.680
 so you do not look at the whole thing like that 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.780
 and if you are at the point where the package 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.390
 here the lower package at the top 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:55.360
 is over then the index finger 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:58.569
 Here the package takes over and turns 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:01.209
 it down and once it's down there 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:02.099
 arrived , the bottom turned with and 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:06.880
 arrive here 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:09.519
 okay, a little faster 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.890
 it goes to the front turns her turn 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:13.120
 that and walks over and then a 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:18.130
 Fluid movement because it does not 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:21.670
 but it is a fluid movement 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.989
 ok, no big deal is out for 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:24.700
 the spectator as if you were just 

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:26.680
 only the cards turn so if the 

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.640
 now more spectators from above 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.079
 then you can look after them too 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:31.030
 can go forward for such leave 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:32.079
 you also just the cards so directly 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:34.299
 just handed over 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:36.880
 and so do when the spectator of 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:38.829
 almost on top of it looks yes it is always 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.260
 a little winkler depending on that 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:43.150
 memorize it then if practicing now 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:44.350
 nevertheless it is difficult so actually 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.690
 The audience should only in one 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:49.389
 Direction be for example an 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:51.130
 spectator is and here and there then becomes 

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:53.410
 difficult because no one sees it then 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:56.650
 always from the side or from the other 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:57.670
 side or so only one 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:02.650
 direction more optimal 

00:03:57.670 --> 00:04:03.190
 so a few more tricks from now 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.959
 ahead 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:07.030
 So what else is there to this angle 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:10.510
 you have a break here now 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:12.760
 wonderful as you want it to be natural 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.799
 yes of course from hemer and therefore 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.930
 Do not you do it like this or something ? 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:19.109
 so far no one is kicking rizzoli cards 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:22.150
 without that means only very little 

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:24.099
 and so easily and in the moment where 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:28.090
 it starts to turn turned yes too 

00:04:24.099 --> 00:04:31.590
 Turn this way and then you are at the 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:35.169
 point where the corner is over here 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:40.090
 and then you turn in the moment 

00:04:35.169 --> 00:04:43.150
 this package is so forward and forward again 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:44.560
 you turn everything over and that 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.440
 most important is that it really is one 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:50.020
 flowing movement remains 

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:51.220
 if and above all this here this 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:52.870
 we do not avoid that 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.479
 claps or complains because I mean the 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:57.940
 cards with what should work there or 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:05:00.340
 clapping has that is illogical so 

00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:01.479
 a little movement and especially that 

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:03.010
 is actually the important one 

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:05.020
 most important instruction as soon as you do that 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:07.300
 have on it yes that is really no 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:10.300
 easier occupation than a lot of exercise in it 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:12.550
 but the turnover pass has its 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:15.190
 benefits such as i 'm going 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:16.690
 somehow so through the cards finds the 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:18.520
 card that I want to get up to 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:20.169
 For example, the herzbuben and says so her 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.700
 like you see all cards the same 

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:24.669
 makes at the distance I take my 

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:26.680
 break so we can yes then I say 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:28.960
 kind of like, then we can 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:31.840
 yes directly with the dirt and click 

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:33.190
 the card was that and everything was 

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:37.229
 You know what I mean 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:40.000
 then you have the card just above okay 

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:42.340
 well the most important instruction too 

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.900
 fast and that does not make much of a difference 

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:45.520
 it if her cards so our 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:47.169
 look at the cards already 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.969
 spectator the spectator looks namely 

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:51.849
 wherever he looks when you are 

00:05:48.969 --> 00:05:53.169
 will you turn that over on the 

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:54.130
 cards would also be fixed as 

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:55.900
 look and maybe that will 

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:58.419
 remember if now but completely 

00:05:55.900 --> 00:06:00.520
 easy says okay so we are all cards 

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:03.580
 Immediately then he looks at the spectator 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:05.500
 Eye contact in the eyes and says good 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:07.180
 there you can start with the trick and do it 

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:08.650
 it by the way it really is the 

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:10.719
 spectators maybe from the corner of the eye 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:12.280
 see that we bypass the cards 

00:06:10.719 --> 00:06:12.849
 and does not think anything about it that is 

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:16.630
 the most important 

00:06:12.849 --> 00:06:19.330
 mister action distraction so practice this 

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:20.560
 only who is really great and if he is 

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:22.080
 has a little bit on it then is too 

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:25.139
 really completely invisible 

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:27.780
 maybe before at the one 

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:31.379
 or other forms of her have seen 

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:32.580
 So practice the profession and give notice and 

00:06:31.379 --> 00:06:35.789
 have fun with it 

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:37.770
 I hope that helped as I said 

00:06:35.789 --> 00:06:39.569
 every Friday there are new videos now 

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:42.180
 So you have a week around again 

00:06:39.569 --> 00:06:42.750
 on facebook tell me what you like 

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:45.960
 would like to see 

00:06:42.750 --> 00:06:49.409
 I hope that does too and we see 

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:54.379
 then and think of a canal 

00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:56.550
 Subscribe because that's the most important thing 

00:06:54.379 --> 00:06:59.300
 Well, see you next time 

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:59.300
 times servus
