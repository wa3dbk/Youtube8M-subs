00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:20.099 
let me introduce you to my plant Irene I

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:21.829 
let me introduce you to my plant Irene I
love<00:00:20.609> it<00:00:20.699> but<00:00:20.939> I<00:00:21.029> keep<00:00:21.300> forgetting<00:00:21.630> to<00:00:21.660> water

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:21.839 
love it but I keep forgetting to water

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:24.380 
love it but I keep forgetting to water
it<00:00:21.990> say<00:00:22.500> no<00:00:22.650> more<00:00:22.800> have<00:00:23.369> an<00:00:23.460> idea<00:00:23.669> we're<00:00:24.300> going

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
it say no more have an idea we're going

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.359 
it say no more have an idea we're going
to<00:00:24.480> going<00:00:24.660> to<00:00:24.749> connect<00:00:25.259> your<00:00:25.410> plant<00:00:25.710> to<00:00:26.189> my

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
to going to connect your plant to my

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.550 
to going to connect your plant to my
robot<00:00:26.640> icon<00:00:26.820> for<00:00:27.449> that<00:00:27.599> we'll<00:00:28.199> need<00:00:28.230> an

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
robot icon for that we'll need an

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.460 
robot icon for that we'll need an
Arduino<00:00:29.009> and<00:00:29.160> next<00:00:29.609> we<00:00:29.699> module<00:00:30.470> moisture

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
Arduino and next we module moisture

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.530 
Arduino and next we module moisture
sensor<00:00:31.740> of<00:00:31.859> course<00:00:32.070> and<00:00:32.310> an<00:00:32.669> i/o<00:00:33.030> expansion

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
sensor of course and an i/o expansion

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:34.910 
sensor of course and an i/o expansion
shields<00:00:33.870> in<00:00:33.960> order<00:00:34.110> to<00:00:34.199> put<00:00:34.469> all<00:00:34.739> that

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
shields in order to put all that

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.209 
shields in order to put all that
together<00:00:35.690> we're<00:00:36.690> going<00:00:36.930> to<00:00:37.050> connect<00:00:37.440> my<00:00:37.920> plant

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
together we're going to connect my plant

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.920 
together we're going to connect my plant
to<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.059> internet<00:00:40.820> isn't<00:00:41.820> that<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.300> geekiest

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
to the internet isn't that the geekiest

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.880 
to the internet isn't that the geekiest
and<00:00:43.140> most<00:00:43.469> difficult<00:00:43.590> thing<00:00:44.010> to<00:00:44.039> do<00:00:45.890> probably

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
and most difficult thing to do probably

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.840 
and most difficult thing to do probably
the<00:00:46.980> geekiest<00:00:47.309> yes<00:00:48.620> difficult<00:00:49.620> no<00:00:49.769> no<00:00:50.160> no<00:00:50.280> it

the geekiest yes difficult no no no it

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.180 
the geekiest yes difficult no no no it
will<00:00:50.969> take<00:00:51.149> like<00:00:51.719> 35<00:00:52.320> seconds<00:00:52.769> it<00:00:52.920> will<00:00:53.039> be

will take like 35 seconds it will be
super<00:00:53.429> fast<00:00:53.730> and<00:00:53.969> that's<00:00:54.600> thanks<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:54.989> the

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
super fast and that's thanks to the

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.840 
super fast and that's thanks to the
marrow<00:00:55.500> BOTS<00:00:55.710> connect<00:00:56.010> they<00:00:56.460> were<00:00:56.579> reviewed

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
marrow BOTS connect they were reviewed

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.180 
marrow BOTS connect they were reviewed
before<00:00:57.320> this<00:00:58.320> thing<00:00:58.620> will<00:00:58.859> be<00:00:58.949> able<00:00:59.039> to

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
before this thing will be able to

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.029 
before this thing will be able to
connect<00:00:59.460> to<00:00:59.519> your<00:00:59.609> plant<00:00:59.850> right<00:01:00.359> away<00:01:00.600> so

00:01:01.029 --> 00:01:01.039 
connect to your plant right away so

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:04.040 
connect to your plant right away so
let's<00:01:02.039> get<00:01:02.190> started<00:01:02.309> all<00:01:02.820> right<00:01:03.089> first<00:01:03.809> thing

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:04.050 
let's get started all right first thing

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.740 
let's get started all right first thing
is<00:01:04.230> we<00:01:04.620> register<00:01:05.580> your<00:01:05.700> plant<00:01:05.940> in<00:01:06.240> my<00:01:06.420> robots

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
is we register your plant in my robots

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.260 
is we register your plant in my robots
now<00:01:07.230> you<00:01:07.290> have<00:01:07.620> we<00:01:07.980> have<00:01:08.160> your<00:01:08.310> robot<00:01:08.640> key<00:01:08.880> your

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
now you have we have your robot key your

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.300 
now you have we have your robot key your
plan<00:01:09.570> key<00:01:09.780> in<00:01:09.870> this<00:01:09.990> case<00:01:10.200> we<00:01:10.800> paste<00:01:11.070> it<00:01:11.280> here

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
plan key in this case we paste it here

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.080 
plan key in this case we paste it here
in<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:12.210> sample<00:01:12.510> code<00:01:13.010> so<00:01:14.010> paste<00:01:14.370> now<00:01:15.030> we

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
in the sample code so paste now we

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.600 
in the sample code so paste now we
connect<00:01:15.530> your<00:01:16.530> Arduino<00:01:18.110> to<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.740> computer<00:01:20.220> we

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
connect your Arduino to the computer we

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:28.070 
connect your Arduino to the computer we
program<00:01:21.000> it<00:01:23.480> mm-hmm<00:01:24.480> and<00:01:25.430> there<00:01:26.430> we<00:01:26.520> go<00:01:26.870> so<00:01:27.870> now

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
program it mm-hmm and there we go so now

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.040 
program it mm-hmm and there we go so now
the<00:01:28.140> arena<00:01:28.440> is<00:01:28.560> ready<00:01:28.770> let's<00:01:29.430> connect<00:01:30.020> the<00:01:31.020> I

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.050 
the arena is ready let's connect the I

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.820 
the arena is ready let's connect the I
expansion<00:01:31.680> shields<00:01:32.160> to<00:01:32.370> connect<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:33.270> stuff

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830 
expansion shields to connect the stuff

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:39.590 
expansion shields to connect the stuff
xvii<00:01:34.880> chest<00:01:35.880> default<00:01:36.240> settings<00:01:36.570> and<00:01:38.600> the

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
xvii chest default settings and the

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.000 
xvii chest default settings and the
moisture<00:01:39.780> sensor<00:01:40.290> to<00:01:40.590> analog<00:01:41.100> 0<00:01:42.740> so<00:01:43.740> there<00:01:43.920> we

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:44.010 
moisture sensor to analog 0 so there we

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:45.380 
moisture sensor to analog 0 so there we
are<00:01:44.040> and<00:01:44.280> of<00:01:44.370> course<00:01:44.400> we<00:01:44.670> have<00:01:44.790> a<00:01:44.820> power<00:01:45.060> lever

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
are and of course we have a power lever

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.570 
are and of course we have a power lever
here<00:01:46.040> all<00:01:47.040> right<00:01:47.160> up<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:48.240> final<00:01:48.390> step<00:01:49.580> go

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
here all right up and the final step go

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.620 
here all right up and the final step go
to<00:01:50.640> plant<00:01:50.880> that

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.430 

and<00:01:57.130> now<00:01:58.130> I<00:01:58.430> on<00:01:58.790> the<00:01:59.120> first<00:01:59.360> planned<00:01:59.690> connected

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:00.440 
and now I on the first planned connected

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.860 
and now I on the first planned connected
to<00:02:00.740> my<00:02:01.130> phone<00:02:01.400> my<00:02:01.790> robot<00:02:02.120> cloud<00:02:02.330> yes<00:02:03.320> yes

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:04.870 
to my phone my robot cloud yes yes

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.960 
to my phone my robot cloud yes yes
that's<00:02:05.870> pretty<00:02:06.050> much<00:02:06.230> it<00:02:06.430> exactly<00:02:07.430> thanks<00:02:07.850> for

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:07.970 
that's pretty much it exactly thanks for

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.410 
that's pretty much it exactly thanks for
watching<00:02:08.270> thank<00:02:08.660> you<00:02:08.810> get<00:02:09.320> connected
