00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
experimental for a reason and that was

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:02.279 
experimental for a reason and that was
horrible

00:02:02.279 --> 00:02:02.289

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
head enough power that I can actually

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:00.590 
head enough power that I can actually
hover<00:02:56.970> it<00:02:57.260> when<00:02:58.260> I<00:02:58.380> did<00:02:58.650> it<00:02:58.680> just<00:02:59.130> stall<00:03:00.090> and
