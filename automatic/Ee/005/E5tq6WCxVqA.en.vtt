well<00:00:27.769> we're<00:00:27.920> shooting<00:00:28.250> this<00:00:28.369> video<00:00:28.580> on<00:00:29.000> an

well we're shooting this video on an

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.300 
well we're shooting this video on an
iPad<00:00:29.539> Mini<00:00:29.779> and<00:00:30.230> at<00:00:30.410> the<00:00:30.529> moment<00:00:30.949> we're<00:00:31.130> using

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:31.310 
iPad Mini and at the moment we're using

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.520 
iPad Mini and at the moment we're using
its<00:00:31.580> built-in<00:00:32.090> microphone<00:00:32.750> which<00:00:33.170> is<00:00:33.320> why<00:00:33.470> it

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 
its built-in microphone which is why it

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.530 
its built-in microphone which is why it
doesn't<00:00:33.739> sound<00:00:34.100> so<00:00:34.370> great<00:00:34.550> the<00:00:35.210> mic<00:00:35.390> is

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:35.540 
doesn't sound so great the mic is

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:37.060 
doesn't sound so great the mic is
omnidirectional<00:00:35.930> so<00:00:36.559> it's<00:00:36.680> going<00:00:36.769> to<00:00:36.860> pick<00:00:37.040> up

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:37.070 
omnidirectional so it's going to pick up

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.490 
omnidirectional so it's going to pick up
sound<00:00:37.489> from<00:00:37.730> all<00:00:37.910> around<00:00:38.059> the<00:00:38.480> iPad<00:00:38.960> and<00:00:39.379> it's

a bit far from the subject in front of
the<00:00:41.720> camera<00:00:42.170> so<00:00:42.559> let's<00:00:42.769> see<00:00:42.980> if<00:00:43.070> we<00:00:43.219> can

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:09.019 
problem with that is that you're only

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:10.900
