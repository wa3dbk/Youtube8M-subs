00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
 in this video we are going to make roll 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:05.580
 Hama beads cables I was already fed up 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.500
 that I get entangled in the cables 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.290
 I got lost and with these winding cables 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.480
 I do not have any of those problems like 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.549
 You see, we're going to need a round plate 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.710
 and hama bill of medium or midi size 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.660
 to make the model watermelon this is the 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.400
 template that you will have to do you have 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.590
 to put them hama on your plate the 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.150
 same way that you see on the screen and 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.949
 once copied you put the paper of 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.990
 ironed over and if you do not have you can 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.609
 replace the oven you know 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.529
 that we have to iron those without 

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.239
 steam and the average temperature until 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.250
 the accounts are transparent on paper 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:39.390
 you have to iron it on both sides 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:41.700
 and you have to make two pieces equal 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.649
 second model is this orange if you 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.660
 like the copies as you see it in the 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.150
 screen and of this model you also have 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.430
 to make two equal figures 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.530
 and the third model is this apple 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.020
 you also have to copy this pattern in 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.740
 your plate and you make two figures 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.840
 same 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:00.820
 and now you're going to have to do this other 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.550
 pattern I have chosen transparent color 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.500
 but you can choose another color and from this 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.260
 figure you have to do two for each 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.180
 model and now we are going to assemble the scroll 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:12.490
 cables or we are going to stick it I recommend you 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.170
 that you use hot silicone as 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.360
 You see, I'm giving silicone to one of 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.490
 these pieces and I'm going to paste on this 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.060
 piece of orange so that they match 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.060
 those slots 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.480
 I give this piece silicone and I paste the 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:30.140
 another that is the same 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:32.480
 we return to silicone and paste the 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.520
 another piece of orange if you prefer to do 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:36.290
 the watermelon model or the model of the 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.750
 apple you have to follow these same 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:40.160
 steps and now you are ready to be able 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.440
 roll up our headphones are 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.820
 our cables I am super happy 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.430
 with this idea because in this way 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.590
 I have ordered the cables do not get tangled 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:52.190
 with each other that used to happen to me or 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:54.050
 they knotted me and I do not lose them either and 

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.360
 I send a greeting to everyone, especially
