when renaming mixed numbers as improper

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.160 
when renaming mixed numbers as improper
fractions<00:00:32.129> remember<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.390> denominator<00:00:33.960> does

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:34.170 
fractions remember the denominator does

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.650 
fractions remember the denominator does
not<00:00:34.350> change<00:00:34.649> that<00:00:35.010> stays<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.489> same<00:00:35.570> but<00:00:36.570> to

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
not change that stays the same but to

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.330 
not change that stays the same but to
get<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:36.930> numerator<00:00:37.200> it<00:00:37.649> is<00:00:37.829> a<00:00:37.860> two-step

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
get the numerator it is a two-step

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.810 
get the numerator it is a two-step
process<00:00:39.649> simply<00:00:40.649> take<00:00:40.890> the<00:00:41.040> denominator<00:00:41.219> and

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
process simply take the denominator and

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.549 
process simply take the denominator and
multiply<00:00:42.270> it<00:00:42.329> by<00:00:42.420> the<00:00:42.540> whole<00:00:42.809> number<00:00:43.050> that

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
multiply it by the whole number that

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:45.920 
multiply it by the whole number that
would<00:00:43.710> give<00:00:43.860> us<00:00:43.980> a<00:00:44.100> product<00:00:44.340> of<00:00:44.610> 25<00:00:45.090> and<00:00:45.420> then

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
would give us a product of 25 and then

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.630 
would give us a product of 25 and then
add<00:00:46.170> that<00:00:46.379> product<00:00:46.770> to<00:00:47.190> whatever<00:00:47.370> the

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
add that product to whatever the

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.850 
add that product to whatever the
numerator<00:00:48.120> is<00:00:48.390> in<00:00:48.629> this<00:00:49.110> case<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.469> numerator

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
numerator is in this case the numerator

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.650 
numerator is in this case the numerator
is<00:00:50.070> 2<00:00:50.309> and<00:00:50.579> 25<00:00:51.510> plus<00:00:51.899> 2<00:00:52.140> is<00:00:52.320> 27<00:00:52.890> now<00:00:53.539> that<00:00:54.539> we

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
is 2 and 25 plus 2 is 27 now that we

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.119 
is 2 and 25 plus 2 is 27 now that we
have<00:00:54.780> renamed<00:00:55.199> our<00:00:55.350> mixed<00:00:55.620> number<00:00:55.890> as<00:00:56.010> an

parentheses are separated by an addition
sign<00:01:37.020> this<00:01:37.890> means<00:01:38.189> the<00:01:38.400> terms<00:01:38.640> are<00:01:38.850> together

we<00:02:05.579> must<00:02:05.820> multiply<00:02:05.969> by<00:02:06.479> 5<00:02:06.750> on<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.079> right<00:02:07.229> side

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
we must multiply by 5 on the right side

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.400 
we must multiply by 5 on the right side

now<00:02:23.239> we<00:02:23.300> must<00:02:23.540> isolate<00:02:23.780> the<00:02:24.170> Y<00:02:24.200> variable<00:02:24.890> by

now we must isolate the Y variable by

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:27.280 
now we must isolate the Y variable by
eliminating<00:02:25.700> all<00:02:26.030> numerical<00:02:26.209> values<00:02:26.959> on<00:02:27.110> the

left-hand side of our equation we do the

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.530 
left-hand side of our equation we do the

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
opposite of adding three which is to

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.140 
opposite of adding three which is to
subtract<00:02:35.959> three<00:02:36.290> now<00:02:37.280> we<00:02:37.340> do<00:02:37.520> the<00:02:37.670> same<00:02:37.700> thing

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
subtract three now we do the same thing

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.250 
subtract three now we do the same thing

on the right hand side of our equation

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.740 
on the right hand side of our equation
as<00:02:39.830> well<00:02:39.980> so<00:02:40.459> we<00:02:40.610> may<00:02:40.640> balance<00:02:41.120> our<00:02:41.269> equation

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
as well so we may balance our equation

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.650 
as well so we may balance our equation
out<00:02:42.489> this<00:02:43.489> leaves<00:02:43.760> us<00:02:43.910> with<00:02:44.000> twenty-seven

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
out this leaves us with twenty-seven

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.120

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.040 
to three fifths after doing that we come

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.789 
to three fifths after doing that we come
up<00:04:10.159> with<00:04:10.280> an<00:04:10.400> improper<00:04:10.730> fraction<00:04:10.879> of<00:04:11.349> 165<00:04:12.349> over

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:12.799 
up with an improper fraction of 165 over

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:17.319 
up with an improper fraction of 165 over
five<00:04:13.420> after<00:04:14.420> simplifying<00:04:15.099> 165<00:04:16.099> over<00:04:16.519> five<00:04:16.759> by

five after simplifying 165 over five by

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:19.029 
five after simplifying 165 over five by
taking<00:04:17.690> the<00:04:17.780> numerator<00:04:18.229> and<00:04:18.500> dividing<00:04:18.889> it<00:04:19.009> by

00:04:19.029 --> 00:04:19.039 
taking the numerator and dividing it by

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:21.069 
taking the numerator and dividing it by
the<00:04:19.190> denominator<00:04:19.549> we<00:04:20.389> would<00:04:20.630> come<00:04:20.900> up<00:04:21.049> with

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:21.079 
the denominator we would come up with

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:24.370 
the denominator we would come up with
exactly<00:04:21.709> 33<00:04:22.070> so<00:04:23.000> our<00:04:23.150> answer<00:04:23.539> of<00:04:23.570> six<00:04:23.990> does

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
exactly 33 so our answer of six does

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.220 
exactly 33 so our answer of six does
