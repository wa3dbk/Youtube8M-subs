00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.919
 and it's just a bed and it was to show you 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:11.250
 the lawnmower I did 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:15.290
 made of barrel and changed handle 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.290
 I'll stay the way he stayed. 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:30.410
 This is the bed thrower I 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:34.760
 I did right then he is how he is 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:40.500
 here inside this piece of sugarcane has a 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:43.649
 identifier engine right here 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:50.190
 this bank part is another model of 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:54.410
 get the pain I did here to be able to 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:59.129
 make the lawn mower propeller 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:01:02.129
 here I put a computer cooler 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:05.630
 that is to help in the cooling of the 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:08.520
 motor that heats or warms up 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.950
 I do not know if I can give it to you. 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.290
 see another little fan inside 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.520
 that 2012 own line 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.009
 blender only it is not 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.340
 sufficient to cool the engine 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:23.310
 so I went back and heal and cure 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.490
 its power is 12 volts its source 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:30.979
 is here inside that barrel 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:32.450
 right here are where I'll hold on 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:34.549
 What are the arms? 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.970
 this device is to connect 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:41.649
 always press here it will trigger the 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.920
 engine and when it comes back it goes off 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:45.560
 right 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.509
 also the coach and coach who is 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:49.970
 of the builder himself, I only made one 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:51.799
 modification for it to cause 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:56.770
 works this way 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:59.509
 and here is a key to his power 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:02.179
 here he is in the mine 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:05.740
 If I can sign here, he'll go. 

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:08.450
 leaving it with faster speed 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:11.180
 and if I leave it at that point he 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:18.140
 turn off as much as I can 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:19.750
 button he will not trigger is that he is 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.660
 not normal 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:25.220
 good there I spent all wiring can 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:30.829
 field 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:33.470
 I had an extra job because the wires 

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:35.810
 out of the blender motor are 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:39.820
 short so I had to stretch them 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:41.930
 make a one vector I can is 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:44.870
 connect and disconnect whenever I want 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:47.769
 in the house when you take this piece from here 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:53.480
 Rain off the air to show you here. 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:55.870
 a show here if I take well that the 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.870
 expected 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:06.400
 ready 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:10.840
 I got here, I do not even have to leave the 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:12.459
 wires and it is the connector I will not take 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.720
 Why are you going to give a little work? 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:19.380
 is a computer source connector 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:21.849
 I did it at the boot then it fits here. 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:24.849
 this piece 100 kan 

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:27.420
 here I used in the corner of 40 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:31.239
 as I did not have a pipe reducer of 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:34.030
 50 to 40 then I made this adaptation 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:36.670
 where I put a pipe here piece of 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:40.450
 cane to make it very important to remember 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:41.470
 that without you you want to make one of 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.140
 sake 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:47.230
 Do not put on glue, and do not 

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:51.849
 leave them or use screw ensure 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:55.239
 in case the knee grips the piece of 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:57.880
 cane is much better off what 

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:59.560
 as if peace the association from within 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:03.480
 if you put glue it will not take as 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:08.290
 you pass actions here correctly to 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:10.600
 so that was one of my projects the 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:12.190
 that she called six and then make a 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:16.170
 his video working 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.170
 Do you see how cool it feels?
