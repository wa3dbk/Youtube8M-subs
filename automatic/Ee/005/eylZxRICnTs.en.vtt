00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:48.690 
gtx cards so my choice was actually

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.360 
gtx cards so my choice was actually
standing<00:01:49.290> between<00:01:49.500> the<00:01:50.840> EVGA<00:01:52.100> superclocked

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
gtx 770 with the AC x cooling I heard a

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.210 
gtx 770 with the AC x cooling I heard a
lot<00:01:57.630> about<00:01:57.660> it<00:01:58.850> or<00:01:59.850> was<00:02:00.780> I<00:02:00.930> gonna<00:02:01.080> buy<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.380> new

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:02.220 
lot about it or was I gonna buy the new

lot about it or was I gonna buy the new
Radeon<00:02:02.790> r9<00:02:03.650> 280<00:02:04.650> I<00:02:05.070> did<00:02:05.850> a<00:02:06.060> little<00:02:06.360> bit<00:02:06.630> of

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
Radeon r9 280 I did a little bit of

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.279 
Radeon r9 280 I did a little bit of
thinking<00:02:07.440> and<00:02:07.680> I<00:02:08.060> actually<00:02:09.060> decided<00:02:09.720> to<00:02:09.929> go

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
thinking and I actually decided to go

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.180 
thinking and I actually decided to go
with<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:10.619> GT

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
with the GT

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.480 
with the GT
770<00:02:12.150> the<00:02:12.720> main<00:02:12.900> reason<00:02:13.320> for<00:02:13.500> this<00:02:13.620> is<00:02:15.140> the

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
770 the main reason for this is the

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.390 
770 the main reason for this is the
redeem<00:02:17.490> card<00:02:17.880> and<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.810> coming<00:02:19.110> mental<00:02:19.680> being

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
redeem card and the coming mental being

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:27.230 
redeem card and the coming mental being
it<00:02:20.690> will<00:02:21.690> not<00:02:22.070> be<00:02:23.360> easy<00:02:24.360> to<00:02:24.750> record<00:02:26.000> I'm<00:02:27.000> not

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
it will not be easy to record I'm not

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.870 
it will not be easy to record I'm not
sure<00:02:27.450> they<00:02:27.840> might<00:02:28.220> implement<00:02:29.220> a<00:02:29.580> game

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
sure they might implement a game

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.990 
sure they might implement a game
recorder<00:02:30.450> with<00:02:30.780> the<00:02:31.020> mental<00:02:31.470> thing<00:02:31.740> all<00:02:32.730> the

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
recorder with the mental thing all the

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
recorders on the market today actually

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.120 
recorders on the market today actually

records the Direct X and the problem

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.370 
records the Direct X and the problem
with<00:02:38.280> the<00:02:38.520> new<00:02:38.700> Radeon<00:02:39.240> and<00:02:39.270> mantle<00:02:39.930> is<00:02:40.140> that

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
with the new Radeon and mantle is that

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:43.580 
with the new Radeon and mantle is that
it<00:02:40.530> doesn't<00:02:40.950> use<00:02:41.160> the<00:02:41.240> DirectX<00:02:42.240> so<00:02:43.200> I'm

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
it doesn't use the DirectX so I'm

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:47.210 
it doesn't use the DirectX so I'm
guessing<00:02:44.040> and<00:02:45.260> some<00:02:46.260> of<00:02:46.380> my<00:02:46.410> friends<00:02:46.860> are<00:02:47.010> also

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
guessing and some of my friends are also

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.840 
guessing and some of my friends are also
getting<00:02:47.640> that<00:02:48.260> mental<00:02:49.260> and<00:02:49.500> Radeon<00:02:50.130> will<00:02:50.640> make

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:50.850 
getting that mental and Radeon will make

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:54.290 
getting that mental and Radeon will make
it<00:02:51.000> extremely<00:02:51.510> hard<00:02:52.290> to<00:02:53.130> record<00:02:54.060> your

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
it extremely hard to record your

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.800 
it extremely hard to record your
gameplay

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
gameplay

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.830

unless mantle does like NVIDIA and

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
implement something like the shadow play

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:06.050 
implement something like the shadow play
and<00:03:02.030> that's<00:03:03.030> why<00:03:03.270> I<00:03:03.300> got<00:03:03.860> EVGA<00:03:05.060> superclocked

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
and that's why I got EVGA superclocked

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.670 
and that's why I got EVGA superclocked
GTX<00:03:06.930> 770<00:03:07.770> with<00:03:08.400> the<00:03:08.550> AC<00:03:08.730> X<00:03:09.090> cooling<00:03:09.540> in<00:03:10.200> all<00:03:10.440> it

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
GTX 770 with the AC X cooling in all it

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.990 
GTX 770 with the AC X cooling in all it
was<00:03:11.160> nice<00:03:11.970> it<00:03:12.330> cost<00:03:12.630> me<00:03:12.870> about<00:03:13.190> three<00:03:14.190> thousand

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
was nice it cost me about three thousand

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.860 
was nice it cost me about three thousand
crowns<00:03:15.209> I<00:03:15.660> live<00:03:16.530> in<00:03:16.650> Sweden<00:03:16.830> by<00:03:17.190> the<00:03:17.250> way<00:03:17.870> I'm

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
crowns I live in Sweden by the way I'm

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.610 
crowns I live in Sweden by the way I'm
not<00:03:18.959> sure<00:03:19.290> with<00:03:19.500> that<00:03:19.530> what<00:03:20.250> that's<00:03:20.430> in

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
not sure with that what that's in

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.479 
not sure with that what that's in
dollars<00:03:22.620> or<00:03:22.890> Euros

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
dollars or Euros

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:27.070 
dollars or Euros
I'm<00:03:23.550> guessing<00:03:23.970> it's<00:03:24.120> about<00:03:24.350> 300<00:03:25.350> euros<00:03:25.770> and

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:27.080 
I'm guessing it's about 300 euros and

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:29.690 
I'm guessing it's about 300 euros and
maybe<00:03:28.080> a<00:03:28.170> little<00:03:28.320> little<00:03:28.980> bit<00:03:29.160> more<00:03:29.430> in

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
maybe a little little bit more in

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:34.250 
maybe a little little bit more in
dollars<00:03:31.730> anyway<00:03:32.730> it<00:03:32.940> was<00:03:33.209> good<00:03:33.600> value<00:03:33.989> and

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
dollars anyway it was good value and

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.110 
dollars anyway it was good value and
they<00:03:34.560> were<00:03:34.709> they<00:03:34.860> on<00:03:34.980> one<00:03:35.220> costed<00:03:35.880> costs<00:03:36.660> about

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:38.120 
they were they on one costed costs about

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.080 
they were they on one costed costs about
two<00:03:39.120> hundred<00:03:39.239> crowns<00:03:39.600> less<00:03:39.989> that<00:03:40.440> is<00:03:40.590> about<00:03:41.090> 20

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
two hundred crowns less that is about 20

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.780 
two hundred crowns less that is about 20
euros<00:03:42.209> less<00:03:42.750> and<00:03:43.110> whatever<00:03:44.070> that<00:03:44.400> is<00:03:44.459> in

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
euros less and whatever that is in

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.170 
euros less and whatever that is in
dollars<00:03:45.120> so<00:03:46.280> very<00:03:47.280> happy<00:03:47.670> about<00:03:47.760> my<00:03:48.060> new

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
dollars so very happy about my new

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.660 
dollars so very happy about my new
graphics<00:03:48.660> card<00:03:48.959> and<00:03:49.200> I<00:03:49.320> just<00:03:50.070> installed<00:03:50.489> it

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
graphics card and I just installed it

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.440 
graphics card and I just installed it
and<00:03:51.320> tried<00:03:52.320> the<00:03:52.980> test<00:03:53.280> range<00:03:53.519> in<00:03:53.880> battlefield

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
and tried the test range in battlefield

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:59.720 
and tried the test range in battlefield
4<00:03:54.510> and<00:03:55.400> I<00:03:56.400> thought<00:03:56.850> I<00:03:57.150> should<00:03:58.130> look<00:03:59.130> at<00:03:59.340> my

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
4 and I thought I should look at my

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.770 
4 and I thought I should look at my
frames<00:04:00.480> per<00:04:00.840> second<00:04:01.230> and<00:04:01.440> also<00:04:02.330> try<00:04:03.330> out<00:04:03.540> the

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
frames per second and also try out the

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.130 
frames per second and also try out the
different<00:04:04.230> quality<00:04:05.150> settings<00:04:06.150> on<00:04:06.450> shadow

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
different quality settings on shadow

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:11.180 
different quality settings on shadow
play<00:04:07.440> so<00:04:08.400> I'm<00:04:08.700> guessing<00:04:09.120> that<00:04:09.920> YouTube<00:04:10.920> will

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
play so I'm guessing that YouTube will

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.330 
play so I'm guessing that YouTube will
fuck<00:04:11.550> it<00:04:11.700> up<00:04:11.790> completely<00:04:12.470> but<00:04:13.470> at<00:04:13.950> least<00:04:14.100> I

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
fuck it up completely but at least I

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.550 
fuck it up completely but at least I
will<00:04:14.400> see<00:04:14.700> what<00:04:15.150> I<00:04:15.360> should<00:04:15.660> be<00:04:15.840> recording<00:04:16.410> in

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
will see what I should be recording in

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.219 
will see what I should be recording in
there<00:04:17.130> are<00:04:17.370> at<00:04:17.730> the<00:04:17.910> moment<00:04:18.299> there's<00:04:18.720> only

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229 
there are at the moment there's only

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:21.920 
there are at the moment there's only
three<00:04:19.680> settings<00:04:20.400> for<00:04:20.850> shadow<00:04:21.090> play<00:04:21.390> it's

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930 
three settings for shadow play it's

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.510 
three settings for shadow play it's
still<00:04:22.320> a<00:04:22.350> beta

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
still a beta

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.089 
still a beta
and<00:04:23.970> it's<00:04:24.240> low<00:04:24.509> quality<00:04:24.750> it's<00:04:25.349> medium<00:04:25.919> quality

00:04:26.089 --> 00:04:26.099 
and it's low quality it's medium quality

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:30.680 
and it's low quality it's medium quality
and<00:04:26.699> it's<00:04:27.349> high<00:04:28.349> quality<00:04:28.860> so<00:04:29.849> I<00:04:29.880> thought<00:04:30.449> I

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
and it's high quality so I thought I

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:33.589 
and it's high quality so I thought I
should<00:04:30.720> go<00:04:31.340> through<00:04:32.340> them<00:04:32.610> all<00:04:32.789> with<00:04:33.360> you<00:04:33.569> guys

00:04:33.589 --> 00:04:33.599 
should go through them all with you guys

00:04:33.599 --> 00:04:40.790 
should go through them all with you guys
and<00:04:35.210> we're<00:04:36.210> gonna<00:04:36.360> start<00:04:36.780> now<00:04:37.160> with<00:04:38.160> the<00:04:39.800> low

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
and we're gonna start now with the low

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.110 
and we're gonna start now with the low
quality<00:04:41.130> settings

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
quality settings

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:48.589

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:02.209 
have 53,000 shallow bits per second and
those<00:05:59.310> files<00:05:59.639> are<00:06:00.050> significantly<00:06:01.050> bigger<00:06:01.650> the

five minutes of recording takes up about

00:06:04.199 --> 00:06:10.700 
five minutes of recording takes up about
1.9<00:06:05.389> gigabytes<00:06:06.389> the<00:06:07.199> hard<00:06:07.409> disk<00:06:07.620> space<00:06:09.710> I'm

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:10.710 
1.9 gigabytes the hard disk space I'm

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:13.010 
1.9 gigabytes the hard disk space I'm
gonna<00:06:10.979> take<00:06:11.909> a<00:06:11.940> good<00:06:12.150> look<00:06:12.389> at<00:06:12.630> this<00:06:12.840> video

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:15.490 
gonna take a good look at this video
once<00:06:13.530> it's<00:06:13.680> been<00:06:13.860> posted<00:06:14.370> on<00:06:14.460> YouTube<00:06:14.849> and

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:15.500 
once it's been posted on YouTube and

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.170 
once it's been posted on YouTube and
give<00:06:16.500> it<00:06:16.620> some<00:06:16.830> serious<00:06:17.039> thought<00:06:17.490> what<00:06:18.150> I

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:18.180 
give it some serious thought what I

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:21.439 
give it some serious thought what I
should<00:06:18.630> record<00:06:19.050> in<00:06:19.199> I<00:06:19.580> will<00:06:20.580> definitely<00:06:21.270> be

00:06:21.439 --> 00:06:21.449 
should record in I will definitely be

00:06:21.449 --> 00:06:23.600 
should record in I will definitely be
using<00:06:21.930> shadowplay<00:06:22.560> for<00:06:22.860> all<00:06:23.009> my<00:06:23.190> coming

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:23.610 
using shadowplay for all my coming

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:26.720 
using shadowplay for all my coming
videos<00:06:23.940> and

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:26.730 

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:29.720 

it's<00:06:27.620> actually<00:06:28.620> more<00:06:28.830> a<00:06:28.890> question<00:06:29.100> of<00:06:29.460> how

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:29.730 
it's actually more a question of how

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:32.710 
it's actually more a question of how
much<00:06:29.940> YouTube<00:06:30.540> screws<00:06:31.320> up<00:06:31.650> the<00:06:31.980> quality<00:06:32.220> I

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:32.720 
much YouTube screws up the quality I

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:35.870 
much YouTube screws up the quality I
don't<00:06:33.720> see<00:06:33.960> a<00:06:33.990> point<00:06:34.260> in<00:06:34.590> recording<00:06:35.310> in<00:06:35.490> the

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:35.880 
don't see a point in recording in the

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:39.410 
don't see a point in recording in the
high<00:06:36.180> quality<00:06:36.660> if<00:06:36.900> YouTube<00:06:37.800> fucks<00:06:38.730> it<00:06:38.880> up<00:06:39.000> down

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:39.420 
high quality if YouTube fucks it up down

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:41.450 
high quality if YouTube fucks it up down
to<00:06:39.750> something<00:06:40.380> more<00:06:40.650> like<00:06:40.890> the<00:06:41.100> low<00:06:41.220> quality

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:41.460 
to something more like the low quality

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:45.500 
to something more like the low quality
settings<00:06:42.140> so<00:06:43.140> I<00:06:43.800> think<00:06:44.610> that's<00:06:44.970> what<00:06:45.210> I<00:06:45.240> have

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:45.510 
settings so I think that's what I have

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:49.160 
settings so I think that's what I have
for<00:06:45.540> today<00:06:46.110> I<00:06:46.350> will<00:06:46.920> be<00:06:47.100> posting<00:06:48.170> more

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:49.170 
for today I will be posting more

00:06:49.170 --> 00:06:52.610 
for today I will be posting more
