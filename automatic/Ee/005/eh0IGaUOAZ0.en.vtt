okay we're at the max show here in 2012

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.160 
okay we're at the max show here in 2012
and<00:00:04.200> I<00:00:04.259> wanted<00:00:04.500> to<00:00:04.589> shoot<00:00:04.770> a<00:00:04.859> little<00:00:04.980> video<00:00:06.170> to

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
and I wanted to shoot a little video to

and I wanted to shoot a little video to
illustrates<00:00:07.760> the<00:00:08.760> answer<00:00:08.970> to<00:00:09.090> a<00:00:09.120> question

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
illustrates the answer to a question

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.049 
illustrates the answer to a question
that<00:00:09.570> I've<00:00:09.780> pursued<00:00:10.050> the<00:00:10.200> number<00:00:10.410> of<00:00:10.500> times

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:11.059 
that I've pursued the number of times

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:13.580 
that I've pursued the number of times
for<00:00:12.059> email<00:00:12.389> and<00:00:12.570> also<00:00:12.690> through<00:00:13.080> phone<00:00:13.349> calls

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
for email and also through phone calls

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.340 
for email and also through phone calls
and<00:00:13.860> here<00:00:14.040> at<00:00:14.099> the<00:00:14.160> show<00:00:14.370> and<00:00:15.150> that<00:00:15.509> is<00:00:15.690> when

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
and here at the show and that is when

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.720 
and here at the show and that is when
you<00:00:16.440> look<00:00:16.560> at<00:00:16.650> this<00:00:16.800> protein<00:00:17.130> skimmer<00:00:17.400> this<00:00:17.609> is

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
you look at this protein skimmer this is

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:18.980 
you look at this protein skimmer this is
an<00:00:17.850> AI<00:00:17.970> NS<00:00:18.300> 180<00:00:18.690> e

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
an AI NS 180 e

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.349 
an AI NS 180 e
protein<00:00:19.560> skimmer<00:00:19.800> and<00:00:20.250> you<00:00:20.730> can<00:00:20.880> see<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.150> foam

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
protein skimmer and you can see the foam

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.540 
protein skimmer and you can see the foam
level<00:00:21.689> is<00:00:21.810> about<00:00:22.080> just<00:00:22.769> above<00:00:23.130> the<00:00:23.340> halfway

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
level is about just above the halfway

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.400 
level is about just above the halfway
mark<00:00:23.820> on<00:00:24.150> the<00:00:24.240> whole<00:00:24.390> reaction<00:00:24.840> chamber<00:00:25.170> so

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
mark on the whole reaction chamber so

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.580 
mark on the whole reaction chamber so
this<00:00:26.189> is<00:00:26.310> about<00:00:26.660> over<00:00:27.660> 12<00:00:27.900> inches<00:00:28.260> so<00:00:28.320> it's

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
this is about over 12 inches so it's

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.859 
this is about over 12 inches so it's
about<00:00:28.740> 6<00:00:29.070> inches<00:00:29.340> down<00:00:29.550> and<00:00:30.000> people<00:00:30.630> have

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
about 6 inches down and people have

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:31.939 
about 6 inches down and people have
asked<00:00:31.170> you<00:00:31.230> know<00:00:31.320> how<00:00:31.349> come<00:00:31.560> there's<00:00:31.740> so<00:00:31.830> much

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:31.949 
asked you know how come there's so much

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:34.190 
asked you know how come there's so much
empty<00:00:32.219> space<00:00:32.309> down<00:00:32.759> here<00:00:32.790> and<00:00:33.719> it<00:00:33.809> has<00:00:33.960> to<00:00:34.079> do

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
empty space down here and it has to do

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.069 
empty space down here and it has to do
with<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.440> way<00:00:34.620> the<00:00:34.829> reactor<00:00:35.520> reacts<00:00:36.270> to<00:00:36.719> waste

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
with the way the reactor reacts to waste

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.260 
with the way the reactor reacts to waste
in<00:00:37.290> the<00:00:37.380> water<00:00:37.410> so<00:00:38.340> what<00:00:38.460> I'm<00:00:38.520> going<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:38.700> do<00:00:38.879> is

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
in the water so what I'm going to do is

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.819 
in the water so what I'm going to do is
I'm<00:00:39.450> going<00:00:39.480> to<00:00:39.660> put<00:00:39.840> some<00:00:40.320> waste<00:00:40.530> in<00:00:40.739> the

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
I'm going to put some waste in the

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:41.990 
I'm going to put some waste in the
system<00:00:41.129> and<00:00:41.280> show<00:00:41.399> you<00:00:41.460> how<00:00:41.640> that<00:00:41.820> little

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
system and show you how that little

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.290 
system and show you how that little
level<00:00:42.300> changes<00:00:42.750> so<00:00:42.930> of<00:00:43.440> a<00:00:43.530> bucket<00:00:43.829> of<00:00:44.300> protein

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
level changes so of a bucket of protein

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.529 
level changes so of a bucket of protein
waste<00:00:45.570> here<00:00:46.250> let's<00:00:47.250> take<00:00:47.460> this

00:00:49.529 --> 00:00:49.539 
waste here let's take this

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:55.380 
waste here let's take this
drop<00:00:50.140> it<00:00:50.289> in<00:00:50.350> the<00:00:50.469> system<00:00:54.000> will<00:00:55.000> happen<00:00:55.300> is

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:55.390 
drop it in the system will happen is

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:01.350 
drop it in the system will happen is
you'll<00:00:55.539> start<00:00:55.719> to<00:00:55.780> see<00:00:55.809> that<00:00:55.930> level<00:00:56.409> go<00:00:56.530> down

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:01.360 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:03.970 

so<00:01:02.360> look<00:01:02.540> so<00:01:02.660> we've<00:01:02.780> gone<00:01:02.989> from<00:01:03.050> six<00:01:03.680> inches

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:03.980 
so look so we've gone from six inches

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:10.180 
so look so we've gone from six inches
down<00:01:04.220> to<00:01:04.280> eight<00:01:04.640> inches<00:01:08.229> we've<00:01:09.229> also<00:01:09.410> see<00:01:09.830> the

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:10.190 
down to eight inches we've also see the

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:12.840 
down to eight inches we've also see the
schemer<00:01:10.490> trying<00:01:10.700> to<00:01:10.760> come<00:01:10.910> to<00:01:11.030> life<00:01:11.210> up<00:01:11.390> here

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:12.850 
schemer trying to come to life up here

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:19.130 
schemer trying to come to life up here
we<00:01:13.850> open<00:01:13.940> it<00:01:14.150> up<00:01:14.240> some<00:01:14.450> more

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.330 

just<00:01:20.140> in<00:01:20.290> the<00:01:20.380> outlet<00:01:20.650> assembly<00:01:21.010> to<00:01:21.100> keep<00:01:21.220> the

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
just in the outlet assembly to keep the

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.030 
just in the outlet assembly to keep the
foam<00:01:21.520> level<00:01:21.880> too<00:01:22.000> low

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:26.830 

it's<00:01:25.580> know<00:01:25.760> you<00:01:25.820> can<00:01:26.000> see<00:01:26.210> that<00:01:26.450> level<00:01:26.720> is

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
it's know you can see that level is

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.380 
it's know you can see that level is
dropped

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.280 

a<00:01:29.450> good<00:01:30.110> two<00:01:30.320> three<00:01:30.350> inches<00:01:31.390> and<00:01:32.390> that's<00:01:32.840> the

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.290 
a good two three inches and that's the

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:35.530 
a good two three inches and that's the
indication<00:01:33.680> that<00:01:34.070> there's<00:01:34.970> more<00:01:35.150> waste<00:01:35.390> in

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:35.540 
indication that there's more waste in

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.250 
indication that there's more waste in
the<00:01:35.630> system<00:01:36.490> and<00:01:37.490> therefore<00:01:37.810> more<00:01:38.810> bubbles

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:39.260 
the system and therefore more bubbles

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:40.899 
the system and therefore more bubbles
are<00:01:39.409> being<00:01:39.590> produced<00:01:39.830> smaller<00:01:40.369> bubbles<00:01:40.790> are

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909 
are being produced smaller bubbles are

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:42.250 
are being produced smaller bubbles are
being<00:01:41.060> produced<00:01:41.240> you<00:01:41.420> can<00:01:41.540> also<00:01:41.659> see<00:01:41.960> in<00:01:42.080> there

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:42.260 
being produced you can also see in there

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.170 
being produced you can also see in there
and<00:01:42.950> a<00:01:43.010> lot<00:01:43.130> more<00:01:43.190> micro<00:01:43.670> bubbles<00:01:43.850> being

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
and a lot more micro bubbles being

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.200 
and a lot more micro bubbles being
produced<00:01:44.510> as<00:01:44.750> well<00:01:45.520> so<00:01:46.520> that's<00:01:46.670> a<00:01:46.759> phenomenon

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
produced as well so that's a phenomenon

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:48.400 
produced as well so that's a phenomenon
that<00:01:47.360> you'll<00:01:47.509> notice<00:01:47.660> in<00:01:47.869> the<00:01:47.960> system<00:01:48.259> as<00:01:48.380> a

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:48.410 
that you'll notice in the system as a

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:50.499 
that you'll notice in the system as a
system<00:01:48.800> is<00:01:48.950> it's<00:01:49.550> a<00:01:49.640> new<00:01:49.790> system<00:01:50.180> and<00:01:50.360> you<00:01:50.420> have

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
system is it's a new system and you have

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:52.510 
system is it's a new system and you have
a<00:01:50.570> very<00:01:50.750> light<00:01:50.930> bio<00:01:51.229> load<00:01:51.530> the<00:01:52.159> bubbles<00:01:52.430> are

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
a very light bio load the bubbles are

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.649 
a very light bio load the bubbles are
going<00:01:52.640> to<00:01:52.729> be<00:01:52.790> very<00:01:53.000> low<00:01:53.119> in<00:01:53.240> their<00:01:53.330> action

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:53.659 
going to be very low in their action

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:55.090 
going to be very low in their action
chamber<00:01:53.930> but<00:01:54.050> as<00:01:54.170> the<00:01:54.380> system<00:01:54.710> builds<00:01:54.979> up

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:55.100 
chamber but as the system builds up

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.550 
chamber but as the system builds up
waste<00:01:55.520> and<00:01:55.820> more<00:01:56.150> food<00:01:56.360> is<00:01:56.450> imported<00:01:56.900> they<00:01:57.409> get

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:57.560 
waste and more food is imported they get

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.020 
waste and more food is imported they get
a<00:01:57.590> lot<00:01:57.770> more<00:01:57.800> foam<00:01:58.220> being<00:01:58.430> produced<00:01:58.670> bubbles

00:01:59.020 --> 00:01:59.030 
a lot more foam being produced bubbles

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.510

being<00:01:59.210> produced<00:01:59.420> and<00:01:59.900> more<00:02:00.860> foam<00:02:01.070> 8<00:02:01.190> etcetera

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
being produced and more foam 8 etcetera

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:09.119 
being produced and more foam 8 etcetera
so<00:02:02.560> again<00:02:03.560> as<00:02:03.740> you<00:02:05.410> adjustments<00:02:06.410> to<00:02:06.560> it

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:09.129 

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:12.380 

and<00:02:09.429> get<00:02:09.519> that<00:02:09.670> level<00:02:09.909> to<00:02:09.999> come<00:02:10.149> up

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:13.670 

you're<00:02:12.900> gonna<00:02:12.990> be<00:02:13.110> pushing<00:02:13.290> that<00:02:13.500> phone

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
you're gonna be pushing that phone

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.190 
you're gonna be pushing that phone
number<00:02:13.770> down<00:02:14.040> and<00:02:14.700> see<00:02:14.880> as<00:02:15.060> its<00:02:15.240> remove<00:02:16.020> the

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
number down and see as its remove the

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:19.160 
number down and see as its remove the
waste<00:02:16.790> in<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:17.880> system<00:02:18.090> see<00:02:18.780> right<00:02:18.930> there

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:19.170 
waste in the system see right there

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.190 
waste in the system see right there
pulling<00:02:19.620> it<00:02:19.710> all<00:02:19.830> out<00:02:20.750> and<00:02:21.750> your<00:02:21.930> bubble

levels<00:02:22.500> gone<00:02:22.620> back<00:02:22.830> up<00:02:22.860> again<00:02:23.480> so<00:02:24.800> just

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
levels gone back up again so just

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:26.960 
levels gone back up again so just
thought<00:02:25.890> that<00:02:26.040> would<00:02:26.130> be<00:02:26.160> a<00:02:26.220> good<00:02:26.370> way<00:02:26.490> to<00:02:26.550> show

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
thought that would be a good way to show

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.240 
thought that would be a good way to show
an<00:02:27.390> illustrate<00:02:27.930> how<00:02:28.170> the<00:02:28.230> skimmer<00:02:28.770> reacts<00:02:29.070> to

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
an illustrate how the skimmer reacts to

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.790 
an illustrate how the skimmer reacts to
waste<00:02:29.430> in<00:02:29.640> the<00:02:29.730> water<00:02:29.760> and<00:02:30.630> a<00:02:30.720> bio<00:02:30.930> load<00:02:31.200> or<00:02:31.560> a

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
waste in the water and a bio load or a

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.880 
waste in the water and a bio load or a
heavy<00:02:31.830> bio<00:02:32.250> load<00:02:32.490> versus<00:02:32.790> a<00:02:32.820> light<00:02:33.000> by<00:02:33.240> low<00:02:33.890> so

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
heavy bio load versus a light by low so

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.110 
heavy bio load versus a light by low so
