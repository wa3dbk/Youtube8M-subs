00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
thought about the fact that this is a

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.029 
thought about the fact that this is a

bright<00:01:02.640> red<00:01:02.879> hot<00:01:03.840> color<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:04.619> how<00:01:05.220> amazing

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
bright red hot color and how amazing

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.969 
bright red hot color and how amazing
that<00:01:06.119> was<00:01:06.330> that<00:01:06.570> it<00:01:06.659> could<00:01:06.780> take<00:01:07.020> away<00:01:07.409> the
