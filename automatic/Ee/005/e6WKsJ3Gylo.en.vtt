which<00:03:50.269> is<00:03:50.390> a<00:03:50.420> new<00:03:50.660> thing<00:03:50.690> for<00:03:51.380> most<00:03:51.650> problems

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
which is a new thing for most problems

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:54.039 
which is a new thing for most problems
at<00:03:52.160> the<00:03:52.220> moment<00:03:52.250> you<00:03:52.910> pull<00:03:53.120> those<00:03:53.299> and<00:03:53.600> that

at the moment you pull those and that

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:59.560 
at the moment you pull those and that
keeps<00:03:54.260> it<00:03:54.410> VC<00:03:54.920> aligned<00:03:55.640> to<00:03:55.820> interface<00:03:58.570> the

00:03:59.560 --> 00:03:59.570 
keeps it VC aligned to interface the

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:01.660 
keeps it VC aligned to interface the
footrest<00:03:59.959> isn't<00:04:00.260> adjustable<00:04:00.769> but<00:04:01.250> I<00:04:01.280> think<00:04:01.549> is

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:01.670 
footrest isn't adjustable but I think is

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:02.850 
footrest isn't adjustable but I think is
fun

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:02.860 
fun

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:07.000
