you'd be looking at 25 to 30 pounds of

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.550 
you'd be looking at 25 to 30 pounds of
minimum<00:00:35.149> and<00:00:35.450> it's<00:00:35.660> a<00:00:35.750> stunning<00:00:36.170> looking

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:36.560

alarm<00:00:36.920> as<00:00:37.070> well<00:00:37.250> so<00:00:37.880> we<00:00:37.970> also<00:00:38.120> do<00:00:38.570> this<00:00:38.750> in<00:00:38.990> a

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:39.080 
alarm as well so we also do this in a

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.750 
alarm as well so we also do this in a
wireless<00:00:39.470> set<00:00:39.680> which<00:00:39.800> I'll<00:00:39.950> show<00:00:40.160> you<00:00:40.190> later

on for the time being I'll just show you
how<00:00:42.920> this<00:00:43.220> one<00:00:43.430> works<00:00:43.610> as<00:00:44.330> you<00:00:44.510> can<00:00:44.660> see<00:00:44.900> it's

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:45.470 
how this one works as you can see it's

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.290 
how this one works as you can see it's
fully<00:00:45.680> waterproof<00:00:46.960> just<00:00:47.960> use<00:00:48.500> standard

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:49.300 
fully waterproof just use standard

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.830 
fully waterproof just use standard

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:53.840 
battery the Morse alarms tick nice

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:55.510 
battery the Morse alarms tick nice
little<00:00:54.170> touch<00:00:54.350> here<00:00:54.380> it's<00:00:54.860> got<00:00:55.040> some<00:00:55.220> soft

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:55.520 
little touch here it's got some soft

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.850 
little touch here it's got some soft
rubber<00:00:55.850> pads<00:00:56.090> here<00:00:56.450> so<00:00:57.230> that<00:00:57.380> when<00:00:57.500> you<00:00:57.620> rest

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:57.860 
rubber pads here so that when you rest

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.520 
rubber pads here so that when you rest
your<00:00:57.980> rod<00:00:58.220> an<00:00:59.150> expensive<00:00:59.660> carbon<00:01:00.020> rod<00:01:00.170> it

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
your rod an expensive carbon rod it

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.110 
your rod an expensive carbon rod it
isn't<00:01:00.890> going<00:01:01.010> to<00:01:01.130> scratch<00:01:01.400> it<00:01:01.670> so<00:01:01.820> that's<00:01:02.030> a

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
isn't going to scratch it so that's a

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.140 
isn't going to scratch it so that's a
nice<00:01:02.300> little<00:01:02.329> touch<00:01:02.840> and<00:01:03.200> then<00:01:03.950> all<00:01:04.369> you<00:01:04.549> do<00:01:04.699> to

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
nice little touch and then all you do to

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.390 
nice little touch and then all you do to
actually<00:01:05.299> turn<00:01:06.079> it<00:01:06.259> on<00:01:06.380> you<00:01:06.890> press<00:01:07.100> the<00:01:07.250> volume

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.130 
actually turn it on you press the volume
control<00:01:08.030> for<00:01:08.600> three<00:01:08.750> seconds<00:01:10.900> so<00:01:11.900> you<00:01:11.960> can

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:12.140 
control for three seconds so you can

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.260 
control for three seconds so you can
hear<00:01:12.260> that<00:01:12.350> song<00:01:12.800> yeah<00:01:13.340> and<00:01:13.820> that's<00:01:13.909> all<00:01:14.120> you

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
hear that song yeah and that's all you

hear that song yeah and that's all you
have<00:01:14.390> to<00:01:14.540> do<00:01:14.659> for<00:01:14.900> that<00:01:15.100> that<00:01:16.100> now<00:01:16.310> is<00:01:16.790> such

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.220 
have to do for that that now is such

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.410 
have to do for that that now is such
beauty<00:01:19.220> about<00:01:19.400> this<00:01:19.670> it's<00:01:19.909> got<00:01:20.030> so<00:01:20.270> many

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:20.420 
beauty about this it's got so many

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.530 
beauty about this it's got so many
features<00:01:20.659> it's<00:01:21.080> unbelievable<00:01:21.940> so<00:01:22.940> we've<00:01:23.300> got

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:23.540 
features it's unbelievable so we've got

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.340 
features it's unbelievable so we've got
the<00:01:24.130> basically<00:01:25.130> the<00:01:25.630> sensitivity<00:01:26.630> now<00:01:27.200> all

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
the basically the sensitivity now all

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.460 
the basically the sensitivity now all
this<00:01:27.530> means<00:01:27.800> if<00:01:27.979> you<00:01:28.070> listen<00:01:29.110> that's<00:01:30.110> number

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:30.470 
this means if you listen that's number

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:36.780 
this means if you listen that's number
two<00:01:30.710> sensitivity<00:01:32.740> up<00:01:33.740> to<00:01:33.920> number<00:01:34.190> three<00:01:35.740> five

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:36.790 
two sensitivity up to number three five

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:40.440 
two sensitivity up to number three five
and<00:01:37.960> six<00:01:38.960> so<00:01:39.049> it's<00:01:39.200> got<00:01:39.320> one<00:01:39.530> to<00:01:39.710> six

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450 
and six so it's got one to six

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.420 
and six so it's got one to six
sensitivity<00:01:41.450> levels<00:01:41.780> and<00:01:42.080> the<00:01:42.890> difference<00:01:43.220> is

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 
sensitivity levels and the difference is

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.310 
sensitivity levels and the difference is
now<00:01:43.909> we're<00:01:44.060> on<00:01:44.180> number<00:01:44.299> six<00:01:44.659> you'll<00:01:44.840> see<00:01:45.110> that

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
now we're on number six you'll see that

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.560 
now we're on number six you'll see that
you've<00:01:45.470> got<00:01:45.530> two<00:01:46.010> actually<00:01:46.159> it's<00:01:46.670> not<00:01:46.850> set<00:01:47.360> to

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
you've got two actually it's not set to

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.840 
you've got two actually it's not set to
sensitive<00:01:48.260> so<00:01:48.860> it<00:01:48.979> takes<00:01:49.310> a<00:01:50.500> reasonable<00:01:51.500> room

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
sensitive so it takes a reasonable room

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.020 
sensitive so it takes a reasonable room
to<00:01:52.850> make<00:01:53.060> it<00:01:53.180> indicate<00:01:53.710> on<00:01:54.710> the<00:01:54.770> other<00:01:55.070> hand<00:01:55.340> if

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
to make it indicate on the other hand if

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.210 
to make it indicate on the other hand if
you<00:01:56.240> take<00:01:56.510> it<00:01:56.750> down<00:01:57.020> to<00:01:57.530> the<00:01:57.650> first<00:01:57.890> level

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:06.030 

that's<00:02:01.220> six<00:02:01.520> on<00:02:01.729> it<00:02:01.880> take<00:02:02.240> it<00:02:02.390> to<00:02:02.570> one

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:06.040 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:11.360 

you'll<00:02:06.730> find<00:02:07.770> once<00:02:08.770> the<00:02:09.119> 22nd<00:02:10.119> LEDs<00:02:10.630> gone<00:02:10.840> off

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
you'll find once the 22nd LEDs gone off

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.680 
you'll find once the 22nd LEDs gone off
which<00:02:12.370> tells<00:02:12.670> you<00:02:12.850> as<00:02:13.120> you<00:02:13.270> know<00:02:13.390> whether

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
which tells you as you know whether

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.990 
which tells you as you know whether
you've<00:02:13.840> had<00:02:13.990> a<00:02:14.020> role<00:02:14.380> or<00:02:14.530> not<00:02:14.740> but<00:02:15.580> this<00:02:15.760> knife

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
you've had a role or not but this knife

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.840 
you've had a role or not but this knife
set<00:02:16.360> very<00:02:16.750> very<00:02:17.050> very<00:02:17.320> finely<00:02:17.680> for<00:02:18.550> the<00:02:18.640> very

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
set very very very finely for the very
