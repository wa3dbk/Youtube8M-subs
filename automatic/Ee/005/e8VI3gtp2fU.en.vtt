say that how things duo really changed
at<00:01:54.329> all<00:01:54.450> at<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:54.960> beginning<00:01:55.079> he<00:01:55.590> was<00:01:55.680> a

at all at the beginning he was a

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.920 
at all at the beginning he was a
friendly<00:01:56.280> guy<00:01:56.430> fighting<00:01:57.149> for<00:01:57.360> peace<00:01:57.600> always

other people and that is exactly who he

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:03.920 
other people and that is exactly who he
was<00:02:02.790> at<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:03.360> end<00:02:03.540> of<00:02:03.719> this

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
was at the end of this

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.110 
was at the end of this
series<00:02:04.200> as<00:02:04.380> well<00:02:04.590> it's<00:02:05.280> not<00:02:05.370> necessarily<00:02:05.610> a

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:06.120 
series as well it's not necessarily a

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:08.359 
series as well it's not necessarily a
bad<00:02:06.360> thing<00:02:06.420> that<00:02:06.750> duo<00:02:07.260> didn't<00:02:07.800> do<00:02:07.890> vulvar

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
bad thing that duo didn't do vulvar

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.160 
bad thing that duo didn't do vulvar
change<00:02:08.640> because<00:02:09.060> he's<00:02:09.509> kind<00:02:09.720> of<00:02:09.780> great<00:02:10.020> the

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
change because he's kind of great the

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.400 
change because he's kind of great the
way<00:02:10.289> he<00:02:10.470> is<00:02:10.530> I<00:02:11.009> know<00:02:11.400> he's<00:02:11.880> a<00:02:11.910> fan<00:02:12.390> favorite<00:02:13.110> but

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
way he is I know he's a fan favorite but

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.830 
way he is I know he's a fan favorite but
I<00:02:13.440> think<00:02:13.830> people<00:02:14.310> can't<00:02:14.580> exactly<00:02:14.910> pinpoint

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
I think people can't exactly pinpoint

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.070 
I think people can't exactly pinpoint
why<00:02:16.290> he's<00:02:17.100> cooler<00:02:17.430> than<00:02:17.640> fun<00:02:18.030> and<00:02:18.420> funny<00:02:18.720> and

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
why he's cooler than fun and funny and

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.440 
why he's cooler than fun and funny and
his<00:02:19.230> personality<00:02:19.950> is<00:02:20.010> awesome<00:02:20.250> we<00:02:21.120> all<00:02:21.240> know

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
his personality is awesome we all know

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:22.640 
his personality is awesome we all know
that's<00:02:21.630> true

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
that's true

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.380 
that's true
he's<00:02:23.040> a<00:02:23.100> character<00:02:23.430> who<00:02:23.640> takes<00:02:23.850> an<00:02:23.970> effort<00:02:24.120> to

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
he's a character who takes an effort to

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:27.199 
he's a character who takes an effort to
like<00:02:24.570> because<00:02:25.080> he's<00:02:25.260> just<00:02:26.160> a<00:02:26.220> great<00:02:26.459> guy<00:02:26.520> and

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
like because he's just a great guy and

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.120 
like because he's just a great guy and
we'd<00:02:27.540> all<00:02:27.660> like<00:02:27.900> to<00:02:27.930> be<00:02:28.170> friends<00:02:28.500> with<00:02:28.560> him<00:02:28.800> and

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:29.130 
we'd all like to be friends with him and

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.040 
we'd all like to be friends with him and
he'd<00:02:29.400> be<00:02:29.580> a<00:02:29.610> good<00:02:29.880> friend<00:02:30.270> to<00:02:30.600> because<00:02:30.930> he

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
he'd be a good friend to because he

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.480 
he'd be a good friend to because he
wouldn't<00:02:31.380> betray<00:02:31.530> when<00:02:32.070> he<00:02:32.160> wouldn't

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
wouldn't betray when he wouldn't

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.010 
wouldn't betray when he wouldn't
 you<00:02:33.209> but<00:02:33.420> he's<00:02:33.540> always<00:02:33.750> got

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020 
 you but he's always got

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.930 
 you but he's always got
something<00:02:34.200> nice<00:02:34.500> to<00:02:34.680> say<00:02:34.709> and<00:02:35.340> I<00:02:35.550> think<00:02:35.790> the

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
something nice to say and I think the

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.460 
something nice to say and I think the
thing<00:02:36.120> that<00:02:36.300> people<00:02:36.450> like<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:36.959> most<00:02:36.989> about

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
thing that people like the most about

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.250 
thing that people like the most about
him<00:02:37.680> is<00:02:37.890> the<00:02:38.220> way<00:02:38.400> he<00:02:38.730> can<00:02:39.330> bounce<00:02:39.540> off<00:02:39.900> all<00:02:40.110> the

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
him is the way he can bounce off all the

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.620 
him is the way he can bounce off all the
other<00:02:40.410> characters<00:02:40.950> and<00:02:41.160> still<00:02:41.880> retain<00:02:42.300> his

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
other characters and still retain his

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.770 
other characters and still retain his
good<00:02:42.959> humor<00:02:43.410> and<00:02:43.760> casual<00:02:44.760> view<00:02:45.060> of<00:02:45.180> the<00:02:45.300> world

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
good humor and casual view of the world

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.390 
good humor and casual view of the world
so<00:02:46.110> maybe<00:02:46.290> duo<00:02:46.560> doesn't<00:02:46.950> need<00:02:47.070> to<00:02:47.160> change

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
so maybe duo doesn't need to change

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.790 
so maybe duo doesn't need to change
because<00:02:48.000> he's<00:02:48.270> already<00:02:48.510> sort<00:02:49.110> of<00:02:49.230> adopted

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
because he's already sort of adopted

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
because he's already sort of adopted
this<00:02:49.950> refined<00:02:50.810> view<00:02:51.810> of<00:02:52.200> how<00:02:52.830> things<00:02:53.220> are<00:02:53.489> and

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
this refined view of how things are and

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.030 
this refined view of how things are and
the<00:02:54.090> people<00:02:54.300> who<00:02:54.630> live<00:02:54.900> here<00:02:54.930> he's<00:02:55.770> not<00:02:56.010> a

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
the people who live here he's not a

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.699 
the people who live here he's not a
strategic<00:02:56.790> genius<00:02:57.090> and<00:02:57.690> maybe<00:02:57.900> he's<00:02:58.230> not<00:02:58.470> the

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
strategic genius and maybe he's not the

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.360 
strategic genius and maybe he's not the
most<00:02:58.830> adept<00:02:59.280> fighter<00:02:59.670> and<00:03:00.500> admittedly<00:03:01.500> maybe

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
most adept fighter and admittedly maybe

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.330 
most adept fighter and admittedly maybe
sometimes<00:03:03.060> he's<00:03:03.360> just<00:03:03.720> comic<00:03:04.230> relief<00:03:04.530> it's<00:03:05.220> a

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
sometimes he's just comic relief it's a

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.830 
sometimes he's just comic relief it's a
shame<00:03:05.550> that<00:03:05.580> he<00:03:05.820> didn't<00:03:06.090> get<00:03:06.180> to<00:03:06.239> do<00:03:06.450> more<00:03:06.720> in

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
shame that he didn't get to do more in

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.259 
shame that he didn't get to do more in
the<00:03:06.959> show<00:03:07.140> because<00:03:07.500> simply<00:03:07.920> adding<00:03:08.610> him<00:03:08.820> in<00:03:09.060> a

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:09.269 
the show because simply adding him in a

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:11.960 
the show because simply adding him in a
scene<00:03:09.600> made<00:03:10.410> the<00:03:10.590> scene<00:03:10.830> that<00:03:11.130> much<00:03:11.430> more<00:03:11.700> fun

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:11.970 
scene made the scene that much more fun

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:14.390 
scene made the scene that much more fun
to<00:03:12.209> watch<00:03:12.239> he<00:03:13.170> made<00:03:13.350> a<00:03:13.380> scene<00:03:13.769> where<00:03:13.980> he's<00:03:14.130> in<00:03:14.310> a

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
to watch he made a scene where he's in a

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.630 
to watch he made a scene where he's in a
prison<00:03:14.670> cell<00:03:15.030> slowly<00:03:15.480> running<00:03:15.810> out<00:03:16.019> of<00:03:16.080> air

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
prison cell slowly running out of air

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.430 
prison cell slowly running out of air
somehow<00:03:17.640> one<00:03:17.940> of<00:03:17.970> the<00:03:18.090> most<00:03:18.420> memorable<00:03:18.840> scenes

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
somehow one of the most memorable scenes

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.830 
somehow one of the most memorable scenes
in<00:03:19.680> the<00:03:19.769> entire<00:03:20.130> series<00:03:20.730> for<00:03:20.940> me<00:03:21.090> simply

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
in the entire series for me simply

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.050 
in the entire series for me simply
because<00:03:21.989> he's<00:03:22.410> just<00:03:22.860> so<00:03:22.920> enjoyable<00:03:23.430> and

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
because he's just so enjoyable and

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.030 
because he's just so enjoyable and
sometimes<00:03:24.600> you<00:03:24.780> just<00:03:24.810> need<00:03:25.080> a<00:03:25.170> character<00:03:25.650> with

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
sometimes you just need a character with

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.190 
sometimes you just need a character with
that<00:03:26.190> kind<00:03:26.400> of<00:03:26.430> attitude<00:03:26.670> to<00:03:27.330> lighten<00:03:28.170> things

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:28.200 
that kind of attitude to lighten things

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.220 
that kind of attitude to lighten things
up<00:03:28.560> so<00:03:29.130> that's<00:03:29.430> all<00:03:29.610> I<00:03:29.670> have<00:03:29.940> for<00:03:30.239> duo<00:03:30.630> Maxwell

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
up so that's all I have for duo Maxwell

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.020 
up so that's all I have for duo Maxwell
if<00:03:31.830> you<00:03:31.980> have<00:03:32.070> intended<00:03:32.310> characters<00:03:32.790> that<00:03:32.970> you

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
if you have intended characters that you

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.880 
if you have intended characters that you
want<00:03:33.150> me<00:03:33.209> to<00:03:33.330> take<00:03:33.420> a<00:03:33.480> look<00:03:33.750> at<00:03:33.900> from<00:03:34.170> the<00:03:34.560> wing
