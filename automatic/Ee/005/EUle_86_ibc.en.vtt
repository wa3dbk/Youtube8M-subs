 the classrooms going through all the areas 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:23.110

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.939

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.860
 to anÃ­bal here at the school that 

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:20.799
 It worked on a third floor then 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.539
 what was done, the preceptor was covered 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:25.939
 and they got in the round with the kids from 

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:28.039

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:29.600
 they did when they had to jog they played 

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:33.340

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.340
 tutor from above they did not see them 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.149
 It was very well known but it made 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.250
 when I was not going to park because 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:42.740
 it was raining or something he came with his 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.990

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.880

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.770

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.869
