to<00:00:07.710> address<00:00:09.230> you<00:00:10.230> really<00:00:10.500> look<00:00:10.679> at<00:00:10.800> the<00:00:10.920> best

to address you really look at the best
available<00:00:11.490> player<00:00:11.700> and<00:00:12.210> I<00:00:12.599> think<00:00:12.929> there's<00:00:13.080> a

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
available player and I think there's a

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.140 
available player and I think there's a
misnomer<00:00:13.320> do<00:00:13.830> you<00:00:13.920> go<00:00:14.099> after<00:00:14.340> a<00:00:14.610> certain<00:00:14.849> type

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
misnomer do you go after a certain type

page I talked about for at the

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.620 
page I talked about for at the
collegiate<00:01:05.010> level<00:01:05.119> and<00:01:06.119> they<00:01:06.240> mature<00:01:06.510> at

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
collegiate level and they mature at

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.660 
collegiate level and they mature at
different<00:01:06.659> points<00:01:07.320> when<00:01:07.830> mcwilliam<00:01:08.369> it<00:01:08.490> will

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
different points when mcwilliam it will

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.340

so they are maturing at different points

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.899 
so they are maturing at different points
maxi<00:01:12.900> person<00:01:13.200> will<00:01:13.320> be<00:01:13.470> a<00:01:13.500> sophomore<00:01:14.430> and

nice curve of that group coming we keep

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.330 
nice curve of that group coming we keep
the<00:01:44.130> rosters<00:01:44.689> it's<00:01:45.689> not<00:01:46.310> necessarily<00:01:47.310> a

and<00:01:52.680> trade<00:01:53.159> for<00:01:53.430> positions<00:01:53.909> so<00:01:54.720> rather<00:01:54.899> than

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
and trade for positions so rather than

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.380 
and trade for positions so rather than
say<00:01:55.259> we're<00:01:55.409> going<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.590> drop<00:01:55.770> the<00:01:55.979> center<00:01:56.390> we

are you better off taking a sentiment
because<00:02:07.690> you<00:02:07.900> need<00:02:08.080> the<00:02:08.200> position<00:02:08.650> or<00:02:09.119> mat<00:02:10.119> fin
