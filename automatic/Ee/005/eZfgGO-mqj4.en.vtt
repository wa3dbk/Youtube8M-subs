00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.399 
that the game sorta kinda plays on Rails
well<00:01:38.549> not<00:01:39.180> really<00:01:39.450> but<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.930> tracks<00:01:40.200> have

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
well not really but the tracks have

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:41.719 
well not really but the tracks have
boundaries<00:01:40.829> and<00:01:41.009> will<00:01:41.159> lead<00:01:41.310> you<00:01:41.430> on<00:01:41.549> where

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
boundaries and will lead you on where

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.550 
boundaries and will lead you on where
you<00:01:41.850> need<00:01:42.000> to<00:01:42.119> go<00:01:42.299> I<00:01:42.509> actually<00:01:42.990> like<00:01:43.380> this

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
you need to go I actually like this

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.200 
you need to go I actually like this
feature<00:01:43.799> because<00:01:44.250> you<00:01:44.430> really<00:01:44.790> can't<00:01:45.000> tell

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
feature because you really can't tell

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.719 
feature because you really can't tell
where<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.420> track<00:01:45.689> is<00:01:45.720> at<00:01:46.079> times<00:01:46.610> barrel<00:01:47.610> blast

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
where the track is at times barrel blast

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.609 
where the track is at times barrel blast
uses<00:01:48.240> rocket-propelled<00:01:48.659> barrels<00:01:49.320> that<00:01:49.470> are

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
uses rocket-propelled barrels that are

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.050 
uses rocket-propelled barrels that are

strapped onto your character to race

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.850 
strapped onto your character to race
with<00:01:51.299> and<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:51.930> controls<00:01:52.320> aren't<00:01:52.500> one<00:01:52.680> of<00:01:52.710> the

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
with and the controls aren't one of the

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.230 
with and the controls aren't one of the
biggest<00:01:53.220> surprises<00:01:53.579> that<00:01:53.880> caught<00:01:54.090> me

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
biggest surprises that caught me

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.630 
biggest surprises that caught me
off-guard<00:01:54.390> they<00:01:55.170> work<00:01:55.380> really<00:01:55.590> well<00:01:55.890> to<00:01:56.490> have

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
off-guard they work really well to have

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.980 
off-guard they work really well to have
your<00:01:56.759> character<00:01:57.090> speed<00:01:57.360> up<00:01:57.509> to<00:01:57.630> his<00:01:57.810> or<00:01:57.960> her

the controls can be annoying if your

to<00:02:22.260> know<00:02:22.410> who<00:02:22.560> invented<00:02:22.830> these<00:02:23.190> barrels

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
to know who invented these barrels

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.400 
to know who invented these barrels
seriously<00:02:24.420> you<00:02:24.690> have<00:02:24.720> rocket-propelled

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
seriously you have rocket-propelled

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.430 
seriously you have rocket-propelled
barrels<00:02:26.400> that<00:02:26.940> allow<00:02:27.270> you<00:02:27.330> to<00:02:27.480> fly<00:02:27.750> and<00:02:28.230> the

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
barrels that allow you to fly and the

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.200 
barrels that allow you to fly and the
way<00:02:28.590> to<00:02:28.650> interact<00:02:29.130> with<00:02:29.250> them<00:02:29.490> is<00:02:29.670> by<00:02:29.820> hitting

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
way to interact with them is by hitting

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.300 
way to interact with them is by hitting
them<00:02:30.480> other<00:02:31.170> important<00:02:31.740> things<00:02:31.890> don't<00:02:32.160> work

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
them other important things don't work

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:54.980 
them other important things don't work
like<00:02:32.430> that<00:02:53.090> we're<00:02:54.090> gonna<00:02:54.240> kill<00:02:54.450> out<00:02:54.600> there<00:02:54.750> I

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
like that we're gonna kill out there I

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:59.120 
like that we're gonna kill out there I
can't<00:02:55.800> do<00:02:55.950> it<00:02:56.450> now<00:02:57.450> using<00:02:57.960> here<00:02:58.230> you'll<00:02:58.680> go<00:02:58.950> out

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
can't do it now using here you'll go out

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.250 
can't do it now using here you'll go out
there<00:02:59.400> do<00:03:00.060> your<00:03:00.090> job<00:03:00.450> and<00:03:00.720> make<00:03:00.900> a<00:03:00.960> touchdown

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
there do your job and make a touchdown

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:08.660 
there do your job and make a touchdown
am<00:03:01.800> i<00:03:02.070> clear<00:03:02.490> yeah<00:03:05.120> okay<00:03:06.120> maybe<00:03:06.780> they<00:03:07.080> do<00:03:07.670> the

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
am i clear yeah okay maybe they do the

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.910 
am i clear yeah okay maybe they do the
graphics<00:03:09.090> are<00:03:09.240> not<00:03:09.360> the<00:03:09.570> best<00:03:09.810> Nintendo<00:03:10.410> did<00:03:10.890> a

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
graphics are not the best Nintendo did a

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.890 
graphics are not the best Nintendo did a
good<00:03:11.100> job<00:03:11.160> of<00:03:11.490> coloring<00:03:11.670> up<00:03:12.030> the<00:03:12.150> place<00:03:12.360> but<00:03:12.780> it

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
good job of coloring up the place but it

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.270 
good job of coloring up the place but it
seems<00:03:13.110> like<00:03:13.230> they<00:03:13.350> didn't<00:03:13.650> take<00:03:13.770> the<00:03:13.890> time<00:03:13.920> to

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
seems like they didn't take the time to

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.490 
seems like they didn't take the time to
put<00:03:14.460> too<00:03:14.610> much<00:03:14.730> detail<00:03:15.210> into<00:03:15.450> it<00:03:15.690> maybe<00:03:16.320> they

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
put too much detail into it maybe they

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.320 
put too much detail into it maybe they
were<00:03:16.620> rushing<00:03:17.010> it<00:03:17.130> the<00:03:17.550> graphics<00:03:17.970> look<00:03:18.090> better

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.330 
were rushing it the graphics look better

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.720 
were rushing it the graphics look better
than<00:03:18.570> the<00:03:18.660> Nintendo<00:03:19.110> 64<00:03:19.680> but<00:03:20.190> not<00:03:20.310> as<00:03:20.459> good<00:03:20.640> as

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
than the Nintendo 64 but not as good as

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.490 
than the Nintendo 64 but not as good as
the<00:03:20.850> GameCube<00:03:21.360> it's<00:03:21.840> like<00:03:22.020> it<00:03:22.140> was<00:03:22.260> meant<00:03:22.380> for

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
the GameCube it's like it was meant for

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.170 
the GameCube it's like it was meant for
a<00:03:22.620> console<00:03:23.070> in<00:03:23.280> between<00:03:23.640> those<00:03:23.790> two<00:03:24.030> the<00:03:24.720> n60<00:03:25.530> q

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:26.180 
a console in between those two the n60 q

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.990 
a console in between those two the n60 q
Wow<00:03:27.209> that<00:03:27.480> was<00:03:27.660> lame<00:03:28.130> the<00:03:29.130> sense<00:03:29.370> of<00:03:29.520> speed<00:03:29.850> in

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
Wow that was lame the sense of speed in

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.300 
Wow that was lame the sense of speed in
this<00:03:30.120> game<00:03:30.360> is<00:03:30.660> okay<00:03:31.170> not<00:03:31.680> the<00:03:31.860> greatest<00:03:32.220> but

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
this game is okay not the greatest but

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:33.949 
this game is okay not the greatest but
not<00:03:32.580> the<00:03:32.700> worst<00:03:32.910> I<00:03:33.209> think<00:03:33.570> they<00:03:33.660> could<00:03:33.870> have

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
not the worst I think they could have

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:36.020 
not the worst I think they could have
sped<00:03:34.230> it<00:03:34.350> up<00:03:34.410> just<00:03:34.680> a<00:03:34.800> bit<00:03:34.980> maybe<00:03:35.640> this<00:03:35.850> game

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
sped it up just a bit maybe this game

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.000 
sped it up just a bit maybe this game
was<00:03:36.239> intended<00:03:36.660> for<00:03:36.840> younger<00:03:37.050> audiences<00:03:37.140> so

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.010 
was intended for younger audiences so
