00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
and I guess I can see why they wouldn't

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.850

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
want it to get out there because you

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:23.410

00:02:35.619 --> 00:02:35.629 
to hide something where she is this big

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:37.839 
to hide something where she is this big
a<00:02:35.660> role<00:02:35.930> and<00:02:36.379> also<00:02:36.709> a<00:02:36.739> role<00:02:36.980> where<00:02:37.459> she<00:02:37.610> plays

00:02:37.839 --> 00:02:37.849 
a role and also a role where she plays

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:39.819 
a role and also a role where she plays
something<00:02:38.510> so<00:02:38.810> different<00:02:39.260> than<00:02:39.410> what<00:02:39.680> she

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:39.829 
something so different than what she

this<00:03:47.599> is<00:03:47.660> very<00:03:47.959> clearly<00:03:48.260> her<00:03:48.470> movie<00:03:48.799> it's

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
this is very clearly her movie it's

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:50.860 
this is very clearly her movie it's
being<00:03:49.519> released<00:03:49.910> because<00:03:50.090> of<00:03:50.299> the<00:03:50.480> intense

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
being released because of the intense

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:54.049 
interest in her and I think that while I

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:55.569 
interest in her and I think that while I
can<00:03:54.260> understand<00:03:54.709> her<00:03:54.829> not<00:03:54.980> wanting<00:03:55.220> it<00:03:55.310> to<00:03:55.459> be

00:03:55.569 --> 00:03:55.579 
can understand her not wanting it to be

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:57.280 
can understand her not wanting it to be
out<00:03:55.700> there<00:03:55.940> from<00:03:56.359> what<00:03:56.510> I'm<00:03:56.630> seeing<00:03:56.959> from<00:03:57.019> this

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:57.290 
out there from what I'm seeing from this

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.140 
out there from what I'm seeing from this
trailer<00:03:57.560> I<00:03:57.919> don't<00:03:58.519> think<00:03:58.669> she<00:03:58.790> should<00:03:58.939> be<00:03:58.969> that

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
trailer I don't think she should be that

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:00.670 
trailer I don't think she should be that
embarrassed<00:03:59.599> of<00:03:59.810> it<00:03:59.930> because<00:04:00.170> I<00:04:00.319> think<00:04:00.379> she's

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
embarrassed of it because I think she's

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.229 
embarrassed of it because I think she's
at<00:04:00.769> least<00:04:00.890> owning<00:04:01.400> it<00:04:01.549> she's<00:04:01.790> owning<00:04:02.030> how

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:02.239 
at least owning it she's owning how

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:03.540 
at least owning it she's owning how
horrible<00:04:02.719> this<00:04:02.840> care

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:03.550 
horrible this care

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:05.100 
horrible this care
and<00:04:03.790> she's<00:04:03.970> being<00:04:04.150> honest<00:04:04.540> about<00:04:04.660> it<00:04:04.840> and<00:04:05.080> I

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.110 
and she's being honest about it and I

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:06.750 
and she's being honest about it and I
think<00:04:05.200> that's<00:04:05.500> all<00:04:05.770> that<00:04:06.190> you<00:04:06.280> can<00:04:06.430> really<00:04:06.580> ask

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:06.760 
think that's all that you can really ask

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:09.690 
think that's all that you can really ask
and<00:04:07.180> hope<00:04:07.330> for<00:04:07.600> from<00:04:08.200> an<00:04:08.320> actor<00:04:08.620> so<00:04:09.490> I'm
