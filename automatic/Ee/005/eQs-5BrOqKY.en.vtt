it<00:02:09.479> would<00:02:09.569> sit<00:02:09.780> in<00:02:09.869> the<00:02:09.989> air<00:02:10.160> anywhere<00:02:11.160> near<00:02:11.520> as

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
it would sit in the air anywhere near as

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.210 
it would sit in the air anywhere near as
well<00:02:11.790> as<00:02:12.000> what<00:02:12.510> he<00:02:12.660> had<00:02:12.750> flown<00:02:12.959> in<00:02:13.170> the<00:02:13.230> 70s<00:02:13.650> and

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
well as what he had flown in the 70s and

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.580 
well as what he had flown in the 70s and
but<00:02:14.850> he<00:02:14.940> was<00:02:15.060> quite<00:02:15.240> surprised<00:02:15.660> the<00:02:15.990> stability

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
but he was quite surprised the stability

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.610 
but he was quite surprised the stability
of<00:02:16.620> the<00:02:16.800> aircraft<00:02:17.190> in<00:02:17.400> the<00:02:17.430> air<00:02:17.520> is<00:02:17.880> is<00:02:18.150> good

of the aircraft in the air is is good

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.300 
of the aircraft in the air is is good
we've<00:02:19.620> flown<00:02:19.830> through<00:02:20.040> some<00:02:20.190> rough

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310 
we've flown through some rough

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.910 
we've flown through some rough
conditions<00:02:20.850> and<00:02:21.090> really<00:02:21.750> it's<00:02:21.990> as<00:02:22.140> good<00:02:22.320> as<00:02:22.440> as

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:22.920 
conditions and really it's as good as as

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.680 
conditions and really it's as good as as
you'll<00:02:23.190> see<00:02:23.400> with<00:02:24.000> an<00:02:24.090> aircraft<00:02:24.510> that's

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
you'll see with an aircraft that's

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.050 
you'll see with an aircraft that's
heavier<00:02:25.040> the<00:02:26.040> flight<00:02:26.280> characteristics<00:02:27.000> of

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
heavier the flight characteristics of

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.510 
heavier the flight characteristics of
the<00:02:27.420> aircraft<00:02:27.650> are<00:02:28.650> one<00:02:28.980> of<00:02:29.070> things<00:02:29.190> that<00:02:29.250> I'm

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
the aircraft are one of things that I'm

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.390 
the aircraft are one of things that I'm
very<00:02:29.730> impressed<00:02:30.030> with<00:02:30.680> if<00:02:31.680> you<00:02:31.920> put<00:02:32.130> it<00:02:32.220> into<00:02:32.340> a

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
very impressed with if you put it into a

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.140 
very impressed with if you put it into a
stall<00:02:32.760> it'll<00:02:33.510> stall<00:02:33.750> at<00:02:33.900> about<00:02:34.110> 37<00:02:34.620> knots<00:02:35.150> you

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
stall it'll stall at about 37 knots you

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.730 
stall it'll stall at about 37 knots you
pull<00:02:36.330> the<00:02:36.420> stick<00:02:36.660> right<00:02:36.870> back<00:02:37.080> full<00:02:37.350> throttle

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
pull the stick right back full throttle

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:39.920 
pull the stick right back full throttle
right<00:02:37.890> back<00:02:38.190> and<00:02:38.610> even<00:02:39.210> then<00:02:39.360> it<00:02:39.510> won't<00:02:39.630> drop<00:02:39.870> a

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
right back and even then it won't drop a

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.840 
right back and even then it won't drop a
wing<00:02:40.170> it<00:02:40.320> will<00:02:40.410> only<00:02:40.650> only<00:02:40.950> descend<00:02:41.490> at<00:02:41.640> about

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
wing it will only only descend at about

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.120 
wing it will only only descend at about
five<00:02:42.090> hundred<00:02:42.390> feet<00:02:42.570> per<00:02:42.630> minute<00:02:42.990> and<00:02:43.890> I<00:02:43.950> think

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
five hundred feet per minute and I think

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.940 
five hundred feet per minute and I think
that's<00:02:44.280> a<00:02:44.370> good<00:02:44.550> safety<00:02:44.820> feature<00:02:45.209> because

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
that's a good safety feature because

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.260 
that's a good safety feature because
unlike<00:02:46.950> a<00:02:47.010> lot<00:02:47.280> of<00:02:47.310> other<00:02:47.430> aircraft<00:02:47.970> if<00:02:48.150> you

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:48.270 
unlike a lot of other aircraft if you

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:50.449 
unlike a lot of other aircraft if you
were<00:02:48.420> to<00:02:48.630> stall<00:02:49.110> it<00:02:49.230> I<00:02:49.320> suspect<00:02:49.770> on<00:02:49.980> base

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
were to stall it I suspect on base

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.250 
were to stall it I suspect on base
there's<00:02:51.240> a<00:02:51.330> fair<00:02:51.540> chance<00:02:51.570> that<00:02:52.020> you'll<00:02:52.140> be

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
there's a fair chance that you'll be

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.229 
there's a fair chance that you'll be
able<00:02:52.350> to<00:02:52.500> recover<00:02:53.220> from<00:02:53.340> this<00:02:53.520> aircraft<00:02:54.000> and

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
able to recover from this aircraft and

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:56.930 
able to recover from this aircraft and
get<00:02:54.720> your<00:02:54.870> airspeed<00:02:55.230> up<00:02:55.470> and<00:02:55.860> I<00:02:56.580> think<00:02:56.790> that's

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 
get your airspeed up and I think that's

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:57.380 
get your airspeed up and I think that's
good

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390 
good

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.380

a ground adjustable prop we've got a set

a ground adjustable prop we've got a set
reasonably<00:03:03.810> coarse<00:03:04.110> because<00:03:04.290> we've<00:03:04.530> got<00:03:04.770> the

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
reasonably coarse because we've got the

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.060 
reasonably coarse because we've got the

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
aircraft for a touring aircraft we see

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.370 
aircraft for a touring aircraft we see
that<00:03:08.280> climb<00:03:08.550> performance<00:03:08.730> is<00:03:09.270> about<00:03:09.360> 500<00:03:10.290> and

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
that climb performance is about 500 and

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:12.050 
that climb performance is about 500 and
600<00:03:10.770> feet<00:03:10.830> per<00:03:11.190> minute<00:03:11.459> we<00:03:11.550> don't<00:03:11.730> try<00:03:11.940> and

600 feet per minute we don't try and

600 feet per minute we don't try and

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
climb up too steep but I think for a

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:15.680 
climb up too steep but I think for a
fly-in<00:03:14.489> school<00:03:14.820> you'd<00:03:15.000> probably<00:03:15.180> find<00:03:15.570> that

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
fly-in school you'd probably find that

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.000 
fly-in school you'd probably find that
up<00:03:15.870> a<00:03:15.959> little<00:03:16.110> bit<00:03:16.290> and<00:03:16.530> you'd<00:03:16.650> get<00:03:16.860> you<00:03:16.980> a

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
up a little bit and you'd get you a

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:18.289 
up a little bit and you'd get you a
thousand<00:03:17.430> feet<00:03:17.550> per<00:03:17.790> minute<00:03:17.910> quite

thousand feet per minute quite

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:20.810 
thousand feet per minute quite
comfortably<00:03:19.220> one<00:03:20.220> of<00:03:20.310> the<00:03:20.370> things<00:03:20.670> that's

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
comfortably one of the things that's

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:24.289 
comfortably one of the things that's

now<00:03:27.120> it's<00:03:27.299> getting<00:03:27.540> less<00:03:27.690> and<00:03:27.750> less<00:03:27.959> likely

basic - put in hours but you can of

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:02.449 
basic - put in hours but you can of
course<00:04:00.299> get<00:04:00.690> your<00:04:00.930> your<00:04:01.500> glass<00:04:01.739> cockpits<00:04:02.310> if

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
course get your your glass cockpits if

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:04.039 
course get your your glass cockpits if
you<00:04:02.549> want<00:04:02.700> to<00:04:02.760> go<00:04:02.910> that<00:04:03.060> way<00:04:03.120> and<00:04:03.870> it<00:04:03.959> all

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.049 
you want to go that way and it all

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:07.580 
you want to go that way and it all
depends<00:04:04.410> how<00:04:04.830> much<00:04:04.980> you<00:04:05.040> want<00:04:05.280> to<00:04:05.340> pay<00:04:05.549> I<00:04:06.590> think

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
depends how much you want to pay I think

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.009 
depends how much you want to pay I think
what's<00:04:07.739> being<00:04:08.010> interesting<00:04:08.489> with<00:04:08.690> the<00:04:09.690> moving

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.019 
what's being interesting with the moving

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:11.810 
what's being interesting with the moving
the<00:04:10.049> recreational<00:04:10.829> aviation<00:04:11.340> is<00:04:11.489> that<00:04:11.640> a<00:04:11.670> lot

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:11.820 
the recreational aviation is that a lot

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.490 
the recreational aviation is that a lot
of<00:04:11.850> people<00:04:12.150> are<00:04:12.239> moving<00:04:12.360> out<00:04:12.630> of<00:04:12.660> GA<00:04:12.989> because

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
of people are moving out of GA because

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.560 
of people are moving out of GA because
of<00:04:13.620> the<00:04:13.709> expense<00:04:14.070> of<00:04:14.130> it<00:04:14.280> into<00:04:14.910> our<00:04:15.150> AAA

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:15.570 
of the expense of it into our AAA

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:17.090 
of the expense of it into our AAA
and<00:04:16.290> I<00:04:16.350> think<00:04:16.620> one<00:04:16.709> of<00:04:16.739> the<00:04:16.859> things<00:04:16.979> that's

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
and I think one of the things that's

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:19.069 
and I think one of the things that's
unique<00:04:17.430> about<00:04:17.669> these<00:04:18.030> aircraft<00:04:18.570> is<00:04:18.720> they<00:04:18.840> very

00:04:19.069 --> 00:04:19.079 
unique about these aircraft is they very

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:21.620 
unique about these aircraft is they very
much<00:04:19.140> got<00:04:19.530> a<00:04:19.560> GA<00:04:19.859> feel<00:04:20.340> I've<00:04:21.180> got<00:04:21.329> the<00:04:21.419> toe

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:21.630 
much got a GA feel I've got the toe

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:25.300 
much got a GA feel I've got the toe
brakes<00:04:21.930> as<00:04:22.140> standard<00:04:22.729> and<00:04:23.729> also<00:04:23.940> now<00:04:24.840> they're

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310 
brakes as standard and also now they're

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:27.500 
brakes as standard and also now they're
developing<00:04:26.310> putting<00:04:26.580> the<00:04:26.640> lycoming<00:04:27.210> engine

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
developing putting the lycoming engine

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:28.970 
developing putting the lycoming engine
and<00:04:27.870> although<00:04:28.020> although<00:04:28.470> there's<00:04:28.680> not<00:04:28.770> one

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:28.980 
and although although there's not one

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:31.250 
and although although there's not one
flying<00:04:29.310> with<00:04:29.520> the<00:04:29.610> lycoming<00:04:30.180> at<00:04:30.840> the<00:04:30.930> time<00:04:31.110> of

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
flying with the lycoming at the time of

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:33.080 
flying with the lycoming at the time of
doing<00:04:31.380> this<00:04:31.620> filming<00:04:32.070> it'll<00:04:32.910> be<00:04:32.970> very

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
doing this filming it'll be very

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:34.910 
doing this filming it'll be very
interesting<00:04:33.210> to<00:04:33.540> see<00:04:33.690> how<00:04:33.960> how<00:04:34.350> that<00:04:34.530> aircraft

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:34.920 
interesting to see how how that aircraft

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.520 
interesting to see how how that aircraft
performs<00:04:35.370> it'll<00:04:35.610> be<00:04:35.700> more<00:04:35.910> horsepower<00:04:36.530> but

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
performs it'll be more horsepower but

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:39.410 
performs it'll be more horsepower but
certainly<00:04:38.040> if<00:04:38.190> you're<00:04:38.310> someone<00:04:38.700> that<00:04:38.730> is<00:04:39.150> used

00:04:39.410 --> 00:04:39.420 
certainly if you're someone that is used

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:41.810 
certainly if you're someone that is used
to<00:04:39.540> a<00:04:39.570> GA<00:04:39.840> feel<00:04:40.230> wants<00:04:41.010> a<00:04:41.070> robust<00:04:41.460> solid

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:41.820 
to a GA feel wants a robust solid

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:44.480 
to a GA feel wants a robust solid
aircraft<00:04:42.420> this<00:04:43.290> is<00:04:43.470> an<00:04:43.650> aircraft<00:04:43.950> you<00:04:44.250> should

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:44.490 
aircraft this is an aircraft you should

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:47.000 
aircraft this is an aircraft you should
consider<00:04:45.110> so<00:04:46.110> here<00:04:46.260> we<00:04:46.350> are<00:04:46.380> looking<00:04:46.680> at<00:04:46.800> the

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.010 
consider so here we are looking at the

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:48.860 
consider so here we are looking at the
the<00:04:47.310> cockpit<00:04:47.700> of<00:04:47.820> the<00:04:47.880> aircraft<00:04:48.360> and<00:04:48.660> you<00:04:48.750> can

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
the cockpit of the aircraft and you can

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.920 
the cockpit of the aircraft and you can
have<00:04:49.020> a<00:04:49.050> variety<00:04:49.260> of<00:04:49.650> dashes<00:04:50.630> but<00:04:51.630> this<00:04:51.780> has

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:51.930 
have a variety of dashes but this has

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:54.410 
have a variety of dashes but this has
got<00:04:52.080> the<00:04:52.170> glass<00:04:52.380> cockpit<00:04:52.980> as<00:04:53.910> well<00:04:54.090> as<00:04:54.210> some

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:54.420 
got the glass cockpit as well as some

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:57.380 
got the glass cockpit as well as some
standard<00:04:55.170> round<00:04:55.320> instruments<00:04:56.090> it's<00:04:57.090> got<00:04:57.270> it

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:57.390 
standard round instruments it's got it

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:59.960 
standard round instruments it's got it
very<00:04:57.480> much<00:04:57.750> a<00:04:57.780> ga<00:04:58.440> trim<00:04:58.950> wheel<00:04:59.160> which<00:04:59.580> I<00:04:59.760> think

00:04:59.960 --> 00:04:59.970 
very much a ga trim wheel which I think

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:03.020 
very much a ga trim wheel which I think
most<00:05:00.840> far<00:05:01.080> most<00:05:01.560> aircraft<00:05:02.130> people<00:05:02.730> will<00:05:02.880> be

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030 
most far most aircraft people will be

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:05.960 
most far most aircraft people will be
very<00:05:03.240> happy<00:05:03.840> with<00:05:04.140> very<00:05:04.170> easy<00:05:04.710> to<00:05:05.460> adjust

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970 
very happy with very easy to adjust

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:08.540 
very happy with very easy to adjust
it's<00:05:06.420> got<00:05:06.570> good<00:05:06.780> solid<00:05:07.050> runners<00:05:07.530> on<00:05:07.710> a<00:05:07.740> seat<00:05:08.070> so

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:08.550 
it's got good solid runners on a seat so

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:11.960 
it's got good solid runners on a seat so
the<00:05:08.580> adjustable<00:05:09.240> seats<00:05:09.540> and<00:05:10.250> and<00:05:11.250> you'll<00:05:11.760> see

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:11.970 
the adjustable seats and and you'll see

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:13.820 
the adjustable seats and and you'll see
if<00:05:12.090> you<00:05:12.150> look<00:05:12.180> at<00:05:12.450> the<00:05:12.630> the<00:05:13.290> edging<00:05:13.620> on<00:05:13.710> the

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:13.830 
if you look at the the edging on the

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:15.230 
if you look at the the edging on the
doors<00:05:14.070> they're<00:05:14.310> very<00:05:14.490> well<00:05:14.700> finished<00:05:15.060> they

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
doors they're very well finished they

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.630 
doors they're very well finished they
seal<00:05:15.450> very<00:05:15.810> well<00:05:16.110> which<00:05:16.950> is<00:05:16.980> important<00:05:17.520> if

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:17.640 
seal very well which is important if

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:20.780 
seal very well which is important if
you're<00:05:17.760> going<00:05:18.060> through<00:05:18.360> cold<00:05:19.110> conditions<00:05:19.790> my

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:37.200 
always got the luxury of having a hangar

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:40.190 
always got the luxury of having a hangar
to<00:05:37.860> put<00:05:38.430> it<00:05:38.520> in<00:05:38.640> and<00:05:38.820> being<00:05:39.450> a<00:05:39.540> full<00:05:39.720> aluminium

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:40.200 
to put it in and being a full aluminium

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:41.860 
to put it in and being a full aluminium
build<00:05:40.380> aircraft<00:05:40.860> they<00:05:41.010> can<00:05:41.280> sit<00:05:41.550> outside

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:41.870 
build aircraft they can sit outside

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:45.200 
build aircraft they can sit outside
although<00:05:42.870> that's<00:05:42.990> never<00:05:43.230> I'd<00:05:43.740> any<00:05:43.980> ideal<00:05:44.490> but

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:45.210 
although that's never I'd any ideal but

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:46.580 
although that's never I'd any ideal but
one<00:05:45.390> of<00:05:45.420> the<00:05:45.540> things<00:05:45.720> that's<00:05:45.840> good<00:05:46.260> about<00:05:46.380> this

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:46.590 
one of the things that's good about this

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:48.980 
one of the things that's good about this
is<00:05:46.650> the<00:05:46.950> high<00:05:47.130> rise<00:05:47.430> fuel<00:05:47.880> cap<00:05:48.120> if<00:05:48.420> they<00:05:48.840> are

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:48.990 
is the high rise fuel cap if they are

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:50.630 
is the high rise fuel cap if they are
seeing<00:05:49.260> outside<00:05:49.440> or<00:05:49.830> they<00:05:49.920> are<00:05:50.130> in<00:05:50.340> the<00:05:50.430> rain

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:50.640 
seeing outside or they are in the rain

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:51.980 
seeing outside or they are in the rain
you're<00:05:50.940> not<00:05:51.090> going<00:05:51.270> to<00:05:51.360> get<00:05:51.450> water<00:05:51.720> in<00:05:51.870> there

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:51.990 
you're not going to get water in there

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:53.960 
you're not going to get water in there
with<00:05:52.080> your<00:05:52.200> fuel<00:05:52.470> and<00:05:52.760> that's<00:05:53.760> a<00:05:53.850> very

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:53.970 
with your fuel and that's a very

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:57.530 
with your fuel and that's a very
important<00:05:54.450> characteristic<00:05:54.840> for<00:05:55.620> safety<00:05:56.540> the

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:57.540 
important characteristic for safety the

00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:59.990 
important characteristic for safety the
Brumbies<00:05:57.750> 610<00:05:58.440> high<00:05:58.740> wing<00:05:58.980> has<00:05:59.280> electric

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:00.000 
Brumbies 610 high wing has electric

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.240 
Brumbies 610 high wing has electric
flaps<00:06:00.240> which<00:06:01.200> is<00:06:01.350> very<00:06:01.590> good<00:06:01.830> that<00:06:01.980> they've

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:02.250 
flaps which is very good that they've

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:05.660 
flaps which is very good that they've
got<00:06:02.490> very<00:06:03.180> good<00:06:03.890> stability<00:06:04.890> when<00:06:05.400> they're<00:06:05.550> at

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:05.670 
got very good stability when they're at

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:07.970 
got very good stability when they're at
full<00:06:05.880> flap<00:06:06.240> and<00:06:06.630> if<00:06:07.110> you<00:06:07.200> are<00:06:07.350> laying<00:06:07.590> on<00:06:07.770> dirt

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:07.980 
full flap and if you are laying on dirt

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:09.800 
full flap and if you are laying on dirt
strips<00:06:08.340> you<00:06:08.490> can<00:06:08.670> you<00:06:09.270> can<00:06:09.390> pull<00:06:09.570> up<00:06:09.600> the

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:09.810 
strips you can you can pull up the

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:11.510 
strips you can you can pull up the
aircraft<00:06:10.170> very<00:06:10.410> quick<00:06:10.830> because<00:06:11.130> that<00:06:11.250> puts<00:06:11.460> a

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.520 
aircraft very quick because that puts a

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:14.060 
aircraft very quick because that puts a
lot<00:06:11.670> of<00:06:11.700> drag<00:06:12.060> on<00:06:12.380> the<00:06:13.380> other<00:06:13.530> advantage<00:06:14.010> of

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:14.070 
lot of drag on the other advantage of

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:15.980 
lot of drag on the other advantage of
these<00:06:14.220> flaps<00:06:14.580> is<00:06:14.790> at<00:06:14.910> 80<00:06:15.120> knots<00:06:15.240> you<00:06:15.600> can<00:06:15.750> start

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:15.990 
these flaps is at 80 knots you can start

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:17.660 
these flaps is at 80 knots you can start
to<00:06:16.110> run<00:06:16.290> them<00:06:16.470> down<00:06:16.500> which<00:06:17.370> is<00:06:17.460> a<00:06:17.490> bit<00:06:17.640> more

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:17.670 
to run them down which is a bit more

00:06:17.670 --> 00:06:20.990 
to run them down which is a bit more
like<00:06:18.030> a<00:06:18.540> robust<00:06:19.170> GI<00:06:19.410> aircraft<00:06:20.010> rather<00:06:20.790> than

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:21.000 
like a robust GI aircraft rather than

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:23.210 
like a robust GI aircraft rather than
some<00:06:21.180> of<00:06:21.300> the<00:06:21.420> the<00:06:22.140> light<00:06:22.350> planes<00:06:22.770> that<00:06:22.920> we<00:06:23.040> see

00:06:23.210 --> 00:06:23.220 
some of the the light planes that we see

00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:24.530 
some of the the light planes that we see
in<00:06:23.340> the<00:06:23.400> marketplace<00:06:23.760> today<00:06:24.090> that<00:06:24.420> really

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:24.540 
in the marketplace today that really

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:26.540 
in the marketplace today that really
have<00:06:24.810> got<00:06:24.960> to<00:06:25.050> be<00:06:25.110> going<00:06:25.380> very<00:06:25.410> slow<00:06:25.920> before

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:26.550 
have got to be going very slow before

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:29.330 
have got to be going very slow before
you<00:06:26.760> can<00:06:26.880> put<00:06:27.030> the<00:06:27.120> flaps<00:06:27.330> down<00:06:27.710> on<00:06:28.710> the<00:06:28.920> Brumby

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:29.340 
you can put the flaps down on the Brumby

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:33.410 
you can put the flaps down on the Brumby

the steering with the toe brakes it

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:39.080 
the steering with the toe brakes it
doesn't<00:06:37.980> take<00:06:38.100> very<00:06:38.130> long<00:06:38.430> to<00:06:38.700> get<00:06:38.820> used<00:06:39.000> to

doesn't take very long to get used to
doing<00:06:39.150> that<00:06:39.510> you<00:06:40.170> have<00:06:40.410> a<00:06:40.440> choice<00:06:40.710> of<00:06:40.950> tires

doing that you have a choice of tires

00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:43.339 
doing that you have a choice of tires
depending<00:06:41.940> on<00:06:42.060> whether<00:06:42.780> you're<00:06:42.960> landing<00:06:43.139> on

00:06:47.659 --> 00:06:47.669 
on dirt strips but the thing that I'm

00:06:47.669 --> 00:06:49.040 
on dirt strips but the thing that I'm
really<00:06:47.940> impressed<00:06:48.240> about<00:06:48.569> if<00:06:48.750> you<00:06:48.870> have<00:06:49.020> a
