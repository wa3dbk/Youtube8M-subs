apprehend the driver for interrogation

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:23.599 
apprehend the driver for interrogation
basically<00:00:21.720> this<00:00:22.199> level<00:00:22.560> is<00:00:22.650> a<00:00:22.740> boss<00:00:22.920> fight<00:00:23.310> but

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
basically this level is a boss fight but

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.179 
basically this level is a boss fight but
car<00:00:24.119> transporter<00:00:24.750> has<00:00:24.900> four<00:00:25.230> tires<00:00:25.529> and<00:00:26.070> you

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
car transporter has four tires and you

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.140 
car transporter has four tires and you
have<00:00:26.279> to<00:00:26.430> melt<00:00:26.580> them<00:00:26.789> all

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
have to melt them all

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.689 
have to melt them all
it<00:00:27.570> sounds<00:00:28.050> pretty<00:00:28.260> straightforward<00:00:28.650> but<00:00:29.580> the

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
it sounds pretty straightforward but the

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.009 
it sounds pretty straightforward but the
devil<00:00:29.970> is<00:00:30.090> in<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.330> details

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019

your main opponent in this mission is

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.299 
your main opponent in this mission is
the<00:00:33.000> clock<00:00:33.420> like<00:00:34.170> I<00:00:34.320> said<00:00:34.500> in<00:00:34.590> the<00:00:34.680> intro<00:00:34.980> video

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
the clock like I said in the intro video

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.880 
the clock like I said in the intro video
you<00:00:35.730> have<00:00:35.880> to<00:00:36.000> get<00:00:36.149> an<00:00:36.239> 80%<00:00:36.480> score<00:00:37.170> to<00:00:37.260> pass<00:00:37.530> and

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
you have to get an 80% score to pass and

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.250 
you have to get an 80% score to pass and
your<00:00:38.160> mission<00:00:38.340> time<00:00:38.730> affects<00:00:39.300> half<00:00:39.690> of<00:00:40.050> that

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
your mission time affects half of that

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.770 
your mission time affects half of that
score<00:00:40.640> if<00:00:41.640> you<00:00:41.850> want<00:00:42.059> to<00:00:42.149> get<00:00:42.300> a<00:00:42.329> good<00:00:42.540> enough

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
score if you want to get a good enough

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.750 
score if you want to get a good enough
score<00:00:43.079> from<00:00:43.260> time<00:00:43.559> then<00:00:44.070> you<00:00:44.219> should<00:00:44.250> aim<00:00:44.579> to

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
score from time then you should aim to

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.790 
score from time then you should aim to
complete<00:00:45.030> this<00:00:45.270> mission<00:00:45.329> in<00:00:45.840> around<00:00:46.260> 2

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
complete this mission in around 2

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.540 
complete this mission in around 2
minutes<00:00:47.219> I<00:00:48.440> prefer<00:00:49.440> to<00:00:49.590> focus<00:00:49.800> on<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.250> tires

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
minutes I prefer to focus on the tires

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.299 
minutes I prefer to focus on the tires
on<00:00:50.910> the<00:00:51.059> right<00:00:51.239> side<00:00:51.600> of<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.780> truck<00:00:52.020> first<00:00:52.440> the

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
on the right side of the truck first the

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.340 
on the right side of the truck first the
reason<00:00:53.640> is<00:00:53.789> because<00:00:53.940> you<00:00:54.719> have<00:00:54.899> to<00:00:55.020> look<00:00:55.199> out

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
reason is because you have to look out

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.020 
reason is because you have to look out
for<00:00:55.379> off<00:00:55.680> ramps<00:00:56.070> on<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.280> right<00:00:56.489> side<00:00:56.789> of<00:00:56.940> the

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
for off ramps on the right side of the

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.360 
for off ramps on the right side of the
road<00:00:57.239> if<00:00:57.989> you<00:00:58.109> don't<00:00:58.320> pay<00:00:58.440> attention<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:59.129> when

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
road if you don't pay attention to when

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.069 
road if you don't pay attention to when
the<00:00:59.520> ramps<00:00:59.820> are<00:00:59.910> coming<00:01:00.180> up<00:01:00.329> you'll<00:01:00.629> run<00:01:00.870> right

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
the ramps are coming up you'll run right

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.529 
the ramps are coming up you'll run right
into<00:01:01.230> the<00:01:01.350> highway<00:01:01.649> divider<00:01:02.039> so<00:01:02.940> when<00:01:03.359> you<00:01:03.420> see

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
into the highway divider so when you see

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.329 
into the highway divider so when you see
an<00:01:03.600> off-ramp<00:01:03.870> coming<00:01:04.290> up<00:01:04.470> get<00:01:04.799> ready<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.129> drive

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
an off-ramp coming up get ready to drive

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.920 
an off-ramp coming up get ready to drive
down<00:01:05.640> it<00:01:05.820> and<00:01:06.030> then<00:01:06.119> come<00:01:06.479> back<00:01:06.630> up<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.900> other

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
down it and then come back up the other

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.340 
down it and then come back up the other
side<00:01:07.110> like<00:01:07.590> you<00:01:07.770> see<00:01:07.979> here<00:01:08.840> so<00:01:09.840> by<00:01:09.990> doing<00:01:10.049> the

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
side like you see here so by doing the

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.170 
side like you see here so by doing the
right<00:01:10.530> side<00:01:10.799> first<00:01:11.100> you<00:01:11.549> get<00:01:11.729> this<00:01:11.880> extra

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
right side first you get this extra

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.969 
right side first you get this extra
danger<00:01:12.689> out<00:01:12.900> of<00:01:13.049> the<00:01:13.140> way<00:01:13.260> early<00:01:13.530> in<00:01:13.770> the

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
danger out of the way early in the

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.670 
danger out of the way early in the
mission

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.980 

aside<00:01:18.430> from<00:01:18.580> the<00:01:18.730> clock<00:01:19.060> your<00:01:19.450> other<00:01:19.630> biggest

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
aside from the clock your other biggest

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.860 
aside from the clock your other biggest
obstacle<00:01:20.620> is<00:01:20.770> the<00:01:20.800> traffic<00:01:21.250> about<00:01:22.210> every<00:01:22.630> 10

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:22.870 
obstacle is the traffic about every 10

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.020 
obstacle is the traffic about every 10
to<00:01:22.900> 20<00:01:23.350> seconds<00:01:23.770> the<00:01:23.980> transporter<00:01:24.610> will<00:01:24.760> drive

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
to 20 seconds the transporter will drive

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.640 
to 20 seconds the transporter will drive
between<00:01:25.240> two<00:01:25.720> sets<00:01:26.050> of<00:01:26.200> cars

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:26.650 
between two sets of cars

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.800 
between two sets of cars
thus<00:01:27.400> you<00:01:27.730> won't<00:01:27.880> be<00:01:28.000> able<00:01:28.060> to<00:01:28.210> get<00:01:28.330> close<00:01:28.600> to

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:28.810 
thus you won't be able to get close to

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.900 
thus you won't be able to get close to
the<00:01:28.930> transporter<00:01:29.560> during<00:01:29.830> this<00:01:29.950> time<00:01:30.220> there

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:30.910 
the transporter during this time there

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:32.760 
the transporter during this time there
really<00:01:30.940> isn't<00:01:31.360> much<00:01:31.510> you<00:01:31.780> can<00:01:31.960> do<00:01:32.140> except<00:01:32.560> wait

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
really isn't much you can do except wait

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.670 
really isn't much you can do except wait
it<00:01:32.950> out<00:01:33.070> in<00:01:33.400> the<00:01:34.090> meantime<00:01:34.360> do<00:01:35.110> your<00:01:35.290> best<00:01:35.500> to

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:35.680 
it out in the meantime do your best to

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.440 
it out in the meantime do your best to
match<00:01:35.890> the<00:01:36.130> transporters<00:01:36.760> speed<00:01:37.030> and<00:01:37.240> stay

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
match the transporters speed and stay

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.300 
match the transporters speed and stay
