00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:12.360
 Hello, Sir, Modest Tastes from the kitchen 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.920
 in this section we have a beautiful cake recipe 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.080
 lonely 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.880
 but let's take a look at the list of materials before making 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.720
 1 cup powdered sugar 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.560
 1 piece of ripe pear 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.840
 1 cup water 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.400
 1 tea cup sunflower oil 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.160
 1 packet of baking powder 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.880
 1 packet of vanilla 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.120
 2 cups flour 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.760
 making a ripe pear of vegetarian cake ... 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:04.600
 It's important to be mature, even began to rot ... 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.840
 we start by peeling 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.840
 we can use bananas 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.040
 long enough 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.440
 we stripped nicely, now we grate with the fine edge of our grater 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.680
 grate 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.360
 in a sense, it becomes the egg of our cake 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.240
 Add 1 cup powdered sugar 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.720
 We're just a 3 to 4 minute mixer. 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.320
 so much 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.320
 Now we have 1 cup of water ... 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.680
 and we add sunflower oil up to 1 tea cup 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.960
 we are mixing too briefly 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:14.840
 we add flour 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.040
 baking soda ... 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.320
 and adding vanilla 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.520
 and mix until it's integrated 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
 now we have finished mixing 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.960
 oil and flour 

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.960
 now we are pouring into our mold 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.920
 extremely easy and healthy recipe 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.480
 we're now scrambling to a 170 degree warm oven 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
 1 hour later 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
 our cake is out of the oven 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.880
 as you can see 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.840
 so you don't need a lot of eggs to fluff 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.840
 even no eggs 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.840
 let's reverse now 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:29.000
 as you can see, we have a very regular cake 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.800
 Modest Flavors in this part of the kitchen ... 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.800
 making it quite easy and we shared a different recipe 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.800
 Vegetarian Cake 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.640
 you ask us to try and remember us as soon as possible 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.520
 Goodbye sir ...
