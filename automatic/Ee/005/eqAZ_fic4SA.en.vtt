00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:07.089
 accompanies me and we continue traveling this 

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:07.089
 27 Aug Hall of Saint Paul 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.420
 those who combed gray hair we remember 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.849
 surely three vehicles 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:18.970
 speeds should come a box of 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:22.180
 four marches five six seven eight 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:24.220
 etcetera what is this passion for 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.349
 go adding changes is due to the 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.060
 continuity in management and it should be 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:31.359
 also to the change of mentality in the 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:33.430
 engines imagines climbing a 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:35.290
 ladder today climbing steps that the 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.839
 clock that makes a box move from the 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.940
 condition of maximum torque on the wheel to 

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:42.100
 the condition of maximum speed when 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:45.159
 you are going through changes is 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.019
 going down steps now he imagines that 

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:49.000
 instead of going through steps 

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:51.519
 you went up a ramp 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.650
 continue to go beyond that condition of 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:55.540
 maximum gives on the wheel to maximum 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.790
 speed in absolutely form 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:01.659
 continuous the nissan has a system 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:04.869
 continuous cbt flame variable 

00:01:01.659 --> 00:01:07.960
 transmission that is I would say the box of 

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:10.930
 Perfect or ideal speeds because no 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.549
 there are those change jumps in return not 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.400
 there is a first one a second one 

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:17.800
 third is not changing continuously 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.530
 goes looking for the ideal condition of the engine 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:23.530
 and it is realizing that torque needs 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:26.230
 and through a very ingenious system 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.750
 of pulleys in which one goes 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:30.760
 shrinking and the other is enlarging is 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.910
 a system that I have here that I'm 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:36.070
 showing in which there is a pulley 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:39.490
 driven on the driving pulley in this 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:41.260
 look, this is small, this is 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.480
 big if a condition is working 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:46.090
 of force but notice that it is changing 

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:48.250
 it's shrinking and this one is 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.560
 Exactly enlarging is working 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:53.140
 On the contrary, it is in the condition of 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:55.270
 correct speed is getting bigger and 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.100
 It is making it spin faster 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.619
 this is for high speed that is 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.920
 I can do that is keeping your 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:05.200
 speed make it vary in high 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.540
 speed or low speed plus torque or 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.160
 less torque if I added the 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.200
 flexibility that this has is typical of 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.790
 any engine here I have the amount of 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.760
 changes that I feel like it, that is to say 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.230
 this behaves like a box of 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.300
 infinite changes and creates mentioned 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:22.540
 He insured to handle it is infinite pleasure 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:24.549
 well that translates this technology 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.579
 only softness, no, of course 

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:29.980
 that this does not translate into lower consumption 

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:32.469
 obviously less contaminations 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.599
 answer much faster because you're 

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:35.920
 always looking for the ideal condition and 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:38.019
 also through another system 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.970
 electronic allows you to choose three 

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:42.489
 driving conditions driving 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.470
 extremely economical handling 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:47.379
 conventional normal and driving 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:50.019
 sports is to say a sum of functions 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:51.639
 through this system as old as 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:53.500
 the man because in the end this does not 

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:56.280
 is neither more nor less than a transmission to 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.280
 through pulleys 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.510
 two
