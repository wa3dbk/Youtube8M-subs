00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
 good evening to all we find ourselves 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.670
 for a super giant barbecue 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:08.060
 it's gone alain michel is farting the 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.060
 sauce that 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.920
 welcome so in this new video 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:20.320
 in which we will see how to give 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:23.650
 a small side to us very nice to 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:26.890
 our hand then to ios is in some 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.810
 so the equivalent of bone x for those 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.910
 so called the idevice so basically 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:34.800
 ugly have something so for example 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:38.980
 iphone ipad and ipod touch 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.570
 here and this famous eyeos has a 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.880
 pretty interesting function to know the 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.860
 multitasking and as a picture is better 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:53.440
 that a long speech 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:57.670
 demonstration so that's it that's what 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:01:01.230
 it looks on ios and on mac it gives that 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.859
 ouroux really serves I love a lot 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:04.480
 small focus 

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:06.280
 it seems obvious to me that this kind of 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.230
 multitasking actually has no interest on 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.760
 mac since the application management 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.260
 open is much simpler than 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.409
 on a mobile is it enough for you 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.820
 to go play in the dock but hey 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:18.430
 still allows to give a small 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.920
 style how would I say no 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.890
 quiet yourself you know how to be careful 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:25.590
 recovery of the trick 3 4 is happening 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.240
 now in the thick of it 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.430
 how are we doing this then it's 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.920
 very simple as often you go 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:35.650
 download the small zip file that gets 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.850
 find or in the description the video 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.250
 that's fine I see who has two who 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.960
 follow it in the file 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.800
 zip zips and that is no longer a 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:46.260
 zip file but a folder 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:49.590
 you will find the installer of 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:52.080
 the application of ascq borte which is because 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.110
 that good rhythm and son is who is 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.010
 currently still in beta and that will 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.140
 allow you to do that which you 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:00.260
 go find a chair noise 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.790
 you will find inside 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.110
 the installer of the application and you 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.810
 go to install it down you know to little 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.640
 by how does it work now when 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.830
 the application is installed bah it goes 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.690
 just have to start it or not 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.230
 sometimes she goes straight after 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.120
 Installation 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:19.320
 but if it is not the case, we launch it 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.950
 and there you alain we have the the dashboard nothing 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.800
 to see 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.900
 the multitasking that appears and that we can 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.920
 to reappear by sliding five 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.780
 fingers up 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.600
 and that's so it's particularly 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.550
 awesome and it works totally like 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:36.120
 the multitasking of ios 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.890
 it's pretty cool and either go for 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.050
 able to quibble at the settings then there 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.130
 it must be known is there and everything 

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:42.900
 the interest of having watched the video 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:45.030
 to the end you have to go to 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:49.020
 settings and you will see that we have a 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:51.540
 new small section is called 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:53.010
 task board which is so the application I 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.930
 remember that we used then 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:56.690
 could do a vertical flip and so 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.920
 it 'll give you that in fact rather than 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.290
 what I showed you at 2 minutes 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.330
 worry then that I will leave you 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.360
 test at home can put some 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:09.000
 shortcuts and then to use the 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.310
 shortcut you have to activate them here you 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.750
 can use the multi touch 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.060
 so that's what we use to 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.470
 do that so it's really very 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.780
 interesting if we used this kind of 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.070
 stuff you can decide to throw 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.720
 the app when you launch 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.170
 the computer and finally you can 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.380
 to leave 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:27.360
 you have board here it's already the end of the 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.650
 video do not hesitate to find the background 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:30.900
 in the zip file that you 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:33.060
 download in the description the video 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.310
 that's fine you are 5 7 times and before 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.890
 to finish a big thank you to play jol 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.570
 67 who did the little demo of 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.470
 multitasking especially for this video 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:42.090
 it's super fun 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.739

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.800
