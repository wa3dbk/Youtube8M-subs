you see the mechanism on the top dome in

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.340 
you see the mechanism on the top dome in
a<00:01:46.590> little<00:01:46.890> bit<00:01:47.040> when<00:01:48.290> you<00:01:49.290> push<00:01:49.890> in<00:01:50.659> it<00:01:51.659> works<00:01:51.960> a

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
a little bit when you push in it works a

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
certain certain segments of the cam when

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:03.830 
certain certain segments of the cam when
you<00:01:58.229> pull<00:01:59.270> when<00:02:00.270> you<00:02:00.390> pull<00:02:00.630> this<00:02:00.780> out<00:02:02.420> see<00:02:03.420> you

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
you pull when you pull this out see you

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.370 
you pull when you pull this out see you
get<00:02:04.049> different<00:02:04.909> configurations<00:02:05.909> of<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.180> camp

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
get different configurations of the camp

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:15.000 
get different configurations of the camp
right<00:02:09.509> so<00:02:12.360> my<00:02:13.360> ankle<00:02:13.750> I<00:02:13.870> also<00:02:14.140> had<00:02:14.440> a<00:02:14.470> free<00:02:14.830> up

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
right so my ankle I also had a free up

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.870 
right so my ankle I also had a free up
the<00:02:15.730> vertical<00:02:16.030> shift<00:02:16.630> that<00:02:17.590> runs<00:02:18.210> up<00:02:19.210> and<00:02:19.480> down

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
the vertical shift that runs up and down

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:31.430 
the vertical shift that runs up and down
let's<00:02:21.880> see<00:02:22.150> if<00:02:22.270> you<00:02:22.420> could<00:02:22.570> see<00:02:23.100> the<00:02:24.100> gear

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.140 

might<00:02:32.440> be<00:02:32.620> a<00:02:32.650> little<00:02:32.890> hard<00:02:33.070> to<00:02:33.130> see<00:02:33.459> but<00:02:33.760> down

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
might be a little hard to see but down

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.340 
might be a little hard to see but down
in<00:02:34.180> here<00:02:35.010> it's<00:02:36.010> Whitey's<00:02:36.430> all<00:02:36.550> the<00:02:36.670> way<00:02:37.350> down

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
in here it's Whitey's all the way down

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:43.410 
in here it's Whitey's all the way down
in<00:02:38.620> here<00:02:39.070> this<00:02:39.640> it<00:02:41.670> matches<00:02:42.670> what<00:02:42.880> the<00:02:43.090> heat<00:02:43.300> of

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
in here this it matches what the heat of

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:50.180 
in here this it matches what the heat of
it<00:02:43.570> below<00:02:43.900> it<00:02:44.220> and<00:02:45.270> that<00:02:46.270> gear<00:02:46.570> was<00:02:46.780> also<00:02:47.170> tight

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:03:00.290 

there<00:02:51.190> was<00:02:51.340> also<00:02:51.550> tight

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:06.230 

so<00:03:00.960> between<00:03:01.500> the<00:03:01.590> between<00:03:02.100> the<00:03:02.310> two<00:03:05.030> this<00:03:06.030> in

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:06.240 
so between the between the two this in

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.370 
so between the between the two this in
