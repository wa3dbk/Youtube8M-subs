00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:04.220
 we see 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.220
 what we have explained in the article 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:10.730
 this is a list 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.239
 a cheronea. but a listbox 

00:00:15.239 --> 00:00:16.770
 this analysis though 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.770
 similar behaviors 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:25.410
 as I said in the article we have the possibility to select a value 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.410
 vel. 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.519
 in some lists it is also possible to select several colors 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.640
 example strip the banner 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:42.469
 or 

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:45.470
 used range rovers I buy 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.980
 select everything I want 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.039
 obviously without holding down. 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.430
 64 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:52.770
 obviously 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.770
 select the others 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:01.580
 I can also look like Greece explained in the article surprising the 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:02.700
 first value 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.339
 hold uppercase and then 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.440
 after the Second World War and me 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.440
 I selected the trend 

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.640
 this 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.430
 are the ways to select the colors in the lists 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.490
 let's see the other controls we talked about the field and ibiza 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.060
 who's this 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.939
 it is very simple to be used because it is nothing more than a field where 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.480
 there is a cursor 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:37.920
 eh eh eh that I can move heart. I can also 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.420
 meaning 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.420
 there are also let's see if I find one 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:45.659
 here it is 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:51.320
 this recital field which has multiple course lines press button 4 in this case 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.100
 and go adhesive on more than one line 

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.720
 other controls we talked about only 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:01.880
 the two cool 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.870
 of the evening combined 

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:07.430
 this is the classic example of a combined relationship with which the 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.719
 practically heidi button 

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:12.099
 you see 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:15.569
 with the boss is bisexual sorry 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.049
 it is possible to edit 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:20.710
 coherent with 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:23.890
 a ball that does not reside within the list 

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:29.269
 so here I can avoid what I want in particular this is a 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:32.889
 management software for zooplus bank management software 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:37.749
 which practically allows you to enter phone numbers in this case 

00:02:37.749 --> 00:02:42.569
 particular. 2011 program behind the nose control 

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:46.890
 province notes the standard control definition of control 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:49.169
 allows to 

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:50.499
 to insert 

00:02:50.499 --> 00:02:51.659
 values 

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:55.939
 even if they are not contained within the listbox that appears every time 

00:02:55.939 --> 00:02:58.939
 I press this button with the down arrow 

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:04.539
 another type of combo box this time is a forced choice 

00:03:04.539 --> 00:03:07.639
 in fact I can choose how I can't avoid you 

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:11.529
 but I can only choose inside 

00:03:11.529 --> 00:03:13.499
 in the list 

00:03:13.499 --> 00:03:17.699
 obviously however I can also look for a value for example if we want to go 

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:19.200
 to the sea I open 

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.889
 e commerce to give avoids 

00:03:21.889 --> 00:03:26.439
 ebay - 26 automatically checks to search 

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:27.570
 the value 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.570
 corresponding within the list 

00:03:33.149 --> 00:03:37.429
 other than the two of us have spoken ita boh against those who are very simple 

00:03:37.429 --> 00:03:42.529
 obviously it excuses but this powerful lumsa allows the point g 

00:03:42.529 --> 00:03:44.729
 let's go see 

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:46.469
 obviously you see that 

00:03:46.469 --> 00:03:47.770
 on a page 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:48.949
 that is, in one 

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:54.179
 small window this way I can have many i'll take control 

00:03:54.679 --> 00:03:57.319
 for story 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:01.179
 check the same amount of very useful because it is a very good one 

00:04:01.179 --> 00:04:04.179
 control container 

00:04:04.929 --> 00:04:07.129
 equation selected also 

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:10.920
 now when you have focus it can also be selected with 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.659
 the directional arrows 

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:16.099
 obviously when controlling the focus because this control is also a 

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:20.430
 window and here I do not know how I said in the article every window 

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.460
 ants 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.710
 that is, only a window means the focus on 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.849
 or useful links for decorations are 

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:32.849
 let's talk about him, the devil that article 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:35.479
 in the version 

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:38.550
 it's practically the button 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.880
 in this case this is a button and what I had said before 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.490
 that you will go butterfly 

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:49.939
 that practically selected you always say selected 

00:04:49.939 --> 00:04:53.700
 and what is the use of fire seems even in god 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.700
 it's like I had minced meat on ok 

00:04:58.659 --> 00:05:02.860
 to you who need to click here I think you all know how it works 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.259
 how the buttons work
