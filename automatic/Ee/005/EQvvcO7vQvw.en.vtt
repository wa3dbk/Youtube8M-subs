00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.340
 in the year get in the election of beat 

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:06.820
 since I have been in the last few days or weeks 

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:11.360
 he who scented expensive with this victory could make no sad 

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:16.160
 In the next few days I will try to do this dance sport again 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.439
 to catch up 

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:21.740
 Inquiries will be written by Anda the ps4 

00:00:22.319 --> 00:00:25.060
 that he is not she is off here 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:30.900
 This allows GM games were ready on Bar Alpert or just one 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.040
 Chance in July 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.470
 how active he is 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.820
 because with their winners, m also costs regionally 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.670
 just under six dollars 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.280
 therefore I would recommend you as always a Starz acts shows heart too 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.329
 to install 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:48.349
 for example, they are full of Grieg o 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.040
 Link is as always in the description 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.650
 so they come 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:55.630
 to get dapd 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:58.950
 who said that the Saxons note that we have the CIA core 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.850
 you go and I give Thiel 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.850
 Shi Qi RSV No. 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.580
 so Bertz wrote 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.960
 there it is already 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.360
 Above, however, each holder of a PDA quotes just way off these 6 dollars 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:23.450
 and 9 he just sees the other himself is with me it is time is up 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.110
 Yards stretches 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.840
 You can create these directly through a sea of ​​colors 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.210
 Advantage of Red Bull the project will be that 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.460
 So it's on the top right on install 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.790
 he already knows that 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.710
 from other Abs 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.290
 and then it starts 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:43.510
 the games 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:45.540
 the so-called room 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.730
 Unfortunately for the local council can not directly before Alpert or 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:50.730
 iPhone 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:52.300
 download 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.300
 that may have to pull over it 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.890
 if they clarify so betray PCB or even make up for it 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.850
 and before the morning 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.850
 to look at Matt Internet documents 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.879
 There are many pages for it 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.950
 I will not name any now maybe not quite sure what problems 

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:14.859
 could give 

00:02:14.859 --> 00:02:19.339
 "If he absolutely needs an Intel's values, you do not like to go 

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:21.619
 Write to 

00:02:21.619 --> 00:02:25.790
 yes, what else is there to say in addition to build the rest 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:28.379
 he explains then but come 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:31.749
 and also the transferred space is I will then step by step 

00:02:31.749 --> 00:02:35.029
 to explain 

00:02:35.029 --> 00:02:38.029
 For the first time, there is no light left to say 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:42.819
 let's just wait there for a moment 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:45.879
 ksta also Gerd Becht 

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:48.060
 because they do not go back they quote 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.290
 UN also give it over again and again 

00:02:51.969 --> 00:02:53.969
 to come here 

00:02:53.969 --> 00:02:56.969
 Torsten new Eicher no Carinthians on it 

00:02:59.449 --> 00:03:03.019
 whoever here the system the Gassmann surface we aim for too 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:06.019
 Drawing original paper would draw 

00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:10.150
 And now that's her life 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.619
 above you can see a path now 

00:03:12.619 --> 00:03:14.009
 that's the 

00:03:14.009 --> 00:03:17.479
 where later the Worms come in the players 

00:03:18.149 --> 00:03:20.369
 yes, what else is there to say 

00:03:20.369 --> 00:03:23.859
 Here's the big advice later showing the games 

00:03:24.429 --> 00:03:27.150
 nothing is contrary to the last scenes 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.439
 Farmer's saved scores 

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:32.819
 and yet you can already do different things Gallus 

00:03:33.529 --> 00:03:34.370
 around 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.490
 See cars and just stop all the other things 

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:44.120
 Hunt for the very big come will be back later but now 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.179
 I will explain you first 

00:03:47.179 --> 00:03:52.739
 the pleasing ones about us installed on it I will clarify example 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:56.209
 how he is going to stage Brahms 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:00.449
 and as an example I'll call a spokesman April like the mirror 

00:04:00.449 --> 00:04:04.519
 Proverbs was a little younger and the boys I'm still euro 

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:07.439
 whether he is soon 

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:10.409
 Pokemon space reasons 

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:12.799
 TUI embarrassed the others 

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:17.200
 an ingenious player and therefore I will not be anyone 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.530
 So how does it work? 

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.490
 always further back also Braus thereby returned counts 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:25.750
 and Daphne 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:27.699
 subsequently 

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:29.540
 only him RSC 

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.610
 Here you have the damage amounts to the associations 

00:04:33.259 --> 00:04:36.259
 or give her new with Orhan deeds 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:39.949
 Dieter Roth Registration Tel 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.240
 You will then forget the euro password 

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:52.219
 now can zoom out, especially 

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:56.919
 downstairs and you just go to the top 4 called King though 

00:04:56.919 --> 00:04:58.719
 so front r 

00:04:58.719 --> 00:05:02.110
 scroll down to the Upper Rhine 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:05.270
 go on tour Dr here you see the Browns 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:07.719
 PD a 

00:05:07.719 --> 00:05:11.449
 here are the REITs pre-installed mm Diaz 

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:16.539
 Now I've got a Euro while preparing for the castles and 

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:17.550
 leaf green 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:19.449
 also has the changes 

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:20.340
 changes 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.199
 Ltd ERA 

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:26.490
 and both in Turkish Autostadt 16 MB so test is not really synonymous 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:27.409
 bad 

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:29.589
 for a store 

00:05:29.589 --> 00:05:32.829
 Attracts it can acquire was copied and 

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:37.279
 It is already on GBP to GBP 

00:05:38.059 --> 00:05:40.050
 he thought he was the one 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:40.920
 Brahms 

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:43.809
 it turns to scanning 

00:05:43.809 --> 00:05:45.680
 probably nothing left to do 

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:50.039
 to go out of existence as a short Aust inherit as and then 

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:53.039
 Can you actually already Anton too 

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:59.040
 End tastes better and are the Bayer's b-team of beer 

00:06:00.059 --> 00:06:01.229
 preinstalled 

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:05.419
 and I believe in the original version they have been endangering you for a while 

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:07.629
 she has to install herself 

00:06:07.629 --> 00:06:10.849
 but in the meantime, I believe they are already there 

00:06:10.849 --> 00:06:12.729
 who is sure 

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:15.860
 Varieties and quotes that is 

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:19.160
 could now be pulled over the program BN 

00:06:19.669 --> 00:06:22.810
 and is embodied with silver very far ahead 

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:24.409
 back up 

00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:26.279
 bring the boys 

00:06:26.279 --> 00:06:29.279
 launches the labels Bayreuth 

00:06:33.719 --> 00:06:36.719
 and I did not give it all up 

00:06:40.089 --> 00:06:43.089
 small mistakes and now he pulls already 

00:06:43.659 --> 00:06:46.479
 Boyle your new one 

00:06:46.479 --> 00:06:48.219
 ARD 9 Rome 

00:06:48.219 --> 00:06:49.899
 no idea what's going on 

00:06:49.899 --> 00:06:54.860
 Parents once dove I can give them the different argument we give it 

00:06:55.479 --> 00:06:59.419
 I never wanted to spear with him and carries a worry 

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:03.459
 then he moves on in this classic sport he is touring 

00:07:05.349 --> 00:07:07.819
 and give upper screen 

00:07:07.819 --> 00:07:08.690
 the 

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:11.690
 Place usually not so that's just now 

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:13.760
 because I am against mine 

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:17.530
 old-fashioned chip pc connected us there not quite so fast running 

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:23.260
 yes, that seems to be the operation is quite normal and the player believes 

00:07:23.259 --> 00:07:25.520
 is still today 

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.719
 There's a rendezvous to say 

00:07:27.719 --> 00:07:29.949
 and see you next time
