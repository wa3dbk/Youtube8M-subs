 In addition youtuber welcome to my channel in 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:05.160
 this short video I will talk about a 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.919
 problem that has arisen in the samsung 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.380
 galaxy s 6 recently that's something be 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.910
 that has arisen worldwide already 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.130
 world level are looking for 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.039
 asking the solution to the problem of 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.199
 data icon that has disappeared up 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.970
 the moment there is no solution there 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.430
 a possible solution that can work 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.470
 which is having a phone with access to 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.019
 ruth and in certain applications that from 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.109
 soon they do not enable this of a certain 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.759
 way but I do not route to any of 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.130
 my phones since I lose the guarantee 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.410
 about this as you can see here the 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.930
 phone also that I have brothers already 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.300
 they do not have direct access to the options 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.700
 to activate and deactivate the data 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.350
 mobile, the only solution there is 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.899
 activate and deactivate your data 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.399
 mobile is to do it manually through 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.649
 of the configuration options of the 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.750
 phone that is basically a process 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:56.940
 longer than it is simply to go here to 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.210
 settings or settings on the card 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.430
 above enter the options for use of 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.590
 data 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:05.600
 and here we have the option to turn on and 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:07.310
 turn off our mobile data in this 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.610
 case is off as you can see 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:14.030
 right away from my percentage I can not see 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:16.700
 If I have 3G or 4G connection but active 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.710
 immediately my 4g connection appears or 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.540
 3g according to the connection or antenna that 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.979
 you have without being a city 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.440
 principal are going to have four agents and 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:26.390
 they will not have 13 and to activate it 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.800
 we just do it the same 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.750
 way and he tells me that he's going to lose 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.280
 data collection and that's going to be the 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.890
 only way we're going to have for the 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:36.110
 moment while samsung corrects this already 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.020
 that worldwide people are 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.820
 complaining about the disappearance of the icon 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.970
 of data that we have always had here to 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.890
 the hand of wii file follows here is very 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.630
 important to have it in your hand and also 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.729
 very important to have our connection of 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.350
 data here we're going to visit it and it's 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:53.420
