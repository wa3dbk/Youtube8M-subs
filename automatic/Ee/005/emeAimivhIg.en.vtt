cut comb transfer would cut but with
sheer<00:00:20.850> effusions<00:00:21.510> you<00:00:21.750> eliminate<00:00:22.260> all<00:00:22.470> of

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:22.620 
sheer effusions you eliminate all of

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.069 
you cut code then you cut I've been
cutting<00:00:35.309> here<00:00:35.579> for<00:00:35.760> 40<00:00:36.210> years<00:00:36.359> but<00:00:36.510> I<00:00:36.870> just

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
cutting here for 40 years but I just

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.989 
cutting here for 40 years but I just
developed<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.800> sheer<00:00:38.039> fusion<00:00:38.519> about<00:00:38.730> 10

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:38.999 
developed the sheer fusion about 10

00:00:38.999 --> 00:00:42.619 
developed the sheer fusion about 10
years<00:00:39.179> ago<00:00:39.329> and<00:00:40.429> ever<00:00:41.429> since<00:00:41.579> that<00:00:41.910> I<00:00:42.059> increase

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
years ago and ever since that I increase

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.889 
years ago and ever since that I increase
my<00:00:42.660> business<00:00:43.350> my<00:00:44.190> productivity<00:00:44.820> you<00:00:45.600> save<00:00:45.870> a

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
my business my productivity you save a

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.930 
my business my productivity you save a
step<00:00:46.170> but<00:00:46.350> if<00:00:46.469> you<00:00:46.589> add<00:00:46.739> that<00:00:46.769> up<00:00:47.010> 20<00:00:47.460> x<00:00:47.670> 30

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
step but if you add that up 20 x 30

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.410 
step but if you add that up 20 x 30
times<00:00:48.239> on<00:00:48.449> each<00:00:48.480> haircut<00:00:49.079> it<00:00:49.289> really<00:00:49.559> adds<00:00:49.649> up

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:50.420 
times on each haircut it really adds up

00:00:50.420 --> 00:01:00.520 
times on each haircut it really adds up
you'll<00:00:51.420> get<00:00:51.569> your<00:00:51.719> costs<00:00:51.989> back<00:00:52.260> very<00:00:52.559> quickly

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.390 

and<00:01:02.629> also<00:01:03.629> I<00:01:03.809> developed<00:01:04.380> this<00:01:04.470> thumb<00:01:04.830> rest<00:01:05.100> too

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
and also I developed this thumb rest too

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.000 
and also I developed this thumb rest too
which<00:01:06.180> normally<00:01:06.930> everyone<00:01:07.380> puts<00:01:07.620> their<00:01:07.710> hand

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
which normally everyone puts their hand

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.300 
which normally everyone puts their hand
straight<00:01:08.310> into<00:01:08.640> it<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:09.740> with<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.860> thumb<00:01:11.040> rest

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
straight into it and with the thumb rest

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.600 
straight into it and with the thumb rest
you<00:01:11.430> can<00:01:11.840> go<00:01:12.840> sideways<00:01:13.140> which<00:01:13.920> relieves<00:01:14.400> a<00:01:14.580> lot

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
you can go sideways which relieves a lot

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.150 
you can go sideways which relieves a lot
of<00:01:14.970> pressure<00:01:15.240> from<00:01:15.510> your<00:01:15.750> wrist<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.260> your

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:17.160 
of pressure from your wrist and your

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.760 
of pressure from your wrist and your
forearm<00:01:17.760> and<00:01:17.970> your<00:01:18.030> thumb<00:01:18.600> so<00:01:19.200> you<00:01:19.290> can<00:01:19.530> cut

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
forearm and your thumb so you can cut

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.250 
forearm and your thumb so you can cut
much<00:01:20.520> faster<00:01:21.180> easier<00:01:21.620> with<00:01:22.620> more<00:01:22.860> precision<00:01:23.070> I

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:24.260 
much faster easier with more precision I

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
much faster easier with more precision I
tested<00:01:25.260> it<00:01:25.350> for<00:01:25.590> a<00:01:25.650> year<00:01:25.830> to<00:01:25.980> make<00:01:26.130> sure

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
tested it for a year to make sure

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.400 
tested it for a year to make sure
everything<00:01:26.610> was<00:01:26.760> perfect<00:01:26.820> with<00:01:27.390> it<00:01:27.600> you<00:01:28.380> can

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:28.410 
everything was perfect with it you can

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.850 
everything was perfect with it you can
sterilize<00:01:28.950> it<00:01:29.370> with<00:01:29.520> every<00:01:29.790> customer

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
sterilize it with every customer

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.970 
sterilize it with every customer
and<00:01:31.240> the<00:01:32.240> sharpness<00:01:32.600> of<00:01:32.720> the<00:01:32.930> shears<00:01:33.350> of<00:01:33.800> the

and the sharpness of the shears of the
steel<00:01:34.250> is<00:01:34.430> perfect<00:01:34.880> it<00:01:34.970> holds<00:01:35.300> an<00:01:35.420> edge<00:01:35.660> for<00:01:35.990> a

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
steel is perfect it holds an edge for a

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.680 
steel is perfect it holds an edge for a
long<00:01:36.230> time<00:01:36.560> and<00:01:36.880> it<00:01:37.880> just<00:01:38.120> makes<00:01:38.330> it<00:01:38.420> so<00:01:38.480> much
