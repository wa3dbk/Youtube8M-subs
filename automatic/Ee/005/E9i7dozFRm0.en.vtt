00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:19.800

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.890
 do not hesitate to tell us the rrq 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.300
 especially on facebook and twitter for 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.070
 pennyroyal pennyroyal has sold if I 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.119
 not deceive to go for myself 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.890
 a moment us 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:34.980
 of course you can say it's me 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:39.360
 here the lakes and lacquered also the pages of 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:42.329
 funkadelic danos of care study pumps 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.980
 everyone's zioui do you 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.570
 pleasure 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:48.260
 we are failing people make sure of my cause 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:52.649
 also do you here 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:57.539
 so let's go we have m pippidi 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:59.850
 gadu at the bottom left in zerg in blue and 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:03.929
 in the top right we have quantum 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:06.450
 who play in red in blue listen on 

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:08.549
 is high below so a map does not have 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.290
 of slot us what does nadal owe a 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.090
 delay may be a little more 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.530
 so we've already left 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.409
 passion for their foal bed very 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.290
 clearly the question is now 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.030
 good everywhere everywhere and both players 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.009
 are going to decide the terrace while still 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.810
 once we are going to have a cost surely 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.310
 of shepherd who is going to leave on a 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.460
 fifteen children on my site I will 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.229
 not go too far because they are not 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.210
 too much agree with us we do the 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.020
 predictions what are you doing 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.579
 think the world first in doublets 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.369
 shorts doubles 

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:43.320
 bravo bravo listened while you 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.049
 notice that a scorer pool would not be 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.090
 these creams 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:48.719
 but hey it's his masters blows 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.229
 on the table 

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:54.509
 I will go more hits on the door 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:56.300
 it's done well it hurts and 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.910
 it's harder 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.950
 and two sides of the discharges are typical 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.810
 gas buyer hen simply 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.220
 for shipping to a super early and 

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.230
 can the math control to have 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.730
 even an aggression and laayoune who 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:10.640
 change that changes and that makes a 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:12.370
 gazpacho if the strange savate if it's 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:16.400
 not seen from the side of the rg it can surprise 

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:18.860
 because quantic youn who both b2b 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:24.770
 just before left on his gas 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:26.690
 patrick geering interesting liu who 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:28.220
 change a little bit it would surprise me that 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.290
 it's not seen in the sense that we have 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.640
 seen every time a good shepherd too 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:33.980
 hot with her zerglings that shakes you 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.510
 all at all after that it's true 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.280
 as you say so did not see that can 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.600
 to be the instant punishment behind in 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.220
 anyway the other two to one of the two 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.600
 players who took the information that 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:43.850
 its part on hatcher so it's rather 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.110
 safe and we have we even blogger then 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.030
 that he was trying to take the info on the 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.500
 gas did not know a little bit complicated in 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:52.070
 anyway drg I do not think he will see it 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:54.740
 but why not for daddy alioune a 

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:56.540
 full speed a big tennis ping bening that 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:03:00.580
 I would be pleased to see aggressive 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:00.580
 I love his microphone to see 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:08.920
 or you did not manu 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.200
 mute because I came back and I 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.880
 spoken in a vacuum as usual it 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.630
 pleases 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.780
 thank you velardi because I would have 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:19.110
 continued again I said no the pickups 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.950
 Korean this impressive when 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.810
 even quite frightening 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.540
 you will see how we manage a microphone 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.860
 well hold the microphone after I do not know 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.300
 if they will do that but are rather 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.720
 gone for because we only mark 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.950
 youn t next to the gas with three 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.480
 drone 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:40.420
 that's Balinese live then youn 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:43.290
 just left on more gas at all 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.290
 the d1 saturday 

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:51.310
 I do not know why but I feel that 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:53.410
 youn will punish rg a very bola 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:54.910
 clearly diaz one must defend himself 

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:56.380
 that with zerguine in front we will have used 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:58.210
 to green bay ningbo ask online in 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.010
 production a separate from yuji has very 

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:01.600
 clear up with his opponent 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:03.670
 but that's catastrophic because he 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.900
 is no spine although he queen 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.460
 just saw him anyway his friend 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:08.860
 learned the information that had only two 

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:10.840
 queens where should be happy is 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.760
 so well played the baroness to send 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.170
 but it's so well played the 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.330
 part of one of the first two ranges 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:18.160
 he went on hatch first and 

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:20.020
 rails the gas paperie and he played there 

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.670
 on it he said yesterday of shepherd I was speaking 

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:23.380
 from my guy my name is youn and 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:25.060
 behind that in fact i do hk this pool 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:26.140
 I will do my zergling baneling and 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.360
 when I go to your house you go 

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:30.010
 say what are you fighting vatted over and art 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.480

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:32.860
 so funny people and buildings 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:35.110
 you can say gg in addition to 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:37.780
 will reject p3a lehane it's good I 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:40.360
 think that behind attention pegi 18 

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.910
 in live live the queen kiss ferrer get 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:45.130
 make some who are killed production 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:46.990
 intensive on the part of drg problem 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:47.950
 is that there is no ning for hergÃ© 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.150
 the elbows that falls 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:50.770

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.060

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.410

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:15.160
 they did the housework follow my weight 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:18.160
 bening in ta half an hour magic pad 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:20.290
 rest i dropped by rg again one 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:22.330
 once a very very fast sheath and has 

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:24.520
 really I applauded let them 

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:26.830
 brain on it and unfortunately is 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.330
 for once almost one of the rejections the 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:29.830
 two of the first two ranges he has very 

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:33.130
 well this shot you're ok will not say 

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:34.480
 gilles the clean he plays macau and there he 

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:36.460
 got caught on the third one he 

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:38.590
 was going to check the information too late 

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:40.180
 he is really surprised very very 

00:05:38.590 --> 00:05:42.400
 well done first of yuna level 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:44.290
 Malian it was rather fun it is played 

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.850
 like that the bo5 is in relation to this 

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:47.140
 which happened the ranges of before s and 

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:48.640
 hold on okay I did it twice 

00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:50.080
 the same bo he'll think I'm going 

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.490
 do the third time the same bo 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:53.560
 still and actually no I just 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:54.040
 surprise and just like that it did not 

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.620
 saves 

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:59.860
 so here we are at 2 1 he has two 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:00.780
 match balls an attention we will see 

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:03.130
 what will happen 

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:04.810
 are we still going to risk 

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:06.100
 will finally see an hour pool the because 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:08.260
 usually in bo5 

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:11.320
 we always see at least one who does the 

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:13.030
 color liverpool 9 the 10th or the 8th and 

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:14.740
 windows 7 you are it's very very 

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:17.500
 aggressive but after times it can 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:20.080
 to be not this do it because hours on 

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:22.560
 aggression not so the ordeal of five 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.560
 minutes 

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:38.030
 and
