00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:15.289
 with this standard tuning blog we are going to 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.539
 start healing which we will 

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:19.910
 mark a power agreement so now 

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:23.300
 you know fret two of the strings 4 and 3 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:25.880
 let's play with the frets 3 and 5 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:28.460
 alternating rope 5 to the air and let's 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.470
 end with the same agreement 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.360
 power of the rope 5 with which we have 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:36.560
 started so 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:40.790
 you have seen it is accord power 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.790
 fret 3 air fret 5 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.809
 air fret 3 and it's the same agreed to 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.030
 power 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.750
 and this we repeat with a pause between 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.750
 each of the times 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:57.170
 OK 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.170
 because we are taking a run 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:02.329
 now let's accelerate the issue 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.610
 and we are going to do it playing with the rope 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:06.410
 5 on air 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.730
 and the same agreed power with which 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.730
 We are playing from the beginning 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:22.700
 baleares simple from here we went to a 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.700
 power chord 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.970
 the out of tune guitar 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:34.189
 two 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:42.229
 and we went to wind the biggest one so it's 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:44.630
 we caught the frets two of the caves 4 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:46.579
 3 and 2 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.680
 a hit only to pass to the next 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:51.350
 I agreed that it is on the 3rd fret of the 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.420
 6 string you can mark with your finger 2 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.310
 It's worth to make the transition more 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.229
 simple from the biggest with the finger 2 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:01.539
 we mark the fret 3 of the doors and if 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:01.539
 the frets 3 of the united strings 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.299
 this game we repeat it twice this and 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.690
 As you have seen, I have the position 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:15.370
 of the finger vale took the 2 to the frets 3 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:18.700
 of the string 6 well 0 3 and 4 to the 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.650
 frets three of the four of his 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:26.310
 and we make a game on the top 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:26.310
 of the fret guitar 3234 good 6 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.770
 and we start again 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:36.320
 we pause giving the clear game 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.810
 I hope so sure 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:40.850
 quickie after this what we're going to 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.340
 to do is the coverage of the solos worth 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.320
 let's see three rivers that is pretty much 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:49.300
 the same played differently 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.300
 let's start with the first 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:55.060
 I've seen a string 5 air fret 3 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:00.870
 and we repeat but to this acute note is 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:03.170
 enter is the four string to the air is worth 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.170
 thing 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:09.650
 3 air rope 5 rope 4 al 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.650
 air 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:15.600
 and again those power chords and 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.600
 Famous 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.650
 this same as we are going to do two 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.980
 different ways to cover the 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:28.470
 two solos that there are in the following way 

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:31.540
 go on after this then 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:34.239
 power chords 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.250
 on the frets 3 of the string 5 and on the 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:38.890
 5 fret the same as it did before 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:41.780
 only now with power chords 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:45.250
 and the good 5 air 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:50.980
 ok and this is what we do in our 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:50.980
 37 is from rope 4 and 3 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:58.470
 ok and then you do 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:58.470
 and angus young 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:02.240
 OK and again 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:19.260
 and that it then becomes so massa 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:19.260
 to tighten the fret well 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.700
 good 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:32.980
 of small confusion 

00:04:35.249 --> 00:04:42.580
 pussy then the next thing we're going to do 

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:46.319
 are going to be frets two of the strings 4 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.319
 but because of the different rhythm 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:52.990
 what are 23 33 I mean the blows 

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.130
 for yes no 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:03.390
 more or less put the cobra on 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:05.340
 wonder of the rhythm and you do exactly 

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:08.000
 the same the frets three of the strings 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:08.000
 low voucher 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:16.850
 and that's to finish the subject already 

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.850
 OK 

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:28.159
 this color roses and forgive the mistakes 

00:05:25.219 --> 00:05:30.739
 that I do not feel like repeating them and that 

00:05:28.159 --> 00:05:33.110
 I hope nothing with this serves you 

00:05:30.739 --> 00:05:36.439
 You have liked to comment criticize this 

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:39.129
 will grow and share and third point with 

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:39.129
 greetings to all
