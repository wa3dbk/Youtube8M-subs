00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
these zone coverages obviously a lot

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:31.790 
these zone coverages obviously a lot
going<00:00:30.869> on<00:00:30.990> but<00:00:31.230> one<00:00:31.410> of<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.560> one<00:00:31.679> of<00:00:31.710> the

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
going on but one of the one of the

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.100 
going on but one of the one of the
biggest<00:00:32.040> things<00:00:32.460> is<00:00:32.700> to<00:00:33.180> take<00:00:33.360> away<00:00:33.630> time<00:00:33.870> and

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
biggest things is to take away time and

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.110 
biggest things is to take away time and
space<00:00:34.350> when<00:00:35.070> their<00:00:35.250> forwards<00:00:35.700> would<00:00:35.850> have<00:00:35.969> the

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
space when their forwards would have the

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.850 
space when their forwards would have the
pot<00:00:36.300> for<00:00:36.510> example<00:00:36.930> therefore<00:00:37.320> gets<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.680> puck

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
pot for example therefore gets the puck

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.920 
pot for example therefore gets the puck
there<00:00:38.129> you<00:00:38.700> know<00:00:38.820> and<00:00:38.940> we<00:00:39.090> have<00:00:39.180> a<00:00:39.210> defender<00:00:39.750> on

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
there you know and we have a defender on

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.360 
there you know and we have a defender on
them<00:00:40.079> we've<00:00:40.230> got<00:00:40.440> it<00:00:40.530> we've<00:00:40.620> got<00:00:40.680> to<00:00:40.890> close<00:00:41.100> on

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
them we've got it we've got to close on

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.950 
them we've got it we've got to close on
him<00:00:41.550> we<00:00:41.640> got<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:41.879> go<00:00:41.940> stick<00:00:42.180> on<00:00:42.360> puck<00:00:42.600> we've<00:00:42.809> got

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
him we got to go stick on puck we've got

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.510 
him we got to go stick on puck we've got
to<00:00:43.050> take<00:00:43.260> away<00:00:43.469> his<00:00:43.559> time<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:43.980> space<00:00:44.190> so<00:00:44.399> he

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
to take away his time and space so he

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.760 
to take away his time and space so he
cannot<00:00:44.879> have<00:00:45.090> time<00:00:45.360> to<00:00:45.899> make<00:00:46.020> a<00:00:46.079> play<00:00:46.350> and

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
cannot have time to make a play and

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.440 
cannot have time to make a play and
obviously<00:00:47.100> with<00:00:47.340> more<00:00:47.550> skilled<00:00:47.879> players<00:00:48.180> it's

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
obviously with more skilled players it's

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.940 
obviously with more skilled players it's
tough<00:00:48.629> it's<00:00:48.840> more<00:00:49.020> difficult<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.829> other

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
tough it's more difficult the other

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:51.380 
tough it's more difficult the other
thing<00:00:50.219> for<00:00:50.460> me<00:00:50.550> is<00:00:50.579> when<00:00:50.789> the<00:00:50.850> puck<00:00:51.030> gets<00:00:51.270> to

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
thing for me is when the puck gets to

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.000 
thing for me is when the puck gets to
the<00:00:51.480> point<00:00:51.690> you<00:00:52.379> know<00:00:52.440> they<00:00:52.590> want<00:00:52.739> to<00:00:52.860> shoot

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
the point you know they want to shoot

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.319 
the point you know they want to shoot
the<00:00:53.340> they<00:00:53.489> want<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.789> get<00:00:53.850> pucks<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.210> the

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
the they want to get pucks to the

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.180
