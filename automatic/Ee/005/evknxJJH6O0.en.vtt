through<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.520> slits<00:00:59.850> on<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.180> two<00:01:00.359> parts<00:01:00.690> of

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
through the slits on the two parts of

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.630 
through the slits on the two parts of
the<00:01:00.809> sole<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.379> then<00:01:01.500> turn<00:01:01.770> it<00:01:01.800> so<00:01:02.100> it<00:01:02.129> sits<00:01:02.489> in

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
the sole and then turn it so it sits in

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.179 
the sole and then turn it so it sits in
the<00:01:02.730> little<00:01:02.969> cavity<00:01:03.390> underneath<00:01:03.979> don't<00:01:04.979> worry

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
the little cavity underneath don't worry

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.060 
the little cavity underneath don't worry
it<00:01:05.700> gets<00:01:05.909> easier<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.360> next<00:01:06.479> time<00:01:06.840> around<00:01:07.070> the

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
it gets easier the next time around the

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.039 
it gets easier the next time around the
openings<00:01:08.460> get<00:01:08.670> a<00:01:08.700> little<00:01:09.000> more<00:01:09.180> flexible<00:01:09.750> and

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
openings get a little more flexible and

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.700 
openings get a little more flexible and
hey<00:01:10.409> a<00:01:10.680> little<00:01:11.070> practice<00:01:11.430> never<00:01:11.580> hurts<00:01:12.710> there

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710
