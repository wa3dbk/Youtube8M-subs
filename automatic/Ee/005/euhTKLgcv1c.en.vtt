00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
a flat surface as well some will such in

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.770 
a flat surface as well some will such in
the<00:00:44.010> case<00:00:44.190> as<00:00:44.340> a<00:00:44.370> necklace<00:00:44.610> will<00:00:45.480> actually

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
the case as a necklace will actually

table does come with black and white

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.500 
table does come with black and white
just<00:00:50.550> because<00:00:50.820> when<00:00:50.969> you're<00:00:51.120> shooting<00:00:51.270> you'll

find that some items will actually shoot
better<00:00:53.910> on<00:00:54.120> black<00:00:54.449> surface<00:00:54.870> whereas<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:55.500> lot<00:00:55.620> of

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
better on black surface whereas a lot of

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.709 
better on black surface whereas a lot of
items<00:00:56.010> will<00:00:56.309> shoot<00:00:56.489> better<00:00:56.610> on<00:00:56.850> white<00:00:57.239> just

depending on the type of jewelry you're
using<00:00:59.640> now<00:01:00.629> when<00:01:00.809> positioning<00:01:01.109> your<00:01:01.559> lights

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
using now when positioning your lights

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.860 
using now when positioning your lights
you're<00:01:02.640> actually<00:01:03.030> going<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.359> want<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.719> adjust

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
you're actually going to want to adjust

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.990 
you're actually going to want to adjust
the<00:01:04.229> angle<00:01:04.530> a<00:01:04.619> little<00:01:04.650> bit<00:01:04.920> depending<00:01:05.610> on<00:01:05.939> the

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
the angle a little bit depending on the

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.539 
the angle a little bit depending on the
amount<00:01:06.390> of<00:01:06.510> light<00:01:06.750> or<00:01:07.020> reflective<00:01:07.619> glare<00:01:07.860> now

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
amount of light or reflective glare now

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.550 
amount of light or reflective glare now
in<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:08.790> case<00:01:08.939> of<00:01:09.150> this<00:01:09.330> necklace<00:01:09.840> here<00:01:10.110> you

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
in the case of this necklace here you

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.859 
in the case of this necklace here you
can<00:01:10.740> see<00:01:10.920> it<00:01:11.130> does<00:01:11.280> have<00:01:11.310> many<00:01:11.549> facets<00:01:12.180> which

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
can see it does have many facets which

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.510 
can see it does have many facets which
not<00:01:13.140> all<00:01:13.170> pieces<00:01:13.650> you<00:01:13.770> can<00:01:13.920> see<00:01:14.070> but<00:01:14.340> in<00:01:14.430> this

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
not all pieces you can see but in this

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.890 
not all pieces you can see but in this
case<00:01:14.729> you<00:01:14.939> can<00:01:15.090> actually<00:01:15.210> see<00:01:15.509> several<00:01:15.720> of

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
case you can actually see several of

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:16.999 
case you can actually see several of
them<00:01:16.020> so<00:01:16.439> it's<00:01:16.560> going<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:16.740> be<00:01:16.799> highly

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
them so it's going to be highly

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:19.820 
them so it's going to be highly
reflective<00:01:17.700> so<00:01:18.540> we<00:01:18.600> can<00:01:18.720> actually<00:01:18.869> remove<00:01:19.439> the

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
reflective so we can actually remove the

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.810 
reflective so we can actually remove the
display<00:01:20.040> table<00:01:22.130> now<00:01:23.130> putting<00:01:23.430> it<00:01:23.580> in<00:01:23.700> this

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
display table now putting it in this

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.670 
display table now putting it in this
position<00:01:24.060> with<00:01:24.479> a<00:01:24.509> light<00:01:24.869> shining<00:01:25.350> more<00:01:25.500> on

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
position with a light shining more on

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.260 
position with a light shining more on
the<00:01:26.040> subject<00:01:26.369> it's<00:01:26.520> going<00:01:26.640> to<00:01:26.700> produce<00:01:26.850> a<00:01:27.210> lot

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
the subject it's going to produce a lot

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.810 
the subject it's going to produce a lot
of<00:01:27.689> glare<00:01:27.960> so<00:01:28.530> what<00:01:28.740> we<00:01:28.890> want<00:01:29.220> to<00:01:29.310> do<00:01:29.400> for<00:01:29.640> this

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
of glare so what we want to do for this

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.999 
of glare so what we want to do for this
piece<00:01:30.119> is<00:01:30.630> you<00:01:30.750> can<00:01:30.900> actually<00:01:31.020> move<00:01:31.439> it<00:01:31.740> back<00:01:31.979> a

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
piece is you can actually move it back a

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.090 
piece is you can actually move it back a
little<00:01:32.220> bit<00:01:32.490> more<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:33.000> then<00:01:33.900> actually<00:01:34.380> angle

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
little bit more and then actually angle

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.380 
little bit more and then actually angle
the<00:01:35.220> lights<00:01:35.430> to<00:01:35.640> where<00:01:35.759> there's<00:01:35.909> more<00:01:36.119> bounce

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
the lights to where there's more bounce

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.300 
the lights to where there's more bounce
to<00:01:37.079> kind<00:01:37.259> of<00:01:37.320> give<00:01:37.439> a<00:01:37.470> little<00:01:37.560> bit<00:01:37.860> of<00:01:37.979> a<00:01:38.040> glow

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
to kind of give a little bit of a glow

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.780 
to kind of give a little bit of a glow
and<00:01:38.549> not<00:01:38.850> as<00:01:39.000> much<00:01:39.150> reflective<00:01:39.780> or<00:01:40.130> if<00:01:41.130> you<00:01:41.549> are

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
and not as much reflective or if you are

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.069 
and not as much reflective or if you are
finding<00:01:42.150> that<00:01:42.210> you<00:01:42.270> are<00:01:42.479> seeing<00:01:42.780> a<00:01:42.899> lot<00:01:43.020> of

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
finding that you are seeing a lot of

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.840 
finding that you are seeing a lot of
