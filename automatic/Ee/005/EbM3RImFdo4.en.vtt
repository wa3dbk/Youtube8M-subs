in<00:00:08.040> this<00:00:08.309> video<00:00:08.610> we're<00:00:08.849> going<00:00:09.030> to<00:00:09.240> show<00:00:09.530> how<00:00:10.530> to

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:10.580 
in this video we're going to show how to

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.270 
in this video we're going to show how to
put<00:00:11.580> it<00:00:11.670> on<00:00:11.790> properly<00:00:12.030> by<00:00:12.660> not<00:00:13.259> having<00:00:14.009> the

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
put it on properly by not having the

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.400 
put it on properly by not having the
wire<00:00:14.490> so<00:00:14.940> far<00:00:15.179> back<00:00:15.360> on<00:00:15.599> your<00:00:15.750> head<00:00:15.960> to<00:00:16.260> where

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
wire so far back on your head to where

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:22.910 
wire so far back on your head to where
it's<00:00:16.560> really<00:00:16.920> loose<00:00:20.960> so<00:00:21.960> we'll<00:00:22.650> go<00:00:22.769> ahead<00:00:22.830> and

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
it's really loose so we'll go ahead and

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:23.720 
it's really loose so we'll go ahead and
get<00:00:23.039> started

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
get started

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.609 
get started
pull<00:00:24.240> mine<00:00:24.449> off<00:00:24.630> this<00:00:24.840> is<00:00:25.019> a<00:00:25.050> 16<00:00:25.590> inch<00:00:26.840> and<00:00:27.840> I'm

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
pull mine off this is a 16 inch and I'm

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.679 
pull mine off this is a 16 inch and I'm
going<00:00:28.980> to<00:00:29.010> improperly<00:00:29.820> put<00:00:30.119> it<00:00:30.210> on<00:00:30.330> right<00:00:30.570> now

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
going to improperly put it on right now

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.500 
going to improperly put it on right now
so<00:00:31.650> pay<00:00:31.949> attention<00:00:32.460> to<00:00:32.640> where<00:00:32.880> I<00:00:32.910> place<00:00:33.270> the

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
so pay attention to where I place the

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.600 
so pay attention to where I place the
wire<00:00:33.719> and<00:00:34.170> then<00:00:34.800> I'm<00:00:35.070> going<00:00:35.190> to<00:00:35.280> turn<00:00:35.489> around

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
wire and then I'm going to turn around

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.459 
wire and then I'm going to turn around
and<00:00:35.850> show<00:00:36.090> you<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.390> two<00:00:36.570> different<00:00:36.600> points

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
and show you the two different points

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.979 
and show you the two different points
and<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:38.190> reason<00:00:38.579> why<00:00:38.730> this<00:00:38.790> is<00:00:39.149> an<00:00:39.450> improper

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
and the reason why this is an improper

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.229 
and the reason why this is an improper
fitting<00:00:40.500> is<00:00:40.710> because<00:00:41.160> the<00:00:41.309> wire<00:00:41.520> was<00:00:41.940> placed

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
fitting is because the wire was placed

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.170 
fitting is because the wire was placed
way<00:00:43.140> back<00:00:43.469> on<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.829> fork<00:00:44.100> on<00:00:44.280> the<00:00:44.370> top<00:00:44.969> of<00:00:45.090> the

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
way back on the fork on the top of the

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.600 
way back on the fork on the top of the
head<00:00:45.360> not<00:00:45.719> an<00:00:46.020> inch<00:00:46.260> or<00:00:47.039> an<00:00:47.250> inch<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.489> a<00:00:47.579> half

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
head not an inch or an inch and a half

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.389 
head not an inch or an inch and a half
from<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.910> hairline<00:00:48.329> so<00:00:49.050> what<00:00:49.500> what<00:00:49.950> happens

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
from the hairline so what what happens

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.680 
from the hairline so what what happens
with<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.480> fitting<00:00:51.870> is<00:00:52.820> your<00:00:53.820> crown<00:00:54.480> hair

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
with the fitting is your crown hair

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:57.020 
with the fitting is your crown hair
extension<00:00:55.289> ends<00:00:55.980> up<00:00:56.070> being<00:00:56.280> all<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.730> way<00:00:56.820> down

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
extension ends up being all the way down

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.750 
extension ends up being all the way down
here<00:00:57.360> on<00:00:57.390> your<00:00:57.510> neck<00:00:57.949> not<00:00:58.949> on<00:00:59.190> your<00:00:59.370> occipital

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
here on your neck not on your occipital

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.410 
here on your neck not on your occipital
bone<00:01:00.149> and<00:01:00.859> also<00:01:01.859> another<00:01:02.550> reason<00:01:02.789> why<00:01:03.030> this<00:01:03.239> is

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
bone and also another reason why this is

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.119 
bone and also another reason why this is
an<00:01:03.510> improper<00:01:03.840> fitting<00:01:04.260> is<00:01:04.350> because<00:01:04.589> too<00:01:04.949> much

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
an improper fitting is because too much

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.039 
an improper fitting is because too much
hair<00:01:05.549> comes<00:01:05.970> up<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.420> over<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.500> halo<00:01:08.159> so<00:01:09.060> your

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
hair comes up and over the halo so your

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.320 
hair comes up and over the halo so your
your<00:01:10.350> wire<00:01:10.560> can<00:01:10.920> stretch<00:01:11.250> like<00:01:11.520> that<00:01:11.700> because

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
your wire can stretch like that because

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.410 
your wire can stretch like that because
the<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.260> hair<00:01:13.860> extension<00:01:14.340> itself<00:01:14.760> is<00:01:15.030> really

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
the the hair extension itself is really

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.530 
the the hair extension itself is really
heavy<00:01:15.869> with<00:01:16.470> 140<00:01:17.130> grams<00:01:17.340> of<00:01:17.580> human<00:01:17.909> running

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
heavy with 140 grams of human running

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.440 
heavy with 140 grams of human running
hair<00:01:18.750> and<00:01:19.280> you<00:01:20.280> don't<00:01:20.430> want<00:01:20.549> to<00:01:20.610> feel<00:01:20.790> not

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
hair and you don't want to feel not

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.440 
hair and you don't want to feel not
confident<00:01:22.049> in<00:01:22.250> your<00:01:23.250> daily<00:01:23.700> activities

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
confident in your daily activities

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.270 
confident in your daily activities
wearing<00:01:25.020> a<00:01:25.110> hair<00:01:25.290> extension<00:01:25.500> that<00:01:25.860> is<00:01:25.979> not

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280

attached<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:27.000> feeling<00:01:27.810> like<00:01:27.930> it's<00:01:28.080> going<00:01:28.259> to

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
attached and feeling like it's going to

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.940

fall off see how I can just every time I
touch<00:01:32.520> it<00:01:32.729> or<00:01:32.880> it<00:01:33.119> just<00:01:33.450> moves<00:01:34.100> okay<00:01:35.100> so<00:01:35.159> now

touch it or it just moves okay so now
we're<00:01:35.610> going<00:01:35.759> to<00:01:35.880> show<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.810> proper<00:01:37.200> way<00:01:38.299> again

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
we're going to show the proper way again

we're going to show the proper way again
you<00:01:39.420> want<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:39.630> focus<00:01:39.960> on<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.229> wire<00:01:40.409> first

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
you want to focus on the wire first

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.060 
you want to focus on the wire first
putting<00:01:42.000> that<00:01:42.150> wire<00:01:42.360> up<00:01:42.750> about<00:01:43.320> an<00:01:43.439> inch<00:01:43.619> to<00:01:43.920> an

inch and a half from the hairline and it
should<00:01:47.549> be<00:01:47.700> snug<00:01:48.649> see<00:01:49.649> how<00:01:49.799> much<00:01:49.950> higher<00:01:50.189> up<00:01:50.460> on

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
should be snug see how much higher up on

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.480 
should be snug see how much higher up on
the<00:01:50.759> occipital<00:01:51.090> bone<00:01:51.570> that<00:01:52.049> is<00:01:52.200> here<00:01:52.619> it'll

the occipital bone that is here it'll
fall<00:01:53.880> down<00:01:54.210> into<00:01:54.450> place<00:01:54.750> perfectly<00:01:55.079> once<00:01:55.710> you

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
fall down into place perfectly once you

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.480 
fall down into place perfectly once you
pull<00:01:56.100> that<00:01:56.130> top<00:01:56.549> here

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
pull that top here

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:02.340 
pull that top here
and<00:01:57.640> over<00:01:59.070> see<00:02:00.070> how<00:02:00.220> the<00:02:01.050> extension<00:02:02.050> is<00:02:02.200> up

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
and over see how the extension is up

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.240 
and over see how the extension is up
here<00:02:02.680> and<00:02:02.920> not<00:02:03.100> down<00:02:03.130> here<00:02:04.020> that<00:02:05.020> makes<00:02:05.530> a<00:02:05.740> huge

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
here and not down here that makes a huge

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:07.050 
here and not down here that makes a huge
difference

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
difference

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.719 
difference
whenever<00:02:07.870> I<00:02:08.200> have<00:02:08.500> improperly<00:02:08.979> fitted<00:02:09.580> onto

whenever I have improperly fitted onto

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.030 
whenever I have improperly fitted onto

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
myself its I can feel it right away it's

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.100 
myself its I can feel it right away it's
easy<00:02:12.400> I<00:02:12.550> can<00:02:12.790> take<00:02:13.120> it<00:02:13.240> off<00:02:13.360> and<00:02:13.660> it<00:02:13.720> takes<00:02:13.959> me

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
easy I can take it off and it takes me
