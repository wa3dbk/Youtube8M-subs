00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.060 
surrounding the game title seems to
suggest<00:01:11.450> they<00:01:12.050> are<00:01:12.140> part<00:01:12.380> of<00:01:12.440> a<00:01:12.530> common<00:01:12.830> cause

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
suggest they are part of a common cause

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.190 
suggest they are part of a common cause
and<00:01:13.490> since<00:01:13.970> Deathstroke<00:01:14.540> a<00:01:14.720> confirmed

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
and since Deathstroke a confirmed

and since Deathstroke a confirmed
assassin<00:01:15.770> is<00:01:15.920> among<00:01:16.460> them<00:01:16.610> perhaps<00:01:17.270> this

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:17.510 
assassin is among them perhaps this

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.900 
assassin is among them perhaps this
