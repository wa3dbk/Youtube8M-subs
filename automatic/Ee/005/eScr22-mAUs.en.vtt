00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:58.209 
really don't want to go down there I'll

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:01.229 
really don't want to go down there I'll
just<00:03:58.299> leave<00:03:58.599> that<00:03:58.750> in<00:03:59.190> there<00:04:00.190> now<00:04:00.760> in<00:04:01.120> a

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 
just leave that in there now in a

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:04.940 
just leave that in there now in a
previous<00:04:01.450> Pablo<00:04:02.140> I<00:04:02.440> was<00:04:03.040> doing<00:04:03.549> something<00:04:03.849> and

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:04.950 
previous Pablo I was doing something and

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:07.559 
previous Pablo I was doing something and
this<00:04:05.950> is<00:04:06.129> the<00:04:06.280> disadvantage<00:04:06.579> to<00:04:07.150> print<00:04:07.450> and

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:07.569 
this is the disadvantage to print and

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:12.210 
this is the disadvantage to print and
stuff<00:04:07.870> is<00:04:09.150> if<00:04:10.150> you<00:04:10.420> click<00:04:10.720> the<00:04:10.930> print<00:04:11.260> icon<00:04:11.500> on

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 
stuff is if you click the print icon on

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.590 
stuff is if you click the print icon on
brick<00:04:12.910> link<00:04:13.180> and<00:04:14.040> you<00:04:15.040> got<00:04:15.250> two<00:04:15.910> batches<00:04:16.419> or

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:16.600 
brick link and you got two batches or

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:20.580 
brick link and you got two batches or
more<00:04:17.639> it'll<00:04:18.639> only<00:04:18.760> print<00:04:19.209> whatever<00:04:19.539> batch<00:04:20.260> you

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
more it'll only print whatever batch you

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:22.560 
more it'll only print whatever batch you
clicked<00:04:21.400> on<00:04:21.549> the<00:04:21.669> icon<00:04:22.060> I<00:04:22.090> don't<00:04:22.330> know<00:04:22.389> that

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
clicked on the icon I don't know that

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:23.969 
clicked on the icon I don't know that
makes<00:04:22.750> any<00:04:22.930> sense<00:04:22.990> to<00:04:23.260> you<00:04:23.470> but<00:04:23.500> basically<00:04:23.889> I

00:04:23.969 --> 00:04:23.979 
makes any sense to you but basically I

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:26.219 
makes any sense to you but basically I
printed<00:04:24.580> out<00:04:24.729> the<00:04:24.910> order<00:04:25.240> it<00:04:25.750> didn't<00:04:26.020> have<00:04:26.139> the

00:04:26.219 --> 00:04:26.229 
printed out the order it didn't have the

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:27.719 
printed out the order it didn't have the
second<00:04:26.560> batch<00:04:26.740> which<00:04:27.039> was<00:04:27.190> only<00:04:27.340> this<00:04:27.520> one

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:27.729 
second batch which was only this one

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:30.330 
second batch which was only this one
piece<00:04:28.030> so<00:04:28.389> I<00:04:28.660> even<00:04:29.470> went<00:04:29.650> back<00:04:29.800> and<00:04:29.979> watched<00:04:30.190> my

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:30.340 
piece so I even went back and watched my

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.390 
piece so I even went back and watched my
video<00:04:30.669> because<00:04:31.570> when<00:04:31.930> person<00:04:32.889> got<00:04:33.039> the<00:04:33.160> order

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:33.400 
video because when person got the order

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.800 
video because when person got the order
they<00:04:33.550> said<00:04:33.729> they<00:04:33.820> were<00:04:33.910> missing<00:04:34.240> a<00:04:34.300> piece<00:04:34.510> and

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
they said they were missing a piece and

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.719 
they said they were missing a piece and
I'm<00:04:34.930> I<00:04:35.229> thought<00:04:36.070> I<00:04:36.099> had<00:04:36.280> done<00:04:36.460> something

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:36.729
