you<00:02:12.100> can<00:02:12.220> see<00:02:12.340> the<00:02:12.490> battery<00:02:12.670> will<00:02:13.120> go<00:02:13.300> right

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
you can see the battery will go right

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.140 
you can see the battery will go right
here<00:02:13.560> the<00:02:14.560> SIM<00:02:14.830> card<00:02:14.860> will<00:02:15.430> probably<00:02:15.760> slide<00:02:16.000> in

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
here the SIM card will probably slide in

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
here the SIM card will probably slide in
right<00:02:16.209> there

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
right there

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.990

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
hole on the right side if we compare

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.150 
hole on the right side if we compare
this<00:03:25.239> with<00:03:25.480> the<00:03:25.780> front<00:03:26.200> housing<00:03:26.410> you<00:03:26.830> can<00:03:26.950> see

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
this with the front housing you can see

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.280 
this with the front housing you can see
that<00:03:27.340> the<00:03:27.459> rear<00:03:27.610> housing<00:03:27.820> fits<00:03:28.330> right<00:03:28.570> in<00:03:28.810> it's

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
that the rear housing fits right in it's

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.830 
that the rear housing fits right in it's
the<00:03:29.380> same<00:03:29.620> size<00:03:30.000> but<00:03:31.000> these<00:03:31.360> appear<00:03:31.690> to<00:03:31.720> be

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:31.840 
the same size but these appear to be

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.509 
the same size but these appear to be
four<00:03:32.110> different<00:03:32.200> versions<00:03:32.799> because<00:03:33.010> at<00:03:33.400> the

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
four different versions because at the

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:35.840 
four different versions because at the
top<00:03:33.760> the<00:03:34.299> fittings<00:03:34.720> don't<00:03:34.959> go<00:03:35.080> in<00:03:35.230> properly

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
top the fittings don't go in properly

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.360 
top the fittings don't go in properly
also<00:03:36.850> where<00:03:37.299> the<00:03:37.420> SIM<00:03:37.690> card<00:03:37.720> slot<00:03:38.019> is<00:03:38.590> on<00:03:39.250> the

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
also where the SIM card slot is on the

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.090 
also where the SIM card slot is on the
rear<00:03:39.700> housing<00:03:40.230> on<00:03:41.230> the<00:03:41.320> front<00:03:41.560> housing<00:03:41.920> on<00:03:42.070> the

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.100 
rear housing on the front housing on the

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:44.310 
rear housing on the front housing on the
rear<00:03:42.430> housing<00:03:42.940> there's<00:03:43.540> no<00:03:43.780> hole<00:03:43.959> for<00:03:44.230> it

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:44.320 
rear housing there's no hole for it

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.380 
rear housing there's no hole for it
there<00:03:44.980> is<00:03:45.070> however<00:03:45.220> a<00:03:45.459> hole<00:03:45.640> at<00:03:45.820> the<00:03:45.850> top<00:03:45.970> part

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
there is however a hole at the top part

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.509 
there is however a hole at the top part
so<00:03:46.660> it<00:03:47.500> could<00:03:47.650> be<00:03:47.680> for<00:03:47.920> a<00:03:47.980> different<00:03:48.310> version

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:48.519 
so it could be for a different version

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:51.509 
so it could be for a different version
and<00:03:48.970> on<00:03:49.750> the<00:03:49.840> other<00:03:49.900> version<00:03:50.320> I<00:03:50.410> guess<00:03:50.440> the<00:03:51.280> SIM

00:03:51.509 --> 00:03:51.519 
and on the other version I guess the SIM

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:54.420 
and on the other version I guess the SIM
card<00:03:51.549> goes<00:03:51.940> in<00:03:52.120> at<00:03:52.209> the<00:03:52.269> top<00:03:53.010> now<00:03:54.010> if<00:03:54.040> I<00:03:54.160> put<00:03:54.340> the

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
card goes in at the top now if I put the

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.430 
card goes in at the top now if I put the
three<00:03:54.640> parts<00:03:54.940> together<00:03:55.120> and<00:03:55.660> I<00:03:56.019> turn<00:03:56.230> it<00:03:56.350> to

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
three parts together and I turn it to

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.680 
three parts together and I turn it to
the<00:03:56.560> side<00:03:56.769> and<00:03:57.040> if<00:03:58.000> you<00:03:58.120> put<00:03:58.299> the<00:03:58.390> battery

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
the side and if you put the battery

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.199 
the side and if you put the battery
cover<00:03:58.900> on<00:03:59.110> this<00:03:59.320> it<00:03:59.650> probably<00:04:00.130> be<00:04:00.250> about<00:04:00.370> 3/8

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209
