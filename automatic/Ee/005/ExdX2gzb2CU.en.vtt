00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
some glaring problem you know that we

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.590 
some glaring problem you know that we

so<00:01:16.020> we<00:01:16.260> run<00:01:16.590> our<00:01:16.950> development<00:01:17.700> in<00:01:17.970> our<00:01:18.180> elevate

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
so we run our development in our elevate

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.020 
so we run our development in our elevate
improvement<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.860> be<00:01:20.010> sure<00:01:20.220> that<00:01:20.250> we<00:01:20.490> don't<00:01:20.760> use

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
improvement to be sure that we don't use

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.010 
improvement to be sure that we don't use
a<00:01:21.060> knife<00:01:21.360> engine<00:01:22.020> so<00:01:22.950> we<00:01:23.479> we<00:01:24.479> think<00:01:24.750> they're

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
a knife engine so we we think they're

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.980 
a knife engine so we we think they're
done<00:01:25.260> we'll<00:01:25.710> talk<00:01:25.920> on<00:01:26.159> this<00:01:26.400> but<00:01:27.270> we<00:01:27.510> can<00:01:27.690> judge

set<00:02:23.870> the<00:02:24.020> boundaries<00:02:24.500> are<00:02:24.680> can<00:02:24.920> spot<00:02:25.220> the

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
set the boundaries are can spot the

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.759 
set the boundaries are can spot the
exact<00:02:26.150> estar<00:02:26.569> was<00:02:26.810> much<00:02:27.110> below<00:02:27.500> our

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:27.769 
exact estar was much below our

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:30.009 
exact estar was much below our
expectation<00:02:28.489> we<00:02:29.000> think<00:02:29.269> that<00:02:29.330> the<00:02:29.540> car<00:02:29.780> was

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.019 
expectation we think that the car was

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:33.040 
expectation we think that the car was
better<00:02:30.459> than<00:02:31.459> their<00:02:31.700> the<00:02:31.850> format<00:02:32.330> it<00:02:32.630> showed

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
better than their the format it showed

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.580 
better than their the format it showed
in<00:02:33.410> spa<00:02:33.730> so<00:02:34.730> apart<00:02:35.660> from<00:02:35.720> the<00:02:35.900> father<00:02:36.080> nunez

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
in spa so apart from the father nunez

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.530 
in spa so apart from the father nunez
important<00:02:37.370> race<00:02:37.610> for<00:02:37.880> us<00:02:37.970> because<00:02:38.239> they

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
important race for us because they

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.840 
important race for us because they
turned<00:02:38.750> abruptly<00:02:38.980> is<00:02:39.980> very<00:02:40.280> important<00:02:40.760> also

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
turned abruptly is very important also

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:42.640 
turned abruptly is very important also
to<00:02:41.030> prove<00:02:41.390> that<00:02:41.600> what<00:02:41.870> we<00:02:42.019> introducing<00:02:42.410> the

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
to prove that what we introducing the

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.130 
to prove that what we introducing the
car<00:02:42.860> was<00:02:43.400> a<00:02:43.430> step<00:02:43.730> forward<00:02:44.000> and<00:02:44.420> we<00:02:45.080> are

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
car was a step forward and we are

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.080 
car was a step forward and we are
confident<00:02:45.560> our<00:02:45.860> performance<00:02:46.519> there<00:02:46.700> will<00:02:46.910> be

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
confident our performance there will be

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.250 
confident our performance there will be
better<00:02:47.510> than<00:02:47.690> the<00:02:47.900> one<00:02:48.080> we<00:02:48.290> showed<00:02:48.500> in<00:02:50.260> its

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
better than the one we showed in its

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.770 
better than the one we showed in its
almost<00:02:51.560> one<00:02:51.920> year<00:02:51.950> since<00:02:52.940> you've<00:02:53.269> been<00:02:53.569> back

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:36.380 
feeling to win again of something I

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.160 
feeling to win again of something I
hadn't<00:03:37.310> proved<00:03:37.790> in<00:03:38.030> the<00:03:38.180> last<00:03:38.359> year<00:03:38.630> so<00:03:38.900> it<00:03:38.959> was

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
hadn't proved in the last year so it was

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.259 
hadn't proved in the last year so it was
great<00:03:39.320> and<00:03:39.709> hopefully<00:03:40.160> I<00:03:40.370> will<00:03:40.730> have<00:03:40.880> the<00:03:41.090> same

00:03:41.259 --> 00:03:41.269 
great and hopefully I will have the same

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:50.100 
great and hopefully I will have the same
feeling<00:03:41.510> more<00:03:42.079> frequently<00:03:42.500> in<00:03:42.620> the<00:03:42.709> future

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.110 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.170 

test<00:03:51.110> the<00:03:51.440> not<00:03:51.650> fully<00:03:51.950> analyzed<00:03:52.400> but<00:03:52.820> first

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:53.180 
test the not fully analyzed but first

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:55.720 
test the not fully analyzed but first
indications<00:03:53.990> are<00:03:54.740> that<00:03:54.800> everything<00:03:55.580> is

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:55.730 
indications are that everything is

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:57.490 
indications are that everything is
positive<00:03:56.000> so<00:03:56.570> we<00:03:56.690> have<00:03:56.900> no<00:03:57.140> particular

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500 
positive so we have no particular

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:01.720 
positive so we have no particular
concerns<00:03:58.750> over<00:03:59.750> the<00:03:59.780> package<00:04:00.710> introduced<00:04:01.520> in

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:01.730 
concerns over the package introduced in

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:06.730 
concerns over the package introduced in
spa<00:04:02.890> we<00:04:03.890> did<00:04:04.100> find<00:04:04.490> after<00:04:05.210> the<00:04:05.540> race<00:04:05.720> and<00:04:06.020> spa<00:04:06.410> a

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:06.740 
spa we did find after the race and spa a

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:10.330 
spa we did find after the race and spa a
reasonable<00:04:07.310> amount<00:04:07.400> of<00:04:07.670> damage<00:04:08.120> to<00:04:09.250> some<00:04:10.250> of

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
reasonable amount of damage to some of

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.510 
reasonable amount of damage to some of
the<00:04:10.430> error<00:04:10.610> components<00:04:11.360> of<00:04:11.690> the<00:04:11.870> car<00:04:12.310> that<00:04:13.310> we

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:13.520 
the error components of the car that we

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:16.510 
the error components of the car that we
also<00:04:13.670> retested<00:04:14.570> those<00:04:14.830> components<00:04:15.830> in<00:04:16.310> by

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:16.520 
also retested those components in by

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:19.210 
also retested those components in by
Roman<00:04:16.580> and<00:04:17.230> confirmed<00:04:18.230> that<00:04:18.440> there<00:04:18.620> was<00:04:18.830> some

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
Roman and confirmed that there was some

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.430 
Roman and confirmed that there was some
performance<00:04:19.459> loss<00:04:20.060> due<00:04:20.450> to<00:04:20.480> the<00:04:20.870> damaged

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
performance loss due to the damaged

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.620 
performance loss due to the damaged
components<00:04:22.190> so<00:04:22.940> we<00:04:23.090> have<00:04:23.180> a<00:04:23.240> little<00:04:23.450> bit<00:04:23.540> of

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
components so we have a little bit of

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.600 
components so we have a little bit of
work<00:04:23.870> to<00:04:24.080> do<00:04:24.230> to<00:04:24.470> make<00:04:24.590> those<00:04:24.890> parts<00:04:25.370> of<00:04:25.520> the

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:25.610 
work to do to make those parts of the

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.330 
work to do to make those parts of the
car<00:04:25.820> a<00:04:25.850> bit<00:04:26.180> more<00:04:26.420> robust<00:04:27.040> suffer<00:04:28.040> from<00:04:28.160> that

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
car a bit more robust suffer from that

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:32.710 
car a bit more robust suffer from that
