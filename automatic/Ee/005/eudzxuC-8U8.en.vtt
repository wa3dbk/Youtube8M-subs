00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
my computer so I'm just gonna hop up

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.610 
my computer so I'm just gonna hop up
here<00:00:41.250> start<00:00:41.730> up<00:00:41.850> the<00:00:41.940> dozer<00:00:42.180> and<00:00:42.570> move<00:00:43.050> some<00:00:43.590> of

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
this huge amount of land or actually

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.560 
this huge amount of land or actually
filling<00:00:46.739> in<00:00:46.860> a<00:00:46.920> gravel<00:00:47.280> pit<00:00:47.430> after<00:00:48.210> this<00:00:48.360> we're

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
filling in a gravel pit after this we're

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.779 
filling in a gravel pit after this we're
bringing<00:00:48.840> our<00:00:48.960> topsoil<00:00:49.500> back<00:00:50.070> in<00:00:50.280> on<00:00:50.430> top<00:00:50.640> of

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
bringing our topsoil back in on top of

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:53.150 
bringing our topsoil back in on top of
it<00:00:50.940> and<00:00:51.120> then<00:00:51.750> we're<00:00:52.170> actually<00:00:52.350> taking<00:00:52.980> a

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
it and then we're actually taking a

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.540 
it and then we're actually taking a
bunch<00:00:54.059> of<00:00:54.379> woody<00:00:55.379> debris<00:00:55.590> we're<00:00:56.010> spreading<00:00:56.370> it

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
bunch of woody debris we're spreading it

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.189 
bunch of woody debris we're spreading it
on<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.760> top<00:00:56.969> and<00:00:57.180> we're<00:00:57.329> actually<00:00:57.420> seeing<00:00:57.989> a

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
on the top and we're actually seeing a

00:00:58.199 --> 00:00:59.689 
on the top and we're actually seeing a
forest<00:00:58.620> so<00:00:58.800> we're<00:00:58.890> gonna<00:00:58.980> have<00:00:59.160> about<00:00:59.219> 40

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
forest so we're gonna have about 40

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:01.970 
forest so we're gonna have about 40
meters<00:00:59.850> of<00:01:00.149> forest<00:01:00.539> where<00:01:01.230> right<00:01:01.530> now<00:01:01.680> there's

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
meters of forest where right now there's

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.009 
meters of forest where right now there's
essentially<00:01:02.460> a<00:01:02.609> wasteland<00:01:03.059> leftover<00:01:03.870> from

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
essentially a wasteland leftover from

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.109 
essentially a wasteland leftover from
mine<00:01:04.260> this<00:01:04.920> is<00:01:05.129> awesome<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:05.670> this<00:01:05.760> is<00:01:05.909> just<00:01:06.060> a

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
mine this is awesome and this is just a

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:07.609 
mine this is awesome and this is just a
small<00:01:06.360> part<00:01:06.570> of<00:01:06.720> what's<00:01:06.930> going<00:01:07.110> to<00:01:07.200> become<00:01:07.350> in

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
small part of what's going to become in

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:41.120 
small part of what's going to become in
our<00:01:07.680> canning<00:01:08.070> farm<00:01:08.310> so<00:01:08.729> time<00:01:09.090> for<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.330> tractor

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:02:22.860

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
to be really honest the truth is not

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.850 
to be really honest the truth is not

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
that cool Ken would you come on over

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:34.990 
that cool Ken would you come on over
this<00:02:30.860> is<00:02:31.040> Ken<00:02:31.810> this<00:02:32.810> is<00:02:32.930> Ken's<00:02:33.170> dozer<00:02:33.880> but<00:02:34.880> the

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
this is Ken this is Ken's dozer but the

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.360 
this is Ken this is Ken's dozer but the
truth<00:02:35.240> is<00:02:35.420> really<00:02:36.320> we<00:02:36.470> are<00:02:36.500> restoring<00:02:37.010> the

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
truth is really we are restoring the

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:38.740 
truth is really we are restoring the
gravel<00:02:37.700> pit<00:02:37.880> here<00:02:38.090> and<00:02:38.270> we're<00:02:38.360> doing<00:02:38.540> all<00:02:38.660> the

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
gravel pit here and we're doing all the

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.290 
gravel pit here and we're doing all the
things<00:02:38.930> I<00:02:39.020> talked<00:02:39.260> about<00:02:39.350> it's<00:02:39.740> a<00:02:40.300> multi-month

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
things I talked about it's a multi-month

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.300 
things I talked about it's a multi-month
and<00:02:41.600> then<00:02:41.690> a<00:02:41.720> multi-year<00:02:42.230> process<00:02:42.470> but<00:02:43.190> this

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:43.310 
and then a multi-year process but this

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:44.949 
and then a multi-year process but this
is<00:02:43.459> part<00:02:43.700> of<00:02:43.790> making<00:02:44.090> the<00:02:44.209> soil<00:02:44.420> biome

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
is part of making the soil biome

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:46.660 
is part of making the soil biome
actually<00:02:45.410> the<00:02:45.530> fungal<00:02:46.010> part<00:02:46.250> of<00:02:46.340> the<00:02:46.430> soil

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
actually the fungal part of the soil

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.970 
actually the fungal part of the soil
that's<00:02:46.790> healthy<00:02:47.209> and<00:02:47.360> beneficial<00:02:47.860> making<00:02:48.860> it

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
that's healthy and beneficial making it

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:51.790 
that's healthy and beneficial making it
so<00:02:49.070> it<00:02:49.190> can<00:02:49.310> establish<00:02:49.900> the<00:02:50.900> network<00:02:51.440> under

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
so it can establish the network under

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.370 
so it can establish the network under
the<00:02:52.100> soil<00:02:52.250> that's<00:02:52.520> responsible<00:02:53.360> for<00:02:54.020> creating

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
the soil that's responsible for creating

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.350 
the soil that's responsible for creating
very<00:02:54.860> fertile<00:02:55.310> land<00:02:55.520> that's<00:02:55.790> gonna<00:02:55.940> grow<00:02:56.150> the

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:56.360 
very fertile land that's gonna grow the

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:58.840 
very fertile land that's gonna grow the
best<00:02:56.510> food<00:02:56.750> for<00:02:57.709> us<00:02:57.830> we<00:02:58.010> had<00:02:58.100> to<00:02:58.190> fill<00:02:58.459> in<00:02:58.640> this

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
best food for us we had to fill in this

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.110 
best food for us we had to fill in this
whole<00:02:59.150> big<00:02:59.830> hole<00:03:00.830> like<00:03:01.190> literally<00:03:01.700> probably<00:03:01.940> a

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
whole big hole like literally probably a

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.670 
whole big hole like literally probably a
hundred<00:03:02.480> feet<00:03:02.690> deep<00:03:02.930> when<00:03:03.200> you<00:03:03.290> could<00:03:03.410> drive

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 
hundred feet deep when you could drive

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.940 
hundred feet deep when you could drive
