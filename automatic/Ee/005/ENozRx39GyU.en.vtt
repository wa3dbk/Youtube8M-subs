00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:39.430 
everyone I had done just to speed things

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:42.000 
everyone I had done just to speed things
up<00:00:39.610> a<00:00:39.730> little<00:00:39.820> bit<00:00:40.060> so<00:00:40.540> this<00:00:41.530> is<00:00:41.710> what<00:00:41.860> we're

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.010 
up a little bit so this is what we're

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.880 
up a little bit so this is what we're
aiming<00:00:42.130> for<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:43.510> as<00:00:43.660> I<00:00:43.900> have<00:00:44.260> you<00:00:44.410> that<00:00:44.650> have

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:44.890 
aiming for and as I have you that have

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.430 
aiming for and as I have you that have
ever<00:00:45.190> put<00:00:45.520> makeup<00:00:45.850> on<00:00:46.060> know<00:00:46.450> things<00:00:47.020> that<00:00:47.230> look

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:47.440 
ever put makeup on know things that look

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.470 
ever put makeup on know things that look
easy<00:00:47.770> are<00:00:48.160> always<00:00:48.730> the<00:00:48.910> things<00:00:49.150> that<00:00:49.390> are

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:49.480 
easy are always the things that are

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.870 
easy are always the things that are
really<00:00:50.230> really<00:00:50.800> difficult<00:00:51.340> so<00:00:51.520> this<00:00:51.730> is

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:51.880 
really really difficult so this is

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:54.090 
really really difficult so this is
definitely<00:00:52.180> not<00:00:52.390> an<00:00:52.510> easy<00:00:52.780> love<00:00:53.110> to<00:00:53.230> do<00:00:53.350> but

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.100 
definitely not an easy love to do but

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.530 
definitely not an easy love to do but
it's<00:00:54.460> very<00:00:54.520> satisfying<00:00:54.820> when<00:00:55.240> you<00:00:55.330> get<00:00:55.450> it

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:55.540 
it's very satisfying when you get it

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.270 
it's very satisfying when you get it
right<00:00:55.690> so<00:00:56.110> I<00:00:56.350> recommend<00:00:56.950> putting<00:00:57.040> into

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.280 
right so I recommend putting into

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.760 
right so I recommend putting into
practice<00:00:57.720> now<00:00:58.720> what<00:00:58.990> I'm<00:00:59.110> going<00:00:59.290> to<00:00:59.320> be<00:00:59.440> using

00:00:59.760 --> 00:00:59.770 
practice now what I'm going to be using

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.630 
practice now what I'm going to be using
for<00:00:59.800> my<00:01:00.460> liner<00:01:00.730> is<00:01:01.650> one<00:01:02.650> of<00:01:02.740> the<00:01:02.920> Mac<00:01:03.130> acrylic

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:03.640 
for my liner is one of the Mac acrylic

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:04.140 
for my liner is one of the Mac acrylic
paints

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:04.150 
paints

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.300 
paints
now<00:01:04.659> I'm<00:01:04.839> really<00:01:05.110> sorry<00:01:05.290> that<00:01:05.710> I'm<00:01:05.860> using<00:01:06.040> this

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.310 
now I'm really sorry that I'm using this

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:08.580 
now I'm really sorry that I'm using this
because<00:01:06.880> it<00:01:07.119> is<00:01:07.240> a<00:01:07.270> pro<00:01:07.570> product<00:01:08.020> only<00:01:08.350> and<00:01:08.530> you

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
because it is a pro product only and you

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.190 
because it is a pro product only and you
can<00:01:08.710> only<00:01:08.950> get<00:01:09.370> it<00:01:09.490> in<00:01:09.640> pro<00:01:09.880> source<00:01:10.360> so<00:01:10.810> if<00:01:11.080> you

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
can only get it in pro source so if you

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.110 
can only get it in pro source so if you
live<00:01:11.350> in<00:01:11.470> the<00:01:11.560> UK<00:01:11.830> or<00:01:11.980> Ireland<00:01:12.370> I<00:01:12.550> think<00:01:13.060> you

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:13.120 
live in the UK or Ireland I think you

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.540 
live in the UK or Ireland I think you
the<00:01:13.630> only<00:01:13.960> pro<00:01:14.110> store<00:01:14.350> is<00:01:14.470> in<00:01:14.620> London<00:01:14.800> and<00:01:15.220> Soho

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:15.550 
the only pro store is in London and Soho

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.630 
the only pro store is in London and Soho
I<00:01:15.730> think<00:01:16.060> and<00:01:16.320> so<00:01:17.320> it<00:01:17.620> is<00:01:17.860> really<00:01:18.130> hard<00:01:18.220> to<00:01:18.430> get

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
I think and so it is really hard to get

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.090 
I think and so it is really hard to get
if<00:01:19.330> you<00:01:19.659> go<00:01:19.810> into<00:01:19.960> the<00:01:20.110> MAC<00:01:20.230> Cosmetics<00:01:20.380> website

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:21.100 
if you go into the MAC Cosmetics website

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.670 
if you go into the MAC Cosmetics website
you<00:01:21.610> can<00:01:21.850> check<00:01:22.120> where<00:01:22.960> your<00:01:23.200> nearest<00:01:23.380> pro

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:23.680 
you can check where your nearest pro

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.590 
you can check where your nearest pro
store<00:01:23.920> is<00:01:24.100> so<00:01:24.580> you<00:01:24.970> know<00:01:25.060> you<00:01:25.150> can<00:01:25.300> have<00:01:25.390> a<00:01:25.450> look

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:25.600 
store is so you know you can have a look

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.480 
store is so you know you can have a look
on<00:01:25.720> there<00:01:25.900> and<00:01:26.020> see<00:01:26.200> if<00:01:26.409> you<00:01:26.440> live<00:01:26.680> near<00:01:27.070> any<00:01:27.190> if

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
on there and see if you live near any if

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.870 
on there and see if you live near any if
you<00:01:27.550> live<00:01:28.150> near<00:01:28.570> any<00:01:28.810> pro<00:01:29.110> stores<00:01:29.380> and<00:01:29.880> also

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
you live near any pro stores and also

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.660 
you live near any pro stores and also
you<00:01:31.210> can<00:01:31.390> do<00:01:31.810> mail<00:01:32.050> order<00:01:32.440> for<00:01:32.680> pro<00:01:33.220> products

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
you can do mail order for pro products

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:34.860 
you can do mail order for pro products
so<00:01:33.729> if<00:01:33.790> you<00:01:33.880> go<00:01:33.940> onto<00:01:34.060> the<00:01:34.120> website<00:01:34.180> I'm<00:01:34.720> sure

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:34.870 
so if you go onto the website I'm sure

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:35.969 
so if you go onto the website I'm sure
you<00:01:34.960> can<00:01:35.080> find<00:01:35.229> a<00:01:35.290> phone<00:01:35.409> number<00:01:35.530> there<00:01:35.800> and

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979 
you can find a phone number there and

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:38.520 
you can find a phone number there and
ring<00:01:36.280> off<00:01:36.490> to<00:01:37.000> order<00:01:37.240> so<00:01:37.390> through<00:01:38.290> the<00:01:38.380> phone

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
ring off to order so through the phone

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.250 
ring off to order so through the phone
and<00:01:39.120> the<00:01:40.120> reason<00:01:40.330> I'm<00:01:40.420> using<00:01:40.570> this<00:01:40.750> is<00:01:40.960> because

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:41.260 
and the reason I'm using this is because

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:42.450 
and the reason I'm using this is because
it's<00:01:41.380> really<00:01:41.590> liquidy<00:01:41.770> but<00:01:42.190> it's<00:01:42.340> really

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
it's really liquidy but it's really

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.070 
it's really liquidy but it's really
opaque<00:01:42.790> so<00:01:43.060> it's<00:01:43.210> really<00:01:43.360> easy<00:01:43.450> to<00:01:43.810> control

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.080 
opaque so it's really easy to control

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.830 
opaque so it's really easy to control
but<00:01:44.950> if<00:01:45.130> you've<00:01:45.280> only<00:01:45.400> good<00:01:45.790> kind<00:01:46.360> of<00:01:46.450> runny

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
but if you've only good kind of runny
