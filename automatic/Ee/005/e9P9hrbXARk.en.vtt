00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 Hi everyone, glad to see you on 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:07.109
 your channel and today's video will be 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:09.929
 devoted to makeup namely makeup with 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:13.969
 using a palette of sludge mask 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:19.020
 my pallet is called a compliment pln 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:22.500
 this is such a beautiful stretch in burgundy 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.060
 purple shades I bought it 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.480
 just yesterday 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.310
 tested u only on hand by and today 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:34.170
 I wanted to show you how it works 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:37.500
 directly on the centuries here such here 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.510
 its the lightest color tom to 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.719
 Unfortunately, it is badly transmitted because 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.730
 it's such a shimmering champagne color 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:46.829
 almost barely barely perceptible want 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.090
 say that this palette consists of 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.449
 four shades 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:54.660
 this shade cream shadows this one 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.640
 these are matte shadows and the darkest most 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.250
 light shade is a grass break 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:01.260
 flickering shadows this palette in my opinion 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.449
 ideal green-eyed girls 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.689
 but also on brown eyes looks very 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.460
 even interesting to test 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:12.000
 this palette with me then 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.490
 keep looking at the eyelid 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.680
 concealer but just a little base will not 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.680
 apply and lightly his teacher 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:28.080
 let's see how much they will hold 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:34.490
 without a base, I use a concealer from movie 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:34.490
 Brown first put cream shadows 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.100
 so these 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:51.440
 the shadows are well pigmented satisfied 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:57.610
 so fat and not bad but don't think 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:57.610
 hang out we will distribute 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:08.050
 I take a little bit this brush add a fold 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:19.570
 I have forever added a bit the same 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:22.470
 cream shadow on the lower eyelid on 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:26.050
 the shadow sensations are very very pleasant they 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:28.180
 soft in no way are they anywhere 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:31.030
 are going not rolling them possible 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:33.910
 calm lay down pretty quickly 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:36.790
 grasped but at the same time absolutely 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.530
 there is time to shade them so 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:44.410
 the next shade which i will 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:48.520
 use this here's a burgundy 

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:50.140
 color has a matte finish with 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:54.060
 little tassels neatly 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.060
 patting movements 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:05.350
 then he perfectly quenched does not leave 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:10.080
 no stains still want to say that they 

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:10.080
 as you see not showered 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:31.450
 I took such a not big fluffy brush 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:35.000
 and slightly shaded the color on the border 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:37.100
 as for this matte color 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.520
 despite the fact that he is matt he 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:43.040
 fine stew does not lie down any 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:46.370
 here you can see it yourself 

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:49.580
 that this color is not showered too 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:52.850
 importantly, therefore, you can safely at first 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:54.650
 make face makeup then start 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:57.950
 eyes are sufficiently the slightest indication 

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:00.440
 the color is transferred to the brush but as 

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.820
 this prilla matte color is not immediately visible 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.220
 I see in I will give that 

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:07.220
 surplus need to shake up otherwise they all 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:09.500
 will be under your eyes and gently 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:16.730
 I put it on with the same clapping 

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:21.709
 movements on the line of growth of his eyelashes 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:26.419
 outer corner and a little bit of it spreading 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:28.630
 tassel as for that color with it 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:30.580
 not as easy as with previous ones 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:34.250
 firstly he is a little 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:37.580
 showered plus it's probably a problem 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:42.500
 any purple at least 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:45.860
 I have some kind of superimposed here 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:49.090
 goals but it's basically very easy 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:49.090
 pretty fix 

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:56.029
 also put a little bit of that shade on 

00:04:53.899 --> 00:05:03.079
 lower eyelid stew 

00:04:56.029 --> 00:05:04.819
 and the last color that I will be 

00:05:03.079 --> 00:05:07.519
 use it for modeling is the most 

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:10.039
 light is such a shimmering color 

00:05:07.519 --> 00:05:13.089
 his champagne I will put it on 

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:13.089
 inner corner of the eye 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:37.450
 throw a niche neutral color here 

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:39.190
 so light from the palette gerlen in 

00:05:37.450 --> 00:05:43.060
 As a liner, I used 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:46.840
 watercolor from atelier purple shades and 

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:49.330
 put a little blue pencil on mac 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:52.690
 on the mucosa of the lower and upper eyelid 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:57.400
 also made up the same eyes as a result 

00:05:52.690 --> 00:05:59.830
 This is the makeup I got 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:03.790
 Here's my makeup turned on 

00:05:59.830 --> 00:06:07.390
 cheeks i used blush from essense to 

00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:12.160
 a shade of 20 baby doll called wind oh 

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:15.310
 lock lips, I put gloss on vivienne 

00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:18.070
 sabo is in my opinion their summer collection 

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:19.330
 me in shade number two in a tube he 

00:06:18.070 --> 00:06:22.960
 pink on lips 

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:26.170
 he was almost colorless what she wanted 

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:28.690
 tell about your feelings 

00:06:26.170 --> 00:06:33.460
 after i used these shadows 

00:06:28.690 --> 00:06:36.640
 already directly in front of the shadow here 

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:39.190
 at the moment I liked them they 

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:42.780
 very soft very silky very 

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:45.400
 well pigmented as for 

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:47.380
 the moment how much these shadows hold on 

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:50.100
 centuries at the moment I can not say 

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:52.300
 I think I will tell about this next video 

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:55.540
 there will be a shopping video 

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:58.390
 there I will certainly mention this 

00:06:55.540 --> 00:07:01.210
 a palette and also tell you how long 

00:06:58.390 --> 00:07:04.630
 it lasted before my eyes 

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:07.510
 I remind you that I applied them without a base 

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:09.760
 just powdered iveco 

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:11.650
 I hope this video turned out to be someone. 

00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:15.180
 useful to everyone thank you so much for 

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:15.180
 attention and see you soon
