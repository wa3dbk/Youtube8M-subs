00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:10.420 
make this first and then stack it up two

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:14.459 
make this first and then stack it up two
more<00:00:10.690> right<00:00:11.379> so<00:00:11.410> you've<00:00:11.799> got<00:00:11.850> two<00:00:13.230> to<00:00:14.230> four

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:14.469 
more right so you've got two to four

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:19.109 
more right so you've got two to four
bricks<00:00:15.330> on<00:00:16.440> single<00:00:17.440> bricks<00:00:17.680> then<00:00:18.400> put<00:00:19.029> it

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:19.119 
bricks on single bricks then put it

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:23.669 
bricks on single bricks then put it
stack<00:00:19.720> it<00:00:19.900> up<00:00:19.990> to<00:00:20.619> five<00:00:21.070> so<00:00:21.519> you<00:00:21.580> got<00:00:22.050> one<00:00:23.050> two

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:23.679 
stack it up to five so you got one two

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:28.429 
stack it up to five so you got one two
three<00:00:24.009> four<00:00:24.970> five<00:00:25.599> right<00:00:26.109> so<00:00:26.380> up<00:00:26.619> five<00:00:27.279> and

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:28.439 
three four five right so up five and

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.790 
three four five right so up five and
loser<00:00:29.439> got<00:00:29.919> it<00:00:30.119> to<00:00:31.119> make<00:00:31.269> the<00:00:31.449> bottom<00:00:31.630> then<00:00:32.619> you

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:32.800 
loser got it to make the bottom then you

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.810 
loser got it to make the bottom then you
put<00:00:33.040> the<00:00:34.440> four<00:00:35.440> bricks<00:00:35.770> on<00:00:35.980> the<00:00:36.010> end<00:00:36.250> of<00:00:36.340> it<00:00:36.520> and

00:00:36.810 --> 00:00:36.820 
put the four bricks on the end of it and

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.200 
put the four bricks on the end of it and
a<00:00:37.090> big<00:00:37.270> green<00:00:37.540> one<00:00:37.780> and<00:00:38.230> then<00:00:38.680> put<00:00:39.030> what<00:00:40.030> you've

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:40.210 
a big green one and then put what you've

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.540 
a big green one and then put what you've
already<00:00:40.420> just<00:00:40.870> made<00:00:41.080> put<00:00:41.650> that<00:00:42.040> over<00:00:42.310> the<00:00:42.520> top

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:42.550 
already just made put that over the top

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:46.920 
already just made put that over the top
of<00:00:42.880> it<00:00:42.970> and<00:00:43.150> squash<00:00:43.450> it<00:00:43.510> down<00:00:45.570> so<00:00:46.570> you<00:00:46.630> should

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:46.930 
of it and squash it down so you should

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:53.220 
of it and squash it down so you should
have<00:00:47.290> a<00:00:47.650> bottom<00:00:48.370> and<00:00:48.580> a<00:00:49.270> top<00:00:51.210> thing<00:00:52.210> so<00:00:53.080> that

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:53.230 
have a bottom and a top thing so that

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.600 
have a bottom and a top thing so that
that's<00:00:53.680> your<00:00:53.830> base<00:00:54.040> of<00:00:54.280> your<00:00:54.430> money<00:00:54.670> box<00:00:56.610> next

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:57.610 
that's your base of your money box next

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:02.160 
that's your base of your money box next
you<00:00:57.790> put<00:00:58.060> two<00:00:58.830> black<00:00:59.830> black<00:01:00.220> pieces<00:01:00.520> on<00:01:00.910> a<00:01:01.330> four

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.170 
you put two black black pieces on a four

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.179 
you put two black black pieces on a four
black<00:01:02.800> piece<00:01:03.130> and<00:01:03.659> put<00:01:04.659> it<00:01:04.780> on<00:01:04.930> the<00:01:05.740> base<00:01:06.159> of

00:01:06.179 --> 00:01:06.189 
black piece and put it on the base of

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:18.149 
black piece and put it on the base of
your<00:01:07.710> face<00:01:14.640> on<00:01:15.640> its<00:01:15.999> own<00:01:16.210> pieces<00:01:17.109> and<00:01:17.710> put<00:01:17.859> one

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:18.159 
your face on its own pieces and put one

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:21.749 
your face on its own pieces and put one
on<00:01:18.310> each<00:01:18.460> side<00:01:19.090> so<00:01:19.420> you<00:01:20.259> should<00:01:20.619> have<00:01:21.399> that

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:21.759 
on each side so you should have that

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:26.520 
on each side so you should have that
afterwards<00:01:23.280> now<00:01:24.280> we're<00:01:24.549> gonna<00:01:24.670> make<00:01:25.530> some

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
afterwards now we're gonna make some

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.260 
afterwards now we're gonna make some
more<00:01:26.649> in<00:01:26.770> the<00:01:26.859> sliding<00:01:27.340> pieces<00:01:27.850> so<00:01:28.119> you<00:01:28.149> put

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
more in the sliding pieces so you put

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.760 
more in the sliding pieces so you put
sliding<00:01:31.270> pieces<00:01:31.630> on<00:01:31.810> a<00:01:32.189> 2<00:01:33.189> by<00:01:33.340> 6<00:01:33.369> brick<00:01:34.240> and

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
sliding pieces on a 2 by 6 brick and

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.730 
sliding pieces on a 2 by 6 brick and
flip<00:01:35.770> them<00:01:35.920> all<00:01:36.069> together<00:01:36.280> and<00:01:36.759> then<00:01:37.740> we're

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
flip them all together and then we're

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.940 
flip them all together and then we're
gonna<00:01:38.889> do<00:01:39.130> the<00:01:39.249> same<00:01:39.460> thing<00:01:39.670> but<00:01:39.850> on<00:01:39.969> a<00:01:40.030> 4<00:01:40.630> by<00:01:40.840> 6

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
gonna do the same thing but on a 4 by 6

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.190 
gonna do the same thing but on a 4 by 6
days<00:01:41.950> you're<00:01:42.700> gonna<00:01:42.819> put<00:01:43.119> some<00:01:43.630> more<00:01:43.749> sliding

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
days you're gonna put some more sliding

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.980 
days you're gonna put some more sliding
faces<00:01:44.679> on<00:01:44.829> it<00:01:44.859> so<00:01:45.159> it<00:01:45.249> makes<00:01:47.459> so<00:01:48.869> yeah<00:01:49.869> it

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
faces on it so it makes so yeah it

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.620 
faces on it so it makes so yeah it
doesn't<00:01:50.200> matter<00:01:50.380> what<00:01:50.649> colors<00:01:51.009> again<00:01:51.399> it<00:01:52.090> just

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
doesn't matter what colors again it just

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.770 
doesn't matter what colors again it just
how<00:01:53.319> it<00:01:53.350> looks

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
how it looks

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
how it looks
that's<00:01:55.780> what<00:01:55.960> this<00:01:56.290> what<00:01:56.500> they<00:01:56.620> look<00:01:56.770> like

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:56.800 
that's what this what they look like

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:57.780 
that's what this what they look like
together

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:57.790 
together

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:00.480 
together
so<00:01:58.210> you<00:01:58.300> have<00:01:58.420> to<00:01:58.570> make<00:01:58.720> those<00:01:58.930> then<00:01:59.830> connect

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
so you have to make those then connect

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.010 
so you have to make those then connect
it<00:02:00.730> we<00:02:01.980> put<00:02:02.980> that<00:02:03.220> next<00:02:03.520> to<00:02:03.790> the<00:02:04.090> one<00:02:04.600> you<00:02:04.810> made

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
it we put that next to the one you made

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:11.040 
it we put that next to the one you made
before<00:02:05.170> and<00:02:05.800> then<00:02:06.310> the<00:02:06.790> bigger<00:02:07.030> one<00:02:09.270> then<00:02:10.270> see

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
before and then the bigger one then see

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.330 
before and then the bigger one then see
you<00:02:11.230> should<00:02:11.560> have<00:02:11.710> that<00:02:13.440> now<00:02:14.440> this<00:02:14.680> is<00:02:14.890> for<00:02:15.190> the

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:15.340 
you should have that now this is for the

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:18.750 
you should have that now this is for the
support<00:02:16.060> of<00:02:16.240> it<00:02:16.420> so<00:02:16.660> you<00:02:16.720> need<00:02:17.020> to<00:02:17.410> get<00:02:17.760> long

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:18.760 
support of it so you need to get long

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.090 
support of it so you need to get long
ones<00:02:19.060> and<00:02:19.360> put<00:02:19.510> flat<00:02:19.870> pieces<00:02:20.170> on<00:02:20.590> the<00:02:20.710> top<00:02:20.950> of

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
ones and put flat pieces on the top of

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.020 
ones and put flat pieces on the top of
it<00:02:21.250> so<00:02:21.910> it<00:02:22.030> looks<00:02:22.270> like<00:02:22.720> that<00:02:23.400> may<00:02:24.400> make<00:02:24.640> two

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
it so it looks like that may make two

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:28.890 
it so it looks like that may make two
things<00:02:26.370> now<00:02:27.370> this<00:02:27.580> is<00:02:27.820> for<00:02:28.030> more<00:02:28.209> sliding<00:02:28.720> bits

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
things now this is for more sliding bits

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.120 
things now this is for more sliding bits
you<00:02:29.080> made<00:02:29.260> a<00:02:29.290> lung<00:02:29.560> sliding<00:02:29.800> bit<00:02:30.330> the<00:02:31.330> same<00:02:32.130> on

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
you made a lung sliding bit the same on

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.840 
you made a lung sliding bit the same on
a<00:02:33.190> flat<00:02:33.820> piece<00:02:34.060> and<00:02:34.900> do<00:02:35.320> that<00:02:35.500> the<00:02:35.890> same<00:02:36.160> twice

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:36.850 
a flat piece and do that the same twice

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:41.760 
a flat piece and do that the same twice
and<00:02:37.890> get<00:02:38.890> those<00:02:39.459> two<00:02:39.880> pieces<00:02:40.240> and<00:02:40.840> put<00:02:41.230> one<00:02:41.530> on

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:41.770 
and get those two pieces and put one on

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.130 
and get those two pieces and put one on
one<00:02:41.800> side<00:02:42.160> next<00:02:42.760> to<00:02:43.030> the<00:02:43.150> big<00:02:43.390> piece<00:02:43.810> and

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
one side next to the big piece and

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:49.560 
one side next to the big piece and
another<00:02:44.860> on<00:02:45.100> the<00:02:45.130> other<00:02:45.310> side<00:02:48.360> the<00:02:49.360> same

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.570 
another on the other side the same

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.150 
another on the other side the same
that's<00:02:50.290> so<00:02:50.440> you<00:02:50.530> should<00:02:50.709> have<00:02:50.830> that<00:02:51.010> that's

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
that's so you should have that that's

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.120 
that's so you should have that that's
for<00:02:51.400> the<00:02:51.490> sliding<00:02:51.850> over<00:02:52.480> the<00:02:52.600> money<00:02:52.840> so<00:02:53.200> right

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
for the sliding over the money so right

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.400 
for the sliding over the money so right
so<00:02:54.820> then<00:02:55.060> you<00:02:55.090> get<00:02:55.330> those<00:02:55.570> pieces<00:02:56.050> that<00:02:56.230> you

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
so then you get those pieces that you

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.830 
so then you get those pieces that you
just<00:02:56.560> made<00:02:56.800> before<00:02:57.190> with<00:02:57.910> the<00:02:58.030> flaps<00:02:58.330> or<00:02:58.690> that

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
just made before with the flaps or that

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:03.810 
just made before with the flaps or that
put<00:02:59.320> those<00:03:00.100> on<00:03:00.580> one<00:03:01.540> side<00:03:02.110> and<00:03:02.980> I<00:03:03.010> got<00:03:03.489> on<00:03:03.700> the

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:03.820 
put those on one side and I got on the

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:06.390 
put those on one side and I got on the
other<00:03:03.970> side<00:03:04.290> so<00:03:05.290> it<00:03:05.350> should<00:03:05.650> fit<00:03:05.860> all<00:03:06.160> the<00:03:06.340> way

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:06.400 
other side so it should fit all the way

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.370 
other side so it should fit all the way
along<00:03:06.730> it<00:03:08.489> then<00:03:09.489> flatten<00:03:10.030> it<00:03:10.150> down<00:03:10.180> and<00:03:10.660> then

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:11.380 
along it then flatten it down and then

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.710 
along it then flatten it down and then
you<00:03:11.530> should<00:03:11.590> have<00:03:11.920> the<00:03:12.070> bottom<00:03:12.459> just<00:03:13.269> sliding

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
you should have the bottom just sliding

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.729 
you should have the bottom just sliding
bits<00:03:13.989> the<00:03:14.769> edges<00:03:15.640> on<00:03:15.910> the<00:03:16.030> side<00:03:16.350> the<00:03:17.350> bottom

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:17.739 
bits the edges on the side the bottom

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:23.370 
bits the edges on the side the bottom
and<00:03:18.209> the<00:03:19.209> five<00:03:19.450> bricks<00:03:19.750> up<00:03:20.550> get<00:03:21.550> a<00:03:21.730> red<00:03:22.390> flat

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
and the five bricks up get a red flat

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.310 
and the five bricks up get a red flat
four<00:03:23.650> piece<00:03:23.890> put<00:03:24.160> it<00:03:24.280> next<00:03:24.400> to<00:03:24.640> it<00:03:24.820> six<00:03:25.540> times

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
four piece put it next to it six times

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:31.140 
four piece put it next to it six times
for<00:03:26.709> brick<00:03:27.640> flat<00:03:28.150> and<00:03:28.390> put<00:03:28.780> some<00:03:29.200> more<00:03:29.350> 2<00:03:30.130> by<00:03:30.340> 8

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
for brick flat and put some more 2 by 8

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:35.310 
for brick flat and put some more 2 by 8
flat<00:03:31.570> pieces<00:03:31.959> on<00:03:32.530> the<00:03:32.739> top<00:03:33.010> and<00:03:33.510> then<00:03:34.510> turn<00:03:35.110> it

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:35.320
