afternoon you're still sure how as an

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:45.609 
element to turn that grass energy into

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:25.490 
not a not a natural diet so it's stress

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:27.460 
not a not a natural diet so it's stress
on<00:04:25.730> the<00:04:25.850> animal<00:04:26.240> and<00:04:26.360> that's<00:04:26.540> that's<00:04:27.110> the

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
on the animal and that's that's the

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.860 
on the animal and that's that's the
issue<00:04:27.590> and<00:04:28.070> and<00:04:28.490> then<00:04:28.850> most<00:04:29.150> all<00:04:29.420> of<00:04:29.450> me<00:04:29.690> the

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:29.870 
issue and and then most all of me the

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:32.890 
issue and and then most all of me the
United<00:04:30.260> States<00:04:30.440> has<00:04:30.710> been<00:04:31.010> given<00:04:31.370> the<00:04:31.900> steroid

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:32.900 
United States has been given the steroid

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:34.750 
United States has been given the steroid
implants<00:04:33.440> or<00:04:33.560> hormone<00:04:33.919> implants<00:04:34.490> to<00:04:34.610> make

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:34.760 
implants or hormone implants to make

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:37.240 
implants or hormone implants to make
them<00:04:34.880> grow<00:04:35.060> faster<00:04:35.090> and<00:04:35.780> those<00:04:36.320> Rascals<00:04:37.040> kill

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
them grow faster and those Rascals kill

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:39.670 
them grow faster and those Rascals kill
the<00:04:37.430> flavor<00:04:37.730> the<00:04:38.360> real<00:04:38.570> issue<00:04:38.600> here<00:04:38.960> is<00:04:39.350> as<00:04:39.530> the

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 
the flavor the real issue here is as the

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.290 
the flavor the real issue here is as the
fact<00:04:39.860> that<00:04:39.980> we<00:04:40.190> feed<00:04:40.430> the<00:04:40.610> cow<00:04:40.790> something

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
fact that we feed the cow something

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:42.970 
fact that we feed the cow something
unnatural<00:04:41.660> and<00:04:42.200> then<00:04:42.380> have<00:04:42.620> to<00:04:42.770> compensate

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:42.980 
unnatural and then have to compensate

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:45.159 
unnatural and then have to compensate
for<00:04:43.850> that<00:04:43.880> with<00:04:44.240> hormones<00:04:44.750> and<00:04:45.050> other

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:45.169 
for that with hormones and other

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:46.570 
for that with hormones and other
treatments<00:04:45.800> and<00:04:45.919> things<00:04:46.070> like<00:04:46.160> that<00:04:46.220> rather

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:46.580 
treatments and things like that rather

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:48.400 
treatments and things like that rather
than<00:04:46.730> just<00:04:47.360> letting<00:04:47.570> the<00:04:47.720> cow<00:04:47.840> be<00:04:48.050> natural

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:48.410

a<00:04:59.900> bushel<00:05:00.200> I<00:05:00.320> mean<00:05:00.470> it's<00:05:00.620> just<00:05:00.710> we're<00:05:01.400> going<00:05:01.490> to

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:01.580 
a bushel I mean it's just we're going to

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.460 
a bushel I mean it's just we're going to
see<00:05:01.760> and<00:05:01.880> figure<00:05:02.120> out<00:05:02.150> the<00:05:02.480> mother<00:05:02.870> said<00:05:03.290> this

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:03.470 
see and figure out the mother said this

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:04.659 
see and figure out the mother said this
thing<00:05:03.620> pretty<00:05:03.830> well<00:05:03.890> figured<00:05:04.190> out<00:05:04.400> for<00:05:04.580> the

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:04.669 
thing pretty well figured out for the

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:06.130 
thing pretty well figured out for the
first<00:05:04.880> you<00:05:05.150> know<00:05:05.210> hundred<00:05:05.570> thousand<00:05:05.960> years
