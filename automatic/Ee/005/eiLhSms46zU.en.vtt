something<00:06:15.569> quite<00:06:15.869> interesting<00:06:16.169> during<00:06:17.009> an

00:06:17.119 --> 00:06:17.129 
something quite interesting during an

00:06:17.129 --> 00:06:19.159 
something quite interesting during an

00:06:35.179 --> 00:06:35.189 
see I'm by Jiminy Cricket so it will

00:06:35.189 --> 00:06:36.949 
see I'm by Jiminy Cricket so it will
make<00:06:35.399> it<00:06:35.430> it<00:06:35.729> would<00:06:35.759> make<00:06:36.029> sense<00:06:36.059> to<00:06:36.689> see

00:06:36.949 --> 00:06:36.959 
make it it would make sense to see

00:06:36.959 --> 00:06:39.230 
make it it would make sense to see
wanted<00:06:37.529> available<00:06:38.009> I<00:06:38.219> would<00:06:38.999> guess<00:06:39.209> that

00:06:39.230 --> 00:06:39.240 
wanted available I would guess that

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:43.550 
wanted available I would guess that
probably<00:06:40.369> would<00:06:41.369> she<00:06:41.399> be<00:06:41.759> a<00:06:41.789> big<00:06:42.389> villain

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:43.560 
probably would she be a big villain

00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:45.860 
probably would she be a big villain
at<00:06:44.100> the<00:06:44.250> now<00:06:44.370> and<00:06:44.580> where<00:06:44.790> was<00:06:44.880> she<00:06:44.940> working<00:06:45.300> as

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:48.690 
obviously a lot of the stuff that they

00:06:48.690 --> 00:06:51.890 
obviously a lot of the stuff that they
do<00:06:48.900> is<00:06:49.110> in<00:06:49.350> quite<00:06:50.220> medieval<00:06:50.820> setting<00:06:51.090> back<00:06:51.630> in
