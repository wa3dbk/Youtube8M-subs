00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:57.300
 copies 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.129
 this is missing because he did not know speak 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.719
 of basketball and I can dare 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.280
 the statement practically comes 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.760
 most famous manga of this kind of 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.280
 sport 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.530
 the series was published in 1990 and 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.369

 you've probably never heard there 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.850
 in the sense I never heard it though 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.500
 in my ignorance 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:27.410
 probably if you heard it 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:31.709
 definitely called either shinbo or simbo 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:34.349
 then shinbo is fine in short this one of 

00:01:31.709 --> 00:01:35.849

 the ones we're going to see later will be 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.800
 even more because obviously if you do 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.080
 the more manga sells the more this is clear 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:01.289
