00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.950
 show how 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:12.330
 from the mug of ginger can be cooked jam i 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:14.820
 already clean climbed legs this 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.420
 see here i have a 20 degree recipe i 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:24.869
 leave under the video and pear 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:26.490
 I need 560 now I want further in general 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.920
 they need to be cleaned 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:33.570
 Well, I probably will not clean because 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:36.710
 there is so thin such a skin and they 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.180
 so accurate that it seems to me not 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.540
 it does not matter 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:46.379
 no, because then it's all a break ca 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:50.690
 like that first we need to grind 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:52.910
 ginger for that we put it all on 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:59.129
 three seconds 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:01:04.260
 the speed of the fifth open the lid and all 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:10.710
 it's ground up and so that's what happened 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:12.950
 see so he was listed we need 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:20.430

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:31.439
 our pears and so I already put 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:35.640
 and now I need to hurt them so as not to 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:45.149
 I know it needs to be cut and pulled out. 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:47.329
 from there this one here we understood we have 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.329

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:59.780

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:13.250

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:19.650
 such sugar is used especially for 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:21.630

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.540

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:28.349
