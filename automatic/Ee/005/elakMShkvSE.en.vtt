00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.380 
now what I'm going to show and talk
about<00:01:24.170> is<00:01:24.470> the<00:01:24.830> transformation<00:01:25.460> montage<00:01:26.180> that

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
about is the transformation montage that

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.240 
about is the transformation montage that
I<00:01:26.480> made<00:01:26.660> up<00:01:26.810> and<00:01:27.020> actually<00:01:27.170> dug<00:01:27.620> up<00:01:27.770> some<00:01:28.010> old

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:28.250 
I made up and actually dug up some old

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.830 
I made up and actually dug up some old
transformers<00:01:29.210> music

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
transformers music

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.180 
transformers music
which<00:01:30.929> layer<00:01:31.200> was<00:01:31.350> only<00:01:31.649> able<00:01:31.829> to

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.190 
which layer was only able to

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.480 
which layer was only able to
I<00:01:33.840> kind<00:01:34.840> of<00:01:34.870> like<00:01:35.050> the<00:01:35.170> heavy<00:01:35.350> metal<00:01:35.440> song<00:01:36.190> for

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
I kind of like the heavy metal song for

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.680 
I kind of like the heavy metal song for
this<00:01:37.260> basically<00:01:38.260> the<00:01:38.500> transformations

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:39.690 
this basically the transformations

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.510 
this basically the transformations
each<00:01:39.780> one<00:01:40.080> is<00:01:40.260> very<00:01:40.290> unique<00:01:40.620> to<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.400> other

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
each one is very unique to the other

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.240 
each one is very unique to the other
transformers<00:01:42.240> whether<00:01:42.570> you're<00:01:42.810> sceptic<00:01:43.320> on

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
transformers whether you're sceptic on

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:46.920 
transformers whether you're sceptic on

from<00:01:47.380> each<00:01:47.740> transformer

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
from each transformer

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.970 
from each transformer
you<00:01:49.200> need<00:01:49.380> transformation

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:50.980 
you need transformation

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:58.310 
you need transformation
and<00:01:51.070> I<00:01:51.250> was<00:01:51.490> actually<00:01:51.880> wondering

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.130 

in<00:01:58.560> succession<00:01:58.980> to<00:01:59.660> transform<00:02:00.660> but<00:02:00.870> all<00:02:01.020> you

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
in succession to transform but all you

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.700 
in succession to transform but all you
basically<00:02:01.470> do<00:02:01.830> is<00:02:02.070> you<00:02:02.700> hit<00:02:03.120> the<00:02:03.180> UP<00:02:04.110> button<00:02:04.410> on

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
basically do is you hit the UP button on

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.930 
basically do is you hit the UP button on
top<00:02:05.100> of<00:02:05.370> the

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.370 

briefly<00:02:10.600> is<00:02:10.870> a<00:02:10.900> control<00:02:11.500> aspect<00:02:11.920> of<00:02:12.070> this<00:02:12.220> name

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
briefly is a control aspect of this name

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.070 
briefly is a control aspect of this name
in<00:02:13.440> order<00:02:13.980> to

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
in order to

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.740 
in order to
you<00:02:15.650> know<00:02:15.770> when<00:02:16.100> you're<00:02:16.280> in<00:02:16.340> car<00:02:16.700> mode<00:02:16.910> in

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
you know when you're in car mode in

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:19.360 
you know when you're in car mode in
order<00:02:17.900> to<00:02:18.080> move<00:02:18.410> it<00:02:18.590> you<00:02:18.620> don't<00:02:18.950> move<00:02:19.160> the

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
order to move it you don't move the

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.840 
order to move it you don't move the
Wiimote<00:02:19.850> and<00:02:20.320> Nunchuk<00:02:21.320> the<00:02:21.950> control<00:02:22.370> stick<00:02:22.670> is

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
Wiimote and Nunchuk the control stick is

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:25.210 
Wiimote and Nunchuk the control stick is
what<00:02:23.030> actually<00:02:23.450> moves<00:02:23.750> it<00:02:23.990> whichever

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
what actually moves it whichever

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:26.830 
what actually moves it whichever
it<00:02:25.640> was<00:02:25.760> kind<00:02:25.970> of<00:02:26.000> let<00:02:26.150> down<00:02:26.180> a<00:02:26.360> little<00:02:26.660> bit

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
it was kind of let down a little bit

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.080 
it was kind of let down a little bit
about<00:02:27.080> but<00:02:27.440> you<00:02:28.370> know<00:02:28.490> what<00:02:28.640> are<00:02:28.730> you<00:02:28.790> gonna<00:02:28.880> do

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:29.090 
about but you know what are you gonna do

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.580 
about but you know what are you gonna do
I<00:02:29.330> didn't<00:02:29.780> really<00:02:29.960> know<00:02:30.080> how<00:02:30.230> they<00:02:30.350> did<00:02:30.500> for

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
I didn't really know how they did for

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.340 
I didn't really know how they did for
the<00:02:32.890> Wemo<00:02:33.310> is<00:02:33.550> basically<00:02:34.030> your<00:02:34.300> camera<00:02:34.810> as<00:02:35.020> you

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
the Wemo is basically your camera as you

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.520 
the Wemo is basically your camera as you
can<00:02:35.620> see

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
can see

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.070 
can see
certain<00:02:38.340> character<00:02:38.640> does<00:02:38.850> whatever<00:02:39.750> you<00:02:39.900> tell

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
certain character does whatever you tell

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.340 
certain character does whatever you tell
basically

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
basically

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.390 
basically
sometimes<00:02:41.830> it'd<00:02:41.950> be<00:02:42.070> a<00:02:42.100> little<00:02:42.310> clunky<00:02:42.640> but

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
sometimes it'd be a little clunky but

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.340 
sometimes it'd be a little clunky but
most<00:02:45.400> of<00:02:45.490> the<00:02:45.580> time<00:02:45.760> that<00:02:45.910> plays<00:02:46.120> out<00:02:46.300> alright

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:47.350

you can see the little
circle<00:02:50.200> counter<00:02:50.650> moving<00:02:51.190> the<00:02:51.760> camera<00:02:52.000> around

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
circle counter moving the camera around

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.090 
circle counter moving the camera around
