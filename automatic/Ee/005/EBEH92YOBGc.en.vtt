00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.600
This flowing water
Reflects the sun in your eyes

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:23.150
I wish you could see
The part of me that I must hide inside

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:30.790
They think I can control it
But as time goes by

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:35.560
This power's getting stronger
Who am I?

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:58.340
Will I be defined by this curse I hold inside
Could I be deprived of a life that I deserve

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:08.880
Just because life thru me a curve
I'm just a Girl, with a touch of ice

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:15.710
For you, it's easy
To be who you really are

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:35.430
I wish you could give
The true love kiss that wakes me up inside

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:43.580
But nothing can control this
And as years go by

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.860
It will only get stronger
Who am I?

00:01:48.860 --> 00:02:15.020
Will I be defined by this curse I hold inside
should I be deprived of a life that I deserve

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:26.080
Just because life thru me a curve
I'm so much more, than just a touch of ice

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:35.630
What would I give
You hold your hand in mine

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:43.260
And really live
Who am I?

00:02:43.260 --> 00:03:02.060
should I be deprived of a life that I deserve
Just because life thru me a curve

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:18.710
I'm warm inside, I'm warm inside
With not much to hide.........well...

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:23.120
Just a touch of ice..........
