at my college my second piece of advice

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.020 
at my college my second piece of advice
is<00:03:31.200> that<00:03:31.260> if<00:03:31.769> you<00:03:32.099> meet<00:03:32.280> a<00:03:32.310> girl<00:03:32.639> that<00:03:32.940> you

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 
is that if you meet a girl that you

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.909 
is that if you meet a girl that you
don't<00:03:33.209> really<00:03:33.359> like<00:03:33.630> in<00:03:33.840> the<00:03:33.930> sorority<00:03:34.169> or

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:36.640 
don't really like in the sorority or
fraternity<00:03:34.980> I<00:03:35.819> guess

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:36.650 
fraternity I guess

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.300 
fraternity I guess
and<00:03:37.720> don't<00:03:38.720> rule<00:03:38.930> it<00:03:39.049> out<00:03:39.140> completely<00:03:39.310> you're

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:40.310 
and don't rule it out completely you're

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.940 
and don't rule it out completely you're
not<00:03:40.610> going<00:03:40.909> to<00:03:41.030> like<00:03:41.209> everyone<00:03:41.689> in<00:03:42.049> whatever
