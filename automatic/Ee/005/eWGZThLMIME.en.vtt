00:00:37.509 --> 00:00:37.519 
moment is sound provision course work

00:00:37.519 --> 00:00:40.880 
moment is sound provision course work
which<00:00:38.519> is<00:00:38.690> recording<00:00:39.690> sound<00:00:39.989> and<00:00:40.320> sound

practical and technical skills in audio

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.939 
practical and technical skills in audio
production<00:00:45.239> that's<00:00:46.079> understanding<00:00:46.710> the

00:00:46.939 --> 00:00:46.949 
production that's understanding the

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:49.639 
production that's understanding the
basic<00:00:47.280> physics<00:00:47.640> of<00:00:47.820> all<00:00:47.940> do<00:00:48.199> it's<00:00:49.199> applying

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
basic physics of all do it's applying

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.709 
basic physics of all do it's applying
how<00:00:50.280> we<00:00:50.339> record<00:00:50.969> audio<00:00:51.149> so<00:00:51.539> it's<00:00:51.660> the

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
how we record audio so it's the

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.689 
how we record audio so it's the
operational<00:00:52.230> skills<00:00:52.440> of<00:00:52.710> it<00:00:52.859> applying<00:00:53.550> it<00:00:53.670> to

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
operational skills of it applying it to

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.459 
operational skills of it applying it to
how<00:00:53.940> we<00:00:54.000> use<00:00:54.210> the<00:00:54.329> program<00:00:54.780> they're<00:00:55.050> all<00:00:55.170> still

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
how we use the program they're all still

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.009 
how we use the program they're all still
in<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.769> industry<00:00:56.249> or<00:00:57.239> they<00:00:57.480> have<00:00:57.719> had

00:00:58.009 --> 00:00:58.019 
in the industry or they have had

00:00:58.019 --> 00:00:59.660 
in the industry or they have had
significant<00:00:58.739> experience<00:00:59.249> in<00:00:59.429> the<00:00:59.519> industry

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
significant experience in the industry

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.099 
significant experience in the industry
so<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.269> fact<00:01:00.449> that<00:01:00.510> you<00:01:00.660> know<00:01:00.809> that<00:01:00.989> you're

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
so the fact that you know that you're

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:03.799 
so the fact that you know that you're
learning<00:01:01.289> from<00:01:01.589> someone<00:01:02.070> who<00:01:03.030> knows<00:01:03.059> exactly

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
learning from someone who knows exactly

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.899 
learning from someone who knows exactly
what<00:01:04.110> they're<00:01:04.140> talking<00:01:04.589> about<00:01:04.650> it<00:01:05.370> makes<00:01:05.640> it

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
what they're talking about it makes it
