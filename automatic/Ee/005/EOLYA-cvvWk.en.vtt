 fc energy tv is presented to you by 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.790
 14 partners for media productions and 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.790
 web solution 

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:15.650
 so welcome, of course 

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.400
 traditionally the usual the votes 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.380
 after the game 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.939
 We do not have much time this time 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.890
 We think then who up with the vip 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:22.869
 space take it, of course, was the 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.509
 man with the mask 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:27.800
 Now we can finally recognize 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:29.330
 one has the feeling the mask I had 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.010
 still a bit stronger and somehow 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.989
 made more aggressive or so that 

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:36.290
 fetched table since every second person dreams 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:38.030
 So wanted for me this is a good 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.190
 protection for my nose and man 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.840
 more, you focus more on yourself 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.410
 So I do not really see how 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.329
 before 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.820
 and that's why I'm concentrating 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:48.020
 me better on the balls and yes with the 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.610
 Mask runs then it is good 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.550
 how much does that limit 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.899
 Thunderstorm how much that limits 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.850
 just a player is behind me 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:58.460
 I do not have to estimate exactly 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:01.910
 as it flies and yes it already up 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:04.280
 a disability at the end 1 1 0 2 1 in 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.170
 cottbus back in Bielefeld what is 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.729
 Now what about or happy more 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.590
 that you got a point or at the end 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:13.000
 that you still won in 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:17.390
 outnumbered the game has seen 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.060
 ten minutes have come in well and 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.130
 it worked better after that 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:24.500
 had chances and in the second 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.500
 was half-time against the unlucky goal 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:30.740
 sleeping and yes I think deserves 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.840
 won and score with it 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.729
 be satisfied and keep your head up 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.680
 let's go on with fortuna kÃ¶ln 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.630
 how do you assess personally the opponent a 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.979
 So I do not know now but just like that 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.070
 we have to go that game now 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:44.900
 we always score points and I think they are 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.259
 aufsteiger and because the need there which 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.060
 pick up 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:49.250
 Absolutely that's what I think is healthy 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.320
 attitude many thanks to hanover three 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.740
