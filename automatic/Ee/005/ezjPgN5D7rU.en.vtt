00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:08.510
 that's the zero eg 10x ballhead with 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:10.190
 ski change plate 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:11.749
 that is a very stable google head 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:13.570
 and change plate for the stepless 

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:15.889
 panning and tilting the camera 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:16.789
 I can now just from the top 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:18.350
 So we have the here once 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:19.970
 quick release plate on the 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:21.529
 top hero then the camera later 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:24.349
 is still attached is tried that is 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:25.880
 are so small inserts we have to 

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:27.410
 a so that the camera is not good 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.640
 is sold and on the other hand with it 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.050
 the camera on the fast changes 

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.880
 had has a slightly better grip 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.350
 It is very important when turning then 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.840
 when attaching the camera plate to the 

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.590
 Camera bottom then we come 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.149
 once the first 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.320
 closing mechanism that turns it 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:41.239
 screw we have here we 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.629
 just open easily and then 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:45.350
 you can just live out the card what 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:47.030
 is that ? 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.219
 Of course not a security 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.899
 built there is a small pin of 

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:52.760
 prevents us from having the camera on the camera 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:54.829
 Tripod head is fixed the cameras above 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.789
 on the fact that we are in case of a fall 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:57.140
 that they might be is simply the 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:59.149
 Camera does not hold us for example 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.890
 solve the plate now or you can 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:02.239
 want to go out you can all stop 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.020
 not quite camera to the ground 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:07.310
 collect what is what is behind it 

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:09.500
 I just do it all 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.159
 So we have a little here 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.170
 pin code 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:14.060
 because pushing upwards could be so 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.560
 to see it a little better and the 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.060
 i can only disable it so to speak 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.810
 if I have this red pin on the here 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.579
 press side 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.990
 then disappears down and then 

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:22.549
 I can also get the fastest card 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.150
 Just take it out without it now 

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:25.820
 up 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.650
 in the mechanism completely too 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.509
 has to screw to pick them up so 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.509
 That's how it is in practice 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:34.070
 now firmly stare at the 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:35.659
 that means having to be secure all the time 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:37.640
 the whole thing goes forward but it works 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:39.020
 not entirely out of here now to 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.509
 So I have to remove the plate altogether 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:43.299
 this particle and here I can the 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:45.829
 simply take out the quick release plate 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:47.030
 very simple thing to attach 

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:49.759
 the same thing about this mechanism 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.680
 Mechanism overcomes heavy word too 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:52.939
 simply push here to pin the 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.890
 quick change plate over it over 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:56.840
 let go of this point and here 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.030
 fix the side again that the 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.560
 plate anyway that show more 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.969
 we have this way up here 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.170
 a spirit level so a little the 

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:04.880
 balls with it all right 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.500
 can align what I really great 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.450
 if we find this notch for 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.100
 by the way, the hofheimer christening names der 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.560
 Kugelkopf will be here with this 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.640
 screw solved 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.200
 you can just do it all the way to the side 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:16.989
 Pan here would be the camera now 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.840
 then fix it all again and it 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:20.770
 I 'm up here in this river 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.940
 mechanism for this exchange plate 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.349
 is also a dragonfly 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.120
 built that means I can also 

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:27.580
 when I put the camera in portrait mode 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.620
 the tripod head here on the 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.900
 Tripod I can still here the whole 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.519
 then with a little enemy bag then here 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.989
 just set it then everything is in the lot 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:36.700
 and everything is straight and above all 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:37.510
 also the crack horizons if they 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.430
 still thank 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.599
 that's just not small 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.920
 story you so extra 

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:43.959
 has been attached so I think so 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.010
 very class in which also a group that 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:48.340
 here we have solved here at the side 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:50.200
 even a second he league is so 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.670
 responsible for the faction here 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.440
 is the resistance of the here 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:55.810
 that means if they are now 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.099
 have heavy equipment on it up here 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.870
 and for example as a simpler the 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:59.830
 position change something forward 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.690
 Of course they have one too 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.489
 certain power then practically yes 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.989
 always want to bottom that's just 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:07.299
 the problem what would be as earthlings 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:08.500
 Gravity you know here 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:09.760
 I then just then the resistance 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.260
 adjust so that the whole stop just 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.580
 also a little gentler and goes 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.000
 I do not do it right now , then always 

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.620
 everything has to hold on here 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.239
 action so the resistance is given 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.950
 then set exactly 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:21.790
 Of course, I can turn that far 

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:25.030
 that I do not move anything here anymore 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.500
 or I like okay so that's it 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.359
 a beautiful student resisted now 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.470
 of course without a camera or too 

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:30.640
 stop just the same accordingly 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.660
 strength I can over here so 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.069
 hire this opponent 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.359
 they have to do that in their own 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:36.250
 camera with her own one could 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:38.620
 It always depends on what you do 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.090
 then have all the other battery grip 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.709
 she still a big objective and then 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.350
 the camera itself , I want that too 

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:46.769
 all then loose a few kilos of cinema 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.920
 Under citation thus here completely 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:49.150
 modest 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.519
 So this ballhead is 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:53.560
 actually up to a maximum of 18 kilos 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:54.850
 heavy equipment designed so that 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.350
 there is already a lot there you have to 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:57.459
 through which a lot of wood is made in the 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:59.829
 The rule of the banks is actually weight 

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:02.230
 but not quite good, you know that 

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:04.750
 you could have it down here then 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.040
 one more little button 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.450
 on such a regulator is for it 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.459
 We have such a mark 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:12.190
 is out of her for this degree pay the 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:13.750
 here the way around this ball head plate 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.030
 that means I can do so 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.229
 here also exactly in these units and 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.269
 He made his 30s steps 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:19.319
 to adjust 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:21.629
 like you have here now , for example 

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:23.789
 then I would like to take a panorama picture 

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:26.610
 is called first photo at 60 degrees then turn 

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:28.199
 I stop the whole at 90 to 120 or 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:29.520
 just then accordingly with the 

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:31.080
 you still intervene 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.819
 engraved are not a problem at all 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.310
 logically on the bottom 

00:04:32.819 --> 00:04:36.690
 we then here the eight inch thread what 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.900
 I also want to mention this is the 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:41.610
 scope of supply here, too, of course 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.770
 the quick change plate one 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:46.020
 camera also standard 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.699
 so to speak, included an immune protection 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.139
 Being down there she can of course 

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:50.400
 even if they no longer decide 

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:51.539
 also want to have it easy 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.710
 here a screwdriver in the or 

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:54.630
 just has somehow just such a 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.740
 Small ten cents coin or something is 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:58.259
 So again a normal one 

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:05.580
 step milled I do the whole 

00:04:58.259 --> 00:05:06.919
 So that's the july's go anyway 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:10.080
 Ball head with the quick release plate 

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:11.969
 and as I said maximum load capacity 18 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:14.069
 kilo very high quality processed very 

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:15.449
 very smoothly and he allows 

00:05:14.069 --> 00:05:16.949
 So a real precise 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:18.419
 camera work for example 

00:05:16.949 --> 00:05:19.949
 is not completely uninteresting for 

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:22.380
 People then maybe with their 

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:23.880
 Of course, synonymous ddr wants to film 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:25.440
 the infection story all over 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.270
 This is just the opportunity for us 

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:29.969
 Resistance then adjust so that one 

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:31.289
 against it with a little force and then 

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:33.240
 but has him, for example , whom we have 

00:05:31.289 --> 00:05:34.560
 really a gentle kameraschwenk 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.779
 without somehow blurred 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:41.180
 can do great things great 

00:05:36.779 --> 00:05:41.180
 Product of the G10 ball head
