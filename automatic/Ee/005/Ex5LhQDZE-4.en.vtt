00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.459 

I<00:00:00.060> feel<00:00:00.329> like<00:00:00.450> everything<00:00:00.900> is<00:00:00.989> randomized

00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:01.469 
I feel like everything is randomized

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:03.740 
I feel like everything is randomized
about<00:00:01.740> it<00:00:01.890> so<00:00:02.070> you<00:00:02.370> can<00:00:02.550> run<00:00:02.700> to<00:00:02.909> Legendary's

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
about it so you can run to Legendary's

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.630 
about it so you can run to Legendary's
in<00:00:03.870> the<00:00:03.929> wild<00:00:04.200> and<00:00:04.319> suddenly<00:00:04.680> crazy<00:00:05.339> things<00:00:05.549> I

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
in the wild and suddenly crazy things I

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.550 
in the wild and suddenly crazy things I
think<00:00:05.700> that's<00:00:05.879> how<00:00:06.029> it<00:00:06.060> works<00:00:06.290> that's<00:00:07.290> pretty

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
think that's how it works that's pretty

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:08.810 
think that's how it works that's pretty
cool<00:00:07.740> actually<00:00:07.950> that's<00:00:08.250> pretty<00:00:08.370> cool<00:00:08.610> I

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:08.820 
cool actually that's pretty cool I

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.209 
cool actually that's pretty cool I
thought<00:00:09.330> my<00:00:09.750> randomized<00:00:10.260> are<00:00:10.410> so<00:00:10.620> far<00:00:10.889> I'm<00:00:11.070> not

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:11.219 
thought my randomized are so far I'm not

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:12.320 
thought my randomized are so far I'm not
gonna<00:00:11.370> spoil<00:00:11.580> too<00:00:11.820> much<00:00:11.969> because<00:00:12.120> I<00:00:12.240> know

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330

little guy here I don't think he can
hurt<00:01:57.600> me<00:01:57.719> in<00:01:57.780> any<00:01:57.840> way<00:01:57.960> so<00:01:58.799> I'll<00:01:58.890> see<00:01:59.040> if<00:01:59.070> I<00:01:59.189> have

any<00:01:59.460> cool<00:01:59.610> pokeballs<00:02:00.060> throw<00:02:00.270> out<00:02:00.329> I<00:02:00.360> think

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
any cool pokeballs throw out I think

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.410 
any cool pokeballs throw out I think
dive<00:02:00.719> balls<00:02:00.990> probably<00:02:01.469> my<00:02:02.009> best<00:02:02.250> bet<00:02:02.460> here<00:02:02.490> but

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
dive balls probably my best bet here but

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.389 
dive balls probably my best bet here but
so<00:02:03.600> this<00:02:03.719> looks<00:02:03.930> like<00:02:03.960> it<00:02:04.140> might<00:02:04.229> be<00:02:04.350> our<00:02:04.439> 66
