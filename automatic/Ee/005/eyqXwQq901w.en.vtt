00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.870
 big like today everything 

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:09.870
 game moments 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.170
 I think she was 

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:21.990
 mom jan their moments rival all 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:23.760
 take failed 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.240
 but what happened the ending yes again 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:29.570
 removing us our whip some crowded 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.570
 three 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.560
 miraton 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.140
 the match is held for a long time by the team 

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.880
 the first period is the installation 

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.800
 yes no it is not installation I will say that 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:42.620
 my blow sent Duster jacket 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:45.770
 traded most 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.450
 I will tell you the first window is not very 

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.690
 equal game was 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:54.290
 on the swing, the teams rocked themselves I think 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:56.850
 we have a majority today that played 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:59.670
 against rival from NHL 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.370
 fix the book but very worthy 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.860
 rival is a very serious team I think 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.960
 Today such a victory can those piggy bank 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.630
 bring in 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:11.479

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.909
 World Cup match is also nice 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:16.580
 Yesterday honestly operations under such tribunes 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:19.100
 very nice to score a voice arena 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.509
 blows up in applause thanks a lot for 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.720
 I would like to support further 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:25.640
 so support and tell me how much 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:28.970
 You noticed today saw this one 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.680
 Latvian style games honestly not even 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.119
 paid attention just played your 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.680
 hockey 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:35.659
 set fire to them a little bit harder played 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:38.390
 most of them were very good 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:41.750
 simulated as about the same 

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.820
 teams will gradually prove something 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:46.910
 what is worthy instead of the composition 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.710
 may learn more often this 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:51.950
 feature in our way before scoring 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.759
 cast distance they are your strong 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.840
 trait severe poisoning 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.850
 danin so happened clouds in 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.850
 most of them were playing a bunch with 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:04.479
 Cossack 7 Well, it turned out that two 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:08.830
 fold clicked please tell me 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:12.880
 Today our team failed to captivity 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:15.430
 principle offering game discipline 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:18.400
 the deletions broke us the prince game and 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:21.090
 prepare for a match good nose check 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:24.280
 well, let's discipline be removed 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:27.459
 somewhere justified somewhere not this 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.080
 the main thing is grisha again and thunder that 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.970
 said the team came on because on 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.900
 second period commanded and went very 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:37.989
 smart on nepir beret played we played 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:42.220
 Well, we 94 threw about the Bratsk 2 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:43.959
 he hid the dam 2 most of the principle 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.630
 could not say anything to the guys principle 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:49.269
 commitment on the face of that moment which 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:54.069
 created not scored he scored all 

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:57.430
 tell the difference what your team is today 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:59.700
 failed matches omsk ball home they 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:03.730
 not as active as we would like to 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:05.769
 as if moments then we had a lot here 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:08.260
 not used to tell you in the first 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:12.040
 the period was four points all and i am not 2 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:15.190
 scored before the goal 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:17.859
 actively play more confident as much 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:21.160
 there were a lot of viewers 

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:22.569
 just started but today is a lot 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.790
 there was a power struggle somewhere 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:28.560
 skirmishes near the gate tell me what it is 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:32.660
 connected but both teams wanted to win 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:37.220
 it is clear that such a tournament 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:39.620
 Well, on the water before when they felt 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:42.370
 it can still come back to the game 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:44.990
 and somewhere under the gathered and yet 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:47.750
 but in the third period when we scored 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:51.110
 second goal then third already was 53 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:53.780
 and then there was more and more like we 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:56.090
 removed the goalkeeper thought that if we score 4 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:58.850
 it is able to equalize but failed 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:01.670
 they will take the sixth goal and it's all over 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:03.470
 for the third time our team is at the cup 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:06.920
 the world here have noticed some difference we 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:09.080
 live in the classroom more than rivals, but then 

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:12.500
 there are different teams from north america 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:14.690
 completely different styles and you every year with 

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.730
 different rivals play in the past 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:19.100
 year played with Canadians, too, they beat 

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:21.140
 thats but he is a completely different opponent more 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:23.450
 technical team and with them hard 

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:26.530
 play they ride well and well 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:26.530
 bar from playing out
