00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.280 
back but it's going to be better than we
saw<00:02:51.939> in<00:02:52.180> the<00:02:52.239> call<00:02:52.480> of<00:02:52.569> duty<00:02:52.599> ghosts<00:02:52.959> reveal

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
saw in the call of duty ghosts reveal

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:55.740 
saw in the call of duty ghosts reveal
live<00:02:53.560> stream<00:02:53.889> because<00:02:54.579> they<00:02:55.030> didn't<00:02:55.269> have<00:02:55.419> the

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:55.750 
live stream because they didn't have the

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.330 
live stream because they didn't have the
ability<00:02:56.139> to<00:02:56.169> use<00:02:56.439> quick<00:02:56.709> draw<00:02:56.889> in<00:02:57.040> that<00:02:57.159> live

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
ability to use quick draw in that live

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.069 
ability to use quick draw in that live
stream<00:02:57.609> so<00:02:57.849> you<00:02:58.239> know<00:02:58.329> snipers<00:02:58.750> do<00:02:58.930> look

00:02:59.069 --> 00:02:59.079 
stream so you know snipers do look

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:00.449 
stream so you know snipers do look
really<00:02:59.230> powerful<00:02:59.769> and<00:02:59.859> I'm<00:03:00.010> super<00:03:00.340> excited

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
really powerful and I'm super excited

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:02.309 
really powerful and I'm super excited
about<00:03:00.760> that<00:03:01.090> on<00:03:01.540> top<00:03:01.780> of<00:03:01.810> that<00:03:01.959> it's<00:03:02.139> gonna<00:03:02.230> be

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:02.319 
about that on top of that it's gonna be

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:04.559 
about that on top of that it's gonna be
interesting<00:03:02.590> to<00:03:02.829> see<00:03:02.919> how<00:03:03.280> satcoms<00:03:04.090> work<00:03:04.359> in

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569 
interesting to see how satcoms work in

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:07.830 
interesting to see how satcoms work in
free<00:03:04.930> fall<00:03:05.139> and<00:03:05.790> because<00:03:06.790> you<00:03:07.269> know<00:03:07.359> if<00:03:07.510> you're

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
free fall and because you know if you're

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:09.300 
free fall and because you know if you're
not<00:03:07.900> aware<00:03:08.139> of<00:03:08.200> comms<00:03:08.650> are<00:03:08.799> basically<00:03:09.069> the<00:03:09.129> new

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
not aware of comms are basically the new

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:10.800 
not aware of comms are basically the new
UAVs<00:03:09.760> instead<00:03:10.150> of<00:03:10.269> throwing<00:03:10.389> them<00:03:10.510> in<00:03:10.629> the<00:03:10.659> air

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:10.810 
UAVs instead of throwing them in the air

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.110 
UAVs instead of throwing them in the air
you<00:03:10.930> put<00:03:11.079> them<00:03:11.200> on<00:03:11.260> the<00:03:11.349> ground<00:03:11.469> and<00:03:11.909> in<00:03:12.909> order

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
you put them on the ground and in order

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:15.479 
you put them on the ground and in order
to<00:03:13.299> get<00:03:13.510> an<00:03:13.659> actual<00:03:13.870> standard<00:03:14.560> UAV<00:03:15.069> that<00:03:15.310> we

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
to get an actual standard UAV that we

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:17.490 
to get an actual standard UAV that we
are<00:03:15.700> used<00:03:15.879> to<00:03:15.939> seeing<00:03:16.000> in<00:03:16.450> Pascal<00:03:17.109> duties<00:03:17.409> you

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
are used to seeing in Pascal duties you

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.409 
are used to seeing in Pascal duties you
actually<00:03:17.709> need<00:03:17.859> to<00:03:17.889> get<00:03:18.040> to<00:03:18.190> satcoms<00:03:18.699> if<00:03:18.940> you

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:19.419 
actually need to get to satcoms if you

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:21.360 
actually need to get to satcoms if you
just<00:03:19.599> have<00:03:19.720> one<00:03:19.870> com<00:03:20.319> how<00:03:20.530> it<00:03:20.650> works<00:03:20.799> is<00:03:21.099> it

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
just have one com how it works is it

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.219 
just have one com how it works is it
will<00:03:21.489> only<00:03:21.609> show<00:03:21.970> you<00:03:22.000> guys<00:03:22.840> that<00:03:22.900> your

00:03:23.219 --> 00:03:23.229 
will only show you guys that your

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:24.809 
will only show you guys that your
teammates<00:03:23.620> can<00:03:23.769> see<00:03:24.010> on<00:03:24.190> their<00:03:24.370> screen<00:03:24.669> and

00:03:24.809 --> 00:03:24.819 
teammates can see on their screen and

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:25.949 
teammates can see on their screen and
obviously<00:03:25.180> you<00:03:25.269> don't<00:03:25.419> have<00:03:25.510> any<00:03:25.629> teammates

00:03:25.949 --> 00:03:25.959 
obviously you don't have any teammates

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:27.449 
obviously you don't have any teammates
with<00:03:26.109> free<00:03:26.290> throw<00:03:26.470> so<00:03:26.979> it's<00:03:27.190> going<00:03:27.280> to<00:03:27.370> be

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
with free throw so it's going to be

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:28.920 
with free throw so it's going to be
interesting<00:03:27.669> to<00:03:27.940> see<00:03:28.120> how<00:03:28.269> that<00:03:28.449> works<00:03:28.689> and

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
interesting to see how that works and

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.839 
interesting to see how that works and
then<00:03:29.470> you<00:03:29.590> know<00:03:29.709> two<00:03:29.769> seconds<00:03:30.430> works<00:03:30.639> as<00:03:30.819> a

00:03:30.839 --> 00:03:30.849 
then you know two seconds works as a

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:33.860 
then you know two seconds works as a
normal<00:03:31.180> UAV<00:03:31.599> 3<00:03:31.959> satcoms<00:03:32.409> is<00:03:32.620> a<00:03:32.859> UAV<00:03:33.459> that<00:03:33.729> is

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
normal UAV 3 satcoms is a UAV that is

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.179 
normal UAV 3 satcoms is a UAV that is
faster<00:03:34.870> blips<00:03:35.139> across<00:03:35.560> the<00:03:35.709> screen<00:03:35.889> you<00:03:36.159> know

00:03:36.179 --> 00:03:36.189 
faster blips across the screen you know

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:37.979 
faster blips across the screen you know
faster<00:03:36.579> on<00:03:36.669> the<00:03:36.729> mini-map<00:03:36.909> and<00:03:37.269> then<00:03:37.569> for<00:03:37.840> is

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
faster on the mini-map and then for is

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:40.490 
faster on the mini-map and then for is
an<00:03:38.109> advanced<00:03:38.500> UAV<00:03:38.650> there<00:03:39.189> is<00:03:39.370> a<00:03:39.519> perk<00:03:39.760> called

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:40.500 
an advanced UAV there is a perk called

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.319 
an advanced UAV there is a perk called
wiretap<00:03:41.500> and<00:03:41.680> that'll<00:03:41.979> actually<00:03:42.189> take<00:03:42.849> enemy

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:43.329 
wiretap and that'll actually take enemy

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:45.449 
wiretap and that'll actually take enemy
satcoms<00:03:43.840> and<00:03:44.079> act<00:03:44.349> as<00:03:44.590> your<00:03:44.769> own<00:03:44.919> when<00:03:45.159> you<00:03:45.189> put

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
satcoms and act as your own when you put

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:47.249 
satcoms and act as your own when you put
out<00:03:45.489> a<00:03:45.579> calm<00:03:46.000> so<00:03:46.209> that<00:03:46.419> might<00:03:46.900> be<00:03:46.930> a<00:03:47.079> very

00:03:47.249 --> 00:03:47.259 
out a calm so that might be a very

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:49.259 
out a calm so that might be a very
important<00:03:47.979> part<00:03:48.099> going<00:03:48.489> into<00:03:48.699> free<00:03:49.030> for<00:03:49.209> all

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:49.269 
important part going into free for all
