 because the trapeze is part of ours 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.769
 life was then added to the trapeze 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.870

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.540
 as much as you can 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:52.110
 aligns tradition 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:54.150
 depends on whether this record I know that 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.100
 of which they spoke to me four times over 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.920
