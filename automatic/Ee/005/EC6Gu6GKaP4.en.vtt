00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
know if somebody's tested that and

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.180 
know if somebody's tested that and
really<00:01:39.270> can<00:01:39.960> say<00:01:40.230> one<00:01:40.470> way<00:01:40.620> or<00:01:40.650> another<00:01:40.770> please

let me know but my thought is if you're
confusing<00:01:44.820> people<00:01:45.150> to<00:01:45.900> click<00:01:46.020> on<00:01:46.260> your

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
confusing people to click on your

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
adsense earnings are going to go down

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.210 
adsense earnings are going to go down
because<00:01:50.670> it's<00:01:50.940> not<00:01:51.150> good<00:01:51.479> traffic<00:01:51.920> like<00:01:52.920> if

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
because it's not good traffic like if

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.340 
because it's not good traffic like if
people<00:01:53.760> know<00:01:53.940> it's<00:01:54.150> an<00:01:54.270> ad<00:01:54.510> and<00:01:54.540> they<00:01:54.960> say<00:01:55.140> yeah

people know it's an ad and they say yeah

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.110 
people know it's an ad and they say yeah
you<00:01:55.410> know<00:01:55.740> that<00:01:55.920> interests<00:01:56.460> me<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:56.880> then<00:01:56.970> they

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:57.120 
you know that interests me and then they

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.850
