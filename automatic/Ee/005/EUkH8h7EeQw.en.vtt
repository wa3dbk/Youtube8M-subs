00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:10.920
 hello to everyone here valentin 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.929
 for the chain 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.389
 andrÃ© 20 years old and today the subject of 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.529
 the video will be a boxing man 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.410
 so we are Christmas morning 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:23.580
 we just received gifts and that 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:26.000
 it is the package of cuba schools status is 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.349
 what we ordered 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.150
 only occupies that ordered for christmas 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:38.730
 inside so we're going to open it all 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:39.719
 right away it's gone this so yes it 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:45.989
 it seems that it happened quickly 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:47.989
 I remember the kind we go super 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:52.140
 so I pulled it all out then 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:57.149
 down we'll start right then 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:01:00.289
 start with 1st 3 x 3 seconds she 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.289
 for the senate 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.380
 then also the type 5 c while 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.280
 it was super long time he came out 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.280
 but I absolutely wanted 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:15.860
 it 's okay it's not bad I 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:17.630
 find that she has heard but not bad you 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.460
 it shows it was him bruce is there 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.759
 is good as sedan does not return 

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:25.190
 really but he was free and proud 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:27.200
 really great liar as it's called 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:30.979
 not use the marketing cor 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.090
 she is not great but when I think 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:35.750
 that maybe it could come my 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:45.409
 itunes so we will make a revolution then 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:47.360
 anyway I find a little bit a 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:48.950
 little bit hard actually I find that my 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.300
 opinion five years ago it had to be a 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.340
 very very good cube but I find that 

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.729
 now maybe who competed 

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.860
 moreover, perhaps, that yes 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:02:00.050
 maybe the marketing body was 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:03.649
 a little hard good so there the map what 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:05.000
 michael i ordered stickers finally 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:06.380
 we ordered stickers 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.479
 so that's the stickers wet or 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.780
 with them that their yume words chains 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:14.060
 for a long time because actually for 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.959
 my long art the stickers starts to 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:19.670
 to be a little damaged 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:21.790
 so I took the stickers and 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:29.920
 to be able to replace them 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:29.920
 and here's some lubricant 

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:33.470
 so that's from tuesday to sunday actually 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.599
 Looks a little milk to the interior 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:40.310
 find that's it we ordered two of you 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:41.830
 see there we never ordered we know 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.470
 not how long it lasts 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:48.489
 we'll see we'll see how 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.959
 it then happens the main subject 

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:54.060
 this one is for me it's my first 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:56.580
 6 x 6 it's my 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:01.470
 like that we at the collection of 2 x 2 to 6 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:03.690
 times six months it looks like nothing can 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:05.760
 king the cow he is very lubricated he is 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.890
 very fat on it no I do not know 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.930
 normal years of the impression that it shines 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.459
 we feel that it was the proud break and 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.080
 he had a heavy hand on leasing 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.519
 not paid yes so yes it's a 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:19.880
 champion or six times this singer forgets to 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:19.880
 specify I then I lose a few turn 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:28.220
 top and middle choices I'm not going to 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:38.400
 touch for now I have not yet 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:39.810
 mixed but tweets on bath and I 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.400
 found a bit hard but in my opinion it's 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.830
 a very good 6 x 6 because I do not know 

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:47.190
 I did not test them at ouchy but he did 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:49.500
 the air looks good anyway for a 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:51.930
 6 x 6 so a little bit hard but after 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.799
 I think as time goes by 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:54.799
 it's going to get better 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:03.720
 it will be 1 5 times 5 and 6 of the mark 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:06.750
 wets it's the word you out chang the 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:09.120
 new 5 x 5 2 at moe ue the only 5 x 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:13.920
 5 2 at moe ue even he too is the 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:18.870
 mine is pretty go ahead go do it on 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:22.560
 first time I've understood it 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:34.620
 is series it's day and night 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:37.500
 with the wood okay it's the day and 

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:43.710
 the night with my old shengchu 5 x 5 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:44.669
 watts well that's my old my old 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:46.500
 mind 5.5 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:51.350
 so it's a sign or 5 times 5 not fashion 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:55.160
 and he was not bad anyway 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:58.080
 but we really feel the difference 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:59.729
 after him he pops me but very rarely 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.260
 after I have the impression that he has 

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:04.650
 look a little bit more 12 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:06.150
 dallaire already enough loosen him after 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:07.289
 I think that kind of cube that will me 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:14.880
 pop and more easily in the hands 

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:19.440
 but to see level that in marketing that 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:24.090
 marketing anyway better than it's the 

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:33.740
 result I will surely make a 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:33.740
 comparison between the shanxi 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:39.300
 here we are 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:42.080
 well, if that's all for this 

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:49.759
 Christmas here 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:52.819
 our five objects so reminds of 

00:05:49.759 --> 00:05:57.169
 my free wheel stickers a site x 6 

00:05:52.819 --> 00:06:00.500
 km under a to ochang 5 x 5 and 1 3 x 3 wii 

00:05:57.169 --> 00:06:02.569
 tdm type c 5 that's pretty cool blow 

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:03.289
 we are doing here the collection of our 

00:06:02.569 --> 00:06:09.409
 dollar 

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:11.300
 five times five sets if you want it so 

00:06:09.409 --> 00:06:12.770
 you want it this cube is not eight 

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:21.219
 ditto if you want to search it's yes 

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:23.330
 yes and then 2 to 7 

00:06:21.219 --> 00:06:27.379
 everett alright that's it I'm finally here 

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:29.120
 we finally have the collection of recipes and 

00:06:27.379 --> 00:06:31.400
 timed to test full of hair from 

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:34.340
 its processes I do not think it will be 

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:39.199
 very very fast for now but 

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:42.500
 all yeah we have not even solved yet 

00:06:39.199 --> 00:06:44.919
 at 6 x 6 so far so he was 

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:44.919
 more 

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:52.110
 yeah that's right it's small 

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:53.370
 compare to 7 x 7 so that's it 

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:54.810
 for this order so we will 

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:56.970
 wish a merry christmas 

00:06:54.810 --> 00:06:58.860
 although I think this video will be 

00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:01.020
 posted a little after Christmas but so 

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:06.260
 if we are already in 2015 a very 

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:06.260
 happy new year to you and go hi to all
