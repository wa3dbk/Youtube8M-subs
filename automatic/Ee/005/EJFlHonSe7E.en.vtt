00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:06.970 
at 350 and clean up after 20 minutes are

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:09.780 
at 350 and clean up after 20 minutes are
nice<00:05:07.150> and<00:05:07.420> firm<00:05:07.660> easy<00:05:07.960> to<00:05:08.230> work<00:05:08.410> with<00:05:08.470> now<00:05:09.370> come

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:09.790 
nice and firm easy to work with now come

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:11.310 
nice and firm easy to work with now come
a<00:05:09.820> little<00:05:10.030> bit<00:05:10.210> closer<00:05:10.450> so<00:05:10.840> I<00:05:10.870> can<00:05:10.990> show<00:05:11.260> you

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:11.320 
a little bit closer so I can show you

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:14.880 
a little bit closer so I can show you
how<00:05:11.530> we<00:05:11.590> roll<00:05:11.890> these<00:05:12.070> into<00:05:12.520> lollipops<00:05:13.890> because

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:14.890 
how we roll these into lollipops because

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:16.890 
how we roll these into lollipops because
these<00:05:15.130> ropes<00:05:15.520> aren't<00:05:15.850> perfect<00:05:16.480> there's<00:05:16.750> going

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:16.900 
these ropes aren't perfect there's going

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:18.990 
these ropes aren't perfect there's going
to<00:05:16.960> be<00:05:17.020> a<00:05:17.110> thicker<00:05:17.440> side<00:05:17.890> and<00:05:18.250> a<00:05:18.340> narrow<00:05:18.640> side

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:19.000 
to be a thicker side and a narrow side

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:20.580 
to be a thicker side and a narrow side
so<00:05:19.270> we're<00:05:19.390> going<00:05:19.480> to<00:05:19.570> match<00:05:19.810> up<00:05:19.840> the<00:05:20.170> narrow

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:20.590 
so we're going to match up the narrow

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:25.080 
so we're going to match up the narrow
side<00:05:21.070> to<00:05:21.580> the<00:05:21.700> thicker<00:05:22.000> side<00:05:22.290> and<00:05:23.700> what<00:05:24.700> you<00:05:24.820> do

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:25.090 
side to the thicker side and what you do

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:28.800 
side to the thicker side and what you do
is<00:05:25.590> you<00:05:26.590> start<00:05:26.730> from<00:05:27.730> the<00:05:27.910> narrow<00:05:28.120> side<00:05:28.480> and

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:28.810 
is you start from the narrow side and

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:34.880 
is you start from the narrow side and
just<00:05:29.050> curl<00:05:29.830> and<00:05:30.220> roll<00:05:30.940> it<00:05:31.120> like<00:05:31.330> a<00:05:31.390> snail<00:05:31.900> and

00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:34.890 

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:38.160 

create<00:05:35.890> this<00:05:36.220> pinwheel<00:05:36.670> effect<00:05:36.880> like<00:05:37.810> the<00:05:37.960> old

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:38.170

create this pinwheel effect like the old
fashioned<00:05:41.010> lollipop<00:05:42.150> and<00:05:43.150> if<00:05:43.300> it<00:05:43.480> breaks

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:43.720 
fashioned lollipop and if it breaks

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.320

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:49.050 
should just kind of fit it in and then
Pat<00:05:46.660> it<00:05:46.870> down<00:05:47.110> and<00:05:47.470> then<00:05:47.740> finish<00:05:48.280> off<00:05:48.490> the<00:05:48.850> end
