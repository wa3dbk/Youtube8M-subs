00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.210
 listed and you can be a 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.769
 annotation now if you click 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.140
 tasty top will direct directly 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:40.739
 towards the knife is rather strong to say 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:42.629
 two minutes and do not tutor it let's talk 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.489
 will open in a new window and 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.520
 this video will be paused so you 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.980
 for example to watch the time 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.469
 short download we will go to 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.149
 serious things we go then on start 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.110
 to start yes because I have the 

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.180
 joystick I advise you first 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:00.420
 to have a joystick to play this 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.399
 game know that I do not I do not stop the 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.460
 god of the game it's just because 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.100
 that after the comments spoils everything 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.390
 I have the impression 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.220
 I said go we go olympics 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.570
 finally in easy because I like 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.729
 start on the game so I can very 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:19.590
 France comes the strong one will take 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:22.380
 to be french london 27 july good 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.830
 this is a good team custom test 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.170
 will do the proofs so on the choose 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.549
 two events so I take the 200 m and 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.049
 the 50m freestyle 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.439
 because it's the trials where I'm 

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:36.630
 the best I think qualification to the 

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:40.259
 final robin for the episode 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:43.200
 today we will have this done again 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:44.369
 so I'm going to do seasons of 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.600
 nostalgia when you hold us the 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.490
 first season and start now 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.560
 on london 2012 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.250
 i will see if i have more like geass 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.420
 like low then I would not change game 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.250
 ending season 1 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.360
 I will still do the episode for 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.310
 end the season because it's not 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.770
 she would be nice to do that so we 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.110
 will see the qualification so the 50 m 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.439
 free swimming I won a race just 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.160
 before 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:12.160
 so while waiting for the huillier actis yale 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:15.960
 I hope we will win 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.960
 I concentrate why miss the start 

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:22.780
 pretty good start 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:25.320
 now we see people go on 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.320
 do l and r 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.810
 Yes 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:45.150
 know we won you have white but 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:48.450
 well I was focused and put two 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:52.290
 seconds almost to the new record 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:54.150
 olympic super first race new 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.709
 Olympic record for a time of 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.689
 qualification frankly it's worth the 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.219
 trouble 

00:02:56.689 --> 00:03:01.200
 here is something that starts well 

00:02:59.219 --> 00:03:04.219
 frankly qualifies them so celine 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.599
 gauthier lucie palmer or bees 

00:03:04.219 --> 00:03:12.269
 laetitia alvarez left score in 

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:17.730
 continues yeah so skilled to follow 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:19.889
 ok what to do the 200 m men ah yeah 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:24.900
 it was nice this little race 

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:27.719
 we are left in the olympic stadium 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:30.780
 for for this wonderful event 

00:03:27.719 --> 00:03:33.090
 so my record on 200 m I do not have 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:36.689
 still done against against the 100 m I 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:39.750
 done in 2d I believe in all that one 

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:43.620
 second wines so I do not need advertising 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:50.489
 what i did is find the right one 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:53.479
 departure also so why not too much 

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:53.479
 take it here 

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:01.790
 go go go go french go 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:07.230

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:09.319

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:14.010
 the average means 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.599

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:23.510
 I think I showed you the 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:25.620
 difficulty over 

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:27.630
 what I want to see the gap that I them 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:28.770
 put anyway I put them 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.530
 three seconds so I think I'm going 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:34.400
 increase in time there to the final 

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:34.400
 it's already interesting 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:40.949

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:43.110

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:44.030
 I love them it's for me it's the 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:49.470
 best test 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:51.389
 So here is my channel 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.919

 come back from the old chain that has 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:55.620
 hugged that this heavy baggage of 

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.720
 represent a baroud for what is 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:59.510
