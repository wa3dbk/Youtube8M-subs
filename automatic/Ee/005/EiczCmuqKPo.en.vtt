name then under master Wong yeah it's a

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.150 
name then under master Wong yeah it's a
it's<00:00:12.240> a<00:00:12.450> really<00:00:12.719> unusual<00:00:12.929> texture<00:00:13.860> isn't<00:00:13.980> it

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
it's a really unusual texture isn't it

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.150 
it's a really unusual texture isn't it
it's<00:00:14.490> very<00:00:14.759> very<00:00:15.120> light<00:00:15.389> very<00:00:15.570> flaky<00:00:16.139> I<00:00:16.619> guess

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
it's very very light very flaky I guess

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.700 
it's very very light very flaky I guess
you<00:00:17.250> can't<00:00:17.460> tell<00:00:17.640> me<00:00:17.730> what's<00:00:17.940> in<00:00:18.119> it<00:00:18.150> but<00:00:18.710> over

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
you can't tell me what's in it but over

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:20.960 
you can't tell me what's in it but over
to<00:00:19.830> you<00:00:19.949> tell<00:00:20.160> me<00:00:20.189> what<00:00:20.279> you<00:00:20.430> cannot<00:00:20.609> show<00:00:20.820> me

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
to you tell me what you cannot show me

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.230 
to you tell me what you cannot show me
how<00:00:21.029> you<00:00:21.090> mix<00:00:21.300> it<00:00:21.510> well<00:00:21.960> looking<00:00:22.830> at<00:00:22.949> it<00:00:23.240> but

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
how you mix it well looking at it but

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.839 
how you mix it well looking at it but
you<00:00:24.660> know<00:00:24.810> first<00:00:25.380> impressions<00:00:25.769> you'd<00:00:26.609> think

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
you know first impressions you'd think

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.210 
you know first impressions you'd think
well<00:00:27.240> you<00:00:27.539> know<00:00:27.689> it<00:00:27.869> looks<00:00:28.050> lighter<00:00:28.410> the

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
well you know it looks lighter the

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.849 
well you know it looks lighter the
bigger<00:00:29.490> particles<00:00:30.269> in<00:00:30.539> it<00:00:30.720> you<00:00:31.080> know<00:00:31.230> then<00:00:31.470> a

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
bigger particles in it you know then a

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.520 
bigger particles in it you know then a
normal<00:00:32.040> pallet<00:00:32.759> powdered<00:00:33.390> pallet<00:00:33.780> paste<00:00:34.079> so

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
normal pallet powdered pallet paste so

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.860 
normal pallet powdered pallet paste so
it<00:00:34.680> looks<00:00:34.860> different<00:00:34.980> straightaway<00:00:35.940> but<00:00:36.630> when

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
it looks different straightaway but when

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.750 
it looks different straightaway but when
it<00:00:36.989> really<00:00:37.350> becomes<00:00:37.649> different<00:00:37.980> is<00:00:38.399> when<00:00:38.610> you

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
it really becomes different is when you

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.220 
it really becomes different is when you
mix<00:00:38.940> it<00:00:39.829> so<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:41.760> way<00:00:41.910> our<00:00:42.090> mixer<00:00:42.510> is<00:00:42.660> just<00:00:42.930> pour

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
mix it so the way our mixer is just pour

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.470 
mix it so the way our mixer is just pour
a<00:00:43.469> small<00:00:43.739> amount<00:00:43.920> in<00:00:44.550> you<00:00:44.879> you<00:00:45.059> want<00:00:45.210> to<00:00:45.270> end<00:00:45.390> up

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
a small amount in you you want to end up

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.660 
a small amount in you you want to end up
with<00:00:45.629> about<00:00:45.899> tennis<00:00:46.559> ball<00:00:46.829> size<00:00:47.190> of<00:00:47.460> pace

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
with about tennis ball size of pace

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:50.930 
with about tennis ball size of pace
that's<00:00:48.539> what<00:00:49.170> I<00:00:49.200> reckon<00:00:49.800> is<00:00:50.100> enough<00:00:50.579> to<00:00:50.760> catch

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
that's what I reckon is enough to catch

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.630 
that's what I reckon is enough to catch
something<00:00:51.239> right<00:00:51.539> on<00:00:51.570> drip<00:00:51.899> pan<00:00:52.170> fish<00:00:52.530> on<00:00:52.770> so

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
something right on drip pan fish on so

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.880 
something right on drip pan fish on so
all<00:00:53.820> I<00:00:53.850> do<00:00:54.059> is<00:00:54.180> tip<00:00:54.449> about<00:00:54.899> that<00:00:55.170> much<00:00:55.440> in<00:00:55.680> a

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
all I do is tip about that much in a

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.279 
all I do is tip about that much in a
bait<00:00:56.190> box<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:56.789> then<00:00:57.420> slowly<00:00:58.170> add<00:00:58.469> water<00:00:58.500> to<00:00:59.219> it

00:01:00.279 --> 00:01:00.289 
bait box and then slowly add water to it

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:03.680 
bait box and then slowly add water to it
and<00:01:01.289> just<00:01:01.910> stir<00:01:02.910> it<00:01:02.940> around<00:01:03.210> with<00:01:03.570> your

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
and just stir it around with your

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.980 
and just stir it around with your
fingers<00:01:04.170> until<00:01:04.890> it<00:01:04.949> becomes<00:01:05.990> similar

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
fingers until it becomes similar

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.570 
fingers until it becomes similar
consistency<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:09.530> well<00:01:10.530> a<00:01:10.560> thick<00:01:10.950> porridge<00:01:11.250> you

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
consistency to well a thick porridge you

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.370 
consistency to well a thick porridge you
get<00:01:11.760> slightly<00:01:12.090> porridge<00:01:12.540> isn't<00:01:12.720> it<00:01:12.810> yeah<00:01:13.049> not

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
get slightly porridge isn't it yeah not

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.630 
get slightly porridge isn't it yeah not
just<00:01:13.409> light<00:01:13.710> in<00:01:13.830> color<00:01:14.070> as<00:01:14.220> it's<00:01:14.369> actually

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
just light in color as it's actually

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.460 
just light in color as it's actually
very<00:01:14.820> light<00:01:15.090> you<00:01:15.600> know<00:01:15.689> in<00:01:15.990> weight<00:01:16.229> it<00:01:16.439> is

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
very light you know in weight it is

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:17.480 
very light you know in weight it is
you're<00:01:17.009> nuts

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
you're nuts

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.580 
you're nuts
that's<00:01:17.850> why<00:01:18.119> it's<00:01:18.299> so<00:01:18.479> effective<00:01:18.630> is<00:01:19.530> because

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
that's why it's so effective is because

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.020 
that's why it's so effective is because
you<00:01:20.250> know<00:01:21.320> most<00:01:22.320> pace<00:01:22.710> when<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.189> mix<00:01:23.400> from<00:01:23.939> a

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
you know most pace when the mix from a

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.090 
you know most pace when the mix from a
pellet<00:01:24.390> pays<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:24.869> get<00:01:25.049> really<00:01:25.439> heavy<00:01:25.650> but<00:01:25.799> this

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
pellet pays to get really heavy but this

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.039 
pellet pays to get really heavy but this
is<00:01:26.310> still<00:01:26.580> light<00:01:26.850> and<00:01:27.119> fluffy<00:01:27.330> so<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.840> fish

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
is still light and fluffy so the fish

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:31.010 
is still light and fluffy so the fish
readily<00:01:28.530> take<00:01:28.770> it<00:01:29.070> so<00:01:29.850> really<00:01:30.600> that's<00:01:30.750> all

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
readily take it so really that's all

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.840 
readily take it so really that's all
there<00:01:31.079> is<00:01:31.259> to<00:01:31.560> it<00:01:31.740> once<00:01:32.159> you've<00:01:32.369> got<00:01:32.549> all<00:01:32.579> the

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
there is to it once you've got all the

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.050 
there is to it once you've got all the
waters<00:01:33.240> spread<00:01:33.750> evenly<00:01:34.170> around<00:01:34.650> just<00:01:35.579> take<00:01:35.820> it

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
waters spread evenly around just take it

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.899 
waters spread evenly around just take it
out<00:01:36.240> like<00:01:37.140> say<00:01:37.409> tennis<00:01:37.740> balls<00:01:38.130> about<00:01:38.460> right<00:01:38.759> to

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
out like say tennis balls about right to

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:40.520 
out like say tennis balls about right to
catch<00:01:39.119> a<00:01:39.240> hundred<00:01:39.329> pound<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:39.869> fish<00:01:40.079> on<00:01:40.290> so

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
catch a hundred pound the fish on so

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.429 
catch a hundred pound the fish on so
that's<00:01:40.680> a<00:01:40.890> good<00:01:41.070> sort<00:01:42.060> of<00:01:42.119> sized<00:01:42.390> ball<00:01:42.990> to<00:01:43.229> mix

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
that's a good sort of sized ball to mix

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.200 
that's a good sort of sized ball to mix
for<00:01:43.530> a<00:01:43.649> start<00:01:44.009> and<00:01:44.340> you<00:01:45.030> see<00:01:45.320> it's<00:01:46.320> a<00:01:46.649> it's<00:01:47.210> a

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
for a start and you see it's a it's a

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.050 
for a start and you see it's a it's a
soft<00:01:48.479> consistency<00:01:48.990> that<00:01:49.710> you<00:01:50.640> know<00:01:50.700> it's<00:01:50.939> all

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
soft consistency that you know it's all

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.289 
soft consistency that you know it's all
together<00:01:51.299> but<00:01:52.259> it's<00:01:52.439> not<00:01:52.649> really<00:01:53.369> firm<00:01:53.640> it's

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
together but it's not really firm it's

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.870 
together but it's not really firm it's
just<00:01:54.630> the<00:01:54.869> just<00:01:55.470> nice<00:01:55.710> and<00:01:56.009> spongy<00:01:56.280> in<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.759> UM

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.760 
you know will one be cut fishing with
this<00:02:02.100> on<00:02:02.340> rod<00:02:02.850> and<00:02:03.030> line<00:02:03.210> tackle<00:02:03.780> we're<00:02:03.960> using

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
this on rod and line tackle we're using

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.740 
this on rod and line tackle we're using
the<00:02:05.040> force<00:02:05.280> of<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.579> rod<00:02:05.759> to<00:02:05.969> to<00:02:06.299> cast<00:02:06.570> the

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
the force of the rod to to cast the

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.109 
the force of the rod to to cast the
thing<00:02:06.960> out<00:02:07.170> so<00:02:07.590> obviously<00:02:08.459> with<00:02:08.759> it<00:02:08.910> being

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
thing out so obviously with it being

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.510 
thing out so obviously with it being
that<00:02:09.330> wet<00:02:09.569> it<00:02:09.780> would<00:02:09.929> come<00:02:10.170> off<00:02:10.200> but<00:02:11.129> in<00:02:11.250> about

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
that wet it would come off but in about

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.280 
that wet it would come off but in about
15<00:02:12.120> to<00:02:12.300> 20<00:02:12.660> minutes

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
15 to 20 minutes

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.550 
15 to 20 minutes
that<00:02:14.040> would<00:02:14.250> have<00:02:14.659> most<00:02:15.659> the<00:02:15.900> watering<00:02:16.379> there

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
that would have most the watering there

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.339 
that would have most the watering there
will<00:02:16.709> have<00:02:16.830> been<00:02:16.980> absorbed<00:02:17.640> and<00:02:17.819> so<00:02:18.689> that<00:02:18.959> will

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
will have been absorbed and so that will

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:22.220 
will have been absorbed and so that will
have<00:02:19.560> a<00:02:19.590> consistencies<00:02:20.579> very<00:02:21.299> similar<00:02:21.810> and<00:02:22.049> as

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
have a consistencies very similar and as

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.350 
have a consistencies very similar and as
if<00:02:22.349> by<00:02:22.530> magic<00:02:22.560> here's<00:02:23.430> one<00:02:23.670> I<00:02:23.700> made<00:02:23.760> earlier<00:02:23.939> to

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
if by magic here's one I made earlier to

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.960 
if by magic here's one I made earlier to
this<00:02:24.480> one<00:02:24.720> I<00:02:24.750> made<00:02:24.959> earlier<00:02:25.819> that's<00:02:26.819> about

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
this one I made earlier that's about

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.220 
this one I made earlier that's about
twenty<00:02:27.299> minutes<00:02:27.420> it's<00:02:27.659> a<00:02:27.810> beautiful<00:02:28.079> about

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
twenty minutes it's a beautiful about

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.990 
twenty minutes it's a beautiful about
that<00:02:28.379> yeah<00:02:28.680> yeah<00:02:28.950> twenty<00:02:29.400> minutes<00:02:29.549> probably

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
that yeah yeah twenty minutes probably

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.210 
that yeah yeah twenty minutes probably
off<00:02:30.390> hour<00:02:30.659> depending<00:02:30.989> on<00:02:31.290> the<00:02:31.349> weather<00:02:31.650> warmer

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
off hour depending on the weather warmer

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.830 
off hour depending on the weather warmer
weather<00:02:32.400> then<00:02:32.700> you'd<00:02:32.940> wait<00:02:33.150> you're<00:02:33.329> less<00:02:33.510> time

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
weather then you'd wait you're less time

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.960 
weather then you'd wait you're less time
but<00:02:34.500> you<00:02:34.560> can<00:02:34.709> see<00:02:34.739> straight<00:02:35.310> the<00:02:35.459> way<00:02:35.489> that<00:02:35.849> it

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
but you can see straight the way that it

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.300 
but you can see straight the way that it
changes<00:02:36.420> color<00:02:36.480> slightly<00:02:37.079> because<00:02:37.409> it's<00:02:38.099> gone

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
changes color slightly because it's gone

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.460 
changes color slightly because it's gone
firmer<00:02:38.909> and<00:02:39.090> it's<00:02:39.209> drying<00:02:39.480> out<00:02:39.750> slightly<00:02:40.140> but

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
firmer and it's drying out slightly but

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.699 
firmer and it's drying out slightly but
it's<00:02:40.590> still<00:02:40.829> quite<00:02:41.069> soft<00:02:41.549> but<00:02:42.349> you<00:02:43.349> can<00:02:43.530> see

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
it's still quite soft but you can see

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:45.949 
it's still quite soft but you can see
when<00:02:44.310> that's<00:02:44.549> on<00:02:44.760> on<00:02:45.000> the<00:02:45.180> hook<00:02:45.359> there<00:02:45.599> you<00:02:45.750> can

00:02:45.949 --> 00:02:45.959 
when that's on on the hook there you can

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.619 
when that's on on the hook there you can
swing<00:02:46.230> that<00:02:46.260> round<00:02:46.799> around<00:02:47.239> you<00:02:48.239> know<00:02:48.390> he's

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:48.629 
swing that round around you know he's

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:50.479 
swing that round around you know he's
really<00:02:49.109> soft<00:02:49.409> light<00:02:49.650> is<00:02:49.799> but<00:02:49.980> it<00:02:50.099> won't<00:02:50.280> come

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
really soft light is but it won't come

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.309 
really soft light is but it won't come
off<00:02:50.609> the<00:02:50.849> all<00:02:50.970> yes<00:02:51.480> tremendous<00:02:51.930> that<00:02:52.049> is<00:02:52.170> its

nature its stringy but but not to string

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:57.020 
nature its stringy but but not to string
isn't<00:02:55.470> it's<00:02:55.709> kind<00:02:55.859> of<00:02:55.920> the<00:02:56.099> halfway<00:02:56.459> house<00:02:56.819> you

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
isn't it's kind of the halfway house you

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.949 
isn't it's kind of the halfway house you
know<00:02:57.090> you<00:02:57.180> don't<00:02:57.269> want<00:02:57.420> a<00:02:57.450> really<00:02:57.629> stringy

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
know you don't want a really stringy

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.559 
know you don't want a really stringy
place<00:02:58.170> that<00:02:58.409> would<00:02:58.920> put<00:02:59.099> fish<00:02:59.310> off<00:02:59.519> but<00:02:59.760> you're

00:03:00.559 --> 00:03:00.569 
place that would put fish off but you're

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:01.819 
place that would put fish off but you're
looking<00:03:00.750> up<00:03:00.989> that<00:03:01.109> real<00:03:01.319> that<00:03:01.500> really<00:03:01.709> it's

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:01.829 
looking up that real that really it's

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:05.030 
looking up that real that really it's
you<00:03:02.159> know<00:03:02.310> that<00:03:02.549> dies<00:03:02.790> the<00:03:03.060> beauty<00:03:03.510> of<00:03:03.540> it<00:03:04.040> like

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
you know that dies the beauty of it like

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.930 
you know that dies the beauty of it like
I<00:03:05.069> said<00:03:05.310> early<00:03:06.170> before<00:03:07.170> this<00:03:07.349> was<00:03:07.620> developed

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
I said early before this was developed

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:10.550 
I said early before this was developed
than<00:03:08.940> any<00:03:09.239> other<00:03:09.480> place<00:03:09.750> that<00:03:09.780> you<00:03:10.079> want<00:03:10.349> to

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
than any other place that you want to

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.069 
than any other place that you want to
fish<00:03:10.799> on<00:03:11.040> the<00:03:11.159> rod<00:03:11.370> out<00:03:11.579> to<00:03:12.090> be<00:03:12.209> molded<00:03:12.450> into

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:13.079 
fish on the rod out to be molded into

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:15.890 
fish on the rod out to be molded into
like<00:03:13.470> a<00:03:13.500> putty<00:03:13.970> consistency<00:03:14.970> so<00:03:15.510> the<00:03:15.690> thing

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
like a putty consistency so the thing

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:17.659 
like a putty consistency so the thing
would<00:03:16.079> stay<00:03:16.379> on<00:03:16.409> is<00:03:16.829> you<00:03:16.980> give<00:03:17.190> it<00:03:17.310> the<00:03:17.340> force

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:17.669 
would stay on is you give it the force

00:03:17.669 --> 00:03:20.119 
would stay on is you give it the force
to<00:03:17.910> cast<00:03:18.180> the<00:03:18.329> thing<00:03:18.540> out<00:03:18.780> so<00:03:19.560> that's<00:03:19.769> why<00:03:19.949> you

00:03:20.119 --> 00:03:20.129 
to cast the thing out so that's why you

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:22.490 
to cast the thing out so that's why you
know<00:03:20.489> this<00:03:20.639> is<00:03:20.849> a<00:03:20.879> brand<00:03:21.660> new<00:03:21.810> breakthrough<00:03:22.470> in

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
know this is a brand new breakthrough in

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.920 
know this is a brand new breakthrough in

need is a is a bait box or it's the same
quantity<00:05:07.150> of<00:05:07.360> pace<00:05:07.840> mix<00:05:08.289> as<00:05:08.590> you<00:05:08.889> do<00:05:09.250> water<00:05:09.870> so

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:10.870 
quantity of pace mix as you do water so

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:13.920 
quantity of pace mix as you do water so
there<00:05:11.110> you<00:05:11.229> have<00:05:11.410> got<00:05:11.470> a<00:05:12.419> bait<00:05:13.419> box<00:05:13.690> full<00:05:13.870> of

water and a bait box full of pace now

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:17.939 
water and a bait box full of pace now
when<00:05:16.360> that<00:05:16.570> water<00:05:16.930> is<00:05:17.169> added<00:05:17.289> to<00:05:17.470> the<00:05:17.710> pace

00:05:17.939 --> 00:05:17.949 
when that water is added to the pace

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:20.129 
when that water is added to the pace
then<00:05:18.550> it<00:05:18.699> will<00:05:18.789> be<00:05:18.909> perfect<00:05:19.479> to<00:05:19.570> you<00:05:19.810> so

either way if you put the paste in first
to<00:05:28.120> the<00:05:28.240> water<00:05:28.419> in<00:05:28.630> first<00:05:28.960> it<00:05:29.169> doesn't<00:05:29.500> matter

00:05:32.749 --> 00:05:32.759 

00:05:32.759 --> 00:05:36.270 

and<00:05:33.759> just<00:05:34.270> agitate<00:05:35.080> it<00:05:35.320> so<00:05:35.590> that<00:05:35.860> all<00:05:36.099> the

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:36.280 
and just agitate it so that all the

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:41.490 
and just agitate it so that all the
water<00:05:36.430> mixes<00:05:37.090> in<00:05:37.270> with<00:05:37.300> the<00:05:37.770> with<00:05:38.770> the<00:05:40.349> sort<00:05:41.349> of

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:41.500 
water mixes in with the with the sort of

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:45.060 
water mixes in with the with the sort of
paste<00:05:42.460> mixture<00:05:43.090> and<00:05:43.990> you<00:05:44.169> see<00:05:44.409> that's<00:05:44.620> far<00:05:45.039> too

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:45.070 
paste mixture and you see that's far too

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:49.260 
paste mixture and you see that's far too
wet<00:05:45.550> for<00:05:45.820> now<00:05:46.419> but<00:05:46.830> when<00:05:47.830> after<00:05:48.520> sort<00:05:48.820> of<00:05:48.940> 20

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:49.270 
wet for now but when after sort of 20

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:51.810 
wet for now but when after sort of 20
minutes<00:05:49.419> half<00:05:49.840> hour<00:05:50.050> or<00:05:50.289> so<00:05:50.669> that'll<00:05:51.669> be<00:05:51.789> a

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:51.820 
minutes half hour or so that'll be a

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:54.810 
minutes half hour or so that'll be a
nice<00:05:52.060> consistent<00:05:52.900> to<00:05:53.320> the<00:05:53.740> consistency<00:05:54.370> to

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:54.820 
nice consistent to the consistency to

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:57.839 
nice consistent to the consistency to
use<00:05:55.030> with<00:05:55.990> a<00:05:56.020> with<00:05:56.500> a<00:05:56.530> paste<00:05:57.159> pot<00:05:57.430> that<00:05:57.669> we're

00:05:57.839 --> 00:05:57.849 
use with a with a paste pot that we're

00:05:57.849 --> 00:06:00.360 
use with a with a paste pot that we're
already<00:05:58.000> working<00:05:58.840> on<00:05:58.960> to<00:05:59.229> be<00:05:59.800> used<00:06:00.039> with<00:06:00.250> this

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:00.370 
already working on to be used with this

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:02.490 
already working on to be used with this
type<00:06:00.669> of<00:06:00.909> fishing<00:06:01.120> so<00:06:01.750> I<00:06:01.810> can<00:06:01.990> be<00:06:02.080> much<00:06:02.229> simpler

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:02.500 
type of fishing so I can be much simpler

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:04.020 
type of fishing so I can be much simpler
than<00:06:02.620> that<00:06:02.800> coat<00:06:02.979> check<00:06:03.250> it<00:06:03.370> in<00:06:03.490> add<00:06:03.729> the<00:06:03.880> same

quite wet day I do yeah to improve this
further<00:06:36.070> you<00:06:36.370> could<00:06:36.699> have<00:06:36.849> a<00:06:36.880> bait<00:06:37.630> box<00:06:37.839> of

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:38.110 
further you could have a bait box of

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:39.690 
further you could have a bait box of
water<00:06:38.260> on<00:06:38.589> your<00:06:38.740> bait<00:06:38.949> tray

00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:39.700 
water on your bait tray

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:41.160 
water on your bait tray
and<00:06:39.790> just<00:06:39.970> before<00:06:40.120> you<00:06:40.420> put<00:06:40.450> it<00:06:40.720> in<00:06:40.840> the<00:06:40.960> pot

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:41.170 
and just before you put it in the pot

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:43.230 
and just before you put it in the pot
you'd<00:06:41.380> mold<00:06:41.650> a<00:06:41.800> ball<00:06:41.980> like<00:06:42.250> that<00:06:42.280> you<00:06:42.850> put<00:06:43.060> your

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:43.240 
you'd mold a ball like that you put your

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:45.570 
you'd mold a ball like that you put your
hook<00:06:43.420> in<00:06:43.600> it<00:06:43.750> and<00:06:44.080> just<00:06:44.410> before<00:06:44.560> you<00:06:44.920> put<00:06:45.370> it<00:06:45.460> in

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:45.580 
hook in it and just before you put it in

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:47.910 
hook in it and just before you put it in
the<00:06:45.700> pot<00:06:45.940> you<00:06:46.060> dip<00:06:46.360> it<00:06:46.510> in<00:06:46.630> water<00:06:46.840> and<00:06:47.380> get<00:06:47.800> it

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:47.920 
the pot you dip it in water and get it

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:49.740 
the pot you dip it in water and get it
really<00:06:48.130> sweat<00:06:48.670> on<00:06:48.820> the<00:06:48.970> outside<00:06:49.480> it's<00:06:49.690> still

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:49.750 
really sweat on the outside it's still

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:52.260 
really sweat on the outside it's still
quite<00:06:50.200> dry<00:06:50.470> on<00:06:50.620> the<00:06:50.800> middle<00:06:51.340> so<00:06:51.640> it<00:06:51.730> stays<00:06:52.000> on

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:52.270 
quite dry on the middle so it stays on

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:54.300 
quite dry on the middle so it stays on
the<00:06:52.390> hook<00:06:52.570> and<00:06:52.810> then<00:06:53.560> just<00:06:53.800> put<00:06:53.980> that<00:06:54.130> near

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:54.310 
the hook and then just put that near

00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:56.490 
the hook and then just put that near
pastebot<00:06:54.910> and<00:06:55.450> because<00:06:55.720> it's<00:06:55.900> wet<00:06:56.110> and<00:06:56.260> smelly

00:06:56.490 --> 00:06:56.500 
pastebot and because it's wet and smelly

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:58.260 
pastebot and because it's wet and smelly
on<00:06:56.770> the<00:06:56.890> outside<00:06:57.370> you<00:06:57.640> know<00:06:57.760> the<00:06:57.910> fish<00:06:58.090> will

00:06:58.260 --> 00:06:58.270 
on the outside you know the fish will

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:01.530 
on the outside you know the fish will
take<00:06:58.300> it<00:06:58.720> faster<00:06:59.260> they'll<00:06:59.470> smell<00:07:00.460> it<00:07:00.520> more<00:07:00.850> not

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:01.540 
take it faster they'll smell it more not

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:04.290 
take it faster they'll smell it more not
what<00:07:01.840> makes<00:07:02.080> it<00:07:02.290> so<00:07:02.530> effective<00:07:02.800> and<00:07:03.580> is<00:07:04.150> that

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:04.300 
what makes it so effective and is that

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:05.550 
what makes it so effective and is that
much<00:07:04.420> work<00:07:04.630> to<00:07:04.750> be<00:07:04.840> the<00:07:04.870> more<00:07:05.170> to<00:07:05.290> be<00:07:05.380> yarn

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:05.560 
much work to be the more to be yarn

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:07.050 
much work to be the more to be yarn
