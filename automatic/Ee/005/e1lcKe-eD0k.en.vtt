00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:02.939 
this video we can see the working of an

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:05.030 
this video we can see the working of an
engine<00:00:03.449> oil<00:00:03.510> pump<00:00:03.929> this<00:00:04.259> is<00:00:04.440> actually<00:00:04.799> a<00:00:04.830> type

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
engine oil pump this is actually a type

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.430 
engine oil pump this is actually a type
of<00:00:05.220> rotor<00:00:05.700> pump<00:00:06.060> you<00:00:06.540> can<00:00:06.720> see<00:00:06.870> the<00:00:07.020> internal

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
of rotor pump you can see the internal

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.530 
of rotor pump you can see the internal
and<00:00:07.589> the<00:00:07.680> external<00:00:07.740> gears<00:00:08.519> how<00:00:08.790> it<00:00:08.970> mates<00:00:09.240> and

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
and the external gears how it mates and

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.650 
and the external gears how it mates and
that's<00:00:10.200> the<00:00:10.530> gear<00:00:10.980> which<00:00:11.580> provides<00:00:12.240> the<00:00:12.389> drive

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
that's the gear which provides the drive

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.490 
that's the gear which provides the drive
for<00:00:13.170> the<00:00:13.349> internal<00:00:13.920> gear<00:00:14.480> okay<00:00:15.480> now<00:00:16.020> let's<00:00:16.289> see

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
for the internal gear okay now let's see

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.460 
for the internal gear okay now let's see
the<00:00:16.920> components<00:00:17.460> it<00:00:17.880> has<00:00:18.180> a<00:00:18.210> driving<00:00:19.020> gear<00:00:19.230> and

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
the components it has a driving gear and

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.490 
the components it has a driving gear and
a<00:00:20.010> driven<00:00:20.279> gear<00:00:20.640> so<00:00:21.420> the<00:00:21.449> driving<00:00:21.960> gear<00:00:22.260> is<00:00:22.470> the

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
a driven gear so the driving gear is the

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.340 
a driven gear so the driving gear is the

outlet port in red color so what's

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.310 
outlet port in red color so what's
happening<00:00:56.820> in<00:00:57.030> this<00:00:57.390> suction<00:00:57.629> port<00:00:57.930> is<00:00:58.079> that

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
happening in this suction port is that

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.560 
happening in this suction port is that
as<00:00:58.469> this<00:00:59.190> driving<00:00:59.520> here<00:00:59.850> rotates<00:01:00.300> in<00:01:00.480> the

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
as this driving here rotates in the

as this driving here rotates in the
clockwise<00:01:00.600> direction<00:01:01.670> it<00:01:02.670> moves<00:01:03.300> away<00:01:03.629> from

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
clockwise direction it moves away from

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.990 
clockwise direction it moves away from
the<00:01:04.320> driven<00:01:04.769> gear<00:01:05.100> at<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.430> point<00:01:05.670> of<00:01:05.820> the

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
the driven gear at the point of the

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.390 
the driven gear at the point of the
suction<00:01:06.390> as<00:01:06.510> a<00:01:06.960> result<00:01:07.500> of<00:01:07.680> that<00:01:07.890> a<00:01:08.070> low

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
suction as a result of that a low

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.700 
suction as a result of that a low
pressure<00:01:08.700> is<00:01:08.939> created<00:01:09.420> over<00:01:09.689> there<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:10.140> it

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
pressure is created over there and it

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.060 
pressure is created over there and it
creates<00:01:11.100> the<00:01:11.369> suction<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.290> at<00:01:13.290> the<00:01:13.619> delivery

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
creates the suction and at the delivery

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.609 
creates the suction and at the delivery
point<00:01:14.280> you<00:01:14.580> can<00:01:14.760> see<00:01:14.939> I<00:01:15.210> have<00:01:15.840> marked<00:01:16.200> in<00:01:16.290> a<00:01:16.439> red

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
point you can see I have marked in a red

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.429 
point you can see I have marked in a red
color<00:01:16.890> those<00:01:17.670> point<00:01:18.210> at<00:01:18.420> that<00:01:18.570> point<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:19.170> idea

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
color those point at that point the idea

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.190 
color those point at that point the idea
is<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.100> driving<00:01:20.640> gear<00:01:20.970> and<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.360> driven<00:01:21.900> gear

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
is the driving gear and the driven gear

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.130 
is the driving gear and the driven gear
engages<00:01:22.920> each<00:01:23.250> other<00:01:23.490> and<00:01:23.729> as<00:01:24.390> a<00:01:24.450> result<00:01:24.990> of

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
engages each other and as a result of

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.890 
engages each other and as a result of
that<00:01:25.320> it<00:01:25.530> pushes<00:01:25.860> the<00:01:26.159> oil<00:01:26.189> outside<00:01:26.939> or<00:01:27.180> we<00:01:27.750> get

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
that it pushes the oil outside or we get

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.780 
that it pushes the oil outside or we get
the<00:01:28.080> outlet<00:01:28.409> so<00:01:28.710> that's<00:01:28.979> how<00:01:29.189> it<00:01:29.340> works<00:01:29.610> you

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
the outlet so that's how it works you

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.249 
the outlet so that's how it works you
can<00:01:29.820> see<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.420> internal<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.079> external

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
can see the internal and the external

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.789 
can see the internal and the external
gears<00:01:32.250> mating<00:01:32.939> each<00:01:33.180> other<00:01:33.540> and<00:01:33.840> that's<00:01:34.500> the

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
gears mating each other and that's the

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.370 
gears mating each other and that's the
gear<00:01:35.040> which<00:01:35.340> actually<00:01:35.700> takes<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.119> drive<00:01:36.420> from

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
gear which actually takes the drive from

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.850 
gear which actually takes the drive from
the<00:01:37.590> crankshaft<00:01:37.979> and<00:01:38.310> provides<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.570> the

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:39.860 
the crankshaft and provides to the
