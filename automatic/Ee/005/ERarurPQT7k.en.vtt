00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.890 
you what it done if I point this down
here<00:00:24.650> sorry<00:00:25.650> about<00:00:25.710> that<00:00:26.090> you<00:00:27.090> can<00:00:27.240> see<00:00:27.510> here

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
here sorry about that you can see here

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.349 
here sorry about that you can see here
and<00:00:28.320> maybe<00:00:28.529> a<00:00:28.619> better<00:00:28.890> angle<00:00:29.310> come<00:00:30.119> around

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
and maybe a better angle come around

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.389 
and maybe a better angle come around
here<00:00:31.550> cuz<00:00:32.550> I've<00:00:32.700> chopped<00:00:33.590> the<00:00:34.590> splash<00:00:35.160> ball

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
here cuz I've chopped the splash ball

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.720 
here cuz I've chopped the splash ball
down<00:00:35.989> and<00:00:36.989> obvious<00:00:37.469> reasons<00:00:37.920> are<00:00:38.129> that<00:00:38.160> the

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
down and obvious reasons are that the

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.549 
down and obvious reasons are that the
size<00:00:39.000> of<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.239> splash<00:00:39.480> wall<00:00:39.510> before<00:00:39.960> wouldn't

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
size of the splash wall before wouldn't

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.360 
size of the splash wall before wouldn't
have<00:00:40.649> committed<00:00:41.129> this<00:00:41.540> to<00:00:43.010> allow<00:00:44.010> it<00:00:44.070> to<00:00:44.250> be<00:00:44.340> a

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
have committed this to allow it to be a

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.450 
have committed this to allow it to be a
tiller<00:00:44.670> long<00:00:44.910> gear<00:00:45.210> so<00:00:45.480> that<00:00:46.219> pencil<00:00:47.219> seats

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.460 
tiller long gear so that pencil seats

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.119 
tiller long gear so that pencil seats
going<00:00:47.700> in<00:00:47.940> here<00:00:48.180> I've<00:00:48.870> got<00:00:49.140> a<00:00:49.170> box<00:00:49.500> going<00:00:49.829> over

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
going in here I've got a box going over

basically running across here that's

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.689 
basically running across here that's
gonna<00:00:55.320> be<00:00:55.789> laminated<00:00:56.789> in<00:00:56.940> here<00:00:57.239> so<00:00:57.539> that<00:00:58.699> so

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
the other kind of sort of bigger part of

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.890 
the other kind of sort of bigger part of
it<00:01:07.890> is<00:01:08.040> down<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.939> center<00:01:09.299> of<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.479> boat<00:01:09.659> there

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
it is down the center of the boat there

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.640 
it is down the center of the boat there
I'll<00:01:10.260> move<00:01:10.710> over<00:01:10.860> there<00:01:11.189> so<00:01:11.400> you<00:01:11.460> can<00:01:11.640> see<00:01:11.850> that

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:12.650 
I'll move over there so you can see that

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.710 
I'll move over there so you can see that
right<00:01:13.650> now<00:01:13.680> you<00:01:13.860> can<00:01:14.100> see<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.400> front<00:01:14.700> it<00:01:15.450> is

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
right now you can see the front it is

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.899 
right now you can see the front it is
going<00:01:15.990> to<00:01:16.320> I've<00:01:16.890> got<00:01:17.189> another<00:01:17.430> board<00:01:17.700> right

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
going to I've got another board right

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.090 
going to I've got another board right
pieces<00:01:18.210> to<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.420> left<00:01:18.600> I<00:01:18.750> mean<00:01:18.840> here<00:01:19.100> this

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
pieces to the left I mean here this

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.539 
pieces to the left I mean here this
piece<00:01:20.400> here<00:01:21.680> goes<00:01:22.680> up<00:01:22.830> in<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.009> front<00:01:23.280> but<00:01:23.460> I'm

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
piece here goes up in the front but I'm

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.219 
piece here goes up in the front but I'm
actually<00:01:23.759> cutting<00:01:24.119> one<00:01:24.330> out<00:01:24.450> so<00:01:24.630> it's<00:01:24.780> solid

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
actually cutting one out so it's solid

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:26.870 
actually cutting one out so it's solid
so<00:01:25.500> that<00:01:25.530> I<00:01:25.740> can<00:01:25.890> put<00:01:26.040> a<00:01:26.100> platform<00:01:26.640> up<00:01:26.850> there

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
so that I can put a platform up there

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.960 
so that I can put a platform up there
it's<00:01:27.570> solid<00:01:28.020> enough<00:01:28.229> to<00:01:28.920> allow<00:01:29.250> for<00:01:31.970> basically

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
it's solid enough to allow for basically

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.719 
it's solid enough to allow for basically
a<00:01:33.060> fishing<00:01:33.390> platform<00:01:33.869> that's<00:01:34.560> out<00:01:34.710> here<00:01:34.920> so

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
a fishing platform that's out here so

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.929 
a fishing platform that's out here so
you<00:01:35.790> can<00:01:35.970> see<00:01:36.180> me<00:01:36.560> so<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:38.220> reasons<00:01:38.640> for<00:01:38.700> this

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
you can see me so the reasons for this

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.219 
you can see me so the reasons for this
change<00:01:39.000> here<00:01:39.659> this<00:01:40.170> week<00:01:40.909> is<00:01:42.229> basically

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
change here this week is basically

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.539 
change here this week is basically
because<00:01:43.880> in<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.479> end<00:01:45.659> I<00:01:45.930> decided<00:01:45.990> that<00:01:46.680> this

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
because in the end I decided that this

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.190 
because in the end I decided that this
boat<00:01:47.820> no<00:01:48.270> matter<00:01:48.479> how<00:01:48.659> much<00:01:48.780> they<00:01:48.930> tried<00:01:49.170> to

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
boat no matter how much they tried to

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.830 
boat no matter how much they tried to
configure<00:01:49.710> the<00:01:49.829> seats<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:50.310> do<00:01:50.369> everything

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
configure the seats and do everything

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.899 
configure the seats and do everything
the<00:01:51.840> width<00:01:52.079> of<00:01:52.259> this<00:01:52.409> boat<00:01:52.680> isn't<00:01:53.430> that<00:01:53.610> huge

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
the width of this boat isn't that huge

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.670 
the width of this boat isn't that huge
so<00:01:55.070> to<00:01:56.070> get<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.670> four<00:01:56.969> of<00:01:57.149> us<00:01:57.270> in<00:01:57.540> here<00:01:57.869> without

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
so to get the four of us in here without

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.740 
so to get the four of us in here without
having<00:01:59.159> everybody<00:02:00.030> sitting<00:02:00.329> right<00:02:00.630> in<00:02:00.659> the

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
having everybody sitting right in the

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.840 
having everybody sitting right in the
very<00:02:00.899> back<00:02:01.170> of<00:02:01.409> the<00:02:01.500> boat<00:02:01.710> was<00:02:02.490> going<00:02:02.640> to<00:02:02.729> be<00:02:02.820> a

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
very back of the boat was going to be a

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.980 
very back of the boat was going to be a
big<00:02:03.090> challenge<00:02:03.380> so<00:02:04.380> I<00:02:04.829> decided<00:02:05.310> that<00:02:05.990> making

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
big challenge so I decided that making

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.389 
big challenge so I decided that making
it<00:02:07.049> a<00:02:07.170> tiller<00:02:07.409> model<00:02:07.829> and<00:02:08.009> going<00:02:08.280> the

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
it a tiller model and going the

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.040 
it a tiller model and going the
simplistic<00:02:08.849> route<00:02:09.209> kept<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:09.629> weight

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:10.050 
simplistic route kept the weight

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.880 
simplistic route kept the weight
and<00:02:10.310> kept<00:02:11.310> it<00:02:11.370> ultra<00:02:11.700> portable<00:02:11.970> and<00:02:12.890> allowed

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
and kept it ultra portable and allowed

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.920 
and kept it ultra portable and allowed
for<00:02:13.920> us<00:02:14.310> to<00:02:14.490> sit<00:02:14.700> up<00:02:14.790> a<00:02:14.880> little<00:02:14.910> bit<00:02:15.270> a<00:02:15.390> little

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
for us to sit up a little bit a little

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.590 
for us to sit up a little bit a little
bit<00:02:16.140> higher<00:02:16.500> so<00:02:16.530> that<00:02:17.010> we're<00:02:17.160> not<00:02:17.600> basically

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
bit higher so that we're not basically

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.370 
bit higher so that we're not basically
our<00:02:18.810> knees<00:02:18.990> up<00:02:19.230> to<00:02:19.380> our<00:02:19.440> nostrils<00:02:20.000> so<00:02:21.140> that<00:02:22.140> was

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
our knees up to our nostrils so that was

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.910 
our knees up to our nostrils so that was
sort<00:02:22.530> of<00:02:22.620> the<00:02:22.740> impetus<00:02:23.010> for<00:02:23.160> the<00:02:23.400> change<00:02:24.920> the

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
sort of the impetus for the change the

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.760 
sort of the impetus for the change the
other<00:02:26.070> part<00:02:26.400> of<00:02:26.490> it<00:02:26.640> was<00:02:26.700> is<00:02:27.600> is<00:02:28.320> the<00:02:28.590> weight

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
other part of it was is is the weight

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.920 
other part of it was is is the weight
aspect<00:02:29.370> because<00:02:29.670> they<00:02:29.790> told<00:02:30.000> with<00:02:30.180> a<00:02:30.210> car<00:02:30.630> I

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
aspect because they told with a car I

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.080 
aspect because they told with a car I
wanted<00:02:31.710> something<00:02:31.920> that<00:02:32.160> I<00:02:32.250> could<00:02:32.430> easily<00:02:32.580> tow

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
wanted something that I could easily tow

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.910 
wanted something that I could easily tow
and<00:02:33.420> by<00:02:33.540> the<00:02:33.630> time<00:02:33.870> I<00:02:33.900> had<00:02:34.140> that<00:02:34.290> the<00:02:34.380> console

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
and by the time I had that the console

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.560 
and by the time I had that the console
in<00:02:35.070> and<00:02:35.280> everything<00:02:35.640> where<00:02:35.820> I<00:02:35.850> was<00:02:36.090> going<00:02:36.390> with

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
in and everything where I was going with

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:40.790 
in and everything where I was going with
it<00:02:37.940> surprisingly<00:02:38.940> the<00:02:39.360> way<00:02:39.510> to<00:02:39.570> add<00:02:39.750> it<00:02:39.930> out<00:02:40.080> so

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
it surprisingly the way to add it out so

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.410 
it surprisingly the way to add it out so
that's<00:02:41.400> where<00:02:41.640> I'm<00:02:41.700> going<00:02:41.790> with<00:02:42.150> it<00:02:44.420> nothing

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
that's where I'm going with it nothing

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.540 
that's where I'm going with it nothing
really<00:02:45.630> else<00:02:46.020> noteworthy<00:02:46.590> to<00:02:46.830> tell<00:02:47.190> you<00:02:47.370> other

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
really else noteworthy to tell you other

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.690 
really else noteworthy to tell you other
than<00:02:47.670> shopping<00:02:48.240> down<00:02:48.390> the<00:02:48.540> costs<00:02:48.900> or<00:02:49.080> the

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
than shopping down the costs or the

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.950 
than shopping down the costs or the
backsplash<00:02:50.700> wall<00:02:51.120> was<00:02:51.360> an<00:02:51.480> interesting

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:51.960 
backsplash wall was an interesting

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.720 
backsplash wall was an interesting
challenge<00:02:52.200> because<00:02:52.710> of<00:02:52.830> all<00:02:52.950> the<00:02:53.070> angles<00:02:53.550> from

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
challenge because of all the angles from

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:56.180 
challenge because of all the angles from
the<00:02:54.330> angles<00:02:54.660> coming<00:02:54.840> in<00:02:55.050> at<00:02:55.170> aside<00:02:55.590> and<00:02:55.980> then

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
the angles coming in at aside and then

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.280 
the angles coming in at aside and then
angles<00:02:56.580> coming<00:02:56.730> down<00:02:57.000> this<00:02:57.180> way<00:02:57.420> and<00:02:58.080> what

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
angles coming down this way and what

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.890 
angles coming down this way and what
basically<00:02:58.740> I<00:02:58.860> did<00:02:59.190> was<00:02:59.570> after<00:03:00.570> a<00:03:00.600> lot<00:03:00.870> of

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
basically I did was after a lot of

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.920 
basically I did was after a lot of
messing<00:03:01.800> around<00:03:01.890> with<00:03:02.160> it<00:03:02.310> and<00:03:02.490> using

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
messing around with it and using

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.390 
messing around with it and using
protractors<00:03:03.930> and<00:03:04.260> stuff<00:03:04.620> to<00:03:04.770> get<00:03:04.890> the<00:03:04.980> angles

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
protractors and stuff to get the angles

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.880 
protractors and stuff to get the angles
I<00:03:05.640> ended<00:03:06.210> up<00:03:06.270> eyeballing<00:03:06.840> it<00:03:06.930> and<00:03:07.170> it<00:03:07.650> came<00:03:07.770> out

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:07.890 
I ended up eyeballing it and it came out

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.130 
I ended up eyeballing it and it came out
really<00:03:08.010> good<00:03:08.190> so<00:03:08.600> sometimes<00:03:09.600> just<00:03:09.750> a<00:03:09.990> good

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
really good so sometimes just a good

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.060 
really good so sometimes just a good
old-fashioned<00:03:10.710> looking<00:03:11.070> at<00:03:11.220> it<00:03:11.370> makes<00:03:11.580> makes

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:13.070 
old-fashioned looking at it makes makes

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:15.740 
old-fashioned looking at it makes makes
makes<00:03:14.070> the<00:03:14.220> difference<00:03:14.580> so<00:03:14.850> it<00:03:15.330> wasn't<00:03:15.720> the

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
makes the difference so it wasn't the

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.300 
makes the difference so it wasn't the
flat<00:03:15.990> part<00:03:16.260> that<00:03:16.440> was<00:03:16.560> hard<00:03:16.710> to<00:03:16.860> cut<00:03:17.010> of<00:03:17.130> course

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
flat part that was hard to cut of course

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.610 
flat part that was hard to cut of course
it<00:03:17.520> was<00:03:17.640> the<00:03:17.850> the<00:03:17.880> side<00:03:18.600> parts<00:03:18.960> and<00:03:19.260> I<00:03:19.380> wanted

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
it was the the side parts and I wanted

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.680 
it was the the side parts and I wanted
to<00:03:19.710> have<00:03:19.860> a<00:03:19.890> vertical<00:03:20.220> board<00:03:20.880> against<00:03:21.450> that

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
to have a vertical board against that

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.200 
to have a vertical board against that
that<00:03:22.620> surface<00:03:22.920> like<00:03:23.280> this<00:03:23.490> and<00:03:24.090> of<00:03:24.180> course

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:24.210 
that surface like this and of course

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:26.480 
that surface like this and of course
this<00:03:24.660> splash<00:03:25.110> well<00:03:25.470> even<00:03:26.070> looking<00:03:26.280> at<00:03:26.370> this

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:26.490 
this splash well even looking at this

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:28.630 
this splash well even looking at this
way<00:03:26.700> is<00:03:27.150> coming<00:03:27.570> in<00:03:27.690> at<00:03:27.840> an<00:03:27.960> angle<00:03:28.320> like<00:03:28.350> this

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
way is coming in at an angle like this

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:31.370 
way is coming in at an angle like this
it's<00:03:29.640> not<00:03:29.790> quite<00:03:30.120> 15<00:03:30.570> degrees<00:03:30.930> but<00:03:31.140> close<00:03:31.350> to

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
it's not quite 15 degrees but close to

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:31.790 
it's not quite 15 degrees but close to
it

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 
it

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.910 
it
so<00:03:32.370> you<00:03:33.240> know<00:03:33.360> it's<00:03:33.600> you<00:03:34.260> just<00:03:34.440> got<00:03:34.650> to<00:03:34.740> think

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
so you know it's you just got to think

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.880 
so you know it's you just got to think
it<00:03:35.010> through<00:03:35.070> a<00:03:35.250> bit<00:03:35.460> so<00:03:36.230> that's<00:03:37.230> where<00:03:37.470> at<00:03:37.680> I

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:37.890 
it through a bit so that's where at I

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.180 
it through a bit so that's where at I
thought<00:03:38.280> I'd<00:03:38.400> give<00:03:38.520> you<00:03:38.610> guys<00:03:38.670> an<00:03:38.970> update<00:03:40.190> and

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
thought I'd give you guys an update and

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.360 
thought I'd give you guys an update and
talk<00:03:41.370> with<00:03:41.490> you<00:03:41.610> later<00:03:41.670> right
