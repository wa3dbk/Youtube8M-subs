00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.659
 our change in the world on Wednesday with 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.490
 american aircraft carrier george 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.550
 the elder bush first kicked off 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:12.080
 heavy drone drone here footage 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.080
 who in a moment circled the whole world 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:17.779
 this is x-47b maximum take-off weight 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:21.410
 gigantic my drone 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:24.140
 more than 20 tons wingspan 19 meters 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:26.830
 range of about 4000 kilometers 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:30.949
 plus the ability to refuel in the air 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:32.090
 directory hear 12 thousand meters speed 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:34.520
 almost the speed of sound 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.530
 equipped with precision weapons it there 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:40.250
 zones but the main thing 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:42.559
 x-47b artificial body not requiring 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:45.860
 happiness on takeoff performing combat 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:48.260
 mission and land pilot return 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.760
 martial hardware operator is visible for 

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.630
 radar from you can sit on the deck 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.390
 aircraft carrier 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:55.730
 the latter makes revolution in that sense 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:58.039
 That the United States gets the technical ability 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.980
 perform operations using such 

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:03.320
 impact drone anywhere in the world 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.500
 needing on weird on earthly bases 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.660
 support so any 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:11.450
 international approvals curious 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:13.310
 that shortly before the first of May in the United States 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.030
 conducted another successful trial 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:20.170
 another aircraft 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:23.270
 x51 and at an altitude of 18 kilometers 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:26.390
 x51 and more than five times exceeded 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:29.140
 the speed of sound that is faster than 6000 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.140
 kilometers per hour 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:36.030
 on-screen animation but in reality 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.840
 hypersound will reduce flight time 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.900
 high-precision cruise missiles 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:43.390
 minutes all together this war is new 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.940
 generations where the problem is solved during 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.460
 1 hour without nuclear weapons 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:50.290
 fast global blow fast and 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.930
 global strike is an American term 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:55.570
 abbreviation pj with so called 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.860
 approved in the us concept of achievement 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.880
 military superiority 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:03.370
 Russian nuclear potential interferes with its us 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.590
 Obama just offers to cut in 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:08.440
 letter to Putin about received on this 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.660
 week letter later now about 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.270
 lawlessness that Americans do in 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.920
 the world of their drones and ours 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.130

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:33.040
 the world's first ejection drone is equipped 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.390
 artificial intelligence I have 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:38.650
 two words for you 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:44.050
 Predators drones one else and you never 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:46.480
 see how they approach you think 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.190
 i'm joking is joking the number of drones attacks for 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:50.440
 the times of his first presidency only 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:52.990
 increased almost 6 times compared to 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.820
 two terms of bush accurate data about 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:57.040
 dead don't like operations in 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:59.440

 dasya situation in pakistan 2004 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.000
 the number of dead during unmanned 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:13.690
 access in this country exceeded 3,000 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.190
 man and you paul cezanne 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.140
 American homicide policy 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.150
 overlaps over the edge if that 

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:20.709
 there were only war killing and the body 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:23.320
 belongs to the armed forces 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:25.450
 so that these killings were legal but when 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:27.940
 they hunt and kill financiers 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.950
 enemies or family members to the enemy and these people 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.620
 should not become targets and if 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.900
 steel then this is a war crime in 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:37.000
 pakistan itself otherwise it is not called 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.750

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.210
 declares 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:42.490
 that drones are a direct threat to his sovereignty 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:45.010
 countries explicitly rebuke obama 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:47.560
 decision making mechanism with reference to

 former administration staff described 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.880
 authoritative new york times roughly 1

 government by 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.170
 secret newsgroup are studying 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:01.000
 biographies of suspected terrorists and 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:03.220
 recommends to the president who should 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.540
 die next it functions all 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.640
 time blows and somali 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.830
 as well as more difficult risky hits

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:24.490
 drones drive them from here beyond 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.990
 thousand kilometers from the martial theater 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.990
 action which is located in 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:31.090
 pilots in afghanistan and pakistan if so 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.500
 you can call people quite good 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.630
 time in comfortable chairs under 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:37.000
 air-conditioned and with joysticks in hand 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:39.060
 bear service in conditions as much as possible 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.490
 remote from combat 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:44.440
 it's like you see a garnet magnet it's not like 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.780
 the video game is not for the reason that all 

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.550
 this is due to the real plane which 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.620
 fly in real space in the air 

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:53.050
 drones operators have a high percentage 

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.729
 suicide to morale roses in 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:57.790
 the pentagon decided to equalize 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:59.620
 real and virtual pilots are ready 

00:04:57.790 --> 00:05:02.140
 design 6 medals that will 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:04.419
 reward drones and radio operators 

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:07.479
 just waiting for approval she's on top 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:10.419
 cordially for many guys this is a call to the air force 

00:05:07.479 --> 00:05:12.130
 great job and we all have will provide 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:14.020
 medical insurance has withdrawn 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:16.570
 and they have the most advanced technology 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:18.520
 on the arsenal of the Pentagon and the special services 

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:21.010
 drones already 10,000 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.780
 every third plane in the american air force 

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:24.669
 this drone is of course they are in 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:26.380
 britain in israel their other 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:28.630
 countries but in such diversity 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:31.120
 aircraft like us cannot 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:32.760
 brag no one in the world by type drones 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.910
 can be divided into three categories 

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:35.919
 mini drones 

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:37.330
 they can be paid for example a soldier to 

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:40.300
 track down nearby 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:40.920
 adversary in fact its task includes 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:43.500
 basically 

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:45.630
 aerial reconnaissance and strategic these 

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:47.910
 cars are capable of hours and even days 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:48.720
 be in the air carry heavy 

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:50.790
 armament 

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:53.130
 new developments reported hardly 

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:57.360
 not every week here is the presentation of drones 

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:59.550
 helicopters sky over these 26 square 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:01.290
 Kilometers 1 to USA air 

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:03.300
 the space is officially closed for 

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:05.820
 flight drones so decided on the board 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:07.710
 Phil Charlotte city known as the birthplace of 

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:09.660
 thomas jefferson one of the authors 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:11.700
 declaration of independence is now in 

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:13.890
 the forefront of the struggle for independence from 

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:15.030
 ubiquitous drone and and lead already 

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:17.490
 30 states 

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:18.900
 virginia activists were alarmed after 

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:21.180
 how the government ordered 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:23.580
 choose 6 places in the country where they will be located 

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:24.180
 test site and their staff went into 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:25.980
 this list 

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:28.020
 Obama his entourage entrance was allowed 

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:29.850
 customary arguments national 

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:32.790
 September 11 security 

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:34.200
 not convinced everyone in the city of Syracuse base 

00:06:32.790 --> 00:06:36.480
 drones on its outskirts 

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:38.640
 and the other day the police arrested 30 people 

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:41.490
 on the march to protest their battle 

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:43.620
 Siracusa again they lost and decided 

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:44.130
 but people will not be able to cross vessels 

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:46.920
 of this 

00:06:44.130 --> 00:06:48.480
 developing new types of flying riders 

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:50.730
 and even running robots 

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:52.860
 and when you are a southern transporter dog whose 

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:55.860
 numbly listening to some chilling horror 

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:57.060
 similar synchronicity is maintained constantly 

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:59.250
 rebuilding the air 

00:06:57.060 --> 00:07:02.310
 never master any ace or 

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:04.110
 aerobatic team cut in to us very 

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:06.390
 worried about creating programmable 

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:08.220
 military technology certainly in the beginning 

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:10.260
 some installations are set by man 

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:12.090
 After all, she then the technique act in 

00:07:10.260 --> 00:07:12.500
 offline and husband independently 

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:15.200
 to choose 

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:17.200
 if not people in the air land or water i 

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:20.210
 I don't want to be at the tomb 

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:22.460
 97 Williams won the Nobel Prize 

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:23.090
 of the world for their fight with anti-personnel 

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:26.120
 minami 

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:28.160
 12 years later, the peace prize goes on to the hut 

00:07:26.120 --> 00:07:30.760
 Obama who likes drones 

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:33.080
 the world has changed a lot during this time 

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:39.370
 Valentin Bogdanov and Viktor Cossacks 

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:39.370
 lead the week and new york it is clear that
