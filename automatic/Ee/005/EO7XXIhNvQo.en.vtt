00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
game in that order but it's pretty good

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.389 
game in that order but it's pretty good
for<00:00:50.160> starters<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:51.239> campaign<00:00:51.750> it's<00:00:52.289> epic<00:00:52.710> like

for starters the campaign it's epic like
I'm<00:00:53.610> highly<00:00:54.329> surprising<00:00:54.930> how<00:00:54.989> good<00:00:55.260> this

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350

campaign is I don't want to give too

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.420 
campaign is I don't want to give too
many<00:00:57.480> spoilers<00:00:57.780> away<00:00:58.260> but<00:00:58.710> for<00:00:58.859> starters<00:00:59.039> the

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
many spoilers away but for starters the

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.369 
many spoilers away but for starters the
first<00:00:59.670> mission<00:00:59.910> you're<00:01:00.660> in<00:01:00.750> New<00:01:00.870> York<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.320> you

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
first mission you're in New York and you

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.660 
first mission you're in New York and you
walk<00:01:01.530> around<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.800> streets<00:01:02.039> of<00:01:02.129> New<00:01:02.250> York<00:01:02.309> and

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
walk around the streets of New York and

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:03.920 
walk around the streets of New York and
I<00:01:02.910> really<00:01:03.149> like<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.359> fact<00:01:03.539> that<00:01:03.690> they<00:01:03.809> had

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
I really like the fact that they had

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.929 
I really like the fact that they had
like<00:01:04.049> subways<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:05.430> subways<00:01:05.820> are

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
like subways and the subways are

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.120 
like subways and the subways are
numbered<00:01:06.390> ever<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:07.080> realistic<00:01:07.439> stops<00:01:07.920> and

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
numbered ever to realistic stops and

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.469 
numbered ever to realistic stops and
everything<00:01:08.460> as<00:01:08.549> you<00:01:08.670> walked<00:01:08.850> in<00:01:09.000> New<00:01:09.119> York<00:01:09.360> I

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
everything as you walked in New York I

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.030 
everything as you walked in New York I
thought<00:01:09.659> that<00:01:09.869> was<00:01:09.960> pretty<00:01:10.020> cool<00:01:10.320> another

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
thought that was pretty cool another

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.250 
thought that was pretty cool another
mission<00:01:11.460> is<00:01:11.610> when<00:01:11.790> you're<00:01:12.390> underwater<00:01:12.750> and

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
mission is when you're underwater and

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.219 
mission is when you're underwater and
you're<00:01:13.350> walking<00:01:13.470> in<00:01:13.830> tunnels<00:01:14.369> and<00:01:14.610> like<00:01:15.570> the

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
you're walking in tunnels and like the

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.710 
you're walking in tunnels and like the
tunnel<00:01:16.619> state<00:01:16.890> they<00:01:17.100> are<00:01:17.280> they<00:01:18.030> are<00:01:18.240> flooded

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
tunnel state they are they are flooded

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:19.940 
tunnel state they are they are flooded
and<00:01:18.810> you're<00:01:18.930> swimming<00:01:19.200> in<00:01:19.229> the<00:01:19.350> water<00:01:19.500> and

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
and you're swimming in the water and

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.980 
and you're swimming in the water and
there's<00:01:20.729> people<00:01:21.000> that<00:01:21.030> died<00:01:21.299> in<00:01:21.330> there<00:01:21.689> so

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
there's people that died in there so

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.719 
there's people that died in there so
they're<00:01:22.140> like<00:01:22.229> floating<00:01:22.740> bodies<00:01:23.280> of<00:01:23.430> floating

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
they're like floating bodies of floating

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:24.890 
they're like floating bodies of floating
in<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:23.880> water<00:01:24.090> as<00:01:24.240> you're<00:01:24.360> swimming<00:01:24.540> a<00:01:24.720> book

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
in the water as you're swimming a book

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.690 
in the water as you're swimming a book
that's<00:01:25.080> pretty<00:01:25.380> cool<00:01:25.560> also<00:01:26.490> there's<00:01:26.640> another

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
that's pretty cool also there's another

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.280 
that's pretty cool also there's another
mission<00:01:27.240> where<00:01:27.360> is<00:01:27.450> like<00:01:27.540> a<00:01:27.630> runaway<00:01:27.900> train

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
mission where is like a runaway train

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.130 
mission where is like a runaway train
and<00:01:28.590> as<00:01:28.979> a<00:01:29.009> train<00:01:29.310> crosses<00:01:29.700> our<00:01:29.850> platform<00:01:30.840> you

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
and as a train crosses our platform you

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.929 
and as a train crosses our platform you
see<00:01:31.290> people<00:01:31.470> running<00:01:31.619> and<00:01:31.979> screaming<00:01:32.070> like<00:01:32.850> I

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
see people running and screaming like I

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.370 
see people running and screaming like I
said<00:01:33.000> it<00:01:33.240> was<00:01:33.329> really<00:01:33.509> action-packed<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.290> I

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
said it was really action-packed and I

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.690 
said it was really action-packed and I
thought<00:01:34.560> it's<00:01:34.740> pretty<00:01:34.920> cool<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:35.400> exciting

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
thought it's pretty cool and exciting

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.840 
thought it's pretty cool and exciting
