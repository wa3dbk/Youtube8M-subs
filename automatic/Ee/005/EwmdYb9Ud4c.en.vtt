 belga 

00:00:01.569 --> 00:00:03.330
 a French 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.450
 a right-handed one left-handed 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:07.830
 and two winning sets to decide 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.590
 the match promised to be intense it was also possible 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:25.880
 French 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:30.820
 him his 45th at the tp managed to brick from the outset he wins the first 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.120
 set 6 3 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.690
 the recovery no longer wants 500 shareholders the game he goes to the net 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.070
 distributes essays of powerful services to more than 200 kilometers 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:43.490
 hour 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.490
 end of second set 6 4 for Belgian 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.290
 if I want five in the last set by making Belgian 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:55.999
 baptist dupuy marks important points 

00:00:55.999 --> 00:00:58.999
 but he fails to take the service of his opponent 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:02.680
 I do not know if I go everywhere 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.680
 for a final tie-break 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.060
 in the baptist tie-break is quickly outdistanced he will not come back better this 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.790
 drawing wins in three sets 3 606 87 6 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.790
 he wins the future tournament for the second year in a row 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:28.670
 but I have not started well 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.520
 March 27, 2009 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.520
 all this and I think that this movement should decide from here 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.160
 the second was to keep my break 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.270
 it is true that I sang 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.270
 the ministerial council is more and more difficult 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:51.510
 but you have to find more and more aggressive 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.510
 It is true that they are perfectly aware of the final in Madrid 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:59.250
 this victory should allow more than a second of respite from a few 

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.360
 atp ranking places 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.770
 baptist he can only congratulate himself on this beautiful second place him who 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.850
 had already eliminated on Friday the Belgian david goffin 298th world
