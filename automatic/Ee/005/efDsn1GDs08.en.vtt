it'll be difficult to get a good stroke
with<00:02:43.569> your<00:02:43.720> arms<00:02:44.049> straight<00:02:44.380> give<00:02:44.799> the<00:02:45.010> paddle

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.400 
with your arms straight give the paddle

a downwards and back motion switch sides

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.259 
a downwards and back motion switch sides
is<00:02:48.760> needed<00:02:50.400> now<00:02:51.400> that<00:02:51.639> we've<00:02:51.760> learned<00:02:52.060> the

basic paddling techniques let's learn

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:57.870 
basic paddling techniques let's learn
how<00:02:54.730> to<00:02:54.790> turn<00:02:55.380> to<00:02:56.380> make<00:02:56.500> a<00:02:56.560> simple<00:02:56.950> turn<00:02:57.310> paddle

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
how to turn to make a simple turn paddle

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.170 
how to turn to make a simple turn paddle
only<00:02:58.450> on<00:02:58.599> one<00:02:58.870> side<00:02:58.900> of<00:02:59.380> the<00:02:59.500> board<00:02:59.940> doing<00:03:00.940> this

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
only on one side of the board doing this

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.059 
only on one side of the board doing this
you<00:03:01.599> will<00:03:01.750> turn<00:03:01.989> in<00:03:02.260> the<00:03:02.349> opposite<00:03:02.889> direction

00:03:03.059 --> 00:03:03.069 
you will turn in the opposite direction

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:05.590 
you will turn in the opposite direction
of<00:03:03.669> the<00:03:03.819> side<00:03:04.060> you're<00:03:04.359> paddling<00:03:04.630> on

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
of the side you're paddling on

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.720 
of the side you're paddling on
another<00:03:06.590> thing<00:03:06.860> you<00:03:06.890> can<00:03:07.100> do<00:03:07.280> is<00:03:07.490> call<00:03:07.700> the

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:07.730 
another thing you can do is call the

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.030 
another thing you can do is call the
back<00:03:08.060> paddle<00:03:08.510> this<00:03:09.260> is<00:03:09.470> when<00:03:09.680> you<00:03:09.830> actually

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
back paddle this is when you actually

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.070 
back paddle this is when you actually
move<00:03:10.580> the<00:03:10.640> paddle<00:03:11.240> blade<00:03:11.420> from<00:03:11.660> the<00:03:11.840> rear<00:03:12.050> of

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:12.080 
move the paddle blade from the rear of

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.070 
move the paddle blade from the rear of
the<00:03:12.380> board<00:03:12.650> to<00:03:12.950> the<00:03:12.980> front<00:03:13.450> so<00:03:14.450> if<00:03:14.570> you<00:03:14.690> wanted

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.080 
the board to the front so if you wanted

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.410 
the board to the front so if you wanted
to<00:03:15.230> turn<00:03:15.470> right<00:03:15.740> you<00:03:16.370> could<00:03:16.610> paddle<00:03:16.880> on<00:03:17.180> your

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
to turn right you could paddle on your

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.690 
to turn right you could paddle on your
right<00:03:17.630> side<00:03:17.660> backwards<00:03:18.650> and<00:03:18.920> it'll<00:03:19.250> turn<00:03:19.460> you

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
right side backwards and it'll turn you

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.450 
right side backwards and it'll turn you
to<00:03:19.940> the<00:03:19.970> right<00:03:20.270> or<00:03:20.680> paddle<00:03:21.680> backwards<00:03:21.890> on<00:03:22.340> the

to the right or paddle backwards on the

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:25.780 
to the right or paddle backwards on the
left<00:03:22.700> side<00:03:22.970> to<00:03:23.540> turn<00:03:23.750> to<00:03:24.020> the<00:03:24.140> left<00:03:24.700> using<00:03:25.700> a

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:25.790 
left side to turn to the left using a

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.850 
left side to turn to the left using a
combination<00:03:26.030> of<00:03:26.600> these<00:03:26.750> two<00:03:26.810> techniques<00:03:27.530> is

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:27.860 
combination of these two techniques is

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.900 
combination of these two techniques is
the<00:03:28.190> foundation<00:03:28.910> of<00:03:29.030> the<00:03:29.330> basic<00:03:29.720> turn<00:03:30.910> whether

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
the foundation of the basic turn whether

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.030 
the foundation of the basic turn whether
you're<00:03:32.180> a<00:03:32.210> beginner<00:03:32.420> or<00:03:32.870> an<00:03:32.960> advanced<00:03:33.530> paddle
