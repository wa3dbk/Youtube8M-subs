00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:19.440 
just doesn't feel right i mean the sides

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.130 
just doesn't feel right i mean the sides
here<00:00:19.680> are<00:00:19.920> really<00:00:20.450> way<00:00:21.450> too<00:00:21.480> thick<00:00:21.930> so<00:00:21.960> you

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
here are really way too thick so you

can't grasp onto it properly they run
off<00:00:25.860> of<00:00:25.890> for<00:00:28.040> triple-a<00:00:29.040> batteries<00:00:29.490> which<00:00:29.700> is

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
off of for triple-a batteries which is

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.369 
off of for triple-a batteries which is
kind<00:00:30.120> of<00:00:30.210> ridiculous<00:00:32.899> but<00:00:33.899> on<00:00:34.110> a<00:00:34.140> positive

00:00:34.369 --> 00:00:34.379

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
buttons they have bigger alone are

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.390 
buttons they have bigger alone are
buttons<00:00:43.829> just<00:00:44.390> kind<00:00:45.390> of<00:00:45.480> nice<00:00:45.660> I<00:00:45.900> mean<00:00:46.160> it<00:00:47.160> can

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:47.400 
buttons just kind of nice I mean it can

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.060 
buttons just kind of nice I mean it can
be<00:00:47.550> comfortable<00:00:47.790> to<00:00:48.000> hold<00:00:48.210> at<00:00:48.390> times<00:00:48.860> but<00:00:49.860> they

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
be comfortable to hold at times but they

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.160 
be comfortable to hold at times but they
use<00:00:50.250> infrared<00:00:50.640> wireless<00:00:51.360> technology<00:00:51.960> so<00:00:52.079> you

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
use infrared wireless technology so you

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.910 
use infrared wireless technology so you
have<00:00:52.320> to<00:00:52.440> point<00:00:52.590> it<00:00:52.770> exactly<00:00:53.370> at<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.700> receiver

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:54.920 
have to point it exactly at the receiver

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.270 
have to point it exactly at the receiver
this<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:56.220> if<00:00:57.030> anything<00:00:57.300> gets<00:00:57.809> in<00:00:57.989> the<00:00:58.079> way<00:00:58.280> it

00:00:59.270 --> 00:00:59.280 
this and if anything gets in the way it

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.900 
this and if anything gets in the way it
blocks<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.210> signal<00:01:00.450> completely<00:01:01.399> it<00:01:02.399> really

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
blocks the signal completely it really

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.910 
blocks the signal completely it really
does<00:01:03.090> test<00:01:03.420> your<00:01:03.630> patience<00:01:03.960> these<00:01:04.290> things<00:01:04.530> are

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
does test your patience these things are

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.149 
does test your patience these things are
patients<00:01:05.909> killers

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.440 
find that the analog stick is very
uncomfortable<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:23.250> very<00:01:23.640> inconveniently

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
uncomfortable and very inconveniently

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.230

properly<00:01:35.390> this<00:01:36.390> one<00:01:36.630> also<00:01:36.810> runs<00:01:37.200> off<00:01:37.409> for

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
properly this one also runs off for

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.139 
properly this one also runs off for
double-a<00:01:38.940> batteries<00:01:39.390> as<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.869> L&amp;R<00:01:40.259> buttons

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:41.149 
double-a batteries as the L&amp;R buttons

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:43.219 
double-a batteries as the L&amp;R buttons
personally<00:01:42.149> I<00:01:42.179> really<00:01:42.660> do<00:01:42.810> like<00:01:43.020> these

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
personally I really do like these

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:49.190 
personally I really do like these
triggers<00:01:43.649> here<00:01:43.860> and<00:01:45.560> should<00:01:46.560> be<00:01:46.679> fair<00:01:47.070> I<00:01:48.200> do

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
triggers here and should be fair I do

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.910 
triggers here and should be fair I do
have<00:01:49.830> an<00:01:50.009> n64<00:01:50.460> remote<00:01:51.060> that<00:01:51.570> does<00:01:52.170> run<00:01:52.619> pretty

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
have an n64 remote that does run pretty

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.660 
have an n64 remote that does run pretty
well<00:01:53.550> with<00:01:54.030> Doc's<00:01:54.360> wireless<00:01:54.840> signals<00:01:55.670> but

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
well with Doc's wireless signals but

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.969 
well with Doc's wireless signals but
that<00:01:57.030> leads<00:01:57.300> me<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:57.660> believe<00:01:57.690> that<00:01:57.990> some<00:01:58.649> may

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
that leads me to believe that some may

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.609 
that leads me to believe that some may
be<00:01:59.060> higher<00:02:00.060> quality<00:02:00.659> than<00:02:00.690> others<00:02:01.110> or<00:02:01.350> some

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
be higher quality than others or some

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.130 
be higher quality than others or some
just<00:02:01.890> might<00:02:02.820> have<00:02:03.090> worked<00:02:03.390> in<00:02:03.570> some<00:02:03.780> might<00:02:04.020> of

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
just might have worked in some might of

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.999 
just might have worked in some might of
not<00:02:04.550> but<00:02:05.550> as<00:02:05.789> the<00:02:06.240> stands<00:02:06.810> this<00:02:07.319> one<00:02:07.679> right

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
not but as the stands this one right

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.850 
not but as the stands this one right
here<00:02:08.330> lags<00:02:09.330> and<00:02:09.690> does<00:02:09.810> not<00:02:09.959> perform<00:02:10.200> properly

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
here lags and does not perform properly

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.330 
here lags and does not perform properly
and<00:02:11.239> this<00:02:12.239> one<00:02:12.510> also<00:02:12.720> likes<00:02:13.320> but<00:02:13.829> you're<00:02:14.160> able

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
and this one also likes but you're able

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.880 
and this one also likes but you're able
to<00:02:14.700> play<00:02:14.940> some<00:02:15.329> games<00:02:15.600> but<00:02:15.989> if<00:02:16.200> you're

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:16.890
