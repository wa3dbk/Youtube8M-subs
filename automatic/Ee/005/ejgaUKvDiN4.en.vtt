00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:20.769
 well let's explain the game of 

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:23.650
 for this we take two cards 

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:25.149
 indifferent blacks better than they are 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.900
 discarded significant as the 

00:00:25.149 --> 00:00:31.570
 Kanak and one red for example 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.400
 of hearts then for it 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.550
 we will take a letter from the indifferent 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.010
 in the left hand 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.760
 and we'll put it upside down and the other 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:44.190
 two in the right hand in this way the 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.860
 as below and the other letter indifferent 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.360
 over and to do it we will go to 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.840
 viewer who has to look for the 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.990
 daring 

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:54.880
 we will put the letters perpendicular to 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:57.640
 viewer and these two letters in 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:59.739
 parallel so that when we let that 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:02.020
 let's release all three of them, do not see which of 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:04.070
 these two speaker first 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:07.390
 An example 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.390
 look for the courage 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.290
 in this case the viewer could 

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:16.550
 tell us what is here and here or here 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.550
 in this case I would be here 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.149
 the trick is that you do not know which of 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:23.950
 the two cards of the right hand 

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:25.719
 let's go first and we should go 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:29.530
 varying in this case for example 

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:31.630
 let's drop first the bottom one the other 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.579
 medium and the other from the right hand to 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.430
 medium and we move a couple of times 

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:38.160
 other letters 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.610
 and get back on the right in other 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:44.070
 and next time we do we can 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.370
 drop the top one that would be this 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.370
 shape 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.700
 let's go first the top and then the 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.710
 move and in this case I would not be 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.030
 here or in the middle would be in the 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.990
 left 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.580
 that would be to vary the forms of 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:04.710
 that we throw the cards of the hand 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.710
 right and I would not have much more
