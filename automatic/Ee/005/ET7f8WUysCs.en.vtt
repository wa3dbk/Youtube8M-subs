well I went and I asked they suggested

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.330 
well I went and I asked they suggested
that<00:01:35.220> I<00:01:35.280> used<00:01:35.549> a<00:01:35.729> matte<00:01:35.939> velvet<00:01:36.270> plus<00:01:36.810> now<00:01:37.680> this

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
that I used a matte velvet plus now this

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.590 
that I used a matte velvet plus now this
is<00:01:38.400> a<00:01:38.579> foundation<00:01:40.579> what<00:01:41.579> I<00:01:41.759> really<00:01:42.240> don't<00:01:42.450> like

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
is a foundation what I really don't like

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.130 
is a foundation what I really don't like
about<00:01:42.869> this<00:01:43.170> foundation<00:01:43.860> is<00:01:44.009> the<00:01:44.460> size

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
about this foundation is the size

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.039 
about this foundation is the size
surprisingly<00:01:46.140> it<00:01:46.829> has<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.220> same<00:01:47.460> amount<00:01:47.790> as

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:48.049 
surprisingly it has the same amount as

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:50.810 
surprisingly it has the same amount as
this<00:01:49.049> foundation<00:01:49.829> I<00:01:50.070> guess<00:01:50.399> it's<00:01:50.610> just<00:01:50.670> the

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
this foundation I guess it's just the

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.660 
this foundation I guess it's just the
packaging<00:01:51.420> that<00:01:51.450> I'm<00:01:51.659> not<00:01:51.810> really<00:01:52.049> a<00:01:52.170> fan<00:01:52.259> of

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
packaging that I'm not really a fan of

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.060 
packaging that I'm not really a fan of

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560

there<00:03:36.920> was<00:03:37.070> a<00:03:37.130> new<00:03:37.430> one<00:03:37.700> like<00:03:37.940> two<00:03:38.240> months

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
there was a new one like two months

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.160 
there was a new one like two months
later<00:03:39.010> which<00:03:40.010> is<00:03:40.220> basically<00:03:41.090> same<00:03:41.540> packaging

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170 
later which is basically same packaging

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.410 
later which is basically same packaging
but<00:03:42.650> the<00:03:42.770> only<00:03:42.920> thing<00:03:43.040> is<00:03:43.370> that<00:03:43.400> this<00:03:43.970> part<00:03:44.330> is

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:44.420 
but the only thing is that this part is

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.690 
but the only thing is that this part is
gold<00:03:44.660> and<00:03:44.900> the<00:03:45.020> rest<00:03:45.230> is<00:03:45.380> black<00:03:45.709> because<00:03:46.280> this

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:46.700 
gold and the rest is black because this

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.420 
gold and the rest is black because this
is<00:03:47.000> in<00:03:47.240> the<00:03:47.390> black<00:03:47.630> lacquer<00:03:48.470> I<00:03:48.860> actually<00:03:49.130> like

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:49.430 
is in the black lacquer I actually like

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.990 
is in the black lacquer I actually like
this<00:03:49.580> one<00:03:49.640> better<00:03:50.030> than<00:03:50.840> the<00:03:50.900> gold<00:03:51.380> one

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
this one better than the gold one

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.650 
this one better than the gold one
because<00:03:53.000> it's<00:03:53.470> obviously<00:03:54.470> darker<00:03:55.100> and<00:03:55.370> I<00:03:56.300> feel

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
because it's obviously darker and I feel

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.210 
because it's obviously darker and I feel
