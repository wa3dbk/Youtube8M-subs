 Hello 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:22.700
 Let's start one more story in 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.009
 movement 

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:27.770
 today we will know the history of 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:28.880
 another object that is part of our 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:30.800
 day by day 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.140
 let's go together here at the historical museum 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.950
 municipal tonny toledo meet the 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:35.950
 history of the glasses 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:47.309
 the word sunglasses came from the popular term 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.890
 is that of classical antiquity this small 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:53.220
 was used to designate the holes 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:56.730
 made from the armor of the heads of 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:59.129
 soldiers who allowed them to arrive 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.050
 led by philosopher aristotle 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.670
 Greek defends the idea that 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.180
 image perception 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.560
 no relation between the brain eye 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:10.290
 believing that the emotion lies in the 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.050
 heart and therefore the vision had 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.390
 less importance in improving the 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:17.460
 human being and the glasses today are 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.009
 considered fashion accessories 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.770
 but it was not always so to get to 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:25.590
 this current status the glasses went through 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.990
 a long way you can find 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.390
 some references to the existence of 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:34.110
 glasses on some philosopher quotes 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.950
 Chinese Confucius the 500 years before 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.500
 Christ 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.080
 This is the first model of 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.820
 What is news? 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:45.000
 although the part has been manufactured in the 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.890
 18th century the model used in china since 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.320
 500 before Christ 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.890
 the first glasses were not 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.590
 lenses 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.650
 so they were used as adornment or 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.880
 form of social discrimination 

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.079
 especially in the case of patients 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.360
 mental 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.460
 yes from the first century after 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:06.150
 of Christ is that the first 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:09.329
 corrective lenses made with semi stones 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:11.820
 precious stones like rock crystal that were 

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:14.850
 cut into thin layers if 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:18.239
 magnifying lenses for 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:21.209
 and this was only possible thanks to the 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:23.430
 Arab mathematician to reason why close 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:25.920
 of the year 1000 after Christ formulated 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:29.040
 a theory on the incidence of light 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.299
 on the spherical mirrors and their action 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.880
 in the human eye 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:35.160
 monks who worked in the great 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:38.650
 libraries of europe were large 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:41.420
 benefited from this new artifact 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:44.600
 1.270 in Germany was created the first 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:47.660
 pair of lenses with united iron areas 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:52.190
 by rivets was similar to a compass 

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:54.500
 and had no stems this century 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:57.709
 influence was created another model 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:03:00.230
 which has been a great success granting 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:03.290
 Italian fame linked to glasses 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:05.630

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:08.270
 many researches it was possible to 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.620
 development of safer and more

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:38.360
 the use of plastic and its derivatives to 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:41.150
 the manufacture of weapons sanctions as well as 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:44.360
 the advancement of technology in the
