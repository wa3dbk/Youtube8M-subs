00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:03.810
 welcome to a new one 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.960
 weapons review this time it's about the ak 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.639
 July and indeed the ak fury is real 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.460
 a clever weapon you can do it in 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.049
 items just stop buying and you see 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.809
 certainly in every second game 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.570
 or in every second glory just stops 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.490
 well it was the same is just stop 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.560
 one of the weapon has either that 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.810
 the fury or the bees but most 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.820
 Of course , the fury has something clear, too 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.500
 is because if you already pay so much 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.449
 then properly for the better 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.460
 weapon because it is really worthwhile for 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.340
 you have the idea similar to him 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.629
 but I want to get it 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:41.489
 many do not really speak fury 

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:43.170
 I wanted to say yes is on everyone 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.210
 if you still get the fury 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.070
 want or just stop the pis let it 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.170
 with the pis really gets the fury 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.340
 The money is worth it because it is 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.260
 so much then sets a 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.329
 a bit further on it and then worth it 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.399
 Do it for more than it just has 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.800
 the bonus you can reset your kg 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:01.350
 and that is for one or some 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.820
 one or the other, it is better 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.379
 just better if you have the kd 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.330
 can reset for me too 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.770
 especially for is first game or something 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:14.490
 even if it's just for me 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:16.860
 Excuses are first game in any case 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.310
 so it has I have imagined 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:23.430
 there you have them for 93,000 750 p 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.560
 get and as well you already see the 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.409
 bus costs a hundred thousand now costs 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.990
 from july only nice what's your name 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:32.579
 only the cost now already 25,000 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.229
 Of course, cp is a bit much, though 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.700
 you could have pre-ordered the same 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.650
 so it would have been worth the 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.509
 to order one has still 20 place 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.750
 get and one or the other wins 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:44.399
 yes, it certainly does not matter 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:47.369
 the weapon is really a clever one 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.470
 weapon because that is just new 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.380
 designed and the sound was optimized 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.600
 So the contrast akr life for dak july 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.810
 On the other hand, it looks like shit I say it 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.640
 Yesterday I had the farmland and me 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.649
 really did not want to carry her anymore 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.880
 That's the best I can get 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.009
 to play live if you are all the time 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.600
 the fury had eyes for this one 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.610
 eye what actually the difference 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.410
 between dhabi and just the fury 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.880
 just is just this luminous 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:14.550
 eyes and content still the 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.560
 Small extra with the disadvantage that you 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:20.100
 can clear the kg and everything blablabla 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.690
 but yes the aka was new design because 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.850
 the blade has been redone so im 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.170
 neck the knife what's on the front of it that 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.980
 this can be activated with a right click 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:33.120
 bayonet that was redone against 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:36.780
 golden saber moderate no idea live 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:39.420
 and the front was just as content 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:42.720
 the front handle was just stop with 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.370
 a kite head decorated and decorated 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.900
 content the eye glows red what 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.130
 of course, really cool looks so 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.410
 For me, this definitely looks great 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:53.010
 from there is also up there where the sco 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:55.500
 could put a fire that's just stop 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.500
 decorated and decorated with these gold 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:01.350
 just stop these are gold and again 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:03.540
 lands so gold transforms yes and the 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:05.640
 other parts of the ak fury are also still 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.850
 gilded just like the evil but 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:11.160
 that they are really horny so this one 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.590
 Hue of this color mix is ​​just 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.750
 due to this red light eye 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.730
 is also moving in so it's because 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.250
 it leaves a slight red line so 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.630
 a trace and that's really cool 20 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.180
 one does not mean that a third person 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:26.400
 What the hell it really is clever 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.290
 to play with it so i really can 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.190
 Well, that makes headshots special 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.110
 even at a distance 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.670
 you really notice the power though 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.280
 it's actually normal for the ak 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:36.840
 these assets so these power you 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.360
 content distributed on the head makes a lot 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:43.890
 nice man on the upper body makes 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:46.709
 unfortunately they turned so 33 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:49.950
 to 37 damage so it's just like that 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:52.650
 it really spans times 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.180
 low high and so what 's up 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.760
 By the way, she does the crate too 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:59.459
 really good damage so that's not 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.480
 little she does through the moral but 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:02.370
 it is not much 

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:05.490
 So not one hundred percent, but it 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:08.310
 is really a lot and you do 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:13.020
 very often vocabulary so that is 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:15.510
 really succeeded that is hard on 

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:17.510
 The foot makes it to the 22 to 24 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:19.920
 the match 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:21.480
 and the iphone started talking about this here 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:23.100
 could activate with right click and 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:25.620
 that's just tough with it 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:28.110
 play but it is really tough too 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:30.720
 just stop killing if all 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:32.940
 suddenly come to you and you 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.290
 I really wanted to intervene even though I did 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.660
 actually the possibility have the 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:37.890
 shoot but what should I die 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.150
 All the time I am sorry that I am 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:40.920
 Do not make so many freaks with it 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:42.390
 could because I died the whole 

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:44.220
 when I was in front of him always has me 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:46.500
 had to have had eggs and a bag 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:48.650
 I just stop his creak manfred in 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:49.850
 held my face and pressed 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:53.190
 no matter 

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:55.890
 The realtime is really fast 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:59.790
 because that is really under two 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:01.770
 seconds so unfortunately my sony is vegas 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:03.390
 is a bit packed and shows 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:04.710
 somehow 127 on 

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:07.050
 but which somehow I do not believe 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:09.030
 can because then suddenly to three 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:12.390
 seconds change so I guess it is 

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:14.340
 so it's about 18 seconds so it 

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:15.360
 is really fast is one 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:16.710
 bit misjudged with my sony 

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.530
 vegas I am also sorry that I am 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:21.150
 can not measure exactly but currently 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:21.930
 frames somehow a bit weird 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.030
 no idea 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:25.080
 I am sorry but it is clearly below 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:27.150
 two seconds I can tell you 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.440
 that is clear in any case 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:30.420
 faster she also recovers from life 

00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:33.540
 stand out when I switch or 

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:36.360
 coffee or beast but we are at the 

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:38.550
 not forgotten from july and yes besides 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:41.880
 there are these bonuses that just stop her 

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:44.790
 itself gets 200,000 200 percent more 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:47.190
 experience and the others in the game so 

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:48.630
 also the opponents for example since now 

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:50.640
 Opel crack also get the blacklist 

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:53.760
 So all game just stop 

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:56.400
 just keep this bonus of your weapon 

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:59.360
 the fury has the special ability that 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:05.790
 get others 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:08.310
 20 30 30 percent more gp and 20 percent 

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:08.880
 more experience that was not 30,000 

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:11.940
 or something 

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:14.850
 I did not tell me anyway 

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:18.230
 she is not really running 

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:20.670
 really easy with it you can too 

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:22.710
 Perfect with it not mine you shoot 

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:26.670
 See that many freaks 

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:28.260
 do and I have 9 10 or 20 on 9 

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:29.550
 collected and I have it today 

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:31.050
 played again 

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:33.120
 and then there is time for this video 

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:35.580
 but it will be one last 

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:37.230
 to give with the fury so it makes me happy 

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:38.610
 in any case, to my storage 

00:06:37.230 --> 00:06:40.800
 In addition, they do not break at all 

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:42.660
 like weapons do not break and if 

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:45.690
 you let her dry so if you 

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:47.280
 So dies will be drop 

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:48.600
 not so other opponents can 

00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:50.580
 do not pick that up is really cool 

00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:53.310
 made so I like it you're fine 

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:55.440
 never break i mean you can if 

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:57.390
 you just pressed the weapon 

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:59.250
 then the other players can throw 

00:06:57.390 --> 00:07:03.150
 but if not want now and 

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:05.940
 they can not be killed 

00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:08.040
 So what 's the point ? Thank you 

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:09.390
 worth watching when I look at the aka 

00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:11.220

00:07:09.390 --> 00:07:13.170
