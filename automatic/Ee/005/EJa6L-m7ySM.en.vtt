00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.400
 Hello, how to install the driver for 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:09.000
 printers that we have 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:11.010
 Download the format zip means logic 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.920
 next we download the driver 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.670
 printer, we either info device at all 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.590
 disable unpacking driver 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.480
 install it 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:24.199
 then the device itself is removed under 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.550
 physically connect our printer lymph and 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:28.199
 system I mean video with automatic 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.529
 connect just installed 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.210
 driver since it already has a system it 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.920
 in general, now how it will be 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:41.190
 look like in reality like us 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:45.950
 the printer is this driver in its format 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.950
 zip we download and unpack 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:55.050
 e.g. using whole zip archive and 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:58.170
 unpacked we go we go 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.120
 further and look here there is no exe file 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.399
 which is running that is if it were 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.890
 gzip face files just run follow 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.560
 master's instructions and dancing and just 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.720
 if there is no exo file for example 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.930
 if the act as follows 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.330
 way the printer or mfp disconnect from 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:19.950
 computer go to the start menu panel 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:23.880
 control so equipment sound 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.600
 devices and printers so adding 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.979
 the printer 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.979
 choosing the necessary printer is missing and in 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:31.940
 we select to add the local to the list 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:34.880
 network printer 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:38.509
 almond and here we do n't care what to choose 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:42.290
 just click next click install with 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:47.000
 disk so 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:52.780
 We press the review we choose our unpacked 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:57.890
 folder this printer select file is ok 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:59.840
 ok you printer click further you have this 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:03.979
 don't be like the driver is not yet installed 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:06.619
 I will choose to replace further and wait for the installation 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:10.100
 printer so the printer is installed 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:12.769
 choose no share further ready 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:16.730
 all printer device us installed 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:19.910
 now we delete it all devices from 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:22.010
 us removed almost deleted us 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:24.860
 device but the driver itself remained 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:27.319
 the system now when we disappear here 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.870
 we physically connect our printer 

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:32.060
 Lemeshev turn it on and windows 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.160
 automatically folders necessary for him 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:38.380
 drivers 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:38.380
 that's all the logic thanks for your attention
