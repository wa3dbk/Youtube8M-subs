have a run-through of the pickups so we

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:29.620 
have a run-through of the pickups so we
start<00:01:28.430> with<00:01:28.520> a<00:01:28.580> clean<00:01:28.760> tone<00:01:28.940> on<00:01:29.120> the<00:01:29.150> amp<00:01:29.360> and

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:35.100 
start with a clean tone on the amp and
we'll<00:01:29.750> have<00:01:29.900> the<00:01:29.990> neck<00:01:30.170> pickup<00:01:30.410> first

what we'll do is the same again but this

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:01.959 
what we'll do is the same again but this
time<00:02:00.350> of<00:02:00.590> a<00:02:00.679> crunchy<00:02:01.069> tone<00:02:01.280> on<00:02:01.429> the<00:02:01.459> M<00:02:01.640> so

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:01.969 
time of a crunchy tone on the M so

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:12.070 
time of a crunchy tone on the M so
here's<00:02:02.240> the<00:02:02.420> neck<00:02:02.719> pick<00:02:02.899> up<00:02:10.750> middle<00:02:11.750> position

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
here's the neck pick up middle position

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:29.229 
here's the neck pick up middle position
a<00:02:19.870> fine<00:02:20.870> is<00:02:20.989> a<00:02:21.049> bridge

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:29.239 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:30.759 

so<00:02:29.810> let's<00:02:29.959> take<00:02:30.079> a<00:02:30.140> closer<00:02:30.410> look<00:02:30.530> at<00:02:30.709> the

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:30.769 
so let's take a closer look at the

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:32.710 
so let's take a closer look at the
actual<00:02:30.920> amp<00:02:31.220> itself<00:02:31.640> then<00:02:31.970> in<00:02:32.239> a<00:02:32.269> closer<00:02:32.510> look

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:32.720 
actual amp itself then in a closer look

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.229 
actual amp itself then in a closer look
at<00:02:32.840> the<00:02:32.930> amp<00:02:33.110> then<00:02:33.349> the<00:02:33.500> Elector<00:02:33.920> 15r<00:02:34.549> you've

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:35.239 
at the amp then the Elector 15r you've

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:36.670 
at the amp then the Elector 15r you've
got<00:02:35.450> two<00:02:35.660> channels<00:02:36.049> you've<00:02:36.170> got<00:02:36.290> a<00:02:36.319> clean

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
got two channels you've got a clean

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.740 
got two channels you've got a clean
channel<00:02:37.099> and<00:02:37.280> an<00:02:37.459> over<00:02:37.849> driven<00:02:38.150> channel<00:02:38.480> which

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
channel and an over driven channel which

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.270 
channel and an over driven channel which
actually<00:02:39.019> gets<00:02:39.200> quite<00:02:39.410> distorted<00:02:39.739> as<00:02:40.010> really

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
actually gets quite distorted as really

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.599 
actually gets quite distorted as really
good<00:02:40.430> and<00:02:40.640> if<00:02:41.269> you<00:02:41.359> have<00:02:41.569> the<00:02:41.780> the<00:02:42.049> button

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:42.609 
good and if you have the the button

00:02:42.609 --> 00:02:45.789 
good and if you have the the button
depressed<00:02:43.609> then<00:02:44.599> what<00:02:45.200> you<00:02:45.319> have<00:02:45.500> is<00:02:45.650> the

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:45.799 
depressed then what you have is the

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:47.470 
depressed then what you have is the
clean<00:02:46.010> channel<00:02:46.370> and<00:02:46.549> then<00:02:46.700> this<00:02:47.030> is<00:02:47.269> your

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:47.480 
clean channel and then this is your

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:50.289 
clean channel and then this is your
master<00:02:47.780> volume<00:02:48.430> and<00:02:49.430> then<00:02:49.579> you<00:02:49.730> if<00:02:49.970> you<00:02:50.060> push

00:02:50.289 --> 00:02:50.299 
master volume and then you if you push

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:51.759 
master volume and then you if you push
it<00:02:50.420> in<00:02:50.540> you<00:02:50.840> get<00:02:50.989> the<00:02:51.079> overdrive<00:02:51.500> channel

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
it in you get the overdrive channel

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:52.960 
it in you get the overdrive channel
which<00:02:51.859> is<00:02:51.950> you've<00:02:52.040> got<00:02:52.130> a<00:02:52.160> drive<00:02:52.459> and<00:02:52.730> then

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
which is you've got a drive and then

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:55.690 
which is you've got a drive and then
volume<00:02:53.239> and<00:02:53.599> it's<00:02:53.959> really<00:02:54.260> quite<00:02:54.470> loud<00:02:54.739> you've

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
volume and it's really quite loud you've

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.460 
volume and it's really quite loud you've
got<00:02:55.910> a<00:02:56.060> 3-band<00:02:56.510> equalizer<00:02:56.720> it's<00:02:57.109> got<00:02:57.230> trouble

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
got a 3-band equalizer it's got trouble

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:00.370 
got a 3-band equalizer it's got trouble
middle<00:02:57.680> base<00:02:58.099> here<00:02:58.790> and<00:02:59.000> then<00:02:59.630> the<00:03:00.139> added

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:00.380 
middle base here and then the added

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.430 
middle base here and then the added
bonus<00:03:00.859> of<00:03:01.160> some<00:03:01.639> reverb<00:03:01.970> on<00:03:02.150> the<00:03:02.269> end<00:03:02.389> which<00:03:03.319> is

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:03.440 
bonus of some reverb on the end which is

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:05.710 
bonus of some reverb on the end which is
quite<00:03:03.680> spacious<00:03:04.150> and<00:03:05.150> what<00:03:05.419> we're<00:03:05.540> going<00:03:05.690> to

idea<00:03:07.519> of<00:03:07.669> what<00:03:07.790> it<00:03:07.880> would<00:03:07.970> sound<00:03:08.209> like<00:03:08.359> in<00:03:08.720> your

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:09.319 
idea of what it would sound like in your

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:11.349 
idea of what it would sound like in your
home<00:03:09.560> so<00:03:09.980> to<00:03:10.040> speak<00:03:10.370> is<00:03:10.700> I'm<00:03:11.090> going<00:03:11.209> to<00:03:11.269> go

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:11.359 
home so to speak is I'm going to go

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:12.460 
home so to speak is I'm going to go
straight<00:03:11.690> out<00:03:11.840> of<00:03:11.900> the<00:03:12.049> headphone<00:03:12.440> socket

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
straight out of the headphone socket

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.099 
straight out of the headphone socket
when<00:03:13.310> you<00:03:13.400> do<00:03:13.639> that<00:03:13.849> it<00:03:14.150> disengages<00:03:14.690> the

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:15.109 
when you do that it disengages the

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:17.289 
when you do that it disengages the
speaker<00:03:15.560> so<00:03:16.190> you're<00:03:16.310> getting<00:03:16.519> just<00:03:16.849> the<00:03:17.060> sound

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299 
speaker so you're getting just the sound

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:19.120 
speaker so you're getting just the sound
of<00:03:17.419> the<00:03:17.480> amp<00:03:17.630> purely<00:03:18.290> the<00:03:18.380> amp<00:03:18.500> and<00:03:18.739> what<00:03:19.010> you

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
of the amp purely the amp and what you

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.990 
of the amp purely the amp and what you
would<00:03:19.280> get<00:03:19.400> if<00:03:19.519> you<00:03:19.549> were<00:03:19.700> putting<00:03:19.910> your

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
would get if you were putting your

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.449 
would get if you were putting your
headphones<00:03:20.480> on<00:03:20.829> so<00:03:21.829> we're<00:03:21.980> going<00:03:22.069> to<00:03:22.130> record

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
headphones on so we're going to record

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:24.520 
headphones on so we're going to record
everything<00:03:22.700> like<00:03:22.880> that<00:03:23.150> today<00:03:23.480> at<00:03:23.810> doing<00:03:24.410> that
