force them upon the floor which gives me
longer<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.270> line<00:01:15.390> any<00:01:15.539> flies<00:01:15.750> don't<00:01:15.930> gives<00:01:16.110> me

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
longer the line any flies don't gives me

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.900 
longer the line any flies don't gives me
a<00:01:16.229> lot<00:01:16.410> more<00:01:16.440> power<00:01:16.800> than<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.039> kick<00:01:17.250> okay

my<00:03:34.450> practice<00:03:35.450> down<00:03:35.840> to<00:03:36.140> the<00:03:36.230> flow<00:03:36.440> of<00:03:36.470> the

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
my practice down to the flow of the

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.530 
my practice down to the flow of the
technique<00:03:37.010> surfing<00:03:37.970> all<00:03:38.090> the<00:03:38.180> way<00:03:38.270> through
