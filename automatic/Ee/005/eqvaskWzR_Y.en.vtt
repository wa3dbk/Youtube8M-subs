00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.200
 go with us eddy firecracker leader of 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.370
 championship of France is healthy after a 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.020
 second place 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.630
 alpe d'huez is what you can us 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.860
 tell a little about your day but I tell you 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.540
 say started not too too well with 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.830
 the warm up this morning where is I 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.179
 lost the brake pads first 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.070
 a lot I did a very big fall 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.830
 it will not do a little shoulder 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:22.170
 so after jc manage for testing 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.029
 times I managed to achieve the 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.380
 fourth time and in two years 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:29.189
 I took JussiÃª ways departures 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.330
 this one to do my best but I 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.219
 I would be a little jostled in the 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:34.530
 first departure anyway I went out in 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.750
 eighth on the other and 4th where for the 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.000
 first race it was not very 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.309
 satisfying of the second round I 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.050
 got out this time 3rd of the first 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.450
 turn I tried to keep up the pace 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.440
 of the first two and I managed to 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.289
 watch for a quarter of an hour 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.940
 after aurelien lazy like a mistake 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.730
 do not follow these second ones and I wanted 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.670
 manage for the weekend place or 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.440
 second so in the championship are you 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.420
 take this first place I want 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.059
 to say virtual or provisional because the 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.680
 points 2-2 sylvain bidart will be awarded 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.119
 at the end of the year he made a good 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:07.970
 race today a good average 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:11.430
 how do you manage exactly this 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.990
 side this temporary side of the thing 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.970
 how are we doing in 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.259
 what state of mind but for now 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.240
 it's nice to be first but good 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:19.500
 it's shocking it's virtual it's a little 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.900
 little frustrating because I did not 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.549
 actually defeated with singapore for 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.530
 this place so I 'm going to prepare 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.930
 again 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.460
 everything until the next 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.360
 races and I visit do try to 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.790
 do my best to beat me 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.200
 precisely with him to try to 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.350
 show that I really am I 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:38.240
 deserves this position number one 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:38.750
 next castellet event on the 15th 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:40.040
 September 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.409
 what will be your program by then 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.960
 workout training a lot of 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:46.909
 bike for for endurance especially because 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.259
 that I have this weekend I managed to 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:51.140
 do both innings so I'm going 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:52.850
 try to continue on my momentum and I 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.009
 have prepared my weekend for the 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:58.420
 castelet but by then I'm going 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:58.420
 train physically done
