00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.939
 a friend of youtube how are you in 

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.670
 this time I bring you a small 

00:00:02.939 --> 00:00:09.240
 rainbow island gameplay game 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:11.490
 detail of the year 1987 flipped for the 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.410
 version of sega master system year 1923 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.660
 as you are seeing that it is the story of 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.550
 double bubble 2 good originally not 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.039
 has a lot to do but you have to 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.670
 recognize it game is very well currado 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:25.800
 and it's a great game come on are seven worlds and 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.420
 different phases in each world and we're going to 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.699
 take a very safe little dog if you liked it 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.850
 the game is in faster today created to be 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:35.670
 this is how this game is more complicated than 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.829
 the ticket but see where it looks go 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.960
 sea ​​bubble ball is complicated is 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.850
 entertaining but this is much more 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.379
 that I'm going to try to fail if I already 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.239
 fails in the gameplay of the double loop 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.000
 imagine how much I can fail 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.520
 here one of the games of sega master 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.920
 there are two for me it 's the best 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:55.649
 that came to be ported as 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.180
 google bubble and is that here I have to 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.640
 be faster unlike in a double 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.590
 it's not the same, it's the same, it's not 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.050
 the same is not the same road 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.600
 bad this is supposed to still level 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.820
 of stay 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.159
 but you have to say it is not a game that 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:12.890
 we can do the first change 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:15.470
 I took a while to do it for a while 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.600
 of the host the truth things as they are and 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.030
 I had to make more than one loan 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.950
 I was with all the credits had to 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:24.200
 use the truth I'm not going to cheat and there 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.380
 in surfing with death with the last 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.850
 credit with the last boss 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.860
 I recommend you play in the 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:33.430
 version that you can to which you want in 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:35.649
 the first one I played that's why I'm 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:38.950
 putting here I do not know if it came out too 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:40.990
 for nes it sounds to me that remains the same 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.210
 that the bule bule at the end told me if 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.520
 are talas the one that the gamers had 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:48.220
 played more you exist or on computers 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.720
 rather, in the food that I played 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.579
 bubble bowl exposes a friend's computer 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.250
 this this has a good tablet 

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:56.540
 Okay, okay for me, scandal, go 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.580
 so I save myself to work 

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.220
 it's difficult because if we skip the 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.930
 rainbow these that spears are going 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.210
 losing and they can annoy us 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:07.250
 Pretty or a game of your life bubble 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.750
 bobble was another kind of game but let's go 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.030
 to this game to the being of your life I can 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:14.880
 say that much more complicated 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.610
 good demanding and this and this that knows 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:20.040
 what the hell this is destroying everyone 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.230
 I do not know if acquiring a power is 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.209
 so for the good face to me is going to come 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.459
 of scandal things as they are not what 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:30.810
 grab it grab it grab it grab it grab your grab 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:33.330
 everything perfect everything taken but let's go 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.650
 for the third phase 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.960
 like many 10 phases but come on this is 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:41.590
 go shit on the milk threesome that is 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:43.660
 failed and we started with fault points 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:47.020
 game if I've seen it in the bazaar of 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:48.150
 xbox live if I remember correctly in hd play 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.790
 to the demo 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:53.370
 It's fine but it has no essence for me 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.230
 of what is this game is not enough 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.439
 all you want is well entertained 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:00.840
 but it's not not this game is not the 

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:03.959
 same be it but to take the time 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:07.200
 I would be watching for now I did not decide to 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:09.359
 buy me because he does not call me so much 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:11.640
 like to buy me that game 

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:15.329
 I like playing the classic version 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:18.269
 Again and again I do not see why failures 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:19.680
 more stupid I'm committing if it's that 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:22.500
 It gives me a lot of courage to kill me 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.840
 enemy that appears from nowhere and now 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.000
 you catch the first change it kills you 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.680
 It gives me a lot of courage but I do not know 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.239
 You can do everything at once 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.060
 we are going to take everything so that they give us 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:35.430
 lives is the most important thing 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.989
 always get an extra life but I know 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.760
 where does the dessert come from but that's good 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.730
 if the colleague is hungry you do not see no no 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.280
 I'm going to make that nonsense 

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:46.010
 knowing me they would kill me they would kill me 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:49.319
 I'm sure I'll catch this too 100 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:51.659
 point nothing else give us little 

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:53.519
 I will not follow the pattern of 

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:55.139
 enemies the truth is that you're supposed to 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:57.749
 the continuation of google voley but 

00:03:55.139 --> 00:04:00.450
 this game is not that I know you're not a 

00:03:57.749 --> 00:04:02.400
 dragon and nothing but as a continuation 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.989
 direct a 10 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.420
 that is clear but as a continuation 

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:07.879
 direct today choose all that all 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.590
 have given up a life they will have given me 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:13.290
 if they have given me go as a 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:16.680
 Following us direct is quite 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:19.979
 well the castle levels begin 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:21.690
 complicated of the milk and well fast 

00:04:19.979 --> 00:04:23.910
 well we're going like that we were the ones who were all in 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.770
 plan that I fall is the problem 

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:28.320
 clear that if we fall on the doll in 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.430
 the air we can not control writing 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.650
 that the spider and I will do the 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.849
 impossible life thing that I do not want there 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:35.370
 the rays no longer come out this 

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:37.349
 they removed what is coming now so that if 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:40.199
 I really need not but now 

00:04:37.349 --> 00:04:42.300
 has another thing that is throwing 10,500 

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:44.009
 rainbow and throws two by two bow and 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.139
 good 

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:47.339
 come on let's go the truth that a game 

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:49.680
 quite entertaining with what you can 

00:04:47.339 --> 00:04:51.479
 kill more than one afternoon and you can 

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.219
 get to do since it has enough 

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:54.990
 let's continue what you get in the game 

00:04:53.219 --> 00:04:57.780
 why 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.890
 but what the hell has happened is that I radio 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:00.690
 a lot because I do not understand many 

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:02.880
 times the game stays there and says 

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:05.130
 if it continues and here comes the box the 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:06.900
 The spider's attack calls itself good 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:09.390
 to the spider is that looks like I 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:13.430
 will kill according to take shot 

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:13.430
 I'm going to fulminate, I'm going to finish it 

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:19.580
 and they are already completed facilito 

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:21.469
 and good friends of youtube me 

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.059
 go saying goodbye here I hope you like it 

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:26.169
 the game that you try it and we see the 

00:05:23.059 --> 00:05:26.169
 next video until next time
