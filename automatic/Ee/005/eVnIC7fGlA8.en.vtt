00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:48.800 
huh oh that's dangerous for Alex if he

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.620 
huh oh that's dangerous for Alex if he
thinks<00:00:49.040> that<00:00:49.250> well<00:00:49.730> the<00:00:49.820> straw<00:00:50.090> house<00:00:50.360> is

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:50.630 
thinks that well the straw house is

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.650 
thinks that well the straw house is
chips<00:00:50.960> and<00:00:51.830> if<00:00:52.040> he<00:00:52.130> puts<00:00:52.490> care<00:00:52.820> on<00:00:52.910> on<00:00:53.060> a<00:00:53.090> draw<00:00:53.390> I

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660 
chips and if he puts care on on a draw I

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.290 
chips and if he puts care on on a draw I
guess<00:00:54.230> he<00:00:54.350> can<00:00:54.470> call<00:00:54.820> and<00:00:55.820> if<00:00:55.970> I<00:00:56.030> was<00:00:56.150> in<00:00:56.239> his

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
guess he can call and if I was in his

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.090 
guess he can call and if I was in his
position<00:00:56.390> maybe<00:00:56.840> I'd<00:00:57.050> put<00:00:57.260> him<00:00:57.290> on<00:00:57.470> a<00:00:57.500> draw<00:00:57.830> but

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:58.100 
position maybe I'd put him on a draw but

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:59.710 
position maybe I'd put him on a draw but
