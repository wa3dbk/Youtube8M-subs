00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
forage based chance so oftentimes early

5<00:02:22.750> inch<00:02:23.230> bass<00:02:23.470> occasionally<00:02:24.400> you'll<00:02:24.520> stick<00:02:24.760> a

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
5 inch bass occasionally you'll stick a

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.460 
5 inch bass occasionally you'll stick a
tin<00:02:25.150> sure<00:02:25.300> an<00:02:25.420> out<00:02:25.540> but<00:02:25.780> give<00:02:26.050> your<00:02:26.200> drag<00:02:26.440> a

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
tin sure an out but give your drag a

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.170 
tin sure an out but give your drag a
little<00:02:26.650> bit<00:02:26.890> of<00:02:26.980> a<00:02:27.040> pull<00:02:27.250> on<00:02:27.520> to<00:02:27.730> pound<00:02:27.970> test

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
little bit of a pull on to pound test

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.590 
little bit of a pull on to pound test
it's<00:02:28.420> a<00:02:28.480> pretty<00:02:28.600> kick-ass<00:02:28.960> but<00:02:30.570> when<00:02:31.570> I

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
it's a pretty kick-ass but when I

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.420 
it's a pretty kick-ass but when I
thought<00:02:31.810> about<00:02:31.870> a<00:02:32.110> little<00:02:32.320> bit<00:02:32.470> more<00:02:32.770> I<00:02:33.040> came

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
thought about a little bit more I came

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.750 
thought about a little bit more I came
to<00:02:33.580> a<00:02:33.610> realization<00:02:33.910> that<00:02:35.340> you<00:02:36.340> usually<00:02:36.490> need

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
to a realization that you usually need

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.150 
to a realization that you usually need
to<00:02:36.820> throw<00:02:37.120> a<00:02:37.360> bigger<00:02:37.750> lure<00:02:38.050> to<00:02:38.770> get<00:02:38.890> the<00:02:38.980> bigger

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:39.160 
to throw a bigger lure to get the bigger

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:41.120 
to throw a bigger lure to get the bigger
fish<00:02:39.490> you'll<00:02:39.670> still<00:02:39.910> stick<00:02:40.180> small<00:02:40.450> fish<00:02:40.750> but

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
fish you'll still stick small fish but

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.800 
fish you'll still stick small fish but
it<00:02:42.130> goes<00:02:42.370> the<00:02:42.940> point<00:02:43.180> I'm<00:02:43.270> trying<00:02:43.300> to<00:02:43.510> get<00:02:43.660> on

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
it goes the point I'm trying to get on

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.800 
it goes the point I'm trying to get on
is<00:02:44.070> there's<00:02:45.070> a<00:02:45.130> little<00:02:45.400> bit<00:02:45.550> of<00:02:45.580> a<00:02:45.820> energy

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
is there's a little bit of a energy

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.350 
is there's a little bit of a energy
expenditure<00:02:47.620> theory<00:02:48.400> I<00:02:48.580> guess<00:02:48.820> I<00:02:49.060> can

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
expenditure theory I guess I can

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.240 
expenditure theory I guess I can
probably<00:02:49.750> define<00:02:50.230> that<00:02:50.380> there's<00:02:51.040> probably

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:51.250 
probably define that there's probably

probably define that there's probably
that<00:02:51.430> exact<00:02:51.700> name<00:02:51.850> before<00:02:52.060> I<00:02:52.120> can't<00:02:52.300> think<00:02:52.510> of

that exact name before I can't think of

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:56.790 
that exact name before I can't think of
it<00:02:52.660> right<00:02:52.720> now<00:02:52.980> but<00:02:53.980> the<00:02:54.670> bottom<00:02:55.120> line<00:02:55.300> is<00:02:55.800> bass

more energy trying to pursue this
mosquito<00:03:26.860> fish<00:03:27.040> then<00:03:27.610> it<00:03:27.760> is<00:03:27.880> actually

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
mosquito fish then it is actually

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.710 
mosquito fish then it is actually

gaining in any energy for media now
let's<00:03:31.930> take<00:03:32.140> this<00:03:32.350> here<00:03:32.620> X<00:03:32.800> own<00:03:33.900> wacky<00:03:34.900> leech

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 
let's take this here X own wacky leech

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.710 
let's take this here X own wacky leech
alright<00:03:35.620> it's<00:03:35.770> a<00:03:35.800> little<00:03:36.040> bit<00:03:36.160> bigger<00:03:36.720> usually

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
alright it's a little bit bigger usually

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.570 
alright it's a little bit bigger usually
that's<00:03:37.870> gonna<00:03:38.110> ignite<00:03:38.500> a<00:03:38.740> little<00:03:39.130> more<00:03:39.280> bites

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580 
that's gonna ignite a little more bites

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:41.430 
that's gonna ignite a little more bites
you<00:03:40.120> probably<00:03:40.390> won't<00:03:40.540> hook<00:03:40.720> the<00:03:40.930> bass<00:03:41.080> but

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
you probably won't hook the bass but

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.320 
you probably won't hook the bass but
that's<00:03:41.560> you<00:03:41.950> know<00:03:41.980> you<00:03:42.100> go<00:03:42.280> your<00:03:42.550> bite<00:03:42.910> ratio

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:43.330 
that's you know you go your bite ratio

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:46.080 
that's you know you go your bite ratio
increases<00:03:44.100> so<00:03:45.100> that's<00:03:45.280> a<00:03:45.340> little<00:03:45.459> topic<00:03:45.910> to

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
increases so that's a little topic to

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:48.840 
increases so that's a little topic to
think<00:03:46.540> about<00:03:47.190> lures<00:03:48.190> that<00:03:48.280> I've<00:03:48.400> been<00:03:48.520> trying

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:48.850 
think about lures that I've been trying

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:50.100 
think about lures that I've been trying
out<00:03:49.030> but<00:03:49.240> I<00:03:49.270> haven't<00:03:49.510> necessarily<00:03:49.570> had

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.110 
out but I haven't necessarily had

out but I haven't necessarily had

idea<00:04:11.260> I<00:04:11.320> haven't<00:04:11.680> really<00:04:12.010> been<00:04:12.130> able<00:04:12.220> to<00:04:12.400> try

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:12.580 
idea I haven't really been able to try

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:15.300 
idea I haven't really been able to try
it<00:04:12.640> enough<00:04:12.910> but<00:04:13.150> it<00:04:13.270> might<00:04:13.420> work<00:04:13.450> but<00:04:14.310> I've

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:15.310 
it enough but it might work but I've

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.330 
it enough but it might work but I've
been<00:04:15.400> throwing<00:04:15.640> a<00:04:15.730> lot<00:04:15.850> of<00:04:15.970> bigger<00:04:16.120> baits<00:04:16.420> like

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
been throwing a lot of bigger baits like

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.320 
been throwing a lot of bigger baits like
six-inch<00:04:18.340> worms<00:04:18.609> I<00:04:18.700> really<00:04:18.910> have<00:04:19.030> one<00:04:19.209> out

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:19.330 
six-inch worms I really have one out

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:21.240 
six-inch worms I really have one out
here<00:04:19.480> but<00:04:19.600> this<00:04:19.660> is<00:04:19.810> like<00:04:19.900> a<00:04:19.930> seven<00:04:20.290> inch<00:04:20.410> and<00:04:20.770> I

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
here but this is like a seven inch and I

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.100 
here but this is like a seven inch and I
would<00:04:21.460> wacky<00:04:21.880> rig<00:04:22.090> it<00:04:22.240> and<00:04:22.390> shred<00:04:22.870> it<00:04:22.900> on<00:04:23.020> the

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
would wacky rig it and shred it on the

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:24.350 
would wacky rig it and shred it on the
surface<00:04:23.350> or<00:04:24.010> I<00:04:24.040> would

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
surface or I would

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.809 
surface or I would
Popat<00:04:24.780> let's<00:04:25.530> lure<00:04:26.009> sink<00:04:26.280> to<00:04:26.340> the<00:04:26.430> bottom<00:04:26.460> and

00:04:26.809 --> 00:04:26.819 
Popat let's lure sink to the bottom and

00:04:26.819 --> 00:04:28.749 
Popat let's lure sink to the bottom and
that<00:04:27.030> usually<00:04:27.180> triggers<00:04:27.659> a<00:04:27.689> reaction<00:04:27.960> button

00:04:28.749 --> 00:04:28.759 
that usually triggers a reaction button

00:04:28.759 --> 00:04:30.950 
that usually triggers a reaction button
so<00:04:29.759> this<00:04:29.909> pretty<00:04:30.090> much<00:04:30.270> goes<00:04:30.449> back<00:04:30.659> to<00:04:30.810> my

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:30.960 
so this pretty much goes back to my

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.740 
so this pretty much goes back to my
point<00:04:30.990> about<00:04:31.909> fish<00:04:32.909> expanding<00:04:33.479> the<00:04:33.539> least

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
point about fish expanding the least

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.659 
point about fish expanding the least
amount<00:04:33.990> of<00:04:34.110> energy<00:04:34.259> to<00:04:34.889> gain<00:04:35.129> the<00:04:35.310> most<00:04:35.460> amount

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:35.669 
amount of energy to gain the most amount

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:38.050 
amount of energy to gain the most amount
of<00:04:35.759> energy<00:04:36.120> just<00:04:36.960> think<00:04:37.229> of<00:04:37.349> it<00:04:37.469> like<00:04:37.590> people

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
of energy just think of it like people

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:43.129 
of energy just think of it like people
if<00:04:39.060> you<00:04:39.300> have<00:04:39.569> a<00:04:40.050> cheeseburger<00:04:41.449> that<00:04:42.449> is<00:04:42.659> on

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:43.139 
if you have a cheeseburger that is on

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:44.869 
if you have a cheeseburger that is on
your<00:04:43.319> table<00:04:43.500> that's<00:04:44.159> only<00:04:44.310> like<00:04:44.460> two<00:04:44.639> feet

00:04:44.869 --> 00:04:44.879 
your table that's only like two feet

00:04:44.879 --> 00:04:49.580 
your table that's only like two feet
away<00:04:45.000> from<00:04:45.180> you<00:04:45.530> versus<00:04:46.530> maybe<00:04:47.400> a<00:04:48.439> piece<00:04:49.439> of

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
away from you versus maybe a piece of

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.290 
away from you versus maybe a piece of
candy<00:04:50.009> that's<00:04:50.189> like<00:04:50.310> 10<00:04:50.550> feet<00:04:50.729> away<00:04:50.789> from<00:04:51.000> you

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:51.300 
candy that's like 10 feet away from you

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.350 
candy that's like 10 feet away from you
which<00:04:51.719> one<00:04:51.900> would<00:04:51.990> you<00:04:52.080> go<00:04:52.319> for<00:04:52.500> first<00:04:52.879> if<00:04:53.879> it

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
which one would you go for first if it

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:56.240 
which one would you go for first if it
were<00:04:54.449> me<00:04:54.599> I'd<00:04:54.750> go<00:04:54.780> for<00:04:54.990> that<00:04:55.050> cheeseburger<00:04:55.439> get

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:56.250 
were me I'd go for that cheeseburger get

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:57.379 
were me I'd go for that cheeseburger get
the<00:04:56.340> most<00:04:56.520> amount<00:04:56.669> of<00:04:56.819> energy<00:04:57.090> with<00:04:57.240> least

00:04:57.379 --> 00:04:57.389 
the most amount of energy with least

00:04:57.389 --> 00:04:59.330 
the most amount of energy with least
amount<00:04:57.599> energy<00:04:57.750> expended<00:04:58.379> that's<00:04:59.159> just

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
amount energy expended that's just

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:02.029 
amount energy expended that's just
thinking<00:04:59.580> smart<00:05:00.620> fishing<00:05:01.620> you're<00:05:01.710> the<00:05:01.800> exact

00:05:02.029 --> 00:05:02.039 
thinking smart fishing you're the exact

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:04.279 
thinking smart fishing you're the exact
same<00:05:02.250> thing<00:05:02.599> they<00:05:03.599> wouldn't<00:05:03.870> go<00:05:03.960> out<00:05:04.080> of<00:05:04.169> their

00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:04.289 
same thing they wouldn't go out of their

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:06.230 
same thing they wouldn't go out of their
comfort<00:05:04.439> zone<00:05:04.819> pursuing<00:05:05.819> something<00:05:05.969> really

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 
comfort zone pursuing something really

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.260 
comfort zone pursuing something really
tiny<00:05:07.039> by<00:05:08.039> expending<00:05:08.460> a<00:05:08.520> ridiculous<00:05:09.029> amount<00:05:09.240> of

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
tiny by expending a ridiculous amount of

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.540 
tiny by expending a ridiculous amount of
energy<00:05:09.599> they'd<00:05:09.930> rather<00:05:10.110> go<00:05:10.349> for<00:05:10.590> a<00:05:10.650> big<00:05:10.860> large

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:11.550 
energy they'd rather go for a big large

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:15.469 
energy they'd rather go for a big large
easy<00:05:11.879> meal<00:05:13.879> using<00:05:14.879> the<00:05:15.029> least<00:05:15.210> amount<00:05:15.360> of

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:15.479 
easy meal using the least amount of

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:19.010 
easy meal using the least amount of
energy<00:05:16.069> so<00:05:17.069> I<00:05:17.629> probably<00:05:18.629> want<00:05:18.900> on<00:05:18.960> a

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:19.020 
energy so I probably want on a

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:20.360 
energy so I probably want on a
ridiculous<00:05:19.469> tangent<00:05:19.830> here<00:05:19.949> but<00:05:20.129> that's<00:05:20.219> the

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:20.370 
ridiculous tangent here but that's the

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:22.339 
ridiculous tangent here but that's the
point<00:05:20.610> for<00:05:20.849> this<00:05:20.939> video<00:05:21.270> hope<00:05:22.169> you<00:05:22.289> guys

00:05:22.339 --> 00:05:22.349 
point for this video hope you guys

point for this video hope you guys
enjoyed<00:05:22.860> it<00:05:22.889> I<00:05:23.219> hope<00:05:23.310> you<00:05:23.550> guys<00:05:23.610> use<00:05:24.000> it<00:05:24.180> and

enjoyed it I hope you guys use it and
