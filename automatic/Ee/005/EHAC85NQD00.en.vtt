00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.980 
the obvious ingredient and that's our
marshmallows<00:00:14.250> now<00:00:14.910> ideally<00:00:15.389> if<00:00:15.690> you<00:00:15.809> just

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
marshmallows now ideally if you just

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.570 
marshmallows now ideally if you just
want<00:00:16.139> to<00:00:16.170> make<00:00:16.289> a<00:00:16.320> white<00:00:16.650> marshmallow<00:00:17.400> fondant

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
want to make a white marshmallow fondant

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.300 
want to make a white marshmallow fondant
only<00:00:18.240> use<00:00:18.420> the<00:00:18.570> white<00:00:18.779> marshmallows<00:00:19.380> but<00:00:20.100> if

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
only use the white marshmallows but if

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.130 
only use the white marshmallows but if
you<00:00:20.400> go<00:00:20.520> into<00:00:20.699> coloring<00:00:21.240> like<00:00:21.420> iron<00:00:21.750> then<00:00:22.050> it

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
you go into coloring like iron then it

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.179 
you go into coloring like iron then it
really<00:00:22.350> makes<00:00:22.500> no<00:00:22.680> difference<00:00:22.830> whatsoever

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
really makes no difference whatsoever

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.950 
really makes no difference whatsoever
because<00:00:23.670> the<00:00:23.910> color<00:00:24.119> isn't<00:00:24.390> that<00:00:24.539> strong<00:00:24.840> in

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
because the color isn't that strong in

have a machine with a dough hook on it

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.840 
have a machine with a dough hook on it
just<00:01:10.680> put<00:01:10.770> some<00:01:11.010> gloves<00:01:11.189> on<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.460> you<00:01:11.729> can

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
just put some gloves on and you can

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.149 
just put some gloves on and you can
easily<00:01:12.060> do<00:01:12.390> this<00:01:12.479> by<00:01:12.540> hand<00:01:13.020> basically<00:01:14.010> all

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
easily do this by hand basically all

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.340 
easily do this by hand basically all
you're<00:01:14.340> going<00:01:14.460> to<00:01:14.640> do<00:01:14.790> is<00:01:15.030> knead<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.900> icing

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
you're going to do is knead the icing

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.600 
you're going to do is knead the icing
sugar<00:01:16.380> throughout<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.460> marshmallow<00:01:17.970> mixture

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
sugar throughout the marshmallow mixture

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.740 
sugar throughout the marshmallow mixture
okay<00:01:20.610> as<00:01:20.759> you<00:01:20.820> consider<00:01:21.060> it's<00:01:21.270> mixing<00:01:21.570> through

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
okay as you consider it's mixing through

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.350 
okay as you consider it's mixing through
so<00:01:21.810> I'm<00:01:21.990> going<00:01:22.200> to<00:01:22.290> add<00:01:22.409> in<00:01:22.560> some<00:01:22.590> more<00:01:23.299> and<00:01:24.299> I'm

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
so I'm going to add in some more and I'm

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.730 
so I'm going to add in some more and I'm
just<00:01:24.450> going<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:24.630> keep<00:01:24.780> on<00:01:24.900> doing<00:01:25.170> that<00:01:25.200> until

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
just going to keep on doing that until

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.270 
just going to keep on doing that until
we<00:01:25.830> get<00:01:25.979> to<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.220> desired<00:01:26.640> consistency<00:01:28.280> so

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
we get to the desired consistency so

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.490 
we get to the desired consistency so
once<00:01:29.490> all<00:01:29.610> your<00:01:29.729> icing<00:01:30.090> sugar<00:01:30.210> is<00:01:30.390> in<00:01:30.540> we're

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
once all your icing sugar is in we're

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.319 
once all your icing sugar is in we're
