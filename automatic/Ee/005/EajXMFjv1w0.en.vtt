00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.540 
gets hard to catch up if you get into a
collision<00:02:20.940> so<00:02:21.210> try<00:02:21.690> to<00:02:21.750> prevent<00:02:22.320> that<00:02:22.590> I<00:02:22.860> think

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:23.550 
collision so try to prevent that I think

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:24.500 
collision so try to prevent that I think
there's<00:02:23.670> a<00:02:23.730> shortcut<00:02:24.000> right<00:02:24.210> here<00:02:24.330> so<00:02:24.450> I'm

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
there's a shortcut right here so I'm

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:31.640 
there's a shortcut right here so I'm
going<00:02:24.630> to<00:02:24.660> turn<00:02:24.810> right<00:02:28.700> and<00:02:29.700> a<00:02:30.450> tip<00:02:30.690> for<00:02:31.200> you<00:02:31.410> is

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
going to turn right and a tip for you is

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:37.040 
going to turn right and a tip for you is
to<00:02:33.560> do<00:02:34.560> smooth<00:02:34.890> turns<00:02:35.400> because<00:02:35.790> when<00:02:36.720> you<00:02:36.870> do

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:37.050 
to do smooth turns because when you do

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:43.940 
to do smooth turns because when you do
sharp<00:02:37.440> turns<00:02:37.740> it<00:02:38.070> slows<00:02:38.430> you<00:02:38.640> down<00:02:42.740> alright<00:02:43.740> so

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
sharp turns it slows you down alright so

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.490 
sharp turns it slows you down alright so
this<00:02:44.940> is<00:02:45.120> actually<00:02:45.270> hard<00:02:45.720> talking<00:02:46.110> while

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
this is actually hard talking while

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.100 
this is actually hard talking while
showing<00:02:47.040> you<00:02:47.190> the<00:02:47.280> game<00:02:47.430> so<00:02:47.700> look<00:02:48.630> on<00:02:48.810> the

showing you the game so look on the

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:51.290 
showing you the game so look on the
upper<00:02:49.440> left<00:02:49.650> corner<00:02:49.920> that<00:02:50.880> will<00:02:51.030> show<00:02:51.240> you
