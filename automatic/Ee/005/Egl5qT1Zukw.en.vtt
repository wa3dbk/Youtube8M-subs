and<00:02:36.830> I've<00:02:37.340> also<00:02:37.550> heard<00:02:37.820> this<00:02:38.380> after<00:02:41.920> the<00:02:42.920> third

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
and I've also heard this after the third

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:49.270 
and I've also heard this after the third
year<00:02:43.520> is<00:02:44.060> when<00:02:45.550> you<00:02:46.550> started<00:02:46.880> to<00:02:46.940> see<00:02:47.090> a<00:02:48.250> bit<00:02:49.250> of

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
year is when you started to see a bit of

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.950 
year is when you started to see a bit of
a<00:02:49.430> growth<00:02:49.610> spurt<00:02:49.820> so<00:02:50.180> I'm<00:02:50.300> kind<00:02:50.510> of<00:02:50.540> hoping<00:02:50.750> for

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:50.960 
a growth spurt so I'm kind of hoping for

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:52.440 
a growth spurt so I'm kind of hoping for
that

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
dreams or my locks they did not appear

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.699 
dreams or my locks they did not appear
to<00:03:12.349> be<00:03:12.530> thin<00:03:13.599> camera<00:03:14.599> but<00:03:14.900> to<00:03:15.050> me<00:03:15.260> they<00:03:15.500> just

00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:15.709 
to be thin camera but to me they just

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:22.850 
to be thin camera but to me they just
say<00:03:15.860> anything<00:03:18.099> but<00:03:19.099> um

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.160 

have<00:03:23.550> a<00:03:23.850> ton<00:03:24.090> of<00:03:24.120> their<00:03:24.360> hands<00:03:24.750> and<00:03:24.870> you<00:03:25.020> guys

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
have a ton of their hands and you guys

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:35.130 
have a ton of their hands and you guys
probably<00:03:25.620> already<00:03:25.860> know<00:03:28.040> they're<00:03:29.040> all<00:03:29.190> over

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:40.450 

see<00:03:35.800> there<00:03:36.040> is<00:03:36.280> this<00:03:36.550> one<00:03:36.790> for<00:03:37.060> example

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:40.460 

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:43.540 

actually<00:03:41.270> first<00:03:41.630> of<00:03:41.780> all<00:03:41.900> there<00:03:42.650> is<00:03:42.950> the<00:03:43.340> new

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:43.550 
actually first of all there is the new

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:49.520 
actually first of all there is the new
growth

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:49.530 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.309 

a<00:03:49.590> new<00:03:49.860> growth<00:03:50.130> and<00:03:50.750> it's<00:03:51.750> actually<00:03:51.990> connected

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 
a new growth and it's actually connected

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:59.830 
a new growth and it's actually connected
all<00:03:52.920> the<00:03:52.980> way<00:03:53.250> up<00:03:53.400> until<00:03:53.990> this<00:03:54.990> point<00:03:55.250> here

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:04.119 

so<00:04:00.379> I<00:04:00.860> actually<00:04:01.129> not<00:04:01.489> a<00:04:01.550> twisty<00:04:02.739> the<00:04:03.739> other<00:04:03.890> day

00:04:04.119 --> 00:04:04.129 
so I actually not a twisty the other day

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:06.430 
so I actually not a twisty the other day
and<00:04:04.459> I<00:04:04.730> got<00:04:04.910> bored<00:04:05.150> and<00:04:05.450> I<00:04:05.540> started<00:04:05.930> pulling

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
and I got bored and I started pulling

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.020 
and I got bored and I started pulling
the<00:04:06.560> part<00:04:06.830> and<00:04:06.950> you<00:04:07.010> can<00:04:07.099> actually<00:04:07.280> hear<00:04:07.700> the

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:08.030 
the part and you can actually hear the

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:11.680 
the part and you can actually hear the
babies<00:04:08.480> just<00:04:08.690> like<00:04:09.250> really<00:04:10.250> it<00:04:10.700> was<00:04:10.940> even<00:04:11.330> try

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
babies just like really it was even try

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:13.180 
babies just like really it was even try
wasn't<00:04:12.110> wedding<00:04:12.379> so<00:04:12.470> I<00:04:12.530> decided<00:04:12.860> pulling

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:13.190 
wasn't wedding so I decided pulling

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.309 
wasn't wedding so I decided pulling
apart<00:04:13.310> and<00:04:14.120> you<00:04:14.180> actually<00:04:14.330> hear<00:04:14.720> descending

00:04:15.309 --> 00:04:15.319 
apart and you actually hear descending

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:16.599 
apart and you actually hear descending
like<00:04:15.440> a<00:04:15.470> grape<00:04:15.769> and<00:04:16.010> it<00:04:16.070> was<00:04:16.190> actually<00:04:16.370> pretty

00:04:16.599 --> 00:04:16.609 
like a grape and it was actually pretty

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:20.860 
like a grape and it was actually pretty
about<00:04:17.560> he's<00:04:18.560> my<00:04:18.680> best<00:04:18.889> friend<00:04:18.979> could<00:04:19.250> hear<00:04:19.870> so

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
about he's my best friend could hear so

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.909 
about he's my best friend could hear so
much<00:04:21.019> from<00:04:21.650> when<00:04:21.799> she<00:04:21.859> was<00:04:22.040> sitting<00:04:22.510> um<00:04:23.919> for

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:24.919 
much from when she was sitting um for

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:26.650 
much from when she was sitting um for
the<00:04:24.979> past<00:04:25.220> probably<00:04:25.550> six<00:04:26.150> months<00:04:26.240> there's

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
the past probably six months there's

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:29.680 
the past probably six months there's
been<00:04:26.720> a<00:04:26.840> lot<00:04:27.139> of<00:04:27.169> shedding<00:04:27.970> I<00:04:28.970> don't<00:04:29.150> know<00:04:29.270> how

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
been a lot of shedding I don't know how

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.840 
been a lot of shedding I don't know how
long<00:04:29.930> that<00:04:29.990> is<00:04:30.199> but<00:04:30.889> he<00:04:31.310> was<00:04:31.460> a<00:04:31.490> ton<00:04:31.820> of

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:31.850 
long that is but he was a ton of

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:34.810 
long that is but he was a ton of
shedding<00:04:32.440> I<00:04:33.440> don't<00:04:34.190> know<00:04:34.280> maybe<00:04:34.490> we<00:04:34.669> just

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:34.820 
shedding I don't know maybe we just

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.810 
shedding I don't know maybe we just
drive<00:04:35.090> to<00:04:35.510> the<00:04:35.570> thinking<00:04:36.260> once<00:04:36.440> or<00:04:36.650> whatever

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:38.820 
drive to the thinking once or whatever

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:40.880 
drive to the thinking once or whatever
a lot<00:04:39.750> of<00:04:39.780> shedding<00:04:40.110> which<00:04:40.500> is<00:04:40.680> actually

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:40.890 
a lot of shedding which is actually

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:45.470 
a lot of shedding which is actually
becoming<00:04:41.510> it<00:04:42.510> was<00:04:44.030> making<00:04:45.030> me<00:04:45.090> feel<00:04:45.240> kind<00:04:45.390> of

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:45.480 
becoming it was making me feel kind of

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:46.239 
becoming it was making me feel kind of
weird

00:04:46.239 --> 00:04:46.249 
weird

00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:48.309 
weird
I<00:04:46.339> just<00:04:46.879> thought<00:04:47.029> maybe<00:04:47.209> it<00:04:47.749> was<00:04:47.899> thinning

00:04:48.309 --> 00:04:48.319 
I just thought maybe it was thinning

00:04:48.319 --> 00:04:51.369 
I just thought maybe it was thinning
hours<00:04:48.589> in<00:04:48.739> Kannada<00:04:49.039> but<00:04:49.599> so<00:04:50.599> sheds<00:04:50.839> a<00:04:50.989> lot<00:04:51.139> now

00:04:51.369 --> 00:04:51.379 
hours in Kannada but so sheds a lot now

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:53.529 
hours in Kannada but so sheds a lot now
but<00:04:51.709> not<00:04:52.009> as<00:04:52.129> much<00:04:52.249> as<00:04:52.369> it<00:04:52.519> was<00:04:52.639> before<00:04:52.819> as<00:04:53.239> it

00:04:53.529 --> 00:04:53.539 
but not as much as it was before as it

00:04:53.539 --> 00:04:56.910 
but not as much as it was before as it
was<00:04:53.889> that<00:04:54.889> six<00:04:55.159> month

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:56.920 
was that six month

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:59.020 
was that six month
it's<00:04:57.920> probably<00:04:58.310> just<00:04:58.520> one<00:04:58.610> of<00:04:58.700> the<00:04:58.850> processes

00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.030 
it's probably just one of the processes

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:02.410 
it's probably just one of the processes
that<00:04:59.390> it<00:04:59.600> goes<00:04:59.780> through<00:04:59.810> um<00:05:00.370> I<00:05:01.370> was<00:05:02.330> just

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:02.420 
that it goes through um I was just

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:04.780 
that it goes through um I was just
trying<00:05:02.720> to<00:05:02.750> see<00:05:02.990> if<00:05:03.260> it<00:05:03.500> seemed<00:05:04.130> as<00:05:04.280> if<00:05:04.310> my<00:05:04.580> hair

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:04.790 
trying to see if it seemed as if my hair

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:11.470 
trying to see if it seemed as if my hair
was<00:05:04.820> thinning<00:05:06.970> doesn't<00:05:07.970> seem<00:05:08.180> like<00:05:08.240> it<00:05:10.300> not<00:05:11.300> to

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:11.480 
was thinning doesn't seem like it not to

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:15.230 
was thinning doesn't seem like it not to
me<00:05:11.630> at<00:05:11.750> least<00:05:12.670> looks<00:05:13.670> fine

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:15.240 
me at least looks fine

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.760 
me at least looks fine
um

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:18.770 

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:28.120 

I<00:05:18.889> know<00:05:19.430> a<00:05:19.460> lot<00:05:19.639> of<00:05:19.699> people<00:05:19.789> talk<00:05:20.780> about<00:05:20.840> having

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:28.130 

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:31.880 

whatever<00:05:29.130> book<00:05:29.960> mine<00:05:30.960> appears<00:05:31.290> to<00:05:31.440> be<00:05:31.560> okay

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:31.890 
whatever book mine appears to be okay

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:35.000 
whatever book mine appears to be okay
and<00:05:32.280> as<00:05:32.910> far<00:05:33.150> as<00:05:33.210> the<00:05:33.450> color<00:05:33.780> right<00:05:34.380> now<00:05:34.560> it<00:05:34.890> is

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:35.010 
and as far as the color right now it is

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:39.440 
and as far as the color right now it is
still<00:05:35.250> black<00:05:35.490> and<00:05:35.520> my<00:05:36.320> tips<00:05:37.550> well<00:05:38.550> I'm<00:05:38.760> tied

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:39.450 
still black and my tips well I'm tied

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:43.280 
still black and my tips well I'm tied
the<00:05:40.080> whole<00:05:40.260> thing<00:05:40.500> black<00:05:40.800> but<00:05:41.220> the<00:05:41.580> tips<00:05:42.290> are

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:43.290 
the whole thing black but the tips are

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:45.860 
the whole thing black but the tips are
still<00:05:43.620> Brown<00:05:43.830> so<00:05:44.190> probably<00:05:45.180> gonna<00:05:45.360> die<00:05:45.660> that

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:45.870 
still Brown so probably gonna die that
