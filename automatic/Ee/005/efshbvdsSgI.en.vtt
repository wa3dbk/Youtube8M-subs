today with memories well alive of tragic
past<00:04:18.970> the<00:04:19.269> government<00:04:19.690> tried<00:04:19.900> to<00:04:19.930> hide<00:04:20.230> we

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.560 

maybe<00:04:35.280> the<00:04:35.400> biggest<00:04:35.550> lesson<00:04:36.060> that<00:04:36.090> you<00:04:36.420> take

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:36.570 
maybe the biggest lesson that you take

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.570 
maybe the biggest lesson that you take
away<00:04:36.690> is<00:04:36.900> that<00:04:36.930> you<00:04:37.140> have<00:04:37.500> to<00:04:37.800> do<00:04:37.950> something

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 
away is that you have to do something

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.990 
away is that you have to do something
you<00:04:38.850> have<00:04:38.880> to<00:04:39.380> work<00:04:40.380> to<00:04:41.370> like<00:04:41.550> make<00:04:41.790> your

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:42.000 
you have to work to like make your

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.080 
you have to work to like make your
always<00:04:42.180> heard<00:04:42.480> people<00:04:43.290> need<00:04:43.440> to<00:04:43.620> talk<00:04:43.920> and<00:04:44.280> to

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
always heard people need to talk and to

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.710 
always heard people need to talk and to
revisit<00:04:45.660> the<00:04:46.110> past<00:04:46.430> because<00:04:47.430> without<00:04:48.030> it<00:04:48.240> we

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:48.720 
revisit the past because without it we

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.960 
revisit the past because without it we
continuously<00:04:49.290> seem<00:04:49.620> to<00:04:49.860> come<00:04:50.520> across<00:04:50.730> the

to a lot of people I'm not going to be
around<00:05:27.000> that<00:05:27.180> much<00:05:27.480> longer<00:05:27.540> I'm<00:05:28.290> gonna<00:05:28.860> be<00:05:29.010> 90

around that much longer I'm gonna be 90

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.290 
around that much longer I'm gonna be 90
this<00:05:29.700> year<00:05:29.760> I<00:05:30.710> really<00:05:31.710> don't<00:05:32.700> have<00:05:32.820> to<00:05:33.030> say<00:05:33.240> too

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.050 
and I think I think eventually that is

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:42.830 
and I think I think eventually that is
the<00:05:40.230> way<00:05:40.440> this<00:05:41.400> story<00:05:41.790> will<00:05:42.150> continue<00:05:42.330> and
