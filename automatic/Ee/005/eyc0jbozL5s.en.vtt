00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:12.110
 Please look 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:16.530
 Pretty much water c things in the house 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:19.880
 It is O in the end it is when you're doing anymore 

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:22.660
 My skin is dry and battered 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.660
 It has become 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:29.730
 Sweet food and this 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.730
 Naturally it is not much 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:32.550
 Because it is not good 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:38.170
 is not it 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:41.870
 Something like a moisturizing cream that you make yourself 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:47.350
 As we moisturize with what you said 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:47.350
 Solo I think it would like a little introduction 

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:55.770
 First Click here 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:59.430
 It is good and is said to be a village 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.700
 It is made of 100% horse oil 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:08.170
 Oh yes 

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:09.280
 Horse oil is very close to human oil and osmotic pressure. 

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.600
 Familiar 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.600
 However, on the other hand 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:26.150
 There is such an impression that the moisturizing effect is not so strong 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:29.770
 For people because it is just natural ingredients and power supplies 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:32.070
 Well that's a side effect or something like that 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:35.970
 So here it is 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:42.290
 This is my home, I issued lactic acid bacteria 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:42.290
 Liquid treated with lactic acid bacteria fermented by rice forage and put in spray mother 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:52.740
 Make something like moisturizing cream with this and this 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:55.659
 Together the two or rather get 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:59.540
 I use it with my feet 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:03.650
 Let's actually do it 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:09.500
 Because only to first short mix 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:11.930
 Tail day cast town fermented liquid of this lactic acid bacteria 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:15.700
 A little taken in hand 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:20.220
 With bra in hand 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.220
 Professional village will also paint if you match 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:26.870
 Like this 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.870
 Things like moisturizing cream 

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.100
 Make your own 

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:35.460
 We try to use 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:39.240
 It is this fermentation liquid of lactic acid bacteria 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:40.940
 Lactic acid bacteria have a high moisturizing effect 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.880
 This oil and 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:46.930
 By mixing 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.930
 Such a moist feeling 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.090
 Because that's the case 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:59.040
 If you don't want to use too much 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:04.130
 I would like to recommend Alto march 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.760
 I am thinking 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:09.530
 How is it 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.530
 It is feeling of dessert to this
