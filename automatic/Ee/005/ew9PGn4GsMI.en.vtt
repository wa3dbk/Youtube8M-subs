00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:18.279 

I<00:00:14.650> see<00:00:15.650> there<00:00:15.889> being<00:00:16.340> two<00:00:16.910> big<00:00:17.630> benefits<00:00:18.140> to

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:18.289 
I see there being two big benefits to

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:21.370 
I see there being two big benefits to
being<00:00:18.410> a<00:00:18.500> small<00:00:18.739> independent<00:00:19.329> developer<00:00:20.380> one

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:21.380 
being a small independent developer one

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.079 
being a small independent developer one
of<00:00:21.499> them<00:00:21.650> is<00:00:21.769> that<00:00:21.890> you<00:00:22.009> get<00:00:22.339> to<00:00:22.579> and<00:00:22.999> their

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:23.089 
of them is that you get to and their

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:25.870 
of them is that you get to and their
related<00:00:23.329> actually<00:00:23.989> right<00:00:24.319> so<00:00:24.890> the<00:00:25.249> first<00:00:25.609> part

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:25.880 
related actually right so the first part

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.609 
related actually right so the first part
of<00:00:25.999> it<00:00:26.119> is<00:00:26.210> that<00:00:26.239> you<00:00:26.449> get<00:00:26.659> to<00:00:26.839> decide<00:00:27.109> exactly

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:27.619 
of it is that you get to decide exactly

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:29.679 
of it is that you get to decide exactly
what<00:00:28.189> you're<00:00:28.339> going<00:00:28.489> to<00:00:28.579> do<00:00:28.729> right<00:00:29.179> if<00:00:29.359> we<00:00:29.509> were

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:29.689 
what you're going to do right if we were

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:32.380 
what you're going to do right if we were
part<00:00:30.560> of<00:00:30.679> a<00:00:30.739> large<00:00:30.949> publisher<00:00:31.939> or<00:00:32.119> publish

so large that we can sort of cast our

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.620 
so large that we can sort of cast our
fishing<00:00:54.829> rod<00:00:55.040> out<00:00:55.370> into<00:00:55.640> an<00:00:55.730> area<00:00:56.060> that<00:00:56.120> nobody

did<00:01:56.359> that<00:01:56.389> I<00:01:56.569> said<00:01:56.929> hey<00:01:57.049> we<00:01:57.170> want<00:01:57.289> a<00:01:57.409> kit<00:01:57.619> right

00:01:57.849 --> 00:01:57.859 
did that I said hey we want a kit right

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:59.709 
did that I said hey we want a kit right
now<00:01:57.889> because<00:01:58.429> like<00:01:58.880> I<00:01:59.090> said<00:01:59.149> it's<00:01:59.389> a<00:01:59.450> much<00:01:59.569> more

00:01:59.709 --> 00:01:59.719 
now because like I said it's a much more

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:01.599 
now because like I said it's a much more
complicated<00:02:00.049> game<00:02:00.469> than<00:02:00.829> our<00:02:00.950> last<00:02:01.130> game<00:02:01.369> so

00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:01.609 
complicated game than our last game so

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:02.949 
complicated game than our last game so
there's<00:02:01.789> a<00:02:01.849> lot<00:02:02.029> to<00:02:02.179> do<00:02:02.329> there's<00:02:02.630> a<00:02:02.689> lot<00:02:02.840> to

00:02:02.949 --> 00:02:02.959 
there's a lot to do there's a lot to

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:04.929 
there's a lot to do there's a lot to
think<00:02:03.109> about<00:02:03.229> but<00:02:04.069> the<00:02:04.159> trick<00:02:04.399> is<00:02:04.429> that<00:02:04.609> there

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:04.939 
think about but the trick is that there

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:07.779 
think about but the trick is that there
is<00:02:05.149> there's<00:02:05.509> magic<00:02:06.049> there<00:02:06.319> in<00:02:07.099> the<00:02:07.369> subject

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:07.789 
is there's magic there in the subject

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:09.730 
is there's magic there in the subject
that<00:02:07.939> we're<00:02:08.060> exploring<00:02:08.330> and<00:02:08.780> because<00:02:09.560> the

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:09.740 
that we're exploring and because the

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.290 
that we're exploring and because the
game<00:02:09.920> was<00:02:10.099> not<00:02:10.220> constrained<00:02:10.790> by<00:02:11.020> financial

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
game was not constrained by financial

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.250 
game was not constrained by financial
fedders<00:02:13.140> we<00:02:13.380> were<00:02:13.500> able<00:02:13.890> to<00:02:14.690> find<00:02:15.690> the<00:02:16.110> magic

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
fedders we were able to find the magic

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.400 
fedders we were able to find the magic
and<00:02:16.650> make<00:02:16.830> it<00:02:16.980> as<00:02:17.130> good<00:02:17.490> as<00:02:17.760> we<00:02:18.140> possibly<00:02:19.140> could

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
and make it as good as we possibly could

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.980 
and make it as good as we possibly could
and<00:02:19.770> the<00:02:20.610> game<00:02:20.790> is<00:02:20.970> a<00:02:21.000> multi-layered<00:02:21.690> thing

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
and the game is a multi-layered thing

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.370 
and the game is a multi-layered thing
and<00:02:22.200> every<00:02:23.160> layer<00:02:23.430> is<00:02:24.170> absolutely<00:02:25.170> the<00:02:25.350> best

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
and every layer is absolutely the best

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:28.310 
and every layer is absolutely the best
that<00:02:25.830> we<00:02:25.950> know<00:02:26.160> how<00:02:26.820> to<00:02:26.880> make<00:02:27.150> so<00:02:27.420> when<00:02:28.050> you<00:02:28.170> go

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
that we know how to make so when you go

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.980 
that we know how to make so when you go
in<00:02:28.500> if<00:02:29.280> you<00:02:29.520> just<00:02:29.940> are<00:02:30.210> interested<00:02:30.690> in<00:02:30.870> a

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
in if you just are interested in a

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.350 
in if you just are interested in a
puzzle<00:02:31.770> game<00:02:31.980> and<00:02:32.310> you're<00:02:32.490> not<00:02:32.670> really

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
puzzle game and you're not really

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.680 
puzzle game and you're not really
looking<00:02:33.810> at<00:02:33.960> story<00:02:34.920> or<00:02:35.570> philosophy<00:02:36.570> or

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
looking at story or philosophy or

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.420 
looking at story or philosophy or
anything<00:02:36.900> like<00:02:37.080> that<00:02:37.140> there<00:02:37.860> is<00:02:37.890> a<00:02:38.040> really

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
anything like that there is a really

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.670 
anything like that there is a really
good<00:02:38.670> puzzle<00:02:38.970> game<00:02:39.120> there<00:02:39.330> but<00:02:40.080> if<00:02:40.500> you<00:02:40.650> want

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
good puzzle game there but if you want

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.380 
good puzzle game there but if you want
to<00:02:40.860> read<00:02:41.010> further<00:02:41.490> than<00:02:41.790> that<00:02:41.940> there's<00:02:42.210> other

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:42.390 
to read further than that there's other

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:44.060 
to read further than that there's other
layers<00:02:42.630> and<00:02:42.870> that's<00:02:43.230> sort<00:02:43.590> of<00:02:43.620> that<00:02:43.800> provision

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
layers and that's sort of that provision

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:48.530 
layers and that's sort of that provision
for<00:02:44.910> deeper<00:02:45.270> engagement<00:02:45.810> that<00:02:46.530> allows<00:02:47.540> for

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
for deeper engagement that allows for

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.420 
for deeper engagement that allows for
that<00:02:48.690> little<00:02:48.900> bit<00:02:49.140> of<00:02:49.170> ambiguity<00:02:50.100> or<00:02:50.130> that

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:50.430 
that little bit of ambiguity or that

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:52.160 
that little bit of ambiguity or that
little<00:02:51.210> bit<00:02:51.360> of<00:02:51.390> like<00:02:51.630> I<00:02:51.780> didn't<00:02:52.020> totally

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
little bit of like I didn't totally

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.600 
little bit of like I didn't totally
understand<00:02:52.710> it<00:02:52.860> but<00:02:52.950> then<00:02:53.100> when<00:02:53.190> you<00:02:53.280> go<00:02:53.400> look

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
understand it but then when you go look

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:54.890 
understand it but then when you go look
at<00:02:53.700> it<00:02:53.790> closely<00:02:54.000> you<00:02:54.180> open<00:02:54.540> it<00:02:54.630> up<00:02:54.720> and<00:02:54.840> you

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
at it closely you open it up and you

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.630 
at it closely you open it up and you
discover<00:02:55.230> there's<00:02:55.440> a<00:02:55.500> cute<00:02:55.890> ton<00:02:56.190> of<00:02:56.220> stuff<00:02:56.520> in
