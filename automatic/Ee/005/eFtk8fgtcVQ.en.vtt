00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 who thinks that facing a steep 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.049
 requires training or technique is wrong 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.740
 but it's simpler than you 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.740
 imagine 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:16.230
 [Music] 

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:18.960
 there's no way 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.210
 time or again on the way we find a 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:25.170
 slope and looks there are people who want it 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:27.660
 be afraid to stop in the middle of her fear 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.519
 I can not get the car to crash. 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.929
 of the car finally losing control 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.739
 stockpile weapons 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:37.410
 the smallest of the shame knows staff behind 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.850
 honking the pressure you can not 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.340
 more upload 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.190
 sometimes what one feels one more 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.989
 car power fact to climb 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.700
 especially when he stops 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.190
 lippi can slip 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:54.030
 fear is the car is too late 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:58.379
 with Chad and we get down and hit it's 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:00.090
 singing the car on the team has a lot 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.960
 experience on losing a little 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.550
 the clutch line did not say 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.229
 fear drive down 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.689
 [Music] 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:12.150
 not will not defend the control of a 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:15.060
 each chat nervousness because that 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:17.960
 it came down not when it got clear, 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.960
 everybody thinks there is always that 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.960
 hair 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.590
 there's no way there's way 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:39.229
 We live in a city and everywhere. 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:42.259
 There are climbs and descents in 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:43.759
 streets roads entrance to buildings and 

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:46.039
 in shopping malls 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:48.200
 What is important to remember is that 

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:49.039
 Vehicle engine that will win this 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.990
 slope 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:54.229
 so it is important to know how to apply this 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:56.630
 force correctly and believe it is not 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:02:04.369
 difficult only requires a little bit of 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:07.729
 training this way you get to 

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:09.619
 release the clutch to accelerate slightly and 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.930
 You will feel the car stirring. 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.540
 When he gives this balance you go. 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:17.560
 accelerate a little more and together 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.560
 release the parking brake 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.510
 now an exit without using the 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.880
 operation 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:28.190
 you will release the clutch holding a 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:31.220
 bit on the brake and accelerating with 

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.440
 side of the foot and then just go out 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.329
 The important thing here is to feel the 

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.329
 car and now the problem of some 

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:40.370
 drivers that is to keep accelerating until the 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:43.250
 times with the hand brake pulled and 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:45.770
 forcing the clutch in that situation and 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:49.830
 if the engine snores 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:51.540
 it's a sign of that clutch getting out 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:55.319
 burning on the road with everyday use 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:57.630
 will generate problems then the vehicle will not 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:03.360
 is a good way to use it when it comes to 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:06.180
 on a slope the world trend is 

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:08.580
 the pedal on the left does not have 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.640
 journey will cease to exist but 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.750
 cases tend to be automatic or 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.360
 is automated management 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:18.239
 electronic clutch that technology 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.489
 certainly beyond the tips of my dear 

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:21.030
 on TV will make life much easier 

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:29.759
