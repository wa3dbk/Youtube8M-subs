have to add as a spare tube okay so
we're<00:00:48.539> going<00:00:48.629> to<00:00:48.719> simulate<00:00:48.809> into<00:00:49.050> something

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
we're going to simulate into something

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.250 
we're going to simulate into something
we<00:00:49.829> have<00:00:50.070> a<00:00:50.100> flat<00:00:50.579> tire<00:00:50.610> here<00:00:50.989> take<00:00:51.989> you<00:00:52.110> to

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
we have a flat tire here take you to

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.920 
we have a flat tire here take you to
tire<00:00:52.500> levers<00:00:53.270> next<00:00:54.270> I<00:00:54.390> actually<00:00:54.570> have<00:00:54.809> one

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
tire levers next I actually have one

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.450 
tire levers next I actually have one
notches<00:00:55.350> in<00:00:55.469> the<00:00:55.559> bottom<00:00:55.860> of<00:00:55.949> them<00:00:56.070> here<00:00:56.280> and

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
notches in the bottom of them here and

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.799 
notches in the bottom of them here and
what<00:00:56.550> those<00:00:56.699> are<00:00:56.910> so<00:00:57.180> you<00:00:57.239> can<00:00:57.420> hook<00:00:57.539> it<00:00:57.629> on<00:00:57.719> the

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
what those are so you can hook it on the

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.319 
what those are so you can hook it on the
scope<00:00:58.129> I'll<00:00:59.129> demonstrate<00:00:59.370> how<00:00:59.730> that<00:00:59.940> is<00:01:00.090> used

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
scope I'll demonstrate how that is used

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.420 
scope I'll demonstrate how that is used
so<00:01:01.079> you<00:01:01.140> always<00:01:01.320> start<00:01:01.620> right<00:01:01.859> at<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.010> valve

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.000 

pull<00:01:05.430> it<00:01:05.519> over

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.010 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.510 

it's<00:01:09.700> a<00:01:09.760> little<00:01:09.970> notch<00:01:10.500> it<00:01:11.500> actually<00:01:11.710> hooks<00:01:12.370> in

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
it's a little notch it actually hooks in

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.140 
it's a little notch it actually hooks in
on<00:01:12.700> hooks<00:01:13.270> into<00:01:13.450> the<00:01:13.600> spoke<00:01:14.190> okay<00:01:15.190> so<00:01:15.910> you<00:01:16.000> take

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:16.150 
on hooks into the spoke okay so you take

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:17.910 
on hooks into the spoke okay so you take
your<00:01:16.300> second<00:01:16.600> tire<00:01:16.720> lever<00:01:16.990> then<00:01:17.680> you<00:01:17.800> move

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:17.920 
your second tire lever then you move

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.740 
your second tire lever then you move
down<00:01:17.950> to<00:01:18.370> where<00:01:18.610> the<00:01:18.700> next<00:01:18.910> Loki<00:01:19.180> is<00:01:19.210> taking<00:01:19.690> it

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
down to where the next Loki is taking it

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:21.810 
down to where the next Loki is taking it
here<00:01:19.870> push<00:01:20.080> it<00:01:20.230> slow<00:01:20.740> down<00:01:20.920> and<00:01:21.460> hook<00:01:21.550> it<00:01:21.700> in

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820 
here push it slow down and hook it in

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.100 
here push it slow down and hook it in
there<00:01:22.000> and<00:01:22.330> take<00:01:22.480> this<00:01:22.600> and<00:01:22.840> just<00:01:22.870> kind<00:01:23.080> of

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
there and take this and just kind of

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:25.020 
there and take this and just kind of
work<00:01:23.230> the<00:01:23.320> way<00:01:23.440> around<00:01:23.560> this<00:01:24.430> this<00:01:24.820> one

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
work the way around this this one

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.610 
work the way around this this one
actually<00:01:25.210> is<00:01:25.540> loose<00:01:25.750> enough<00:01:25.780> the<00:01:26.260> tire<00:01:26.470> is

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:26.620 
actually is loose enough the tire is

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.260 
actually is loose enough the tire is
loose<00:01:26.800> enough<00:01:26.830> on<00:01:27.130> the<00:01:27.220> room<00:01:27.400> that<00:01:28.000> I<00:01:28.090> can

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
loose enough on the room that I can

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.000 
loose enough on the room that I can
actually<00:01:28.420> do<00:01:28.810> what<00:01:29.020> you'll<00:01:29.620> see<00:01:29.800> a<00:01:29.830> lot<00:01:29.980> of

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:02.490 
little bit of air in it so it forms this

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:03.949 
little bit of air in it so it forms this
makes<00:03:02.760> it<00:03:02.880> a<00:03:02.910> lot<00:03:03.030> easier<00:03:03.090> to<00:03:03.420> get<00:03:03.569> it<00:03:03.660> inside

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
makes it a lot easier to get it inside

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:08.990 
makes it a lot easier to get it inside

crease of the rim and that helps keep me

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:29.350 
crease of the rim and that helps keep me
from<00:03:28.010> teaching<00:03:28.280> it<00:03:28.460> whenever<00:03:28.610> I've<00:03:28.910> so<00:03:29.150> what's

from teaching it whenever I've so what's

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:40.720 
from teaching it whenever I've so what's
tire<00:03:37.270> and<00:03:38.270> now<00:03:38.590> I've<00:03:39.590> tubes<00:03:39.830> in<00:03:40.010> it<00:03:40.040> my<00:03:40.460> team<00:03:40.640> is

on the inside of the rim so all of that

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.890 
on the inside of the rim so all of that
on<00:03:42.560> left<00:03:42.980> now<00:03:43.220> to<00:03:43.280> do<00:03:43.640> is<00:03:43.790> to<00:03:43.940> put<00:03:44.120> the<00:03:44.300> the<00:03:44.330> tire
