00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.130 
transplant that on one of these pot it
will<00:02:25.980> grow<00:02:26.280> fast<00:02:26.790> they<00:02:27.150> do<00:02:27.210> for<00:02:27.600> some<00:02:27.780> reason

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
will grow fast they do for some reason

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.310 
will grow fast they do for some reason
like<00:02:28.320> as<00:02:28.560> soon<00:02:28.680> as<00:02:28.860> they<00:02:29.010> touch<00:02:29.250> sand<00:02:30.240> it<00:02:30.990> will

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
like as soon as they touch sand it will

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.620 
like as soon as they touch sand it will
just<00:02:31.590> really<00:02:32.250> grow<00:02:32.430> fast<00:02:32.730> so<00:02:33.120> it's<00:02:33.300> good<00:02:33.480> to

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
just really grow fast so it's good to

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.660 
just really grow fast so it's good to
start<00:02:33.840> them<00:02:34.050> like<00:02:34.200> this<00:02:34.410> and<00:02:35.070> other<00:02:35.280> people

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
start them like this and other people

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.130

right tap water or faucet water on these

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.199 
right tap water or faucet water on these
when<00:03:50.920> I<00:03:50.950> do<00:03:51.040> stuff<00:03:51.340> with<00:03:51.489> the<00:03:51.609> water<00:03:51.790> in<00:03:52.000> like<00:03:52.180> a

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209 
when I do stuff with the water in like a

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:55.410 
when I do stuff with the water in like a
gallon<00:03:52.659> of<00:03:52.810> gallon<00:03:53.680> jugs<00:03:53.980> I<00:03:54.310> put<00:03:54.969> the<00:03:55.060> water<00:03:55.209> in

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:55.420 
gallon of gallon jugs I put the water in

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.830 
gallon of gallon jugs I put the water in
there<00:03:55.629> and<00:03:55.659> I<00:03:55.989> lay<00:03:56.230> it<00:03:56.260> on<00:03:56.469> the<00:03:56.620> Sun<00:03:56.890> and<00:03:57.840> after

00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:58.840 
there and I lay it on the Sun and after

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.410 
there and I lay it on the Sun and after
for<00:03:59.170> 24<00:03:59.560> hours<00:03:59.889> I<00:04:00.099> use<00:04:00.280> that<00:04:00.549> water<00:04:00.790> and<00:04:01.120> I<00:04:01.389> put

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
for 24 hours I use that water and I put

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:02.129 
for 24 hours I use that water and I put
it<00:04:01.659> in<00:04:01.719> here

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:02.139 
it in here

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:05.280 
it in here
I<00:04:02.170> think<00:04:03.010> it's<00:04:03.129> because<00:04:03.400> of<00:04:03.430> the<00:04:03.549> chlorine<00:04:04.290> so

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
I think it's because of the chlorine so

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:08.520 
I think it's because of the chlorine so
you<00:04:05.349> know<00:04:05.709> it's<00:04:06.579> good<00:04:06.870> it<00:04:07.870> will<00:04:07.959> help<00:04:08.230> it<00:04:08.379> grow

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
you know it's good it will help it grow

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:11.069 
you know it's good it will help it grow
fast<00:04:08.829> without<00:04:09.280> the<00:04:09.459> pouring<00:04:10.269> water<00:04:10.480> so<00:04:10.930> the

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:11.079 
fast without the pouring water so the

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:13.259 
fast without the pouring water so the
soil<00:04:11.290> do<00:04:11.439> people<00:04:11.739> put<00:04:11.920> in<00:04:12.069> the<00:04:12.250> fridge<00:04:12.459> they
