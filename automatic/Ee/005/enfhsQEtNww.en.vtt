00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.989
 as we can see that is a model 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:36.540
 from a healthy kiosk that claims to be 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:38.610
 already implemented permanently in 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:40.739

 meet with congressman jaime

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.159
 place on the objective of this contest 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.480
 how is vice minister what is the 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.290
 objective of this contest 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:13.230
 of healthy kiosk this contest has 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.510
 three objectives the first is to promote the 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.890
 Change of habits in teachers 

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.990
 parents and students 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.140
 towards healthy eating and 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.180
 nutritious through projects that 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.220
 improve on one hand the lunch box that 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.070
 they bring the students and on the other side 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.170
 a kiosk that also dispenses the 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.360
 healthy food should 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.070
 contain a healthy kiosk of 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.800
 preference must first have 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.450
 foods of a natural nature and in 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.720
 second, those foods that 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.880
 be industrial they should not contain high 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.790
 salt content or high content of 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.760
 sugar or the trans fats that are 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.570
 totally harmful to health 

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:54.090
 congresswoman ice cream angel how is 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.610
 link forgiveness cobisa jaime thin how 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.680
 this healthy kiosk is linked to 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.450
 bill that has been approved in 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.040
 the beginning of the republic good this 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.680
 is totally coherent not because the 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:07.140
 idea in the bill already approved 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.300
 in the congress is that the centers 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.060
 educational spaces are spaces where 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.470
 privileges nutritional education 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.300
 then it does not make sense that while 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.980
 he's just talking about nutrition and the 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.680
 properties of vitamins and 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.540
 antioxidant flavonoids and what do I know 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.520
 when the children go out to recess 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.920
 they find with pure scrap, not that 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.390
 it makes sense then examples like what 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.400
 that we are seeing from schools that already 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.530
 are working at this time in the 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.050
 country in a feeding option 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:37.830
 healthy goes in consistency with the law 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:39.270
 that establishes first that the sector 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.370
 education has to promote 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:43.410
 nutrition education and secondly 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.590
 to promote physical activity 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:49.170
 then in school kiosks you should 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.330
 spread healthy foods that is 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.580
 what corresponds now if the children 

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.110
 outside on the street or at home they eat it 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.910
 they want because their parents are not 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.160
 let's say to the care of them good will be 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.560
 your choice but in the educational centers 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.820
 nutritional education is privileged and 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.860
 consequently the expense of 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.330
 healthy food vice minister what are 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.670

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.470

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:21.380

 October because what each institution 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:41.810
