00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
Apple do the same thing it appears like

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.550 
Apple do the same thing it appears like
Apple<00:01:38.850> was<00:01:38.939> moving<00:01:39.210> away<00:01:39.360> from<00:01:39.600> Thunderbolt

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
Apple was moving away from Thunderbolt

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.160 
Apple was moving away from Thunderbolt
as<00:01:40.890> a<00:01:40.920> standard<00:01:41.340> in<00:01:41.430> favor<00:01:41.640> of<00:01:41.850> USB<00:01:42.150> C<00:01:42.509> so<00:01:43.140> I

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
as a standard in favor of USB C so I

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.740 
as a standard in favor of USB C so I
would<00:01:43.560> put<00:01:43.710> this<00:01:43.829> in<00:01:44.040> like<00:01:44.310> a<00:01:44.549> remote<00:01:45.180> category

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
would put this in like a remote category

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.139 
would put this in like a remote category
but<00:01:45.990> perhaps<00:01:46.170> lightning<00:01:46.920> also<00:01:47.700> might<00:01:47.880> go<00:01:48.030> away

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
but perhaps lightning also might go away

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.270 
but perhaps lightning also might go away

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280

yes we'll see it on the iPad pro but at
this<00:02:31.950> point<00:02:32.190> it's<00:02:32.730> like<00:02:32.940> saying<00:02:33.180> hey<00:02:33.480> will<00:02:34.200> the

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
this point it's like saying hey will the

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.860 
this point it's like saying hey will the

unicorns far that doesn't exist but yeah
it<00:02:39.150> exists<00:02:39.450> it<00:02:39.510> could<00:02:39.630> be<00:02:39.780> purple<00:02:40.020> so<00:02:40.590> yeah<00:02:41.460> it

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
it exists it could be purple so yeah it

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.180 
it exists it could be purple so yeah it
could<00:02:42.240> have<00:02:42.510> a<00:02:42.570> USB<00:02:42.870> C<00:02:43.140> port<00:02:43.170> it<00:02:43.890> could<00:02:44.010> have<00:02:44.160> a
