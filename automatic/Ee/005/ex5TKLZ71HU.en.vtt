00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.430

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:27.110
 Czech as it was done was done as the 

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:27.110

 the same altitude the same height 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.420
 and this is the place by the degree of 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.980

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.980
 in fact here I made the shots 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.930
 the view 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:05.970

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.360

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.630
 as a child 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:41.010
 I would only continue 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.560

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.180
 at this time 

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.420
 for examples 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.769
 A bird 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.090

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:39.770
 and away from the bad thing 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:51.260
 this is bigger than a car I 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.260
 I think 

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.700

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:04.819
 the mere corner of this side up to 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.819
 imitate life life 

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:13.570
 I say because in this area it's where 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.500
 the lights that I have recorded come out 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:20.320

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:22.770

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:22.770
 balloon 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.610
 and even mark the batÃ¡n pile in the 

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:31.610
 bottle 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.100
 peace 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:44.009

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:48.430

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:52.110
 is going to rosarito putin 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:52.110
 actually mediates all 

00:04:53.139 --> 00:04:56.999
 is already going to the challenges 

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:03.099
 88 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:09.139
 the farms that look 

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:21.050
 Y 

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:26.030

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:32.430
 So that is going to him to 

00:05:30.089 --> 00:05:36.499
 there towards him that's like it's a lot 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:36.499
 how to see ourselves as if it were the sea 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:41.610
 for the sea
