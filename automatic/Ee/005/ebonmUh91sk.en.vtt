00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
this until it's almost granular I think

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.490

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.120 
that's pretty close what what I'm kind
of<00:01:01.590> looking<00:01:01.890> for<00:01:03.140> kind<00:01:04.140> of<00:01:04.259> scrape<00:01:04.800> down<00:01:04.979> the

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:05.130 
of looking for kind of scrape down the

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:07.990 
of looking for kind of scrape down the
sides<00:01:05.400> here<00:01:05.930> yeah<00:01:06.930> that<00:01:07.170> looks<00:01:07.320> pretty<00:01:07.380> good

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
sides here yeah that looks pretty good

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.670 
sides here yeah that looks pretty good
