00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.390
 so hello everyone today I want to share 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:10.019
 one such cunning observation was going to 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:16.250
 temko for one kid well, so about 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:16.250
 already up to 200 its not an interesting thing 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:24.300
 circuitry trite but in principle 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:27.830
 how much is written on it he gives ok 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:31.820
 the essence is not in this itself interesting blocks 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:39.200
 fsp group 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:43.410
 400 watts 1218 1518 amps kinda like 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.969
 let's go watch the interior 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.950
 pretty massive throw that very 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.829
 pleased 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:53.670
 next is the cooler rpm controller 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:58.350
 that, too, will please the throttle much 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:02.190
 more massive than the front doors too 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:06.659
 pleased many times this separate 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:09.630
 power controller instead of tl494 pack 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:13.470
 another type is also produced by fsp 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:17.330
 group and the most interesting thing about this one 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:20.580
 yellow variable he gives us 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:24.360
 the ability to vary the voltage that 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:26.310
 principle is very very convenient to put it bluntly 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:30.420
 my twist we can wind 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:37.070
 voltage 12 volt aule not from 11 somewhere 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:40.619
 to 14 like wills even this is fucking fan 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:44.670
 how would I do everything but hell would not be there 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:48.979
 turned on after two or three hours of reflection 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:52.890
 I came to the point where 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:55.430
 organized separate separate 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.600
 control power on each three lines 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.399
 here is such a tricky thing 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.560
 brown wire connects to 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.820
 orange 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:05.070
 At first I did not notice, but then 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:07.560
 after all it noticed and repainted these 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.920
 two wires inside that is weird 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.540
 payment for feared eventually god turned on 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.240
 which is also pleased but 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.819
 but on the five volt line we had somewhere 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:20.700
 four three volts on the 12 volt line was 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.950
 almost eleven when trying 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.770
 piling up 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:28.650
 Further , the block was turned off when leaving 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:31.260
 protection read forums 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.570
 finally realized what was coming 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:38.550
 control over all three voltage views 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:41.430
 and started thinking a lot thought a lot 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:44.670
 I got to the point that I measured the lines 3 3 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:46.380
 volt which just closes with 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.350
 this black curling pancake brown 

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.900
 the wires ended up with 3 9 volts 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:55.430
 and this is a lot when piling on there 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:58.680
 it turns out 4 block falls protection 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.810
 floated out these two wires but of course 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.660
 quantity snapped under the root soldered in there 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:10.590
 blue and orange for 3 3 volts and drove 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:13.980
 here is usually a diode, I think you understand 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:17.269
 what it is about to the same type only 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:19.519
 smaller with the passage of current through 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:22.769
 passing voltage through a diode 

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:27.360
 tensely it falls somewhere on 12 13 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:32.040
 volt well well actually c9 goes 

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:36.209
 from 3 and 9 volts it fell to 3 volts and blog 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:39.150
 no longer turns off so in new 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:42.750
 blocks, make sure that there is no 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:45.450
 such jambs if they have eliminate them 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:49.310
 either right on the block or loose wires and 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:51.329
 the lock them separately immersed the line 5 volts 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.720
 accordingly still got a raise 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:56.600
 voltage that also pleases 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:04:00.200
 here everything is Feng Shui 1st 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:03.020
 loading five-volt Lenin 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:06.410
 only one for 5 amps turns out quite 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:08.390
 enough wire cut under the root of the nose 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:10.310
 cancer wadded soldering iron can not swim 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.879
 this whole array of solder which is there 

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.879
 is below 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:27.470
 what else that still seems to be so 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:30.200
 stab this whole thing I don't know what 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:33.220
 time company frisk stroy sky group 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:38.270
 began to produce blocks with this 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:41.810
 separate control food of course she 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:47.750
 there is it pleases okay here we turn on the block 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:55.540
 we have 13 7 calves cool everything works where 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:55.540
 screwdriver reach the resistor 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:11.419
 twist his defense folded we can 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:14.060
 adjust voltage expose 

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:17.450
 exactly as much as we need 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:19.130
 joyful thing but also raises 13 

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:24.070
 I think the above is not necessary will not 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:30.530
 overstress the block on 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:38.150
 five volt is not 46 per resistor 

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:43.550
 principle lot everything works in principle they 

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:46.580
 promise 18 to 2 3 6 3 6 amps to such 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:50.180
 I do nâ€™t know about 25 

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:53.060
 stock to come 30 hope from this unit 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:55.639
 a pack of us 20 25 amps should go out 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:57.110
 despite the fact that the voltage is almost not 

00:05:55.639 --> 00:05:58.039
 will sit even if it is 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:03.349
 sit down and we can you 

00:05:58.039 --> 00:06:06.430
 correct well, everything seems to be so 

00:06:03.349 --> 00:06:09.430
 what are you watching so small 

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:09.430
 deckers
