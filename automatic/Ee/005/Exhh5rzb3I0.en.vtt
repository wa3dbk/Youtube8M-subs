we<00:02:17.470> are<00:02:17.500> see<00:02:18.400> you<00:02:18.610> one<00:02:18.790> microphone<00:02:19.330> I'm<00:02:20.140> now

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
we are see you one microphone I'm now

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.450 
we are see you one microphone I'm now
adjusting<00:02:21.970> it<00:02:22.120> to<00:02:23.050> the<00:02:23.260> devil<00:02:23.830> that<00:02:24.130> I<00:02:24.190> need<00:02:24.370> to

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:24.460 
adjusting it to the devil that I need to

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.820 
adjusting it to the devil that I need to
record<00:02:24.820> it<00:02:25.060> change<00:02:25.930> beveled<00:02:26.440> another

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
record it change beveled another

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:27.920 
record it change beveled another
adjusted<00:02:27.250> it<00:02:27.370> already

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
adjusted it already

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.870 
adjusted it already
249<00:02:28.930> same<00:02:29.650> as<00:02:29.860> the<00:02:29.980> last<00:02:30.130> one<00:02:30.310> so<00:02:30.550> it's<00:02:30.670> about

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
249 same as the last one so it's about

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:58.560 
249 same as the last one so it's about
halfway<00:02:54.390> a<00:02:56.250> reasonable<00:02:57.250> level<00:02:57.459> to<00:02:58.060> get<00:02:58.240> a<00:02:58.270> good

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
halfway a reasonable level to get a good

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:01.530 
halfway a reasonable level to get a good
sound<00:02:58.900> and<00:02:59.560> as<00:02:59.770> you<00:02:59.920> can<00:03:00.040> see<00:03:00.220> on<00:03:00.400> the<00:03:00.640> marker

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
sound and as you can see on the marker

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.470 
sound and as you can see on the marker
bus<00:03:01.720> it's<00:03:02.260> not<00:03:02.440> much<00:03:02.620> there<00:03:02.970> okay<00:03:03.970> I'm<00:03:04.150> going

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
bus it's not much there okay I'm going

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:17.280 
bus it's not much there okay I'm going
to<00:03:04.600> now<00:03:05.260> put<00:03:05.770> it<00:03:05.890> up<00:03:06.010> 250<00:03:06.630> from<00:03:07.630> 50%<00:03:08.110> to<00:03:08.440> 100%<00:03:16.290> so

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
to now put it up 250 from 50% to 100% so

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:22.920 
to now put it up 250 from 50% to 100% so
once<00:03:17.980> again<00:03:20.910> now<00:03:21.910> I'm<00:03:22.090> coming<00:03:22.330> in<00:03:22.510> close<00:03:22.720> on

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
once again now I'm coming in close on

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.380 
once again now I'm coming in close on
one<00:03:23.290> hand<00:03:23.530> spend<00:03:23.860> away<00:03:24.130> already<00:03:24.940> you<00:03:25.120> can<00:03:25.239> see

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
one hand spend away already you can see

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.509 
one hand spend away already you can see
a<00:03:25.420> little<00:03:25.600> bit<00:03:25.750> bigger<00:03:25.989> bigger<00:03:26.530> mark<00:03:26.830> on<00:03:27.070> on

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:27.519 
a little bit bigger bigger mark on on

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:30.500 
a little bit bigger bigger mark on on
the<00:03:27.760> track<00:03:28.000> okay<00:03:29.019> now<00:03:29.470> I'm<00:03:29.590> at<00:03:29.709> one<00:03:29.890> fist<00:03:30.250> away

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
the track okay now I'm at one fist away

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.120 
the track okay now I'm at one fist away
at<00:03:31.510> least<00:03:31.840> at<00:03:32.019> this<00:03:32.140> level<00:03:32.200> I<00:03:32.650> should<00:03:32.860> be<00:03:32.980> able

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
at least at this level I should be able

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.630 
at least at this level I should be able
to<00:03:33.280> I<00:03:33.610> can<00:03:34.390> boost<00:03:34.750> it<00:03:34.959> using<00:03:35.290> the<00:03:35.640> software's

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:36.640 
to I can boost it using the software's

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.190 
to I can boost it using the software's
own<00:03:36.910> boost<00:03:37.239> and<00:03:37.510> I<00:03:37.600> can<00:03:37.810> get<00:03:37.930> a<00:03:37.959> reasonable

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
own boost and I can get a reasonable

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.860 
own boost and I can get a reasonable
level<00:03:38.590> out<00:03:38.890> of<00:03:39.040> it<00:03:39.130> but<00:03:39.840> unfortunately<00:03:40.840> I

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
level out of it but unfortunately I

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.780 
level out of it but unfortunately I
still<00:03:41.410> think<00:03:41.739> behringer<00:03:42.220> got<00:03:42.400> some<00:03:42.610> work<00:03:42.760> to

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
still think behringer got some work to

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.729 
still think behringer got some work to
do<00:03:43.090> and<00:03:43.300> I<00:03:43.390> haven't<00:03:43.690> bought<00:03:43.840> out<00:03:43.989> any<00:03:44.200> fix<00:03:44.500> for

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
do and I haven't bought out any fix for

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:47.220 
do and I haven't bought out any fix for
this<00:03:44.890> I<00:03:45.239> had<00:03:46.239> tried<00:03:46.510> on<00:03:46.660> multiple<00:03:47.080> computers

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
this I had tried on multiple computers

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.860 
this I had tried on multiple computers
and<00:03:47.890> I<00:03:47.980> tried<00:03:48.250> it<00:03:48.430> on<00:03:48.580> the<00:03:48.790> iPad<00:03:49.090> and<00:03:49.540> I<00:03:49.600> tried

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
and I tried it on the iPad and I tried

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.350 
and I tried it on the iPad and I tried
on<00:03:50.019> many<00:03:50.260> different<00:03:50.680> I<00:03:50.739> think<00:03:51.100> every<00:03:51.760> computer

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:52.360 
on many different I think every computer

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.210 
on many different I think every computer
I<00:03:52.420> go<00:03:52.600> to<00:03:52.660> I<00:03:52.810> just<00:03:53.200> cannot<00:03:53.470> get<00:03:53.680> the<00:03:53.830> decent

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
I go to I just cannot get the decent

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.820 
I go to I just cannot get the decent
level<00:03:54.519> out<00:03:54.640> of<00:03:54.670> it<00:03:54.850> so<00:03:55.570> sorry<00:03:55.959> behringer<00:03:56.500> but

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:56.830 
level out of it so sorry behringer but

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:58.320 
level out of it so sorry behringer but
you've<00:03:57.160> got<00:03:57.340> some<00:03:57.610> work<00:03:57.790> to<00:03:57.940> do<00:03:58.060> on<00:03:58.209> this

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:58.330 
you've got some work to do on this

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.220 
you've got some work to do on this
particular<00:03:58.690> microphone

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
particular microphone

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:03.740 
particular microphone
and<00:04:01.230> just<00:04:01.469> formally<00:04:01.769> wrapping<00:04:02.159> up<00:04:02.340> I<00:04:02.750> think

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
and just formally wrapping up I think

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.630 
and just formally wrapping up I think
overall<00:04:04.079> over<00:04:04.469> these<00:04:04.650> two<00:04:04.859> ones<00:04:05.129> that's

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
overall over these two ones that's

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.750 
overall over these two ones that's
probably<00:04:06.030> the<00:04:06.180> go<00:04:06.390> this<00:04:07.260> one<00:04:07.590> is<00:04:07.829> just<00:04:08.579> the

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
probably the go this one is just the

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.910 
probably the go this one is just the
levels<00:04:09.090> aren't<00:04:09.269> good<00:04:09.510> enough<00:04:09.560> to<00:04:10.560> record

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:10.920 
levels aren't good enough to record

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:12.740 
levels aren't good enough to record
properly<00:04:11.430> with<00:04:11.609> you<00:04:12.180> have<00:04:12.329> to<00:04:12.359> screw

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
properly with you have to screw

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.199 
properly with you have to screw
everything<00:04:13.019> right<00:04:13.230> up<00:04:13.409> just<00:04:13.859> to<00:04:14.069> hear<00:04:14.280> it<00:04:14.400> that

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
everything right up just to hear it that

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:17.029 
everything right up just to hear it that
one<00:04:15.420> it's<00:04:15.780> good<00:04:16.079> straight<00:04:16.440> out<00:04:16.620> of<00:04:16.709> the<00:04:16.799> box

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:17.039 
one it's good straight out of the box

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:18.640 
one it's good straight out of the box
and<00:04:17.160> that's<00:04:17.310> where<00:04:17.489> you<00:04:17.579> want<00:04:17.759> it

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 
and that's where you want it

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:21.650 
and that's where you want it
unfortunately<00:04:19.650> once<00:04:19.949> again<00:04:20.220> this<00:04:20.759> microphone

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
unfortunately once again this microphone

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:25.490 
unfortunately once again this microphone
out<00:04:21.900> point<00:04:22.320> is<00:04:22.770> not<00:04:23.039> that<00:04:23.220> great<00:04:23.960> you<00:04:24.960> can<00:04:25.110> just

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500 
out point is not that great you can just

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.740 
out point is not that great you can just
hear<00:04:25.740> yourself<00:04:25.860> place<00:04:26.850> back<00:04:27.180> flying<00:04:27.479> through

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:27.750 
hear yourself place back flying through

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.659 
hear yourself place back flying through
there<00:04:27.960> whereas<00:04:28.289> as<00:04:28.770> I<00:04:28.979> demonstrated<00:04:29.490> earlier

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:29.669 
there whereas as I demonstrated earlier

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:32.330 
there whereas as I demonstrated earlier
but<00:04:30.139> unfortunately<00:04:31.139> it's<00:04:31.500> not<00:04:31.680> that<00:04:31.889> good

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
but unfortunately it's not that good
