people's<00:02:39.620> hands<00:02:40.370> in<00:02:40.519> a<00:02:40.610> video<00:02:40.910> with<00:02:41.630> such<00:02:41.840> an

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:42.019 
people's hands in a video with such an

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:45.370 
people's hands in a video with such an
innocuous<00:02:42.620> title<00:02:43.220> but<00:02:43.690> I'm<00:02:44.690> sure<00:02:45.140> that's

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
innocuous title but I'm sure that's

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:49.660 
innocuous title but I'm sure that's
probably<00:02:45.680> the<00:02:45.830> point<00:02:47.830> yra<00:02:48.830> is<00:02:48.890> my<00:02:49.250> favorite

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:54.080 
bonbon so this was maybe a little odd

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.590

for<00:02:54.110> me<00:02:54.530> to<00:02:54.650> see<00:02:54.830> but<00:02:55.190> it<00:02:56.000> was<00:02:56.120> harmless<00:02:56.420> when

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
for me to see but it was harmless when

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:57.460 
for me to see but it was harmless when
if<00:02:56.750> I<00:02:56.840> suppose

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
if I suppose

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.830

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.030 
despite the murder in the people eating
they<00:03:00.790> actually<00:03:01.790> almost<00:03:02.000> seemed<00:03:02.890> somehow<00:03:03.890> in

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
they actually almost seemed somehow in

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.460 
they actually almost seemed somehow in
character<00:03:04.489> without<00:03:04.850> I<00:03:05.090> picture<00:03:05.570> them<00:03:05.810> which

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
character without I picture them which
