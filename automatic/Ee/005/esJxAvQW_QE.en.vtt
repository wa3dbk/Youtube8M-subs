00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:34.500
 from where we brew the wind that turns 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.060
 this afternoon on the orange can will have to all 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.350
 and to all in a sunny weather cleared ' 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:39.150
 it's hot outside temperature 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.940
 is raised to 26 degrees the temperature 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:43.620
 of water and she has a small 18 degrees 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.720
 we are on a tide that is 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.829
 currently going back up the 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.020
 platoon is at 15 o'clock at 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.640
 coefficients of 54 on those going back up the 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.079
 wind and passionate shower north west at a 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.239
 strong word the lake laughs at him 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.680
 make waves are smooth there are 7 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.600
 or the elongated one nails that is 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.920
 long with 12 second periods oriented 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.170
 west to northwest northwest that come in 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.640
 multi stung on the rise there are m on the 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.860
 series failing a beautiful hand back between 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.900
 the Syriacs 50 to 80 cm 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.180
 or that's the long series are 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.500
 long to come that books of the waves 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.420
 and that break almost more off 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.700
 this is almost at the edge with waves 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.200
 who are ready fermenting kick phase of 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.240
 the acquired her high school paul who are hollow 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.320
 a few months ago caught on the 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.729
 best sand bands but 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.890
 necessarily because he does not have much of 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.780
 good in everyone is the same 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.850
 place so it's not easy and it's 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.260
 even a little dangerous evolution for 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.909
 the rest of the day to drink cash 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.560
 we are really slight rise to 1 meter 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.420
 50 and 7 seconds it can be a 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.549
 gigantic swell thrust that we're going 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.409
 to have today we wait at 13h in 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.930
 fifteen heads that will already have a little bit 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.180
 more on a west and west northwest 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.000
 11 to 12 seconds of periods a year north 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.979
 west to beaufort and 17 hours on 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.680
 will have a meter eighty hardly 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.330
 more for my error on my part on 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.950
 a west to west northwest northwest in 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.360
 second period but with a breeze 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.300
 thermal is expected north northwest 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.330
 in the 3 to 4 beaufort 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:02.030
 it remains degraded better niche on 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:05.480
 the end of the world the very beginning of the descendant 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.110
 I keep you informed on 08 92 29 78 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:09.350
