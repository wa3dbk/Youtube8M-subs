like this after getting some of this and

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.039 
like this after getting some of this and
I<00:01:41.340> think<00:01:41.579> we<00:01:41.700> just<00:01:41.729> got<00:01:42.240> some<00:01:42.540> of<00:01:42.720> this<00:01:42.869> over

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
I think we just got some of this over

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.200 
I think we just got some of this over
this<00:01:43.290> last<00:01:43.560> two<00:01:43.770> days<00:01:43.979> so<00:01:44.280> a<00:01:44.640> little<00:01:44.850> bit<00:01:45.030> more

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
this last two days so a little bit more

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.200

downside first the brief tip will take

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.350 
downside first the brief tip will take
