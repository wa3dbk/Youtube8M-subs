 the 610 the procedure is very easy to 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.470
 do and it's also applicable to other 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.080
 versions of mobile phones and 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.029

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.309
 phone to the micro sd that we have 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.380
 installed on the phone soon what 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.030
 we want to do either to create a 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.370
 backup of our numbers contacts 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.670
 telephone or because we are going to sell 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.370
 our phone and we want to get it out 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.050
 our contact is in the micro sd and 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.030
 we just go here where it says 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.489
 contacts is our notebook 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.870
 standard directions our free 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:52.609

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.429
 click here below on the three dashes 

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:56.960
 horizontal below the right 

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:58.430
 we look for the option that says import and 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.940
 export and here we are worth many 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.800
 options 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.110
 and we should simply keep in mind 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.200
 that we can have right now 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.920
 our contacts 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:12.590
 on the sim card and on the phone we can 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:15.020
 have it in the internal storage that 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.640
 we have already made a backup or 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.920
 also have those configured in 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:22.429
 our email then 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.170
 let's tell him to move us all 

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:26.450
 the contacts we have on the phone 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.659
 then we arrived here next and 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.720
 when I save it on the sd card and 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:33.700
 then the next we say 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.680
 and then here gives me the option to 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.780
 select the ones I want to move or 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.090
 make a backup and save them in the micro 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:43.920
 sd and here I give up to select 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:46.409
 I have all given to accept 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.320
