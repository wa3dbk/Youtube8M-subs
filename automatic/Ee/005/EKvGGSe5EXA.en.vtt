00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:17.180 

nutrient<00:01:14.799> agar<00:01:14.950> starts<00:01:15.550> out<00:01:15.700> as<00:01:15.820> a<00:01:15.850> solid<00:01:16.270> mass

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:17.190 
nutrient agar starts out as a solid mass

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:19.560 
nutrient agar starts out as a solid mass
bottle<00:01:18.190> so<00:01:18.790> we're<00:01:18.970> going<00:01:19.060> to<00:01:19.119> have<00:01:19.210> to<00:01:19.330> do<00:01:19.450> in

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:19.570 
bottle so we're going to have to do in

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.889 
bottle so we're going to have to do in
order<00:01:19.780> to<00:01:19.810> pour<00:01:20.110> it<00:01:20.200> out<00:01:21.000> in<00:01:22.000> a<00:01:22.090> liquid<00:01:22.360> state<00:01:22.479> I

00:01:22.889 --> 00:01:22.899 
order to pour it out in a liquid state I

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:26.609 
order to pour it out in a liquid state I
do<00:01:23.619> is<00:01:23.979> boil<00:01:24.369> water<00:01:24.729> I<00:01:25.210> place<00:01:25.990> the<00:01:26.140> nutrient

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:26.619 
do is boil water I place the nutrient

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:28.499 
do is boil water I place the nutrient
agar<00:01:26.680> in<00:01:27.009> there<00:01:27.220> we<00:01:27.490> have<00:01:27.610> to<00:01:27.640> crack<00:01:27.909> it<00:01:28.090> first

00:01:28.499 --> 00:01:28.509 
agar in there we have to crack it first

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:30.780 
agar in there we have to crack it first
and<00:01:29.259> this<00:01:29.560> will<00:01:29.710> bring<00:01:29.830> it<00:01:30.009> to<00:01:30.190> liquid<00:01:30.549> state

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:30.790 
and this will bring it to liquid state

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.820 
and this will bring it to liquid state
so<00:01:31.570> that<00:01:31.600> we<00:01:31.780> can<00:01:31.929> pour<00:01:32.170> it<00:01:32.289> we<00:01:32.470> have<00:01:32.560> to<00:01:32.679> get

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:32.830 
so that we can pour it we have to get

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:37.770 
so that we can pour it we have to get
rid<00:01:32.979> of<00:01:33.009> the<00:01:33.130> solid<00:01:33.520> mass<00:01:33.700> in<00:01:34.030> the<00:01:34.090> middle<00:01:36.780> six

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:37.780 
rid of the solid mass in the middle six

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.889 
rid of the solid mass in the middle six
and<00:01:38.110> a<00:01:38.259> half<00:01:38.289> hours<00:01:39.100> later<00:01:39.750> how's<00:01:40.750> the<00:01:41.259> fee

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
and a half hours later how's the fee

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.910 
and a half hours later how's the fee
Haggar<00:01:43.899> is<00:01:44.020> all<00:01:44.440> liquid<00:01:44.950> we<00:01:45.250> can<00:01:45.429> remove<00:01:46.920> from

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:47.920 
Haggar is all liquid we can remove from

00:01:47.920 --> 00:02:03.630 
Haggar is all liquid we can remove from
the<00:01:48.100> Bunsen<00:01:48.460> burner<00:01:54.119> there's<00:01:55.119> no

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640

do is hook up your Bunsen burner to the
gas<00:02:08.560> and<00:02:09.179> turn<00:02:10.179> on<00:02:10.360> the<00:02:10.509> gas<00:02:11.760> you<00:02:12.760> can<00:02:12.970> go<00:02:13.120> ahead

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
gas and turn on the gas you can go ahead

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:19.920 
gas and turn on the gas you can go ahead
and<00:02:13.540> light<00:02:13.720> it<00:02:14.010> and<00:02:15.010> there<00:02:15.190> you<00:02:18.600> downtown<00:02:19.600> the

and light it and there you downtown the

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.760 
and light it and there you downtown the
busines<00:02:20.200> so<00:02:20.980> that<00:02:21.130> we<00:02:21.190> can<00:02:21.370> sterilize<00:02:21.640> those<00:02:22.150> a

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
busines so that we can sterilize those a

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.150 
busines so that we can sterilize those a
little<00:02:23.770> bit

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
little bit

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.520 
little bit
butter<00:02:26.700> from<00:02:27.700> the<00:02:27.760> lid<00:02:28.120> it<00:02:28.840> would<00:02:29.050> part<00:02:29.260> from

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
butter from the lid it would part from

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.770 
butter from the lid it would part from
when<00:02:30.100> they<00:02:30.190> deposit<00:02:30.640> as<00:02:31.150> I<00:02:31.180> throw<00:02:31.480> the<00:02:31.570> phone

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
when they deposit as I throw the phone

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.600 
when they deposit as I throw the phone
every<00:02:32.020> time<00:02:32.200> so<00:02:32.890> we<00:02:32.980> can<00:02:33.100> kill<00:02:33.250> all<00:02:33.490> the

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
every time so we can kill all the

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:42.950 
every time so we can kill all the
bacteria

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:42.960 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:03:11.940 

I'm<00:02:43.960> going<00:02:44.470> to<00:02:44.680> the<00:02:44.770> picture<00:02:45.100> dish<00:03:10.890> now<00:03:11.890> we

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:11.950 
I'm going to the picture dish now we

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:13.980 
I'm going to the picture dish now we
have<00:03:12.160> to<00:03:12.310> offset<00:03:12.700> the<00:03:12.850> lids<00:03:13.060> that<00:03:13.210> way<00:03:13.480> the

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:13.990 
have to offset the lids that way the

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:17.310 
have to offset the lids that way the
knife<00:03:14.830> nutrient<00:03:15.370> agar<00:03:15.460> can<00:03:16.210> dry<00:03:16.540> and<00:03:16.840> go<00:03:17.110> back

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
knife nutrient agar can dry and go back

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:22.290 
knife nutrient agar can dry and go back
into<00:03:17.500> a<00:03:17.620> hardened<00:03:18.010> state<00:03:20.640> once<00:03:21.640> they<00:03:21.820> are<00:03:21.970> in

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:22.300 
into a hardened state once they are in

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:23.040 
into a hardened state once they are in
your<00:03:22.540> horns

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:23.050 
your horns

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:53.600 
your horns
you<00:03:23.680> can<00:03:23.920> now<00:03:24.070> grow<00:03:24.310> your<00:03:24.490> bacteria

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:04:04.050 

no<00:03:54.610> I<00:03:54.640> did<00:03:59.280> so<00:04:00.280> as<00:04:00.610> you<00:04:00.880> can<00:04:01.000> see<00:04:01.950> dad<00:04:02.950> not<00:04:03.520> this
