 nice good evening and warm 

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:04.259
 Welcome to the press conference after the 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 play the eagle mannheim against the 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:06.750
 polar bears berlin 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.460
 I welcome both trainers to mine 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.349

 Coach of the Tons Congratulations on the victory 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.710
 Your comment to the game, please, yes, good 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.160
 evening together but the game today i 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.650
 found both teams are very tough 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.970
 fought 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.070
 I was not happy as we were in the 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.099
 charts without so many point losses 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.030
 and these two against one 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.600
 have submitted 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.399
 but still we would like to be natural 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.120
 the three points taken but the the 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.890
 two are very important to us at the moment 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.920
 our team has a lot today 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.480
 very fought for these two points feet 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.770
 I was very happy as we blocked 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.730
 have blocked shots 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:55.860
 and yes at the end and we also have two 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.660
 Striker lost today I do not know 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.410
 how bad is but was to the end 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:04.409
 the bank a bit small but 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.060
 anyway I am very happy and 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.510
 proud of the guys we fought 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.330
 to have 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.020
 thank you very much thanks mister tomlinson 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:15.360
 mr zach would you comment the game 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:18.240
 yes it was an absolute top game 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.400
 very well managed by our side 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.560
 the hangover in the second third where 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.240
 we too much the slice in ours 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.130
 wanted to keep rows 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.080
 in the last third we have easy and 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.810
 have played straight again then 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.490
 many chances played out when one 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.909
 luck has enough to win 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.350
 can 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:39.979
 but it happened so that you have one 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:42.390
 have brought more point 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:44.220
 Of course bitter was also the 5 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.640
 plus playing time of marcus kink the or 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.079
 I should not miss then the coach 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.630
 still extended in the last third of the 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:54.270
 of course was with five defenders and 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.100
 then it was difficult to rest on storms 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.710
 to keep the pace but the team 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.469
 did that very well with all 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.170
 by virtue of the compensation 

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:05.729
 and yes well in overtime hammer 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.049
 got unhappy gate and brought 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:08.369
 the victory for berlin 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:11.129

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:29.190
 jump under the top four then finds 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.170
