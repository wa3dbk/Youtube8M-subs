00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:12.100
 hello and welcome to the hot league of the 

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:14.370
 acoustics player edition 4 2013 

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.920
 This time I have you one 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.140
 einsplus intro brought in the style of a 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:22.160
 certain mister eric clapton and that 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.160
 is played like this 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.790
 not easy at all but it leads 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.330
 anyway, over the entire neck of us 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.030
 guitar 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:45.590
 The whole thing is suitable for a blues 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.220
 in a 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:53.370
 it starts here with the amc and the h 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:56.040
 page as a prelude to the last trio 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:01:00.780
 in eighth before the 1 play the fis so 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:05.030
 so then we see in an eighth 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.030
 trio line with the tones 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:11.420
 only then does it continue over 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.469
 the 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:21.899
 we pull the next trio in eighth 

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:29.579
 the hair in the 12h side towards cis yes 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:31.320
 So the hair pulled to the ccs somewhere 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.289
 in between, it should sound bluesy 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.369
 next group of three group the hair 

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:37.369
 played normally 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:47.610
 now comes a little thriller mid hh 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:50.100
 So beat that makes then very quickly 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.030
 a helmet ring for a hair and again 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:56.470
 pool on back 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:02:00.460
 that was to sound slow motion is like that 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.460
 then get fit again and a 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:06.950
 that was already the single note part 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:10.390
 this blues introns by eric clapton 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.390
 play again very slowly 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.180
 1234 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:29.530
 Ok, now it's on the next one 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:31.209
 1 comes back as a tune but do 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.640
 we now play for the first time 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:36.719
 bastone with his thumb 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.719
 the teaching a page 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:43.500
 So just be in the sacrifice with the 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:46.260
 thumb and with index or middle finger 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.640
 wear and the a side 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.310
 Now comes a two-part passage 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.140
 further down the neck we park here 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.910
 fourth finger 

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:58.090
 Also on this time resorted to 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:01.990
 fifth lives the e side and play 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:05.490
 down a line on the b-side 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:05.490
 the gm fifth bunch 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.659
 the next 12 floors 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:21.280
 ok this day again slowly first 

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.280
 that an octave up here 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:38.090
 ok if he gave us the last beat sg to 7 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:40.030
 empty e string on a ring of georg 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.340
 is 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:45.040
 By the way, I would use the whole e7 here 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.930
 grab hold of it so you prevent that 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.690
 accidentally wrong sounds come when 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.190
 you 're on the wrong side stop 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:54.220
 you definitely harmonious in the 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:57.750
 right harmony in there so larry 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:57.750
 semmering of gc 

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:02.990
 the side 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:04.470
 this thieme de 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:05.910
 Luise 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.480
 The last two can be quiet 

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:10.720
 sound together then come again 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.580
 deep 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.740
 and we are on the one of the 

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:18.519
 follow and blues form there now 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:21.430
 Just record this record 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:25.810
 You can also live this night or directly 

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:28.810
 in what accompaniment go about a7 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:30.940
 just as the tuner continues after that 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:33.970
 because our review this time is only 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:36.700
 the intro ok play it all now 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:37.930
 count down again very slowly 

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:39.910
 in detail 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:42.160
 if you've already checked that and with 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.300
 the notes in the game way clearly comes 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:50.790
 can you already try directly 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:50.790
 to play along 1234 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.370
 u 

00:05:06.529 --> 00:05:10.679
 ok, I hope that worked for you 

00:05:09.119 --> 00:05:17.299
 We will do something for you 

00:05:10.679 --> 00:05:17.299
 faster than 34 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:36.710
 so I hope everything is clear 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:38.480
 our ottlik I'll show you for 

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:40.340
 the plectrum players like me the whole 

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:42.200
 would play with black 

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:43.910
 the single not line is not there 

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:46.670
 problem is quite normal plectrum 

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:48.920
 technology later when it becomes two-parted 

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:53.660
 I would then go on hybrid beijing 

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:55.580
 So black plus medium or ring finger 

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:58.090
 use you look at the game first 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:58.090
 very slowly 

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:23.260
 ok decide transition happens shortly 

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:27.090
 before one if which there plays the 

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:27.090
 Guitar pick line play the thriller 

00:06:28.729 --> 00:06:33.949
 then we have the hand position in the 

00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:36.439
 stop hand change around seamlessly 

00:06:33.949 --> 00:06:37.610
 the hybrid beijing to go ok now with 

00:06:36.439 --> 00:06:41.680
 black again something 

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:41.680
 faster tempo try to play along 

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:45.610
 1234
