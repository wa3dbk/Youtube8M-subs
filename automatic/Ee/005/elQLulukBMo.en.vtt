00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.960
 channel or today third of the human 

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.790
 mappack what food has appeared and 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.550
 Today human one easter egg namely 

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:23.949
 if you sport here and this little one 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.330
 get out of here right As world their very 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:27.970
 fast to an easter egg on the 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:30.699
 guided map and although it has since 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:33.340
 nothing less than the nice 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:35.790
 ships from the hectare around the map 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:39.989
 of hectic and once in detail 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:46.330
 a very clear criticism also this bow 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:49.799
 This is the swimming foot of a left 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:52.239
 here the spur is the bomb 

00:00:49.799 --> 00:00:56.220
 Defense is disturbing here 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:58.239
 stop the spawn if you put the bomb 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.799
 would have to realize that this is also about 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:03.339
 this is under thought these have 

00:00:59.799 --> 00:01:06.149
 whole little windows are and here 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:09.939
 is this way out of this glass 

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:12.520
 can one already recognize that the sec and 

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:15.579
 You see, I am normal 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:18.640
 buy the card and the other way around 

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:20.079
 by jan vondracek you can see them too 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.500
 Island I 'll take it now 

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:26.590
 show if you have time then you have to 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.060
 just look to the right the island in the 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.009
 Sinn does not speak exactly yet 

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.590
 the proviant on it but were again 

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:33.969
 but only preaches my easac so 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.479
 a hint and that's just that 

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:38.590
 island and wide the only island so 

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:43.409
 on the other side there are none 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:46.600
 if you are now in the relegation to the 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.789
 island view should be as you stop 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.920
 the boat of the island would have to look like 

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:51.819
 the island about since about 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.189
 located 

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:57.700
 So where this bun is because you 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:59.770
 yes on this special looks old 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:03.840
 the map has been made 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:07.960
 600 fine yes that's one of them 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.899
 and if you know sex from computerclub2 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.569
 write me the comments again 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:14.670
 me was just like that and friend 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:16.680
 you have that complaint then you can 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.970
 go back up with a thumb and with 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.689
 i say goodbye to these words i 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.540
 I'll go out and I'll fight 

00:02:21.689 --> 00:02:27.810
 Besides, shoot just for the reason 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:30.239
 and in the name and secondly and 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:33.680
 at some point by my tip just 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:33.680
 through an intermediate sequence
