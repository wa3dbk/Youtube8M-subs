00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.569
 or face lift 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:09.090
 face lift or rhytidectomy is a 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.050
 surgery is effective in rejuvenating 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.019
 face 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:16.020
 the technique I propose repositioning the 

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:19.650
 facial volumes and flaccid withdrawal 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.840
 reducing wrinkles and furrows is 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.960
 suitable for elderly people 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:28.410
 and great facial aging 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:31.619
 genetics fire the sun exposure 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.390
 and poor diet are some of the 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:34.739
 factors that accelerate the 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.680
 aging 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:40.860
 with age the skin loses part of its 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:45.030
 collagen and elastic fibers becoming 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:48.300
 flaccid wrinkles without shine and softness 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.940
 the deep tissues also suffer from 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.760
 aging and factors such as the action of 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.969
 cause the fat to fall 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.760
 and changes the face shape in the 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:03.180
 youth the region there is bulky 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:06.150
 illuminated the lower eye region is 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:09.869
 well filled and the mandibular contour 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:12.750
 thus defined the face has a format 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.420
 triangle with apex down 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.509
 already in the aged face it is possible to notice 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.540
 a drop in the facial tissues 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:24.330
 displacement of culture malar the region 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:27.240
 lower of the eyes loses in volume 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:30.500
 a known nasolabial juice is formed 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:34.200
 like Chinese mustache the jaw region 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:38.280
 loses its definition and the neck becomes 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.710
 flaccid pre-surgical recommendations 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.229

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.340

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:53.189

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:59.219
 physical evaluation and are 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:02.040
 ordered laboratory tests some 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.689
 recommendations should be followed before 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.030
 of surgery 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:08.670
 tell your doctor the medicines you 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.860
 you use normally because some should 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.810
 be suspended as in the case of 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.390
 anticoagulants 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.550
 the days leading up to the surgery is 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.760
 it is advisable to stop the consumption of 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:23.640
 alcoholic beverages and the fun 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.280

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.530

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.540
 eight hours before absolute fast of 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.540
 solid and liquid food 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:36.209
 the time of the hospitalization surgery and the 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.680
 type of anesthesia will be informed by the 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.989

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:45.000
 work takes place in a few days 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.989
 other specific recommendations 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.450
 concerning curative care 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:54.269
 solar exposure healing and practices 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.819

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:58.739

00:02:56.819 --> 00:03:01.049
 Patience and care are 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:03.690
 post operative 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:06.660
 over a few months you can see 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:09.000
 a more natural and definitive result 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:11.910
 complications are rare due to 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.549
 preparation performed in the preoperative period 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.599
 care offered during and after the 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:17.760
 surgery 

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:20.640
 plastic surgery is one of the 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:23.880
 to gain more self-confidence and 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:26.640

 about your expectations with your doctor and 

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.739
 I see that it can really be done in your 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:35.160
 if then perfection does not exist 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:37.549
 but the results are worth it together 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:40.380
 may discuss surgical techniques 

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:43.290
 existence and those best suited for the 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:45.720
 your case because you must always respect 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.609
 the anatomy of each person 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.840
 there is no plastic surgery without 

00:03:47.609 --> 00:03:50.430
 scars 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.160
 each person has a process of 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:55.769
 different healing that does not depend 

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:58.769
 of the doctor but of the organism 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:01.980
 you should seek the best result 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:04.680
 within their reality without expectation 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:09.989
 to look like someone famous or 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:13.049
 that you admire surgical technique 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:16.500
 is made up of layer of fat skin 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:17.880
 and muscles that extend above the 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:21.000
 facial bones 

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:24.870
 Let's see now how the 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:27.330
 The facelift surgery begins with 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:30.090
 the detachment of facial skin and 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:33.330
 The neck is then 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:36.570
 repositioning of deep tissues and 

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:39.780
 the excess of skin removed in some 

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:42.300
 cases, it may be necessary to associate 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:45.450
 liposuction for removal of the 

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:48.360
 excess fat located in the neck 

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:50.669
 the use of a drain may be necessary to 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:53.070
 the removal of fluids that form 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:55.260
 below the skin, facilitating the 

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:57.150
 healing and promoting 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:00.210
 faster recovery 

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:01.530
 its removal is done on the following days 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:04.590
 procedure 

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:07.470
 the size of the scars varies according to 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:10.169
 with the degree of skin flaccidity so 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:13.169
 general is discreet and hidden inside 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:16.110
 of the hair and around the ears 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:18.270
 the scars mature and stay 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:20.880
 less visible over time 

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:22.289
 It may take a few months for the 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:25.500
 final result 

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:28.560
 the face lift does not prevent the process 

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:31.469
 aging but decreases sagging 

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:34.050
 of the skin of the face and neck 

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:34.940
 maintaining a youthful appearance for many 

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:38.250
 years 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:40.680
 post-surgical recommendations is 

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:43.740
 advisable rest with bedside 

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:46.130
 and use of cold packs for 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:49.169
 decrease the initial swelling 

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:51.930
 follow your doctor's advice regarding 

00:05:49.169 --> 00:05:54.349
