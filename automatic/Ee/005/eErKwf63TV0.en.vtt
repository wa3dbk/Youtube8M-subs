00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.800
 good youtube in the next video les 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.290
 I will teach how to disappear this 

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:09.650
 message 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:12.440
 the solution is simple we are going here to 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:15.170
 the updates we enter the panel 

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.480
 control then programs programs and 

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.750
 features and updates 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.640
 installed 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.230
 I do not do it anymore because it is very difficult 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.170
 find it but it's between 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.410
 updates for microsoft windows 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:30.750
 it is here 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:32.690
 after we have it we have to go here 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.670
 and we are already in installed applications 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:38.300
 and here we select them and we give them 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.300
 uninstall 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:44.719
 tells us that we are sure to accelerate 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.719
 this update that we give you yes 

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.380
 come back when I finish 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.590
 almost 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.590
 it's over 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.970
 good you have to visit the logic 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:11.230
 perform the computer but before 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:11.230
 that we are going to that again 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:18.390
 registry 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.390
 and here we are going to look for it 

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.329
 this does not seem 

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:43.070
 once the update is installed 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:46.930
 we have to restart the pc 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.930
 I 'm going to restart it and go back 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.470
 good once they have restarted the 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.320
 computer and have scanned again 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.370
 the updates will come out here 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.130
 but not even that install it being 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:04.670
 we just give it here to 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.670
 hide it 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:11.320
 we respond 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:14.520
 and nothing else will appear again 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:17.770
 important we should change the 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:20.650
 configurations and here instead of giving 

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:23.340
 so we automatically give it to us 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:25.500
 ask us here 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.160
 let me choose if I want 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:31.000
 install them or not 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:34.650
 then we give ok and now 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:38.430
 here in that too to see which 

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:38.430
 updates are hidden 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.849
 I have enough 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:48.340
 but the most important either hidden 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:54.660
 wait for nothing the problem 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:56.780
 well, that was all they said delen like and 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:00.069
 subscribe 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.069
