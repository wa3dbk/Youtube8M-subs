00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:19.010
 beautiful girl only aid and today I come back with 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:22.070
 a new video a new card game 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:23.689
 but before I start I would like to thank you 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.330
 really all the frank because 

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:28.820
 until recently, the other day 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:31.250
 we got 500 members little 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.720
 absurd in such a short time and not me 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.780
 I expected it for nothing even because in i 

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:38.570
 comments if all very kind in the facts 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.769
 some very good comments I want 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.809
 thank you all from the first to the last 

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:43.160
 who supports me who subscribes to the channel 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:47.360
 to share like you I like a 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:49.280
 all and nothing and the continuous channel 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.710
 go ahead and hope you grow again 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.930
 more with time but now we move to 1 st 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.710
 of this little magic game with the 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.540
 cards 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.610
 then it is a pretty famous game in 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.440
 internet there are not many versions but 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.600
 I want to propose a version a little 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:05.330
 several a bit personal 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:08.479
 the only thing is that I'm alone here 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.860
 I study therefore I have no one who 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:11.270
 can choose a card at random then 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.549
 I will try to do everything the most 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.650
 so random will I go too 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:17.689
 first of all we have a bunch of 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.649
 cards and diamonds hearts spikes flowers all 

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:23.049
 different from each other 

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:25.520
 ok but normal standard I will go to 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:28.460
 mix them as much as possible I wish that 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:32.119
 you were sure that I don't hold any 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:35.630
 sign in the deck so I'll go mix 

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:37.460
 totally will be and once you have finished 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.990
 to mix I will stay here 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.939
 team was a bit so you can't 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:44.270
 I 'm going to do it completely 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:48.189
 randomly this way still raises it 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:51.499
 still at random he raises it one last time 

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:53.840
 ok so you can't know 

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:55.399
 no card where in the deck either 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.259
 the last because it could not have seen it 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:00.530
 so what am I going to do 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:03.530
 I will go by myself more or less to say stop in 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:07.100
 any point type stop type in 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:09.080
 this point here ok now I stopped 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.880
 at random on this card as showing 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:16.190
 sail I could see the monster sail 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:17.910
 turning around I hope you see ok and I put it back 

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.820
 here in the deck 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:24.510
 I put the team deck in place 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:28.740
 so you can't keep any marks from 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:32.130
 a small one also used two in this 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:34.680
 so that the paper I chose 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.750
 accidentally I can not know it and not 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.300
 I can know where in the deck 

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.370
 but now the beautiful part comes, I have to 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:44.490
 you must tell a little story 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:48.690
 to know that there was a trio a very trio 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:54.300
 famous that he always saw two ok two jacks 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:56.550
 fixed sets two red jacks and a third one 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.770
 third member of the trio that was always 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.290
 the card chosen by the viewer of 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:03.930
 this case my the problem that the two 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:05.640
 the two jacks and reds fought and 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.620
 so to make me a little more difficult 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.260
 the things I need to choose two 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.030
 different red jack cards but randomly 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.860
 or a jack and red to another card 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.690
 in short, two cards at random the problem is 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.070
 that I am alone and I could choose two 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:19.140
 cards that I already know 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:21.720
 so what will he do he went to open the 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:23.940
 maxxi in this way I will draw two cards 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:26.700
 random from the maf and I'm going to get the 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:28.980
 respective opposites in the ok deck 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:32.760
 we will see for a card here is a card 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:37.920
 here he replaces the turn the two deck 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:38.820
 cards and we have a 5 of hearts and a k of 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:40.800
 flowers 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:43.200
 so now I'm going to take the camp of 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:45.570
 spades and the 5 of diamonds really the cards 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:48.450
 of the same color opposite 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:51.590
 I'm going to look in the deck for it to be 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:51.590
 all completely random 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:11.100
 now we have 5 of paintings here it is the k 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:14.070
 and the k of spades here we are now we have 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:16.230
 took two completely random cards 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:17.640
 I could not possibly know what 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:19.320
 he would draw these two non-cards 

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:20.250
 I could know your card not 

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:24.210
 I can know anything 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:26.040
 ok but having taken these two cards a 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:28.920
 case that as we have said they have 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:31.170
 overturned the duo that will then become a 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:35.430
 the red jack trio like I told them 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:36.990
 always have to stay in three must always 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.730
 chooses must always be with the card 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:41.100
 chosen by the viewer with this 

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:44.670
 case from me so what will i do i will go to 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:47.490
 put the two cards one above deck e 

00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:50.730
 one below the deck that will suffice a 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:53.160
 little touch of fingers and a magical gesture 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:56.580
 because after the deck has moved into 

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:58.919
 this hand in the middle of the two cards that 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:01.740
 have become a trio only remains 

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:05.810
 card that I have chosen unfortunately I don't know if 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:05.810
 that will go see the video I hope so 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:12.570
 ok guys this was the trick of the 

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:15.300
 sandwich of the two check and red a lot 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:17.970
 very much revised personal to me 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:19.830
 see a little more original and nothing 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:21.810
 I sincerely hope you enjoyed it if it is 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:24.210
 so then I like to wear a nice one 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:25.950
 comment by writing what you want 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.390
 I recommend boys very important 

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:29.310
 share the video that it would be 

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:29.850
 a lot to grow the public 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:32.160
 of a channel 

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:34.740
