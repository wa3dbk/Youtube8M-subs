we<00:00:34.500> made<00:00:34.910> three<00:00:35.910> or<00:00:36.030> four<00:00:36.270> really<00:00:36.690> really<00:00:37.020> bad

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
we made three or four really really bad

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.619

mistakes<00:00:37.620> that<00:00:37.950> you<00:00:38.520> know<00:00:38.640> we<00:00:38.850> usually<00:00:39.210> never

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
mistakes that you know we usually never

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.490

do and you know they punish this so yeah

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.490 
do and you know they punish this so yeah
or<00:00:43.770> transition<00:00:44.460> wasn't<00:00:44.820> the<00:00:44.879> best<00:00:45.120> I<00:00:45.870> think

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
or transition wasn't the best I think
