00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
part of this exchange it's not on here I

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:13.660

is this and this is what I teach members
let's<00:06:22.110> take<00:06:22.410> a<00:06:22.440> look<00:06:22.800> at<00:06:23.010> the<00:06:23.220> volume<00:06:24.000> this<00:06:24.960> is

00:06:25.129 --> 00:06:25.139 
let's take a look at the volume this is

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:30.020 
let's take a look at the volume this is
2012<00:06:25.910> here<00:06:27.680> take<00:06:28.680> a<00:06:28.740> look<00:06:28.830> at<00:06:28.979> 2011<00:06:29.280> volume

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:30.030 
2012 here take a look at 2011 volume

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:32.930 
2012 here take a look at 2011 volume
take<00:06:30.660> a<00:06:30.690> look<00:06:30.870> at<00:06:30.960> 2012<00:06:31.440> 2010<00:06:31.979> volume<00:06:32.400> take<00:06:32.880> a

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:32.940 
take a look at 2012 2010 volume take a

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:35.839 
take a look at 2012 2010 volume take a
look<00:06:33.120> at<00:06:33.180> the<00:06:33.270> 2009<00:06:34.080> volume<00:06:34.800> even<00:06:35.190> up<00:06:35.550> volume

00:06:35.839 --> 00:06:35.849 
look at the 2009 volume even up volume

00:06:35.849 --> 00:06:40.820 
look at the 2009 volume even up volume
492<00:06:36.630> that<00:06:36.810> year<00:06:38.450> volume<00:06:39.450> is<00:06:39.870> dropping<00:06:40.440> off<00:06:40.620> the

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:40.830 
492 that year volume is dropping off the

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:44.900 
492 that year volume is dropping off the
cliff<00:06:42.200> so<00:06:43.200> the<00:06:43.349> question<00:06:43.710> I<00:06:43.860> pose<00:06:44.130> is<00:06:44.430> this<00:06:44.729> if

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:44.910 
cliff so the question I pose is this if

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:48.290 
cliff so the question I pose is this if
there<00:06:45.389> are<00:06:45.539> no<00:06:45.720> buyers<00:06:46.080> out<00:06:46.620> there<00:06:46.680> and<00:06:47.300> you

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:48.300 
there are no buyers out there and you

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:50.210 
there are no buyers out there and you
