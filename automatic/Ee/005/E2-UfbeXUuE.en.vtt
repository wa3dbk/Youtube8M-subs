game but since the films and TV series
are<00:01:01.469> clearly<00:01:02.190> stages<00:01:02.730> as<00:01:02.850> what<00:01:03.329> they<00:01:03.480> are<00:01:03.660> it

will<00:01:04.559> be<00:01:04.680> right<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:05.070> assume<00:01:05.369> that<00:01:05.430> battle

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939

that expands the story of Star Wars

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:52.550 
that expands the story of Star Wars
Battlefront<00:01:50.159> and<00:01:50.579> last<00:01:51.509> year<00:01:51.750> we<00:01:51.960> speculated

Battlefront and last year we speculated

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.560 
Battlefront and last year we speculated
in<00:01:52.740> a<00:01:52.829> video<00:01:53.070> that<00:01:53.369> the<00:01:53.820> batter<00:01:54.000> for<00:01:54.240> a<00:01:54.270> story

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
in a video that the batter for a story

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:56.749 
in a video that the batter for a story
could<00:01:54.930> tie<00:01:55.229> into<00:01:55.290> different<00:01:55.740> media<00:01:56.040> such<00:01:56.729> as

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
could tie into different media such as

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.840 
could tie into different media such as
books<00:01:57.090> comics<00:01:57.600> and<00:01:57.960> TV<00:01:58.259> series<00:01:58.469> since<00:01:59.460> this<00:01:59.670> is

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
books comics and TV series since this is

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.550 
books comics and TV series since this is
the<00:01:59.880> first<00:02:00.030> Star<00:02:00.570> Wars<00:02:00.780> video<00:02:01.020> game<00:02:01.259> to<00:02:01.439> be

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
the first Star Wars video game to be

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.920 
the first Star Wars video game to be
considered<00:02:01.979> canon<00:02:02.340> and<00:02:02.520> now<00:02:03.390> that<00:02:03.570> we've<00:02:03.689> seen

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
considered canon and now that we've seen

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.990 
considered canon and now that we've seen
this<00:02:04.140> it<00:02:04.890> looks<00:02:05.280> like<00:02:05.399> that<00:02:05.640> could<00:02:05.820> be<00:02:05.850> the

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
this it looks like that could be the

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.300 
this it looks like that could be the
case<00:02:06.210> and<00:02:06.479> we<00:02:07.170> may<00:02:07.409> very<00:02:07.649> well<00:02:07.799> see<00:02:08.039> the

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
case and we may very well see the

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.339 
case and we may very well see the
battlefront<00:02:08.700> story<00:02:09.000> extending<00:02:09.989> into<00:02:10.140> other

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
battlefront story extending into other

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:13.410 
battlefront story extending into other
books<00:02:10.649> or<00:02:10.860> media<00:02:11.220> I<00:02:11.430> think<00:02:12.120> this<00:02:12.209> is<00:02:12.270> fantastic

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:13.420 
books or media I think this is fantastic

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:15.000 
books or media I think this is fantastic
as<00:02:13.480> the<00:02:13.750> previous<00:02:13.990> two<00:02:14.319> battlefront<00:02:14.800> games

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
as the previous two battlefront games

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.790 
as the previous two battlefront games
weren't<00:02:15.490> very<00:02:15.819> story<00:02:16.270> driven<00:02:16.599> and<00:02:16.930> I'd<00:02:17.440> love

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
weren't very story driven and I'd love

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:19.650 
weren't very story driven and I'd love
to<00:02:17.950> see<00:02:18.130> a<00:02:18.160> heavily<00:02:18.580> focused<00:02:18.819> campaign<00:02:19.120> in<00:02:19.569> the

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
to see a heavily focused campaign in the

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.360 
to see a heavily focused campaign in the
game<00:02:19.870> especially<00:02:20.620> since<00:02:21.130> we<00:02:21.250> are<00:02:21.340> dealing

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
game especially since we are dealing

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.520 
game especially since we are dealing
with<00:02:21.700> the<00:02:21.880> Star<00:02:22.180> Wars<00:02:22.360> universe<00:02:22.450> that<00:02:23.380> has

with the Star Wars universe that has

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.170 
with the Star Wars universe that has
lots<00:02:23.860> of<00:02:24.069> awesome<00:02:24.580> stuff<00:02:24.670> that<00:02:24.970> could<00:02:25.060> be

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
lots of awesome stuff that could be

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:26.729 
lots of awesome stuff that could be
experienced<00:02:25.900> through<00:02:25.930> the<00:02:26.110> video<00:02:26.319> game<00:02:26.560> I'm

00:02:26.729 --> 00:02:26.739

the<00:02:47.019> Internet<00:02:47.319> have<00:02:47.590> speculated<00:02:48.040> that<00:02:48.310> the

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
the Internet have speculated that the

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.160 
the Internet have speculated that the
battlefront<00:02:48.910> video<00:02:49.090> game<00:02:49.360> will<00:02:49.900> be<00:02:50.019> more

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
battlefront video game will be more

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.990 
battlefront video game will be more
focused<00:02:50.440> on<00:02:50.800> the<00:02:50.920> Galactic<00:02:51.310> Civil<00:02:51.610> War<00:02:51.760> era

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:52.000 
focused on the Galactic Civil War era

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.630 
focused on the Galactic Civil War era
and<00:02:52.360> since<00:02:53.170> the<00:02:53.290> book<00:02:53.440> is<00:02:53.650> listed<00:02:54.010> under<00:02:54.130> a<00:02:54.310> new

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:54.640 
and since the book is listed under a new

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:56.759 
and since the book is listed under a new
hope<00:02:54.880> it<00:02:55.420> could<00:02:55.870> very<00:02:55.900> well<00:02:56.200> mean<00:02:56.470> that<00:02:56.680> that's

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:56.769 
hope it could very well mean that that's

00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:58.410 
hope it could very well mean that that's
a<00:02:56.950> time<00:02:57.190> period<00:02:57.519> we<00:02:57.700> could<00:02:57.730> mostly<00:02:58.269> be

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
a time period we could mostly be

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.080 
a time period we could mostly be
experiencing<00:02:59.170> throughout<00:03:00.130> the<00:03:00.250> game<00:03:00.430> so<00:03:00.970> of

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:01.090 
experiencing throughout the game so of

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.570 
experiencing throughout the game so of
course<00:03:01.299> episodes<00:03:01.840> 4<00:03:02.110> to<00:03:02.380> 6<00:03:02.650> and<00:03:02.860> maybe<00:03:03.430> a

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
course episodes 4 to 6 and maybe a

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.610 
course episodes 4 to 6 and maybe a
little<00:03:03.640> bit<00:03:03.910> of<00:03:04.000> 7<00:03:04.330> but<00:03:04.989> of<00:03:05.080> course<00:03:05.110> we'll<00:03:05.500> have

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
little bit of 7 but of course we'll have

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:06.870 
little bit of 7 but of course we'll have
to<00:03:05.769> wait<00:03:05.890> until<00:03:05.950> we<00:03:06.340> get<00:03:06.489> some<00:03:06.670> official

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
to wait until we get some official

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.539 
to wait until we get some official
confirmation<00:03:07.390> on<00:03:07.810> the<00:03:08.470> actual<00:03:08.709> time<00:03:09.130> period

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:09.549 
confirmation on the actual time period

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:12.390 
confirmation on the actual time period
that<00:03:09.640> we<00:03:09.730> could<00:03:09.910> play<00:03:10.180> on<00:03:10.360> or<00:03:10.540> play<00:03:11.170> through<00:03:11.709> in

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
that we could play on or play through in

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.430 
that we could play on or play through in
the<00:03:12.610> game<00:03:12.790> so<00:03:13.390> I<00:03:13.420> think<00:03:13.540> having<00:03:13.840> a<00:03:14.080> battle<00:03:14.230> for

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
the game so I think having a battle for

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.110 
the game so I think having a battle for
novel<00:03:14.799> will<00:03:14.950> be<00:03:15.040> fantastic<00:03:15.730> because<00:03:15.790> it<00:03:16.030> of

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
novel will be fantastic because it of

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.780 
novel will be fantastic because it of
cause<00:03:16.269> it<00:03:16.420> k<00:03:16.569> it<00:03:16.900> extends<00:03:17.410> the<00:03:17.530> story<00:03:17.799> and<00:03:18.130> I

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:18.790 
cause it k it extends the story and I

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.170 
cause it k it extends the story and I
think<00:03:19.180> a<00:03:19.329> more<00:03:19.660> story<00:03:20.140> driven<00:03:20.470> game<00:03:20.910> would<00:03:21.910> get

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
think a more story driven game would get

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.640 
think a more story driven game would get
players<00:03:22.450> coming<00:03:22.810> back<00:03:23.049> to<00:03:23.170> play<00:03:23.290> the<00:03:23.470> game

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
players coming back to play the game

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:24.960 
players coming back to play the game
because<00:03:23.920> it<00:03:24.010> means<00:03:24.160> that<00:03:24.280> we<00:03:24.400> don't<00:03:24.459> just<00:03:24.760> play

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:24.970 
because it means that we don't just play

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.180 
because it means that we don't just play
one<00:03:25.630> little<00:03:25.930> short<00:03:26.200> campaign<00:03:26.650> and<00:03:26.829> that's<00:03:26.950> it

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
one little short campaign and that's it

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.039 
one little short campaign and that's it
and<00:03:27.430> then<00:03:27.700> we<00:03:27.820> all<00:03:27.940> go<00:03:28.090> on<00:03:28.180> to<00:03:28.299> multiplayer<00:03:28.750> and

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:29.049 
and then we all go on to multiplayer and

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:31.860 
and then we all go on to multiplayer and
I<00:03:29.590> think<00:03:29.829> I'd<00:03:29.920> like<00:03:30.130> something<00:03:30.640> that<00:03:30.870> are

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
I think I'd like something that are

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.870 
I think I'd like something that are
offline<00:03:32.500> on<00:03:32.859> the<00:03:32.950> game<00:03:33.100> single<00:03:33.489> play<00:03:33.640> that<00:03:33.820> we

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
offline on the game single play that we

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.610 
offline on the game single play that we
can<00:03:34.000> all<00:03:34.120> experience<00:03:34.540> have<00:03:34.840> lots<00:03:35.290> of<00:03:35.410> fun

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:35.620 
can all experience have lots of fun

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.849 
can all experience have lots of fun
playing<00:03:35.890> and<00:03:36.160> can<00:03:36.790> keep<00:03:36.910> going<00:03:37.180> back<00:03:37.390> and

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:37.859 
playing and can keep going back and

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:39.930 
playing and can keep going back and
experiencing<00:03:38.859> new<00:03:38.890> things<00:03:39.070> that<00:03:39.549> we<00:03:39.609> haven't

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
experiencing new things that we haven't

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.509 
experiencing new things that we haven't
played<00:03:40.420> before<00:03:40.570> and<00:03:41.049> that<00:03:41.709> we<00:03:41.859> just<00:03:42.010> awesome

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:42.519 
played before and that we just awesome

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:44.970 
played before and that we just awesome
so<00:03:43.000> hopefully<00:03:43.600> dice<00:03:43.810> can<00:03:44.109> do<00:03:44.260> this<00:03:44.380> right<00:03:44.680> and

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
so hopefully dice can do this right and

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.560 
so hopefully dice can do this right and
whatever<00:03:45.430> they've<00:03:45.730> got<00:03:45.910> two<00:03:46.030> shows<00:03:46.209> at<00:03:46.540> the

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:46.570
