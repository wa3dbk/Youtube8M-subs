00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
screen from dimming while you're looking

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.640 
screen from dimming while you're looking
at<00:01:08.549> the<00:01:08.640> phone<00:01:08.880> inside<00:01:09.869> is<00:01:10.080> Samsung's<00:01:10.530> own

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
at the phone inside is Samsung's own

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.690 
at the phone inside is Samsung's own
quad-core<00:01:11.400> chip<00:01:11.700> running<00:01:12.000> at<00:01:12.090> 1.4<00:01:12.840> gigahertz

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 
quad-core chip running at 1.4 gigahertz

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.160 
quad-core chip running at 1.4 gigahertz
Samsung<00:01:14.700> says<00:01:14.939> this<00:01:15.090> uses<00:01:15.360> a<00:01:15.390> lot<00:01:15.630> less<00:01:15.869> power

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
Samsung says this uses a lot less power

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.990 
Samsung says this uses a lot less power
than<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.530> dual-core<00:01:16.860> processor<00:01:17.580> in<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.820> s2

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
than the dual-core processor in the s2

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.120 
than the dual-core processor in the s2
now<00:01:18.930> combine<00:01:19.290> that<00:01:19.560> with<00:01:19.619> the<00:01:19.890> high-capacity

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
now combine that with the high-capacity

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.789 
now combine that with the high-capacity
battery<00:01:21.090> and<00:01:21.270> that<00:01:21.600> means<00:01:21.780> the<00:01:21.900> s3<00:01:22.439> will<00:01:22.590> last

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
battery and that means the s3 will last

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.770 
battery and that means the s3 will last
longer<00:01:23.189> away<00:01:23.580> from<00:01:23.790> the<00:01:23.850> mains<00:01:24.030> than<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.299> s2

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
longer away from the mains than the s2

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.560 
longer away from the mains than the s2
or<00:01:25.020> so<00:01:25.500> samsung<00:01:25.979> says<00:01:26.159> anyway<00:01:26.490> there's<00:01:27.420> no

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
or so samsung says anyway there's no

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.600 
or so samsung says anyway there's no
final<00:01:27.900> figure<00:01:28.320> for<00:01:28.500> battery<00:01:28.860> life<00:01:28.890> yet<00:01:29.250> but

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610
