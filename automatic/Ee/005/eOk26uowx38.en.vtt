00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.370
 from the citadel of the carnival of 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:08.580
 viareggio a well found to all of you and 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.759
 welcome to the carnival effect 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.870
 we go to the discovery of another wagon 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:15.109
 of first category 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:19.380
 it is the white gold wagon 

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:21.779
 made by the brothers bonetti come 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.500
 with me because we will really see it really 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.500
 of the beautiful 

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:31.560
 mom 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:39.320
 and here it is uberto bonetti among his 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:44.870
 and the fanthon is half-decomposed then 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:45.739
 which will then take the whole form but is a 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.760
 giant 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:51.680
 also because you see no this then it will go 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:55.070
 so on the wagon it will become even more 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:58.400
 great where you will come up we are 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.900
 maniacs of gigantism in part that 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.239
 making a unique figure must be for 

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:06.110
 strength however will be nothing 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:08.060
 hopes that once you walk 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:10.520
 with which to make its effect 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:14.210
 surely it does we want to show 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:17.600
 a thing friends come uberto this is the 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:20.990
 sketch that initially had a 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:23.150
 single color then along the way 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.790
 I also believe rightly with yours 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:29.270
 brother, you decided to paint it 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:32.690
 this is this elephant because why it goes 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:35.420
 meanwhile because of a different effect not 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.759
 there is in the sense as they had 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:41.119
 chromatic instead so it gives 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:44.689
 meanwhile there is also a setting 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:47.840
 painting has a value then painting 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:52.460
 decorating it with a hundred fresco paintings 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:54.859
 only you did before is instead here I see 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.530
 on this side there are a lot of hands 

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:59.689
 beautiful no I represent the way to 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.990
 hands crossed so the part of the 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:01.990
 brotherhood 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:09.560
 then we have a little bit of africa 

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:12.410
 obviously then on the other side we have 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:15.380
 the world in short we have if the world 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.760
 reflected in the eye then in the center 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:18.050
 accomplices of Africa because it represents 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.180
 with that the African elephant 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.370
 because ours is a theme we are from 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.920
 protests against the graph i 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:28.310
 we recall the exact title of the gully 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:30.200
 white gold because white gold white gold 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.870
 it is a protest against traffic 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.270
 illegal work then behind those 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:40.849
 behind it there is extermination 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:43.099
 of fairies and then those of yesterday who that 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:46.849
 gain from the sale 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:49.760
 here are the fangs you the net made these 

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:52.310
 the fangs are how long they are 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.680
 for about four and a half years 5 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:58.060
 mom my boys so you want 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:01.700
 denounce this abuse because 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:04.069
 the elephant is not at risk of extinction but 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.890
 in short, over the years they are hunted 

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:08.660
 too many sisters of it raw and then of 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.209
 then there is also human death 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:13.430
 because who earns from this there 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:17.630
 finances for wars to understand Africa 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:19.849
 so it's a chain back then 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:22.280
 this elephant that will delight the gods 

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:25.130
 children because they will see this elephant 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:28.250
 giant see how many messages and 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:30.410
 they want to give the brothers bonetti ie 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.959
 message towards animals 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:34.700
 however, with regard to wars it is 

00:03:32.959 --> 00:03:36.950
 let's do with the spirit of carnival 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.620
 so there will be many masks that 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:42.370
 kind of music or you will obviously use type 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:44.930
 Africans undoubtedly ethnic music 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.660
 ethnic quests in fact we will also have a 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:50.530
 group of Senegalese who will come 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.530
 play with us 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.680
 therefore nothing of times policies 

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:58.590
 anyone who does satire also do themes 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:01.190
 we are also delicate subjects like success 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:03.290
 with the vanzini a few years ago sum 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:05.850
 then viareggio carnival 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:08.310
 and this is also not what I saw in 

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:11.340
 his whole I say joking but it's true 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:13.709
 which in its kind is the biggest party 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.690
 beautiful of the world of its kind is the 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:19.139
 most beautiful festival of the world of its kind 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:21.900
 but see no there is satire with matteo 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:25.560
 there is a complaint here of a 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:29.430
 continent of the wars of Africa there 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:30.840
 are other topics addressed as Italy 

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:34.530
 as a whole also in a manner 

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:37.610
 positive understood as no forge of 

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:40.440
 great scientists of great poets 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:44.310
 in short, art is truly one 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:46.560
 show that lends itself to 360 degrees a 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:49.050
 talk about so many topics then 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.330
 I have a pity to give up the carnival of 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.580
 viareggio are four Sundays le 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.960
 four Sundays in February and Saturday 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:58.770
 the last of February 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:00.120
 remember 1 8 15 22 and 28 at least one 

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:04.020
 time you have to come because one 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:05.820
 unique show of its kind also 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:08.340
 because you have to finance it carnival 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:11.820
 so we invite all viewers 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:14.340
 to participate in the carnival and to do so 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:16.700
 getting bigger and bigger is everything 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:19.140
 ready now we are at the doors in short 

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:21.720
 you are on the home straight 

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:24.660
 I imagine you will be very curious to understand 

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:27.390
 then how badly it is mounted outside the 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:29.910
 how the crane works like Latin 

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:31.410
 we begin to assemble the bust and to 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:34.919
 face the head because its head 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:36.330
 we finish assembling the last pieces e 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:38.940
 then you will do the tests of the 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:41.280
 movements, here I see the model 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:44.789
 close this interview 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:48.150
 going to see the model there 

00:05:44.789 --> 00:05:50.940
 will allow to understand the scenic effect i 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:54.390
 movements that will have this dear gold 

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:57.070
 white of the brothers bonetti is like 

00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:59.410
 it works explain uberto us 

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:00.280
 it is practically positioned on a platform 

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:02.300
 rotating 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:07.069
 so who sees you coming 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:09.139
 meeting the elephant sees it we say up 

00:06:07.069 --> 00:06:11.900
 both sides not because they were there 

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:13.039
 this way figure will be engaged here 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:18.199
 then the one that opens is raised 

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:23.509
 in front it makes such an oscillating movement e 

00:06:18.199 --> 00:06:25.280
 the head but moves on 10 look and 

00:06:23.509 --> 00:06:28.849
 then the mouth will also move the eyes 

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:31.840
 the proboscis a show in short le 

00:06:28.849 --> 00:06:36.020
 dimensions here you think this is one 

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:39.590
 leg itself is a quarry that is not complete 

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:41.719
 that is, here you see that you understand the 

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:43.819
 in short, really i 

00:06:41.719 --> 00:06:46.819
 congratulations now you can make it move 

00:06:43.819 --> 00:06:49.699
 let's close this this hemp 

00:06:46.819 --> 00:06:51.830
 service on the white gold wagon of the 

00:06:49.699 --> 00:06:54.110
 brothers moments with the paw that yes 

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:57.440
 moves that says moves so moves yet 

00:06:54.110 --> 00:07:01.669
 it moves and because decisive corset does yes 

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:04.830
 they move like when it does the quanta 

00:07:01.669 --> 00:07:08.160
 beautiful expects that it grabs me branches 

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:12.470
 here it is, here it is, here it is technical, not 

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:16.410
 yes, you can do that too 

00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:19.200
 and then we said more than once 

00:07:16.410 --> 00:07:23.040
 that there are the movers that is those 

00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:25.380
 that inside the wagon they make to move the 

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:26.850
 various structures pulling organs 

00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:29.850
 of the ropes but there are also gods 

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:32.910
 piston movements in this case is a 

00:07:29.850 --> 00:07:34.380
 in short, guided movement with the piston 

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:36.960
 we make all the movements of it 

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:39.750
 plumbers this year to all grain and 

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:42.480
 so this year everything is hydraulic 

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:44.550
 you went by the old ropes ha 

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:49.010
 however this too must be managed by 

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:52.320
 but a person does so much less 

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:55.080
 well then good luck in the mouth to 

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:57.650
 wolf white gold brothers bonetti wagon 

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:57.650
 of first category 

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:04.590
 but 

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:04.590
 from mom 

00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:06.960
 no
