00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
the difference between pattern fishing

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.680 
the difference between pattern fishing
and<00:00:06.660> spot<00:00:07.440> or<00:00:07.770> location<00:00:08.700> fishing<00:00:09.179> what<00:00:09.570> you

consistently all day long right you want

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:15.919 
consistently all day long right you want
it<00:00:14.519> to<00:00:14.610> be<00:00:14.759> more<00:00:14.969> catching<00:00:15.509> than<00:00:15.690> it<00:00:15.809> is

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
it to be more catching than it is

strategic part of fishing comes into

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.359 
strategic part of fishing comes into
play<00:00:25.910> understanding<00:00:26.910> what<00:00:27.539> bass<00:00:27.840> do<00:00:28.230> and<00:00:28.560> the

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
play understanding what bass do and the

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.580 
play understanding what bass do and the
fact<00:00:29.609> that<00:00:29.730> there<00:00:29.970> are<00:00:30.119> patterns<00:00:30.630> patterns

that fish do throughout a day and

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.630 
that fish do throughout a day and
there's<00:00:34.350> going<00:00:34.469> to<00:00:34.530> be<00:00:34.590> multiple<00:00:34.890> ones<00:00:35.430> on<00:00:35.610> a

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
day and then locations the difference

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:41.540 
day and then locations the difference
between<00:00:39.600> the<00:00:39.719> two<00:00:39.930> now<00:00:40.770> what<00:00:40.980> happens<00:00:41.340> is<00:00:41.520> I

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
between the two now what happens is I

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.190 
between the two now what happens is I
see<00:00:41.969> a<00:00:42.000> lot<00:00:42.149> of<00:00:42.270> guys<00:00:42.390> go<00:00:42.629> fishing<00:00:43.020> and<00:00:43.110> they

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.209 
understand pattern fishing what it means
and<00:00:59.899> and<00:01:00.899> on<00:01:01.350> top<00:01:01.530> of<00:01:01.649> that<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.890> basic

the<00:01:03.870> year<00:01:04.170> you're<00:01:04.830> really<00:01:05.100> merely<00:01:05.430> missing

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
the year you're really merely missing

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.640 
the year you're really merely missing
out<00:01:06.030> because<00:01:06.240> you're<00:01:06.540> not<00:01:06.659> able<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:06.990> duplicate

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
out because you're not able to duplicate

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.310 
out because you're not able to duplicate
bites<00:01:07.979> and<00:01:08.310> that's<00:01:08.820> what<00:01:09.090> pattern<00:01:09.720> fishing<00:01:10.200> is

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
bites and that's what pattern fishing is

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.160 
bites and that's what pattern fishing is
all<00:01:10.470> about<00:01:10.500> when<00:01:11.430> you<00:01:11.549> get<00:01:11.700> a<00:01:11.729> bite<00:01:12.170> ninety

percent of the times nine times out of

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.210 
percent of the times nine times out of
10<00:01:15.180> it<00:01:15.450> means<00:01:15.479> something<00:01:16.200> you<00:01:16.409> can<00:01:17.009> learn

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
something from that that's going to help

maybe<00:01:21.390> it's<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:21.689> specific<00:01:21.900> spot<00:01:22.409> maybe<00:01:23.100> it's

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
maybe it's a specific spot maybe it's

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.060 
maybe it's a specific spot maybe it's
the<00:01:23.430> type<00:01:23.640> of<00:01:23.670> cover<00:01:24.060> or<00:01:24.509> structure<00:01:25.229> that<00:01:25.770> the

color all those just different variables

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.399 
color all those just different variables
you<00:01:38.189> can<00:01:38.340> learn<00:01:38.579> something<00:01:38.909> from<00:01:39.259> almost<00:01:40.259> all

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
you can learn something from almost all

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:43.039 
you can learn something from almost all
fish<00:01:40.890> catches<00:01:41.340> some<00:01:41.850> will<00:01:42.060> misguide<00:01:42.420> you<00:01:42.810> some

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.050 
fish catches some will misguide you some
will<00:01:43.259> but<00:01:43.770> most<00:01:44.189> of<00:01:44.399> them<00:01:44.549> are<00:01:44.670> going<00:01:44.820> to<00:01:44.880> tell

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
will but most of them are going to tell

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.980 
will but most of them are going to tell
you<00:01:45.149> something<00:01:45.770> what<00:01:46.770> its<00:01:46.920> location<00:01:47.670> or<00:01:47.990> spot

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.590 
and just mix it up you're just kind of
floating<00:03:31.470> around<00:03:31.560> all<00:03:32.100> day<00:03:32.330> until<00:03:33.330> you<00:03:33.420> get

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
floating around all day until you get

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:35.390 
floating around all day until you get
that<00:03:33.720> bite<00:03:33.960> and<00:03:34.320> then<00:03:34.920> when<00:03:35.040> you<00:03:35.130> get<00:03:35.250> that

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
that bite and then when you get that

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.210 
that bite and then when you get that
bite<00:03:35.750> then<00:03:36.750> you<00:03:36.900> slow<00:03:37.170> down<00:03:37.410> and<00:03:37.830> maybe<00:03:38.070> you

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
bite then you slow down and maybe you

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.400 
bite then you slow down and maybe you
figure<00:03:38.490> out<00:03:38.520> if<00:03:39.300> I<00:03:39.480> slow<00:03:39.690> down<00:03:39.900> and<00:03:40.050> I<00:03:40.080> get<00:03:40.260> more

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
figure out if I slow down and I get more

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.100 
figure out if I slow down and I get more
bites<00:03:40.680> in<00:03:41.010> this<00:03:41.520> area<00:03:41.880> okay<00:03:42.300> it's<00:03:42.480> just<00:03:42.630> it's<00:03:43.020> a

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
bites in this area okay it's just it's a

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:44.960 
bites in this area okay it's just it's a
spot<00:03:43.380> or<00:03:43.620> an<00:03:43.770> area<00:03:44.100> location<00:03:44.640> there's<00:03:44.790> just<00:03:44.910> a

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
spot or an area location there's just a

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.550 
spot or an area location there's just a
lot<00:03:45.060> of<00:03:45.180> fish<00:03:45.300> here<00:03:45.510> and<00:03:45.840> maybe<00:03:46.200> you<00:03:46.320> can't

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:46.560 
lot of fish here and maybe you can't

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.050 
lot of fish here and maybe you can't
duplicate<00:03:47.040> that<00:03:47.250> if<00:03:47.370> you<00:03:47.460> catch<00:03:47.640> a<00:03:47.730> fish<00:03:47.880> on<00:03:48.000> a

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
duplicate that if you catch a fish on a

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.050 
duplicate that if you catch a fish on a
point<00:03:48.390> and<00:03:48.630> you<00:03:49.620> you<00:03:50.100> go<00:03:50.280> in<00:03:50.460> you<00:03:50.670> catch<00:03:50.880> fish

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
point and you you go in you catch fish

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:52.910 
point and you you go in you catch fish
on<00:03:51.270> the<00:03:51.360> point<00:03:51.600> and<00:03:51.810> then<00:03:51.900> you<00:03:51.990> go<00:03:52.140> into<00:03:52.560> the

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
on the point and then you go into the

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.190 
on the point and then you go into the
pocket<00:03:53.430> and<00:03:53.610> you<00:03:54.090> catch<00:03:54.300> fish<00:03:54.540> in<00:03:54.570> the<00:03:54.780> pocket

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
pocket and you catch fish in the pocket

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.890 
pocket and you catch fish in the pocket
okay<00:03:55.440> well<00:03:55.620> shoot<00:03:56.610> I<00:03:56.790> mean<00:03:56.970> maybe<00:03:57.630> this<00:03:57.780> is

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
okay well shoot I mean maybe this is

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.420 
okay well shoot I mean maybe this is
just<00:03:57.930> a<00:03:58.110> good<00:03:58.230> area<00:03:58.560> so<00:03:58.740> you<00:03:58.800> go<00:03:59.040> to<00:03:59.100> another

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
just a good area so you go to another

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.340 
just a good area so you go to another
point<00:03:59.700> in<00:04:00.000> another<00:04:00.270> creek<00:04:00.630> or<00:04:00.840> something<00:04:00.990> on

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350 
point in another creek or something on

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:05.360 
point in another creek or something on
the<00:04:01.470> main<00:04:01.620> Lake<00:04:01.890> and<00:04:02.420> and<00:04:04.010> you<00:04:05.010> don't<00:04:05.220> get<00:04:05.310> a

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
the main Lake and and you don't get a

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.610 
the main Lake and and you don't get a
bite<00:04:05.580> you<00:04:05.850> go<00:04:06.000> in<00:04:06.150> the<00:04:06.240> pocket<00:04:06.660> of<00:04:06.840> another

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
bite you go in the pocket of another

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:09.230 
bite you go in the pocket of another
Creek<00:04:07.890> you<00:04:08.070> don't<00:04:08.250> get<00:04:08.340> a<00:04:08.400> bite<00:04:08.580> you<00:04:08.850> you<00:04:09.060> do

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:09.240 
Creek you don't get a bite you you do

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.090 
Creek you don't get a bite you you do
this<00:04:09.360> all<00:04:09.570> day<00:04:09.750> you<00:04:09.810> just<00:04:10.080> keep<00:04:10.470> I<00:04:10.830> want<00:04:11.010> I'm

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:11.100 
this all day you just keep I want I'm

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:12.350 
this all day you just keep I want I'm
fishing<00:04:11.400> the<00:04:11.490> same<00:04:11.550> thing<00:04:11.820> that<00:04:11.910> I<00:04:11.970> got<00:04:12.120> bites

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:12.360 
fishing the same thing that I got bites

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.270 
fishing the same thing that I got bites
but<00:04:12.570> it's<00:04:13.230> not<00:04:13.380> it's<00:04:13.530> not<00:04:13.650> necessarily<00:04:14.220> a

but it's not it's not necessarily a

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:16.580 
but it's not it's not necessarily a
pattern<00:04:14.730> okay<00:04:15.150> a<00:04:15.180> pattern<00:04:15.630> is<00:04:15.750> something<00:04:15.930> now

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
pattern okay a pattern is something now

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:18.620 
pattern okay a pattern is something now
you<00:04:16.650> can<00:04:16.950> duplicate<00:04:17.370> you<00:04:18.030> get<00:04:18.210> a<00:04:18.239> bite<00:04:18.450> on<00:04:18.480> a

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
you can duplicate you get a bite on a

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.690 
you can duplicate you get a bite on a
point<00:04:18.930> with<00:04:19.290> some<00:04:19.410> wood<00:04:19.650> and<00:04:19.680> rock<00:04:20.070> you<00:04:20.580> go

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
point with some wood and rock you go

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.700 
point with some wood and rock you go
find<00:04:20.970> another<00:04:21.299> point<00:04:21.540> that<00:04:21.660> has<00:04:21.870> wood<00:04:22.260> and<00:04:22.560> or

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
find another point that has wood and or

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.650 
find another point that has wood and or
rock<00:04:22.980> and<00:04:23.220> you<00:04:23.280> go<00:04:23.430> fish<00:04:23.700> it<00:04:23.880> or<00:04:24.030> you<00:04:24.419> fish<00:04:24.630> a

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:24.660 
rock and you go fish it or you fish a

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:25.840 
rock and you go fish it or you fish a
point<00:04:24.990> that<00:04:25.080> has<00:04:25.230> wood

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 
point that has wood

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:27.910 
point that has wood
and<00:04:25.940> you<00:04:26.270> go<00:04:26.390> fish<00:04:26.630> it<00:04:26.840> and<00:04:27.050> you<00:04:27.410> have<00:04:27.590> you<00:04:27.830> go

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:27.920 
and you go fish it and you have you go

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.260 
and you go fish it and you have you go
fish<00:04:28.130> one<00:04:28.310> that<00:04:28.400> has<00:04:28.550> rock<00:04:28.790> and<00:04:29.090> you<00:04:29.150> go

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
fish one that has rock and you go

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:30.520 
fish one that has rock and you go
fishing<00:04:29.600> then<00:04:29.750> you<00:04:29.840> fish<00:04:30.020> ones<00:04:30.290> that<00:04:30.410> have

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
fishing then you fish ones that have

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.130 
fishing then you fish ones that have
similar<00:04:30.830> topography<00:04:31.670> what's<00:04:32.600> on<00:04:32.750> the<00:04:32.900> bottom

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:33.140 
similar topography what's on the bottom

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:35.770 
similar topography what's on the bottom
there's<00:04:33.560> the<00:04:33.790> structure<00:04:34.790> the<00:04:35.360> different

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 
there's the structure the different

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.960 
there's the structure the different
depths<00:04:36.290> different<00:04:37.100> things<00:04:37.310> like<00:04:37.490> that<00:04:37.670> is<00:04:37.850> it

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:37.970 
depths different things like that is it

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:40.330 
depths different things like that is it
a<00:04:38.000> flat<00:04:38.300> point<00:04:38.660> is<00:04:38.930> it<00:04:39.470> a<00:04:39.530> really<00:04:39.710> deep<00:04:40.010> point

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
a flat point is it a really deep point

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.460 
a flat point is it a really deep point
is<00:04:40.610> it<00:04:41.180> one<00:04:41.360> that's<00:04:41.600> real<00:04:41.780> flattened<00:04:42.200> and<00:04:42.290> just

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470 
is it one that's real flattened and just

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:44.080 
is it one that's real flattened and just
drops<00:04:42.740> right<00:04:42.890> off<00:04:43.040> into<00:04:43.400> the<00:04:43.430> river<00:04:43.610> channel

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:44.090 
drops right off into the river channel

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:45.790 
drops right off into the river channel
or<00:04:44.180> a<00:04:44.270> creek<00:04:44.480> channel<00:04:44.510> all<00:04:45.260> those<00:04:45.500> different

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:45.800 
or a creek channel all those different

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.320 
or a creek channel all those different
things<00:04:45.830> make<00:04:46.160> a<00:04:46.190> big<00:04:46.580> big<00:04:46.760> difference<00:04:47.180> there

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.330 
things make a big big difference there

00:04:47.330 --> 00:04:48.190 
things make a big big difference there
highways

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:48.200 
highways

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:50.260 
highways
so<00:04:48.830> the<00:04:49.070> different<00:04:49.430> cover<00:04:49.670> and<00:04:49.910> structure

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:50.270 
so the different cover and structure

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:52.570 
so the different cover and structure
options<00:04:50.690> that's<00:04:51.110> how<00:04:51.380> you<00:04:51.440> dictate<00:04:52.010> you<00:04:52.430> know

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
options that's how you dictate you know

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.550 
options that's how you dictate you know
and<00:04:52.730> you<00:04:52.790> differentiate<00:04:53.510> what's<00:04:54.080> a<00:04:54.200> pattern

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:54.560 
and you differentiate what's a pattern

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:55.960 
and you differentiate what's a pattern
and<00:04:54.740> there's<00:04:54.920> multiple<00:04:55.160> patterns<00:04:55.580> that<00:04:55.820> can

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:55.970 
and there's multiple patterns that can

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:58.720 
and there's multiple patterns that can
go<00:04:56.090> on<00:04:56.120> in<00:04:56.300> a<00:04:56.450> day<00:04:56.740> especially<00:04:57.740> certain<00:04:58.460> times

00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:58.730 
go on in a day especially certain times

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:01.630 
go on in a day especially certain times
a<00:04:58.850> year<00:04:59.060> like<00:04:59.240> in<00:04:59.390> the<00:04:59.570> in<00:04:59.780> the<00:04:59.870> spring<00:05:00.640> summer

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:01.640 
a year like in the in the spring summer

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:03.670 
a year like in the in the spring summer
and<00:05:01.910> even<00:05:02.030> fall<00:05:02.180> really<00:05:02.780> I<00:05:03.080> mean<00:05:03.260> a<00:05:03.320> lot<00:05:03.560> of

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:03.680 
and even fall really I mean a lot of

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:04.930 
and even fall really I mean a lot of
times<00:05:03.830> there's<00:05:04.100> just<00:05:04.310> different<00:05:04.580> patterns

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:04.940 
times there's just different patterns

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:07.090 
times there's just different patterns
going<00:05:05.210> on<00:05:05.360> in<00:05:05.570> different<00:05:05.810> parts<00:05:05.990> of<00:05:06.260> like<00:05:06.440> one

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:07.100 
going on in different parts of like one

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:10.150 
going on in different parts of like one
part<00:05:07.370> of<00:05:07.460> the<00:05:07.520> lake<00:05:07.870> might<00:05:08.870> have<00:05:09.140> a<00:05:09.530> really

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:10.160 
part of the lake might have a really

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.620 
part of the lake might have a really
strong<00:05:10.220> shallow<00:05:10.730> bite<00:05:11.000> and<00:05:11.240> then<00:05:11.480> there's

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.630 
strong shallow bite and then there's

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:13.810 
strong shallow bite and then there's
some<00:05:11.810> fish<00:05:11.990> deep<00:05:12.260> and<00:05:12.500> then<00:05:13.070> one<00:05:13.280> part<00:05:13.460> of<00:05:13.580> Lake

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:13.820 
some fish deep and then one part of Lake

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:16.090 
some fish deep and then one part of Lake
has<00:05:14.090> a<00:05:14.120> little<00:05:14.570> bit<00:05:14.690> of<00:05:14.780> both<00:05:14.900> both<00:05:15.830> are<00:05:16.010> kind

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:16.100 
has a little bit of both both are kind

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:17.890 
has a little bit of both both are kind
of<00:05:16.250> happening<00:05:16.610> and<00:05:16.820> then<00:05:17.270> the<00:05:17.390> other<00:05:17.510> part<00:05:17.750> of

00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:17.900 
of happening and then the other part of

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.780 
of happening and then the other part of
Lake<00:05:18.050> it<00:05:18.320> so<00:05:18.500> it's<00:05:18.710> a<00:05:18.830> really<00:05:19.250> good<00:05:19.400> deep<00:05:19.580> bite

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:19.790 
Lake it so it's a really good deep bite

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:21.310 
Lake it so it's a really good deep bite
but<00:05:20.120> the<00:05:20.210> shallow<00:05:20.360> bites<00:05:20.630> just<00:05:20.780> not<00:05:20.960> that<00:05:21.110> good

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:21.320 
but the shallow bites just not that good

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:23.290 
but the shallow bites just not that good
and<00:05:21.620> that<00:05:21.650> really<00:05:22.310> comes<00:05:22.580> down<00:05:22.730> to<00:05:22.880> water

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:23.300 
and that really comes down to water

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:24.310 
and that really comes down to water
clear<00:05:23.510> that's<00:05:23.720> one<00:05:23.810> of<00:05:23.900> the<00:05:23.960> things<00:05:24.140> we've

00:05:24.310 --> 00:05:24.320 
clear that's one of the things we've

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.710 
clear that's one of the things we've
been<00:05:24.350> talking<00:05:24.800> about<00:05:24.860> up<00:05:25.850> Lake<00:05:26.180> you<00:05:26.570> might

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:26.720 
been talking about up Lake you might

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:28.000 
been talking about up Lake you might
have<00:05:26.870> dirty<00:05:27.140> or<00:05:27.290> what<00:05:27.410> that's<00:05:27.620> typically

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:28.010 
have dirty or what that's typically

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:31.120 
have dirty or what that's typically
gonna<00:05:28.130> have<00:05:28.370> dirtier<00:05:28.730> water<00:05:29.080> so<00:05:30.080> the<00:05:30.770> fish<00:05:30.800> are

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:31.130 
gonna have dirtier water so the fish are

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:32.650 
gonna have dirtier water so the fish are
generically<00:05:31.640> generally<00:05:32.420> going<00:05:32.540> to<00:05:32.600> be

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:32.660 
generically generally going to be

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:34.570 
generically generally going to be
shallower<00:05:33.290> so<00:05:33.650> the<00:05:33.740> deeper<00:05:34.010> bites<00:05:34.190> not<00:05:34.430> gonna

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:34.580 
shallower so the deeper bites not gonna

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:35.590 
shallower so the deeper bites not gonna
be<00:05:34.700> near<00:05:34.880> as<00:05:34.970> good<00:05:35.120> up<00:05:35.330> there

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:35.600 
be near as good up there

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.420 
be near as good up there
in<00:05:35.810> general<00:05:36.560> you<00:05:36.800> may<00:05:36.920> be<00:05:36.980> able<00:05:37.130> to<00:05:37.250> fish

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:37.430 
in general you may be able to fish

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:39.700 
in general you may be able to fish
offshore<00:05:37.640> but<00:05:38.030> it's<00:05:38.150> not<00:05:38.270> gonna<00:05:38.450> be<00:05:38.540> deep<00:05:38.750> okay

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:39.710 
offshore but it's not gonna be deep okay

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:41.890 
offshore but it's not gonna be deep okay
and<00:05:40.250> then<00:05:40.520> you<00:05:40.580> go<00:05:40.610> mid<00:05:40.910> lake<00:05:41.150> it's<00:05:41.630> a<00:05:41.690> little

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:41.900 
and then you go mid lake it's a little

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:44.320 
and then you go mid lake it's a little
bit<00:05:41.990> clearer<00:05:42.260> it's<00:05:42.770> stained<00:05:43.130> it's<00:05:43.760> not<00:05:44.000> clear

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:44.330 
bit clearer it's stained it's not clear

00:05:44.330 --> 00:05:46.930 
bit clearer it's stained it's not clear
though<00:05:44.540> it's<00:05:45.020> in<00:05:45.230> between<00:05:45.370> that's<00:05:46.370> where<00:05:46.580> you

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:46.940 
though it's in between that's where you

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:48.280 
though it's in between that's where you
might<00:05:47.090> have<00:05:47.120> a<00:05:47.270> little<00:05:47.480> bit<00:05:47.570> of<00:05:47.600> a<00:05:47.690> shallow<00:05:47.900> and

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:48.290 
might have a little bit of a shallow and

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:50.050 
might have a little bit of a shallow and
a<00:05:48.380> little<00:05:48.620> bit<00:05:48.710> of<00:05:48.770> a<00:05:48.830> deep<00:05:49.010> bite<00:05:49.220> and<00:05:49.880> then<00:05:49.970> you

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:50.060 
a little bit of a deep bite and then you

00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:52.000 
a little bit of a deep bite and then you
go<00:05:50.150> down<00:05:50.360> towards<00:05:50.630> the<00:05:50.810> dam<00:05:50.990> where<00:05:51.650> the<00:05:51.800> water

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:52.010 
go down towards the dam where the water

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:53.740 
go down towards the dam where the water
is<00:05:52.130> the<00:05:52.250> clearest<00:05:52.640> on<00:05:52.820> the<00:05:52.910> entire<00:05:53.210> Lake<00:05:53.450> and

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:53.750 
is the clearest on the entire Lake and

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:56.020 
is the clearest on the entire Lake and
the<00:05:54.410> fish<00:05:54.620> are<00:05:54.770> generally<00:05:55.250> deeper<00:05:55.820> and

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:56.030 
the fish are generally deeper and

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:57.460 
the fish are generally deeper and
they're<00:05:56.510> gonna<00:05:56.630> be<00:05:56.780> a<00:05:56.810> little<00:05:56.990> bit<00:05:57.140> harder<00:05:57.380> to

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:57.470 
they're gonna be a little bit harder to

00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:59.620 
they're gonna be a little bit harder to
catch<00:05:57.680> in<00:05:58.010> general<00:05:58.820> with<00:05:58.970> the<00:05:59.000> clear<00:05:59.330> water

00:05:59.620 --> 00:05:59.630 
catch in general with the clear water

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:02.440 
catch in general with the clear water
but<00:05:59.900> that<00:05:59.930> is<00:06:00.200> not<00:06:00.350> an<00:06:00.500> absolute<00:06:00.770> trust<00:06:01.160> me<00:06:01.450> so

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:02.450 
but that is not an absolute trust me so

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:04.660 
but that is not an absolute trust me so
that's<00:06:03.230> how<00:06:03.470> you<00:06:03.530> differentiate<00:06:04.040> try<00:06:04.580> and

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:04.670 
that's how you differentiate try and

00:06:04.670 --> 00:06:05.770 
that's how you differentiate try and
figure<00:06:04.790> that<00:06:04.910> out<00:06:05.150> if<00:06:05.300> you're<00:06:05.390> wanting<00:06:05.630> to<00:06:05.690> go

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:05.780 
figure that out if you're wanting to go

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:07.360 
figure that out if you're wanting to go
out<00:06:05.930> there<00:06:06.140> figure<00:06:06.770> fish<00:06:06.950> out<00:06:07.100> for<00:06:07.340> a

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:07.370 
out there figure fish out for a

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:09.160 
out there figure fish out for a
tournament<00:06:07.670> try<00:06:08.390> and<00:06:08.540> get<00:06:08.630> into<00:06:08.810> that<00:06:08.930> pattern

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:09.170 
tournament try and get into that pattern

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:10.600 
tournament try and get into that pattern
fish<00:06:09.500> and<00:06:09.650> pick<00:06:09.770> out<00:06:09.920> all<00:06:10.100> these<00:06:10.250> different

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:10.610 
fish and pick out all these different

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:12.670 
fish and pick out all these different
lures<00:06:10.760> all<00:06:11.030> these<00:06:11.150> different<00:06:11.420> techniques<00:06:11.780> fly

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:12.680 
lures all these different techniques fly

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:14.890 
lures all these different techniques fly
around<00:06:12.860> until<00:06:13.280> you<00:06:13.370> get<00:06:13.490> a<00:06:13.550> bite<00:06:13.790> and<00:06:14.090> then<00:06:14.690> try

00:06:14.890 --> 00:06:14.900 
around until you get a bite and then try

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:17.230 
around until you get a bite and then try
and<00:06:14.930> figure<00:06:15.170> out<00:06:15.400> where<00:06:16.400> there<00:06:16.550> was<00:06:16.910> this<00:06:17.030> fish

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:17.240 
and figure out where there was this fish

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:18.850 
and figure out where there was this fish
relating<00:06:17.630> to<00:06:17.720> the<00:06:17.810> wood<00:06:17.990> was<00:06:18.320> it<00:06:18.440> relating<00:06:18.770> to

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:18.860 
relating to the wood was it relating to

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:21.820 
relating to the wood was it relating to
the<00:06:18.950> point<00:06:19.310> wasn't<00:06:20.150> relating<00:06:20.630> to<00:06:20.840> a<00:06:21.200> point

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:21.830 
the point wasn't relating to a point

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:23.830 
the point wasn't relating to a point
that<00:06:21.860> had<00:06:22.130> rock<00:06:22.400> and<00:06:22.730> wood<00:06:22.940> or<00:06:23.180> is<00:06:23.480> the<00:06:23.630> wood

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:23.840 
that had rock and wood or is the wood

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.930 
that had rock and wood or is the wood
important<00:06:24.440> or<00:06:24.830> is<00:06:25.100> it<00:06:25.220> the<00:06:25.310> rock<00:06:25.490> and

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:25.940 
important or is it the rock and

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:27.160 
important or is it the rock and
sometimes<00:06:26.300> you<00:06:26.390> can't<00:06:26.600> really<00:06:26.780> figure<00:06:26.960> it<00:06:27.110> all

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:27.170 
sometimes you can't really figure it all
