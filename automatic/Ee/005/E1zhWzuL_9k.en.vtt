00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:07.729
 more tuna pancakes and that's what 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:13.190
 We are going to visit and I have two cans of 

00:00:07.729 --> 00:00:15.730
 tuna in water or discovering the best 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:15.730
 coastal 

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:26.190

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:26.190
 that these are for more 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:30.369
 and we need 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:39.260

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.719

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:46.760

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:55.729
 I'm going to put in because the cookies already 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:01:00.350
 they have to use I'm going to put a little 

00:00:55.729 --> 00:01:02.809
 nothing more and so that it stops so that 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:07.280
 phenomenon is going to put a little bit of flour 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:10.490
 a little bit more like a spoonful 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:13.039

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.020
 is well revel by and right now 

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:18.740
 I show how I'm going to do the 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:21.900
 pancakes other rhythms four pieces of 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:24.240
 tuna as you say to me 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.640
 and I tell them if I put some 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.170
 something else maybe nothing is going to put a 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.520
 little more salt 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.520
 the whole is based 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:41.729
 but a little more flour 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.720
 to have more or less a 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:48.720
 tablespoon of resources 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:53.010
 Well now I tell you how to do that 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:56.010
 I'm going to come out here maybe 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.010
 16 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:09.070
 point 5 and a half ounce 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.070
 no, sorry 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:16.820
 more or less a little more salt that already 

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:20.060
 it depends on you and here I have the 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:22.220
 hot oil in the pan get like this 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.620
 more or less 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.570
 and that depends on you the amount 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:30.470
 that you want and I'm going to do it like that 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:32.220
 more or less and I'm going to put it here in the 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:33.950
 skillet 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:38.349
 and that is done 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:41.040
 and so I 'm going to do it because not very rare 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:43.349
 but 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.219
 although I have a golden monitor and so 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:46.019
 I'm going to do it 

00:02:44.219 --> 00:02:48.260
 the duration I show you the result 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:48.260
 final 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.450
 let's get 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:04.400
 then I will serve them 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:06.560
 finally so now we forget 6 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:11.510
 these pancakes and they only served 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:16.030
 so I like to have more cameras 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:18.550
 nothing more for a little we are 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:21.750
 the croquettes are the fillings or 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:24.180
 pancakes as they say and their entrance good 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.380
 this is especially for Lent 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.360
 with its strips to commit the crime 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:30.810
 up if you liked it and until next time 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.810
