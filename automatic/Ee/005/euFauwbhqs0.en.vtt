00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:10.930 
get multiple early a lot of different
formation<00:01:09.350> sets<00:01:09.590> they<00:01:09.770> do<00:01:09.830> have<00:01:10.280> the<00:01:10.460> talent

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:10.940 
formation sets they do have the talent

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.480 
formation sets they do have the talent
to<00:01:11.060> make<00:01:11.330> these<00:01:11.780> type<00:01:12.140> of<00:01:12.170> changes<00:01:13.040> because

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
to make these type of changes because

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:14.770 
to make these type of changes because
they<00:01:13.610> have<00:01:13.759> a<00:01:13.790> lot<00:01:14.000> of<00:01:14.030> depth<00:01:14.330> at<00:01:14.450> running<00:01:14.750> back

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
they have a lot of depth at running back

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:15.940 
they have a lot of depth at running back
they<00:01:14.990> also<00:01:15.110> have<00:01:15.320> some<00:01:15.470> talented<00:01:15.770> wire

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950 
they also have some talented wire

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.859 
they also have some talented wire
receivers<00:01:16.340> and<00:01:16.490> they're<00:01:16.850> also<00:01:17.030> deep<00:01:17.420> at<00:01:17.630> tight

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
receivers and they're also deep at tight

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:19.840 
receivers and they're also deep at tight
end<00:01:17.899> so<00:01:18.410> the<00:01:18.530> Ravens<00:01:18.830> can't<00:01:19.070> get<00:01:19.220> multiple<00:01:19.700> and

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
end so the Ravens can't get multiple and

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.520 
end so the Ravens can't get multiple and
that's<00:01:20.000> how<00:01:20.090> you<00:01:20.149> confuse<00:01:20.570> the<00:01:20.600> defense<00:01:21.050> like
