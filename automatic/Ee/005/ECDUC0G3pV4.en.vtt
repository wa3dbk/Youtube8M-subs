00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:19.940
 the check point, and here's some 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.940
 more 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:44.379
 what is actually there the direction of travel 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:48.550
 drive because the billiards we have 

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:50.379
 I should give all together as a vessel 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:01:01.149
 profit sharing to pass the 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:01:01.809
 The best ones are not the way 

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:04.629
 block 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:07.110
 it would be ancestors at the bridge 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:07.110
 given 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:24.110
 The fans are on restrictions though 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.110
 she the flash player 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:32.600
 watch out because you have next one 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:38.560
 week to go to the next jump 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:38.560
 at least like it yourself 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:45.420
 the others are missing, but all but 8 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:53.210
 from the family to the west and 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.210
 anchor 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.710
 ok then it looks like 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.940
 Yes 

00:02:26.129 --> 00:03:24.930
 by your help 

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:50.879
 why do you always make me that 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.389
 chaff gets related to the train 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:58.410
 appeared 

00:03:55.389 --> 00:03:58.410
 I'll come back too 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:40.070
 thereby adding the position by find 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:44.260
 on the 8th 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:53.050
 therefore is very unhappy remains 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:53.050
 still not afraid of rain 

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:30.669
 I can do that when it's over 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:30.669
 no one has read
