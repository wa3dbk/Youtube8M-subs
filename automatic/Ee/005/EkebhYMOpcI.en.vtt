is<00:04:22.419> the<00:04:23.419> Jo

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
is the Jo

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:29.950 
is the Jo
notice<00:04:26.030> this<00:04:26.449> real<00:04:27.380> estate<00:04:27.830> right<00:04:28.070> here<00:04:28.960> it's

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:29.960 
notice this real estate right here it's

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:36.580 
notice this real estate right here it's
all<00:04:30.169> empty<00:04:31.960> over<00:04:32.960> here<00:04:35.050> there's<00:04:36.050> all<00:04:36.169> kinds<00:04:36.530> of

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
all empty over here there's all kinds of

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:44.230 
all empty over here there's all kinds of
stuff<00:04:36.919> on<00:04:37.130> the<00:04:37.669> freakish<00:04:40.810> see<00:04:42.760> more<00:04:43.760> stuff

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240 
stuff on the freakish see more stuff

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:50.260 
stuff on the freakish see more stuff
more<00:04:45.699> stuff<00:04:46.840> hmm<00:04:47.930> also<00:04:48.530> says<00:04:49.190> right<00:04:49.460> there<00:04:49.520> DC

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:50.270 
more stuff hmm also says right there DC

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:53.010 
more stuff hmm also says right there DC
jack<00:04:50.570> on<00:04:50.900> the<00:04:50.960> PCB<00:04:51.500> to<00:04:51.949> melt

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
jack on the PCB to melt

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:58.830 
jack on the PCB to melt
do<00:04:54.020> you<00:04:54.080> see<00:04:54.289> Jack<00:04:56.530> nothing

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 
do you see Jack nothing

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.300 
do you see Jack nothing
hmm<00:04:59.840> we're<00:05:00.440> going<00:05:00.620> to<00:05:00.710> have<00:05:00.830> to<00:05:00.919> investigate

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:01.310 
hmm we're going to have to investigate

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:06.430 
hmm we're going to have to investigate
further<00:05:03.490> mm-hmm<00:05:04.550> all<00:05:05.389> right<00:05:05.660> so<00:05:06.080> obviously

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:06.440 
further mm-hmm all right so obviously

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.790 
further mm-hmm all right so obviously
the<00:05:06.860> parts<00:05:07.280> come<00:05:07.699> from<00:05:08.060> the<00:05:08.240> same<00:05:08.449> Factory<00:05:09.020> we

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:09.800 
the parts come from the same Factory we

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.930 
the parts come from the same Factory we
can<00:05:09.979> leave<00:05:10.099> that<00:05:11.500> these<00:05:12.500> do<00:05:12.770> say<00:05:13.070> freakish<00:05:13.699> on

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:13.940 
can leave that these do say freakish on

00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:18.120 
can leave that these do say freakish on
the<00:05:14.120> PCB<00:05:15.370> and<00:05:16.370> this<00:05:16.610> of<00:05:16.880> course<00:05:16.909> says<00:05:17.389> joy<00:05:17.810> oh

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:18.130 
the PCB and this of course says joy oh

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:23.140 
the PCB and this of course says joy oh
they<00:05:19.130> are<00:05:19.190> populated<00:05:19.970> differently<00:05:21.970> they<00:05:22.970> use

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:23.150 
they are populated differently they use

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:26.830 
they are populated differently they use
the<00:05:23.330> same<00:05:23.570> chip<00:05:23.960> the<00:05:24.800> TLM<00:05:25.760> bla<00:05:26.150> bla<00:05:26.330> bla<00:05:26.389> blabla

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:26.840 
the same chip the TLM bla bla bla blabla

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:30.310 
the same chip the TLM bla bla bla blabla
bla<00:05:27.020> bla<00:05:27.289> chip<00:05:28.720> but<00:05:29.720> they're<00:05:29.900> not<00:05:30.050> the<00:05:30.289> same

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:30.320 
bla bla chip but they're not the same

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:34.089 
bla bla chip but they're not the same
circuit<00:05:31.310> so<00:05:31.810> maybe<00:05:32.810> I've<00:05:33.050> used<00:05:33.440> the<00:05:33.860> wrong

00:05:34.089 --> 00:05:34.099 
circuit so maybe I've used the wrong

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:36.969 
circuit so maybe I've used the wrong
Alpha<00:05:35.090> Drive<00:05:35.360> and<00:05:35.810> joy<00:05:36.560> Oh

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:36.979 
Alpha Drive and joy Oh

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:39.730 
Alpha Drive and joy Oh
to<00:05:37.099> begin<00:05:37.250> with<00:05:37.610> who<00:05:38.479> knows<00:05:39.110> I<00:05:39.139> thought<00:05:39.440> I<00:05:39.500> was

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:39.740 
to begin with who knows I thought I was

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:43.230 
to begin with who knows I thought I was
going<00:05:39.949> to<00:05:40.180> really<00:05:41.180> help<00:05:41.449> but<00:05:42.110> I've<00:05:42.349> probably

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:43.240 
going to really help but I've probably

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.480 
going to really help but I've probably
not<00:05:44.240> helped

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:45.490 
not helped

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:48.490 
not helped
hmm
