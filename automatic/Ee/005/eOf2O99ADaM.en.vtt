00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.400
 often pain 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.350
 then we take the money connector 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:45.980
 other end of the wires 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.980
 and for the price of slaves and culture 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.970
 she telescope connected aksai further 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:56.030
 we take 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:58.460
 militants got one including 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.070
 computer 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.070
 as they say 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.070
 we are the last 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.070
 turn on the sands itself 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.410
 no such show that the telescope 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.220
 we set ourselves the programs that 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:20.980
 we go 

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:22.830
 together with the disk 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.080
 and find 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.080
 such programs 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.830
 so-called 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.940
 he was fit 

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.090
 he he talks about licenses 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.820
 but license 2 will be on 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:44.690
 disks were written did not install 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.270
 to oil and market 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:47.410
 say no 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.410
 the fact that the path is analogous to what we are holding 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:54.340
 how to set data 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.480
 that is, these buttons 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.480
 see i click 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:01.810
 it turns out we press 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.810

 we already have it all with your mood 

00:02:15.419 --> 00:02:17.479
 cross and so will not be because we will 

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:19.649
 do the following 

00:02:19.649 --> 00:02:21.049
 percent 

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:22.579
 we go 

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:25.579
 My computer 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:28.379
 properties 

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:31.379
 equipment 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.459
 and see which cum tailors us 

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:38.329
 actively 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:39.959
 you should have such 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.959
 inscription 

00:02:44.419 --> 00:02:47.419
 the arbitrator saw bull pennies 

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:49.999
 we take 

00:02:49.999 --> 00:02:51.909
 this is just our profile 

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:54.909

00:02:55.809 --> 00:02:58.809
 Vladimir Shchukin

 that is, we remove suicide bombers 

00:03:06.649 --> 00:03:09.079
 a fruitful setting appears 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:12.079
 johnny depp 

00:03:14.149 --> 00:03:16.729
 here we just remove 

00:03:16.729 --> 00:03:19.729
 comp cries which nasa 

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:26.369
 telescope model 

00:03:26.369 --> 00:03:28.289
 one will automatically be accumulated here 

00:03:28.289 --> 00:03:30.069
 any port which will allow 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:33.069
 even small 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:35.699
 a poster appeared 

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:37.229
 we can control the telescope
