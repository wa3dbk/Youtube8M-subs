00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
very very simple the cool thing about

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.679 
very very simple the cool thing about
this<00:01:03.690> case<00:01:03.960> from<00:01:04.350> tech<00:01:04.619> 21<00:01:05.129> is<00:01:05.339> that<00:01:06.180> it<00:01:06.450> do

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
this case from tech 21 is that it do

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.050 
this case from tech 21 is that it do
come<00:01:07.080> with<00:01:07.530> this<00:01:07.770> orange<00:01:08.220> material<00:01:08.580> here

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
come with this orange material here

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.830 
come with this orange material here
which<00:01:10.020> you<00:01:10.170> can<00:01:10.380> see<00:01:10.610> which<00:01:11.610> is<00:01:12.030> a<00:01:12.270> material

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
which you can see which is a material

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.950 
which you can see which is a material
called<00:01:12.869> the<00:01:13.619> 30<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:15.299> basically<00:01:15.840> what<00:01:15.930> it

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
called the 30 and the basically what it

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.210 
called the 30 and the basically what it
does<00:01:16.049> is<00:01:16.560> that<00:01:16.979> when<00:01:17.460> you<00:01:18.170> have<00:01:19.170> your<00:01:19.740> device

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
does is that when you have your device

does is that when you have your device
in<00:01:20.610> this<00:01:21.210> case<00:01:21.270> and<00:01:21.930> you<00:01:22.500> would<00:01:22.740> drop<00:01:23.040> it<00:01:23.390> d

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
in this case and you would drop it d

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.380 
in this case and you would drop it d
said<00:01:24.810> this<00:01:25.080> d<00:01:25.320> third<00:01:25.619> material<00:01:26.390> would

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
said this d third material would

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:30.260 
said this d third material would
basically<00:01:27.810> absher<00:01:28.740> absorb<00:01:29.490> away<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:30.000> shock

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
basically absher absorb away the shock

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.109 
basically absher absorb away the shock
from<00:01:30.780> your<00:01:30.960> phone<00:01:31.259> so<00:01:32.040> should<00:01:32.790> provide<00:01:33.060> some

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
that this protects the hole full-size

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.649 
that this protects the hole full-size
here<00:01:43.710> on<00:01:43.920> the<00:01:44.070> phone<00:01:44.310> and<00:01:44.549> also<00:01:45.180> when<00:01:45.329> you<00:01:45.450> put

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
it down on the table you can see here

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.039 
it down on the table you can see here
the<00:01:49.079> screen<00:01:49.439> actually<00:01:49.829> doesn't<00:01:50.520> touch<00:01:51.060> the

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
the screen actually doesn't touch the

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.960 
the screen actually doesn't touch the
surface<00:01:52.290> because<00:01:52.920> this<00:01:53.159> one<00:01:53.340> points<00:01:53.759> out<00:01:53.909> a

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
surface because this one points out a

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.910 
surface because this one points out a
little<00:01:54.450> bit<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:54.930> it<00:01:55.380> doesn't<00:01:55.649> make<00:01:55.710> your

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
little bit and it doesn't make your

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.120 
little bit and it doesn't make your
phone<00:01:56.189> too<00:01:56.759> much<00:01:57.030> bigger<00:01:57.420> and<00:01:57.799> if<00:01:58.799> you<00:01:58.920> think

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
phone too much bigger and if you think

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.380 
phone too much bigger and if you think
about<00:01:59.250> how<00:01:59.549> much<00:01:59.670> more<00:01:59.880> protection<00:02:00.299> you're

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
about how much more protection you're

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.569 
about how much more protection you're
getting<00:02:00.750> it<00:02:00.960> is<00:02:01.409> pretty<00:02:01.770> nice<00:02:01.920> and<00:02:02.250> this<00:02:02.490> is

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
getting it is pretty nice and this is

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:03.950 
getting it is pretty nice and this is
actually<00:02:02.820> what<00:02:02.939> I'm<00:02:03.030> using<00:02:03.240> right<00:02:03.509> now<00:02:03.570> in
