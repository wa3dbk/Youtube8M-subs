00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
if you want to survive in this world you

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.670 
if you want to survive in this world you
need<00:00:19.890> to<00:00:19.950> evolve

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:23.680 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.170 

if<00:00:24.100> you<00:00:24.250> don't<00:00:24.400> push<00:00:24.580> the<00:00:24.730> limits<00:00:25.000> you'll

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:25.180 
if you don't push the limits you'll

this<00:00:52.520> car<00:00:52.760> is<00:00:52.940> night<00:00:53.300> and<00:00:53.330> day<00:00:53.600> so<00:00:53.660> I<00:00:53.960> can<00:00:54.140> push

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.320 
this car is night and day so I can push

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.860 
this car is night and day so I can push
this<00:00:54.470> car<00:00:54.710> harder<00:00:55.160> in<00:00:55.580> turns<00:00:56.000> coming<00:00:56.480> out<00:00:56.720> of

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:56.870 
this car harder in turns coming out of

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.190 
this car harder in turns coming out of
turns<00:00:57.110> it's<00:00:58.010> solid<00:00:58.640> the<00:00:59.150> aerodynamics<00:01:00.020> it

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:00.200 
turns it's solid the aerodynamics it

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.170 
turns it's solid the aerodynamics it
creates<00:01:00.890> so<00:01:01.070> much<00:01:01.220> more<00:01:01.400> downforce<00:01:01.880> in<00:01:02.090> the

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.180 
creates so much more downforce in the

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.570 
creates so much more downforce in the
other<00:01:02.300> car<00:01:02.620> obviously<00:01:03.620> some<00:01:04.100> of<00:01:04.130> the<00:01:04.280> cooling

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:04.580

build us a bomb shelter it's designed
even<00:01:09.950> if<00:01:10.130> the<00:01:10.220> head<00:01:10.340> gasket<00:01:10.790> lifts<00:01:11.150> it's<00:01:11.630> gonna

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
even if the head gasket lifts it's gonna

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.810 
even if the head gasket lifts it's gonna
stay<00:01:12.080> in<00:01:12.200> one<00:01:12.380> piece<00:01:12.620> because<00:01:12.950> it<00:01:13.070> was<00:01:13.220> the

stay in one piece because it was the

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.610 
stay in one piece because it was the
structure<00:01:14.300> of<00:01:14.420> how<00:01:14.570> it<00:01:14.630> was<00:01:14.810> made<00:01:15.080> was
