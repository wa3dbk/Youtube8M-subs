00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:06.779
 we spoke the text i say well no no well i 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.700
 went on a diet ducana 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:13.880
 I started using the Dacan diet 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:18.800
 1 month before the pony I cooked myself 

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:18.800
 I don't like chicken breast at all 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:29.210
 so for me it all says what it is 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:35.850
 day for those who love to cook i 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:38.040
 absolutely can not date you want 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.500
 sweets and i don't like changing i won't 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.570
 soothe the meat I love I think so and 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.530
 let's go not be very easy their footprint on 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.480
 this diet and when i start these 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.550
 Here are the first days of protein and so I think I 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.829
 just die because it turns out not 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:56.640
 I like meat I do not like meat in such quantity and 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.859
 I was badly dry and bored I am with a lot 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.750
 I just wanted to die sweet climbed 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.420
 walls and it turns out to be there 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:09.720
 partly like well that is this diet 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:12.030
 opened me to me that's what i am 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.049
 start replacing meat with vegetables more 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.040
 cottage cheese 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:19.500
 but somehow throwing nonetheless was 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.670
 ok because i used to 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:27.350
 Spartan conditions 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:30.600
 but in a month I'll try the chicken in and 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.820
 coriander you dressing thought why 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.369
 wouldn't try where it could too 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.799
 to be tasty and so I sat down on this 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:40.409
 diet can after some time she 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.990
 probably experienced the same feelings that I had 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:47.040
 there is a dry breast is not very good 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:49.740
 really want sweet and anya start 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.920
 use recipes and decided to make 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.630
 first time cottage cheese casserole when I 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.079
 I tried to think that everything was altogether 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.350
 Fortunately there is no limit at the limits of happiness 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.630
 not 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.310
 or as they say, I donâ€™t know 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.290
 I have a dessert in my life 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.290
 finally came sweet after two 

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:09.840
 of the month I experienced this happiness again 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.910
 and start cooking my friends in me 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.880
 all our apartments were cooking curd 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:17.610
 casserole 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:20.100
 well we leave from this generally brave 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:25.380
 remove casseroles because they are successful 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:27.930
 your stomach turned away 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:30.780
 and I cooked the ventricles I learned that except 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.790
 grandfathers have more stomachs sweat 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:36.569
 I also managed a liver I learned that there is 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:39.540
 more liver and then he still made gelatin 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:41.280
 from coca-cola light then how I ate 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.739
 Immediately all but in general no longer 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:46.560
 but we all well done and yet they 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:48.630
 I make mayonnaise I ate it right there too 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.840
 whole at all with its dry breast it 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:54.690
 it was beautiful what else they recently 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.130
 cooked mean cabbage to 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.900
 This cabbage thought that I had better 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.120
 all it turns out but after wood 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.010
 now terrible here and here I tried 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:07.769
 manual oh my god yes it is not a diet at all 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:10.100
 And happiness thanks not I understood that else 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:12.870
 once realized that I do not know how to cook 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:14.319
 work realized that life can be 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:19.989
 beautiful even 

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:22.629
 dieting shorter everything so dear 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:26.549
 my listeners are more likely not mine by us 

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:29.709
 readers who are there necessarily 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:31.870
 read her blog because it's not easy 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:35.159
 kayan as a pillow not as a neighbor 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:41.200
 I speak as a man who walked and 

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:44.069
 cash on personal experience and come on 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:49.500

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:49.500
