00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:13.850
 hello very good guys and girls 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:16.010
 mundialitos in this video I love you 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:17.720
 teach where we will be able to find the 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:20.360
 secret passage to ride it 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.790
 enhancer or for able 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.710
 I have decided to occupy the 

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:27.170
 two when you put four is 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:30.080
 completely normal, what can you do? 

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:32.960
 is going to go somewhere else to the other and 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:35.030
 you are going to be able to do it the key is that 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:38.800
 the upgrader is in a catwalk 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.800
 secret hidden in the bank 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.270
 and another of the classmates have to go to 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.100
 the power plant to put a turbine 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:49.320
 so that this secret passage opens 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.120
 As you can see there I am taking the bank 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.160
 you know how the door always opens 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.720
 armored with a grenade on the right 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.980
 there is another door exactly like the 

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:59.930
 first card and opens us with another grenade 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.610
 there you see how my partner is already in 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.460
 the centrals and it just gave light 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:06.710
 and here on the right there is a wall with a 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.600
 lightning symbol 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.820
 Well, this is where the 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.840
 secret passage to be able to mount the 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.640
 better adore 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.520
 my partner who in turn is in the 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:19.310
 power station opens the door of the 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:22.009
 Central and nothing to jump into the past 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.420
 hallway is turned around and there is a wall 

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:26.240
 that has exactly the same symbol 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:29.240
 that as you can see we are going to 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:32.110
 launching the turbine opens at the same time in the 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.110
 secret passageway door 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:43.670
 and it's opening and we're going to go down for some 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.680
 stairs that lead to a very 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.899
 similar to the street in the central 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.899
 electrical and here we will be able to find 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:53.790
 the parts to assemble the upgrader if 

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:55.830
 we go to the end of the hall 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:59.040
 we can see where the table of 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:01.320
 assembly and here on the left is going to 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.610
 appear patch plate good then 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.610
 let's go for one of the pieces 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.910
 one of them we find here that is 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.080
 a battery can be does not have to 

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.120
 being always in the same place can 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.290
 be in different places in this case 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:22.440
 is here but they are always in the 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:24.750
 pieces we put going for the second 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.410
 piece that you see that is the head of the 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.410
 inhabitant 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:33.750
 and they are like the feet of the best adores 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:39.489
 which is a board with a cement beam 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:42.250
 we place it and we have on the left the 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:43.510
 improved now very important list for 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.400
 that can work and we can improve 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:49.800
 the guns have to be light 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.800
 ignited that go to put the turbine 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.490
 when there is a person inside if you 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.400
 you go out and nobody is left and the 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:03.870
 turbine the passageway has been removed 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.240
 close and well this is all guys 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.690
 I hope you liked it a lot 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:08.690
 very big
