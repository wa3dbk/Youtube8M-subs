over in the timeline track you'll see
your<00:00:48.430> keyframes<00:00:50.340> so<00:00:51.340> now<00:00:51.520> you<00:00:51.579> have<00:00:51.820> your

00:00:51.959 --> 00:00:51.969 
your keyframes so now you have your

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:53.790 
your keyframes so now you have your
motion<00:00:52.420> baked<00:00:52.660> so<00:00:52.989> the<00:00:53.110> next<00:00:53.320> step<00:00:53.530> is<00:00:53.680> to

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:53.800 
motion baked so the next step is to

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.670 
motion baked so the next step is to
export<00:00:54.219> it<00:00:54.309> into<00:00:54.430> vvh<00:00:54.940> format<00:00:55.410> to<00:00:56.410> do<00:00:56.530> this

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:56.680 
export it into vvh format to do this

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.189 
export it into vvh format to do this
just<00:00:57.039> go<00:00:57.160> up<00:00:57.250> to<00:00:57.309> file<00:00:57.700> export<00:00:58.090> and<00:00:58.780> then

00:00:59.189 --> 00:00:59.199 
just go up to file export and then

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:01.170 
just go up to file export and then
choose<00:00:59.440> the<00:00:59.590> bvh<00:01:00.039> format<00:01:00.520> and<00:01:00.730> enter<00:01:00.940> in<00:01:01.059> your

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:01.180 
choose the bvh format and enter in your

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.410 
choose the bvh format and enter in your
motion<00:01:01.360> name<00:01:01.780> and<00:01:02.050> press<00:01:02.710> save<00:01:03.269> you<00:01:04.269> can

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.420 
motion name and press save you can

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:05.879 
motion name and press save you can
change<00:01:04.659> your<00:01:04.749> exporter<00:01:05.199> options<00:01:05.590> if<00:01:05.740> you<00:01:05.859> want

00:01:05.879 --> 00:01:05.889 
change your exporter options if you want

00:01:05.889 --> 00:01:09.019 
change your exporter options if you want
but<00:01:06.729> I'll<00:01:06.969> just<00:01:06.999> keep<00:01:07.329> mine<00:01:07.539> at<00:01:07.569> default

00:01:09.019 --> 00:01:09.029 
but I'll just keep mine at default

00:01:09.029 --> 00:01:11.429 
but I'll just keep mine at default
because<00:01:10.029> you<00:01:10.329> can<00:01:10.479> import<00:01:10.779> multiple<00:01:11.020> motions

00:01:11.429 --> 00:01:11.439 
because you can import multiple motions

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:14.190 
because you can import multiple motions
at<00:01:11.770> a<00:01:11.799> time<00:01:12.069> into<00:01:12.399> 3d<00:01:12.700> exchange<00:01:13.090> 5<00:01:13.389> I'm<00:01:13.990> also

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
at a time into 3d exchange 5 I'm also

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.539 
at a time into 3d exchange 5 I'm also
going<00:01:14.469> to<00:01:14.560> bring<00:01:14.770> in<00:01:14.950> a<00:01:15.039> couple<00:01:15.340> of<00:01:15.429> other

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:15.549 
going to bring in a couple of other

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:16.679 
going to bring in a couple of other
motions<00:01:16.029> as<00:01:16.209> well

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:16.689 
motions as well

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:19.169 
motions as well
it's<00:01:17.469> a<00:01:17.560> bit<00:01:17.709> faster<00:01:18.159> to<00:01:18.310> convert<00:01:18.670> and<00:01:18.819> import

00:01:19.169 --> 00:01:19.179 
it's a bit faster to convert and import

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:21.330 
it's a bit faster to convert and import
your<00:01:19.270> motions<00:01:19.719> as<00:01:19.899> a<00:01:19.929> group<00:01:20.259> instead<00:01:20.950> of<00:01:21.069> going

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340 
your motions as a group instead of going

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.120 
your motions as a group instead of going
back<00:01:21.579> and<00:01:21.609> forth<00:01:21.849> one<00:01:22.389> at<00:01:22.539> a<00:01:22.599> time<00:01:22.950> the<00:01:23.950> most

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:24.130 
back and forth one at a time the most

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:25.949 
back and forth one at a time the most
important<00:01:24.579> step<00:01:24.729> in<00:01:24.880> dies<00:01:25.090> is<00:01:25.359> to<00:01:25.479> export<00:01:25.810> your

00:01:25.949 --> 00:01:25.959 
important step in dies is to export your

00:01:25.959 --> 00:01:29.399 
important step in dies is to export your
characters<00:01:26.439> T<00:01:26.649> pose<00:01:26.889> as<00:01:27.130> a<00:01:27.159> BBH<00:01:27.670> as<00:01:27.909> well<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:29.229> T

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:29.409 
characters T pose as a BBH as well the T

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:31.199 
characters T pose as a BBH as well the T
pose<00:01:29.649> is<00:01:29.829> the<00:01:29.919> default<00:01:30.310> position<00:01:30.759> for<00:01:30.789> rigging

00:01:31.199 --> 00:01:31.209 
pose is the default position for rigging

00:01:31.209 --> 00:01:33.449 
pose is the default position for rigging
in<00:01:31.329> 3d<00:01:31.599> exchange<00:01:32.109> and<00:01:32.409> helps<00:01:33.069> to<00:01:33.159> provide<00:01:33.399> a

reference for all the other motions just

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:38.129 
reference for all the other motions just
export<00:01:36.969> this<00:01:37.090> the<00:01:37.329> same<00:01:37.509> way<00:01:37.659> you<00:01:37.719> did<00:01:37.990> the

00:01:38.129 --> 00:01:38.139 
export this the same way you did the

00:01:38.139 --> 00:01:40.709 
export this the same way you did the
other<00:01:38.169> motions<00:01:38.740> now<00:01:39.549> open<00:01:39.849> up<00:01:39.909> 3d<00:01:40.240> exchange

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:40.719 
other motions now open up 3d exchange

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:42.209 
other motions now open up 3d exchange
and<00:01:40.959> the<00:01:41.079> first<00:01:41.289> thing<00:01:41.469> you<00:01:41.529> want<00:01:41.740> to<00:01:41.770> do<00:01:41.950> here

00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:42.219 
and the first thing you want to do here

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:47.940 
and the first thing you want to do here
is<00:01:42.249> import<00:01:42.789> in<00:01:42.939> your<00:01:43.060> T<00:01:43.270> pose<00:01:43.479> motion<00:01:46.950> once

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
is import in your T pose motion once

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.559 
is import in your T pose motion once
you've<00:01:48.130> done<00:01:48.310> that<00:01:48.489> you<00:01:48.700> can<00:01:48.729> select<00:01:48.999> import

00:01:49.559 --> 00:01:49.569 
you've done that you can select import

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:51.419 
you've done that you can select import
and<00:01:49.689> then<00:01:50.259> bring<00:01:50.469> in<00:01:50.590> all<00:01:50.739> your<00:01:50.770> other<00:01:51.009> motions

00:01:51.419 --> 00:01:51.429 
and then bring in all your other motions

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:55.180 
and then bring in all your other motions
as<00:01:51.549> well

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.190 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.070 

you'll<00:01:55.850> see<00:01:56.030> that<00:01:56.120> all<00:01:56.300> of<00:01:56.330> your<00:01:56.480> motions<00:01:56.900> will

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.080 
you'll see that all of your motions will
