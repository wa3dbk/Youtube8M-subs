Regional Clinic and I'm going to talk to
you<00:00:05.400> about<00:00:05.490> how<00:00:05.790> to<00:00:05.819> determine<00:00:06.180> your

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
you about how to determine your

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.390 
you about how to determine your
percentage<00:00:07.140> of<00:00:07.290> body<00:00:07.470> fat<00:00:07.620> there<00:00:08.340> are

percentage of body fat there are

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.220 
percentage of body fat there are
actually<00:00:08.670> several<00:00:08.910> different<00:00:09.090> methods<00:00:09.510> to<00:00:09.960> do

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
actually several different methods to do

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.530 
actually several different methods to do
this<00:00:10.429> what<00:00:11.429> used<00:00:11.639> to<00:00:11.759> be<00:00:11.820> thought<00:00:12.150> of<00:00:12.179> as<00:00:12.509> the

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
this what used to be thought of as the

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.570 
this what used to be thought of as the
gold<00:00:12.900> standard<00:00:13.440> was<00:00:13.590> underwater<00:00:14.160> wing

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
gold standard was underwater wing

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.689 
gold standard was underwater wing
however<00:00:15.480> this<00:00:15.809> is<00:00:15.960> a<00:00:15.990> very<00:00:16.109> difficult<00:00:17.039> way<00:00:17.640> to

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
however this is a very difficult way to

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.540 
however this is a very difficult way to
actually<00:00:18.090> measure<00:00:18.390> your<00:00:18.600> body<00:00:18.779> fat<00:00:19.550> typically

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
actually measure your body fat typically

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.640 
actually measure your body fat typically
what<00:00:20.730> has<00:00:20.880> been<00:00:21.029> done<00:00:21.270> is<00:00:21.750> the<00:00:22.050> person<00:00:22.470> is

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
what has been done is the person is

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.679 
what has been done is the person is
submerged<00:00:23.160> in<00:00:23.460> a<00:00:23.550> tank<00:00:23.789> of<00:00:23.910> water<00:00:23.970> they<00:00:24.539> have

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
submerged in a tank of water they have

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.349 
submerged in a tank of water they have
to<00:00:24.840> blow<00:00:25.109> out<00:00:25.320> all<00:00:25.740> of<00:00:25.800> their<00:00:26.250> air<00:00:26.430> as<00:00:26.789> much<00:00:27.090> air

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
to blow out all of their air as much air

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.929 
to blow out all of their air as much air
as<00:00:27.510> they<00:00:27.630> possibly<00:00:28.109> can<00:00:28.500> and<00:00:28.830> their<00:00:29.760> weight

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
as they possibly can and their weight

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.240 
as they possibly can and their weight
was<00:00:30.150> taken<00:00:30.510> before<00:00:30.660> they<00:00:31.349> were<00:00:31.410> submerged<00:00:31.949> and

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
was taken before they were submerged and

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.860 
was taken before they were submerged and
their<00:00:32.340> weight<00:00:32.489> is<00:00:32.610> taken<00:00:32.790> as<00:00:33.180> their<00:00:33.510> in<00:00:33.660> their

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
their weight is taken as their in their

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.690 
their weight is taken as their in their
a<00:00:34.140> calculation<00:00:34.800> is<00:00:35.070> done<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.520> actually

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
a calculation is done to actually

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.810 
a calculation is done to actually
determine<00:00:36.360> their<00:00:36.570> percentage<00:00:37.110> of<00:00:37.230> body<00:00:37.380> fat

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:37.820 
determine their percentage of body fat

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.459 
determine their percentage of body fat
another<00:00:38.820> method<00:00:39.270> that's<00:00:39.300> a<00:00:39.540> lot<00:00:39.750> more<00:00:40.079> common

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
another method that's a lot more common

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.250 
another method that's a lot more common
is<00:00:40.890> to<00:00:41.129> use<00:00:41.340> skin<00:00:41.730> calipers<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.329> this<00:00:42.989> can<00:00:43.170> be

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
is to use skin calipers and this can be

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.170 
is to use skin calipers and this can be
fairly<00:00:43.500> accurate<00:00:43.620> if<00:00:44.190> you<00:00:44.340> have<00:00:44.579> a<00:00:44.879> good

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
fairly accurate if you have a good

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.029 
fairly accurate if you have a good
handle<00:00:45.690> or<00:00:45.840> if<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.050> person<00:00:46.469> is<00:00:46.590> very<00:00:46.649> well

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
basically doing a scan of your entire

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.749 
basically doing a scan of your entire
body<00:01:48.869> and<00:01:49.110> it<00:01:49.710> looks<00:01:50.009> like<00:01:50.220> this<00:01:50.369> is<00:01:50.549> going<00:01:50.700> to

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
body and it looks like this is going to

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.539 
body and it looks like this is going to
become<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.119> new<00:01:51.390> gold<00:01:51.689> standard<00:01:51.780> you

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:52.549 
become the new gold standard you

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:55.280 
become the new gold standard you
actually<00:01:53.549> get<00:01:53.729> a<00:01:53.759> view<00:01:54.119> of<00:01:54.180> your<00:01:54.600> entire<00:01:54.930> body

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
actually get a view of your entire body

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.920 
actually get a view of your entire body
you<00:01:55.649> can<00:01:55.829> see<00:01:56.130> your<00:01:56.640> skeletal<00:01:57.180> system<00:01:57.210> you<00:01:57.780> can

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
you can see your skeletal system you can

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.840 
you can see your skeletal system you can
see<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.290> actual<00:01:58.740> muscle<00:01:58.979> mass<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.549> then<00:01:59.759> you

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
see the actual muscle mass and then you

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.340 
see the actual muscle mass and then you
can<00:02:00.030> see<00:02:00.180> the<00:02:00.329> lighter<00:02:00.540> parts<00:02:00.930> that<00:02:01.079> are<00:02:01.200> the

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
can see the lighter parts that are the

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.380 
can see the lighter parts that are the
fat<00:02:01.590> mass<00:02:01.829> so<00:02:02.520> again<00:02:02.790> this<00:02:02.909> is<00:02:03.060> actually

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
fat mass so again this is actually

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.789 
fat mass so again this is actually
becoming<00:02:03.659> the<00:02:03.869> new<00:02:04.049> gold<00:02:04.290> standard<00:02:04.350> in<00:02:04.740> the

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
becoming the new gold standard in the

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.800 
becoming the new gold standard in the
most<00:02:05.009> accurate<00:02:05.250> way<00:02:05.729> of<00:02:06.000> determining<00:02:06.450> your

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
most accurate way of determining your

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.919 
most accurate way of determining your
body<00:02:07.110> fat<00:02:07.350> there's<00:02:08.310> a<00:02:08.399> couple<00:02:08.700> of<00:02:08.940> estimations

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
body fat there's a couple of estimations

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.059 
body fat there's a couple of estimations
that<00:02:10.080> you<00:02:10.200> could<00:02:10.349> also<00:02:10.530> use<00:02:10.890> online

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
that you could also use online

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:14.459 
that you could also use online
something<00:02:12.579> called<00:02:12.819> the<00:02:13.390> Navy<00:02:13.659> circumference

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:14.469 
something called the Navy circumference

00:02:14.469 --> 00:02:16.679 
something called the Navy circumference
method<00:02:14.980> this<00:02:15.189> is<00:02:15.400> using<00:02:15.610> a<00:02:15.790> tape<00:02:16.060> measure<00:02:16.090> you

00:02:16.679 --> 00:02:16.689 
method this is using a tape measure you

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:20.220 
method this is using a tape measure you
measure<00:02:17.620> in<00:02:18.370> men<00:02:18.670> their<00:02:19.000> abdomen<00:02:19.659> in<00:02:19.870> women

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
measure in men their abdomen in women

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.530 
measure in men their abdomen in women
it's<00:02:20.409> their<00:02:20.650> waist<00:02:20.890> and<00:02:21.099> hips<00:02:21.400> both<00:02:22.120> genders

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:22.540 
it's their waist and hips both genders

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.289 
it's their waist and hips both genders
also<00:02:22.840> measure<00:02:23.049> their<00:02:23.319> neck<00:02:23.590> and<00:02:23.920> you<00:02:24.730> enter<00:02:25.150> it

00:02:25.289 --> 00:02:25.299 
also measure their neck and you enter it

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:28.710 
also measure their neck and you enter it
into<00:02:25.540> their<00:02:26.170> actual<00:02:26.650> website<00:02:27.640> you<00:02:28.209> also<00:02:28.239> put

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:28.720 
into their actual website you also put

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.300 
into their actual website you also put
in<00:02:28.870> your<00:02:29.079> age<00:02:29.319> and<00:02:29.739> then<00:02:29.980> the<00:02:30.129> website

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
in your age and then the website

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.580 
in your age and then the website
actually<00:02:30.819> gives<00:02:31.090> you<00:02:31.299> an<00:02:31.540> approximation<00:02:32.260> of

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590 
actually gives you an approximation of

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.190 
actually gives you an approximation of
your<00:02:32.650> body<00:02:33.069> fat<00:02:33.430> and<00:02:33.790> then<00:02:34.390> another<00:02:34.810> website

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
your body fat and then another website

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.670 
your body fat and then another website
does<00:02:35.620> a<00:02:35.650> similar<00:02:35.980> thing<00:02:36.129> however<00:02:36.879> besides

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
does a similar thing however besides

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.099 
does a similar thing however besides
using<00:02:38.680> your<00:02:39.069> waist<00:02:39.639> and<00:02:40.000> hips<00:02:40.269> they<00:02:40.480> also<00:02:40.689> use

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:41.109 
using your waist and hips they also use

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:43.770 
using your waist and hips they also use
your<00:02:41.859> calf<00:02:42.189> and<00:02:42.549> they<00:02:42.879> do<00:02:42.939> not<00:02:43.150> use<00:02:43.420> your<00:02:43.450> neck

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
your calf and they do not use your neck

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:45.960 
your calf and they do not use your neck
again<00:02:44.470> those<00:02:44.650> are<00:02:44.799> approximations<00:02:45.400> just

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
again those are approximations just

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:47.520 
again those are approximations just
based<00:02:46.239> on<00:02:46.450> your<00:02:46.599> weight<00:02:46.870> your<00:02:47.079> gender<00:02:47.349> your

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
based on your weight your gender your

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.250 
based on your weight your gender your
age<00:02:47.769> and<00:02:48.159> take<00:02:48.489> measurements<00:02:48.970> but<00:02:49.840> a<00:02:49.900> few

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
age and take measurements but a few

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.020 
age and take measurements but a few
different<00:02:50.590> methods<00:02:50.620> for<00:02:51.159> determining<00:02:51.669> your

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.030 
different methods for determining your

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.569
