see that so you want to put it inside
out<00:01:39.330> of<00:01:39.960> course<00:01:40.260> I<00:01:40.410> decided<00:01:40.620> to<00:01:41.100> do<00:01:41.700> the

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
out of course I decided to do the

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.490 
out of course I decided to do the
thinnest<00:01:42.300> thing<00:01:42.450> possible<00:01:42.930> so<00:01:43.140> it's<00:01:43.290> really

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
thinnest thing possible so it's really

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:49.700 
thinnest thing possible so it's really
annoying<00:01:43.800> now<00:01:48.080> and<00:01:49.080> I<00:01:49.170> should<00:01:49.440> show<00:01:49.680> that

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
annoying now and I should show that

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.490 
annoying now and I should show that
there's<00:01:50.310> nothing<00:01:50.490> there<00:01:50.850> if<00:01:51.810> it<00:01:52.050> does<00:01:52.260> for

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
there's nothing there if it does for

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.020 
there's nothing there if it does for
whatever<00:01:52.680> reason<00:01:53.900> you<00:01:54.900> want<00:01:54.930> to<00:01:55.170> brush<00:01:55.410> it<00:01:55.590> out

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
whatever reason you want to brush it out

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.190 
whatever reason you want to brush it out
but<00:01:57.030> there's<00:01:57.240> no<00:01:57.420> reason<00:01:57.720> why<00:01:57.840> it<00:01:57.900> should

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
but there's no reason why it should

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.560 
but there's no reason why it should
because<00:01:59.010> you've<00:01:59.310> already<00:01:59.550> put<00:02:00.060> all<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.390> fur

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
because you've already put all the fur

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.600 
because you've already put all the fur
on<00:02:00.690> the<00:02:00.810> on<00:02:01.080> the<00:02:01.320> inside<00:02:01.680> when<00:02:01.920> you<00:02:02.040> pinned<00:02:02.490> it

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
on the on the inside when you pinned it

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.210 
on the on the inside when you pinned it
down<00:02:02.640> before<00:02:03.600> you<00:02:03.690> stitched<00:02:03.900> it<00:02:04.110> so<00:02:05.070> that's

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:05.220 
down before you stitched it so that's

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:07.850 
down before you stitched it so that's
how<00:02:05.340> you<00:02:05.400> suffer
