00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
there I just did right before I got

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.069 
there I just did right before I got
steamrolled<00:03:26.819> I<00:03:26.970> did<00:03:27.090> his<00:03:27.209> dive<00:03:27.510> kick<00:03:27.840> which<00:03:28.049> is

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:28.079 
steamrolled I did his dive kick which is

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:29.629 
steamrolled I did his dive kick which is
like<00:03:28.349> the<00:03:28.530> bread<00:03:28.799> and<00:03:28.919> butter<00:03:29.129> of<00:03:29.220> his<00:03:29.430> game

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:29.639 
like the bread and butter of his game

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:32.270 
like the bread and butter of his game
you<00:03:29.909> can<00:03:30.150> dive<00:03:30.359> kick<00:03:30.599> in<00:03:30.810> it<00:03:31.319> comes<00:03:31.799> out<00:03:31.979> quick

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
you can dive kick in it comes out quick

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.069 
you can dive kick in it comes out quick
he<00:03:32.459> can<00:03:32.549> use<00:03:32.699> a<00:03:32.729> really<00:03:33.180> close<00:03:33.419> range<00:03:33.720> to<00:03:33.900> put<00:03:34.049> a

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.079 
he can use a really close range to put a

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:35.719 
he can use a really close range to put a
lot<00:03:34.260> of<00:03:34.349> pressure<00:03:34.500> on<00:03:34.709> players<00:03:35.010> and<00:03:35.220> he<00:03:35.549> can

00:03:35.719 --> 00:03:35.729 
lot of pressure on players and he can

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:37.699 
lot of pressure on players and he can
combo<00:03:36.060> out<00:03:36.209> of<00:03:36.359> it<00:03:36.510> really<00:03:36.900> quickly<00:03:37.079> really

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
combo out of it really quickly really

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.289 
combo out of it really quickly really
easily<00:03:38.040> into<00:03:38.190> a<00:03:38.310> lot<00:03:38.489> of<00:03:38.519> different<00:03:38.760> cool<00:03:39.090> and

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
easily into a lot of different cool and

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:40.879 
easily into a lot of different cool and
that<00:03:39.359> seems<00:03:39.599> like<00:03:39.659> it<00:03:39.810> plays<00:03:40.049> more<00:03:40.290> into<00:03:40.590> the

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:40.889 
that seems like it plays more into the

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:42.439 
that seems like it plays more into the
the<00:03:41.190> rebalance<00:03:41.819> you<00:03:41.940> were<00:03:42.030> talking<00:03:42.359> about

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:42.449 
the rebalance you were talking about

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:44.089 
the rebalance you were talking about
that<00:03:42.720> it's<00:03:42.840> better<00:03:43.139> for<00:03:43.409> rush<00:03:43.590> down<00:03:43.799> fighters

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:44.099 
that it's better for rush down fighters

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:46.670 
that it's better for rush down fighters
yes<00:03:44.280> better<00:03:44.729> for<00:03:44.940> us<00:03:45.060> down<00:03:45.299> another<00:03:45.629> thing<00:03:45.989> so

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
yes better for us down another thing so

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.740 
yes better for us down another thing so
like<00:03:46.979> I<00:03:47.099> was<00:03:47.190> saying<00:03:47.250> how<00:03:47.609> it's<00:03:47.790> a<00:03:47.970> little<00:03:48.569> more

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
like I was saying how it's a little more

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.259 
like I was saying how it's a little more
rebalance<00:03:49.229> progressed<00:03:49.650> down<00:03:50.000> unioning<00:03:51.030> in

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
rebalance progressed down unioning in

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:52.759 
rebalance progressed down unioning in
particularly<00:03:51.780> they<00:03:51.870> have<00:03:51.959> a<00:03:52.019> lot<00:03:52.199> of<00:03:52.229> options

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
particularly they have a lot of options

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:54.979 
particularly they have a lot of options
for<00:03:52.859> getting<00:03:53.310> through<00:03:53.720> projectiles<00:03:54.720> and

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
for getting through projectiles and

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:56.539 
for getting through projectiles and
fireballs<00:03:55.440> like<00:03:55.590> I've<00:03:55.709> got<00:03:55.859> this<00:03:55.979> push<00:03:56.310> here

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
fireballs like I've got this push here

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:59.479 
fireballs like I've got this push here

let him do this boom that push I can use
that<00:04:01.979> to<00:04:02.280> actually<00:04:02.310> just<00:04:02.790> push<00:04:03.239> fireballs<00:04:03.720> out

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 
that to actually just push fireballs out

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.839 
that to actually just push fireballs out
of<00:04:04.019> the<00:04:04.079> position<00:04:04.409> so<00:04:04.769> fireball<00:04:05.370> if<00:04:05.489> I<00:04:05.579> time<00:04:05.819> it

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:05.849 
of the position so fireball if I time it

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:07.670 
of the position so fireball if I time it
right<00:04:06.120> and<00:04:06.180> a<00:04:06.389> fireballs<00:04:06.780> out<00:04:06.900> to<00:04:07.109> me<00:04:07.229> I<00:04:07.409> can

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
right and a fireballs out to me I can

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.710 
right and a fireballs out to me I can
just<00:04:07.859> give<00:04:08.069> it<00:04:08.189> the<00:04:08.220> hand<00:04:08.519> shut<00:04:09.419> it<00:04:09.569> down
