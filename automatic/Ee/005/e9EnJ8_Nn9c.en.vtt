have an Excalibur a rank 30 now the rank

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.240 
have an Excalibur a rank 30 now the rank
is<00:00:30.330> how<00:00:30.599> many<00:00:30.810> points<00:00:31.109> of<00:00:31.349> mods<00:00:31.590> you<00:00:31.859> can<00:00:32.040> have

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250 
is how many points of mods you can have

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.910 
is how many points of mods you can have
so<00:00:32.640> let's<00:00:32.820> take<00:00:32.940> a<00:00:33.000> look<00:00:33.239> as<00:00:33.840> you<00:00:34.590> can<00:00:34.710> see<00:00:34.890> I

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.500 
have a full set of mods I've got a bunch
of<00:00:36.570> cards<00:00:36.870> got<00:00:37.829> a<00:00:37.860> bunch<00:00:38.100> up<00:00:38.280> here<00:00:38.670> now<00:00:39.450> the

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
of cards got a bunch up here now the

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.030 
of cards got a bunch up here now the
first<00:00:39.930> thing<00:00:40.079> you're<00:00:40.290> going<00:00:40.410> to<00:00:40.469> notice<00:00:40.680> is

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
first thing you're going to notice is

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.130 
first thing you're going to notice is
that<00:00:41.070> they'll<00:00:41.340> have<00:00:41.520> a<00:00:41.550> numeric<00:00:42.090> value<00:00:42.450> the

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
that they'll have a numeric value the

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.220 
that they'll have a numeric value the
numeric<00:00:43.590> value<00:00:44.040> is<00:00:44.340> how<00:00:44.910> many<00:00:45.149> you<00:00:45.360> can<00:00:45.570> put<00:00:45.870> on

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
numeric value is how many you can put on

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.830 
numeric value is how many you can put on
that<00:00:46.920> basically<00:00:47.550> goes<00:00:48.000> by<00:00:48.180> your<00:00:48.360> wank<00:00:48.570> so<00:00:48.750> if

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
that basically goes by your wank so if

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.569 
that basically goes by your wank so if
you're<00:00:48.930> ranked<00:00:49.110> 30<00:00:49.379> you<00:00:49.950> would<00:00:50.100> have<00:00:50.250> 30

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
you're ranked 30 you would have 30

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.939 
you're ranked 30 you would have 30
points<00:00:51.059> if<00:00:51.180> you<00:00:51.780> have<00:00:51.989> your<00:00:52.199> warframe<00:00:52.680> aura

first things that you're going to get
our<00:00:58.859> four<00:00:59.160> cards<00:00:59.579> you're<00:00:59.760> going<00:00:59.910> to<00:00:59.969> get<00:01:00.090> four

cards<00:01:00.809> which<00:01:01.109> are<00:01:01.230> ability<00:01:01.710> cards<00:01:02.070> if<00:01:02.250> you

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
cards which are ability cards if you

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.920 
cards which are ability cards if you
look<00:01:02.520> in<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.730> top<00:01:02.910> right<00:01:03.180> corner<00:01:03.420> you<00:01:03.660> see<00:01:03.780> the

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
look in the top right corner you see the

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.380 
look in the top right corner you see the
two<00:01:04.110> blue<00:01:04.470> dashes<00:01:05.040> that<00:01:05.850> means<00:01:06.060> it's<00:01:06.270> an

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
two blue dashes that means it's an

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.109 
two blue dashes that means it's an
ability<00:01:06.720> that<00:01:06.990> this<00:01:07.380> warframe<00:01:07.920> can<00:01:08.159> use<00:01:08.430> so

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
ability that this warframe can use so

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.330 
ability that this warframe can use so
these<00:01:09.479> cards<00:01:09.930> usually<00:01:10.290> come<00:01:10.530> standard<00:01:11.280> with

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
these cards usually come standard with

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.190 
these cards usually come standard with
the<00:01:11.760> warframe<00:01:12.150> itself<00:01:12.540> they're<00:01:12.720> not<00:01:12.869> ones<00:01:13.049> you

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
the warframe itself they're not ones you

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.539 
the warframe itself they're not ones you
have<00:01:13.320> to<00:01:13.439> find<00:01:15.049> every<00:01:16.049> warframe<00:01:16.530> is<00:01:16.710> going<00:01:17.430> to

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
have to find every warframe is going to

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.570 
have to find every warframe is going to
have<00:01:17.790> four<00:01:18.720> of<00:01:18.750> these<00:01:19.200> double<00:01:19.590> dash<00:01:19.799> slots<00:01:20.220> and

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
have four of these double dash slots and

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.820 
have four of these double dash slots and
the<00:01:21.240> reason<00:01:21.600> is<00:01:21.780> so<00:01:21.990> that<00:01:22.020> you<00:01:22.170> can<00:01:22.439> equip

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
the reason is so that you can equip

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.580 
the reason is so that you can equip
these<00:01:23.159> now<00:01:23.880> what<00:01:24.330> it<00:01:24.450> does<00:01:24.659> is<00:01:24.930> if<00:01:25.110> you<00:01:25.259> match

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
these now what it does is if you match

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.410 
these now what it does is if you match
up<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.950> symbols<00:01:26.549> let<00:01:26.729> me<00:01:26.820> take<00:01:27.000> couple<00:01:27.270> off

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
up the symbols let me take couple off

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.340 
up the symbols let me take couple off
here<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:27.840> show<00:01:28.140> you<00:01:28.200> what<00:01:28.380> I'm<00:01:28.470> talking<00:01:28.500> about

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:30.350 
here and show you what I'm talking about

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.749 
here and show you what I'm talking about
each<00:01:31.350> of<00:01:31.590> these<00:01:31.710> boxes<00:01:32.189> has<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:32.369> different

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
each of these boxes has a different

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.030 
each of these boxes has a different
symbol<00:01:32.939> or<00:01:33.210> no<00:01:33.509> symbol<00:01:33.960> every<00:01:34.470> single<00:01:34.770> card

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
symbol or no symbol every single card

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.850 
symbol or no symbol every single card
has<00:01:35.340> a<00:01:35.700> symbol<00:01:36.240> in<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.540> top<00:01:36.750> right<00:01:37.710> hand

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
has a symbol in the top right hand

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.090 
has a symbol in the top right hand
corner<00:01:38.390> so<00:01:39.390> what<00:01:39.869> that<00:01:39.900> symbol<00:01:40.439> does<00:01:40.650> is<00:01:40.890> as

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
corner so what that symbol does is as

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.080 
corner so what that symbol does is as
you<00:01:41.189> can<00:01:41.340> see<00:01:41.460> this<00:01:41.729> /<00:01:42.090> dash<00:01:42.420> costs<00:01:42.990> two<00:01:43.229> points

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
you can see this / dash costs two points

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.810 
you can see this / dash costs two points
we<00:01:45.090> drop<00:01:45.420> it<00:01:45.630> on<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:45.930> matching<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:46.670> now<00:01:47.670> it

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
we drop it on the matching and now it

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.450 
we drop it on the matching and now it
costs<00:01:48.000> one<00:01:48.240> point<00:01:48.829> so<00:01:49.829> that's<00:01:50.189> how<00:01:50.310> you're

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
costs one point so that's how you're

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.260 
costs one point so that's how you're
able<00:01:50.610> to<00:01:50.820> fit<00:01:51.060> on<00:01:51.270> a<00:01:51.570> few<00:01:51.869> higher<00:01:52.229> level<00:01:52.619> mods

eight hundred credits to make this a
leveled<00:03:47.579> up<00:03:47.700> card<00:03:48.030> now<00:03:48.930> one<00:03:49.560> thing<00:03:49.590> you<00:03:49.829> also

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
leveled up card now one thing you also

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.069 
leveled up card now one thing you also
notice<00:03:50.400> is<00:03:50.579> that<00:03:50.610> the<00:03:50.910> point<00:03:51.299> value<00:03:51.390> went<00:03:52.019> up

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:52.079 
notice is that the point value went up

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:55.039 
notice is that the point value went up
on<00:03:52.380> this<00:03:52.590> card<00:03:52.910> so<00:03:53.910> now<00:03:54.150> this<00:03:54.450> card<00:03:54.720> is<00:03:54.870> going

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
on this card so now this card is going

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:56.600 
on this card so now this card is going
to<00:03:55.170> be<00:03:55.290> more<00:03:55.530> expensive<00:03:55.799> when<00:03:56.280> you're<00:03:56.400> putting

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
to be more expensive when you're putting

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.080 
to be more expensive when you're putting
it<00:03:56.850> on<00:03:57.060> to<00:03:57.420> your<00:03:57.750> shotgun<00:03:58.290> so<00:03:59.040> unless<00:03:59.730> you<00:03:59.940> have

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
it on to your shotgun so unless you have

it on to your shotgun so unless you have
a<00:04:00.120> matching<00:04:00.480> V<00:04:01.019> on<00:04:01.380> your<00:04:01.530> shotgun<00:04:02.010> it's<00:04:02.280> going

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:02.579 
a matching V on your shotgun it's going

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:05.360 
a matching V on your shotgun it's going
to<00:04:02.640> cost<00:04:02.820> you<00:04:03.000> five<00:04:03.329> or<00:04:03.540> more<00:04:03.690> points<00:04:04.019> so<00:04:05.010> just

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
to cost you five or more points so just

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:06.770 
to cost you five or more points so just
keep<00:04:05.489> that<00:04:05.549> in<00:04:05.760> mind<00:04:06.030> when<00:04:06.209> you<00:04:06.329> level<00:04:06.660> up

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
keep that in mind when you level up

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.930 
keep that in mind when you level up
things<00:04:07.049> before<00:04:07.500> you<00:04:07.980> start<00:04:08.250> leveling<00:04:08.609> them<00:04:08.760> up

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
things before you start leveling them up

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.670 
things before you start leveling them up
really<00:04:09.120> high<00:04:09.359> level<00:04:09.540> and<00:04:09.810> then<00:04:09.930> realize<00:04:10.470> that

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
really high level and then realize that

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.460 
really high level and then realize that
your<00:04:10.829> weapon<00:04:11.190> or<00:04:11.340> your<00:04:11.940> war<00:04:12.150> warframe<00:04:13.109> can't

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
your weapon or your war warframe can't

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.539 
your weapon or your war warframe can't
actually<00:04:13.680> handle<00:04:14.310> it<00:04:14.630> okay<00:04:16.340> also<00:04:17.340> another

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
actually handle it okay also another

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:19.580 
actually handle it okay also another
thing<00:04:17.669> to<00:04:17.880> look<00:04:17.910> at<00:04:18.209> with<00:04:18.539> the<00:04:18.690> fusion<00:04:18.959> you<00:04:19.410> can

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
thing to look at with the fusion you can

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.740 
thing to look at with the fusion you can
do<00:04:19.709> more<00:04:19.950> than<00:04:20.130> one<00:04:20.370> at<00:04:20.519> a<00:04:20.609> time<00:04:20.849> so<00:04:21.539> we<00:04:21.720> can

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:21.750 
do more than one at a time so we can

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.140 
do more than one at a time so we can
sacrifice

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
sacrifice

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:25.060 
sacrifice
pretty<00:04:23.690> much<00:04:23.870> we<00:04:24.020> can<00:04:24.110> sacrifice<00:04:24.290> this<00:04:24.650> entire

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
pretty much we can sacrifice this entire

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:32.510 
pretty much we can sacrifice this entire
page

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:35.960 

so<00:04:33.120> we<00:04:33.240> just<00:04:33.419> click<00:04:33.660> on<00:04:33.780> all<00:04:33.930> these<00:04:34.139> and<00:04:34.879> we<00:04:35.879> can

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
so we just click on all these and we can

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.450 
so we just click on all these and we can
get<00:04:36.120> it<00:04:36.210> to<00:04:36.240> rare<00:04:36.539> three<00:04:36.870> call<00:04:37.379> seven<00:04:37.889> and<00:04:38.220> it's

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
get it to rare three call seven and it's

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.839 
get it to rare three call seven and it's
plus<00:04:38.729> twenty<00:04:39.120> percent<00:04:39.419> power<00:04:39.599> duration<00:04:40.199> now

00:04:40.839 --> 00:04:40.849 
plus twenty percent power duration now

00:04:40.849 --> 00:04:43.399 
plus twenty percent power duration now
from<00:04:41.849> the<00:04:42.000> original<00:04:42.569> five<00:04:42.840> percent<00:04:43.259> power

00:04:43.399 --> 00:04:43.409 
from the original five percent power

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:48.110 
from the original five percent power
duration<00:04:44.009> as<00:04:44.280> a<00:04:44.610> rare<00:04:45.090> four<00:04:46.610> point<00:04:47.610> costs<00:04:47.879> for

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
duration as a rare four point costs for

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.480 
duration as a rare four point costs for
it's<00:04:48.960> a<00:04:49.080> rare<00:04:49.319> normal<00:04:49.770> and<00:04:49.979> then<00:04:50.069> you<00:04:50.190> can<00:04:50.340> see

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
it's a rare normal and then you can see

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:51.950 
it's a rare normal and then you can see
it<00:04:50.669> goes<00:04:50.819> where<00:04:51.000> three<00:04:51.330> which<00:04:51.509> means<00:04:51.720> that<00:04:51.870> we

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
it goes where three which means that we

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:56.570 
it goes where three which means that we
level<00:04:52.229> it<00:04:52.319> up<00:04:52.440> three<00:04:52.650> times<00:04:54.919> so<00:04:55.919> with<00:04:56.430> your

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 
level it up three times so with your

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.879 
level it up three times so with your
warframe<00:04:57.289> you're<00:04:58.289> probably<00:04:58.530> going<00:04:58.740> to<00:04:58.830> want

00:04:58.879 --> 00:04:58.889 
warframe you're probably going to want

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:01.219 
warframe you're probably going to want
to<00:04:59.129> use<00:04:59.190> all<00:04:59.669> ten<00:04:59.970> slots<00:05:00.360> but<00:05:00.900> you're<00:05:01.050> going<00:05:01.139> to

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:01.229 
to use all ten slots but you're going to

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:02.899 
to use all ten slots but you're going to
have<00:05:01.289> to<00:05:01.440> pick<00:05:01.650> and<00:05:01.800> choose<00:05:01.889> especially<00:05:02.729> while

00:05:02.899 --> 00:05:02.909 
have to pick and choose especially while

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:05.240 
have to pick and choose especially while
you're<00:05:03.060> leveling<00:05:03.419> it<00:05:03.599> and<00:05:03.780> even<00:05:04.379> more<00:05:04.740> so<00:05:04.979> if

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:05.250 
you're leveling it and even more so if

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:08.689 
you're leveling it and even more so if
you<00:05:05.430> don't<00:05:05.520> have<00:05:05.699> an<00:05:05.819> Oregon<00:05:07.250> weapons<00:05:08.250> this

00:05:08.689 --> 00:05:08.699 
you don't have an Oregon weapons this

00:05:08.699 --> 00:05:10.960 
you don't have an Oregon weapons this
makes<00:05:08.940> it<00:05:09.060> a<00:05:09.180> little<00:05:09.479> bit<00:05:09.750> more<00:05:09.930> constraining

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:10.970 
makes it a little bit more constraining

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:13.670 
makes it a little bit more constraining
as<00:05:11.970> you<00:05:12.150> can<00:05:12.300> see<00:05:12.509> weapons<00:05:12.960> I<00:05:13.080> only<00:05:13.199> have<00:05:13.380> one

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 
as you can see weapons I only have one

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.129 
as you can see weapons I only have one
that's<00:05:13.860> blue<00:05:14.270> every<00:05:15.270> weapon<00:05:15.419> that<00:05:15.659> I've<00:05:15.810> used

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:16.139 
that's blue every weapon that I've used

00:05:16.139 --> 00:05:18.499 
that's blue every weapon that I've used
only<00:05:16.380> has<00:05:16.680> one<00:05:17.009> blue<00:05:17.370> slot<00:05:17.759> it's<00:05:18.389> almost

00:05:18.499 --> 00:05:18.509 
only has one blue slot it's almost

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:20.629 
only has one blue slot it's almost
always<00:05:18.780> in<00:05:19.050> the<00:05:19.139> top<00:05:19.169> left<00:05:19.680> corner<00:05:20.039> which

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:20.639 
always in the top left corner which

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:22.490 
always in the top left corner which
means<00:05:20.940> every<00:05:21.240> other<00:05:21.599> card<00:05:22.110> you're<00:05:22.319> going<00:05:22.440> to

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 
means every other card you're going to

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.980 
means every other card you're going to
be<00:05:22.620> paying<00:05:22.800> full<00:05:23.130> price<00:05:23.190> for<00:05:23.460> in<00:05:24.030> this<00:05:24.750> case

00:05:24.980 --> 00:05:24.990 
be paying full price for in this case

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:29.749 
be paying full price for in this case
the<00:05:25.229> card<00:05:25.440> is<00:05:25.590> normally<00:05:26.130> six<00:05:26.460> points<00:05:28.639> but<00:05:29.639> I've

00:05:29.749 --> 00:05:29.759 
the card is normally six points but I've

00:05:29.759 --> 00:05:31.730 
the card is normally six points but I've
got<00:05:29.940> it<00:05:30.030> down<00:05:30.180> to<00:05:30.210> three<00:05:30.300> but<00:05:30.990> if<00:05:31.110> we<00:05:31.139> want<00:05:31.500> I've

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:31.740 
got it down to three but if we want I've

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:34.939 
got it down to three but if we want I've
got<00:05:32.159> this<00:05:32.340> one<00:05:32.610> we<00:05:33.539> can<00:05:33.690> take<00:05:33.840> this<00:05:34.020> out<00:05:34.289> move

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:34.949 
got this one we can take this out move

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:37.459 
got this one we can take this out move
this<00:05:34.979> over<00:05:35.400> now<00:05:36.300> that<00:05:36.479> costs<00:05:36.780> five<00:05:37.020> instead<00:05:37.409> of

00:05:37.459 --> 00:05:37.469 
this over now that costs five instead of

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:40.629 
this over now that costs five instead of
10<00:05:37.800> and<00:05:38.120> now<00:05:39.120> this<00:05:39.330> only<00:05:39.509> costs<00:05:39.870> a<00:05:39.900> flat<00:05:40.139> five

00:05:40.629 --> 00:05:40.639 
10 and now this only costs a flat five

00:05:40.639 --> 00:05:43.100 
10 and now this only costs a flat five
so<00:05:41.639> those<00:05:42.330> are<00:05:42.509> the<00:05:42.539> kind<00:05:42.750> of<00:05:42.780> things<00:05:42.870> you're

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:43.110 
so those are the kind of things you're

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:44.689 
so those are the kind of things you're
going<00:05:43.229> to<00:05:43.319> have<00:05:43.469> to<00:05:43.650> do<00:05:43.800> especially<00:05:44.310> if<00:05:44.550> you're

00:05:44.689 --> 00:05:44.699 
going to have to do especially if you're

00:05:44.699 --> 00:05:46.779 
going to have to do especially if you're
going<00:05:44.819> to<00:05:44.880> start<00:05:45.030> leveling<00:05:45.569> these<00:05:45.780> cards

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:46.789 
going to start leveling these cards

00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:49.459 
going to start leveling these cards
right<00:05:47.789> now<00:05:47.819> I<00:05:47.940> have<00:05:48.180> this<00:05:48.330> one<00:05:48.539> unlocked<00:05:49.050> so

00:05:49.459 --> 00:05:49.469 
right now I have this one unlocked so

00:05:49.469 --> 00:05:53.120 
right now I have this one unlocked so
it's<00:05:49.620> level<00:05:49.860> 23<00:05:50.490> which<00:05:50.759> gives<00:05:51.000> me<00:05:51.150> 43<00:05:51.900> if<00:05:52.800> this

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:53.130 
it's level 23 which gives me 43 if this

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:55.219 
it's level 23 which gives me 43 if this
was<00:05:53.370> not<00:05:53.669> unlocked<00:05:54.210> I<00:05:54.419> would<00:05:54.569> only<00:05:54.659> have<00:05:54.900> 23

00:05:55.219 --> 00:05:55.229 
was not unlocked I would only have 23

00:05:55.229 --> 00:05:57.800 
was not unlocked I would only have 23
points<00:05:55.770> spent<00:05:56.190> which<00:05:57.029> is<00:05:57.210> pretty<00:05:57.659> much

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:57.810 
points spent which is pretty much

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:01.370 
points spent which is pretty much
nothing<00:05:59.210> right<00:06:00.210> now<00:06:00.240> all<00:06:00.630> of<00:06:00.810> these<00:06:00.930> are<00:06:01.139> base

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:01.380 
nothing right now all of these are base

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:04.760 
nothing right now all of these are base
level<00:06:01.710> one<00:06:01.919> I<00:06:02.750> think<00:06:03.750> this<00:06:04.139> one<00:06:04.380> is<00:06:04.409> uncommon

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:04.770 
level one I think this one is uncommon

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:08.089 
level one I think this one is uncommon
why<00:06:04.979> levelled<00:06:05.310> this<00:06:05.460> once<00:06:05.759> so<00:06:06.949> that's<00:06:07.949> a

00:06:08.089 --> 00:06:08.099 
why levelled this once so that's a

00:06:08.099 --> 00:06:10.010 
why levelled this once so that's a
little<00:06:08.250> bit<00:06:08.400> of<00:06:08.639> a<00:06:08.729> boost<00:06:09.000> but<00:06:09.300> not<00:06:09.449> much<00:06:09.719> so

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:10.020 
little bit of a boost but not much so

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:11.540 
little bit of a boost but not much so
you<00:06:10.110> can<00:06:10.319> see<00:06:10.440> how<00:06:10.469> fast<00:06:10.830> it's<00:06:11.130> going<00:06:11.190> to<00:06:11.370> rack

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:11.550 
you can see how fast it's going to rack

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:16.040 
you can see how fast it's going to rack
up<00:06:11.580> when<00:06:11.909> you<00:06:12.000> start<00:06:12.180> leveling<00:06:12.509> them<00:06:15.050> anyways

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:16.050 
up when you start leveling them anyways

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:18.649 
up when you start leveling them anyways
