00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:15.430
 of batista70phone today I present to you 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:18.700
 new to car moore for samsung galaxy s 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:22.180
 5 each in our little box we go 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:25.029
 to extract it ok 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:27.099
 here it is this is the gold version here 

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:28.960
 we have the black version and here the 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:31.960
 gray version 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:35.920
 let's see how we are made 

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:38.920
 a part with a kind of fake sheet 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.290
 if so we want to call that 

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.150
 however it is not a bit rough 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:45.460
 smooth so you can have one 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:48.340
 good full protection handle 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:51.400
 complete as you can see is covered in 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:53.760
 all corners inside soft part 

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:56.020
 to prevent the phone from being scratched 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.300
 back here we also have protection 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:01.270
 for the camera we see how stocking 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:04.629
 on gold since we found the 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:08.530
 our s5 we go to insert it as 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:10.720
 you can see total protection not 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:13.270
 the part remains uncovered as well 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.130
 front to a minimum of protection if 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.110
 should you fall in this way not 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.090
 absolutely nothing is happening unless 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.710
 that there are no stones underneath but 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.390
 this is imponderable 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.340
 as you can see also the camera remains 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:27.940
 completely covered here we have the 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:31.420
 power button above access to all 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:34.600
 the various sensor connectors button of the 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:37.210
 more or less beautiful volume in evidence of the 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.890
 reachable lower part below 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:43.479
 it's all covered remain accessible 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:45.520
 of the various handle connections is 

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:48.549
 really beautiful jumping from a minimum of 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.010
 very elegant sliding as you see 

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:51.810
 also the various 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:55.620
 outside they are positioned in a manner 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:57.750
 completely correct, then colors 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:00.630
 they go to busts there is that gold the black one 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.280
 and the silver one then of course 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.640
 everyone will make their choice 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:08.430
 this however the cover that gives 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.950
 almost total protection not for 

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:11.790
 no armor means armor there are 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.280
 then the various models 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.920
 this is the tuga armor and how you can 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:20.640
 see really very elegant beautiful 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:23.790
 protective increases it very slightly 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.260
 thickness however sincerely in my opinion 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.790
 worth it because yes the thickness 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.040
 increases but protection also increases 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.920
 notably when we talk about phones 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.980
 from 6 700 euros according to me a minimum of 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.379
 extra protection is absolutely not 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.450
 to despise found as always in the 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:41.239
 our shop with this concluded only on 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:44.239
 from loris alias batista70 for 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:44.239
