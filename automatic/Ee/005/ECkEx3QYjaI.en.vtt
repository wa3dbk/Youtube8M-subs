00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.270 
hey guys I'm back another GoPro tips and

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.499 
hey guys I'm back another GoPro tips and
tricks<00:00:03.929> video<00:00:04.470> in<00:00:04.740> this<00:00:05.640> video<00:00:05.940> I'm<00:00:06.240> going<00:00:06.330> to

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
tricks video in this video I'm going to

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.500 
tricks video in this video I'm going to
be<00:00:06.569> unboxing<00:00:07.230> the<00:00:07.290> RAM<00:00:07.940> standard<00:00:08.940> and<00:00:09.120> long

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
be unboxing the RAM standard and long

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.110 
be unboxing the RAM standard and long
extender<00:00:10.410> bar<00:00:10.620> with<00:00:10.950> the<00:00:11.099> double<00:00:11.429> socket<00:00:11.730> arm

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
extender bar with the double socket arm

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:18.800 
extender bar with the double socket arm
so<00:00:12.389> what<00:00:13.019> this<00:00:13.170> is<00:00:13.230> is<00:00:13.590> it's<00:00:13.889> too<00:00:16.520> it's<00:00:17.520> too<00:00:17.850> Ram

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
so what this is is it's too it's too Ram

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.590 
so what this is is it's too it's too Ram
socket<00:00:19.320> arms<00:00:19.529> one<00:00:19.970> standard<00:00:20.970> length<00:00:21.180> socket

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
socket arms one standard length socket

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.650 
socket arms one standard length socket
arm<00:00:21.779> and<00:00:21.960> then<00:00:22.470> one<00:00:22.769> long<00:00:23.369> socket<00:00:24.269> arm<00:00:24.420> as<00:00:24.600> well

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
arm and then one long socket arm as well

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:28.490 
arm and then one long socket arm as well
as<00:00:25.619> a<00:00:26.119> one<00:00:27.119> inch<00:00:27.269> to<00:00:27.390> one<00:00:27.510> inch<00:00:27.539> ball<00:00:27.869> adapter

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:28.500 
as a one inch to one inch ball adapter

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.519 
as a one inch to one inch ball adapter
so<00:00:28.650> this<00:00:28.769> means<00:00:29.189> that<00:00:29.310> we<00:00:29.460> can<00:00:29.609> mount

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:30.529 
so this means that we can mount

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:32.209 
so this means that we can mount
basically<00:00:31.529> it<00:00:31.710> gives<00:00:31.800> you<00:00:31.980> double<00:00:32.099> the

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
basically it gives you double the

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:33.319 
basically it gives you double the
versatility<00:00:32.579> because<00:00:32.730> you<00:00:32.910> get<00:00:33.000> this<00:00:33.149> one

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
versatility because you get this one

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.420 
versatility because you get this one
long<00:00:33.480> one<00:00:33.540> and<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:34.380> one<00:00:34.559> short<00:00:34.829> one<00:00:34.980> and<00:00:35.130> then

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:35.430 
long one and the one short one and then

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.590 
long one and the one short one and then
you<00:00:35.520> mount<00:00:35.670> this<00:00:35.820> on<00:00:36.030> to<00:00:36.239> whatever<00:00:36.390> you're

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
you mount this on to whatever you're

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.479 
you mount this on to whatever you're
mounting<00:00:36.719> it<00:00:36.960> on<00:00:37.020> to<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:37.440> this<00:00:37.980> piece<00:00:38.280> here

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
mounting it on to and this piece here

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.040 
mounting it on to and this piece here
can<00:00:38.700> hang<00:00:38.910> off<00:00:39.090> and<00:00:39.300> then<00:00:39.390> your<00:00:39.510> camera<00:00:39.809> can<00:00:39.960> go

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
can hang off and then your camera can go

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.420 
can hang off and then your camera can go
on<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.230> end<00:00:40.379> so<00:00:40.559> let's<00:00:40.739> just<00:00:40.920> put<00:00:41.100> together<00:00:41.250> a

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
on the end so let's just put together a

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.639 
on the end so let's just put together a
little<00:00:41.550> scenario<00:00:41.969> here<00:00:42.390> with<00:00:42.420> this<00:00:42.719> there's<00:00:43.559> a

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
little scenario here with this there's a

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.290 
little scenario here with this there's a
GoPro<00:00:44.129> mounted<00:00:44.430> onto<00:00:44.610> the<00:00:44.820> 1<00:00:44.969> inch<00:00:45.090> ball

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
GoPro mounted onto the 1 inch ball

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.600 
GoPro mounted onto the 1 inch ball
system<00:00:45.750> using<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.230> gill<00:00:46.469> pro<00:00:46.680> 1<00:00:47.010> inch<00:00:47.160> bolt<00:00:47.399> to

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
system using the gill pro 1 inch bolt to

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.000 
system using the gill pro 1 inch bolt to
or<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.940> ball<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.690> one<00:00:48.899> gopro<00:00:49.440> adapter<00:00:49.469> and

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
or the ball to one gopro adapter and

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.910 
or the ball to one gopro adapter and
then<00:00:50.879> also<00:00:51.270> something<00:00:51.840> like<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.320> suction<00:00:52.710> cup

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
then also something like a suction cup

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.100 
then also something like a suction cup
mount<00:00:53.070> so<00:00:53.399> there's<00:00:53.579> a<00:00:53.640> suction<00:00:53.879> cup<00:00:54.030> mount<00:00:54.180> we

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
mount so there's a suction cup mount we

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.860 
mount so there's a suction cup mount we
can<00:00:55.260> stick<00:00:55.469> this<00:00:55.620> on<00:00:55.890> to<00:00:56.129> our<00:00:56.309> car<00:00:56.820> or<00:00:57.420> whatever

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
can stick this on to our car or whatever

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.369 
can stick this on to our car or whatever
we<00:00:58.140> want<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.940> lock<00:00:59.940> it<00:01:00.090> down<00:01:00.329> then<00:01:00.960> we<00:01:01.079> can<00:01:01.199> grab

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
we want to lock it down then we can grab

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:07.630 
we want to lock it down then we can grab
this<00:01:01.559> one<00:01:02.780> unwind<00:01:03.780> it<00:01:04.729> snap<00:01:05.729> it<00:01:05.970> onto<00:01:06.210> their

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
this one unwind it snap it onto their

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.330 
this one unwind it snap it onto their
lock<00:01:08.640> that<00:01:08.909> down<00:01:09.920> then<00:01:10.920> we<00:01:11.010> can<00:01:11.130> get<00:01:11.189> this

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
lock that down then we can get this

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.620 
lock that down then we can get this
other<00:01:11.520> end<00:01:13.520> unwind<00:01:14.520> this<00:01:14.670> one<00:01:14.909> that<00:01:15.390> we<00:01:15.479> can

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
other end unwind this one that we can

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.609 
other end unwind this one that we can
stick<00:01:15.810> our<00:01:15.930> GoPro<00:01:16.350> in<00:01:16.470> here<00:01:18.320> and<00:01:19.320> we<00:01:19.380> can<00:01:19.470> see

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
stick our GoPro in here and we can see

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.969 
stick our GoPro in here and we can see
instantly<00:01:19.979> that<00:01:20.250> we<00:01:20.340> have<00:01:20.490> a<00:01:20.520> huge<00:01:21.500> time<00:01:22.500> frame

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
instantly that we have a huge time frame

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.469 
instantly that we have a huge time frame
we<00:01:23.909> have<00:01:24.000> a<00:01:24.060> huge<00:01:24.330> amount<00:01:24.570> of<00:01:24.869> flexibility<00:01:25.770> in

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
we have a huge amount of flexibility in

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:29.690 
we have a huge amount of flexibility in
the<00:01:27.479> length<00:01:27.750> that<00:01:28.560> our<00:01:28.710> GoPro<00:01:29.100> can<00:01:29.280> reach<00:01:29.460> and

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
the length that our GoPro can reach and

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.100 
the length that our GoPro can reach and
the<00:01:29.759> different<00:01:30.000> angles<00:01:30.390> we<00:01:30.540> can<00:01:30.659> achieve<00:01:30.750> so

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
the different angles we can achieve so

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.870 
the different angles we can achieve so
you<00:01:31.200> really<00:01:31.770> want<00:01:31.920> to<00:01:31.979> get<00:01:32.070> far<00:01:32.400> away<00:01:32.430> from<00:01:32.640> the

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
you really want to get far away from the

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.969 
you really want to get far away from the
side<00:01:33.060> of<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.180> car<00:01:33.540> or<00:01:34.350> I<00:01:34.380> want<00:01:34.590> to<00:01:34.650> get<00:01:34.740> kind<00:01:34.950> of

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
side of the car or I want to get kind of

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.950 
side of the car or I want to get kind of
an<00:01:35.070> aerial<00:01:35.430> view<00:01:35.490> on<00:01:35.759> something<00:01:35.960> using

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
an aerial view on something using

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.690 
an aerial view on something using
extender<00:01:37.590> bars<00:01:37.799> like<00:01:38.040> this<00:01:38.220> can<00:01:38.460> be<00:01:38.549> a<00:01:38.579> good

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
extender bars like this can be a good

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:40.730 
extender bars like this can be a good
idea<00:01:38.850> one<00:01:39.840> thing<00:01:39.990> to<00:01:40.020> note<00:01:40.229> is<00:01:40.259> using<00:01:40.650> this

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
idea one thing to note is using this

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.010 
idea one thing to note is using this
with<00:01:40.950> something<00:01:41.189> like<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.430> magnet<00:01:41.970> mount<00:01:42.119> may

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
with something like the magnet mount may

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.880 
with something like the magnet mount may
not<00:01:43.229> be<00:01:43.579> the<00:01:44.579> best<00:01:44.820> idea<00:01:44.939> ever<00:01:45.360> because<00:01:45.890> this

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
not be the best idea ever because this

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:48.649 
not be the best idea ever because this
will<00:01:47.159> add<00:01:47.310> a<00:01:47.340> lot<00:01:47.549> of<00:01:47.610> leverage<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:48.210> a<00:01:48.329> lot<00:01:48.509> of

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
will add a lot of leverage and a lot of

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.499 
will add a lot of leverage and a lot of
force<00:01:49.350> to<00:01:49.409> pull<00:01:49.829> one<00:01:50.670> side<00:01:50.970> of<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.149> map<00:01:51.299> top

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
force to pull one side of the map top

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.289 
force to pull one side of the map top
I'd<00:01:52.079> even<00:01:52.259> be<00:01:52.350> a<00:01:52.439> little<00:01:52.710> bit<00:01:53.210> worried<00:01:54.210> if

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
I'd even be a little bit worried if

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:55.910 
I'd even be a little bit worried if
using<00:01:54.540> with<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.780> suction<00:01:55.350> cup<00:01:55.470> mount<00:01:55.500> again
