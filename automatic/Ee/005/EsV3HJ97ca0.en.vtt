we've done a two pass and we wouldn't

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:05.340 
we've done a two pass and we wouldn't

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:05.350 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:07.230 

Gators<00:05:05.770> trying<00:05:06.100> to<00:05:06.220> get<00:05:06.340> out<00:05:06.460> of<00:05:06.580> the<00:05:06.700> big<00:05:06.940> hole

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:07.240 
Gators trying to get out of the big hole

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.589 
Gators trying to get out of the big hole
here

00:05:10.589 --> 00:05:10.599 

00:05:10.599 --> 00:05:13.320 

so<00:05:11.169> under<00:05:11.649> pressure<00:05:11.830> hit<00:05:12.219> as<00:05:12.339> he<00:05:12.490> throws<00:05:12.520> Arvin

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:13.330 
so under pressure hit as he throws Arvin

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.929 
so under pressure hit as he throws Arvin
breaks<00:05:14.199> a<00:05:14.409> tackle<00:05:14.679> they'll<00:05:15.309> mark<00:05:15.610> about<00:05:15.849> the

00:05:15.929 --> 00:05:15.939 
breaks a tackle they'll mark about the

00:05:15.939 --> 00:05:17.939 
breaks a tackle they'll mark about the
boundaries<00:05:16.240> in<00:05:16.479> 12<00:05:16.839> yards<00:05:17.169> and<00:05:17.289> even<00:05:17.710> deep

00:05:17.939 --> 00:05:17.949 
boundaries in 12 yards and even deep

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:19.439 
boundaries in 12 yards and even deep
down<00:05:18.219> in<00:05:18.399> the<00:05:18.490> end<00:05:18.639> zone<00:05:18.729> they're<00:05:19.119> still

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:19.449 
down in the end zone they're still

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:21.209 
down in the end zone they're still
pressure<00:05:19.839> and<00:05:20.110> again<00:05:20.529> I<00:05:20.559> think<00:05:20.740> that<00:05:20.979> is<00:05:21.189> the

00:05:21.209 --> 00:05:21.219 
pressure and again I think that is the

00:05:21.219 --> 00:05:23.369 
pressure and again I think that is the
way<00:05:21.429> you<00:05:21.490> have<00:05:21.789> to<00:05:21.999> go<00:05:22.119> after<00:05:22.330> Tim<00:05:22.749> Tebow<00:05:23.139> don't

00:05:23.369 --> 00:05:23.379 
way you have to go after Tim Tebow don't

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:24.839 
way you have to go after Tim Tebow don't
let<00:05:23.529> him<00:05:23.649> get<00:05:23.800> comfortable<00:05:24.219> a<00:05:24.369> nice<00:05:24.550> job<00:05:24.819> of

00:05:24.839 --> 00:05:24.849 
let him get comfortable a nice job of

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:26.699 
let him get comfortable a nice job of
bringing<00:05:25.089> pressure<00:05:25.479> forcing<00:05:26.319> the<00:05:26.409> underneath

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:26.709 
bringing pressure forcing the underneath

00:05:26.709 --> 00:05:31.049 
bringing pressure forcing the underneath
