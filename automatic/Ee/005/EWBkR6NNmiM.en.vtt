00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:06.730
 last week the creator of the game world 

00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:08.590
 of warcraft in bbc interview 

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:09.640
 proposed to include video games in 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:11.230
 Olympic program 

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:19.779
 but let's find out what he thinks about it 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:21.369
 about Belarusians now appeared 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:22.119
 news about what eSports want 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:26.230
 add discharge 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:32.079
 olympic games how are you to this all the same 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:34.420
 it is not a physical sport this kind of garbage 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:38.380
 well, what are you guys eSports that is 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.390
 sit at the computer mac print on 

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.730
 fingers and 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.230
 principle positive because i like 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.420
 would from our computer games anyway 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:49.690
 to some kind of development and science in principle and 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.880
 technology and i think that is not necessary 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.790
 olympic games should some 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.560
 power let's say so competitions on this 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:01:00.570
 principle 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:04.299
 if our brains in our youth already 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:08.440
 ripe for such participation such 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:10.930
 competitions then of course why not they 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.460
 are considered alongside on the same a sign iq 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.750
 sporting you escort limper give 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.750
 It seems to me wrong 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:23.900
 but if I had to replace 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.220
 computer game of any kind 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.550
 sports at the olympic games which 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:32.270
 passing the dead fire so you know i 

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:35.200
 would probably even out of it easy 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:40.000
 athletics would give ladies drive 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:43.640
 when women are thrown and what chose 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.580
 i don't know better of course nothing 

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:52.220
 Removed only add probably but 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:54.370
 can be dangerous this female throwing 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.370
 cores 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:03.470
 bored her slightly discriminants loban here 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:06.640
 also need to do something all leaving as 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:09.470
 and for a brother it seems that when you do about 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:13.340
 no no no you can't sacrifice everything 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:14.990
 should well here with such a controversial question I 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.120
 not really a lover i grew up on 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:23.360
 sports games principle so me like 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:26.240
 I would not mind bringing up the core 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:28.970
 it's hard to answer because those 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:31.550
 sports that are already approved and 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:34.580
 I am busy for a long time you are their irreplaceable 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:38.050
 also if to add such subject as 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:42.310
 eSports schooling 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.310
 Well, I think that probably yes 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:56.299
 I think that probably there is a death 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.299
 it will be a year 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:06.140
 and the more important it seems to me but we are not 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.210
 Chinese 

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:12.270
 but in principle it is probably interesting 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:14.280
 if you really it will somehow 

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:17.100
 develop children 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:20.840
 so that everything is just fine and not 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:25.050
 away i'm just for i'm against 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:26.030
 eSports has become in mind not sand at all 

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:28.570
 love 

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:36.170
 let the boys 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:41.060
 Yes, and a different opinion is not well, probably early in 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:43.340
 China is normal the less this one will be called 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:45.110
 yours let's go ours and go to normal 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.270
 all cybersportsmen only phones 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:49.310
 sit playing with you that is nothing would 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:50.500
 just wouldn't change it would just 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:54.880
 at some official level 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.880
 thank you guys thank you very much for the answer
