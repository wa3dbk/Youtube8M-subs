 I will introduce you to the kebab 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.460
 tandoori chicken 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:16.020
 so for that it will take me a 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:21.869
 organic yellow chicken fillet 3 spoons 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:24.140

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.779

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:32.640
 always a cutting board a 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.739
 tablespoon a big knife or and 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.770
 my sister is a little knife or at 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:42.059
 paring knife so we start with 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:46.940
 the chicken fillet that we will cut in 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.940
 the sense of length 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.070
 like this 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:06.470
 then 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:06.470
 cut chicken strips 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:12.259
 so to prepare the chicken marinade 

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:20.119
 tandoori will need cheese 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:24.350
 White and ear Sade tandoori so 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:27.259
 mixed well to have a color 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:31.549
 and a uniform perfume 

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:33.349
 so we have our banks of two nets of 

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:36.829
 chicken that will macerate in the 

00:01:33.349 --> 00:01:38.659
 sauce so we used it we used a 

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:42.319
 utensil like the spoon we 

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:44.929
 had just now we will have to 

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:46.759
 wait two good hours for the 

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:49.700
 good marine chicken in his stand 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:51.140
 feeds so we let marinate the 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:55.759
 chicken for two good hours offer 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:58.879
 in the fridge so there the chicken macerate well 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:00.129
 in his sauce so we will make 

00:01:58.879 --> 00:02:02.679
 The skewers 

00:02:00.129 --> 00:02:05.989
 for that we will start with the picket 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:10.509
 at one end and then right away 

00:02:05.989 --> 00:02:10.509
 fold like an accordion make 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:21.930
 here we continue the whole length of the 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:27.430
 net but it's to make cuts 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:29.380
 fairly regular here so we'll have to 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.830
 preheat or pale like this 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.830
 sign for the future 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:42.040
 we heat the oil enough 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:43.420
 abundantly so we do not hang so 

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:47.260
 there him as liquid so it's up to 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:50.850
 to say that she is hot already and there 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.850
 we will come to ask kebabs 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:05.410
