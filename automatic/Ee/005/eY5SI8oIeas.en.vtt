preparing<00:01:24.170> for<00:01:24.710> this<00:01:24.860> so<00:01:25.610> we'll<00:01:26.210> have<00:01:26.300> to<00:01:26.450> wait

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:26.570 
preparing for this so we'll have to wait

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.360 
preparing for this so we'll have to wait
to<00:01:26.750> see<00:01:26.780> what<00:01:26.900> will<00:01:27.110> talk<00:01:27.290> less<00:01:27.560> well<00:01:28.280> it's

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:28.370 
to see what will talk less well it's

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:29.740 
to see what will talk less well it's
gonna<00:01:28.490> take<00:01:28.610> quite<00:01:28.760> a<00:01:28.940> while<00:01:29.180> I<00:01:29.210> think<00:01:29.480> to<00:01:29.630> get

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750 
gonna take quite a while I think to get

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.359 
gonna take quite a while I think to get
around<00:01:29.930> the<00:01:30.080> whole<00:01:30.200> of<00:01:30.380> stadium<00:01:30.830> because

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.369 
around the whole of stadium because

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:33.400 
around the whole of stadium because
there<00:01:31.640> started<00:01:32.090> on<00:01:32.210> the<00:01:32.330> lower<00:01:32.479> tier<00:01:32.780> and<00:01:33.020> then

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:33.410 
there started on the lower tier and then

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:34.630 
there started on the lower tier and then
later<00:01:33.650> on<00:01:33.800> they're<00:01:33.950> going<00:01:34.070> onto<00:01:34.250> the<00:01:34.430> upper

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:34.640 
later on they're going onto the upper

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.200 
later on they're going onto the upper
tier<00:01:34.850> so<00:01:35.510> you<00:01:36.260> know<00:01:36.350> there's<00:01:36.560> 30,000<00:01:37.220> seats<00:01:37.430> so

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:38.210 
tier so you know there's 30,000 seats so

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:39.760 
tier so you know there's 30,000 seats so
that's<00:01:38.360> quite<00:01:38.630> a<00:01:38.690> long<00:01:38.930> time<00:01:39.170> to<00:01:39.380> get<00:01:39.500> round

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
that's quite a long time to get round

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.620 
that's quite a long time to get round
and<00:01:39.950> I<00:01:39.979> think<00:01:40.010> as<00:01:40.369> they<00:01:40.550> go<00:01:40.670> along<00:01:40.790> the

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:41.630 
and I think as they go along the

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.240 
and I think as they go along the
enthusiasm<00:01:42.350> will<00:01:42.500> dwindle<00:01:42.680> a<00:01:42.890> bit<00:01:43.070> because

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
enthusiasm will dwindle a bit because

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.670 
enthusiasm will dwindle a bit because
they<00:01:43.550> start<00:01:43.820> off<00:01:43.970> at<00:01:44.150> a<00:01:44.180> really<00:01:44.450> fast<00:01:44.630> pace<00:01:44.780> and

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:45.680 
they start off at a really fast pace and

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.140 
they start off at a really fast pace and
I<00:01:45.770> think<00:01:45.979> they'll<00:01:46.100> slow<00:01:46.340> down<00:01:46.369> as<00:01:46.729> time<00:01:46.940> goes

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:47.150 
I think they'll slow down as time goes

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.300 
I think they'll slow down as time goes
on
