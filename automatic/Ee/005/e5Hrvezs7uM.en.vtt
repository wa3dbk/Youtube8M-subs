00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.619 

yes<00:00:01.800> I<00:00:02.010> have<00:00:02.159> the<00:00:02.370> I<00:00:02.610> think<00:00:02.760> that<00:00:02.850> x1<00:00:03.330> carbon

00:00:03.619 --> 00:00:03.629 
yes I have the I think that x1 carbon

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:05.510 
yes I have the I think that x1 carbon
here<00:00:03.990> on<00:00:04.110> the<00:00:04.230> left<00:00:04.470> hand<00:00:04.710> side<00:00:05.009> and<00:00:05.339> then<00:00:05.490> on

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.520 
here on the left hand side and then on

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.780 
here on the left hand side and then on
the<00:00:05.700> right<00:00:06.000> of<00:00:06.359> that<00:00:06.509> is<00:00:06.750> to<00:00:07.379> think<00:00:07.589> that<00:00:07.740> x2<00:00:08.400> 30

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
the right of that is to think that x2 30

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.660 
the right of that is to think that x2 30
so<00:00:09.120> these<00:00:09.300> are<00:00:09.540> the<00:00:10.170> two<00:00:10.380> kind<00:00:11.099> of<00:00:11.160> premier

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
so these are the two kind of premier

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.060 
so these are the two kind of premier
portable<00:00:12.210> notebooks<00:00:12.599> from<00:00:12.809> the<00:00:13.080> lenovo<00:00:13.860> right

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
portable notebooks from the lenovo right

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.129 
portable notebooks from the lenovo right
now<00:00:14.219> in<00:00:14.460> the<00:00:14.580> ThinkPad<00:00:15.030> series<00:00:15.540> now<00:00:16.020> I've

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
now in the ThinkPad series now I've

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.349 
now in the ThinkPad series now I've
already<00:00:16.289> done<00:00:16.440> a<00:00:16.590> full<00:00:16.830> comparison<00:00:17.400> of<00:00:17.490> the<00:00:17.609> x1

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
already done a full comparison of the x1

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.529 
already done a full comparison of the x1
carbon<00:00:18.660> that<00:00:19.170> think<00:00:19.470> about<00:00:19.619> x2<00:00:19.980> 20<00:00:20.490> so<00:00:21.390> I'm

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
carbon that think about x2 20 so I'm

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:23.120 
carbon that think about x2 20 so I'm
just<00:00:21.660> going<00:00:21.810> to<00:00:21.840> kind<00:00:22.140> of<00:00:22.320> a<00:00:22.350> quick<00:00:22.590> take<00:00:22.859> here

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
just going to kind of a quick take here

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.750 
just going to kind of a quick take here
comparison<00:00:23.910> and<00:00:24.560> step<00:00:25.560> you<00:00:25.650> through<00:00:25.680> you<00:00:26.580> know

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
comparison and step you through you know

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.130 
comparison and step you through you know
some<00:00:26.789> of<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.210> major<00:00:27.449> differences<00:00:27.720> are

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
some of the major differences are

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.599 
some of the major differences are
between<00:00:28.260> these<00:00:28.560> two<00:00:28.619> notebooks<00:00:29.189> if<00:00:29.460> you're

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
between these two notebooks if you're

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.910 
between these two notebooks if you're
considering<00:00:30.060> a<00:00:30.330> portable<00:00:31.170> think<00:00:31.439> pad<00:00:31.730> so<00:00:32.730> I

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:33.920 
considering a portable think pad so I

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.470 
considering a portable think pad so I
you<00:00:34.920> can<00:00:35.070> probably<00:00:35.309> see<00:00:35.670> here<00:00:35.910> if<00:00:36.000> I<00:00:36.090> shift

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
you can probably see here if I shift

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.569 
you can probably see here if I shift
over<00:00:36.989> to<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.290> left<00:00:37.469> that<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:38.100> ThinkPad

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
over to the left that the the ThinkPad

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.330 
over to the left that the the ThinkPad
x1<00:00:38.850> carbon<00:00:39.329> is<00:00:39.540> significantly<00:00:40.110> thinner<00:00:40.559> than

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
x1 carbon is significantly thinner than

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.369 
x1 carbon is significantly thinner than
the<00:00:41.730> ThinkPad<00:00:42.059> Edge<00:00:42.210> 2<00:00:42.239> 3<00:00:42.660> now<00:00:42.840> I<00:00:42.870> do<00:00:43.020> have<00:00:43.320> a

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
the ThinkPad Edge 2 3 now I do have a

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.920 
the ThinkPad Edge 2 3 now I do have a
larger<00:00:43.710> size<00:00:43.860> battery<00:00:44.340> on<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:45.329> thing<00:00:45.510> packs

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
larger size battery on the thing packs

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.049 
larger size battery on the thing packs
230<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:46.710> it<00:00:46.800> does<00:00:47.010> kind<00:00:47.340> of<00:00:47.460> stick<00:00:47.730> out<00:00:47.850> the

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
230 and it does kind of stick out the

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.319 
230 and it does kind of stick out the
bottom<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.629> little<00:00:49.410> bit<00:00:49.590> and<00:00:49.829> makes<00:00:50.370> it<00:00:50.550> raise

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
bottom a little bit and makes it raise

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.720 
bottom a little bit and makes it raise
up<00:00:51.600> so<00:00:52.199> if<00:00:52.500> you<00:00:52.620> had<00:00:52.800> a<00:00:52.829> smaller<00:00:53.190> four<00:00:53.520> cell

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
up so if you had a smaller four cell

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.080 
up so if you had a smaller four cell
battery<00:00:54.059> you<00:00:54.270> would<00:00:54.449> be<00:00:54.660> a<00:00:55.260> slightly<00:00:56.090> thinner

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
battery you would be a slightly thinner

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.299 
battery you would be a slightly thinner
profile<00:00:57.660> there<00:00:57.960> but<00:00:58.260> nonetheless<00:00:58.800> it<00:00:59.219> still

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
profile there but nonetheless it still

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.439 
profile there but nonetheless it still
wouldn't<00:00:59.579> make<00:00:59.699> it<00:00:59.850> thinner<00:01:00.030> in<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.210> x1

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
wouldn't make it thinner in the x1

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.779 
wouldn't make it thinner in the x1
carbon<00:01:01.039> well<00:01:02.039> I'm<00:01:02.129> not<00:01:02.250> going<00:01:02.430> to<00:01:02.460> close<00:01:02.640> the

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
carbon well I'm not going to close the

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.640 
carbon well I'm not going to close the
screams<00:01:03.059> I'm<00:01:03.239> using<00:01:03.539> one<00:01:03.809> hand<00:01:03.840> right<00:01:04.170> now<00:01:04.379> and

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
screams I'm using one hand right now and

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.160 
screams I'm using one hand right now and
frankly<00:01:05.339> I<00:01:05.369> can't<00:01:05.850> open<00:01:06.210> the<00:01:06.330> lids<00:01:06.720> up<00:01:06.930> very

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
frankly I can't open the lids up very

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.380 
frankly I can't open the lids up very
easily<00:01:07.439> with<00:01:07.890> just<00:01:08.189> one<00:01:08.369> hand<00:01:08.580> because<00:01:09.000> the

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
easily with just one hand because the

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.539 
easily with just one hand because the
hinges<00:01:10.049> are<00:01:10.170> so<00:01:10.350> stiff<00:01:10.710> and<00:01:11.010> that's<00:01:11.159> a<00:01:11.340> good

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
hinges are so stiff and that's a good

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.420 
hinges are so stiff and that's a good
thing<00:01:11.790> so<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.900> ThinkPad<00:01:13.350> x1<00:01:13.500> carbon<00:01:14.010> has<00:01:14.400> a

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
thing so the ThinkPad x1 carbon has a

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.170 
thing so the ThinkPad x1 carbon has a
low<00:01:14.790> voltage<00:01:15.000> processor<00:01:16.100> core<00:01:17.100> i5<00:01:17.460> or<00:01:17.850> Core<00:01:18.090> i7

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
low voltage processor core i5 or Core i7

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.499 
low voltage processor core i5 or Core i7
they<00:01:18.960> think<00:01:19.200> that<00:01:19.350> X<00:01:19.500> 230<00:01:20.009> meanwhile<00:01:20.610> has<00:01:21.000> a

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
they think that X 230 meanwhile has a

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.399 
they think that X 230 meanwhile has a
fully<00:01:21.840> fledged<00:01:22.259> Core<00:01:22.680> i5<00:01:22.799> or<00:01:23.040> i7<00:01:24.140> processor<00:01:25.140> so

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
fully fledged Core i5 or i7 processor so

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:26.450 
fully fledged Core i5 or i7 processor so
you're<00:01:25.619> going<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:25.770> get<00:01:25.950> better<00:01:26.189> performance

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
you're going to get better performance

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.780 
you're going to get better performance
out<00:01:27.119> of<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.960> thing<00:01:28.140> about<00:01:28.259> age<00:01:28.439> 230<00:01:28.979> now<00:01:29.250> the

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
out of the thing about age 230 now the

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.620 
out of the thing about age 230 now the
x1<00:01:30.119> carbon<00:01:30.360> comes<00:01:30.900> with<00:01:31.290> a<00:01:31.460> standard<00:01:32.630> SSD

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
x1 carbon comes with a standard SSD

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.740 
x1 carbon comes with a standard SSD
where<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.140> ThinkPad<00:01:34.670> x2<00:01:35.670> 30<00:01:35.939> does<00:01:36.240> not<00:01:36.479> it

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
where the ThinkPad x2 30 does not it

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.600 
where the ThinkPad x2 30 does not it
just<00:01:37.049> comes<00:01:37.290> with<00:01:37.350> a<00:01:37.500> hard<00:01:37.710> drive<00:01:37.860> though<00:01:38.549> you

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
just comes with a hard drive though you

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.490 
just comes with a hard drive though you
can<00:01:38.970> upgrade<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.450> SSD<00:01:39.930> and<00:01:40.049> get<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.320> same

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
can upgrade the SSD and get the same

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.380 
can upgrade the SSD and get the same
type<00:01:40.740> of<00:01:40.770> performance<00:01:41.460> you<00:01:42.030> know<00:01:42.150> you<00:01:42.240> can

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
type of performance you know you can

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.730 
type of performance you know you can
either<00:01:42.540> do<00:01:42.630> that<00:01:42.780> at<00:01:42.899> configuration<00:01:43.560> or

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
either do that at configuration or

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.920 
either do that at configuration or
aftermarket<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.970> thing<00:01:45.119> I<00:01:45.240> like<00:01:45.420> about<00:01:45.450> the

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
aftermarket the thing I like about the

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:47.690 
aftermarket the thing I like about the
x2<00:01:46.409> 30<00:01:46.710> which<00:01:47.009> would<00:01:47.159> be<00:01:47.250> easier<00:01:47.610> to

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
x2 30 which would be easier to

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.880 
x2 30 which would be easier to
demonstrate<00:01:47.930> with<00:01:48.930> the<00:01:49.140> light<00:01:49.320> off<00:01:49.500> here<00:01:49.740> is

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
demonstrate with the light off here is

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.039 
demonstrate with the light off here is
the<00:01:50.070> IPS<00:01:50.640> screen<00:01:50.880> I<00:01:51.240> think<00:01:51.689> both<00:01:51.869> these

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
the IPS screen I think both these

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.289 
the IPS screen I think both these
screens<00:01:52.649> are<00:01:52.740> pretty<00:01:52.979> good<00:01:53.189> if<00:01:53.790> I<00:01:53.909> turn<00:01:54.270> off

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
screens are pretty good if I turn off

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.530 
screens are pretty good if I turn off
the<00:01:54.780> light<00:01:54.990> you'll<00:01:55.229> see<00:01:55.530> when<00:01:56.490> I<00:01:56.520> talk<00:01:57.299> back

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
the light you'll see when I talk back

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.100 
the light you'll see when I talk back
the<00:01:57.719> screen<00:01:58.140> here<00:01:58.530> on<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:59.520> X<00:01:59.670> 230<00:02:00.180> and<00:02:00.509> already

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
the screen here on the X 230 and already

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.039 
the screen here on the X 230 and already
I<00:02:01.229> think<00:02:01.560> the<00:02:02.040> saturation<00:02:02.640> on<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.329> x1<00:02:03.810> carbon

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
I think the saturation on the x1 carbon

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.950 
I think the saturation on the x1 carbon
is<00:02:04.409> as<00:02:05.369> oversaturated<00:02:06.299> it's<00:02:06.509> some<00:02:06.780> of<00:02:06.869> the

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
is as oversaturated it's some of the

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.020 
is as oversaturated it's some of the
colors<00:02:07.259> were<00:02:07.380> washed<00:02:07.590> out<00:02:07.799> compared<00:02:08.670> to<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:08.849> X

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.030 
colors were washed out compared to the X

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.360 
colors were washed out compared to the X
230<00:02:09.509> which<00:02:09.720> is<00:02:09.899> really<00:02:10.170> kind<00:02:10.830> of<00:02:10.860> richer<00:02:11.250> and

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
230 which is really kind of richer and

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.400 
230 which is really kind of richer and
more<00:02:11.520> gold<00:02:11.730> so<00:02:11.910> if<00:02:12.030> I<00:02:12.120> tilt<00:02:12.330> it<00:02:12.510> back

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
more gold so if I tilt it back

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.300 
more gold so if I tilt it back
hold<00:02:13.710> up<00:02:13.800> pretty<00:02:14.010> well<00:02:14.100> oh<00:02:15.260> I<00:02:16.260> just<00:02:16.410> sent<00:02:17.040> her

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
hold up pretty well oh I just sent her

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.300 
hold up pretty well oh I just sent her
to<00:02:17.490> see<00:02:17.640> a<00:02:18.020> different<00:02:19.020> photo<00:02:19.260> here<00:02:19.590> while<00:02:19.800> you

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.760 
to see a different photo here while you
still<00:02:20.340> kind<00:02:20.790> of<00:02:20.850> get<00:02:21.000> the<00:02:21.410> point<00:02:22.410> here<00:02:22.620> well

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
still kind of get the point here well

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.080 
still kind of get the point here well
there<00:02:22.920> we<00:02:23.010> go<00:02:23.100> the<00:02:23.250> boy<00:02:23.370> now<00:02:23.520> we've<00:02:23.670> been<00:02:23.760> exact

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
there we go the boy now we've been exact

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.570

as<00:02:33.540> well<00:02:33.600> demonstrate<00:02:34.170> the<00:02:34.320> fact<00:02:34.470> that<00:02:34.620> I<00:02:34.710> also

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
as well demonstrate the fact that I also

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.000 
as well demonstrate the fact that I also
have<00:02:35.340> a<00:02:35.660> backlit<00:02:36.660> keyboard<00:02:36.720> on<00:02:37.230> the<00:02:37.350> x2<00:02:37.710> 30

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
have a backlit keyboard on the x2 30

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.600 
have a backlit keyboard on the x2 30
which<00:02:38.610> is<00:02:38.790> a<00:02:39.030> new<00:02:39.660> feature<00:02:39.930> is<00:02:40.140> a<00:02:40.170> $40<00:02:41.100> upgrade

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
which is a new feature is a $40 upgrade

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.540 
which is a new feature is a $40 upgrade
now<00:02:42.120> that's<00:02:42.390> a<00:02:42.510> standard<00:02:42.900> feature<00:02:43.170> on<00:02:43.470> the<00:02:44.190> x1

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
now that's a standard feature on the x1

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.970 
now that's a standard feature on the x1
carbon<00:02:44.910> so<00:02:45.900> you<00:02:46.020> can<00:02:46.200> see<00:02:46.410> it<00:02:46.530> there<00:02:46.770> if<00:02:46.890> I

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
carbon so you can see it there if I

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.300 
carbon so you can see it there if I
stand<00:02:47.310> up<00:02:47.550> and<00:02:48.350> of<00:02:49.350> course<00:02:49.590> you<00:02:49.770> get<00:02:49.920> the<00:02:50.070> same

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
stand up and of course you get the same

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.700 
stand up and of course you get the same
track<00:02:50.670> point<00:02:51.090> however<00:02:51.660> with<00:02:52.140> the<00:02:52.320> x1

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:52.710 
track point however with the x1

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.490 
track point however with the x1
carbonate<00:02:53.310> advantage<00:02:53.820> you<00:02:54.090> have<00:02:54.230> click<00:02:55.230> on

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
carbonate advantage you have click on

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.100 
carbonate advantage you have click on
the<00:02:55.620> light<00:02:55.770> back<00:02:56.010> on<00:02:56.190> here<00:02:56.520> is<00:02:56.670> you<00:02:57.360> get<00:02:57.540> a<00:02:57.600> much

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
the light back on here is you get a much

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.650 
the light back on here is you get a much
larger<00:02:58.800> touchpad<00:02:59.400> with<00:03:00.000> a<00:03:00.030> glass<00:03:00.360> surface

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
larger touchpad with a glass surface

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.830 
larger touchpad with a glass surface
it's<00:03:01.170> really<00:03:01.620> nice<00:03:01.770> to<00:03:01.980> use<00:03:02.570> meanwhile<00:03:03.570> over

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
it's really nice to use meanwhile over

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.760 
it's really nice to use meanwhile over
on<00:03:03.930> the<00:03:04.050> X<00:03:04.230> 230<00:03:04.830> much<00:03:05.760> smaller<00:03:06.150> touchpad<00:03:06.780> this

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
on the X 230 much smaller touchpad this

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.010 
on the X 230 much smaller touchpad this
is<00:03:07.890> a<00:03:07.950> different<00:03:08.370> like<00:03:08.490> dimpled<00:03:08.970> surface<00:03:09.150> just

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
is a different like dimpled surface just

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:13.040 
is a different like dimpled surface just
not<00:03:10.200> the<00:03:10.380> same<00:03:10.620> feel<00:03:10.980> maybe<00:03:11.880> half<00:03:12.240> the<00:03:12.510> size<00:03:12.750> of

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:13.050 
not the same feel maybe half the size of

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.670 
not the same feel maybe half the size of
that<00:03:13.320> in<00:03:13.650> terms<00:03:14.430> of<00:03:14.610> area<00:03:14.970> so<00:03:15.450> you<00:03:16.230> know<00:03:16.380> the

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
that in terms of area so you know the

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:17.630 
that in terms of area so you know the
the<00:03:17.010> x1<00:03:17.340> carbon

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
the x1 carbon

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.610 
the x1 carbon
definitely<00:03:18.090> has<00:03:18.209> a<00:03:18.240> superior<00:03:18.810> touch<00:03:19.200> bed<00:03:19.410> that

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
definitely has a superior touch bed that

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:22.070 
definitely has a superior touch bed that
would<00:03:19.800> be<00:03:19.920> great<00:03:20.130> for<00:03:20.160> Windows<00:03:20.640> 8<00:03:20.910> if<00:03:21.570> you<00:03:21.840> care

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
would be great for Windows 8 if you care

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:23.480 
would be great for Windows 8 if you care
about<00:03:22.200> Windows<00:03:22.590> 8<00:03:22.709> which<00:03:22.950> I<00:03:23.100> think<00:03:23.280> a<00:03:23.340> lot<00:03:23.459> of

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:23.490 
about Windows 8 which I think a lot of

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:27.530 
about Windows 8 which I think a lot of
business<00:03:23.850> users<00:03:24.180> don't<00:03:25.580> now<00:03:26.580> of<00:03:26.940> course<00:03:27.180> the<00:03:27.390> X

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
business users don't now of course the X

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.660 
business users don't now of course the X
230<00:03:27.990> since<00:03:28.440> it's<00:03:28.620> thicker<00:03:28.860> you<00:03:29.220> can<00:03:29.250> fit<00:03:29.520> more

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
230 since it's thicker you can fit more

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.100 
230 since it's thicker you can fit more
ports<00:03:30.030> you<00:03:30.180> still<00:03:30.390> don't<00:03:30.510> get<00:03:30.630> an<00:03:30.750> optical

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.110

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.080 
ports you still don't get an optical
drive<00:03:31.230> but<00:03:32.100> let's<00:03:32.280> look<00:03:32.400> what<00:03:32.580> you<00:03:32.700> do<00:03:32.880> get<00:03:33.060> on

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
drive but let's look what you do get on

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.470 
drive but let's look what you do get on
the<00:03:33.270> X<00:03:33.420> 230<00:03:33.870> relative<00:03:34.380> its<00:03:34.620> the<00:03:34.800> x1<00:03:35.310> carbon<00:03:35.670> but

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
the X 230 relative its the x1 carbon but

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.420 
the X 230 relative its the x1 carbon but
kind<00:03:36.720> of<00:03:36.840> like<00:03:37.080> turn<00:03:37.470> them<00:03:37.650> to<00:03:37.800> the<00:03:37.920> sides<00:03:38.160> here

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
kind of like turn them to the sides here

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.030 
kind of like turn them to the sides here
so<00:03:39.420> on<00:03:39.540> the<00:03:39.600> x1<00:03:40.050> carbon<00:03:40.290> on<00:03:40.530> the<00:03:40.560> left<00:03:40.830> hand

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
so on the x1 carbon on the left hand

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.100 
so on the x1 carbon on the left hand
side<00:03:41.220> you<00:03:41.340> get<00:03:41.430> the<00:03:41.580> power<00:03:41.790> jack<00:03:42.150> you<00:03:42.870> get<00:03:43.080> a

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:43.110 
side you get the power jack you get a

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:46.940 
side you get the power jack you get a

actually in terms of ports I mean not
too<00:04:41.759> too<00:04:42.180> different<00:04:42.629> but<00:04:42.979> the<00:04:43.979> big<00:04:44.159> difference

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
too too different but the big difference

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.179 
too too different but the big difference
that<00:04:44.669> you<00:04:45.060> will<00:04:45.300> see<00:04:45.599> if<00:04:46.349> I<00:04:46.590> flip<00:04:46.830> underneath

230<00:05:16.259> significantly<00:05:17.159> thicker<00:05:17.430> again<00:05:17.879> I<00:05:17.909> do

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 
230 significantly thicker again I do

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:22.119 
230 significantly thicker again I do
have<00:05:18.240> a<00:05:18.650> larger<00:05:19.650> cell<00:05:19.889> size<00:05:20.400> 6<00:05:20.969> cell<00:05:21.240> battery

00:05:22.119 --> 00:05:22.129 
have a larger cell size 6 cell battery

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:24.529 
have a larger cell size 6 cell battery
in<00:05:23.129> there<00:05:23.279> you<00:05:23.520> get<00:05:23.699> a<00:05:23.759> four<00:05:24.029> cell<00:05:24.270> that<00:05:24.419> would

00:05:24.529 --> 00:05:24.539 
in there you get a four cell that would

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:27.350 
in there you get a four cell that would
reduce<00:05:25.020> the<00:05:25.500> slope<00:05:25.889> of<00:05:26.219> this<00:05:26.460> and<00:05:26.759> the

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:27.360 
reduce the slope of this and the

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.420 
reduce the slope of this and the
thickness<00:05:27.810> but<00:05:28.199> it<00:05:28.529> would<00:05:28.650> still<00:05:28.949> be<00:05:28.979> thicker

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:29.430 
thickness but it would still be thicker

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:32.959 
thickness but it would still be thicker
now<00:05:29.819> it's<00:05:30.270> speaking<00:05:30.629> of<00:05:30.900> thickness<00:05:31.969> that's

00:05:32.959 --> 00:05:32.969 
now it's speaking of thickness that's

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:34.670 
now it's speaking of thickness that's
way<00:05:33.240> these<00:05:33.419> things<00:05:33.719> because<00:05:34.469> that's

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.680 
way these things because that's

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.529 
way these things because that's
obviously<00:05:34.889> in<00:05:35.400> a<00:05:35.490> portable<00:05:35.789> laptop<00:05:36.210> a<00:05:36.240> big

00:05:36.529 --> 00:05:36.539 
obviously in a portable laptop a big

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:39.379 
obviously in a portable laptop a big
concern<00:05:36.930> so<00:05:37.440> I<00:05:37.770> have<00:05:37.979> my<00:05:38.180> basic<00:05:39.180> kitchen

00:05:39.379 --> 00:05:39.389 
concern so I have my basic kitchen

00:05:39.389 --> 00:05:43.040 
concern so I have my basic kitchen
scales<00:05:39.870> over<00:05:40.139> here<00:05:40.469> fairly<00:05:41.069> accurate<00:05:41.639> and<00:05:42.150> as

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.050 
scales over here fairly accurate and as

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:44.480 
scales over here fairly accurate and as
I<00:05:43.169> turn<00:05:43.379> it<00:05:43.409> on<00:05:43.560> I'm<00:05:43.740> gonna<00:05:43.830> weigh<00:05:43.979> the<00:05:44.099> x1

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:44.490 
I turn it on I'm gonna weigh the x1

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:50.360 
I turn it on I'm gonna weigh the x1
carbon<00:05:44.849> first<00:05:46.159> and<00:05:47.159> go<00:05:47.629> so<00:05:48.629> it's<00:05:48.870> almost<00:05:49.370> three

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:50.370 
carbon first and go so it's almost three

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:52.129 
carbon first and go so it's almost three

that's<00:05:52.229> this<00:05:52.560> announces<00:05:53.099> they're<00:05:53.250> two<00:05:53.430> pounds

00:05:53.719 --> 00:05:53.729 
that's this announces they're two pounds

I<00:06:18.389> forgot<00:06:18.659> to<00:06:18.810> mention<00:06:18.930> has<00:06:19.349> a<00:06:19.379> screen

00:06:20.059 --> 00:06:20.069 
I forgot to mention has a screen

00:06:20.069 --> 00:06:22.550 
I forgot to mention has a screen

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:22.560 
resolution of 1600 by 900 so you fit

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.439 
resolution of 1600 by 900 so you fit
more<00:06:22.740> stuff<00:06:22.979> on<00:06:23.099> the<00:06:23.159> screen<00:06:23.520> there<00:06:23.729> which<00:06:24.270> is

00:06:24.439 --> 00:06:24.449 
more stuff on the screen there which is

00:06:24.449 --> 00:06:26.600 
more stuff on the screen there which is
a<00:06:24.479> nice<00:06:24.690> benefit<00:06:25.169> to<00:06:25.259> have<00:06:25.440> so<00:06:26.009> which<00:06:26.430> is

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:26.610 
a nice benefit to have so which is

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:28.790 
a nice benefit to have so which is
better<00:06:26.789> for<00:06:27.000> who<00:06:27.150> I<00:06:27.330> mean<00:06:27.599> you<00:06:28.050> know<00:06:28.169> the<00:06:28.409> x1

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:28.800 
better for who I mean you know the x1

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.879 
better for who I mean you know the x1
carbon<00:06:29.039> costs<00:06:29.669> more<00:06:29.789> obviously<00:06:30.300> around<00:06:31.229> 1100

00:06:31.879 --> 00:06:31.889 
carbon costs more obviously around 1100

00:06:31.889 --> 00:06:33.559

you<00:06:35.969> can<00:06:36.089> pick<00:06:36.210> up<00:06:36.330> around<00:06:36.449> 800<00:06:37.080> so<00:06:37.229> it's

00:06:37.369 --> 00:06:37.379 
you can pick up around 800 so it's

00:06:37.379 --> 00:06:39.350 
you can pick up around 800 so it's
cheaper<00:06:37.800> I<00:06:38.009> think<00:06:38.550> more<00:06:38.729> people<00:06:38.759> will<00:06:39.059> buy<00:06:39.300> the

cheaper I think more people will buy the

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:43.519 
cheaper I think more people will buy the
x2<00:06:39.899> 30<00:06:40.199> but<00:06:41.159> if<00:06:41.309> you're<00:06:41.520> into<00:06:41.909> cool<00:06:42.809> factor<00:06:43.319> and

00:06:43.519 --> 00:06:43.529 
x2 30 but if you're into cool factor and

00:06:43.529 --> 00:06:46.249 
x2 30 but if you're into cool factor and
slim<00:06:44.369> and<00:06:44.580> thin<00:06:44.639> the<00:06:45.419> x1<00:06:45.779> carbon<00:06:46.020> is

slim and thin the x1 carbon is

00:06:46.259 --> 00:06:49.070 
slim and thin the x1 carbon is

tinkering just you know the IPS screen
overall<00:07:01.050> I<00:07:01.080> think<00:07:01.199> the<00:07:01.409> x2<00:07:01.709> 30<00:07:01.919> is<00:07:02.069> a<00:07:02.129> little

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:02.610 
overall I think the x2 30 is a little

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:04.100 
overall I think the x2 30 is a little
better<00:07:02.729> opportunity<00:07:03.179> for<00:07:03.240> most<00:07:03.479> people<00:07:03.899> but

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:04.110 
better opportunity for most people but

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:06.559 
better opportunity for most people but
it<00:07:04.830> just<00:07:05.099> definitely<00:07:05.399> isn't<00:07:05.849> as<00:07:05.939> cool<00:07:06.149> as<00:07:06.360> the

00:07:06.559 --> 00:07:06.569 
it just definitely isn't as cool as the

00:07:06.569 --> 00:07:10.040 
it just definitely isn't as cool as the
x1<00:07:07.169> carbon<00:07:07.439> and<00:07:07.849> it's<00:07:08.849> kind<00:07:09.389> of<00:07:09.539> chunky

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:10.050 
x1 carbon and it's kind of chunky

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:11.600

a lot of practical people I think the x2
