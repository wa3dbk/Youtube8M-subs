couple days and I just want to go over

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.430 
couple days and I just want to go over
real<00:00:10.740> quick<00:00:10.950> point<00:00:11.370> out<00:00:11.870> if<00:00:12.870> you<00:00:13.049> look<00:00:13.230> right

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
real quick point out if you look right

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.519 
real quick point out if you look right
here<00:00:13.500> this<00:00:13.920> is<00:00:13.980> the<00:00:14.780> orbital<00:00:15.780> diagram<00:00:16.350> that

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
here this is the orbital diagram that

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.010 
here this is the orbital diagram that
we're<00:00:16.680> seeing<00:00:16.890> for<00:00:17.220> yu55<00:00:17.850> and<00:00:18.600> you<00:00:18.690> can<00:00:18.840> see

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
we're seeing for yu55 and you can see

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.870 
we're seeing for yu55 and you can see
they're<00:00:19.199> showing<00:00:19.590> that<00:00:19.740> it's<00:00:19.920> shooting<00:00:20.670> right

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
they're showing that it's shooting right

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.290 
they're showing that it's shooting right
pattern<00:00:21.300> past<00:00:21.630> us<00:00:21.900> which<00:00:22.710> really<00:00:23.490> is<00:00:23.850> not<00:00:24.119> the

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
pattern past us which really is not the

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.320 
pattern past us which really is not the
case<00:00:24.539> it's<00:00:25.320> it's<00:00:26.039> about<00:00:26.340> 30<00:00:26.640> degrees<00:00:26.789> above

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
case it's it's about 30 degrees above

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.320 
case it's it's about 30 degrees above
the<00:00:27.570> earth's<00:00:27.990> ecliptic<00:00:28.859> at<00:00:29.730> that<00:00:29.880> point<00:00:30.119> which

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
the earth's ecliptic at that point which

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.810 
the earth's ecliptic at that point which
is<00:00:30.359> right<00:00:30.869> about<00:00:31.080> right<00:00:31.320> on<00:00:31.470> but<00:00:31.769> now<00:00:32.550> if<00:00:32.669> we

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
is right about right on but now if we

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.650 
is right about right on but now if we
come<00:00:33.030> over<00:00:33.059> here<00:00:33.410> to<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.969> JPL<00:00:35.969> small<00:00:36.390> body

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
come over here to the JPL small body

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.810 
come over here to the JPL small body
database<00:00:37.550> we<00:00:38.550> can<00:00:38.730> see<00:00:39.000> that<00:00:39.420> its<00:00:39.660> orbit<00:00:40.820> puts

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
database we can see that its orbit puts

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:47.600 
database we can see that its orbit puts
us<00:00:42.090> puts<00:00:42.840> yu55<00:00:44.750> coming<00:00:45.750> around<00:00:46.070> Earth<00:00:47.070> in

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
us puts yu55 coming around Earth in

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.650 
us puts yu55 coming around Earth in
between<00:00:48.149> Earth<00:00:48.480> and<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.840> moon<00:00:50.390> right<00:00:51.390> here

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
between Earth and the moon right here

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:55.130 
between Earth and the moon right here
not<00:00:52.110> shooting<00:00:52.620> right<00:00:52.800> past<00:00:53.100> us<00:00:53.960> the<00:00:54.960> other

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
not shooting right past us the other

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.680 
not shooting right past us the other
thing<00:00:55.530> that's<00:00:55.820> really<00:00:56.820> really<00:00:57.120> bothering<00:00:57.660> me

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
thing that's really really bothering me

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.630 
thing that's really really bothering me
and<00:00:58.020> this<00:00:58.199> is<00:00:58.260> my<00:00:58.559> reason<00:00:58.890> for<00:00:59.250> making<00:00:59.340> the

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
and this is my reason for making the

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.490 
and this is my reason for making the
video<00:00:59.969> not<00:01:00.899> just<00:01:01.170> this<00:01:01.410> but<00:01:02.420> the<00:01:03.420> next<00:01:03.780> screen

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
video not just this but the next screen

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.700 
video not just this but the next screen
will<00:01:04.619> go<00:01:05.010> to<00:01:05.070> is<00:01:05.960> 0<00:01:08.330> apparently<00:01:09.330> we<00:01:09.450> had<00:01:09.659> a

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:09.710 
will go to is 0 apparently we had a

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:16.160 
will go to is 0 apparently we had a
crash<00:01:10.710> here<00:01:11.040> let's<00:01:11.580> reboot<00:01:11.970> this<00:01:13.880> part<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.170> 3d

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
crash here let's reboot this part the 3d

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.550 
crash here let's reboot this part the 3d
solar<00:01:16.470> system<00:01:17.630> we<00:01:18.630> print<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:18.990> load<00:01:19.229> up<00:01:19.380> here

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
solar system we print the load up here

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:25.600 
solar system we print the load up here
for<00:01:19.740> a<00:01:19.799> second

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:31.210 

stop<00:01:26.420> the<00:01:26.600> music

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.880 

let's<00:01:31.700> get<00:01:31.880> in<00:01:32.000> position<00:01:32.540> over<00:01:32.660> here

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.030 

now<00:01:37.460> they're<00:01:37.670> saying<00:01:37.909> that<00:01:38.060> the<00:01:38.780> moon<00:01:39.040> its

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
now they're saying that the moon its

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.560 
now they're saying that the moon its
hiding<00:01:40.400> behind<00:01:40.550> the<00:01:40.850> earth<00:01:41.060> and<00:01:41.240> this<00:01:41.420> is

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
hiding behind the earth and this is

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.910 
hiding behind the earth and this is
where<00:01:42.610> yu55<00:01:43.610> is<00:01:44.180> tracking<00:01:44.690> straight<00:01:45.350> past<00:01:45.680> us

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
where yu55 is tracking straight past us

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.370 
where yu55 is tracking straight past us
straight<00:01:46.250> towards<00:01:46.520> Jupiter<00:01:46.700> actually<00:01:47.380> very

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:48.380 
straight towards Jupiter actually very

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:51.070 
straight towards Jupiter actually very
interesting<00:01:48.500> there<00:01:49.100> but<00:01:49.610> really<00:01:50.000> it's<00:01:50.750> coming

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
interesting there but really it's coming

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.520 
interesting there but really it's coming
around<00:01:52.119> shooting<00:01:53.119> right<00:01:53.390> between<00:01:53.750> us<00:01:54.080> and<00:01:54.380> the

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
around shooting right between us and the

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.920 
around shooting right between us and the
move<00:01:54.740> coming<00:01:55.400> this<00:01:55.640> way<00:01:55.850> the<00:01:56.570> thing<00:01:56.780> that's

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:56.930 
move coming this way the thing that's

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:58.120 
move coming this way the thing that's
really<00:01:56.990> bothering<00:01:57.350> me<00:01:57.680> though<00:01:57.800> is<00:01:57.950> look<00:01:58.070> for

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:58.130 
really bothering me though is look for

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.270 
really bothering me though is look for
the<00:01:58.340> moon's<00:01:58.550> at<00:01:58.820> if<00:01:59.509> all<00:02:00.470> these<00:02:00.710> models<00:02:01.159> are

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
the moon's at if all these models are

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.770 
the moon's at if all these models are
correct<00:02:01.700> which<00:02:01.940> they're<00:02:02.150> all<00:02:02.270> showing<00:02:02.690> the

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
correct which they're all showing the

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.870 
correct which they're all showing the
same<00:02:03.020> thing<00:02:03.290> the<00:02:03.830> moon<00:02:04.040> is<00:02:04.220> behind<00:02:04.550> the<00:02:04.759> earth

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:04.880 
same thing the moon is behind the earth

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.840 
same thing the moon is behind the earth
and<00:02:05.210> we<00:02:05.810> should<00:02:06.020> have<00:02:06.200> a<00:02:06.229> crescent<00:02:06.800> moon<00:02:06.850> right

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:07.850 
and we should have a crescent moon right

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.419 
and we should have a crescent moon right
that's<00:02:08.330> what<00:02:08.509> it's<00:02:08.660> showing<00:02:08.979> what<00:02:09.979> bothers<00:02:10.399> me

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
that's what it's showing what bothers me

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:12.910 
that's what it's showing what bothers me
is<00:02:10.700> let's<00:02:11.660> go<00:02:11.780> to<00:02:11.840> the<00:02:11.989> next<00:02:12.170> street<00:02:12.440> screen

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
is let's go to the next street screen

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.540 
is let's go to the next street screen
over<00:02:13.070> here<00:02:13.180> the<00:02:14.180> moon<00:02:14.390> phases<00:02:15.280> look<00:02:16.280> at<00:02:16.430> this

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
over here the moon phases look at this

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.890 
over here the moon phases look at this
here<00:02:17.330> we<00:02:17.450> go<00:02:17.480> this<00:02:17.930> is<00:02:18.080> today<00:02:18.380> wednesday

an<00:02:24.650> almost<00:02:25.130> full<00:02:25.519> moon<00:02:25.760> tomorrow<00:02:26.120> and<00:02:27.100> friday

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:28.100 
an almost full moon tomorrow and friday

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.410 
an almost full moon tomorrow and friday
is<00:02:28.430> going<00:02:28.640> to<00:02:28.700> be<00:02:28.820> a<00:02:28.850> full<00:02:29.120> moon<00:02:30.790> so<00:02:31.790> why<00:02:32.120> then

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
is going to be a full moon so why then

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.699 
is going to be a full moon so why then
are<00:02:33.190> they<00:02:34.190> showing<00:02:34.489> us<00:02:35.110> the<00:02:36.110> moon<00:02:36.320> hiding

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
are they showing us the moon hiding

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:38.259 
are they showing us the moon hiding
behind<00:02:36.830> the<00:02:37.160> earth<00:02:37.280> and<00:02:37.519> that<00:02:37.850> we<00:02:38.000> should<00:02:38.180> only

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:38.269 
behind the earth and that we should only

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:40.810 
behind the earth and that we should only
have<00:02:38.510> a<00:02:38.540> crescent<00:02:39.019> moon<00:02:39.220> we<00:02:40.220> have<00:02:40.340> a<00:02:40.370> full<00:02:40.640> moon

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:40.820 
have a crescent moon we have a full moon

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:42.460 
have a crescent moon we have a full moon
that<00:02:40.970> means<00:02:41.630> the<00:02:41.750> moon<00:02:41.900> is<00:02:42.019> going<00:02:42.170> to<00:02:42.230> be<00:02:42.320> out

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
that means the moon is going to be out

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.620 
that means the moon is going to be out
here<00:02:42.680> somewhere<00:02:42.920> almost<00:02:43.700> right<00:02:44.000> in<00:02:44.269> the<00:02:44.390> path

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
here somewhere almost right in the path

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:50.319 
here somewhere almost right in the path
of<00:02:45.340> yu55<00:02:46.340> although<00:02:47.060> it<00:02:47.209> should<00:02:48.610> come<00:02:49.610> by<00:02:49.820> swing

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:50.329 
of yu55 although it should come by swing

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:52.780 
of yu55 although it should come by swing
by<00:02:50.480> right<00:02:50.870> over<00:02:51.290> the<00:02:51.410> moon<00:02:51.590> not<00:02:52.370> saying<00:02:52.670> that

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
by right over the moon not saying that

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.060 
by right over the moon not saying that
it's<00:02:52.910> going<00:02:53.060> to<00:02:53.120> hit<00:02:53.299> but<00:02:53.750> my<00:02:54.290> problem<00:02:54.500> is<00:02:54.799> that

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
it's going to hit but my problem is that

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.009 
it's going to hit but my problem is that
these<00:02:55.220> models<00:02:55.670> are<00:02:55.820> all<00:02:56.000> wrong<00:02:56.269> so<00:02:56.600> somebody's

00:02:57.009 --> 00:02:57.019 
these models are all wrong so somebody's

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:03.910 
these models are all wrong so somebody's
bsns<00:03:01.060> little<00:03:02.060> wider<00:03:02.269> here<00:03:02.600> you<00:03:03.530> see<00:03:03.709> what<00:03:03.829> I'm

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.650 
bsns little wider here you see what I'm
talking<00:03:03.950> about<00:03:04.250> now<00:03:04.730> we<00:03:04.790> should<00:03:04.940> if<00:03:05.329> this<00:03:05.510> is

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
the case and this model is correct we

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:10.960 
the case and this model is correct we
should<00:03:07.880> have<00:03:08.180> a<00:03:08.209> crescent<00:03:08.690> moon<00:03:09.280> but<00:03:10.280> I<00:03:10.459> hate

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
should have a crescent moon but I hate

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.699 
should have a crescent moon but I hate
to<00:03:11.060> tell<00:03:11.269> you<00:03:11.360> this<00:03:11.390> folks<00:03:11.780> it's<00:03:12.170> not<00:03:12.440> the<00:03:12.530> case

to tell you this folks it's not the case
that<00:03:12.769> all<00:03:13.070> the<00:03:13.190> moon<00:03:13.340> is<00:03:13.519> actually<00:03:13.700> sitting

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
that all the moon is actually sitting

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.080 
that all the moon is actually sitting
out<00:03:14.450> here<00:03:14.480> and<00:03:15.190> moving<00:03:16.190> into<00:03:16.340> a<00:03:16.519> hole<00:03:16.820> in<00:03:17.000> the

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
out here and moving into a hole in the
