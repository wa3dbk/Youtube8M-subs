adrenal<00:01:44.939> fatigue<00:01:45.060> is<00:01:45.630> a<00:01:46.140> definite<00:01:47.130> problem

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430

with competing and I think that occurs

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:52.800 
with competing and I think that occurs
when<00:01:52.170> compared

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
when compared

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.179

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:17.979 
just like I would switch up my workouts
especially<00:04:15.890> in<00:04:15.980> the<00:04:16.040> offseason<00:04:16.690> there<00:04:17.690> are<00:04:17.810> so

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:17.989 
especially in the offseason there are so

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:20.710 
especially in the offseason there are so
many<00:04:18.019> different<00:04:18.410> diets<00:04:19.250> that<00:04:19.790> I<00:04:20.209> like<00:04:20.510> to

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
many different diets that I like to

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:23.020 
many different diets that I like to
experiment<00:04:21.170> to<00:04:21.650> see<00:04:21.859> you<00:04:22.430> know<00:04:22.520> how<00:04:22.640> my<00:04:22.820> body

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
experiment to see you know how my body

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.000 
experiment to see you know how my body
reacts<00:04:23.420> to<00:04:23.570> certain<00:04:23.780> things<00:04:24.050> for<00:04:24.920> example

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
reacts to certain things for example

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:28.930 
reacts to certain things for example
right<00:04:25.310> now<00:04:25.460> I'm<00:04:25.940> carb<00:04:26.360> cycling<00:04:26.780> so<00:04:27.730> I'll<00:04:28.730> take

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940 
right now I'm carb cycling so I'll take

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:30.760 
right now I'm carb cycling so I'll take
a<00:04:28.970> couple<00:04:29.210> of<00:04:29.390> days<00:04:29.450> where<00:04:29.780> I<00:04:29.840> go<00:04:30.020> low<00:04:30.200> carb<00:04:30.530> and

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770 
a couple of days where I go low carb and

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.280 
a couple of days where I go low carb and
I<00:04:30.860> increase<00:04:31.400> the<00:04:31.820> amounts<00:04:32.450> of<00:04:32.600> fats<00:04:32.810> that<00:04:33.050> I'm

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:33.290 
I increase the amounts of fats that I'm

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:36.400 
I increase the amounts of fats that I'm
eating<00:04:33.620> and<00:04:33.800> I<00:04:34.790> do<00:04:35.630> that<00:04:35.870> on<00:04:35.960> days<00:04:36.140> that<00:04:36.290> I'm

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:36.410 
eating and I do that on days that I'm

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:39.760 
eating and I do that on days that I'm
not<00:04:36.560> sprinting<00:04:37.100> and<00:04:37.720> it<00:04:38.720> seems<00:04:39.230> to<00:04:39.350> be<00:04:39.500> working

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:39.770 
not sprinting and it seems to be working

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:41.380 
not sprinting and it seems to be working
out<00:04:40.070> well<00:04:40.310> like<00:04:40.520> I<00:04:40.730> think<00:04:40.970> I'm<00:04:41.090> getting<00:04:41.240> a

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:41.390 
out well like I think I'm getting a

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:43.150 
out well like I think I'm getting a
little<00:04:41.510> bit<00:04:41.690> leaner<00:04:41.900> from<00:04:42.260> just<00:04:42.710> doing<00:04:42.830> that

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
little bit leaner from just doing that

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.420 
little bit leaner from just doing that
and<00:04:43.400> then<00:04:43.610> you<00:04:44.540> know<00:04:44.660> go<00:04:44.900> back<00:04:45.110> to<00:04:45.380> a<00:04:45.710> lower<00:04:46.040> fat

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
and then you know go back to a lower fat

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.120 
and then you know go back to a lower fat
high<00:04:47.150> protein<00:04:47.260> moderate<00:04:48.260> carbohydrate<00:04:48.890> diet

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:49.130 
high protein moderate carbohydrate diet

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:52.510 
high protein moderate carbohydrate diet
so<00:04:49.850> yeah<00:04:50.330> mix<00:04:50.780> it<00:04:50.960> up<00:04:51.130> it<00:04:52.130> keeps<00:04:52.340> things

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:52.520 
so yeah mix it up it keeps things

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.810 
so yeah mix it up it keeps things
interesting<00:04:52.940> and<00:04:53.920> it<00:04:54.920> can<00:04:55.130> also<00:04:55.370> help<00:04:55.700> you

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:55.820 
interesting and it can also help you

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:59.170 
interesting and it can also help you
break<00:04:56.090> through<00:04:56.120> a<00:04:56.390> plateau<00:04:57.850> the<00:04:58.850> next

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
break through a plateau the next

that's late at night and I can't sleep
then<00:05:38.600> I'll<00:05:38.960> try<00:05:39.410> to<00:05:39.440> eat<00:05:39.620> more<00:05:39.980> vegetables

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:41.169 
then I'll try to eat more vegetables

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:44.830 
then I'll try to eat more vegetables
trying<00:05:42.169> to<00:05:42.230> eat<00:05:42.320> egg<00:05:42.530> whites<00:05:43.070> maybe<00:05:43.850> cottage

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:44.840 
trying to eat egg whites maybe cottage

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:47.380 
trying to eat egg whites maybe cottage
cheese<00:05:44.870> or<00:05:45.470> casein<00:05:45.890> protein<00:05:46.430> something

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:47.390 
cheese or casein protein something

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:48.909 
cheese or casein protein something
that's<00:05:47.540> a<00:05:47.660> little<00:05:47.780> bit<00:05:47.930> more<00:05:48.290> slower

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:48.919 
that's a little bit more slower

00:05:48.919 --> 00:05:51.820 
that's a little bit more slower
digesting<00:05:49.190> a<00:05:50.030> little<00:05:50.870> bit<00:05:50.960> lower<00:05:51.140> in<00:05:51.260> carbs

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:51.830 
digesting a little bit lower in carbs

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:53.740 
digesting a little bit lower in carbs
and<00:05:52.100> then<00:05:52.520> of<00:05:52.700> course<00:05:52.910> the<00:05:53.060> vegetables<00:05:53.570> with

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:53.750 
and then of course the vegetables with

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:55.700 
and then of course the vegetables with
their<00:05:53.900> high<00:05:54.050> water<00:05:54.320> content<00:05:54.590> and<00:05:55.130> high<00:05:55.220> fiber

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:55.710 
their high water content and high fiber

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:58.040 
their high water content and high fiber
content<00:05:56.130> will<00:05:56.700> help<00:05:56.910> keep<00:05:57.150> you<00:05:57.300> full<00:05:57.600> without

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.050 
content will help keep you full without

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:01.730 
content will help keep you full without
ingesting<00:05:58.470> a<00:05:58.770> lot<00:05:58.920> of<00:05:59.100> calories<00:06:00.020> so<00:06:01.020> those<00:06:01.560> are

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:01.740 
ingesting a lot of calories so those are

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.880 
ingesting a lot of calories so those are
some<00:06:02.010> tricks<00:06:02.610> that<00:06:02.910> I<00:06:02.970> use<00:06:03.680> hopefully<00:06:04.680> that

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:04.890 
some tricks that I use hopefully that

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:08.060 
some tricks that I use hopefully that
