00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
think you're going to start to see more

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.500

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:05.460 
certainly in the playoffs so it's going

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:06.830 
certainly in the playoffs so it's going
to<00:01:05.519> be<00:01:05.640> I<00:01:05.670> think<00:01:05.850> harder<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.510> come<00:01:06.659> up<00:01:06.810> with
