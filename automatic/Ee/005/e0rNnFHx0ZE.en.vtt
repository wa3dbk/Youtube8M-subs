innovations on display here but what

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:28.050 
innovations on display here but what
we're<00:00:26.890> talking<00:00:27.099> about<00:00:27.189> right<00:00:27.339> now<00:00:27.490> is<00:00:27.820> what<00:00:27.939> we

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:28.060 
we're talking about right now is what we

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:30.989 
we're talking about right now is what we
call<00:00:28.269> out<00:00:28.539> drive<00:00:28.869> which<00:00:29.829> is<00:00:30.039> a<00:00:30.070> technology

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:30.999 
call out drive which is a technology

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:32.580 
call out drive which is a technology
that<00:00:31.240> solves<00:00:31.599> the<00:00:31.869> problem<00:00:32.259> a<00:00:32.290> lot<00:00:32.410> of<00:00:32.500> people

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:32.590 
that solves the problem a lot of people

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.260 
that solves the problem a lot of people
don't<00:00:32.860> realize<00:00:32.920> to<00:00:33.489> make<00:00:33.610> a<00:00:33.640> waterproof

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:34.270 
don't realize to make a waterproof

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:36.450 
don't realize to make a waterproof
breathable<00:00:34.480> shoe<00:00:35.050> or<00:00:35.320> glove<00:00:35.650> there's

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:36.460 
breathable shoe or glove there's

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.459 
breathable shoe or glove there's
actually<00:00:36.970> an<00:00:37.030> insert<00:00:37.510> inside<00:00:37.870> that<00:00:38.140> does<00:00:38.320> the

00:00:38.459 --> 00:00:38.469 
actually an insert inside that does the

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:40.319 
actually an insert inside that does the
waterproofing<00:00:39.100> as<00:00:39.640> opposed<00:00:40.059> to<00:00:40.180> that

00:00:40.319 --> 00:00:40.329 
waterproofing as opposed to that

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:43.619 
waterproofing as opposed to that
membrane<00:00:40.920> being<00:00:41.920> rate<00:00:42.129> against<00:00:42.820> that<00:00:43.180> odor

00:00:43.619 --> 00:00:43.629 
membrane being rate against that odor

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:46.229 
membrane being rate against that odor
part<00:00:44.050> of<00:00:44.170> the<00:00:44.230> shoe<00:00:44.500> like<00:00:45.370> it<00:00:45.519> can<00:00:45.730> be<00:00:45.910> with<00:00:46.059> our

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:46.239 
part of the shoe like it can be with our

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:49.319 
part of the shoe like it can be with our
out<00:00:46.480> dry<00:00:46.750> process<00:00:47.519> and<00:00:48.519> you<00:00:48.609> might<00:00:48.760> think<00:00:48.969> so

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:49.329 
out dry process and you might think so

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:50.759 
out dry process and you might think so
what<00:00:49.510> you<00:00:49.719> know<00:00:49.840> that<00:00:50.260> doesn't<00:00:50.469> seem<00:00:50.590> like<00:00:50.739> a

00:00:50.759 --> 00:00:50.769 
what you know that doesn't seem like a

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:53.430 
what you know that doesn't seem like a
big<00:00:51.010> deal<00:00:51.120> well<00:00:52.120> the<00:00:52.210> problem<00:00:52.420> is<00:00:52.719> is<00:00:52.899> if<00:00:53.260> you

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:53.440 
big deal well the problem is is if you

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:55.950 
big deal well the problem is is if you
do<00:00:53.620> have<00:00:53.920> a<00:00:54.280> technique<00:00:55.059> that<00:00:55.090> uses<00:00:55.420> something

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960 
do have a technique that uses something

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.279 
do have a technique that uses something
like<00:00:56.140> the<00:00:56.649> booty<00:00:56.949> water<00:00:57.879> will<00:00:58.480> get<00:00:58.750> through

00:00:59.279 --> 00:00:59.289 
like the booty water will get through

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:00.299 
like the booty water will get through
those<00:00:59.410> other<00:00:59.589> materials<00:01:00.039> because<00:01:00.219> they're

00:01:00.299 --> 00:01:00.309 
those other materials because they're

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:02.910 
those other materials because they're
not<00:01:00.399> seam<00:01:00.699> sealed<00:01:01.030> and<00:01:01.329> so<00:01:02.079> water<00:01:02.289> can<00:01:02.500> pass<00:01:02.530> in

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
not seam sealed and so water can pass in

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.680 
not seam sealed and so water can pass in
there<00:01:03.100> and<00:01:03.280> now<00:01:03.370> it's<00:01:03.550> going<00:01:03.699> to<00:01:03.789> be<00:01:03.910> harboring

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:04.690 
there and now it's going to be harboring

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.320 
there and now it's going to be harboring
or<00:01:04.809> trapped<00:01:05.140> inside<00:01:05.760> and<00:01:06.760> once<00:01:06.880> you<00:01:07.000> get<00:01:07.120> water

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.330 
or trapped inside and once you get water

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:08.940 
or trapped inside and once you get water
in<00:01:07.480> the<00:01:07.570> system<00:01:07.870> even<00:01:08.170> if<00:01:08.230> it's<00:01:08.410> not<00:01:08.560> against

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950 
in the system even if it's not against

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:10.230 
in the system even if it's not against
your<00:01:09.070> product<00:01:09.430> you're<00:01:09.640> going<00:01:09.760> to<00:01:09.820> get<00:01:09.939> cold

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
your product you're going to get cold

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.030 
your product you're going to get cold
right<00:01:10.810> so<00:01:11.110> what<00:01:11.200> we<00:01:11.290> have<00:01:11.439> here<00:01:11.619> is<00:01:11.650> a<00:01:11.740> dunk

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.040 
right so what we have here is a dunk

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.100 
right so what we have here is a dunk
tank<00:01:12.270> so<00:01:13.270> that<00:01:13.299> we<00:01:13.509> could<00:01:13.659> just<00:01:13.720> show<00:01:14.079> people

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 
tank so that we could just show people

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.260 
tank so that we could just show people
if<00:01:14.619> they<00:01:14.770> start<00:01:15.040> making<00:01:15.280> snowballs<00:01:15.759> or

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
if they start making snowballs or

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:17.880 
if they start making snowballs or
whatever<00:01:16.540> with<00:01:16.780> their<00:01:16.960> regular<00:01:17.350> waterproof

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:17.890 
whatever with their regular waterproof

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:19.590 
whatever with their regular waterproof
glove<00:01:18.159> and<00:01:18.369> that<00:01:18.460> snow<00:01:18.759> melts<00:01:19.210> or<00:01:19.360> they're<00:01:19.509> out

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
glove and that snow melts or they're out

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:22.350 
glove and that snow melts or they're out
in<00:01:19.630> the<00:01:19.810> rain<00:01:19.990> or<00:01:20.860> you<00:01:21.040> fall<00:01:21.340> or<00:01:21.640> you<00:01:22.060> fall

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
in the rain or you fall or you fall

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:23.969 
in the rain or you fall or you fall
won't<00:01:22.659> take<00:01:22.840> long<00:01:23.020> for<00:01:23.079> water<00:01:23.439> to<00:01:23.590> start<00:01:23.799> to

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:23.979 
won't take long for water to start to

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:26.639 
won't take long for water to start to
work<00:01:24.159> itself<00:01:24.579> in<00:01:24.820> between<00:01:25.420> the<00:01:26.229> bladder

00:01:26.639 --> 00:01:26.649 
work itself in between the bladder

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:29.010 
work itself in between the bladder
inside<00:01:27.159> of<00:01:27.490> the<00:01:27.549> glove<00:01:27.790> and<00:01:28.030> those<00:01:28.810> other

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
inside of the glove and those other

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.300 
inside of the glove and those other
materials<00:01:29.470> so<00:01:29.560> we<00:01:29.649> have<00:01:29.740> this<00:01:29.829> little<00:01:30.009> clear

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310 
materials so we have this little clear

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:32.940 
materials so we have this little clear
window<00:01:30.640> so<00:01:30.820> you<00:01:30.880> can<00:01:30.970> see<00:01:31.240> that<00:01:31.270> and<00:01:31.950> that's

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
window so you can see that and that's

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.160 
window so you can see that and that's
going<00:01:33.159> to<00:01:33.220> start<00:01:33.399> to<00:01:33.490> make<00:01:33.579> you<00:01:33.700> feel<00:01:33.880> cold<00:01:34.170> and

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
going to start to make you feel cold and

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.230 
going to start to make you feel cold and
in<00:01:35.320> this<00:01:35.560> system<00:01:35.829> the<00:01:36.250> columbia<00:01:36.490> oak<00:01:37.000> drive

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
in this system the columbia oak drive

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.690 
in this system the columbia oak drive
system<00:01:37.659> allows<00:01:37.930> you<00:01:38.200> to<00:01:38.439> blow<00:01:39.040> the<00:01:39.250> membrane

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700 
system allows you to blow the membrane

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.080 
system allows you to blow the membrane
up<00:01:39.939> inside<00:01:40.360> of<00:01:40.570> the<00:01:40.630> product<00:01:41.079> and<00:01:41.229> then<00:01:42.090> adhere

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
up inside of the product and then adhere

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.120 
up inside of the product and then adhere
it<00:01:43.119> so<00:01:43.479> there<00:01:43.750> is<00:01:43.780> absolutely<00:01:44.290> no<00:01:44.500> gaps<00:01:44.799> and

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
it so there is absolutely no gaps and

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.249 
it so there is absolutely no gaps and
it's<00:01:45.250> all<00:01:45.460> seam<00:01:45.850> sealed<00:01:46.149> in<00:01:46.450> the<00:01:46.570> process<00:01:47.049> and

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:47.259 
it's all seam sealed in the process and

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:49.859 
it's all seam sealed in the process and
it<00:01:48.189> feels<00:01:48.490> a<00:01:48.789> lot<00:01:48.939> nicer<00:01:49.180> because<00:01:49.539> you<00:01:49.719> don't

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:49.869 
it feels a lot nicer because you don't

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:51.840 
it feels a lot nicer because you don't
have<00:01:49.930> that<00:01:50.170> water<00:01:50.439> get<00:01:50.649> in<00:01:50.740> there<00:01:50.890> doesn't

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
have that water get in there doesn't

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.700 
have that water get in there doesn't
feel<00:01:51.939> sloppy<00:01:52.329> or<00:01:52.600> cold<00:01:52.899> and<00:01:53.229> actually<00:01:53.619> your

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:55.659 
dexterity is pretty good too so it's

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:57.539 
dexterity is pretty good too so it's
easier<00:01:55.960> to<00:01:56.079> pinch<00:01:56.289> things<00:01:56.590> and<00:01:56.890> and<00:01:57.189> i'll<00:01:57.399> even

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:57.549 
easier to pinch things and and i'll even

I would think that your hands would also

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.550 
I would think that your hands would also
feel<00:02:01.030> like<00:02:01.090> less<00:02:01.450> heavy<00:02:01.780> because<00:02:02.110> you're

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:02.560 
feel like less heavy because you're

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.230 
feel like less heavy because you're
protecting<00:02:03.100> the<00:02:03.190> actual<00:02:03.520> globe<00:02:03.730> itself<00:02:04.030> oh

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
absolutely there's quite a bit of weight
