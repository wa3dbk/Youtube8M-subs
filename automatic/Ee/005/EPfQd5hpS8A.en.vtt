00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.789
 genetic information that means that 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.910

 pass by you in one column this 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.219
 will take about 30 years 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.350
 considering the growth rate of the population but already 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.260
 after two weeks they will appear on their tables 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.680
 thousands of bacteria and where 2500 tank cut out 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.689
 and 10 thousand bacteria between the legs do you know 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.030
 you what apple iphone best selling

 which by the way 43 quintillion 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:19.470
 252 quadrillion 3 trillion 274 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:22.320
 billion 489 million 856 thousand 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.850
 possible configurations almost like a deck 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.740
 cards that are after mixing 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.479

 existed nowhere and never in history 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.560
 how is it possible simple math 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.000

 while peanut butter under 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:50.040
 high pressure can turn 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.290

 coffee how strange it is the brain sounded 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.250
 he gave himself a mine and finally a physicist 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.380
 the student of atoms is really just 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:14.240
 a bunch of atoms that studies itself 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.070
 have a question you are concerned ask it in 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.090
