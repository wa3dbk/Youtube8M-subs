the iso is 405 point 0 you can see it

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.499 
the iso is 405 point 0 you can see it
start<00:01:14.580> to<00:01:14.610> get<00:01:14.790> very<00:01:14.820> white<00:01:15.390> it<00:01:15.540> out<00:01:15.720> here<00:01:16.280> for

it<00:03:02.069> back<00:03:02.250> down<00:03:02.400> to<00:03:02.819> maybe<00:03:03.030> a<00:03:03.150> 9<00:03:11.239> right<00:03:12.239> there

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
it back down to maybe a 9 right there

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.960 
it back down to maybe a 9 right there
yeah<00:03:12.989> we're<00:03:13.230> at<00:03:13.319> nine<00:03:13.530> point<00:03:13.829> 0<00:03:13.950> is<00:03:14.579> 0<00:03:14.760> four

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
yeah we're at nine point 0 is 0 four

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.940 
yeah we're at nine point 0 is 0 four
hundred<00:03:15.299> and<00:03:15.450> a<00:03:15.510> thousand<00:03:17.000> ok<00:03:18.380> so<00:03:19.380> now<00:03:19.739> i'm

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
hundred and a thousand ok so now i'm

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.620 
hundred and a thousand ok so now i'm
going<00:03:19.980> to<00:03:22.700> show<00:03:23.700> you<00:03:23.730> this<00:03:24.000> and<00:03:24.299> now<00:03:24.389> i'm<00:03:24.510> going

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
going to show you this and now i'm going

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.960 
going to show you this and now i'm going
to<00:03:24.690> try<00:03:24.810> to<00:03:24.900> focus<00:03:25.340> i'm<00:03:26.340> going<00:03:26.489> to<00:03:26.549> reset<00:03:26.880> the

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
to try to focus i'm going to reset the

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.940 
to try to focus i'm going to reset the
camera<00:03:27.120> i'm<00:03:27.329> going<00:03:27.450> to<00:03:27.540> focus<00:03:27.810> it<00:03:28.109> right<00:03:28.319> here

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
camera i'm going to focus it right here

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:30.440 
camera i'm going to focus it right here
on<00:03:29.160> the<00:03:29.370> roof<00:03:29.549> here<00:03:29.760> somewhere<00:03:30.060> at<00:03:30.150> the<00:03:30.180> side

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
on the roof here somewhere at the side

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:32.539 
on the roof here somewhere at the side
so<00:03:30.810> this<00:03:30.959> is<00:03:31.139> an<00:03:31.260> extreme<00:03:31.680> test<00:03:31.709> what<00:03:32.280> you<00:03:32.370> see

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
so this is an extreme test what you see

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:35.270 
so this is an extreme test what you see
or<00:03:32.579> is<00:03:32.790> a<00:03:32.819> dent<00:03:33.180> is<00:03:33.299> a<00:03:33.329> dangling<00:03:33.930> rope<00:03:34.170> end<00:03:34.950> in

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:35.280 
or is a dent is a dangling rope end in

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.460 
or is a dent is a dangling rope end in
the<00:03:35.670> wind<00:03:35.970> here<00:03:36.359> so<00:03:36.600> it<00:03:36.750> will<00:03:36.959> move<00:03:37.109> around<00:03:37.350> a

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
the wind here so it will move around a

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.780 
the wind here so it will move around a
little<00:03:37.560> bit<00:03:38.150> behind<00:03:39.150> it<00:03:39.510> is<00:03:39.660> a<00:03:39.690> large<00:03:40.019> tree<00:03:40.889> the

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
little bit behind it is a large tree the

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.180 
little bit behind it is a large tree the
focus<00:03:42.420> point<00:03:42.510> is<00:03:43.079> right<00:03:43.560> here<00:03:44.010> where<00:03:44.160> my

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190 
focus point is right here where my

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.440 
focus point is right here where my
finger<00:03:44.340> is<00:03:45.410> okay<00:03:46.410> so<00:03:46.470> i'm<00:03:47.370> gonna<00:03:47.639> i'm<00:03:48.090> showing

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
finger is okay so i'm gonna i'm showing

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.990 
finger is okay so i'm gonna i'm showing
you<00:03:48.569> the<00:03:48.780> extremes<00:03:49.319> of<00:03:49.620> the<00:03:49.769> camera<00:03:50.220> here<00:03:50.370> i<00:03:50.430> am

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
you the extremes of the camera here i am

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:57.320 
you the extremes of the camera here i am
manly<00:03:51.420> focusing<00:03:52.790> i'm<00:03:53.790> at<00:03:54.230> 1600<00:03:55.230> speed<00:03:55.650> ISO<00:03:56.250> 400

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
manly focusing i'm at 1600 speed ISO 400

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.650 
manly focusing i'm at 1600 speed ISO 400
and<00:03:57.420> 1.2<00:03:58.190> aperture<00:03:59.190> I<00:03:59.430> am<00:04:00.000> focused<00:04:00.390> on<00:04:00.480> the

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
and 1.2 aperture I am focused on the

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.040 
and 1.2 aperture I am focused on the
bottom<00:04:01.110> of<00:04:01.320> the<00:04:01.740> rope<00:04:02.520> here<00:04:02.790> again<00:04:03.060> so<00:04:03.960> I'm

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:04.050 
bottom of the rope here again so I'm

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:07.000 
bottom of the rope here again so I'm
going<00:04:04.080> to<00:04:04.230> cycle<00:04:04.440> through<00:04:04.650> the<00:04:05.610> modes<00:04:06.600> here

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:07.010 
going to cycle through the modes here

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:19.220 
going to cycle through the modes here
1.4<00:04:09.200> 1.8<00:04:10.220> 2<00:04:11.220> point<00:04:11.520> 0<00:04:13.880> and<00:04:17.480> you<00:04:18.480> can<00:04:18.630> see<00:04:18.870> that

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:19.230 
1.4 1.8 2 point 0 and you can see that

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:27.530 
1.4 1.8 2 point 0 and you can see that
it's<00:04:19.560> getting<00:04:19.950> darker<00:04:20.489> so<00:04:20.730> let<00:04:20.850> me<00:04:20.970> adjust<00:04:26.540> at

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
it's getting darker so let me adjust at

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:35.240 
it's getting darker so let me adjust at
five<00:04:27.840> point<00:04:28.140> 0<00:04:28.260> and<00:04:29.210> 320<00:04:33.230> ok<00:04:34.230> eight-point<00:04:35.100> oh

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:35.250 
five point 0 and 320 ok eight-point oh

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:37.690 
five point 0 and 320 ok eight-point oh
you<00:04:35.760> can<00:04:35.940> see<00:04:36.120> the<00:04:36.270> trees<00:04:36.540> are<00:04:36.750> coming<00:04:37.020> into

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:37.700 
you can see the trees are coming into

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:48.410 
you can see the trees are coming into
the<00:04:38.700> background<00:04:39.180> a<00:04:39.240> little<00:04:39.270> more<00:04:43.910> 250<00:04:45.920> 10<00:04:47.420> now

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:48.420 
the background a little more 250 10 now

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:49.940 
the background a little more 250 10 now
I'm<00:04:48.540> going<00:04:48.660> to<00:04:48.780> stop<00:04:49.020> it<00:04:49.260> and<00:04:49.380> double<00:04:49.650> check<00:04:49.800> my

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:49.950 
I'm going to stop it and double check my

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:53.860 
I'm going to stop it and double check my
focus<00:04:50.370> focus<00:04:50.580> is<00:04:50.940> still<00:04:51.150> good<00:04:51.360> i'm<00:04:51.630> at<00:04:51.810> 10<00:04:52.200> and

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:53.870 
focus focus is still good i'm at 10 and

00:04:53.870 --> 00:05:03.020 
focus focus is still good i'm at 10 and
250<00:04:54.870> I'm<00:04:55.710> gonna<00:04:55.860> keep<00:04:56.040> going<00:04:56.340> up<00:04:58.580> at<00:04:59.580> 13<00:05:00.090> now<00:05:02.030> 16

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030 
250 I'm gonna keep going up at 13 now 16

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:05.450 
250 I'm gonna keep going up at 13 now 16
and<00:05:03.570> it's<00:05:03.690> max<00:05:03.990> it's<00:05:04.230> going<00:05:04.380> to<00:05:04.440> go<00:05:04.590> i'm<00:05:04.830> at<00:05:04.950> 250

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 
and it's max it's going to go i'm at 250

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:11.780 
and it's max it's going to go i'm at 250
let's<00:05:05.640> adjust<00:05:05.970> the<00:05:06.150> speed<00:05:09.350> ok<00:05:10.350> i'm<00:05:10.770> at<00:05:10.950> 60<00:05:11.520> and

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:11.790 
let's adjust the speed ok i'm at 60 and

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:16.909 
let's adjust the speed ok i'm at 60 and
16<00:05:12.800> now<00:05:13.800> you<00:05:13.860> can<00:05:14.400> see<00:05:14.790> that<00:05:15.150> the<00:05:16.050> focus<00:05:16.710> point

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:16.919 
16 now you can see that the focus point

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:21.610 
16 now you can see that the focus point
is<00:05:17.310> certainly<00:05:17.790> still<00:05:18.120> on<00:05:18.390> the<00:05:19.790> dangling<00:05:20.790> rope

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:21.620 
is certainly still on the dangling rope

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:24.170 
is certainly still on the dangling rope
but<00:05:22.620> you<00:05:22.710> can<00:05:22.830> see<00:05:23.010> the<00:05:23.130> trees<00:05:23.430> much<00:05:23.940> more

00:05:24.170 --> 00:05:24.180 
but you can see the trees much more

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.090 
but you can see the trees much more
visible<00:05:24.360> in<00:05:24.660> the<00:05:24.750> background<00:05:25.200> now<00:05:25.350> this<00:05:25.650> is<00:05:25.860> at

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:26.100 
visible in the background now this is at

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:30.380 
visible in the background now this is at
the<00:05:26.250> extreme<00:05:26.790> of<00:05:27.060> the<00:05:27.419> camera<00:05:28.080> and<00:05:28.730> just<00:05:29.730> to

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:30.390 
the extreme of the camera and just to

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:31.700 
the extreme of the camera and just to
remind<00:05:30.510> you<00:05:30.780> again<00:05:30.900> i'm<00:05:31.140> going<00:05:31.200> to<00:05:31.350> go<00:05:31.470> all<00:05:31.680> the

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:31.710 
remind you again i'm going to go all the

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:43.010 
remind you again i'm going to go all the
way<00:05:31.950> down<00:05:32.070> to<00:05:37.790> so<00:05:38.790> 1.2<00:05:39.450> and<00:05:40.280> 4000<00:05:42.020> certainly

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:43.020 
way down to so 1.2 and 4000 certainly

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:44.960 
way down to so 1.2 and 4000 certainly
going<00:05:43.110> to<00:05:43.169> be<00:05:43.260> bright<00:05:43.620> and<00:05:43.830> you<00:05:44.580> can<00:05:44.729> no<00:05:44.790> longer

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:44.970 
going to be bright and you can no longer

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:46.520 
going to be bright and you can no longer
see<00:05:45.210> this<00:05:45.390> tree<00:05:45.750> so<00:05:45.930> you<00:05:46.020> get<00:05:46.169> that<00:05:46.290> background

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:46.530 
see this tree so you get that background

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:49.550 
see this tree so you get that background
blur<00:05:46.979> there<00:05:47.479> much<00:05:48.479> different<00:05:48.900> looking<00:05:49.050> you

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:49.560 
blur there much different looking you

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.110 
blur there much different looking you
actually<00:05:49.860> take<00:05:50.040> a<00:05:50.070> picture<00:05:50.490> but<00:05:50.520> this<00:05:50.850> is<00:05:51.000> what

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.120 
actually take a picture but this is what

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.300 
actually take a picture but this is what
it<00:05:51.180> looks<00:05:51.330> like<00:05:51.419> on<00:05:51.570> movie<00:05:51.900> mode<00:05:52.110> i'm<00:05:53.070> going<00:05:53.250> to

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:53.310 
it looks like on movie mode i'm going to
