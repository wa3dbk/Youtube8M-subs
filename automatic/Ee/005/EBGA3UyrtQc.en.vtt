expected a bump in technical specs but I

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.120 
expected a bump in technical specs but I
don't<00:01:06.450> think<00:01:06.659> one<00:01:06.840> was<00:01:07.049> necessarily<00:01:07.590> needed

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
don't think one was necessarily needed

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.730 
don't think one was necessarily needed
as<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.670> 920<00:01:09.270> was<00:01:09.479> a<00:01:09.510> very<00:01:09.780> snappy<00:01:10.080> device<00:01:10.500> and

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
as the 920 was a very snappy device and

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.730 
as the 920 was a very snappy device and
the<00:01:11.100> 925<00:01:11.729> will<00:01:12.000> be<00:01:12.150> as<00:01:12.360> well<00:01:12.630> keeping<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.619> old

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
the 925 will be as well keeping the old

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.710 
the 925 will be as well keeping the old
hardware<00:01:14.159> also<00:01:14.580> allowed<00:01:14.820> Nokia<00:01:15.270> to<00:01:15.420> have<00:01:15.570> the

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
hardware also allowed Nokia to have the

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.060 
hardware also allowed Nokia to have the
same<00:01:15.900> two<00:01:16.110> thousand<00:01:16.500> million<00:01:16.770> power<00:01:16.979> battery

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
same two thousand million power battery

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.789 
same two thousand million power battery
on<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.700> 925<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:18.600> that's<00:01:19.020> enough<00:01:19.350> to<00:01:19.530> get<00:01:19.680> the

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
on the 925 and that's enough to get the

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.740 
on the 925 and that's enough to get the
phone<00:01:19.979> through<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.340> day<00:01:20.490> alright<00:01:20.700> so<00:01:21.509> how

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
phone through the day alright so how

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.870 
phone through the day alright so how
does<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:22.110> 925<00:01:22.680> compared<00:01:23.070> to<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.340> iphone<00:01:23.460> 5

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
does the 925 compared to the iphone 5

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.749 
does the 925 compared to the iphone 5
well<00:01:24.600> first<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.380> iphone<00:01:25.770> is<00:01:25.799> a<00:01:25.979> smaller<00:01:26.460> and

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
well first the iphone is a smaller and

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.640 
well first the iphone is a smaller and
lighter<00:01:26.939> device<00:01:27.479> so<00:01:28.049> it<00:01:28.080> might<00:01:28.380> be<00:01:28.409> more

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
lighter device so it might be more

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.440 
lighter device so it might be more
comfortable<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:29.310> use<00:01:29.490> than<00:01:29.700> the<00:01:29.729> nokia<00:01:30.210> for

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
comfortable to use than the nokia for

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.630 
comfortable to use than the nokia for
many<00:01:30.689> of<00:01:30.869> us<00:01:31.049> aesthetically<00:01:31.950> both<00:01:32.340> devices

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
many of us aesthetically both devices

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.460 
many of us aesthetically both devices
are<00:01:32.850> gorgeous<00:01:33.420> and<00:01:33.630> it's<00:01:33.810> up<00:01:33.930> to<00:01:33.960> you<00:01:34.140> to<00:01:34.170> pick

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
are gorgeous and it's up to you to pick

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.800 
are gorgeous and it's up to you to pick
which<00:01:34.710> one<00:01:34.890> you<00:01:35.040> like<00:01:35.250> best<00:01:35.490> of<00:01:35.729> course<00:01:36.479> there

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
which one you like best of course there

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.840 
which one you like best of course there
is<00:01:36.930> a<00:01:36.960> smaller<00:01:37.409> 4-inch<00:01:37.890> screen<00:01:38.040> on<00:01:38.369> the<00:01:38.490> iPhone

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
is a smaller 4-inch screen on the iPhone

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.149 
is a smaller 4-inch screen on the iPhone
hence<00:01:39.329> it's<00:01:39.509> more<00:01:39.689> compact<00:01:40.049> body<00:01:40.259> but<00:01:40.890> it's<00:01:41.040> a

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
hence it's more compact body but it's a
