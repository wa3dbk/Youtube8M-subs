00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.919
 hi i am hugo rock one of the founders the problem itself and this video will speak 

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:08.540
 about how this site was born if it eats can make you a potential buyer of 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:11.639
 furniture at a price below market value 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.639
 well reflections well with the pressure 

00:00:15.409 --> 00:00:19.029
 provides tools and knowledge that simplified the process 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:20.200
 furniture purchase 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:23.610
 with up to 40% off its real market value 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:24.880
 nor in furniture 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.369
 for anyone 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.949
 be a professional investor 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.010
 good someone who wants to buy their first property to live in 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:34.430
 now 40% off 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.370
 too good to be true 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.890
 this is where I know that at first glance it has first-class real estate by 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.890
 up to 40% less than what it's worth 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.010
 too good to be true 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.950
 after all, most people are accustomed to paying the market price and 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:49.750
 mobile 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.490
 even I believed that I could only buy real estate for the price of 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.170
 market until in a bar conversation 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.490
 I already found a fiduciary agent 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.900
 already the lawyer that organizes the legal procedures next to her 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.110
 and after a ball is nice talk with this fiduciary agent 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:06.720
 he told me 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.720
 what happened in the backstage of lions 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.939
 kian almost fell behind 

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:13.920
 when he told me 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.950
 the number of prime real estate that exits up to 40% below the 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.270
 market value 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.830
 three days after I went to an auction and I could see with my own 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.700
 eyes some real estate come out really cheap 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.140
 because in the room alone four people 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.140
 the auctioneer the fiduciary agent in another killing 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.920
 with from then on I will become an investor in leixões and nowadays 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.479
 I divide my time where I exist and give tips on the subject through prouni 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:43.580
 in the country 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.780
 now Socrates seems 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:46.680
 first 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.110
 I'm not 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.070
 and I do not intend to be diluted 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.190
 I respect 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.560
 very profession but my business and to top it off 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.460
 and not improve 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.940
 second 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.200
 never received and do not intend to receive electoral commissions for the material 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.430
 profile 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.080
 this site was made by an investor 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.899
 for investors 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.919
 but I'm also an investor because I like my time and energy goes 

00:02:12.919 --> 00:02:15.899
 provide knowledge tools 

00:02:15.899 --> 00:02:20.519
 doubts of buyers who by the way are the potential competitors in the 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:23.519
 traditional perspective of spending 

00:02:25.899 --> 00:02:29.049
 some time I read a book called a thousand dead 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:32.830
 rework and Portuguese that by the way is unfortunately still do not think this 

00:02:32.829 --> 00:02:34.869
 level available in Portuguese in Brazil 

00:02:34.869 --> 00:02:37.930
 Finally, this book is very famous in the United States and in Europe. 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:42.489
 and specifically in the chapter will be the worst goes proof 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:45.849
 which in Portuguese could be a success 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:46.949
 the authors point out 

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:50.059
 order against the habit of creating something and it was a dream 

00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:54.339
 My most interesting story that I think is always there 

00:02:54.339 --> 00:02:56.079
 was the strong yen 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:58.249
 reinforcement and knowledge of the model 

00:02:58.249 --> 00:02:59.199
 ford b 

00:02:59.199 --> 00:03:02.479
 the first car to be mass-produced in a 

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:04.889
 founder of the company was 

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:08.139
 or as the best known agent 

00:03:08.139 --> 00:03:10.399
 but this happens via acb 

00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:15.289
 but did you know silvia is strong also invented the mass production of 

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:16.459
 coal 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:17.820
 it is true 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.470
 the ford and took the pieces of wood left over from the production of the cars 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.559
 transformed into his position 

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:25.459
 to be used for cooking 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:27.189
 and here is house cement 

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:29.400
 and this secondary business 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.779
 based products 

00:03:31.779 --> 00:03:33.019
 unfortunate 

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:35.909
 who then founded a company just to take care of it 

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:37.929
 the ford according to pedro 

00:03:37.929 --> 00:03:39.139
 then it became 

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:40.529
 house loft 

00:03:40.529 --> 00:03:44.219
 which is to this day the largest coal company in the United States 

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:49.139
 now obviously the intention of this business is not to enter the 

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:52.930
 production and sale of coal but this mission becomes a people if not 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:54.029
 introduces us 

00:03:54.029 --> 00:03:55.709
 finally scored 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:59.549
 he ate business and today owns products that are produced are these 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:00.180
 themes 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.430
 strategies and tactics that the customer will initially facilitate my 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.199
 life as an investor in auctions 

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:07.150
 tokyo 8 

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:10.459
 has the role of forming other successful investors millions of 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:11.439
 dead 

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:14.599
 then this time with dementia 

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:16.900
 I heard you split up with some people 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.040
 who are actually engaged in occupied lands again 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:24.360
 now with this product 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.610
 they are not available on the market all the time 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:31.099
 impunity to acquire them is quite 

00:04:31.099 --> 00:04:32.610
 controlled 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:38.159
 but now you can access the premium area of ​​silas for free 

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:42.110
 you will have access to several videos that explain various points 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:43.419
 cork and death 

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:45.110
 with for example 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:47.360
 the two risks of accident at auction 

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:50.379
 and how conceptual of used in their favor 

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:51.509
 or yet 

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:53.990
 what is it that the auctions of the federal economic box 

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:55.539
 so little 

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:59.229
 and because most people are not aware of the existence of September 

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:02.099
 enter prize area websites 

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:05.930
 just log in for free using your defensive power 

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:10.279
 this is the first step to get sack 

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:12.720
 I took the other side
