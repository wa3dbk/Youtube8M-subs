and the reason why I kind of brought
this<00:01:26.939> one<00:01:27.150> out<00:01:27.360> is<00:01:27.540> because<00:01:27.900> my<00:01:28.320> skin<00:01:28.530> is<00:01:28.680> very

pretty but this one is just a great
everyday<00:01:36.210> blush<00:01:36.869> because<00:01:37.110> it<00:01:37.350> is<00:01:37.500> more<00:01:37.920> matte

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
everyday blush because it is more matte

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.340

and for someone who has oily skin that's

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.770 
and for someone who has oily skin that's
it's<00:01:40.740> probably<00:01:41.100> a<00:01:41.130> better<00:01:41.280> option<00:01:41.579> so<00:01:42.210> it's

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
it's probably a better option so it's

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.870 
it's probably a better option so it's
just<00:01:42.930> a<00:01:43.110> really<00:01:43.439> pretty<00:01:43.590> like<00:01:44.070> true<00:01:44.399> coral

face wash and then you're rubbing at
your<00:04:50.820> eyes<00:04:51.000> and<00:04:51.330> then<00:04:51.389> just<00:04:51.600> your<00:04:51.780> teeth<00:04:51.990> them

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:06.379 
still s'posed to wear a moisturizer
because<00:06:04.770> kind<00:06:05.010> of<00:06:05.190> when<00:06:05.820> you<00:06:05.910> don't<00:06:06.210> use<00:06:06.360> the

00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:06.389 
because kind of when you don't use the

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:08.120 
because kind of when you don't use the
moisturizer<00:06:06.840> your<00:06:07.110> skin<00:06:07.169> is<00:06:07.530> just<00:06:07.560> over

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:08.130 
moisturizer your skin is just over

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:10.510 
moisturizer your skin is just over
producing<00:06:08.700> oil<00:06:08.849> even<00:06:09.300> more<00:06:09.539> so

00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:10.520 
producing oil even more so

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:12.370 
producing oil even more so
I've<00:06:10.789> learned<00:06:11.360> that<00:06:11.449> the<00:06:11.569> hard<00:06:11.599> way<00:06:11.960> and<00:06:12.169> I

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:12.380 
I've learned that the hard way and I

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:15.219 
I've learned that the hard way and I
really<00:06:12.410> do<00:06:13.180> even<00:06:14.180> though<00:06:14.360> I<00:06:14.720> feel<00:06:15.020> like

00:06:15.219 --> 00:06:15.229 
really do even though I feel like

00:06:15.229 --> 00:06:16.809 
really do even though I feel like
sometimes<00:06:15.500> moisturizers<00:06:16.340> can<00:06:16.460> be<00:06:16.610> a<00:06:16.639> little

00:06:16.809 --> 00:06:16.819 
sometimes moisturizers can be a little

00:06:16.819 --> 00:06:19.420 
sometimes moisturizers can be a little
bit<00:06:17.000> greasy<00:06:17.479> or<00:06:17.539> heavy<00:06:17.630> on<00:06:17.960> my<00:06:18.110> skin<00:06:18.500> I've

bit greasy or heavy on my skin I've
noticed<00:06:19.940> a<00:06:20.030> big<00:06:20.240> difference<00:06:20.630> like<00:06:20.750> when<00:06:20.870> I

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:20.900 
noticed a big difference like when I

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:22.629 
noticed a big difference like when I
wake<00:06:21.110> up<00:06:21.289> in<00:06:21.470> the<00:06:21.560> morning<00:06:21.889> I'm<00:06:22.009> not<00:06:22.039> as<00:06:22.400> oily

great<00:06:35.000> moisturizer<00:06:35.270> it's<00:06:35.840> been<00:06:36.139> lasting<00:06:36.620> me

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:36.740 
great moisturizer it's been lasting me

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:40.360 
great moisturizer it's been lasting me
forever<00:06:37.009> so<00:06:38.110> it's<00:06:39.110> about<00:06:39.380> halfway<00:06:39.680> gone<00:06:40.099> and

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:40.370 
forever so it's about halfway gone and

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:42.490 
forever so it's about halfway gone and
I've<00:06:40.460> been<00:06:40.610> using<00:06:40.789> it<00:06:41.060> all<00:06:41.300> summer<00:06:41.780> it's

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:44.890 
I've been using it all summer it's
definitely<00:06:42.860> worth<00:06:43.099> the<00:06:43.580> money<00:06:44.090> I<00:06:44.449> think<00:06:44.780> it

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:44.900 
definitely worth the money I think it

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:46.899 
definitely worth the money I think it
was<00:06:44.990> around<00:06:45.229> $30<00:06:46.099> but<00:06:46.490> for<00:06:46.699> a<00:06:46.759> good

00:06:46.899 --> 00:06:46.909 
was around $30 but for a good

00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:49.749 
was around $30 but for a good
moisturizer<00:06:47.449> you<00:06:47.780> know<00:06:47.979> so<00:06:48.979> yeah<00:06:49.430> it's<00:06:49.639> just
