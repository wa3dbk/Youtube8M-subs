00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:11.440 
this volkswagen carburetor out first

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.190 
this volkswagen carburetor out first
before<00:00:11.769> I<00:00:11.980> start<00:00:12.040> welding<00:00:12.610> I<00:00:13.599> know<00:00:13.929> the

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:14.200 
before I start welding I know the

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.930 
before I start welding I know the
accelerator<00:00:14.290> pump<00:00:14.950> works<00:00:15.309> it's<00:00:15.790> just

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:15.940 
accelerator pump works it's just

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:17.580 
accelerator pump works it's just
probably<00:00:16.240> not<00:00:16.540> necessary<00:00:17.080> to<00:00:17.170> take<00:00:17.349> that

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:17.590 
probably not necessary to take that

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:19.260 
probably not necessary to take that
apart<00:00:17.980> and<00:00:18.130> I'm<00:00:18.279> not<00:00:18.489> concerned<00:00:18.700> about<00:00:19.060> the

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:19.270 
apart and I'm not concerned about the

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:21.210 
apart and I'm not concerned about the
choke<00:00:19.630> working<00:00:20.169> because<00:00:20.439> it<00:00:20.739> seems<00:00:20.980> to<00:00:21.099> be

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:21.220 
choke working because it seems to be

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.339 
choke working because it seems to be
working<00:00:21.550> fine<00:00:21.759> what<00:00:22.630> I'm<00:00:22.750> going<00:00:22.930> to<00:00:22.960> do<00:00:23.050> is<00:00:23.140> pop

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:23.349 
working fine what I'm going to do is pop

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:26.339 
working fine what I'm going to do is pop
this<00:00:23.590> off<00:00:23.860> of<00:00:24.070> here<00:00:24.099> and<00:00:25.349> something

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:26.349 
this off of here and something

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:31.560 
this off of here and something
stopped-up<00:00:26.860> probably<00:00:27.669> where<00:00:27.910> my<00:00:29.070> air<00:00:30.149> fuel<00:00:31.149> or

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:31.570 
stopped-up probably where my air fuel or

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:33.090 
stopped-up probably where my air fuel or
I<00:00:31.630> can't<00:00:32.169> explain<00:00:32.529> it<00:00:32.739> but<00:00:32.770> there's<00:00:33.040> a

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.100 
I can't explain it but there's a

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.280 
I can't explain it but there's a
passageway<00:00:33.520> between<00:00:33.820> the<00:00:34.120> tank<00:00:34.360> and<00:00:34.630> the

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:35.290 
passageway between the tank and the

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:36.900 
passageway between the tank and the
carburetor<00:00:35.650> that's<00:00:35.980> plugged<00:00:36.340> and<00:00:36.640> I'm<00:00:36.730> going

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.060 

alright<00:01:23.660> I'll<00:01:23.810> show<00:01:24.050> you<00:01:24.110> all<00:01:24.230> this<00:01:24.500> I<00:01:24.740> popped

the<00:01:25.250> top<00:01:25.460> off<00:01:25.760> of<00:01:26.030> here<00:01:26.240> lifted<00:01:26.720> the<00:01:26.810> lid<00:01:26.990> off

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:27.260 
the top off of here lifted the lid off

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.220 
the top off of here lifted the lid off
the<00:01:27.590> float<00:01:27.890> was<00:01:28.160> down<00:01:28.430> in<00:01:28.670> here<00:01:29.000> and<00:01:29.750> I<00:01:30.170> don't

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:30.230 
the float was down in here and I don't

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:31.690 
the float was down in here and I don't
know<00:01:30.500> if<00:01:30.560> you<00:01:30.650> can<00:01:30.800> see<00:01:31.040> down<00:01:31.220> in<00:01:31.400> there<00:01:31.490> not

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:31.700 
know if you can see down in there not

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.430 
know if you can see down in there not
but<00:01:31.850> it<00:01:31.940> was<00:01:32.000> right<00:01:32.270> karati<00:01:32.690> when<00:01:32.990> I<00:01:33.020> poured

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:33.440 
but it was right karati when I poured

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.900 
but it was right karati when I poured
that<00:01:33.620> little<00:01:33.890> bit<00:01:33.980> of<00:01:34.010> gas<00:01:34.280> that<00:01:34.490> was<00:01:34.610> still<00:01:34.880> in

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:34.910 
that little bit of gas that was still in

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.840 
that little bit of gas that was still in
there<00:01:35.210> out<00:01:35.420> a<00:01:35.450> lot<00:01:35.990> of<00:01:36.140> dirt<00:01:36.590> and<00:01:36.830> stuff<00:01:37.130> I<00:01:37.400> can

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
there out a lot of dirt and stuff I can

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:39.700 
there out a lot of dirt and stuff I can
see<00:01:38.120> it<00:01:38.240> down<00:01:38.420> in<00:01:38.660> there<00:01:38.900> so<00:01:39.170> if<00:01:39.260> I<00:01:39.380> can<00:01:39.500> see<00:01:39.680> it

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
see it down in there so if I can see it

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.110 
see it down in there so if I can see it
in<00:01:39.890> there<00:01:40.070> and<00:01:40.220> if<00:01:40.280> I<00:01:40.400> can<00:01:40.430> see<00:01:40.700> it<00:01:40.790> floating

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:41.120 
in there and if I can see it floating

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.470 
in there and if I can see it floating
around<00:01:41.180> in<00:01:41.450> the<00:01:41.630> gas<00:01:42.520> then<00:01:43.520> it's<00:01:43.910> probably

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:44.480 
around in the gas then it's probably

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:53.430 
around in the gas then it's probably
floated<00:01:44.840> around<00:01:45.050> into<00:01:45.860> the<00:01:48.370> valve<00:01:51.310> passageway

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
floated around into the valve passageway

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.280 
floated around into the valve passageway
see<00:01:54.440> there's<00:01:54.650> some<00:01:54.800> of<00:01:54.890> it<00:01:55.010> on<00:01:55.100> my<00:01:55.220> finger<00:01:55.610> and

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:56.290 
see there's some of it on my finger and

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.950 
see there's some of it on my finger and
stopped<00:01:57.290> it<00:01:57.470> up<00:01:57.619> so<00:01:57.979> I'm<00:01:58.790> gonna<00:01:59.000> take<00:01:59.450> this<00:01:59.720> out

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
stopped it up so I'm gonna take this out

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.500 
stopped it up so I'm gonna take this out

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:01.510 
and this all these little dude

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:03.370 
and this all these little dude
passageways<00:02:02.510> I'm<00:02:02.750> going<00:02:02.869> to<00:02:02.930> clean<00:02:03.110> them<00:02:03.229> all

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
passageways I'm going to clean them all

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.800 
passageways I'm going to clean them all
out<00:02:04.030> and<00:02:05.030> then<00:02:05.330> we'll<00:02:05.540> see<00:02:06.410> she<00:02:06.590> runs
