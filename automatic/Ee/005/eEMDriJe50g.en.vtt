00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.919
 friends I wanted you I'll teach another 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.779
 pileup like the one who bought me this 

00:00:04.919 --> 00:00:09.179
 time is to directly connect the 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.759
 sata hard drives to the computer for a 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:15.599
 by usb this is a jump to 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:17.730
 quick by xt usb 3.0 say let's have 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:22.620
 the maximum speed can be said in 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:25.800
 usb and how are we going to get married with 

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:27.539
 known and good seen in the offer and 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.939
 I bought it 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.510
 here we see what we have we are going to 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:39.050
 connect the hard drives allows so much 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:39.050
 of three a half like 50 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:46.149
 of 25 and 35 3 1 of 3 with 5 that the big thing 

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:47.829
 the 25 are the little ones that are 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:50.379
 normally those who take for example 

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:52.149
 the portable hard drives because I 've 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:53.829
 bought because I have several discs 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:57.280
 hard of other computers these are from 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:59.350
 500 GB and then at the end when 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.420
 they change your computer because many 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.190
 sometimes the hard drives with the removers 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.320
 Well you have information but not the 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:09.060
 you put the computer does not have the gap and 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:13.799
 Well I bought it for that is 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.799
 a feeling of simply using 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:19.590
 what you have to do is connect the 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.950
 hard disk 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.649
 to the base 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:27.020
 and with that we would have available 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:29.180
 as if it were a sb a pendrive 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.799
 normal good behind the 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.950
 characteristics then what I have 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:32.950
 commented 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:36.910
 and enable the direct connection of a 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:38.620
 sata hard drive to your pc but we do not have 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:41.530
 to be connecting the inside of the pc 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:45.220
 be suitable for 2.5 and 3 with 5 as we have 

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:48.430
 said usb 3.0 and usb 2.0 is compatible 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:50.470
 with the two in case of 3.0 allows up 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.660
 5 gigas that will allow us 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.610
 even use it for web assets that 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:56.560
 they already have the possibility to connect 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.540
 hard drives this new for example 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.970
 now it puts access with things there 

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.500
 shopping internet games, only 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:05.920
 It has 500 gigabytes, if you want 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.180
 expand capacity like you can not 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.250
 change the hard drive as the 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.050
 playstation 4 well one thing of these 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.610
 Well, it can serve you and you are buying 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.240
 he said hard bigger and you already have them 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:18.000
 there stuck 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:20.280
 high quality fabrications something 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.100
 where I was writing stopped a led to 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.160
 see if the hard drive is on and 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:28.950
 good on windows and operating systems 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:31.320
 contents to let's see what it takes 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.670
 four tidbits as I said is not 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.410
 one thing 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.590
 very simple let's see where it is 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.590
 opens 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.099
 is the base 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.000
 we have an idea of ​​installation 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:56.079
 that the only thing that tells us is that is 

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:59.170
 you have to put the hard drive in 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:03:01.420
 connection because it goes to the network since these 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.159
 discs they usually need something 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:05.980
 more electricity than what the 

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:08.650
 club you see a usb cable had at 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:11.560
 computer and it's already first 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:13.420
 turn to have it is to the 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.850
 see what we have the hard drive and 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:18.660
 turn it off before removing the hard drive 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:18.660
 let's see it 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:28.239
 here we have 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:37.340
 the cable at the same time be pretty hat 

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:37.340
 I dont know 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.800
 many times why do not they try to do it 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:45.060
 smaller because in the end this does not 

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:45.060
 you need so much electricity 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:49.829
 quite long that's the important thing 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:04:02.690
 it's quite normal if we lose 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:06.400
 or spoiled signs get a new one 

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:10.950
 the cable looks like it 's kind of the d 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.950
 draft I do not know exactly power 

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:15.300
 obliged 

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:28.040
 to look at what connections as connection 

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:31.960
 this goes to the apparatus 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.960
 and then the usb 

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:40.350
 this 

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:44.960
 is not mocked for the truth is that 

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:44.960
 we are very close to the computer 

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:48.890
 and then finally 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:56.740
 it has a weight 

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:58.630
 what is much he is not that either 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:00.820
 so light as to go to that the 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:03.770
 power button off the connection 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:07.940
 usb 3.0 and here 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:10.670
 It would be as simple as taking the disk 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:12.740
 here we have the pins here inside 

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:14.330
 these two pins we want this closes 

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:17.800
 speak depending on whether we take one 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:17.800
 of 2.5 of three medium 

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:28.909
 Well, I'm going to try it, we've already 

00:05:27.199 --> 00:05:29.889
 state let's discuss at the beginning 

00:05:28.909 --> 00:05:31.960
 does not have any 

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:34.889
 no mystery we see in the 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.889
 next video see you later
