console sold like 55 million units and
it<00:02:28.570> was<00:02:28.690> definitely<00:02:28.900> not<00:02:29.170> a<00:02:29.200> failure<00:02:29.530> the

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
it was definitely not a failure the

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.590 
it was definitely not a failure the
veena<00:02:30.070> is<00:02:30.220> definitely<00:02:30.760> unattractive<00:02:30.850> being<00:02:31.480> a

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:31.600 
veena is definitely unattractive being a

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:33.690 
veena is definitely unattractive being a
failure<00:02:31.840> so<00:02:32.320> so<00:02:32.920> needs<00:02:33.220> to<00:02:33.280> do<00:02:33.430> something

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
failure so so needs to do something

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.000 
failure so so needs to do something
other<00:02:34.000> than<00:02:34.150> just<00:02:34.600> a<00:02:34.720> price<00:02:34.930> drop<00:02:35.110> I<00:02:35.380> do<00:02:35.650> think

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
other than just a price drop I do think

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:38.580 
other than just a price drop I do think
fifty<00:02:36.370> dollars<00:02:36.700> was<00:02:36.880> a<00:02:36.910> little<00:02:37.210> pussy<00:02:37.750> of<00:02:37.780> Sony

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
fifty dollars was a little pussy of Sony

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.830 
fifty dollars was a little pussy of Sony
I<00:02:38.710> think<00:02:39.040> they<00:02:39.160> could<00:02:39.400> have<00:02:39.580> gone<00:02:39.820> down<00:02:40.030> to<00:02:40.180> 170

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840 
I think they could have gone down to 170

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.990 
I think they could have gone down to 170
dollars<00:02:41.140> to<00:02:41.620> match<00:02:41.890> it<00:02:42.100> with<00:02:42.190> the<00:02:42.250> 3ds<00:02:42.730> because

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
dollars to match it with the 3ds because

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.520 
dollars to match it with the 3ds because
I<00:02:43.090> think<00:02:43.150> if<00:02:43.360> they<00:02:43.480> matched<00:02:43.750> it<00:02:43.990> with<00:02:44.080> the<00:02:44.230> 3ds

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:44.530 
I think if they matched it with the 3ds

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:46.440 
I think if they matched it with the 3ds
I<00:02:44.770> think<00:02:44.980> a<00:02:45.070> lot<00:02:45.400> of<00:02:45.430> people<00:02:45.520> would<00:02:46.240> have<00:02:46.330> been

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
I think a lot of people would have been

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.330 
I think a lot of people would have been
like<00:02:46.540> holy<00:02:46.780> shit<00:02:47.110> it's<00:02:47.260> the<00:02:47.320> same<00:02:47.500> prices<00:02:47.860> 3ds

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
like holy shit it's the same prices 3ds

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.520 
like holy shit it's the same prices 3ds
and<00:02:48.640> you<00:02:48.730> get<00:02:48.850> all<00:02:49.000> these<00:02:49.150> extra<00:02:49.540> features<00:02:49.660> has

and you get all these extra features has

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:51.960 
and you get all these extra features has
so<00:02:50.680> much<00:02:50.770> better<00:02:50.980> graphics<00:02:51.430> I<00:02:51.490> think<00:02:51.700> a<00:02:51.730> lot<00:02:51.940> of

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
so much better graphics I think a lot of

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:53.520 
so much better graphics I think a lot of
people<00:02:52.120> would<00:02:52.450> have<00:02:52.540> jumped<00:02:52.720> on<00:02:52.900> board<00:02:53.110> but<00:02:53.320> no

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
people would have jumped on board but no

so doing a beta three weeks before a

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.490 
so doing a beta three weeks before a
game<00:04:36.120> releases<00:04:36.570> how<00:04:36.840> does<00:04:36.990> that<00:04:37.140> make<00:04:37.320> any

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:37.500 
game releases how does that make any

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.590 
game releases how does that make any
sense<00:04:37.680> a<00:04:38.160> beta<00:04:38.430> is<00:04:38.580> supposed<00:04:38.970> to<00:04:39.090> work<00:04:39.270> out<00:04:39.420> the

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
sense a beta is supposed to work out the

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.170 
sense a beta is supposed to work out the
kinks<00:04:39.630> of<00:04:40.080> a<00:04:40.170> game<00:04:40.350> this<00:04:41.190> is<00:04:41.370> a<00:04:41.400> demo<00:04:41.760> pretty

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:42.180 
kinks of a game this is a demo pretty

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.270 
kinks of a game this is a demo pretty
much<00:04:42.360> the<00:04:42.570> it's<00:04:42.900> not<00:04:43.080> like<00:04:43.230> if<00:04:43.500> you<00:04:43.830> launched<00:04:44.130> a

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
much the it's not like if you launched a

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.790 
much the it's not like if you launched a
beta<00:04:44.490> two<00:04:45.330> three<00:04:45.750> weeks<00:04:45.990> before<00:04:46.200> a<00:04:46.380> game<00:04:46.530> comes

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:46.800 
beta two three weeks before a game comes

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.230 
beta two three weeks before a game comes
out<00:04:46.920> that<00:04:47.070> they<00:04:47.220> can<00:04:47.400> fix<00:04:47.670> that<00:04:47.880> much<00:04:48.120> if

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
out that they can fix that much if

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.090 
out that they can fix that much if
there's<00:04:48.420> some<00:04:48.600> major<00:04:48.810> bugs<00:04:49.170> there's<00:04:49.470> really

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100 
there's some major bugs there's really

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:52.370 
there's some major bugs there's really
not<00:04:50.310> much<00:04:50.490> they<00:04:50.730> can<00:04:50.790> do<00:04:51.030> I<00:04:51.210> really<00:04:52.140> think<00:04:52.260> a

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:52.380 
not much they can do I really think a

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:53.990 
not much they can do I really think a
beta<00:04:52.620> should<00:04:52.860> come<00:04:53.040> out<00:04:53.160> at<00:04:53.310> least<00:04:53.550> two<00:04:53.790> months

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
beta should come out at least two months

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.790 
beta should come out at least two months
before<00:04:54.420> a<00:04:54.450> game<00:04:54.660> comes<00:04:54.930> out<00:04:55.080> that's<00:04:55.260> so<00:04:55.530> odd<00:04:55.770> to

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
before a game comes out that's so odd to

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.950 
before a game comes out that's so odd to
me<00:04:56.040> that<00:04:56.160> they<00:04:56.370> would<00:04:56.490> release<00:04:56.700> the<00:04:56.940> beta<00:04:57.210> 3

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:57.960 
me that they would release the beta 3

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.510 
me that they would release the beta 3
weeks<00:04:58.230> or<00:04:58.470> two<00:04:58.530> weeks<00:04:58.710> before<00:04:59.280> a<00:04:59.310> game

00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 
weeks or two weeks before a game

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.520 
weeks or two weeks before a game
releases<00:04:59.880> doesn't<00:05:00.360> make<00:05:00.450> any<00:05:00.600> sense<00:05:00.840> at<00:05:01.470> all

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:01.530 
releases doesn't make any sense at all

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:03.680 
releases doesn't make any sense at all
but<00:05:02.220> hey<00:05:02.400> that<00:05:02.730> does<00:05:02.940> mean<00:05:03.180> we<00:05:03.300> get<00:05:03.420> to<00:05:03.480> play

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:03.690 
but hey that does mean we get to play

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:05.600 
but hey that does mean we get to play
