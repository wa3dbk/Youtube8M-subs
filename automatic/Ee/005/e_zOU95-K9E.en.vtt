00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
looking at that and decided to see if I

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.549 
looking at that and decided to see if I
can<00:00:12.030> get<00:00:12.179> that<00:00:12.330> original<00:00:12.780> motor<00:00:12.960> that's<00:00:13.200> in<00:00:13.410> it

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
can get that original motor that's in it

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.300 
can get that original motor that's in it
up<00:00:14.009> and<00:00:14.280> running<00:00:14.610> so<00:00:15.240> I<00:00:15.710> hooked<00:00:16.710> up<00:00:16.859> a<00:00:16.980> battery

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.310 
up and running so I hooked up a battery

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:19.790 
up and running so I hooked up a battery
to<00:00:17.550> it<00:00:17.789> and<00:00:18.029> a<00:00:18.510> jumper<00:00:19.020> button<00:00:19.320> put<00:00:19.590> to<00:00:19.740> the

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
to it and a jumper button put to the

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.380 
to it and a jumper button put to the
starter<00:00:20.160> and<00:00:20.279> all<00:00:20.369> does<00:00:20.580> crank<00:00:20.880> over<00:00:21.150> it<00:00:21.210> spin

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:21.390 
starter and all does crank over it spin

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:22.599 
starter and all does crank over it spin
over<00:00:21.570> I<00:00:21.810> did<00:00:21.960> a<00:00:21.990> compression<00:00:22.350> test

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:22.609 
over I did a compression test

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:26.660 
over I did a compression test
compression<00:00:23.609> test<00:00:23.820> looked<00:00:24.119> pretty<00:00:24.689> good

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
compression test looked pretty good

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.810 
compression test looked pretty good
nothing<00:00:27.359> terrible<00:00:30.230> my<00:00:31.230> test<00:00:31.470> is<00:00:31.619> a<00:00:31.650> temp<00:00:32.130> 10

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
nothing terrible my test is a temp 10

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.310 
nothing terrible my test is a temp 10
pounds<00:00:33.149> off<00:00:33.329> but<00:00:34.079> I<00:00:34.110> had<00:00:34.290> 95<00:00:35.010> 130<00:00:35.640> 100<00:00:36.270> and<00:00:36.450> 100

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
pounds off but I had 95 130 100 and 100

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.709 
pounds off but I had 95 130 100 and 100
so<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:38.190> glose<00:00:38.399> gonna<00:00:38.730> be<00:00:38.820> 105<00:00:39.239> the<00:00:39.450> highest

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
so the glose gonna be 105 the highest

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.069 
so the glose gonna be 105 the highest
can<00:00:39.899> be<00:00:39.989> 140<00:00:40.620> on<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:41.100> cylinders<00:00:42.079> the

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
can be 140 on the cylinders the

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.470 
can be 140 on the cylinders the
carburetor<00:00:43.500> was<00:00:43.710> absolutely<00:00:44.489> horrible<00:00:44.940> so<00:00:45.450> I

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
carburetor was absolutely horrible so I

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.270 
carburetor was absolutely horrible so I
ended<00:00:45.930> up<00:00:46.050> having<00:00:46.110> to<00:00:46.410> take<00:00:46.440> it<00:00:46.649> in<00:00:46.770> sandblast

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
ended up having to take it in sandblast

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.090 
ended up having to take it in sandblast
it<00:00:47.520> just<00:00:48.329> to<00:00:48.480> get<00:00:48.809> it<00:00:48.870> to<00:00:49.020> clean<00:00:49.440> out<00:00:49.620> and<00:00:49.920> it

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
it just to get it to clean out and it

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.680 
it just to get it to clean out and it
actually<00:00:50.460> has<00:00:50.760> a<00:00:50.789> rotted<00:00:51.210> hole<00:00:51.420> right<00:00:51.629> through

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
actually has a rotted hole right through

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.900 
actually has a rotted hole right through
the<00:00:51.930> back<00:00:52.079> of<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.350> float<00:00:53.100> so<00:00:53.399> I<00:00:53.430> took<00:00:53.550> some

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
the back of the float so I took some

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.229 
the back of the float so I took some
right<00:00:54.390> stuff<00:00:54.660> and<00:00:54.780> putty<00:00:55.079> did<00:00:55.699> and<00:00:56.699> you<00:00:57.180> can

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
right stuff and putty did and you can

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.470 
right stuff and putty did and you can
see<00:00:58.280> this<00:00:59.280> black<00:00:59.550> crap<00:00:59.850> on<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.120> back<00:01:00.300> of<00:01:00.420> the

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
see this black crap on the back of the

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.290 
see this black crap on the back of the
float<00:01:00.660> Bowl<00:01:00.840> and<00:01:01.760> take<00:01:02.760> my<00:01:02.879> word<00:01:02.910> for<00:01:03.059> it

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
float Bowl and take my word for it

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.410 
float Bowl and take my word for it
anyway<00:01:04.229> so<00:01:04.290> that<00:01:04.500> stuff's<00:01:04.769> on<00:01:04.949> there<00:01:05.189> has<00:01:06.150> no

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
anyway so that stuff's on there has no

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.230 
anyway so that stuff's on there has no
accelerator<00:01:06.930> pump<00:01:07.200> that<00:01:07.470> was<00:01:07.619> dust<00:01:07.979> on<00:01:08.670> the

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
accelerator pump that was dust on the

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.760 
accelerator pump that was dust on the
inside<00:01:09.600> I<00:01:09.630> don't<00:01:09.990> have<00:01:10.200> one<00:01:10.350> that's<00:01:10.470> this

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
inside I don't have one that's this

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.160 
inside I don't have one that's this
small<00:01:11.010> so<00:01:11.970> I<00:01:12.000> took<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.360> little<00:01:12.659> bit<00:01:12.840> more<00:01:12.900> the

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
small so I took a little bit more the

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.300 
small so I took a little bit more the
right<00:01:13.320> stuff<00:01:13.560> and<00:01:13.710> I<00:01:13.740> just<00:01:13.770> kind<00:01:14.040> of<00:01:14.070> plugged

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
right stuff and I just kind of plugged

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:15.590 
right stuff and I just kind of plugged
the<00:01:14.430> hole<00:01:14.580> going<00:01:14.850> into<00:01:15.210> it<00:01:15.330> cuz<00:01:15.450> there's<00:01:15.570> no

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
the hole going into it cuz there's no

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.469 
the hole going into it cuz there's no
guts<00:01:15.930> no<00:01:16.170> gasket<00:01:16.770> no<00:01:16.890> nothing<00:01:18.590> and<00:01:20.390> give<00:01:21.390> you

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
guts no gasket no nothing and give you

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.240 
guts no gasket no nothing and give you
an<00:01:21.570> idea<00:01:21.630> this<00:01:22.380> is<00:01:22.439> what<00:01:22.740> was<00:01:22.890> in<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.100> flow

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
an idea this is what was in the flow

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.880 
an idea this is what was in the flow
pole<00:01:23.960> that's<00:01:24.960> what<00:01:25.080> I<00:01:25.110> dumped<00:01:25.500> out<00:01:25.650> of<00:01:25.830> the

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
pole that's what I dumped out of the

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.870 
pole that's what I dumped out of the
football<00:01:26.750> so<00:01:28.009> I'm<00:01:29.009> not<00:01:29.189> expecting<00:01:29.340> too<00:01:29.850> much

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
football so I'm not expecting too much

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.539 
football so I'm not expecting too much
from<00:01:30.030> that<00:01:30.210> carburetor<00:01:30.720> but<00:01:31.079> I<00:01:31.829> do<00:01:32.280> have<00:01:32.520> a

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
from that carburetor but I do have a

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.429 
from that carburetor but I do have a
setup<00:01:32.850> I<00:01:33.030> cleaned<00:01:33.270> that<00:01:33.360> tip<00:01:33.509> distributor<00:01:34.229> out

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
setup I cleaned that tip distributor out

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.319 
setup I cleaned that tip distributor out
I<00:01:34.590> got<00:01:34.740> spark<00:01:35.130> and<00:01:36.860> may<00:01:37.860> run<00:01:38.159> and<00:01:38.460> I<00:01:39.090> figure

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
I got spark and may run and I figure

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.359 
I got spark and may run and I figure
I'll<00:01:39.420> go<00:01:39.509> grab<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.869> camera<00:01:40.200> and<00:01:40.409> we're<00:01:41.250> going

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
I'll go grab the camera and we're going

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.830 
I'll go grab the camera and we're going
to<00:01:41.400> go<00:01:41.520> giver<00:01:41.790> and<00:01:42.030> see<00:01:42.329> if<00:01:42.390> we<00:01:42.450> can<00:01:42.540> get<00:01:42.659> at<00:01:42.750> the

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
to go giver and see if we can get at the

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.810 
to go giver and see if we can get at the
start<00:01:43.140> I<00:01:43.350> do<00:01:43.680> have<00:01:43.890> some<00:01:44.040> cheater<00:01:44.280> fuel<00:01:44.579> over

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
start I do have some cheater fuel over

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.130 
start I do have some cheater fuel over
there<00:01:45.090> if<00:01:45.210> I<00:01:45.329> need<00:01:45.540> it<00:01:45.770> if<00:01:46.770> not<00:01:47.040> hopefully

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
there if I need it if not hopefully

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.359 
there if I need it if not hopefully
it'll<00:01:49.140> be<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.380> first<00:01:49.500> time<00:01:49.799> this<00:01:50.009> has<00:01:50.189> been

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
it'll be the first time this has been

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.480 
it'll be the first time this has been
started<00:01:51.140> I'm<00:01:52.140> going<00:01:52.439> to<00:01:52.500> guess<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:53.009> plate<00:01:53.280> on

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
started I'm going to guess the plate on

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.560 
started I'm going to guess the plate on
it<00:01:53.670> is<00:01:53.840> 1977<00:01:54.840> expired<00:01:55.259> so<00:01:55.530> I'm<00:01:55.680> going<00:01:55.829> to<00:01:55.890> say

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
it is 1977 expired so I'm going to say

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.260 
it is 1977 expired so I'm going to say
87<00:01:57.570> 97<00:01:57.990> 2007<00:01:58.680> I'm<00:01:58.860> gonna<00:01:59.009> say<00:01:59.130> 36<00:01:59.729> years<00:02:00.000> it

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
87 97 2007 I'm gonna say 36 years it

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.660 
87 97 2007 I'm gonna say 36 years it
hasn't<00:02:00.570> run<00:02:00.719> in<00:02:00.750> so<00:02:01.680> this<00:02:02.130> would<00:02:02.250> be<00:02:02.399> a<00:02:02.430> very

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
hasn't run in so this would be a very

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.350 
hasn't run in so this would be a very
old<00:02:02.939> cold<00:02:03.479> start<00:02:04.399> 36<00:02:05.399> years<00:02:05.610> it<00:02:05.790> does<00:02:06.000> have<00:02:06.180> oil

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
old cold start 36 years it does have oil

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:13.310 
old cold start 36 years it does have oil
in<00:02:06.540> it<00:02:06.689> and<00:02:08.840> let's<00:02:09.840> see<00:02:10.080> see<00:02:10.709> we<00:02:10.860> get

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
better than that do you think it's

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:21.300 
better than that do you think it's
something<00:02:18.790> like<00:02:18.850> that<00:02:19.890> we<00:02:20.890> get<00:02:21.040> you<00:02:21.160> a<00:02:21.190> little

we<00:04:07.700> got<00:04:07.849> the<00:04:08.000> choke<00:04:08.329> in<00:04:08.510> the<00:04:08.540> throttle<00:04:09.049> tied

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
we got the choke in the throttle tied

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:10.660 
we got the choke in the throttle tied
together<00:04:09.440> so<00:04:09.739> you<00:04:09.860> can't<00:04:10.099> operate<00:04:10.250> one

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
together so you can't operate one

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:11.979 
together so you can't operate one

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:34.440 
that motor will run I need a carb real

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.350 
that motor will run I need a carb real
bad<00:06:34.650> it<00:06:34.950> without<00:06:35.280> my<00:06:35.520> hand<00:06:35.760> choking<00:06:36.150> it<00:06:36.240> it

bad it without my hand choking it it

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.960 
bad it without my hand choking it it
won't<00:06:36.450> stay<00:06:36.750> running<00:06:37.610> and<00:06:38.610> I<00:06:38.700> kind<00:06:38.910> of

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:38.970 
won't stay running and I kind of

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:40.820 
won't stay running and I kind of
expected<00:06:39.419> that<00:06:39.450> that<00:06:39.600> was<00:06:39.900> in<00:06:40.020> a<00:06:40.169> pretty<00:06:40.560> poor

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:40.830 
expected that that was in a pretty poor

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:44.870 
expected that that was in a pretty poor
shape<00:06:41.100> as<00:06:41.340> far<00:06:41.520> as<00:06:41.669> the<00:06:42.380> carburetor<00:06:43.380> is<00:06:43.500> and<00:06:44.040> I

00:06:44.870 --> 00:06:44.880 
shape as far as the carburetor is and I

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:46.070 
shape as far as the carburetor is and I
don't<00:06:45.120> know<00:06:45.270> if<00:06:45.330> I<00:06:45.360> have<00:06:45.480> anything<00:06:45.660> that<00:06:45.780> bolts

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:46.080 
don't know if I have anything that bolts

don't know if I have anything that bolts
up<00:06:46.200> to<00:06:46.290> this<00:06:46.410> flame<00:06:46.710> she<00:06:46.919> seems<00:06:47.130> like<00:06:47.250> it's

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:47.400 
up to this flame she seems like it's

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:50.090 
up to this flame she seems like it's
very<00:06:47.580> small<00:06:47.970> I<00:06:48.240> think<00:06:48.870> I<00:06:49.050> said<00:06:49.260> that<00:06:49.410> when<00:06:50.010> t

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:50.100 
very small I think I said that when t

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:51.590 
very small I think I said that when t
five<00:06:50.280> or<00:06:50.490> something<00:06:50.610> was<00:06:50.850> on<00:06:51.000> written<00:06:51.389> on<00:06:51.480> the

five or something was on written on the
side<00:06:51.750> of<00:06:51.780> it<00:06:51.990> not<00:06:52.889> sure<00:06:53.540> so<00:06:54.540> wha<00:06:54.950> the<00:06:55.950> motor<00:06:56.190> is

00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:56.340

00:06:56.340 --> 00:06:58.879 
side of it not sure so wha the motor is
a<00:06:56.370> goer<00:06:56.610> so<00:06:56.880> to<00:06:56.940> speak<00:06:57.620> it's<00:06:58.620> like<00:06:58.710> it's

00:06:58.879 --> 00:06:58.889 
a goer so to speak it's like it's

00:06:58.889 --> 00:07:06.610 
a goer so to speak it's like it's
bleeding<00:06:59.220> some<00:06:59.400> stuff<00:06:59.639> from<00:06:59.970> underneath<00:07:01.700> but

I<00:07:41.790> may<00:07:42.790> still<00:07:43.030> swap<00:07:43.210> out<00:07:43.390> the<00:07:43.510> motor<00:07:43.690> in<00:07:43.840> there
