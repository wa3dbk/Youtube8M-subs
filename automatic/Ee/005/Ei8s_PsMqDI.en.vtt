hey whats up guys will pop up here with
my<00:00:02.730> second<00:00:03.210> tutorial<00:00:04.250> been<00:00:05.250> playing<00:00:05.549> around

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
my second tutorial been playing around

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.509 
my second tutorial been playing around
some<00:00:06.000> with<00:00:06.210> some<00:00:06.359> redstone<00:00:06.600> and<00:00:06.919> pistons<00:00:07.919> en<00:00:08.250> I

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
some with some redstone and pistons en I

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:10.790 
some with some redstone and pistons en I
actually<00:00:08.700> ran<00:00:09.030> into<00:00:09.360> a<00:00:09.389> video<00:00:09.630> on<00:00:10.050> the<00:00:10.290> YouTube

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:10.800 
actually ran into a video on the YouTube

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.700 
actually ran into a video on the YouTube
of<00:00:11.070> a<00:00:11.219> guy<00:00:11.400> that<00:00:11.610> made<00:00:11.790> a<00:00:11.820> secret<00:00:12.719> door<00:00:12.929> no

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
of a guy that made a secret door no

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.880 
of a guy that made a secret door no
switches<00:00:14.280> visible<00:00:15.059> from<00:00:15.330> the<00:00:15.389> outside<00:00:15.890> only

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
switches visible from the outside only

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.830 
switches visible from the outside only
thing<00:00:17.220> you<00:00:17.279> need<00:00:17.460> is<00:00:17.550> a<00:00:17.580> redstone<00:00:18.180> torch<00:00:18.449> to

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
thing you need is a redstone torch to

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.710 
thing you need is a redstone torch to
activate<00:00:19.850> fortunately<00:00:20.850> he<00:00:21.060> didn't<00:00:21.420> really

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
activate fortunately he didn't really

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.310 
activate fortunately he didn't really
put<00:00:22.500> a<00:00:22.710> good<00:00:23.189> explanation<00:00:23.490> of<00:00:24.180> how<00:00:24.900> it<00:00:25.050> works

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
put a good explanation of how it works

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.120 
put a good explanation of how it works
and<00:00:25.590> how<00:00:25.650> to<00:00:25.920> make<00:00:26.189> it<00:00:26.400> in<00:00:27.269> his<00:00:27.570> video<00:00:27.810> and<00:00:28.529> if

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
and how to make it in his video and if

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.669 
and how to make it in his video and if
you'll<00:00:29.279> notice<00:00:29.310> this<00:00:29.970> in<00:00:30.510> order<00:00:30.750> to<00:00:30.900> keep<00:00:31.439> it

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
you'll notice this in order to keep it

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.319 
you'll notice this in order to keep it
so<00:00:31.830> there's<00:00:32.009> no<00:00:32.219> switches<00:00:32.640> out<00:00:32.790> there<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.210> way

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
so there's no switches out there the way

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.950 
so there's no switches out there the way
to<00:00:33.390> close<00:00:33.719> it<00:00:33.899> actually<00:00:34.350> is<00:00:34.500> with<00:00:34.739> water

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
to close it actually is with water

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:39.610 
to close it actually is with water
mechanism<00:00:36.960> up<00:00:37.079> top<00:00:37.350> there<00:00:37.649> comes<00:00:37.920> on<00:00:38.550> down

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
mechanism up top there comes on down

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.310 
mechanism up top there comes on down
yeah<00:00:40.760> it's<00:00:41.760> actually<00:00:42.180> really<00:00:42.510> cool<00:00:42.840> but<00:00:43.110> yeah

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
yeah it's actually really cool but yeah

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.369 
yeah it's actually really cool but yeah
since<00:00:43.710> he<00:00:43.860> didn't<00:00:44.160> make<00:00:45.149> a<00:00:45.210> tutorial<00:00:45.840> i

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
since he didn't make a tutorial i

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.740 
since he didn't make a tutorial i
decided<00:00:46.860> i<00:00:47.129> would<00:00:47.629> so<00:00:48.629> yeah<00:00:48.840> it<00:00:49.289> is<00:00:50.329> that's<00:00:51.329> how

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
decided i would so yeah it is that's how

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.660 
decided i would so yeah it is that's how
it<00:00:51.780> works<00:00:51.870> really<00:00:52.320> basic<00:00:52.890> there's<00:00:53.370> actually<00:00:53.640> a

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
it works really basic there's actually a

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.360 
it works really basic there's actually a
piston<00:00:54.120> underneath<00:00:54.510> here<00:00:54.780> that<00:00:55.050> powers<00:00:55.559> turns

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
piston underneath here that powers turns

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.160 
piston underneath here that powers turns
out<00:00:56.489> it's<00:00:56.670> really<00:00:57.030> hard<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.360> find<00:00:57.629> out<00:00:57.840> how<00:00:58.109> to

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
out it's really hard to find out how to

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.740 
out it's really hard to find out how to
get<00:00:58.410> a<00:00:58.469> redstone<00:00:59.219> torch<00:00:59.640> to<00:01:00.180> power<00:01:00.420> through<00:01:00.719> a

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
get a redstone torch to power through a

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.189 
get a redstone torch to power through a
wall<00:01:00.960> I<00:01:02.030> so<00:01:03.030> in<00:01:03.359> order<00:01:03.480> to<00:01:03.629> get<00:01:03.840> back<00:01:04.019> out

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
wall I so in order to get back out

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:05.420 
wall I so in order to get back out
though<00:01:04.409> I'm<00:01:04.559> sure<00:01:04.710> you're<00:01:04.860> wondering<00:01:04.890> once

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
though I'm sure you're wondering once

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.030 
though I'm sure you're wondering once
you<00:01:05.549> close<00:01:05.939> it<00:01:07.790> so<00:01:08.790> now<00:01:09.030> I'm<00:01:09.420> trapped<00:01:09.750> in<00:01:09.960> here

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
you close it so now I'm trapped in here

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.899 
you close it so now I'm trapped in here
in<00:01:11.040> my<00:01:11.310> secret<00:01:11.790> room<00:01:11.970> oh<00:01:12.560> I<00:01:13.560> have<00:01:14.130> set<00:01:14.400> up<00:01:14.520> here

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
in my secret room oh I have set up here

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:23.800 
in my secret room oh I have set up here
is<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:16.040> a<00:01:17.720> time<00:01:18.720> switch<00:01:19.729> that<00:01:20.729> runs<00:01:21.000> from<00:01:21.150> this

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.080 

my<00:01:24.810> shooters<00:01:25.619> really<00:01:26.130> laggy<00:01:26.460> and<00:01:26.820> I<00:01:26.939> do

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
my shooters really laggy and I do

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.200 
my shooters really laggy and I do
apologize<00:01:27.360> as<00:01:27.840> fraps<00:01:28.640> it's<00:01:29.640> just<00:01:29.820> horrible

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
it just enough so i cannot get out there

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.480 
it just enough so i cannot get out there
you<00:01:41.299> know<00:01:42.299> Chuck<00:01:42.840> fly<00:01:43.290> on<00:01:43.530> here<00:01:43.770> click<00:01:44.070> and

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
you know Chuck fly on here click and

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.690 
you know Chuck fly on here click and
show<00:01:45.210> you<00:01:45.299> what's<00:01:45.479> going<00:01:45.750> on<00:01:45.930> up<00:01:46.140> here<00:01:46.670> so<00:01:47.670> I

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
show you what's going on up here so I

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.969 
show you what's going on up here so I
have<00:01:48.119> is<00:01:48.390> from<00:01:48.600> that<00:01:48.780> button<00:01:49.200> that<00:01:49.380> I<00:01:49.409> push<00:01:49.710> on

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
have is from that button that I push on

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.219 
have is from that button that I push on
their<00:01:50.220> circuit<00:01:50.909> running<00:01:51.240> up<00:01:51.360> here<00:01:51.630> to<00:01:51.990> an

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
their circuit running up here to an

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.480 
their circuit running up here to an
inverter<00:01:52.770> I<00:01:53.509> which<00:01:54.509> will<00:01:55.439> invert<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.250> power

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
inverter I which will invert the power

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.569 
inverter I which will invert the power
of<00:01:56.909> this<00:01:57.210> releasing<00:01:58.110> it<00:01:58.170> and<00:01:58.409> basic<00:01:59.399> water

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
of this releasing it and basic water

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.440 
of this releasing it and basic water
source<00:01:59.939> block<00:02:00.270> opens<00:02:01.079> it<00:02:01.200> up<00:02:01.290> there<00:02:02.030> now<00:02:03.030> over

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
source block opens it up there now over

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.870 
source block opens it up there now over
here<00:02:03.479> I<00:02:03.719> do<00:02:03.869> have<00:02:04.229> a<00:02:04.259> skeletal<00:02:05.219> version<00:02:05.610> of<00:02:05.729> it

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
here I do have a skeletal version of it

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.960 
here I do have a skeletal version of it
is<00:02:06.479> that<00:02:06.509> it<00:02:08.270> yeah

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
is that it yeah

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:18.810 
is that it yeah
no<00:02:10.420> no<00:02:10.930> no<00:02:12.210> over<00:02:13.210> here<00:02:14.460> sorry<00:02:17.160> really<00:02:18.160> basic

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
no no no over here sorry really basic

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.940 
no no no over here sorry really basic
using<00:02:19.420> a<00:02:19.480> transistor<00:02:20.230> for<00:02:20.560> any<00:02:20.680> way<00:02:20.800> that

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
using a transistor for any way that

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.040 
using a transistor for any way that
doesn't<00:02:21.250> know<00:02:21.370> what<00:02:21.520> that<00:02:21.670> is<00:02:21.700> just<00:02:22.510> have<00:02:23.020> a

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
doesn't know what that is just have a

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.320 
doesn't know what that is just have a
look<00:02:23.320> up<00:02:23.530> on<00:02:23.710> youtube<00:02:23.740> it's<00:02:24.520> really<00:02:24.850> really

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
look up on youtube it's really really

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.560 
look up on youtube it's really really
basic<00:02:25.920> I'll<00:02:26.920> show<00:02:27.280> you<00:02:27.340> briefly<00:02:27.730> here<00:02:28.270> what<00:02:28.450> it

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:28.570 
basic I'll show you briefly here what it

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.810 
basic I'll show you briefly here what it
is<00:02:28.830> right<00:02:29.830> here<00:02:30.250> this<00:02:30.400> is<00:02:30.460> what<00:02:30.700> the

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
is right here this is what the

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:32.160 
is right here this is what the
transistor<00:02:31.390> is<00:02:31.510> and<00:02:31.690> this<00:02:31.750> is<00:02:31.810> what<00:02:32.050> the

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
transistor is and this is what the

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.530 
transistor is and this is what the
redstone<00:02:32.620> torch<00:02:33.040> powers<00:02:35.070> so<00:02:36.070> that<00:02:36.360> powers<00:02:37.360> are

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
redstone torch powers so that powers are

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.860 
redstone torch powers so that powers are
pushing<00:02:38.110> this<00:02:38.230> block<00:02:38.590> which<00:02:38.860> conducts<00:02:39.370> I<00:02:39.870> in

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
pushing this block which conducts I in

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.890 
pushing this block which conducts I in
between<00:02:41.080> us<00:02:41.590> making<00:02:42.580> a<00:02:42.700> link<00:02:42.940> now<00:02:43.209> it<00:02:43.510> doesn't

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
between us making a link now it doesn't

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:49.530 
between us making a link now it doesn't
work<00:02:45.480> does<00:02:46.480> not<00:02:46.510> work<00:02:47.230> if<00:02:47.680> this<00:02:48.640> is<00:02:48.820> redstone

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
work does not work if this is redstone

00:02:49.540 --> 00:03:00.140 
work does not work if this is redstone
don't<00:02:50.200> know<00:02:50.380> why<00:02:50.700> not<00:02:51.700> for<00:02:52.000> you<00:02:52.120> here<00:02:58.110> see

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:00.150 
don't know why not for you here see

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:09.500 
don't know why not for you here see
doesn't<00:03:01.150> conduct<00:03:01.959> there<00:03:02.440> yeah<00:03:04.290> like<00:03:05.290> this

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:16.290 

yeah<00:03:10.510> some<00:03:10.959> ducks<00:03:11.200> and<00:03:13.980> opens<00:03:14.980> the<00:03:15.100> door<00:03:15.519> be

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.300 
yeah some ducks and opens the door be

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:21.840 
yeah some ducks and opens the door be
right<00:03:16.330> here<00:03:19.320> so<00:03:20.320> yeah<00:03:20.620> and<00:03:21.010> just<00:03:21.340> so<00:03:21.519> you<00:03:21.550> gotta

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:21.850 
right here so yeah and just so you gotta

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:23.460 
right here so yeah and just so you gotta
make<00:03:22.060> an<00:03:22.180> inverter<00:03:22.540> of<00:03:22.780> course<00:03:23.050> you<00:03:23.320> don't

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:23.470 
make an inverter of course you don't

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.220 
make an inverter of course you don't
know<00:03:23.620> that<00:03:23.830> is<00:03:24.010> look<00:03:24.220> it<00:03:24.370> up<00:03:24.459> it<00:03:24.760> just<00:03:25.050> this<00:03:26.050> is

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:26.230 
know that is look it up it just this is

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:28.830 
know that is look it up it just this is
powered<00:03:26.680> when<00:03:26.890> this<00:03:27.070> isn't<00:03:27.610> once<00:03:28.510> this<00:03:28.660> is

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
powered when this isn't once this is

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.650 
powered when this isn't once this is
powered<00:03:29.200> that<00:03:29.470> turns<00:03:29.830> off<00:03:30.390> turning<00:03:31.390> off<00:03:31.630> the

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
powered that turns off turning off the

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.620 
powered that turns off turning off the
power<00:03:31.840> that<00:03:32.470> was<00:03:32.769> holding<00:03:33.280> the<00:03:33.670> Pistons<00:03:34.150> open

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:34.630 
power that was holding the Pistons open

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.150 
power that was holding the Pistons open
which<00:03:34.870> now<00:03:35.170> lets<00:03:35.470> them<00:03:35.709> closed<00:03:36.390> really<00:03:37.390> basic

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
which now lets them closed really basic

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.190 
which now lets them closed really basic
really<00:03:39.160> really<00:03:39.400> easy<00:03:39.549> to<00:03:39.790> make<00:03:39.959> hardest<00:03:40.959> part

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
really really easy to make hardest part

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.350 
really really easy to make hardest part
is<00:03:41.320> just<00:03:41.380> mapping<00:03:41.890> it<00:03:42.190> out<00:03:42.310> so<00:03:42.610> you<00:03:42.730> can<00:03:42.880> hide

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 
is just mapping it out so you can hide

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:46.199 
is just mapping it out so you can hide
all<00:03:43.540> the<00:03:43.780> redstone<00:03:44.769> and<00:03:44.799> make<00:03:45.430> you<00:03:45.580> fit<00:03:45.910> into

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:46.209 
all the redstone and make you fit into

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:49.440 
all the redstone and make you fit into
your<00:03:46.720> area<00:03:47.170> properly<00:03:47.850> so<00:03:48.850> yeah<00:03:48.970> I<00:03:49.000> hope<00:03:49.150> that

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
your area properly so yeah I hope that

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:52.140 
your area properly so yeah I hope that
helped<00:03:49.690> you<00:03:50.250> you<00:03:51.250> guys<00:03:51.370> have<00:03:51.549> any<00:03:51.700> comments

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:52.150 
helped you you guys have any comments

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:53.789 
helped you you guys have any comments
questions<00:03:52.209> anything<00:03:52.930> you<00:03:53.080> guys<00:03:53.290> want<00:03:53.380> to<00:03:53.620> see

questions anything you guys want to see

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:55.470 
questions anything you guys want to see
I'll<00:03:54.010> figure<00:03:54.340> it<00:03:54.489> out<00:03:54.670> just<00:03:54.940> leave<00:03:55.209> it<00:03:55.299> in<00:03:55.420> the

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
I'll figure it out just leave it in the

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:56.010 
I'll figure it out just leave it in the
