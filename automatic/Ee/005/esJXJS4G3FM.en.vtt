in<00:00:04.259> this<00:00:04.440> film<00:00:04.710> we're<00:00:04.859> going<00:00:04.980> to<00:00:05.100> describe<00:00:05.399> the

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
in this film we're going to describe the

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:11.470 
in this film we're going to describe the
different<00:00:05.910> castes<00:00:06.390> of<00:00:06.479> honeybee

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:11.480 

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.760 

honey<00:00:12.480> bees<00:00:12.720> are<00:00:12.750> divided<00:00:13.320> into<00:00:13.530> three

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:13.770 
honey bees are divided into three

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:17.570 
honey bees are divided into three
different<00:00:14.100> types<00:00:14.840> the<00:00:15.840> queen<00:00:16.080> and<00:00:16.350> the<00:00:16.580> worker

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
different types the queen and the worker

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.450 
different types the queen and the worker
which<00:00:18.300> are<00:00:18.450> female<00:00:18.810> bees<00:00:19.050> and<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:20.160> drone

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
which are female bees and the drone

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.380 
which are female bees and the drone
which<00:00:20.850> is<00:00:21.029> a<00:00:21.060> male<00:00:21.300> bee

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:23.390 
which is a male bee

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.780 
which is a male bee
the<00:00:24.260> queen<00:00:24.470> bee<00:00:24.680> is<00:00:24.710> the<00:00:24.950> heart<00:00:25.160> of<00:00:25.280> the<00:00:25.400> colony

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:25.790 
the queen bee is the heart of the colony

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:28.120 
the queen bee is the heart of the colony
without<00:00:26.570> her<00:00:26.960> the<00:00:27.260> rest<00:00:27.500> of<00:00:27.650> the<00:00:27.740> colony

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:28.130 
without her the rest of the colony

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.330 
without her the rest of the colony
cannot<00:00:28.460> survive

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:31.340 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.660 

she<00:00:32.300> has<00:00:32.450> two<00:00:32.660> main<00:00:32.960> purposes

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:34.670 
she has two main purposes

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.850 
she has two main purposes
to<00:00:35.670> produce<00:00:35.850> chemical<00:00:36.240> scents<00:00:36.900> or<00:00:37.050> pheromones

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
to produce chemical scents or pheromones

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.130 
to produce chemical scents or pheromones
which<00:00:38.730> help<00:00:39.000> regulate<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.450> unity<00:00:39.930> and

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
which help regulate the unity and

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.510 
which help regulate the unity and
stability<00:00:40.350> of<00:00:40.680> the<00:00:40.920> colony<00:00:41.280> and<00:00:41.460> to<00:00:42.210> lay<00:00:42.360> eggs

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:45.520 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.030 

you<00:00:46.330> can<00:00:46.480> identify<00:00:46.630> the<00:00:47.050> queen<00:00:47.380> by<00:00:47.650> the<00:00:47.710> size

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.040 
you can identify the queen by the size

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.160 
you can identify the queen by the size
of<00:00:48.190> her<00:00:48.310> abdomen<00:00:48.700> which<00:00:49.450> is<00:00:49.630> noticeably

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
of her abdomen which is noticeably

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.360 
of her abdomen which is noticeably
larger<00:00:50.590> than<00:00:50.800> a<00:00:50.890> worker<00:00:51.130> or<00:00:51.460> drone<00:00:51.820> bee

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
larger than a worker or drone bee

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.890 
larger than a worker or drone bee
within<00:00:54.370> the<00:00:54.490> hive<00:00:54.670> she<00:00:55.210> will<00:00:55.360> usually<00:00:55.510> walk

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:55.900 
within the hive she will usually walk

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.810 
within the hive she will usually walk
straight<00:00:56.260> through<00:00:56.560> the<00:00:56.680> brood<00:00:56.920> whilst<00:00:57.670> the

straight through the brood whilst the
works<00:00:58.030> and<00:00:58.330> drones<00:00:58.570> will<00:00:58.810> have<00:00:58.960> a<00:00:58.989> tendency<00:00:59.230> to

00:00:59.490 --> 00:00:59.500 
works and drones will have a tendency to

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:03.479 
works and drones will have a tendency to
crawl<00:00:59.890> over<00:01:00.250> each<00:01:00.400> other<00:01:02.010> despite<00:01:03.010> this<00:01:03.190> the

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979 
help locate her a beekeeper will often

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:12.000 
help locate her a beekeeper will often

she will start to slow her production so

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.410 
she will start to slow her production so
it<00:01:26.920> is<00:01:27.040> advisable<00:01:27.369> to<00:01:27.580> replace<00:01:28.000> the<00:01:28.149> queen<00:01:28.390> of
