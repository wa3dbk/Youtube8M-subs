so<00:01:19.530> as<00:01:19.560> you<00:01:19.830> guys<00:01:19.920> know<00:01:19.979> I<00:01:20.189> know<00:01:20.640> how<00:01:20.820> to<00:01:20.909> play

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
so as you guys know I know how to play

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.060 
so as you guys know I know how to play
it<00:01:21.240> pretty<00:01:21.540> much<00:01:21.720> perfectly<00:01:22.229> now<00:01:22.500> going<00:01:22.979> into

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
it pretty much perfectly now going into

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.160 
it pretty much perfectly now going into
black<00:01:23.520> ops<00:01:23.729> 2<00:01:23.939> so<00:01:24.540> that's<00:01:24.810> one<00:01:24.960> of<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.140> things

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
black ops 2 so that's one of the things

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.780 
black ops 2 so that's one of the things
that's<00:01:25.530> worked<00:01:25.770> out<00:01:25.860> really<00:01:26.070> well<00:01:26.159> for<00:01:26.340> me<00:01:26.549> and

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
that's worked out really well for me and

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.120 
that's worked out really well for me and
I<00:01:27.390> wanted<00:01:27.630> to<00:01:27.720> talk<00:01:27.960> about<00:01:28.130> transitioning

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
I wanted to talk about transitioning

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.819 
I wanted to talk about transitioning
from<00:01:29.430> modeling<00:01:30.270> for<00:01:30.420> 32<00:01:30.930> black<00:01:31.020> ops<00:01:31.320> 2<00:01:31.500> if<00:01:31.710> you

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
from modeling for 32 black ops 2 if you

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.249 
from modeling for 32 black ops 2 if you
guys<00:01:31.979> followed<00:01:32.430> me<00:01:32.610> since<00:01:32.640> black<00:01:33.630> ops<00:01:33.840> 1<00:01:33.960> you

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
guys followed me since black ops 1 you

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.690 
guys followed me since black ops 1 you
will<00:01:34.320> know<00:01:34.500> that<00:01:34.680> my<00:01:34.770> transition<00:01:35.340> from<00:01:35.490> black

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
will know that my transition from black

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.240 
will know that my transition from black
ops<00:01:35.909> 1<00:01:36.030> tomorrow<00:01:36.659> for<00:01:37.020> 3<00:01:37.259> was<00:01:37.560> absolutely

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
ops 1 tomorrow for 3 was absolutely

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.740 
ops 1 tomorrow for 3 was absolutely
terrible<00:01:38.610> it<00:01:38.790> took<00:01:38.939> me<00:01:39.060> forever<00:01:39.270> get<00:01:39.570> used

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
terrible it took me forever get used

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.469 
terrible it took me forever get used
tomorrow<00:01:40.049> for<00:01:40.320> 3<00:01:40.530> and<00:01:40.740> the<00:01:41.280> thing<00:01:41.490> is<00:01:41.520> I<00:01:41.909> was

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
tomorrow for 3 and the thing is I was

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.450 
tomorrow for 3 and the thing is I was
relying<00:01:42.780> so<00:01:43.229> much<00:01:43.290> on<00:01:43.560> my<00:01:43.619> killstreaks<00:01:43.950> and

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
relying so much on my killstreaks and

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.010 
relying so much on my killstreaks and
black<00:01:44.640> ops<00:01:44.880> 1<00:01:45.000> and<00:01:45.270> that's<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.509> same<00:01:45.689> as<00:01:45.720> black

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
black ops 1 and that's the same as black

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.139 
black ops 1 and that's the same as black
ops<00:01:46.229> 2<00:01:46.439> you<00:01:46.950> want<00:01:47.159> to<00:01:47.250> play<00:01:47.430> a<00:01:47.460> little<00:01:47.939> bit

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
ops 2 you want to play a little bit

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.760 
ops 2 you want to play a little bit
defensive<00:01:48.659> you<00:01:48.750> don't<00:01:48.899> want<00:01:49.020> to<00:01:49.079> be<00:01:49.170> as<00:01:49.380> rush

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
defensive you don't want to be as rush

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.410 
defensive you don't want to be as rush
happy<00:01:50.130> as<00:01:50.280> you<00:01:50.399> would<00:01:50.579> be<00:01:50.700> in<00:01:50.790> model<00:01:51.060> for<00:01:51.240> 3

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
happy as you would be in model for 3

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.359 
happy as you would be in model for 3
because<00:01:51.750> with<00:01:52.380> mono<00:01:52.590> work<00:01:52.740> for<00:01:52.890> three<00:01:53.040> it<00:01:53.189> had

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
because with mono work for three it had

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.100 
because with mono work for three it had
specialist<00:01:53.970> bonus<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:54.420> whatnot<00:01:54.689> and<00:01:54.930> you'll

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
specialist bonus and whatnot and you'll

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.480 
specialist bonus and whatnot and you'll
pretty<00:01:55.320> much<00:01:55.409> just<00:01:55.590> be<00:01:55.770> a<00:01:55.799> super<00:01:56.310> soldier

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
pretty much just be a super soldier

pretty much just be a super soldier
rushing<00:01:56.939> around<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.450> it<00:01:58.049> was<00:01:58.140> more<00:01:58.259> focused

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
rushing around and it was more focused

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.190 
rushing around and it was more focused
on<00:01:58.979> gun<00:01:59.369> kills<00:01:59.670> while<00:01:59.969> in<00:02:00.240> black<00:02:00.479> ops<00:02:00.659> 2<00:02:00.780> it's

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
on gun kills while in black ops 2 it's

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.929 
on gun kills while in black ops 2 it's
really<00:02:01.710> focused<00:02:02.159> on<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.369> killstreaks<00:02:02.759> and

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
really focused on the killstreaks and

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.490 
really focused on the killstreaks and
you<00:02:03.090> guys<00:02:03.180> will<00:02:03.360> see<00:02:03.420> right<00:02:03.689> here<00:02:03.869> this<00:02:04.049> VTOL

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
you guys will see right here this VTOL

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.020 
you guys will see right here this VTOL
warship<00:02:04.890> it<00:02:05.040> kind<00:02:05.219> of<00:02:05.250> messed<00:02:05.460> up<00:02:05.610> in<00:02:05.729> theorem

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
warship it kind of messed up in theorem

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.819 
warship it kind of messed up in theorem
oh<00:02:06.149> like<00:02:06.390> it<00:02:06.540> just<00:02:06.780> shows<00:02:06.960> me<00:02:06.990> getting<00:02:07.710> hit

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
oh like it just shows me getting hit

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.410 
oh like it just shows me getting hit
markers<00:02:08.220> that<00:02:08.250> doesn't<00:02:08.759> show<00:02:08.910> like<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.209> plus

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
50s or plus 15 s I guess in this game

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.040 
50s or plus 15 s I guess in this game
play<00:02:11.700> I<00:02:11.910> don't<00:02:12.330> know<00:02:12.390> what<00:02:12.510> really<00:02:12.629> happening

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
play I don't know what really happening

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.260 
play I don't know what really happening
right

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
right

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:14.520 
right
there<00:02:13.390> but<00:02:13.570> I<00:02:13.690> was<00:02:13.900> getting<00:02:14.020> kills<00:02:14.350> if<00:02:14.470> you

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
there but I was getting kills if you

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
there but I was getting kills if you
take<00:02:14.680> a<00:02:14.710> look<00:02:14.890> at<00:02:14.980> the<00:02:15.070> kill<00:02:15.220> fee<00:02:15.370> and<00:02:15.460> that

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
take a look at the kill fee and that

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.730 
take a look at the kill fee and that
kind<00:02:15.730> of<00:02:15.760> stuff<00:02:15.820> but<00:02:16.570> yeah<00:02:16.780> and<00:02:17.110> Morrow<00:02:17.650> for

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
kind of stuff but yeah and Morrow for

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.370 
kind of stuff but yeah and Morrow for
three<00:02:17.950> the<00:02:18.700> gun<00:02:19.180> skill<00:02:19.480> was<00:02:19.840> the<00:02:20.140> thing<00:02:20.350> that

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:20.380 
three the gun skill was the thing that

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.020 
three the gun skill was the thing that
was<00:02:20.530> really<00:02:20.800> required<00:02:21.190> but<00:02:21.370> in<00:02:21.490> black<00:02:21.700> ops<00:02:21.910> 2

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
was really required but in black ops 2

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.240 
was really required but in black ops 2
the<00:02:22.510> killstreaks<00:02:23.080> are<00:02:23.320> all<00:02:23.530> the<00:02:23.680> matters<00:02:24.040> and

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
the killstreaks are all the matters and

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.130 
the killstreaks are all the matters and
that's<00:02:24.640> one<00:02:25.270> of<00:02:25.300> the<00:02:25.480> things<00:02:25.510> I<00:02:25.750> want<00:02:25.930> to<00:02:25.960> talk

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
that's one of the things I want to talk

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.810 
that's one of the things I want to talk
about<00:02:26.170> that's<00:02:26.560> the<00:02:26.800> major<00:02:27.100> thing<00:02:27.490> that<00:02:27.520> I<00:02:27.670> had

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:27.820 
about that's the major thing that I had

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.520 
about that's the major thing that I had
to<00:02:27.940> realize<00:02:28.330> in<00:02:28.510> this<00:02:28.540> gameplay<00:02:28.810> I<00:02:29.020> started

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
to realize in this gameplay I started

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.110 
to realize in this gameplay I started
thinking<00:02:29.860> about<00:02:29.950> my<00:02:30.130> transition<00:02:30.370> from<00:02:30.910> black

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
thinking about my transition from black

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.750 
thinking about my transition from black
ops<00:02:31.300> 1<00:02:31.390> and<00:02:31.660> 1<00:02:31.750> 0<00:02:31.870> for<00:02:32.080> 3<00:02:32.260> and<00:02:32.470> I<00:02:33.220> remembered

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:33.760 
ops 1 and 1 0 for 3 and I remembered

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.250 
ops 1 and 1 0 for 3 and I remembered
that<00:02:33.790> and<00:02:34.180> black<00:02:34.330> ops<00:02:34.480> 1<00:02:34.600> the<00:02:34.840> killstreaks

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
that and black ops 1 the killstreaks

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.410 
that and black ops 1 the killstreaks
they<00:02:35.410> were<00:02:35.530> all<00:02:35.680> powerful<00:02:36.040> and<00:02:36.370> it's<00:02:36.970> the<00:02:37.150> same

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
they were all powerful and it's the same

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.120 
they were all powerful and it's the same
exact<00:02:37.780> thing<00:02:37.990> in<00:02:38.200> this<00:02:38.380> game<00:02:38.620> and<00:02:38.800> that's<00:02:38.920> one

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
exact thing in this game and that's one

when<00:03:24.070> I<00:03:24.130> was<00:03:24.220> running<00:03:24.370> on<00:03:24.550> this<00:03:24.640> gameplay<00:03:24.880> i'm

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.180 
when I was running on this gameplay i'm

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.120 
when I was running on this gameplay i'm
pretty<00:03:25.390> sure<00:03:25.570> i<00:03:25.600> was<00:03:25.840> using<00:03:25.959> the<00:03:26.170> MSMC<00:03:26.709> and

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
pretty sure i was using the MSMC and

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.280 
pretty sure i was using the MSMC and
this<00:03:27.730> is<00:03:27.850> the<00:03:27.940> best<00:03:28.120> submachine<00:03:28.630> gun<00:03:28.810> period

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
this is the best submachine gun period

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.170 
this is the best submachine gun period
at<00:03:29.440> least<00:03:29.650> in<00:03:29.800> my<00:03:29.950> opinion<00:03:30.070> so<00:03:30.610> I<00:03:30.820> would

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
at least in my opinion so I would

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:32.610 
at least in my opinion so I would
definitely<00:03:31.209> recommend<00:03:31.540> trying<00:03:32.140> that<00:03:32.350> weapon

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
definitely recommend trying that weapon

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.050 
definitely recommend trying that weapon
out<00:03:32.740> if<00:03:32.830> they<00:03:32.920> haven't<00:03:33.040> already<00:03:33.220> I<00:03:33.550> was<00:03:33.850> well

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
out if they haven't already I was well

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.640 
out if they haven't already I was well
as<00:03:34.150> the<00:03:34.240> PDW<00:03:34.780> I<00:03:34.840> pick<00:03:34.990> it<00:03:35.080> up<00:03:35.170> right<00:03:35.290> here<00:03:35.500> and

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
as the PDW I pick it up right here and

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.410 
as the PDW I pick it up right here and
I've<00:03:36.310> been<00:03:36.459> doing<00:03:36.760> really<00:03:36.940> well<00:03:37.030> with<00:03:37.180> this

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
I've been doing really well with this

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.570 
I've been doing really well with this
weapon<00:03:37.630> as<00:03:37.870> well<00:03:38.080> but<00:03:38.290> on<00:03:38.500> my<00:03:38.650> msmc<00:03:39.280> i<00:03:39.310> was

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580 
weapon as well but on my msmc i was

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:42.210 
weapon as well but on my msmc i was
using<00:03:39.760> silencer<00:03:40.510> grip<00:03:41.380> i<00:03:41.530> believe<00:03:41.860> and<00:03:42.100> then

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
using silencer grip i believe and then

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:43.830 
using silencer grip i believe and then
extended<00:03:42.700> mags<00:03:42.880> which<00:03:43.150> i<00:03:43.330> find<00:03:43.480> work<00:03:43.720> out

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 
extended mags which i find work out

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.630 
extended mags which i find work out
pretty<00:03:43.990> well<00:03:44.110> you<00:03:44.380> really<00:03:44.650> don't<00:03:44.860> need<00:03:45.040> a<00:03:45.250> grip

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
pretty well you really don't need a grip

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:47.850 
pretty well you really don't need a grip
but<00:03:46.209> it<00:03:46.510> does<00:03:46.780> help<00:03:46.930> out<00:03:47.110> a<00:03:47.140> little<00:03:47.410> bit<00:03:47.620> if

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:47.860 
but it does help out a little bit if

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.350 
but it does help out a little bit if
you're<00:03:48.070> not<00:03:48.220> the<00:03:48.459> most<00:03:48.580> accurate<00:03:48.790> person<00:03:49.270> in

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 
you're not the most accurate person in

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:50.970 
you're not the most accurate person in
the<00:03:49.450> world<00:03:49.540> so<00:03:49.900> that's<00:03:50.380> just<00:03:50.590> what<00:03:50.709> I<00:03:50.740> want<00:03:50.920> to

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:50.980 
the world so that's just what I want to

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:52.680 
the world so that's just what I want to
say<00:03:51.100> and<00:03:51.250> I<00:03:51.310> was<00:03:51.430> also<00:03:51.700> using<00:03:51.910> pretty<00:03:52.300> low<00:03:52.450> kill

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
say and I was also using pretty low kill

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:54.060 
say and I was also using pretty low kill
streaks<00:03:52.930> in<00:03:53.050> this<00:03:53.140> game<00:03:53.320> play<00:03:53.500> as<00:03:53.560> well<00:03:53.740> I<00:03:53.800> had

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.070 
streaks in this game play as well I had

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:55.620 
streaks in this game play as well I had
on<00:03:54.220> the<00:03:54.400> lightning<00:03:54.850> strike<00:03:55.120> which<00:03:55.360> is

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:55.630 
on the lightning strike which is

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:57.420 
on the lightning strike which is
definitely<00:03:56.290> really<00:03:56.560> low<00:03:56.800> but<00:03:57.040> it's<00:03:57.160> really

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:05.740 
streak a little bit then I had on the

streak a little bit then I had on the
lodestar<00:04:06.340> and<00:04:06.550> those<00:04:07.150> things<00:04:07.480> I<00:04:07.690> almost<00:04:07.930> want

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
lodestar and those things I almost want

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:10.320 
lodestar and those things I almost want
to<00:04:08.200> say<00:04:08.260> it's<00:04:08.650> better<00:04:08.950> than<00:04:09.250> a<00:04:09.310> swarm<00:04:09.970> in<00:04:10.120> some

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:10.330 
to say it's better than a swarm in some

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:12.000 
to say it's better than a swarm in some
situations<00:04:10.900> you<00:04:11.140> can<00:04:11.260> do<00:04:11.380> a<00:04:11.410> lot<00:04:11.620> of<00:04:11.650> work<00:04:11.860> with

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.010 
situations you can do a lot of work with

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:13.380 
situations you can do a lot of work with
those<00:04:12.190> things<00:04:12.459> and<00:04:12.730> I<00:04:13.209> would<00:04:13.300> definitely

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390 
those things and I would definitely

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.150 
those things and I would definitely
recommend<00:04:13.600> running<00:04:14.020> that<00:04:14.380> as<00:04:14.590> well<00:04:14.860> as<00:04:15.040> the

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:15.160 
recommend running that as well as the

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.650 
recommend running that as well as the
beetle<00:04:15.400> warship<00:04:15.820> the<00:04:15.850> only<00:04:16.150> thing<00:04:16.359> with<00:04:16.510> this

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:16.660 
beetle warship the only thing with this

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.440 
beetle warship the only thing with this
is<00:04:16.900> it<00:04:17.140> can<00:04:17.290> get<00:04:17.410> shot<00:04:17.739> down<00:04:17.770> so<00:04:18.549> easily<00:04:18.580> but<00:04:19.299> it

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:19.450 
is it can get shot down so easily but it

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:21.210 
is it can get shot down so easily but it
does<00:04:19.600> so<00:04:19.840> much<00:04:20.020> work<00:04:20.260> like<00:04:20.560> i<00:04:20.680> said<00:04:20.890> i<00:04:20.919> like<00:04:21.100> to

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:21.230 
you guys so I thought that would be

you guys so I thought that would be
really<00:05:21.350> cool<00:05:21.620> and<00:05:21.890> you<00:05:22.490> guys<00:05:22.580> will<00:05:22.760> see<00:05:23.000> up

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520 
here I actually end up losing the

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.490 
here I actually end up losing the
gameplay<00:05:26.000> but<00:05:26.270> the<00:05:26.390> reason<00:05:26.570> is<00:05:26.990> when<00:05:27.260> I<00:05:27.320> was

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:27.500 
gameplay but the reason is when I was

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:28.990 
gameplay but the reason is when I was
open<00:05:27.770> my<00:05:27.860> killstreaks<00:05:28.130> and<00:05:28.610> you<00:05:28.730> guys<00:05:28.850> will
