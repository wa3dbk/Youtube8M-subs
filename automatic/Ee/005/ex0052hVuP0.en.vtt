00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.160 
overdone so today we're going to try a

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.389 
overdone so today we're going to try a
little<00:00:46.489> experiment<00:00:46.969> and<00:00:47.649> find<00:00:48.649> a<00:00:48.859> way<00:00:49.039> to<00:00:49.100> do

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
reason I'm doing it this way is because

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.940 
reason I'm doing it this way is because
we<00:02:53.760> are<00:02:53.940> going<00:02:54.180> to<00:02:54.420> be<00:02:54.630> cutting<00:02:55.349> the<00:02:55.650> steaks

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
we are going to be cutting the steaks

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:01.309 
we are going to be cutting the steaks
later<00:02:56.940> and<00:02:58.160> grilling<00:02:59.160> them<00:02:59.630> now<00:03:00.630> what<00:03:01.019> I<00:03:01.079> want

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
later and grilling them now what I want

later and grilling them now what I want
to<00:03:01.440> be<00:03:01.560> able<00:03:01.709> to<00:03:01.919> do<00:03:02.250> is<00:03:03.030> to<00:03:03.359> cut<00:03:03.660> in<00:03:04.530> between

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
to be able to do is to cut in between

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.569 
to be able to do is to cut in between
each<00:03:05.910> of<00:03:05.940> the<00:03:06.269> cocktail<00:03:06.750> sticks<00:03:07.109> so<00:03:08.040> that<00:03:08.069> the

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:08.579 
each of the cocktail sticks so that the

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:14.750 
each of the cocktail sticks so that the
bacon<00:03:09.079> stays<00:03:10.079> attached<00:03:10.560> to<00:03:10.859> the<00:03:12.079> meat<00:03:13.760> during

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:14.760 
bacon stays attached to the meat during

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.819 
bacon stays attached to the meat during
that<00:03:15.120> second<00:03:15.859> grilling<00:03:16.859> process

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:18.829

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:21.170 
that second grilling process
it's<00:03:20.030> absolutely

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:26.099 
a north of the Arctic breeze so I'm not

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:27.559 
a north of the Arctic breeze so I'm not
gonna<00:03:26.250> hang<00:03:26.459> out<00:03:26.579> here<00:03:26.639> too<00:03:26.970> long<00:03:27.209> so<00:03:27.450> we're

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 
gonna hang out here too long so we're

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:34.350 
gonna hang out here too long so we're
going<00:03:27.660> to<00:03:27.750> put<00:03:27.930> the<00:03:28.109> the<00:03:28.530> meat<00:03:28.680> on<00:03:28.889> the<00:03:28.919> grill

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.500 

okay

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
okay

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:37.809 
okay
that's<00:03:35.840> the<00:03:35.989> rotisserie<00:03:36.530> going<00:03:36.890> round<00:03:37.069> so

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:37.819 
that's the rotisserie going round so

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:40.510 
that's the rotisserie going round so
we'll<00:03:37.970> let<00:03:38.090> the<00:03:38.180> bacon<00:03:38.599> nicely<00:03:38.840> crisp<00:03:39.260> up<00:03:39.520> you

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:40.520 
we'll let the bacon nicely crisp up you

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.490 
we'll let the bacon nicely crisp up you
can<00:03:40.730> see<00:03:40.940> now<00:03:41.209> that<00:03:41.239> the<00:03:41.540> bacon<00:03:41.959> is<00:03:42.080> starting

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
can see now that the bacon is starting

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.400 
can see now that the bacon is starting
to<00:03:42.590> crisp<00:03:42.830> up<00:03:43.130> yet<00:03:43.430> the<00:03:43.580> meat<00:03:43.819> inside<00:03:44.330> is<00:03:44.930> still

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.410 
to crisp up yet the meat inside is still

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.589 
to crisp up yet the meat inside is still
raw<00:03:45.950> so<00:03:46.700> we're<00:03:46.880> going<00:03:46.970> to<00:03:47.060> take<00:03:47.239> that<00:03:47.390> off<00:03:47.569> now

00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:47.599 
raw so we're going to take that off now

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:51.280 
raw so we're going to take that off now
and<00:03:48.670> take<00:03:49.670> it<00:03:49.850> inside<00:03:50.180> and<00:03:50.510> let<00:03:50.840> it<00:03:51.020> cool<00:03:51.230> now

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
and take it inside and let it cool now

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.199 
and take it inside and let it cool now
it's<00:03:51.650> really<00:03:52.069> important<00:03:52.550> we<00:03:52.670> let<00:03:52.819> it<00:03:53.000> cool

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.209 
it's really important we let it cool

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:55.809 
it's really important we let it cool
because<00:03:53.810> there<00:03:54.290> the<00:03:54.800> fats<00:03:55.100> will<00:03:55.340> start<00:03:55.640> to

00:03:55.809 --> 00:03:55.819 
because there the fats will start to

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:57.850 
because there the fats will start to
solidify<00:03:56.030> again<00:03:56.750> and<00:03:56.959> that<00:03:57.410> will<00:03:57.590> keep<00:03:57.800> the

00:03:57.850 --> 00:03:57.860 
solidify again and that will keep the

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:00.729 
solidify again and that will keep the
bacon<00:03:58.340> wrap<00:03:58.580> around<00:03:58.850> the<00:03:58.970> joint<00:03:59.239> now<00:03:59.510> I<00:04:00.319> have

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:00.739 
bacon wrap around the joint now I have

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:03.070 
bacon wrap around the joint now I have
to<00:04:00.920> say<00:04:01.099> it's<00:04:01.390> absolutely<00:04:02.390> freezing<00:04:02.630> out<00:04:03.050> here

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:03.080 
to say it's absolutely freezing out here

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.380 
to say it's absolutely freezing out here
so<00:04:03.830> I'm<00:04:04.160> going<00:04:04.430> to<00:04:04.519> be<00:04:04.610> a<00:04:04.640> bit<00:04:04.790> of<00:04:04.819> a<00:04:04.970> big<00:04:05.150> girl's

grilling on the grill pan inside the
meats<00:04:12.110> now<00:04:12.380> had<00:04:12.560> chance<00:04:12.890> to<00:04:13.010> cool<00:04:13.370> and<00:04:13.910> you<00:04:14.000> can

meats now had chance to cool and you can

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.830 
meats now had chance to cool and you can
see<00:04:14.420> it's<00:04:14.720> you<00:04:15.019> know<00:04:15.739> it's<00:04:16.579> stuck<00:04:16.880> together<00:04:17.120> so

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:17.840 
see it's you know it's stuck together so

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:20.020 
see it's you know it's stuck together so
now<00:04:18.739> we're<00:04:18.889> going<00:04:19.010> to<00:04:19.070> cut<00:04:19.340> and<00:04:19.700> make<00:04:19.880> the

now we're going to cut and make the

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.530 
now we're going to cut and make the
steaks<00:04:20.359> and<00:04:20.989> it's<00:04:21.889> this<00:04:22.520> part<00:04:22.910> of<00:04:23.120> the<00:04:23.270> job

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:23.540 
steaks and it's this part of the job

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:30.010 
steaks and it's this part of the job
where<00:04:25.510> we<00:04:26.510> find<00:04:26.870> whether<00:04:27.410> the<00:04:27.680> bacon<00:04:29.020> remains

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:30.020 
where we find whether the bacon remains

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:36.850 
where we find whether the bacon remains
intact<00:04:30.770> and<00:04:33.130> attached<00:04:34.130> to<00:04:34.580> the<00:04:34.940> steak<00:04:35.860> let's

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
intact and attached to the steak let's

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:43.900 
intact and attached to the steak let's
see<00:04:37.070> how<00:04:37.190> it<00:04:37.340> goes

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:43.910 

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:50.290 

oh<00:04:45.790> look<00:04:46.790> at<00:04:46.970> that<00:04:48.670> they're<00:04:49.670> going<00:04:49.880> to<00:04:49.970> season

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:50.300 
oh look at that they're going to season

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:56.560 
oh look at that they're going to season
them<00:04:52.660> and<00:04:53.660> then<00:04:54.610> we<00:04:55.610> put<00:04:55.850> them<00:04:56.000> into<00:04:56.150> the<00:04:56.360> grill

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.570 
them and then we put them into the grill

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:01.480 
them and then we put them into the grill
pad<00:04:56.810> I<00:04:58.300> reckon<00:04:59.300> about<00:05:00.040> two<00:05:01.040> minutes<00:05:01.220> on<00:05:01.430> each

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:01.490 
pad I reckon about two minutes on each

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.680 
pad I reckon about two minutes on each
side<00:05:01.720> and<00:05:03.310> then<00:05:04.310> we<00:05:04.400> plate<00:05:04.610> up<00:05:04.790> and<00:05:05.390> when<00:05:05.660> we

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:05.690 
side and then we plate up and when we

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:07.930 
side and then we plate up and when we
plate<00:05:06.020> up<00:05:06.340> that's<00:05:07.340> when<00:05:07.550> we<00:05:07.670> take<00:05:07.850> the

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:07.940 
plate up that's when we take the

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:16.570 
plate up that's when we take the
cocktail<00:05:08.300> stick<00:05:08.540> out

00:05:16.570 --> 00:05:16.580 

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:18.760 

so<00:05:17.270> there<00:05:17.480> we<00:05:17.570> have<00:05:17.600> it<00:05:17.930> the<00:05:18.050> grilled<00:05:18.290> steak

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:18.770 
so there we have it the grilled steak

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.580 
so there we have it the grilled steak
all<00:05:19.100> we<00:05:19.490> need<00:05:19.670> now<00:05:19.880> to<00:05:19.910> do<00:05:20.270> is<00:05:20.540> take<00:05:20.900> out<00:05:21.170> the

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:21.590 
all we need now to do is take out the

00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:28.679 
all we need now to do is take out the
cocktail<00:05:21.860> stick

00:05:28.679 --> 00:05:28.689 

00:05:28.689 --> 00:05:31.769 

and<00:05:28.779> then<00:05:29.469> we<00:05:29.589> have<00:05:29.739> it<00:05:29.919> grilled<00:05:30.759> filet<00:05:31.269> mignon

00:05:31.769 --> 00:05:31.779
