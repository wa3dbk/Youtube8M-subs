00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.070 

now<00:00:03.010> anybody<00:00:03.280> who's<00:00:03.610> done<00:00:03.820> 3d<00:00:04.420> modeling<00:00:04.900> will

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:05.080 
now anybody who's done 3d modeling will

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:06.920 
now anybody who's done 3d modeling will
probably<00:00:05.440> be<00:00:05.529> familiar<00:00:05.770> with<00:00:06.160> boolean's

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
probably be familiar with boolean's

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.090 
probably be familiar with boolean's
boolean's<00:00:07.930> allow<00:00:08.200> you<00:00:08.260> to<00:00:08.410> take<00:00:08.590> multiple

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:09.100 
boolean's allow you to take multiple

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.520 
boolean's allow you to take multiple
objects<00:00:09.670> and<00:00:09.880> combine<00:00:10.660> them<00:00:10.930> to<00:00:10.960> either<00:00:11.260> add

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:11.530 
objects and combine them to either add

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.060 
objects and combine them to either add
or<00:00:11.920> subtract<00:00:12.700> detail<00:00:13.540> from<00:00:14.170> each<00:00:14.410> other

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:15.070 
or subtract detail from each other

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:16.890 
or subtract detail from each other
so<00:00:15.309> let's<00:00:15.460> go<00:00:15.580> ahead<00:00:15.790> and<00:00:16.000> start<00:00:16.330> off<00:00:16.540> with<00:00:16.869> a

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:16.900 
so let's go ahead and start off with a

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.840 
so let's go ahead and start off with a
very<00:00:17.380> simple<00:00:17.830> situation<00:00:18.250> I'm<00:00:18.610> going<00:00:18.730> to<00:00:18.789> go

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:18.850 
very simple situation I'm going to go

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.260 
very simple situation I'm going to go
ahead<00:00:18.970> and<00:00:19.119> start<00:00:19.360> off<00:00:19.630> with<00:00:20.110> a<00:00:20.760> cube<00:00:21.760> here<00:00:22.240> and

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:22.270 
ahead and start off with a cube here and

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:25.140 
ahead and start off with a cube here and
then<00:00:22.990> inside<00:00:23.619> of<00:00:23.680> it<00:00:23.980> I'm<00:00:24.160> going<00:00:24.340> to<00:00:24.460> draw<00:00:24.789> a

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:25.150 
then inside of it I'm going to draw a

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.640 
then inside of it I'm going to draw a
little<00:00:25.990> bit<00:00:26.140> of<00:00:26.500> a<00:00:27.539> cylinder<00:00:28.539> and<00:00:29.140> I'm<00:00:29.500> going

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:29.650 
little bit of a cylinder and I'm going

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:31.589 
little bit of a cylinder and I'm going
to<00:00:29.680> go<00:00:29.830> ahead<00:00:29.920> and<00:00:30.310> move<00:00:30.550> that<00:00:30.820> cylinder<00:00:31.420> up

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:31.599 
to go ahead and move that cylinder up

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:34.380 
to go ahead and move that cylinder up
and<00:00:32.190> let's<00:00:33.190> shade<00:00:33.430> everything<00:00:33.699> so<00:00:34.000> we<00:00:34.090> can<00:00:34.210> see

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:34.390 
and let's shade everything so we can see

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.930 
and let's shade everything so we can see
what<00:00:34.570> we've<00:00:34.690> got<00:00:34.900> here<00:00:35.370> so<00:00:36.370> now<00:00:36.489> I've<00:00:36.580> got<00:00:36.729> this

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:36.940 
what we've got here so now I've got this

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.590 
what we've got here so now I've got this
cylinder<00:00:37.420> and<00:00:37.780> it's<00:00:38.170> kind<00:00:38.409> of<00:00:38.500> poking<00:00:39.129> into

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
cylinder and it's kind of poking into

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.899 
cylinder and it's kind of poking into
this<00:00:40.600> cue<00:00:40.989> and<00:00:41.199> so<00:00:41.530> what<00:00:41.680> I<00:00:41.739> want<00:00:41.920> to<00:00:41.979> do<00:00:42.159> is<00:00:42.430> use

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:42.909 
this cue and so what I want to do is use

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:45.240 
this cue and so what I want to do is use
the<00:00:43.180> cylinder<00:00:43.690> as<00:00:43.900> kind<00:00:44.290> of<00:00:44.379> a<00:00:44.530> cutting<00:00:44.979> tool

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.250 
the cylinder as kind of a cutting tool

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.729 
the cylinder as kind of a cutting tool
to<00:00:45.610> actually<00:00:45.729> cut<00:00:46.150> into<00:00:46.780> the<00:00:47.019> surface<00:00:47.440> of<00:00:47.589> the

00:00:47.729 --> 00:00:47.739 
to actually cut into the surface of the

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:50.009 
to actually cut into the surface of the
cube<00:00:48.010> and<00:00:48.159> we<00:00:48.250> can<00:00:48.370> do<00:00:48.519> that<00:00:48.699> by<00:00:49.269> using<00:00:49.510> boolean

00:00:50.009 --> 00:00:50.019 
cube and we can do that by using boolean

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:51.960 
cube and we can do that by using boolean
now<00:00:50.680> bullying's<00:00:51.190> are<00:00:51.309> actually<00:00:51.610> found

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:51.970 
now bullying's are actually found

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.810 
now bullying's are actually found
underneath<00:00:52.780> the<00:00:53.229> mesh<00:00:53.559> menu<00:00:53.979> and<00:00:54.430> there's

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:54.820 
underneath the mesh menu and there's

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.880 
underneath the mesh menu and there's
actually<00:00:55.150> a<00:00:55.210> submenu<00:00:55.869> here<00:00:56.290> because<00:00:56.710> there's

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:56.890 
actually a submenu here because there's

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.009 
actually a submenu here because there's
three<00:00:57.159> types<00:00:57.460> of<00:00:57.670> boolean<00:00:57.940> there's<00:00:58.510> Union

00:00:59.009 --> 00:00:59.019 
three types of boolean there's Union

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:02.729 
three types of boolean there's Union
difference<00:00:59.860> and<00:01:00.540> intersection<00:01:01.559> so<00:01:02.559> let's

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:02.739 
difference and intersection so let's

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:04.410 
difference and intersection so let's
take<00:01:02.860> a<00:01:02.890> look<00:01:03.100> at<00:01:03.190> how<00:01:03.339> these<00:01:03.549> work<00:01:03.940> in<00:01:04.210> fact

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.420 
take a look at how these work in fact

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.410 
take a look at how these work in fact
I'm<00:01:04.570> going<00:01:04.690> to<00:01:04.750> turn<00:01:05.049> on<00:01:05.260> x-ray<00:01:06.159> and<00:01:06.399> also<00:01:07.060> turn

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
I'm going to turn on x-ray and also turn

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.139 
I'm going to turn on x-ray and also turn
on<00:01:07.950> wireframe<00:01:08.950> on<00:01:09.310> shaded<00:01:09.369> so<00:01:09.820> you<00:01:09.880> can<00:01:09.969> kind

00:01:10.139 --> 00:01:10.149 
on wireframe on shaded so you can kind

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:11.999 
on wireframe on shaded so you can kind
of<00:01:10.240> see<00:01:10.390> what<00:01:10.570> we've<00:01:10.719> got<00:01:10.960> here<00:01:11.289> so<00:01:11.770> I'm<00:01:11.890> going

00:01:11.999 --> 00:01:12.009 
of see what we've got here so I'm going

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:14.429 
of see what we've got here so I'm going
to<00:01:12.039> go<00:01:12.159> ahead<00:01:12.369> and<00:01:12.579> select<00:01:12.820> my<00:01:13.570> cube<00:01:13.869> first<00:01:14.200> and

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:14.439 
to go ahead and select my cube first and

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:16.260 
to go ahead and select my cube first and
my<00:01:14.619> cylinder<00:01:14.979> second<00:01:15.579> and<00:01:15.729> let's<00:01:15.939> just<00:01:16.090> go

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
my cylinder second and let's just go

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.120 
my cylinder second and let's just go
ahead<00:01:16.509> and<00:01:16.719> go<00:01:16.869> down<00:01:16.899> these<00:01:17.380> so<00:01:17.859> let's<00:01:18.039> go

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130 
ahead and go down these so let's go

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:19.830 
ahead and go down these so let's go
ahead<00:01:18.280> and<00:01:18.369> take<00:01:18.490> a<00:01:18.520> look<00:01:18.759> at<00:01:18.909> union<00:01:19.390> what

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:19.840 
ahead and take a look at union what

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.499 
ahead and take a look at union what
Union<00:01:20.289> does<00:01:20.530> is<00:01:20.829> it<00:01:21.130> actually<00:01:21.310> combines<00:01:22.060> the

00:01:22.499 --> 00:01:22.509 
Union does is it actually combines the

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:24.990 
Union does is it actually combines the
two<00:01:22.840> into<00:01:23.590> one<00:01:23.619> object<00:01:24.070> so<00:01:24.729> let's<00:01:24.880> go<00:01:24.939> ahead

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 
two into one object so let's go ahead

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.849 
two into one object so let's go ahead
and<00:01:25.179> turn<00:01:25.299> off<00:01:25.359> x-ray<00:01:26.109> so<00:01:26.170> we<00:01:26.439> can<00:01:26.590> actually

00:01:26.849 --> 00:01:26.859 
and turn off x-ray so we can actually

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:29.010 
and turn off x-ray so we can actually
see<00:01:27.100> this<00:01:27.310> and<00:01:27.609> now<00:01:27.729> I've<00:01:27.939> got<00:01:28.179> both<00:01:28.450> of<00:01:28.719> these

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
see this and now I've got both of these

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.679 
see this and now I've got both of these
combined<00:01:29.530> into<00:01:29.920> one<00:01:30.100> object<00:01:30.609> but<00:01:30.729> also<00:01:30.759> their

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:31.689 
combined into one object but also their

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:33.690 
combined into one object but also their
faces<00:01:32.259> are<00:01:32.380> kind<00:01:32.590> of<00:01:32.679> welded<00:01:33.070> together<00:01:33.189> so<00:01:33.609> for

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
faces are kind of welded together so for

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.029 
faces are kind of welded together so for
example<00:01:34.119> if<00:01:34.210> I<00:01:34.359> were<00:01:34.539> to<00:01:34.570> model<00:01:35.170> this<00:01:35.409> you<00:01:35.890> can

00:01:36.029 --> 00:01:36.039 
example if I were to model this you can

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:38.340 
example if I were to model this you can
see<00:01:36.249> how<00:01:36.520> it<00:01:37.060> all<00:01:37.299> kind<00:01:37.689> of<00:01:37.780> sticks<00:01:38.079> together

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
see how it all kind of sticks together

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.940 
see how it all kind of sticks together
so<00:01:39.070> if<00:01:39.280> I<00:01:39.490> were<00:01:39.670> to<00:01:39.909> take<00:01:40.179> for<00:01:40.719> example<00:01:40.920> some<00:01:41.920> of

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
so if I were to take for example some of

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.340 
so if I were to take for example some of
these<00:01:42.130> vertices<00:01:42.549> it<00:01:43.329> all<00:01:43.600> kind<00:01:43.929> of<00:01:44.020> holds

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
these vertices it all kind of holds

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.050 
these vertices it all kind of holds
together<00:01:44.560> so<00:01:45.490> I'm<00:01:45.549> going<00:01:45.670> to<00:01:45.729> go<00:01:45.789> ahead<00:01:45.880> and

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
together so I'm going to go ahead and

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.989 
together so I'm going to go ahead and
undo<00:01:46.179> this<00:01:46.719> turn<00:01:47.530> on<00:01:47.679> x-ray<00:01:48.399> again<00:01:48.609> so<00:01:48.789> we<00:01:48.880> can

00:01:48.989 --> 00:01:48.999 
undo this turn on x-ray again so we can

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:50.849 
undo this turn on x-ray again so we can
see<00:01:49.149> what<00:01:49.299> happens<00:01:49.719> now<00:01:50.200> the<00:01:50.289> next<00:01:50.649> one<00:01:50.829> is

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:50.859 
see what happens now the next one is

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:52.889 
see what happens now the next one is
called<00:01:51.310> difference<00:01:51.999> and<00:01:52.179> what<00:01:52.299> this<00:01:52.420> is<00:01:52.659> is<00:01:52.869> a

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:52.899 
called difference and what this is is a

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:54.779 
called difference and what this is is a
great<00:01:53.200> way<00:01:53.350> to<00:01:53.380> cut<00:01:53.679> holes<00:01:53.920> in<00:01:54.310> fact<00:01:54.549> let's

00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:54.789 
great way to cut holes in fact let's

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:56.580 
great way to cut holes in fact let's
turn<00:01:55.060> off<00:01:55.299> x-ray<00:01:55.719> so<00:01:55.780> you<00:01:55.990> can<00:01:56.109> actually<00:01:56.289> see

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:56.590 
turn off x-ray so you can actually see

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:59.190 
turn off x-ray so you can actually see
how<00:01:56.740> this<00:01:56.890> works<00:01:57.219> shaded<00:01:57.939> so<00:01:58.479> when<00:01:58.689> I<00:01:58.719> select

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
how this works shaded so when I select

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.260 
how this works shaded so when I select
difference<00:02:00.039> what<00:02:00.490> this<00:02:00.639> going<00:02:00.850> to<00:02:00.909> do<00:02:01.030> is<00:02:01.149> the

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
difference what this going to do is the

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.359 
difference what this going to do is the
last<00:02:01.509> object<00:02:02.289> picked<00:02:02.679> is<00:02:02.920> going<00:02:03.130> to<00:02:03.189> cut<00:02:03.340> a

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369 
last object picked is going to cut a

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:06.029 
last object picked is going to cut a
hole<00:02:03.609> in<00:02:03.819> the<00:02:04.389> first<00:02:04.630> object<00:02:05.139> pit<00:02:05.350> so<00:02:05.679> now<00:02:05.829> this

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:06.039 
hole in the first object pit so now this

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:07.770 
hole in the first object pit so now this
is<00:02:06.189> a<00:02:06.219> great<00:02:06.429> way<00:02:06.609> to<00:02:06.639> create<00:02:07.119> a<00:02:07.270> little<00:02:07.539> bit<00:02:07.719> of

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:07.780 
is a great way to create a little bit of

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.800 
is a great way to create a little bit of
a<00:02:07.929> hole<00:02:08.170> in<00:02:08.560> the<00:02:09.399> cube<00:02:09.700> so<00:02:10.239> let's<00:02:10.479> go<00:02:10.569> ahead<00:02:10.720> and

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:10.810 
a hole in the cube so let's go ahead and

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.210 
a hole in the cube so let's go ahead and
undo<00:02:10.959> that<00:02:11.140> and<00:02:11.560> we're<00:02:11.650> going<00:02:11.769> to<00:02:11.799> do<00:02:11.920> one<00:02:12.099> more

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
undo that and we're going to do one more

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.770 
undo that and we're going to do one more
let's<00:02:12.400> see<00:02:12.610> what<00:02:12.760> intersection<00:02:13.420> looks<00:02:13.599> like

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
let's see what intersection looks like

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.960 
let's see what intersection looks like
an<00:02:13.900> intersection<00:02:14.319> really<00:02:14.769> carves<00:02:15.310> away<00:02:15.549> every

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
an intersection really carves away every

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.110 
an intersection really carves away every
thing<00:02:16.180> but<00:02:16.660> what's<00:02:17.320> common<00:02:17.830> to<00:02:17.860> both<00:02:18.220> so<00:02:18.850> in

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
thing but what's common to both so in

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.390 
thing but what's common to both so in
this<00:02:19.270> case<00:02:19.540> it'll<00:02:19.780> be<00:02:19.990> just<00:02:20.320> that<00:02:20.560> lower<00:02:20.890> part

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
this case it'll be just that lower part

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.630 
this case it'll be just that lower part
of<00:02:21.840> the<00:02:22.840> cylinder<00:02:23.350> let's<00:02:24.070> go<00:02:24.190> ahead<00:02:24.280> and<00:02:24.460> go

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
of the cylinder let's go ahead and go

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:26.040 
of the cylinder let's go ahead and go
back<00:02:24.670> to<00:02:25.120> difference<00:02:25.540> I'm<00:02:25.690> going<00:02:25.810> to<00:02:25.870> go<00:02:25.960> ahead

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
back to difference I'm going to go ahead

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:27.960 
back to difference I'm going to go ahead
and<00:02:26.200> select<00:02:26.350> this<00:02:26.680> and<00:02:26.890> let's<00:02:27.040> do<00:02:27.280> difference

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:27.970 
and select this and let's do difference

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.460 
and select this and let's do difference
again<00:02:28.300> and<00:02:28.600> one<00:02:28.900> of<00:02:28.960> the<00:02:29.020> things<00:02:29.170> I<00:02:29.260> want<00:02:29.440> to

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
again and one of the things I want to

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:32.790 
again and one of the things I want to
show<00:02:29.800> you<00:02:29.860> is<00:02:30.340> that<00:02:30.480> boolean<00:02:31.480> is<00:02:31.900> great<00:02:32.410> for

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
show you is that boolean is great for

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.830 
show you is that boolean is great for
creating<00:02:33.070> these<00:02:33.400> sorts<00:02:33.790> of<00:02:33.880> surfaces<00:02:34.480> but<00:02:34.630> as

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
creating these sorts of surfaces but as

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.290 
creating these sorts of surfaces but as
soon<00:02:35.200> as<00:02:35.500> the<00:02:35.710> surface<00:02:36.190> starts<00:02:36.550> to<00:02:36.790> deform

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:37.300 
soon as the surface starts to deform

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.360 
soon as the surface starts to deform
you're<00:02:37.960> going<00:02:38.170> to<00:02:38.230> have<00:02:38.410> problems<00:02:38.920> so<00:02:39.160> I

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.370 
you're going to have problems so I

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:42.570 
you're going to have problems so I
really<00:02:39.880> recommend<00:02:40.150> boolean's<00:02:40.930> just<00:02:41.440> for<00:02:41.860> what

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
really recommend boolean's just for what

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.670 
really recommend boolean's just for what
I<00:02:42.610> would<00:02:42.730> call<00:02:43.000> hard<00:02:43.360> surfaces<00:02:44.050> things<00:02:44.410> that

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
I would call hard surfaces things that

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.740 
I would call hard surfaces things that
don't<00:02:44.860> change<00:02:45.040> shape<00:02:45.850> because<00:02:46.270> as<00:02:46.420> soon<00:02:46.600> as

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:46.750 
don't change shape because as soon as

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:49.740 
don't change shape because as soon as
you<00:02:46.870> start<00:02:47.140> modeling<00:02:47.740> into<00:02:48.459> a<00:02:48.760> surface<00:02:49.450> that's

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
you start modeling into a surface that's

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.300 
you start modeling into a surface that's
had<00:02:50.050> boolean's<00:02:50.590> you're<00:02:50.740> going<00:02:50.890> to<00:02:50.950> start<00:02:51.190> to

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
had boolean's you're going to start to

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.340 
had boolean's you're going to start to
get<00:02:51.459> really<00:02:52.060> weird<00:02:52.300> artifacts<00:02:52.990> so<00:02:53.200> for

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:53.350 
get really weird artifacts so for

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:54.900 
get really weird artifacts so for
example<00:02:53.680> if<00:02:53.770> I<00:02:53.830> wanted<00:02:54.070> to<00:02:54.160> move<00:02:54.250> these<00:02:54.490> around

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
example if I wanted to move these around

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:57.090 
example if I wanted to move these around
you're<00:02:55.780> going<00:02:55.930> to<00:02:55.990> start<00:02:56.230> to<00:02:56.350> get<00:02:56.470> like<00:02:56.920> little

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
you're going to start to get like little

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.890 
you're going to start to get like little
creases<00:02:57.640> you<00:02:57.790> can<00:02:57.910> kind<00:02:58.120> of<00:02:58.180> see<00:02:58.360> this<00:02:58.510> crease

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:58.900 
creases you can kind of see this crease

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.020 
creases you can kind of see this crease
coming<00:02:59.260> up<00:02:59.380> here<00:02:59.709> and<00:02:59.860> when<00:03:00.250> you<00:03:00.310> go<00:03:00.430> to<00:03:00.459> render

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
coming up here and when you go to render

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.240 
coming up here and when you go to render
if<00:03:01.240> you've<00:03:01.750> changed<00:03:02.350> the<00:03:02.500> shape<00:03:02.770> of<00:03:02.830> the

if you've changed the shape of the
object<00:03:03.730> in<00:03:03.910> any<00:03:04.120> way<00:03:04.450> after<00:03:05.290> you<00:03:05.380> do<00:03:05.500> a<00:03:05.530> boolean

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
object in any way after you do a boolean

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.580 
object in any way after you do a boolean
there's<00:03:06.610> a<00:03:06.820> possibility<00:03:07.720> that<00:03:07.990> you're<00:03:08.380> going

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
there's a possibility that you're going

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:10.410 
there's a possibility that you're going
to<00:03:08.650> get<00:03:08.800> creases<00:03:09.190> and<00:03:09.550> wrinkles<00:03:09.760> and<00:03:10.240> all

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
to get creases and wrinkles and all

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.160 
to get creases and wrinkles and all
sorts<00:03:10.840> of<00:03:10.900> weird<00:03:11.140> effects<00:03:11.620> on<00:03:11.950> your<00:03:12.490> object

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
sorts of weird effects on your object

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.810 
sorts of weird effects on your object
boolean's<00:03:14.170> work<00:03:14.560> great<00:03:14.920> but<00:03:15.310> they're<00:03:15.459> really

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:15.820 
boolean's work great but they're really

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.990 
boolean's work great but they're really
best<00:03:16.270> for<00:03:16.810> hard<00:03:17.350> surface<00:03:17.890> solid<00:03:18.220> objects<00:03:18.880> that

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
best for hard surface solid objects that

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.630 
best for hard surface solid objects that
don't<00:03:19.150> deform
