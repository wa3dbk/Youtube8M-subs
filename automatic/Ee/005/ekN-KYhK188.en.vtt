00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.199
 Hello everyone , as always Dima 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.619
 Galdi 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.930
 and we start today 18 graduation schools by 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:24.779
 Max line I will tell my way 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.460
 learning rear vipov you all know fit 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.680
 this trick of all casting learn 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.859
 sector so I took tutorial and this one 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.950
 the moment has come immediately we force this trick 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:37.110
 not easy and you need to have to learn 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.379
 a good base trick they can do everything 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.210
 initial tricks and preferably such to me 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.969
 love the so-called second level 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.190
 all sorts of treshki turn and well hands 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.289
 and so on here but the Cuba for example you 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.390
 must be mandatory because if you 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.370
 can't just pour their legs off with 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:55.649
 pedal potapov dance to a place like you 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.050
 going to take off spin spin 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.890
 legs catching there and so on after yourself 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.050
 think logically 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.619
 which is easier just to remove the legs or 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.600
 fly out spin in hail and catch 

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:07.990
 let's start learning now 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.880
 myself to 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.280
 teaches this trick you need or 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.590
 radius then he needs to be either land well or 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:17.259
 concrete how can you learn from 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:19.570
 kicker from a ticker bannik but process 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:23.200
 this one will go a lot much harder and 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:25.630
 learning will take longer so 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:29.380
 I recommend first try tour 

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:31.420
 on the back it is elementary strain your hands 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.330
 push and back of aids foot 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:41.110
 help the rotation of your hands and catch 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:43.179
 half an hour we will probably learn for 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:46.509
 account of this you will understand how in general 

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:48.640
 you do uvipe yes try with 

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:51.250
 apron let's just roll up 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.729
 or try to see from the cat so will 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.979
 easier 

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:56.250
 what exactly should you do here 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:58.450
 look do a little bath-hop 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.369
 wash the steering wheel to the side 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.350
 why are you pushing off the pedals and 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:05.110
 at the same time push 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.270
 back foot frame if you have with your left 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:10.690
 leg sphere you must steer the wheel to the right 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.970
 and interpret the frame with your right foot again 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.370
 the driver needs to side and slightly forward 

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:19.180
 so you got it you need 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:21.099
 rather strain your hands next 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:24.040
 stage is try all the same 

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:26.290
 only already from the departure here you should not 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.900
 just take the steering wheel to the side and do 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.180
 wheel spin if you have it 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.400
 I can not try just on the ground 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.420
 spin the bike learn to do 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.099
 two or three turns 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.040
 this will be enough to 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:41.560
 understand how this happens but not 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.750
 forget that the process of rotation we 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.170
 should be like over the bike over 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.290
 driving 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.880
 bike should not go ahead and sos 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:53.349
 you can't do it as I said 

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:55.360
 strain your hands this was the first 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:58.000
 moment the second moment is 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:00.010
 that your kick and the rotation of your hands 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.100
 all this should be in resonance 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:05.200
 that is all done at the same time it 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.030
 how would one move you fly 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.190
 start making the wheel spin 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:12.220
 at the same time push the frame and foot 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:14.290
 so help the rotation itself and after that 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:17.810
 you should try to land in two 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.760
 legs at the same time and a bicycle near 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.489
 the next step after you brought 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.050
 all that I say earlier to automatism 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:26.810
 try to put the frame leading foot 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:28.400
 if watts left foot is in front like mine 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:31.459
 then you must catch her 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.810
 Put it on the crank at first 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:35.569
 most likely you will not be able to 

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:38.390
 This is due to the fact that when you drive 

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:40.670
 steering forward right then you do 

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:42.860
 roundabout followed by a bicycle 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:44.060
 is on the right and you should have u return 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.310
 back for yourself 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:49.090
 for this you are driving the wheel 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:51.370
 to the left but during all this rotation 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:54.470
 lie down over the bike 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:56.930
 remember this i its all good 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.760
 who do the bicycle for the sheet to you 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:01.730
 under your feet and there is only left 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:04.430
 catching I recommend the role of the night set 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:06.769
 between the legs their front throws it very 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:10.099
 just really and of course learn right away 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:11.260
 catch the rod further if everything goes blind 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:13.280
 ok then you can 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.500
 concentrate on not to 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.959
 put your back foot on the ground and she herself 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:19.549
 get on the pedal or you will see with one 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:21.919
 foot without touching the ground 

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:24.680
 if you have a brake then clamp it 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:26.770
 in the middle of the rotation this will facilitate the process 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.360
 uve on his catch 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:33.490
 I can train by the way just 

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.490
 twist the aroma and jump in on the column 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:41.090
 to make a vip softer and not beat 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:42.560
 leg you need to catch earlier that is 

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:45.169
 as soon as they flew out 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:48.010
 twist the rear and sanju take a step and 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:48.010
 try to catch 

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:57.470
 if you do it all the time and by the bottom 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:59.750
 leg and can not catch a twin 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:02.030
 just imagine how you are doing 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:03.260
 think on the back foot if you 

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:05.180
 you can imagine all this and 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:08.169
 will control the head then you can 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:08.169
 do it in real 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:11.650
 At the first stages you will have 3 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.660
 get well 

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:16.240
 but over time if you will be many 

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:18.700
 ride to train then all movements 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:19.120
 on will reach automatism and will be one 

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.360
 whole 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.290
 remember that the authors of the case by important 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:26.680
 one hundred percent concentration during 

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:28.870
 of all the trick she has today is all this 

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.140
 There was a rear tutorial and he liked it 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:31.000
 this 

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:33.430
 This release put Like necessarily 

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.530
 save sign up whoever else 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:36.940
 did not do it yourself was Dima garvey and 

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:40.560
 see you in the next video 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:40.560
 to new meetings bye
