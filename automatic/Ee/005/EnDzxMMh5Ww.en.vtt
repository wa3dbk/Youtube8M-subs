that look and just keep doing that but

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.650 
that look and just keep doing that but
we<00:02:15.490> get<00:02:16.770> it<00:02:17.770> closed<00:02:18.130> in<00:02:18.430> as<00:02:18.820> much<00:02:19.090> as<00:02:19.330> you<00:02:19.450> like

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:35.030 

and<00:02:31.230> what<00:02:31.379> I<00:02:31.409> did<00:02:31.650> for<00:02:31.859> the<00:02:31.950> center<00:02:33.230> was<00:02:34.230> clip<00:02:35.010> a

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:35.040 
and what I did for the center was clip a

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.089 
and what I did for the center was clip a
few<00:02:35.459> of<00:02:35.579> them<00:02:35.730> down<00:02:36.590> okay<00:02:37.590> so<00:02:37.650> I'm<00:02:37.829> just<00:02:37.980> going

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
few of them down okay so I'm just going

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:45.349

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:45.359 
to clip the ends off and put some

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:49.580 
to clip the ends off and put some
shorter<00:02:45.870> ones<00:02:46.079> in<00:02:46.349> there<00:02:48.200> because<00:02:49.200> I'm<00:02:49.379> going

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:49.590 
shorter ones in there because I'm going

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.110 
shorter ones in there because I'm going
to<00:02:49.739> actually<00:02:49.889> cover<00:02:50.250> this<00:02:50.430> up<00:02:50.579> with<00:02:50.760> glitter

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
to actually cover this up with glitter

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.300 
to actually cover this up with glitter
so<00:02:51.329> I'm<00:02:51.389> not<00:02:51.540> too<00:02:51.599> worried<00:02:52.079> about<00:02:52.310> those

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
so I'm not too worried about those

00:02:53.310 --> 00:03:00.800 
so I'm not too worried about those
layers<00:02:53.639> there<00:02:55.639> to<00:02:56.639> this<00:02:56.849> dumb<00:02:59.450> pull<00:03:00.450> it<00:03:00.629> out<00:03:00.780> a

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:20.750 

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:27.050 

oops<00:05:24.560> just<00:05:25.560> move<00:05:25.860> them<00:05:26.039> around<00:05:26.190> wait<00:05:26.789> like

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.060 
oops just move them around wait like

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:40.700

them

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:40.710 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:44.700 

my<00:05:41.710> glue<00:05:42.009> on<00:05:42.160> my<00:05:42.190> bench<00:05:43.080> all<00:05:44.080> right<00:05:44.320> and<00:05:44.590> I

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:12.390 
different sizes just using different
size<00:07:09.820> circles<00:07:09.850> so<00:07:10.570> this<00:07:10.750> was<00:07:10.930> the<00:07:10.960> larger<00:07:11.560> one

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:12.400 
size circles so this was the larger one

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:14.430

00:07:16.710 --> 00:07:16.720 
different size circle punches to make us

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:19.680 
different size circle punches to make us
more<00:07:16.750> just<00:07:17.380> slightly<00:07:17.530> smaller<00:07:18.130> one<00:07:18.370> and<00:07:18.690> I've
