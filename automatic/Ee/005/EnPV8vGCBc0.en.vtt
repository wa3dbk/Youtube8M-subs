00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 steam that's it I finally finally finally 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.859
 I like the game and a few minutes I 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.200
 made in two matches with my new 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.550
 team 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.559
 here is my credit list but small 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.570
 card I currently have transferred 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.820
 bronze packs hoping that it 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.380
 starts to sell a little bit I 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.340
 some cards for sale we'll see 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:26.580
 I have a code with my game that allowed me 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.470
 to have four gold packets hoping 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.480
 that I have something quite a lot of them 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.510
 open with you this will be the first 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.320
 opening of packages and on fifa 14 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.360
 ultimate team 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.190
 hope we have something 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:45.239
 rather not bad it's gone for the 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:48.120
 first package to go suspense and ben 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:52.649
 here we can not say that I could have 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:54.480
 to have better I laughed notice handles I 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:59.280
 increased my transfer list which is 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:01.710
 from 30 of origin grew up to 50 of 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.570
 possibilities that we have in the in the 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.850
 catalog is so it's the first thing 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.180
 that I almost do it is rather 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:10.680
 interesting so the referral the cards 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.189
 verbalize of transfer and nothing 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.890
 exciting 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:18.270
 I will keep the contract cards that 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:20.700
 we will serve for later first 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.400
 style map I do not know this well at 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.540
 dallas in front if it's worth the money 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:28.409
 all this I'll keep it for now 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.610
 I will dig to see if what it's worth 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.270
 maybe it's worth a lot maybe 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:36.720
 not in any case we'll see that well 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:41.009
 sends it to the transfer ideas and the 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:45.930
 stays at his second package going 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:48.180
 open this one it does not change anything you 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:52.680
 tell me but good suspense what is that 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:57.770
 it's going to go go it's called a 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:59.909
 terrible at all we will continue 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.640
 now these are the free frames 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.950
 we will not complain about it 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.590
 to the transfer list for the 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.479
 moment I see it without really looking 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.679
 I frame it maybe is some 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.159
 players in the world 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:18.629
 for the championships so I'm going to see 

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:20.219
 what I will keep for the moment I 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:21.810
 put everything in France to show you what 

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:24.120
 that I will have for all are a 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.590
 little bit together on this opening 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.640
 easter see what I can have 

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.859
 interesting 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:32.790
 that also I send it and lawrence stoke 

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:34.859
 I will keep my six for the woman 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.150
 a few souls brought happiness to see mark 

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:40.290
 coxon is not that there is only one 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:41.730
 gold card so it's not that less good 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.950
 than the usual, but it's 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.909
 always won, so here we go 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.709
 not complain it will always do 

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:48.750
 some cards have so that's 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.959
 interesting we create a particular 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:56.010
 still i guess 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:59.579
 fa it seems to me in any case that's it 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:07.370
 just a brazilian defender a 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:07.370
 English coach right defender 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:11.669
 I may have to store them because my 

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:13.019
 core team 

00:03:11.669 --> 00:03:14.340
 I do not know if you had seen my 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:15.870
 basic team and there is a lot of Spanish 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.579
 even though I already have no agreement at this 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:22.829
 team that I bought with the following 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:24.769
 credits I may want to keep it for 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:28.680
 the moment I keep it will be seen well after 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:31.199
 that I'm going to put on sale a new one 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.729
 style artists do not know what that 

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:34.310
 you will I keep you informed if 

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:37.340
 it's cards that are interesting 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:42.019
 jaurÃ¨s has no list of transfers 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:46.199
 also that too to raise the stock 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:48.540
 I noticed just before I kept 

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:51.540
 the Sentinel 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.799
 I put it on transfer of disease 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.729
 the moment I will not keep lucie from 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:55.739

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:59.609

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:00.810
 package it's Romanian messi in and click 

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:03.299

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.549
 will carry customs finally everyone believes that 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:08.939
 what he wants to see see if he has to 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:11.780
 have at least a quarter of an hour a 

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:14.040
 rare player but no it's not the case 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:15.389
 he is a first-class league keeper 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.400
 too bad I got a package of 

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:21.489
