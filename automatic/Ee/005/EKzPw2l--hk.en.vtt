00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
preference as you can see this is a

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.490 
preference as you can see this is a
charging<00:01:10.920> pad<00:01:11.159> and<00:01:11.460> it's<00:01:12.119> not<00:01:12.330> that<00:01:12.570> big<00:01:12.869> so

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
charging pad and it's not that big so

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.980

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
let me put the s4 on here so the

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.780 
let me put the s4 on here so the
charging<00:01:16.380> pad<00:01:16.560> is<00:01:16.740> just<00:01:17.070> a<00:01:17.189> little<00:01:17.460> bit<00:01:17.580> bigger

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
charging pad is just a little bit bigger

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.170 
charging pad is just a little bit bigger
than<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.090> Galaxy<00:01:18.570> Note<00:01:18.600> 2<00:01:19.820> you<00:01:20.820> can<00:01:20.970> see<00:01:21.150> that

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
than the Galaxy Note 2 you can see that

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.240 
than the Galaxy Note 2 you can see that

this<00:01:58.890> thing<00:01:59.130> is<00:01:59.280> thicker<00:01:59.640> than<00:01:59.759> I<00:02:00.030> expected<00:02:00.290> if

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
this thing is thicker than I expected if

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.530 
this thing is thicker than I expected if
i<00:02:01.469> had<00:02:01.649> to<00:02:01.740> guess<00:02:01.770> maybe<00:02:02.189> it<00:02:02.399> is<00:02:02.549> two<00:02:02.850> to<00:02:03.210> three

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
i had to guess maybe it is two to three

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.660 
i had to guess maybe it is two to three
times<00:02:03.570> thicker<00:02:04.110> than<00:02:04.259> your<00:02:04.680> original<00:02:04.890> cover

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
times thicker than your original cover

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.210 
times thicker than your original cover
and<00:02:05.939> that<00:02:06.810> might<00:02:06.960> pose<00:02:07.140> a<00:02:07.200> problem<00:02:07.619> depending

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
and that might pose a problem depending

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.550 
and that might pose a problem depending
on<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.459> case<00:02:08.670> you<00:02:08.910> wanted<00:02:09.209> to<00:02:09.390> use<00:02:09.569> let's<00:02:10.319> talk

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
on the case you wanted to use let's talk

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.979 
on the case you wanted to use let's talk
about<00:02:10.770> that<00:02:11.099> in<00:02:11.310> a<00:02:11.430> little<00:02:11.580> bit<00:02:11.730> so<00:02:12.629> this<00:02:12.959> is

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
about that in a little bit so this is

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:14.070 
about that in a little bit so this is
something<00:02:13.410> interesting

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
something interesting

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.350 
something interesting
I<00:02:14.110> wasn't<00:02:14.650> expecting<00:02:14.890> this<00:02:15.370> but<00:02:15.610> what<00:02:16.090> this<00:02:16.300> is

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
I wasn't expecting this but what this is

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.410 
I wasn't expecting this but what this is
is<00:02:16.960> a<00:02:17.020> choke<00:02:17.620> filter<00:02:18.190> made<00:02:18.610> of<00:02:18.760> Magnus<00:02:19.210> and

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
is a choke filter made of Magnus and

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.090 
is a choke filter made of Magnus and
you're<00:02:19.690> supposed<00:02:19.930> to<00:02:20.110> put<00:02:20.380> this<00:02:20.500> on<00:02:20.680> your<00:02:20.800> USB

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:21.100 
you're supposed to put this on your USB

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:25.050 
you're supposed to put this on your USB
cable<00:02:21.760> it<00:02:22.330> has<00:02:22.510> a<00:02:22.540> big<00:02:22.840> TDK<00:02:23.410> logo<00:02:23.830> on<00:02:23.980> it<00:02:24.190> what

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
cable it has a big TDK logo on it what

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.180 
cable it has a big TDK logo on it what
this<00:02:25.240> thing<00:02:25.540> does<00:02:25.570> is<00:02:26.050> it<00:02:26.290> blocks<00:02:26.740> the<00:02:26.920> AC

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:27.190 
this thing does is it blocks the AC

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.060 
this thing does is it blocks the AC
current<00:02:27.610> but<00:02:28.390> lets<00:02:28.660> the<00:02:28.930> DC<00:02:29.350> current<00:02:29.560> through

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
current but lets the DC current through

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.970 
current but lets the DC current through
so<00:02:30.820> let's<00:02:31.060> get<00:02:31.300> the<00:02:31.450> show<00:02:31.480> on<00:02:31.690> the<00:02:31.840> road<00:02:31.990> let<00:02:32.830> me

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
so let's get the show on the road let me

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.190 
so let's get the show on the road let me
plug<00:02:33.250> this<00:02:33.400> thing<00:02:33.460> in<00:02:33.850> the<00:02:34.240> USB<00:02:34.750> cable<00:02:34.780> is

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
plug this thing in the USB cable is

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.860 
plug this thing in the USB cable is
plugged<00:02:35.350> into<00:02:35.560> my<00:02:35.740> AC<00:02:36.040> and<00:02:36.490> the<00:02:37.180> LED<00:02:37.510> light

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
plugged into my AC and the LED light

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.280 
plugged into my AC and the LED light
just<00:02:38.200> flashed<00:02:38.530> red<00:02:39.280> green<00:02:39.790> then<00:02:40.120> orange<00:02:40.540> let's

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:41.290 
just flashed red green then orange let's

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.620 
just flashed red green then orange let's
put<00:02:41.530> the<00:02:41.650> s4<00:02:42.010> on<00:02:42.190> there<00:02:42.430> it<00:02:43.030> says<00:02:43.300> wireless

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:43.630 
put the s4 on there it says wireless

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.360 
put the s4 on there it says wireless
charging<00:02:44.170> you<00:02:44.470> have<00:02:44.590> placed<00:02:44.890> the<00:02:45.040> device

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
charging you have placed the device

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.110 
charging you have placed the device
within<00:02:45.640> range<00:02:46.030> now<00:02:46.660> charging<00:02:47.110> wirelessly<00:02:47.590> now

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
within range now charging wirelessly now

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.360 
within range now charging wirelessly now
this<00:02:49.120> is<00:02:49.300> interesting<00:02:49.770> usually<00:02:50.770> on<00:02:50.890> chargers

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
this is interesting usually on chargers

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.580 
this is interesting usually on chargers
green<00:02:51.760> means<00:02:52.000> fully<00:02:52.390> charged<00:02:52.870> red<00:02:53.380> means

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:53.590 
green means fully charged red means

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.010 
green means fully charged red means
charging<00:02:54.190> but<00:02:54.820> for<00:02:55.090> this<00:02:55.240> charger<00:02:55.720> green

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.020 
charging but for this charger green

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:58.199 
charging but for this charger green
means<00:02:56.200> that<00:02:56.590> it<00:02:56.740> sees<00:02:56.950> your<00:02:57.160> Galaxy<00:02:57.580> s4<00:02:57.970> and

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.209 
means that it sees your Galaxy s4 and

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:01.380 
means that it sees your Galaxy s4 and
off<00:02:58.690> means<00:02:59.110> it<00:02:59.380> doesn't<00:02:59.650> see<00:03:00.070> it<00:03:00.280> let's<00:03:01.150> go

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
off means it doesn't see it let's go

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.020 
off means it doesn't see it let's go
through<00:03:01.630> a<00:03:01.690> charging<00:03:02.110> cycle<00:03:02.500> you<00:03:03.490> can<00:03:03.700> see<00:03:03.880> the

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
through a charging cycle you can see the

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:06.240 
through a charging cycle you can see the
battery<00:03:04.360> is<00:03:04.630> at<00:03:04.690> forty-nine<00:03:05.440> percent<00:03:05.709> and<00:03:06.130> the

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
battery is at forty-nine percent and the

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.940 
battery is at forty-nine percent and the
time<00:03:06.490> is<00:03:06.670> exactly<00:03:07.150> ten<00:03:07.510> pm<00:03:07.870> let's<00:03:08.590> see<00:03:08.800> how

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
time is exactly ten pm let's see how

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.720 
time is exactly ten pm let's see how
long<00:03:08.980> it<00:03:09.280> takes<00:03:09.310> to<00:03:09.610> charge<00:03:09.910> to<00:03:10.120> 100<00:03:10.750> percent

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
long it takes to charge to 100 percent

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.790 
long it takes to charge to 100 percent
so<00:03:12.730> it<00:03:12.910> took<00:03:13.090> about<00:03:13.240> two<00:03:13.630> hours<00:03:13.660> and<00:03:14.290> 42

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:14.800 
so it took about two hours and 42

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.620 
so it took about two hours and 42
minutes<00:03:14.830> to<00:03:15.310> get<00:03:15.490> from<00:03:15.550> forty-nine<00:03:16.420> percent

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
minutes to get from forty-nine percent

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.860 
minutes to get from forty-nine percent
to<00:03:16.990> 100%<00:03:17.709> can<00:03:18.640> make<00:03:18.790> the<00:03:18.970> assumption<00:03:19.239> that<00:03:19.630> a

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:19.870 
to 100% can make the assumption that a

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.199 
to 100% can make the assumption that a
full<00:03:20.320> charge<00:03:20.650> from<00:03:21.010> about<00:03:21.370> ten<00:03:21.670> percent<00:03:21.850> to<00:03:22.180> a

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
full charge from about ten percent to a

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:24.240 
full charge from about ten percent to a
hundred<00:03:22.450> percent<00:03:22.750> will<00:03:23.500> take<00:03:23.739> about<00:03:23.860> five

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.250 
hundred percent will take about five

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:27.150 
hundred percent will take about five
hours<00:03:24.570> so<00:03:25.570> that<00:03:25.750> means<00:03:25.989> it<00:03:26.170> charges<00:03:26.620> as<00:03:26.830> fast

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
hours so that means it charges as fast

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:29.790 
hours so that means it charges as fast
or<00:03:27.489> slow<00:03:27.970> as<00:03:28.300> it<00:03:28.630> does<00:03:28.840> when<00:03:29.019> charging<00:03:29.500> over

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:29.800 
or slow as it does when charging over

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.250 
or slow as it does when charging over
the<00:03:29.830> USB<00:03:30.400> on<00:03:30.550> your<00:03:30.700> computer<00:03:31.150> which<00:03:31.360> is<00:03:31.540> not

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
the USB on your computer which is not

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:34.350 
the USB on your computer which is not
bad<00:03:32.290> but<00:03:32.560> it<00:03:32.980> kind<00:03:33.280> of<00:03:33.400> negates<00:03:33.760> some<00:03:34.120> of<00:03:34.239> the

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 
bad but it kind of negates some of the

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.800 
bad but it kind of negates some of the
convenience<00:03:35.940> so<00:03:36.940> let's<00:03:37.180> talk<00:03:37.390> about<00:03:37.450> the

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
convenience so let's talk about the

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.199 
convenience so let's talk about the
thickness<00:03:38.230> of<00:03:38.410> the<00:03:38.590> battery<00:03:38.920> door<00:03:39.160> cover<00:03:39.220> so

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
thickness of the battery door cover so

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:42.030 
thickness of the battery door cover so
right<00:03:40.450> now<00:03:40.480> I<00:03:40.660> have<00:03:40.989> the<00:03:41.110> original<00:03:41.560> cover<00:03:41.800> that

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:42.040 
right now I have the original cover that

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.759 
right now I have the original cover that
came<00:03:42.220> with<00:03:42.400> the<00:03:42.489> galaxy<00:03:42.910> s4<00:03:43.300> and<00:03:43.510> as<00:03:44.410> you<00:03:44.590> can

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:44.769 
came with the galaxy s4 and as you can

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:46.860 
came with the galaxy s4 and as you can
see<00:03:44.800> the<00:03:45.160> rim<00:03:45.340> of<00:03:45.370> the<00:03:45.550> camera<00:03:45.970> lens<00:03:46.239> sticks

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
see the rim of the camera lens sticks

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.890 
see the rim of the camera lens sticks
out<00:03:47.110> above<00:03:47.500> the<00:03:47.560> cover<00:03:47.980> itself<00:03:48.450> now<00:03:49.450> let's<00:03:49.750> put

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
out above the cover itself now let's put

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.020 
out above the cover itself now let's put
on<00:03:50.050> the<00:03:50.080> wireless<00:03:50.470> charging<00:03:51.070> cover<00:03:51.430> on<00:03:51.790> there

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
on the wireless charging cover on there

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:54.479 
on the wireless charging cover on there
and<00:03:52.209> you<00:03:53.170> can<00:03:53.290> see<00:03:53.500> that<00:03:53.530> cover<00:03:54.010> is<00:03:54.250> higher

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
and you can see that cover is higher

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:56.940 
and you can see that cover is higher
than<00:03:54.760> the<00:03:54.910> rim<00:03:55.120> of<00:03:55.150> the<00:03:55.390> camera<00:03:55.750> lens<00:03:55.959> so<00:03:56.680> that

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
than the rim of the camera lens so that

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:59.970 
than the rim of the camera lens so that
is<00:03:57.130> significant<00:03:58.260> let's<00:03:59.260> try<00:03:59.410> to<00:03:59.470> see<00:03:59.800> what

00:03:59.970 --> 00:03:59.980 
is significant let's try to see what

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:01.790 
is significant let's try to see what
happens<00:04:00.310> when<00:04:00.489> we<00:04:00.640> put<00:04:00.850> this<00:04:01.060> into<00:04:01.300> a<00:04:01.420> case

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:01.800 
happens when we put this into a case

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.680 
happens when we put this into a case
this<00:04:02.800> case<00:04:03.130> is<00:04:03.370> one<00:04:03.580> of<00:04:03.700> those<00:04:03.880> wallet<00:04:04.420> cases

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
this case is one of those wallet cases

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:06.990 
this case is one of those wallet cases
with<00:04:05.320> the<00:04:05.440> latch<00:04:05.680> that<00:04:06.070> surrounds<00:04:06.640> a<00:04:06.730> rubber

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
with the latch that surrounds a rubber

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.320 
with the latch that surrounds a rubber
case<00:04:07.360> and<00:04:07.890> yeah<00:04:08.890> it<00:04:09.130> definitely<00:04:09.400> is<00:04:09.850> too<00:04:10.090> big

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:10.330 
case and yeah it definitely is too big

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:14.100 
case and yeah it definitely is too big
for<00:04:10.600> it<00:04:10.630> but<00:04:11.410> it<00:04:11.709> mostly<00:04:12.280> fits<00:04:12.760> and<00:04:13.030> I<00:04:13.570> think<00:04:13.959> in

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:14.110 
for it but it mostly fits and I think in

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:16.710 
for it but it mostly fits and I think in
a<00:04:14.200> day<00:04:14.470> you<00:04:15.130> may<00:04:15.430> or<00:04:15.670> may<00:04:15.880> not<00:04:15.910> settle<00:04:16.570> in

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
a day you may or may not settle in

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.449 
a day you may or may not settle in
because<00:04:16.930> the<00:04:17.260> rubber<00:04:17.500> does<00:04:17.830> stretch<00:04:18.220> out<00:04:18.430> a

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
because the rubber does stretch out a

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:20.580 
because the rubber does stretch out a
little<00:04:18.609> bit<00:04:19.000> but<00:04:19.780> if<00:04:19.930> you<00:04:20.080> have<00:04:20.229> a<00:04:20.260> hard

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
little bit but if you have a hard

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.190 
little bit but if you have a hard
plastic<00:04:20.830> case<00:04:21.100> that<00:04:21.549> is<00:04:21.700> tight<00:04:21.970> fitting<00:04:22.390> this

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200 
plastic case that is tight fitting this

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.490 
plastic case that is tight fitting this
is<00:04:23.410> definitely<00:04:24.010> not<00:04:24.039> going<00:04:24.610> to<00:04:24.789> work<00:04:25.500> so

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
is definitely not going to work so

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.050 
is definitely not going to work so
anyway<00:04:26.860> that's<00:04:27.039> my<00:04:27.190> unboxing

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.060 
anyway that's my unboxing

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:30.360 
anyway that's my unboxing
review<00:04:28.480> of<00:04:28.570> the<00:04:28.660> case<00:04:28.870> it<00:04:29.169> is<00:04:29.650> cool<00:04:30.070> and

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
review of the case it is cool and

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:33.120 
review of the case it is cool and
convenient<00:04:31.120> a<00:04:31.300> little<00:04:32.050> bit<00:04:32.230> slow<00:04:32.530> to<00:04:32.590> charge

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
convenient a little bit slow to charge

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.370 
convenient a little bit slow to charge
but<00:04:33.760> definitely<00:04:34.360> not<00:04:34.510> for<00:04:34.750> everyone<00:04:34.810> because

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 
but definitely not for everyone because

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.409 
but definitely not for everyone because
of<00:04:35.680> the<00:04:35.800> steep<00:04:36.070> price<00:04:36.400> and<00:04:36.700> the<00:04:36.910> addition<00:04:37.389> of

00:04:37.409 --> 00:04:37.419 
of the steep price and the addition of

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:39.390 
of the steep price and the addition of
thickness<00:04:38.110> that<00:04:38.290> makes<00:04:38.590> it<00:04:38.770> incompatible

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:39.400 
thickness that makes it incompatible

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:42.540 
thickness that makes it incompatible
with<00:04:39.970> most<00:04:40.270> cases<00:04:40.630> out<00:04:41.020> there<00:04:41.100> so<00:04:42.100> I<00:04:42.130> hope<00:04:42.370> you

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:42.550 
with most cases out there so I hope you

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.700 
with most cases out there so I hope you
