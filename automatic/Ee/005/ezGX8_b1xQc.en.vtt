second<00:00:36.510> turn<00:00:36.660> which<00:00:37.050> tells<00:00:37.440> me<00:00:37.620> that<00:00:37.879> this<00:00:38.879> is

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
second turn which tells me that this is

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.170 
second turn which tells me that this is
a<00:00:39.329> speed<00:00:39.989> high<00:00:40.200> which<00:00:40.710> I<00:00:40.950> did<00:00:41.309> not<00:00:41.460> know<00:00:41.760> at<00:00:42.059> the

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
a speed high which I did not know at the

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.049 
a speed high which I did not know at the
time<00:00:42.329> so<00:00:42.780> I<00:00:43.050> was<00:00:43.320> like<00:00:43.379> okay<00:00:43.950> these<00:00:44.579> guys<00:00:44.640> got

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
time so I was like okay these guys got

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.440 
time so I was like okay these guys got
like<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.329> same<00:00:45.809> speed<00:00:46.140> which<00:00:46.350> is<00:00:46.379> okay<00:00:47.039> cool

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:47.450 
like the same speed which is okay cool

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.979 
like the same speed which is okay cool
but<00:00:48.500> he<00:00:49.500> does<00:00:49.680> win<00:00:50.010> another<00:00:50.670> speed<00:00:51.059> tie<00:00:51.300> which

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
but he does win another speed tie which

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.779 
but he does win another speed tie which
really<00:00:52.559> sucks<00:00:52.890> because<00:00:53.070> I<00:00:53.280> could<00:00:53.579> have<00:00:53.670> taken

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
really sucks because I could have taken

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.729 
really sucks because I could have taken
out<00:00:54.030> with<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.270> hand<00:00:54.420> colorized<00:00:54.750> then<00:00:55.440> again<00:00:55.710> I

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
out with the hand colorized then again I

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.229 
out with the hand colorized then again I
probably<00:00:56.010> would<00:00:56.250> have<00:00:56.309> died<00:00:56.489> by<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.699> bird<00:00:56.940> so

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
probably would have died by the bird so

know he's got multi skills I wasn't

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.840 
know he's got multi skills I wasn't
expecting<00:01:52.320> it<00:01:52.439> to<00:01:52.530> take<00:01:52.680> it<00:01:52.799> out<00:01:52.920> one<00:01:53.250> hit<00:01:53.490> so

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
expecting it to take it out one hit so

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.959 
expecting it to take it out one hit so
it's<00:01:53.880> like<00:01:54.360> whatever<00:01:55.460> he<00:01:56.460> doesn't<00:01:56.759> take<00:01:56.850> me

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969

just gonna ice punch it and he goes for
roost<00:03:30.680> really<00:03:31.680> doesn't<00:03:32.040> matter<00:03:32.220> now<00:03:32.459> because

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
roost really doesn't matter now because

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:35.300 
roost really doesn't matter now because
you<00:03:33.209> know<00:03:33.360> he<00:03:33.930> can't<00:03:34.170> really<00:03:34.350> restore<00:03:35.070> me

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
you know he can't really restore me

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:36.800 
you know he can't really restore me
because<00:03:35.730> I<00:03:35.910> could<00:03:36.090> just<00:03:36.269> keep<00:03:36.390> on<00:03:36.540> ice

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
because I could just keep on ice

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.199 
because I could just keep on ice
punching<00:03:37.380> at<00:03:37.590> layer<00:03:37.980> and<00:03:38.310> probably<00:03:39.000> if<00:03:39.090> he

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
punching at layer and probably if he

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:40.130 
punching at layer and probably if he
keeps<00:03:39.420> on<00:03:39.540> doing<00:03:39.600> this

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
keeps on doing this

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:42.800 
keeps on doing this
I<00:03:40.170> mean<00:03:40.680> I'm<00:03:40.920> either<00:03:41.340> gonna<00:03:41.579> get<00:03:41.790> a<00:03:41.850> freeze<00:03:42.360> or

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
I mean I'm either gonna get a freeze or

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.890 
I mean I'm either gonna get a freeze or
a<00:03:43.440> critical<00:03:44.130> hit<00:03:44.370> which<00:03:45.090> will<00:03:45.450> take<00:03:45.630> him<00:03:45.780> out
