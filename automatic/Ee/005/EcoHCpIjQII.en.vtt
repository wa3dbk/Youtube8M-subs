00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
Tower here's a look at the other side

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.660 
Tower here's a look at the other side
and<00:03:21.780> it<00:03:21.930> has<00:03:22.080> the<00:03:22.350> colors<00:03:22.709> of<00:03:22.739> grace<00:03:23.220> as<00:03:23.459> well

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.910 
and it has the colors of grace as well
and<00:03:23.970> so<00:03:24.570> this<00:03:24.780> is<00:03:24.989> the<00:03:25.140> same<00:03:25.350> thing<00:03:25.650> and<00:03:25.800> then<00:03:25.890> I

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
and so this is the same thing and then I

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.979 
and so this is the same thing and then I
had<00:03:26.040> just<00:03:26.100> a<00:03:26.340> little<00:03:26.370> like<00:03:26.730> doily<00:03:27.540> to<00:03:27.750> me<00:03:27.870> it

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
had just a little like doily to me it

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:29.330 
had just a little like doily to me it
looks<00:03:28.140> like<00:03:28.230> and<00:03:28.500> you<00:03:28.590> can<00:03:28.739> put<00:03:28.980> the<00:03:29.100> sticker

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
looks like and you can put the sticker

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.190 
looks like and you can put the sticker
of<00:03:29.580> your<00:03:29.730> initial<00:03:30.000> in<00:03:30.330> there<00:03:30.570> obviously<00:03:31.170> I

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:31.200 
of your initial in there obviously I

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.990 
of your initial in there obviously I
would<00:03:31.530> put<00:03:31.650> a<00:03:31.680> D<00:03:31.920> or<00:03:32.190> you<00:03:32.580> do<00:03:32.700> whatever<00:03:32.850> you

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:33.000 
would put a D or you do whatever you

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.060 
would put a D or you do whatever you
like<00:03:33.090> and<00:03:33.480> then<00:03:33.720> I<00:03:33.989> guess<00:03:34.320> what<00:03:34.530> the<00:03:34.680> idea<00:03:34.980> is

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
like and then I guess what the idea is

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:36.470 
like and then I guess what the idea is
here<00:03:35.340> is<00:03:35.430> that<00:03:35.519> you<00:03:35.700> can<00:03:35.880> choose<00:03:36.090> which<00:03:36.450> side

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
here is that you can choose which side

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.229 
here is that you can choose which side
you<00:03:36.900> want<00:03:37.019> if<00:03:37.200> you<00:03:37.320> want<00:03:37.500> this<00:03:37.769> side<00:03:38.100> or<00:03:38.430> if<00:03:39.060> you

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
you want if you want this side or if you

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:40.729 
you want if you want this side or if you
would<00:03:39.330> like<00:03:39.390> this<00:03:39.720> side<00:03:39.959> here<00:03:40.380> with<00:03:40.590> the

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
would like this side here with the

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:42.650 
would like this side here with the
Eiffel<00:03:41.040> Tower<00:03:41.070> on<00:03:41.550> it<00:03:41.730> that<00:03:42.060> also<00:03:42.330> comes<00:03:42.450> as<00:03:42.600> a

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660

with<00:04:05.430> a<00:04:05.610> plastic<00:04:05.850> covering<00:04:06.600> as<00:04:06.720> you<00:04:06.900> see<00:04:07.080> here

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
with a plastic covering as you see here

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:08.810 
with a plastic covering as you see here

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
and dry I guess so it doesn't rip in

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.710 
and dry I guess so it doesn't rip in
terror<00:04:13.799> so<00:04:13.980> that's<00:04:14.130> really<00:04:14.820> cool<00:04:15.239> it's<00:04:15.450> really
