00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:04.830
 very well so this movie is called 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.260
 the amazing spiderman but the truth 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.850
 there is nothing amazing about this 

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:10.140
 movie or do not get me wrong 

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:11.309
 living from the movie on site 

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:13.470
 talking about things that Spain does not 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.240
 can do or if it is balanced I will 

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:17.550
 take part in these kinds of things but 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.619
 there is nothing surprising that are things 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.090
 we had seen but but what did 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.010
 it's amazing that Peter Parker in a 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.630
 poster of the indiscreet truth in his 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:29.230
 quarter 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:31.529
 that's amazing now let's talk about the 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:31.529
 movie 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.510
 the amazing spiderman 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.190
 I would like to have this doubt how we carry 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.830
 this character in the speaking countries 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.900
 Hispanic we wear it spider-man man 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:48.740
 spider and I always say spider-man but 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:50.120
 always the title is spiderman I do not know 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:54.530
 I personally tell you it 's for the man 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:58.980
 but also the title is spiderman 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:00.239
 we'll take it is palma espai so I've 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.220
 seen many critics next to this 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:06.000
 movie because they say it's the same in the 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:08.310
 first how this movie is so bad 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.710
 because it's like like the first 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.710
 the one in the document so it's like the 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.260
 same story and that's why I do not like it 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.660
 it is bad or not what in my opinion is 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.700
 completely unfair to this movie not 

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:22.770
 has no relation to the first 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.330
 movie except for the fact that 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.830
 tells the same story and in that they have 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.700
 reason and although the trailers we 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:31.350
 they promised the untold story 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.930
 begins the story of the origin of this 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.820
 brotherhood there is nothing untold in 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.490
 that of course you can change some things 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.649
 as the villain the love interest of 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.259
 peter parker but the history of origin 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:44.610
 it's for brother there's nothing new in that 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.350
 but to say that this movie is bad 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.119
 only based on the fact that it is 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.399
 predictable because he is a starter and he was 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.229
 told by sam reimi is completely 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.910
 unfair in my opinion is not for nothing 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.880
 blame for this movie the fact that 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.890
 has already been told before 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.689
 now this pelvis directed by marc webb 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.450
 director of only one movie in the 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:03.710
 past that is 500 days with her that yes 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.659
 they can get anywhere 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.950
 see is a very good movie the 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:09.019
 I recommend a lot is one of my movies 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:10.910
 I recommend them a lot of favorites 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:11.989
 now the story of this movie does not 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.239
 I want to go into detail with what is 

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:16.160
 the story of this movie because it's 

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:18.440
 the origin of as peter parkes 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.360
 Transforms into sperm all how we are 

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.269
 history so not worth going 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.440
 in details but what they do see is that the 

00:02:23.269 --> 00:02:25.940
 story and the problem of the movie 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.530
 they are quite slow and I would say by the 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.150
 first hour of the movie that is 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.790
 when Peter because he has no powers 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.349
 we are going to know their environment we are going 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.780
 knowing then kind of things is 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:39.019
 quite slow and not very exciting and 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.220
 even a little bored until I eat 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:42.019
 we all know Peter so he does not 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.000
 bites a spider and is when the movie 

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:46.099
 it gets very very interesting and 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.280
 entertaining in fact quite and we have 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:51.140
 typical also walking the walls 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.870
 swinging around the city in 3d that's 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.790
 fact it looks very very cool if you guys from 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:57.500
 was done for something it was to see is 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.980
 pay me swinging around the city 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.230
 who is 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.720
 tion in this film is very great if 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.810
 you can see it in 3d look in 3d I recommend 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.220
 a lot and 3d very good 3d now the 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.569
 acting as soon as they did that 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:13.110
 instead of saying the new peter parker 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:15.660
 I said sb he could be the perfect peter 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:19.120
 parker something that is taking 4 the previous 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:21.860
 Peter Parker said so who says it 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.960
 and I think he was right 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.240
 instead flash a great job as 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:28.490
 Peter Parker would even say that better than 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:31.010
 take maguire did in the previous well 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:32.720
 what a great job we also have the 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.310
 cane as gwen stacy new interest 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.430
 amorous of pee tatuar care that is not 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.750
 not difficult to look at 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.520
 no way 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.860
 and you already have the irvi as the doctor 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.360
 connors or the lizard the villain in this 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.850
 movie I've heard a lot of 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:49.640
 people say he was not such a good villain 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:53.030
 but my opinion was fine it's fine 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:54.680
 that now the inevitable comparison is 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:58.340
 this movie better than the first 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.780
 spider-man in my opinion yes yes it is not 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.280
 only in terms of how the 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.650
 history because already the 2000 version 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:07.100
 I still feel a little outdated a 

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.870
 little bit strange in some parts it feels 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:11.090
 outdated this version feels 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.890
 much more 2012 feels much more 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:14.390
 current but also to the tone of the 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:16.850
 movie that feels much darker 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:18.980
 a little more serious that I do not say that it 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:21.320
 it feels good for all the movies not 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:22.970
 always serious and dark means better 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.740
 but still I think it works for this 

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:26.510
 movie although now I do think that the 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:28.490
 vision is android and has a lot of moments 

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.680
 more memorable than it has for 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:32.840
 example the kiss between mary jane and spy 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:34.520
 wrong in the first movie the series of 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.110
 Today everyone remembers you already know when 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:40.640
 Sperm is upside down 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:42.890
 today I remember everything the weight 

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:46.340
 that this movie I do not think anyone else 

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:47.990
 Remember the truth not like 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:50.810
 many other moments that I do not want to give 

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:52.400
 to know because they could make known 

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:54.830
 some details that would be achieved 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:56.300
 spoilers for this movie but the 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.950
 history of origins remains that they are 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.450
 moments that have to happen but from 

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:01.160
 I do not want to make them known anyway 

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:02.420
 commented that mine did not feel 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:05.270
 much more emotions in the first 

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:06.500
 movie that in this although I think that a 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.000
 the best they have done it on purpose 

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:09.680
 because if not everyone would be even 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.450
 many more years always comparing the 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.460
 moment x of the first movie moment 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:14.960
 x from this movie so the best thing that 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.370
 they moved away and certain aspects that 

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:19.760
 they were iconic in the first movie 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:22.670
 to separate a little more from this one do not 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:25.610
 I know maybe never end about things 

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:26.930
 such if we will not know it now with a 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:29.009
 director as marc webb I was expecting a 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:30.629
 direction a little more 

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:31.680
 especially considering its previous 

00:05:30.629 --> 00:05:34.499
 movie has a pretty movie 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:35.279
 indie pretty independent and pretty 

00:05:34.499 --> 00:05:36.599
 special 

00:05:35.279 --> 00:05:38.279
 I thought it would take routes to maybe a 

00:05:36.599 --> 00:05:39.749
 little more similar to that with this 

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:41.819
 movie ocean's man but something 

00:05:39.749 --> 00:05:43.619
 extravagant first fixed a little more 

00:05:41.819 --> 00:05:45.419
 risky but I must say that by day 

00:05:43.619 --> 00:05:50.080
 my instagram had a more secure route 

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:52.180
 more making we could say nothing 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:55.060
 has arrived is the word did not take the route 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:57.700
 left took the safest route and 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:58.840
 to the best easy I think that risk 

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:02.680
 I would have taken this movie on 

00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:05.320
 next level but not so not but 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:08.620
 we do not know maybe in the sequel 

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:10.000
 or if I want, I really want to 

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:11.050
 see why when all the 

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.390
 characters are left in a position 

00:06:11.050 --> 00:06:15.520
 quite interesting for the sequel 

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:17.890
 I will not reveal anything but and relationships 

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:19.720
 that were formed very interesting to see 

00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:22.150
 how it develops in the next 

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:26.230
 movie so I really liked that 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:28.840
 amazing spiderman and I will give you a the 

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:30.790
 Buying in blu-ray barely comes out but 

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:33.070
 the wing is annoying favorite movie 

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:36.370
 from spider-man I am among this story 

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:39.880
 I'm still not very sure 

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:42.400
 so comment below 

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:44.320
 I'll see that next week when 

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:48.120
 have the criticism of brave 

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:48.120
 that would be interesting and cut black
