thing<00:00:46.559> you're<00:00:46.680> going<00:00:46.770> to<00:00:46.860> do<00:00:46.980> is<00:00:47.160> just<00:00:47.579> unscrew

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
thing you're going to do is just unscrew

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.680 
thing you're going to do is just unscrew
the<00:00:48.059> radio<00:00:48.680> four<00:00:49.680> screws<00:00:50.120> on<00:00:51.120> each<00:00:51.390> side<00:00:51.660> just

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
the radio four screws on each side just

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:58.430 
the radio four screws on each side just
use<00:00:52.050> a<00:00:52.199> socket<00:00:56.780> this<00:00:57.780> is<00:00:57.960> something<00:00:58.199> anybody

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
use a socket this is something anybody

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.049 
use a socket this is something anybody
can<00:00:58.770> do<00:00:59.570> with<00:01:00.570> a<00:01:00.600> couple<00:01:00.989> hand<00:01:01.199> tools

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
can do with a couple hand tools

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:06.800 
can do with a couple hand tools
it<00:01:03.059> is<00:01:03.270> truly<00:01:03.710> eight<00:01:04.710> ten<00:01:05.460> minute<00:01:05.790> radio<00:01:06.330> swap

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
it is truly eight ten minute radio swap

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.210 
it is truly eight ten minute radio swap
and<00:01:08.210> that's<00:01:09.210> because<00:01:09.659> these<00:01:10.650> radios<00:01:11.070> are

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
and that's because these radios are

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.750 
and that's because these radios are
designed<00:01:11.610> and<00:01:12.510> exact<00:01:12.930> match<00:01:13.290> for<00:01:13.590> the<00:01:14.369> factory

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
designed and exact match for the factory

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.390 
designed and exact match for the factory

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
harness what we're going to do with an

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.170 
harness what we're going to do with an
adapter<00:01:58.259> for<00:01:59.420> the<00:02:00.560> radio<00:02:01.560> antenna<00:02:01.969> we<00:02:02.969> just

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
adapter for the radio antenna we just

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.749 
adapter for the radio antenna we just
simply<00:02:03.450> plug<00:02:03.659> in<00:02:05.090> that<00:02:06.090> gives<00:02:06.299> us<00:02:06.360> our<00:02:06.479> intent

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:07.759 
simply plug in that gives us our intent

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:11.520 
simply plug in that gives us our intent
for<00:02:08.759> the<00:02:09.349> watery

for the watery

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.580 
for the watery
we've<00:02:12.530> gotten<00:02:12.950> a<00:02:13.040> separate<00:02:13.430> harness<00:02:14.380> it<00:02:15.380> looks

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
we've gotten a separate harness it looks

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.160 
we've gotten a separate harness it looks
like<00:02:15.770> this<00:02:15.950> you'll<00:02:16.370> notice<00:02:16.550> the<00:02:16.880> harness<00:02:17.210> fits

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
like this you'll notice the harness fits

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.370 
like this you'll notice the harness fits
directly<00:02:18.380> into<00:02:18.740> the<00:02:18.830> factory<00:02:19.160> harness<00:02:20.380> plug

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:21.380 
directly into the factory harness plug

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.750 
directly into the factory harness plug
it<00:02:21.470> in<00:02:21.620> clamp<00:02:22.550> it<00:02:22.700> down<00:02:22.730> and<00:02:23.120> it's<00:02:23.360> solid<00:02:24.760> from

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
it in clamp it down and it's solid from

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.490 
it in clamp it down and it's solid from
this<00:02:25.970> we've<00:02:26.510> got<00:02:26.600> a<00:02:26.630> couple<00:02:26.870> wires<00:02:27.110> to<00:02:27.320> plug

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
this we've got a couple wires to plug

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.730 
this we've got a couple wires to plug
into<00:02:27.650> the<00:02:27.740> radio<00:02:28.040> and<00:02:28.250> we're<00:02:28.370> done

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
into the radio and we're done

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.470 
into the radio and we're done
first<00:02:30.740> thing<00:02:31.010> we're<00:02:31.160> to<00:02:31.220> plug<00:02:31.400> in<00:02:31.580> is<00:02:31.760> the<00:02:32.240> main

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:32.480 
first thing we're to plug in is the main

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:38.710 
first thing we're to plug in is the main
power<00:02:35.620> you'll<00:02:36.620> hear<00:02:36.800> it<00:02:36.890> beep<00:02:37.540> second<00:02:38.540> thing

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
power you'll hear it beep second thing

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:42.180 
power you'll hear it beep second thing
we're<00:02:39.020> going<00:02:39.110> to<00:02:39.170> plug<00:02:39.350> in<00:02:39.410> is<00:02:39.740> the<00:02:40.610> power<00:02:40.850> on

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:42.190 
we're going to plug in is the power on

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:48.070 
we're going to plug in is the power on
and<00:02:43.209> the<00:02:44.209> third<00:02:44.450> is<00:02:44.950> this<00:02:45.950> lead<00:02:46.780> plugs<00:02:47.780> right

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:48.080 
and the third is this lead plugs right

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.610 
and the third is this lead plugs right
in<00:02:49.150> and<00:02:50.150> I<00:02:50.330> say<00:02:50.540> these<00:02:50.720> are<00:02:50.870> matched<00:02:51.080> so<00:02:51.440> that

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
in and I say these are matched so that

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.740 
in and I say these are matched so that
pulling<00:02:51.800> the<00:02:51.980> right<00:02:52.100> one<00:02:52.220> will<00:02:52.340> plug<00:02:52.520> in<00:02:52.750> and

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
pulling the right one will plug in and

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.080 
pulling the right one will plug in and

that's<00:03:59.480> always<00:03:59.600> a<00:03:59.690> good<00:03:59.780> idea<00:03:59.840> to<00:04:00.049> test<00:04:00.260> it

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:00.440 
that's always a good idea to test it

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.770 
that's always a good idea to test it
before<00:04:00.530> you<00:04:00.680> get<00:04:00.829> it<00:04:00.890> all<00:04:00.980> put<00:04:01.160> back<00:04:01.190> together
