00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:39.630 
you do need stone slabs or you could

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:41.380 
you do need stone slabs or you could
just<00:00:39.660> use<00:00:39.870> wooden<00:00:40.200> slabs<00:00:40.530> to<00:00:40.830> cover<00:00:41.040> up<00:00:41.160> that

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:41.390 
just use wooden slabs to cover up that

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:47.870 
just use wooden slabs to cover up that
okay<00:00:43.910> so<00:00:44.910> here<00:00:45.300> we<00:00:45.360> go<00:00:46.310> first<00:00:47.310> of<00:00:47.520> all<00:00:47.610> you're

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:47.880 
okay so here we go first of all you're

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.210 
okay so here we go first of all you're
going<00:00:48.060> to<00:00:48.180> want<00:00:48.270> to<00:00:48.450> dig<00:00:48.780> out<00:00:48.960> like<00:00:49.710> this<00:00:50.040> so

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:50.220 
going to want to dig out like this so

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.580 
going to want to dig out like this so
one<00:00:50.400> two<00:00:50.520> three<00:00:50.550> four<00:00:51.030> so<00:00:51.630> literally<00:00:52.230> make

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
one two three four so literally make

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.040 
one two three four so literally make
sure<00:00:52.740> you<00:00:52.890> have<00:00:53.040> a<00:00:53.070> space<00:00:53.400> of<00:00:53.670> ten<00:00:54.000> so<00:00:54.750> you<00:00:54.810> can

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
sure you have a space of ten so you can

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:04.840 
sure you have a space of ten so you can
just<00:00:55.200> do<00:00:55.410> here<00:00:55.710> once<00:00:59.000> I've<00:01:00.000> done<00:01:00.180> that<00:01:00.240> eight

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:10.789 

so<00:01:05.850> as<00:01:06.299> I'm<00:01:06.540> digging<00:01:07.100> I<00:01:08.359> didn't<00:01:09.359> I<00:01:09.649> didn't<00:01:10.649> come

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
so as I'm digging I didn't I didn't come

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.469 
so as I'm digging I didn't I didn't come
up<00:01:10.829> with<00:01:11.039> this<00:01:11.159> idea<00:01:11.340> I<00:01:11.549> saw<00:01:11.850> it<00:01:12.030> but<00:01:12.179> then<00:01:12.359> I

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
up with this idea I saw it but then I

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:17.169 
up with this idea I saw it but then I
adapted<00:01:12.990> it<00:01:13.170> so<00:01:13.380> I<00:01:13.499> guess<00:01:13.710> it<00:01:13.859> is<00:01:14.060> half<00:01:15.060> my<00:01:15.420> idea

00:01:17.169 --> 00:01:17.179 
adapted it so I guess it is half my idea

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:22.099 
adapted it so I guess it is half my idea
it's<00:01:18.179> very<00:01:18.479> simple<00:01:19.159> to<00:01:20.159> make<00:01:20.189> as<00:01:20.609> well<00:01:21.109> once

00:01:22.099 --> 00:01:22.109 
it's very simple to make as well once

00:01:22.109 --> 00:01:26.809 
it's very simple to make as well once
you<00:01:22.259> figure<00:01:22.530> out<00:01:22.560> this<00:01:22.770> hull<00:01:23.039> okay<00:01:24.889> so<00:01:25.889> now

00:01:26.809 --> 00:01:26.819 
you figure out this hull okay so now

00:01:26.819 --> 00:01:28.969 
you figure out this hull okay so now
that<00:01:26.850> we've<00:01:27.240> dug<00:01:27.420> out<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.719> hole<00:01:27.929> what<00:01:28.829> you

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
that we've dug out the hole what you

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.480 
that we've dug out the hole what you
want<00:01:29.159> to<00:01:29.280> do<00:01:29.460> you<00:01:29.939> want<00:01:30.149> to<00:01:30.299> place<00:01:31.159> all<00:01:32.159> the

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
want to do you want to place all the

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.330 
want to do you want to place all the
sticky<00:01:32.729> pistons<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.450> cover<00:01:33.749> up<00:01:33.899> this<00:01:34.020> row<00:01:35.659> here

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
sticky pistons to cover up this row here

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:43.819 
sticky pistons to cover up this row here
so<00:01:38.340> one<00:01:38.609> space<00:01:38.969> from<00:01:39.389> the<00:01:39.689> row<00:01:39.929> of<00:01:40.350> dirt<00:01:42.829> like

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
so one space from the row of dirt like

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:50.149 
so one space from the row of dirt like
this<00:01:44.189> and<00:01:45.829> then<00:01:46.829> put<00:01:47.789> some<00:01:48.209> repeaters<00:01:49.159> you

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
this and then put some repeaters you

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.349 
this and then put some repeaters you
just<00:01:50.549> grab<00:01:50.969> quickly<00:01:52.069> there<00:01:53.069> grab<00:01:53.850> some<00:01:54.240> more

to carry it on around here but it's

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:46.120 
to carry it on around here but it's
gonna<00:02:41.760> be<00:02:41.850> one<00:02:42.180> bit<00:02:42.450> lower<00:02:43.010> so<00:02:44.010> there<00:02:44.370> we<00:02:44.460> go

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
gonna be one bit lower so there we go

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:52.880 
gonna be one bit lower so there we go
down<00:02:47.130> one<00:02:47.610> more<00:02:47.990> like<00:02:48.990> this<00:02:51.560> yes<00:02:52.560> they've<00:02:52.860> done

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
down one more like this yes they've done

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.750 
down one more like this yes they've done
that<00:02:53.540> it<00:02:54.540> should<00:02:54.990> basically<00:02:55.470> just<00:02:56.040> look<00:02:56.340> if<00:02:56.610> I

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
that it should basically just look if I

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.250 
that it should basically just look if I
can<00:02:56.910> just<00:02:57.060> destroy<00:02:57.450> these<00:02:57.690> two<00:02:57.870> bits

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
can just destroy these two bits

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.770 
can just destroy these two bits
so<00:02:59.130> it<00:02:59.310> should<00:02:59.520> just<00:02:59.640> look<00:02:59.970> like<00:03:00.150> this<00:03:00.330> quickly

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
so it should just look like this quickly

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.900 
so it should just look like this quickly
you<00:03:01.500> want<00:03:01.620> to<00:03:01.740> place<00:03:02.010> the<00:03:02.190> redstone<00:03:02.580> covering

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
you want to place the redstone covering

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:07.820 
you want to place the redstone covering
all<00:03:03.150> the<00:03:03.270> way<00:03:03.360> down<00:03:04.010> and<00:03:05.010> around<00:03:06.380> until<00:03:07.380> you

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
all the way down and around until you

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.180 
all the way down and around until you
get<00:03:07.980> to<00:03:08.390> there<00:03:09.390> and<00:03:10.080> place<00:03:10.650> you<00:03:10.860> will<00:03:10.980> leave

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
get to there and place you will leave

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.540 
get to there and place you will leave
here<00:03:12.320> this<00:03:13.320> should<00:03:13.470> activate<00:03:13.860> all<00:03:14.040> the<00:03:14.070> sticky

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
here this should activate all the sticky

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:17.720 
here this should activate all the sticky
pistons<00:03:14.970> and<00:03:15.180> then<00:03:15.750> pull<00:03:16.020> them<00:03:16.230> like<00:03:16.470> that<00:03:16.740> so

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
pistons and then pull them like that so

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.970 
pistons and then pull them like that so
now<00:03:17.850> that<00:03:17.910> they<00:03:18.180> have<00:03:18.570> been<00:03:19.350> pulled

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:19.980 
now that they have been pulled

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.920 
now that they have been pulled
it<00:03:20.880> will<00:03:21.360> open<00:03:21.660> like<00:03:22.560> that<00:03:22.880> so<00:03:23.880> now<00:03:24.570> you're

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
it will open like that so now you're

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.440 
it will open like that so now you're
going<00:03:25.140> to<00:03:25.350> want<00:03:25.530> to<00:03:25.940> literally<00:03:26.940> grab<00:03:27.180> the

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
going to want to literally grab the

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.690 
going to want to literally grab the
stone<00:03:27.660> slabs<00:03:28.050> and<00:03:29.630> just<00:03:30.630> cover<00:03:30.900> it<00:03:31.020> up<00:03:31.200> really

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:31.700 
stone slabs and just cover it up really

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.199 
stone slabs and just cover it up really
because<00:03:32.700> of<00:03:32.730> course<00:03:33.150> half<00:03:33.900> a<00:03:34.380> block<00:03:35.280> or<00:03:35.670> slabs

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:36.209 
because of course half a block or slabs

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:41.210 
because of course half a block or slabs
that<00:03:37.020> doesn't<00:03:37.350> stop<00:03:37.650> redstone<00:03:38.900> from<00:03:40.220> like

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
that doesn't stop redstone from like

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.590 
that doesn't stop redstone from like
working<00:03:41.820> around<00:03:42.000> two<00:03:42.990> different<00:03:43.530> arts<00:03:44.130> and

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
working around two different arts and

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.650 
working around two different arts and
activating<00:03:46.040> stuff<00:03:47.040> like<00:03:47.250> Pistons<00:03:47.760> so<00:03:48.420> here

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
activating stuff like Pistons so here

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.690 
activating stuff like Pistons so here
though<00:03:48.840> one<00:03:49.020> should<00:03:49.050> just<00:03:49.380> covered<00:03:49.739> this<00:03:50.040> to

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:50.700 
though one should just covered this to

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:52.880 
though one should just covered this to
make<00:03:50.850> it<00:03:51.030> not<00:03:51.209> obvious<00:03:51.420> to<00:03:52.200> like<00:03:52.410> not<00:03:52.680> make

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
make it not obvious to like not make

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:57.470 
make it not obvious to like not make
obvious<00:03:53.370> that<00:03:54.000> there's<00:03:54.690> of<00:03:55.320> course<00:03:55.500> a<00:03:56.480> my

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
obvious that there's of course a my

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.710 
obvious that there's of course a my
massive<00:03:58.440> load<00:03:58.739> of<00:03:58.920> pistons<00:03:59.459> and<00:03:59.910> other<00:04:00.360> stuff

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:00.720 
massive load of pistons and other stuff

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.440 
massive load of pistons and other stuff
the<00:04:01.709> redstone<00:04:02.190> on<00:04:02.370> here<00:04:02.610> so<00:04:02.820> no<00:04:02.940> one<00:04:02.970> can<00:04:03.209> Nick

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
the redstone on here so no one can Nick

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:06.350 
the redstone on here so no one can Nick
it<00:04:03.630> or<00:04:03.930> find<00:04:04.350> out<00:04:04.850> you're<00:04:05.850> going<00:04:05.970> to<00:04:06.060> make<00:04:06.209> this

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
it or find out you're going to make this

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:09.500 
it or find out you're going to make this
look<00:04:06.570> like<00:04:06.630> a<00:04:06.840> pathway<00:04:07.230> so<00:04:08.209> and<00:04:09.209> as<00:04:09.300> you<00:04:09.390> can

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:09.510 
look like a pathway so and as you can

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:14.420 
look like a pathway so and as you can
see<00:04:10.459> it<00:04:11.459> just<00:04:11.489> looks<00:04:12.390> like<00:04:13.160> basically<00:04:14.160> it's<00:04:14.310> a

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
see it just looks like basically it's a

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.320 
see it just looks like basically it's a
load<00:04:14.730> of<00:04:14.910> random<00:04:15.570> stone<00:04:16.290> slab<00:04:16.680> so<00:04:17.609> well<00:04:18.239> you

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:18.330 
load of random stone slab so well you

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:20.630 
load of random stone slab so well you
don't<00:04:18.480> know<00:04:18.600> what<00:04:18.780> to<00:04:18.959> do<00:04:19.140> is<00:04:19.530> Oh<00:04:19.859> just

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:20.640 
don't know what to do is Oh just

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.420 
don't know what to do is Oh just
demonstrate<00:04:21.120> it<00:04:21.239> on<00:04:21.270> one<00:04:21.480> side<00:04:21.690> is<00:04:22.430> you're

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
demonstrate it on one side is you're

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.620 
demonstrate it on one side is you're
just<00:04:23.610> going<00:04:23.820> to<00:04:23.880> want<00:04:24.120> to<00:04:25.729> change<00:04:26.729> these<00:04:27.330> two

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
just going to want to change these two

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:30.520 
just going to want to change these two
bits<00:04:27.840> even<00:04:28.800> just<00:04:29.760> stone<00:04:29.970> slab

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
bits even just stone slab

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:34.330 
bits even just stone slab
like<00:04:31.520> this<00:04:31.820> and<00:04:32.170> then<00:04:33.170> you<00:04:33.350> cover<00:04:33.650> up<00:04:33.920> this

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
like this and then you cover up this

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:40.540 
like this and then you cover up this
side<00:04:35.030> again<00:04:35.920> but<00:04:36.920> then<00:04:38.650> so<00:04:39.650> this<00:04:40.130> will<00:04:40.370> look

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
side again but then so this will look

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.430 
side again but then so this will look
like<00:04:40.670> a<00:04:40.730> pathway<00:04:41.030> I<00:04:41.510> guess<00:04:42.050> you<00:04:42.200> could<00:04:42.410> make

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:42.440 
like a pathway I guess you could make

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:49.200 
like a pathway I guess you could make
this<00:04:42.860> pathway<00:04:44.410> we<00:04:45.410> can<00:04:45.440> make<00:04:45.740> it<00:04:45.920> stone<00:04:46.310> bricks

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.390 

so<00:04:50.210> it<00:04:50.660> would<00:04:50.900> just<00:04:51.110> look<00:04:51.230> the<00:04:51.590> same<00:04:51.830> like<00:04:52.220> an

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
so it would just look the same like an

00:04:52.400 --> 00:05:01.950 
so it would just look the same like an
old<00:04:52.580> pathway<00:04:57.850> basically<00:04:58.850> here<00:04:59.180> like<00:04:59.690> this<00:04:59.960> and

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:01.960 
old pathway basically here like this and

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.570 
old pathway basically here like this and
then<00:05:02.960> it<00:05:03.110> will<00:05:03.140> just<00:05:03.440> lead<00:05:03.590> up<00:05:03.740> to<00:05:03.770> a<00:05:03.950> house<00:05:04.190> or

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:04.580 
then it will just lead up to a house or

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:09.220 
then it will just lead up to a house or
anything<00:05:04.880> like<00:05:05.750> that<00:05:06.040> so<00:05:07.720> that's<00:05:08.720> basically

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:09.230 
anything like that so that's basically

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:12.700 
anything like that so that's basically
what<00:05:09.470> it<00:05:09.530> looks<00:05:09.740> like<00:05:10.570> now<00:05:11.570> then<00:05:11.870> when<00:05:12.500> you<00:05:12.590> go

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:12.710 
what it looks like now then when you go

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:16.350 
what it looks like now then when you go
to<00:05:12.740> activate<00:05:13.430> it<00:05:14.440> it<00:05:15.440> will<00:05:15.620> open<00:05:15.860> up<00:05:15.980> like<00:05:16.010> this

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:16.360 
to activate it it will open up like this

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:19.150 
to activate it it will open up like this
you're<00:05:17.360> of<00:05:17.510> course<00:05:17.570> as<00:05:18.080> the<00:05:18.380> stones<00:05:18.620> cut<00:05:18.919> there

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:19.160 
you're of course as the stones cut there

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:24.240 
you're of course as the stones cut there
so<00:05:19.910> you'll<00:05:20.150> just<00:05:20.210> drop<00:05:20.750> down<00:05:20.960> one<00:05:21.320> and<00:05:22.060> then

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:24.250 
so you'll just drop down one and then

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:29.080 
so you'll just drop down one and then
these<00:05:25.250> two<00:05:25.700> will<00:05:26.080> always<00:05:27.280> well<00:05:28.280> no<00:05:28.669> you'll

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:29.090 
these two will always well no you'll

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:31.990 
these two will always well no you'll
just<00:05:29.330> delete<00:05:29.720> delete<00:05:30.530> them<00:05:30.710> smash<00:05:31.100> them<00:05:31.370> but

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:32.000 
just delete delete them smash them but

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.690 
just delete delete them smash them but
make<00:05:32.180> sure<00:05:32.210> it's<00:05:32.510> like<00:05:32.630> a<00:05:32.660> set<00:05:32.960> of<00:05:32.990> stairs<00:05:33.700> of

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:34.700 
make sure it's like a set of stairs of

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:35.800 
make sure it's like a set of stairs of
course<00:05:35.030> I<00:05:35.300> am

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:35.810 
course I am

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:41.380 
course I am
at<00:05:36.470> bedrock<00:05:36.940> climb<00:05:37.940> on<00:05:38.180> flat<00:05:38.570> land<00:05:39.790> then<00:05:40.790> I

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:41.390 
at bedrock climb on flat land then I

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:43.500 
at bedrock climb on flat land then I
will<00:05:41.570> just<00:05:41.690> have<00:05:41.840> to<00:05:41.900> create<00:05:42.260> it<00:05:42.500> like<00:05:42.650> this

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:43.510 
will just have to create it like this

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:45.909 
will just have to create it like this
make<00:05:44.510> sure<00:05:44.660> you<00:05:44.810> don't<00:05:44.990> go<00:05:45.110> into<00:05:45.350> the<00:05:45.440> walls<00:05:45.680> no

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:45.919 
make sure you don't go into the walls no

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:47.250 
make sure you don't go into the walls no
because<00:05:46.130> that<00:05:46.250> will<00:05:46.400> then<00:05:46.520> destroy<00:05:46.940> the

00:05:47.250 --> 00:05:47.260 
because that will then destroy the

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.750 
because that will then destroy the
redstone<00:05:48.260> won't<00:05:48.530> it<00:05:48.740> so<00:05:49.040> you<00:05:49.130> just<00:05:49.280> have<00:05:49.490> to<00:05:49.520> go

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:49.760 
redstone won't it so you just have to go

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:59.140 
redstone won't it so you just have to go
far<00:05:50.479> enough<00:05:53.680> like<00:05:54.680> this<00:05:56.979> so<00:05:57.979> we<00:05:58.460> just<00:05:58.760> put<00:05:59.060> the

00:05:59.140 --> 00:05:59.150 
far enough like this so we just put the

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:03.070 
far enough like this so we just put the
DEM<00:05:59.360> serenus<00:06:00.010> nearly<00:06:01.010> done<00:06:01.250> and<00:06:01.930> because<00:06:02.930> you

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:03.080 
DEM serenus nearly done and because you

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:07.000 
DEM serenus nearly done and because you
cannot<00:06:03.380> use<00:06:03.440> a<00:06:04.479> piston<00:06:05.479> and<00:06:05.930> all<00:06:06.350> that<00:06:06.650> sort<00:06:06.919> of

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:07.010 
cannot use a piston and all that sort of

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:10.300 
cannot use a piston and all that sort of
stuff<00:06:07.070> and<00:06:07.810> we<00:06:08.810> have<00:06:08.900> two<00:06:09.110> levers<00:06:09.380> you<00:06:09.860> are

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:10.310 
stuff and we have two levers you are

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:12.730 
stuff and we have two levers you are
literally<00:06:10.669> just<00:06:10.850> going<00:06:11.300> to<00:06:11.510> do<00:06:11.660> this<00:06:11.840> so

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:12.740 
literally just going to do this so

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:16.840 
literally just going to do this so
everything<00:06:13.040> just<00:06:13.160> come<00:06:13.640> back<00:06:13.820> up<00:06:15.729> and<00:06:16.729> then

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:16.850 
everything just come back up and then

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:20.969 
everything just come back up and then
you<00:06:16.880> guess<00:06:17.240> you<00:06:17.720> could<00:06:17.900> just<00:06:18.460> smash<00:06:19.460> a<00:06:19.490> slab

00:06:20.969 --> 00:06:20.979 
you guess you could just smash a slab

00:06:20.979 --> 00:06:23.920 
you guess you could just smash a slab
step<00:06:21.979> there<00:06:22.280> but<00:06:23.090> the<00:06:23.180> way<00:06:23.300> to<00:06:23.360> cover<00:06:23.660> it<00:06:23.780> back

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:23.930 
step there but the way to cover it back

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:28.840 
step there but the way to cover it back
up<00:06:25.240> this<00:06:26.240> block<00:06:26.600> should<00:06:26.870> always<00:06:27.020> be<00:06:27.380> broken<00:06:27.850> so

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:28.850 
up this block should always be broken so

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:33.400 
up this block should always be broken so
just<00:06:29.660> literally<00:06:30.669> look<00:06:31.669> like<00:06:31.700> that<00:06:32.380> and<00:06:33.380> just

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:33.410 
just literally look like that and just

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:36.790 
just literally look like that and just
cover<00:06:33.770> up<00:06:33.890> cover<00:06:34.610> it<00:06:34.850> it's<00:06:35.300> up<00:06:35.720> just<00:06:36.470> look<00:06:36.650> like

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:36.800 
cover up cover it it's up just look like

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.890 
cover up cover it it's up just look like
this<00:06:37.150> then<00:06:38.150> when<00:06:38.360> you<00:06:38.479> under<00:06:38.900> it<00:06:38.960> just<00:06:39.320> jump<00:06:40.099> up

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:40.900 
this then when you under it just jump up

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:43.890 
this then when you under it just jump up
smash<00:06:41.900> the<00:06:42.140> block

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:43.900 
smash the block

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:47.800 
smash the block
they<00:06:44.900> said<00:06:45.170> they're<00:06:45.460> smashed<00:06:46.460> there<00:06:46.810> and

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:47.810 
they said they're smashed there and

00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:50.530 
they said they're smashed there and
there<00:06:48.800> he'll<00:06:48.980> walk<00:06:49.130> away<00:06:49.400> which<00:06:49.880> will<00:06:50.240> then

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:50.540 
there he'll walk away which will then

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:53.830 
there he'll walk away which will then
lead<00:06:50.900> up<00:06:51.080> to<00:06:51.110> a<00:06:51.290> house<00:06:51.550> so<00:06:52.550> there<00:06:53.150> we<00:06:53.240> go<00:06:53.270> guys
