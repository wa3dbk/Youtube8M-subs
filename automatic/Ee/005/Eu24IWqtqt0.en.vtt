00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.459 

now<00:00:38.760> I'm<00:00:38.910> going<00:00:39.090> to<00:00:39.149> do<00:00:39.300> it<00:00:39.480> okay<00:00:39.750> so<00:00:39.989> here's

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
now I'm going to do it okay so here's

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.369 
now I'm going to do it okay so here's
what<00:00:40.649> it<00:00:40.680> looks<00:00:40.980> like<00:00:41.510> and<00:00:42.510> I'm<00:00:42.750> just<00:00:42.780> stirring

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
what it looks like and I'm just stirring

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.020 
what it looks like and I'm just stirring
it<00:00:43.440> in<00:00:45.589> and<00:00:46.589> what<00:00:46.710> I'm<00:00:46.769> going<00:00:46.860> to<00:00:46.949> do<00:00:47.190> after<00:00:48.000> I

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
it in and what I'm going to do after I

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.759 
it in and what I'm going to do after I
cover<00:00:48.329> this<00:00:48.570> and<00:00:48.809> put<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:49.019> blanket<00:00:49.379> over<00:00:49.469> so

00:00:49.759 --> 00:00:49.769 
cover this and put the blanket over so

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:51.910 
cover this and put the blanket over so
I'm<00:00:49.829> gonna<00:00:49.980> let<00:00:50.070> it<00:00:50.190> sit<00:00:50.370> for<00:00:50.399> 90<00:00:50.940> minutes<00:00:51.120> 90

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:51.920 
I'm gonna let it sit for 90 minutes 90

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.829 
I'm gonna let it sit for 90 minutes 90
and<00:00:52.920> every<00:00:53.729> 15<00:00:53.879> minutes<00:00:54.420> I'm<00:00:54.510> going<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.659> come

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:54.839 
and every 15 minutes I'm going to come

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:59.119 
and every 15 minutes I'm going to come
back<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:55.110> stir<00:00:55.440> it<00:00:57.409> okay<00:00:58.409> here<00:00:58.680> I'm<00:00:58.769> going<00:00:59.010> to

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
back and stir it okay here I'm going to

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.490 
back and stir it okay here I'm going to
test<00:00:59.339> the<00:00:59.579> pH<00:00:59.850> of<00:00:59.879> my<00:01:00.239> mash<00:01:00.479> we've<00:01:01.170> got<00:01:01.320> these

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
test the pH of my mash we've got these

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:10.130 
test the pH of my mash we've got these
test<00:01:01.890> drips<00:01:05.240> dump<00:01:06.240> it<00:01:06.360> in<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.600> mesh<00:01:09.140> that's

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
test drips dump it in the mesh that's

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.060 
test drips dump it in the mesh that's
pretty<00:01:10.500> much

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.070 
pretty much

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.840 
pretty much
between<00:01:12.790> five<00:01:13.060> point<00:01:13.360> nine<00:01:13.390> five<00:01:13.750> point<00:01:14.080> four

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
between five point nine five point four

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.660 
between five point nine five point four
so<00:01:15.850> our<00:01:15.970> pH<00:01:16.240> of<00:01:16.450> our<00:01:16.540> mash<00:01:16.720> is<00:01:16.990> good<00:01:17.280> my<00:01:18.280> ninety

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
so our pH of our mash is good my ninety

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.300 
so our pH of our mash is good my ninety
minutes<00:01:18.940> are<00:01:19.090> up<00:01:19.120> on<00:01:19.480> the<00:01:21.300> on<00:01:22.300> the<00:01:22.420> blue<00:01:22.540> pot

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
minutes are up on the on the blue pot

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.740 
minutes are up on the on the blue pot

boil and a fag methods and now I've
collected<00:01:25.960> a<00:01:26.200> little<00:01:26.290> bit<00:01:26.530> of<00:01:26.620> wort<00:01:26.860> here<00:01:27.570> I'm

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
collected a little bit of wort here I'm

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.780 
collected a little bit of wort here I'm
going<00:01:28.900> to<00:01:28.990> put<00:01:29.230> this<00:01:29.920> is<00:01:30.130> I'm<00:01:30.340> going<00:01:30.550> to<00:01:30.610> piss

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:30.790 
going to put this is I'm going to piss

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.460 
going to put this is I'm going to piss
my<00:01:31.030> Oda<00:01:31.240> for<00:01:31.570> up<00:01:31.810> here<00:01:32.290> and<00:01:33.220> that's<00:01:33.460> my<00:01:33.670> control

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
my Oda for up here and that's my control

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.750 
my Oda for up here and that's my control
so<00:01:35.470> I<00:01:35.500> know<00:01:35.590> what<00:01:35.800> it<00:01:36.250> looks<00:01:36.460> like<00:01:36.580> without

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:36.760 
so I know what it looks like without

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:39.000 
so I know what it looks like without
anything<00:01:37.390> in<00:01:37.480> it<00:01:37.600> and<00:01:38.350> now<00:01:38.530> I'm<00:01:38.620> going<00:01:38.800> to<00:01:38.920> add

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:39.010 
anything in it and now I'm going to add

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.700 
anything in it and now I'm going to add
a<00:01:39.040> drop<00:01:39.340> to<00:01:39.490> the<00:01:39.610> wort<00:01:40.260> it<00:01:41.260> stays<00:01:41.530> the<00:01:41.650> same

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
a drop to the wort it stays the same

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.719 
a drop to the wort it stays the same
color<00:01:42.130> my<00:01:42.850> starch<00:01:43.150> conversion<00:01:43.660> is<00:01:43.750> complete

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
color my starch conversion is complete

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.240 
color my starch conversion is complete
if<00:01:45.729> it<00:01:45.940> goes<00:01:46.120> darker<00:01:46.600> than<00:01:46.750> the<00:01:46.840> iodine<00:01:47.250> and

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
if it goes darker than the iodine and

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.310 
if it goes darker than the iodine and
the<00:01:48.400> iota<00:01:48.670> for<00:01:48.940> then<00:01:49.510> the<00:01:49.630> starch<00:01:49.930> conversion

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.320 
the iota for then the starch conversion

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.670 
the iota for then the starch conversion
is<00:01:50.380> not<00:01:50.590> complete<00:01:50.979> and<00:01:51.970> I<00:01:52.150> would<00:01:52.360> say<00:01:52.600> that<00:01:53.410> is

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:53.680 
is not complete and I would say that is

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.000 
is not complete and I would say that is
starch<00:01:54.490> conversion<00:01:55.030> complete<00:01:55.180> ok<00:01:55.990> we're<00:01:56.860> done

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.010 
starch conversion complete ok we're done

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.030 
starch conversion complete ok we're done
with<00:01:57.220> our<00:01:57.370> mashing<00:01:57.880> then<00:01:58.060> and<00:01:58.620> this<00:01:59.620> is<00:01:59.680> a<00:01:59.830> no

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.040 
with our mashing then and this is a no

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.219 
with our mashing then and this is a no
sparge<00:02:00.400> method<00:02:00.850> so<00:02:01.630> we're<00:02:01.750> going<00:02:01.840> to<00:02:01.900> take<00:02:02.050> the

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
sparge method so we're going to take the

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:14.520 
sparge method so we're going to take the
clips<00:02:02.470> off<00:02:02.740> the<00:02:02.950> sides<00:02:03.420> of<00:02:04.420> the<00:02:04.660> pot

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.750 

and<00:02:15.530> now<00:02:15.680> we're<00:02:15.860> just<00:02:15.890> gonna<00:02:16.100> let<00:02:16.280> this<00:02:16.400> drain

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:16.760 
and now we're just gonna let this drain

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.210 
and now we're just gonna let this drain
and<00:02:17.200> then<00:02:18.200> I'm<00:02:18.320> going<00:02:18.500> to<00:02:18.560> switch<00:02:18.830> it<00:02:18.860> over<00:02:19.070> to

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
and then I'm going to switch it over to

as the wort chiller is running you can
see<00:04:20.449> the<00:04:20.600> the<00:04:21.199> temperature<00:04:21.470> actually

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:21.769 
see the the temperature actually

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:27.100 
see the the temperature actually
dropping<00:04:22.370> from<00:04:22.850> the<00:04:23.000> broom<00:04:23.180> ometer<00:04:26.110> it's

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
dropping from the broom ometer it's

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:29.800 
dropping from the broom ometer it's
going<00:04:27.530> down<00:04:27.740> that<00:04:28.039> fast<00:04:28.639> I've<00:04:29.389> actually<00:04:29.570> been

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
going down that fast I've actually been

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.170 
going down that fast I've actually been
doing<00:04:29.960> several<00:04:30.410> other<00:04:30.560> things<00:04:30.680> while<00:04:31.190> boiling

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
doing several other things while boiling

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:33.760 
doing several other things while boiling
the<00:04:32.360> wort<00:04:32.660> and<00:04:32.780> so<00:04:32.990> forth<00:04:33.320> and<00:04:33.500> now<00:04:33.680> I'm

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
the wort and so forth and now I'm

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.180 
the wort and so forth and now I'm
chilling<00:04:34.160> it<00:04:34.220> cuz<00:04:35.210> I'm<00:04:36.139> rehydrating<00:04:36.530> my<00:04:36.949> yeast

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:37.190 
chilling it cuz I'm rehydrating my yeast

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:40.540 
chilling it cuz I'm rehydrating my yeast
this<00:04:38.060> is<00:04:38.330> water<00:04:39.199> that<00:04:39.530> I<00:04:39.560> boiled<00:04:39.650> in<00:04:40.160> this<00:04:40.310> cup

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:40.550 
this is water that I boiled in this cup

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.210 
this is water that I boiled in this cup
and<00:04:40.580> then<00:04:41.300> I<00:04:41.330> let<00:04:41.570> it<00:04:41.690> cool<00:04:41.870> down<00:04:42.110> to<00:04:42.380> below<00:04:42.919> 90

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.220 
and then I let it cool down to below 90

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:45.670 
and then I let it cool down to below 90
degrees<00:04:43.580> and<00:04:44.330> it<00:04:44.509> actually<00:04:44.840> took<00:04:44.990> a<00:04:45.169> long<00:04:45.380> time

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
degrees and it actually took a long time

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:46.719 
degrees and it actually took a long time
I'm<00:04:45.860> we're<00:04:46.009> not<00:04:46.130> going<00:04:46.250> to<00:04:46.280> do<00:04:46.400> this<00:04:46.520> in<00:04:46.669> a

00:04:46.719 --> 00:04:46.729 
I'm we're not going to do this in a

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:49.180 
I'm we're not going to do this in a
Pyrex<00:04:47.120> cup<00:04:47.389> next<00:04:47.720> time<00:04:47.870> took<00:04:48.560> a<00:04:48.620> long<00:04:48.830> time<00:04:48.860> to

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:49.190 
Pyrex cup next time took a long time to

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:52.029 
Pyrex cup next time took a long time to
cool<00:04:49.340> I<00:04:49.400> actually<00:04:49.669> had<00:04:49.940> to<00:04:50.060> put<00:04:50.090> it<00:04:50.389> in<00:04:51.039> the

00:04:52.029 --> 00:04:52.039 
cool I actually had to put it in the

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:56.560 
cool I actually had to put it in the
freezer<00:04:52.310> for<00:04:52.720> a<00:04:53.720> couple<00:04:54.229> of<00:04:54.500> minutes<00:04:55.389> to<00:04:56.389> get

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.570 
freezer for a couple of minutes to get

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:58.900 
freezer for a couple of minutes to get
the<00:04:56.780> temperature<00:04:57.080> down<00:04:57.380> so<00:04:58.070> it<00:04:58.220> says<00:04:58.460> just<00:04:58.759> the

00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:58.910 
the temperature down so it says just the

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:00.850 
the temperature down so it says just the
three<00:04:59.300> yeast<00:04:59.539> in<00:04:59.750> here<00:04:59.990> and<00:05:00.139> let<00:05:00.259> it<00:05:00.289> sit<00:05:00.650> and

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860 
three yeast in here and let it sit and

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.650 
three yeast in here and let it sit and
then<00:05:01.340> five<00:05:01.610> minutes<00:05:01.789> later<00:05:02.030> I'll<00:05:02.330> come<00:05:02.509> back

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:02.660 
then five minutes later I'll come back

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:05.249 
then five minutes later I'll come back
and<00:05:02.840> sort<00:05:03.080> of<00:05:03.199> stir<00:05:03.620> it<00:05:03.740> up<00:05:03.800> a<00:05:03.949> little<00:05:04.070> bit

00:05:05.249 --> 00:05:05.259 
and sort of stir it up a little bit

00:05:05.259 --> 00:05:07.450 
and sort of stir it up a little bit
rehydrate<00:05:06.259> our<00:05:06.380> yeast<00:05:06.620> so<00:05:06.860> they<00:05:07.009> don't<00:05:07.190> hit

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:07.460 
rehydrate our yeast so they don't hit

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:10.210 
rehydrate our yeast so they don't hit
sugar<00:05:08.000> water<00:05:08.300> as<00:05:08.570> their<00:05:09.110> first<00:05:09.380> hydration

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:10.220 
sugar water as their first hydration

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.640 
sugar water as their first hydration
because<00:05:10.400> sometimes<00:05:11.000> the<00:05:11.690> yeasts<00:05:12.139> won't<00:05:12.349> make

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:12.650 
because sometimes the yeasts won't make

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.740 
because sometimes the yeasts won't make
it<00:05:12.860> if<00:05:13.070> you<00:05:13.130> put<00:05:13.370> them<00:05:13.490> straight<00:05:13.699> into<00:05:13.940> high

00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:14.750 
it if you put them straight into high

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:17.260 
it if you put them straight into high
into<00:05:15.199> wort

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:17.270

things this is my fermenter if I get a
little<00:05:23.389> of<00:05:23.539> it<00:05:23.630> now<00:05:23.720> and<00:05:23.870> I've<00:05:23.930> been<00:05:24.080> shaking

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.560 
little of it now and I've been shaking

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.559 
little of it now and I've been shaking
it<00:05:24.680> around<00:05:24.740> with<00:05:25.130> starsin<00:05:25.970> and<00:05:26.150> it's<00:05:26.449> gonna

00:05:26.559 --> 00:05:26.569 
it around with starsin and it's gonna

00:05:26.569 --> 00:05:29.100 
it around with starsin and it's gonna
start<00:05:26.810> sitting<00:05:27.080> in<00:05:27.169> it<00:05:27.289> I<00:05:27.440> get<00:05:28.280> to<00:05:28.340> see<00:05:28.430> that

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.110 
start sitting in it I get to see that

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:32.290 
start sitting in it I get to see that
disgust<00:05:30.110> are<00:05:30.289> saying<00:05:30.500> in<00:05:30.650> it<00:05:30.819> and<00:05:31.819> I've<00:05:32.150> just

disgust are saying in it and I've just
been<00:05:32.479> shaking<00:05:32.900> it<00:05:33.020> up<00:05:33.110> every<00:05:33.410> couple<00:05:33.680> of

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:33.740 
been shaking it up every couple of

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:35.710 
been shaking it up every couple of
minutes<00:05:33.830> and<00:05:34.130> letting<00:05:34.340> us<00:05:34.430> sit<00:05:34.610> and<00:05:35.389> I've<00:05:35.509> got

stuff sitting in that so everything from
here<00:05:40.940> on<00:05:41.060> out<00:05:41.210> has<00:05:41.479> to<00:05:41.509> be<00:05:41.780> sanitized<00:05:42.380> with<00:05:43.220> a

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:43.250 
here on out has to be sanitized with a

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:49.600 
here on out has to be sanitized with a
sanitizer<00:05:46.479> okay<00:05:47.479> now<00:05:48.410> our<00:05:48.440> ward<00:05:48.830> is<00:05:48.979> a<00:05:49.009> chill

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:49.610 
sanitizer okay now our ward is a chill

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:52.180 
sanitizer okay now our ward is a chill
to<00:05:49.639> a<00:05:49.849> nice<00:05:50.060> comfortable<00:05:50.270> 80<00:05:50.780> degrees<00:05:51.199> and<00:05:51.740> I'm

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:52.190 
to a nice comfortable 80 degrees and I'm

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:54.279 
to a nice comfortable 80 degrees and I'm
going<00:05:52.250> to<00:05:52.580> do<00:05:53.150> another<00:05:53.570> step<00:05:53.810> first<00:05:54.110> we'll

00:05:54.279 --> 00:05:54.289 
going to do another step first we'll

00:05:54.289 --> 00:06:03.370 
going to do another step first we'll
take<00:05:54.440> the<00:05:57.160> take<00:05:58.160> out<00:05:58.370> the<00:05:59.620> chiller<00:06:01.539> and<00:06:02.539> put<00:06:03.289> it

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:03.380 
take the take out the chiller and put it

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:08.800 
take the take out the chiller and put it
in<00:06:03.440> the<00:06:03.530> sink

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:08.810 

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:11.230 

then<00:06:09.350> I'm<00:06:09.500> going<00:06:09.740> to<00:06:09.800> take<00:06:10.040> my<00:06:10.220> now<00:06:10.520> washed<00:06:10.880> and

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:11.240 
then I'm going to take my now washed and

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:16.210 
then I'm going to take my now washed and
sanitized<00:06:12.640> starsin<00:06:13.640> paddle<00:06:14.710> and<00:06:15.710> I'm<00:06:15.860> going

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:16.220 
sanitized starsin paddle and I'm going

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:25.150 
sanitized starsin paddle and I'm going
to<00:06:16.400> swirl<00:06:16.760> this<00:06:18.400> and<00:06:19.400> a<00:06:20.360> circular<00:06:20.660> motion<00:06:24.160> and

00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:25.160 
to swirl this and a circular motion and

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:29.620 
to swirl this and a circular motion and
get<00:06:25.400> it<00:06:25.520> really<00:06:25.820> swirling<00:06:28.330> and<00:06:29.330> then<00:06:29.510> I'm

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:29.630 
get it really swirling and then I'm

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:31.060 
get it really swirling and then I'm
going<00:06:29.780> to<00:06:29.810> let<00:06:29.990> it<00:06:30.020> sit<00:06:30.290> for<00:06:30.320> fifteen<00:06:30.920> minutes

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:31.070 
going to let it sit for fifteen minutes

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:36.660 
going to let it sit for fifteen minutes
and<00:06:31.490> this<00:06:32.120> will<00:06:32.180> help<00:06:32.750> drop<00:06:33.200> the<00:06:34.990> hard<00:06:35.990> bits

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:36.670 
and this will help drop the hard bits
