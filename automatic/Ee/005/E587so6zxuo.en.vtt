00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:08.460 
hello battlefield errs on time itself

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:09.919 
hello battlefield errs on time itself
and<00:00:08.610> in<00:00:08.820> this<00:00:08.940> video<00:00:09.210> I'll<00:00:09.389> be<00:00:09.510> taking<00:00:09.750> a<00:00:09.809> look

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
and in this video I'll be taking a look

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.450 
and in this video I'll be taking a look
at<00:00:10.080> some<00:00:10.260> of<00:00:10.380> the<00:00:10.500> new<00:00:10.710> integration<00:00:11.190> between

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
at some of the new integration between

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.959 
at some of the new integration between
battle<00:00:12.059> log<00:00:12.269> and<00:00:12.690> current<00:00:13.230> gen<00:00:13.380> consoles<00:00:13.969> dice

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
battle log and current gen consoles dice

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.640 
battle log and current gen consoles dice
really<00:00:15.450> seems<00:00:15.690> to<00:00:15.780> be<00:00:15.870> pushing<00:00:16.080> this<00:00:16.289> battle

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
really seems to be pushing this battle

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.080 
really seems to be pushing this battle
log<00:00:16.770> thing<00:00:17.039> because<00:00:17.340> there<00:00:17.520> is<00:00:17.640> a<00:00:17.670> lot<00:00:18.060> of

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
log thing because there is a lot of

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.210 
log thing because there is a lot of
functionality<00:00:18.630> here<00:00:19.050> in<00:00:19.260> battle<00:00:19.619> log<00:00:19.770> that

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
functionality here in battle log that

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.970 
functionality here in battle log that
isn't<00:00:20.609> available<00:00:20.670> in<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.420> main<00:00:21.539> game<00:00:21.900> to<00:00:22.800> me

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
isn't available in the main game to me

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.400 
isn't available in the main game to me
the<00:00:23.130> most<00:00:23.310> useful<00:00:23.730> is<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:24.210> server<00:00:24.480> browser<00:00:24.720> in

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
the most useful is the server browser in

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.259 
the most useful is the server browser in
game<00:00:25.800> you<00:00:25.980> have<00:00:26.130> some<00:00:26.369> options<00:00:26.820> to<00:00:26.880> set<00:00:27.150> your

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
game you have some options to set your

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.359 
game you have some options to set your
search<00:00:27.449> filter<00:00:27.930> but<00:00:28.439> on<00:00:28.529> battle<00:00:28.859> log<00:00:29.010> you<00:00:29.189> have

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
search filter but on battle log you have

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.279 
search filter but on battle log you have
even<00:00:29.849> more<00:00:30.090> really<00:00:30.539> helps<00:00:30.720> you<00:00:30.810> pin<00:00:30.990> down<00:00:31.140> the

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
even more really helps you pin down the

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:32.389 
even more really helps you pin down the
game<00:00:31.410> you're<00:00:31.590> looking<00:00:31.859> for<00:00:32.009> especially<00:00:32.160> if

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
game you're looking for especially if

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:33.319 
game you're looking for especially if
you're<00:00:32.489> looking<00:00:32.550> for<00:00:32.790> something<00:00:33.059> a<00:00:33.120> little

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
you're looking for something a little

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.930 
you're looking for something a little
unusual<00:00:33.860> notably<00:00:34.860> absent<00:00:35.070> though<00:00:35.460> is<00:00:35.700> the

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
unusual notably absent though is the

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.940 
unusual notably absent though is the
option<00:00:36.360> for<00:00:36.390> the<00:00:36.750> ammo<00:00:37.020> pool<00:00:37.230> conservation

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
option for the ammo pool conservation

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.110 
option for the ammo pool conservation
that's<00:00:38.160> supposed<00:00:38.460> to<00:00:38.520> be<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:38.640> server<00:00:38.879> side

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
that's supposed to be a server side

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.760 
that's supposed to be a server side
option<00:00:39.420> but<00:00:39.540> you<00:00:39.629> can't<00:00:39.840> set<00:00:40.020> a<00:00:40.050> filter<00:00:40.440> for<00:00:40.649> it

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
option but you can't set a filter for it

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:43.639 
option but you can't set a filter for it
that's<00:00:41.430> kind<00:00:41.670> of<00:00:41.700> annoying<00:00:41.879> also<00:00:42.809> for<00:00:43.320> console

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
that's kind of annoying also for console

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.010 
that's kind of annoying also for console
players<00:00:43.829> we<00:00:44.129> can<00:00:44.430> see<00:00:44.820> pinging<00:00:45.120> now<00:00:45.360> I<00:00:45.570> can<00:00:45.840> see

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.479 
players we can see pinging now I can see
the<00:00:46.140> ping<00:00:46.350> of<00:00:46.530> most<00:00:46.739> of<00:00:46.890> the<00:00:46.980> server's<00:00:47.340> I'm

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489

hit<00:01:01.620> join<00:01:01.980> and<00:01:02.309> it<00:01:02.910> takes<00:01:03.120> less<00:01:03.510> than<00:01:03.809> two<00:01:04.080> or

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
three seconds and it tries to pull me in

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.149 
three seconds and it tries to pull me in
and<00:01:06.479> no<00:01:07.140> commander<00:01:07.470> site<00:01:07.650> that<00:01:07.830> means<00:01:08.010> the

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
and no commander site that means the

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.160 
and no commander site that means the
game<00:01:08.340> is<00:01:08.369> full<00:01:08.850> I<00:01:09.000> think<00:01:09.270> and<00:01:09.420> so<00:01:10.049> they

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
game is full I think and so they

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.929 
game is full I think and so they
couldn't<00:01:10.380> put<00:01:10.590> me<00:01:10.710> in<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:11.070> I'm<00:01:11.549> not<00:01:11.580> high

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
couldn't put me in and I'm not high

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.760 
couldn't put me in and I'm not high
enough<00:01:11.970> level<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.450> be<00:01:12.570> commander<00:01:12.960> yet<00:01:13.170> so<00:01:13.500> that

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
enough level to be commander yet so that

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.380 
enough level to be commander yet so that
happens<00:01:14.070> occasionally<00:01:14.340> one<00:01:15.240> of<00:01:15.330> the

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
happens occasionally one of the

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.880 
happens occasionally one of the
downsides<00:01:15.570> is<00:01:15.990> it<00:01:16.170> seems<00:01:16.380> to<00:01:16.470> take<00:01:16.650> a<00:01:16.680> little

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
downsides is it seems to take a little

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.160 
downsides is it seems to take a little
while<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.159> refresh<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.390> player<00:01:18.630> counts<00:01:19.049> and

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
while to refresh the player counts and

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.260 
while to refresh the player counts and
the<00:01:19.229> servers<00:01:19.850> there's<00:01:20.850> a<00:01:20.909> refresh<00:01:21.240> button

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
the servers there's a refresh button

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.030 
the servers there's a refresh button
there<00:01:21.720> but<00:01:21.960> it<00:01:22.080> doesn't<00:01:22.290> seem<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.680> like<00:01:22.860> this

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
there but it doesn't seem to like this

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.890 
there but it doesn't seem to like this
too<00:01:23.220> much<00:01:23.369> and<00:01:23.580> so<00:01:23.850> sometimes<00:01:24.540> you<00:01:24.720> get<00:01:24.840> a

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
too much and so sometimes you get a

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.240 
too much and so sometimes you get a
little<00:01:25.080> bit<00:01:25.140> out<00:01:25.290> of<00:01:25.320> date<00:01:25.439> information<00:01:25.890> and

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
little bit out of date information and

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.710 
little bit out of date information and
you<00:01:26.369> try<00:01:26.549> to<00:01:26.610> join<00:01:26.820> a<00:01:26.850> server<00:01:27.180> that's<00:01:27.420> actually

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
you try to join a server that's actually

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.749 
you try to join a server that's actually
full<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.380> same<00:01:28.590> thing<00:01:28.770> happens<00:01:29.100> in<00:01:29.280> game<00:01:29.549> is

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
full the same thing happens in game is

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.910 
full the same thing happens in game is
just<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.210> Refresh<00:01:30.630> works<00:01:30.900> a<00:01:31.049> little<00:01:31.290> faster

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
just the Refresh works a little faster

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.710 
just the Refresh works a little faster
anyway<00:01:32.280> let's<00:01:32.610> try<00:01:32.729> again<00:01:35.329> very<00:01:36.329> good<00:01:36.390> seems

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
anyway let's try again very good seems

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.719 
anyway let's try again very good seems
to<00:01:36.840> be<00:01:36.930> working<00:01:37.200> this<00:01:37.290> time<00:01:37.500> now<00:01:38.189> while<00:01:38.579> I'm

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
to be working this time now while I'm

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:40.429 
to be working this time now while I'm
waiting<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.240> load<00:01:39.479> into<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.900> game<00:01:40.079> how<00:01:40.409> about

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
waiting to load into the game how about

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.649 
waiting to load into the game how about
I<00:01:40.710> go<00:01:40.979> ahead<00:01:41.130> and<00:01:41.310> make<00:01:41.640> some<00:01:41.670> changes<00:01:41.880> to<00:01:42.329> my

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
I go ahead and make some changes to my

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.170 
I go ahead and make some changes to my
load<00:01:42.990> outs<00:01:43.170> and<00:01:43.890> battle<00:01:44.520> log<00:01:44.640> will<00:01:44.820> let<00:01:44.939> me<00:01:45.060> do

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
load outs and battle log will let me do

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.450 
load outs and battle log will let me do
that<00:01:45.329> this<00:01:46.170> is<00:01:46.229> especially<00:01:46.740> useful<00:01:47.009> in

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
that this is especially useful in

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.910 
that this is especially useful in
battlefield<00:01:47.909> 4<00:01:48.000> because<00:01:48.600> unlike<00:01:48.990> three<00:01:49.530> you

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
new features are kind of useful I can

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.270 
new features are kind of useful I can
see<00:02:00.540> what<00:02:00.780> game<00:02:01.049> type<00:02:01.409> and<00:02:01.619> map<00:02:01.770> I'm<00:02:01.979> gonna<00:02:02.130> be

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
see what game type and map I'm gonna be

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.859 
see what game type and map I'm gonna be
on<00:02:02.430> when<00:02:02.759> I'm<00:02:02.850> making<00:02:03.030> changes<00:02:03.450> to<00:02:03.509> my<00:02:03.570> classes

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
on when I'm making changes to my classes

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.480 
on when I'm making changes to my classes
I<00:02:04.140> don't<00:02:04.350> think<00:02:04.530> I<00:02:04.590> can<00:02:04.649> tell<00:02:04.890> which<00:02:05.040> side<00:02:05.310> I'm

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
I don't think I can tell which side I'm

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.249 
I don't think I can tell which side I'm
gonna<00:02:05.579> spawn<00:02:05.790> in<00:02:05.969> offense<00:02:06.360> or<00:02:06.479> defense<00:02:06.509> but<00:02:07.229> I

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
gonna spawn in offense or defense but I

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:08.779 
gonna spawn in offense or defense but I
can<00:02:07.439> go<00:02:07.500> ahead<00:02:07.619> and<00:02:07.770> make<00:02:08.069> my<00:02:08.099> changes<00:02:08.610> here<00:02:08.759> so

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
can go ahead and make my changes here so

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.580 
can go ahead and make my changes here so
for<00:02:09.509> example<00:02:09.780> here<00:02:09.869> I'm<00:02:09.959> just<00:02:10.020> gonna<00:02:10.140> swap<00:02:10.470> my

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
for example here I'm just gonna swap my

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.860 
for example here I'm just gonna swap my
defibs<00:02:10.950> out<00:02:11.160> for<00:02:11.430> a<00:02:11.459> first-aid<00:02:12.000> kit<00:02:12.060> and<00:02:12.450> then

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
defibs out for a first-aid kit and then

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.120 
defibs out for a first-aid kit and then
I<00:02:12.959> need<00:02:13.110> to<00:02:13.200> hit<00:02:13.349> say

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
I need to hit say

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:15.590 
I need to hit say
and<00:02:14.250> you'll<00:02:14.430> see<00:02:14.580> the<00:02:14.670> change<00:02:14.700> propagate<00:02:15.570> to

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
and you'll see the change propagate to

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.350 
and you'll see the change propagate to
in<00:02:16.050> game<00:02:16.290> in<00:02:16.590> what<00:02:16.830> no<00:02:17.130> two<00:02:17.640> maybe<00:02:18.030> three

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
in game in what no two maybe three

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.020 
in game in what no two maybe three
seconds<00:02:18.720> boom<00:02:18.960> there<00:02:19.380> it<00:02:19.500> is<00:02:19.620> and<00:02:19.950> if<00:02:20.820> you<00:02:20.910> were

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
seconds boom there it is and if you were

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:22.940 
seconds boom there it is and if you were
curious<00:02:21.210> yes<00:02:21.750> it<00:02:21.990> does<00:02:22.230> work<00:02:22.260> the<00:02:22.650> other<00:02:22.800> way

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
curious yes it does work the other way

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.710 
curious yes it does work the other way
around<00:02:23.070> I<00:02:23.370> can<00:02:23.550> make<00:02:23.640> changes<00:02:24.030> in<00:02:24.180> game<00:02:24.480> and

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:24.720 
around I can make changes in game and

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.480 
around I can make changes in game and
they'll<00:02:24.930> show<00:02:25.140> up<00:02:25.320> on<00:02:25.470> battle<00:02:25.830> log<00:02:25.980> in<00:02:26.160> just<00:02:26.400> a

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
they'll show up on battle log in just a

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.010 
they'll show up on battle log in just a
couple<00:02:26.670> seconds<00:02:27.090> it<00:02:27.210> takes<00:02:27.600> a<00:02:27.750> little<00:02:27.930> bit

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
couple seconds it takes a little bit

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.570 
couple seconds it takes a little bit
longer<00:02:28.320> that's<00:02:28.650> just<00:02:28.950> the<00:02:29.040> nature<00:02:29.220> of<00:02:29.340> web

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
longer that's just the nature of web

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.770 
longer that's just the nature of web
interfaces<00:02:29.970> but<00:02:30.300> it's<00:02:30.420> it's<00:02:30.960> pretty<00:02:31.230> good<00:02:32.780> one

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
interfaces but it's it's pretty good one

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:34.910 
interfaces but it's it's pretty good one
issue<00:02:33.960> that<00:02:34.230> I've<00:02:34.320> had<00:02:34.500> that<00:02:34.650> I<00:02:34.740> should

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
issue that I've had that I should

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.190 
issue that I've had that I should
definitely<00:02:35.400> point<00:02:35.580> out<00:02:35.790> is<00:02:35.970> that<00:02:36.390> unlocks<00:02:36.960> you

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
definitely point out is that unlocks you

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.110 
definitely point out is that unlocks you
get<00:02:37.380> in<00:02:37.530> the<00:02:37.650> middle<00:02:37.920> of<00:02:38.010> a<00:02:38.100> game<00:02:38.310> we<00:02:38.700> won't<00:02:38.910> be

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
get in the middle of a game we won't be

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.780 
get in the middle of a game we won't be
available<00:02:39.390> to<00:02:39.750> equip<00:02:40.110> on<00:02:40.350> battle<00:02:40.950> log<00:02:41.160> until

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
available to equip on battle log until

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.880 
available to equip on battle log until
the<00:02:42.060> game<00:02:42.240> is<00:02:42.420> over<00:02:42.660> you<00:02:43.260> can<00:02:43.410> still<00:02:43.530> equip

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
the game is over you can still equip

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:45.470 
the game is over you can still equip
them<00:02:44.070> in<00:02:44.220> game<00:02:44.580> that's<00:02:44.820> not<00:02:45.000> a<00:02:45.030> problem<00:02:45.360> it's

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
them in game that's not a problem it's

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.210 
them in game that's not a problem it's
just<00:02:45.630> that<00:02:45.930> the<00:02:46.140> battle<00:02:46.500> log<00:02:46.650> thing<00:02:46.890> doesn't

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
just that the battle log thing doesn't

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.430 
just that the battle log thing doesn't
seem<00:02:47.340> to<00:02:47.430> update<00:02:47.820> until<00:02:48.540> the<00:02:48.720> end<00:02:48.900> of<00:02:49.110> the<00:02:49.230> game

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:49.440 
seem to update until the end of the game

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.350 
seem to update until the end of the game
so<00:02:49.680> for<00:02:50.100> example<00:02:50.459> I<00:02:50.550> just<00:02:50.580> got<00:02:50.820> the<00:02:50.910> last<00:02:51.120> two

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
so for example I just got the last two

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.390 
so for example I just got the last two
kills<00:02:51.600> I<00:02:51.750> needed<00:02:52.050> for<00:02:52.110> the<00:02:52.200> ak-12<00:02:52.620> speak'<00:02:53.370> a

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
kills I needed for the ak-12 speak' a

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:56.540 
kills I needed for the ak-12 speak' a
3.4<00:02:54.270> X<00:02:54.450> scope<00:02:54.780> and<00:02:54.959> if<00:02:55.680> I<00:02:55.800> pull<00:02:56.010> up<00:02:56.040> battle<00:02:56.400> log

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:56.550 
3.4 X scope and if I pull up battle log

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:58.280 
3.4 X scope and if I pull up battle log
right<00:02:56.880> now<00:02:57.150> and<00:02:57.540> it<00:02:57.660> doesn't<00:02:57.840> matter<00:02:58.050> if<00:02:58.140> I

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
right now and it doesn't matter if I

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.620

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:03.600 
4 I do feel like some of these things

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.270 
4 I do feel like some of these things
should<00:04:03.989> have<00:04:04.110> been<00:04:04.140> in<00:04:04.560> the<00:04:04.739> main<00:04:04.950> game

should have been in the main game
obviously<00:04:06.180> the<00:04:06.390> things<00:04:06.570> you<00:04:06.630> can't<00:04:06.900> do<00:04:07.049> like

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080 
obviously the things you can't do like

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.350 
obviously the things you can't do like
changing<00:04:07.620> classes<00:04:07.950> during<00:04:08.400> a<00:04:08.670> loading<00:04:09.090> menu

changing classes during a loading menu

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.449 
changing classes during a loading menu
that's<00:04:09.600> now<00:04:10.200> maybe<00:04:10.560> you<00:04:10.769> could<00:04:10.980> but<00:04:11.190> that's

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
that's now maybe you could but that's

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:14.090 
that's now maybe you could but that's
not<00:04:11.730> typical<00:04:12.239> but<00:04:12.810> like<00:04:13.019> between<00:04:13.380> rounds<00:04:13.920> not

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
not typical but like between rounds not

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:15.710 
not typical but like between rounds not
being<00:04:14.280> able<00:04:14.370> to<00:04:14.459> change<00:04:14.549> classes<00:04:15.000> I<00:04:15.209> still

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
being able to change classes I still

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.030 
being able to change classes I still
don't<00:04:15.870> know<00:04:15.959> why<00:04:16.140> that<00:04:16.410> and<00:04:16.560> this<00:04:16.650> is<00:04:16.799> just<00:04:16.919> a

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:17.040 
don't know why that and this is just a

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:18.860 
don't know why that and this is just a
really<00:04:17.370> really<00:04:17.729> awkward<00:04:18.030> workaround

00:04:18.860 --> 00:04:18.870 
really really awkward workaround

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:21.170 
really really awkward workaround
nonetheless<00:04:19.739> hey<00:04:20.310> it<00:04:20.459> makes<00:04:20.669> things<00:04:20.820> more

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
nonetheless hey it makes things more

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.060 
nonetheless hey it makes things more
useful<00:04:21.660> even<00:04:21.900> if<00:04:21.989> it's<00:04:22.080> really<00:04:22.740> kind<00:04:22.919> of<00:04:23.010> weird

00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:23.070 
useful even if it's really kind of weird

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:25.880 
useful even if it's really kind of weird
but<00:04:23.780> all<00:04:24.780> right<00:04:24.930> I<00:04:25.140> guess<00:04:25.410> I<00:04:25.530> will<00:04:25.710> take

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:25.890 
but all right I guess I will take

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:27.140 
but all right I guess I will take
advantage<00:04:26.310> of<00:04:26.460> it

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
advantage of it

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:28.820 
advantage of it
