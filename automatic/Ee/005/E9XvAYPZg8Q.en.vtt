00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
some balls in but then i would say

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.709

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
so then moving on to the right back we

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.010 
so then moving on to the right back we
have<00:00:58.530> informed<00:00:59.160> van<00:00:59.280> der<00:00:59.430> wiel<00:00:59.640> now<00:01:00.329> he<00:01:00.899> is

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
but I went with the 83 version just

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.889 
but I went with the 83 version just
because<00:02:07.079> he<00:02:07.290> has<00:02:07.380> 92<00:02:07.979> defending<00:02:08.759> 84<00:02:09.569> heading

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:09.899 
because he has 92 defending 84 heading

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:12.920 
because he has 92 defending 84 heading

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.110 
better free-kick stats than elm he is
the<00:03:52.470> main<00:03:52.740> free<00:03:53.010> kick<00:03:53.220> taker<00:03:53.430> of<00:03:53.580> the<00:03:53.880> team

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
the main free kick taker of the team

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:56.270 
the main free kick taker of the team
together<00:03:54.570> with<00:03:54.900> her<00:03:55.140> tongue<00:03:55.410> and<00:03:55.470> i<00:03:55.740> think<00:03:56.040> is

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
together with her tongue and i think is

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.030 
together with her tongue and i think is
because<00:03:56.670> of<00:03:56.820> his<00:03:57.120> long<00:03:57.330> shots<00:03:57.660> now<00:03:58.620> snyder

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
because of his long shots now snyder

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.460 
because of his long shots now snyder

the<00:05:17.070> highest<00:05:17.510> shooting<00:05:18.510> stats<00:05:18.810> in<00:05:19.050> the<00:05:19.290> game<00:05:19.620> I

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:20.310 
the highest shooting stats in the game I

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:22.490 
the highest shooting stats in the game I
don't<00:05:20.880> think<00:05:20.970> any<00:05:21.330> player<00:05:21.660> has<00:05:21.870> above<00:05:22.200> that

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 
don't think any player has above that

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:26.120 
don't think any player has above that
and<00:05:23.090> now<00:05:24.090> in<00:05:24.420> Game<00:05:24.450> this<00:05:24.930> also<00:05:25.110> really<00:05:25.860> feels

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.130 
and now in Game this also really feels

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:28.400 
and now in Game this also really feels
like<00:05:26.370> 90<00:05:26.610> for<00:05:26.880> shooting<00:05:27.210> you<00:05:27.540> can<00:05:27.810> shoot<00:05:28.260> from
