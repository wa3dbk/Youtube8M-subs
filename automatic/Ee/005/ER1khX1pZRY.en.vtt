00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:11.990
 today my beautiful hope I find 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:14.450
 very well this time I have these 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:17.510
 delineated that is from a very 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:20.029
 simple to a super complicated 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.590
 that I really like you too but 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:25.099
 remember that it is a matter of practice 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:27.609
 girls so I leave you watching the 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:27.609
 tutorial 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.710
 let's start talking about types of 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:37.250
 delineators this simple humble bisou and 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:40.399
 for its elongated tip is more accurate you 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:43.190
 will leave as very thin and very stuck 

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:47.210
 to the eyelashes the dominated the finished 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:50.180
 It's shiny and it 's long lasting 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:52.489
 the next that in pencil and this is like 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:55.190
 very common to apply it within the line 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:57.290
 of the water since it is very creamy 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.750
 finished is mate and you can also 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:02.410
 get a very good discriminated if it is 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.410
 what you are looking for 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:08.210
 this is the liquid eyeliner and this if 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.549
 it's like to master for those that already 

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.970
 They know how to perfectly delineate because 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:15.860
 minimum detail are notes the finished one is 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.259
 shiny and it's for those who 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.859
 like their makeups remain 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:23.869
 perfect 

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:25.759
 this is my favorite and it's the eyeliner 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:28.219
 in gel this is the level and also what 

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:30.530
 personal this brand I like a lot already 

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:32.719
 which is very creamy and very easy to use 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.719
 This is ideal for those who go 

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:38.509
 starting to really delineate girls 

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:40.759
 with this learn this has a 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:43.490
 Very good durability but it is also 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:46.340
 easy to blur the the finished one is 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:51.549
 I killed myself personally 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.549
 very much for any place 

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.920
 and if you are more daring and you love 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.920
 I draw color eyes invite you to 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:02.350
 you do delineated with color this 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.810
 Visu pencil is very creamy and lasts for 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:08.649
 all day to me personally all 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:11.650
 the visu pencils I love 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:14.349
 and we started with makeup and I for 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:17.439
 do not do so long the video forward that 

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:20.349
 step of the skin but you already know is 

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:23.230
 the same routine as in previous videos 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:25.930
 and we start with the eyes and I'm 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:29.240
 using this first of visu and I'm going 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:31.330
 to apply on both eyelids 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:31.330
 Y 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:37.850
 I will take my brush to blend and this 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.580
 shade in brown of visu and I'll put it 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:43.280
 in my basin I will immediately take this 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.740
 shadow in vanilla tone and with a brush 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.050
 to apply color I'll put it in the 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:51.380
 mobile eyelid I will also place it 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:54.020
 in the bone of the eyebrows to illuminate and 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:58.370
 I will immediately return to my brush for 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:03:01.020
 blur and blur both tones 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:04.110
 I'll start with the first outlined and this 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:07.890
 it's classic as you know I'll start 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:10.890
 with the gel liner I like it 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.780
 much this maybelline and beginning of 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:16.230
 the part in the middle of my eyelids 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:19.410
 outward after only review 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:22.890
 little by little and ended with the part of the 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:27.050
 tear outward always inside 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:29.290
 outward that's my technique 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:31.360
 Y 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:35.020
 Y 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:38.420
 the difference is very noticeable and they open 

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:41.630
 totally the eye only framing it 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:45.290
 I will also add a lipstick that is a 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:48.380
 tone milk is to be more and this is how 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:51.530
 for a very casual everyday look 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:53.930
 very much that if they go to work and this is 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:55.730
 the final result remember that no 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:04:00.380
 I have mascara because I'm missing two 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:02.900
 delineated plus the second proposal is 

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:05.390
 a delineated cat type and this is very 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:07.820
 easy in the direction where it ends 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:11.750
 his eyebrow is where the line will go 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:14.510
 no further down no higher is right in 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:17.900
 the part where it ends happens and this 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:20.120
 we are going to mark little by little and 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:23.030
 that you have half marked your 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:27.760
 line let's aim the with what already 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:27.760
 we did in the upper eyelid part 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:38.970
 and what this type of eyeliner does is 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:41.730
 lengthen the eye make it more almond type 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:43.980
 and it opens up much more if you 

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:46.860
 they have some mistake like there I am 

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:50.400
 pointing with your usual make-up remover 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:53.040
 and a cotonete you wet it a 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:55.560
 little bit and begin to correct the part 

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:58.200
 bottom of the line to where you 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:00.600
 like and it would be perfect remember that no 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:02.760
 we are perfect girls but if you 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:05.420
 they want it to look cleaner this is a 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:08.340
 very good tip 

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:11.460
 for this second outlined I'm 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:14.400
 using max heroine lipstick 

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:17.130
 and if you can put any tone 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:20.240
 since this type of delineation goes with 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:20.240
 anything 

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:29.410
 with the third outlined I'll try to 

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:32.380
 complicate it a bit and do it like 

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:35.970
 more rocker what we're going to try is 

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:39.250
 make a tail but on the opposite side 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:41.710
 being like towards the basin without marking 

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:44.770
 so little by little they will go 

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:46.990
 doing I know it looks complicated is 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:49.450
 complicated because it also cost me 

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:51.970
 a lot of work but remember that if you 

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:54.880
 all of them correct 

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:57.460
 girls so have patience go 

00:05:54.880 --> 00:06:00.280
 doing it little by little until 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:02.620
 the line will be seen as not equal 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:06.460
 but similar to what we are trying 

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:08.620
 to get if they are wrong we go back to 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:11.440
 our usual make-up remover and 

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:15.100
 our cotonete and we make it perfect and 

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:17.500
 there nothing happened afterwards to make sure 

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:18.880
 and that the eyelid is not stained anymore with 

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:23.790
 gel eyeliner 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:23.790
 I'm going to cover it with a liquid eyeliner 

00:06:24.789 --> 00:06:32.259
 place in my money this queen drama of 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:32.259
 be more and only apply a layer 

00:06:33.449 --> 00:06:39.220
 and that's how it is only the 

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:42.790
 black eyeliner you can leave it 

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:46.030
 until this step but I to change you 

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:49.900
 I'm going to add a little eyeliner 

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:53.110
 in color this of visu is tone 06 and it is 

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:56.139
 a beautiful electric blue with the same 

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:58.180
 brush with which delineates my eye I will 

00:06:56.139 --> 00:07:02.310
 do it only by the edges to 

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:04.450
 add an extra brightness 

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:06.860
 yes no 

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:09.650
 on my purple lipstick I will place 

00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:13.000
 this pink southern tone and I'm going to make a 

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:13.000
 hippy tone 

00:07:13.529 --> 00:07:18.869
 and beautiful ribbons this is the look 

00:07:15.749 --> 00:07:21.869
 finished with a single outlined you 

00:07:18.869 --> 00:07:25.099
 You can create three different looks to 

00:07:21.869 --> 00:07:25.099
 you like them 

00:07:26.610 --> 00:07:31.199
