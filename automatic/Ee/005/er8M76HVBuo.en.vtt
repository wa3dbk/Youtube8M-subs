00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.500
 to 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:18.270
 Well, I'm going to show you how you can 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:22.500
 use your tablet or tablet as a 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:27.570
 mini laptop for this we need a 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:32.829
 keyboard like this that comes with a case 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:36.749
 and it has input has usb connector 

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:36.749
 we can see this its connector 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:46.180
 and we are going to use a mouse in this case 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:49.590
 connects via bluetooth 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:51.860
 for this we are going to need this cable 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:54.320
 otegi 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:01:00.260
 It is an adapter that will help us 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:02.890
 connect from the tablet to the keyboard 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:02.890
 all right 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:11.020
 many of these cases are universal and 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:14.580
 adapt to any tablet size 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.580
 let's put it 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:17.820
 in this way 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.530
 I'm going to connect 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:33.969
 I'm going to put it this way I'm going to 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:33.969
 connect the cable or tg 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:42.649
 to the tablet and the keyboard through its 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.649
 usb cable 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.920
 in the adapter or knit 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:53.399
 in this way we already have connected 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.399
 our keyboard 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:59.310
 now 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:01.790
 we proceed to connect the mouse via 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.790
 bluetooth 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.880
 we select bluetooth 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.560
 and let's turn on our mouse 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:20.409
 already lit blue 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:20.409
 I'm going to leave it pressed for a few seconds 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:28.640
 button with bluetooth icon up 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.640
 that the light becomes intermittent 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:46.100
 here it detects us already as connected and already 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.100
 we can see the pointer on the screen 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:55.550
 in this way we can control our 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:59.920
 our tablet with the mouse 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.920
 we can switch between applications 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:07.740
 and if we need to write in some 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:07.740
 writing program 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.750
 we can do it with the keyboard 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:28.030
 Any questions any comment 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.720

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.790
 we can see how the scroll works 

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:52.680

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:07.430
