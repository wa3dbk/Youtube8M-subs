00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:05.210
 in the next video tutorial slopes we will learn 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:08.359
 now create an interpellation 

00:00:08.359 --> 00:00:09.869
 d 

00:00:09.869 --> 00:00:12.649
 movement 

00:00:12.649 --> 00:00:15.340
 he also showed throw to learn 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.720
 apan hidalgo one pole inside another 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.460
 this we also go Jorge 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.460
 with while we develop the 

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:28.179
 we create new document of flanders 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:37.190
 the program automatically has already created the first layer 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.200
 even a button for the loan more layers 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.200
 played for the first one we have 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:48.570
 let's create the interpolation of the movement on the same line the time 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.609
 and I gave Maria the time she also showed it in her program 

00:00:51.609 --> 00:00:54.170
 and we are going to create a symbol 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.110
 shoulders to create a circle 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.250
 I do not see stuffed tea color 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:01.730
 Red 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.730
 and placed it on foot 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.520
 the first frame was injured 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.520
 Igor the second mouse button 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.560
 clicked on the create motion interpolation the first option 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.180
 we click the frame 30 for example 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.830
 We tried, I started 6 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.210
 the inclusion of everything was more key 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.210
 the count country 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.020
 injured orders 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.020
 the frame number 30 costs symbol 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.470
 we can not move 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:52.270
 and with this we would have the movement that we have given a simple moment 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.210
 if we test the movie with control between 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.100
 could move the movement that we have 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.420
 we can enter a limit this 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.719
 why ccoo did not monopolize 

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:11.140
 in his last program 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.609
 efe six 

00:02:13.609 --> 00:02:15.029
 and I put him in this 

00:02:15.029 --> 00:02:16.909
 we had to look here 

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:19.909
 you are no longer worth it 

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:23.899
 control of the timeline 

00:02:26.389 --> 00:02:29.389
 we already have it your promo the internal control movie 

00:02:31.429 --> 00:02:35.189
 we're going to stop at the last frame mockus phenomenon with this 

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:43.889
 we can also nest uu 

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:46.969
 a symbol within another 

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:49.389
 for this we go meccia nar the 

00:02:49.389 --> 00:02:52.769
 in circles of triumph for now for example 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:55.769
 call twice 

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:00.269
 i are inside a symbol of a graphic 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:03.209
 time to layer 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.049
 and in this cup 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:08.049
 what I'm going to do is draw 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:12.569
 a painting can be green to distinguish 

00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:17.619
 and I say it because 

00:03:17.619 --> 00:03:20.619
 monfils 

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:25.809
 and selected the recession the box 

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:30.159
 click on the right button of the mouse 

00:03:30.789 --> 00:03:33.789
 titín have become symbol 

00:03:34.869 --> 00:03:38.679
 asks us what kind of symbol do we want to be Kirby Lula button 

00:03:38.679 --> 00:03:40.549
 circus work 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:42.260
 we think of movie clips 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.260
 rufete or have 

00:03:46.759 --> 00:03:49.759
 and between soraya is a symbol I sunnies blythe movie 

00:03:51.139 --> 00:03:53.219
 we click now on him 

00:03:53.219 --> 00:03:56.219
 twice double click 

00:03:58.039 --> 00:04:00.759
 and we are going to do the same thing that we had done in 

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:02.269
 the tel 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:03.769
 in the fifth team 

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:06.750
 Now we are in time but from the movie kit 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.199
 of him from the box 

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:13.049
 I'm going to brush I think toraman with the second vote 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:16.049
 and create interpol making movement 

00:04:17.379 --> 00:04:20.379
 yara pincho in the number 10 frames for example 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:22.760
 and clicked on 

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.300
 efe six 

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.300
 to insert a keyframe 

00:04:28.219 --> 00:04:31.219
 I was crying I'm going to give a rotation movement 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.229
 select symbol 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:39.609
 selected the free transformation tool in the toolbar 

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:45.419
 i give it a turn 

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:50.669
 let's go for him 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:54.050
 the movement that is going to have 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:57.050
 I will not leave any limit that is reproduced initially 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.319
 I return álava 

00:05:02.319 --> 00:05:05.319
 the main scene 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:08.499
 we see the 

00:05:08.499 --> 00:05:12.349
 the moment we will see what happens that his the moment the movie cne we are not going 

00:05:12.349 --> 00:05:13.289
 to be able to see 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:16.840
 until we can not film so we're going to try the movie with 

00:05:16.839 --> 00:05:19.839
 enter control 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:22.660
 we see the first movement 

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:27.120
 of the circle along with the picture that is that belongs to the league leb 

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.139
 d 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:30.439
 The main idea 

00:05:30.439 --> 00:05:31.349
 bedera 

00:05:31.349 --> 00:05:34.210
 of the serna 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:37.099
 we see that a second movement that is the one of the picture 

00:05:37.099 --> 00:05:39.309
 that belongs to a movie client 

00:05:39.309 --> 00:05:42.349
 this happens because the movie client has his own timeline 

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:46.669
 then another expansion of the best 

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:51.870
 and is that first after this proportion of the main time piety 

00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:53.900
 of the movie 

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:56.790
 and at the same time the timeline is playing 

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:58.379
 from the movie kit 

00:05:58.379 --> 00:06:02.129
 he was first has limit by this continuously reproducing 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:05.060
 and we have set a limit for him 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:08.279
 for the main act he stayed there 

00:06:08.279 --> 00:06:11.749
 and that would be the way 

00:06:11.749 --> 00:06:14.550
 interpolation of movement in symbols
