00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.780 

so<00:00:01.260> we're<00:00:01.380> going<00:00:01.469> to<00:00:01.530> start<00:00:01.770> with<00:00:01.890> a<00:00:01.949> bleed<00:00:02.310> of

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
so we're going to start with a bleed of

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.289 
so we're going to start with a bleed of
our<00:00:03.510> mechanical<00:00:04.319> hydraulic<00:00:04.500> clutch<00:00:05.130> jack

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
our mechanical hydraulic clutch jack

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:08.629 
our mechanical hydraulic clutch jack
so<00:00:07.290> the<00:00:07.500> few<00:00:07.680> things<00:00:07.770> that<00:00:08.010> you'll<00:00:08.280> need<00:00:08.400> to<00:00:08.460> do

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
so the few things that you'll need to do

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.040 
so the few things that you'll need to do
to<00:00:08.790> start<00:00:09.030> with<00:00:09.210> would<00:00:09.360> be<00:00:09.420> to<00:00:09.660> level<00:00:09.960> the

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
to start with would be to level the

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:13.070 
to start with would be to level the
master<00:00:10.410> cylinder<00:00:10.769> and<00:00:10.800> prepare<00:00:11.219> it<00:00:11.370> to<00:00:12.080> start

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
master cylinder and prepare it to start

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.330 
master cylinder and prepare it to start
the<00:00:13.200> bleed<00:00:13.380> process<00:00:13.920> so<00:00:14.849> I'll<00:00:15.830> take<00:00:16.830> an<00:00:17.010> 8

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
the bleed process so I'll take an 8

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.080 
the bleed process so I'll take an 8
millimeter<00:00:18.320> wrench<00:00:19.320> and<00:00:19.590> loosen<00:00:19.619> my<00:00:20.130> master

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
millimeter wrench and loosen my master

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.710 
millimeter wrench and loosen my master
cylinder<00:00:21.449> and<00:00:21.630> level<00:00:21.930> it<00:00:22.050> so<00:00:22.920> I<00:00:22.949> can<00:00:23.510> get<00:00:24.510> in

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
cylinder and level it so I can get in

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.380 
cylinder and level it so I can get in
and<00:00:24.869> out<00:00:25.019> of<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.260> master<00:00:25.619> cylinder<00:00:25.769> without

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:26.390 
and out of the master cylinder without

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:39.170 
and out of the master cylinder without
too<00:00:27.390> much<00:00:27.510> spillage<00:00:27.990> and<00:00:28.109> mess

tubing on the nipple cracking open the
bleed<00:01:44.380> nipple<00:01:44.710> itself<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:46.720> procedure<00:01:47.110> you'll

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
bleed nipple itself the procedure you'll

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.190 
bleed nipple itself the procedure you'll
want<00:01:47.650> to<00:01:47.740> start<00:01:48.130> with<00:01:48.250> is<00:01:48.640> a<00:01:48.670> pull<00:01:49.080> just<00:01:50.080> to

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
want to start with is a pull just to

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.910 
want to start with is a pull just to
remove<00:01:50.440> any<00:01:50.680> air<00:01:51.630> that<00:01:52.630> may<00:01:52.900> be<00:01:52.960> residing<00:01:53.530> in

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
remove any air that may be residing in

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.910 
remove any air that may be residing in
this<00:01:54.130> assembly<00:01:55.090> here<00:01:55.410> you<00:01:56.410> can<00:01:56.530> see<00:01:56.710> the<00:01:56.830> air

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:56.920 
this assembly here you can see the air

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.800 
this assembly here you can see the air
is<00:01:57.070> pulling<00:01:57.400> out<00:01:57.520> now<00:01:57.730> I'm<00:01:58.030> able<00:01:58.210> to<00:01:58.360> just<00:01:58.480> pull

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
is pulling out now I'm able to just pull

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:00.270 
is pulling out now I'm able to just pull
them<00:01:58.900> the<00:01:58.990> syringe<00:01:59.350> and<00:01:59.530> create<00:01:59.860> a<00:01:59.890> little<00:02:00.190> bit

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 
them the syringe and create a little bit

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.450 
them the syringe and create a little bit
of<00:02:00.400> vacuum<00:02:01.020> and<00:02:02.020> pull<00:02:02.290> that<00:02:02.500> air<00:02:02.680> right<00:02:02.950> out<00:02:03.160> I

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
of vacuum and pull that air right out I

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:09.279 
of vacuum and pull that air right out I
have<00:02:04.000> enough<00:02:04.390> fluid<00:02:05.230> in<00:02:05.620> the<00:02:05.830> master<00:02:06.280> cylinder

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.550 

to<00:02:09.829> where<00:02:09.979> I<00:02:10.009> will<00:02:10.250> not<00:02:10.429> suck<00:02:10.759> it<00:02:10.909> dry<00:02:11.140> and<00:02:12.140> as<00:02:12.530> I

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
to where I will not suck it dry and as I

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:19.030 
to where I will not suck it dry and as I
push<00:02:13.510> I'll<00:02:14.510> pull<00:02:14.569> here<00:02:16.390> so<00:02:17.390> as<00:02:17.540> to<00:02:17.840> just<00:02:18.200> adjust

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
push I'll pull here so as to just adjust

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:27.900 
push I'll pull here so as to just adjust
my<00:02:19.430> fluid<00:02:19.819> body

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:27.910 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:31.220 

and<00:02:28.450> I'll<00:02:28.600> go<00:02:28.750> the<00:02:28.870> opposite<00:02:29.200> way<00:02:30.000> pulling

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
and I'll go the opposite way pulling

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:37.480 
and I'll go the opposite way pulling
fluid<00:02:32.230> level<00:02:32.470> drops<00:02:32.770> and<00:02:33.400> I<00:02:33.880> add

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:37.490 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.720 

so<00:02:38.080> it's<00:02:39.080> a<00:02:39.140> easy<00:02:39.260> procedure<00:02:39.590> just<00:02:40.460> takes<00:02:40.640> a

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
so it's a easy procedure just takes a

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.960 
so it's a easy procedure just takes a
little<00:02:40.880> practice

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:49.559 

tighten<00:02:45.970> my<00:02:46.060> fitting

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:49.569 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:54.510 

make<00:02:50.140> sure<00:02:50.319> I'm<00:02:50.409> tight<00:02:51.060> clean<00:02:52.060> up

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:54.520
