00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
is very important about the point system

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:53.890 
is very important about the point system
obvious<00:02:52.760> you<00:02:52.850> get<00:02:52.970> points<00:02:53.300> for<00:02:53.420> every<00:02:53.660> kill

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
and the more stylized to kill the more

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.060 
and the more stylized to kill the more
points<00:02:56.480> you<00:02:56.510> get<00:02:56.750> pretty<00:02:57.500> much<00:02:57.530> everything

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.070 
points you get pretty much everything

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:59.710 
points you get pretty much everything
but<00:02:58.100> a<00:02:58.430> regular<00:02:58.700> kill<00:02:59.120> is<00:02:59.270> worth<00:02:59.450> more<00:02:59.660> points

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
but a regular kill is worth more points

really get a lot of headshot

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:32.229 
really get a lot of headshot
opportunities<00:03:30.980> because<00:03:31.190> the<00:03:31.340> grunts<00:03:31.760> really

00:03:32.229 --> 00:03:32.239 
opportunities because the grunts really

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:35.470 
opportunities because the grunts really
run<00:03:32.540> a<00:03:32.570> lot<00:03:32.840> around<00:03:33.320> a<00:03:33.440> lot<00:03:33.760> run<00:03:34.760> down<00:03:34.940> here<00:03:35.300> on

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
run a lot around a lot run down here on

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.210 
run a lot around a lot run down here on
legendary<00:03:35.989> you'll<00:03:36.170> have<00:03:36.290> a<00:03:36.350> carbine<00:03:36.860> in<00:03:37.100> those

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:37.220 
legendary you'll have a carbine in those

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:38.500 
legendary you'll have a carbine in those
crates<00:03:37.550> and<00:03:37.730> you<00:03:37.790> can<00:03:37.910> just<00:03:38.060> start<00:03:38.209> sniping

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
crates and you can just start sniping

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.670 
crates and you can just start sniping
but<00:03:39.260> this<00:03:39.769> is<00:03:39.950> normal<00:03:40.370> so<00:03:40.489> run<00:03:40.700> down<00:03:40.730> start

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
but this is normal so run down start

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:44.920 
but this is normal so run down start
assassinating<00:03:43.209> the<00:03:44.209> grunt<00:03:44.450> so<00:03:44.630> that's<00:03:44.780> the

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
assassinating the grunt so that's the

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:46.180 
assassinating the grunt so that's the
easiest<00:03:45.110> way<00:03:45.260> to<00:03:45.290> do<00:03:45.440> it<00:03:45.560> and<00:03:45.680> it's<00:03:45.769> worth<00:03:45.950> more

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190 
easiest way to do it and it's worth more

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.300 
easiest way to do it and it's worth more

on<00:03:54.560> a<00:03:54.650> grunt<00:03:55.220> a<00:03:56.290> regular<00:03:57.290> one<00:03:57.410> I<00:03:57.470> think<00:03:57.530> is<00:03:57.709> only

00:03:57.789 --> 00:03:57.799 
on a grunt a regular one I think is only

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:00.610 
on a grunt a regular one I think is only
worth<00:03:58.040> like<00:03:58.340> sixty<00:03:59.120> five<00:03:59.330> or<00:03:59.540> something<00:03:59.690> so

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
worth like sixty five or something so

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:07.309 
worth like sixty five or something so
it's<00:04:00.799> obviously<00:04:01.250> worth<00:04:01.489> a<00:04:01.610> lot<00:04:01.790> more

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:07.319 

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:10.429 

yeah<00:04:08.450> wait<00:04:09.450> until<00:04:09.689> they<00:04:09.780> see<00:04:09.840> you<00:04:10.110> very<00:04:10.230> much

00:04:10.429 --> 00:04:10.439

00:04:14.149 --> 00:04:14.159 
to take out the ones that are round you

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:15.380 
to take out the ones that are round you
and<00:04:14.400> then<00:04:14.489> you're<00:04:14.609> gonna<00:04:14.700> want<00:04:14.939> to<00:04:15.000> come<00:04:15.239> up

and then you're gonna want to come up
the<00:04:15.569> left<00:04:16.459> the<00:04:17.459> Spiker<00:04:17.759> I<00:04:18.150> find<00:04:18.479> is<00:04:18.630> really

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:19.139 
the left the Spiker I find is really

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:23.120 
the left the Spiker I find is really
good<00:04:19.289> against<00:04:19.590> the<00:04:19.680> brutes<00:04:19.949> on<00:04:21.199> normal<00:04:22.199> you

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
good against the brutes on normal you

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.310 
good against the brutes on normal you
can<00:04:23.280> kill<00:04:23.580> them<00:04:23.789> with<00:04:23.910> a<00:04:23.940> one<00:04:24.210> clip<00:04:24.600> but<00:04:25.289> I

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
can kill them with a one clip but I

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.080 
can kill them with a one clip but I
prefer<00:04:25.680> actually<00:04:26.009> to<00:04:26.130> use<00:04:26.220> it<00:04:26.370> to<00:04:26.520> stun<00:04:26.880> them

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
prefer actually to use it to stun them

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.230 
prefer actually to use it to stun them
like<00:04:27.389> here<00:04:27.900> I<00:04:28.530> use<00:04:29.190> it<00:04:29.370> to<00:04:29.490> stun<00:04:29.729> him<00:04:29.910> for<00:04:30.030> a<00:04:30.090> few

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:30.240 
like here I use it to stun him for a few

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.420 
like here I use it to stun him for a few
seconds<00:04:30.660> melee<00:04:31.110> and<00:04:31.259> then<00:04:31.410> stick<00:04:31.770> sticks<00:04:32.160> are

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
seconds melee and then stick sticks are

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:34.460 
seconds melee and then stick sticks are
worth<00:04:33.000> a<00:04:33.120> good<00:04:33.270> amount<00:04:33.509> headshots<00:04:34.139> are<00:04:34.289> worth

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
worth a good amount headshots are worth

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.270 
worth a good amount headshots are worth
good<00:04:34.770> amounts<00:04:35.570> assassinations<00:04:37.280> killing

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
good amounts assassinations killing

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.650 
good amounts assassinations killing
someone<00:04:38.490> with<00:04:38.520> the<00:04:38.669> needler<00:04:39.000> is<00:04:39.240> worth<00:04:39.479> the

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:39.660 
someone with the needler is worth the

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:42.100 
someone with the needler is worth the
same<00:04:39.870> as<00:04:40.080> killing<00:04:40.289> them<00:04:40.590> by<00:04:41.190> sticking<00:04:41.550> them

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
same as killing them by sticking them

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.710
