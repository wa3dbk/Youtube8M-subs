00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.029
 Hello, our today's review 

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:08.750
 will be devoted to the shell from 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:11.589
 Chinese according to h 3 st 30 h 

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:13.480
 as you see it is made in style 

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.489
 pindos 

00:00:15.489 --> 00:00:18.489
 that is, no district is used more correctly 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.189
 she tries to be like him 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:23.909
 let's imagine the desktops to 

00:00:23.909 --> 00:00:26.419
 we could get acquainted briefly 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:29.499
 here is the tab listened but always ingots 140 with 

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:30.130
 lunch 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:32.410
 the translation itself should not be 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:34.540
 what contribution to them 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:35.690
 coffee with 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:37.910
 there is a process 

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.410
 in fact this is an ordinary worker became 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.200
 im just icons made in such 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.589
 here 

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:46.860
 tiled design 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.970
 application menu too 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:52.970
 no cheek away 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:56.670
 widgets 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.290
 here are such shields and there is of course and and seeing 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:00.900
 loan when there is the usual 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.800
 and in my opinion there is a major 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.050
 shell failure 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.060
 while you are using beautiful 4 4 all 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.439
 healthy wonderful 

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:11.100
 but as soon as you bet 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.590
 Kokoyty ordinary and Chita 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.590
 all charms otherwise the case right away 

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.390
 appearance of juventus in general 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.710
 immediately lost 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:29.000
 but as you see 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.670
 here it is 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.190
 wireless setup panel 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.190
 she says she doesn't fit 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:38.760
 and 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.740
 lives here because he himself is the same 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.770
 if you wish you can use 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.810
 shell 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.759
 which put the manufacturer 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.759
 take advantage of the balanchine side 

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:54.180
 for example since locust 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.420
 as you see here a little bit 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.270
 slows down 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:00.270
 but in general, work is tolerable enough 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.790
 so now about the settings 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:11.650
 here use create four on 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:12.519
 four 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:14.869
 Upgrade to 4 1 is planned 

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:17.299
 I'll say these even more now 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:19.629
 stressed that 4 and 1 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:23.199
 it is still no fifth in the metro interfaces 

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:26.009
 clean mandrogi so if you 

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:28.429
 all this rampage tiles don't like that 

00:02:28.429 --> 00:02:30.599
 you can always install clean 

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:32.329
 bug in pure android 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:34.599
 by the way I liked it much 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:35.109
 more 

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:37.449
 Well, of course you still need to consider 

00:02:37.449 --> 00:02:40.449
 she worked scratching 3 

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:44.199
 I dedicated to individual human shell 

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:45.619
 since he 

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:47.969
 video review of the tablet itself I will 

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:49.199
 use exactly 

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:51.349
 net profit of 4 1 to show you 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:53.419
 interface speed 

00:02:53.419 --> 00:02:55.289
 but at the same time it was impossible 

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:56.799
 not to mention such an interesting 

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:59.249
 Chinese manufacturer's solution 

00:02:59.249 --> 00:03:01.329
 I personally like this risk is not very 

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:02.239
 liked 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:05.239
 but it is clear that this is all about lovers and 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:10.229
 maybe you 

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:11.689
 then you will like 

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:12.430
 all is well
