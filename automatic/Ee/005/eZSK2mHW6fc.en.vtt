00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:08.910
 the polar temperatures of recent days is problematic as much in 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.490
 the man that his car of course you have to think the worst he sees to the good 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.760
 functioning of the lights but there is not an element that it is better not to 

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.119
 to forget 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:18.010
 drums 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:22.080
 because without it the problems will arise from the start link the teams 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.140
 intervention of the automobile club intervened more than 200 times 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.689
 most of the time for a battery problem 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:32.450
 but how to explain this greater weakness of the battery in winter than the 

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:33.380
 rest of the year 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.480
 the power of the battery 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.340
 decrease with the cold 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.930
 and that can result in the car not starting that match 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.510
 the car batteries work as a battery that recharges at 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.570
 through an external power source 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.070
 two electrodes dipped in an electronic solution that make up 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.050
 the accumulator 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.060
 even if it sounds a little complicated the principle is simple 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.370
 the battery provides power to the entire car 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.879
 whether it's the state radio 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:05.960
 the dsi of the fed so on 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.010
 it recharges when you ride 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.920
 there are ways to make sure your car will start in the morning and 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.070
 that it will not stop it has no way along the way 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:16.770
 to protect himself 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.110
 of cold the best things would be for the car during the night in 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:22.260
 a garage 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:25.590
 n 10 if for example we can not do it 

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.170
 it would be better to control it afld 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.900
 green caramanlis but the battery is not the only problem that for 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.730
 meet the car in isere 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:37.820
 other elements must be taken into account what is important 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.350
 is to see that these tactical interviews that is to say it is necessary 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.110
 control the ctc control the brakes 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:50.110
 which is important for example on a slippery road the dampers the 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.110
 engine antifreeze all that is in celebration 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.820
 capital on the car in the center come stickers and clp for 100 euros 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.760
 in fact long tests 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.480
 we propose to bring back my prono members 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.790
 for those who understand years in fact the whole car 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.700
 then with a little good will it is possible to pass libera 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.120
 car no doubt the efficiency
