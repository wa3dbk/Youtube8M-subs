 So useful and practical series that has launched

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:17.780
 cufflinks in today's video I'm going to 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:17.780
 teach how to train pecs we start 

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:23.820
 a series of training that you can 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.920
 put into practice without fear of 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.080
 Stagnation in habitual growth 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.300
 from 14 years old because it hardly requires 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.460
 What we are going to achieve is that you 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.559
 familiarize yourself with the exercises you 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.630
 you get used to them and you go conforming your 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.000
 body to the weights if it has never arisen 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.250

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.710

 basic and accessible to anyone by 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.410
 when we started from very young 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.360
 we just have economic resources and 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.789
 so much it costs us to access those resources 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.039
 materials so it will only take 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.110
 some dumbbells and in this case a bank 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.150
