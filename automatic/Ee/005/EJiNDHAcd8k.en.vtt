have been very easy for Santa to make
another<00:02:03.680> commercial<00:02:03.979> film<00:02:04.340> but<00:02:04.850> he's<00:02:04.939> gone

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
another commercial film but he's gone

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.760 
another commercial film but he's gone
and<00:02:05.150> taken<00:02:05.510> and<00:02:05.780> strangely<00:02:06.260> none<00:02:06.439> of<00:02:06.560> the

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
and taken and strangely none of the

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.559 
and taken and strangely none of the
others<00:02:07.130> I<00:02:07.220> really<00:02:07.460> worked<00:02:07.760> commercially<00:02:08.269> also

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 
others I really worked commercially also

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:10.330 
others I really worked commercially also
the<00:02:08.959> older<00:02:09.200> ones<00:02:09.379> if<00:02:09.560> 10<00:02:09.769> of<00:02:09.799> them<00:02:10.069> made<00:02:10.220> in

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
the older ones if 10 of them made in

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.569 
the older ones if 10 of them made in
different<00:02:10.429> languages<00:02:10.970> so<00:02:11.720> it's<00:02:11.870> it's<00:02:12.080> quite<00:02:12.230> a

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:13.579 
different languages so it's it's quite a

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:16.630 
different languages so it's it's quite a
big<00:02:14.390> risk<00:02:14.720> to<00:02:14.959> take<00:02:14.989> but<00:02:15.379> then<00:02:15.500> I<00:02:15.769> guess<00:02:16.519> the

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
big risk to take but then I guess the

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.160 
big risk to take but then I guess the
bigger<00:02:16.819> the<00:02:16.970> better<00:02:17.090> and<00:02:17.329> finally<00:02:17.540> infinity

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:18.170 
bigger the better and finally infinity

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.350 
bigger the better and finally infinity
as<00:02:18.260> it<00:02:18.409> feels<00:02:18.620> more<00:02:18.890> 10<00:02:19.459> tiny<00:02:19.730> okay<00:02:20.000> there<00:02:20.239> is

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
as it feels more 10 tiny okay there is

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.850 
as it feels more 10 tiny okay there is
gonna<00:02:20.540> be<00:02:20.720> one<00:02:20.870> of<00:02:20.930> the<00:02:21.049> biggest<00:02:21.260> achievements

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
gonna be one of the biggest achievements

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.670 
gonna be one of the biggest achievements
it<00:02:22.670> would<00:02:22.819> be<00:02:22.939> nice<00:02:23.090> if<00:02:23.269> people<00:02:23.299> liked<00:02:23.659> it

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:24.680 
it would be nice if people liked it

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.350 
it would be nice if people liked it

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:31.609 
should appreciate the hard work gone

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:33.009 
should appreciate the hard work gone
until<00:02:31.909> it's<00:02:31.970> been<00:02:32.150> a<00:02:32.209> difficult<00:02:32.390> film<00:02:32.750> to<00:02:32.900> make

00:02:33.009 --> 00:02:33.019 
until it's been a difficult film to make

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:37.569 
until it's been a difficult film to make
it's<00:02:33.470> a<00:02:33.560> difficult<00:02:33.950> role<00:02:34.099> and<00:02:34.280> so<00:02:35.140> I<00:02:36.489> did<00:02:37.489> the

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:37.579 
it's a difficult role and so I did the

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:39.309 
it's a difficult role and so I did the
novel<00:02:37.939> I'd<00:02:38.120> seen<00:02:38.359> the<00:02:38.480> film<00:02:38.720> about<00:02:38.870> ten<00:02:39.170> years

00:02:39.309 --> 00:02:39.319 
novel I'd seen the film about ten years

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:41.259 
novel I'd seen the film about ten years
ago<00:02:39.439> so<00:02:40.040> I<00:02:40.069> didn't<00:02:40.310> see<00:02:40.430> the<00:02:40.549> film<00:02:40.640> again<00:02:40.909> I<00:02:41.090> saw

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:41.269 
ago so I didn't see the film again I saw

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:42.670 
ago so I didn't see the film again I saw
it<00:02:41.359> once<00:02:41.599> again<00:02:41.900> after<00:02:42.200> I<00:02:42.290> finished<00:02:42.590> shooting

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
it once again after I finished shooting

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.220 
it once again after I finished shooting
this<00:02:42.950> film<00:02:43.099> because<00:02:43.549> obviously<00:02:44.019> when<00:02:45.019> you<00:02:45.079> see

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
this film because obviously when you see

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.229 
this film because obviously when you see
someone<00:02:45.530> like<00:02:45.560> the<00:02:45.739> lipcolor<00:02:45.889> perform<00:02:46.459> it's

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
someone like the lipcolor perform it's

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:49.210 
someone like the lipcolor perform it's
very<00:02:47.750> difficult<00:02:48.139> for<00:02:48.290> lesser<00:02:48.500> mortals<00:02:48.889> not<00:02:49.099> to

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
very difficult for lesser mortals not to

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:50.440 
very difficult for lesser mortals not to
be<00:02:49.310> impressed<00:02:49.579> upon<00:02:49.700> by<00:02:50.000> what<00:02:50.120> he's<00:02:50.269> done

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
be impressed upon by what he's done

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.210 
be impressed upon by what he's done
indeed<00:02:50.989> so<00:02:51.379> I<00:02:51.680> didn't<00:02:51.859> want<00:02:51.980> to<00:02:52.040> take<00:02:52.159> the

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
indeed so I didn't want to take the

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.530 
indeed so I didn't want to take the
chance<00:02:52.519> it<00:02:52.670> would<00:02:52.760> have<00:02:52.909> been<00:02:53.030> impossible<00:02:53.269> for

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
chance it would have been impossible for

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.059 
chance it would have been impossible for
me<00:02:53.810> to<00:02:53.840> do<00:02:54.079> a<00:02:54.109> scene<00:02:54.379> differently<00:02:54.889> after

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:55.069 
me to do a scene differently after

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:56.530 
me to do a scene differently after
having<00:02:55.459> seen<00:02:55.609> Phillip<00:02:55.879> subdue<00:02:56.150> it<00:02:56.239> well<00:02:56.420> so

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
having seen Phillip subdue it well so

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.149 
having seen Phillip subdue it well so
you<00:02:56.629> didn't<00:02:56.900> see<00:02:57.019> it<00:02:57.139> I<00:02:57.470> didn't<00:02:57.650> see<00:02:57.680> it<00:02:58.010> I

00:02:58.149 --> 00:02:58.159 
you didn't see it I didn't see it I

00:02:58.159 --> 00:03:01.149 
you didn't see it I didn't see it I
didn't<00:02:58.400> see<00:02:58.430> it<00:02:59.470> not<00:03:00.470> differently<00:03:00.889> at<00:03:00.980> least<00:03:01.129> I

00:03:01.149 --> 00:03:01.159 
didn't see it not differently at least I

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:03.039 
didn't see it not differently at least I
didn't<00:03:01.340> want<00:03:01.459> to<00:03:01.579> you<00:03:01.909> know<00:03:01.970> just<00:03:02.269> make<00:03:02.930> it

00:03:03.039 --> 00:03:03.049 
didn't want to you know just make it

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:04.390 
didn't want to you know just make it
exactly<00:03:03.409> the<00:03:03.590> way<00:03:03.709> it<00:03:03.769> was<00:03:03.829> and<00:03:04.129> it<00:03:04.220> would<00:03:04.340> have

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
exactly the way it was and it would have

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.830 
exactly the way it was and it would have
been<00:03:04.459> impossible<00:03:04.670> for<00:03:05.150> me<00:03:05.239> to<00:03:05.269> keep<00:03:05.480> it<00:03:05.599> here

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
been impossible for me to keep it here

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.410 
been impossible for me to keep it here
so<00:03:06.620> I<00:03:06.680> did<00:03:06.829> the<00:03:06.950> book<00:03:07.159> I<00:03:07.489> had<00:03:07.970> my<00:03:08.090> own<00:03:08.209> day

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:08.420 
so I did the book I had my own day

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.030 
so I did the book I had my own day
because<00:03:08.689> I'm<00:03:08.810> from<00:03:09.079> this<00:03:09.200> era<00:03:09.409> so<00:03:09.680> my

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
because I'm from this era so my

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.470 
because I'm from this era so my
interpretation<00:03:10.670> of<00:03:10.730> the<00:03:10.849> novel<00:03:11.120> is<00:03:11.209> a<00:03:11.239> little

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
interpretation of the novel is a little

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.449 
interpretation of the novel is a little
different<00:03:11.780> as<00:03:11.989> a<00:03:12.049> character<00:03:12.560> yeah<00:03:13.040> I've<00:03:13.280> tried

00:03:13.449 --> 00:03:13.459 
different as a character yeah I've tried

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:17.289 
different as a character yeah I've tried
to<00:03:13.700> put<00:03:13.849> that<00:03:14.030> in<00:03:14.209> and<00:03:15.879> in<00:03:16.879> the<00:03:17.000> storyline

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:17.299 
to put that in and in the storyline

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:20.439 
to put that in and in the storyline
itself<00:03:18.549> inside<00:03:19.549> there's<00:03:19.730> always<00:03:19.849> some<00:03:20.180> input

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:20.449 
itself inside there's always some input

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:21.909 
itself inside there's always some input
of<00:03:20.569> the<00:03:20.690> actor<00:03:20.989> because<00:03:21.260> you<00:03:21.500> know<00:03:21.590> normally

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:21.919

00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:38.629 
the storyline you can't change the

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:40.119 
the storyline you can't change the
storyline<00:03:38.989> it's<00:03:39.139> it's<00:03:39.349> a<00:03:39.440> classical<00:03:39.799> novel

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:42.369 
storyline it's it's a classical novel
you<00:03:40.190> can't<00:03:40.400> change<00:03:40.579> it<00:03:40.760> but<00:03:41.359> Sanjay<00:03:42.049> did<00:03:42.199> allow

00:03:42.369 --> 00:03:42.379 
you can't change it but Sanjay did allow

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:44.439 
you can't change it but Sanjay did allow
me<00:03:42.409> to<00:03:42.709> let<00:03:43.220> my<00:03:43.430> interpretation<00:03:44.000> of<00:03:44.060> the<00:03:44.209> itas

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:44.449 
me to let my interpretation of the itas

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:45.789 
me to let my interpretation of the itas
be<00:03:44.720> there<00:03:44.959> intermingled<00:03:45.530> with<00:03:45.560> his

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:45.799 
be there intermingled with his

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:47.830 
be there intermingled with his
interpretation<00:03:46.370> of<00:03:46.459> the<00:03:46.519> others<00:03:46.819> so<00:03:47.629> it's<00:03:47.750> a

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
interpretation of the others so it's a

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.210 
interpretation of the others so it's a
good<00:03:48.019> mix<00:03:48.229> and<00:03:50.049> then<00:03:51.049> no<00:03:51.590> research<00:03:51.859> except

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
good mix and then no research except

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.339 
good mix and then no research except
that<00:03:52.310> I<00:03:52.540> actually<00:03:53.540> drank<00:03:53.750> for<00:03:53.959> the<00:03:54.049> film<00:03:54.229> and

00:03:54.339 --> 00:03:54.349 
that I actually drank for the film and

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:56.530 
that I actually drank for the film and
normally<00:03:54.620> I<00:03:54.709> don't<00:03:54.919> drink<00:03:55.099> it's<00:03:56.090> a<00:03:56.239> bad<00:03:56.389> thing

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
normally I don't drink it's a bad thing

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.119 
normally I don't drink it's a bad thing
to<00:03:56.690> do<00:03:56.810> but<00:03:56.989> it's<00:03:57.169> a<00:03:57.290> very<00:03:57.530> difficult<00:03:57.769> role

00:03:58.119 --> 00:03:58.129 
to do but it's a very difficult role

00:03:58.129 --> 00:04:01.059 
to do but it's a very difficult role
you've<00:03:58.310> played<00:03:58.340> in<00:03:58.699> it<00:03:59.019> so<00:04:00.019> I<00:04:00.349> mean<00:04:00.709> did<00:04:00.979> you

00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:01.069 
you've played in it so I mean did you

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:02.860 
you've played in it so I mean did you
find<00:04:01.340> it<00:04:01.459> very<00:04:01.489> difficult<00:04:01.790> to<00:04:02.209> relate<00:04:02.510> to<00:04:02.690> that

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
find it very difficult to relate to that

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:04.780 
find it very difficult to relate to that
role<00:04:03.079> and<00:04:03.379> were<00:04:03.769> you<00:04:03.889> able<00:04:04.040> to<00:04:04.190> come<00:04:04.400> out<00:04:04.519> of<00:04:04.549> it

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 
role and were you able to come out of it

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:07.960 
role and were you able to come out of it
quickly<00:04:05.569> after<00:04:05.959> the<00:04:06.049> after<00:04:06.379> the<00:04:06.440> movie<00:04:06.970> yeah

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:07.970 
quickly after the after the movie yeah

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:09.250 
quickly after the after the movie yeah
it<00:04:08.030> is<00:04:08.150> difficult<00:04:08.510> to<00:04:08.629> relate<00:04:08.810> to<00:04:08.870> a<00:04:08.989> role<00:04:09.139> like

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
it is difficult to relate to a role like

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.939 
it is difficult to relate to a role like
that<00:04:09.549> because<00:04:10.549> it's<00:04:10.699> something<00:04:11.030> that<00:04:11.329> very

00:04:11.939 --> 00:04:11.949 
that because it's something that very

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:15.580 
that because it's something that very
very<00:04:12.949> few<00:04:13.329> evolved<00:04:14.329> souls<00:04:14.599> can<00:04:14.870> be<00:04:15.019> like<00:04:15.229> you

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
very few evolved souls can be like you

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:16.960 
very few evolved souls can be like you
know<00:04:15.680> they've<00:04:15.829> doesn't<00:04:16.220> evolve<00:04:16.430> so<00:04:16.699> there's<00:04:16.909> a

I mean I I think I didn't feel that I
have<00:05:33.380> to<00:05:33.470> break<00:05:33.620> off<00:05:34.120> but<00:05:35.120> and<00:05:35.690> right<00:05:35.900> now<00:05:36.080> also

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:36.350

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:38.300 
I don't feel that I've broken off but

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:39.550 
I don't feel that I've broken off but
neither<00:05:38.510> does<00:05:38.750> it<00:05:38.840> feel<00:05:39.020> that<00:05:39.169> I'm<00:05:39.260> completely

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:39.560

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:43.150 
neither does it feel that I'm completely
involved<00:05:39.979> inside<00:05:40.340> or<00:05:40.610> I've<00:05:41.590> hit<00:05:42.590> the<00:05:42.740> bottle<00:05:42.979> I

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:43.160

don't do either other things but I guess

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:48.460 
don't do either other things but I guess
it<00:05:46.070> just<00:05:46.099> made<00:05:46.820> me<00:05:47.000> take<00:05:47.210> a<00:05:47.240> break<00:05:47.479> also<00:05:47.900> which
