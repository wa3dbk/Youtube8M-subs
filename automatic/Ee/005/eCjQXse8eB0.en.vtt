00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:18.890 
one it was prints you can make a bunch
of<00:00:17.460> them<00:00:17.580> just<00:00:17.609> kind<00:00:17.940> of<00:00:18.000> like<00:00:18.119> a<00:00:18.150> stamp<00:00:18.539> we<00:00:18.840> are

we Amy is helping me today we're going
to<00:00:45.360> show<00:00:45.480> you<00:00:45.570> how<00:00:45.690> to<00:00:45.750> make<00:00:45.960> Styrofoam<00:00:46.559> prints

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
to show you how to make Styrofoam prints

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.160 
to show you how to make Styrofoam prints
so<00:00:47.399> it's<00:00:47.520> a<00:00:47.550> great<00:00:47.760> way<00:00:47.940> to<00:00:47.969> reuse<00:00:48.539> and<00:00:49.020> recycle

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
so it's a great way to reuse and recycle

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.889 
so it's a great way to reuse and recycle
these<00:00:49.950> to<00:00:50.370> go<00:00:50.460> boxes<00:00:50.910> you<00:00:51.059> might<00:00:51.239> get<00:00:51.510> or<00:00:51.840> you

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
these to go boxes you might get or you

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.510 
these to go boxes you might get or you
can<00:00:52.289> use<00:00:52.410> styrofoam<00:00:52.620> plates<00:00:53.129> if<00:00:53.280> you<00:00:53.399> have

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
can use styrofoam plates if you have

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.650 
can use styrofoam plates if you have
those<00:00:53.699> at<00:00:53.850> your<00:00:53.879> house<00:00:54.090> as<00:00:54.270> well

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
those at your house as well

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.299 
those at your house as well
so<00:00:54.930> anything<00:00:55.170> that<00:00:55.350> styrofoam<00:00:55.680> is<00:00:56.129> going<00:00:56.250> to

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
so anything that styrofoam is going to

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.310 
so anything that styrofoam is going to
work<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:57.000> what<00:00:57.090> you<00:00:57.180> want<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.420> do<00:00:57.539> is<00:00:57.870> just<00:00:58.109> cut

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
work and what you want to do is just cut

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.630 
work and what you want to do is just cut
out<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.500> flat<00:00:58.859> part<00:00:59.129> of<00:00:59.219> it<00:00:59.309> so<00:00:59.430> it's<00:00:59.550> the

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
out the flat part of it so it's the

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.389 
out the flat part of it so it's the
plate<00:00:59.879> cut<00:01:00.120> out<00:01:00.239> the<00:01:00.359> middle<00:01:00.570> part<00:01:00.920> no<00:01:01.920> need<00:01:02.280> to

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
plate cut out the middle part no need to

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.310 
plate cut out the middle part no need to
be<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.520> perfectionist<00:01:03.120> here<00:01:03.329> so<00:01:03.809> once<00:01:04.019> you<00:01:04.140> cut

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
be a perfectionist here so once you cut

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.719 
be a perfectionist here so once you cut
out<00:01:04.439> whatever<00:01:04.769> shape<00:01:05.100> whatever<00:01:05.400> you're<00:01:05.700> using

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
out whatever shape whatever you're using

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.789 
out whatever shape whatever you're using
these<00:01:06.420> are<00:01:06.630> what<00:01:06.780> we're<00:01:06.900> going<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.049> draw<00:01:07.380> into

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
these are what we're going to draw into

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:08.929 
these are what we're going to draw into
and<00:01:08.010> then<00:01:08.100> we're<00:01:08.189> going<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.340> use<00:01:08.400> those<00:01:08.700> like<00:01:08.909> a

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
and then we're going to use those like a

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.730 
and then we're going to use those like a
stamp<00:01:09.360> we're<00:01:09.600> at<00:01:09.689> a<00:01:09.750> print<00:01:09.960> on<00:01:10.049> paper<00:01:10.229> so

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
stamp we're at a print on paper so

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:11.929 
stamp we're at a print on paper so
there's<00:01:10.950> a<00:01:11.040> lot<00:01:11.189> of<00:01:11.280> different<00:01:11.580> types<00:01:11.760> of

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
there's a lot of different types of

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.969 
there's a lot of different types of
prints<00:01:12.390> that<00:01:12.570> you<00:01:12.720> can<00:01:12.900> make<00:01:13.080> those<00:01:13.290> in<00:01:13.470> Taleo

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
prints that you can make those in Taleo

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.160 
prints that you can make those in Taleo
which<00:01:14.250> uses<00:01:14.610> copper<00:01:14.820> plates<00:01:15.299> there's

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
which uses copper plates there's

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.679 
which uses copper plates there's
lithography<00:01:16.860> that<00:01:17.070> uses<00:01:17.369> stones<00:01:17.700> or<00:01:18.150> aluminum

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
lithography that uses stones or aluminum

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.749 
lithography that uses stones or aluminum
sheets<00:01:19.200> but<00:01:19.860> today<00:01:20.100> we're<00:01:20.310> going<00:01:20.400> to<00:01:20.490> use<00:01:20.610> the

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
sheets but today we're going to use the

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.660 
sheets but today we're going to use the
classic<00:01:21.150> styrofoam<00:01:21.990> before<00:01:22.500> I<00:01:22.890> would<00:01:23.340> do<00:01:23.490> some

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
classic styrofoam before I would do some

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.190 
classic styrofoam before I would do some

and I'm just gonna reschedule here some
what<00:01:36.630> this<00:01:36.780> is<00:01:36.930> gonna<00:01:37.110> do<00:01:37.380> is<00:01:37.920> it's<00:01:38.009> gonna

what this is gonna do is it's gonna
press<00:01:38.700> it<00:01:38.729> into<00:01:39.060> the<00:01:39.150> styrofoam<00:01:39.420> and<00:01:39.659> I'm

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
press it into the styrofoam and I'm

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.510 
press it into the styrofoam and I'm
using<00:01:40.140> a<00:01:40.200> pen<00:01:40.409> you<00:01:40.560> can<00:01:40.590> use<00:01:40.829> a<00:01:40.860> pencil<00:01:41.369> just

something that's gonna press it down and
leave<00:01:43.560> an<00:01:43.710> indent<00:01:44.070> because<00:01:44.460> wherever<00:01:44.640> its

put paint all over this and you don't

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.120 
put paint all over this and you don't
have<00:01:48.990> to<00:01:49.110> do<00:01:49.229> a<00:01:49.259> shape<00:01:49.530> drawing<00:01:49.740> you<00:01:49.860> can<00:01:50.009> do

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
have to do a shape drawing you can do

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.530 
have to do a shape drawing you can do
you<00:01:50.280> know<00:01:50.399> just<00:01:50.640> a<00:01:50.729> drawing<00:01:51.000> of<00:01:51.119> anything

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
you know just a drawing of anything

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.969 
you know just a drawing of anything
really<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.990> only<00:01:52.200> thing<00:01:52.380> is<00:01:52.530> if<00:01:52.740> you<00:01:52.950> use

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
really the only thing is if you use

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.069 
really the only thing is if you use
words<00:01:53.490> you<00:01:54.090> need<00:01:54.240> to<00:01:54.329> make<00:01:54.509> sure<00:01:54.540> you<00:01:54.899> write

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
them backwards because this is gonna

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.160 
them backwards because this is gonna
print<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.060> opposite<00:01:57.420> way<00:01:57.509> they'll<00:01:57.810> miss

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
print the opposite way they'll miss

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:04.010 
print the opposite way they'll miss
Stars<00:01:58.680> and<00:01:59.070> upside<00:01:59.670> down<00:01:59.850> aughter<00:02:02.869> so<00:02:03.869> here's

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
Stars and upside down aughter so here's

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.980 
Stars and upside down aughter so here's
my<00:02:04.140> print<00:02:04.579> so<00:02:05.579> once<00:02:05.759> you<00:02:05.939> have<00:02:06.030> drawn<00:02:06.360> whatever

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
my print so once you have drawn whatever

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.419 
my print so once you have drawn whatever
you<00:02:07.110> want<00:02:07.290> to<00:02:07.350> draw<00:02:07.500> it<00:02:07.560> on<00:02:07.799> a<00:02:07.829> Styrofoam<00:02:08.160> plate

you want to draw it on a Styrofoam plate
get<00:02:08.700> a<00:02:08.729> plate<00:02:09.090> and<00:02:09.420> this<00:02:09.840> is<00:02:09.899> called<00:02:10.229> a<00:02:10.349> brayer

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
get a plate and this is called a brayer

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.710 
get a plate and this is called a brayer
you<00:02:11.099> can<00:02:11.250> buy<00:02:11.370> these<00:02:11.430> at<00:02:11.550> craft<00:02:11.940> stores<00:02:12.330> you

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
you can buy these at craft stores you

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.059 
you can buy these at craft stores you
can

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
can

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:15.280 
can
try<00:02:13.280> to<00:02:13.340> use<00:02:13.489> a<00:02:13.640> foam<00:02:14.209> paintbrush<00:02:14.840> to<00:02:15.049> do<00:02:15.170> this

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
try to use a foam paintbrush to do this

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:16.899 
try to use a foam paintbrush to do this
the<00:02:15.499> only<00:02:15.620> problem<00:02:16.099> is<00:02:16.249> you<00:02:16.370> don't<00:02:16.519> want<00:02:16.730> any

00:02:16.899 --> 00:02:16.909 
the only problem is you don't want any

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:19.270 
the only problem is you don't want any
paint<00:02:17.180> to<00:02:17.329> get<00:02:17.480> in<00:02:17.599> these<00:02:17.780> dips<00:02:18.499> or<00:02:18.980> else<00:02:19.099> it's

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:19.280 
paint to get in these dips or else it's

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.339 
paint to get in these dips or else it's
not<00:02:19.340> gonna<00:02:19.609> stay<00:02:19.939> white<00:02:20.150> so<00:02:20.900> that's<00:02:21.079> why<00:02:21.290> these

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:21.349 
not gonna stay white so that's why these

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:23.229 
not gonna stay white so that's why these
work<00:02:21.799> really<00:02:21.829> well<00:02:22.310> but<00:02:22.519> you<00:02:22.579> can<00:02:22.790> also<00:02:22.939> get<00:02:23.209> a

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:23.239 
work really well but you can also get a

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:24.789 
work really well but you can also get a
foam<00:02:23.450> brush<00:02:23.599> and<00:02:23.840> just<00:02:23.900> lightly<00:02:24.019> go<00:02:24.560> over<00:02:24.739> it

00:02:24.789 --> 00:02:24.799 
foam brush and just lightly go over it

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:26.199 
foam brush and just lightly go over it
like<00:02:24.980> this<00:02:25.189> but<00:02:25.430> I<00:02:25.579> would<00:02:25.760> definitely

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
like this but I would definitely

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:28.119 
like this but I would definitely
recommend<00:02:26.329> one<00:02:26.749> of<00:02:26.780> these<00:02:27.079> get<00:02:27.769> your<00:02:27.889> paint

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:28.129 
recommend one of these get your paint

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:31.209 
recommend one of these get your paint
and<00:02:28.489> use<00:02:28.939> acrylic<00:02:29.540> paint<00:02:29.780> in<00:02:30.230> a<00:02:30.319> roll<00:02:30.620> up<00:02:31.010> your

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:31.219 
and use acrylic paint in a roll up your

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:33.490 
and use acrylic paint in a roll up your
brayer<00:02:31.489> like<00:02:31.849> this<00:02:32.120> it's<00:02:32.659> called<00:02:32.810> rolling<00:02:33.349> up

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
brayer like this it's called rolling up

is you can use two colors I'll show you
in<00:02:39.500> the<00:02:39.620> next<00:02:39.859> tutorial<00:02:39.950> and<00:02:41.230> roll<00:02:42.230> them<00:02:42.379> like

00:02:42.399 --> 00:02:42.409 
in the next tutorial and roll them like

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:43.929 
in the next tutorial and roll them like
this<00:02:42.709> and<00:02:42.950> it'll<00:02:43.069> like<00:02:43.249> have<00:02:43.489> one<00:02:43.669> color

00:02:43.929 --> 00:02:43.939 
this and it'll like have one color

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:45.610 
this and it'll like have one color
fading<00:02:44.389> into<00:02:44.510> the<00:02:44.629> next<00:02:44.989> good<00:02:45.290> thing<00:02:45.469> also

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:45.620 
fading into the next good thing also

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:47.440 
fading into the next good thing also
with<00:02:45.829> printmaking<00:02:46.280> is<00:02:46.489> you<00:02:46.609> can<00:02:46.730> make<00:02:46.849> a<00:02:47.090> ton

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
with printmaking is you can make a ton

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.000 
with printmaking is you can make a ton
of<00:02:47.480> prints<00:02:47.900> you're<00:02:48.139> not<00:02:48.290> just<00:02:48.469> stuck<00:02:48.650> with<00:02:48.680> one

drying<00:02:49.459> on<00:02:49.639> one<00:02:49.790> image<00:02:49.939> so<00:02:50.569> I<00:02:50.599> can<00:02:50.870> just<00:02:51.019> tell<00:02:51.139> I

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:51.199 
drying on one image so I can just tell I

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:53.199 
drying on one image so I can just tell I
need<00:02:51.500> a<00:02:51.530> little<00:02:51.799> bit<00:02:51.949> more<00:02:52.099> on<00:02:52.250> this<00:02:52.370> side<00:02:52.430> so

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
need a little bit more on this side so

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:55.209 
need a little bit more on this side so
keep<00:02:53.449> rolling<00:02:54.049> it<00:02:54.230> until<00:02:54.590> you've<00:02:54.769> got<00:02:54.889> a<00:02:54.919> nice

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:55.219 
keep rolling it until you've got a nice

00:02:55.219 --> 00:02:57.610 
keep rolling it until you've got a nice
coat<00:02:55.819> covering<00:02:56.389> the<00:02:56.480> whole<00:02:56.719> thing<00:02:57.019> maybe<00:02:57.379> just

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
coat covering the whole thing maybe just

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.069 
coat covering the whole thing maybe just
do<00:02:57.709> a<00:02:57.739> test<00:02:58.069> roll<00:02:58.699> so<00:02:59.449> this<00:02:59.659> is<00:02:59.810> what<00:02:59.930> it's

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:00.079 
do a test roll so this is what it's

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:01.209 
do a test roll so this is what it's
going<00:03:00.199> to<00:03:00.290> look<00:03:00.379> like<00:03:00.439> so<00:03:00.590> you<00:03:00.769> want<00:03:01.010> to<00:03:01.099> roll

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:01.219 
going to look like so you want to roll

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:02.470 
going to look like so you want to roll
it<00:03:01.250> a<00:03:01.370> few<00:03:01.579> times<00:03:01.760> because<00:03:01.849> we<00:03:02.030> want<00:03:02.180> it<00:03:02.239> to<00:03:02.359> be

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
it a few times because we want it to be

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:04.119 
it a few times because we want it to be
completely<00:03:02.659> green<00:03:03.260> so<00:03:03.560> that's<00:03:03.650> a<00:03:03.799> good<00:03:03.919> reason

00:03:04.119 --> 00:03:04.129 
completely green so that's a good reason

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:06.069 
completely green so that's a good reason
to<00:03:04.579> test<00:03:04.790> it<00:03:05.000> and<00:03:05.120> you're<00:03:05.239> going<00:03:05.329> to<00:03:05.389> take<00:03:05.659> your

foam you're going to roll that paint

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:11.470 
foam you're going to roll that paint
over<00:03:09.139> it<00:03:09.340> cover<00:03:10.340> the<00:03:10.519> whole<00:03:10.730> thing<00:03:11.000> in<00:03:11.239> that
