00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:37.270
 Hi everyone, I finally manage to 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:40.570
 upload the video to the skinner blend 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:43.960
 which is a basic technique of pastes 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:48.129
 moldable and we immediately start to them 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:50.350
 lying two sheets one white and one lilac 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:53.379
 okay and of course you can use i 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:56.920
 colors you want you can also use ad 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:01:00.489
 example purple and yellow and blue fuchsia for 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:04.089
 get the intermediate shades of gods 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:05.830
 colors in short you choose and we go to 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:08.920
 create two squares 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:11.910
 then I recommend one thing if you use 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:15.490
 of the pastas that are however very 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:19.720
 soft sticky make squares 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:21.729
 separately because if you overlap the 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.310
 two sheets then there is the risk that with 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:26.380
 soft pastas no longer able to 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.970
 remove them without causing damage 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.770
 irreversible 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.500
 so this is the advice I give you 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:35.200
 I as usual use the case bolic lei 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:38.399
 which, however, I find myself well with 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.399
 this pasta 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:43.490
 the name of this technique originates 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.850
 from the surname of the person who has it 

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:50.860
 invented a certain young lady skinner e 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.860
 then blend means nuance 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:58.190
 we cut in two between equal pieces and then 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:02:00.700
 we are going to superimpose the parts of the 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.700
 same colour 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:10.450
 look at this pasta as I can 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:13.750
 divide the two parts with great ease 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:16.110
 that they didn't stick too much 

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:16.110
 together 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:28.360
 so here we superimpose the two parts 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.360
 of the same color 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.610
 and we recompose the square having however 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.940
 divided between the pieces of the same 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.940
 color 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.960
 done this we will go to pass the pasta 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:54.280
 several times in the machine so as to create 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.280
 our nuance 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:03.220
 we are at the greatest distance of the rollers 

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:07.300
 of the pasta machine then that 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:11.280
 to make the largest dough e 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.280
 we begin to make the first pass 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:27.160
 as you see how the exit folds it 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:33.220
 I overlap and I go to pass 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:35.770
 again in the rollers we force the 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.390
 rollers distance and rare we pass 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:40.630
 then what is important is that it does not 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:44.080
 never change the direction of folding then 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:47.410
 how it came out folded back on itself 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:49.840
 see and let's go over it again 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:52.480
 through the pasta machine with 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:55.540
 rollers opening gradually closer 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:58.390
 so we are gradually getting finer sheets 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:04:01.180
 and we do this for one 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:03.640
 about ten times as long as 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:07.680
 however we do not see the appearance appear 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.680
 nuance on our pasta 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:43.160
 then you saw how the 

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:46.520
 nuance on pasta is the only thing not 

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:50.690
 pay attention to that sort of bump 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:54.200
 of waste dough that is on top 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:57.410
 that is one that will go anyway 

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:59.390
 eliminated will be cut and in all 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:02.150
 sincerity I still can't understand 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:05.750
 how to eliminate the annoying one 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:09.080
 presence above I just can't 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:11.260
 understand from what it depends however this is 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.260
 the result 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:17.960
 we cut the pasta in excess and then 

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:20.450
 we can use our pastry 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:23.090
 faded for example to make 

00:05:20.450 --> 00:05:25.300
 murrine hello everyone to the next video
