00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.860 

in<00:00:01.230> this<00:00:01.530> video<00:00:01.829> I<00:00:02.310> will<00:00:02.399> get<00:00:02.820> the<00:00:02.970> first<00:00:03.300> green

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
in this video I will get the first green

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:10.430 
in this video I will get the first green
star<00:00:04.290> and<00:00:04.710> the<00:00:04.890> rolling<00:00:05.370> poster<00:00:05.970> galaxy<00:00:09.440> so

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
star and the rolling poster galaxy so

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.140 
star and the rolling poster galaxy so
let's<00:00:10.650> see<00:00:10.800> if<00:00:10.920> I<00:00:11.040> can<00:00:11.070> actually<00:00:11.460> get<00:00:11.910> this

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
let's see if I can actually get this

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.860 
let's see if I can actually get this
screen<00:00:12.389> star<00:00:13.460> this<00:00:14.460> is<00:00:14.610> not<00:00:14.759> my<00:00:14.820> best<00:00:15.179> galaxy

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
screen star this is not my best galaxy

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.019 
screen star this is not my best galaxy
as<00:00:16.080> you<00:00:16.350> can<00:00:16.500> see<00:00:16.680> it's<00:00:16.890> the<00:00:17.039> only<00:00:17.460> galaxy

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
as you can see it's the only galaxy

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.170 
as you can see it's the only galaxy
where<00:00:18.810> I<00:00:18.840> had<00:00:19.140> to<00:00:19.260> get<00:00:19.410> a<00:00:19.439> bronze<00:00:19.770> star<00:00:20.279> rather

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
where I had to get a bronze star rather

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:27.349 
where I had to get a bronze star rather
than<00:00:21.420> getting<00:00:21.660> a<00:00:21.840> real<00:00:22.080> star<00:00:25.760> it's<00:00:26.760> difficult

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
than getting a real star it's difficult

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.540 
than getting a real star it's difficult
just<00:00:27.779> because<00:00:27.869> the<00:00:28.349> rolling<00:00:28.890> challenge<00:00:29.400> is

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
just because the rolling challenge is

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.389 
just because the rolling challenge is
really<00:00:29.849> difficult<00:00:30.529> the<00:00:31.529> controls<00:00:31.980> aren't

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
really difficult the controls aren't

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.520 
really difficult the controls aren't
exactly<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.420> friendliest<00:00:33.690> controls

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
exactly the friendliest controls

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:43.340 
exactly the friendliest controls
everything

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.230 

writing

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:46.240 
writing

00:00:46.240 --> 00:01:01.970 
writing
so<00:00:46.690> just<00:00:47.230> go<00:00:47.440> through<00:00:47.800> this<00:00:48.190> area<00:00:48.490> like<00:00:48.910> normal

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.960 

and<00:01:02.980> here<00:01:03.880> you<00:01:04.030> want<00:01:04.239> to<00:01:04.330> go<00:01:04.510> to<00:01:04.570> the<00:01:04.809> left<00:01:05.970> and

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:06.970

and here you want to go to the left and
you<00:01:07.090> want<00:01:07.330> to<00:01:07.480> stay<00:01:07.690> on<00:01:07.720> this<00:01:07.870> upper<00:01:08.470> platform

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:08.800 
you want to stay on this upper platform

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.400 
you want to stay on this upper platform
here<00:01:09.460> upper<00:01:10.120> platform<00:01:10.360> here<00:01:10.840> and<00:01:11.080> stay<00:01:11.290> on

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:11.410 
here upper platform here and stay on

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:14.080 
here you need to roll onto that platform

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.340 
here you need to roll onto that platform
and<00:01:14.710> jump<00:01:15.220> at<00:01:16.000> the<00:01:16.060> end<00:01:16.330> in<00:01:16.630> order<00:01:16.990> to<00:01:17.110> get<00:01:17.260> the

star you'll notice i fell off so let me
try<00:01:21.160> to<00:01:21.220> kill<00:01:22.150> mario<00:01:22.660> and<00:01:23.020> try<00:01:23.350> again<00:01:26.310> this

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310 
try to kill mario and try again this

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.880 
try to kill mario and try again this
time<00:01:27.369> keep<00:01:28.150> a<00:01:28.300> sharp<00:01:28.330> eye<00:01:28.840> out<00:01:28.869> for<00:01:29.560> the<00:01:29.650> area

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
time keep a sharp eye out for the area

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:33.630 
time keep a sharp eye out for the area
in<00:01:30.400> the<00:01:30.729> sky<00:01:31.000> just<00:01:31.420> look<00:01:32.229> in<00:01:32.440> the<00:01:32.470> sky<00:01:32.680> above<00:01:33.070> me

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
in the sky just look in the sky above me

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:43.180 
in the sky just look in the sky above me
as<00:01:33.910> I<00:01:33.970> approach<00:01:34.600> this<00:01:34.840> area

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.190 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.430 

we<00:01:43.730> see<00:01:43.940> and<00:01:44.150> I<00:01:44.240> printed<00:01:44.570> out<00:01:44.690> with<00:01:44.870> remo<00:01:45.260> I

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.440 
we see and I printed out with remo I

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.740 
we see and I printed out with remo I
don't<00:01:45.650> think<00:01:45.710> I<00:01:45.890> can<00:01:46.070> do<00:01:46.310> that<00:01:46.340> without<00:01:46.880> making

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:47.750 
don't think I can do that without making

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.270 
don't think I can do that without making
Mario<00:01:48.080> fall<00:01:48.380> off<00:01:50.170> yeah<00:01:51.170> I<00:01:51.230> probably<00:01:51.590> can't<00:01:52.130> do

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
Mario fall off yeah I probably can't do

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.750 
Mario fall off yeah I probably can't do
that<00:01:52.460> okay<00:01:53.440> but<00:01:54.440> if<00:01:54.620> you<00:01:54.650> look<00:01:54.920> lying<00:01:55.310> the<00:01:55.490> sky

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:55.760 
that okay but if you look lying the sky

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:00.640 
that okay but if you look lying the sky
above<00:01:56.180> me<00:01:57.550> see<00:01:58.550> the<00:01:58.700> green<00:01:58.970> star<00:01:59.360> you<00:02:00.320> can<00:02:00.470> see

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:00.650 
above me see the green star you can see

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.800 
above me see the green star you can see
it<00:02:00.740> now<00:02:00.800> just<00:02:01.670> need<00:02:01.820> to<00:02:01.910> keep<00:02:02.030> rolling<00:02:02.540> over

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:02.810 
it now just need to keep rolling over

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.710 
it now just need to keep rolling over
here<00:02:03.170> on<00:02:03.380> this<00:02:03.620> platform<00:02:04.010> in<00:02:04.400> the<00:02:04.460> middle<00:02:04.730> and

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:05.720 
here on this platform in the middle and

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.450 
here on this platform in the middle and
then<00:02:05.870> jump<00:02:06.230> off<00:02:06.410> at<00:02:06.770> the<00:02:06.890> end<00:02:06.980> of<00:02:07.130> the<00:02:07.250> platform

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
then jump off at the end of the platform

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.970 
then jump off at the end of the platform
to<00:02:08.119> get<00:02:08.270> the<00:02:08.390> green<00:02:08.570> star<00:02:11.230> it<00:02:12.230> took<00:02:12.470> me<00:02:12.710> two

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
to get the green star it took me two

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:15.820 
to get the green star it took me two
more<00:02:13.160> tries<00:02:13.550> to<00:02:14.030> get<00:02:14.150> the<00:02:14.300> green<00:02:14.480> star<00:02:14.840> so<00:02:15.800> I

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
more tries to get the green star so I

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.400 
more tries to get the green star so I
got<00:02:16.100> it<00:02:16.220> on<00:02:16.310> my<00:02:16.550> fork<00:02:16.940> to<00:02:17.120> try<00:02:17.420> that's<00:02:17.840> not<00:02:18.110> that

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
got it on my fork to try that's not that

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.910 
got it on my fork to try that's not that
bad<00:02:18.910> so<00:02:19.910> it's<00:02:20.030> not<00:02:20.120> too<00:02:20.480> difficult<00:02:20.780> just<00:02:21.560> right

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
bad so it's not too difficult just right

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.040 
bad so it's not too difficult just right
down<00:02:22.160> the<00:02:22.340> middle<00:02:22.370> and<00:02:22.790> like<00:02:23.060> I<00:02:23.210> said<00:02:23.270> jump<00:02:23.780> off

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
down the middle and like I said jump off

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.990 
down the middle and like I said jump off
at<00:02:24.380> the<00:02:24.560> end<00:02:24.680> to<00:02:25.490> get<00:02:25.610> green<00:02:25.970> star<00:02:26.300> number<00:02:26.570> one
