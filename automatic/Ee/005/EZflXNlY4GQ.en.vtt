00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:40.050 
hopefully in picking up the pattern now

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.399 
hopefully in picking up the pattern now
this<00:04:40.289> time<00:04:41.419> instead<00:04:42.419> of<00:04:42.629> going<00:04:42.779> back<00:04:42.990> to<00:04:43.110> the<00:04:43.229> e

00:04:45.999 --> 00:04:46.009 
we're going to jump over over a string

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:48.559 
we're going to jump over over a string
down<00:04:47.009> to<00:04:47.069> the<00:04:47.249> a<00:04:47.279> note<00:04:47.610> again<00:04:47.939> fo<00:04:48.149> the<00:04:48.210> top<00:04:48.449> of

down to the a note again fo the top of
your<00:04:48.689> D<00:04:48.869> chord

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000 

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:05.730 

this<00:04:57.000> is<00:04:57.150> one<00:04:57.330> Barty<00:04:57.900> jump<00:04:58.290> up<00:04:58.500> to<00:04:58.530> play<00:04:58.920> a

so that time I don't bring my finger on
it<00:05:17.979> off<00:05:18.250> because<00:05:19.240> it<00:05:19.449> thing<00:05:19.599> sounds<00:05:19.930> quite

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:20.139

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:21.910 
cool to finish the pieces by going like

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:31.170 
cool to finish the pieces by going like
this<00:05:24.479> so<00:05:29.610> that's<00:05:30.610> like<00:05:30.789> a<00:05:30.849> short

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:31.180 
this so that's like a short

rock-and-roll<00:05:31.690> Blues<00:05:31.990> in<00:05:32.380> the<00:05:32.440> key<00:05:32.949> of<00:05:33.400> a

00:05:37.239 --> 00:05:37.249 

00:05:37.249 --> 00:05:39.559

okay guys if you're getting the hang of
that<00:05:39.870> that<00:05:40.770> particular<00:05:41.430> pattern<00:05:41.909> and<00:05:42.240> I

00:05:42.499 --> 00:05:42.509 
that that particular pattern and I

00:05:42.509 --> 00:05:44.719 
that that particular pattern and I
started<00:05:42.840> to<00:05:42.900> feel<00:05:43.050> more<00:05:43.229> comfortable<00:05:43.620> we<00:05:44.520> can

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:44.729 
started to feel more comfortable we can

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:47.570 
started to feel more comfortable we can
extend<00:05:45.150> it<00:05:45.300> out<00:05:45.479> a<00:05:45.509> little<00:05:45.749> bit<00:05:46.249> to<00:05:47.249> create<00:05:47.400> a

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:47.580 
extend it out a little bit to create a

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:50.059 
extend it out a little bit to create a
different<00:05:48.060> a<00:05:48.240> different<00:05:48.479> pan<00:05:49.050> which<00:05:49.740> you<00:05:49.889> can

00:05:50.059 --> 00:05:50.069 
different a different pan which you can

00:05:50.069 --> 00:05:51.709 
different a different pan which you can
mix<00:05:50.310> up<00:05:50.550> with<00:05:50.909> the<00:05:50.969> pattern<00:05:51.389> that<00:05:51.419> you<00:05:51.509> already

00:05:51.709 --> 00:05:51.719 
mix up with the pattern that you already

00:05:51.719 --> 00:06:00.610 
mix up with the pattern that you already
have<00:05:52.050> and<00:05:52.289> it<00:05:52.349> sounds<00:05:52.590> something<00:05:52.710> like<00:05:52.919> this

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:00.620 

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:07.429
