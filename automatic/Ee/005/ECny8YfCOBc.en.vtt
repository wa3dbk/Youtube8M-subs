00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.870

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:20.730
 childhood watch my videos remember that 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:25.289
 my husband is a brother dealer always 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:28.590
 we hold our young place where it is located 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:31.470
 our business and 23 or we always keep under 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.050
 our home because many people can 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.940
 come watch cars only after 5 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.399
 evenings or weekends well so that we don't 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.520
 wandered on business we invite to us 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.590
 here home and here's another couple came 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.730
 watch another car last 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:50.219
 week but as soon as they got out of the car 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:52.860
 they saw my car washing up 

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.719
 they stopped they asked don't want 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.000
 whether we sell it we were going to 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:02.280
 sell much later he tunisia what 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.290
 of course and all the tailgate looked 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.810
 went test drive and said yes 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.909
 how much do you want for him well he said 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.159
 so the scene from the bay-bashty 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.570
 and did not let that unconditionally 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.000
 went to the bank to get a loan 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.790
 congressman wait we need time 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000
 because here in america it's impossible 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:24.090
 without your car and we have it 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.759
 were going to sell but later because 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.250
 in a few weeks and I'm leaving 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.259
 Russia and we wanted a couple of days before my 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.210
 departure put it up for sale sell 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.009
 quickly at a lower price and 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.250
 my absence antonio would buy me 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.900
 something new but as they say all the most 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.930
 the best happens so exactly then 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.860
 when you do not expect it now I will show 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:49.680
 my car something cadillac my juve 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:51.960
 generally cadillac is very good 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:55.770
 car brand in america they are very 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:58.229
 valued from they have such an icon so 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:00.390
 censer branded car this we 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.149
 purchased three years ago at auction 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:06.000
 when antonio's car broke down 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:07.970
 there was a pontiac with very there some 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.210

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:14.390
 engine like ferrari 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:17.600
 and we sent it to another state altogether. 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:20.390
 which is very very far and he is there 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:22.430
 car there was two or three months but also 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.140
 in general, it was necessary to drive something so 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.480
 he agreed with the guys who was 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:30.260
 access to auctions and bought this one 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:35.020
 cadillac then we paid you for it 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:39.170
 about 8 thousand dollars a machine is not old she 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:40.070
 2004 that is, she already believes 10 years 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.100

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:45.430
 ketila she is flawless no problems in 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:49.850

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:55.280

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:57.170
 we drove it open here they even us 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.960
 Said that we do not need to clean we usually 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:02.450
 all our cars are clean 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:05.450
 for professional cleaning we otvozim we 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:08.420
 then pick up the next day here's how 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:10.460
 here everything is done that is of course not 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.800
 from this screen which with many 

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:16.630
 car on what i like in america 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:19.490
 here the car is not a luxury 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:22.730
 nothing more than you boast 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:24.740
 a vehicle to people absolutely 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.520
 care what you have and very many 

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:28.040
 workers 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:30.260
 they just buy you old ones 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.900
 old pickups just to ride on 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.000
 them to work never here nobody 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:41.450
 boast i'm so cool i have there 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:43.940
 people are created absolutely not so price we 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:47.600
 it was generally thought to sell quickly 

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:49.640
 sell for six and a half thousand but 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:54.860
 when people say that they are crazy 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:56.750
 want antonio told everyone 200 when we 

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:59.330
 then we went online and looked 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:01.400
 for how much you can actually sell but 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:04.760
 if you buy from a private person, we take 800 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.740
 If the dealer has 8,800, that is, we basically 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:11.750
 Anyway, we sell our son's cars cheaper. 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:13.850
 so the price is normal thank god that 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.620
 I still have to be here a few weeks 

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:17.989
 need to ride on such a city 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:22.520
 there is no small public transport 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:24.530
 and you have to have a car 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:25.580
 that without him there is simply nowhere you 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.550
 never reach 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:31.550
 and thank goodness we have one elderly 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:34.460
 Uncle familiar and you can for 80 years and 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:36.919
 when we need we always use it 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:40.160
 car also had a censer is he 

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:44.419
 in my 2004, but you see it low 

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:46.310
 the model we called was asked but because 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:50.720
 which of course take immediately taken 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:52.940
 the phaeton is a mechanic there changed two 

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.080
 the wheels also did some repairs in 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:55.849
 In general, a lot of things have changed 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:59.990
 so I calmly went on it 

00:04:55.849 --> 00:05:02.810
 the remaining weeks a month baby me if 

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:05.889
 honestly I donâ€™t like this model because 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:09.020
 it's long and every time i need 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:11.630
 park between two vehicles in 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:14.659
 I have a problem because I do not fit me 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:16.960
 have to turn back a little 

00:05:14.659 --> 00:05:20.840
 get up in this again forward 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:23.270
 I like our plan ford focus it 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:24.320
 we bought it in 2013 in the past 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:28.940
 year too 

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:32.030
 at the auction and he is of course much 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:35.360
 less comparing with that cadillac he 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:37.870
 shorter and when I park somewhere I just 

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:42.889
 fly into a parking space like a butterfly here 

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:45.259
 it is by the way I have a cover on the steering wheel still from 

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:47.840
 my previous car honda i was 

00:05:45.259 --> 00:05:49.610
 honda civic blue here not once 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:51.099
 you are such blue arrows very much 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:56.539
 fun machine inside 

00:05:51.099 --> 00:05:59.180
 i like this what's next i 

00:05:56.539 --> 00:06:01.849
 I don `t know what I will buy antony because 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:04.909
 all cars we buy at auction and 

00:06:01.849 --> 00:06:07.810
 Unfortunately not every time there is something 

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:10.550
 What would you like to buy for yourself? 

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:12.620
 but let's see, I hope that before my 

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:14.210
 arrival before my return is he something 

00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:17.419
 will acquire if not then I will 

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:19.340
 keep eating us about that cadillac well 

00:06:17.419 --> 00:06:21.650
 that's all I wanted to tell just 

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:24.000
 wanted to share this news that 

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:27.380
 I sell my car 

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.380
 good day everyone
