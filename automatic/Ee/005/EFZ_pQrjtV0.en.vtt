00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:53.860 
like that yeah I shouldn't be talking
but<00:05:48.650> I<00:05:48.860> have<00:05:49.100> to<00:05:49.280> be<00:05:52.150> you<00:05:53.150> can<00:05:53.270> also<00:05:53.390> jump<00:05:53.690> on

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:53.870 
but I have to be you can also jump on

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:55.300 
but I have to be you can also jump on
them<00:05:54.020> when<00:05:54.110> they're<00:05:54.230> not<00:05:54.260> spinning<00:05:54.680> it

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:55.310 
them when they're not spinning it

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:57.310 
them when they're not spinning it
certainly<00:05:56.210> makes<00:05:56.450> the<00:05:56.540> job<00:05:56.780> easier<00:05:57.200> when

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:57.320 
certainly makes the job easier when

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:58.570 
certainly makes the job easier when
they're<00:05:57.470> actually<00:05:57.590> off<00:05:57.950> his<00:05:58.160> head

they're actually off his head

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:00.460

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:00.470 
so suck them up when you have the chance

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:10.920
