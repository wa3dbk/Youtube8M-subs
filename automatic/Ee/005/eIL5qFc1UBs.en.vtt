00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:18.570
 from 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.280
 Nine people I create my us since 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.070
 19 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:50.559
 In 2013 there is also the optical mode 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.969
 for the battlefield 4 beta to these 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:53.680
 I want you a little water 10 

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:55.899
 and not everyone has this mode 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.629
 absolutely wants to know only briefly explain 

00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:01.510
 We have two teams and one team there 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:03.370
 it bombs three places and happens in 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.320
 the middle is born at the bombs of the man 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.240
 stop these places can destroy 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.680
 if then one of the targets was destroyed 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.299
 sport the bomb then again new ones 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.399
 somewhere in the middle 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:14.619
 that means follow so long 

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:16.240
 A goal is not always broken 

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:17.920
 again uses the same bomb and if 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.740
 the thing somewhere at the end of the heath 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.960
 this bomb will continue to be used 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.729
 and it will not bond any new and long 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.380
 which goal you ultimately all goals 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:28.179
 destroying the opponent wins because 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.369
 also the round there is currently 

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:33.610
 no time limit is usually 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:35.979
 So played with 24 to 32 players 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:38.500
 a medium sized battlefield then 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:41.080
 will the bomb or the bombs 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.780
 carrier always exactly where the 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.520
 or that is and indeed with 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.110
 meter distance and also a small one 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.569
 sign on the minimap you can 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.670
 actually overlooked those 

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:53.830
 the bomb shines red and 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.360
 there is bomb all the time 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.039
 but also really fast 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.140
 set the goal also is relative 

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:01.060
 fast in the air and has besides 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.830
 all persons still harm 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.399
 Now let's go in a bit more 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:08.800
 detail so operation is really a 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:10.300
 Absolute teamplayer mode is alone 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:12.129
 It's not that easy if you do 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.040
 Just like Patrick plays and 

00:02:12.129 --> 00:02:17.050
 rendel leutert that really takes a lot 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:18.760
 it is really difficult and long 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.200
 I had already had the round easily 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:22.870
 did not want to end defeated england 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.269
 tweeted because everyone just like that 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.129
 bit on the objective in the sense 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:29.800
 for there are also really 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:31.690
 partly these extreme action moments 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:34.090
 if you have people who also strive 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.430
 give because then stop several people around 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.200
 are the boy carrier around and also 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:39.400
 several people who want to stop and 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.090
 There's just this little one again 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.209
 battles 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:45.340
 which are always very exciting and 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.780
 There are also plenty of points overall 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.879
 That's why I do not understand that way 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.560
 quite why the few do okay the kd 

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:52.480
 suffers that is probably true 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.380
 you get to pick up the bomb 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.150
 points if you have that 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:56.890
 are there any points if you have the two 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.540
 there are points so protected 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.950
 no matter what you do you do long dubai 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.690
 fountain carrier to the trees themselves 

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.120
 you will score points with 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.470
 overwhelmed and that interests you 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.270
 Most of the people so I can ask 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.700
 just because that too few 

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.810
 So who will take care of the bomb 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.000
 rewarded with points 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:14.410
 I am rewarded as a player because 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.940
 I have more people to join or 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:19.420
 and ultimately by simply more 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:21.640
 That's why it's fun because it plays objectively 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.220
 makes it much more fun for everyone 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:26.440
 Vehicles are there first to the tr 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.940
 I do not think so bad that there was 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.340
 do not learn about modes and power 

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.080
 Here is a normal impression 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.480
 gives me a transport helicopter 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.400
 opinion after the most important vehicle for 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.930
 the bomb carrier because of the 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.620
 troop transporter it's not that much 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.570
 endures 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.250
 the jet ski was only on the water 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:44.170
 go and transport helicopter actually 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.750
 Everywhere the counter can head 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:48.730
 there is also still very important there 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.200
 This simply serves everyone 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:54.250
 destroy generic vehicles image 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:56.410
 the character take care of air transport 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.270
 helicopter around the tank so indium 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:59.680
 Everything can take care of and the tank 

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:01.630
 there is also still deck is bit 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.240
 more important for the ground or as well 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:05.560
 transporter for the Bodden carrier and he 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:08.380
 is also very important to the 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.660
 enemy anti he so as no tips 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:12.970
 By the way, the soul is this time 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:15.460
 not so important as you stop 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:17.560
 Infinity tickets has been crucial 

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:19.830
 rather the pioneer to stop the generic ones 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:22.210
 to destroy the vehicle because the vehicles 

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:24.550
 actually so the main problem of 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:26.470
 bomb carriers are there the bomb carrier 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.240
 year is permanently marked you should 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:30.280
 usually a little faster because of that 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.350
 Opponents recognize all other immediately where 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.120
 of course you want to transport 

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:36.310
 Helicopter relatively good because a plane 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:38.050
 with helicopter so a bit of rum and 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:39.850
 looks too short which flag is or the 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.530
 free and then here always the full one 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:43.570
 helicopter you go to the flag with 

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:44.500
 five people put the thing or it is yes 

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:46.420
 he is already a few seconds 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.910
 broken and so you can quickly with 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:50.260
 act helicopters otherwise think 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:52.060
 There is also this battle 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.230
 pickups weapons on top of that 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.420
 There are skyscrapers this one 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:59.000
 rocket launcher which has especially in 

00:04:55.420 --> 00:05:01.470
 these vehicles are very very useful 

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:05.150
 ok, hopefully, has fallen again 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:05.150
 Three people next time
