today<00:00:13.250> look<00:00:14.250> at<00:00:14.370> that<00:00:14.519> engine<00:00:14.730> that's<00:00:15.660> tough

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
today look at that engine that's tough

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.140 
today look at that engine that's tough
right<00:00:16.379> there<00:00:16.529> and<00:00:16.770> this<00:00:16.830> is<00:00:17.060> closest<00:00:18.060> you're

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
right there and this is closest you're

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.700 
right there and this is closest you're
going<00:00:18.270> to<00:00:18.330> get<00:00:18.449> to<00:00:18.570> a<00:00:18.600> car<00:00:18.869> engine<00:00:19.170> and<00:00:19.320> a

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
going to get to a car engine and a

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.849 
going to get to a car engine and a
little<00:00:19.949> garden<00:00:20.400> tractor<00:00:21.080> your<00:00:22.080> reservoir<00:00:22.500> for

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
little garden tractor your reservoir for

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.920 
little garden tractor your reservoir for
your<00:00:23.039> antifreeze<00:00:23.420> as<00:00:24.420> you<00:00:24.570> can<00:00:24.660> see<00:00:24.810> it's

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
your antifreeze as you can see it's

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.509 
your antifreeze as you can see it's
above<00:00:25.289> a<00:00:25.380> minimum<00:00:25.830> but<00:00:26.010> I'll<00:00:26.189> need<00:00:26.310> to<00:00:26.400> add

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
above a minimum but I'll need to add

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.950 
above a minimum but I'll need to add
some<00:00:26.550> your<00:00:28.220> thermostat<00:00:29.220> housing<00:00:29.599> your<00:00:30.599> cap

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
some your thermostat housing your cap

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:38.869 
some your thermostat housing your cap
and<00:00:31.230> under<00:00:31.980> there's<00:00:32.160> two<00:00:32.279> antifreeze<00:00:37.879> yeah

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
and under there's two antifreeze yeah

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.139 
and under there's two antifreeze yeah
which<00:00:39.360> is<00:00:39.510> good<00:00:39.690> because<00:00:39.719> it's<00:00:40.050> full<00:00:40.260> up<00:00:40.500> there

00:00:41.139 --> 00:00:41.149 
which is good because it's full up there

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:43.729 
which is good because it's full up there
so<00:00:42.149> whoever<00:00:42.390> had<00:00:42.660> this<00:00:42.780> topped<00:00:43.079> it<00:00:43.230> off<00:00:43.350> left

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
so whoever had this topped it off left

00:00:43.739 --> 00:01:00.520 
so whoever had this topped it off left
it<00:00:43.890> topped<00:00:44.100> off<00:00:45.800> up<00:00:46.800> fudge<00:00:55.789> front<00:00:56.789> radiator

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
my ride around the yard tractor 5-speed

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.210 
my ride around the yard tractor 5-speed
the<00:01:15.960> hump<00:01:16.200> right<00:01:16.380> there's<00:01:16.590> four<00:01:16.860> because<00:01:17.189> it

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
has the drive shaft parking brake like a

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:28.969 
has the drive shaft parking brake like a
car<00:01:22.880> 5-speed<00:01:27.110> luckily<00:01:28.110> it<00:01:28.320> did<00:01:28.470> not<00:01:28.590> it<00:01:28.829> did

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
car 5-speed luckily it did not it did

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.980 
car 5-speed luckily it did not it did
not<00:01:29.100> have<00:01:29.250> a<00:01:29.280> key<00:01:29.490> so<00:01:29.850> luckily<00:01:30.630> we<00:01:30.930> are

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
not have a key so luckily we are

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.499 
not have a key so luckily we are
mechanics<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:31.829> keep<00:01:32.729> supporting<00:01:32.880> universal

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
mechanics and keep supporting universal

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:34.700 
mechanics and keep supporting universal
so<00:01:33.600> we<00:01:33.689> have<00:01:33.810> a<00:01:33.840> little<00:01:34.049> honda<00:01:34.350> key<00:01:34.530> right<00:01:34.680> here

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
so we have a little honda key right here

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.840 
so we have a little honda key right here
and<00:01:35.520> it<00:01:35.640> fits<00:01:35.880> in<00:01:36.030> a<00:01:36.150> good<00:01:37.610> that's<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.670> best

and it fits in a good that's the best
thing<00:01:38.939> about<00:01:39.060> mechanic<00:01:39.509> because<00:01:39.740> see<00:01:40.740> all

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
thing about mechanic because see all

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.679 
thing about mechanic because see all
these<00:01:41.009> keys<00:01:41.280> right<00:01:41.430> here<00:01:41.490> I<00:01:41.909> mean<00:01:42.390> these<00:01:42.509> can

like that but ok feel reservoir it's got
a<00:02:03.210> shot<00:02:03.689> of<00:02:03.780> fuel<00:02:03.930> gauge<00:02:04.110> it's<00:02:04.439> empty<00:02:04.710> right

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
a shot of fuel gauge it's empty right

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.760 
a shot of fuel gauge it's empty right
now

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 
now

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.710 
now

so I think it's empty oh that's awesome
it's<00:02:09.810> bare<00:02:10.080> dry<00:02:10.440> empty<00:02:10.830> in<00:02:10.950> there<00:02:11.100> that's<00:02:11.730> good

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
it's bare dry empty in there that's good

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.830 
it's bare dry empty in there that's good
that's<00:02:12.990> good<00:02:13.700> only<00:02:14.700> one<00:02:14.880> fly<00:02:15.060> tyer<00:02:15.360> this<00:02:15.660> move

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
that's good only one fly tyer this move

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:24.020 
that's good only one fly tyer this move
will<00:02:15.959> pump<00:02:16.260> up<00:02:20.450> on<00:02:21.450> this<00:02:21.600> side<00:02:21.920> air<00:02:22.920> box<00:02:23.250> two

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
will pump up on this side air box two

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.500 
will pump up on this side air box two
cylinders<00:02:25.610> similar<00:02:26.610> one<00:02:26.790> in<00:02:26.819> seven<00:02:27.209> there<00:02:27.330> too

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
cylinders similar one in seven there too

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
cylinders similar one in seven there too
which<00:02:28.459> puked<00:02:29.459> oil<00:02:29.670> all<00:02:29.910> out<00:02:30.150> on<00:02:30.180> me<00:02:30.530> just
