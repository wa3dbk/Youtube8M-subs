 Yes 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.690
 to sleep 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.039
 this pure 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.730
 you are a couple in life we are 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:54.190
 came the idea of ​​leaving a group together 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.780
 in fact we have as already thought 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.640
 to make music together that's the 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.320
 first step that came to us we have 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.329
 so joseph composed things to the 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:04.239
 guitar I wanted to do a 

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:05.950
 few scenes too and in the long run 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.539
 but it was still long the same 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.340
 moment we were still ready to 

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:11.470
 start composing songs then 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.390
 we felt with him the 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.280
 find texts of golden kim then 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.020
 the addition of golden kim in our project 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.050
 creation that it could start at 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:22.000
 to be a record debut how is 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.860
 come who gilded me is what you have 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.509
 tried to write your texts it did not matter 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.770
 any market has turned to a peak 

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:28.149
 because she had to do 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.950
 in fact we can say that it goes all 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:31.810
 walk but I did not even try because 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.179
 that it tempted me not I had no 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.500
 writing impulse and then when I 

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:36.460
 when I discovered the radiation of 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.610
 black body of golden kim 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.619
 that's where I got the envy of 

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.350
 compose a song to put his words 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:45.580
 the music 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.600
 after that we met her and me 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.770
 I told him that I had written 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.200
 songs with her lyrics she does not 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.549
 knew nothing and then she is there 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.590

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.250

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.020

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.700
 speed things up that seduces in it's going 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:28.750

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.200
 Music had never heard his daughter 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.200

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.470
 songs on 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.330
 he took out his agenda with regard to 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.190
 good in three months could come in 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.840
 studio I call such a call a tackle 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.790

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.060
 go over really more speed 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.060

 What would we do surprise 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:29.600
 to learn about you consults 

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:31.700
 I do not have at home a bathrobe 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.820

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:37.880
 offered by emilie may be seven 

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:40.940
 of this and sometimes after taking a 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.530
 bath I put on this blue dressing gown 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.750
 and I arrive quietly towards the 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.790
 bedroom 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.860
 I take off very quietly it's a 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:52.370
 kind of strand cord too which is 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:54.890
 matching the dress is obvious and I 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:57.550
 remove it like that all that and it falls 

00:03:54.890 --> 00:04:02.180

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:03.710

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:07.240
