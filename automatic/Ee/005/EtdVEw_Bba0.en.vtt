00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
pickaxes and stuff so i started at level

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.230 
pickaxes and stuff so i started at level
16<00:01:18.780> which<00:01:19.770> is<00:01:19.800> this<00:01:20.100> level<00:01:20.430> right<00:01:20.460> here<00:01:20.640> as<00:01:21.090> you

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
can see i made a bunch of intricate

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.060 
can see i made a bunch of intricate
tunnels<00:01:23.479> attempting<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.660> find<00:01:25.470> some<00:01:25.770> diamonds

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
tunnels attempting to find some diamonds

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.170 
tunnels attempting to find some diamonds
and<00:01:26.610> couldn't<00:01:27.450> find<00:01:27.570> anything<00:01:27.869> on<00:01:28.200> level<00:01:28.500> 16

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
and couldn't find anything on level 16

and couldn't find anything on level 16
all<00:01:30.180> these<00:01:30.479> mark<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.560> level<00:01:31.860> 16<00:01:32.310> because

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
all these mark the level 16 because

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.330 
all these mark the level 16 because
that's<00:01:33.090> where<00:01:33.240> I<00:01:33.270> started<00:01:33.860> so<00:01:34.860> I<00:01:34.890> went<00:01:35.130> down

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
that's where I started so I went down

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.660 
that's where I started so I went down
and<00:01:36.090> I<00:01:36.360> decided<00:01:36.720> instead<00:01:37.110> of<00:01:37.229> 16<00:01:37.710> let's<00:01:38.280> start

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
and I decided instead of 16 let's start

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.840 
and I decided instead of 16 let's start
from<00:01:38.850> one<00:01:39.590> now<00:01:40.590> this<00:01:41.160> leads<00:01:41.399> all<00:01:41.550> the<00:01:41.580> way<00:01:41.700> up

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
from one now this leads all the way up

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.109
