have<00:00:00.390> you<00:00:00.510> ever<00:00:00.599> wondered<00:00:01.050> why<00:00:01.260> we<00:00:01.290> are

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:01.620 
have you ever wondered why we are

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:03.649 
have you ever wondered why we are
considered<00:00:02.100> a<00:00:02.250> living<00:00:02.580> thing<00:00:02.820> why<00:00:03.449> are<00:00:03.510> we

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
considered a living thing why are we

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:06.320 
considered a living thing why are we
considered<00:00:04.110> life<00:00:04.410> why<00:00:05.160> isn't<00:00:05.430> a<00:00:05.520> smartphone<00:00:05.910> a

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:06.330 
considered life why isn't a smartphone a

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:07.909 
considered life why isn't a smartphone a
computer<00:00:06.839> that<00:00:07.020> you're<00:00:07.170> most<00:00:07.350> likely<00:00:07.620> view

computer that you're most likely view
and<00:00:08.069> I'm<00:00:08.130> considered<00:00:08.580> to<00:00:08.670> be<00:00:08.790> alive<00:00:09.059> why<00:00:09.900> is

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
and I'm considered to be alive why is

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:11.450

the wedding table not consider it life

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:12.980 
the wedding table not consider it life
be<00:00:11.700> at<00:00:11.820> a<00:00:11.940> tree<00:00:12.269> is<00:00:12.330> a<00:00:12.389> living<00:00:12.660> thing

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
be at a tree is a living thing

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.129 
be at a tree is a living thing
what<00:00:13.950> is<00:00:14.130> life<00:00:14.429> well<00:00:15.150> it's<00:00:15.299> debatable<00:00:15.540> but

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
what is life well it's debatable but

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.930 
what is life well it's debatable but
most<00:00:16.350> scientists<00:00:16.890> however<00:00:17.039> do<00:00:17.340> agree<00:00:17.609> on<00:00:17.760> some

key things these things is what

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.349 
key things these things is what
determines<00:00:20.400> whether<00:00:20.460> something<00:00:21.000> is<00:00:21.060> a<00:00:21.119> living

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
determines whether something is a living

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.570 
determines whether something is a living
being<00:00:21.630> it<00:00:22.020> is<00:00:22.410> called<00:00:22.650> the<00:00:22.859> characteristics

biology is such a diverse subject with

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:36.920 
biology is such a diverse subject with
several<00:00:35.579> different<00:00:35.790> topics<00:00:36.390> I<00:00:36.570> will<00:00:36.690> be

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
several different topics I will be

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.660 
several different topics I will be
teaching<00:00:37.140> you<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.530> basics<00:00:38.040> as<00:00:38.340> well<00:00:38.430> as

detail concepts and biology such as the

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.639 
detail concepts and biology such as the
characteristics<00:00:42.000> of<00:00:42.120> life<00:00:42.300> which<00:00:42.840> is<00:00:43.079> a<00:00:43.110> basic

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
characteristics of life which is a basic

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.459 
characteristics of life which is a basic
concept<00:00:43.980> to<00:00:44.129> understand<00:00:44.780> so<00:00:45.780> what<00:00:46.200> are<00:00:46.320> these

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
concept to understand so what are these

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:47.479 
concept to understand so what are these
characteristics

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
characteristics

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.729 
characteristics
well<00:00:47.940> for<00:00:48.390> starters<00:00:48.480> all<00:00:48.989> living<00:00:49.320> things<00:00:49.530> are

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
well for starters all living things are

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.560 
well for starters all living things are
made<00:00:49.920> up<00:00:50.010> of<00:00:50.129> cells<00:00:50.340> most<00:00:50.969> of<00:00:51.180> you<00:00:51.270> have<00:00:51.420> heard

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:51.570 
made up of cells most of you have heard

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.029 
made up of cells most of you have heard
of<00:00:51.690> itself<00:00:51.989> but<00:00:52.289> don't<00:00:52.469> really<00:00:52.680> know<00:00:52.800> what<00:00:52.920> it

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
of itself but don't really know what it

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.310 
of itself but don't really know what it
is<00:00:53.160> well<00:00:53.460> let<00:00:53.699> me<00:00:53.730> explain<00:00:53.879> it<00:00:54.149> cells<00:00:54.930> a<00:00:55.110> very

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
is well let me explain it cells a very

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.510 
is well let me explain it cells a very
small<00:00:55.590> structure<00:00:56.010> that<00:00:56.100> makes<00:00:56.280> up<00:00:56.399> an

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
small structure that makes up an

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.939 
small structure that makes up an
organism<00:00:56.989> basically<00:00:57.989> what<00:00:58.170> we<00:00:58.320> are<00:00:58.350> made<00:00:58.770> of

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
organism basically what we are made of

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.770 
organism basically what we are made of
this<00:00:59.340> tiny<00:00:59.609> picture<00:01:00.000> you<00:01:00.090> see<00:01:00.270> here<00:01:00.480> is<00:01:00.570> one<00:01:00.750> of

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
this tiny picture you see here is one of

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.959 
this tiny picture you see here is one of
many<00:01:01.050> stuck<00:01:01.440> together<00:01:01.590> creating<00:01:02.340> a<00:01:02.430> body<00:01:02.670> part

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
many stuck together creating a body part

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:05.000 
many stuck together creating a body part
like<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.180> muscle<00:01:03.629> or<00:01:03.780> a<00:01:03.840> nerve<00:01:04.080> there<00:01:04.830> are

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
like a muscle or a nerve there are

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:06.920 
like a muscle or a nerve there are
several<00:01:05.250> types<00:01:05.549> of<00:01:05.670> cells<00:01:05.939> such<00:01:06.360> as<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.689> cells

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
several types of cells such as the cells

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.140 
several types of cells such as the cells
that<00:01:07.110> make<00:01:07.260> up<00:01:07.290> your<00:01:07.530> skin<00:01:07.740> picture<00:01:08.640> this<00:01:08.850> cell

second all living things must respond to

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.710 
second all living things must respond to
their<00:01:28.950> environment<00:01:28.979> an<00:01:29.640> excellent<00:01:30.570> example

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
their environment an excellent example

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.289 
their environment an excellent example
is<00:01:31.409> a<00:01:31.439> Venus<00:01:31.890> flytrap<00:01:32.100> which<00:01:32.579> is<00:01:32.729> a<00:01:32.759> plant<00:01:33.119> that

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
is a Venus flytrap which is a plant that

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.620 
is a Venus flytrap which is a plant that
eats<00:01:33.479> bugs<00:01:33.680> yes<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:34.890> plant<00:01:35.220> that<00:01:35.579> eats<00:01:35.610> bugs<00:01:36.060> so

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
eats bugs yes a plant that eats bugs so

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.539 
eats bugs yes a plant that eats bugs so
basically<00:01:37.049> even<00:01:37.320> his<00:01:37.619> flytrap<00:01:38.130> has<00:01:38.340> these

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
basically even his flytrap has these
