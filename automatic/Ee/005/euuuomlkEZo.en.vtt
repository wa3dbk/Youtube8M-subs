filter or in these types of air filters
I<00:00:14.790> don't<00:00:14.969> know<00:00:15.059> if<00:00:15.150> it's<00:00:15.240> all<00:00:15.450> of<00:00:15.509> them<00:00:16.820> when

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
I don't know if it's all of them when

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.599 
I don't know if it's all of them when
you<00:00:17.940> installed<00:00:18.359> it<00:00:18.480> on<00:00:18.630> the<00:00:18.869> car<00:00:19.490> which<00:00:20.490> I've

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
you installed it on the car which I've

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.800 
you installed it on the car which I've
just<00:00:20.640> done<00:00:21.060> I<00:00:21.300> took<00:00:22.260> it<00:00:22.529> out<00:00:22.619> and<00:00:23.420> when<00:00:24.420> you<00:00:24.570> get

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
just done I took it out and when you get

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.099 
just done I took it out and when you get
on<00:00:25.019> it<00:00:25.050> it<00:00:25.740> feels<00:00:26.070> like<00:00:26.279> the<00:00:26.430> car<00:00:26.699> is<00:00:27.949> bogging

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:30.109 
on it it feels like the car is bogging

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:32.979 
on it it feels like the car is bogging
bogging<00:00:31.109> down<00:00:31.140> if<00:00:31.679> it<00:00:31.949> feels<00:00:32.279> like<00:00:32.399> it's

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:32.989 
bogging down if it feels like it's

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:36.440 
bogging down if it feels like it's
lurching<00:00:33.989> kind<00:00:34.320> of<00:00:34.910> kind<00:00:35.910> of<00:00:35.969> hard<00:00:36.090> to<00:00:36.149> explain

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
lurching kind of kind of hard to explain

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.790 
lurching kind of kind of hard to explain
but<00:00:36.719> that's<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:36.989> best<00:00:37.110> I<00:00:37.290> can<00:00:37.320> come<00:00:37.530> up<00:00:37.559> with

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
but that's the best I can come up with

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.580 
but that's the best I can come up with
it<00:00:37.920> just<00:00:37.950> feels<00:00:38.219> like<00:00:38.309> it's<00:00:38.489> lurching<00:00:39.590> it's

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
it just feels like it's lurching it's

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.709 
it just feels like it's lurching it's
not<00:00:40.739> a<00:00:40.770> straight<00:00:41.250> smooth<00:00:42.290> pull<00:00:44.239> when<00:00:45.239> you<00:00:45.390> this

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
not a straight smooth pull when you this

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:51.950 
not a straight smooth pull when you this
is<00:00:45.840> only<00:00:45.930> when<00:00:46.170> you're<00:00:46.289> getting<00:00:46.410> on<00:00:46.590> it<00:00:46.800> I<00:00:50.960> just

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
is only when you're getting on it I just

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.740 
is only when you're getting on it I just
don't<00:00:52.140> even<00:00:52.260> I<00:00:52.559> can't<00:00:52.920> think<00:00:53.520> of<00:00:53.670> why<00:00:53.940> and

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
don't even I can't think of why and

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.260 
don't even I can't think of why and
maybe<00:00:54.989> it's<00:00:55.170> getting<00:00:55.289> too<00:00:55.559> much<00:00:55.739> air<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:57.090> it's

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
maybe it's getting too much air and it's

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:01.400 
maybe it's getting too much air and it's
messing<00:00:57.629> up<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:58.050> air<00:00:58.230> fuel<00:00:58.559> mixture<00:01:00.379> but<00:01:01.379> I

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
messing up the air fuel mixture but I

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.349 
messing up the air fuel mixture but I
thought<00:01:02.039> that<00:01:02.309> these<00:01:02.520> filters<00:01:03.030> will<00:01:03.210> pretty

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
thought that these filters will pretty

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.640 
thought that these filters will pretty
much<00:01:03.449> just<00:01:03.809> drop<00:01:04.080> in<00:01:05.180> bolt<00:01:06.180> on<00:01:06.420> you<00:01:07.409> wouldn't

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
much just drop in bolt on you wouldn't

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.300 
much just drop in bolt on you wouldn't
have<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:07.890> mess<00:01:08.040> with<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.250> mapping<00:01:08.760> or<00:01:10.070> or<00:01:11.070> go

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
have to mess with the mapping or or go

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:17.200 
have to mess with the mapping or or go
have<00:01:11.520> it<00:01:11.549> tuned<00:01:11.909> or<00:01:12.270> whatever<00:01:12.689> you<00:01:12.930> know<00:01:13.340> I

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.480 

know<00:01:18.210> this<00:01:18.420> it<00:01:19.409> pisses<00:01:19.770> me<00:01:19.799> off<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:20.159> be<00:01:20.280> honest

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
know this it pisses me off to be honest

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.990

with you I mean it's all hooked up right
I<00:01:24.330> got<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.810> sensor<00:01:25.140> hooked<00:01:25.290> up<00:01:25.500> properly<00:01:25.920> and

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
I got the sensor hooked up properly and

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.789 
I got the sensor hooked up properly and
it's<00:01:27.390> pretty<00:01:27.600> frickin<00:01:27.990> easy<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.320> do<00:01:28.470> it<00:01:28.590> takes

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
it's pretty frickin easy to do it takes

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.069 
it's pretty frickin easy to do it takes
ten<00:01:29.040> minutes<00:01:29.070> to<00:01:29.400> put<00:01:29.579> this<00:01:29.700> on<00:01:29.930> you<00:01:30.930> know<00:01:30.990> how

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
ten minutes to put this on you know how

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.660 
ten minutes to put this on you know how
to<00:01:31.170> get<00:01:31.290> rocket<00:01:31.650> scientist<00:01:32.100> but<00:01:32.280> I<00:01:32.340> guess<00:01:32.520> have

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
to get rocket scientist but I guess have

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.160 
to get rocket scientist but I guess have
to<00:01:32.759> be<00:01:32.850> I<00:01:33.030> just<00:01:33.329> can't<00:01:33.630> figure<00:01:33.750> out<00:01:33.869> why<00:01:34.049> it's

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
to be I just can't figure out why it's

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.690 
to be I just can't figure out why it's
doing<00:01:34.290> it<00:01:34.700> so<00:01:35.700> if<00:01:35.820> any<00:01:35.970> of<00:01:36.119> the<00:01:37.430> anybody<00:01:38.430> can
