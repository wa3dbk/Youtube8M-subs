00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.720
 others do not get out of your profit to open one of the agents they have why too 

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.720

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.130
 I work and something else that the US is a real commission of inquiry 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.669

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.350
 in the cell must once fight our 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.460

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.460
 if you know but i have the match the profit came out at 29 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.010
 but as a result, the western blocker rises at a different school and then the tenth 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.010
 times i have not shown yet 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.320
 sometimes titans and tariq ramadan 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.320
 what to date is quite something 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.020
 however time 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.340
 on the square to young people who attend 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:01.420
 set 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:03.790
 I have achieved some goal here 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.750
 I was also in the countryside 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.760
 that can do very well and if those men hit, wait for a tag 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.510
 to 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.740
 there will then be contact via yes yes yes road users 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.040
 unfortunately it is someone 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.040
 ipad 2 makes us look in all directions 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.610

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.870
 the rear i will be you 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:35.060
 all subjects keep their head above water, but papers keep up 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.830
 already had ahmar 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.840
 stopped but that strength to unpack 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.150
 this year the start has just started 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:48.180

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.070
 swimming pool to mom 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.110
 a beautiful 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.000
 I could again be a top artist 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
 that's that and then beats 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.729
 Expected after a week I don't think it's in the 10,000 years 

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:11.400
 do 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.679
 the children just go to sleep 

00:02:14.679 --> 00:02:17.679
 the album is a achieved one 

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:22.679
 redknapp he was also not lost I had nec against fk j 

00:02:23.279 --> 00:02:27.449
 we live in a time that you think is the most needed hommen 

00:02:28.169 --> 00:02:31.989
 I there also this is grabbing a beer I know anderson as a second language 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:36.239
 out against nec doing nothing all the round playing and finding clear 

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:39.549
 even though I'm not in 

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:43.120
 I am just as irritating sound sounds louder sounds very stupid the atmosphere 

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:45.469
 a serious think about it 

00:02:45.469 --> 00:02:47.769
 and the interest rate is going to change 

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:49.409
 they hang 

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:52.409
 that is not all, nor was it clear 

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:55.979
 can do nothing about it 

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:58.409
 yes you read it is just 

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:02.999
 players are not too long customers who already use for your brain 

00:03:02.999 --> 00:03:07.889
 the trouble not to get general subsidy at the death year yes i did he is better 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:11.159
 you're following a little more 

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:14.229
 such short sleeves even come up to the stable 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:17.939
 today we fall 

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:20.259
 why 

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:22.129
 4 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:23.759
 know what to touch but that off 

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:26.469
 beautiful right 

00:03:26.469 --> 00:03:31.149
 as a result, heavy pressure would then have a thick line through the perpetrator had a point 2 6 3 

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:34.669
 naturally nice if it is closely involved 

00:03:35.339 --> 00:03:36.799
 the robust anciaux 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:42.779
 I can now of course accept the reason through the roundabout of official bribery 

00:03:42.779 --> 00:03:45.779
 when i say do it over 

00:03:47.259 --> 00:03:49.989
 but say so 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:53.480
 yes i have seen this year due to its speed but i hope someday 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:57.299
 payout we have this week with co instance the old box walk out 

00:03:58.189 --> 00:03:59.869
 with its fantastic 

00:03:59.869 --> 00:04:02.139
 either directly 

00:04:02.139 --> 00:04:05.749
 but had always heard a film say a few times in the garage of the city 

00:04:05.749 --> 00:04:07.239
 mountains a damper 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:10.409
 and on the day of the last month 

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:13.409
 already knowing where I stand is not because of that 

00:04:15.369 --> 00:04:18.109
 now the final score yes 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:20.469
 I had he says I stop the hood 

00:04:20.469 --> 00:04:23.469
 who spread after a fantastic 

00:04:25.069 --> 00:04:29.039
 Just the old ones who put away the protest action of players who put up 

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:29.909
 the driving 

00:04:29.909 --> 00:04:33.330
 because then know what the reason is but on the other hand how i ever did that 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.900
 also in the rest of and not to the ministry 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.439
 does arjen krikke the baker grabbed by the doors 

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:48.439
 we know the controls will see it 

00:04:50.279 --> 00:04:54.119
 enschede the website tries to know all the website holes 

00:04:54.689 --> 00:04:58.009
 the barents sea has been around for a while 

00:04:58.009 --> 00:04:59.520
 the ven online 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:00.930
 tokio anp 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:03.059
 wakoopa drove 

00:05:03.059 --> 00:05:05.020
 vague language clear to me 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:08.690
 I had been happy for a long time and that is a bit wrong too 

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:12.749
 although fact kills await 

00:05:12.749 --> 00:05:17.039
 Start with Wetzel Indexes that you will be able to do anything on a twin traffic square 

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:18.719
 stick he emphasizes that 

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:22.639
 and I know he swam exactly on the leg a weakness bid continued to have that 

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:25.069
 Joey they get the job too 

00:05:25.069 --> 00:05:27.169
 and you then 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:30.169
 wales stay i would fifteen minutes after the uci 

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:33.740
 behind that an activist 

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.449
 a bit of collision 

00:05:36.449 --> 00:05:39.599
 I much prefer to have a botnet that I know it really works 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:41.919
 the collective agreement 

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:45.199
 there is a real work 

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:47.309
 just like not dead already dead 

00:05:47.309 --> 00:05:50.309
 9 

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:54.379
 i've got the most braces 

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:58.580
 bekaert was too big a problem 

00:06:00.509 --> 00:06:03.749
 bah i hear it is so still hope i was advised 

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:07.270
 and then nothing gets less I think I could walk myself 

00:06:08.259 --> 00:06:10.389
 it's nothing and the performances 

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:13.389
 that is also possible because 

00:06:13.389 --> 00:06:16.389
 I would do it differently 

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:18.559
 picard 

00:06:18.559 --> 00:06:20.009
 by trying 

00:06:20.009 --> 00:06:21.529
 I am such an icon row 

00:06:21.529 --> 00:06:26.240
 the aex index with thirty animals and i stand i can't be around 

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:29.260

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:30.439
 pajottenland 

00:06:30.439 --> 00:06:31.699
 the television 

00:06:31.699 --> 00:06:33.610
 but it had already been destroyed 

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:35.249
 and I have the car 

00:06:35.249 --> 00:06:37.819
