00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 good morning to all the friends of 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:07.740
 telecapri if they are still in jolanda e 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.929
 with me there is simonetta we are back with 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:12.330
 you for Neapolitan recipes 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.969
 I hope before me on beauty fit 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.100
 you have done gymnastics because today you are 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:20.550
 I propose a recipe for nothing 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.800
 Dietary but not very good in case 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.230
 you did after us there is 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:29.060
 another colleague who will make you lose a 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:31.560
 three carlo heat and then now 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:34.860
 let's talk about today's recipe from a 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.190
 classic recipe however today as we do 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.620
 we always propose a small variation 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:42.960
 the mozzarella in a carriage stuffed with a 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.579
 alice in oil in the center 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.350
 then the mozzarella in a carriage is 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.840
 clearly in a plate of the 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.550
 Neapolitan gastronomic tradition though 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.870
 gradually entering the gastronomy 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.129
 Italian 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:58.199
 in reality it is a great system to be able to 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:00.539
 then reuse the stale bread 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:03.719
 reuse it in a tasty way 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:07.020
 so without waste we go now to 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:10.080
 read the ingredient 600 grams of 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:13.470
 mozzarella necessarily of the day 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:17.400
 first because it must be dry 500 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:20.549
 grams of stale bread 3 eggs 200 g of 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.710
 flour a pinch of salt 2 liters of 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.509
 Peanut oil always because 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.759
 the frying must be done in freight 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:30.570
 abundant and a jar of anchovies 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:33.360
 in oil the mozzarella is called in 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.790
 carriage because it goes by carriage on bread 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.520
 so there goes a second slice of 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:41.610
 Bread on to make a crust the 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:45.270
 mozzarella in a carriage and resting on the 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.340
 bread and described there is a system for 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:51.159
 make her stick to the bread that 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:54.149
 now I will show you then float 

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:57.939
 flour both mozzarella and bread 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:02:01.299
 possibly of equal thickness and of 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:03.310
 however similar dimension must be 

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:06.549
 contained in the slice of bread that does not 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:09.549
 it must be too big and then 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:11.250
 in the beaten egg with a little bit of 

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:13.840
 salt 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:18.099
 we pass only the south of the 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:20.709
 mozzarella and then place in contact with 

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:24.430
 the flour on the bread forms one 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:27.280
 glue and this allows us not to do it 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.829
 separate me now here in the center I open it 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.260
 because I wanted to show how it is prepared 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:36.390
 with mozzarella in a classic carriage there 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:38.890
 let 's put the lice that will be held still 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:43.269
 from the mozzarella we put on it 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:47.109
 we crush it simonetta like see if 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:51.609
 oil temperature and dip all the 

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:54.310
 sandwich at the place and at this point it 

00:02:51.609 --> 00:03:00.310
 we have to plunge into the already prepared oil 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:01.660
 here it is if I have the system ready 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.330
 horse already adventure violated e 

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:08.170
 previous episode 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:10.480
 so to say if it still tightens 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:15.460
 wait a moment we prepare a 

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:20.260
 other always with flour the flour ad 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:22.330
 both sides is the model they make 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.190
 floured pole we dive into the place mi 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:27.220
 I recommend we do not throw away both 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:30.670
 in the place that forms a layer of a 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:36.790
 egg too high and no coach and then there 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:40.960
 put the lice and press the 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:54.250
 sandwich we dive into the place this is 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:57.610
 the classic mozzarella in carrozza and va 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:59.560
 shot only once because once 

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:01.900
 formed the crust on the side of the 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:05.410
 mozzarella then tends to open if 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:07.650
 we continue to manipulate it I do a 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:07.650
 other 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:18.400
 go up on the left look at purchases 

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:27.490
 but nothing of compatibility I knew 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:30.820
 where it is now let's have the crust done 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:35.230
 from the side of the mozzarella that like 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:43.030
 see you are not separating written ne 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:44.800
 let's have another one we make it gild 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:52.270
 good on the side of the mozzarella that it 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:56.430
 we turn the last time and I scoliamo 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:59.080
 I recommend photographing the dishes that 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:02.620
 prepare send me photos on 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:04.870
 www kitchen team punto.it su 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:08.020
 kitchen brigade we use to publish 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:10.030
 photographs user recipes 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:12.490
 I would also like to know yours 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:15.580
 recipes things invented by you or 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:18.070
 handed down from grandmothers by mothers are 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:20.890
 nice things to share 

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:27.150
 the site is a place for fans for 

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:27.150
 chat then come and find me 

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:30.390
 collaborated 

00:05:34.349 --> 00:05:43.840
 don't let it be another minute like this 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:46.419
 we must do the crust we say that 

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:49.090
 we already have these dishes clearly 

00:05:46.419 --> 00:05:50.310
 also said in other circumstances not 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:54.180
 they are dishes 

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:57.240
 dietetic but if we bring launch 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:06:00.380
 tasty sometimes we say occasionally 

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:03.360
 we can also make the diet rude 

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:07.050
 can anyway these Neapolitan recipes or 

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:10.200
 however regional poor are however 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:12.360
 the fat-rich because they had the 

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:14.520
 possibility to make a meal and then 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:17.430
 they all gathered all the calories 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:19.380
 ingredients that they could recover into 

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:21.210
 one meal only 

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:24.300
 dear friends who have the dish ready here 

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:27.630
