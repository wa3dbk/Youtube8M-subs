00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.279
 this operation is what it is intending 

00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:06.720
 beat more serious than in crimes 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:08.250
 cross-border 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.840
 then all the crimes that are 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.860
 happen here in our region of 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.620
 border 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.920
 right the army trying to suppress 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.660
 these crimes collected crimes 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.220
 so we are trying to combat a 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.519
 little more than the crime of 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.880
 right contraband / misplacement and 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:29.510
 trafficking in arms and 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.830
 ammunition or even the armament itself 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:32.550
 guiding the site and control 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.890
 military 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.899
 we are focused here between the city 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.610
 bagé and aceguá 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.290
 then all traffic between these 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.030
 cities there are in the region of 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.700
 frontier is controlled by this 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:48.780
 blocking point if detected any 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:51.059
 gesture crimes some offenses do not yet 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.649
 crimes of this size we could not 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.750
 catch whats a good sign 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.000
 so we are seeing that we are 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.920
 succeeding in suppressing this type of crime 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.199
 so the staff has been working for some time 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.750
 we are here and this type of crime 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.390
 has not been picked up so it's a sign that 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.900
 the tattoo operation arising some effect 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.790
 we got caught some light crimes would be 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.320
 staff who give a little the quota is 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.210
 irregularities in the documentation of 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.530
 vehicle then we're beating from 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.750
 the smallest crime 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.170
 seeking to increase even the greatest crime 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:25.530
 when he exercised he notes some of the 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:28.080
 crimes lehtinen symbol created haiti 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.150
 a federal police intervention 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.100
 depending on the situation we ourselves have 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.869
 the power to intervene 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.150
 so the army is here with the power 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.110
 then if there is any evidence of 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.119
 crime 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.890
 we can act and take the 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.079
 appropriate procedures 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.670
 if it is some crime that has eluded the 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.130
 more routine crime 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:49.079
 An example is a load of wood and 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.000
 being transported is being 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.200
 may be from Uruguay or 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.840
 from another location 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.360
 there we learn the load of wood that 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.490
 we call the competent body for 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.159
 carry out this inspection there are people 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:05.520
 is working on the army routine 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:07.860
 Air hey we also have air support 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.869
 but it's from the army itself 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.670
 So we have vehicles like us. 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.410
 here we are the trucks 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.270
 we also have chariots 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:17.880
 said that they are being served on other 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:20.460
 areas that the site is not just that we 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.620
 We have several points being 

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:24.570
 blocked by the army and we have the 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.520
 with aircraft 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.780
 the helicopter is basically being 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:30.060
 used in this operation. 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:33.500
 patrolling the entire 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.500
 border with uruguay
