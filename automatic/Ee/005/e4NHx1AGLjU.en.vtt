00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.709 
car camping so we came up with this it's
basically<00:00:54.180> a<00:00:54.870> wooden<00:00:55.559> box<00:00:55.800> that<00:00:56.300> is<00:00:57.300> about<00:00:57.690> a

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
basically a wooden box that is about a

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.470 
basically a wooden box that is about a
foot<00:00:58.079> wide<00:00:58.820> in<00:00:59.820> about<00:01:00.120> two<00:01:00.629> feet<00:01:00.870> long<00:01:01.140> and

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:02.480 
foot wide in about two feet long and

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:04.640 
foot wide in about two feet long and
just<00:01:03.480> here<00:01:03.690> on<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.899> ground<00:01:04.140> I<00:01:04.350> guess<00:01:04.409> you

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
just here on the ground I guess you

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.890 
just here on the ground I guess you
could<00:01:04.799> use<00:01:05.010> it<00:01:05.159> as<00:01:05.250> a<00:01:05.309> as<00:01:05.729> a<00:01:05.820> bench<00:01:06.180> or<00:01:06.600> you

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
could use it as a as a bench or you

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.020 
could use it as a as a bench or you
could<00:01:07.080> use<00:01:07.229> it<00:01:07.260> as<00:01:07.530> a<00:01:07.710> kind<00:01:08.220> of<00:01:08.340> a<00:01:08.460> coffee<00:01:08.670> table

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
could use it as a kind of a coffee table

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.899 
could use it as a kind of a coffee table
between<00:01:09.390> two<00:01:09.840> two<00:01:10.110> chairs<00:01:10.470> but<00:01:11.460> we<00:01:11.580> do<00:01:11.729> have

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
between two two chairs but we do have

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:17.200 
between two two chairs but we do have
legs<00:01:12.240> for<00:01:12.600> it

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.860 

I<00:01:18.100> actually<00:01:19.100> salvaged<00:01:19.880> these<00:01:20.120> aluminum<00:01:20.690> legs

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:20.870 
I actually salvaged these aluminum legs

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.200 
I actually salvaged these aluminum legs
off<00:01:21.170> of<00:01:21.350> a<00:01:21.470> stool<00:01:21.740> and<00:01:22.250> actually<00:01:22.580> shortened

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
off of a stool and actually shortened

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:24.820 
off of a stool and actually shortened
them<00:01:23.330> so<00:01:23.540> they're<00:01:23.690> the<00:01:24.080> appropriate<00:01:24.650> height

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
them so they're the appropriate height

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.850 
them so they're the appropriate height
in<00:01:25.100> their<00:01:25.910> 1<00:01:26.090> inch<00:01:26.270> aluminum<00:01:26.570> and<00:01:27.560> they<00:01:27.650> fit

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
in their 1 inch aluminum and they fit

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.430 
in their 1 inch aluminum and they fit
right<00:01:28.100> into<00:01:28.460> some<00:01:29.000> blocks<00:01:29.540> in<00:01:29.840> the<00:01:29.930> bottom<00:01:30.320> of

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:30.440 
right into some blocks in the bottom of

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:57.310 
right into some blocks in the bottom of
the<00:01:30.620> chest<00:01:31.550> here

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.350 

that<00:01:57.920> brings<00:01:58.190> it<00:01:58.340> up<00:01:58.430> to<00:01:58.640> a<00:01:58.670> height<00:01:59.060> that's<00:01:59.090> a

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
that brings it up to a height that's a

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.170 
that brings it up to a height that's a
little<00:01:59.540> bit<00:01:59.720> better<00:01:59.900> to<00:02:00.140> work<00:02:00.350> with<00:02:01.000> for<00:02:02.000> work

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
little bit better to work with for work

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.210 
little bit better to work with for work
on<00:02:02.420> if<00:02:02.659> you're<00:02:02.810> preparing<00:02:03.470> something<00:02:04.010> or<00:02:04.159> you

want to hire table or something to get
the<00:02:06.470> lantern<00:02:06.680> up<00:02:06.979> a<00:02:07.070> little<00:02:07.280> bit<00:02:07.430> higher<00:02:08.289> if

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
the lantern up a little bit higher if

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:10.870 
the lantern up a little bit higher if
you<00:02:09.380> look<00:02:09.649> at<00:02:09.770> the<00:02:09.860> back<00:02:10.070> I'm<00:02:10.490> going<00:02:10.610> to<00:02:10.670> flip

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
you look at the back I'm going to flip

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.590 
you look at the back I'm going to flip
it<00:02:10.910> around<00:02:12.640> there's<00:02:13.640> actually<00:02:14.000> a<00:02:14.060> support

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:14.600 
it around there's actually a support

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.110 
it around there's actually a support
here<00:02:14.840> for<00:02:15.080> the<00:02:15.170> lid<00:02:15.380> and<00:02:15.860> it's<00:02:16.040> hinged<00:02:16.490> and<00:02:16.970> it

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
here for the lid and it's hinged and it

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.760 
here for the lid and it's hinged and it
comes<00:02:17.360> out<00:02:17.510> to<00:02:17.570> support<00:02:17.870> the<00:02:18.230> lid<00:02:18.410> when<00:02:18.560> it's

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
comes out to support the lid when it's

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:25.810 
comes out to support the lid when it's
open<00:02:22.750> so<00:02:23.750> basically<00:02:24.230> you<00:02:25.100> can<00:02:25.250> open<00:02:25.550> the<00:02:25.640> lid

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
open so basically you can open the lid

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.199 
open so basically you can open the lid
and<00:02:27.010> just<00:02:28.010> drop<00:02:28.459> it<00:02:28.610> down<00:02:28.730> you<00:02:28.850> don't<00:02:28.880> have<00:02:29.030> to

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:29.209 
and just drop it down you don't have to

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:31.840 
and just drop it down you don't have to
worry<00:02:29.390> about<00:02:29.540> it<00:02:29.840> you<00:02:30.830> know<00:02:30.950> having<00:02:31.640> enough

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:31.850 
worry about it you know having enough

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.250 
worry about it you know having enough
support<00:02:32.239> to<00:02:32.600> set<00:02:33.200> things<00:02:33.470> on<00:02:33.680> there<00:02:35.260> inside

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
support to set things on there inside

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.920 
support to set things on there inside
it's<00:02:36.500> actually<00:02:36.950> large<00:02:37.220> enough<00:02:37.520> for<00:02:37.550> a<00:02:38.060> 10-inch

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
it's actually large enough for a 10-inch

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.420 
it's actually large enough for a 10-inch
cast-iron<00:02:39.850> Dutch<00:02:40.870> oven

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.430 
cast-iron Dutch oven

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:45.070 
cast-iron Dutch oven
in<00:02:43.430> fact<00:02:43.670> there's<00:02:43.880> room<00:02:44.030> for<00:02:44.060> two<00:02:44.360> of<00:02:44.570> them<00:02:44.690> you

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:45.080 
in fact there's room for two of them you

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:46.930 
in fact there's room for two of them you
can<00:02:45.260> put<00:02:45.650> them<00:02:45.739> side-by-side<00:02:46.010> and<00:02:46.730> you<00:02:46.790> might

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
can put them side-by-side and you might

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.780 
can put them side-by-side and you might
even<00:02:46.970> be<00:02:47.239> able<00:02:47.390> to<00:02:47.540> stack<00:02:47.840> some<00:02:48.400> other<00:02:49.400> items

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
even be able to stack some other items

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.229 
even be able to stack some other items
there<00:02:50.000> there<00:02:50.420> too<00:02:51.130> and<00:02:52.130> in<00:02:52.580> the<00:02:52.820> center

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:53.239 
there there too and in the center

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:56.280 
there there too and in the center
there's<00:02:53.959> some<00:02:54.200> grooves<00:02:54.530> for<00:02:54.860> a<00:02:54.920> divider<00:02:55.489> and

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
there's some grooves for a divider and

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.699 
there's some grooves for a divider and
this<00:02:57.290> happens<00:02:57.800> to<00:02:57.920> be<00:02:58.040> just<00:02:58.220> a<00:02:58.430> short<00:02:58.700> divider

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709 
this happens to be just a short divider

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:02.470 
this happens to be just a short divider
which<00:03:00.709> is<00:03:00.890> enough<00:03:01.160> to<00:03:01.430> keep<00:03:01.850> the<00:03:02.060> Dutch<00:03:02.239> oven

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
which is enough to keep the Dutch oven

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:05.940 
which is enough to keep the Dutch oven
from<00:03:02.750> moving<00:03:03.019> around

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:09.330 

yet<00:03:06.550> you<00:03:07.150> can<00:03:07.300> still<00:03:07.390> put<00:03:07.690> long<00:03:08.040> items<00:03:09.040> into

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
yet you can still put long items into

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.000 
yet you can still put long items into
the<00:03:09.459> box<00:03:09.670> full<00:03:10.569> length<00:03:10.810> that<00:03:11.050> may<00:03:11.260> be<00:03:11.319> larger

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
the box full length that may be larger

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.050 
the box full length that may be larger
than<00:03:12.220> the<00:03:12.670> man<00:03:12.959> in<00:03:13.959> the<00:03:14.349> front<00:03:14.530> I<00:03:15.030> have<00:03:16.030> a

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.510 

which<00:04:36.449> is<00:04:36.630> handy<00:04:36.810> and<00:04:37.230> the<00:04:37.919> only<00:04:38.100> other<00:04:38.280> thing

which is handy and the only other thing
I<00:04:38.610> might<00:04:38.730> like<00:04:38.910> to<00:04:38.940> add<00:04:39.210> is<00:04:39.389> a<00:04:39.419> coat<00:04:39.930> hanger

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
I might like to add is a coat hanger

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.700 
I might like to add is a coat hanger
wire<00:04:41.340> hook<00:04:41.940> to<00:04:42.870> go<00:04:43.020> through<00:04:43.260> here<00:04:43.440> to<00:04:43.530> hold

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
wire hook to go through here to hold

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.110 
wire hook to go through here to hold
some<00:04:43.889> paper<00:04:44.070> towels<00:04:44.400> and<00:04:44.639> I<00:04:44.729> can<00:04:44.850> just<00:04:45.000> go

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
some paper towels and I can just go

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:48.340 
some paper towels and I can just go
coming<00:04:45.360> outside<00:04:45.840> here<00:04:46.229> would<00:04:47.220> be<00:04:47.340> good<00:04:47.520> to<00:04:47.639> go

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.350 
coming outside here would be good to go

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:52.610 
coming outside here would be good to go

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:52.620 
so that's about it there's a lot of

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:53.570 
so that's about it there's a lot of
different<00:04:52.919> things<00:04:53.010> that<00:04:53.190> you<00:04:53.340> could<00:04:53.460> do

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
different things that you could do

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.159 
different things that you could do
differently<00:04:54.030> you<00:04:54.330> can<00:04:54.510> make<00:04:54.660> maybe<00:04:54.900> two

00:04:55.159 --> 00:04:55.169 
differently you can make maybe two

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:57.740 
differently you can make maybe two
separate<00:04:55.590> drawers<00:04:55.970> you<00:04:56.970> can<00:04:57.150> get<00:04:57.360> rid<00:04:57.540> of<00:04:57.660> the

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:57.750 
separate drawers you can get rid of the

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:59.330 
separate drawers you can get rid of the
drawer<00:04:57.930> all<00:04:58.139> together<00:04:58.320> and<00:04:58.770> maybe<00:04:58.889> make<00:04:59.160> this

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
drawer all together and maybe make this
