00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.080 
depends how hot you set it in your top

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.380 
depends how hot you set it in your top
kits<00:01:37.410> and<00:01:38.220> especially<00:01:38.729> with<00:01:38.880> a<00:01:38.910> puller<00:01:39.119> band

gen-x<00:01:47.759> kits<00:01:48.149> are<00:01:48.270> interchangeable<00:01:48.990> so<00:01:49.140> you

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
gen-x kits are interchangeable so you

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.380 
gen-x kits are interchangeable so you

that<00:01:54.540> fits<00:01:54.780> it<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.110> it<00:01:55.200> doesn't<00:01:55.500> unbalance

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
that fits it and it doesn't unbalance

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.710

the<00:01:55.979> pole<00:01:56.280> I've<00:01:56.610> got<00:01:56.910> some<00:01:57.149> logistics

00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:57.720 
the pole I've got some logistics

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.320

tendered kits ear coupling keats and

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.450 
tendered kits ear coupling keats and
they<00:02:00.660> don't<00:02:00.930> add<00:02:01.229> weight<00:02:01.649> to<00:02:01.680> the<00:02:01.860> pole<00:02:02.130> at

they don't add weight to the pole at

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.609 
they don't add weight to the pole at
longer<00:02:02.700> lengths<00:02:03.030> so<00:02:03.240> they<00:02:03.390> don't<00:02:03.630> unbalance

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619
