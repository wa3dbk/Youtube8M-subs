00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:06.569
 favorite dying in the playoffs with 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.490
 Hanover and Hanau had the two 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.599
 season winner already in the eighth-final 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.099
 to give up 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.349
 the league presents itself to the 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.240
 season highlight balanced and too 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.529
 meet in duel dresden against schwelm 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.609
 two equal successive teams the 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:22.380
 Baskets from the Rhineland stood in the 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.930
 last year in the finale have one 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.330
 strong defense and to protect that 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.220
 but both teams start nervously 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.410
 after only five minutes have the titans 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.149
 the team Paul border must be reached 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.079
 also on captain andrew jones 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.969
 renounce 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.309
 he pauses because of the second 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.430
 personal fouls but young clip 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.809
 gonzalo drove jones out of the way 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.070
 did that very well today 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.730
 income has played well 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.200
 defends a two- shot straight 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.550
 has represented or very well represented 

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.820
 and since he has not stopped our game 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.410
 The game is a very close box 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.969
 the dresden titans have the swallows 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.420
 top scorer under control 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.039
 strong the rebound plays the same thing 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.080
 Philipp Lisa keeps the reins offensively 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.850
 firmly in hand but the titans 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.820
 do not reward themselves enough for that 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.550
 good game 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:13.000
 the titans lead to halftime with 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:14.140
 Represent 39 to 36 has managed to always 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.510
 the phases where we have a lead 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.160
 have earned himself 23 important 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:21.130
 pure carry on we will not throws 

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:23.590
 but have defended consistently enough 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.000
 other factors also in the second 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.160
 half the time remain the sisters baskets 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.810
 on cloth feel always work 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.380
 The referees bring in the 

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.479
 play a game 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.880
 the same giant collects many fouls 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:36.670
 allow the opponent such easy points 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.540
 Fans player and coach of titans goes 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.729
 that too far 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.380
 it is very annoying like that 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:43.810
 because it is the feeling 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.420
 The team always had an extra 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.160
 The bonus is completely unusual 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.399
 that's the away team at ours 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:53.680
 the way to the basket is double 

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:54.880
 get as many free throws as we got there 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.160
 we had to get it, too 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.410
 a total of 16 there are eight of them alone 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.140
 from tactical fouls that is we against 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:04.619
 in gameplay 8 or 10 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:07.780
 who the enemy gets 32 is 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.910
 Outrageously one says the play off 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.100
 game has long been a crime of the lead 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.600
 the titan melts continuously to 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.380
 Crunchtime are the simmering baskets 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.480
 tuned 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:21.280
 Felix sets 15 seconds before the end 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:23.550
 angel the big point 74 74 from same with 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:29.070
 a real drama 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:30.180
 For the three points 15 seconds everything 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.810
 What we have to do is a threesome 

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.370
 Take away and we give the threesome there 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.840
 of which one always plays stupid 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.140
 things do in the defensive awarded 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.610
 play a frustrated philipp reisser 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.110
 lets recognize the exit 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:44.820
 in the extension have the dresden 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.310
 Titans nothing more to order 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:49.410
 Once again it is angel angel with one 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.570
 three-point throw the game decides 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.580
 the man of the day he comes from schwelm 

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.300
 and celebrate with his baskets 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:57.270
 away victorious 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:59.100
 our big men are the ones you are super 

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.870
 super good so the sebastian 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.240
 most of the 30 31 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.380
 years and he has so much experience of 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.390
 as captain even if he is not today 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:08.370
 At the end, the best thing is to score 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.340
 decisions made the important ones 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:12.990
 Rebounds and then you play yourself 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.450
 in such a rush and then it runs off 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:17.970
 it is alone for the dresden titans 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.830
 a frustrating afternoon what that 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.710
 they have played the whole game in the end 

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.960
 but are the dresdner middle 

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:27.380
 because quick profit though extension 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:27.980
 with 90 83 and puts the titans for the 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.380
 return match 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:34.430
 neatly under pressure we will now 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:36.980
 in the week again first the game 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.690
 analyze with us our trainers 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.910
 always optimally prepare for all 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:43.310
 games and that's why I am too 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:45.080
 Confident that we are now at those 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.400
 do not win anything weekend so we will 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:48.380
 Of course giving everything is one too 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.670
 example for us and we want to 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.800
 every case the game 3 here at home 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:53.660
 force but it is still nothing 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.950
 but now it's fast called 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:57.170
 get heads free 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:59.620
 everything is still there for the next one 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:59.620
 part nothing
