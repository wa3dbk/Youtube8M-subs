popular video I had wasn't approved for

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.700 
popular video I had wasn't approved for
monetization<00:00:40.500> while<00:00:42.260> which<00:00:43.260> one<00:00:43.469> was<00:00:43.680> that

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
monetization while which one was that

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.950 
monetization while which one was that
this<00:00:43.980> light<00:00:44.250> bulb<00:00:44.460> changed<00:00:44.850> one<00:00:44.969> was<00:00:45.210> and<00:00:45.510> that

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
this light bulb changed one was and that

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.380 
this light bulb changed one was and that
was<00:00:45.989> before<00:00:46.200> I<00:00:46.440> had<00:00:46.910> monetization<00:00:47.910> of<00:00:48.120> all<00:00:48.270> of

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
was before I had monetization of all of

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.900 
was before I had monetization of all of
them<00:00:48.539> I<00:00:48.719> think<00:00:49.410> clearly<00:00:49.680> this<00:00:49.890> one<00:00:50.129> has<00:00:50.370> much

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
them I think clearly this one has much

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.049 
them I think clearly this one has much
fewer<00:00:51.270> views<00:00:51.690> than<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.800> more<00:00:53.340> popular<00:00:53.760> videos

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
fewer views than the more popular videos

fewer views than the more popular videos

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
i had but that's just how it was but

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.560 
i had but that's just how it was but
anyway<00:00:58.440> as<00:00:58.680> i<00:00:59.129> kept<00:00:59.399> getting<00:00:59.489> more<00:00:59.699> individual

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
anyway as i kept getting more individual

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.219 
anyway as i kept getting more individual
