00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
 all religions belong though 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:08.490
 childhood stages of immaturity of the 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:11.280
 humanity that is leaving little behind 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.340
 little as you are more lose the power 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.580
 that it gives to people and states but 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.199
 having left religions behind 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:22.650
 certain symptoms product of them 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:25.710
 they persist and only they through 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:27.930
 your parents instilled in you that god exists 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.179
 and therefore even if you are already 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:34.800
 Jewish or Muslim Catholic you follow 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:36.989
 believing in him as the typical little messenger 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.540
 that I 'm already well used to 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.440
 ay gross I am not of any religion 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:46.100
 but I believe in God 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:48.649
 very well bravo believes in that character that 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:54.260
 they invented religions but you're not 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:57.289
 religious is as if you had a jury of 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:59.780
 the flu no longer has a fever but if this 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:01.129
 being hard is fine for something 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.309
 starts 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:06.200
 I do not blame you for not believing in God because 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.270
 you are fighting against a whole life in 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.310
 the one that you were taught to love in the you 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.690
 fighting against a worm that does not have 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.810
 nothing magical but it's called 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:17.810
 sculpture against the doctrine that you 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:20.179
 imposed as a child that got you an idea 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.130
 in the head and you went to does not depend on 

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:24.880
 how much you decide to embrace the 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.800
 ignorance but to fight with 300 more 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:30.259
 compromising that you instilled and open up 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:33.289
 to the world to these wonderful wives to 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:36.920
 science to astronomy instead of 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:39.810
 look for any elaborate excuse to 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:44.009
 defend the deceitful frauds 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:47.189
 God is testing me and that's why 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:50.880
 what happens is that the free medium 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:52.979
 will free will if we have 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.200
 free will and that's why the 12 mind 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:02:00.450
 never and will make an appearance in this 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:02.130
 life but thousands of years ago if you 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.590
 the people of the 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.740
 desert and it stopped to the seas and 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.709
 He talked to people but, but hey 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:13.049
 that was before now he changed his mind 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:15.569
 nothing else in this arm of that epic 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:18.420
 cosmic spiral that we call galaxies 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:21.780
 There are four quadrillion envelopes 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:24.780
 who knows how many planets all have 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.280
 those suns and talking about suns some 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.280
 of them are millions of times more 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.470
 great than ours and today thanks to 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.150
 Hubble telescope we know that there are 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.340
 nine billion moons of 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.020
 galaxies of the streets stars in the 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.650
 our own 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:43.950
 and that's just what we can see with 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:47.940
 our modest terrestrial technology 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:51.030
 in 1995 excellent images were captured 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.890
 of a gigantic nebula a few thousand 

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:56.760
 times bigger than our system 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:59.230
 solar the baptized columns of the 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.060
 creation 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.670
 and you know why 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.709
 because they realized that in the soup 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.110
 cosmic that receives within this 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:10.739
 Nebula are the ingredients 

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:14.140
 essentials that creates two planets and suns 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:16.690
 within tunisia millions of years of that 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:19.090
 nebula will come out the next 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.069
 star generation of the stars 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:24.400
 and the planets emerge atmospheres 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:26.349
 the chemical reactions the gases the 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.239
 vapor the irons of those who 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:31.410
 finally the coal and the 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:31.410
 minerals and from there 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:34.980
 and we 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:41.750
 at the correct distance from our 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:42.770
 mother star 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.170
 the one that has led scientists 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:48.320
 be sure that there is life there 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:50.660
 outside when you see water inside a 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:53.480
 fish tank full of bushes and appear 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:57.770
 bacteria and worms that you can see 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:04:00.410
 simple sight that does not make you god and 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:02.770
 although it's hard to understand, the same thing happened 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:04.780
 in big 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:06.250
 no matter how arrogant you are and believe that 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.950
 you could not do the design of the 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:12.130
 chemistry biology and evolution to 

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:14.740
 through millions of years and by the way 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:16.330
 for those who choose to stay behind and 

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:17.890
 keep believing 

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:19.750
 do not take out cheap tricks 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:20.530
 pocket because they will not serve you 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:23.040
 nothing 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:26.200
 thousands of years ago indigenous cultures 

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:28.000
 Mayan Vikings wanted the rains 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:31.570
 it is caused by a god 

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.000
 today we know why it rains and 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:36.520
 we can even predict the church 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.860
 Catholic thought that the earth in the 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:41.190
 center of the universe why the 

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:44.800
 man was the maximum creation of God 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:47.620
 Today we know that this is not the way we have seen it 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:50.230
 with our own eyes today could 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:52.800
 say that in fact the earth in the 

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:52.800
 cosmos
