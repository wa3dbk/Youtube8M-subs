 university students why I'm going 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.720
 play because time is tried because of 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:26.099
 certain in lacquer wants to favor me 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:29.670
 I'm crazy in the list of the holy Andrew Field

 word science and humanities and symbols 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.960
 The logo of the 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.969
 university and the words baccalaureate 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.590
 interdisciplinary or fbc 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.450
 the first course in this format that the 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.379
 Do you have doctors in Brazil? 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:56.010
 favorite arilson bch coordinator o 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:59.010
 student he has the opportunity to socialize 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.960
 with students from all other courses 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.750
 he has classes with teachers from all 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.869
 the courses and this way he will not 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.090
 to wonder when, after he 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.159
 you have to talk to a lawyer 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.750
 biologist who is in situations 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:15.630
 professionals that we always face 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.450
 professor doctor wesley billion 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.430
 Be the coordinator I accepted the course he 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.869
 was created in a condition and not the 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.909
 design of working issues 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.430
 importance of modern society 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.780
 the people entering the university was 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.520
 my case for example many times 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.409
 knowing very little of the career you 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.439
 is picking and is totally natural 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:40.710
 that during the training the person will change 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:44.460
 of opinion here to the student then he 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:45.479
 having this horizontal training is to 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.890
 Specialization 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.689
 then probably here at university 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:53.100
 you will never find a student is not 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:54.090
 equal to each one has a choice 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.479
 different 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:59.820
 I joined here at ufpb I know that still 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:06.240
 do space engineering 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:09.720
 luana bct student then I decide on 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.270
 management and then finally last I 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.850
 I want 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.890
 I was energy and I'm sure of it and 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.320
 thanks to all the matters of the three 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.510
 disciplines that we did the basic accounts 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.130
 I can see which of these disciplines 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:24.070
 it's really what I wanted, which is where I wanted 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:26.800
 It would have made my life from the countryside. 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:27.580
 and inside the block library 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:31.500
 beto 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:36.810
 I'm going to do such engineering there and there. 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:40.540
 bct student then i do not need to learn 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:42.820
 very much alchemical biology and the bc 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.590
 takes away your comfort zone from places 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:46.960
 To do biology of places to do 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.180
 chemistry physics lab 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:51.490
 chemistry lab for you to have 

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.380
 this contact, whether or not 

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:55.060
 coexistence with everyone ends up doing 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:59.560
 you are engaged in each of the 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:04.870
 disciplines much more Luis student of the 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:06.730
 bch early died he already knew he had already 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.370
 notion that I wanted to make policies 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.770
 public but by the master classes 

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.840
 planning and the list does not 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:16.390
 explained whether it is better 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.070
 professionals who work in the area and I 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.260
 I finally saw that graduation 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:22.870
 caused a lot with public policies 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:28.260
 was a kind of complementation between 

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:28.260
 two graduate rackham bnh student 

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:33.640
 so I want a first one right away 

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.830
 enjoy the college a lot and get to know 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.490
 many areas of international relations 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:41.320
 to really know where I want to 

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:42.100
 really follow my life, my 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:46.150
