00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:24.350 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.230 

like<00:02:24.620> I<00:02:24.650> said<00:02:24.830> you<00:02:25.160> can<00:02:25.190> play<00:02:25.520> either<00:02:25.550> first<00:02:26.030> or

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240 
like I said you can play either first or

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:28.150 
like I said you can play either first or
third<00:02:26.300> and<00:02:27.230> we<00:02:27.290> also<00:02:27.440> have<00:02:27.650> a<00:02:27.680> mode<00:02:27.920> that<00:02:27.950> we

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
third and we also have a mode that we

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.370 
third and we also have a mode that we
call<00:02:28.340> iron<00:02:28.670> sights<00:02:29.120> which<00:02:29.780> improves<00:02:30.320> your

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
call iron sights which improves your

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.920 
call iron sights which improves your
accuracy<00:02:30.890> but<00:02:31.850> it<00:02:32.090> also<00:02:32.240> makes<00:02:32.630> you<00:02:32.780> move

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
accuracy but it also makes you move

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.920 
accuracy but it also makes you move
slower<00:02:33.260> so<00:02:33.500> there<00:02:33.650> is<00:02:33.740> a<00:02:33.770> cost<00:02:34.010> using<00:02:34.400> it<00:02:34.930> looks

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:35.930 
slower so there is a cost using it looks

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:36.970 
slower so there is a cost using it looks
like<00:02:36.050> we've<00:02:36.170> just<00:02:36.350> got<00:02:36.470> another<00:02:36.680> dynamic

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
like we've just got another dynamic

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.690 
like we've just got another dynamic
mission<00:02:37.520> alert<00:02:37.990> and<00:02:39.250> looks<00:02:40.250> like<00:02:40.460> there's<00:02:40.640> a

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
mission alert and looks like there's a

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.850 
mission alert and looks like there's a
melding<00:02:41.000> Titan<00:02:41.360> melding<00:02:41.870> Titans<00:02:42.200> our<00:02:42.380> new

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:42.860
