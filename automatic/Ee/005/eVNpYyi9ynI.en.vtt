working on that so for those of you

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:37.530

wishing<00:00:36.040> that<00:00:36.400> Kenpachi<00:00:36.940> was<00:00:37.240> going<00:00:37.360> to<00:00:37.420> be

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:37.540 
wishing that Kenpachi was going to be

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.450 
wishing that Kenpachi was going to be
able<00:00:37.630> to<00:00:37.810> continue<00:00:38.110> his<00:00:38.380> battle<00:00:38.830> this<00:00:38.980> chapter

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:39.460 
able to continue his battle this chapter

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.550 
able to continue his battle this chapter
you'd<00:00:39.970> be<00:00:40.150> a<00:00:40.180> little<00:00:40.420> bit<00:00:40.600> disappointed<00:00:41.320> and

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:41.560 
you'd be a little bit disappointed and

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.950 
you'd be a little bit disappointed and
frankly<00:00:42.100> i'm<00:00:42.280> just<00:00:42.550> a<00:00:42.640> tad<00:00:42.850> bit<00:00:42.880> too<00:00:43.300> and<00:00:43.570> the

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:43.960 
frankly i'm just a tad bit too and the

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.660 
frankly i'm just a tad bit too and the
main<00:00:44.110> reason<00:00:44.500> is<00:00:44.590> because<00:00:44.800> his<00:00:45.190> whole<00:00:45.310> battle

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:45.670 
main reason is because his whole battle

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.700 
main reason is because his whole battle
just<00:00:45.880> sort<00:00:46.060> of<00:00:46.120> ended<00:00:46.870> quickly<00:00:47.200> you<00:00:47.590> know

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:47.710 
just sort of ended quickly you know

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:49.620 
just sort of ended quickly you know
nothing<00:00:48.130> really<00:00:48.370> came<00:00:48.580> of<00:00:48.640> it<00:00:48.910> in<00:00:49.090> this

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:49.630 
nothing really came of it in this

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:51.569 
nothing really came of it in this
chapter<00:00:49.900> it<00:00:50.170> begins<00:00:50.470> you<00:00:50.710> see<00:00:50.920> that<00:00:51.100> gear<00:00:51.340> Rico

00:00:51.569 --> 00:00:51.579 
chapter it begins you see that gear Rico

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:52.800 
chapter it begins you see that gear Rico
who<00:00:51.760> had<00:00:51.850> just<00:00:52.000> been<00:00:52.120> cut<00:00:52.420> in<00:00:52.540> half<00:00:52.570> by

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:52.810 
who had just been cut in half by

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.920 
who had just been cut in half by
Kenpachi<00:00:53.590> is<00:00:53.890> pretty<00:00:54.250> much<00:00:54.370> gone<00:00:54.760> maybe<00:00:55.630> dead

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:55.930 
Kenpachi is pretty much gone maybe dead

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:57.690 
Kenpachi is pretty much gone maybe dead
for<00:00:56.170> the<00:00:56.200> count<00:00:56.470> and<00:00:56.650> it's<00:00:57.220> kind<00:00:57.400> of<00:00:57.460> hard<00:00:57.670> to

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:57.700 
for the count and it's kind of hard to

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:58.860 
for the count and it's kind of hard to
tell<00:00:57.790> at<00:00:57.970> this<00:00:58.180> point<00:00:58.300> but<00:00:58.600> that's<00:00:58.750> just

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:58.870 
tell at this point but that's just

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:00.240 
tell at this point but that's just
because<00:00:59.020> this<00:00:59.350> chapter<00:00:59.710> is<00:00:59.800> sort<00:00:59.980> of<00:01:00.040> trying

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:00.250 
because this chapter is sort of trying

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:01.500 
because this chapter is sort of trying
to<00:01:00.310> give<00:01:00.460> the<00:01:00.579> other<00:01:00.700> side<00:01:01.000> characters<00:01:01.480> a

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
to give the other side characters a

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.510 
to give the other side characters a
little<00:01:01.810> more<00:01:01.960> limelight<00:01:02.470> and<00:01:02.680> we<00:01:03.160> still<00:01:03.370> don't

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:03.520 
little more limelight and we still don't

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:04.829 
little more limelight and we still don't
know<00:01:03.579> what's<00:01:03.790> gonna<00:01:03.850> happen<00:01:03.970> with<00:01:04.390> Kenpachi

00:01:04.829 --> 00:01:04.839 
know what's gonna happen with Kenpachi

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:07.080 
know what's gonna happen with Kenpachi
but<00:01:05.560> we<00:01:05.679> can<00:01:05.799> see<00:01:05.979> here<00:01:06.189> that<00:01:06.249> giri<00:01:06.640> co<00:01:06.850> goes

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
but we can see here that giri co goes

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.690 
but we can see here that giri co goes
down<00:01:07.359> hard<00:01:07.630> and<00:01:07.899> kampachi<00:01:08.859> is<00:01:09.100> still<00:01:09.310> standing

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:09.700 
down hard and kampachi is still standing

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.059 
down hard and kampachi is still standing
and<00:01:09.789> still<00:01:09.999> being<00:01:10.179> a<00:01:10.299> complete<00:01:10.659> badass<00:01:11.069> but

00:01:12.059 --> 00:01:12.069 
and still being a complete badass but

00:01:12.069 --> 00:01:14.459 
and still being a complete badass but
before<00:01:12.369> he<00:01:13.030> can<00:01:13.359> actually<00:01:13.719> finish<00:01:13.929> anything

00:01:14.459 --> 00:01:14.469 
before he can actually finish anything

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:16.169 
before he can actually finish anything
we<00:01:14.679> get<00:01:14.799> to<00:01:14.890> see<00:01:14.979> that<00:01:15.130> yachiru<00:01:15.490> was<00:01:15.729> there<00:01:15.939> his

00:01:16.169 --> 00:01:16.179 
we get to see that yachiru was there his

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:18.239 
we get to see that yachiru was there his
lieutenant<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:17.530> we<00:01:17.590> haven't<00:01:17.829> seen<00:01:17.950> her<00:01:18.100> in<00:01:18.130> a

just destroying everything like in her
path<00:04:07.180> and<00:04:07.710> you<00:04:08.710> know<00:04:08.800> she's<00:04:09.040> kind<00:04:09.220> of<00:04:09.340> super

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
path and you know she's kind of super

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.160 
path and you know she's kind of super
confident<00:04:10.420> about<00:04:10.570> the<00:04:10.750> whole<00:04:10.870> thing<00:04:10.900> but

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170 
confident about the whole thing but

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:12.630 
confident about the whole thing but
rukas<00:04:11.590> just<00:04:11.770> sort<00:04:11.890> of<00:04:11.920> hanging<00:04:12.160> out<00:04:12.340> to<00:04:12.520> the

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 
rukas just sort of hanging out to the

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.790 
rukas just sort of hanging out to the
side<00:04:12.850> and<00:04:13.150> she's<00:04:13.660> like<00:04:13.840> this<00:04:13.990> is<00:04:14.140> way<00:04:14.380> too<00:04:14.410> easy

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:14.800 
side and she's like this is way too easy

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:16.470 
side and she's like this is way too easy
should<00:04:15.100> I<00:04:15.160> just<00:04:15.370> shoot<00:04:15.610> her<00:04:15.730> or<00:04:15.760> something<00:04:16.270> and

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:16.480 
should I just shoot her or something and

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.660 
should I just shoot her or something and
that's<00:04:16.989> kind<00:04:17.320> of<00:04:17.380> the<00:04:17.440> way<00:04:17.530> their<00:04:17.950> thing<00:04:18.220> ends

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:18.670 
that's kind of the way their thing ends

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.900 
that's kind of the way their thing ends
in

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:18.910 
in

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:20.490 
in
I<00:04:18.940> of<00:04:19.300> the<00:04:19.690> parts<00:04:19.959> in<00:04:20.050> the<00:04:20.140> chapter<00:04:20.350> is

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
I of the parts in the chapter is

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.380 
I of the parts in the chapter is
probably<00:04:20.739> the<00:04:20.860> funniest<00:04:21.100> stuff<00:04:21.489> to<00:04:21.670> read<00:04:21.880> but

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:22.390

probably the funniest stuff to read but
I<00:04:22.450> think<00:04:22.630> it's<00:04:22.720> incredibly<00:04:22.900> ironic<00:04:23.260> that<00:04:23.890> all

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:23.950

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:25.680 
I think it's incredibly ironic that all
these<00:04:24.280> like<00:04:24.490> hilarious<00:04:24.820> stuffed<00:04:25.240> animals<00:04:25.600> are

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
these like hilarious stuffed animals are

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:26.850 
these like hilarious stuffed animals are
attacking<00:04:25.960> Rukia<00:04:26.440> because<00:04:26.590> they<00:04:26.710> look

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
attacking Rukia because they look

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:29.070 
attacking Rukia because they look
exactly<00:04:26.980> like<00:04:27.400> the<00:04:27.670> illustrations<00:04:28.360> that<00:04:28.930> she

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:29.080 
exactly like the illustrations that she

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.080 
exactly like the illustrations that she
always<00:04:29.260> draws<00:04:29.620> that<00:04:29.650> each<00:04:30.100> to<00:04:30.520> explain<00:04:30.880> things

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:42.610 
against supa Shima but it looks like at

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:44.370 
against supa Shima but it looks like at
this<00:05:42.730> point<00:05:42.940> it's<00:05:43.540> going<00:05:43.720> to<00:05:43.780> begin<00:05:44.140> showing

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:49.810 
always been seen as I guess the guy

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:51.480 
always been seen as I guess the guy
behind<00:05:50.050> the<00:05:50.320> curtain<00:05:50.680> you<00:05:51.160> know<00:05:51.250> the<00:05:51.370> guys
