to treat acne which is almost painless
and<00:00:12.870> there<00:00:13.110> is<00:00:13.200> absolutely<00:00:13.650> no<00:00:13.860> downtime<00:00:14.240> it's

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
and there is absolutely no downtime it's

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.010 
and there is absolutely no downtime it's
use<00:00:15.809> you<00:00:16.470> use<00:00:16.680> the<00:00:16.980> spectra<00:00:17.580> laser<00:00:18.330> music<00:00:18.840> you

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
use you use the spectra laser music you

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.929 
use you use the spectra laser music you
switch<00:00:19.230> laser<00:00:19.560> and<00:00:20.160> you<00:00:20.250> do<00:00:20.400> something<00:00:20.670> that's

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
switch laser and you do something that's

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.670 
switch laser and you do something that's
well<00:00:21.240> the<00:00:21.390> spectra<00:00:21.840> Kela<00:00:22.109> but<00:00:22.289> you<00:00:22.410> change<00:00:22.619> the

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
well the spectra Kela but you change the

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.880 
well the spectra Kela but you change the
settings<00:00:22.920> very<00:00:23.550> slightly<00:00:23.939> and<00:00:24.590> that<00:00:25.590> treats

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
settings very slightly and that treats

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.460 
settings very slightly and that treats
the<00:00:26.070> acne<00:00:26.430> as<00:00:26.550> well<00:00:26.789> what<00:00:27.480> happens<00:00:27.840> is<00:00:27.990> you<00:00:28.230> put

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
the acne as well what happens is you put

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.569 
the acne as well what happens is you put
a<00:00:28.760> department<00:00:30.410> lotion<00:00:31.410> on<00:00:31.679> the<00:00:31.890> skin<00:00:31.920> for

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
a department lotion on the skin for

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:35.209 
a department lotion on the skin for
approximately<00:00:33.180> 10<00:00:33.390> to<00:00:33.510> 15<00:00:33.899> minutes<00:00:34.290> and<00:00:34.649> that

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
approximately 10 to 15 minutes and that

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.670 
approximately 10 to 15 minutes and that
loosen<00:00:35.760> gradually<00:00:36.270> seeps<00:00:36.570> into<00:00:36.870> the

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680 
loosen gradually seeps into the

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.410 
loosen gradually seeps into the
sebaceous<00:00:38.040> glands<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:38.969> superficial

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
sebaceous glands and the superficial

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.959 
sebaceous glands and the superficial
layer<00:00:39.750> of<00:00:39.960> skin<00:00:40.260> and<00:00:40.590> then<00:00:41.129> you<00:00:41.250> go<00:00:41.430> back<00:00:41.670> in

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
layer of skin and then you go back in

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.660 
layer of skin and then you go back in
with<00:00:42.180> the<00:00:42.270> laser<00:00:42.540> and<00:00:42.989> you<00:00:43.379> vaporize<00:00:43.680> this

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
with the laser and you vaporize this

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.779 
with the laser and you vaporize this
carbon<00:00:45.329> which<00:00:45.829> heats<00:00:46.829> up<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.280> sebaceous

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
carbon which heats up the sebaceous

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.270 
carbon which heats up the sebaceous
glands<00:00:48.120> and<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.870> superficial<00:00:49.320> layer<00:00:49.680> of<00:00:49.980> skin

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
glands and the superficial layer of skin

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.670 
glands and the superficial layer of skin
and<00:00:50.579> you<00:00:51.030> get<00:00:51.180> a<00:00:51.239> nice<00:00:51.449> little<00:00:51.690> heal<00:00:52.110> but<00:00:52.559> it

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
and you get a nice little heal but it

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.430 
and you get a nice little heal but it
also<00:00:52.879> helps<00:00:53.879> destroy<00:00:54.539> the<00:00:54.750> sebaceous<00:00:55.020> man

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
also helps destroy the sebaceous man

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.529 
also helps destroy the sebaceous man
which<00:00:55.710> is<00:00:55.739> the<00:00:55.920> problem<00:00:56.820> associated<00:00:57.090> with

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
which is the problem associated with

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.880 
which is the problem associated with
exactly<00:00:58.050> so<00:00:58.980> you<00:00:59.039> need<00:00:59.280> approximately<00:01:00.890> four

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
exactly so you need approximately four

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.039 
exactly so you need approximately four
to<00:01:02.010> six<00:01:02.250> of<00:01:02.430> these<00:01:02.550> separators<00:01:03.120> between<00:01:03.329> three

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
to six of these separators between three

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.310 
to six of these separators between three
and<00:01:04.949> four<00:01:05.700> week<00:01:05.970> I'm<00:01:06.659> sorry

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
and four week I'm sorry

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.240 
and four week I'm sorry
between<00:01:07.830> seven<00:01:08.580> to<00:01:08.610> ten<00:01:08.909> days<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.409> you

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
between seven to ten days and and you

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.760 
between seven to ten days and and you
need<00:01:11.479> like<00:01:12.479> I<00:01:12.510> said<00:01:12.780> approximately<00:01:13.380> four<00:01:13.680> to

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
need like I said approximately four to

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.100 
need like I said approximately four to
six<00:01:14.010> of<00:01:14.130> these<00:01:14.250> so<00:01:15.000> there's<00:01:15.210> people<00:01:15.720> that<00:01:15.930> I've

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
six of these so there's people that I've

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.730 
six of these so there's people that I've
created<00:01:16.530> that<00:01:16.890> have<00:01:17.220> been<00:01:17.400> on<00:01:17.549> antibiotics

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:18.740 
created that have been on antibiotics

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.380 
created that have been on antibiotics
who<00:01:19.740> are<00:01:20.009> completely<00:01:20.340> off<00:01:20.580> of<00:01:20.610> that<00:01:21.000> because

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
who are completely off of that because

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.539 
who are completely off of that because
because<00:01:21.900> of<00:01:22.049> this<00:01:22.140> treatment<00:01:22.500> so<00:01:23.100> we'll<00:01:23.280> start

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
because of this treatment so we'll start

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:30.030 
because of this treatment so we'll start
here

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.040 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:35.520 

and<00:01:30.130> so<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:31.780> first<00:01:32.200> up<00:01:33.900> eats<00:01:34.900> up<00:01:35.080> the<00:01:35.230> steam<00:01:35.500> a

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
and so the first up eats up the steam a

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:41.220 
and so the first up eats up the steam a
little<00:01:35.650> bit<00:01:39.210> but<00:01:40.210> very<00:01:40.510> quickly<00:01:40.780> the<00:01:41.080> whole

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:41.230 
little bit but very quickly the whole

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:54.020 
little bit but very quickly the whole
procedure<00:01:41.590> takes<00:01:43.410> approximately<00:01:45.180> six<00:01:46.200> seven

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.270 

so<00:01:54.660> right<00:01:54.900> now<00:01:55.110> what<00:01:55.710> I'm<00:01:55.860> doing<00:01:55.890> is<00:01:58.280> heating

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
so right now what I'm doing is heating

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.690 
so right now what I'm doing is heating
up<00:01:59.400> the<00:01:59.760> superficial<00:02:00.690> layer<00:02:00.870> of<00:02:01.230> skin<00:02:01.530> and

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:01.700 
up the superficial layer of skin and

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.690 
up the superficial layer of skin and
sebaceous<00:02:02.700> man<00:02:02.940> which<00:02:03.780> helps<00:02:04.280> tone<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.520> skin

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
sebaceous man which helps tone the skin

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.400 
sebaceous man which helps tone the skin
but<00:02:06.300> also<00:02:06.630> helps<00:02:07.260> with<00:02:07.530> the<00:02:07.880> the<00:02:09.410> sebaceous

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
but also helps with the the sebaceous

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.880 
but also helps with the the sebaceous
glands<00:02:10.790> destroying<00:02:11.790> them<00:02:12.090> it<00:02:12.959> also<00:02:13.110> dries<00:02:13.560> up

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
glands destroying them it also dries up

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:20.309 
glands destroying them it also dries up
any<00:02:14.130> active<00:02:14.700> acne

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:22.800 

but<00:02:20.890> it<00:02:21.010> just<00:02:21.189> do<00:02:21.400> this<00:02:21.579> watch<00:02:22.360> then<00:02:22.659> I'll

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:22.810 
but it just do this watch then I'll

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:28.709 
but it just do this watch then I'll
switch<00:02:22.989> the<00:02:25.680> levels<00:02:26.680> to<00:02:27.579> vaporize<00:02:28.150> this

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:28.719 
switch the levels to vaporize this

00:02:28.719 --> 00:02:32.280 
switch the levels to vaporize this
farther<00:02:29.790> as<00:02:30.790> you<00:02:30.969> can<00:02:31.150> see<00:02:31.359> the<00:02:31.629> patient<00:02:32.019> here

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
farther as you can see the patient here

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.319 
farther as you can see the patient here
is<00:02:32.500> extremely<00:02:33.099> comfortable<00:02:33.459> we've<00:02:33.969> had<00:02:34.150> no

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:34.329 
is extremely comfortable we've had no

00:02:34.329 --> 00:02:41.080 
is extremely comfortable we've had no
palpable

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.420 

we<00:02:41.480> believe<00:02:41.750> if<00:02:41.930> she<00:02:42.110> would<00:02:42.530> tell<00:02:42.709> me<00:02:42.860> if<00:02:43.040> there

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
we believe if she would tell me if there

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:45.570 
we believe if she would tell me if there
was<00:02:43.490> any<00:02:43.700> of<00:02:43.760> this<00:02:43.880> happen

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
was any of this happen

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:55.140 
was any of this happen
okay<00:02:46.580> well<00:02:46.880> let<00:02:47.000> me<00:02:47.030> switch

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:55.150 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:04:07.900 

okay

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:07.910 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:49.660 

after<00:04:08.910> this

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:49.670 

00:04:49.670 --> 00:05:03.970 

so<00:04:50.670> now<00:04:50.820> that<00:04:50.880> we<00:04:51.180> have<00:04:51.290> basically<00:05:00.740> come<00:05:01.740> back

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:03.980 
so now that we have basically come back

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:11.000 
so now that we have basically come back
faster<00:05:05.240> and<00:05:07.010> now<00:05:08.010> what<00:05:08.310> I'm<00:05:08.430> doing<00:05:08.460> is<00:05:10.010> what

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.010 
faster and now what I'm doing is what

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:20.320 
faster and now what I'm doing is what
you<00:05:11.070> called<00:05:11.280> ladies<00:05:11.580> are<00:05:11.730> toning<00:05:14.090> this<00:05:15.090> skin

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:20.330 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:40.300 

pigmentation

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:40.310 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:45.940 

so<00:05:40.850> this<00:05:41.000> q-switched<00:05:41.510> laser<00:05:41.660> is<00:05:44.290> is<00:05:45.290> good<00:05:45.680> for

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:45.950 
so this q-switched laser is is good for

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:49.260 
so this q-switched laser is is good for
a<00:05:45.980> lot<00:05:46.040> of<00:05:46.220> things<00:05:46.490> it's<00:05:46.820> good<00:05:47.030> for<00:05:47.560> tattoos

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:49.270 
a lot of things it's good for tattoos

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:53.940 
a lot of things it's good for tattoos
sustaining<00:05:50.270> our<00:05:50.389> profession<00:05:51.160> is<00:05:52.160> good<00:05:52.220> for

sustaining our profession is good for

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:56.409 
sustaining our profession is good for

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:26.050 

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:29.260 

the<00:06:27.050> laser<00:06:27.230> surveys<00:06:27.830> firing<00:06:28.460> at<00:06:28.640> ten<00:06:29.000> times

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:29.270 
the laser surveys firing at ten times

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:33.430 
the laser surveys firing at ten times
per<00:06:29.480> second

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:33.440 

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:37.020 

it's<00:06:33.950> a<00:06:34.040> pretty<00:06:34.250> fast<00:06:34.550> laser<00:06:34.940> at<00:06:35.240> this<00:06:35.660> point

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:37.030 
it's a pretty fast laser at this point

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:40.150 
it's a pretty fast laser at this point
and<00:06:38.030> then<00:06:38.240> what<00:06:38.450> I'm<00:06:38.540> gonna<00:06:38.720> do<00:06:39.050> I'm<00:06:39.560> gonna<00:06:39.800> go

00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:40.160 
and then what I'm gonna do I'm gonna go

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.180 
and then what I'm gonna do I'm gonna go
back<00:06:40.460> and<00:06:41.450> just<00:06:41.750> hit<00:06:42.170> the<00:06:42.380> spots<00:06:42.710> that<00:06:42.890> have

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:43.190 
back and just hit the spots that have

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:51.350 
back and just hit the spots that have
after<00:06:43.550> that

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:51.360 

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:56.140 

and<00:06:51.629> so<00:06:51.900> I<00:06:51.930> see<00:06:52.289> a<00:06:52.319> little<00:06:52.530> bit<00:06:52.740> of<00:06:52.800> it<00:06:52.979> up<00:06:53.069> here

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:56.150 

00:06:56.150 --> 00:07:06.299 

just<00:06:57.710> attacked<00:06:58.710> me<00:06:58.860> back<00:06:59.039> was<00:06:59.280> one<00:06:59.550> more<00:06:59.939> time

00:07:06.299 --> 00:07:06.309 

00:07:06.309 --> 00:07:08.609 

obviously<00:07:07.209> she's<00:07:07.569> not<00:07:07.839> one<00:07:08.109> of<00:07:08.139> my<00:07:08.319> more

00:07:08.609 --> 00:07:08.619 
obviously she's not one of my more

00:07:08.619 --> 00:07:11.669 
obviously she's not one of my more
severe<00:07:08.979> cases<00:07:09.249> but<00:07:09.789> even<00:07:10.779> will<00:07:10.989> go<00:07:11.169> back<00:07:11.409> these

00:07:11.669 --> 00:07:11.679 
severe cases but even will go back these

00:07:11.679 --> 00:07:18.659 
severe cases but even will go back these
fathers<00:07:12.219> from<00:07:12.489> teenagers

00:07:18.659 --> 00:07:18.669 

00:07:18.669 --> 00:07:21.179 

so<00:07:19.150> thrifty<00:07:19.539> areas<00:07:20.169> that<00:07:20.349> are<00:07:20.500> active<00:07:20.800> women

00:07:21.179 --> 00:07:21.189 
so thrifty areas that are active women

00:07:21.189 --> 00:07:41.440 
so thrifty areas that are active women
as<00:07:21.280> well

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:46.280 
let me have it the specter filled with

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:50.190 
let me have it the specter filled with
the<00:07:46.430> certain<00:07:46.760> settings<00:07:47.150> for<00:07:47.950> treating<00:07:48.950> acne

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:50.200
