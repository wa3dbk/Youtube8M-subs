00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130 
hi guys lately I've been playing around

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.259 
hi guys lately I've been playing around
where

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
where

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.749 
where
custom<00:00:13.080> skins<00:00:13.289> for<00:00:13.500> planes<00:00:13.799> in<00:00:14.039> war<00:00:14.429> thunder

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
custom skins for planes in war thunder

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.529 
custom skins for planes in war thunder
and<00:00:15.410> I<00:00:16.410> figured<00:00:17.009> why<00:00:17.460> isn't<00:00:17.880> this<00:00:18.000> possible

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
and I figured why isn't this possible

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:21.460 
and I figured why isn't this possible
for<00:00:18.930> tanks<00:00:19.349> as<00:00:19.439> well<00:00:19.470> I<00:00:19.859> know<00:00:20.550> they<00:00:20.880> have<00:00:21.090> the

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:21.470 
for tanks as well I know they have the

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:23.689 
for tanks as well I know they have the
camouflage<00:00:22.470> that<00:00:22.500> you<00:00:22.890> can<00:00:23.070> customize<00:00:23.489> but

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:23.699 
camouflage that you can customize but

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:26.269 
camouflage that you can customize but
it's<00:00:23.820> not<00:00:24.720> really<00:00:25.079> the<00:00:25.110> same<00:00:25.289> thing<00:00:25.560> as<00:00:25.949> making

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
it's not really the same thing as making

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.100 
it's not really the same thing as making
a<00:00:26.489> custom<00:00:26.820> skin<00:00:27.060> and<00:00:28.640> so<00:00:29.640> I<00:00:29.700> open<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.300> asus

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:31.110 
a custom skin and so I open the asus

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:37.040 
a custom skin and so I open the asus
viewer<00:00:32.329> for<00:00:33.329> worth<00:00:34.020> under<00:00:34.290> i<00:00:35.600> will<00:00:36.600> take<00:00:37.020> a

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
viewer for worth under i will take a

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:48.560 
viewer for worth under i will take a
moment<00:00:37.200> and<00:00:37.500> then<00:00:41.510> just<00:00:42.510> a<00:00:42.629> second<00:00:46.340> okay<00:00:47.570> here

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
moment and then just a second okay here

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.460 
moment and then just a second okay here
we<00:00:48.690> are<00:00:49.340> you<00:00:50.340> can<00:00:50.489> find<00:00:50.820> all<00:00:51.060> the<00:00:51.540> textures<00:00:52.079> for

a rust and things ross the mud and then
we<00:01:34.889> also<00:01:35.039> have<00:01:35.219> an<00:01:35.850> alpha<00:01:36.719> layer<00:01:37.159> which<00:01:38.159> tells

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:38.609 
we also have an alpha layer which tells

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:41.019 
we also have an alpha layer which tells
the<00:01:38.759> game<00:01:39.090> how<00:01:39.389> much<00:01:39.719> of<00:01:39.899> it<00:01:40.020> should<00:01:40.289> be<00:01:40.409> shown

00:01:41.019 --> 00:01:41.029 
the game how much of it should be shown

00:01:41.029 --> 00:01:44.629

then<00:01:42.029> we<00:01:42.179> have<00:01:42.389> the<00:01:43.049> Alpha<00:01:43.319> layer<00:01:43.439> and<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:44.099> red

00:01:44.629 --> 00:01:44.639 
then we have the Alpha layer and the red

00:01:44.639 --> 00:01:49.429 
then we have the Alpha layer and the red
green<00:01:44.849> blue<00:01:45.060> combined<00:01:46.909> and<00:01:47.909> we<00:01:48.450> also<00:01:48.659> have<00:01:48.840> a

ayo<00:01:58.109> i'm<00:01:58.649> not<00:01:58.799> sure<00:01:58.950> what<00:01:59.130> it<00:01:59.249> does<00:01:59.490> i<00:01:59.759> guess<00:02:00.119> it

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
ayo i'm not sure what it does i guess it

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.550 
ayo i'm not sure what it does i guess it
has<00:02:00.719> to<00:02:00.749> do<00:02:01.020> with<00:02:01.549> what<00:02:02.549> parts<00:02:03.319> it<00:02:04.319> should

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
has to do with what parts it should

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.680 
has to do with what parts it should
place<00:02:04.829> the<00:02:05.549> skin<00:02:05.909> on<00:02:06.029> or<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:07.049> camouflage<00:02:08.690> but

texture<00:05:04.820> for<00:05:05.120> the<00:05:05.300> cannon<00:05:05.780> so<00:05:05.960> it<00:05:06.200> looks<00:05:06.500> like

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:06.770 
texture for the cannon so it looks like

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:10.920 
texture for the cannon so it looks like

and<00:05:18.410> I<00:05:19.069> know<00:05:19.729> this<00:05:20.210> isn't<00:05:20.509> pretty<00:05:20.960> at<00:05:21.139> all<00:05:21.819> and

00:05:22.809 --> 00:05:22.819 
and I know this isn't pretty at all and

00:05:22.819 --> 00:05:25.180 
and I know this isn't pretty at all and
I<00:05:23.330> won't<00:05:23.870> be<00:05:23.990> able<00:05:24.289> to<00:05:24.560> make<00:05:24.590> it<00:05:24.800> look<00:05:25.160> pretty

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:25.190

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.620 
without the original files so as I said
this<00:05:36.259> only<00:05:36.590> proves<00:05:36.860> that<00:05:37.310> it<00:05:37.669> is<00:05:37.819> possible<00:05:38.419> to

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:38.630 
this only proves that it is possible to

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:41.710 
this only proves that it is possible to
