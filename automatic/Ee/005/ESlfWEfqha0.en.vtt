only thing there to agree is the

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:15.350 
only thing there to agree is the
transfer<00:03:13.380> fee<00:03:13.560> in<00:03:13.650> the<00:03:13.740> personal<00:03:14.130> terms<00:03:14.360> so

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
transfer fee in the personal terms so

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.630

London and if you look at the managerial
turnover<00:04:50.360> in<00:04:50.600> most<00:04:50.840> these<00:04:51.050> places<00:04:51.470> a<00:04:51.500> lot<00:04:51.710> of

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:51.800 
turnover in most these places a lot of

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.000 
turnover in most these places a lot of
managers<00:04:52.130> lasting<00:04:52.610> 8<00:04:52.760> to<00:04:52.970> 18<00:04:53.480> months<00:04:53.920> so<00:04:54.920> you

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:55.010 
managers lasting 8 to 18 months so you

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:56.500 
managers lasting 8 to 18 months so you
can<00:04:55.130> have<00:04:55.220> the<00:04:55.310> best<00:04:55.460> relationship<00:04:56.000> with<00:04:56.240> a

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:56.510 
can have the best relationship with a

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:58.120 
can have the best relationship with a
manager<00:04:56.930> but<00:04:57.410> if<00:04:57.500> it's<00:04:57.650> only<00:04:57.740> going<00:04:57.860> to<00:04:57.980> last

00:04:59.860 --> 00:04:59.870 
for sort of 12 to 18 months it's not

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:00.490 
for sort of 12 to 18 months it's not
worth<00:05:00.080> it

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:00.500 
worth it

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.950 
worth it
how<00:05:00.680> does<00:05:00.830> the<00:05:00.950> reputable<00:05:01.430> agent<00:05:01.910> handle<00:05:02.450> the

think<00:05:07.610> that<00:05:07.850> the<00:05:08.270> the<00:05:09.170> reality<00:05:09.590> is<00:05:09.740> is<00:05:09.890> that<00:05:10.070> it

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:10.280 
think that the the reality is is that it

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:11.890 
think that the the reality is is that it
goes<00:05:10.550> you<00:05:10.760> know<00:05:10.880> people<00:05:11.270> will<00:05:11.420> say<00:05:11.450> that<00:05:11.720> any

that's a very very different kettle of

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:32.980 
that's a very very different kettle of

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:32.990 
fish and in which case we can then go to

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:35.410 
fish and in which case we can then go to
the<00:05:33.200> club<00:05:33.410> where<00:05:34.010> the<00:05:34.160> player<00:05:34.370> is<00:05:34.400> at<00:05:34.730> and<00:05:34.970> talk

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:37.400 
about his situation even if players

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.550 
about his situation even if players
agents<00:05:38.210> and<00:05:38.360> clubs<00:05:38.600> have<00:05:38.780> negotiated<00:05:39.260> their

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:39.560 
agents and clubs have negotiated their

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.070 
agents and clubs have negotiated their
way<00:05:39.740> to<00:05:40.250> a<00:05:40.280> happy<00:05:40.550> place<00:05:40.820> there<00:05:41.780> are<00:05:41.900> other

way to a happy place there are other

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.310 
way to a happy place there are other
ways<00:05:42.320> a<00:05:42.620> deal<00:05:42.950> can<00:05:43.280> collapse<00:05:44.050> and<00:05:45.050> it's<00:05:45.230> all

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:45.320 
ways a deal can collapse and it's all

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.350 
ways a deal can collapse and it's all
about<00:05:45.470> managing<00:05:45.800> risk<00:05:45.860> and<00:05:46.340> so<00:05:46.970> we<00:05:47.120> need<00:05:47.270> to

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:47.360 
about managing risk and so we need to

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.520 
about managing risk and so we need to
give<00:05:47.570> the<00:05:47.720> people<00:05:47.840> who<00:05:48.050> are<00:05:48.110> spending<00:05:48.440> that

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:48.530 
give the people who are spending that

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:49.930 
give the people who are spending that
money<00:05:48.680> and<00:05:48.890> given<00:05:49.220> the<00:05:49.310> green<00:05:49.490> light<00:05:49.520> to<00:05:49.700> go

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:49.940 
money and given the green light to go

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:51.760 
money and given the green light to go
ahead<00:05:50.060> with<00:05:50.300> that<00:05:50.450> sort<00:05:50.660> of<00:05:50.690> investment<00:05:50.960> as

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:51.770 
ahead with that sort of investment as

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:54.070 
ahead with that sort of investment as
much<00:05:51.950> information<00:05:52.220> as<00:05:52.550> possible<00:05:52.760> so<00:05:53.150> so<00:05:53.900> what

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:54.080 
much information as possible so so what

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:55.510 
much information as possible so so what
risk<00:05:54.320> is<00:05:54.440> that<00:05:54.500> player<00:05:54.860> going<00:05:55.040> to<00:05:55.130> be<00:05:55.280> to<00:05:55.400> them

00:05:55.510 --> 00:05:55.520 
risk is that player going to be to them

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.490 
risk is that player going to be to them
has<00:05:55.730> yet<00:05:55.910> previous<00:05:56.300> injury<00:05:56.600> we<00:05:57.140> know<00:05:57.290> that

00:05:57.490 --> 00:05:57.500 
has yet previous injury we know that

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.560 
has yet previous injury we know that
plays<00:05:57.650> you've<00:05:57.830> had<00:05:57.920> previous<00:05:58.280> injury<00:05:58.580> they're

00:05:59.560 --> 00:05:59.570 
plays you've had previous injury they're

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:00.850 
plays you've had previous injury they're
going<00:05:59.690> to<00:05:59.750> have<00:05:59.840> a<00:05:59.900> higher<00:06:00.110> risk<00:06:00.260> of<00:06:00.410> future

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:00.860 
going to have a higher risk of future

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:02.200 
going to have a higher risk of future
injury<00:06:01.190> so<00:06:01.460> we're<00:06:01.730> going<00:06:01.820> to<00:06:01.910> look<00:06:02.000> carefully

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:02.210 
injury so we're going to look carefully

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:04.150 
injury so we're going to look carefully
into<00:06:02.420> their<00:06:02.570> history<00:06:02.660> and<00:06:03.560> we<00:06:03.710> also<00:06:03.860> know<00:06:04.130> that

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:04.160 
into their history and we also know that

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.250 
into their history and we also know that
players<00:06:04.730> who<00:06:04.850> are<00:06:04.970> imbalanced<00:06:05.210> so<00:06:05.720> muscle

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:06.260 
players who are imbalanced so muscle

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:07.750 
players who are imbalanced so muscle
imbalances<00:06:06.710> or<00:06:06.770> certain<00:06:07.070> weaknesses<00:06:07.460> well

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:07.760 
imbalances or certain weaknesses well

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:09.340 
imbalances or certain weaknesses well
but<00:06:07.940> more<00:06:08.150> likely<00:06:08.360> to<00:06:08.510> have<00:06:08.600> future<00:06:08.990> injury

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:09.350 
but more likely to have future injury

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:11.440 
but more likely to have future injury
it's<00:06:09.950> really<00:06:10.370> about<00:06:10.550> what<00:06:10.820> the<00:06:10.850> club<00:06:11.240> and<00:06:11.390> the

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:11.450 
it's really about what the club and the

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:13.750 
it's really about what the club and the
manager<00:06:11.840> want<00:06:12.080> so<00:06:12.440> if<00:06:12.530> the<00:06:12.680> club<00:06:13.160> and<00:06:13.430> the

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:13.760 
manager want so if the club and the

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:15.670 
manager want so if the club and the
manager<00:06:14.150> wants<00:06:14.420> a<00:06:14.480> player<00:06:14.750> who<00:06:14.930> is<00:06:14.960> completely

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:15.680 
manager wants a player who is completely

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.190 
manager wants a player who is completely
fit<00:06:15.950> with<00:06:16.370> no<00:06:16.610> risk<00:06:16.910> at<00:06:17.060> all<00:06:17.240> then<00:06:17.930> that's

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:18.200 
fit with no risk at all then that's

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:19.600 
fit with no risk at all then that's
going<00:06:18.350> to<00:06:18.410> be<00:06:18.470> quite<00:06:18.710> difficult<00:06:19.040> particularly

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:19.610 
going to be quite difficult particularly

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:22.210 
going to be quite difficult particularly
once<00:06:19.910> players<00:06:20.180> get<00:06:20.510> past<00:06:20.870> a<00:06:21.050> certain<00:06:21.260> age<00:06:21.530> for

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:22.220 
once players get past a certain age for

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:23.620 
once players get past a certain age for
