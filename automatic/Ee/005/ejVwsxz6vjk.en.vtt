00:00:08.869 --> 00:00:10.119
 Hi all 

00:00:10.119 --> 00:00:17.130
 I'm the gargar 900 I'm going to teach you how to activate windows 7 2nd simple 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.130
 with the evaluated windows I always said that 

00:00:20.669 --> 00:00:24.419
 The first thing to do is jessica mere flors 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:26.569
 it is desirable in download 

00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:29.569
 in reception of the video 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:33.660
 then 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.700
 As the theme of this page, only what you want remains 

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:40.720
 A) Yes 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:44.410
 downloads the file phrases like 45 seconds 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.510
 wait is expected is expected 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:07.820
 good once the shot has passed 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.820
 they put the unloading road 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.900
 and then burn turan chivos age 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.300
 maxi erase only then sands 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.320
 and you'll have it compressed 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.320
 one help that explains the fact is to bring here 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.430
 he wants you all 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.540
 once you have it already 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.540
 what you hear as administrator 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:38.530
 you wait for a moment 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:41.960
 in that window all you have to do is 

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.960
 judicial or do 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.250
 active flowers 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.810
 p load some things this may have started 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.370
 since it is starting I restart windows 7 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.450
 it will seem to you as if you had two operating systems 

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.439
 of the attack and steven loaded circuit I think it says 

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:10.769
 you get 

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:13.359
 once it ceases inside 

00:02:13.359 --> 00:02:16.359
 what happens in others with that other program 

00:02:19.899 --> 00:02:23.109
 and where you certify ado you put 

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:26.419
 when activating 

00:02:26.419 --> 00:02:29.369
 sntp ariza I think 

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:31.299
 I recommend that you restart 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:35.010
 and the initial rebound moment I will appear to you as your subjects 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.010
 operatives that will appear 1 

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:40.269
 then you go 

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:43.269
 to your control panel and 

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:47.159
 i will notice 

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:50.159
 that was going 7 is activated 

00:02:51.419 --> 00:02:54.419
 you will not have problems with updates or anything like that 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:02:56.849
 good 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:01.249
