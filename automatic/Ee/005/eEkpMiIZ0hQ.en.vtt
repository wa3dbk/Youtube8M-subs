know<00:00:16.440> he's<00:00:16.560> been<00:00:16.680> discarded<00:00:16.980> so<00:00:17.250> he<00:00:17.310> was<00:00:17.760> the

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
know he's been discarded so he was the

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:18.920 
know he's been discarded so he was the
sound<00:00:18.060> of<00:00:18.119> like<00:00:18.240> but<00:00:18.420> I<00:00:18.449> think<00:00:18.660> it's<00:00:18.779> been

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
sound of like but I think it's been

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.500 
sound of like but I think it's been
discarded<00:00:19.199> and<00:00:19.470> then<00:00:20.189> first<00:00:21.090> play<00:00:21.240> which<00:00:21.390> I've

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
discarded and then first play which I've

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.140 
discarded and then first play which I've
always<00:00:21.660> anakata<00:00:22.170> 12k<00:00:22.769> using<00:00:23.369> a<00:00:23.490> really<00:00:23.850> decent

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
always anakata 12k using a really decent

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.839 
always anakata 12k using a really decent
formation<00:00:24.720> 43<00:00:25.260> 1<00:00:25.410> so<00:00:25.590> we<00:00:25.680> shall<00:00:25.830> give<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.160> 15k

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
formation 43 1 so we shall give the 15k

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.660 
formation 43 1 so we shall give the 15k
hopefully<00:00:27.330> that's<00:00:28.230> you<00:00:28.710> know<00:00:28.830> basically<00:00:29.429> just

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
hopefully that's you know basically just

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.160 
hopefully that's you know basically just
went<00:00:29.789> for<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.060> cheap<00:00:30.090> informs<00:00:30.630> in<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.840> subset

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
went for the cheap informs in the subset

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.229 
went for the cheap informs in the subset
and<00:00:31.349> stick<00:00:31.679> them<00:00:31.769> all<00:00:31.859> up<00:00:32.040> board<00:00:32.279> I'll

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
and stick them all up board I'll

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:34.430 
and stick them all up board I'll
probably<00:00:33.540> stick<00:00:33.840> them<00:00:33.930> all<00:00:33.960> up<00:00:34.110> for<00:00:34.230> a<00:00:34.290> day

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
probably stick them all up for a day

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.200 
probably stick them all up for a day
just<00:00:34.500> so<00:00:34.829> they<00:00:34.980> sell<00:00:35.160> overnight<00:00:35.550> and<00:00:35.790> then

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
just so they sell overnight and then

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.900 
just so they sell overnight and then
probably<00:00:36.960> the<00:00:37.260> worst<00:00:37.530> deal<00:00:37.770> of<00:00:37.920> this<00:00:38.070> episode

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
probably the worst deal of this episode

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.840 
probably the worst deal of this episode
is<00:00:39.030> called<00:00:39.180> azo<00:00:39.570> example<00:00:40.230> and<00:00:40.350> poor<00:00:40.850> 17,500

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
is called azo example and poor 17,500

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.700 
is called azo example and poor 17,500
