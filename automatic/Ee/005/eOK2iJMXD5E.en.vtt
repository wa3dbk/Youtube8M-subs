in to attack the caravan and they are

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:25.070 
in to attack the caravan and they are

unable to defend them from it but again
I<00:05:25.470> still<00:05:26.040> think<00:05:26.340> it's<00:05:26.610> just<00:05:26.910> a<00:05:27.000> wee<00:05:27.210> bit<00:05:27.240> of<00:05:27.510> a

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:27.750 
I still think it's just a wee bit of a

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:30.200 
I still think it's just a wee bit of a
bug<00:05:28.020> and<00:05:28.229> that<00:05:28.410> does<00:05:28.740> tend<00:05:29.100> to<00:05:29.250> be<00:05:29.400> rather<00:05:29.940> a

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.210 
bug and that does tend to be rather a

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:32.930 
bug and that does tend to be rather a
lot<00:05:30.479> still<00:05:30.750> on<00:05:30.900> the<00:05:31.410> PTR<00:05:31.800> warlocks<00:05:32.430> have

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:32.940 
lot still on the PTR warlocks have

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.659 
lot still on the PTR warlocks have
plenty<00:05:33.570> vanishing<00:05:34.140> pets<00:05:34.440> and<00:05:34.680> also<00:05:35.430> this

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:35.669 
plenty vanishing pets and also this

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:37.880 
plenty vanishing pets and also this
horrible<00:05:36.360> tweak<00:05:36.690> which<00:05:37.200> they've<00:05:37.440> made<00:05:37.650> to

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:37.890 
horrible tweak which they've made to

00:05:37.890 --> 00:05:40.130 
horrible tweak which they've made to
fire<00:05:38.100> and<00:05:38.250> brimstone<00:05:38.430> as<00:05:38.910> well<00:05:39.120> but<00:05:39.690> it's<00:05:39.840> not

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:40.140 
fire and brimstone as well but it's not

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.590 
fire and brimstone as well but it's not
just<00:05:40.560> that<00:05:40.620> that's<00:05:41.280> had<00:05:41.490> a<00:05:41.520> few<00:05:41.789> changes<00:05:42.060> it's

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:42.600 
just that that's had a few changes it's

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.469 
just that that's had a few changes it's
also<00:05:43.050> my<00:05:43.890> youtube<00:05:44.700> channel<00:05:44.729> I've<00:05:45.210> actually

00:05:45.469 --> 00:05:45.479 
also my youtube channel I've actually

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:48.170 
also my youtube channel I've actually
reverted<00:05:46.320> back<00:05:46.350> to<00:05:46.560> the<00:05:46.800> old<00:05:46.979> style<00:05:47.310> because<00:05:48.090> I

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:48.180 
reverted back to the old style because I

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:50.120 
reverted back to the old style because I
tend<00:05:48.479> to<00:05:48.660> find<00:05:48.810> it<00:05:49.020> seems<00:05:49.289> to<00:05:49.470> work<00:05:49.620> a<00:05:49.830> lot

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:50.130 
tend to find it seems to work a lot

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:52.670 
tend to find it seems to work a lot
better<00:05:50.340> for<00:05:50.789> me<00:05:51.030> and<00:05:51.240> not<00:05:51.690> only<00:05:52.140> have<00:05:52.320> I<00:05:52.410> added

00:05:52.670 --> 00:05:52.680 
better for me and not only have I added

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:55.400 
better for me and not only have I added
