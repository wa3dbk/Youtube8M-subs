00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:06.240
 good two kids exist all in another 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.339
 more video as well as announced by 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.990
 twitter well I already asked what better than 

00:00:08.339 --> 00:00:15.809
 well the next review then it came out 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.340
 this suárez of which ruffa that has 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:22.710
 made a review also makes 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:24.910
 the other two days Saturday or Sunday 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:29.260
 it was Sunday it was shopping day 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:32.140
 media suárez is but as everyone gives their 

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:34.420
 I say that everyone gives their point 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.339
 of the player's view 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.280
 and I think with work together of you 

00:00:36.339 --> 00:00:42.339
 attacking the same player the better the better 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:44.589
 You can think of the option to buy it 

00:00:42.339 --> 00:00:46.870
 the truth stressed is pretty good if 

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:48.310
 you want truth and I really do not have 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:52.840
 no problem 

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:55.480
 and I have here goes the hand 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:58.390
 unusual is a player that right now 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.040
 it is fashionable that is to say this year it has 

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:03.309
 It paints to get many reports 

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:07.420
 because in real life it is in a form 

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:10.840
 great this is the scorer if it 's the 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:13.090
 scorer of he is fit and that way 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:16.460
 the cde makes the team to liverpool 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:18.380
 it makes it fit and good 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.840
 within the game is a player who 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:24.080
 truth stands out more than anything for its 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:28.340
 agility and for his dribble is a player 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:30.020
 that to dribble is going very well 

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.590
 I'm already looking around here about these 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:36.289
 has has one has a control of 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.090
 very good ball a perfect dribbling and 

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:39.890
 what I like most about these games is 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:43.909
 a luxo I want to tell you have a shot 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:45.619
 distant very good but yes but nothing 

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:48.740
 it's bad making quality shots or 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:51.619
 shots from near the goal is more 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.479
 this is a player that from the edge 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:56.119
 of the area if you have space is a game 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:57.439
 lethal 90 percent of the shots that 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:01:59.869
 do from the edge of the area of 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:04.030
 space is goal because he has a shot with 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:04.030
 a lot of power very well placed 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.649
 and that his triple that has 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.770
 makes it easy enough to stay alone 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:15.450
 the edges of the area 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:17.340
 has four bad leg which 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.769
 I could even have three I do not know 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:23.870
 wants to say to me the chcho shots that the 

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:23.870
 bad leg I have not finished liking 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.150
 has some shots 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:34.250
 but good is a game the era 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:36.050
 physically very complete has one has 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.540
 a good acceleration may be your 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:41.000
 strong point because the sprint is not 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.370
 too much and as soon as you put the 22 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.280
 play is good the other player gets to 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.700
 the top speed is quite likely 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.500
 that the scope 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:55.069
 Regarding forces because it's not going to be left over 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:57.319
 of force means not bad but not 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:03:00.260
 it is its strong, much less 

00:02:57.319 --> 00:03:02.389
 its strong is to imagine that it is a player 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:06.200
 very technical as he said ruth is a 

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:09.650
 dribble player to be to protect 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:12.349
 the ball et cetera etcetera and good to me 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.840
 I liked a lot is like you know 26 

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:17.599
 match 19 goals in the last matches 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.760
 that we have is not that I have bad game is 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:23.419
 that I have not been very truthful 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.889
 but sincerely, it seems to me 

00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:28.500
 a very complete player quite 

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:30.690
 full a very pretty forward 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.730
 quite does not become the super 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:36.180
 front but it's a forward that's going to 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:38.670
 perform very well on how I want to 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:41.100
 say they will see all the balls towards 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:44.600
 he's going to have possession he's going to have the 

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.600
 possibility of speaking and other 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:51.060
 good more than anything is a great hunter is 

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:52.379
 a playmaker also because the 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.480
 they create but they see they cook it and they eat it 

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:57.110
 he means he takes care of the play but 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:57.110
 for the same 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:03.159
 he is a player that his strong one is the shot 

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:07.180
 has a very good shot defines very well 

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:09.969
 the usually place the time 6 goes 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:13.709
 and it's got a shot from the edges of the 

00:04:09.969 --> 00:04:16.180
 very very own area very beast to me 

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:17.690
 because for my style of play I 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.299
 love 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:22.550
 maybe I could have tried it in some 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:25.940
 another formation but in this flame gone 

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:27.950
 alright so help us 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:30.380
 surely this player gets many 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:32.160
 reports this year because it was a 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:35.910
 incredible way 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:37.800
 if you want to say take them out also 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:38.970
 You can buy extra coins in 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:40.200
 When a report is made, I understand 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:42.600
 because this player 

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:46.220
 enough the report aims for I believe I 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:48.150
 good and good for me part of the addition 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:51.480
 tell you that he is a player that I recommend 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:52.740
 very well recommended is going very well going to 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.720
 pay 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:56.940
 if your game style this plan is 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:59.730
 say have control of the ball and 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:01.529
 move with the player van is going to come 

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:05.729
 deluxe 

00:05:01.529 --> 00:05:08.039
 and little else I do not recommend it 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:10.529
 and nothing more to say I hope that I have 

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:13.309
 liked and I leave you with the goals 

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:13.309
 other goodbye 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:37.470
 and what ends could be like that they want more 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:47.960
 crying 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:47.960
 if you think if you want to rather think 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:58.430
 myself 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:12.420
 and finally 

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:12.420
 it's like that 

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:17.990
 no no 

00:06:22.669 --> 00:06:26.150
 I dont know 

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:32.570
 no no no 

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:47.690
 it does not seem 

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:19.810
 because you see 

00:07:12.700 --> 00:07:22.810
 I would go back you know the pocket and asia in 

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:22.810
 consonance
