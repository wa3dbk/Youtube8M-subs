00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.990
 I share video makeup that 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.230
 I love is the newt makeup 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.119
 neutral colors that mimic colors in 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.609
 the skin tones to create the 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.789
 natural and almost almost perfect symbol that 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.710
 is already in all fashion magazines and 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.410
 has also been in the salt put red 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.260
 with the celebrity action they have looked at 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:34.020
 all sides and you and I can have that 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.450
 same look with a simple palette that 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.300
 is in all the brands that have this 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.550
 version of shadows and a makeup on 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:46.520
 youtube so do not miss out and 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.520
 we begin welcome to total beauty 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.240
 and well this is the true face without 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:52.280
 makeup 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:55.280
 obviously already prepared to apply 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.930
 All products moisturized with a 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.970
 little bit of prime air than in another video 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.610
 I'm going to suck the step number one is 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:03.920
 apply me this first white super clear 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:06.260
 that I will leave the description in the 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.180
 video where to get it I like it like that 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.400
 apply two light colors as a base 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:13.430
 because it allows me to highlight better the 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.970
 super clear colors I apply it in everything 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:15.970
 eyelid 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:22.750
 for this makeup I wanted to show you 

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:26.390
 my favorite palette of these times is 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:28.610
 natural so it's called the mix cosmetics 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.530
 that I think is already in 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.990
 Peru and can acquire it in the 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.630
 department stores but also 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.550
 You can use another type of pallets 

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:40.190
 other brands but this one I love because 

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:43.160
 has melon color has paste in a 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:45.890
 Intense brown is perfect for a look 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:50.100
 nude and melon color is from the first 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:52.590
 color that I'm going to apply on the eyelid 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.119
 every idea is makeup something very 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.159
 important in newt makeup is 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.890
 create naturalness and I will create 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.350
 transition between colors using by 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.680
 example this medium brown in the basin 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:08.220
 of the eye to go marking more the 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:11.730
 look but in a subtle way to create 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:14.489
 that transition I use brushes in shape 

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:17.430
 round to be able to blend well 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:21.480
 those colors for natural looks the 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:23.130
 blurring is very important when 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.569
 let's work with light colors, it's always 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.420
 good to have in our cake 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:30.330
 skewers that routine that we only use 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:33.090
 to be smudged and not to stain and 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.550
 be easy to use it the third color is 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.670
 this darker brown that will give me 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:41.410
 intensity the look placed it on the 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:44.590
 corner in the eye socket 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.770
 with small touches of fine the way that 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:51.580
 I want to give the eye that it's a little 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:53.710
 almond trees and blurred to die not 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:56.290
 worry about the color expansion 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:58.210
 then we fix it with base this palette 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:00.730
 It has a light color like a white 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:03.130
 white bone smoke and I'll place it in 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:06.970
 the eyebrow bone below the eyebrow 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:09.160
 so that I enlighten more the look then 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:10.900
 I will apply a small is 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.350
 Chartists who also comes in the same 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.350
 palette 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:20.379
 the eye outlined it with a colored pencil 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:23.230
 brown coffee because obviously we are 

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:26.349
 creating a nude look and then what 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:29.920
 Blurred with a flat skewer to 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:32.290
 then apply dark shadow the same 

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:34.870
 that we use in the corners and basins of 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:38.769
 eye this makes it last much longer 

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:42.489
 makeup and the marking is subtle my 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:44.950
 I left my eyebrows for halfway 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:46.780
 to be able to mark them much better than 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.879
 according to the intensity that I give to 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:53.230
 makeup the order of the factors not 

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:55.000
 alter the product remember use for 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.129
 The whole face is pib and clean that I 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.109
 they love in marc because it also has 

00:03:57.129 --> 00:04:01.690
 sunscreen and other nutrients for 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:03.370
 the ideal skin to use it in the day to 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:05.860
 day 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:09.459
 he also helps me with my putt and blender 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:12.250
 to be able to diffuse and spread better 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:14.560
 I saw horsehair all over my face do not forget 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:16.709
 of the neck should also use this 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:19.540
 because remember that abel and cain have 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:21.980
 properties that help us improve and 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:25.400
 take care of the skin every day 

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:27.260
 my loose covergirl bedside powder 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:30.560
 all makeup is a color 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:32.800
 obviously very similar to the tone of my 

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.800
 skin 

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:46.790
 and as a final part of the make-up of 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:50.960
 eyes comb the eyelashes the curl and the 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:53.600
 best eyelash mask gives me that 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:58.370
 big eye effect false eyelashes 

00:04:53.600 --> 00:05:00.620
 that is the big eyes of mailing for me is 

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:03.770
 one of the best eyelash masks 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:06.950
 that I have tried recommended fulfilled the 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:10.670
 Newt makeup of eyes and face with 

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:12.200
 lips also in matt with the product 

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:15.320
 soft matt 

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:18.380
 green the mix that you can already find 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:20.600
 also in Peru it is excellent because 

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:24.260
 give that kind texture like butter 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:26.900
 I have this cocoa cream on my lips 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:29.090
 team of blas and also what serves me 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:32.150
 as a facial contour he mixed them some 

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:33.830
 rosaditos colors and also tanned and 

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:37.000
 I take the opportunity not only to color the 

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:39.340
 energy but also outline the face 

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:43.030
 and you're ready and you're like that we have a look 

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:45.100
 completely newt marked the look without

 so much makeup and especially natural 

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:50.400
 for many girls who fear the 

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:52.780
 makeup and the colors ideal for 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.950

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:56.640

00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:03.580
 it shows the difference is true 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:04.060
 but without exaggerating respecting our 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:07.240
 colors 

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:10.860
