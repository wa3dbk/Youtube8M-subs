00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.519 
breathe make let's have a look at it
exactly<00:00:28.769> so<00:00:29.010> so<00:00:29.550> as<00:00:29.789> you<00:00:30.119> know<00:00:30.300> humour<00:00:31.230> tends

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
exactly so so as you know humour tends

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.350 
exactly so so as you know humour tends
to<00:00:31.769> follow<00:00:31.920> the<00:00:32.099> trends<00:00:32.669> and<00:00:32.759> changes<00:00:32.969> in<00:00:33.270> the

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
to follow the trends and changes in the

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.650 
to follow the trends and changes in the
DJ<00:00:33.660> industry<00:00:34.140> and<00:00:34.850> they<00:00:35.850> set<00:00:36.149> the<00:00:36.239> standard

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
DJ industry and they set the standard

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:37.850 
DJ industry and they set the standard
perhaps<00:00:37.020> for<00:00:37.260> some<00:00:37.410> of<00:00:37.500> the<00:00:37.559> things<00:00:37.770> that

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
perhaps for some of the things that

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.040 
perhaps for some of the things that
happen<00:00:38.250> out<00:00:38.370> there<00:00:38.579> so<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:39.270> Mixtrack<00:00:39.629> 3

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
happen out there so the Mixtrack 3

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.540 
happen out there so the Mixtrack 3
doesn't<00:00:40.530> disappoint<00:00:40.860> in<00:00:41.040> that<00:00:41.160> case<00:00:41.399> the

over here out of my independence
transport<00:00:52.890> controls<00:00:53.219> and<00:00:53.460> I<00:00:53.520> can<00:00:53.670> fly<00:00:53.760> a

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
transport controls and I can fly a

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.110 
transport controls and I can fly a
little<00:00:54.030> bit<00:00:54.180> a<00:00:54.530> filtering<00:00:55.730> so<00:00:56.730> I<00:00:56.760> have<00:00:57.059> a

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
little bit a filtering so I have a

strip<00:00:59.879> in<00:01:00.660> addition<00:01:01.199> to<00:01:01.410> that<00:01:01.649> I<00:01:01.890> have<00:01:02.309> metal

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
strip in addition to that I have metal

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.329 
strip in addition to that I have metal
wheels<00:01:03.059> we<00:01:03.809> are<00:01:03.870> taking<00:01:04.260> from<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.710> env<00:01:05.129> that's

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
wheels we are taking from the env that's

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.980 
wheels we are taking from the env that's
over<00:01:05.610> here<00:01:05.820> so<00:01:06.090> we<00:01:06.210> have<00:01:06.360> we've<00:01:06.780> basically

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
over here so we have we've basically

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.510 
over here so we have we've basically
taken<00:01:07.229> from<00:01:07.830> some<00:01:08.189> of<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.310> higher-end

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
taken from some of the higher-end

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.670 
taken from some of the higher-end
products<00:01:09.240> that<00:01:09.390> we've<00:01:09.510> created<00:01:09.750> and<00:01:10.470> brought

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
products that we've created and brought

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.350 
products that we've created and brought
it<00:01:10.770> down<00:01:10.799> to<00:01:11.130> this<00:01:11.250> level<00:01:11.460> of<00:01:11.670> controller<00:01:12.060> so

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
it down to this level of controller so

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.179 
it down to this level of controller so
metal<00:01:12.720> wheels<00:01:12.900> on<00:01:13.140> it<00:01:13.170> that<00:01:13.439> I<00:01:13.500> can<00:01:13.650> scratch<00:01:13.890> on

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
metal wheels on it that I can scratch on

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.270 
metal wheels on it that I can scratch on
I<00:01:14.430> also<00:01:15.330> have<00:01:15.689> 100<00:01:16.200> millimeter<00:01:16.590> pitch<00:01:16.830> sliders

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
I also have 100 millimeter pitch sliders

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.770 
I also have 100 millimeter pitch sliders
over<00:01:17.549> here<00:01:17.700> so<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:17.909> 100<00:01:18.210> millimeter<00:01:18.570> pitch

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
over here so the 100 millimeter pitch

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.320 
over here so the 100 millimeter pitch
slider<00:01:19.130> is<00:01:20.130> great<00:01:20.580> because<00:01:20.939> it<00:01:21.090> gives<00:01:21.240> you

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
slider is great because it gives you

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.060 
slider is great because it gives you
full<00:01:21.630> control<00:01:21.840> over<00:01:22.470> the<00:01:22.619> track<00:01:22.860> that's

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
full control over the track that's

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.800 
full control over the track that's
playing<00:01:23.369> now<00:01:24.060> like<00:01:24.240> I<00:01:24.390> said<00:01:24.450> there's

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
playing now like I said there's

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.450 
playing now like I said there's
independent<00:01:25.409> transport<00:01:25.860> controls<00:01:26.250> here

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
independent transport controls here

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.070 
independent transport controls here
three<00:01:26.729> separate<00:01:27.090> for<00:01:27.330> play<00:01:27.479> pause<00:01:27.689> and<00:01:27.720> cue

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
three separate for play pause and cue

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.140 
three separate for play pause and cue
but<00:01:28.560> there's<00:01:28.710> also<00:01:28.920> eight<00:01:29.310> pads<00:01:29.549> next<00:01:29.970> to<00:01:30.060> it

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:30.150 
but there's also eight pads next to it

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:31.609 
but there's also eight pads next to it
they<00:01:30.240> aren't<00:01:30.509> integrated<00:01:30.990> it's<00:01:31.079> completely

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
they aren't integrated it's completely

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.859 
they aren't integrated it's completely
separated<00:01:32.280> so<00:01:32.729> I<00:01:32.759> always<00:01:33.090> have<00:01:33.329> access<00:01:33.479> to<00:01:33.689> my

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
separated so I always have access to my

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.170 
separated so I always have access to my
hot<00:01:34.049> cues<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:34.860> on<00:01:34.979> my<00:01:35.070> top<00:01:35.340> row<00:01:35.579> of<00:01:35.610> pads<00:01:35.939> up

on this top you're going to see that

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.789 
on this top you're going to see that
there's<00:01:47.549> the<00:01:48.360> touch<00:01:48.540> strip<00:01:48.720> same<00:01:49.409> touch<00:01:49.619> strip

there's the touch strip same touch strip

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.679 
there's the touch strip same touch strip
that<00:01:50.009> we<00:01:50.070> use<00:01:50.189> on<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.369> ns7<00:01:50.850> same<00:01:51.329> trips<00:01:51.540> and

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
that we use on the ns7 same trips and

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.510 
that we use on the ns7 same trips and
the<00:01:51.750> no7<00:01:52.170> too<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:52.470> all<00:01:52.560> that<00:01:52.770> but<00:01:53.220> it's<00:01:53.369> being

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
the no7 too and all that but it's being

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.850 
the no7 too and all that but it's being
used<00:01:53.729> for<00:01:53.850> effects<00:01:54.210> in<00:01:54.420> this<00:01:54.509> case<00:01:54.810> so<00:01:55.439> when<00:01:55.829> I

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
used for effects in this case so when I

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.780 
used for effects in this case so when I
have<00:01:56.100> my<00:01:56.219> track<00:01:56.490> playing

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:57.790 
have my track playing

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.670 
have my track playing
and<00:01:57.880> looks<00:01:58.540> like<00:01:58.600> I<00:01:58.750> grabbed<00:01:58.990> a<00:01:59.140> scratch<00:01:59.380> track

00:01:59.670 --> 00:01:59.680 
and looks like I grabbed a scratch track

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.980 
and looks like I grabbed a scratch track
here<00:01:59.890> but<00:02:00.070> we'll<00:02:00.220> just<00:02:00.370> add<00:02:00.490> a<00:02:00.520> little<00:02:00.990> little

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
here but we'll just add a little little

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:03.450 
here but we'll just add a little little
effect<00:02:02.260> to<00:02:02.410> that<00:02:02.560> so<00:02:02.740> just<00:02:02.770> by<00:02:03.010> touching<00:02:03.250> you

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
effect to that so just by touching you

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.310 
effect to that so just by touching you
can<00:02:03.610> see<00:02:03.730> on<00:02:03.850> the<00:02:03.940> screen<00:02:04.050> that<00:02:05.050> we're<00:02:05.200> moving

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:05.320 
can see on the screen that we're moving

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.530 
can see on the screen that we're moving
the<00:02:05.530> effect<00:02:05.860> back<00:02:06.070> and<00:02:06.310> forth<00:02:06.520> and<00:02:07.360> then<00:02:07.480> we

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:07.540 
the effect back and forth and then we

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.400 
the effect back and forth and then we
can<00:02:07.660> turn<00:02:07.750> it<00:02:07.900> off<00:02:08.020> again<00:02:08.200> so<00:02:09.810> so<00:02:10.810> this<00:02:11.110> is<00:02:11.170> the

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
can turn it off again so so this is the

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:14.490 
can turn it off again so so this is the
Mixtrack<00:02:11.980> Pro<00:02:12.100> 3<00:02:12.820> and<00:02:13.420> like<00:02:13.780> I<00:02:13.930> said<00:02:14.200> it's<00:02:14.440> very

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
Mixtrack Pro 3 and like I said it's very

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.380 
Mixtrack Pro 3 and like I said it's very
similar<00:02:14.980> to<00:02:15.100> the<00:02:15.280> env<00:02:15.550> it's<00:02:15.700> the<00:02:15.820> same<00:02:16.090> width

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:16.390 
similar to the env it's the same width

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.960 
similar to the env it's the same width
it<00:02:16.630> has<00:02:16.810> same<00:02:17.770> wheels<00:02:18.070> and<00:02:18.400> things<00:02:18.550> like<00:02:18.700> that

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
it has same wheels and things like that

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.120 
it has same wheels and things like that
at<00:02:19.480> a<00:02:19.540> much<00:02:19.810> more<00:02:20.080> affordable<00:02:20.410> price<00:02:20.680> in<00:02:21.040> the

can<00:02:37.630> I<00:02:37.720> just<00:02:37.870> point<00:02:38.080> out<00:02:38.230> something<00:02:38.560> I<00:02:38.650> think

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
can I just point out something I think

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:41.100 
can I just point out something I think

now<00:02:52.810> there's<00:02:52.989> only<00:02:53.080> one<00:02:53.200> level<00:02:53.620> moving<00:02:53.800> up<00:02:53.950> and

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
now there's only one level moving up and

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:55.229 
now there's only one level moving up and
down<00:02:54.160> here<00:02:54.430> is<00:02:54.520> that<00:02:54.550> because<00:02:54.880> there's<00:02:55.060> some

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
down here is that because there's some

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:57.270 
down here is that because there's some
kind<00:02:55.420> of<00:02:55.480> cue<00:02:55.720> metering<00:02:56.230> as<00:02:56.320> well<00:02:56.500> or<00:02:56.830> is<00:02:57.160> that

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
kind of cue metering as well or is that

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.729 
kind of cue metering as well or is that
because<00:02:58.350> some<00:02:59.350> other<00:02:59.470> reason<00:03:00.060> there's<00:03:01.060> only

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
because some other reason there's only

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:03.720 
because some other reason there's only
one<00:03:02.739> level<00:03:02.980> moving<00:03:03.310> up<00:03:03.430> and<00:03:03.519> down<00:03:03.640> because

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
one level moving up and down because

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:05.490 
one level moving up and down because
maybe<00:03:04.030> that<00:03:04.120> track<00:03:04.510> is<00:03:04.720> only<00:03:04.870> mono<00:03:05.140> on<00:03:05.350> one

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
maybe that track is only mono on one

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.009 
maybe that track is only mono on one
side<00:03:05.739> perhaps<00:03:06.100> I<00:03:06.310> could<00:03:06.489> be<00:03:06.820> Bebek<00:03:07.450> just<00:03:07.810> name

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
side perhaps I could be Bebek just name

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:09.900 
side perhaps I could be Bebek just name
just<00:03:08.440> just<00:03:08.739> test<00:03:08.950> it<00:03:09.100> crisp<00:03:09.310> I'll<00:03:09.550> check<00:03:09.730> err

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:09.910 
just just test it crisp I'll check err

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:16.120 
just just test it crisp I'll check err
on<00:03:09.940> it<00:03:10.239> ok<00:03:10.630> let's<00:03:10.840> move<00:03:11.019> on<00:03:11.170> to<00:03:11.230> the<00:03:11.440> next<00:03:11.590> one

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:20.140 

all<00:03:16.700> righty<00:03:17.060> so<00:03:17.330> this<00:03:17.570> is<00:03:17.870> the<00:03:18.110> Mixtrack<00:03:19.150> three

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
all righty so this is the Mixtrack three

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.210 
all righty so this is the Mixtrack three
and<00:03:20.780> on<00:03:20.960> the<00:03:21.080> Mixtrack<00:03:21.380> three<00:03:21.830> it's<00:03:22.010> very

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
and on the Mixtrack three it's very

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.360 
and on the Mixtrack three it's very
similar<00:03:22.550> to<00:03:22.730> the<00:03:22.940> Mixtrack<00:03:23.330> Pro<00:03:23.420> three<00:03:24.370> where

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
similar to the Mixtrack Pro three where

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.280 
similar to the Mixtrack Pro three where
it<00:03:25.490> has<00:03:25.580> the<00:03:25.670> same<00:03:25.910> shape<00:03:26.180> and<00:03:26.660> size<00:03:26.720> same
