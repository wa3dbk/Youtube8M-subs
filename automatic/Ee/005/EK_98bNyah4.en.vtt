00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
rook to f8 but the one thing that I

rook to f8 but the one thing that I
wanted<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.540> think<00:01:07.170> about<00:01:07.500> here<00:01:07.890> is<00:01:08.040> that<00:01:08.670> if

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
wanted to think about here is that if

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.300 
wanted to think about here is that if
black<00:01:09.240> could<00:01:09.570> only<00:01:09.750> skip<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.350> move<00:01:10.530> and<00:01:10.800> don't

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
black could only skip the move and don't

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.030 
black could only skip the move and don't
make<00:01:11.490> anything<00:01:12.060> in<00:01:12.350> that<00:01:13.350> case<00:01:13.650> there<00:01:13.890> would

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
make anything in that case there would

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.200 
make anything in that case there would
be<00:01:14.070> no<00:01:14.430> way<00:01:14.670> for<00:01:14.700> white<00:01:15.120> to<00:01:15.540> get<00:01:15.659> any<00:01:15.960> progress

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
be no way for white to get any progress

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
the rook itself does not have enough

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
situation would happen if white has a

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.700 
situation would happen if white has a
bishop<00:01:27.270> and<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.540> night<00:01:27.720> against<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.380> lonely

King again you can win only because of

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
the tube fun because your opponent has

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.240 
the tube fun because your opponent has
to<00:01:33.000> play<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.390> move<00:01:33.690> without<00:01:34.500> that<00:01:34.770> your

straight<00:01:41.640> with<00:01:41.790> these<00:01:41.940> examples<00:01:43.700> I'm<00:01:44.700> simply

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:45.240 
straight with these examples I'm simply

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.480 
straight with these examples I'm simply
saying<00:01:45.420> that<00:01:45.660> in<00:01:46.080> an<00:01:46.200> endgame<00:01:46.440> you<00:01:46.890> don't<00:01:47.190> have

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
saying that in an endgame you don't have

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.140 
saying that in an endgame you don't have
enough<00:01:48.060> this<00:01:48.690> is<00:01:48.750> enough<00:01:49.230> power<00:01:49.560> to<00:01:49.980> play<00:01:50.880> for

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:51.150 
enough this is enough power to play for

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:53.720 
enough this is enough power to play for
mate<00:01:51.390> these<00:01:52.290> plans<00:01:52.620> simply<00:01:52.980> does<00:01:53.220> not<00:01:53.250> work

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:53.730 
mate these plans simply does not work

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.600 
mate these plans simply does not work
we<00:01:54.480> have<00:01:54.660> analyzed<00:01:55.020> three<00:01:55.440> situations<00:01:55.980> in<00:01:56.160> all

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
we have analyzed three situations in all

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.120 
we have analyzed three situations in all
of<00:01:56.760> them<00:01:56.940> Whiteside<00:01:57.900> had<00:01:58.230> great<00:01:58.710> material

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
of them Whiteside had great material

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:00.860 
of them Whiteside had great material
advantage<00:01:59.550> like<00:02:00.030> when<00:02:00.210> you<00:02:00.300> have<00:02:00.510> a<00:02:00.540> whole

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:00.870 
advantage like when you have a whole

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.380 
advantage like when you have a whole
rook<00:02:01.200> or<00:02:01.380> two<00:02:01.830> minor<00:02:02.040> pieces<00:02:02.370> and<00:02:02.760> in<00:02:03.270> all

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
rook or two minor pieces and in all

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.090 
rook or two minor pieces and in all
these<00:02:03.540> situations<00:02:04.080> sometimes<00:02:04.350> it's<00:02:04.770> just

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
these situations sometimes it's just

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.770 
these situations sometimes it's just
impossible<00:02:05.340> to<00:02:05.640> win<00:02:05.880> or<00:02:06.180> sometimes<00:02:06.630> it's

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
impossible to win or sometimes it's

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.150 
impossible to win or sometimes it's
pretty<00:02:07.020> difficult<00:02:07.200> and<00:02:07.560> you<00:02:07.620> can<00:02:07.770> do<00:02:07.890> it<00:02:08.009> only

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
pretty difficult and you can do it only

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:09.609 
pretty difficult and you can do it only
because<00:02:08.369> of<00:02:08.550> the<00:02:08.700> tube<00:02:08.910> top

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
because of the tube top

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.890 
because of the tube top
this<00:02:10.619> explains<00:02:11.099> why<00:02:11.400> in<00:02:11.879> an<00:02:12.000> endgame<00:02:12.239> you

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
this explains why in an endgame you

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.949 
this explains why in an endgame you
should<00:02:13.140> not<00:02:13.379> attack<00:02:13.950> opponents<00:02:14.340> King<00:02:14.959> this

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:15.959 
should not attack opponents King this

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:19.009 
should not attack opponents King this
plan<00:02:16.260> does<00:02:16.470> not<00:02:16.590> work<00:02:16.650> a<00:02:17.250> lot<00:02:18.209> of<00:02:18.330> players<00:02:18.569> do

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
plan does not work a lot of players do

don't<00:04:11.260> know<00:04:11.440> about<00:04:11.590> that<00:04:11.920> because<00:04:12.130> you<00:04:12.700> will

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:12.850 
don't know about that because you will

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:14.759 
don't know about that because you will
gain<00:04:13.090> a<00:04:13.150> lot<00:04:13.420> of<00:04:13.450> pleasant<00:04:13.930> victories<00:04:14.350> against

that<00:04:21.850> was<00:04:22.120> so<00:04:22.870> to<00:04:22.930> speak<00:04:23.260> an<00:04:23.500> introduction<00:04:24.400> I

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 
that was so to speak an introduction I

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.620 
that was so to speak an introduction I
see<00:04:27.010> the<00:04:27.280> new<00:04:27.400> question<00:04:27.850> from<00:04:28.000> a<00:04:28.060> student<00:04:28.150> he

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
see the new question from a student he

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.140 
see the new question from a student he
asks<00:04:29.350> when<00:04:30.010> does<00:04:30.250> the<00:04:30.370> middle<00:04:30.580> game<00:04:30.760> finish

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
asks when does the middle game finish

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.830 
asks when does the middle game finish
and<00:04:31.680> the<00:04:32.680> end<00:04:32.830> game<00:04:33.040> starts<00:04:33.490> well<00:04:34.450> a<00:04:34.479> little

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
and the end game starts well a little

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.500 
and the end game starts well a little
bit<00:04:34.990> primitive<00:04:35.470> but<00:04:35.710> in<00:04:36.370> very<00:04:36.760> most<00:04:36.970> cases<00:04:37.240> a

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
bit primitive but in very most cases a

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:40.110 
bit primitive but in very most cases a
true<00:04:37.810> answer<00:04:38.050> is<00:04:38.500> that<00:04:38.800> after<00:04:39.640> the<00:04:39.849> Queen's

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:40.120 
true answer is that after the Queen's

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:40.800 
true answer is that after the Queen's
are

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
are

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.140 
are
changed<00:04:41.139> of<00:04:41.320> course<00:04:42.160> it<00:04:42.520> depends<00:04:42.790> on<00:04:43.030> the

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
changed of course it depends on the

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.330 
changed of course it depends on the
overall<00:04:43.389> quantity<00:04:44.290> of<00:04:44.620> pieces<00:04:44.950> on<00:04:45.070> the<00:04:45.160> board

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
overall quantity of pieces on the board

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:49.379 
overall quantity of pieces on the board
and<00:04:45.700> it's<00:04:46.150> hard<00:04:46.510> to<00:04:46.570> say<00:04:46.840> a<00:04:47.139> very<00:04:48.389> specific

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:49.389 
and it's hard to say a very specific

00:04:49.389 --> 00:04:51.600 
and it's hard to say a very specific
answer<00:04:49.720> to<00:04:49.750> this<00:04:49.990> question<00:04:50.440> but<00:04:50.470> and<00:04:50.919> game<00:04:51.460> is

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.610 
answer to this question but and game is

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.940 
answer to this question but and game is
characterized<00:04:52.180> with<00:04:52.810> few<00:04:53.230> pieces<00:04:53.380> left<00:04:53.710> on

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:53.950 
characterized with few pieces left on

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:56.010 
characterized with few pieces left on
the<00:04:54.040> board<00:04:54.280> and<00:04:54.490> in<00:04:54.790> most<00:04:55.000> of<00:04:55.180> the<00:04:55.330> cases<00:04:55.540> it's

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.020 
the board and in most of the cases it's

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:57.870 
the board and in most of the cases it's
also<00:04:56.320> characterized<00:04:57.040> by<00:04:57.310> an<00:04:57.430> exchange<00:04:57.760> of

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 
also characterized by an exchange of

00:04:57.880 --> 00:04:59.850 
also characterized by an exchange of
queens<00:04:58.150> so<00:04:58.750> the<00:04:58.900> practical<00:04:59.260> answer<00:04:59.650> would<00:04:59.830> be

00:04:59.850 --> 00:04:59.860 
queens so the practical answer would be

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:02.340 
queens so the practical answer would be
most<00:05:00.220> of<00:05:00.340> the<00:05:00.460> cases<00:05:00.639> just<00:05:01.150> after<00:05:01.570> an<00:05:02.080> exchange

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:02.350 
most of the cases just after an exchange

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:06.030 
most of the cases just after an exchange
of<00:05:02.680> Queens<00:05:03.750> of<00:05:04.750> course<00:05:05.020> it<00:05:05.200> would<00:05:05.530> depend<00:05:05.740> on<00:05:05.889> a

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:06.040 
of Queens of course it would depend on a

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.940 
of Queens of course it would depend on a
specific<00:05:06.130> position<00:05:06.790> though
