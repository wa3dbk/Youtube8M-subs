00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:14.350 
carefully though because this part is

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:18.000 
carefully though because this part is
really<00:04:14.380> complicated<00:04:16.320> you<00:04:17.320> go<00:04:17.530> up<00:04:17.620> here<00:04:17.890> you

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
really complicated you go up here you

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:19.560 
really complicated you go up here you
see<00:04:18.250> where<00:04:18.489> I<00:04:18.549> day<00:04:18.610> they<00:04:18.880> just<00:04:19.090> went<00:04:19.299> north

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
see where I day they just went north

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:29.700 
see where I day they just went north
just<00:04:20.080> north<00:04:20.350> from<00:04:20.560> right<00:04:20.739> there<00:04:28.200> and<00:04:29.200> I<00:04:29.410> went

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
just north from right there and I went

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:41.640 
just north from right there and I went
up<00:04:29.890> to<00:04:30.250> the<00:04:31.180> right<00:04:36.480> over<00:04:37.480> that<00:04:40.470> they're<00:04:41.470> going

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
up to the right over that they're going

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:48.210 
up to the right over that they're going
to<00:04:41.770> want<00:04:41.860> to<00:04:41.980> go<00:04:42.040> down<00:04:42.280> here<00:04:47.100> probably<00:04:48.100> use

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:48.220 
to want to go down here probably use

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:50.730 
to want to go down here probably use
that<00:04:48.460> to<00:04:48.640> save<00:04:48.930> getting<00:04:49.930> cotton<00:04:50.320> and<00:04:50.560> grass

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:50.740 
that to save getting cotton and grass

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:53.130 
that to save getting cotton and grass
because<00:04:51.190> needs<00:04:51.820> amex<00:04:52.180> repel<00:04:52.570> doesn't<00:04:53.020> work

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:53.140 
because needs amex repel doesn't work

00:04:53.140 --> 00:05:37.659 
because needs amex repel doesn't work
for<00:04:53.440> all<00:04:53.530> grass

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:37.669 

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:41.150 

okay<00:05:38.669> now<00:05:39.000> here's<00:05:39.500> the<00:05:40.500> part<00:05:40.530> that's<00:05:40.979> more

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:41.160 
okay now here's the part that's more

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:44.180 
okay now here's the part that's more
difficult<00:05:41.310> so<00:05:42.260> you'll<00:05:43.260> be<00:05:43.410> right<00:05:43.620> here<00:05:43.950> and

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:46.710 
then do everything here like a noise and

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:48.920 
then do everything here like a noise and
your<00:05:47.130> game<00:05:47.400> will<00:05:47.610> freeze<00:05:47.910> like<00:05:48.389> not<00:05:48.600> freeze
