now the m98b is my favorite sniper rifle
from<00:00:48.750> battlefield<00:00:49.350> 3<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:49.890> it<00:00:50.070> was<00:00:50.160> a<00:00:50.280> pretty

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
from battlefield 3 and it was a pretty

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.150 
from battlefield 3 and it was a pretty
clear<00:00:51.059> reason<00:00:51.629> why<00:00:51.809> in<00:00:52.199> battlefield<00:00:52.710> 3<00:00:52.770> it<00:00:53.010> was

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
clear reason why in battlefield 3 it was

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.680 
clear reason why in battlefield 3 it was
one<00:00:53.340> of<00:00:53.430> the<00:00:53.489> better<00:00:53.670> ones<00:00:53.879> that<00:00:54.120> just<00:00:54.329> had<00:00:54.510> the

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
one of the better ones that just had the

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.869 
one of the better ones that just had the
highest<00:00:54.899> damage<00:00:55.440> model<00:00:55.800> compared<00:00:56.520> to<00:00:56.610> any<00:00:56.760> of

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
highest damage model compared to any of

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.330 
highest damage model compared to any of
its<00:00:57.120> competitors<00:00:57.449> now<00:00:58.230> in<00:00:58.379> battlefield<00:00:58.800> 4<00:00:58.920> the

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
its competitors now in battlefield 4 the

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.790 
its competitors now in battlefield 4 the
playing<00:01:00.059> fields<00:01:00.449> have<00:01:00.539> been<00:01:00.719> leveled<00:01:01.199> quite<00:01:01.770> a

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
playing fields have been leveled quite a

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.799 
playing fields have been leveled quite a
bit<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.219> m98b<00:01:02.760> still<00:01:03.239> there's<00:01:03.449> some<00:01:03.600> things

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
bit the m98b still there's some things

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.080 
bit the m98b still there's some things
incredibly<00:01:04.589> well<00:01:04.799> but<00:01:05.309> there<00:01:05.430> are<00:01:05.580> a<00:01:05.610> lot<00:01:05.790> of

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
incredibly well but there are a lot of

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.420 
incredibly well but there are a lot of
really<00:01:06.390> good<00:01:06.630> competitors<00:01:07.229> on<00:01:07.439> the<00:01:07.470> table<00:01:07.950> one

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
really good competitors on the table one

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.310 
really good competitors on the table one
thing<00:01:08.729> that<00:01:08.970> it<00:01:09.090> does<00:01:09.299> better<00:01:09.659> than<00:01:09.930> any<00:01:10.200> other

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
thing that it does better than any other

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.289 
thing that it does better than any other
sniper<00:01:10.770> rifle<00:01:11.130> in<00:01:11.250> battlefield<00:01:11.280> 4<00:01:11.850> right<00:01:12.270> now

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
sniper rifle in battlefield 4 right now

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.440 
sniper rifle in battlefield 4 right now
is<00:01:12.799> shooting<00:01:13.799> moving<00:01:14.250> targets<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.210> that's

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
is shooting moving targets and that's

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.230 
is shooting moving targets and that's
because<00:01:15.750> it<00:01:15.869> has<00:01:15.900> a<00:01:16.020> bullet<00:01:16.470> velocity<00:01:16.590> of<00:01:17.240> 650

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
because it has a bullet velocity of 650

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.450 
because it has a bullet velocity of 650
meters<00:01:18.600> per<00:01:18.810> second<00:01:19.320> so<00:01:19.740> you<00:01:19.799> have<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.189> lead

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
meters per second so you have to lead

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.700 
meters per second so you have to lead
the<00:01:20.700> least<00:01:21.000> with<00:01:21.270> this<00:01:21.420> sniper<00:01:21.630> rifle<00:01:22.080> versus

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
the least with this sniper rifle versus

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.770 
the least with this sniper rifle versus
other<00:01:22.920> sniper<00:01:23.310> rifles<00:01:23.700> so<00:01:23.909> at<00:01:24.090> a<00:01:24.119> distance<00:01:24.630> you

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
other sniper rifles so at a distance you

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.420 
other sniper rifles so at a distance you
really<00:01:25.080> don't<00:01:25.229> have<00:01:25.350> to<00:01:25.439> aim<00:01:25.680> too<00:01:26.040> far<00:01:26.340> in

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
really don't have to aim too far in

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.100 
really don't have to aim too far in
front<00:01:26.549> of<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:26.850> target<00:01:27.240> you're<00:01:27.570> trying<00:01:27.960> to

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
front of the target you're trying to

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:28.460 
front of the target you're trying to
kill

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
kill

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.679 
kill
as<00:01:28.530> with<00:01:28.979> all<00:01:29.220> bolt-action<00:01:29.939> sniper<00:01:29.970> rifles

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
as with all bolt-action sniper rifles

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.870 
as with all bolt-action sniper rifles
this<00:01:30.900> has<00:01:31.110> a<00:01:31.140> maximum<00:01:31.950> damage<00:01:31.979> of<00:01:32.490> a<00:01:32.549> hundred

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
this has a maximum damage of a hundred

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.330 
this has a maximum damage of a hundred
meaning<00:01:33.450> you<00:01:33.600> can<00:01:33.960> one-shot<00:01:34.380> anybody<00:01:35.159> in

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
meaning you can one-shot anybody in

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.830 
meaning you can one-shot anybody in
close<00:01:35.520> quarters<00:01:35.909> provided<00:01:36.659> they're<00:01:36.810> not

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
close quarters provided they're not

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.499 
close quarters provided they're not
using<00:01:37.259> the<00:01:37.530> defensive<00:01:38.250> perk<00:01:38.520> and<00:01:39.270> this

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
using the defensive perk and this

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.060 
using the defensive perk and this
actually<00:01:39.960> makes<00:01:40.079> it<00:01:40.259> pretty<00:01:40.380> fun<00:01:40.619> for<00:01:40.650> trying

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
actually makes it pretty fun for trying

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.160 
actually makes it pretty fun for trying
to<00:01:41.100> get<00:01:41.520> those<00:01:41.700> clutch<00:01:42.119> hipfire<00:01:42.630> shots<00:01:42.960> which

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
to get those clutch hipfire shots which

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.690 
to get those clutch hipfire shots which
are<00:01:43.290> very<00:01:43.530> difficult<00:01:43.829> to<00:01:44.189> do<00:01:44.340> just<00:01:44.579> because

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
are very difficult to do just because

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.840 
are very difficult to do just because
hipfire<00:01:45.180> accuracy<00:01:45.540> with<00:01:45.869> these<00:01:46.020> things<00:01:46.200> is<00:01:46.409> so

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:46.850 
hipfire accuracy with these things is so

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:49.580 
hipfire accuracy with these things is so
unpredictable<00:01:47.850> but<00:01:48.570> when<00:01:48.750> you<00:01:48.899> get<00:01:49.079> them<00:01:49.200> it's

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
unpredictable but when you get them it's

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.679 
unpredictable but when you get them it's
a<00:01:49.649> really<00:01:50.009> good<00:01:50.130> feeling<00:01:50.520> now<00:01:51.090> that<00:01:51.119> hundred

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
a really good feeling now that hundred

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.050 
a really good feeling now that hundred
damage<00:01:51.869> starts<00:01:52.259> to<00:01:52.470> drop<00:01:52.710> off<00:01:52.890> past<00:01:53.250> 12<00:01:53.700> meter

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
damage starts to drop off past 12 meter

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.580 
damage starts to drop off past 12 meter
so<00:01:54.450> you're<00:01:54.750> not<00:01:54.869> going<00:01:55.049> to<00:01:55.110> be<00:01:55.200> getting<00:01:55.380> those

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
so you're not going to be getting those

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.310 
so you're not going to be getting those
same<00:01:55.950> crazy<00:01:56.670> close<00:01:57.090> quarter<00:01:57.420> benefits<00:01:57.899> beyond

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
same crazy close quarter benefits beyond

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.620 
same crazy close quarter benefits beyond
that<00:01:58.560> and<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:59.549> damage<00:01:59.850> drop-off<00:02:00.180> goes<00:02:00.420> down

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
that and the damage drop-off goes down

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.810 
that and the damage drop-off goes down
to<00:02:00.810> 59<00:02:01.320> like<00:02:01.590> a<00:02:01.619> lot<00:02:01.920> of<00:02:02.040> other<00:02:02.189> bolt-action

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
to 59 like a lot of other bolt-action

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.060 
to 59 like a lot of other bolt-action
sniper<00:02:02.850> rifles<00:02:03.479> except<00:02:04.110> this<00:02:04.290> one<00:02:04.500> drops<00:02:04.829> off

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
sniper rifles except this one drops off

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.330 
sniper rifles except this one drops off
at<00:02:05.219> around<00:02:05.659> 150<00:02:06.659> meters<00:02:07.229> away<00:02:07.590> so<00:02:07.649> it's

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
at around 150 meters away so it's

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.430 
at around 150 meters away so it's
intended<00:02:08.759> for<00:02:09.060> extreme<00:02:09.509> long-range<00:02:10.020> shooting

and anybody closer than that

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.760 
and anybody closer than that
it's<00:02:12.940> still<00:02:13.120> gonna<00:02:13.270> be<00:02:13.450> getting<00:02:13.750> more<00:02:13.990> than<00:02:14.050> 59

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:14.770 
it's still gonna be getting more than 59

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.440 
it's still gonna be getting more than 59

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
shot kills now to make up for the fact

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.030 
shot kills now to make up for the fact
that<00:02:25.480> this<00:02:25.750> has<00:02:25.960> one<00:02:26.170> of<00:02:26.290> the<00:02:26.380> best<00:02:26.620> damage

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040

out<00:02:28.930> there<00:02:29.170> and<00:02:29.350> then<00:02:29.470> it's<00:02:29.590> got<00:02:29.770> a<00:02:29.800> crazy<00:02:30.250> fast

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700

bullet<00:02:31.120> velocity<00:02:31.350> we<00:02:32.350> need<00:02:32.380> to<00:02:32.650> give<00:02:32.800> it<00:02:32.920> some

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
bullet velocity we need to give it some

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.190 
bullet velocity we need to give it some
things<00:02:33.790> to<00:02:34.030> balance<00:02:34.180> it<00:02:34.480> out<00:02:34.570> and<00:02:34.840> that<00:02:35.020> is<00:02:35.170> the

things to balance it out and that is the

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.680 
things to balance it out and that is the

got to make your shots absolutely count

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:48.750

the enemy as possible as you notice here

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:01.410 
the enemy as possible as you notice here
I'm<00:02:59.530> being<00:02:59.680> a<00:02:59.830> bit<00:02:59.950> of<00:03:00.070> a<00:03:00.190> rooftop<00:03:00.910> camper

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.420 
I'm being a bit of a rooftop camper

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.360 
I'm being a bit of a rooftop camper
which<00:03:01.630> I<00:03:01.810> guess<00:03:02.020> it's<00:03:02.230> kind<00:03:02.500> of<00:03:02.620> my<00:03:02.830> play<00:03:03.100> style

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
which I guess it's kind of my play style

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:04.830 
which I guess it's kind of my play style
now<00:03:03.610> if<00:03:03.790> I'm<00:03:03.910> doing<00:03:04.239> bolt-action<00:03:04.810> sniper

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
now if I'm doing bolt-action sniper

now if I'm doing bolt-action sniper
rifles<00:03:05.470> unless<00:03:05.770> there<00:03:05.980> are<00:03:06.100> no<00:03:06.250> roofs<00:03:06.520> but<00:03:06.730> I

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.030 
rifles unless there are no roofs but I
definitely<00:03:07.750> try<00:03:07.930> and<00:03:07.959> put<00:03:08.200> as<00:03:08.320> much<00:03:08.770> distance

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
definitely try and put as much distance

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.280 
definitely try and put as much distance
between<00:03:09.459> myself<00:03:09.850> and<00:03:10.209> the<00:03:10.360> enemy<00:03:10.630> to<00:03:11.020> give<00:03:11.140> me

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
between myself and the enemy to give me

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.410 
between myself and the enemy to give me
the<00:03:11.410> best<00:03:11.560> advantage<00:03:12.489> as<00:03:12.670> possible<00:03:13.270> because

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:13.420 
the best advantage as possible because

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:14.790 
the best advantage as possible because
if<00:03:13.630> you're<00:03:13.780> in<00:03:13.870> that<00:03:13.930> medium<00:03:14.500> range

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:14.800 
if you're in that medium range

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.620 
if you're in that medium range
engagement<00:03:15.430> distance<00:03:15.820> and<00:03:16.090> you're<00:03:16.330> going<00:03:16.540> up

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
engagement distance and you're going up

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.180 
engagement distance and you're going up

against decent players with assault
rifles<00:03:18.250> you<00:03:18.700> are<00:03:18.820> gonna<00:03:18.970> lose<00:03:19.269> out<00:03:19.600> hard<00:03:20.019> I

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:21.750 
rifles you are gonna lose out hard I

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
assault rifle it's very hard to make

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.009 
assault rifle it's very hard to make
your<00:03:24.160> mark<00:03:24.430> and<00:03:24.610> take<00:03:24.850> your<00:03:25.060> shot<00:03:25.390> after<00:03:25.840> that

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:26.019 
your mark and take your shot after that

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:28.620 
your mark and take your shot after that
so<00:03:26.320> it's<00:03:27.070> kind<00:03:27.370> of<00:03:27.459> a<00:03:27.610> whoever<00:03:28.030> shoots<00:03:28.269> first

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:28.630 
so it's kind of a whoever shoots first

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.380 
so it's kind of a whoever shoots first

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:39.519 
it's probably gonna be a pretty

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:41.940 
it's probably gonna be a pretty
frustrating<00:03:39.790> process<00:03:40.720> for<00:03:41.049> you<00:03:41.170> I<00:03:41.350> have<00:03:41.739> seen

fours got this weird thing going on

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:48.420 
fours got this weird thing going on
right<00:03:46.780> now<00:03:46.810> that's<00:03:47.140> I<00:03:47.410> guess<00:03:47.680> been<00:03:47.980> affecting

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
right now that's I guess been affecting

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.090 
right now that's I guess been affecting
me<00:03:48.670> a<00:03:48.700> lot<00:03:48.970> and<00:03:49.239> it<00:03:50.049> just<00:03:50.080> happens<00:03:50.620> that<00:03:50.739> every

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.100 
me a lot and it just happens that every

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.580 
me a lot and it just happens that every
time<00:03:51.519> when<00:03:51.820> i<00:03:51.850> zoom<00:03:51.970> in<00:03:52.570> or<00:03:52.750> retain<00:03:53.200> BER<00:03:53.320> around

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
time when i zoom in or retain BER around

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.070 
time when i zoom in or retain BER around
and<00:03:53.739> then<00:03:53.860> fire<00:03:54.160> as<00:03:54.549> fast<00:03:54.880> as<00:03:55.090> possible<00:03:55.630> every

00:03:56.070 --> 00:03:56.080 
and then fire as fast as possible every

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:57.840 
and then fire as fast as possible every
now<00:03:56.260> and<00:03:56.500> then<00:03:56.680> I'll<00:03:57.040> get<00:03:57.250> a<00:03:57.310> shot<00:03:57.610> that<00:03:57.820> just

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:57.850 
now and then I'll get a shot that just

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.330 
now and then I'll get a shot that just
seems<00:03:58.239> to<00:03:58.390> stray<00:03:58.989> way<00:03:59.320> off<00:03:59.530> to<00:03:59.769> the<00:03:59.799> side<00:04:00.160> and

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
seems to stray way off to the side and

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:01.949 
seems to stray way off to the side and
just<00:04:00.519> not<00:04:00.670> be<00:04:00.850> going<00:04:00.970> anywhere<00:04:01.420> near<00:04:01.750> where

I'm<00:04:02.049> actually<00:04:02.380> aiming<00:04:03.040> this<00:04:03.670> is<00:04:03.850> a<00:04:03.880> bug<00:04:04.510> that

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
I'm actually aiming this is a bug that

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.630 
I'm actually aiming this is a bug that
somebody's<00:04:05.170> actually<00:04:05.410> made<00:04:06.070> a<00:04:06.100> video<00:04:06.310> on

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
somebody's actually made a video on

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.539 
somebody's actually made a video on
before<00:04:07.150> and<00:04:07.650> commented<00:04:08.650> on<00:04:08.769> but<00:04:09.070> I've<00:04:09.400> been

00:04:09.539 --> 00:04:09.549 
before and commented on but I've been

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:11.850 
before and commented on but I've been
noticing<00:04:09.850> it<00:04:10.209> more<00:04:10.390> and<00:04:10.870> more<00:04:11.079> I<00:04:11.110> noticed<00:04:11.680> it<00:04:11.799> a

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:11.860 
noticing it more and more I noticed it a

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.699 
noticing it more and more I noticed it a
lot<00:04:12.160> with<00:04:12.340> the<00:04:12.489> m98b<00:04:13.209> so<00:04:13.720> I'm<00:04:14.110> not<00:04:14.260> sure<00:04:14.500> if<00:04:14.620> it

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:14.709 
lot with the m98b so I'm not sure if it

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:16.289 
lot with the m98b so I'm not sure if it
has<00:04:14.739> to<00:04:15.010> do<00:04:15.130> with<00:04:15.250> the<00:04:15.370> way<00:04:15.549> that<00:04:15.730> this<00:04:15.940> weapon

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
has to do with the way that this weapon

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:18.120 
has to do with the way that this weapon
fires<00:04:16.600> or<00:04:16.900> because<00:04:17.200> it's<00:04:17.350> a<00:04:17.470> slow<00:04:17.859> rate<00:04:18.100> of

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
fires or because it's a slow rate of

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.159 
fires or because it's a slow rate of
fire<00:04:18.250> weapon<00:04:18.760> that<00:04:18.910> I'm<00:04:19.030> always<00:04:19.419> ready<00:04:20.079> to

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:20.169 
fire weapon that I'm always ready to

00:04:20.169 --> 00:04:21.960 
fire weapon that I'm always ready to
shoot<00:04:20.530> as<00:04:20.709> soon<00:04:20.979> as<00:04:21.099> I<00:04:21.220> have<00:04:21.370> that<00:04:21.549> next<00:04:21.849> round

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
shoot as soon as I have that next round

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.020 
shoot as soon as I have that next round
chambered<00:04:22.539> so<00:04:22.750> I<00:04:22.780> notice<00:04:23.289> it<00:04:23.440> more<00:04:23.650> but<00:04:24.220> it<00:04:24.610> has

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
chambered so I notice it more but it has

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:26.550 
chambered so I notice it more but it has
been<00:04:25.120> a<00:04:25.150> bit<00:04:25.600> aggravating<00:04:26.350> and<00:04:26.440> has

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
been a bit aggravating and has

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.170 
been a bit aggravating and has
definitely<00:04:27.130> gotten<00:04:27.430> me<00:04:27.550> killed<00:04:27.790> in<00:04:27.970> some

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:28.180 
definitely gotten me killed in some

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:31.080 
definitely gotten me killed in some
situations<00:04:28.870> so<00:04:29.560> to<00:04:29.620> better<00:04:30.070> facilitate<00:04:30.820> my

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
situations so to better facilitate my

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:33.480 
situations so to better facilitate my
current<00:04:31.570> style<00:04:31.840> of<00:04:32.170> sniping<00:04:32.620> gameplay<00:04:32.680> and

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
current style of sniping gameplay and

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:35.400 
current style of sniping gameplay and
the<00:04:33.850> style<00:04:34.240> that<00:04:34.360> I<00:04:34.540> would<00:04:34.870> say<00:04:35.020> this<00:04:35.200> sniper

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
the style that I would say this sniper

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:37.890 
the style that I would say this sniper
rifle<00:04:35.889> warrants<00:04:36.280> which<00:04:36.700> is<00:04:36.880> long-range<00:04:37.480> more

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
rifle warrants which is long-range more

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.350 
rifle warrants which is long-range more
camping<00:04:38.470> more<00:04:39.010> being<00:04:39.250> aware<00:04:39.610> of<00:04:39.850> people

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:40.360 
camping more being aware of people

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.610 
camping more being aware of people
trying<00:04:40.600> to<00:04:40.660> sneak<00:04:40.750> up<00:04:41.080> on<00:04:41.260> you

trying to sneak up on you

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.490 
trying to sneak up on you
I<00:04:41.650> generally<00:04:42.550> go<00:04:43.030> with<00:04:43.060> spawn<00:04:43.720> beacon<00:04:44.230> and

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:44.500 
I generally go with spawn beacon and

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.590 
I generally go with spawn beacon and
tugs<00:04:44.860> that<00:04:45.220> allows<00:04:45.520> me<00:04:45.730> to<00:04:45.760> put<00:04:46.300> a<00:04:46.330> spawn

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:46.600 
tugs that allows me to put a spawn

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.510 
tugs that allows me to put a spawn
beacon<00:04:46.960> in<00:04:47.080> my<00:04:47.200> nice<00:04:47.410> little<00:04:47.590> camping<00:04:48.160> or

close-quarter<00:04:59.710> mass<00:05:00.040> but<00:05:00.310> again<00:05:00.669> you<00:05:00.850> know

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
close-quarter mass but again you know

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:03.240 
close-quarter mass but again you know
Here<00:05:01.210> I<00:05:01.240> am<00:05:01.330> back<00:05:01.600> up<00:05:01.810> on<00:05:02.140> top<00:05:02.500> of<00:05:02.680> a<00:05:02.800> roof<00:05:02.980> and

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:03.250 
Here I am back up on top of a roof and

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:05.790 
Here I am back up on top of a roof and
it's<00:05:03.669> really<00:05:03.970> important<00:05:04.540> to<00:05:04.600> I<00:05:04.690> think<00:05:05.110> kind<00:05:05.710> of

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 
it's really important to I think kind of

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:09.120 
it's really important to I think kind of
develop<00:05:06.430> a<00:05:06.720> dichotomy<00:05:07.720> of<00:05:07.870> play<00:05:08.410> styles<00:05:08.860> when

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:09.130 
develop a dichotomy of play styles when

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:10.980 
develop a dichotomy of play styles when
you<00:05:09.370> switch<00:05:09.580> between<00:05:09.730> the<00:05:10.150> assault<00:05:10.480> class<00:05:10.750> the

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:10.990 
you switch between the assault class the

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:13.530 
you switch between the assault class the
support<00:05:11.410> class<00:05:11.530> the<00:05:12.220> recon<00:05:12.910> long-range

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:13.540 
support class the recon long-range

support class the recon long-range
sniper<00:05:13.960> class<00:05:14.290> you<00:05:14.560> got<00:05:14.740> to<00:05:14.860> change<00:05:15.130> it<00:05:15.280> up<00:05:15.430> you

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:15.460 
sniper class you got to change it up you

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.550 
sniper class you got to change it up you
got<00:05:15.730> to<00:05:15.880> say<00:05:16.330> it's<00:05:16.510> okay<00:05:16.840> to<00:05:16.870> do<00:05:17.140> a<00:05:17.169> little<00:05:17.410> bit

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:17.560 
got to say it's okay to do a little bit

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:19.409 
got to say it's okay to do a little bit
of<00:05:17.680> camping<00:05:18.100> because<00:05:18.729> in<00:05:19.060> this<00:05:19.210> map

00:05:19.409 --> 00:05:19.419 
of camping because in this map

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:22.080 
of camping because in this map
particularly<00:05:20.200> I<00:05:20.440> was<00:05:20.950> really<00:05:21.370> aggravating

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:22.090 
particularly I was really aggravating

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:23.580 
particularly I was really aggravating
the<00:05:22.210> enemy<00:05:22.570> team<00:05:22.810> not<00:05:23.020> only<00:05:23.050> did<00:05:23.440> they<00:05:23.560> not

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:23.590 
the enemy team not only did they not

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:27.330 
the enemy team not only did they not
feel<00:05:24.040> safe<00:05:24.400> about<00:05:25.090> moving<00:05:25.450> out<00:05:25.600> in<00:05:26.340> exposed

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:27.340 
feel safe about moving out in exposed

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:28.980 
feel safe about moving out in exposed
areas<00:05:27.820> and<00:05:28.000> they<00:05:28.060> started<00:05:28.330> looking<00:05:28.660> up<00:05:28.780> the

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:28.990 
areas and they started looking up the

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:30.330 
areas and they started looking up the
sky<00:05:29.169> a<00:05:29.320> lot<00:05:29.620> which<00:05:29.800> made<00:05:30.010> them<00:05:30.190> very

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:30.340 
sky a lot which made them very

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:32.400 
sky a lot which made them very
vulnerable<00:05:30.729> to<00:05:31.510> my<00:05:31.660> teammates<00:05:32.110> but<00:05:32.200> they

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:32.410 
vulnerable to my teammates but they

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:34.200 
vulnerable to my teammates but they
started<00:05:32.770> you<00:05:32.950> know<00:05:33.070> raging<00:05:33.550> in<00:05:33.700> chat<00:05:33.910> saying

all this stuff and when you upset your
teammate<00:05:36.400> your<00:05:36.610> opponents<00:05:37.150> like<00:05:37.330> that<00:05:37.570> then

teammate your opponents like that then

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.930 
teammate your opponents like that then
they<00:05:38.530> play<00:05:38.890> worse<00:05:39.130> you<00:05:39.370> know<00:05:39.490> they<00:05:39.640> become

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:39.940 
they play worse you know they become

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:42.630 
they play worse you know they become
much<00:05:40.630> easier<00:05:40.810> targets<00:05:41.560> to<00:05:41.680> get<00:05:41.830> rid<00:05:42.130> of<00:05:42.160> so

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:42.640 
much easier targets to get rid of so

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:44.820 
much easier targets to get rid of so
just<00:05:43.150> like<00:05:43.419> sports<00:05:43.930> and<00:05:44.200> a<00:05:44.260> lot<00:05:44.470> of<00:05:44.500> other

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:44.830 
just like sports and a lot of other

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:46.350 
just like sports and a lot of other
games<00:05:45.130> a<00:05:45.400> lot<00:05:45.669> of<00:05:45.729> it<00:05:45.880> comes<00:05:46.030> down<00:05:46.210> to

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:46.360 
games a lot of it comes down to

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:49.050 
games a lot of it comes down to
mentality<00:05:47.169> how<00:05:47.950> players<00:05:48.250> are<00:05:48.490> feeling<00:05:48.910> and

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:49.060 
mentality how players are feeling and

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:50.279 
mentality how players are feeling and
I've<00:05:49.180> noticed<00:05:49.390> that<00:05:49.690> time<00:05:49.930> and<00:05:50.110> time<00:05:50.260> again

00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:50.289 
I've noticed that time and time again

00:05:50.289 --> 00:05:52.920 
I've noticed that time and time again
having<00:05:50.800> played<00:05:51.010> so<00:05:51.310> much<00:05:51.460> battlefield<00:05:52.000> 3<00:05:52.330> in<00:05:52.479> a

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:52.930 
having played so much battlefield 3 in a

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:55.020 
having played so much battlefield 3 in a
game<00:05:53.169> where<00:05:53.470> your<00:05:53.650> team<00:05:53.890> starts<00:05:54.280> off<00:05:54.430> really

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:55.030 
game where your team starts off really

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:57.120 
game where your team starts off really
well<00:05:55.060> and<00:05:55.479> you<00:05:55.570> sort<00:05:55.840> of<00:05:55.930> shut<00:05:56.500> the<00:05:56.680> team<00:05:56.860> down

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:57.130 
well and you sort of shut the team down

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:59.790 
well and you sort of shut the team down
on<00:05:57.310> a<00:05:57.340> really<00:05:57.700> good<00:05:57.850> push<00:05:58.169> you<00:05:59.169> can<00:05:59.350> kind<00:05:59.710> of

00:05:59.790 --> 00:05:59.800 
on a really good push you can kind of

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.800 
on a really good push you can kind of
quarantine<00:06:00.340> them<00:06:00.850> after<00:06:01.300> that<00:06:01.450> because

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:01.810 
quarantine them after that because

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:03.600 
quarantine them after that because
they're<00:06:02.260> sort<00:06:02.500> of<00:06:02.560> broken<00:06:02.979> you<00:06:03.280> know<00:06:03.400> their

00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:03.610 
they're sort of broken you know their

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:05.700 
they're sort of broken you know their
will<00:06:03.850> to<00:06:04.120> push<00:06:04.419> out<00:06:04.630> and<00:06:04.780> be<00:06:04.990> more<00:06:05.500> aggressive

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:05.710 
will to push out and be more aggressive

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:07.740 
will to push out and be more aggressive
has<00:06:06.370> been<00:06:06.550> broken<00:06:06.850> at<00:06:07.060> the<00:06:07.180> beginning<00:06:07.570> of<00:06:07.690> a

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:07.750 
has been broken at the beginning of a

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:10.260 
has been broken at the beginning of a
match<00:06:07.960> and<00:06:08.160> that'll<00:06:09.160> show<00:06:09.460> throughout<00:06:10.030> the

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:10.270 
match and that'll show throughout the

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:12.390 
match and that'll show throughout the
rest<00:06:10.510> of<00:06:10.720> the<00:06:10.810> game<00:06:11.080> so<00:06:11.410> I've<00:06:11.890> always<00:06:12.220> found

00:06:12.390 --> 00:06:12.400 
rest of the game so I've always found

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:14.610 
rest of the game so I've always found
that<00:06:12.520> really<00:06:13.030> interesting<00:06:13.150> when<00:06:14.140> playing<00:06:14.470> a

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:14.620 
that really interesting when playing a

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:16.740 
that really interesting when playing a
team<00:06:15.100> that<00:06:15.130> doesn't<00:06:16.030> really<00:06:16.180> change<00:06:16.270> between

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:16.750 
team that doesn't really change between

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:18.450 
team that doesn't really change between
rounds<00:06:17.320> but<00:06:17.440> you<00:06:17.620> notice<00:06:18.010> their<00:06:18.190> play<00:06:18.430> style

00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:18.460 
rounds but you notice their play style

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:20.820 
rounds but you notice their play style
changes<00:06:19.240> up<00:06:19.390> depending<00:06:20.110> on<00:06:20.200> the<00:06:20.320> beginning<00:06:20.770> of

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:20.830 
changes up depending on the beginning of

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:22.529 
changes up depending on the beginning of
the<00:06:20.890> round<00:06:21.100> or<00:06:21.340> the<00:06:21.370> mentality<00:06:21.970> that's<00:06:22.240> going

00:06:22.529 --> 00:06:22.539 
the round or the mentality that's going

00:06:22.539 --> 00:06:24.659 
the round or the mentality that's going
on<00:06:22.660> during<00:06:23.320> that<00:06:23.500> game<00:06:23.800> now<00:06:24.220> as<00:06:24.460> for

00:06:24.659 --> 00:06:24.669 
on during that game now as for

00:06:24.669 --> 00:06:26.400 
on during that game now as for
attachments<00:06:25.360> here<00:06:25.450> I've<00:06:25.660> got<00:06:25.840> my<00:06:25.960> eight-times

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:26.410 
attachments here I've got my eight-times

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:27.870 
attachments here I've got my eight-times
scope<00:06:26.860> which<00:06:27.160> again<00:06:27.640> I've<00:06:27.850> mentioned

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:27.880 
scope which again I've mentioned

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:30.060 
scope which again I've mentioned
multiple<00:06:28.360> times<00:06:28.630> but<00:06:29.020> I<00:06:29.080> really<00:06:29.620> just<00:06:29.800> love

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:30.070 
multiple times but I really just love

00:06:30.070 --> 00:06:32.370 
multiple times but I really just love
the<00:06:30.190> eight-time<00:06:30.490> scope<00:06:31.000> I<00:06:31.240> also<00:06:31.630> really<00:06:32.110> like

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:32.380 
the eight-time scope I also really like

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:34.710 
the eight-time scope I also really like
using<00:06:32.620> the<00:06:32.890> 14<00:06:33.280> x<00:06:33.520> variable<00:06:34.090> zoom<00:06:34.330> scope

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:34.720 
using the 14 x variable zoom scope

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:36.750 
using the 14 x variable zoom scope
because<00:06:34.930> again<00:06:35.710> we<00:06:35.860> have<00:06:35.890> lots<00:06:36.280> of<00:06:36.460> really

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:36.760 
because again we have lots of really

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:38.640 
because again we have lots of really
long<00:06:37.120> range<00:06:37.390> engagements<00:06:37.599> in<00:06:38.140> bad

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:38.650 
long range engagements in bad

long range engagements in bad
field<00:06:38.889> for<00:06:39.160> the<00:06:39.430> engagement<00:06:39.910> distance<00:06:40.570> I'm

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:40.720 
field for the engagement distance I'm

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:41.879 
field for the engagement distance I'm
willing<00:06:41.020> to<00:06:41.050> bet<00:06:41.259> has<00:06:41.470> increased

00:06:41.879 --> 00:06:41.889 
willing to bet has increased

00:06:41.889 --> 00:06:45.120 
willing to bet has increased
dramatically<00:06:42.550> from<00:06:42.880> bf3<00:06:43.509> to<00:06:43.810> bf4<00:06:44.259> so<00:06:44.530> having<00:06:44.949> a

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:45.130 
dramatically from bf3 to bf4 so having a

00:06:45.130 --> 00:06:48.210 
dramatically from bf3 to bf4 so having a
14-time<00:06:45.729> site<00:06:46.090> becomes<00:06:46.720> usable<00:06:47.110> in<00:06:47.590> so<00:06:47.949> many

00:06:48.210 --> 00:06:48.220 
14-time site becomes usable in so many

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:50.279 
14-time site becomes usable in so many
more<00:06:48.430> situations<00:06:49.090> than<00:06:49.300> I<00:06:49.389> was<00:06:49.539> expecting<00:06:49.690> it

00:06:50.279 --> 00:06:50.289 
more situations than I was expecting it

00:06:50.289 --> 00:06:52.110 
more situations than I was expecting it
and<00:06:50.440> it's<00:06:50.590> great<00:06:51.009> for<00:06:51.220> picking<00:06:51.460> off<00:06:51.669> those

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:52.120 
and it's great for picking off those

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.450 
and it's great for picking off those
headshots<00:06:52.449> which<00:06:52.930> are<00:06:53.139> absolutely<00:06:53.889> essential

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:54.460 
headshots which are absolutely essential

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:56.040 
headshots which are absolutely essential
for<00:06:54.669> any<00:06:55.060> sort<00:06:55.330> of<00:06:55.419> bolt-action<00:06:56.020> sniper

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:56.050 
for any sort of bolt-action sniper

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:58.590 
for any sort of bolt-action sniper
gameplay<00:06:56.680> so<00:06:57.130> as<00:06:57.340> we're<00:06:57.550> wrapping<00:06:57.789> things<00:06:58.060> up

00:06:58.590 --> 00:06:58.600 
gameplay so as we're wrapping things up

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:00.480 
gameplay so as we're wrapping things up
here<00:06:58.660> I<00:06:58.930> I<00:06:59.110> realize<00:06:59.800> a<00:06:59.830> bunch<00:07:00.130> of<00:07:00.250> you<00:07:00.310> are

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:00.490 
here I I realize a bunch of you are

00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:02.490 
here I I realize a bunch of you are
probably<00:07:00.669> wondering<00:07:01.000> you<00:07:01.449> know<00:07:01.479> is<00:07:01.750> the<00:07:01.930> m98b

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:02.500 
probably wondering you know is the m98b

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:04.980 
probably wondering you know is the m98b
as<00:07:02.919> good<00:07:03.310> as<00:07:03.430> it<00:07:03.550> was<00:07:03.580> in<00:07:03.729> battlefield<00:07:04.389> 3<00:07:04.479> how

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:04.990 
as good as it was in battlefield 3 how

00:07:04.990 --> 00:07:06.270 
as good as it was in battlefield 3 how
does<00:07:05.169> it<00:07:05.289> compare<00:07:05.440> to<00:07:05.710> the<00:07:05.830> other<00:07:05.949> sniper

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:06.280 
does it compare to the other sniper

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:07.980 
does it compare to the other sniper
rifles<00:07:06.669> out<00:07:06.789> there<00:07:07.000> and<00:07:07.360> I<00:07:07.449> gotta<00:07:07.600> say<00:07:07.810> it

00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:07.990 
rifles out there and I gotta say it

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:09.719 
rifles out there and I gotta say it
would<00:07:08.289> be<00:07:08.500> one<00:07:08.710> of<00:07:08.740> the<00:07:08.889> best<00:07:09.009> sniper<00:07:09.310> rifles

00:07:09.719 --> 00:07:09.729 
would be one of the best sniper rifles

00:07:09.729 --> 00:07:13.200 
would be one of the best sniper rifles
if<00:07:09.880> it<00:07:10.479> weren't<00:07:10.810> for<00:07:10.870> the<00:07:11.080> SRR<00:07:11.500> 61<00:07:12.400> now<00:07:12.610> the<00:07:12.669> SSR

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:13.210 
if it weren't for the SRR 61 now the SSR

00:07:13.210 --> 00:07:16.740 
if it weren't for the SRR 61 now the SSR
s<00:07:13.660> RR<00:07:14.169> 61<00:07:15.039> doesn't<00:07:15.520> shoot<00:07:15.850> at<00:07:16.090> the<00:07:16.270> same<00:07:16.449> bullet

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:16.750 
s RR 61 doesn't shoot at the same bullet

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:18.600 
s RR 61 doesn't shoot at the same bullet
velocity<00:07:16.840> but<00:07:17.320> it's<00:07:17.470> bullet<00:07:17.770> drop<00:07:18.070> is<00:07:18.280> less

00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:18.610 
velocity but it's bullet drop is less

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:20.670 
velocity but it's bullet drop is less
than<00:07:18.760> this<00:07:18.940> weapon<00:07:19.270> which<00:07:19.630> actually<00:07:20.289> makes<00:07:20.500> it

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:20.680 
than this weapon which actually makes it

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:22.920 
than this weapon which actually makes it
a<00:07:20.830> better<00:07:21.100> headshotting<00:07:21.850> weapon<00:07:22.180> at<00:07:22.510> long

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:22.930 
a better headshotting weapon at long

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:26.370 
a better headshotting weapon at long
range<00:07:23.289> so<00:07:23.590> I<00:07:23.620> like<00:07:24.039> the<00:07:24.220> SRR<00:07:24.669> 61<00:07:25.539> better<00:07:25.900> the

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:26.380 
range so I like the SRR 61 better the

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:28.950 
range so I like the SRR 61 better the
m98b<00:07:26.949> is<00:07:27.310> still<00:07:27.669> a<00:07:27.880> great<00:07:28.090> sniper<00:07:28.419> rifle<00:07:28.810> and

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:28.960 
m98b is still a great sniper rifle and

00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:30.180 
m98b is still a great sniper rifle and
I'm<00:07:29.050> sure<00:07:29.229> a<00:07:29.260> lot<00:07:29.350> of<00:07:29.620> people<00:07:29.889> could<00:07:30.070> get

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:30.190 
I'm sure a lot of people could get

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:31.950 
I'm sure a lot of people could get
really<00:07:30.550> good<00:07:30.639> with<00:07:30.910> it<00:07:31.060> it<00:07:31.389> is<00:07:31.599> better<00:07:31.840> for

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:31.960 
really good with it it is better for

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:33.900 
really good with it it is better for
hitting<00:07:32.380> moving<00:07:32.770> targets<00:07:33.130> as<00:07:33.280> I<00:07:33.490> said<00:07:33.729> before

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:33.910 
hitting moving targets as I said before

00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:36.089 
hitting moving targets as I said before
so<00:07:34.599> that<00:07:34.750> pretty<00:07:34.960> much<00:07:35.050> wraps<00:07:35.199> it<00:07:35.710> up<00:07:35.800> for<00:07:35.860> this

00:07:36.089 --> 00:07:36.099 
so that pretty much wraps it up for this

00:07:36.099 --> 00:07:38.339 
so that pretty much wraps it up for this
episode<00:07:36.280> of<00:07:36.880> sniper<00:07:37.150> Sunday<00:07:37.599> I<00:07:37.780> hope<00:07:38.020> you<00:07:38.199> guys

00:07:38.339 --> 00:07:38.349
