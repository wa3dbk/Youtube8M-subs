00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:08.910 
age and today we have the forge to do I

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.450 
age and today we have the forge to do I
believe<00:00:09.500> so<00:00:10.500> I'm<00:00:10.559> just<00:00:10.710> hoping<00:00:10.860> out<00:00:11.099> everybody

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
believe so I'm just hoping out everybody

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.870 
believe so I'm just hoping out everybody
right<00:00:11.610> now<00:00:12.620> so<00:00:13.620> I<00:00:13.650> mean<00:00:14.070> it's<00:00:14.309> kind<00:00:14.820> of

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:14.880 
right now so I mean it's kind of

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:15.980 
right now so I mean it's kind of
complicated<00:00:15.389> to<00:00:15.450> get<00:00:15.599> to<00:00:15.750> the<00:00:15.839> next

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
complicated to get to the next

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.620 
complicated to get to the next
stronghold<00:00:16.500> but<00:00:18.859> so<00:00:19.859> I'm<00:00:19.949> upgrading<00:00:20.160> my<00:00:20.630> Forge

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
stronghold but so I'm upgrading my Forge

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.769 
stronghold but so I'm upgrading my Forge
right<00:00:21.900> now<00:00:22.730> because<00:00:23.730> that<00:00:23.850> leads<00:00:24.510> to<00:00:24.630> the

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
right now because that leads to the

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.359 
right now because that leads to the
walls<00:00:25.019> and<00:00:25.320> I<00:00:25.350> think<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:25.590> walls<00:00:25.830> lead<00:00:26.160> to<00:00:26.279> the

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
walls and I think the walls lead to the

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.370 
walls and I think the walls lead to the
stronghold<00:00:26.640> I<00:00:26.939> believe<00:00:27.240> so<00:00:27.510> that's<00:00:27.930> just<00:00:28.080> the

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
stronghold I believe so that's just the

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.620 
stronghold I believe so that's just the
way<00:00:28.529> that's<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.070> upgrade

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:29.630 
way that's the upgrade

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:33.940 
way that's the upgrade
scenario<00:00:31.250> so<00:00:32.250> I<00:00:32.309> sped<00:00:32.610> up<00:00:32.700> that<00:00:32.969> that's<00:00:33.180> fine

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:33.950 
scenario so I sped up that that's fine

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:37.430 
scenario so I sped up that that's fine
and<00:00:34.950> now<00:00:35.910> I<00:00:35.940> need<00:00:36.120> a<00:00:36.180> force<00:00:36.480> level<00:00:36.750> 4<00:00:36.989> I<00:00:37.020> did<00:00:37.320> to

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
and now I need a force level 4 I did to

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.020 
and now I need a force level 4 I did to
level<00:00:37.649> 3<00:00:37.890> I<00:00:37.920> didn't<00:00:38.190> realize<00:00:38.489> I<00:00:38.520> was<00:00:38.760> going<00:00:38.910> to

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
level 3 I didn't realize I was going to

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.590 
level 3 I didn't realize I was going to
level<00:00:39.270> 3<00:00:39.480> so<00:00:39.930> I<00:00:39.960> go<00:00:40.140> back<00:00:40.320> now<00:00:41.210> I<00:00:42.210> can't<00:00:42.450> upgrade

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
level 3 so I go back now I can't upgrade

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.049 
level 3 so I go back now I can't upgrade
I<00:00:42.809> need<00:00:43.050> a<00:00:43.079> mind<00:00:43.379> level<00:00:43.680> 4<00:00:43.920> so<00:00:44.219> it's<00:00:44.370> very

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
I need a mind level 4 so it's very

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.729 
I need a mind level 4 so it's very
complicated<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.930> requirements<00:00:46.530> of<00:00:46.649> this

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
complicated the requirements of this

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.709 
complicated the requirements of this
game<00:00:46.980> to<00:00:47.430> upgrade<00:00:47.730> some<00:00:47.879> stuff<00:00:48.120> it's<00:00:48.300> not<00:00:48.420> just

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
game to upgrade some stuff it's not just

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.650 
game to upgrade some stuff it's not just
you<00:00:49.140> know<00:00:49.170> gold<00:00:49.590> or<00:00:49.860> elixir<00:00:50.449> you<00:00:51.449> need<00:00:51.570> to

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 
you know gold or elixir you need to

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.479 
you know gold or elixir you need to
upgrade<00:00:51.780> other<00:00:52.469> stuff<00:00:52.829> first<00:00:53.010> before<00:00:53.250> you

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
upgrade other stuff first before you

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.939 
upgrade other stuff first before you
upgrade<00:00:53.690> other<00:00:54.690> stuff<00:00:55.260> I<00:00:55.440> guess<00:00:55.649> did<00:00:55.829> that

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
upgrade other stuff I guess did that

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.569 
upgrade other stuff I guess did that
make<00:00:56.100> sense<00:00:57.980> so<00:00:58.980> that<00:00:59.010> means<00:00:59.280> I<00:00:59.370> have<00:00:59.489> to

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
make sense so that means I have to

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:00.860 
make sense so that means I have to
upgrade<00:00:59.699> my<00:00:59.940> mind<00:01:00.210> I<00:01:00.420> was<00:01:00.570> kind<00:01:00.719> of<00:01:00.750> looking

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
upgrade my mind I was kind of looking

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.869 
upgrade my mind I was kind of looking
for<00:01:01.170> it<00:01:01.260> I<00:01:01.320> was<00:01:01.410> like<00:01:01.559> wait<00:01:01.920> what's<00:01:02.489> the<00:01:02.640> mind

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
for it I was like wait what's the mind

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:05.960 
for it I was like wait what's the mind
and<00:01:03.390> then<00:01:04.199> I<00:01:04.290> realized<00:01:04.739> I<00:01:04.920> I<00:01:05.159> go<00:01:05.489> back<00:01:05.700> to<00:01:05.850> the

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
and then I realized I I go back to the

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.810 
and then I realized I I go back to the
farm<00:01:06.240> and<00:01:06.390> like<00:01:06.540> ok<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.080> mine<00:01:07.790> which<00:01:08.790> is

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:05.130 
what's called so I sped Muslim most of
them<00:04:01.150> up<00:04:02.730> it's<00:04:03.730> now<00:04:03.880> 72<00:04:04.420> troops<00:04:04.810> which<00:04:05.019> is

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:05.140 
them up it's now 72 troops which is

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:06.180 
them up it's now 72 troops which is
pretty<00:04:05.410> good<00:04:05.590> I<00:04:05.620> think<00:04:05.799> it's<00:04:05.920> pretty<00:04:06.070> good

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
pretty good I think it's pretty good

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.729 
pretty good I think it's pretty good
army<00:04:06.720> I'm<00:04:07.720> not<00:04:07.959> really<00:04:08.079> sure<00:04:08.290> what<00:04:08.530> a<00:04:08.560> good

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:08.739 
army I'm not really sure what a good

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:10.979 
army I'm not really sure what a good
army<00:04:09.130> consists<00:04:09.880> of<00:04:10.030> yet<00:04:10.329> I'm<00:04:10.480> not<00:04:10.510> really<00:04:10.840> sure

00:04:10.979 --> 00:04:10.989 
army consists of yet I'm not really sure

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:12.960 
army consists of yet I'm not really sure
how<00:04:11.140> the<00:04:11.200> attacking<00:04:11.739> goes<00:04:11.950> I<00:04:12.160> think<00:04:12.220> it's<00:04:12.459> more

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:12.970 
how the attacking goes I think it's more

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.240 
how the attacking goes I think it's more
menu<00:04:13.450> it's<00:04:14.010> automatic

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
menu it's automatic

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:16.979 
menu it's automatic
more<00:04:15.579> than<00:04:15.700> manual<00:04:16.180> you<00:04:16.299> don't<00:04:16.479> really<00:04:16.660> attack

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:16.989 
more than manual you don't really attack

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:24.340 
more than manual you don't really attack
by<00:04:17.560> yourself<00:04:20.280> so<00:04:21.280> let's<00:04:21.489> see

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.350 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:28.550

okay so I'm gonna attack now I have 92
troops<00:04:28.830> I<00:04:28.979> believe<00:04:29.310> if<00:04:29.669> I<00:04:29.850> read<00:04:30.150> that<00:04:30.300> right<00:04:31.130> so

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:32.130 
troops I believe if I read that right so

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:33.529 
troops I believe if I read that right so
now<00:04:32.310> I'm<00:04:32.400> gonna<00:04:32.490> attack<00:04:32.729> this<00:04:32.880> guy<00:04:33.090> and<00:04:33.270> I<00:04:33.330> send
