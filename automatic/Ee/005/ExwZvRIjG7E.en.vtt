average about 10,000 viewers over on
twitch<00:03:39.030> on<00:03:39.240> a<00:03:39.510> decent<00:03:39.959> night<00:03:40.110> now<00:03:40.620> that<00:03:41.070> means

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
twitch on a decent night now that means

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:42.740 
twitch on a decent night now that means
there's<00:03:41.459> 10,000<00:03:42.090> people<00:03:42.330> watching

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
there's 10,000 people watching

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.820 
there's 10,000 people watching
concurrently<00:03:43.290> and<00:03:44.030> unfortunately<00:03:45.030> I<00:03:45.800> mean<00:03:46.800> I

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
concurrently and unfortunately I mean I

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.949 
concurrently and unfortunately I mean I
guess<00:03:47.130> it's<00:03:47.550> fortunately<00:03:48.120> but<00:03:48.330> there's<00:03:48.810> not

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
guess it's fortunately but there's not

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:50.060 
guess it's fortunately but there's not
the<00:03:49.140> same<00:03:49.290> amount<00:03:49.470> of<00:03:49.500> people<00:03:49.709> watching<00:03:50.010> the

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:50.070 
the same amount of people watching the

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:52.220 
the same amount of people watching the
live<00:03:50.220> streams<00:03:50.520> as<00:03:50.700> are<00:03:50.910> our<00:03:50.940> videos<00:03:51.420> and<00:03:51.720> are

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
live streams as are our videos and are

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.400 
live streams as are our videos and are
on<00:03:52.260> YouTube<00:03:52.620> and<00:03:52.980> so<00:03:53.970> a<00:03:54.000> lot<00:03:54.270> less<00:03:54.720> people<00:03:55.200> are

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:55.410 
on YouTube and so a lot less people are

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:56.810 
on YouTube and so a lot less people are
watching<00:03:55.830> the<00:03:55.920> streams<00:03:56.220> and<00:03:56.459> they<00:03:56.550> are<00:03:56.670> the

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:56.820 
watching the streams and they are the

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.670 
watching the streams and they are the
videos<00:03:57.120> and<00:03:57.420> so<00:03:57.900> I<00:03:57.930> understand<00:03:58.380> if<00:03:58.470> you<00:03:58.530> watch

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
videos and so I understand if you watch

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:59.840 
videos and so I understand if you watch
the<00:03:58.830> streams<00:03:59.070> you're<00:03:59.220> not<00:03:59.340> really<00:03:59.489> seeing

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 
the streams you're not really seeing

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:01.729 
the streams you're not really seeing
brand-new<00:04:00.300> content<00:04:00.930> in<00:04:01.080> the<00:04:01.260> videos<00:04:01.560> and

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
brand-new content in the videos and

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:03.229 
brand-new content in the videos and
that's<00:04:01.860> really<00:04:02.130> unfortunate<00:04:02.400> and<00:04:02.790> I'm<00:04:02.880> so

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:03.239 
that's really unfortunate and I'm so

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:05.150 
that's really unfortunate and I'm so
sorry<00:04:03.510> but<00:04:04.140> I<00:04:04.200> guess<00:04:04.440> think<00:04:04.650> of<00:04:04.709> it<00:04:04.800> as<00:04:04.920> a<00:04:04.950> way

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:05.160 
sorry but I guess think of it as a way

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.710 
sorry but I guess think of it as a way
you<00:04:05.220> get<00:04:05.700> to<00:04:05.730> see<00:04:05.880> everything<00:04:06.090> early<00:04:06.570> and<00:04:06.660> you
