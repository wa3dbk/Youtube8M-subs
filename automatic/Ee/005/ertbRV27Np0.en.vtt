Waco<00:01:08.540> have<00:01:08.659> actually<00:01:08.930> released<00:01:09.259> this<00:01:09.409> model

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:09.770 
Waco have actually released this model

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.069 
Waco have actually released this model
with<00:01:10.250> a<00:01:10.400> chinese-made<00:01:11.030> compressor<00:01:11.780> in<00:01:11.869> here

00:01:12.069 --> 00:01:12.079 
with a chinese-made compressor in here

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:13.600 
with a chinese-made compressor in here
so<00:01:12.409> it's<00:01:12.500> a<00:01:12.590> quality<00:01:12.890> compressor<00:01:13.280> but<00:01:13.460> it's

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
so it's a quality compressor but it's

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.340 
so it's a quality compressor but it's
not<00:01:13.759> a<00:01:13.790> den<00:01:14.030> force<00:01:14.270> compressor<00:01:14.659> and<00:01:14.900> that

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
not a den force compressor and that

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.170 
not a den force compressor and that
allows<00:01:15.619> them<00:01:15.799> to<00:01:15.920> reach<00:01:16.100> that<00:01:16.310> price<00:01:16.880> point

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
allows them to reach that price point
