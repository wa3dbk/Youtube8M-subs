00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:14.330
 believe it or not my viewers 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.790
 computer games are really sometimes 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:19.070
 kill people who play them 

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:21.380
 it happens for many reasons 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:24.200
 most often the person just flirts a 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:26.570
 because the habits of a gamer take their why 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.820
 dear friends we ask you to rest 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.400
 often from the virtual world especially on 

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:35.440
 Spring street and yes this video is nowhere 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.440
 encourages just informative video 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:43.160
 first death associated with video games 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:45.370
 was registered in 1981 and 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.110
 literally a year later the second followed 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:51.290
 moreover, in both cases was to blame 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:55.280
 same game shooter berzerk from 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:57.890
 then atari in january 1981 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.890
 19-year-old Jeff Diley scored on the machine 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:03.800
 with the game an astronomical sum of 16 thousand 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:06.560
 660 points note in the figure 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.399
 the number of the beast is present a coincidence is not 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.609
 I think 

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:12.350
 and soon after that he died and has 

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:14.299
 in october 82 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.579
 similar misfortune happened to 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:18.950
 18-year-old Peter Burkovsky 

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:21.799
 before death he managed to hit the mark 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.509
 best players a full two in both 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:26.380
 Cases of death have been declared 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:29.630

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:36.560
 the teenager died trying to repeat one of 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.139
 scenes of the game world of warcraft 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:42.950
 his parents took the game from him and after 

00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:43.789
 this he left a note i'm leaving a hero 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.369

 and committed suicide angry 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:49.909
 the boy's parents sued 

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:51.529
 blizzard entertainment charges 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:52.370
 famous computer manufacturer

 and stresses attorney specializing 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.400
 on internet addiction issues 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.530
 hopes to win this case because 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.330
 claims of people whose children have suffered from 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.280
 excessive communion to online games 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:06.770
 there are still sixty 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.660
 parents testimony lawyer 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.490

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.590
 boy 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:14.540
 another brainchild of blizzard was 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.090
 the cause of death of one Korean 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.110
 the men who played over three 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.180
 days in a row 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.280
 apparently blizzard makes just 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.870
 great games once people for their sake 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.000
 easy parting with lives 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.680
 this man went to round-the-clock 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.050
 Internet cafe which by the way is very 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.000
 popular in korea by the way did you know 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.750
 that korea is considered the capital of the game 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.760
 starcraft 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.680
 he started playing starcraft without 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:39.170
 stops with short breaks to sleep 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.730
 and going after two days his friend started 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:43.400
 worry because that man 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.890
 lost his job because of this game but he 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.960
 ignored it for about 3 day 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.630
 workers and found his condition 

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:52.790
 fainting he was taken to the hospital but he 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.140
 died on the way from cardiac arrest and 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:56.600
 power shortage 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.400
 so next time taking part 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:02.239
 in the game marathon make sure you 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:04.370
 sleep enough and eat fourth 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:05.750
 the case happened back in the spring far 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.030
 2002 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.950
 American Shon Levy, 21, 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.989
 was an ordinary guy who worked 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.790

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:16.550
 playing everquest 2 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.920
 once he gave a friend data from his 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:21.560

 need to start over 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:35.630
 it seemed a monstrous lad inserted a barrel 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.010
 in their mouths and knocked their brains on the wallpaper found 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:39.110

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.830
 many deaths do not occur 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.980
 through the fault of video games but because of their 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:54.290
 unbalanced players in 2006 is not 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.720

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.660
 addiction to video games 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:14.590
 the jury found his arguments 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.410
 inconclusive 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:20.590
 and in 2008 found spelman a guilty

 in the third degree murder set 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:24.370
 homicides and deaths occur in a straight line 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.290
 or indirect video game fault 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.030
 parents forget about their children and 

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:29.770
