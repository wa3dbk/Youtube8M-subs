00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 and repeat that night even in 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.879
 the personal thing that you see here marking the 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.919
 Sunday to so many people in their stadium with 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:12.090
 similar rival in as much if the truth 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:15.030
 what good after those memories is 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:18.720
 easier to visualize you doing it 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.490
 again and I already know what it feels like 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.580
 I enjoyed it very much and I would like 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.580
 return 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:29.820
 to score to help the team with to draw 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.370
 the victory and good would be to do something 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.970
 ideal and that I would really enjoy 

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:38.250
 everything if the favorable result was 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.739
 it was the first time I had to score 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.840
 of America and what better than that 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.790
 league match between the one stadium 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.540
 that had a very good input and that 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.940
 they are going to have 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:52.150
 great hopes and expectations 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:54.310
 that the team made a good match 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.580
 and it happened like I tell you 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:01:00.820
 unfortunately the result at the end 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:03.190
 we tied in the global and we did not pass but 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.530
 but we also have that one 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.790
 thorn pinned and apart by 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.400
 need we have to get results 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:11.680
 to get fully again 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.930
 me to the tournament you see it as a moment 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.670
 ideal for what cougars come out of 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.830
 this little bump in which in which 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.479
 entered the fact that it's Sunday in 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:21.580
 your home a full stadium against an opponent 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:23.840
 like america or more does not have better framework 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:26.539
 that that to get up 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:31.189
 we do not have under the frame because 

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:34.549
 so marks the tournament we know that if 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:37.159
 you let go more dates at the end it costs you and 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:40.340
 so I think it's an opportunity 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:43.520
 a nice opportunity for the team 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.860
 take the road that he who wins 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.450
 take out the three points and as I say 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.929
 to get back into the 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:53.270
 fight in the tournament and at the same time defeat 

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:56.179
 to a rival like it is america with which 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.649
 you have a lot of rivalry however it is 

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:59.750
 in America very differently it has not 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:01.069
 reinforced by that out there it was said that 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.349
 the best soccer reinforcements 

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:04.969
 Mexican intimidates in some way to see 

00:02:03.349 --> 00:02:07.219
 the names of this template what they have 

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:08.490
 made the win to achieve the day 

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:11.070
 previous 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:13.090
 of course they have a good roster and 

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:17.590
 good 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:19.060
 is part of the identity of the america that 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.280
 always try to reinforce yourself from that 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:25.680
 way but good we 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:29.080
 We do not fear anyone, we know what 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:31.210
 that doing things well 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.300
 and if we give all of our 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:36.190
 our what we have to give we can 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.610
 defeat any opponent that is 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:38.610
 put in front 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.920
 but we do not deny the quality they have 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.830
 but good has always been like this 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:48.410
 pumas right now is giving you too 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:50.770
 opportunity to several young people that's 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:55.250
 part of cougar identity then 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:59.260
 this is how I say no no no 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:01.940
 we have that kind of thing but rather 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.860
 we try to think about what we can be 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.680
 we can repeat you can 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:10.860
 to be with America again without a doubt 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:13.680
 yes me because of that team 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:16.470
 of those two occasions that we beat them 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:19.110
 both in the Aztec and as here in the 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.580
 going from the quarterfinals I think that 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:24.060
 90 percent of the games that 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:26.370
 we play that game we are here in the 

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.800
 campus then I do not see why not 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:31.300
 we have the ability to return to 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:34.090
 achieve it simply 

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:37.000
 leave all connected all plugged in 

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:39.130
 in doing things well and well I think 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.920
 than to return to that level with which 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:44.020
 we count on that in those matches for 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:48.930
 so that the team comes back and goes back to 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:48.930
 lift and take a positive inertia 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.740
 ah
