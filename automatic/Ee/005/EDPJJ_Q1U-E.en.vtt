00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:16.690
 Yes About acquisition of each data of amazon jp this time 

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:19.590
 I will explain 

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:22.670
 First of all I'd of this manual street 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.210
 Get Prime started 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:28.480
 First, an input file 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:33.420
 Set an output folder 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:38.820
 Anywhere I'd be able to wash the Tteyuu now input file 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:42.120
 The form of a form or here inventory reports say er Shin list 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.930
 This has downloaded amazon's and inventory data 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:48.120
 Format 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:50.790
 Both in also you can pick up this a new font 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.250
 You can choose either 

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:55.610
 That say er Shin list 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.579
 Almost like this 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:00.100
 It feels like 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:02.170
 Inventory report 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:06.340
 It is such a format 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:09.640
 Well with the form that can be downloaded from Amazon today 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:14.040
 Either can be imported 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:16.310
 It is such a feeling first of all from the reference button 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.870
 That input file 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:25.640
 Get this and then this output folder 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:31.990
 I'm choosing where to look like this. 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:36.159
 If you choose a place, the following is the setting conditions for acquiring the lowest price seller of jp first 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:42.369
 You can change because in here a ne variety that ze setting conditions 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:44.430
 For example, delivery this Tteyuu the original if this is their idea of seller of Na of kettle ball side also fba of 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:47.300
 Click here if you want to squeeze 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.450
 No specified when you do not want to stop, and the like 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:55.750
 Next to the delivery preparation period in 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:02:00.520
 This is whether it usually includes shipping or something within 8 values usually . 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:02.150
 Hey so much is no use But you know you can be included up to a maximum of 7 days more than that 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:08.039
 Since we have omitted 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:10.050
 Oh, there is stock and shipment within 7 days or no specification 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:16.180
 I choose this way 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:20.019
 Next shipping country This and domestic shipping say that the shipping source is Japan 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:22.300
 In the Tteyuu overseas dispatch is do I mean smoked or becomes the dispatch from overseas 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:24.210
 This was also the roses are not the 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.400
 I knit in a feeling of saying 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:29.410
 Then it is the number of feedback 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:33.130
 This is for example the lowest seller 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:36.910
 It is the current setting, so this 50 is checked 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:42.570
 Sellers with less than 50 feedbacks will be omitted 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:45.390
 So if the number of evaluation wintering cheapest seller is not turned 50 I mean I bought and 40 

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:50.800
 The second seller to skip 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:53.280
 If it is no good, it will be skipped in the third form 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:03:00.030
 So this high rating rate is also together 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:03:02.870
 Rating Percentage If the percentage of rating is over 80 and only get it 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:09.530
 It's a form of ait skiping 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:16.060
 Lastly, this seller's number of sellers This is the number of inventory that sellers have but this is 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:18.530
 If you set it to 10% or more, the group is Dzong tablets Only sellers who set 10% or more of the stock quantity 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:23.330
 Since There will have been acquired 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:23.990
 Still one or more I'd kinda recommended not guess is to say too much this more than 10% 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:28.500
 Or 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:30.260
 I would like you to use it in the form of no specification 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:35.120
 It feels like this 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:41.780
 After setting the conditions for acquiring sellers first , this amazon www en 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:42.610
 The operation is started just by pressing the button "Get" and it is in this output folder that you set earlier 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.590

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:56.239
 At this time, when you press the acquisition button , check here to perform continuous acquisition here 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:57.599
 I can't put it in, but if I put it here , for example, I would kick it with a 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:00.120
 File 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:05.240
 When the acquisition of 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:06.290
 File output and new file again 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.980
 8 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:14.280
 In order to make 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:20.670
 Re-acquisition will start. If you want to keep data fresh continuously 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:22.120
 When the get push acquisition button put a check to do the floor and this continues 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:24.810
 Please continue 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.810
 this 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:33.360
 Also will be in the form of further Oh first I is from the breath begins after acquisition has been completed 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:43.340
 If it is completed by acquisition completion with yes like this 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:48.169
 When you have to do Well continuation acquisition is not not been completed a posting 

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:55.510
 In these bureaucratic If you do not want to continue diet I'd have Aid am loop 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:05:00.760
 A dialog box will appear Well is to exit to the ok 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:05:03.409
 It is almost like this that the output file is 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:05.870
 Ac from left 

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:09.980
 It is the number of exhibitors 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:12.710
 The lowest price based on the condition we have acquired 

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:20.120
 And it is the postage of that cellar 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:23.230
 Finally, the release date this is Tteyuu those that release date is entered on the 8 product data 

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:26.380
 The will come to the acquisition of Te Release Date and not here 

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:30.250
 For example, using this child release date 

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:34.249
 Do not stand or stand that reservation product of no stock sale 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:38.289

00:05:34.249 --> 00:05:38.289
