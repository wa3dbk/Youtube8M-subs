00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.669
 hello to all and I hope you 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:05.389
 go well today I find for 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:05.389
 the idea to recipes 

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.019
 today we actually live to share 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.030
 with you from recipes I'm doing 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.259
 regularly this moment I am 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.519
 easily even one to two times per 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:16.199
 week because it's quick to do 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.640
 you just have to find the ingredients and 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.320
 after that it's really fast to 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.939
 perform is actually so it's 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.000
 cereal bars or homework in 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.949
 the title like this so these cereals on 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.720
 will she say if I know that a lot 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.980
 do not like this fashion finally I know 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.410
 it's not really the mode it's actually 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.570
 just the term that has the right but after 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.940
 it's healthy eating I do not think that's 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.350
 for a moment I'm a singer a loss of 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.149
 my entourage for example who has already 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.770
 betty who's eating cookies there and 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.239
 believe me this person is really 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.579
 very happy to see things eat 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.710
 delicious without necessarily having disassembled 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:47.969
 of blood sugar so eating m6 is also 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.100
 good for health 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.390
 it's not necessarily a fashion street trips 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.890
 rabelais because I try a lot 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.180
 do not like it so here we go 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.070
 for the recipe I hope you 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.670
 will appreciate in any case me I enjoy 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.670
 Everytime 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.770
 all 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.220
 here we will be able to start at the 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.900
 recipe so I start by placing the 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.210
 hazelnuts fines and chocolate 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.890
 give dender and it just mixes 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.600
 so for us it really works 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.970
 homogeneous groups of finely-numbered 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.650
 marry altogether for example to cut 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.670
 with his third knife at the head of the 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.670
 holy farm nor current 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.690
 Yes 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:26.620
 and now I always ranked is 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:27.970
 an ingredient in the thunder for the 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.530
 banana you have to be careful if you 

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.840
 have a little stroll to ilan be 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:34.570
 whole on the other hand if you have one 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.230
 great as such on the video it's worth 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:37.230
 better to be half 

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.319
 here is my paw is ready now June 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:57.680
 aps heat the oven about 180 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:57.680
 degrees 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:08.230
 he 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:10.300
 now and our bars so here I 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.860
 chose a mold of this shape I would have 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.230
 preferred to find a little narrower 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.030
 but I did not find any 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.890
 finds are fitting not know if we 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.900
 has the chance of my defensive grants 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:21.820
 asylum have found a little bit everywhere 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.780
 after the mold is not required 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.430
 it's just so it's more 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.800
 presentable if you do not have it 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.960
 can simply spread the dough 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:31.920
 in a rectangle dish and cut with 

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.920
 a knife simply 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.689
 and now the ruling 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:07.299
 place in the oven exactly show normally 

00:04:04.689 --> 00:04:09.459
 so that places them at 180 Â° during 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:14.500
 about twenty minutes the 

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:16.479
 time deposits and that's the bins will be 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.000
 finished so you see it's really 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:19.889
 quick to do so no excuses 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.150
 personally I much prefer 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:23.620
 lose ten minutes in my day we 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.600
 allows own cereal bars rather 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.030
 hidden the one in commerce during comic 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:29.949
 it's great for health while 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:31.600
 frankly not at all ceni it's 

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:33.010
 a bass you will not be hungry he dies 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.260
 after that will talk to you during a 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:36.160
 building do not hesitate to like the video
