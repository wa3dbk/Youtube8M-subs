today to talk to David Hassler who is

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.929 
today to talk to David Hassler who is
the<00:00:21.420> mastermind<00:00:22.110> behind<00:00:22.230> the<00:00:22.650> new<00:00:22.939> expression

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
the mastermind behind the new expression

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.410 
the mastermind behind the new expression
system<00:00:24.420> -<00:00:24.720> that's<00:00:25.200> right<00:00:25.529> so<00:00:26.010> tell<00:00:26.369> me<00:00:26.430> what<00:00:27.240> he

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
system - that's right so tell me what he

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.069 
system - that's right so tell me what he
got<00:00:27.630> doing<00:00:28.020> well<00:00:28.890> we<00:00:29.130> started<00:00:29.810> this<00:00:30.810> idea

00:00:31.069 --> 00:00:31.079 
got doing well we started this idea

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:33.890 
got doing well we started this idea
about<00:00:31.439> three<00:00:31.650> years<00:00:31.829> ago<00:00:32.300> but<00:00:33.300> it<00:00:33.480> really

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:33.900 
about three years ago but it really

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.479 
about three years ago but it really
falls<00:00:34.530> on<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.829> back<00:00:35.010> of<00:00:35.190> our<00:00:35.220> first

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
falls on the back of our first

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.340 
falls on the back of our first
expression<00:00:35.940> system<00:00:36.480> that<00:00:36.630> we<00:00:36.780> introduced<00:00:37.140> in

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
expression system that we introduced in

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.610 
expression system that we introduced in
2003<00:00:38.270> that<00:00:39.270> was<00:00:39.420> a<00:00:39.450> completely<00:00:39.840> magnetic

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
2003 that was a completely magnetic

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.100 
2003 that was a completely magnetic
system<00:00:41.130> where<00:00:41.370> we<00:00:41.550> designed<00:00:42.480> all<00:00:42.600> these<00:00:42.750> cool

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
system where we designed all these cool

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.460 
system where we designed all these cool
little<00:00:43.140> things<00:00:43.649> that<00:00:43.890> did<00:00:44.100> stuff<00:00:44.760> and<00:00:45.060> us

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:45.470 
little things that did stuff and us

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:50.030 
little things that did stuff and us
ended<00:00:46.470> up<00:00:46.760> yeah<00:00:48.170> sometimes<00:00:49.170> it<00:00:49.680> ends<00:00:49.950> up

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:50.040 
ended up yeah sometimes it ends up

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.640 
ended up yeah sometimes it ends up
feeling<00:00:50.310> like<00:00:50.490> this<00:00:50.790> stuff<00:00:51.320> but<00:00:52.320> at<00:00:52.440> that<00:00:52.590> time

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:52.650 
feeling like this stuff but at that time

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.360 
feeling like this stuff but at that time
what<00:00:53.070> we<00:00:53.220> had<00:00:53.400> done<00:00:53.580> is<00:00:53.790> we<00:00:53.820> had<00:00:54.180> abandoned<00:00:55.370> the

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
what we had done is we had abandoned the

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.750 
what we had done is we had abandoned the
use<00:00:56.400> of<00:00:56.550> piezo<00:00:57.030> crystals<00:00:57.660> for<00:00:58.350> it<00:00:58.760> assuming

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
use of piezo crystals for it assuming

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.370 
use of piezo crystals for it assuming
that<00:00:59.970> they<00:01:00.090> really<00:01:00.690> couldn't<00:01:01.050> do<00:01:01.140> anything

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:01.380 
that they really couldn't do anything

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.530 
that they really couldn't do anything
for<00:01:01.530> us<00:01:01.860> the<00:01:02.460> traditional<00:01:02.670> sound<00:01:03.180> of<00:01:03.270> piezo

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:03.540 
for us the traditional sound of piezo

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.719 
for us the traditional sound of piezo
crystals<00:01:04.140> that<00:01:04.350> was<00:01:04.530> very<00:01:04.739> compressed<00:01:05.430> and

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
crystals that was very compressed and

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.960 
crystals that was very compressed and
crunchy<00:01:06.180> sounding<00:01:07.040> was<00:01:08.040> something<00:01:08.490> that<00:01:08.520> I<00:01:08.729> as

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
crunchy sounding was something that I as

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.870 
crunchy sounding was something that I as
a<00:01:09.000> player<00:01:09.360> all<00:01:09.630> through<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:09.960> 80s<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:10.880> even

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
a player all through the 80s and even

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.450 
a player all through the 80s and even
earlier<00:01:12.240> than<00:01:12.450> that<00:01:12.560> really<00:01:13.560> it<00:01:14.009> just<00:01:14.250> didn't

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
earlier than that really it just didn't

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.349 
earlier than that really it just didn't
work<00:01:14.520> onstage<00:01:15.030> for<00:01:15.299> me<00:01:15.420> and<00:01:15.750> then<00:01:16.439> in<00:01:17.179> the<00:01:18.179> late

00:01:18.349 --> 00:01:18.359 
work onstage for me and then in the late

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:21.109 
work onstage for me and then in the late
90s<00:01:19.079> I<00:01:19.350> got<00:01:19.560> together<00:01:19.740> with<00:01:19.979> Rupert<00:01:20.490> Neve<00:01:20.670> who

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
90s I got together with Rupert Neve who

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.870 
90s I got together with Rupert Neve who
was<00:01:21.359> a<00:01:22.159> probably<00:01:23.159> a<00:01:23.219> lot<00:01:23.369> of<00:01:23.490> your<00:01:23.609> audience

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
was a probably a lot of your audience

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.300 
was a probably a lot of your audience
will<00:01:24.119> know<00:01:24.270> who<00:01:24.390> he<00:01:24.479> was<00:01:24.630> and<00:01:25.069> Rupert<00:01:26.069> and<00:01:26.189> I

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
will know who he was and Rupert and I

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.099 
will know who he was and Rupert and I
began<00:01:26.609> working<00:01:26.880> on<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.270> first<00:01:27.509> expression

00:01:28.099 --> 00:01:28.109 
began working on the first expression

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:30.230 
began working on the first expression
system<00:01:28.530> Rupert's<00:01:29.369> background<00:01:29.999> in

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
system Rupert's background in

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.830 
system Rupert's background in
transformers<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:32.509> things<00:01:33.509> of<00:01:33.689> that<00:01:33.719> nature

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
transformers and things of that nature

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.989 
transformers and things of that nature
led<00:01:34.499> us<00:01:34.649> in<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.039> direction<00:01:35.310> of<00:01:35.460> a<00:01:35.609> magnetic

00:01:35.989 --> 00:01:35.999 
led us in the direction of a magnetic

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:40.520 
led us in the direction of a magnetic
system<00:01:36.600> so<00:01:37.350> then<00:01:37.859> flash<00:01:38.280> forward<00:01:39.229> about<00:01:40.229> ten

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
system so then flash forward about ten

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.919 
system so then flash forward about ten
years<00:01:40.829> of<00:01:41.159> success<00:01:41.759> in<00:01:42.060> that<00:01:42.090> particular

00:01:42.919 --> 00:01:42.929 
years of success in that particular

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:46.599 
years of success in that particular
pickup<00:01:43.289> system<00:01:43.499> and<00:01:44.069> I<00:01:44.999> was<00:01:45.209> in<00:01:45.450> Amsterdam

00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:46.609 
pickup system and I was in Amsterdam

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:50.870 
pickup system and I was in Amsterdam
setting<00:01:47.609> up<00:01:47.759> our<00:01:49.340> headquarters<00:01:50.340> there<00:01:50.609> my

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
setting up our headquarters there my

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.609 
setting up our headquarters there my
wife<00:01:51.060> and<00:01:51.270> I<00:01:51.299> went<00:01:51.509> there<00:01:51.689> for<00:01:51.749> a<00:01:51.929> year<00:01:52.200> to<00:01:52.350> set

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
wife and I went there for a year to set

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.949 
wife and I went there for a year to set
that<00:01:52.799> up<00:01:52.859> I<00:01:53.219> was<00:01:54.119> walking<00:01:54.450> through<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.659> repair

00:01:54.949 --> 00:01:54.959 
that up I was walking through the repair

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:57.649 
that up I was walking through the repair
shop<00:01:54.990> one<00:01:55.409> day<00:01:55.439> and<00:01:55.859> had<00:01:56.249> was<00:01:57.029> just<00:01:57.270> looking<00:01:57.539> at

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
shop one day and had was just looking at

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.529 
shop one day and had was just looking at
guitars<00:01:57.990> and<00:01:58.520> thinking<00:01:59.520> about<00:01:59.670> don't<00:02:00.299> laugh

00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:00.539 
guitars and thinking about don't laugh

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:07.819 
guitars and thinking about don't laugh
my<00:02:01.020> days<00:02:01.259> in<00:02:01.289> the<00:02:01.619> circus<00:02:02.069> and<00:02:05.299> okay<00:02:06.299> no<00:02:06.479> I<00:02:06.829> and

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
my days in the circus and okay no I and

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.469 
my days in the circus and okay no I and
actually<00:02:08.429> I<00:02:08.520> was<00:02:08.729> looking<00:02:09.149> at<00:02:09.240> the<00:02:09.360> guitar

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
actually I was looking at the guitar

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.240 
actually I was looking at the guitar
thinking<00:02:10.080> about<00:02:10.229> some<00:02:10.380> laser<00:02:10.590> work<00:02:10.950> we<00:02:11.130> had

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
thinking about some laser work we had

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.059 
thinking about some laser work we had
done<00:02:11.430> and<00:02:12.030> I<00:02:12.480> was<00:02:12.660> remembering<00:02:13.290> how<00:02:13.740> when<00:02:13.950> we

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
done and I was remembering how when we

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.730 
done and I was remembering how when we
used<00:02:14.220> to<00:02:14.250> put<00:02:14.459> the<00:02:14.550> tent<00:02:14.790> up<00:02:15.319> you<00:02:16.319> always<00:02:16.470> have

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
used to put the tent up you always have

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.650 
used to put the tent up you always have
this<00:02:16.860> the<00:02:17.700> outs<00:02:17.849> that<00:02:18.090> you<00:02:18.180> have<00:02:18.300> to<00:02:18.390> Center

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
this the outs that you have to Center

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.270 
this the outs that you have to Center
poles<00:02:18.900> quarter<00:02:19.319> poles<00:02:19.530> and<00:02:19.830> all<00:02:19.890> the<00:02:20.010> way<00:02:20.099> down

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
poles quarter poles and all the way down

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.770 
poles quarter poles and all the way down
then<00:02:20.520> you<00:02:20.610> have<00:02:20.760> the<00:02:20.850> outside<00:02:21.000> pole<00:02:21.510> which

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
then you have the outside pole which

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.210 
then you have the outside pole which
kind<00:02:22.530> of<00:02:22.590> stands<00:02:23.010> up<00:02:23.160> there<00:02:23.370> and<00:02:23.550> the<00:02:23.640> tents

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
kind of stands up there and the tents

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.430 
kind of stands up there and the tents
down<00:02:24.370> to<00:02:24.610> it<00:02:24.730> and<00:02:24.880> then<00:02:25.570> you<00:02:25.720> have<00:02:25.870> a<00:02:25.900> pulley<00:02:26.290> or

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
down to it and then you have a pulley or

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:28.740 
down to it and then you have a pulley or
rope<00:02:26.860> and<00:02:27.130> of<00:02:27.670> course<00:02:27.910> when<00:02:28.090> you<00:02:28.210> tighten<00:02:28.480> it

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
rope and of course when you tighten it

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.460 
rope and of course when you tighten it
it<00:02:29.230> goes<00:02:29.580> like<00:02:30.580> that<00:02:30.610> and<00:02:31.090> then<00:02:31.930> it's<00:02:32.140> a<00:02:32.260> wind

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
it goes like that and then it's a wind

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.550 
it goes like that and then it's a wind
blows<00:02:32.770> on<00:02:33.040> the<00:02:33.130> tent<00:02:33.430> it<00:02:33.730> goes<00:02:34.000> like<00:02:34.270> this<00:02:34.560> and

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:35.560 
blows on the tent it goes like this and

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.590 
blows on the tent it goes like this and
I<00:02:36.250> started<00:02:36.460> thinking<00:02:36.940> about<00:02:37.030> some<00:02:37.360> laser

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:37.600 
I started thinking about some laser

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.460 
I started thinking about some laser
images<00:02:38.260> that<00:02:38.500> we<00:02:38.680> had<00:02:38.920> seen<00:02:39.250> and<00:02:40.230> thought<00:02:41.230> is

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:41.470 
images that we had seen and thought is

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.980 
images that we had seen and thought is
it<00:02:41.890> possible<00:02:42.460> that<00:02:42.520> we're<00:02:42.990> misunderstanding

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:43.990 
it possible that we're misunderstanding

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:48.120 
it possible that we're misunderstanding
how<00:02:44.290> a<00:02:44.320> guitar<00:02:44.620> actually<00:02:45.220> works<00:02:45.460> and<00:02:46.890> and<00:02:47.890> that

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
how a guitar actually works and and that

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:49.970 
how a guitar actually works and and that
was<00:02:48.280> really<00:02:48.610> kind<00:02:48.790> of<00:02:48.940> the<00:02:49.000> germ<00:02:49.300> of<00:02:49.330> the<00:02:49.480> idea

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
was really kind of the germ of the idea

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.220 
was really kind of the germ of the idea
and<00:02:50.980> what<00:02:51.670> we<00:02:51.880> ended<00:02:52.150> up<00:02:52.300> doing<00:02:52.510> was<00:02:52.930> taking

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
and what we ended up doing was taking

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.150 
and what we ended up doing was taking
and<00:02:54.240> doing<00:02:55.240> some<00:02:55.420> experiments<00:02:56.170> and<00:02:56.290> that<00:02:56.830> led

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:57.160 
and doing some experiments and that led

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.949 
and doing some experiments and that led
us<00:02:57.190> to<00:02:57.520> where<00:02:57.640> we<00:02:57.820> are<00:02:57.940> now<00:02:58.180> that's<00:02:58.630> a<00:02:58.780> lot<00:02:58.930> of

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
us to where we are now that's a lot of

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:02.430 
us to where we are now that's a lot of
talking<00:02:59.320> into<00:02:59.740> your<00:02:59.800> first<00:03:01.140> you<00:03:02.140> got<00:03:02.230> a<00:03:02.260> lot

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
talking into your first you got a lot

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.810 
talking into your first you got a lot
going<00:03:02.740> on<00:03:02.830> here<00:03:03.959> well<00:03:04.959> fundamentally<00:03:05.820> for

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
going on here well fundamentally for

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.640 
going on here well fundamentally for
years<00:03:07.090> everybody<00:03:07.660> has<00:03:07.900> assumed<00:03:08.320> when<00:03:08.530> you

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
years everybody has assumed when you

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.230 
years everybody has assumed when you
play<00:03:08.890> the<00:03:09.070> guitar<00:03:09.160> that<00:03:09.430> the<00:03:09.760> saddle<00:03:10.150> is

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:10.240 
play the guitar that the saddle is

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:14.550 
play the guitar that the saddle is
bouncing<00:03:10.690> up<00:03:10.780> and<00:03:10.959> down<00:03:12.330> our<00:03:13.530> what<00:03:14.530> we

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
bouncing up and down our what we

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.770 
bouncing up and down our what we
actually<00:03:15.130> were<00:03:15.550> suspecting<00:03:16.240> was<00:03:16.420> that<00:03:16.630> it's

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
actually were suspecting was that it's

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.630 
actually were suspecting was that it's
not<00:03:16.990> bouncing<00:03:17.620> up<00:03:17.770> and<00:03:17.920> down<00:03:18.010> but<00:03:18.310> that<00:03:18.459> is

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:18.640 
not bouncing up and down but that is

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.540 
not bouncing up and down but that is
actually<00:03:19.030> doing<00:03:19.300> this<00:03:19.740> okay<00:03:20.740> okay<00:03:20.920> and<00:03:21.340> that's

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:21.550 
actually doing this okay okay and that's

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:24.060 
actually doing this okay okay and that's
where<00:03:21.700> that<00:03:21.820> tentpole<00:03:22.390> idea<00:03:22.780> came<00:03:23.020> from<00:03:23.050> so<00:03:23.860> we

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
where that tentpole idea came from so we

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.760 
where that tentpole idea came from so we
were<00:03:24.220> able<00:03:24.459> at<00:03:24.940> that<00:03:25.209> point<00:03:25.480> to<00:03:25.840> look<00:03:26.290> ins<00:03:26.530> in

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:26.770 
were able at that point to look ins in

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:30.300 
were able at that point to look ins in
and<00:03:27.280> do<00:03:27.940> some<00:03:28.150> laser<00:03:28.420> imaging<00:03:28.780> on<00:03:29.380> this<00:03:29.830> saddle

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
and do some laser imaging on this saddle

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.280 
and do some laser imaging on this saddle
to<00:03:30.519> see<00:03:30.760> what's<00:03:31.090> it<00:03:31.269> do<00:03:31.390> is<00:03:31.690> there<00:03:31.900> something

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:32.290 
to see what's it do is there something

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.650 
to see what's it do is there something
going<00:03:32.320> on<00:03:32.709> up<00:03:32.980> and<00:03:33.130> down<00:03:33.220> or<00:03:33.970> is<00:03:34.209> it<00:03:34.360> actually

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:34.660 
going on up and down or is it actually

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.220 
going on up and down or is it actually
going<00:03:34.840> this<00:03:35.080> way<00:03:35.230> and<00:03:35.530> what<00:03:35.709> we<00:03:35.890> did<00:03:36.190> see<00:03:36.459> was

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
going this way and what we did see was

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.750 
going this way and what we did see was
the<00:03:38.230> saddle<00:03:38.620> actually<00:03:38.950> doesn't<00:03:39.310> move<00:03:39.430> up<00:03:39.610> and

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
the saddle actually doesn't move up and

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.060 
the saddle actually doesn't move up and
down<00:03:39.910> anywhere<00:03:40.660> so<00:03:41.050> this<00:03:41.350> putting<00:03:41.620> a<00:03:41.830> pickup

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:42.070 
down anywhere so this putting a pickup

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:44.910 
down anywhere so this putting a pickup
under<00:03:42.580> the<00:03:42.700> saddle<00:03:43.200> was<00:03:44.200> really<00:03:44.590> the<00:03:44.739> wrong

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
under the saddle was really the wrong

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.940 
under the saddle was really the wrong
place<00:03:45.480> but<00:03:46.480> in<00:03:46.690> this<00:03:46.930> sort<00:03:47.350> of<00:03:47.470> movement<00:03:47.709> in

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:47.950 
place but in this sort of movement in

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:49.590 
place but in this sort of movement in
this<00:03:48.100> direction<00:03:48.160> you<00:03:48.700> can<00:03:49.000> kind<00:03:49.300> of<00:03:49.390> guess

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:49.600 
this direction you can kind of guess

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:52.800 
this direction you can kind of guess
what<00:03:49.840> we<00:03:49.959> did<00:03:50.200> I<00:03:50.500> called<00:03:51.489> my<00:03:51.700> assistant<00:03:51.850> Dave

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
what we did I called my assistant Dave

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.120 
what we did I called my assistant Dave
ER<00:03:53.549> or<00:03:54.549> so<00:03:54.730> it<00:03:54.850> says<00:03:55.060> on<00:03:55.239> his<00:03:55.390> shirt<00:03:55.630> and<00:03:55.989> I<00:03:56.890> said

00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:57.130 
ER or so it says on his shirt and I said

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:58.800 
ER or so it says on his shirt and I said
hey<00:03:57.310> listen<00:03:57.640> I<00:03:57.790> want<00:03:58.180> you<00:03:58.209> to<00:03:58.330> just<00:03:58.420> route<00:03:58.780> a

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
hey listen I want you to just route a

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.100 
hey listen I want you to just route a
slot<00:03:59.530> behind<00:03:59.980> the<00:04:00.100> saddle<00:04:00.360> think<00:04:01.360> that<00:04:01.540> that

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:02.110 
slot behind the saddle think that that

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:03.960 
slot behind the saddle think that that
pick<00:04:02.290> up<00:04:02.440> out<00:04:02.590> from<00:04:02.769> underneath<00:04:03.040> it<00:04:03.310> turn<00:04:03.790> it

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
pick up out from underneath it turn it

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.810 
pick up out from underneath it turn it
sideways<00:04:04.360> and<00:04:05.019> just<00:04:05.440> push<00:04:06.160> it<00:04:06.190> down<00:04:06.489> in<00:04:06.640> there

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:06.820 
sideways and just push it down in there

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:09.930 
sideways and just push it down in there
and<00:04:07.600> push<00:04:08.410> it<00:04:08.530> up<00:04:08.650> against<00:04:09.010> the<00:04:09.040> saddle<00:04:09.459> so<00:04:09.790> if

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
and push it up against the saddle so if

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.490 
and push it up against the saddle so if
that's<00:04:10.150> working<00:04:10.420> we<00:04:10.780> should<00:04:10.810> actually<00:04:11.170> get

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:11.500 
that's working we should actually get

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.370 
that's working we should actually get
more<00:04:11.680> energy<00:04:12.160> and<00:04:12.340> we<00:04:12.459> should<00:04:12.700> understand

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
more energy and we should understand

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.500 
more energy and we should understand
something<00:04:14.380> different<00:04:14.830> he<00:04:15.370> did<00:04:15.610> that<00:04:15.850> he<00:04:16.239> came

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:16.510 
something different he did that he came

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:18.420 
something different he did that he came
back<00:04:16.720> he<00:04:16.900> said<00:04:16.930> it's<00:04:17.290> like<00:04:17.470> twice<00:04:17.799> as<00:04:18.040> loud<00:04:18.220> as

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:18.430 
back he said it's like twice as loud as

that's so you know it kind of went

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:59.580 
that's so you know it kind of went
instantly<00:04:56.830> into<00:04:57.069> some<00:04:57.250> beta<00:04:57.490> testing<00:04:58.120> and<00:04:58.590> we

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
instantly into some beta testing and we

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:02.129 
instantly into some beta testing and we
realized<00:04:59.979> you<00:05:00.340> know<00:05:01.000> there<00:05:01.300> is<00:05:01.479> more<00:05:01.870> to<00:05:01.930> it

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:02.139 
realized you know there is more to it

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:05.100

than<00:05:02.949> what<00:05:03.310> we<00:05:03.460> had<00:05:03.610> thought<00:05:03.849> and<00:05:04.360> of<00:05:04.900> course

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.110 
than what we had thought and of course

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.350 
than what we had thought and of course
from<00:05:05.860> there<00:05:06.069> just<00:05:06.370> kind<00:05:06.580> of<00:05:06.639> grew<00:05:06.849> into<00:05:06.879> what

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
from there just kind of grew into what

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.930 
from there just kind of grew into what
it<00:05:07.479> is<00:05:07.659> now
