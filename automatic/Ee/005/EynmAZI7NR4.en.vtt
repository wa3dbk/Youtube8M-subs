small<00:00:15.870> food<00:00:16.020> I<00:00:16.260> had<00:00:16.350> a<00:00:16.379> lot<00:00:16.590> more<00:00:16.770> but<00:00:16.949> I<00:00:17.010> made<00:00:17.190> a

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
small food I had a lot more but I made a

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.820 
small food I had a lot more but I made a
first<00:00:17.490> video<00:00:17.760> and<00:00:18.029> fed<00:00:18.210> them<00:00:18.390> a<00:00:18.420> lot<00:00:18.680> but<00:00:19.680> the

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
first video and fed them a lot but the

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.439 
first video and fed them a lot but the

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:39.320 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.830 

tread<00:00:40.350> this<00:00:40.739> is<00:00:40.890> stair<00:00:41.100> tread<00:00:41.340> by<00:00:41.489> 3m<00:00:41.940> it<00:00:42.420> was

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
tread this is stair tread by 3m it was

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.560 
tread this is stair tread by 3m it was
like<00:00:43.020> $6<00:00:43.590> which<00:00:43.770> is<00:00:43.920> really<00:00:44.250> expensive<00:00:44.550> but<00:00:44.969> it

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
like $6 which is really expensive but it

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:47.600 
like $6 which is really expensive but it
works<00:00:45.719> really<00:00:45.809> well<00:00:46.129> and<00:00:47.129> I<00:00:47.309> will<00:00:47.460> be

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
works really well and I will be

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.610 
works really well and I will be
replacing<00:00:47.850> it<00:00:48.270> because<00:00:48.989> mochi<00:00:49.320> peed<00:00:49.469> all<00:00:49.590> over

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
replacing it because mochi peed all over

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:50.000 
replacing it because mochi peed all over
it

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
it

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.340 
it
you<00:00:50.250> can<00:00:50.399> also<00:00:50.520> use<00:00:50.820> rubber<00:00:51.149> tread<00:00:51.570> which

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
you can also use rubber tread which

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.600 
you can also use rubber tread which
works<00:00:52.530> just<00:00:52.649> as<00:00:52.860> well<00:00:52.890> and<00:00:53.070> you<00:00:53.160> can<00:00:53.190> clean<00:00:53.489> it

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
works just as well and you can clean it

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.970

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
really easily but I like this because it

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.459 
really easily but I like this because it
wears<00:00:56.160> down<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.399> nails<00:00:56.699> a<00:00:56.910> lot<00:00:57.270> Marv<00:00:58.230> don't

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.340 
to get them or not um your ramp is going
to<00:01:45.360> be<00:01:45.530> 27<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:46.890> 25<00:01:47.280> inches<00:01:47.460> -<00:01:48.299> 25<00:01:48.750> is<00:01:49.079> a<00:01:49.110> bit

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
to be 27 to 25 inches - 25 is a bit

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.880 
to be 27 to 25 inches - 25 is a bit
steep<00:01:49.619> so<00:01:50.520> I<00:01:50.549> would<00:01:50.850> recommend<00:01:51.030> 27<00:01:51.930> inches<00:01:52.619> but

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
steep so I would recommend 27 inches but

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.219 
steep so I would recommend 27 inches but
um<00:01:53.040> it<00:01:53.729> works<00:01:54.000> just<00:01:54.299> fine<00:01:54.420> you'd<00:01:54.750> be<00:01:54.869> surprised

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
um it works just fine you'd be surprised

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.350 
um it works just fine you'd be surprised
what<00:01:55.439> they<00:01:55.560> can<00:01:55.740> get<00:01:55.829> up<00:01:55.979> and<00:01:56.100> down<00:01:56.280> but<00:01:57.060> the

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
what they can get up and down but the

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.139 
what they can get up and down but the
older<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.960> Pig<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.619> less<00:01:59.520> steep<00:01:59.790> your<00:01:59.969> ramp

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
older the Pig the less steep your ramp

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.139 
older the Pig the less steep your ramp
should<00:02:00.299> definitely<00:02:00.630> be<00:02:00.750> um<00:02:01.880> another<00:02:02.880> thing

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
should definitely be um another thing

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.789 
should definitely be um another thing
that<00:02:03.299> you<00:02:03.360> can<00:02:03.450> do<00:02:03.570> is<00:02:03.750> have<00:02:03.960> motivation<00:02:04.380> which

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
that you can do is have motivation which

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.280 
that you can do is have motivation which
is<00:02:04.920> food<00:02:05.159> I<00:02:05.479> just<00:02:06.479> liked<00:02:06.630> having<00:02:06.719> my<00:02:06.990> food<00:02:07.170> in

is food I just liked having my food in

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.040 
is food I just liked having my food in
loft<00:02:07.500> because<00:02:07.770> it<00:02:07.979> keeps<00:02:08.099> it<00:02:08.250> a<00:02:08.399> bit<00:02:08.580> cleaner

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
loft because it keeps it a bit cleaner

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.380 
loft because it keeps it a bit cleaner
but<00:02:10.050> ignore<00:02:10.950> about<00:02:11.160> how<00:02:11.280> my<00:02:11.489> see<00:02:11.550> the<00:02:11.730> cages<00:02:12.209> I

ramp<00:02:41.350> is<00:02:41.560> so<00:02:41.860> they<00:02:42.010> can<00:02:42.220> maybe<00:02:42.400> go<00:02:42.640> down<00:02:42.670> it

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
ramp is so they can maybe go down it

mookie<00:02:43.720> was<00:02:43.840> really<00:02:44.140> good<00:02:44.290> at<00:02:44.380> going<00:02:44.530> down<00:02:44.739> but

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
mookie was really good at going down but

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.650 
mookie was really good at going down but
she<00:02:45.100> just<00:02:45.280> didn't<00:02:45.550> like<00:02:45.640> going<00:02:45.910> up<00:02:46.120> the<00:02:46.480> ramp

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
she just didn't like going up the ramp

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.080 
she just didn't like going up the ramp
and<00:02:46.810> the<00:02:46.930> other<00:02:47.140> cage<00:02:47.640> she<00:02:48.640> still<00:02:48.850> doesn't

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
and the other cage she still doesn't

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:51.090 
and the other cage she still doesn't
like<00:02:49.239> the<00:02:49.390> loft<00:02:49.570> as<00:02:49.780> much<00:02:50.080> Bomar<00:02:50.530> does<00:02:50.769> because

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
like the loft as much Bomar does because
