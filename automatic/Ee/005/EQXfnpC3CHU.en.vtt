00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:05.270
 woke up and screwed up , everybody 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.270
 resolve 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:19.220
 the staff is fine, so today I came here 

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:20.810
 do this tutorial because I woke up 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.650
 with the swollen eye I woke up with that 

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.330
 orixÃ¡ 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.670
 now you can see why he 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:29.570
 Decreased well I also love you makeup 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:32.180
 hence I had to leave and I was not going to leave 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.300
 with the eye all right mattock 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.560
 Then I went through makeup I thought our 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.630
 it would be interesting to make a video 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.590
 showing what to do when you have the 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:42.530
 swollen foot 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:45.560
 at first do not pass makeup 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.990
 but how do you have situations that you need 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:50.210
 it is minimally presentable so 

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:52.870
 as makeup did not want without makeup 

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:56.180
 I'll stay presentable but you 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:58.340
 ends up having to use it so it's an event 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.310
 something for this you need 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:03.470
 make up was even released myself 

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:07.700
 I think this is a good tip so then 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:09.680
 when you have an eye on the environment 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.360
 I think it's more to guide you like this. 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:17.149
 which has cord twine when I opened the 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:19.820
 My strange is because you use only color 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:21.950
 ismat so you bring nothing to 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:25.670
 front a shoulder swelling because 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:26.630
 remembering that you shine you stand out behind 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.359
 forward 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:32.899
 Diva's Pass You Decrease You 

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:33.740
 push back a poor until you give a 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:35.479
 Spotlight 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.340
 okay then why when we do 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:40.939
 contour on face 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:43.429
 speak to use a powder that is dark and 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:45.109
 matt because what has to shine back 

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:48.229
 for example here I can 

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:50.179
 illuminator however you over looks the 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:51.469
 my cheek more defined so the 

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:54.079
 bone, right? 

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:56.329
 So that's what I was thinking about. 

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:59.869
 I made this eye, you can do it too. 

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:02.270
 only outlined is black only for 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:04.130
 try to match the shape of the eyes 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:06.590
 it's good but this is a little bit more 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.450
 elaborate but super simple too 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.709
 I think it was more the introduction of 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.410
 final product 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:14.840
 well it would take to do it, I hope 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.350
 You like me and until the next time. 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.350
 Let's see the video. 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.140
 Good, I already spent more printer are you? 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.350
 can use any kind of anything 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:28.180
 shadow you have until corrective war 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.700
 its own base itself can be seen 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:34.600
 more shadow and let's start with 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:36.940
 this brown brown shadow the pact is good 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:41.560
 any shade a clothes you have 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:46.780
 I'll take the cuddly brush like that. 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:49.000
 there for all my snake there now look 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.620
 Just how simple it was, right? 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.040
 I'm going to take this application potential 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:56.230
 It's fine, it's synthetic so much. 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:59.260
 is is and I'll get a little bit the 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.940
 black shadow that's fine, well tall 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:04.120
 opaque 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:09.700
 It's good in the same collective I had and I'm going 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:11.980
 tidy up the eyelash line ready 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:13.989
 Look how the only thing left now 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.570
 Doing that is left to do 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:20.550
 take what's left of the brush and vanish 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:20.550
 on the line like that 

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:32.870
 If you want you can skip this 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.400
 Step because it's really there that leaves 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.129
 a little heavier a little bit 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:40.580
 more worked for the eyes then 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:42.590
 Only thing left to do is shade. 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.300
 It's finally over with a mask 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.970
 I had passed before I started a 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:49.910
 video're walking I can is that the 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:54.950
 maybelline colossal and then the 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:04:01.190
 process that is the most important 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:03.470
 Yes, it's okay, let's go to the face with 

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:05.630
 I think it's cool when it comes to the face. 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:08.120
 also cloudy you put on a blush 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:09.920
 scientific rosette with a face expelled 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:13.129
 It looks good with white blush 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:16.010
 I think it's cool, I spent the one that is 11 

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:19.370
 is the honorable pope half burned if one 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:21.380
 flower power and mac too and there it is 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:24.979
 I think the contrast of the 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:31.120
 brightness of the skin with opacity of the eyes 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:35.810
 so I also passed an opaque illuminator 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:38.180
 Illuminator hence he is super 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:40.610
 bright taboo it's called the sap has 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.450
 inside and I had a lot of trouble using 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:44.240
 he 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:48.050
 I thought not of the daytime trial 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:49.910
 It was our beautiful impossible but I discovered 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:52.610
 What can I use so I tried? 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:54.289
 I took a risk and I liked it a lot 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:58.849
 if you pass with a brush as soon as 

00:04:54.289 --> 00:05:00.500
 it's kind of a broomstick application 

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:05.210
 ends up being much lighter gives a brightness 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:12.889
 very nice here too so now for 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:15.289
 lips on my lips I passed first 

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:17.750
 a counter in which he is very bright and 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:23.270
 Leave me abc I consider myself well wet 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:26.090
 from that branch the abn news banks to the course 

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:27.110
 gives a good hydration and a shine 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:29.560
 very intense 

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:33.860
 over there to keep this kitchen 

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:35.570
 I passed that lipstick on the grass 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:37.880
 that calls lava in branches 

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:38.949
 The fact that line creamy heat 

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:42.199
 intense 

00:05:38.949 --> 00:05:46.430
 very beautiful but I think he stays 

00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:48.830
 very long time so pink for the 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:50.210
 bullet pass when the day is 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:51.590
 cloudy 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:53.330
 I hope you have enjoyed this 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:55.490
 tutorial that he is very fast and well 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:57.830
 simple and very versatile to do if 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:06:00.590
 would have an eye so much for the day 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:02.660
 how much for the night can change the colors 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:04.880
 but remembering the concepts 

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:07.970
 So, any doubt that the 

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:09.169
 suggestion as you know is just to leave and 

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:24.530
 to the next 

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:33.650
 the capacity you do not have to find that 

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:35.840
 you enjoy it okay so that's hope 

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:40.310
 that you have enjoyed sensory well 

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:42.020
