00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.329
 you remember the spots mascot celleneuve but not here 

00:00:11.329 --> 00:00:14.379
 why as said previously in question not as we know it is 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:17.659
 well and it's really at this post of m that's it 

00:00:17.659 --> 00:00:20.819
 being released product to that I needed Africans to test the game 

00:00:20.819 --> 00:00:24.029
 the American Mass does not have too much difference and many others come 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.009
 just audio and video output that are there team stickers and I have 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:30.199
 use this big thing to pass the tram 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:33.199
 we see here 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.550
 President Pierre Bordry in a doubt of anything 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.860
 the home screen is perceived as the drink of the same name so we have the 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.740
 game the options the incomes that I will opt for later in his game 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.850
 it's a derivative of the hotel even simpler the goal of the game is to have the 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.070
 more chips of his color on the board if we move a box the 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.680
 others multiply if we move few boxes the game turns multiply 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:58.170
 all over 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.480
 they move right and as soon as we touch a little all the other colors 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.610
 the color of our skin changes 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:04.450
 here 

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:07.890
 it's the game good 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.210
 they perceived as a rotten screen 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.210
 an average and squatte animation does not appear 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.390
 musical nothing 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.910
 because the minimum 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:23.910
 stylist the little fireworks 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.560
 1 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.450
 where is moved 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.680
 alas if I win we have a rotten screen an average animation the spot that 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:37.640
 does not appear 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.750
 so the work-shaped stuff that just passed I think it's just 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.470
 the moving crowd 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.470
 yes the moving crowd 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.090
 dcm 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.189
 the exploit in paris until then and during the displacements 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:55.420
 but we can transfer his movements but until the options and suddenly 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.420
 I do not see so much relationship among others it's this game 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.070
 paris can also play four visibly and make his own 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:05.070
 tray 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.410
 that is to say, boxes 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:08.839
 that's all 

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:12.339
 in fact we make it very quickly the turn is very very we know we have no 

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:15.529
 menu for offside so if during a game we are losing against 

00:02:15.529 --> 00:02:18.819
 the cuba computer and you have to wait until you have completely lost 

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:22.889
 or so get up on isere 

00:02:22.889 --> 00:02:26.319
 and I think that at 60 dollars the game cartridge having now to be 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:28.709
 very annoyed 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:30.569
 in the following advice it 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:34.629
 one act no coffee spot two more 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:36.309
 his life is beautiful 

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:38.979
 they know how to make a copy the others whether or not they were anything 

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:40.830
 do something more than 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.830
 Marc Juston 

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:49.199
 and the parties are not even red 

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:52.199
 apart spot it's all 

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:55.939
 the French ambassador with their wake
