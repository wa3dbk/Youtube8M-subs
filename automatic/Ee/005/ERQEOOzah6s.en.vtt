00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.599

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.320
 very fast group very time consuming what 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.570

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.789
 the shooting is rolling here on the river was 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.320
 a black or less cleaning that was going to be 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.150
 black drama I mean that every time 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.859

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.030
 But even though, merry christmas, I did not have 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.539

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.070
 I did not have time to kill our self. 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.530
 I had time to wish for you before 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.910
 because it is very busy for me since 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:54.629

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.600
 here is how she talking about christmas is a 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.060
 when we meet with the family 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.549

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:00.250

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:01.780
 look there looking for there looking for is e 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.790

 cool characters and even our tomiauto 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.940
 boasting cool, but the channel was 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.070
 Something that I started dude did not 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.980
 sorry no one headshot leave 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:21.790
 sequels do not repeat no minute has 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:23.410
 that taking of me knew that I had taken 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:25.390
 damn good 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.620
 It was something we did not ask me for it 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.850
 play on my foot 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:32.560
 there hey looks at the bastard his gun on 

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:36.100
 The day that will stay behind me I 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:39.850
 I want to be able to pick up a knife and when 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:41.680
 where she sang from 2013 that's when 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:46.000
 The beggar has appeared, and it will take 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:48.070
 many other chapters hate who plays 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.110
 of any type of shot-gun in td and 

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:52.690
 michael day I know the map is small 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.670
 and that it is fitting to play with shock 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.850
 Understand but I do not have the tail face. 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:03.970
 Because I do not know, I hate it, it's only on. 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:10.660
 shot-gun shooting of Dean here is my 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:12.880
 God, this guy and people who want to 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.660
 amano for me to take a shot of the law here 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.519
 again 

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.250
 Who are you trying to start a channel? 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:21.280
 now in 2003 guys the only tip I 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:23.680
 Dou you need to invest in your channel 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:26.980
 really invest not only money 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.840
 just have a fuck and I do not know how to buy there 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.190
 many original games do not know 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.480
 it is not this type of investment that 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.209
 I'm talking logic, you have to have this 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.160
 type of investment but also the best 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:38.769
 investment that has the most difficult 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.930
 It is also the guy time investment 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:43.930
 has a channel on youtube requires a lot 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:46.239
 Time I make the most effort 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:49.450
 I could kill 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:51.610
 then I make the maximum effort possible 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:53.590
 to have time for my channel I have 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:59.250
 very little face time to have a car 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:04:02.730
 up there I'm stuck with karbiak died 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:04.560
 on the other hand, she is dead 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.540
 and I have very little time on my channel 

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:07.350
 but even so I do it with much 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.090
 proud 

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:10.380
 logical that you need to have all the time 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.750
 the world to also have a channel in the 

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:15.120
 youtube but if you want something so cool 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:17.160
 something cool, you're going to have to dedicate a 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.750
 little time where you have to're giving 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.540
 attention of your subscribers for your channel 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:23.130
 for your feed and etc. 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:24.450
 so that's the message that I left the pope 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.980
 what a fright 

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:28.650
 this message that I leave to you a 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:30.750
 happy 2013 for you guys will have a lot 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:32.850
 cool thing in 2013 on channel galera 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:35.280
