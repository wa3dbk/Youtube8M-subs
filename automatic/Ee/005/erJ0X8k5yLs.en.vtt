00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:05.109
 well here in art season we are 

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:07.000
 tearing off with delicious recipes 

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:09.760
 now let's make a tip that I am 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.200
 same goat that you tun tun tun to me 

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.140
 I really like this dip 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.910
 for several reasons the cheese is very rich 

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:18.070
 we are talking about cheeses that have 

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.439
 almost all the same caloric value and 

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:23.320
 You can also accompany it with fruits or 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:24.819
 vegetables or crackers then like 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:26.380
 quite versatile alves to the 

00:00:24.819 --> 00:00:28.220
 ingredients of this recipe so that 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.910
 write down in house 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:35.149
 for this recipe we will use 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:37.790
 then half a cup of cheese low 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:40.220
 in fat half a teaspoon of vinegar 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:43.220
 white wine three quarters of a cup 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:45.440
 skim milk 200 grams of cheese 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.809
 goat crumbled a clove of garlic 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.480
 finely chopped salt and pepper to taste 

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:52.040
 2 peeled carrots in half canes 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.890
 peeled jicama and in canes and half 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:57.829
 peeled cucumber and on sticks was already in 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:02.140
 the pepito joke that comes to the 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:04.770
 church and ask for a banana you do not know 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:07.659
 there's why I'm so bad for the 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:09.880
 good jokes 

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:12.249
 I am very bad we tell jokes but it was 

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:16.200
 something that they said to him peeled and others of 

00:01:12.249 --> 00:01:16.200
 new with shells already knows 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.990
 ay si they greeted at home and so 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.659
 You can send me where I am 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.759
 sad ferrys wheelers because they believe 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:28.930
 is that I need this is that I 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.670
 my little dad counted 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.050
 and now my children are starting to tell 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.310
 the jokes and I want to teach them to 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:38.740
 tell jokes or they learn this 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:41.080
 I do not know, did not sell me, lose me jokes 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:44.380
 to my twitter will be good apart from 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.610
 have a good time teaching jokes to 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.040
 our kids jokes about these 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:51.120
 whites that are very nice good to 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:54.960
 the age I take out size in the blender 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:58.470
 let's also put vinegar this is 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:01.730
 conservation will only saborcito 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:05.750
 let's put some milk 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:08.090
 with the cheese dimensions do not look like 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.259
 look for what is low in fat because it is 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.540
 really what they are looking for in a 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.280
 cheese that has less saturated fat 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.410
 because everything else is protein 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.360
 all that alone all that works but that 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:19.250
 be low in fat to lower levels of 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.500
 that also serves cholesterol is almost 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.650
 now for the people who are the act 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.930
 intolerant there are many people 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:30.440
 actress tolerant tolerate yes 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.640
 Goat's milk in the goat is the animal 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.170
 who has the milk most similar to the 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.270
 breast milk then there are times there 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.370
 people who can take it from this 

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:40.880
 success then also if you have visitors 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:43.520
 at home then choose goat cheese for 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:46.040
 or any cheese that has been made 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:49.250
 of goat's milk so that the 'latin 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:51.950
 tolerant do not tolerate well let's 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.430
 put a little garlic 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.430
 Y 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.730
 liquefy 

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:06.520
 ready and I want it simple is this 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:10.390
 it really is not funny 

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:15.010
 lala remember that milk consumption is 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:17.160
 important in children happens to me and I 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.810
 I'm going to talk so they know in little houses 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:24.490
 Many moms are already afraid of 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:26.680
 milk that happens has been spoken of pests is 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:28.990
 that always after food is the most not 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:32.310
 has given milk pestles then that 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:36.820
 if it is that if the animal has 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:39.490
 diseases that if it's wrongly done that 

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:41.670
 if it is rotten that if it is boiled that 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:44.650
 is facilitated blah blah blah blah 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.450
 many decide this way of aysén that then 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.480
 remove the milk my children at the end that 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:51.070
 I give soy milk nothing happens no no no 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.590
 Do it at home, do not do it 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:55.540
 in the house soy has many 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.090
 phytoestrogens and the only thing they 're going to 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.320
 provoke in your children is a puberty 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:02.650
 premature so premature that the eight 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:06.340
 years will be already covered that cause 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:09.340
 cause their premature growth in their 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:11.470
 premature development then please 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:14.470
 the milk simply can not suffer 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:16.389
 so from the hand of good put no longer leave 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.850
 of demanding juices from soy children 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:21.200
 the good school that right now we are 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:25.520
 of departure but what is it for? 

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:28.370
 and this that I wanted to tell you right now 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.590
 I'm making harmonious sticks 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:34.580
 with the cucumber that does not have the nugget 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:37.310
 center I'll leave until there then I'll 

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:39.710
 take a carrot and I'm also going to 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:41.270
 do the little sticks that little houses if you do not 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.930
 they want to make little sticks that we 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:48.580
 the garlic ahead can do 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:50.960
 little triangles all this is instead of 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:53.290
 exactly the chicharrón chips 

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.290
 like 

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:59.209
 the truth is the chips of pork rinds 

00:04:57.080 --> 00:05:00.849
 as to replace and start eating or 

00:04:59.209 --> 00:05:04.999
 look for a little healthier food 

00:05:00.849 --> 00:05:06.580
 This can also be with pork rind if 

00:05:04.999 --> 00:05:08.400
 they want 

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:10.530
 it will be 

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:13.710

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.850
 fill with a shower they also know 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:28.220
 rich can accompany it with tomatoes

 that has enough starch has 

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:25.090
 a lot of fiber has a lot of water 

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:27.100

 if currently with the jícama then there is 

00:06:47.569 --> 00:06:54.020
 to spend the jicama if he manages to purify 

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:55.669
 the liver and the kidneys then you can 

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:57.409
 eat jicama instead of doing these 

00:06:55.669 --> 00:07:00.169
