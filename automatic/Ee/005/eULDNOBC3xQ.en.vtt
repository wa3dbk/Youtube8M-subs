00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:53.159 
it was only one guy and then learn to

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:55.250 
it was only one guy and then learn to
play<00:00:53.339> them<00:00:53.489> both<00:00:53.699> and<00:00:53.909> then<00:00:54.269> only<00:00:54.600> later<00:00:54.719> find

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
play them both and then only later find

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.290 
play them both and then only later find
out<00:00:55.440> oh<00:00:55.620> you<00:00:55.979> can't<00:00:56.219> do<00:00:56.429> that<00:00:56.640> right<00:00:56.909> so<00:00:56.969> this

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
out oh you can't do that right so this

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.299 
out oh you can't do that right so this
is<00:00:57.359> kind<00:00:57.659> of<00:00:57.719> an<00:00:57.839> example<00:00:58.170> of<00:00:58.319> that<00:00:58.469> this<00:00:59.039> was<00:00:59.280> a

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
is kind of an example of that this was a

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.009 
is kind of an example of that this was a
style<00:00:59.969> of<00:01:00.120> rhythm<00:01:00.389> that<00:01:00.479> you<00:01:00.569> would<00:01:00.719> hear<00:01:00.989> on

00:01:01.009 --> 00:01:01.019 
style of rhythm that you would hear on

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:03.739 
style of rhythm that you would hear on
records<00:01:01.949> by<00:01:02.100> Jimmy<00:01:02.460> Reed<00:01:02.699> for<00:01:02.999> example<00:01:03.510> played

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:03.749 
records by Jimmy Reed for example played

00:01:03.749 --> 00:01:06.170 
records by Jimmy Reed for example played
by<00:01:03.929> two<00:01:03.989> or<00:01:04.409> even<00:01:04.439> three<00:01:04.680> guitar<00:01:05.189> players<00:01:05.460> now

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
by two or even three guitar players now

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.510 
by two or even three guitar players now
the<00:01:06.240> trick<00:01:06.570> is<00:01:06.680> that<00:01:07.680> you're<00:01:08.159> gonna<00:01:08.280> play<00:01:08.490> a

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
the trick is that you're gonna play a

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.310 
the trick is that you're gonna play a
bass<00:01:08.820> line<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.450> then<00:01:09.840> you're<00:01:09.990> gonna<00:01:10.079> play

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
bass line and then you're gonna play

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.499 
bass line and then you're gonna play
chord<00:01:10.649> accents<00:01:11.219> in<00:01:11.340> between<00:01:11.820> the<00:01:12.000> bass<00:01:12.180> notes

00:01:12.499 --> 00:01:12.509 
chord accents in between the bass notes

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:14.359 
chord accents in between the bass notes

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:48.430 
player does that it's even better so

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:55.929 
player does that it's even better so
just<00:01:49.430> moving<00:01:49.909> your<00:01:50.030> finger<00:01:54.580> that's<00:01:55.580> pretty

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:55.939 
just moving your finger that's pretty

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:58.569 
just moving your finger that's pretty
easy<00:01:56.000> to<00:01:56.240> learn<00:01:56.360> here's<00:01:57.320> the<00:01:57.500> trick<00:01:57.740> I'm<00:01:58.310> gonna

00:01:58.569 --> 00:01:58.579 
easy to learn here's the trick I'm gonna

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:01.149 
easy to learn here's the trick I'm gonna
play<00:01:58.820> it<00:01:59.000> using<00:01:59.329> a<00:01:59.600> slap<00:01:59.990> in<00:02:00.380> my<00:02:00.530> right<00:02:00.920> hand

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:01.159 
play it using a slap in my right hand

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:02.380 
play it using a slap in my right hand
I'm<00:02:01.280> gonna<00:02:01.369> write<00:02:01.520> hit<00:02:01.670> more<00:02:01.880> strings<00:02:02.240> than

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
I'm gonna write hit more strings than

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.080 
I'm gonna write hit more strings than
just<00:02:02.720> the<00:02:02.869> one<00:02:03.110> and<00:02:03.460> in<00:02:04.460> order<00:02:04.700> to<00:02:04.759> keep<00:02:04.909> it

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090 
just the one and in order to keep it

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.020 
just the one and in order to keep it
from<00:02:05.240> getting<00:02:05.420> too<00:02:05.979> kind<00:02:06.979> of<00:02:07.100> wacky<00:02:07.399> sounding

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030 
from getting too kind of wacky sounding

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.639 
from getting too kind of wacky sounding
I'm<00:02:08.149> gonna<00:02:08.299> mute<00:02:08.569> everything<00:02:09.140> in<00:02:09.289> my<00:02:09.410> left

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
I'm gonna mute everything in my left

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.009 
I'm gonna mute everything in my left
hand<00:02:09.979> so<00:02:10.519> I<00:02:10.549> just<00:02:10.910> hear<00:02:11.060> one<00:02:11.269> note<00:02:11.299> now<00:02:11.959> it

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:12.019 
hand so I just hear one note now it

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:19.390 
hand so I just hear one note now it
starts<00:02:12.350> like<00:02:12.500> this<00:02:12.530> I<00:02:12.860> play<00:02:13.040> the<00:02:17.290> G<00:02:18.290> sharp<00:02:18.650> and

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
starts like this I play the G sharp and

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.190 
starts like this I play the G sharp and
when<00:02:19.549> I<00:02:19.580> do<00:02:19.700> that<00:02:20.019> fingering<00:02:21.019> the<00:02:21.110> G<00:02:21.290> sharp

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
when I do that fingering the G sharp

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:45.789 
when I do that fingering the G sharp
muting<00:02:24.200> the<00:02:24.230> rest<00:02:24.470> of<00:02:24.590> the<00:02:26.349> strings

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:45.799 

00:02:45.799 --> 00:02:49.429 

muting<00:02:46.799> everything<00:02:48.110> put<00:02:49.110> them<00:02:49.200> all<00:02:49.319> together

00:02:49.429 --> 00:02:49.439 
muting everything put them all together

00:02:49.439 --> 00:03:02.960 
muting everything put them all together
and<00:02:49.799> I<00:02:49.890> get<00:02:50.069> this

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.480 

you<00:03:03.390> can<00:03:03.540> see<00:03:03.780> that<00:03:04.319> my<00:03:04.980> hands<00:03:05.250> are<00:03:05.459> very

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:05.490 
you can see that my hands are very

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:07.520 
you can see that my hands are very
relaxed<00:03:06.270> because<00:03:06.510> I<00:03:06.600> practiced<00:03:06.810> this<00:03:07.230> a<00:03:07.260> lot

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:07.530 
relaxed because I practiced this a lot

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.190 
relaxed because I practiced this a lot
my<00:03:07.980> right<00:03:08.220> hand<00:03:08.459> is<00:03:08.580> a<00:03:08.910> big<00:03:09.209> stroke<00:03:09.540> has<00:03:09.900> a<00:03:09.930> lot

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
my right hand is a big stroke has a lot

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.740 
my right hand is a big stroke has a lot
of<00:03:10.230> energy<00:03:10.650> to<00:03:10.860> it<00:03:11.150> the<00:03:12.150> next<00:03:12.420> part<00:03:12.600> of<00:03:12.660> the

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
of energy to it the next part of the

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.840 
of energy to it the next part of the
equation<00:03:13.260> is<00:03:13.440> to<00:03:13.680> combine<00:03:13.860> the<00:03:14.040> muted<00:03:14.610> bass

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
equation is to combine the muted bass

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.770 
equation is to combine the muted bass
line<00:03:15.209> with<00:03:16.069> up<00:03:17.069> strokes<00:03:17.550> on<00:03:17.819> the<00:03:18.060> open<00:03:18.480> strings

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
line with up strokes on the open strings

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.449 
line with up strokes on the open strings
being<00:03:19.020> in<00:03:19.230> the<00:03:19.350> key<00:03:19.530> of<00:03:19.620> E<00:03:19.709> I<00:03:19.739> can<00:03:20.010> use<00:03:20.130> open

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
being in the key of E I can use open

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:21.860 
being in the key of E I can use open
strings<00:03:20.730> and<00:03:20.850> not<00:03:21.000> worry<00:03:21.270> about<00:03:21.360> it

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
strings and not worry about it

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.809 
strings and not worry about it
so<00:03:22.260> when<00:03:22.440> I<00:03:22.470> put<00:03:22.739> the<00:03:22.830> two<00:03:22.980> together<00:03:23.130> and<00:03:23.670> I'll

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:23.819 
so when I put the two together and I'll

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:25.550 
so when I put the two together and I'll
play<00:03:24.060> real<00:03:24.330> slowly<00:03:24.630> it<00:03:24.870> should<00:03:25.140> sound<00:03:25.319> like

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
play real slowly it should sound like

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:44.510 
play real slowly it should sound like
this

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:44.520 

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:47.720 

that<00:03:45.450> sounds<00:03:45.990> kind<00:03:46.230> of<00:03:46.350> kind<00:03:47.070> of<00:03:47.160> strange<00:03:47.460> at

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
that sounds kind of kind of strange at

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.420 
that sounds kind of kind of strange at
that<00:03:47.910> tempo<00:03:48.390> but<00:03:48.960> played<00:03:49.320> up<00:03:49.530> to<00:03:49.680> the<00:03:49.800> normal

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
that tempo but played up to the normal

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.460 
that tempo but played up to the normal
tempo<00:03:50.820> it's<00:03:50.940> it's<00:03:51.210> it's<00:03:51.720> pretty<00:03:51.870> cool<00:03:51.990> sounds

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
tempo it's it's it's pretty cool sounds

00:03:52.470 --> 00:04:04.290 
tempo it's it's it's pretty cool sounds
like<00:03:52.560> this<00:03:52.740> three

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:04.300 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.990 

now<00:04:05.140> you<00:04:05.200> create<00:04:05.890> the<00:04:06.100> illusion<00:04:06.190> of<00:04:06.610> a<00:04:06.730> guitar

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:07.000 
now you create the illusion of a guitar

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.030 
now you create the illusion of a guitar
playing<00:04:07.300> the<00:04:07.450> downbeats<00:04:07.960> and<00:04:08.260> another<00:04:08.650> guitar

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
playing the downbeats and another guitar

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.600 
playing the downbeats and another guitar
playing<00:04:10.410> the<00:04:11.410> shuffle<00:04:11.770> part<00:04:11.980> on<00:04:12.100> the<00:04:12.220> upbeats

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:12.610 
playing the shuffle part on the upbeats

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:15.030 
playing the shuffle part on the upbeats
but<00:04:13.060> they're<00:04:13.240> put<00:04:13.450> together<00:04:13.600> it<00:04:14.380> tricky<00:04:14.890> and

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
but they're put together it tricky and

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.229 
but they're put together it tricky and
it<00:04:15.100> takes<00:04:15.310> a<00:04:15.370> little<00:04:15.520> time<00:04:15.610> to<00:04:15.760> get<00:04:15.940> the<00:04:16.060> two

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239 
it takes a little time to get the two

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:18.180 
it takes a little time to get the two
hands<00:04:16.480> coordinated<00:04:17.230> but<00:04:17.530> once<00:04:17.739> you<00:04:17.860> do<00:04:18.010> it

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
hands coordinated but once you do it

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.250 
hands coordinated but once you do it
becomes<00:04:18.550> a<00:04:18.640> very<00:04:18.760> natural<00:04:19.060> part<00:04:19.540> now<00:04:19.750> you<00:04:20.080> want

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:20.260 
becomes a very natural part now you want

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.900 
becomes a very natural part now you want
to<00:04:20.320> translate<00:04:20.770> the<00:04:20.920> same<00:04:21.100> idea<00:04:21.489> over<00:04:21.640> to<00:04:21.820> the<00:04:21.880> a

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:21.910 
to translate the same idea over to the a

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:34.999 
to translate the same idea over to the a
chord

00:04:34.999 --> 00:04:35.009 

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:38.370 

beat<00:04:36.009> court<00:04:36.370> you<00:04:36.940> can<00:04:37.120> play<00:04:37.300> children<00:04:37.930> based

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:38.380 
beat court you can play children based

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:40.920

nine<00:04:41.259> chord<00:04:41.590> it<00:04:41.680> sounds<00:04:41.710> even<00:04:42.190> better<00:04:42.280> and

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:42.669 
nine chord it sounds even better and

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:46.850 
nine chord it sounds even better and

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 
tempo this is figure one and it goes a

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:15.390 
tempo this is figure one and it goes a
little<00:05:14.290> something<00:05:14.440> like<00:05:14.740> this

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:15.400 
little something like this

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:54.600 
little something like this
what<00:05:18.270> 202

00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:54.610 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:57.670 

now<00:05:55.610> you<00:05:55.669> notice<00:05:56.000> the<00:05:56.150> baseline<00:05:56.650> changes<00:05:57.650> a

00:05:57.670 --> 00:05:57.680 
now you notice the baseline changes a

00:05:57.680 --> 00:05:59.500 
now you notice the baseline changes a
little<00:05:57.979> bit<00:05:58.130> more<00:05:58.460> like<00:05:58.639> a<00:05:58.669> walking<00:05:59.180> line<00:05:59.330> of

00:05:59.500 --> 00:05:59.510 
little bit more like a walking line of

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:01.510 
little bit more like a walking line of
the<00:05:59.570> bass<00:05:59.780> player<00:06:00.020> would<00:06:00.169> play<00:06:00.229> and<00:06:01.220> at<00:06:01.430> the

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:01.520 
the bass player would play and at the

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.280 
the bass player would play and at the
end<00:06:01.669> I<00:06:01.790> think<00:06:01.850> I<00:06:02.090> played<00:06:02.660> a<00:06:02.780> little<00:06:03.169> bit

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:03.290 
end I think I played a little bit

00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:04.540 
end I think I played a little bit

get<00:06:07.220> the<00:06:07.340> ideas<00:06:07.699> mainly<00:06:08.180> about<00:06:08.449> the<00:06:08.510> feel<00:06:09.020> and

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:09.470 
get the ideas mainly about the feel and

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:11.230
