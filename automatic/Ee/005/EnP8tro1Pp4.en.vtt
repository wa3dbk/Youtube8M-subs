00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:25.700 
later I also highly recommend that you

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:29.590 
later I also highly recommend that you
download<00:02:26.510> and<00:02:27.020> print<00:02:27.260> out<00:02:27.470> the<00:02:27.680> PDF<00:02:28.420> just<00:02:29.420> so

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:29.600 
download and print out the PDF just so

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.090 
download and print out the PDF just so
that<00:02:29.720> you<00:02:29.810> could<00:02:29.960> have<00:02:30.050> photo<00:02:30.320> references<00:02:30.950> by

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
that you could have photo references by

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.730 
that you could have photo references by
your<00:02:31.280> side<00:02:31.520> when<00:02:31.730> you<00:02:31.850> draw<00:02:32.350> okay<00:02:33.350> so<00:02:33.410> I'm

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:33.740 
your side when you draw okay so I'm

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:35.980 
your side when you draw okay so I'm
starting<00:02:34.100> out<00:02:34.220> with<00:02:34.280> erasing<00:02:35.150> some<00:02:35.780> of<00:02:35.810> the

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:35.990 
starting out with erasing some of the

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.050 
starting out with erasing some of the
lines<00:02:36.200> that<00:02:36.440> we<00:02:36.560> put<00:02:36.770> in<00:02:36.920> as<00:02:37.070> you<00:02:37.430> can<00:02:37.610> see<00:02:37.880> I

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
lines that we put in as you can see I

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:39.880 
lines that we put in as you can see I
didn't<00:02:38.480> totally<00:02:38.780> erase<00:02:39.230> them<00:02:39.470> but<00:02:39.500> I<00:02:39.620> erased

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
didn't totally erase them but I erased

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.170 
didn't totally erase them but I erased
them<00:02:40.070> maybe<00:02:40.450> 75%<00:02:41.530> the<00:02:42.530> head<00:02:42.770> is<00:02:43.010> a<00:02:43.370> rounded

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.180 
them maybe 75% the head is a rounded

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.600 
them maybe 75% the head is a rounded
object<00:02:44.630> and<00:02:44.870> you<00:02:45.410> don't<00:02:45.620> really<00:02:45.800> have<00:02:45.920> hard

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
object and you don't really have hard

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.960 
object and you don't really have hard
lines<00:02:46.910> on<00:02:47.240> it<00:02:47.300> so<00:02:47.930> it's<00:02:48.800> it's<00:02:49.010> more<00:02:49.310> of<00:02:49.400> a<00:02:49.520> blend

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:49.970 
lines on it so it's it's more of a blend

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.390 
lines on it so it's it's more of a blend
it's<00:02:50.210> more<00:02:50.420> of<00:02:50.510> a<00:02:50.600> smudge<00:02:50.900> and<00:02:51.200> we're<00:02:52.070> gonna<00:02:52.160> go

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
it's more of a smudge and we're gonna go

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.580 
it's more of a smudge and we're gonna go
into<00:02:52.640> that<00:02:52.760> a<00:02:52.820> little<00:02:52.970> bit<00:02:53.120> later<00:02:53.420> I<00:02:53.690> always

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
into that a little bit later I always

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:56.710 
into that a little bit later I always
start<00:02:54.830> out<00:02:54.920> with<00:02:54.980> the<00:02:55.190> darkest<00:02:55.610> parts<00:02:55.940> in<00:02:56.510> this

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
start out with the darkest parts in this

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.750 
start out with the darkest parts in this
picture<00:02:57.140> it's<00:02:57.560> the<00:02:57.920> eyelashes<00:02:58.820> and<00:02:59.060> the<00:02:59.570> pupil

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
picture it's the eyelashes and the pupil

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.360 
picture it's the eyelashes and the pupil
the<00:03:01.760> pupil<00:03:02.150> is<00:03:02.270> universal<00:03:03.080> you<00:03:03.890> know<00:03:04.010> did<00:03:04.250> in

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
the pupil is universal you know did in

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.390 
the pupil is universal you know did in
terms<00:03:04.490> of<00:03:04.730> its<00:03:05.180> darkness<00:03:05.750> but<00:03:06.410> the<00:03:07.130> photo

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:07.400 
terms of its darkness but the photo

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.670 
terms of its darkness but the photo
reference<00:03:07.640> that<00:03:08.060> I<00:03:08.090> used<00:03:08.360> for<00:03:08.660> this<00:03:08.810> the<00:03:09.470> girl

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
reference that I used for this the girl

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.940 
reference that I used for this the girl
was<00:03:09.920> wearing<00:03:10.450> eyeliner<00:03:11.450> and<00:03:11.780> it<00:03:12.440> really<00:03:12.650> made

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
was wearing eyeliner and it really made

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.700 
was wearing eyeliner and it really made
the<00:03:13.310> lashes<00:03:13.760> dark<00:03:14.090> so<00:03:14.810> I'm<00:03:15.020> staying<00:03:15.320> true<00:03:15.620> to

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:15.710 
the lashes dark so I'm staying true to

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:18.820 
the lashes dark so I'm staying true to
that<00:03:16.360> makeup<00:03:17.360> can<00:03:17.750> definitely<00:03:18.320> throw<00:03:18.500> things

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:18.830 
that makeup can definitely throw things

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.220 
that makeup can definitely throw things
off<00:03:19.070> because<00:03:19.670> it<00:03:20.030> you<00:03:20.510> know<00:03:20.600> it<00:03:20.750> could<00:03:21.020> put

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
off because it you know it could put

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.290 
off because it you know it could put
things<00:03:21.380> in<00:03:21.620> shadows<00:03:22.010> it<00:03:22.220> could<00:03:22.340> put<00:03:22.940> things<00:03:23.150> in

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:23.300 
things in shadows it could put things in

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.050 
things in shadows it could put things in
highlights<00:03:23.690> it's<00:03:23.930> it's<00:03:24.230> an<00:03:24.350> artificial

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
highlights it's it's an artificial

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.360 
highlights it's it's an artificial
source<00:03:26.060> that<00:03:26.450> can<00:03:26.630> definitely<00:03:27.410> throw<00:03:28.010> off<00:03:28.220> an

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:28.370 
source that can definitely throw off an

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:30.880 
source that can definitely throw off an
artist<00:03:28.700> but<00:03:29.540> if<00:03:30.020> you<00:03:30.200> always<00:03:30.470> look<00:03:30.680> at<00:03:30.800> your

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
artist but if you always look at your

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.090 
artist but if you always look at your
reference<00:03:31.100> picture<00:03:31.730> or<00:03:32.560> ideally<00:03:33.560> the<00:03:33.740> person

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:34.100 
reference picture or ideally the person

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
that you're drawing that's even better

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.070 
that you're drawing that's even better
that<00:03:36.590> should<00:03:36.800> definitely<00:03:36.920> help<00:03:37.340> you<00:03:38.080> I'm

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:39.080 
that should definitely help you I'm

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.740 
that should definitely help you I'm
putting<00:03:39.440> in<00:03:39.590> the<00:03:39.800> eyebrows<00:03:40.580> that<00:03:41.510> could

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
putting in the eyebrows that could

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.200 
putting in the eyebrows that could
definitely<00:03:41.990> be<00:03:42.530> as<00:03:42.740> dark<00:03:43.130> as<00:03:43.310> the<00:03:43.670> eyelashes

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:44.210 
definitely be as dark as the eyelashes

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:46.600 
definitely be as dark as the eyelashes
it<00:03:44.330> almost<00:03:44.600> always<00:03:44.900> is<00:03:45.080> but<00:03:45.620> again<00:03:46.220> with<00:03:46.430> that

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610 
it almost always is but again with that

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:51.340 
it almost always is but again with that
exception<00:03:47.300> of<00:03:47.540> makeup<00:03:49.570> I'm<00:03:50.570> hatching<00:03:50.900> in<00:03:51.230> the

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:51.350 
exception of makeup I'm hatching in the

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:53.110 
exception of makeup I'm hatching in the
shadow<00:03:51.620> underneath<00:03:52.010> the<00:03:52.310> eye<00:03:52.340> notice<00:03:52.910> I'm

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
shadow underneath the eye notice I'm

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.740 
shadow underneath the eye notice I'm
doing<00:03:53.150> that<00:03:53.600> lighter<00:03:53.950> then<00:03:54.950> the<00:03:55.750> eyelashes

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
doing that lighter then the eyelashes

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.860 
doing that lighter then the eyelashes
and<00:03:56.990> the<00:03:57.530> pupil<00:03:57.920> and<00:03:58.210> you're<00:03:59.210> gonna<00:03:59.330> see<00:03:59.600> me<00:03:59.750> go

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
and the pupil and you're gonna see me go

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:01.600 
and the pupil and you're gonna see me go
over<00:04:00.020> that<00:04:00.260> with<00:04:00.740> the<00:04:00.860> blending<00:04:01.250> stump<00:04:01.520> a

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:01.610 
over that with the blending stump a

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:03.550 
over that with the blending stump a
little<00:04:01.850> bit<00:04:01.970> later<00:04:02.180> I'm<00:04:02.600> doing<00:04:03.050> some<00:04:03.260> very

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
little bit later I'm doing some very

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.780 
little bit later I'm doing some very
very<00:04:03.950> light<00:04:04.250> hatches<00:04:05.150> above<00:04:05.570> the<00:04:05.750> eye<00:04:06.580> the<00:04:07.580> two

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:07.790 
very light hatches above the eye the two

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:09.630 
very light hatches above the eye the two
parts<00:04:08.150> that<00:04:08.360> are<00:04:08.480> going<00:04:08.630> to<00:04:08.810> be<00:04:08.930> the<00:04:09.080> lightest

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:09.640 
parts that are going to be the lightest

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.360 
parts that are going to be the lightest
into<00:04:10.640> in<00:04:10.850> terms<00:04:11.240> of<00:04:11.480> tone<00:04:11.720> are<00:04:12.080> the<00:04:12.890> highlight

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
into in terms of tone are the highlight

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.450 
into in terms of tone are the highlight
in<00:04:13.610> the<00:04:13.730> eye<00:04:13.760> and<00:04:14.380> the<00:04:15.380> highlight<00:04:16.190> right

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:16.460 
in the eye and the highlight right

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:19.810 
in the eye and the highlight right
underneath<00:04:16.820> the<00:04:17.270> eyebrow<00:04:17.720> and<00:04:18.730> you're<00:04:19.730> gonna

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
underneath the eyebrow and you're gonna

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.310 
underneath the eyebrow and you're gonna
see<00:04:20.090> that<00:04:20.270> a<00:04:20.299> little<00:04:20.540> bit<00:04:20.690> later<00:04:20.930> a<00:04:21.020> better

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320 
see that a little bit later a better

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:24.610 
see that a little bit later a better
later<00:04:22.010> after<00:04:22.790> I<00:04:22.820> do<00:04:22.940> the<00:04:23.180> smudging<00:04:23.630> the<00:04:24.410> white

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
later after I do the smudging the white

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.290 
later after I do the smudging the white
of<00:04:24.770> the<00:04:24.800> eye<00:04:24.919> is<00:04:25.370> actually<00:04:25.640> going<00:04:26.060> to

00:04:26.290 --> 00:04:26.300 
of the eye is actually going to

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.719 
of the eye is actually going to
darkened<00:04:26.780> in<00:04:27.289> a<00:04:27.650> moment<00:04:28.039> I'm<00:04:28.159> gonna<00:04:28.280> do<00:04:28.520> some

00:04:28.719 --> 00:04:28.729 
darkened in a moment I'm gonna do some

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:30.939 
darkened in a moment I'm gonna do some
hatching<00:04:29.150> and<00:04:29.500> then<00:04:30.500> I'm<00:04:30.590> gonna<00:04:30.710> do<00:04:30.919> some

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:30.949 
hatching and then I'm gonna do some

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:33.749 
hatching and then I'm gonna do some
smudging<00:04:31.580> here<00:04:32.360> we<00:04:32.479> go<00:04:32.629> there's<00:04:32.870> the<00:04:33.020> hatching

00:04:33.749 --> 00:04:33.759 
smudging here we go there's the hatching

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:42.460 
smudging here we go there's the hatching
I'm<00:04:34.759> gonna<00:04:35.090> smudge<00:04:35.389> in<00:04:35.569> a<00:04:35.629> little<00:04:35.870> bit<00:04:41.289> now<00:04:42.289> I'm

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:42.470 
I'm gonna smudge in a little bit now I'm

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:46.869 
I'm gonna smudge in a little bit now I'm
going<00:04:42.770> to<00:04:43.009> the<00:04:43.310> 3b<00:04:44.090> pencil<00:04:45.669> which<00:04:46.669> of<00:04:46.849> course

00:04:46.869 --> 00:04:46.879 
going to the 3b pencil which of course

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:49.960 
going to the 3b pencil which of course
is<00:04:47.270> darker<00:04:47.690> than<00:04:48.379> the<00:04:48.949> number-two<00:04:49.520> pencil

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:49.970 
is darker than the number-two pencil

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:54.790 
is darker than the number-two pencil
that<00:04:50.659> I'm<00:04:50.810> using<00:04:51.050> and<00:04:52.870> now<00:04:53.870> I'm<00:04:54.110> really<00:04:54.440> really

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 
that I'm using and now I'm really really

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.469 
that I'm using and now I'm really really
building<00:04:55.250> in<00:04:55.370> the<00:04:55.490> tones<00:04:55.699> and<00:04:56.030> I'm<00:04:56.300> making

00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:56.479 
building in the tones and I'm making

00:04:56.479 --> 00:04:58.600 
building in the tones and I'm making
sure<00:04:56.659> that<00:04:56.810> the<00:04:57.110> tip<00:04:57.289> is<00:04:57.500> really<00:04:57.740> sharp<00:04:58.190> so<00:04:58.460> I

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:58.610 
sure that the tip is really sharp so I

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:02.950 
sure that the tip is really sharp so I
could<00:04:58.819> be<00:04:58.940> very<00:04:59.120> precise<00:05:01.539> really<00:05:02.539> making<00:05:02.840> the

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:02.960 
could be very precise really making the

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:08.800 
could be very precise really making the
lashes<00:05:03.379> pointy<00:05:05.379> and<00:05:07.180> this<00:05:08.180> is<00:05:08.330> where<00:05:08.509> some<00:05:08.539> of

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:08.810 
lashes pointy and this is where some of

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:11.490 
lashes pointy and this is where some of
the<00:05:08.900> magic<00:05:09.259> happens

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:11.500 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.990 

because<00:05:12.500> you<00:05:12.650> could<00:05:12.830> press<00:05:13.129> as<00:05:13.340> hard<00:05:13.639> as<00:05:13.879> you

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 
because you could press as hard as you

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.320 
because you could press as hard as you
can<00:05:14.210> with<00:05:14.719> a<00:05:15.159> HB<00:05:16.159> pencil<00:05:16.340> or<00:05:16.759> number-two

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:17.330 
can with a HB pencil or number-two

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.719 
can with a HB pencil or number-two
pencil<00:05:17.750> and<00:05:18.110> you<00:05:18.889> know<00:05:18.979> it's<00:05:19.129> not<00:05:19.310> gonna<00:05:19.490> get

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:19.729 
pencil and you know it's not gonna get

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:23.379 
pencil and you know it's not gonna get
nearly<00:05:20.180> as<00:05:20.419> dark<00:05:20.719> as<00:05:20.900> when<00:05:21.379> you're<00:05:21.530> using<00:05:21.740> a<00:05:22.699> 3b

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:23.389 
nearly as dark as when you're using a 3b

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:27.760 
nearly as dark as when you're using a 3b
pencil<00:05:23.870> at<00:05:24.229> a<00:05:24.770> 6b<00:05:25.639> pencil<00:05:25.900> it<00:05:26.900> even<00:05:27.379> goes<00:05:27.530> all

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:27.770 
pencil at a 6b pencil it even goes all

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:29.770 
pencil at a 6b pencil it even goes all
the<00:05:27.800> way<00:05:27.889> up<00:05:28.099> to<00:05:28.219> 10<00:05:28.460> B<00:05:28.639> pencil<00:05:29.090> and<00:05:29.240> then

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:29.780 
the way up to 10 B pencil and then

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:32.260 
the way up to 10 B pencil and then
there's<00:05:29.960> ebony<00:05:30.319> pencil<00:05:30.469> and<00:05:30.979> for<00:05:31.729> the<00:05:31.849> darkest

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:32.270 
there's ebony pencil and for the darkest

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:34.480 
there's ebony pencil and for the darkest
darks<00:05:32.539> I<00:05:32.659> could<00:05:32.840> use<00:05:33.020> a<00:05:33.349> prismacolor<00:05:34.009> black

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:34.490 
darks I could use a prismacolor black

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:37.290 
darks I could use a prismacolor black
pencil<00:05:35.000> I<00:05:35.210> like<00:05:35.630> doing<00:05:35.960> that

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:37.300 
pencil I like doing that

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:47.480 
pencil I like doing that
alright<00:05:38.300> so<00:05:38.479> now<00:05:38.659> I'm<00:05:38.810> doing<00:05:39.110> some<00:05:39.319> smudging

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:47.490 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:51.200 

and<00:05:47.700> my<00:05:48.600> process<00:05:49.140> I<00:05:49.290> usually<00:05:49.860> smudge<00:05:50.220> over

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:51.210 
and my process I usually smudge over

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:53.930 
and my process I usually smudge over
some<00:05:51.420> of<00:05:51.540> my<00:05:51.570> hatches<00:05:52.320> and<00:05:52.530> then<00:05:52.770> I<00:05:52.890> hatch<00:05:53.130> over

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:53.940 
some of my hatches and then I hatch over

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:56.060 
some of my hatches and then I hatch over
the<00:05:54.090> smudge<00:05:54.390> and<00:05:54.690> I<00:05:55.290> could<00:05:55.470> do<00:05:55.560> that<00:05:55.710> as<00:05:55.860> many

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:56.070 
the smudge and I could do that as many

00:05:56.070 --> 00:06:02.750 
the smudge and I could do that as many
times<00:05:56.340> as<00:05:56.490> I<00:05:56.640> want<00:06:01.340> that's<00:06:02.340> a<00:06:02.430> good<00:06:02.610> way<00:06:02.730> to

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:02.760 
times as I want that's a good way to

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:07.850 
times as I want that's a good way to
build<00:06:03.090> up<00:06:03.210> tones<00:06:04.700> that's<00:06:05.700> a<00:06:05.910> 5<00:06:06.180> B<00:06:06.420> pencil<00:06:06.900> same

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:07.860 
build up tones that's a 5 B pencil same

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:10.580 
build up tones that's a 5 B pencil same
thing<00:06:08.070> that<00:06:08.250> I<00:06:08.310> did<00:06:08.880> with<00:06:09.090> the<00:06:09.240> 3b<00:06:09.960> pencil<00:06:10.410> but

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:10.590 
thing that I did with the 3b pencil but

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:13.280 
thing that I did with the 3b pencil but
you<00:06:10.800> know<00:06:11.180> this<00:06:12.180> way<00:06:12.360> I<00:06:12.390> don't<00:06:12.750> really<00:06:12.990> have<00:06:13.170> to

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:13.290 
you know this way I don't really have to

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:15.320 
you know this way I don't really have to
press<00:06:13.530> too<00:06:13.920> hard<00:06:13.950> on<00:06:14.280> the<00:06:14.400> paper<00:06:14.610> and<00:06:14.910> damage

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:15.330 
press too hard on the paper and damage

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:19.100 
press too hard on the paper and damage
the<00:06:15.510> paper<00:06:16.100> to<00:06:17.100> get<00:06:17.250> those<00:06:17.460> dark<00:06:17.760> tones<00:06:18.030> and<00:06:18.360> as

00:06:19.100 --> 00:06:19.110 
the paper to get those dark tones and as

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:21.110 
the paper to get those dark tones and as
I<00:06:19.290> said<00:06:19.620> you<00:06:19.830> know<00:06:19.920> it's<00:06:20.250> like<00:06:20.430> a<00:06:20.460> futile

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:21.120 
I said you know it's like a futile

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:24.140 
I said you know it's like a futile
effort<00:06:21.450> to<00:06:21.990> do<00:06:22.140> that<00:06:22.170> with<00:06:22.560> a<00:06:22.730> HB<00:06:23.730> pencil

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:24.150 
effort to do that with a HB pencil

00:06:24.150 --> 00:06:26.110 
effort to do that with a HB pencil
because<00:06:24.510> you<00:06:24.690> will<00:06:24.810> never<00:06:25.080> get<00:06:25.350> as<00:06:25.470> dark<00:06:25.740> as

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:26.120 
because you will never get as dark as

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:38.980 
because you will never get as dark as
you<00:06:27.120> do<00:06:27.300> with<00:06:28.020> some<00:06:28.260> of<00:06:28.380> the<00:06:28.530> higher<00:06:29.460> B<00:06:29.850> pencils

00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:38.990
