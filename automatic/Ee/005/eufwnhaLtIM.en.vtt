00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
let's see what I think so after the

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.870 
let's see what I think so after the
first<00:01:13.320> game<00:01:13.799> after<00:01:14.040> this<00:01:14.280> game<00:01:14.460> I<00:01:14.580> was<00:01:14.700> like

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
first game after this game I was like

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.660 
first game after this game I was like
well<00:01:15.390> yeah<00:01:15.780> I'm<00:01:16.259> feeling<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:16.920> I'm<00:01:17.100> feeling<00:01:17.549> it

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
well yeah I'm feeling it I'm feeling it

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.200 
well yeah I'm feeling it I'm feeling it
but<00:01:17.700> then<00:01:18.150> later<00:01:18.420> on<00:01:19.189> all<00:01:20.189> the<00:01:20.640> demons<00:01:21.000> came

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
but then later on all the demons came

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.749 
but then later on all the demons came
out<00:01:21.390> all<00:01:22.080> the<00:01:22.350> demons<00:01:22.680> and<00:01:22.890> I<00:01:23.070> think<00:01:23.400> that<00:01:23.610> in

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759
