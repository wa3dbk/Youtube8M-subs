we're<00:00:33.910> ready<00:00:34.059> for<00:00:34.300> some<00:00:34.480> adventure

00:00:35.189 --> 00:00:35.199 
we're ready for some adventure

00:00:35.199 --> 00:01:11.910 
we're ready for some adventure
let's<00:00:35.530> go<00:00:35.710> hiking

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:11.920 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:14.289 

I've<00:01:12.920> really<00:01:13.219> been<00:01:13.369> enjoying<00:01:13.520> the<00:01:13.880> view<00:01:14.060> so

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:14.299 
I've really been enjoying the view so

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:16.989 
I've really been enjoying the view so
far<00:01:14.569> I<00:01:14.780> would<00:01:15.350> classify<00:01:15.530> this<00:01:15.920> as<00:01:16.130> a<00:01:16.310> lower

00:01:16.989 --> 00:01:16.999 
far I would classify this as a lower

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:19.029 
far I would classify this as a lower
intermediate<00:01:17.450> hike<00:01:17.960> it's<00:01:18.259> not<00:01:18.710> for<00:01:18.890> people

00:01:19.029 --> 00:01:19.039 
intermediate hike it's not for people

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:20.529 
intermediate hike it's not for people
who<00:01:19.310> really<00:01:19.640> have<00:01:19.969> a<00:01:20.000> fear<00:01:20.390> of<00:01:20.420> heights

00:01:20.529 --> 00:01:20.539 
who really have a fear of heights

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:22.870 
who really have a fear of heights
there's<00:01:21.170> some<00:01:21.380> vertical<00:01:22.250> parts<00:01:22.549> where<00:01:22.850> you

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:22.880 
there's some vertical parts where you

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:24.910 
there's some vertical parts where you
have<00:01:23.179> to<00:01:23.329> go<00:01:23.450> up<00:01:23.569> ladders<00:01:23.990> and<00:01:24.229> down<00:01:24.709> ladders

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:24.920 
have to go up ladders and down ladders

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.980 
have to go up ladders and down ladders
and<00:01:25.340> that<00:01:26.090> part<00:01:26.329> would<00:01:26.569> be<00:01:26.600> a<00:01:26.689> deal<00:01:26.899> breaker

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
and that part would be a deal breaker

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.589 
and that part would be a deal breaker
for<00:01:27.259> some<00:01:27.560> people<00:01:27.859> but<00:01:28.369> as<00:01:28.640> far<00:01:28.969> as<00:01:29.000> the<00:01:29.240> views

00:01:29.589 --> 00:01:29.599 
for some people but as far as the views

00:01:29.599 --> 00:01:31.929 
for some people but as far as the views
and<00:01:30.020> just<00:01:30.049> the<00:01:30.649> actual<00:01:30.950> hike<00:01:31.250> itself<00:01:31.579> it's

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:31.939 
and just the actual hike itself it's

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:43.600 
and just the actual hike itself it's
it's<00:01:32.420> really<00:01:32.869> enjoyable

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.130 

so<00:01:44.610> this<00:01:44.760> is<00:01:44.940> actually<00:01:45.360> one<00:01:45.570> of<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.780> ladders

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
so this is actually one of the ladders

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.840 
so this is actually one of the ladders
that<00:01:46.170> you<00:01:46.409> have<00:01:46.560> to<00:01:46.740> climb<00:01:46.950> down<00:01:47.250> on<00:01:47.580> the<00:01:47.700> way

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
that you have to climb down on the way

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.480 
that you have to climb down on the way
back<00:01:48.119> and<00:01:48.390> I<00:01:48.840> believe<00:01:49.200> there<00:01:49.530> are<00:01:49.560> two<00:01:49.740> sets<00:01:50.340> of

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
back and I believe there are two sets of

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.340 
back and I believe there are two sets of
ladders<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:51.030> deal<00:01:51.210> with<00:01:51.479> so<00:01:51.720> something<00:01:52.229> to

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
ladders to deal with so something to

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.170 
ladders to deal with so something to
consider<00:01:52.710> if<00:01:53.040> you<00:01:53.070> are<00:01:53.250> afraid<00:01:53.790> of<00:01:53.909> heights

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
consider if you are afraid of heights

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.690 
consider if you are afraid of heights
we've<00:01:54.900> actually<00:01:55.170> decided<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:55.950> just<00:01:56.250> stay<00:01:56.460> back

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
we've actually decided to just stay back

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.730 
we've actually decided to just stay back
and<00:01:57.090> enjoy<00:01:57.360> a<00:01:57.390> very<00:01:57.780> relaxed<00:01:58.290> lunch<00:01:58.500> because
