down oh it gets gains control Olin
that's<00:00:07.080> all<00:00:07.350> Maxwell<00:00:08.010> the<00:00:08.250> big<00:00:08.460> hit<00:00:08.960> and

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
that's all Maxwell the big hit and

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.180 
that's all Maxwell the big hit and
they're<00:00:10.110> gonna<00:00:10.230> talk<00:00:10.469> it<00:00:10.679> over<00:00:10.769> a<00:00:10.920> little<00:00:11.010> bit

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190

they're gonna talk it over a little bit
there's<00:00:11.639> only<00:00:11.910> two<00:00:12.090> Maxwell<00:00:12.599> Owens<00:00:12.960> not

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
there's only two Maxwell Owens not

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.780 
there's only two Maxwell Owens not
impressed<00:00:13.500> Oh<00:00:13.620> Maxwell<00:00:14.160> gives<00:00:14.340> them<00:00:14.490> a<00:00:14.549> shot

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790 
impressed Oh Maxwell gives them a shot

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.779 
impressed Oh Maxwell gives them a shot
and<00:00:14.820> here<00:00:15.179> we<00:00:15.299> go

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:16.789 
and here we go

and here we go
there<00:00:17.789> is<00:00:17.970> Owens<00:00:18.359> and<00:00:18.600> Maxwell<00:00:19.140> they're

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
there is Owens and Maxwell they're

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:20.750 
there is Owens and Maxwell they're
squaring<00:00:20.010> off<00:00:20.220> here

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
squaring off here

squaring off here
Maxwell<00:00:21.300> trying<00:00:21.539> to<00:00:21.600> get<00:00:21.720> loose<00:00:22.160> Owens<00:00:23.160> got<00:00:23.279> a

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
Maxwell trying to get loose Owens got a

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.890 
Maxwell trying to get loose Owens got a
good<00:00:23.430> hold<00:00:23.609> ones<00:00:23.850> doing<00:00:24.060> pretty<00:00:24.210> well<00:00:24.300> Maxwell

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
good hold ones doing pretty well Maxwell

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.480 
good hold ones doing pretty well Maxwell
is<00:00:24.960> gonna<00:00:25.109> back<00:00:25.680> so<00:00:25.830> a<00:00:25.859> lot<00:00:26.039> bigger<00:00:26.250> guy<00:00:26.460> than

is gonna back so a lot bigger guy than

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.890 
is gonna back so a lot bigger guy than

right arm old ones hanging in there gets
the<00:00:44.820> tough<00:00:45.030> Maxwell<00:00:45.510> over<00:00:45.750> 200<00:00:46.050> minutes<00:00:46.200> and

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
the tough Maxwell over 200 minutes and

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.479 
the tough Maxwell over 200 minutes and
penalties<00:00:46.649> this<00:00:46.800> year<00:00:47.239> and<00:00:48.239> that'll<00:00:49.020> do<00:00:49.230> it

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489 
penalties this year and that'll do it

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:51.979 
penalties this year and that'll do it
Maxwell<00:00:50.489> hold<00:00:50.670> in<00:00:50.820> there<00:00:51.090> it<00:00:51.270> Maxwell<00:00:51.629> did<00:00:51.840> it

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
Maxwell hold in there it Maxwell did it

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.590 
Maxwell hold in there it Maxwell did it
probably<00:00:52.500> won<00:00:52.739> the<00:00:52.860> fight<00:00:53.070> but<00:00:53.280> Owen<00:00:53.610> Owen<00:00:53.879> hey

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
probably won the fight but Owen Owen hey

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.299 
probably won the fight but Owen Owen hey
I<00:00:54.870> gotta<00:00:55.050> give<00:00:55.199> him<00:00:55.260> credit<00:00:55.320> that's<00:00:55.860> often

Owen

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.210 
Owen
from<00:01:12.390> from<00:01:12.720> Cardiff<00:01:13.110> seems<00:01:13.710> like<00:01:13.890> Maxwell

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
from from Cardiff seems like Maxwell

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:15.499 
from from Cardiff seems like Maxwell
seams<00:01:14.490> have<00:01:14.549> been<00:01:14.670> cut<00:01:14.880> a<00:01:14.909> little<00:01:15.119> bit<00:01:15.299> on<00:01:15.390> the

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
out here seems you know Dennis Maxwell

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:28.580 
out here seems you know Dennis Maxwell
does<00:01:27.450> like<00:01:27.600> to<00:01:27.720> mix<00:01:27.869> it<00:01:28.020> up<00:01:28.080> he's<00:01:28.290> a<00:01:28.320> he's

does like to mix it up he's a he's
pretty<00:01:28.860> tough<00:01:29.070> guy<00:01:30.060> and<00:01:33.229> Maxwell<00:01:34.229> prob<00:01:35.220> make

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
pretty tough guy and Maxwell prob make

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.700 
pretty tough guy and Maxwell prob make
it<00:01:35.789> the<00:01:35.909> instigator

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
it the instigator

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:39.770 
it the instigator
he<00:01:37.710> dropped<00:01:37.920> his<00:01:37.979> gloves<00:01:38.220> first<00:01:38.580> I<00:01:39.030> may<00:01:39.570> get<00:01:39.750> I
