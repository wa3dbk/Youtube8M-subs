00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:10.559
 hi everyone today we get 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.580
 find for a halloween wing it's 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:14.160
 the first one I will present to you 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.929
 this year I stayed on a theme 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.600
 pretty classic for this one the 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.910
 spiders I first laid my base and 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.529
 a nude polish mostly English and then 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.840
 always with the same polish plus one 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.740
 orange polish and a mousse I'm going 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.960
 to make a gradient 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.539
 so as usual I put a 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.630
 first strip of varnish directly on 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.370
 my foam and stick to this first 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.590
 tape i'm going to add a second 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.090
 color of varnish 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:41.820
 right after I come I'll 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.129
 come stamped on my fingernail by doing 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.710
 slight movements up and down for 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.450
 mix the colors with his varnishes 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.489
 I preferred to add polish 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.379
 directly your paint brushes 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:53.039
 tip of my fingernail for it to be good 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.840
 opaque 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:56.579
 so once I did that I 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.960
 left a little dry and I repeat 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.840
 the same operation as just now 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.850
 I put some nail polish on my foam and 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.159
 again I gently stamp 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.210
 making slight movements 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:09.630
 then I will use a nail polish 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.610
 glitter my favorite and by far and I 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.350
 will come to apply it especially the nail 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.869
 it's only glitter 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.939
 translucent do not color it's going 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.530
 just add a lot of reflections he does not 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:22.619
 must not it hide the 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.509
 degraded then for the reason I'm going 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.490
 use acrylic paint and my 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.500
 detail brush and I'm going to start 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.450
 my spider I'm sorry if for 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.150
 the moment you do not see perfectly the 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.400
 shape of the spider with the colors 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.840
 brown and orange is not obvious but 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.150
 you will be able to see better when I do 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.740
 the contours so for now I'm doing 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.840
 a first ball is not quite 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.119
 a ball but pretty much a ball on 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.250
 will say and then we do a second 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.930
 stick to the first but a little bit 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.659
 bigger is a little bit more 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.210
 ball shape then comes to add 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.130
 two rounds of shots stuck at the level 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.079
 from the head of the meeting will say I'm 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.180
 sorry I'm not very good at 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.189
 anatomy vocabulary of the spider 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.020
 so we'll say it's small 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.040
 hooks right next to the balls that 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.800
 I made allergy 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.479
 add two small hooks and then 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.300
 I'm going to start making the legs of 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.760
 the spider so for the first dough 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.070
 she is stuck to the hook I made 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.050
 just before and then so I continue 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:22.020
 my paw like that I do nothing hyper 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.340
 accurate and obviously every time I 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.950
 do the same thing on the other side I 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.480
 do the symmetrical on the other side 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.670
 so here I go on doing but not 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.430
 like that they have pretty much everything 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.530
 same shape and the same orientation for 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.560
 the first six in any case the 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.150
 last is a lot more towards 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.930
 the back we will say as you can 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:45.090
 see him maybe then i'm going 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.790
 take a little more color 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.590
 dark and I'm going to come in add some 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.920
 shadows surely to reign so that's 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.490
 especially important on the body of 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:56.190
 the spider 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:58.680
 so I make a trait always the same 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.410
 side every time and I also like 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.720
 added a little amber at the level of 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.730
 legs of the spider there it is less 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.620
 important because it's done in less 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:10.530
 but it still adds a little 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.239
 nice detail and more so here I am 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:16.040
 on all the pasta and I do not forget 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:16.040
 the little hooks also at the end 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:21.480
 then I will take some paint 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:22.890
 black acrylic and I have this time doing 

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.410
 the outlines so that's where you 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:27.480
 will be able to see the shape of 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:30.420
 the spider the shape of each element 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:31.920
 so I do the contours of the body but 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.110
 also the outline of the legs I do 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.080
 really all the outlines I try to 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:38.610
 to make outlines earlier end but I 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:41.570
 do not appreciate anything either 

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.570
 especially for pasta 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.870
 he 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.920
 all 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:03.970
 then I take paint 

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:05.830
 brown acrylic rather dark finally 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.930
 very dark anyway and I 'm coming 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:10.870
 add little details on the body 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:13.239
 of the spider so for now on the 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.730
 head i'm going to do two lines we're going 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:17.440
 to say by doing small by blow like 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:20.680
 peas in fact surely to 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.450
 to rule is not very precise 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:26.380
 it's full of little bags or who go 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:28.510
 to form a kind of motives we will say and 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.710
 here I am actually I looked at little 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:30.220
 about what it looks like and about 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:34.830
 spiders 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.830
 but there is nothing very precise 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:41.050
 then once I finish that I 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:43.090
 keep the same acrylic paint and I 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:44.950
 just add a small trait on the 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:47.520
 pasta at the base of pasta close to the body 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:50.050
 of the spider actually 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:52.570
 then I take the black and I'm going 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:54.820
 do two eyes on my spiders and 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:57.960
 then I will make two more of 

00:04:54.820 --> 00:05:01.750
 each side but much smaller 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:03.760
 then with the dark brown paint I 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:06.789
 come make small hairs on them 

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:08.830
 paws of my spider but eventually 

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:10.169
 I do not know if it adds a lot to 

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:13.120
 made 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:15.250
 then I took my black paint but 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.229
 I diluted it a lot 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:19.180
 of water inside for it to be 

00:05:17.229 --> 00:05:21.070
 much more transparent and with this 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:23.169
 painting there I come to make the shadow so 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:24.520
 I put a little bit on the body of 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:26.020
 my spider but it's mostly at 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.120
 leg level that I just 

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:30.039
 work my number the pasta is a 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.910
 little bit curved month with the homo I 

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:34.270
 am going to do something a lot 

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:36.520
 more right then I put a little 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:38.890
 white border always on each side on 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.820
 each side always on the same side in 

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:42.460
 done on each leg 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:44.380
 so I just add his share all for 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:46.210
 that reigned in my doing better was 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:47.979
 not expected but I found that with his 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:50.410
 colors lamont spiders only stood out 

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:51.970
 not enough so I preferred to add this 

00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:53.220
 small white border but it's not 

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:55.830
 all obligatory 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:58.900
 then we will go to the other nails 

00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:01.060
 and that's where we'll do one of my 

00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:04.270
 darling patterns that's really a motive 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:06.430
 I love to do it's really I 

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:08.650
 find super pretty and fun to do 

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:10.300
 so it's a spider's web 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:11.800
 just you see I'm doing 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.100
 small strokes I start by doing some 

00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:15.510
 tris 

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:18.640
 for those purposes that always come together 

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:20.200
 on the same point where same center and 

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:22.720
 then once I have finished tracing 

00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:24.490
 but very straight like that I just come 

00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:27.070
 add kinds of little bridges 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:29.050
 to be is really very curvy who are going 

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:30.910
 connect the two main features 

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:33.180
 so here I am doing a little bit 

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:35.830
 everywhere every time between each stroke 

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:38.590
 but not always in the same place 

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:40.690
 always tight in the same way must 

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:43.510
 not that it's regular at all so 

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:44.770
 you never put in the same place so 

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:46.510
 here I really love the paintings 

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:48.850
 of spiders because it's easy 

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:50.680
 a quick to do if it's fine it's 

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:53.110
 as elegant despite it being a 

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:54.370
 cobweb I find and then he 

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:57.010
 all you have to do is put on top 

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:58.840
 coat especially your nails so here is for 

00:06:57.010 --> 00:06:59.710
 this first Halloween decoration I hope 

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:01.660
 what you liked 

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:02.910
 normally there are others who will 

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:05.680
 arrive soon 

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:07.210
