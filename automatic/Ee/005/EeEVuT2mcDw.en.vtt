 cyber so guys 1 ha called smash 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.840
 hit and remember there used to be a flappy game 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.309
 bird well of course you remember so here 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.190
 smash hit is much more interesting and 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.260
 more fun flappy bird gameplay smash 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.730
 hit is very simple with this smash hit and 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.710
 delays and simplicity you 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.059
 come back come back but this 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.760
 the game is because everything is very simple here 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.710
 beautiful and generally the atmosphere of the game is very 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.629
 very positive that we are here by you 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.460
 do we move the route which 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:01.649
 already laid in the game and our goal with you 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.439
 it knock down as many cones as possible and not 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.210
 getting caught in the mirror ie we have them 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.490
 break it all develops very 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.320
 beautiful mirrors beautifully crumble and 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.000
 like i said if we bump into 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.920
 a mirror then we lose some 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.540
 number of balls figure with balls not 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.040
 should reach 0 and then we will 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.680
 go through and go further and 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.659
 further how are you here different ugly 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.180
 by themselves and this is physics with which 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.979
 these mirrors fly away very cool 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:29.280
 In general, the guys and the game is very cool 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.650
 all the world is free smash hit 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.720
 move on now we can jump from 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.040
 joy and screaming and hallelujah it's all about 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:37.140
 Microsoft released 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.490
 office and the word excel package 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.140
 powerpoint on ip 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.450
 now we are seeing the word program 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.340
 this is a full text editor here 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.320
 we can upload documents either straight 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.840
 with ipad or with cloud one drive therefore 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.550
 need to register with the microsoft service in 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:52.740
 Generally in this program there is one but 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:54.270
 it is but worth $ 100 is a license 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.100
 without a license, we will not be able to edit 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.490
 no file in any of these three 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.289
 programs so it is powerful enough 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.020
 text editor there is markup here 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:06.149
 where the fonts are the insert where the tables and so 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.459
 further footers paragraphs and it's all here 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.380
 present however without registration and 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:12.330
 license we can not do anything here 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.300
 make a license costs $ 100 like 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:20.340
 same said three programs this board 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:22.290
 powerpoint and excel but with license start 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:26.090
 of this episode I recalled the flappy bird and 

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:28.319
 here is his next clone is mr flag 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.390
 if it is not true in general, the game is very 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:32.190
 simple and addictive because 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.829
 the new one doesnâ€™t look like the flop cake 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.180
 however here but the bird and and 3 and Celik 

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:38.310
 through which we must pass we 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:40.290
 must do one full circle not 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:43.530
 break and then we are only protected from 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.930
 1 game is difficult enough for her 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.260
 get used but may be enough already 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.000
 these flappy bird mr flat 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.099
 further game called pocket 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.319
 lightfighter light game that we are with you 

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:56.390
 three people of incomprehensible yellow men with 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:58.610
 they fall here such a trifle that we 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.530
 collect in the end this little thing we can 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.360
 spend on 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.950
 pumping our own character in 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.079
 In general, here is the interaction with the game 

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.209
 depends only on tapas we can also 

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:09.799
 hold the screen to make combos that is 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:12.379
 we see that our hero as 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:15.079
 tumbles in the air and kills all these 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:16.400
 yellow people locations can change 

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:17.329
 pump as I said our 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.000
 character and 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:21.349
 the game is just full of fun called 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.890
 pocket gun fighters 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:26.959
 and the last game in our top grater is 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:28.639
 racing called Rigency these races 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:30.139
 float here and there and not 

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:32.150
 free then paid again 

00:03:30.139 --> 00:03:36.049
 free and for now they are free 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:37.639
 god time as some websites write and in 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:39.319
 Generally in this game the main thing is 

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:41.420
 two fri and I went overboard a little 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:43.190
 however, 10 ashore is probably one of 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:45.739
 main print games because dream 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:48.019
 here is a very crazy car you can 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:50.269
 spin in such a drift then what will 

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:52.040
 bad but however the game is very cool she 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:53.900
 again full of fun even more than 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.660
 previous and now this game is sure 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:58.669
 worth playing because we don't want 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:01.780
 because it is a free game 

00:03:58.669 --> 00:04:04.400
 called ridge racer slipstream 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:06.319
 she there it all was top 5 best 

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.299
