00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 the head of cia john brennan thinks with 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.940
 using hard interrogation techniques 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.069
 applied to suspects in 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:10.230
 terrorism management persons succeeded 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.030
 get important information this 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.280
 statement contradicts report data 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.199
 US senators brennan those not 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.210
 less defended by applied 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.660
 methods 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.460
 the whole world was self confident could 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.169
 management get information from 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.210
 detainees without these methods 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:27.750
 interrogation during their detention under 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.419
 custody 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.009
 it is impossible to establish control positions 

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:34.379
 also my opinion after studying 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.970
 documents is that from 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:38.399
 detainees who were used 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:40.019
 extended interrogation methods were obtained 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.540
 very useful information 

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:44.659
 this statement criticized the senator 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:48.089
 Dianne Feinstein reporting 

00:00:44.659 --> 00:00:50.129
 said cr drop already admitted that torture 

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:52.230
 yielded no significant results 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.390
 she also denied the allegation 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.820
 Brandon according to which hard methods 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.190
 interrogation helped hunt down osama bin 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.440
 Laden adding that thanks to torture 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.600
 no one was saved and no one was caught 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.610
 one terrorist however after 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.110
 publication of a torture criticism report 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.840
 were not only American 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.880
 UK officials are calling 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.310
 investigate alleged involvement 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.720
 countries to the events described cause 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.759
 served the recognition of Downing Street 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.470
 according to which head 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.750
 British intelligence asked 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.390
 edit the report before publication 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.399
 host rt ok bell bell 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:30.060
 discussed the role in london and in this matter with 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:32.340
 parliamentarian Jeremy Corbin my 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.350
 between the Bush and Blair administrations were 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.380
 very close relationship I can not believe 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.390
 that blair was not in the know say bush about 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.890
 I knew everything if I knew about it 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.740
 I doubt that he did not share this 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.509
 information with tony blair that is all 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.820
 it raises many questions 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.950
 I think the investigation bangs up regarding 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.369
 circumstances of the Iraq war would be worth 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.409
 extend and do it 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.270
 means another investigation and not 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.670
 Click example considers it to be 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.979
 hold but will it give results 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:06.140
 will call for someone to answer because 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:06.140
 it goes taxpayer money on 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:11.850
 my opinion needs another investigation 

00:02:08.959 --> 00:02:13.590
 need open trial this 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:16.200
 there was an incredible hard time in our 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.880
 the stories of September 11 invasion 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.459
 Afghanistan and Iraq Guantanamo 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.410
 emergency issue some countries 

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.030
 did not even suspect that their territory 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.269
 used as transhipment 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.889
 point for emergency issuance 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:30.600
 Britain would have known me 

00:02:28.889 --> 00:02:31.470
 I wanted to tony blair standing on 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.510
 witness 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.700
 he did not tell what he knew about 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.740
 extradition process and torture 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.130
 explorer enterprise is on duty want 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.130
 add
