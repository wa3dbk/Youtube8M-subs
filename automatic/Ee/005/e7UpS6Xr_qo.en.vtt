00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.530 
don't feel this is what happened as the
first<00:06:19.620> release<00:06:19.950> of<00:06:19.980> Celestia<00:06:20.610> wasn't<00:06:21.270> a<00:06:21.330> gift

00:06:21.530 --> 00:06:21.540 
first release of Celestia wasn't a gift

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:25.010 
first release of Celestia wasn't a gift
set<00:06:21.750> with<00:06:22.400> Pinkie<00:06:23.400> Pie<00:06:23.550> so<00:06:23.850> why<00:06:24.690> would<00:06:24.900> it

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:25.020 
set with Pinkie Pie so why would it

00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:26.810 
set with Pinkie Pie so why would it
matter<00:06:25.050> other<00:06:25.500> theories<00:06:25.919> I<00:06:26.190> have<00:06:26.310> heard<00:06:26.580> our

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:26.820 
matter other theories I have heard our

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:29.720 
matter other theories I have heard our
forward<00:06:27.570> to<00:06:27.750> appeal<00:06:28.140> better<00:06:28.590> to<00:06:28.890> girls<00:06:29.220> the

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:29.730 
forward to appeal better to girls the

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:31.690 
forward to appeal better to girls the
same<00:06:29.910> problem<00:06:30.360> occurs<00:06:30.690> with<00:06:30.930> this<00:06:31.169> theory

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:31.700 
same problem occurs with this theory

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:34.159 
same problem occurs with this theory
Pinkie<00:06:32.700> Pie<00:06:32.850> I<00:06:33.060> have<00:06:33.270> also<00:06:33.480> heard<00:06:33.660> that<00:06:33.840> it's

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:34.169 
Pinkie Pie I have also heard that it's

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:37.100 
Pinkie Pie I have also heard that it's
because<00:06:34.590> of<00:06:34.620> her<00:06:34.919> pink<00:06:35.160> outline<00:06:35.550> maybe<00:06:36.540> but<00:06:37.080> I

00:06:37.100 --> 00:06:37.110 
because of her pink outline maybe but I

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:39.020 
because of her pink outline maybe but I
still<00:06:37.229> don't<00:06:37.800> feel<00:06:37.919> like<00:06:38.190> this<00:06:38.400> is<00:06:38.580> the<00:06:38.760> true

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:39.030 
still don't feel like this is the true

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:41.420 
still don't feel like this is the true
reason<00:06:39.510> for<00:06:40.110> a<00:06:40.140> minute<00:06:40.410> let's<00:06:40.860> take<00:06:41.070> a<00:06:41.100> look<00:06:41.340> at

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:41.430 
reason for a minute let's take a look at

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:44.690 
reason for a minute let's take a look at
previous<00:06:41.729> generations<00:06:42.600> I<00:06:42.870> know<00:06:43.110> I<00:06:43.770> know<00:06:44.190> in

previous generations I know I know in

00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:46.790 
previous generations I know I know in
previous<00:06:44.940> generations<00:06:45.350> they<00:06:46.350> never<00:06:46.560> had<00:06:46.770> a

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:46.800 
previous generations they never had a

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.130 
previous generations they never had a
character<00:06:47.310> such<00:06:47.580> as<00:06:47.700> Princess<00:06:48.090> Celestia<00:06:48.630> one

00:06:49.130 --> 00:06:49.140 
character such as Princess Celestia one

00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:50.990 
character such as Princess Celestia one
who<00:06:49.350> is<00:06:49.500> the<00:06:49.650> leader<00:06:49.890> of<00:06:50.040> the<00:06:50.280> ponies<00:06:50.669> and

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:51.000 
who is the leader of the ponies and

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.969 
who is the leader of the ponies and
perhaps<00:06:51.300> more<00:06:51.720> than<00:06:51.750> that<00:06:52.020> this<00:06:52.590> was<00:06:52.740> a<00:06:52.770> new

00:06:52.969 --> 00:06:52.979 
perhaps more than that this was a new

00:06:52.979 --> 00:06:55.010 
perhaps more than that this was a new
thing<00:06:53.010> for<00:06:53.220> Hasbro<00:06:53.820> and<00:06:54.120> they<00:06:54.419> felt<00:06:54.690> she<00:06:54.900> was

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:55.020 
thing for Hasbro and they felt she was

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:57.110 
thing for Hasbro and they felt she was
going<00:06:55.260> to<00:06:55.290> represent<00:06:55.500> the<00:06:55.919> brand<00:06:56.040> also<00:06:56.460> i<00:06:56.910> do

Celestia<00:07:11.820> they<00:07:12.150> probably<00:07:12.419> figured<00:07:12.900> why

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:13.440 
Celestia they probably figured why

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:15.560 
Celestia they probably figured why
change<00:07:13.770> it<00:07:13.979> it<00:07:14.310> was<00:07:14.460> only<00:07:14.610> after<00:07:14.910> brownie<00:07:15.360> up

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:15.570 
change it it was only after brownie up

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:17.420

cry<00:07:15.840> that<00:07:16.229> she<00:07:16.380> was<00:07:16.530> changed<00:07:16.950> to<00:07:17.010> be<00:07:17.190> white

cry that she was changed to be white

00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:19.790 
cry that she was changed to be white
which<00:07:18.030> means<00:07:18.390> they<00:07:18.990> never<00:07:19.229> intended<00:07:19.590> to

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:19.800 
which means they never intended to

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:22.070 
which means they never intended to
change<00:07:20.160> her<00:07:20.400> anyways<00:07:20.850> that's<00:07:21.360> my<00:07:21.479> thoughts<00:07:21.870> on
