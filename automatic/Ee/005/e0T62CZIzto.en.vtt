rail and you'll just see tell me the

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:04.259 
rail and you'll just see tell me the
track<00:02:58.420> a<00:02:58.450> look<00:02:59.820> getting<00:03:00.820> the<00:03:00.940> top<00:03:01.209> layer<00:03:03.269> so

track a look getting the top layer so
weathering<00:03:04.780> off<00:03:06.480> like<00:03:07.480> that<00:03:07.720> and<00:03:08.730> you<00:03:09.730> can<00:03:09.910> see
