00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.100 
do is they go early muta lisc pressure
and<00:02:42.340> then<00:02:42.459> just<00:02:42.670> use<00:02:42.849> that<00:02:43.060> to<00:02:43.239> kind<00:02:43.420> of<00:02:43.569> follow

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
and then just use that to kind of follow

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.170 
and then just use that to kind of follow
up<00:02:44.379> with<00:02:44.560> the<00:02:44.920> drop<00:02:45.190> and<00:02:45.220> kind<00:02:45.730> of<00:02:45.790> cover<00:02:45.970> that

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
up with the drop and kind of cover that

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.720 
up with the drop and kind of cover that
against<00:02:46.480> dropship<00:02:47.230> so<00:02:47.440> and<00:02:48.310> I<00:02:48.400> think<00:02:48.459> that's

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:48.730 
against dropship so and I think that's

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.670 
against dropship so and I think that's
actually<00:02:49.030> really<00:02:49.690> clever<00:02:50.019> maneuver<00:02:50.260> I<00:02:50.410> think

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
actually really clever maneuver I think

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.229 
actually really clever maneuver I think
Zerg<00:02:50.890> basically<00:02:51.640> no<00:02:51.730> matter<00:02:51.910> what<00:02:52.060> they<00:02:52.090> do

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
Zerg basically no matter what they do

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:53.520 
Zerg basically no matter what they do
they've<00:02:52.540> got<00:02:52.750> to<00:02:52.900> take<00:02:53.049> the<00:02:53.170> island

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
they've got to take the island

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.500 
they've got to take the island
expansions<00:02:54.010> because<00:02:54.579> if<00:02:54.670> you<00:02:54.730> do<00:02:54.849> not<00:02:55.180> take

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
expansions because if you do not take

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.390 
expansions because if you do not take
the<00:02:55.660> island<00:02:55.959> expansions<00:02:56.440> I<00:02:56.709> just<00:02:57.250> feel<00:02:57.370> like

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
the island expansions I just feel like

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.770 
the island expansions I just feel like
late-game<00:02:57.700> it's<00:02:58.030> just<00:02:58.239> too<00:02:58.329> difficult<00:02:58.510> you

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:58.780 
late-game it's just too difficult you

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.289 
late-game it's just too difficult you

marines<00:04:05.319> can<00:04:05.500> really<00:04:05.680> run<00:04:05.799> yeah<00:04:06.099> an<00:04:06.250> Academy

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:06.700 
marines can really run yeah an Academy

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:07.860 
marines can really run yeah an Academy
before<00:04:06.880> an<00:04:07.090> additional<00:04:07.419> barracks<00:04:07.690> or<00:04:07.780> a

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
before an additional barracks or a

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.349 
before an additional barracks or a
single<00:04:08.049> marine<00:04:08.290> as<00:04:08.440> well<00:04:08.590> so<00:04:09.549> and<00:04:10.000> it<00:04:10.209> looks

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:10.359 
single marine as well so and it looks

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:11.670 
single marine as well so and it looks
like<00:04:10.419> save<00:04:10.840> you're<00:04:10.989> going<00:04:11.139> directly<00:04:11.410> layer

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
like save you're going directly layer

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:12.629 
like save you're going directly layer
and<00:04:11.769> I<00:04:11.859> think<00:04:12.040> this<00:04:12.099> is<00:04:12.160> really<00:04:12.310> going<00:04:12.459> to<00:04:12.549> pay

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:12.639 
and I think this is really going to pay

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:14.039 
and I think this is really going to pay
off<00:04:12.669> for<00:04:12.910> bogus<00:04:13.239> and<00:04:13.419> I<00:04:13.480> kind<00:04:13.720> of<00:04:13.750> like<00:04:13.900> this

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:14.049 
off for bogus and I kind of like this

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:15.509 
off for bogus and I kind of like this
decision<00:04:14.470> making<00:04:14.769> his<00:04:14.950> regard<00:04:15.250> looks<00:04:15.400> like

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:15.519 
decision making his regard looks like

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:16.949 
decision making his regard looks like
saviors<00:04:15.819> definitely<00:04:16.180> going<00:04:16.359> muta<00:04:16.570> lists<00:04:16.780> here

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
saviors definitely going muta lists here

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.050 
saviors definitely going muta lists here
he's<00:04:17.769> got<00:04:17.889> that<00:04:18.039> second<00:04:18.370> gas<00:04:18.489> pumping<00:04:18.910> to

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:19.060 
he's got that second gas pumping to

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.400 
he's got that second gas pumping to
provide<00:04:19.479> it<00:04:19.599> and<00:04:19.660> he's<00:04:19.780> really<00:04:19.930> skimped<00:04:20.380> on

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:20.410 
provide it and he's really skimped on

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:22.350 
provide it and he's really skimped on
this<00:04:20.560> earthling<00:04:20.829> those<00:04:21.010> far<00:04:21.250> so<00:04:21.789> again<00:04:22.150> just

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
this earthling those far so again just

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:23.610 
this earthling those far so again just
going<00:04:22.599> to<00:04:22.659> pay<00:04:22.780> off<00:04:22.900> and<00:04:23.050> bogus<00:04:23.320> his<00:04:23.440> favor

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
going to pay off and bogus his favor

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:24.899 
going to pay off and bogus his favor
let's<00:04:23.830> see<00:04:23.919> if<00:04:23.979> he<00:04:24.070> can<00:04:24.159> at<00:04:24.280> least<00:04:24.370> stop<00:04:24.610> that<00:04:24.789> s

00:04:24.899 --> 00:04:24.909 
let's see if he can at least stop that s

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:26.490 
let's see if he can at least stop that s
to<00:04:25.030> be<00:04:25.120> scout<00:04:25.360> and<00:04:25.659> provide<00:04:26.020> a<00:04:26.050> little<00:04:26.289> bit<00:04:26.380> of

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
to be scout and provide a little bit of

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.790 
to be scout and provide a little bit of
pressure

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:26.800 
pressure

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.249 
pressure
here<00:04:27.210> but<00:04:28.210> but<00:04:28.720> yeah<00:04:28.840> he's<00:04:28.960> going<00:04:29.110> to<00:04:29.169> have

00:04:29.249 --> 00:04:29.259 
here but but yeah he's going to have

00:04:29.259 --> 00:04:30.420 
here but but yeah he's going to have
early<00:04:29.500> weapons<00:04:29.800> one<00:04:29.979> he's<00:04:30.129> going<00:04:30.280> to<00:04:30.340> have

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:30.430 
early weapons one he's going to have

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:32.279 
early weapons one he's going to have
early<00:04:30.759> range<00:04:31.030> and<00:04:31.300> all<00:04:31.810> he<00:04:31.900> has<00:04:32.020> to<00:04:32.050> do<00:04:32.259> is

00:04:32.279 --> 00:04:32.289 
early range and all he has to do is

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:33.600 
early range and all he has to do is
follow<00:04:32.500> this<00:04:32.680> up<00:04:32.740> with<00:04:32.889> a<00:04:33.039> couple<00:04:33.220> barracks

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:33.610 
follow this up with a couple barracks

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:34.890 
follow this up with a couple barracks
and<00:04:33.699> he's<00:04:33.819> going<00:04:33.940> to<00:04:34.030> be<00:04:34.120> pretty<00:04:34.419> well<00:04:34.629> covered

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
and he's going to be pretty well covered

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:35.969 
and he's going to be pretty well covered
against<00:04:35.080> the<00:04:35.169> middle<00:04:35.379> scho<00:04:35.560> tech<00:04:35.710> that<00:04:35.860> might

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:35.979 
against the middle scho tech that might

00:04:35.979 --> 00:04:37.740 
against the middle scho tech that might
be<00:04:36.069> coming<00:04:36.430> and<00:04:36.550> those<00:04:36.970> music's<00:04:37.479> are<00:04:37.569> going<00:04:37.690> to

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
be coming and those music's are going to

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.809 
be coming and those music's are going to
be<00:04:37.840> very<00:04:38.020> ineffective<00:04:38.409> very<00:04:38.860> early<00:04:39.280> as<00:04:39.430> a

00:04:39.809 --> 00:04:39.819 
be very ineffective very early as a

00:04:39.819 --> 00:04:41.760 
be very ineffective very early as a
result<00:04:40.240> and<00:04:40.449> you<00:04:40.599> can<00:04:40.750> yeah<00:04:40.990> the<00:04:41.169> weapons<00:04:41.590> want

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:41.770 
result and you can yeah the weapons want

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:43.320 
result and you can yeah the weapons want
upgrading<00:04:42.099> and<00:04:42.190> I<00:04:42.250> assume<00:04:42.580> that<00:04:42.610> range<00:04:43.210> and

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
upgrading and I assume that range and

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:44.760 
upgrading and I assume that range and
stem<00:04:43.569> are<00:04:43.690> going<00:04:43.810> to<00:04:43.870> be<00:04:43.930> upgrading<00:04:44.319> shortly

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
stem are going to be upgrading shortly

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.920 
stem are going to be upgrading shortly
and<00:04:44.919> that<00:04:45.009> it's<00:04:45.729> it's<00:04:46.449> just<00:04:46.509> going<00:04:46.720> to<00:04:46.780> come

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930 
and that it's it's just going to come

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:48.600 
and that it's it's just going to come
out<00:04:46.960> a<00:04:47.050> lot<00:04:47.259> faster<00:04:47.680> those<00:04:47.800> mute<00:04:48.009> escs<00:04:48.310> are

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:48.610 
out a lot faster those mute escs are

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:50.420 
out a lot faster those mute escs are
essentially<00:04:49.180> going<00:04:49.300> to<00:04:49.360> be<00:04:49.449> a<00:04:49.479> lot<00:04:49.659> weaker<00:04:49.930> and

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
essentially going to be a lot weaker and

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.170 
essentially going to be a lot weaker and
specifically<00:04:51.430> they're<00:04:51.580> going<00:04:51.699> to<00:04:51.759> be<00:04:51.819> it's

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.180 
specifically they're going to be it's

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:53.159 
specifically they're going to be it's
going<00:04:52.210> to<00:04:52.360> be<00:04:52.419> more<00:04:52.539> difficult<00:04:52.599> for<00:04:53.020> them<00:04:53.110> to

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:53.169 
going to be more difficult for them to

00:04:53.169 --> 00:04:55.529 
going to be more difficult for them to
do<00:04:53.470> any<00:04:53.620> sort<00:04:53.770> of<00:04:53.919> map<00:04:54.759> control<00:04:55.180> should<00:04:55.360> save

00:04:55.529 --> 00:04:55.539 
do any sort of map control should save

00:04:55.539 --> 00:04:56.700 
do any sort of map control should save
your<00:04:55.629> taken<00:04:55.900> to<00:04:55.990> the<00:04:56.080> ground<00:04:56.289> base<00:04:56.500> which

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
your taken to the ground base which

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.230 
your taken to the ground base which
again<00:04:57.129> he'd<00:04:57.310> have<00:04:57.430> to<00:04:57.490> be<00:04:57.580> spread<00:04:57.819> out<00:04:57.849> to<00:04:58.060> take

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240 
again he'd have to be spread out to take

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:00.270 
again he'd have to be spread out to take
and<00:04:58.479> additionally<00:04:59.169> if<00:04:59.289> he<00:04:59.440> tries<00:04:59.740> to<00:04:59.770> go<00:04:59.949> for

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.280 
and additionally if he tries to go for

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.879 
and additionally if he tries to go for
kind<00:05:00.580> of<00:05:00.639> the<00:05:00.729> air<00:05:00.879> the<00:05:01.090> drop<00:05:01.560> bogus<00:05:02.560> can<00:05:02.740> use

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:02.889 
kind of the air the drop bogus can use

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:04.110 
kind of the air the drop bogus can use
kind<00:05:03.129> of<00:05:03.190> the<00:05:03.250> Marines<00:05:03.550> to<00:05:03.699> kind<00:05:03.879> of<00:05:03.940> funnel

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:04.120 
kind of the Marines to kind of funnel

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.820 
kind of the Marines to kind of funnel
out<00:05:04.300> and<00:05:04.479> kind<00:05:04.840> of<00:05:04.870> put<00:05:05.020> pressure<00:05:05.229> on<00:05:05.440> while<00:05:05.650> he

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:05.830 
out and kind of put pressure on while he

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.350 
out and kind of put pressure on while he
and<00:05:06.069> kind<00:05:06.310> of<00:05:06.370> covers<00:05:06.639> drop<00:05:06.879> ships<00:05:07.090> a<00:05:07.150> little

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
and kind of covers drop ships a little

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.089 
and kind of covers drop ships a little
bit<00:05:07.449> better<00:05:07.599> when<00:05:08.199> he's<00:05:08.349> kind<00:05:08.740> of<00:05:08.800> going<00:05:08.979> that

00:05:09.089 --> 00:05:09.099 
bit better when he's kind of going that

00:05:09.099 --> 00:05:10.050 
bit better when he's kind of going that
direction<00:05:09.250> I<00:05:09.550> don't<00:05:09.669> think<00:05:09.789> he's<00:05:09.879> going<00:05:09.969> to

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.060 
direction I don't think he's going to

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.600 
direction I don't think he's going to
cycle<00:05:10.210> back<00:05:10.449> to<00:05:10.509> drop<00:05:10.840> though<00:05:11.250> at<00:05:12.250> least<00:05:12.310> not

cycle back to drop though at least not

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.850 
cycle back to drop though at least not
for<00:05:12.849> for<00:05:13.509> a<00:05:13.569> bit<00:05:13.719> of<00:05:13.810> time<00:05:13.960> and<00:05:14.199> getting<00:05:14.770> the

think then he's going to make that

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:00.930 
think then he's going to make that
choice<00:05:59.979> whether<00:06:00.250> he's<00:06:00.430> going<00:06:00.490> to<00:06:00.580> stick<00:06:00.819> the

choice whether he's going to stick the
medic<00:06:01.150> marine<00:06:01.389> ground<00:06:01.599> army<00:06:01.870> go<00:06:01.960> for<00:06:02.169> a<00:06:02.199> front
