00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:09.670
 hi friends is Friday and we came back with a program where electronic 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:13.800
 computer science are the protagonists this week we bring you 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:19.020
 some of the mobile phones that will reign in 2011 and also for showing a 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.820
 Car radio that incorporates Android said this will never be more 

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:29.039
 The thinnest mobile phone in the world not only stands out for this reason 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.540
 but as we saw a few days ago this successor of dispatched inc and spies 

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:36.539
 arrives at the market with great tricks to succeed 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:43.390
 and is that it will fire 3 humet and operating system designs but also its 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.310
 screen the glove compartment a new technology of the yamada company 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:48.609
 reality display 

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:53.829
 thanks to it the xperia arc offers a density of 223 pixels per inch 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:59.249
 only surpassed by the retina display of iphone 4 but let's not go to 

00:00:59.249 --> 00:01:03.839
 cry for that because if we combine the four comma 2 inch screen and the 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:07.520
 living brave motor must optimize the image as much as possible 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.890
 then one falls in love with the terminal 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.880
 in this video sony ericsson shows the faculties of the bravial liguilla and where 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.080
 yes optimistic the contrast in the shadows that implies a good color other 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.860
 of its wonders is an exit hdmi 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.130
 with which we can see the interface on a television playing browse 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.000
 internet I will obey them with incredible quality soon we will be able to analyze what 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.650
 more in detail because in my opinion from those phones keenan more than 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:36.950
 that looks 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.950
 And it is 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.950
 the mobile world congress of barcelona is very close and nokia will present 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:46.270
 there 

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.780
 your Nokia has nine a phone that equates for the first time min the 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.780
 platform developed by the manufacturer and together with 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.710
 this terminal will bring with it a amoled screen of 4 comma 2 inches and 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.240
 the same camera that is n 8 but what will truly decide about the future 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.190
 will be the operating system that should convince the market of its power 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:14.110
 in front of them andy roddick or windows phone to which by the way they remind me 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.110
 some concepts 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:24.749
 in ces 2011 and it has shown all kinds of innovative devices 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.670
 is what Motorola has done with its hat-trick 4g marks a before and a 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:33.139
 then in personal computing 

00:02:33.139 --> 00:02:38.079
 next to the phone we found a laptop body without internal parts this 

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:40.160
 body only has one battery 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.950
 a keyboard and a led screen of 11 shots 6 inches but good is that 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.660
 also includes a special touch to connect the motorola atrix transcending 

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.340
 the interface of the phone to the laptop although the favoritism of the set itself 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:56.449
 the tlc 

00:02:56.449 --> 00:03:01.279
 Once the motorola atrix 4g is connected to the laptop, the power is consumed 

00:03:01.279 --> 00:03:05.999
 the battery of this with a range of up to eight hours the future is thus the 

00:03:05.999 --> 00:03:08.620
 brain we did not carry in your pocket and I saw it 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.200
 positive only given hala favors that will run with our March good theme 

00:03:18.279 --> 00:03:22.519
 and brown are also the penalties and has shown some details very 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:24.459
 interesting and striking 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:28.760
 parrot asteroid is one of the first car radios with an interview with 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.610
 functions for telephony connection to services has access to 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:37.299
 applications as a selection of different audio sources being a radio with 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:41.489
 android it is clear that vines until today must connect to the network of some 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:45.739
 way and for it the rickety a Portuguese in the pÃ¡ramo of stress that 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:49.769
 being able to be informed at all times of stores with such as the one 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:52.299
 he promised that he is around us 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:56.540
 which we can call directly making use of the selection and 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.860
 thinking about telecom on screen 

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.399
 d 

00:04:00.399 --> 00:04:05.779
 so the great game of allowing music to play has a lot of 

00:04:05.779 --> 00:04:07.209
 sources like internet 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:12.569
 a computer there are four an mp3 player sd cards according to this station this 

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:17.650
 Internet space the rough parrot and also has music search 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:22.229
 by voice recognition thus avoiding having to navigate through menus in 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:25.229
 Search for a topic or send clearly 

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:30.890
