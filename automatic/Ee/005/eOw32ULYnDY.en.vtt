00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.230
 Hello, I recently had an idea 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:10.190
 hang jars of spices on magnets 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.480
 in turn, the jars themselves are signed and 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.370
 laminated and to label with 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.040
 time did not fall into disrepair but 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:19.500
 Also there is another innovation I came up with 

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.990
 how to make laminating hermetic 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.000
 so that the jar can be washed later 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.340
 to start printing again cut 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.349
 the image in this case is the name 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.330
 spices and make this from this 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.900
 double-sided sticker 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.900
 scotch tape 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.829
 further we need thermo-glue saw 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.500
 such a grid and this grid 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:45.500
 designed up fabric but by intermediaries 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:49.899
 among themselves but even if not this is not 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.899
 scary I'll tell you how to do without it 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:05.890
 fix one end of the left mesh survey 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:09.660
 just wrapping around the jar fix 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.660
 hot melt 2 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.400
 as you can see the tape grid is wide enough 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.680
 I then just got to the idea that you can 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:23.479
 it was just fold in half and thereby 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:23.479
 there would be greater sealing reliability 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.780
 put the whole structure inside 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:38.149
 plastic bottle and start to heat up 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.689
 industrial hair dryer why plastic 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:43.369
 narrows and covers the bank and 

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:47.439
 hot melt glue seals all 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:47.439
 top and bottom construction 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.930
 By the way, instead of the grid, you can apply 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.480
 thermal glue around with 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.880
 hot melt glue gun in this case 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.280
 you need to do it as carefully as possible 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:27.560
 to trickle glue from the gun 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.560
 was applied evenly and evenly 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:36.489
 now about the mount design 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:39.189
 we need a plastic corner two by two 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:41.739
 A centimeter in my case is available in 

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:43.689
 any hardware store with one 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:46.900
 hand drill it a hole for 

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:50.849
 fastening door magnets and fasten them 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.849
 pairwise with bolts 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.980
 bolt washer through two magnets and a corner 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:02.319
 then grower and covered 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.989
 decorative nut because simple 

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:07.540
 nut aesthetics will not create such 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:10.319
 the nut frontally looks like its 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.319
 kind of rivet 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:35.540
 such a profile angle will fasten to 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.540
 hanging locker with screws 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:40.940
 let's test for tightness 

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:04.180
 and apparently the paper under the film is not 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:06.130
 wet it all for now 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.190
 soon new channels will appear on my channel 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:10.599
 releases therefore subscribe to the channel 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:14.250
 like if you like the idea 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:14.250
 video and see you soon
