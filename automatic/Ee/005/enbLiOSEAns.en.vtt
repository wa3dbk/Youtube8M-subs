00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
have buttons there touch buttons what we

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.300 
have buttons there touch buttons what we
call<00:01:05.519> it's<00:01:06.290> just<00:01:07.290> that<00:01:07.500> you<00:01:07.830> got<00:01:07.979> these<00:01:08.159> little

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
call it's just that you got these little

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.390 
call it's just that you got these little
icons<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.180> you<00:01:09.240> just<00:01:09.810> have<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.140> press<00:01:10.860> your

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
icons and you just have to press your

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.200 
icons and you just have to press your
finger<00:01:11.939> across<00:01:12.299> that<00:01:13.229> icon<00:01:13.740> and<00:01:13.890> it's<00:01:14.520> touch

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
finger across that icon and it's touch

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.219 
finger across that icon and it's touch
so<00:01:16.200> it's<00:01:16.290> not<00:01:16.409> a<00:01:16.470> button<00:01:16.830> in<00:01:17.580> itself<00:01:18.030> so<00:01:18.479> look

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
so it's not a button in itself so look

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.499 
so it's not a button in itself so look
for<00:01:19.409> that<00:01:19.530> and<00:01:19.830> in<00:01:20.549> your<00:01:20.610> computer<00:01:21.360> monitor

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
for that and in your computer monitor

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:25.480 
for that and in your computer monitor
well<00:01:21.990> you'll<00:01:22.200> have<00:01:22.439> a<00:01:22.880> brightness<00:01:23.900> setting

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:25.490 
well you'll have a brightness setting

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.999 
well you'll have a brightness setting
but<00:01:26.490> on<00:01:26.640> a<00:01:26.729> laptop<00:01:26.970> for<00:01:27.479> example<00:01:27.990> now<00:01:28.470> you<00:01:28.530> can

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
but on a laptop for example now you can

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.520 
but on a laptop for example now you can
actually<00:01:29.280> have<00:01:29.759> two<00:01:30.119> ways<00:01:30.329> of<00:01:30.630> dealing<00:01:31.320> with

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
actually have two ways of dealing with

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.920 
actually have two ways of dealing with
brightness<00:01:31.950> you<00:01:32.579> will<00:01:32.909> have<00:01:33.180> keyboard

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
brightness you will have keyboard

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.530 
brightness you will have keyboard
shortcuts<00:01:33.990> for<00:01:34.619> brightness<00:01:35.360> often<00:01:36.360> it's

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
shortcuts for brightness often it's

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.160 
shortcuts for brightness often it's
depicted<00:01:37.729> with<00:01:38.729> a<00:01:38.970> little<00:01:39.299> icon<00:01:39.750> that<00:01:39.780> looks

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
little Sun and that will you know change

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.789 
little Sun and that will you know change
the<00:01:54.540> brightness<00:01:54.720> of<00:01:55.110> your<00:01:55.140> screen<00:01:55.470> just<00:01:55.740> by

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
better at the top on the F keys but I've

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.040 
better at the top on the F keys but I've
seen<00:02:37.200> them<00:02:37.470> for<00:02:37.860> example<00:02:38.400> on<00:02:38.640> the<00:02:39.420> lower<00:02:39.660> right

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
seen them for example on the lower right

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:45.470 
seen them for example on the lower right
into<00:02:40.680> the<00:02:41.300> little<00:02:42.300> arrow<00:02:42.540> keys<00:02:43.370> and<00:02:44.370> it's<00:02:44.819> very

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
into the little arrow keys and it's very

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.120 
into the little arrow keys and it's very
often<00:02:45.870> there<00:02:46.019> in<00:02:46.110> combination<00:02:46.830> so<00:02:47.459> look<00:02:47.730> for<00:02:48.060> a

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
often there in combination so look for a

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.990 
often there in combination so look for a
button<00:02:50.130> on<00:02:50.519> your<00:02:50.670> keyboard<00:02:50.910> that<00:02:52.280> is<00:02:53.280> function

most of the time function is abbreviated

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.190 
most of the time function is abbreviated
FN<00:02:57.600> so<00:02:58.350> look<00:02:58.560> for<00:02:58.769> a<00:02:58.799> key<00:02:59.250> called<00:02:59.580> FN<00:03:00.150> hold<00:03:00.959> that

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200 
FN so look for a key called FN hold that

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:04.789 
FN so look for a key called FN hold that
key<00:03:01.530> and<00:03:01.709> then<00:03:02.610> look<00:03:02.850> for<00:03:03.209> another<00:03:03.540> a<00:03:03.989> key<00:03:04.620> or

00:03:04.789 --> 00:03:04.799 
key and then look for another a key or

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:07.009 
key and then look for another a key or
two<00:03:05.010> that<00:03:05.190> have<00:03:05.459> a<00:03:05.760> little<00:03:06.030> sunshine<00:03:06.390> on<00:03:06.840> them
