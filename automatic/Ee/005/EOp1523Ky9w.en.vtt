okay<00:00:01.260> this<00:00:01.530> week's<00:00:01.800> video<00:00:02.129> is<00:00:02.310> going<00:00:02.580> to<00:00:02.879> be<00:00:03.030> a

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:03.360 
okay this week's video is going to be a

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.809 
okay this week's video is going to be a
quick<00:00:04.259> short<00:00:04.650> one<00:00:04.799> I'm<00:00:05.490> going<00:00:05.670> to<00:00:05.730> show

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
quick short one I'm going to show

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:07.700 
quick short one I'm going to show
something<00:00:06.359> that<00:00:06.390> I<00:00:06.540> don't<00:00:07.049> think<00:00:07.379> is<00:00:07.529> really

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:07.710 
something that I don't think is really

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.780 
something that I don't think is really
being<00:00:08.040> used<00:00:08.750> enough<00:00:09.750> within<00:00:10.469> zbrush<00:00:11.309> it's<00:00:11.700> a

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
being used enough within zbrush it's a

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.459 
being used enough within zbrush it's a
cool<00:00:12.120> tool<00:00:12.540> that<00:00:12.570> might<00:00:13.019> be<00:00:13.139> able<00:00:13.230> to<00:00:13.290> solve

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
cool tool that might be able to solve

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.279 
cool tool that might be able to solve
some<00:00:13.559> problems<00:00:14.070> when<00:00:14.820> you<00:00:14.940> run<00:00:15.089> into<00:00:15.389> it<00:00:15.540> so<00:00:16.260> I

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
some problems when you run into it so I

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.640 
some problems when you run into it so I
have<00:00:16.740> just<00:00:16.949> a<00:00:17.160> poly<00:00:17.960> spear<00:00:18.960> here<00:00:19.230> that<00:00:19.529> I've

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:19.650 
have just a poly spear here that I've

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.480 
have just a poly spear here that I've
created<00:00:19.980> a<00:00:20.369> poly<00:00:21.330> mesh<00:00:21.570> has<00:00:22.199> four<00:00:22.769> subdivision

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
created a poly mesh has four subdivision

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.870 
created a poly mesh has four subdivision
levels<00:00:23.850> so<00:00:24.600> we're<00:00:25.560> dealing<00:00:25.710> with<00:00:25.920> right

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
levels so we're dealing with right

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.300 
levels so we're dealing with right
around<00:00:27.240> a<00:00:27.689> five<00:00:28.650> hundred<00:00:28.890> twenty<00:00:29.160> four

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
around a five hundred twenty four

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.880 
around a five hundred twenty four
thousand<00:00:29.789> polygons<00:00:30.449> okay<00:00:31.289> so<00:00:31.349> what<00:00:31.769> we're

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
thousand polygons okay so what we're

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.290 
thousand polygons okay so what we're
going<00:00:32.009> to<00:00:32.040> do<00:00:32.250> is<00:00:32.460> here<00:00:32.700> we're<00:00:32.850> just<00:00:32.880> going<00:00:33.210> to

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
going to do is here we're just going to

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.920 
going to do is here we're just going to
use<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.870> pinch<00:00:34.110> brush<00:00:34.320> really<00:00:34.770> quick<00:00:35.010> on<00:00:35.250> this

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
use the pinch brush really quick on this

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.630 
use the pinch brush really quick on this
so<00:00:36.930> let<00:00:37.020> me<00:00:37.079> grab<00:00:37.290> my<00:00:37.320> pinch<00:00:37.710> brush<00:00:37.920> here<00:00:38.399> and

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
so let me grab my pinch brush here and

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.869 
so let me grab my pinch brush here and
let's<00:00:39.420> create<00:00:39.989> a<00:00:40.200> couple<00:00:40.410> strokes<00:00:40.920> within

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
let's create a couple strokes within

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:46.430 
let's create a couple strokes within
this<00:00:42.030> pinch<00:00:42.450> brush<00:00:42.719> here<00:00:43.410> on<00:00:43.770> this<00:00:44.010> sphere<00:00:45.440> so

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
this pinch brush here on this sphere so

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.360 
this pinch brush here on this sphere so
and<00:00:46.860> we<00:00:47.610> get<00:00:47.760> that<00:00:48.120> and<00:00:48.930> it<00:00:49.649> knows<00:00:50.039> when<00:00:50.280> you

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
and we get that and it knows when you

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.799 
and we get that and it knows when you
especially<00:00:50.640> use<00:00:50.940> something<00:00:51.239> like<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.539> pinch

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
especially use something like the pinch

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.779 
especially use something like the pinch
brush<00:00:52.309> what<00:00:53.309> happens<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.940> your<00:00:54.390> topology<00:00:55.789> if

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
brush what happens to your topology if

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:58.610 
brush what happens to your topology if
you<00:00:56.940> notice<00:00:57.270> starts<00:00:57.840> to<00:00:58.050> motion<00:00:58.379> as<00:00:58.469> well

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
you notice starts to motion as well

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.069 
you notice starts to motion as well
obviously<00:00:59.280> and<00:00:59.609> it<00:01:00.000> becomes<00:01:00.329> difficult<00:01:00.600> if<00:01:00.960> I

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
obviously and it becomes difficult if I

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.930 
obviously and it becomes difficult if I
want<00:01:01.289> to<00:01:01.379> add<00:01:01.469> detail<00:01:01.890> say<00:01:02.129> in<00:01:02.280> between<00:01:02.640> here

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
want to add detail say in between here

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.969 
want to add detail say in between here
these<00:01:03.059> two<00:01:03.300> pinches<00:01:03.690> I<00:01:03.960> don't<00:01:04.619> have<00:01:04.769> enough

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
these two pinches I don't have enough

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.969 
these two pinches I don't have enough
polygons<00:01:05.519> there<00:01:05.729> to<00:01:05.820> add<00:01:05.939> that<00:01:06.150> detail

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
polygons there to add that detail

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:08.840 
polygons there to add that detail
another<00:01:07.979> thing<00:01:08.189> that<00:01:08.310> you'll<00:01:08.400> find<00:01:08.610> let<00:01:08.790> me

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
another thing that you'll find let me

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.990 
another thing that you'll find let me
switch<00:01:09.060> the<00:01:09.270> standard<00:01:09.689> brush<00:01:11.000> that's

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
switch the standard brush that's

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.060 
switch the standard brush that's
standard<00:01:12.570> brush<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.229> let's<00:01:13.530> just<00:01:13.710> create<00:01:13.979> a

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
standard brush and let's just create a

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.010 
standard brush and let's just create a
little<00:01:14.220> full<00:01:14.580> really<00:01:14.909> quick<00:01:15.270> here<00:01:15.600> in<00:01:15.810> this

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
little full really quick here in this

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.810 
little full really quick here in this
sphere<00:01:16.590> and<00:01:16.909> give<00:01:17.909> it<00:01:18.000> a<00:01:18.060> little<00:01:18.210> Ridge<00:01:18.600> and

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
sphere and give it a little Ridge and

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.640 
sphere and give it a little Ridge and
then<00:01:20.820> let's<00:01:21.210> use<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.570> pinch<00:01:21.840> brush<00:01:22.049> again<00:01:22.500> on

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
then let's use the pinch brush again on

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.090 
then let's use the pinch brush again on
that<00:01:23.000> on<00:01:24.000> the<00:01:24.240> ridge<00:01:24.540> just<00:01:25.080> give<00:01:25.860> it<00:01:25.920> a<00:01:25.950> little

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
that on the ridge just give it a little

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.850 
that on the ridge just give it a little
more<00:01:26.280> definition<00:01:27.020> here<00:01:28.020> make<00:01:28.380> it<00:01:28.409> a<00:01:28.560> harder

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
more definition here make it a harder

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.080 
more definition here make it a harder
edge<00:01:28.970> so<00:01:29.970> again<00:01:30.659> so<00:01:30.960> you<00:01:31.020> start<00:01:31.909> losing<00:01:32.909> your

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
edge so again so you start losing your

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.929 
edge so again so you start losing your
poly<00:01:33.450> on<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:34.650> mesh<00:01:34.950> in<00:01:35.189> oxy<00:01:35.640> and<00:01:35.729> that's<00:01:35.850> what

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
poly on the mesh in oxy and that's what

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.060 
poly on the mesh in oxy and that's what
the<00:01:36.030> pinch<00:01:36.240> brush<00:01:36.360> is<00:01:36.630> supposed<00:01:36.840> to<00:01:36.990> do<00:01:37.140> but<00:01:38.009> a

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
the pinch brush is supposed to do but a

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.730 
the pinch brush is supposed to do but a
great<00:01:38.490> little<00:01:38.700> trick<00:01:39.000> that<00:01:39.360> we<00:01:39.390> have<00:01:39.810> within

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
great little trick that we have within

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.590 
great little trick that we have within
your<00:01:41.130> geometry<00:01:41.460> palette<00:01:42.119> that<00:01:42.270> people<00:01:42.540> are

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
your geometry palette that people are

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.139 
your geometry palette that people are
not<00:01:42.720> using<00:01:42.960> is<00:01:43.320> if<00:01:43.799> you<00:01:43.920> drop<00:01:44.130> down<00:01:44.369> a<00:01:44.759> couple

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
not using is if you drop down a couple

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.600 
not using is if you drop down a couple
subdivision<00:01:46.020> levels<00:01:46.380> and<00:01:46.979> then<00:01:47.070> you<00:01:47.159> go<00:01:47.310> ahead

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
subdivision levels and then you go ahead

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:52.030 
subdivision levels and then you go ahead
and<00:01:47.729> you<00:01:47.820> smooth<00:01:48.180> out<00:01:48.799> this<00:01:49.799> mesh<00:01:50.640> along<00:01:51.540> here

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 
and you smooth out this mesh along here

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.560 
and you smooth out this mesh along here
so<00:01:53.040> I<00:01:53.070> really<00:01:53.369> quickly<00:01:53.790> let<00:01:53.939> me<00:01:53.970> just<00:01:54.210> smooth

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
so I really quickly let me just smooth

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.170 
so I really quickly let me just smooth
this<00:01:54.780> out<00:01:55.079> a<00:01:55.140> little<00:01:55.500> bit<00:01:55.860> and<00:01:56.430> let's<00:01:56.850> spin

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
this out a little bit and let's spin

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.560 
this out a little bit and let's spin
that<00:01:57.360> be<00:01:57.630> stroke<00:01:58.110> set<00:01:58.680> in<00:01:58.829> here<00:01:59.180> The<00:02:00.180> Strokes

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
that be stroke set in here The Strokes

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.370 
that be stroke set in here The Strokes
in<00:02:00.780> here<00:02:01.549> and<00:02:02.549> strokes<00:02:02.909> in<00:02:03.149> here<00:02:03.479> so<00:02:04.079> I've<00:02:04.200> lost

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
in here and strokes in here so I've lost

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.350 
in here and strokes in here so I've lost
a<00:02:04.500> lot<00:02:04.649> of<00:02:04.680> that<00:02:04.829> detail<00:02:05.040> right<00:02:05.939> but<00:02:06.180> what<00:02:06.329> I

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
a lot of that detail right but what I

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.960 
a lot of that detail right but what I
can<00:02:06.689> do<00:02:06.899> is<00:02:07.110> if<00:02:07.290> I<00:02:07.409> hit<00:02:07.590> the<00:02:07.740> reproject<00:02:08.489> higher

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:08.970 
can do is if I hit the reproject higher

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.790 
can do is if I hit the reproject higher
subdivision<00:02:09.509> level<00:02:11.090> ZBrush<00:02:12.090> is<00:02:12.330> now

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
subdivision level ZBrush is now

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.150 
subdivision level ZBrush is now
and<00:02:12.860> take<00:02:13.100> what<00:02:14.060> was<00:02:14.210> on<00:02:14.330> level<00:02:14.690> four<00:02:14.960> and<00:02:15.410> it's

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:16.160 
and take what was on level four and it's

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.280 
and take what was on level four and it's
going<00:02:16.310> to<00:02:16.370> project<00:02:16.550> that<00:02:17.000> into<00:02:17.420> another<00:02:17.630> new

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
going to project that into another new

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.560 
going to project that into another new
level<00:02:18.650> four<00:02:18.920> and<00:02:19.280> as<00:02:19.790> you<00:02:19.880> see<00:02:20.060> I'm<00:02:20.210> back<00:02:20.420> on

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
level four and as you see I'm back on

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.270 
level four and as you see I'm back on
cell<00:02:20.810> division<00:02:21.110> level<00:02:21.230> four<00:02:21.620> with<00:02:22.010> that

detail of my pinches in that hole with
the<00:02:26.060> pinch<00:02:26.540> being<00:02:26.870> used<00:02:27.170> with<00:02:27.620> a<00:02:27.680> little

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
the pinch being used with a little

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.920 
the pinch being used with a little
crevice<00:02:28.160> but<00:02:28.340> if<00:02:28.430> I<00:02:28.520> turn<00:02:28.730> on<00:02:28.790> my<00:02:28.850> frame<00:02:29.270> as<00:02:29.810> you

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:29.930 
crevice but if I turn on my frame as you

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.590 
crevice but if I turn on my frame as you
can<00:02:30.020> see<00:02:30.170> my<00:02:30.350> de<00:02:30.410> Paula<00:02:30.710> G<00:02:30.890> now<00:02:31.070> have<00:02:31.910> a<00:02:32.270> lot

might want to add in here that I was not
