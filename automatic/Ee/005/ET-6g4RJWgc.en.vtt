00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
exit unit are like automatically built

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:31.339 
exit unit are like automatically built
in<00:02:27.420> so<00:02:27.930> yeah<00:02:29.659> thought<00:02:30.659> maybe<00:02:30.810> this<00:02:31.079> would<00:02:31.290> help

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
in so yeah thought maybe this would help

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:34.009 
in so yeah thought maybe this would help
me<00:02:31.650> keep<00:02:32.010> some<00:02:32.280> motivation<00:02:33.090> and<00:02:33.209> interest<00:02:33.359> so

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
me keep some motivation and interest so

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:39.339 
me keep some motivation and interest so
let's<00:02:34.859> do<00:02:35.099> the<00:02:35.219> intro<00:02:35.609> level<00:02:35.879> all<00:02:36.420> right<00:02:36.810> ah

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:39.349 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:41.750 

yeah<00:02:40.349> these<00:02:40.530> things<00:02:40.769> take<00:02:40.919> a<00:02:40.980> few<00:02:41.219> hits<00:02:41.459> now

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
yeah these things take a few hits now

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.039 
yeah these things take a few hits now
they<00:02:41.939> have<00:02:42.090> two<00:02:42.239> different<00:02:42.419> kinds<00:02:42.659> of<00:02:42.840> attacks

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:43.049 
they have two different kinds of attacks

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:45.709 
they have two different kinds of attacks
but<00:02:43.349> they're<00:02:43.560> not<00:02:43.889> too<00:02:44.129> hard<00:02:44.370> nothing<00:02:45.269> in<00:02:45.540> this

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:45.719 
but they're not too hard nothing in this

00:02:45.719 --> 00:02:47.509 
but they're not too hard nothing in this
intros<00:02:46.169> level<00:02:46.500> should<00:02:46.680> be<00:02:46.739> too<00:02:47.189> terribly

00:02:47.509 --> 00:02:47.519 
intros level should be too terribly

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:49.939 
intros level should be too terribly
difficult<00:02:47.900> but<00:02:48.900> yeah<00:02:49.019> i'm<00:02:49.260> figuring<00:02:49.439> x<00:02:49.799> is

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:49.949 
difficult but yeah i'm figuring x is

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:51.319 
difficult but yeah i'm figuring x is
like<00:02:50.099> some<00:02:50.310> kind<00:02:50.519> of<00:02:50.549> a<00:02:50.639> rookie<00:02:50.819> or<00:02:51.060> whatever

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.329 
like some kind of a rookie or whatever

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:53.420 
like some kind of a rookie or whatever
and<00:02:51.719> this<00:02:51.930> is<00:02:52.079> like<00:02:52.260> it's<00:02:52.530> very<00:02:52.709> first<00:02:53.159> x

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:53.430 
and this is like it's very first x

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.640 
and this is like it's very first x
hunter<00:02:53.819> mission<00:02:54.180> or<00:02:54.389> something<00:02:54.840> or<00:02:55.349> maybe

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
hunter mission or something or maybe

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.390 
hunter mission or something or maybe
he's<00:02:56.519> just<00:02:56.609> like<00:02:56.879> a<00:02:56.909> standard<00:02:57.889> cop<00:02:58.889> and<00:02:59.219> gets

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 
he's just like a standard cop and gets

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.699 
he's just like a standard cop and gets
promoted<00:02:59.639> after<00:03:00.090> this<00:03:00.419> or<00:03:00.719> so<00:03:01.019> i<00:03:01.049> don't<00:03:01.349> know<00:03:01.439> I

the ability to climb walls you can stick

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:37.699 
the ability to climb walls you can stick
to<00:03:36.479> a<00:03:36.509> wall<00:03:36.750> for<00:03:36.989> a<00:03:37.049> minute<00:03:37.290> and<00:03:37.379> you'll<00:03:37.500> start

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
to a wall for a minute and you'll start

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.469 
to a wall for a minute and you'll start
sliding<00:03:37.979> down<00:03:38.250> but<00:03:38.519> they<00:03:38.609> just<00:03:38.939> jump<00:03:39.150> back<00:03:39.180> off

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:39.479 
sliding down but they just jump back off

sliding down but they just jump back off
and<00:03:39.750> yeah<00:03:40.590> that's<00:03:41.189> really<00:03:41.759> cool<00:03:42.349> now<00:03:43.349> all<00:03:43.979> in

00:03:44.179 --> 00:03:44.189 
and yeah that's really cool now all in

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:45.469 
and yeah that's really cool now all in
all<00:03:44.310> I<00:03:44.340> kind<00:03:44.699> of<00:03:44.759> thought<00:03:44.939> this<00:03:45.090> game<00:03:45.269> was<00:03:45.419> a

00:03:45.469 --> 00:03:45.479 
all I kind of thought this game was a

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:46.939 
all I kind of thought this game was a
bit<00:03:45.689> easier<00:03:46.049> and<00:03:46.199> so<00:03:46.319> on<00:03:46.409> the<00:03:46.470> later<00:03:46.650> Mega

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:46.949 
bit easier and so on the later Mega

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:49.339 
bit easier and so on the later Mega
Man's<00:03:47.239> and<00:03:48.239> I<00:03:48.540> don't<00:03:48.750> think<00:03:49.109> it<00:03:49.290> was

00:03:49.339 --> 00:03:49.349 
Man's and I don't think it was

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:50.960 
Man's and I don't think it was
intentionally<00:03:49.919> made<00:03:50.099> that<00:03:50.280> way<00:03:50.430> I<00:03:50.669> think

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:50.970 
intentionally made that way I think

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:52.999 
intentionally made that way I think
Capcom<00:03:51.389> just<00:03:51.659> severely<00:03:52.019> underestimated<00:03:52.799> how

00:03:52.999 --> 00:03:53.009 
Capcom just severely underestimated how

00:03:53.009 --> 00:03:57.619 
Capcom just severely underestimated how
powerful<00:03:53.519> X<00:03:53.699> really<00:03:54.000> is<00:03:55.969> which<00:03:56.969> they<00:03:57.419> quickly

00:03:57.619 --> 00:03:57.629 
powerful X really is which they quickly

00:03:57.629 --> 00:03:59.209 
powerful X really is which they quickly
correct<00:03:58.139> that<00:03:58.290> in<00:03:58.439> the<00:03:58.530> later<00:03:58.709> games<00:03:59.009> they

00:03:59.209 --> 00:03:59.219 
correct that in the later games they

00:03:59.219 --> 00:04:01.189 
correct that in the later games they
start<00:03:59.430> to<00:03:59.519> get<00:03:59.669> really<00:03:59.879> hard<00:04:00.209> but<00:04:00.569> yeah<00:04:01.049> this

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:01.199 
start to get really hard but yeah this

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:03.110 
start to get really hard but yeah this
is<00:04:01.349> probably<00:04:01.859> one<00:04:02.099> of<00:04:02.129> the<00:04:02.250> easier<00:04:02.609> Mega<00:04:02.849> Man's

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
is probably one of the easier Mega Man's

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.719 
is probably one of the easier Mega Man's
I<00:04:03.299> think<00:04:03.769> maybe<00:04:04.769> it's<00:04:04.919> just<00:04:05.009> because<00:04:05.219> I<00:04:05.400> played

00:04:05.719 --> 00:04:05.729 
I think maybe it's just because I played

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:07.459 
I think maybe it's just because I played
it<00:04:05.849> like<00:04:06.000> over<00:04:06.239> 100<00:04:06.389> times<00:04:06.780> in<00:04:07.049> the<00:04:07.139> course<00:04:07.290> of

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:07.469 
it like over 100 times in the course of

00:04:07.469 --> 00:04:08.260 
it like over 100 times in the course of
my<00:04:07.590> life

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:08.270 
my life

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:10.900 
my life
I<00:04:08.410> just<00:04:09.410> love<00:04:09.590> this<00:04:09.740> game<00:04:09.950> while<00:04:10.160> it's<00:04:10.340> younger

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 
I just love this game while it's younger
