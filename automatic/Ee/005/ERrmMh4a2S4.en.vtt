I got a lot of my clothes but there's a
few<00:00:50.740> other<00:00:50.890> techniques<00:00:51.160> and<00:00:51.610> I've<00:00:51.730> used<00:00:51.970> in

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.120 
few other techniques and I've used in

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.780 
few other techniques and I've used in
the<00:00:52.180> past<00:00:52.210> to<00:00:53.170> be<00:00:53.200> able<00:00:53.380> to<00:00:53.530> acquire<00:00:54.460> large

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:54.790 
the past to be able to acquire large

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:57.630 
the past to be able to acquire large
amounts<00:00:55.239> of<00:00:55.300> clothing<00:00:55.780> at<00:00:55.960> a<00:00:55.989> discount<00:00:56.739> so<00:00:57.070> one

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:57.640 
amounts of clothing at a discount so one

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:58.920 
amounts of clothing at a discount so one
of<00:00:57.760> these<00:00:57.850> are<00:00:57.970> gonna<00:00:58.120> actually<00:00:58.270> have<00:00:58.600> to<00:00:58.630> do

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:58.930 
of these are gonna actually have to do

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:00.180 
of these are gonna actually have to do
one<00:00:59.170> of<00:00:59.200> these<00:00:59.350> three<00:00:59.590> techniques<00:00:59.770> is

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
one of these three techniques is

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:01.950 
one of these three techniques is
actually<00:01:00.489> gonna<00:01:00.610> have<00:01:00.760> to<00:01:00.850> do<00:01:00.970> with<00:01:01.120> a<00:01:01.270> thrift

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:01.960 
actually gonna have to do with a thrift

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.420 
actually gonna have to do with a thrift
store<00:01:01.989> but<00:01:02.290> it's<00:01:02.380> a<00:01:02.440> little<00:01:02.560> more<00:01:02.770> specific

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.430 
store but it's a little more specific

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.160 
store but it's a little more specific
but<00:01:03.610> with<00:01:04.059> that<00:01:04.180> being<00:01:04.360> said<00:01:04.479> an<00:01:04.809> out<00:01:04.930> of<00:01:05.050> the

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
but with that being said an out of the

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:06.600 
but with that being said an out of the
way<00:01:05.320> I'll<00:01:05.590> let's<00:01:05.800> dive<00:01:05.950> into<00:01:06.100> this<00:01:06.250> video<00:01:06.460> and

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.610 
way I'll let's dive into this video and

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.149 
way I'll let's dive into this video and
get<00:01:06.940> into<00:01:07.150> these<00:01:07.300> three<00:01:07.920> techniques<00:01:08.920> for

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:09.159 
get into these three techniques for

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:10.680 
get into these three techniques for
acquiring<00:01:09.670> large<00:01:09.850> amounts<00:01:10.210> of<00:01:10.270> clothing<00:01:10.510> to

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:10.690 
acquiring large amounts of clothing to

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:13.110 
acquiring large amounts of clothing to
resell<00:01:11.140> for<00:01:11.350> a<00:01:11.380> profit<00:01:11.890> so<00:01:12.430> the<00:01:12.550> first<00:01:12.820> way

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:13.120 
resell for a profit so the first way

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:14.670 
resell for a profit so the first way
that<00:01:13.150> I<00:01:13.450> haven't<00:01:13.870> heard<00:01:13.990> a<00:01:14.080> lot<00:01:14.229> of<00:01:14.260> people

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:14.680 
that I haven't heard a lot of people

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.100 
that I haven't heard a lot of people
talk<00:01:15.370> about<00:01:15.580> is<00:01:15.909> by<00:01:16.090> actually<00:01:16.510> going<00:01:16.720> to

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.110 
talk about is by actually going to

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:19.920
