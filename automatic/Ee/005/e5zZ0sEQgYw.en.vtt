 Take a look at the box that shows the 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.490

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.490
 installation right 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.730
 Ok, let's open the box. 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.970
 right in front of you that we find the 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.970
 glasses already well packed 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:03.250
 Let's go, let's get it out of here . 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.250
 then we give it a better look 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:14.080

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.080
 have the cables and manuals 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:30.770
 the rubbers here are to protect from 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.670
 external light so as not to disturb the 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.670
 screen display 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.520
 these two that are at the top of the 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.189
 glasses 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:49.179
 and the one that is greater in the part of 

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:49.179
 low also supports over nose 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:59.009
 here we have instruction manuals 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:02.520
 the instruction manual 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:07.079
 a quick guide 

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:15.730
 in technical assistance papers 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:28.200

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.200

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:40.740
 just in front is the entrance of the glasses 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:05.350
 on the rear power input a 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.350
 hdmi input an hdmi output 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:24.920
 Let's have a look at the glasses. 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:24.920
 now it is very light 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:40.390
 in front of the bracket on 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:43.290
 your forehead is behind you will stay on top of the 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.290
 head and neck 

00:03:55.849 --> 00:04:00.900
 here in the pack of times 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:03.470
 this fabric that is to put in the support 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.470
 of the forehead 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:16.310
 which gives a better organized here 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:16.310
 local glasses there 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:23.270
 we can continue to see the things that 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:27.530
 have is that here is the glasses connector 

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:27.530
 that will fit right here in the front 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:41.910
 What do we have rubber support? 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.100
 that goes under the glasses on the 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:49.050

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:55.290
 and which is pressed against the forehead and 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:05:00.740
 Here we have the headset when 

00:04:55.290 --> 00:05:00.740
 pretty ear for sign 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:10.280

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.770
 stereo nÃ© 

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:42.030
 here we have the good chances that 

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:45.170
 fits into the headset depending on the 

00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:45.170
 ear size 

00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:00.030

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:16.070
 What do we have? 

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:16.070
 the hdmi cable and an ordinary hdmi cable 

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:29.620

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:34.750

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:43.780

00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:00.890

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:10.720
 that's it 

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:19.200
 It's a great investment, if you can. 

00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:19.200
