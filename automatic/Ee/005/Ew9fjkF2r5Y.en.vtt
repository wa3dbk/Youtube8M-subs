00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:19.800
 taking this sample to come out of 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:22.730
 this form was woven with 20 points 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:26.060
 bad two edge points 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:29.449
 the edge point always passes the 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:31.760
 first and the last one is done at a point 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:34.700
 straight 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.650
 this point is very beautiful is different to 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.960
 all and has the great advantage by 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:41.690
 example if they make it for a skirt that 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.880
 it comes out on both sides then you 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.430
 they admire it for the right or they put it 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:48.500
 the reverse is always going to have the same 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:52.240
 advantage and that is going to leave all 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:56.350
 those vanilla point thefts 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:01:00.730
 after having assembled the 22 points 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:03.100
 I made two lines in right point one by 

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:05.740
 the right one and the other way around 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.080
 woven in a right point already 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.840
 then start stitch that is 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.910
 those two lines are these two that already 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.650
 I have here ready to start the 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:18.210
 stitch 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:22.690
 the first point was spent the second 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:27.690
 I introduce the needle and I make 2 loops of 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:27.690
 left to right next point 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.870
 3 loops 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:37.950
 once again four fairies 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:42.680
 and remember that since this is a diamond 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.900
 so what we are doing is that 

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.930
 do you think that the diamond is now going to bail 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:50.560
 the rhombus then the next 3 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.560
 loops 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:02:02.950
 then 2 loops of 12 and I have them 

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:05.590
 needle then I make 5 points at a point 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.350
 right 2 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.390
 3 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.380
 4 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.380
 and 5 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:19.940
 and I go back and do exactly the same thing 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:22.030
 I did at the beginning at one point I do 2 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:26.330
 loops 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:31.480
 at one point I make 3 loops 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:31.480
 in another point 4 loops 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:37.540
 in the next one I return and I do 3 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:44.840
 and in the next and last I do two and I 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:47.010
 the five points must remain 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:50.700
 required 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:54.209
 so that the stitch is symmetrical and 

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:56.730
 very pretty at the right point and as 

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:59.280
 we said the last point always goes in a 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.530
 point of happiness we go to the race 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:05.180
 let's say the other way around but I already told you that 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.180
 the stitch comes out on both sides 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:15.600
 the first point I pass 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:19.459
 then I leave you the 5 that already 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.459
 We knew we had done 2 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:26.370
 4 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:28.410
 and 5 and then yew in right point and 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:32.190
 I'm releasing the loops I'm going this 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:34.160
 full I leave it as well as tight and 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:38.620
 loose 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:42.590
 I leave you in a right and loose point 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:46.020
 I leave you in a loose right spot 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:48.900
 everything as it goes out see 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:53.010
 loose and here I found myself again 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:56.760
 with the five points in right point 

00:03:53.010 --> 00:04:01.580
 that we had made between a diamond and the 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.580
 another here I have them again one 

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.400
 two 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:08.069
 3 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:14.240
 4 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:18.320
 5 and the edge point 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:21.590
 for the next race we're going to 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:25.730
 do the whole row the whole race in 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:28.220
 a right point I have to do both 

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:31.010
 lines in right point to be able to do 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:33.920
 again my design and I already made one and 

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:36.640
 now I'm going to do the following the 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:41.120
 first time we started with the 

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:44.030
 the loops do not feel now we change and 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:48.730
 we went through the first one and started with the 

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:48.730
 five points in right point 3 

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:56.769
 45 points in right point and then 

00:04:52.429 --> 00:04:56.769
 we started 2 loops 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:00.349
 3 loops 

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:07.200
 and 4 loops 

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:07.200
 and then 3 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:15.340
 after 2 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:18.509
 the five points to the right that separate 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.509
 one reason for another 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:26.249
 and again we make our loops 

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:30.449
 as we know how to do it 

00:05:26.249 --> 00:05:32.989
 2 loops we start with two we continue 

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:32.989
 with 3 

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:40.650
 we continue with 4 and we start 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:43.430
 return us in 3 

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.430
 and in 2 

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:47.240
 and the point of voices 

00:05:48.569 --> 00:05:52.000
 we turn the fabric look how it is 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:55.600
 staying 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:59.160
 with we flipped the fabric and we continue 

00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:01.910
 we passed the edge point we weave 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:05.180
 let's go 

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:10.570
 a right and let loose a right 

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:14.510
 let's loose a right let's go right 

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:17.110
 let's drop the five points that unite the 

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:17.110
 grounds 

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:24.350
 here we have again 

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:27.340
 a right 

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:27.340
 and let's go 

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:35.740
 a right we release the loops 

00:06:32.139 --> 00:06:38.860
 a right let loose the loops of a 

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:41.999
 right and let's go and finish with the 

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:45.870
 5 points 

00:06:41.999 --> 00:06:45.870
 needed then 

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:51.010
 first we do the 5 points and then the 

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:54.250
 loops then we do the loops and 

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:56.650
 then the 5 points as well first 

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:59.620
 we made the loops here and then we did 

00:06:56.650 --> 00:07:02.950
 the 5 points because the tip the stitch 

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:05.200
 goes alternating see once goes here and another 

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:07.510
 time I here and between those go the others 

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:10.540
 two these are the two races 

00:07:07.510 --> 00:07:13.570
 necessary between one reason and the other 

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:16.870
 you have to make the lines at the point 

00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:19.870
 right two lines one by the front and 

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:22.090
 another for the reverse of the fabric always the 

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:24.760
 have to do so that the stitch 

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:27.190
 come out that's part of the stitch 

00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:30.660
 we tremble a little we are tempering 

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:30.660
 so that it looks pretty 

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:35.500
 the vanilla point
