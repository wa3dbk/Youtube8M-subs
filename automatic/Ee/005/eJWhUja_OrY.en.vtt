00:00:04.839 --> 00:00:11.110
 here is a diagram of my rocket furnace alan co2 

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:25.570
 set your rocket stove in its place 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:28.269
 workers connected to the main chimney 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:32.509
 so today we will experience 

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:33.940
 big tunnel fuel quality will 

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:37.299
 firewood 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:40.850
 Means I added stoves 

00:00:37.299 --> 00:00:45.080
 added casing made with old 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:50.650
 washing machine start lower bottom 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:50.650
 transition to the knee warmed 

00:00:50.949 --> 00:01:04.930
 perlite pipe also means the knee itself 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:07.719
 insulated with mineral wool and pipe 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:12.469
 built-up is also insulated with mineral 

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:14.259
 cotton and 4 chimney put on five 

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:17.270
 inch pipe 

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:22.429
 it means we have such a height 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:26.810
 pipes so fuel quality will be 

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:28.729
 use today trimming branches and for 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:35.200
 most reason pine 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:39.979
 wood chips laid exactly a kilogram 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:44.409
 let's see how much it will burn 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:44.409
 the stove went into gorenje mode 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:54.170
 this hole is good i left with 

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:58.509
 the previous oven is also convenient for them 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:04.539
 use while burning wood 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:06.420
 enough air but not under the smoke 

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:11.880
 let's see how 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:23.540
 then you do not have 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:26.430
 smoke with sawdust gave better 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:48.920
 This already a thousand because volume draw 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:48.920
 little let's see through the speech 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:03:08.450
 raise began to close the brain mind balloon 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:13.910
 hot so well in winter of course on yourself 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:18.780
 will she be good at or not 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:24.769
 now happy let's see which one 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:28.820
 the smoke outside today is overcast warm 

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:33.930
 but the wind is the eldest 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:37.549
 Well there is still a stove smokes while not 

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.549
 went broke 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:54.019
 oven temperatures greater than 200 degrees 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:54.019
 in the first ball does not lie in the balloon 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:00.780
 more than 100 degrees 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:25.790
 the casing warmed up to 100 degrees here 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:25.790
 you can see how warm air flows 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:34.460
 Still, the cover can be seen a good thing 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:48.290
 hard to see but here's the beginning to burn 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:53.440
 paint on the second tank it means already 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:59.650
 warmed up well flies look inside 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:05:04.150
 Well through the hole you can see how the fire 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:09.700
 through the knee enters the second lapdog 

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:09.700
 playing along and paint and smoke went 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:22.780
 temperature on the lid 2 balon 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:43.010
 here is the paint burned now let's see 

00:05:49.760 --> 00:06:04.370
 bunker on the rocket stove or on the roof 

00:05:59.910 --> 00:06:04.370
 that's all up
