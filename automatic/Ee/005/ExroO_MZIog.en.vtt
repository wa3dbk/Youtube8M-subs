00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.000
 I think I do not find it anymore 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.790
 Arndt with the table 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.170
 of course told 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.080
 that we have to explain ourselves arm soon it is actually 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.330
 really easy 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.249
 then they test their knowledge 

00:00:43.249 --> 00:00:45.190
 The commission fee is 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:46.510
 as follows 

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.020
 this is it here 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.000
 that in the middle 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.030
 Dr Voigt abyss is about twice as wide as the finished Schriek banks 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.120
 should show 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.470
 in addition to the tax dispute 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:02.580
 SPAMfighter went three times 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.580
 so oblique guess band from SID 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.170
 and League go under the brand Grundig 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.700
 Reinhold I here now 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.930
 you can already see the previous inclination looks like 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.040
 the team spirit 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.730
 and will he play what 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.010
 after information 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.160
 a garden party 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.240
 I pull my thing through 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.240
 that's a matter of course 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.090
 I want her to do it 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.180
 and come out 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.180
 Rheinland-Pfalz stands 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.750
 Trichet stresses her 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.770
 the protests would 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.360
 Windows and what it may be adjusted from time to time maybe a bit 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:57.410
 all in all 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:59.240
 it is much harder 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.280
 that can be done 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.280
 the duel with a third 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.770
 each second half burned with 10 times the fingers 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:12.579
 the certificate no longer 

00:02:12.579 --> 00:02:15.819
 in Clausthal with the piece closer 

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:19.609
 being pulled in one piece does not pull too much weight because otherwise 

00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:21.499
 Somebody up too much 

00:02:21.499 --> 00:02:22.710
 Munich 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.509
 prove in the first test 

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:28.509
 and again 

00:02:32.179 --> 00:02:35.179
 it is pitch dark really from all sides 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:38.649
 so that's the first part is already done 

00:02:38.649 --> 00:02:41.649
 that's what it looks like now 

00:02:42.469 --> 00:02:45.469
 I actually do this together 

00:02:46.419 --> 00:02:49.419
 Real Madrid was 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:03.129
 This results in the prices then again 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:05.689
 and you have that 

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:08.089
 wonderful 

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:11.089
 written 

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:25.879
 fantastic street band 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:28.079
 easy 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:31.079
 and so inexpensive 

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:34.629
 it could clarify 

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:37.359
 we understand bonding 

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:38.860
 the Monte Carlo 

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.589
 and it is already 

00:03:41.589 --> 00:03:42.439
 so is
