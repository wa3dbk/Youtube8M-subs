 gather she has a nice step of a 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.010
 great work capacity and that's 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.840

 national to separate for the future

 inconsistencies and his politicians calculations 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:30.350
 the scheme begins to sink into a 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.920
 chiraquisation that transpires in the 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.350
 choice of men 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.090
 the presidential style already seen but 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:37.610
 especially in the tragic absence of 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:39.470
