the<00:00:55.190> whole<00:00:55.429> entire<00:00:55.730> world<00:00:55.940> like<00:00:56.210> that's<00:00:56.420> a

00:00:56.529 --> 00:00:56.539 
the whole entire world like that's a

00:00:56.539 --> 00:00:58.299 
the whole entire world like that's a
great<00:00:56.659> feeling<00:00:57.019> you<00:00:57.079> say<00:00:57.289> that<00:00:57.469> you've<00:00:58.100> done

00:00:58.299 --> 00:00:58.309 
great feeling you say that you've done

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:01.029 
great feeling you say that you've done
that<00:00:58.370> at<00:00:58.940> least<00:00:59.149> once<00:00:59.479> I<00:00:59.920> don't<00:01:00.920> know<00:01:01.010> I

00:01:01.029 --> 00:01:01.039 
that at least once I don't know I

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:03.360 
that at least once I don't know I
wouldn't<00:01:01.460> say<00:01:01.519> it's<00:01:01.819> full<00:01:02.149> blown<00:01:02.600> momentum

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:03.370 
wouldn't say it's full blown momentum

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.860 
wouldn't say it's full blown momentum
but<00:01:04.370> it<00:01:04.430> I<00:01:04.729> don't<00:01:04.820> think<00:01:05.030> it<00:01:05.239> hurts<00:01:05.420> the<00:01:05.570> fact

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:05.870 
but it I don't think it hurts the fact

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:07.510 
but it I don't think it hurts the fact
that<00:01:06.020> I've<00:01:06.140> just<00:01:06.380> came<00:01:06.590> off<00:01:06.800> two<00:01:07.040> wins<00:01:07.250> you

the course enough on paper and thought
of<00:01:56.240> certain<00:01:56.539> things<00:01:56.689> that<00:01:56.750> I<00:01:56.869> could

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
of certain things that I could

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.169 
of certain things that I could
potentially<00:01:57.229> do<00:01:57.619> but<00:01:57.829> some<00:01:58.039> a<00:01:58.310> lot<00:01:58.640> of<00:01:58.700> times<00:01:59.000> I

00:01:59.169 --> 00:01:59.179 
potentially do but some a lot of times I

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:03.569 
potentially do but some a lot of times I
know<00:01:59.240> that<00:01:59.659> the<00:02:00.259> drawing<00:02:00.590> and<00:02:01.090> the<00:02:02.090> real<00:02:02.270> thing

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:03.579 
know that the drawing and the real thing

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:06.099 
know that the drawing and the real thing
you<00:02:04.579> can't<00:02:04.850> tell<00:02:05.090> the<00:02:05.179> size<00:02:05.420> and<00:02:05.630> dimensions

00:02:06.099 --> 00:02:06.109 
you can't tell the size and dimensions

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:07.539 
you can't tell the size and dimensions
always<00:02:06.409> of<00:02:06.530> something<00:02:06.859> through<00:02:07.009> a<00:02:07.039> drawing<00:02:07.340> so

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:07.549 
always of something through a drawing so

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:09.130 
always of something through a drawing so
it<00:02:07.579> might<00:02:07.969> be<00:02:08.030> a<00:02:08.179> little<00:02:08.300> bigger<00:02:08.570> than<00:02:08.720> you<00:02:08.990> may

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
it might be a little bigger than you may

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:10.600 
it might be a little bigger than you may
have<00:02:09.170> pictured<00:02:09.710> in<00:02:09.770> your<00:02:09.800> mind<00:02:10.039> or<00:02:10.220> smaller<00:02:10.460> or

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
have pictured in your mind or smaller or

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.570 
have pictured in your mind or smaller or
whatever<00:02:10.880> so<00:02:11.570> I<00:02:11.870> go<00:02:12.770> there<00:02:12.950> and<00:02:13.070> first<00:02:13.280> like

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
whatever so I go there and first like

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.040 
whatever so I go there and first like
just<00:02:13.819> look<00:02:13.970> at<00:02:14.120> you<00:02:14.360> know<00:02:14.450> things<00:02:14.780> that<00:02:14.870> I've

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:15.050 
just look at you know things that I've

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:16.690 
just look at you know things that I've
thought<00:02:15.349> of<00:02:15.530> doing<00:02:15.560> tricks<00:02:16.129> on<00:02:16.310> already<00:02:16.550> and

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
thought of doing tricks on already and

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.080 
thought of doing tricks on already and
just<00:02:16.849> like<00:02:17.180> sizing<00:02:17.629> them<00:02:17.690> up

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
just like sizing them up

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.110 
just like sizing them up
if<00:02:18.269> it's<00:02:19.170> something<00:02:19.379> that's<00:02:19.650> not<00:02:20.550> too<00:02:20.760> big<00:02:20.940> or

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
if it's something that's not too big or

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.000 
if it's something that's not too big or
whatever<00:02:21.420> for<00:02:21.720> the<00:02:21.840> situation<00:02:22.050> for<00:02:22.709> the<00:02:22.769> trip

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
whatever for the situation for the trip

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.220 
whatever for the situation for the trip
and<00:02:23.760> then<00:02:24.209> after<00:02:24.450> that<00:02:24.569> yeah<00:02:24.750> I<00:02:24.780> just<00:02:24.900> skate

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
and then after that yeah I just skate

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.860 
and then after that yeah I just skate
around<00:02:25.349> feel<00:02:25.980> out<00:02:26.160> every<00:02:26.370> obstacle<00:02:26.690> just<00:02:27.690> try

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
around feel out every obstacle just try

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.210 
around feel out every obstacle just try
and<00:02:27.989> plant<00:02:28.170> a<00:02:28.230> line<00:02:28.440> this<00:02:28.650> first<00:02:28.950> thing<00:02:29.099> they

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
and plant a line this first thing they

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.199 
and plant a line this first thing they
try<00:02:29.370> to<00:02:29.400> do<00:02:29.550> is<00:02:29.700> figure<00:02:30.180> out<00:02:30.360> how<00:02:30.540> to<00:02:30.599> do<00:02:30.780> a<00:02:30.810> line

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
try to do is figure out how to do a line

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:36.289 
try to do is figure out how to do a line
and<00:02:33.209> then<00:02:33.950> work<00:02:34.950> at<00:02:35.129> it<00:02:35.280> we're<00:02:35.730> gonna<00:02:35.879> plow<00:02:36.120> you

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
the potential win you know so there's

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.550 
the potential win you know so there's
always<00:02:49.860> that<00:02:50.959> ongoing<00:02:51.959> pressure<00:02:52.230> you<00:02:52.470> know

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
always that ongoing pressure you know

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.009 
always that ongoing pressure you know
you<00:02:52.650> don't<00:02:52.769> want<00:02:52.950> to<00:02:53.060> you<00:02:54.060> know<00:02:54.120> so<00:02:54.480> that's

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
you don't want to you know so that's

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:56.449 
you don't want to you know so that's
just<00:02:55.200> so<00:02:55.349> I<00:02:55.380> look<00:02:55.680> at<00:02:55.829> it<00:02:55.950> like<00:02:56.069> that<00:02:56.099> I<00:02:56.310> don't

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
just so I look at it like that I don't

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.339 
just so I look at it like that I don't
look<00:02:56.610> at<00:02:56.760> any<00:02:56.910> specific<00:02:57.150> situation<00:02:58.019> like<00:02:58.140> more

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:58.349 
look at any specific situation like more

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:02.000 
look at any specific situation like more
pressure<00:02:58.650> than<00:02:58.860> other<00:02:59.069> I<00:02:59.459> just<00:03:00.349> you<00:03:01.349> know<00:03:01.380> it's

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
pressure than other I just you know it's

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.330 
pressure than other I just you know it's
it's<00:03:02.340> a<00:03:02.430> high<00:03:02.549> pressure<00:03:03.590> competition<00:03:04.590> all

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
it's a high pressure competition all

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.600 
it's a high pressure competition all
around<00:03:06.200> you<00:03:07.200> can't<00:03:07.440> find<00:03:07.650> any<00:03:07.829> higher<00:03:08.069> caliber

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:08.610 
around you can't find any higher caliber

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:11.539 
around you can't find any higher caliber
anywhere<00:03:09.379> and<00:03:10.379> then<00:03:10.650> that<00:03:10.829> line<00:03:11.069> up<00:03:11.250> you<00:03:11.430> know

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:11.549 
anywhere and then that line up you know

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:15.080 
anywhere and then that line up you know
so<00:03:11.849> it's<00:03:12.030> just<00:03:12.090> a<00:03:13.220> huge<00:03:14.220> honor<00:03:14.459> to<00:03:14.610> think<00:03:14.970> that
