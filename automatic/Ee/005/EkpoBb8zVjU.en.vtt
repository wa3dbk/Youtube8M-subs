00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 Mai together that will be one 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:06.240
 adoption video as in the title 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.150
 I can say goodbye and I say goodbye 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.670
 me in the sense that in the future one 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.410
 use other channel names 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.389
 yes, here you know already is mine 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.210
 actually branding for a long time 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.710
 in gÃ¶rlitz and my youtube name is 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.910
 songs like and now it goes into the 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.070
 change I decided only 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.289
 still to use by lift because it 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.240
 says simply more about my channel 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.619
 as this song you certainly have 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.109
 already seen that my homepage 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.860
 to get a point means that josef 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:36.660
 instagram both used and libby 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.129
 that I'll keep that up in the future 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.290
 twitter and so on 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.780
 and yes, what does actually mean every year 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.350
 So actually started back then 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.879
 to blog and to rotate youtube videos 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.440
 That was very important to me 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:50.520
 to teach or to 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.199
 convey what it actually means 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.780
 eat healthy 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.610
 how to do it better and how 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.350
 for example unhealthy habits 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.390
 can throw overboard 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.370
 Just ask consumers to clarify because 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.559
 yes, many consumer illusions media 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.450
 is worked and we quite often 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.030
 to be fooled and that's just what I wanted 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:12.080
 not and my motto or the branding 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:15.090
 military aid simply means that one is 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.710
 So take care of that and care 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.330
 after that, just live but you can 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.869
 of course , a little bit, too 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:25.380
 interpret differently that the eatc 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:28.650
 just went so well the well-being 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.600
 health the psyche and just like that 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.130
 be there as a healthy person like that 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:35.640
 I want to do that 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:38.250
 quite loosely and understandably formulate 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.470
 The device is not something that is now 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.210
 but it has a clear meaning 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.680
 At the time I thought so about 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.390
 and I found the name just great and 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.460
 I think he just fits well and 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.259
 therefore away from the life what now too 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.689
 completely new is any channel trailer 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.460
 you can have a look here 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.140
 if you want to load the I invite 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.549
 now also extra time 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.720
 surely many would like to know 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.020
 why I like songs at all 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:03.509
 I also like to say 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:08.009
 it is abbreviated from my name by 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:10.500
 enter how to write with the y on 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.970
 english and how come from bee and that 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.310
 comes easy, even if now 

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.830
 laugh my mom has earlier 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.390
 Munich said to me and with the offer 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:20.280
 school or just my 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.930
 high school class because I actually have it 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.250
 well, as well as all the plans called why too 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.500
 always maybe because of that 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.410
 my mom has always done it and 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:32.549
 then somehow I came quite spontaneously 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.930
 be totally creative on leader be and yes 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:38.250
 I just do not want these names anymore 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:42.359
 so have no idea strong 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:44.640
 Guys and I am not I hope 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:46.109
 switch on because again - pure and 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.940
 Do not hesitate to write me down what she does 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:50.040
 even if the guys text is holding up 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.350
 in the search bar 1 there are still 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.060
 also come to my videos and yes me 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.150
 I 'm glad if you continue to burn up 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.150
 soon
