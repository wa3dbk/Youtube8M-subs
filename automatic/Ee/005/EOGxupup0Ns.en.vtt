00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.210 
creamsicle outfit of the day video so
this<00:00:19.720> is<00:00:19.869> the<00:00:20.020> hair<00:00:20.320> that<00:00:20.529> I<00:00:20.590> was<00:00:20.800> wearing<00:00:21.100> in

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:21.220 
this is the hair that I was wearing in

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.300 
this is the hair that I was wearing in
that<00:00:21.369> video<00:00:21.550> and<00:00:22.380> this<00:00:23.380> hair<00:00:23.680> is<00:00:23.949> different

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:24.310 
that video and this hair is different

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.390 
that video and this hair is different
for<00:00:24.670> me<00:00:24.789> because<00:00:25.060> it's<00:00:25.720> shorter<00:00:26.320> and<00:00:26.590> it's

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:27.400 
for me because it's shorter and it's

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.359 
for me because it's shorter and it's
like<00:00:27.730> full<00:00:28.720> like<00:00:29.140> this<00:00:29.170> hair<00:00:29.710> is<00:00:29.949> really<00:00:30.279> curly

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:30.369 
like full like this hair is really curly

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:33.869 
like full like this hair is really curly
and<00:00:31.000> big<00:00:31.420> so<00:00:32.410> when<00:00:32.710> you<00:00:32.860> go<00:00:33.070> for<00:00:33.309> a<00:00:33.370> shorter

00:00:33.869 --> 00:00:33.879 
and big so when you go for a shorter

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:36.000 
and big so when you go for a shorter
length<00:00:34.210> what's<00:00:34.809> really<00:00:35.170> big<00:00:35.470> and<00:00:35.680> curly<00:00:35.980> hair

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:36.010 
length what's really big and curly hair

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:39.330 
length what's really big and curly hair
it<00:00:36.430> makes<00:00:36.579> it<00:00:36.790> like<00:00:36.850> even<00:00:37.329> bigger<00:00:38.020> I<00:00:38.380> feel<00:00:39.219> like

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:39.340 
it makes it like even bigger I feel like

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.520 
it makes it like even bigger I feel like
my<00:00:39.550> face<00:00:39.910> is<00:00:39.940> like<00:00:40.300> engulfed<00:00:40.870> in<00:00:41.050> this<00:00:41.230> thing

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.070 
supposed to be a permanent curl but I

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:11.940 
supposed to be a permanent curl but I
did<00:01:09.340> choose<00:01:09.640> this<00:01:09.939> length<00:01:10.390> nor<00:01:11.080> the<00:01:11.380> color<00:01:11.619> I

jet-black
I<00:01:31.900> just<00:01:32.200> don't<00:01:32.380> personally<00:01:32.979> like<00:01:33.040> jet-black

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.430 
I just don't personally like jet-black

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.580 
I just don't personally like jet-black
hair<00:01:33.670> and<00:01:33.970> then<00:01:34.060> too<00:01:34.600> I<00:01:34.630> don't<00:01:35.140> like<00:01:35.350> this

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
hair and then too I don't like this

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.219 
hair and then too I don't like this
length<00:01:35.979> I<00:01:36.310> feel<00:01:36.939> like<00:01:37.150> it's<00:01:37.450> like<00:01:38.079> an

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:38.229 
length I feel like it's like an

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:41.310 
length I feel like it's like an
in-between<00:01:38.610> it's<00:01:39.610> not<00:01:39.880> long<00:01:40.240> and<00:01:40.689> it's<00:01:41.110> not

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
in-between it's not long and it's not

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.740 
in-between it's not long and it's not
sure<00:01:41.740> I<00:01:42.009> think<00:01:42.310> what<00:01:42.670> this<00:01:42.850> hair<00:01:43.210> I<00:01:43.240> would<00:01:43.479> go

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
sure I think what this hair I would go

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.679 
sure I think what this hair I would go
shorter<00:01:44.259> to<00:01:45.159> mimic<00:01:45.549> a<00:01:45.729> more<00:01:45.970> natural<00:01:46.479> look

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:46.689 
shorter to mimic a more natural look

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:49.440 
shorter to mimic a more natural look
because<00:01:47.200> a<00:01:47.710> lot<00:01:48.159> of<00:01:48.310> natural<00:01:48.700> divas<00:01:49.119> have<00:01:49.390> a

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
because a lot of natural divas have a

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.380 
because a lot of natural divas have a
care<00:01:50.200> curl<00:01:50.619> pattern<00:01:50.979> like<00:01:51.159> this<00:01:51.189> and<00:01:51.790> I<00:01:52.329> think

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
care curl pattern like this and I think

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:54.929 
care curl pattern like this and I think
that<00:01:52.990> this<00:01:53.200> won't<00:01:53.380> look<00:01:53.649> a<00:01:53.770> lot<00:01:53.979> better<00:01:54.189> like

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:54.939 
that this won't look a lot better like

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:59.370 
that this won't look a lot better like
in<00:01:55.270> a<00:01:55.810> 14<00:01:56.380> or<00:01:56.950> 12<00:01:57.250> inch<00:01:57.610> or<00:01:58.119> really<00:01:58.869> long<00:01:59.079> if

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
in a 14 or 12 inch or really long if

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:00.990 
in a 14 or 12 inch or really long if
it's<00:01:59.530> really<00:01:59.799> along<00:02:00.070> the<00:02:00.369> curls<00:02:00.610> are<00:02:00.700> gonna<00:02:00.790> be

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000

reviewed<00:06:47.689> in<00:06:47.869> the<00:06:47.959> past<00:06:47.989> the<00:06:48.919> one<00:06:49.129> that<00:06:49.279> I<00:06:49.309> dyed

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:49.610 
reviewed in the past the one that I dyed

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:51.339 
reviewed in the past the one that I dyed
red<00:06:49.969> and<00:06:49.999> then<00:06:50.419> the<00:06:50.569> first<00:06:50.809> one<00:06:50.989> which<00:06:51.169> is<00:06:51.199> a

00:06:51.339 --> 00:06:51.349 
red and then the first one which is a

00:06:51.349 --> 00:06:53.709 
red and then the first one which is a
Chinese<00:06:51.799> rocky<00:06:52.129> this<00:06:52.819> one<00:06:53.059> is<00:06:53.239> not<00:06:53.449> my

00:06:53.709 --> 00:06:53.719 
Chinese rocky this one is not my

00:06:53.719 --> 00:06:56.919 
Chinese rocky this one is not my
favorite<00:06:54.229> though<00:06:55.419> maybe<00:06:56.419> in<00:06:56.659> a<00:06:56.749> different

00:06:56.919 --> 00:06:56.929 
favorite though maybe in a different

00:06:56.929 --> 00:06:58.989 
favorite though maybe in a different
color<00:06:57.379> in<00:06:57.709> a<00:06:57.799> different<00:06:58.189> length<00:06:58.399> I<00:06:58.669> would

00:06:58.989 --> 00:06:58.999 
color in a different length I would

00:06:58.999 --> 00:07:01.299 
color in a different length I would
change<00:06:59.209> my<00:06:59.479> mind<00:06:59.509> about<00:07:00.049> it<00:07:00.110> what<00:07:01.009> do<00:07:01.069> you<00:07:01.099> guys

00:07:01.299 --> 00:07:01.309 
change my mind about it what do you guys

00:07:01.309 --> 00:07:02.979 
change my mind about it what do you guys
think<00:07:01.369> about<00:07:01.699> it<00:07:01.969> do<00:07:02.089> you<00:07:02.209> all<00:07:02.269> agree<00:07:02.299> with<00:07:02.659> me

00:07:02.979 --> 00:07:02.989 
think about it do you all agree with me

00:07:02.989 --> 00:07:05.499 
think about it do you all agree with me
on<00:07:03.169> the<00:07:03.289> density<00:07:03.769> of<00:07:03.919> it<00:07:04.099> I<00:07:04.369> think<00:07:04.909> like<00:07:05.360> the

00:07:05.499 --> 00:07:05.509 
on the density of it I think like the

00:07:05.509 --> 00:07:08.139 
on the density of it I think like the
curl<00:07:05.749> pattern<00:07:06.110> is<00:07:06.229> so<00:07:06.589> beautiful<00:07:07.339> I<00:07:07.610> just<00:07:07.999> wish

00:07:08.139 --> 00:07:08.149 
curl pattern is so beautiful I just wish

00:07:08.149 --> 00:07:10.449 
curl pattern is so beautiful I just wish
the<00:07:08.389> density<00:07:08.899> was<00:07:09.110> a<00:07:09.169> little<00:07:09.559> bit<00:07:09.769> like<00:07:10.069> less

00:07:10.449 --> 00:07:10.459 
the density was a little bit like less

00:07:10.459 --> 00:07:13.329 
the density was a little bit like less
intense<00:07:11.059> you<00:07:11.299> know<00:07:11.329> so<00:07:12.259> that's<00:07:12.619> my<00:07:12.799> review<00:07:13.129> on
