 damaged torn or with 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.380
 blowholes littered floors can be one 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.329
 represent and are real danger of falling 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.419
 a nightmare for forklifts and 

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:26.849
 dolly bacco complex epoxy resin 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:29.460
 Mortar repairs easily and quickly 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.979
 Holes in concrete on which conventional 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.200
 products fail 

00:00:30.979 --> 00:00:37.260
 contrex is virtually indestructible and thus 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.120
 also suitable for heavy duty areas 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.970
 they only need one to get started 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.160
 wire brush a trowel a mixing pan 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.710
 or a mixed tray and gloves 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.030
 In addition, lay a slat and 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.030
 turpentine replacement ready 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:56.130
 the surface that you should work on 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.130
 clean dry and free from loose 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:01.350
 material to be 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:03.570
 use the either wabco bio the 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.499
 fatf as oil or grease stains on the 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.429
 soil are present 

00:01:06.499 --> 00:01:10.280
 usually they do not need any 

00:01:08.429 --> 00:01:12.630
 primer at repair or 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.969
 to carry out repair work 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.429
 but if you do repairs in a lot 

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:20.100
 thin layers of tricky steps 

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:22.319
 do not settle or smooth edges 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.509
 want to perform porous surfaces 

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:29.909
 we recommend you the use of 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:32.280
 vasco sticks for a simpler one 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.399
 people, the epoxy resin is already in the 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.899
 sand mixture included 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:39.179
 Give the sand resin mixture to the sand 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:42.990
 middle and form one in the middle 

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:45.450
 then put the bottles with you 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.909
 herta to empty the bottles 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.950
 completely 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.780
 mix the components with one 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.679
 trowel or even by hand like her one 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:58.310
 maintain smooth consistency 

00:01:54.679 --> 00:02:00.630
 Now you can apply it concretely 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:03.539
 You can get the required amount 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:06.060
 contrex repair mortar in the hole and 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:08.099
 press it while straightening that 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.299
 Product can be up to 50mm thick 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.340
 be applied 

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:13.560
 So do not worry if the hole in the 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.730
 middle is deeper she does not have to be in 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.099
 work shifts 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.500
 wipe the trowel with an intel 

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:21.709
 pentium replacement soaked rag off when 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.510
 The mortar starts to stick to it 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:26.430
 congrex can leak at edges 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.319
 be modeled so that they flatter 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.940
 expectant bodies of the hole in front of the 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:33.060
 Do not cut repairs properly 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.489
 congrex also needs to harden quickly 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.019
 out so that the repaired surfaces 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:40.799
 quickly put back into operation 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:43.980
 can be baku concrete slot for 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:45.120
 permanent granite repairs in the interior 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.730
 and outside area 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.250
 thanks to its exceptional chemical 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:53.069
 consistency, congrex is the ideal 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:56.959
 permanent solution for holes in the concrete at 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:56.959
 which conventional mortar fail 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:02.489
 There are concrete versions in many versions 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.769
 including quick- drying coal and 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:08.519
 deep filler for up to 100 millimeters 

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:11.130
 deep holes and then there are still 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:13.290
 concrete scalp dries the fast and 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.959
 permanent repairs of holes in 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.760
 very cold areas allows for 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:21.109
 unheated indoor areas or 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.109
 outdoor areas in winter 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:27.700
 baku concrete for the effective 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:32.070
 Repair of damaged burst 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:35.160
 or strewn with potholes would offer 

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:37.030
 order online or call 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.580
 Of course you can also join 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:42.730
 ask questions about your projects 

00:03:39.580 --> 00:03:45.240
 We are happy to advise you. We look forward to hearing from you 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.240
 to hear them
