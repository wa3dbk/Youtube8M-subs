social<00:04:44.690> jokes<00:04:44.930> creating<00:04:45.770> complicity

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:46.400 
social jokes creating complicity

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.030 
social jokes creating complicity
involving<00:04:47.330> a<00:04:47.540> second<00:04:47.900> person<00:04:48.260> even<00:04:48.650> without

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:51.500 
them having to be funny and this is I

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.020 
them having to be funny and this is I

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:53.030 
think why knock-knock jokes

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:55.330 
think why knock-knock jokes
works<00:04:53.570> so<00:04:53.870> well<00:04:54.169> I<00:04:54.440> think<00:04:54.800> they<00:04:54.890> must<00:04:55.040> work

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:55.340 
works so well I think they must work

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:57.280 
works so well I think they must work
well<00:04:55.520> with<00:04:55.730> children<00:04:56.210> they<00:04:56.660> don't<00:04:56.990> have<00:04:57.169> to

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:57.290 
well with children they don't have to

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:59.080 
well with children they don't have to
say<00:04:57.440> much<00:04:57.680> it's<00:04:57.919> really<00:04:58.040> just<00:04:58.310> knock-knock

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
say much it's really just knock-knock

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:01.150 
say much it's really just knock-knock
and<00:04:59.750> you<00:04:59.840> says<00:05:00.020> it's<00:05:00.050> a<00:05:00.290> two<00:05:00.350> things<00:05:00.770> and

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:01.160 
and you says it's a two things and

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.190 
and you says it's a two things and
you're<00:05:01.520> part<00:05:01.880> of<00:05:02.060> the<00:05:02.150> joke<00:05:02.360> I<00:05:02.660> also<00:05:02.870> think

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:03.200 
you're part of the joke I also think

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.320
