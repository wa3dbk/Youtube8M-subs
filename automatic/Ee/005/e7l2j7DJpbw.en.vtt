you see wouldn't charge before
I'm<00:00:05.970> not<00:00:07.130> we've<00:00:08.130> got<00:00:08.370> 5<00:00:08.970> point<00:00:09.300> 4<00:00:09.660> volts<00:00:09.960> across

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
I'm not we've got 5 point 4 volts across

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.849 
I'm not we've got 5 point 4 volts across
it<00:00:10.800> at<00:00:10.889> a<00:00:10.920> second<00:00:12.500> so<00:00:13.500> when<00:00:14.130> we're<00:00:14.309> doing<00:00:14.490> Ares

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:15.859 
it at a second so when we're doing Ares

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:20.240 
it at a second so when we're doing Ares
I'm<00:00:16.859> gonna<00:00:17.039> leave<00:00:17.250> this<00:00:17.400> running<00:00:18.830> and<00:00:19.830> see<00:00:20.160> if

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
I'm gonna leave this running and see if

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.370 
I'm gonna leave this running and see if
we<00:00:20.340> can<00:00:20.490> get<00:00:20.640> lucky<00:00:21.090> yeah<00:00:21.359> prepare<00:00:21.810> 12<00:00:22.170> volt

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
we can get lucky yeah prepare 12 volt

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.380 
we can get lucky yeah prepare 12 volt
charge<00:00:22.680> out<00:00:22.980> of<00:00:23.010> it<00:00:23.779> so<00:00:24.779> for<00:00:25.019> us<00:00:25.140> to<00:00:26.090> start<00:00:27.090> up

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
charge out of it so for us to start up

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:39.300 
charge out of it so for us to start up
there

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:39.310 

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.810 

and<00:00:39.850> instantly<00:00:40.480> we're<00:00:40.780> getting<00:00:40.990> in<00:00:41.050> the<00:00:41.820> that

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:42.820 
and instantly we're getting in the that

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:53.180 
and instantly we're getting in the that
thing<00:00:43.090> punch<00:00:43.390> out<00:00:43.780> of<00:00:43.900> it

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.050 

and<00:00:53.640> that's<00:00:53.850> actually<00:00:54.120> over<00:00:54.570> that<00:00:54.950> way

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:56.060 
and that's actually over that way

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:11.510 
and that's actually over that way
capacitor<00:00:57.060> across<00:00:57.390> it

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.980 

we're<00:01:55.850> not<00:01:55.970> actually<00:01:56.090> using<00:01:56.479> this<00:01:56.540> battery

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
we're not actually using this battery

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.639 
we're not actually using this battery
assault<00:01:57.079> so<00:01:58.030> where's<00:01:59.030> mr.<00:01:59.149> Shroff<00:01:59.509> but<00:01:59.960> that's

assault so where's mr. Shroff but that's
holding<00:02:01.009> the<00:02:01.070> charge<00:02:01.340> now<00:02:01.549> over<00:02:01.930> twelve<00:02:02.930> point

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229 
holding the charge now over twelve point

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:05.830 
holding the charge now over twelve point
one<00:02:03.320> eight<00:02:04.149> I'll<00:02:05.149> come<00:02:05.299> back<00:02:05.420> to<00:02:05.539> that<00:02:05.689> at<00:02:05.750> the

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
one eight I'll come back to that at the

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:06.880 
one eight I'll come back to that at the
end<00:02:05.899> to<00:02:06.170> make<00:02:06.200> sure<00:02:06.320> it's<00:02:06.560> still<00:02:06.710> got<00:02:06.860> that

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
end to make sure it's still got that

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:14.240 
end to make sure it's still got that
charge<00:02:07.280> in<00:02:07.460> it<00:02:09.340> the<00:02:10.340> last<00:02:10.550> test

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.030 

so<00:02:14.820> we're<00:02:15.120> we're<00:02:15.780> charging<00:02:16.050> this<00:02:16.620> battery

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
so we're we're charging this battery

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:28.199 
so we're we're charging this battery
that<00:02:17.190> had<00:02:17.310> roughly<00:02:17.760> 5<00:02:18.000> volts<00:02:18.420> in<00:02:18.510> it<00:02:18.660> at<00:02:19.550> 13.7

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:32.339 

and<00:02:28.510> leave<00:02:28.870> this<00:02:29.019> room<00:02:29.260> for<00:02:30.900> say<00:02:31.900> 20<00:02:32.230> minutes

00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:32.349 
and leave this room for say 20 minutes

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:41.320 
and leave this room for say 20 minutes
and<00:02:32.860> see<00:02:33.280> where<00:02:33.459> we're<00:02:33.579> at<00:02:33.640> okay

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.850 

after<00:02:43.130> ten<00:02:44.130> minutes

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
after ten minutes

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:51.900 
after ten minutes
that's<00:02:46.490> what<00:02:46.730> I've<00:02:46.880> noticed<00:02:47.090> is<00:02:48.310> thumbscrews

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.890 

yeah<00:02:52.800> when<00:02:53.800> it's<00:02:53.950> in<00:02:54.130> resonance<00:02:54.580> the<00:02:55.570> charge

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 
yeah when it's in resonance the charge

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:09.820 
yeah when it's in resonance the charge
goes<00:02:56.200> up<00:02:56.670> considerably<00:02:57.930> welcome

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:09.830

the<00:03:14.190> charge<00:03:15.190> goes<00:03:15.430> up<00:03:16.650> the<00:03:17.650> more<00:03:17.830> you<00:03:17.890> can<00:03:18.070> make

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:18.130 
the charge goes up the more you can make

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:23.510 
the charge goes up the more you can make
it<00:03:18.460> home<00:03:21.300> so

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:23.520 
it home so

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.640 
it home so
the<00:03:24.000> term<00:03:24.240> minutes<00:03:24.510> has<00:03:24.690> been<00:03:24.720> fluctuating<00:03:25.110> up

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:25.650 
the term minutes has been fluctuating up

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.850 
the term minutes has been fluctuating up
and<00:03:25.830> down

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.130 

it<00:03:29.400> will<00:03:29.520> find<00:03:29.700> out<00:03:29.820> the<00:03:29.940> proper<00:03:30.240> charge<00:03:30.870> of

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
it will find out the proper charge of

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.810 
it will find out the proper charge of
battery<00:03:31.950> sir<00:03:32.630> from<00:03:33.630> roughly<00:03:33.900> 5<00:03:34.260> volts<00:03:34.820> after

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
battery sir from roughly 5 volts after

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:46.280 
don't let's see what looks like after

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.210 
don't let's see what looks like after
20<00:03:46.850> minutes<00:03:47.090> at<00:03:47.240> the<00:03:48.110> quick<00:03:48.710> glance<00:03:48.830> at<00:03:49.160> this

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
20 minutes at the quick glance at this

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:56.699 
20 minutes at the quick glance at this
one

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:56.709 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:59.280 

that's<00:03:57.129> a<00:03:57.280> point<00:03:57.609> I<00:03:57.700> know

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
that's a point I know

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:06.630 
that's a point I know
it<00:03:59.799> was<00:03:59.950> about<00:04:00.129> right<00:04:00.310> with<00:04:00.519> that

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:12.180 

so<00:04:07.500> boy

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:19.280 

describe<00:04:13.190> the<00:04:13.310> power

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:22.170 

anything<00:04:20.290> both<00:04:20.530> of<00:04:20.709> them<00:04:20.970> think<00:04:21.970> it<00:04:22.030> was<00:04:22.120> about

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.180 
anything both of them think it was about

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:23.790 
anything both of them think it was about
4.5<00:04:22.840> wasn't<00:04:23.500> it

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
4.5 wasn't it

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:26.909 
4.5 wasn't it
he's<00:04:24.790> again<00:04:25.120> on<00:04:25.389> this<00:04:25.600> because<00:04:26.440> it<00:04:26.620> wouldn't

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:26.919 
he's again on this because it wouldn't

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:37.459 
he's again on this because it wouldn't
charge<00:04:27.130> above<00:04:27.460> that<00:04:27.639> previously

00:04:37.459 --> 00:04:37.469 

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:43.510 

they're<00:04:37.979> looking<00:04:38.309> good<00:04:38.339> so<00:04:38.759> far

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:43.520 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:45.430 

if<00:04:43.970> that<00:04:44.150> stays<00:04:44.419> around<00:04:44.750> I<00:04:44.930> know<00:04:45.169> and<00:04:45.380> I'm

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 
if that stays around I know and I'm

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.499 
if that stays around I know and I'm
going<00:04:45.620> to<00:04:45.680> charge<00:04:45.979> this<00:04:46.130> front<00:04:46.370> of<00:04:46.460> the<00:04:46.550> 20

00:04:47.499 --> 00:04:47.509 
going to charge this front of the 20

00:04:47.509 --> 00:05:11.440 
going to charge this front of the 20
minutes<00:04:47.720> off<00:04:47.840> our<00:04:48.050> I<00:04:50.889> feel<00:04:51.889> taught<00:04:52.160> tomorrow

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:11.450 

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:14.000 

so<00:05:12.450> we've<00:05:12.780> actually<00:05:12.900> charged<00:05:13.380> that<00:05:13.500> from<00:05:13.740> five

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:14.010 
so we've actually charged that from five

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:23.710 
so we've actually charged that from five
point<00:05:14.250> five<00:05:14.430> to<00:05:16.880> nine<00:05:17.880> volts<00:05:20.480> that's<00:05:21.480> great

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:23.720 
point five to nine volts that's great

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.940 
point five to nine volts that's great
yeah<00:05:24.720> I<00:05:24.900> think<00:05:24.960> I'm<00:05:25.230> gonna<00:05:25.350> vote<00:05:25.560> charges

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:25.950 
yeah I think I'm gonna vote charges

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:27.980 
yeah I think I'm gonna vote charges
again<00:05:26.190> then<00:05:26.400> see<00:05:26.910> if<00:05:26.970> we<00:05:27.060> can<00:05:27.210> push<00:05:27.660> it<00:05:27.810> away

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:27.990 
again then see if we can push it away

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:32.030 
again then see if we can push it away
back<00:05:28.260> up<00:05:28.410> to<00:05:28.590> 12<00:05:28.830> volts<00:05:29.100> if<00:05:29.970> it's<00:05:30.180> taken<00:05:31.040> 20

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:32.040 
back up to 12 volts if it's taken 20

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:34.490 
back up to 12 volts if it's taken 20
minutes<00:05:32.280> to<00:05:32.430> get<00:05:32.520> it<00:05:32.640> to<00:05:32.970> roughly<00:05:33.960> four<00:05:34.170> volts

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:34.500 
minutes to get it to roughly four volts

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.120 
minutes to get it to roughly four volts
up<00:05:35.210> so<00:05:36.210> what<00:05:36.330> we<00:05:36.390> can<00:05:36.510> do<00:05:36.690> with<00:05:36.870> over<00:05:37.860> twenty

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:38.130 
up so what we can do with over twenty

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:40.400 
up so what we can do with over twenty
minutes
