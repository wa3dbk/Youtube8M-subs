00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
 we all believe that we control our 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.810
 thoughts and actions are what make us 

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:09.300
 us but the development of technology biology is not 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.400
 standing still and last every day 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.440
 becoming more perfect in 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.540
 this raises the question of whether 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.820
 your brain being hacked the truth is that 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.650
 the brain is an electrical device because 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.720
 this we can connect it to others 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.580
 electrical appliances hundreds of thousands of people 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.010
 already experiencing it with yourself 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.869
 so-called cochlear implants 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.910
 which transmit sound to the brain and 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.439
 by electric impulses 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.300
 the only problem is that 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.370
 electricity is not exactly accurate she 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.500
 transmits a signal through a large number 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.690
 neurons in the brain and in the case of hearing 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.579
 this may make the signal fuzzy so that 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.040
 solve this problem scientists come up with 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.320
 method allows you to use the light that 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.059
 made signal transmission more accurate and 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.550
 aimed at certain areas 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:52.590
 the brain is exactly this in the method can become 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.690
 key to more directional control 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.520
 brain need to say that the brain cells 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.670
 first you need to learn how to use 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.780
 light as a way to transmit information 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.329
 despite the fact that it may sound 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.369
 madly scientists use harmless not 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.680
 breeding virus in order to 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.140
 introduce the necessary genes into the neurons needed 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.150
 or brain cells these genes are extracted from 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.890
 other organisms that use 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.500
 light for survival such as marine 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.750
 algae for example strangely enough but we 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.729
 use the same genetic cell 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.799
 mechanisms that they are so what if you 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.200
 take dna from algae paste and 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:27.240
 Ivan she will continue to work these genes 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.040
 carry information about proteins that 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.320
 allow neurons or other cells 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.360
 brain work like solar panels 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.799
 so they react to light 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.560
 signals and turns it into electric 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:40.020
 while cells without new dna 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.270
 remain at rest all that 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.250
 now need is a light source capable 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.439
 shine on neurons when we want them 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.060
 activate do the same with 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.340
 areas of pleasure and you can 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.409
 make a person happy just by clicking 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.329
 On the button, build this system in the zone 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.130
 responsible for the movement and you can 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:59.040
 control physical actions 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.079
 human and that is exactly what scientists did in 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.360
 right motor area of ​​the brain 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.820
 this mouse is responsible for moving left 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.920
 built-in fiber cable when light 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.959
 directed to her altered neurons 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.880
 the mouse can't do anything about it and 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:14.800
 should run to the left actually her thoughts 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.020
 actions were hacked but what will 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.730
 when we start building technology in 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.620
 your brain on the one hand it can 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.900
 help fight diseases like 

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:24.880
 alzheimer personality disorder or 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.950
 even with things like depression 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.590
 enable or disable and necessary 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.240
 cells and the problem is solved ordinary person 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.250
 Perhaps I would like to use this. 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.740
 technology to improve your vision 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.750
 or to play video games in 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.910
 head when we start to understand better 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.460
 the complexity of the features of the brain 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.920
 which parts controls those or 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:47.470
 other actions and thoughts this technology 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:50.140
 will become even more promising at the same 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.690
 time ethical problems and risks seem 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.910
 big enough and so knowing that your 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:59.190
 the brain can be hacked like you all 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.190
 Equal use of this technology
