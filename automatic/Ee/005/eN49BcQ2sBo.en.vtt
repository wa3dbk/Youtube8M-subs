00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.330 
and I picked this up at a flea market
for<00:00:11.280> $20<00:00:12.269> and<00:00:12.540> it<00:00:13.170> needs<00:00:13.380> a<00:00:13.500> little<00:00:13.620> rebuilding

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
for $20 and it needs a little rebuilding

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.750 
for $20 and it needs a little rebuilding
and<00:00:14.580> it's<00:00:15.150> aluminum<00:00:15.599> and<00:00:15.980> the<00:00:16.980> problem<00:00:17.369> I<00:00:17.490> have

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
and it's aluminum and the problem I have

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:24.410 
and it's aluminum and the problem I have
is<00:00:18.949> this<00:00:19.949> pipe<00:00:20.220> is<00:00:20.699> used<00:00:21.630> in<00:00:22.199> here<00:00:23.240> y'all<00:00:24.240> can

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
is this pipe is used in here y'all can

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.670 
is this pipe is used in here y'all can
see<00:00:24.630> that<00:00:24.840> or<00:00:24.990> not<00:00:26.330> it's<00:00:27.330> really<00:00:27.960> rusted<00:00:28.529> in

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
see that or not it's really rusted in

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.519 
see that or not it's really rusted in
there<00:00:28.920> and<00:00:29.189> and<00:00:29.730> yeah<00:00:30.630> I<00:00:30.660> can<00:00:30.900> you<00:00:31.199> know<00:00:31.289> bear

there and and yeah I can you know bear

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:33.080 
there and and yeah I can you know bear
some<00:00:31.769> fortune<00:00:32.219> on<00:00:32.279> it<00:00:32.309> but<00:00:32.579> this<00:00:32.730> is<00:00:32.790> aluminum

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
some fortune on it but this is aluminum

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.170 
some fortune on it but this is aluminum
the<00:00:33.840> break<00:00:34.200> so<00:00:34.710> I'm<00:00:35.370> gonna<00:00:35.489> try<00:00:35.700> and<00:00:35.820> get<00:00:36.000> that

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:36.180 
the break so I'm gonna try and get that

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:51.979 
the break so I'm gonna try and get that
out<00:00:36.420> and<00:00:37.520> also<00:00:48.890> this<00:00:49.890> is<00:00:50.430> aluminum<00:00:51.420> aluminum

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
out and also this is aluminum aluminum

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.959 
out and also this is aluminum aluminum
and<00:00:52.410> I<00:00:52.500> guess<00:00:52.710> it's<00:00:52.920> corroded<00:00:53.489> I<00:00:53.579> need<00:00:53.760> to<00:00:53.820> get

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
and I guess it's corroded I need to get

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.479 
and I guess it's corroded I need to get
that<00:00:54.120> off<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.480> rebuild<00:00:54.840> this<00:00:54.989> pump<00:00:55.320> so<00:00:55.620> that's

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
that off to rebuild this pump so that's

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.720 
that off to rebuild this pump so that's
what<00:00:56.670> we're<00:00:56.789> going<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:56.940> be<00:00:57.090> doing

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:05.620 

okay<00:01:02.480> I'm<00:01:02.900> going<00:01:03.080> to<00:01:03.140> be<00:01:03.260> using<00:01:03.650> a<00:01:04.630> propane

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:05.630 
okay I'm going to be using a propane

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.370 
okay I'm going to be using a propane
torch<00:01:05.930> here<00:01:06.260> and<00:01:06.530> I<00:01:07.310> don't<00:01:07.640> want<00:01:07.940> to<00:01:07.970> use

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
torch here and I don't want to use

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.510 
torch here and I don't want to use
oxy-acetylene<00:01:10.120> because<00:01:11.120> this<00:01:12.050> melts<00:01:12.590> at

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
oxy-acetylene because this melts at

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:15.220 
oxy-acetylene because this melts at
twelve<00:01:13.970> hundred<00:01:14.060> twenty<00:01:14.600> degrees<00:01:14.930> this

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:15.230 
twelve hundred twenty degrees this

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.140 
twelve hundred twenty degrees this
aluminum<00:01:15.740> of<00:01:16.370> course<00:01:16.610> I'm<00:01:16.730> not<00:01:16.820> worried<00:01:17.060> about

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
aluminum of course I'm not worried about

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.480 
aluminum of course I'm not worried about
the<00:01:17.540> steel<00:01:18.020> it<00:01:18.380> melts<00:01:18.710> at<00:01:18.860> twenty<00:01:19.160> five<00:01:19.310> to

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
the steel it melts at twenty five to

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.390 
the steel it melts at twenty five to
twenty<00:01:19.760> seven<00:01:19.970> hundred<00:01:20.090> degrees<00:01:21.070> this<00:01:22.070> only

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:22.400 
twenty seven hundred degrees this only

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.010 
twenty seven hundred degrees this only
gets<00:01:22.610> to<00:01:22.760> 900<00:01:23.270> degrees<00:01:23.510> so<00:01:23.660> what<00:01:23.780> I'm<00:01:23.870> going<00:01:23.990> to

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
gets to 900 degrees so what I'm going to

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.500 
gets to 900 degrees so what I'm going to
do<00:01:24.140> is<00:01:24.260> I'm<00:01:24.380> going<00:01:24.470> to<00:01:24.530> heat<00:01:24.710> this<00:01:24.860> up<00:01:25.100> and<00:01:25.510> then

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:26.510 
do is I'm going to heat this up and then

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:27.430 
do is I'm going to heat this up and then
we're<00:01:26.600> going<00:01:26.720> to<00:01:26.750> put<00:01:26.960> some<00:01:27.200> type<00:01:27.410> of

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:27.440 
we're going to put some type of

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.620 
we're going to put some type of
penetrating<00:01:28.220> oil<00:01:28.460> on<00:01:28.729> it<00:01:28.880> so<00:01:29.200> let's<00:01:30.200> uh<00:01:31.630> let's

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
penetrating oil on it so let's uh let's

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:39.580 
penetrating oil on it so let's uh let's
get<00:01:32.900> it<00:01:32.990> going<00:01:33.290> here<00:01:37.360> I'm<00:01:38.360> going<00:01:38.479> to<00:01:38.570> start<00:01:38.869> on

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:39.590 
get it going here I'm going to start on

00:01:39.590 --> 00:02:00.270 
get it going here I'm going to start on
camera<00:01:56.950> finally

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:00.280 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.370 

and<00:02:00.610> up<00:02:00.910> a<00:02:01.060> little<00:02:01.210> bit

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
and up a little bit

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.359 
and up a little bit
we<00:02:04.189> see<00:02:04.490> it

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:07.369 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:09.969 

early<00:02:07.579> life<00:02:07.850> flame

00:02:09.969 --> 00:02:09.979 
early life flame

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:33.240 
early life flame
gonna<00:02:10.190> heat<00:02:10.399> this<00:02:10.550> thing<00:02:10.610> up<00:02:11.000> a<00:02:11.150> little<00:02:11.330> bit

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:39.470 

you<00:02:33.700> got<00:02:33.910> the<00:02:34.030> idea

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.490 

okay<00:02:40.480> I<00:02:40.780> just<00:02:41.230> heard<00:02:41.440> a<00:02:41.530> cracking<00:02:42.040> noise<00:02:42.070> so

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
okay I just heard a cracking noise so

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:45.840 
okay I just heard a cracking noise so
put<00:02:44.500> some<00:02:44.680> of<00:02:44.800> that<00:02:44.830> on<00:02:44.920> there<00:02:45.280> and<00:02:45.460> the<00:02:45.580> theory

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
put some of that on there and the theory

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:50.700 
put some of that on there and the theory
is<00:02:46.440> is<00:02:47.440> when<00:02:47.680> it<00:02:47.770> cools<00:02:48.040> off<00:02:48.960> that<00:02:49.960> penetrating

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:50.710 
is is when it cools off that penetrating

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:55.580 
is is when it cools off that penetrating
oil<00:02:50.800> will<00:02:51.790> get<00:02:51.970> up<00:02:52.150> in<00:02:52.330> there<00:02:52.480> around<00:02:52.720> it<00:02:52.990> so

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:06.339 

try<00:02:56.590> that

00:03:06.339 --> 00:03:06.349 

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:08.020 

okay<00:03:06.890> if<00:03:07.040> y'all<00:03:07.249> can<00:03:07.400> see<00:03:07.640> that<00:03:07.819> I'm<00:03:07.999> just

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:08.030 
okay if y'all can see that I'm just

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.500 
okay if y'all can see that I'm just
gonna<00:03:08.390> keep<00:03:08.629> that

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
gonna keep that

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:12.960 
gonna keep that
feel<00:03:11.110> up<00:03:11.379> its<00:03:11.709> gonna<00:03:11.830> hold<00:03:12.010> the<00:03:12.189> heat<00:03:12.400> more

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:12.970 
feel up its gonna hold the heat more

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.089 
feel up its gonna hold the heat more
than<00:03:13.239> the<00:03:13.360> aluminum<00:03:13.599> aluminum<00:03:14.099> dissipates

00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:15.099 
than the aluminum aluminum dissipates

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:18.240 
than the aluminum aluminum dissipates
even<00:03:15.430> quicker<00:03:15.849> so<00:03:16.500> go<00:03:17.500> around<00:03:17.739> there<00:03:18.010> and<00:03:18.129> heat

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.250 
even quicker so go around there and heat

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:23.399 
even quicker so go around there and heat
that<00:03:18.430> up<00:03:18.489> for<00:03:18.819> a<00:03:18.849> few<00:03:19.060> minutes<00:03:22.079> put<00:03:23.079> some<00:03:23.290> of

00:03:23.399 --> 00:03:23.409 
that up for a few minutes put some of

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:31.319 
that up for a few minutes put some of
this<00:03:23.500> stuff<00:03:23.560> on<00:03:24.040> it<00:03:24.159> right<00:03:24.310> here<00:03:30.239> okay<00:03:31.239> I'm

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:31.329 
this stuff on it right here okay I'm

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:32.850 
this stuff on it right here okay I'm
gonna<00:03:31.450> let<00:03:31.569> that<00:03:31.750> soak<00:03:32.049> with<00:03:32.290> the<00:03:32.409> penetrating

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
gonna let that soak with the penetrating

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.210 
gonna let that soak with the penetrating
oil<00:03:33.040> and<00:03:33.659> this<00:03:34.659> right<00:03:34.870> here<00:03:35.019> I<00:03:35.079> need<00:03:35.200> to<00:03:35.319> break

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
oil and this right here I need to break

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.809

gashes on them but I didn't break the

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:26.610 
gashes on them but I didn't break the
piece<00:06:23.740> so<00:06:24.960> should<00:06:25.960> have<00:06:26.020> done<00:06:26.199> that<00:06:26.320> to<00:06:26.470> begin

applied<00:06:52.030> some<00:06:52.330> more<00:06:52.510> heat<00:06:52.690> maybe<00:06:53.020> it<00:06:53.169> would

00:06:53.279 --> 00:06:53.289 
applied some more heat maybe it would
