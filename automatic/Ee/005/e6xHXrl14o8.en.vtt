that long I find it amazing and there's
a<00:01:32.520> lot<00:01:32.790> of<00:01:32.820> years<00:01:33.090> left<00:01:33.150> in<00:01:33.510> these<00:01:33.600> aircraft<00:01:34.110> it

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
a lot of years left in these aircraft it

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.350 
a lot of years left in these aircraft it
shows<00:01:34.619> there<00:01:34.979> the<00:01:35.460> strength<00:01:35.790> it<00:01:36.030> shows<00:01:36.210> the

versatility constantly changing

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.430 
versatility constantly changing
technology<00:01:38.880> but<00:01:39.119> yet<00:01:39.240> we're<00:01:39.390> able<00:01:39.960> to<00:01:40.140> keep<00:01:40.259> up

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.440 
technology but yet we're able to keep up

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:43.160 
technology but yet we're able to keep up
with<00:01:40.500> it<00:01:40.830> and<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.640> Air<00:01:41.729> Force<00:01:42.030> realizes<00:01:42.840> the

advantage the asset that it has in the

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.050 
advantage the asset that it has in the
buff<00:01:45.930> and<00:01:46.229> they<00:01:46.680> just<00:01:46.890> keep<00:01:47.040> they<00:01:47.670> keep<00:01:47.850> us<00:01:47.970> in

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
buff and they just keep they keep us in

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.880 
buff and they just keep they keep us in
the<00:01:48.150> fight<00:01:48.330> by<00:01:48.539> I've<00:01:49.050> given<00:01:49.320> us<00:01:49.410> the<00:01:49.560> upgrades

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
the fight by I've given us the upgrades

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.400 
the fight by I've given us the upgrades
obviously<00:01:50.399> we<00:01:50.520> have<00:01:50.640> the<00:01:50.759> thrust<00:01:51.060> to<00:01:52.050> take<00:01:52.229> on

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:52.410 
obviously we have the thrust to take on

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:54.980 
obviously we have the thrust to take on
different<00:01:52.560> weighted<00:01:53.340> munitions<00:01:53.789> and<00:01:53.940> so<00:01:54.420> it's

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
different weighted munitions and so it's

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.960 
different weighted munitions and so it's
a<00:01:55.080> perfect<00:01:55.229> platform<00:01:55.619> for<00:01:55.920> whatever<00:01:56.700> they<00:01:56.820> ask

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
a perfect platform for whatever they ask

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.719 
a perfect platform for whatever they ask
of<00:01:57.179> us<00:01:57.320> she<00:01:58.320> is<00:01:58.440> withstood<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.070> test<00:01:59.460> of<00:01:59.670> time

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
of us she is withstood the test of time

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.359 
of us she is withstood the test of time
