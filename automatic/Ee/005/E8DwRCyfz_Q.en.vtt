00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
basically the same as lex luthor's big

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.290 
basically the same as lex luthor's big
figure<00:01:01.800> transformation<00:01:02.520> but<00:01:03.030> you<00:01:03.210> know

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
figure transformation but you know

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.030 
figure transformation but you know
brainiacs<00:01:03.899> head<00:01:04.110> and<00:01:04.260> things<00:01:04.409> that<00:01:04.680> would<00:01:04.890> be

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
brainiacs head and things that would be

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.890 
brainiacs head and things that would be
awesome<00:01:05.280> hopefully<00:01:06.270> they've<00:01:06.450> added<00:01:06.750> that<00:01:06.869> I

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
awesome hopefully they've added that I

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.719 
awesome hopefully they've added that I
mean<00:01:07.140> he<00:01:07.320> has<00:01:07.409> a<00:01:07.439> really<00:01:07.650> nice<00:01:07.860> big<00:01:08.189> gun<00:01:08.490> there

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
mean he has a really nice big gun there

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.789 
mean he has a really nice big gun there
but<00:01:09.000> it'd<00:01:09.390> be<00:01:09.600> so<00:01:09.810> cool<00:01:09.840> if<00:01:10.080> he<00:01:10.229> has<00:01:10.409> all<00:01:10.650> these

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
but it'd be so cool if he has all these

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.010 
but it'd be so cool if he has all these
different<00:01:11.130> transformations<00:01:11.939> and<00:01:12.150> suits<00:01:12.450> just

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
different transformations and suits just

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.620 
different transformations and suits just
like<00:01:13.260> how<00:01:13.530> Batman<00:01:14.490> and<00:01:14.790> lex<00:01:14.970> luthor<00:01:15.299> things

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
like how Batman and lex luthor things

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.020 
like how Batman and lex luthor things
because<00:01:16.140> he<00:01:16.590> is<00:01:16.680> the<00:01:16.860> main<00:01:17.040> villain<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:17.640> if<00:01:17.939> he

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
because he is the main villain and if he

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.670 
because he is the main villain and if he
is<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.299> main<00:01:18.450> vil<00:01:18.600> and<00:01:18.750> then<00:01:18.869> really<00:01:19.259> he

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
is the main vil and then really he

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.380 
is the main vil and then really he
should<00:01:19.920> be<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:20.040> fun<00:01:20.310> unlockable<00:01:20.880> once<00:01:21.180> you've
