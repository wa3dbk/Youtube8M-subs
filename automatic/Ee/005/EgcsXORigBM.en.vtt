00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:11.370
 many construction sites and today want to 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.980
 prove how they really warm us up 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.049
 and prepare properly for intensive 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.240
 squat that is a bit true 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.390
 to do at the expense on the bicycle 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.619
 on the treadmill is already good and 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.260
 to be true 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:27.750
 a real intense squat 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.119
 full scope of rage of motion 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.900
 There is no need to choose 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.759
 weight more 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.270
 we must consider ourselves as one such 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:39.899
 we can do that best here 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:42.390
 best is we start with a photo 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:45.239
 that is, each of you should be like that 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.670
 to put a format for now definitely 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.280
 worth gold if you mobilize 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.399
 want for the regeneration for the 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.500
 agility for perry for a right one 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.320
 intense exercises with great 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.440
 Complexity so with big brooch and 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:03.470
 therefore definitely with one 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.570
 to roll like that 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:11.930
 From the scooter work best we start 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:14.210
 All muscles around all areas rather the 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:21.530
 squat tells are really nice 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:25.550
 except that he starts with the outside 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:29.680
 visit here fully the complete moves 

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:34.460
 Never roll out success to hip 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:38.830
 With a high pressure, the whole makes you for 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:44.660
 Eight to ten back up and then go 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:46.340
 so thighs front over power 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:50.869
 here also eight to ten 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:56.420
 repetitions then goes on 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:02:00.140
 thighs inside anyway eight 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:03.229
 until ten repetitions thoughts on 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.150
 best still through the buttock muscles 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:09.890
 that means it often puts you in shape 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:14.560
 higher stretches the legs and starts 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:15.720
 also in the buttock muscle roll out here 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:21.600
 subsequently 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:24.120
 Libya plays that role on the front 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.490
 very important the choice at the jump joint 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.410
 he is also very much calling his torch 

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:32.070
 for a really good morning 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:37.200
 thanks to cross with opponents with the 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:40.170
 hit the calf and press with the 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.340
 stone in the calf, especially where 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.800
 are connected 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:47.150
 keep up the pressure and how with 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:51.360
 a saw easily back and forth 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.050
 They want to make their muscles beautiful 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.940
 negative pressure 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:59.340
 Above all , tensions can be felt 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:02.010
 important to give that in the chest 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.790
 Breast conductor of the thoracic spine and 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:05.490
 to be mobile 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:10.709
 that also means you lay down here 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:14.520
 best asked and with your hands 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:19.620
 cross your head and lie down 

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:20.700
 back over the reserves this 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.390
 situation 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:27.110
 These places use these good ones 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:31.320
 parents we know above 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:34.790
 tries to go back again 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:36.500
 as the great worry was really nice 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:40.610
 straighten 

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.610
 if you have it all 

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:48.450
 of course they had to object big 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:50.820
 from case studies right foot away in front 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:55.080
 hold side with the right hand and am 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:59.040
 right foot and back with the elbow 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:01.140
 The knee out try the heel 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:04.290
 to hold on the ground press resolution 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:07.290
 start down a little bit in 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:10.560
 to tap a direction to be supported 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:13.350
 then go the other direction over the 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:18.290
 Elbow direction heel and can four 

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:22.310
 also with upper body in the Bavarian 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:25.400
 trainer for relatively far and yet in 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:27.930
 Movements too small severe that 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:32.460
 reproaches that we also in mosques and 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:34.500
 Its activating can go into one 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:37.740
 bad position so we too 

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:40.410
 nyse shareholders and that's what we do 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.250
 of course, also for that 

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:43.950
 other leg 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:48.830
 At the end you go the correct one 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:52.230
 attitude here also a little 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:54.570
 score we can all here after 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:58.020
 press the outside straight in the upper body 

00:04:54.570 --> 00:05:02.330
 hold and if you are all you are 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:02.330
 finished also leads to my level
