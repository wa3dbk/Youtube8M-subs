today<00:00:12.679> we<00:00:12.889> will<00:00:13.040> be<00:00:13.129> learning<00:00:13.340> how<00:00:13.730> to

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:13.760 
today we will be learning how to

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.570 
today we will be learning how to
properly<00:00:14.360> pinch<00:00:14.840> a<00:00:15.080> plant<00:00:15.410> and<00:00:15.740> discussing

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:16.580 
properly pinch a plant and discussing

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:19.510 
properly pinch a plant and discussing
why<00:00:16.789> we<00:00:17.029> want<00:00:17.300> to<00:00:17.390> do<00:00:17.539> that<00:00:17.920> the<00:00:18.920> first<00:00:18.949> thing

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:19.520 
why we want to do that the first thing

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.820 
why we want to do that the first thing
that<00:00:19.849> we<00:00:20.150> want<00:00:20.360> to<00:00:20.450> do<00:00:20.570> is<00:00:20.900> get<00:00:21.110> our<00:00:21.230> pruning

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:21.830 
that we want to do is get our pruning

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:23.260 
that we want to do is get our pruning
shears<00:00:22.130> out<00:00:22.310> and<00:00:22.580> make<00:00:22.820> sure<00:00:22.849> that<00:00:23.090> they're

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:23.270 
shears out and make sure that they're

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:25.029 
shears out and make sure that they're
fitting<00:00:23.570> sharp<00:00:23.869> and<00:00:24.169> that<00:00:24.680> we're<00:00:24.800> comfortable

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:25.039 
fitting sharp and that we're comfortable

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:27.519 
fitting sharp and that we're comfortable
using<00:00:25.700> them<00:00:25.880> be<00:00:26.509> very<00:00:26.750> careful<00:00:27.259> when<00:00:27.470> you're

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:27.529 
using them be very careful when you're

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:29.080 
using them be very careful when you're
using<00:00:27.590> preachers<00:00:28.430> because<00:00:28.759> it<00:00:28.880> would<00:00:28.970> be<00:00:29.059> very

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:29.090 
using preachers because it would be very

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:30.670 
using preachers because it would be very
easy<00:00:29.509> to<00:00:29.689> cut<00:00:29.989> yourself

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:30.680 
easy to cut yourself

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.490 
easy to cut yourself
now<00:00:31.640> our<00:00:32.329> first<00:00:32.630> reason<00:00:33.079> for<00:00:33.200> wanting<00:00:33.350> to

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:33.500 
now our first reason for wanting to

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.889 
now our first reason for wanting to
pinch<00:00:33.829> is<00:00:34.070> if<00:00:34.460> we<00:00:34.640> wanted<00:00:35.000> our<00:00:35.270> plant<00:00:35.600> to

00:00:35.889 --> 00:00:35.899 
pinch is if we wanted our plant to

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:37.660 
pinch is if we wanted our plant to
branch<00:00:36.230> more<00:00:36.559> so<00:00:36.770> it<00:00:36.920> would<00:00:37.160> be<00:00:37.309> to<00:00:37.489> promote

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
branch more so it would be to promote

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.540 
branch more so it would be to promote
branching<00:00:38.390> so<00:00:39.110> we<00:00:39.649> might<00:00:39.829> come<00:00:40.040> in<00:00:40.160> here<00:00:40.340> if<00:00:40.430> we

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.550 
branching so we might come in here if we

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.569 
branching so we might come in here if we
wanted<00:00:40.850> some<00:00:41.059> of<00:00:41.149> our<00:00:41.270> lower<00:00:41.510> limbs<00:00:41.930> to<00:00:42.680> become

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:43.579 
wanted some of our lower limbs to become

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:46.540 
wanted some of our lower limbs to become
longer<00:00:43.850> and<00:00:43.999> branch<00:00:44.300> out<00:00:44.480> more<00:00:44.780> and<00:00:45.370> print<00:00:46.370> off

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
longer and branch out more and print off

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.930 
longer and branch out more and print off
some<00:00:47.210> of<00:00:47.239> our<00:00:47.449> lower<00:00:47.690> limbs<00:00:48.519> now<00:00:49.519> when<00:00:49.820> you're

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:49.940 
some of our lower limbs now when you're

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.060 
some of our lower limbs now when you're
pruning<00:00:50.239> you<00:00:50.600> always<00:00:50.989> want<00:00:51.230> to<00:00:51.379> print<00:00:51.649> before

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:52.070 
pruning you always want to print before

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.450 
pruning you always want to print before
the<00:00:52.579> note<00:00:52.789> because<00:00:53.510> if<00:00:53.659> you<00:00:53.809> prune<00:00:54.710> after<00:00:55.280> the

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
the note because if you prune after the

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.279 
the note because if you prune after the
note<00:00:55.640> the<00:00:55.909> plant<00:00:56.179> will<00:00:56.329> not<00:00:56.359> regress<00:00:56.929> it'll

00:00:57.279 --> 00:00:57.289 
note the plant will not regress it'll

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:00.189 
note the plant will not regress it'll
stun<00:00:57.559> it's<00:00:57.739> crunch<00:00:58.010> right<00:00:58.280> there<00:00:59.199> another

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:00.199 
stun it's crunch right there another

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:03.910 
stun it's crunch right there another
reason<00:01:00.670> that<00:01:01.670> you<00:01:01.969> would<00:01:02.089> want<00:01:02.120> to<00:01:02.710> pinch<00:01:03.710> a

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
reason that you would want to pinch a

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.540 
reason that you would want to pinch a
planet<00:01:04.339> is<00:01:05.260> because<00:01:06.260> it<00:01:06.650> promotes<00:01:07.040> blooming

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:07.550 
planet is because it promotes blooming

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:08.649 
planet is because it promotes blooming
says<00:01:07.790> this<00:01:07.940> point<00:01:08.180> you<00:01:08.270> can<00:01:08.420> see<00:01:08.540> the

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:08.659 
says this point you can see the

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:10.240 
says this point you can see the
beautiful<00:01:08.900> fleece<00:01:09.260> on<00:01:09.500> it<00:01:09.680> and<00:01:09.860> if<00:01:09.950> you<00:01:10.070> want

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
beautiful fleece on it and if you want

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.870 
beautiful fleece on it and if you want
more<00:01:10.400> blooms<00:01:10.760> you<00:01:11.090> can<00:01:11.630> go<00:01:11.780> in<00:01:12.020> and<00:01:12.729> you<00:01:13.729> can

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
more blooms you can go in and you can

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.090 
more blooms you can go in and you can
pinch<00:01:14.180> the<00:01:14.360> plant<00:01:14.600> to<00:01:14.930> promote<00:01:15.229> more<00:01:15.380> plumage

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
pinch the plant to promote more plumage

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.700 
pinch the plant to promote more plumage
another<00:01:16.850> reason<00:01:17.390> is<00:01:17.630> if<00:01:18.079> you<00:01:18.200> are<00:01:18.259> looking<00:01:18.439> at

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
another reason is if you are looking at

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.530 
another reason is if you are looking at
this<00:01:18.860> and<00:01:19.070> you<00:01:19.159> wanted<00:01:19.520> a<00:01:19.579> very<00:01:19.759> balanced

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 
this and you wanted a very balanced

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.690 
this and you wanted a very balanced
health<00:01:20.840> plant<00:01:21.259> you'd<00:01:21.860> look<00:01:22.100> at<00:01:22.219> this<00:01:22.430> and

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
health plant you'd look at this and

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.179 
health plant you'd look at this and
realize<00:01:23.030> that<00:01:23.240> one<00:01:23.630> of<00:01:23.750> the<00:01:23.840> sides<00:01:24.110> is<00:01:24.770> a<00:01:24.829> lot

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:25.189 
realize that one of the sides is a lot

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:26.679 
realize that one of the sides is a lot
less<00:01:25.460> dense<00:01:25.700> than<00:01:25.880> the<00:01:25.939> other<00:01:26.149> so<00:01:26.450> you<00:01:26.479> could

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:26.689 
less dense than the other so you could

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:30.520 
less dense than the other so you could
come<00:01:26.930> in<00:01:27.070> and<00:01:28.360> pinch<00:01:29.360> the<00:01:29.600> plant<00:01:29.869> to<00:01:30.140> balance

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
come in and pinch the plant to balance

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:44.929 
come in and pinch the plant to balance
it

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.149 

now<00:01:45.450> as<00:01:45.630> you<00:01:45.780> go<00:01:45.899> on<00:01:46.109> the<00:01:46.200> plant<00:01:46.469> to<00:01:46.710> balance<00:01:47.069> it

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
now as you go on the plant to balance it

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.730 
now as you go on the plant to balance it
out<00:01:47.280> just<00:01:47.909> make<00:01:48.060> sure<00:01:48.240> that<00:01:48.390> you<00:01:48.600> pinch<00:01:49.499> each

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
out just make sure that you pinch each

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.249 
out just make sure that you pinch each
side<00:01:50.039> evenly<00:01:50.670> so<00:01:50.880> you<00:01:50.909> have<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:51.539> more<00:01:52.049> about

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
side evenly so you have a more about

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.969 
side evenly so you have a more about
part<00:01:52.920> so<00:01:53.130> you<00:01:53.219> may<00:01:53.369> want<00:01:53.579> to<00:01:53.640> come<00:01:53.850> in<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.979> trim

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
part so you may want to come in and trim

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.399 
part so you may want to come in and trim
off<00:01:56.159> some<00:01:56.189> of<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.579> taller<00:01:56.909> more<00:01:57.840> branchy

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
off some of the taller more branchy

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.599 
off some of the taller more branchy
balloons<00:02:00.709> but<00:02:01.709> you'd<00:02:01.920> maybe<00:02:02.100> want<00:02:02.219> to<00:02:02.399> leave

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:02.609 
balloons but you'd maybe want to leave

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:05.569 
balloons but you'd maybe want to leave
some<00:02:02.880> of<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.090> smaller<00:02:03.420> one<00:02:03.719> and<00:02:04.189> just<00:02:05.189> get

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
some of the smaller one and just get

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.370 
some of the smaller one and just get
hugged<00:02:05.939> all<00:02:06.209> around<00:02:06.659> your<00:02:06.750> plane<00:02:06.959> until<00:02:07.229> it's

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
hugged all around your plane until it's

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.369 
hugged all around your plane until it's
completely<00:02:07.709> balanced<00:02:08.250> out<00:02:08.750> another<00:02:09.750> reason

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
completely balanced out another reason

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.259 
completely balanced out another reason
that<00:02:10.410> she<00:02:10.739> would<00:02:10.769> want<00:02:11.129> to<00:02:11.430> pinch<00:02:11.700> a<00:02:11.819> plan<00:02:12.030> is

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:12.269 
that she would want to pinch a plan is

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:14.150 
that she would want to pinch a plan is
to<00:02:12.420> get<00:02:12.569> cuttings<00:02:13.049> and<00:02:13.290> as<00:02:13.830> we<00:02:13.980> mentioned

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
to get cuttings and as we mentioned

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.390 
to get cuttings and as we mentioned
before<00:02:14.599> we're<00:02:15.599> cutting<00:02:15.930> before<00:02:16.440> the<00:02:16.620> note<00:02:16.830> so

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
before we're cutting before the note so

see<00:02:38.129> the<00:02:38.280> nodes<00:02:38.579> than<00:02:39.000> on<00:02:39.150> our<00:02:39.180> planet<00:02:39.629> before

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
see the nodes than on our planet before

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.660 
see the nodes than on our planet before
as<00:02:40.980> you<00:02:41.220> can<00:02:41.400> see<00:02:41.640> here's<00:02:42.390> a<00:02:42.510> note<00:02:43.459> there's<00:02:44.459> the

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
next node and here's the third note now

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:49.670 
next node and here's the third note now
if<00:02:48.180> we<00:02:48.299> were<00:02:48.359> going<00:02:48.480> to<00:02:48.599> pinch<00:02:48.870> remember<00:02:49.530> we

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
if we were going to pinch remember we

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.620 
if we were going to pinch remember we
said<00:02:49.889> that<00:02:49.920> we<00:02:50.130> wanted<00:02:50.459> to<00:02:50.549> pinch<00:02:50.790> before<00:02:51.389> the

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
said that we wanted to pinch before the

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.250 
said that we wanted to pinch before the
node<00:02:51.870> so<00:02:52.709> we<00:02:52.739> would<00:02:53.010> come<00:02:53.220> in<00:02:53.250> here<00:02:53.579> and<00:02:54.260> simply

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
node so we would come in here and simply

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.280 
node so we would come in here and simply
trim<00:02:55.530> it<00:02:55.650> off<00:02:55.799> and<00:02:56.099> this<00:02:57.030> where<00:02:57.359> we<00:02:57.510> just<00:02:57.810> pinch

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
trim it off and this where we just pinch

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.069 
trim it off and this where we just pinch
will<00:02:59.190> this<00:02:59.639> because<00:03:00.299> we<00:03:00.419> pinch<00:03:00.630> before<00:03:00.959> the

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:01.079 
will this because we pinch before the

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:03.229 
will this because we pinch before the
note<00:03:01.290> it<00:03:01.500> will<00:03:01.650> stimulate<00:03:02.099> growth<00:03:02.459> and<00:03:03.090> it

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
note it will stimulate growth and it

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:04.670 
note it will stimulate growth and it
will<00:03:03.359> grow<00:03:03.540> out<00:03:03.569> a<00:03:03.750> new<00:03:04.019> chute

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
will grow out a new chute

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.729 
will grow out a new chute
and<00:03:04.769> as<00:03:05.760> with<00:03:05.970> our<00:03:06.120> cutting<00:03:06.630> we<00:03:07.290> can<00:03:07.470> plant

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
and as with our cutting we can plant

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:09.620 
and as with our cutting we can plant
this<00:03:07.889> in<00:03:08.130> the<00:03:08.250> ground<00:03:08.519> and<00:03:08.790> it<00:03:09.060> will<00:03:09.209> become<00:03:09.389> a

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:09.630 
this in the ground and it will become a

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:12.860 
this in the ground and it will become a
plan<00:03:09.959> of<00:03:10.079> its<00:03:10.230> own<00:03:10.940> for<00:03:11.940> more<00:03:12.120> information

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
plan of its own for more information

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.960
