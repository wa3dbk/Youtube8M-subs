it<00:03:49.660> becomes<00:03:49.960> very<00:03:50.080> hard<00:03:51.030> and<00:03:52.590> I<00:03:53.590> don't<00:03:53.650> think

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:53.980 
it becomes very hard and I don't think

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.650 
it becomes very hard and I don't think
of<00:03:54.310> being<00:03:54.940> able<00:03:55.180> to<00:03:55.680> get<00:03:56.680> gold<00:03:57.070> here<00:03:57.660> without

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
of being able to get gold here without
