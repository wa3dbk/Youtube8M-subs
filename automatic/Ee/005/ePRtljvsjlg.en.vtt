00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:07.620
 Hello everyone, good evening then 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.269
 Experiment recipe is the first time 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.460
 I do it I decided that how it comes 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.070
 comes and then the place at the end 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:16.590
 you will know if crap or not 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.680
 a little while ago not even so much I have also 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.789
 put the post on facebook 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.439
 I was returning to work from the middle 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.970
 moon minus a quarter and on the dj 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.609
 I was talking about eastern china 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.010
 so I've always loved cooking 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:32.790
 Chinese in particular because others do not 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:35.370
 I got to experience them and one 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.730
 motorcycle made to the Indian and I liked it 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.280
 very 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.410
 anyway, in short, a lot of time 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.120
 I do n't eat it much, I miss it a lot 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.770
 arrived home with hallucinating hunger 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.899
 and I felt this desire of 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.340
 then oriental food which I decided to 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.559
 take the simplest recipe of 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.420
 all that almond chicken in his 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.670
 simpler version of everything and that I have 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:56.550
 found on the recipes site with 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.940
 dinghy there are no different on that 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.160
 place 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.289
 I chose the simplest of all e 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.949
 now we are going to prepare it and we hope 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.750
 one thing well before showing me the 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.930
 I was particularly keen on ingredients 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:13.530
 jump marco and loris who follow me 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:15.210
 I always follow you to generate however in 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.290
 particular with the recipes 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:21.360
 with the children and therefore I apologize there 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.550
 I take part in it I particularly care about 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.450
 let him give him a special greeting 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:29.700
 ok let's go with the ingredients then 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.119
 this recipe obviously needs the 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:36.000
 chicken here there are about seven ounces 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.680
 Diced are not very small 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.259
 but they already had me cut it to 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.300
 I still have cubes of stew 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.450
 cut further however point 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:47.610
 here are seven ounces and a cube of flour 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.080
 to flour them being chicken alle 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.100
 almonds obviously we need 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:55.110
 here there are 50 grams almonds 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.149
 recipe c 30 40 ga I like 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:01.200
 so don't add a little bit later 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:03.479
 we're going to peel toast some of it 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.070
 vegetables and here we start already crooked because 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.960
 I forgot the celery however 

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.700
 small onion a carrot and there 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.039
 I would like silks I have not forgotten 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:15.000
 to buy it and of course the seasonings 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:18.360
 then seed oil 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.340
 seed oil recipe specifying 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.459
 which is typically Chinese if we want to 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.440
 better sesame seed oil than I do 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:28.079
 in fact, I'm finishing it now 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:32.549
 it takes about 30 grams then a 

00:02:28.079 --> 00:02:34.709
 spoon of soy sauce a little salt 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:36.420
 no this is pepper a bit of pepper is a bit 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:39.510
 of salt ok 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.519
 and now let's proceed then first thing 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.010
 we flour the chicken so I have it 

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:45.570
 put some flour and the comments of 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.220
 stir bowl chicken receive 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:49.410
 tupperware is no good whatever between 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:51.600
 then you know how to flourish better than me 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.640
 no chicken or other jacopets 

00:02:51.600 --> 00:03:02.110
 of paper then we go to put 30 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:03:05.260
 grams of oil igp that is 25 30 ok 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:07.720
 so you can a hundred better than him on 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:17.710
 this point of the recipe then that 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:22.300
 so where the cork to fry 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:26.710
 for 3 minutes and here we are 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:30.940
 temperature 90 and is good at speed 5 

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:33.010
 inserting the vegetables where they are and me 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.290
 I feel the vegetables so the year in 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.870
 movement the only thing i leave behind 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:40.830
 just be it speed 5 anyway 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:40.830
 we see 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:59.010
 ok they finished me 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:10.060
 let 's see what came out careful and when 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:12.430
 so I'll show you this one came out 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:20.139
 stuff here c enters camera then 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:28.630
 now I'm going to flatten the vegetables and 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:30.789
 I add I put myself by butterfly I don't know 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:35.020
 even if there is still something ok but from 

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:38.970
 put the butterfly on the radio to insert 

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:42.820
 I also take the vegetables that are there 

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:44.460
 sorry i hope i won't let you come too 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:47.380
 seasickness 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:52.660
 ok but we don't want all the vegetables 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:56.590
 that there are screams here but not 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:58.660
 they are slaughtering, rest assured 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.830
 then I don't know if you hear the screams of the 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.330
 children because you have to lock yourself in 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:03.070
 room 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:06.660
 which they did not have problems that 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:10.889
 I don't know what they are doing then 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:10.889
 then we insert the folder 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:17.590
 Then I guess I'm slips neck point 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:21.130
