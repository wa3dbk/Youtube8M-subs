 Europe Asia and North America is the 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:44.690
 Frequency of this mutation at about one 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:46.429
 to 3000 in africa at 1 to 300 there is 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.470

 The most rare is the mortgage pants 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.650
 maybe mutations presented here 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:37.930
 but anyway or just because of that 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:40.740
 probably the best known we are talking about
