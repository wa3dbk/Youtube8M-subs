00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.960 
tutorial I'm going to be showing you how
to<00:00:06.359> make<00:00:06.540> an<00:00:06.750> alarm<00:00:07.080> system<00:00:07.350> and<00:00:07.760> I'm<00:00:08.760> not

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
to make an alarm system and I'm not

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:09.799 
to make an alarm system and I'm not
going<00:00:09.090> to<00:00:09.179> be<00:00:09.240> showing<00:00:09.360> you<00:00:09.510> all<00:00:09.660> the

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
going to be showing you all the

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:11.870 
going to be showing you all the
buildings<00:00:10.170> and<00:00:10.230> stuff<00:00:10.440> but<00:00:10.710> basically<00:00:11.670> this

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
buildings and stuff but basically this

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.270 
buildings and stuff but basically this
is<00:00:11.940> what<00:00:12.059> it<00:00:12.330> sounds<00:00:12.570> like<00:00:12.750> and<00:00:13.170> I<00:00:13.469> just<00:00:13.920> made

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
is what it sounds like and I just made

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.530 
is what it sounds like and I just made
some<00:00:14.309> no<00:00:14.549> flex<00:00:14.790> and<00:00:14.910> I<00:00:14.969> tried<00:00:15.179> to<00:00:15.269> make<00:00:15.420> it<00:00:15.450> as

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
some no flex and I tried to make it as

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:26.089 
some no flex and I tried to make it as
annoying<00:00:15.990> as<00:00:16.289> possible<00:00:17.029> so<00:00:24.320> so<00:00:25.320> it's<00:00:25.949> not

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
annoying as possible so so it's not

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.189 
annoying as possible so so it's not
incredibly<00:00:26.910> annoying<00:00:27.480> it's<00:00:27.630> pretty<00:00:27.900> annoying

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:28.199 
incredibly annoying it's pretty annoying

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:30.019 
incredibly annoying it's pretty annoying
them<00:00:28.560> and<00:00:28.769> I<00:00:29.340> wouldn't<00:00:29.609> want<00:00:29.640> to<00:00:29.760> listen<00:00:29.939> to

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
them and I wouldn't want to listen to

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.549 
them and I wouldn't want to listen to
this<00:00:30.210> all<00:00:30.420> day<00:00:30.449> so<00:00:31.910> if<00:00:32.910> you're<00:00:33.809> wondering<00:00:34.200> what

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
this all day so if you're wondering what

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.660 
this all day so if you're wondering what
could<00:00:34.739> activate<00:00:35.130> it<00:00:35.960> for<00:00:36.960> example<00:00:37.200> if<00:00:37.440> someone

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
could activate it for example if someone

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.940 
could activate it for example if someone
well<00:00:38.670> like<00:00:39.000> I<00:00:39.120> used<00:00:39.300> in<00:00:39.450> the<00:00:39.620> when<00:00:40.620> I<00:00:40.649> was

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
well like I used in the when I was

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.889 
well like I used in the when I was
showing<00:00:41.250> you<00:00:41.340> how<00:00:41.460> to<00:00:41.489> build<00:00:41.670> this<00:00:41.910> thing<00:00:41.969> this

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
showing you how to build this thing this

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:46.100 
showing you how to build this thing this
uh<00:00:42.960> to<00:00:43.860> track<00:00:44.129> combination<00:00:44.640> lock<00:00:44.960> when<00:00:45.960> you

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
uh to track combination lock when you

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:52.639 
uh to track combination lock when you
get<00:00:46.230> it<00:00:46.350> wrong<00:00:46.670> twice<00:00:50.870> it<00:00:51.870> plays<00:00:52.140> as<00:00:52.320> Knobloch

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
get it wrong twice it plays as Knobloch

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.229 
get it wrong twice it plays as Knobloch
and<00:00:52.860> this<00:00:53.309> is<00:00:53.430> basically<00:00:53.610> the<00:00:53.850> same<00:00:53.910> thing<00:00:54.059> as

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
and this is basically the same thing as

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.670 
and this is basically the same thing as
over<00:00:54.510> there<00:00:54.690> but<00:00:55.680> you<00:00:55.829> could<00:00:55.980> have<00:00:56.010> it<00:00:56.280> play<00:00:56.520> a

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.680 
over there but you could have it play a

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.170 
over there but you could have it play a
whole<00:00:58.680> song<00:00:58.920> or<00:00:59.190> you<00:00:59.340> can't<00:00:59.730> really<00:00:59.940> have<00:01:00.059> it

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
whole song or you can't really have it

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.009 
whole song or you can't really have it
do<00:01:00.300> anything<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.719> note<00:01:00.870> blocks<00:01:02.149> so<00:01:03.149> to<00:01:03.840> build

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
do anything the note blocks so to build

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.119 
do anything the note blocks so to build
this<00:01:04.170> we're<00:01:04.379> going<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:04.530> make<00:01:04.680> want<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.040> make

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
this we're going to make want to make

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.560 
this we're going to make want to make
the<00:01:05.309> clock<00:01:05.549> rate<00:01:05.790> this<00:01:05.970> call<00:01:06.210> a<00:01:06.240> clock

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
the clock rate this call a clock

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.330 
the clock rate this call a clock
basically<00:01:07.409> repeats<00:01:07.799> um<00:01:09.619> so<00:01:10.619> this<00:01:10.950> is<00:01:11.100> a<00:01:11.130> more

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
basically repeats um so this is a more

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.710 
basically repeats um so this is a more
stable<00:01:11.549> version<00:01:11.970> you<00:01:12.060> can<00:01:12.240> make<00:01:12.450> them<00:01:12.600> with

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
stable version you can make them with

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.940 
stable version you can make them with
redstone<00:01:13.020> repeaters<00:01:13.560> like<00:01:14.520> this<00:01:15.650> I'll<00:01:16.650> show

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
redstone repeaters like this I'll show

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:17.899 
redstone repeaters like this I'll show
you<00:01:17.009> real<00:01:17.159> fast<00:01:17.310> how<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:17.520> make<00:01:17.640> them<00:01:17.790> with

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
you real fast how to make them with

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:19.609 
you real fast how to make them with
redstone<00:01:18.180> repeaters<00:01:18.630> because<00:01:19.140> it's<00:01:19.259> got<00:01:19.409> kind

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
redstone repeaters because it's got kind

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.200 
redstone repeaters because it's got kind
of<00:01:19.710> be<00:01:19.860> kind<00:01:20.040> of<00:01:20.130> a<00:01:20.189> short<00:01:20.369> tutorial<00:01:20.549> I<00:01:20.909> think

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
of be kind of a short tutorial I think

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:22.940 
of be kind of a short tutorial I think
you<00:01:22.140> can<00:01:22.290> make<00:01:22.439> them<00:01:22.530> with<00:01:22.650> redstone

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
you can make them with redstone

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.640 
you can make them with redstone
repeaters<00:01:23.340> like<00:01:23.460> that<00:01:24.229> oops

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:27.650 

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.980 

but<00:01:28.370> that's<00:01:28.760> not<00:01:28.970> as<00:01:29.150> stable<00:01:29.330> and<00:01:29.600> I<00:01:29.810> don't

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
but that's not as stable and I don't

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.860 
but that's not as stable and I don't
like<00:01:30.080> that<00:01:30.110> version<00:01:30.410> as<00:01:30.650> much<00:01:31.660> so<00:01:32.660> we're<00:01:32.780> going

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:32.870 
like that version as much so we're going

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:35.320 
like that version as much so we're going
to<00:01:32.960> be<00:01:33.020> making<00:01:33.140> it<00:01:33.380> like<00:01:33.500> that<00:01:33.620> over<00:01:33.890> there<00:01:34.330> so

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.330 
to be making it like that over there so

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.170 
to be making it like that over there so
let's<00:01:35.600> come<00:01:35.810> to<00:01:35.930> do<00:01:36.080> some<00:01:36.260> new<00:01:36.410> space<00:01:36.650> and<00:01:37.180> to

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
let's come to do some new space and to

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.150 
let's come to do some new space and to
make<00:01:38.300> a<00:01:38.330> this<00:01:38.930> the<00:01:39.170> kind<00:01:39.350> of<00:01:39.410> clock<00:01:39.680> this<00:01:39.980> is

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:40.160 
make a this the kind of clock this is

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.130 
make a this the kind of clock this is
called<00:01:40.400> a<00:01:40.460> 5<00:01:40.610> clock<00:01:40.850> go<00:01:41.630> along<00:01:41.810> and<00:01:41.930> put<00:01:42.110> a

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:42.140 
called a 5 clock go along and put a

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.460 
called a 5 clock go along and put a
block<00:01:43.270> count<00:01:44.270> two<00:01:44.450> spaces<00:01:44.720> put<00:01:45.050> another<00:01:45.230> block

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
block count two spaces put another block

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:47.140 
block count two spaces put another block
count<00:01:46.130> to<00:01:46.310> more<00:01:46.490> spaces<00:01:46.880> and<00:01:46.970> put<00:01:47.090> another

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:47.150 
count to more spaces and put another

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.220 
count to more spaces and put another
block<00:01:47.510> and<00:01:48.580> then<00:01:49.580> leave<00:01:50.360> one<00:01:50.660> space<00:01:50.930> in<00:01:51.140> the

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:51.230 
block and then leave one space in the

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:54.520 
block and then leave one space in the
middle<00:01:51.440> and<00:01:51.590> on<00:01:52.370> this<00:01:52.520> side<00:01:52.760> put<00:01:53.750> a<00:01:53.780> block<00:01:54.050> one

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
middle and on this side put a block one

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.770 
middle and on this side put a block one
away<00:01:54.800> from<00:01:54.860> there<00:01:55.220> and<00:01:55.400> then<00:01:56.240> just<00:01:56.390> can't<00:01:56.630> tues

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:56.780 
away from there and then just can't tues

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.410 
away from there and then just can't tues
paste<00:01:57.020> and<00:01:57.170> put<00:01:57.260> another<00:01:57.350> block<00:01:58.090> so<00:01:59.090> this<00:01:59.270> is

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
paste and put another block so this is

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.030 
paste and put another block so this is
the<00:01:59.600> basic<00:01:59.780> outline<00:02:00.170> of<00:02:00.440> it<00:02:00.710> and<00:02:01.330> then<00:02:02.830> on<00:02:03.830> the

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
the basic outline of it and then on the

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.000 
the basic outline of it and then on the
side<00:02:04.190> with<00:02:04.340> three<00:02:04.580> blocks<00:02:04.960> so<00:02:05.960> it<00:02:06.110> it<00:02:06.560> should

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.010 
side with three blocks so it it should

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:08.109 
side with three blocks so it it should
be<00:02:07.040> the<00:02:07.190> side<00:02:07.369> of<00:02:07.400> three<00:02:07.640> blocks<00:02:07.850> and<00:02:08.060> you

00:02:08.109 --> 00:02:08.119 
be the side of three blocks and you

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:10.419 
be the side of three blocks and you
should<00:02:08.270> be<00:02:08.300> fit<00:02:08.660> on<00:02:08.780> this<00:02:08.990> side<00:02:09.260> so<00:02:09.530> you<00:02:10.220> should

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
should be fit on this side so you should

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:12.010 
should be fit on this side so you should
be<00:02:10.520> facing<00:02:10.670> this<00:02:10.910> way<00:02:10.970> and<00:02:11.330> the<00:02:11.600> other<00:02:11.630> block

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
be facing this way and the other block

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.080 
be facing this way and the other block
should<00:02:12.170> be<00:02:12.230> on<00:02:12.380> the<00:02:12.470> right<00:02:12.590> side<00:02:12.760> so<00:02:13.760> just<00:02:13.940> come

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
should be on the right side so just come

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.570 
should be on the right side so just come
and<00:02:14.240> put<00:02:14.390> a<00:02:14.420> torch<00:02:14.720> put<00:02:15.290> a<00:02:15.320> torch<00:02:15.680> not<00:02:16.400> right

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
and put a torch put a torch not right

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.150 
and put a torch put a torch not right
there<00:02:16.760> and<00:02:18.250> put<00:02:19.250> a<00:02:19.400> torch<00:02:19.670> right<00:02:19.820> there<00:02:20.030> and

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
there and put a torch right there and

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.560 
there and put a torch right there and
then<00:02:22.160> on<00:02:22.310> the<00:02:22.400> two<00:02:22.550> blocks<00:02:22.760> just<00:02:23.120> put<00:02:23.330> torches

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
then on the two blocks just put torches

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.600 
then on the two blocks just put torches
facing<00:02:24.140> the<00:02:24.230> other<00:02:24.320> way<00:02:24.410> now<00:02:25.250> we<00:02:25.340> can<00:02:25.459> just

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:25.610 
facing the other way now we can just

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.980 
facing the other way now we can just
connect<00:02:25.880> this<00:02:25.940> all<00:02:26.120> with<00:02:26.209> redstone<00:02:26.480> and<00:02:28.990> right

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990 
connect this all with redstone and right

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:31.270 
connect this all with redstone and right
here<00:02:30.170> you<00:02:30.260> actually<00:02:30.530> need<00:02:30.620> a<00:02:30.650> piece<00:02:31.100> of<00:02:31.130> rib

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
here you actually need a piece of rib

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.759 
here you actually need a piece of rib
down<00:02:31.580> on<00:02:31.850> top<00:02:32.120> red<00:02:32.450> sit<00:02:32.630> on<00:02:32.810> top<00:02:32.959> so<00:02:33.440> this<00:02:33.620> will

00:02:33.759 --> 00:02:33.769 
down on top red sit on top so this will

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:35.830 
down on top red sit on top so this will
actually<00:02:33.890> connect<00:02:34.370> to<00:02:34.459> this<00:02:34.580> torch<00:02:34.820> and<00:02:35.450> you

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
actually connect to this torch and you

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.660 
actually connect to this torch and you
can<00:02:35.959> see<00:02:36.140> it<00:02:36.290> starts<00:02:36.650> blinking<00:02:37.040> on<00:02:37.370> and<00:02:37.430> off<00:02:39.670> so

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
can see it starts blinking on and off so

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.370 
can see it starts blinking on and off so
this<00:02:40.880> part<00:02:41.120> right<00:02:41.180> here<00:02:41.300> is<00:02:41.690> going<00:02:41.900> to<00:02:42.019> be<00:02:42.230> the

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
this part right here is going to be the

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.880 
this part right here is going to be the
part<00:02:42.620> that<00:02:42.800> connects<00:02:43.160> to<00:02:43.250> the<00:02:44.530> note<00:02:45.530> block<00:02:45.709> you

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:45.890 
part that connects to the note block you

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:47.560 
part that connects to the note block you
can<00:02:46.010> actually<00:02:46.130> really<00:02:46.610> do<00:02:46.730> with<00:02:46.940> anything<00:02:47.209> but

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 
can actually really do with anything but

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.250 
can actually really do with anything but
I<00:02:48.260> prefer<00:02:49.120> doing<00:02:50.120> it<00:02:50.420> with<00:02:50.570> a<00:02:50.840> redstone<00:02:51.140> torch

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:51.260 
I prefer doing it with a redstone torch

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:54.850 
I prefer doing it with a redstone torch
and<00:02:52.360> I<00:02:53.360> mean<00:02:54.170> you<00:02:54.230> could<00:02:54.350> do<00:02:54.440> it<00:02:54.530> right<00:02:54.650> there

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:54.860 
and I mean you could do it right there

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.880 
and I mean you could do it right there
but<00:02:55.190> i<00:02:55.400> prefer<00:02:55.700> with<00:02:55.940> the<00:02:56.000> redstone<00:02:56.269> torch<00:02:56.510> and

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:56.890 
but i prefer with the redstone torch and

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:04.390 
but i prefer with the redstone torch and
on<00:02:57.890> the<00:02:58.880> far<00:02:59.150> side<00:03:00.640> so<00:03:02.560> that<00:03:03.560> if<00:03:03.890> we<00:03:04.010> just<00:03:04.160> put<00:03:04.370> a

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
on the far side so that if we just put a

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.500 
on the far side so that if we just put a
note<00:03:04.550> block<00:03:04.640> here<00:03:04.910> i'm<00:03:05.090> going<00:03:05.209> to<00:03:05.269> put<00:03:05.390> it<00:03:05.450> on

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
note block here i'm going to put it on

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.229 
note block here i'm going to put it on
some<00:03:05.750> wood<00:03:05.989> so<00:03:06.680> it<00:03:06.800> has<00:03:06.950> the<00:03:07.220> base<00:03:07.459> e<00:03:07.489> sound<00:03:07.910> the

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
some wood so it has the base e sound the

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:14.020 
some wood so it has the base e sound the
bass<00:03:08.420> sound<00:03:12.070> you<00:03:13.070> can<00:03:13.190> see<00:03:13.340> it<00:03:13.430> just<00:03:13.610> plays<00:03:13.850> it

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:14.030 
bass sound you can see it just plays it

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:16.870 
bass sound you can see it just plays it
every<00:03:14.350> second<00:03:15.350> or<00:03:15.410> so<00:03:15.620> or<00:03:16.400> however<00:03:16.580> long<00:03:16.700> that

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
every second or so or however long that

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.670 
every second or so or however long that
is<00:03:18.880> so<00:03:19.880> you<00:03:20.870> know<00:03:20.959> I<00:03:20.989> guess<00:03:21.260> I'll<00:03:21.380> just<00:03:21.410> leave

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:21.680 
is so you know I guess I'll just leave

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.850 
is so you know I guess I'll just leave
that

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:30.339 

might<00:03:25.860> as<00:03:25.980> well<00:03:27.019> okay<00:03:28.019> I<00:03:28.730> know<00:03:29.730> shits<00:03:30.030> annoying

00:03:30.339 --> 00:03:30.349 
might as well okay I know shits annoying

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:33.770 
might as well okay I know shits annoying
so<00:03:31.349> too<00:03:31.739> well<00:03:32.010> to<00:03:32.939> be<00:03:33.090> able<00:03:33.120> to<00:03:33.329> turn<00:03:33.450> this<00:03:33.569> on

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
so too well to be able to turn this on

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.869 
so too well to be able to turn this on
and<00:03:33.810> off<00:03:34.049> you<00:03:34.799> want<00:03:34.980> to<00:03:35.069> connect<00:03:35.459> some

00:03:35.869 --> 00:03:35.879 
and off you want to connect some

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:39.619 
and off you want to connect some
redstone<00:03:36.769> to<00:03:37.909> some<00:03:38.909> redstone<00:03:39.090> that<00:03:39.390> already

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:39.629 
redstone to some redstone that already

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:40.970 
redstone to some redstone that already
exists<00:03:39.900> you<00:03:39.989> can't<00:03:40.230> connect<00:03:40.500> it<00:03:40.620> to<00:03:40.709> a<00:03:40.739> torch

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
exists you can't connect it to a torch

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.589 
exists you can't connect it to a torch
don't<00:03:41.280> do<00:03:41.370> it<00:03:41.489> like<00:03:41.549> that<00:03:41.609> and<00:03:42.000> it<00:03:42.299> has<00:03:42.390> to<00:03:42.510> be

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:42.599 
don't do it like that and it has to be

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:45.229 
don't do it like that and it has to be
connected<00:03:42.840> to<00:03:43.079> redstone<00:03:43.379> and<00:03:43.909> you<00:03:44.909> can<00:03:45.030> you

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
connected to redstone and you can you

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:46.640 
connected to redstone and you can you
can't<00:03:45.480> really<00:03:45.720> do<00:03:45.840> it<00:03:45.870> here<00:03:46.170> because<00:03:46.409> you<00:03:46.530> can

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
can't really do it here because you can

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.890 
can't really do it here because you can
see<00:03:46.769> that<00:03:46.799> changes<00:03:47.310> the<00:03:47.430> pattern<00:03:47.640> or<00:03:48.450> so<00:03:48.750> this

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:48.900 
see that changes the pattern or so this

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.420 
see that changes the pattern or so this
redstone<00:03:49.170> no<00:03:49.349> longer<00:03:49.590> connects<00:03:50.250> to<00:03:50.370> that

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
redstone no longer connects to that

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.550 
redstone no longer connects to that
torch<00:03:50.790> so<00:03:51.390> that'll<00:03:51.659> stop<00:03:51.840> working<00:03:52.170> you<00:03:52.290> can<00:03:52.319> do

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
torch so that'll stop working you can do

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:56.559 
torch so that'll stop working you can do
there<00:03:52.859> you<00:03:53.849> can<00:03:54.060> do<00:03:54.209> it<00:03:54.299> here<00:03:54.709> like<00:03:55.709> right<00:03:55.889> here

00:03:56.559 --> 00:03:56.569 
there you can do it here like right here

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:58.759 
there you can do it here like right here
but<00:03:57.569> that's<00:03:57.720> kind<00:03:57.930> of<00:03:57.959> close<00:03:58.079> to<00:03:58.319> there<00:03:58.500> so<00:03:58.739> I

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
but that's kind of close to there so I

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:00.740 
but that's kind of close to there so I
just<00:03:58.859> can't<00:03:59.400> do<00:03:59.459> there<00:03:59.700> so<00:04:00.209> I<00:04:00.239> just<00:04:00.420> like<00:04:00.510> to<00:04:00.659> do

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
just can't do there so I just like to do

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.470 
just can't do there so I just like to do
it<00:04:00.780> on<00:04:01.019> this<00:04:01.200> side<00:04:01.909> and<00:04:02.909> of<00:04:03.090> course<00:04:03.299> it's

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
it on this side and of course it's

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.390 
it on this side and of course it's
raining<00:04:05.750> okay<00:04:06.750> so<00:04:06.810> and<00:04:07.319> another<00:04:07.950> thing<00:04:08.069> I<00:04:08.280> like

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
raining okay so and another thing I like

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:13.910 
raining okay so and another thing I like
to<00:04:08.459> do<00:04:08.670> is<00:04:08.879> I<00:04:08.909> like<00:04:09.030> to<00:04:09.239> put<00:04:09.689> a<00:04:11.750> repeater<00:04:12.920> like

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
to do is I like to put a repeater like

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.050 
to do is I like to put a repeater like
this<00:04:14.870> and<00:04:16.220> then<00:04:17.220> I<00:04:17.340> like<00:04:17.489> to<00:04:17.639> connect<00:04:17.910> that

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
this and then I like to connect that

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:23.620 
this and then I like to connect that
repeater<00:04:18.359> 2<00:04:18.829> i'm<00:04:19.829> at<00:04:19.979> a<00:04:20.010> redstone<00:04:20.340> to<00:04:21.180> a<00:04:21.209> lover

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:29.839 

so<00:04:24.630> where's<00:04:25.139> my<00:04:25.320> liver<00:04:27.440> and<00:04:28.440> now<00:04:29.400> when<00:04:29.550> we<00:04:29.639> flip

00:04:29.839 --> 00:04:29.849 
so where's my liver and now when we flip

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:33.939 
so where's my liver and now when we flip
the<00:04:30.020> switch<00:04:31.020> you<00:04:31.949> can<00:04:32.070> see<00:04:32.160> it<00:04:32.250> turns<00:04:32.430> on<00:04:32.610> and

00:04:33.939 --> 00:04:33.949 
the switch you can see it turns on and

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:36.230 
the switch you can see it turns on and
the<00:04:34.949> reason<00:04:35.160> i<00:04:35.220> like<00:04:35.370> to<00:04:35.460> connect<00:04:35.699> to<00:04:35.910> repeater

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
the reason i like to connect to repeater

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.480 
the reason i like to connect to repeater
is<00:04:36.440> because<00:04:37.440> if<00:04:37.560> we<00:04:37.650> do<00:04:37.770> it<00:04:37.860> like<00:04:37.919> this<00:04:38.099> you<00:04:38.310> can

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
is because if we do it like this you can

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.760 
is because if we do it like this you can
see<00:04:38.669> it<00:04:38.789> actually<00:04:39.199> flips<00:04:40.199> this<00:04:40.349> on<00:04:40.560> and<00:04:40.710> off

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
see it actually flips this on and off

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:42.830 
see it actually flips this on and off
and<00:04:40.800> i<00:04:41.039> think<00:04:41.190> that<00:04:41.340> looks<00:04:41.729> kind<00:04:42.000> of<00:04:42.150> weird<00:04:42.419> and

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:42.840 
and i think that looks kind of weird and

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:45.080 
and i think that looks kind of weird and
I<00:04:43.770> mean<00:04:43.949> it<00:04:44.430> doesn't<00:04:44.729> really<00:04:44.820> make<00:04:45.030> any

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
I mean it doesn't really make any

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:46.969 
I mean it doesn't really make any
difference<00:04:45.479> but<00:04:46.349> this<00:04:46.500> is<00:04:46.650> just<00:04:46.680> my<00:04:46.949> personal

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:46.979 
difference but this is just my personal

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:49.490 
difference but this is just my personal
preference<00:04:47.780> so<00:04:48.780> you<00:04:48.840> can<00:04:49.050> do<00:04:49.139> it<00:04:49.199> without<00:04:49.289> the

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:49.500 
preference so you can do it without the

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:50.689 
preference so you can do it without the
repeater<00:04:49.770> you<00:04:49.979> can<00:04:50.070> do<00:04:50.159> it<00:04:50.220> with<00:04:50.340> it<00:04:50.460> what<00:04:50.580> if

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:50.699 
repeater you can do it with it what if

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:54.700 
repeater you can do it with it what if
you<00:04:50.789> want<00:04:50.970> and<00:04:52.550> so<00:04:53.550> when<00:04:53.699> you<00:04:53.760> flip<00:04:53.909> the<00:04:54.000> switch

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:54.710 
you want and so when you flip the switch

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:58.089 
you want and so when you flip the switch
you<00:04:55.710> can<00:04:55.800> see<00:04:55.979> this<00:04:56.400> torch<00:04:57.090> turns<00:04:57.389> off<00:04:57.570> and

00:04:58.089 --> 00:04:58.099 
you can see this torch turns off and

00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:02.110 
you can see this torch turns off and
they<00:04:59.099> re<00:04:59.340> the<00:04:59.849> clock<00:05:00.090> will<00:05:00.270> start<00:05:00.560> ticking<00:05:01.560> and

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
they re the clock will start ticking and

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:07.640 
they re the clock will start ticking and
I'll<00:05:03.120> just<00:05:03.240> put<00:05:03.389> this<00:05:03.479> back

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:07.650 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:10.159 

you<00:05:08.650> don't<00:05:08.800> hear<00:05:08.889> the<00:05:09.009> note<00:05:09.130> block<00:05:09.280> anymore

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:10.169 
you don't hear the note block anymore

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:17.159 
you don't hear the note block anymore
you<00:05:11.169> can<00:05:11.350> note<00:05:11.590> block<00:05:13.050> so<00:05:14.050> basically<00:05:16.020> you<00:05:17.020> can

00:05:17.159 --> 00:05:17.169 
you can note block so basically you can

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:18.740 
you can note block so basically you can
use<00:05:17.289> pressure<00:05:17.560> plates<00:05:17.860> to<00:05:17.949> trigger<00:05:18.190> this<00:05:18.400> or

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:18.750 
use pressure plates to trigger this or

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:21.240 
use pressure plates to trigger this or
really<00:05:19.750> anything<00:05:20.139> if<00:05:20.740> you<00:05:20.949> want<00:05:21.100> to<00:05:21.160> use

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:21.250 
really anything if you want to use

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:23.070 
really anything if you want to use
pressure<00:05:21.460> plates<00:05:21.729> to<00:05:21.850> trigger<00:05:22.090> this<00:05:22.240> you

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.080 
pressure plates to trigger this you

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:24.779 
pressure plates to trigger this you
could<00:05:23.229> just<00:05:23.500> have<00:05:23.919> the<00:05:24.160> pressure<00:05:24.430> plate<00:05:24.610> to

00:05:24.779 --> 00:05:24.789 
could just have the pressure plate to

00:05:24.789 --> 00:05:27.060 
could just have the pressure plate to
connect<00:05:25.030> to<00:05:25.090> an<00:05:25.210> RS<00:05:25.419> nor<00:05:25.570> latch<00:05:25.630> and<00:05:26.050> then<00:05:26.919> they

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:27.070 
connect to an RS nor latch and then they

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:29.370 
connect to an RS nor latch and then they
would<00:05:27.250> it<00:05:27.880> would<00:05:28.030> turn<00:05:28.509> the<00:05:28.600> RS<00:05:28.810> nor<00:05:28.900> latch<00:05:28.960> on

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:29.380 
would it would turn the RS nor latch on

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:32.159 
would it would turn the RS nor latch on
and<00:05:29.650> would<00:05:29.919> keep<00:05:30.250> it<00:05:30.400> on<00:05:30.520> because<00:05:31.360> remember<00:05:31.810> RS

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:32.169 
and would keep it on because remember RS

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:34.890 
and would keep it on because remember RS
nor<00:05:32.289> latch<00:05:32.440> is<00:05:33.180> if<00:05:34.180> when<00:05:34.479> you<00:05:34.539> change<00:05:34.780> the

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:34.900 
nor latch is if when you change the

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.210 
nor latch is if when you change the
state<00:05:35.110> they<00:05:35.259> will<00:05:35.410> stay<00:05:35.560> that<00:05:35.590> state<00:05:35.949> forever

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:36.220 
state they will stay that state forever

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:39.540 
state they will stay that state forever
or<00:05:36.490> until<00:05:36.550> you<00:05:36.850> switch<00:05:37.060> it<00:05:37.120> back<00:05:37.470> so<00:05:38.470> this<00:05:39.280> does

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:39.550 
or until you switch it back so this does

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:43.170 
or until you switch it back so this does
need<00:05:39.580> to<00:05:39.789> be<00:05:39.910> on<00:05:40.120> at<00:05:40.360> all<00:05:40.510> times<00:05:40.720> or<00:05:41.680> I<00:05:42.180> guess

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:43.180 
need to be on at all times or I guess

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:48.980 
need to be on at all times or I guess
off<00:05:43.660> if<00:05:44.410> you're<00:05:44.710> inverting<00:05:44.949> the<00:05:45.160> power<00:05:45.510> um<00:05:47.100> so

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:48.990 
off if you're inverting the power um so

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:52.439 
off if you're inverting the power um so
yeah<00:05:50.550> when<00:05:51.550> you<00:05:51.639> want<00:05:51.760> to<00:05:51.820> turn<00:05:51.880> it<00:05:52.030> off<00:05:52.150> just

00:05:52.439 --> 00:05:52.449 
yeah when you want to turn it off just

00:05:52.449 --> 00:05:54.540 
yeah when you want to turn it off just
give<00:05:52.900> it<00:05:53.020> power<00:05:53.199> and<00:05:53.710> that'll<00:05:54.190> turn<00:05:54.310> enough

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:54.550 
give it power and that'll turn enough

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:56.610 
give it power and that'll turn enough
and<00:05:54.789> get<00:05:55.780> rid<00:05:55.900> of<00:05:55.960> the<00:05:56.020> power<00:05:56.229> when<00:05:56.440> you<00:05:56.500> want

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:56.620 
and get rid of the power when you want

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:00.029 
and get rid of the power when you want
to<00:05:56.680> turn<00:05:56.740> it<00:05:56.919> on<00:05:57.539> so<00:05:58.539> anyway<00:05:59.010> thanks<00:06:00.010> for

00:06:00.029 --> 00:06:00.039 
to turn it on so anyway thanks for

00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:03.420 
to turn it on so anyway thanks for
watching<00:06:00.400> hope<00:06:00.669> this<00:06:00.910> helped<00:06:01.150> you<00:06:01.210> and<00:06:02.430> I'll
