00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:02:16.070 

think<00:01:52.880> inside<00:01:53.300> square<00:01:53.630> is<00:01:53.870> gonna<00:01:54.080> be<00:01:54.200> next

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:40.890 

outside<00:02:17.080> squares

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:40.900 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:46.270 

man<00:02:41.900> I'll<00:02:42.109> tell<00:02:42.319> you<00:02:42.439> you<00:02:42.650> know<00:02:44.859> we<00:02:45.859> just<00:02:46.040> watch

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
man I'll tell you you know we just watch

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.009 
man I'll tell you you know we just watch
the<00:02:46.609> Strega<00:02:46.939> fly<00:02:47.269> the<00:02:47.329> Stricker<00:02:47.719> is<00:02:47.840> like

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:48.019 
the Strega fly the Stricker is like

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:51.369 
the Strega fly the Stricker is like
twice<00:02:48.530> as<00:02:48.799> big<00:02:49.069> as<00:02:49.250> the<00:02:49.280> nobler<00:02:49.989> they<00:02:50.989> do<00:02:51.049> this

00:02:51.369 --> 00:02:51.379 
twice as big as the nobler they do this

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:58.030 
twice as big as the nobler they do this
soon<00:02:51.650> they<00:02:52.040> both<00:02:52.219> do<00:02:52.400> the<00:02:52.459> same<00:02:52.579> job<00:02:56.739> done<00:02:57.739> the

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
soon they both do the same job done the

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.619 
soon they both do the same job done the
trend<00:02:58.340> is<00:02:58.519> certainly<00:02:58.700> for<00:02:59.150> much<00:02:59.389> larger

00:02:59.619 --> 00:02:59.629 
trend is certainly for much larger

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:07.480 
trend is certainly for much larger
airplanes<00:03:00.319> nowadays

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:07.490 

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:09.950 

but<00:03:08.490> everybody<00:03:08.910> you<00:03:09.120> know<00:03:09.210> even<00:03:09.570> if<00:03:09.660> they<00:03:09.810> got

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:09.960 
but everybody you know even if they got

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.220 
but everybody you know even if they got
the<00:03:10.140> biggest<00:03:10.470> most<00:03:10.620> powerful<00:03:11.190> model<00:03:11.340> airplane

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:12.230 
the biggest most powerful model airplane

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:19.250 
the biggest most powerful model airplane
they<00:03:13.230> quit<00:03:13.470> flying<00:03:13.710> when<00:03:13.920> it<00:03:14.040> gets<00:03:14.190> windy<00:03:18.260> so

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
they quit flying when it gets windy so

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:24.640 
they quit flying when it gets windy so
I'm<00:03:19.500> not<00:03:19.680> too<00:03:19.920> sure<00:03:20.130> about<00:03:20.160> all<00:03:20.550> that<00:03:20.730> power

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.290 

you<00:03:25.650> can't<00:03:26.280> keep<00:03:26.460> track<00:03:26.760> for<00:03:26.970> that<00:03:27.000> light

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
you can't keep track for that light

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:32.110 
you can't keep track for that light
airplane<00:03:27.510> like<00:03:27.900> that<00:03:28.200> there<00:03:29.100> we<00:03:29.220> go

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:44.930 

horizontal<00:03:33.120> squirt

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:54.860 

yeah<00:03:45.510> we're<00:03:46.200> looking<00:03:46.500> for<00:03:46.710> vertical<00:03:47.040> 8<00:03:47.250> now

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:54.870 

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:02.500 

he<00:03:55.620> stands<00:03:55.950> that<00:03:56.190> up<00:03:56.430> pretty<00:03:56.670> good

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:02.510 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.170 

hmm<00:04:03.920> he<00:04:04.920> was<00:04:05.040> down<00:04:05.220> on<00:04:05.250> the<00:04:05.490> ground<00:04:05.550> at<00:04:06.060> the

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
hmm he was down on the ground at the

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:09.040 
hmm he was down on the ground at the
bottom<00:04:06.480> of<00:04:06.569> that<00:04:06.600> first<00:04:06.990> inside<00:04:07.500> loop

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:09.050 
bottom of that first inside loop

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:23.390 
bottom of that first inside loop
hourglass<00:04:10.050> now<00:04:17.000> flipping<00:04:18.000> down<00:04:18.359> along<00:04:22.370> see<00:04:23.370> I

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:23.400 
hourglass now flipping down along see I

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.460 
hourglass now flipping down along see I
think<00:04:24.000> we're<00:04:24.150> gonna<00:04:24.270> go<00:04:24.480> for<00:04:24.840> overhead<00:04:25.230> aides

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:25.470 
think we're gonna go for overhead aides

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:52.080 
think we're gonna go for overhead aides
next<00:04:29.480> yeah

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:52.090 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:54.850 

well<00:04:53.090> I<00:04:53.120> wonder<00:04:53.420> how<00:04:53.570> much<00:04:53.810> Rick<00:04:54.110> paid<00:04:54.410> Dave<00:04:54.680> to

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 
well I wonder how much Rick paid Dave to
