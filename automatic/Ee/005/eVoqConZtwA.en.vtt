00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
six times zero equals zero since she

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.880 
six times zero equals zero since she
played<00:00:39.690> a<00:00:39.719> card<00:00:39.989> she<00:00:40.289> gets<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.590> go<00:00:40.710> again<00:00:41.010> and

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
played this card I get to go again this

played this card I get to go again this
time<00:01:17.310> drive<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.120> nine<00:01:18.650> it's<00:01:19.650> nine<00:01:19.830> plus<00:01:20.100> zero<00:01:20.460> is

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
time drive a nine it's nine plus zero is

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.620 
time drive a nine it's nine plus zero is
nine<00:01:21.000> I<00:01:21.330> can<00:01:21.930> play<00:01:22.050> the<00:01:22.170> nine<00:01:22.350> there<00:01:22.650> and

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
nine I can play the nine there and

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.690 
nine I can play the nine there and
continue<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:24.720> play<00:01:25.100> this<00:01:26.100> time<00:01:26.280> I<00:01:26.340> drew<00:01:26.670> a

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
continue to play this time I drew a

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.900 
continue to play this time I drew a
seven<00:01:27.210> and<00:01:28.020> nine<00:01:28.260> minus<00:01:28.710> two<00:01:28.920> is<00:01:29.070> seven<00:01:29.370> so<00:01:29.820> I

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:29.910 
seven and nine minus two is seven so I

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:34.670 
seven and nine minus two is seven so I
can<00:01:30.060> play<00:01:30.210> the<00:01:30.300> seven<00:01:30.660> in<00:01:30.960> this<00:01:31.110> location<00:01:33.680> this

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
can play the seven in this location this

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:35.750 
can play the seven in this location this
time<00:01:34.740> I<00:01:34.950> drew<00:01:35.250> a<00:01:35.280> zero

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:35.760 
time I drew a zero

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.910 
time I drew a zero
and<00:01:36.150> just<00:01:36.750> like<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:37.050> six<00:01:37.260> times<00:01:37.470> zero<00:01:37.680> equals

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
and just like the six times zero equals

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.740 
and just like the six times zero equals
zero<00:01:38.370> there<00:01:38.820> I<00:01:38.850> can<00:01:39.090> play<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.390> zero

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
zero there I can play the zero

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:47.690 
zero there I can play the zero
Oh<00:01:45.350> or<00:01:46.350> I<00:01:46.410> can<00:01:46.710> play<00:01:46.830> at<00:01:47.010> 8<00:01:47.190> minus<00:01:47.550> 8<00:01:47.670> equals

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
Oh or I can play at 8 minus 8 equals

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.400 
Oh or I can play at 8 minus 8 equals
zero<00:01:48.180> so<00:01:48.210> I<00:01:48.390> could<00:01:48.540> play<00:01:48.660> it<00:01:48.720> at<00:01:48.810> this<00:01:48.900> location

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:49.410 
zero so I could play it at this location

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:54.609 
zero so I could play it at this location
also<00:01:49.580> so<00:01:50.580> I<00:01:50.610> could<00:01:50.820> play<00:01:50.940> it<00:01:51.030> either<00:01:51.120> place

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:59.770 

and<00:01:55.359> 1/8<00:01:56.359> divided<00:01:57.229> by<00:01:57.500> 8<00:01:57.799> is<00:01:58.759> equal<00:01:58.969> to<00:01:59.149> 1<00:01:59.420> so<00:01:59.750> I

00:01:59.770 --> 00:01:59.780 
and 1/8 divided by 8 is equal to 1 so I

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:07.990 
and 1/8 divided by 8 is equal to 1 so I
can<00:01:59.869> play<00:02:00.140> the<00:02:00.289> 1<00:02:00.469> here<00:02:03.640> 8<00:02:04.640> 2<00:02:05.060> minus<00:02:05.450> 1<00:02:06.759> equals<00:02:07.759> 1

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
can play the 1 here 8 2 minus 1 equals 1

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.430 
can play the 1 here 8 2 minus 1 equals 1
so<00:02:08.269> I<00:02:08.300> can<00:02:08.509> play<00:02:08.599> the<00:02:08.720> 1<00:02:08.899> there<00:02:09.640> and<00:02:11.379> this<00:02:12.379> time

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
so I can play the 1 there and this time

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.789 
so I can play the 1 there and this time
I<00:02:12.739> draw<00:02:12.950> 3<00:02:13.370> and<00:02:13.940> I<00:02:14.060> have<00:02:14.269> no<00:02:14.540> play<00:02:14.810> for<00:02:15.049> 3

00:02:15.789 --> 00:02:15.799 
I draw 3 and I have no play for 3

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:19.210 
I draw 3 and I have no play for 3
so<00:02:16.370> my<00:02:16.970> streak<00:02:17.540> has<00:02:17.690> come<00:02:17.900> to<00:02:18.080> an<00:02:18.170> end<00:02:18.290> but<00:02:19.160> I

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:19.220 
so my streak has come to an end but I

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.100 
so my streak has come to an end but I
can<00:02:19.400> lay<00:02:19.549> down<00:02:19.580> the<00:02:19.849> card<00:02:20.090> and<00:02:20.750> now<00:02:20.900> it's

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
can lay down the card and now it's

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.729 
can lay down the card and now it's
Anna's<00:02:21.470> turn<00:02:22.450> and<00:02:23.450> I<00:02:23.599> can<00:02:23.750> either<00:02:23.900> draw<00:02:24.260> the<00:02:24.319> 3

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:24.739 
Anna's turn and I can either draw the 3

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:28.180 
Anna's turn and I can either draw the 3
if<00:02:24.920> she<00:02:25.099> has<00:02:25.280> a<00:02:25.310> play<00:02:25.730> or<00:02:26.739> she<00:02:27.739> can<00:02:27.890> draw<00:02:28.040> from

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
if she has a play or she can draw from

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:35.500 
if she has a play or she can draw from
the<00:02:28.370> deck<00:02:33.549> she'll<00:02:34.549> show<00:02:34.790> her<00:02:34.910> card<00:02:35.180> so<00:02:35.480> that

00:02:37.539 --> 00:02:37.549 
you can see what she got and this time

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:40.059 
you can see what she got and this time
she<00:02:37.730> has<00:02:37.880> a<00:02:37.910> 4<00:02:38.299> so<00:02:39.200> she's<00:02:39.379> gonna<00:02:39.560> look<00:02:39.769> for<00:02:40.010> a

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:40.069 
she has a 4 so she's gonna look for a

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:42.850 
she has a 4 so she's gonna look for a
place<00:02:40.099> where<00:02:40.849> she<00:02:41.030> can<00:02:41.180> play<00:02:41.360> it<00:02:41.480> for<00:02:41.690> and<00:02:42.620> as

place where she can play it for and as

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:45.069 
place where she can play it for and as
you're<00:02:43.400> working<00:02:43.579> through<00:02:43.819> figuring<00:02:44.810> up<00:02:44.930> where

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:45.079 
you're working through figuring up where

you're working through figuring up where
to<00:02:45.140> play<00:02:45.319> a<00:02:45.349> 4

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
to play a 4

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.750 
to play a 4
she<00:02:47.150> would<00:02:47.269> she<00:02:47.480> can<00:02:47.599> look<00:02:47.750> at<00:02:47.870> 8<00:02:48.160> plus<00:02:49.160> 8<00:02:49.400> which

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
she would she can look at 8 plus 8 which

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:56.470 
she would she can look at 8 plus 8 which
is<00:02:50.540> 16<00:02:51.640> 8<00:02:52.640> divided<00:02:53.329> by<00:02:53.360> 8<00:02:53.690> which<00:02:53.750> is<00:02:53.989> 1<00:02:54.700> 8<00:02:55.700> times

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
is 16 8 divided by 8 which is 1 8 times

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:00.699 
is 16 8 divided by 8 which is 1 8 times
8<00:02:56.900> which<00:02:57.260> is<00:02:57.890> 64<00:02:58.489> and<00:02:58.900> that's<00:02:59.900> why<00:03:00.319> she's<00:03:00.590> able

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
8 which is 64 and that's why she's able

we're<00:04:05.950> both<00:04:06.160> in<00:04:06.370> a<00:04:06.489> situation<00:04:06.700> where<00:04:07.390> we're

we're both in a situation where we're

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:09.960 
we're both in a situation where we're
looking<00:04:07.720> for<00:04:07.930> a<00:04:08.440> nine<00:04:08.980> because<00:04:09.459> she<00:04:09.760> has<00:04:09.940> a

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:09.970

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:14.670 
nine here and I have an on here or a
zero<00:04:12.360> so<00:04:13.360> we<00:04:13.840> may<00:04:13.989> be<00:04:14.020> drawing<00:04:14.349> through<00:04:14.620> the

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
zero so we may be drawing through the

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.509 
zero so we may be drawing through the
deck<00:04:14.860> looking<00:04:15.489> for<00:04:15.730> the<00:04:15.849> nine<00:04:17.280> which<00:04:18.280> may<00:04:18.459> be

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:24.240 

but<00:04:22.990> it<00:04:23.080> does<00:04:23.230> make<00:04:23.380> the<00:04:23.500> play<00:04:23.680> go<00:04:23.860> very<00:04:24.070> fast

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
but it does make the play go very fast

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:26.879 
but it does make the play go very fast
as<00:04:24.520> we<00:04:24.639> each<00:04:24.820> look<00:04:25.060> for<00:04:25.270> the<00:04:25.330> nine<00:04:25.540> now<00:04:26.139> whoever

as we each look for the nine now whoever

00:04:26.889 --> 00:04:28.650 
as we each look for the nine now whoever
gets<00:04:27.130> the<00:04:27.280> nine<00:04:27.430> first<00:04:27.730> is<00:04:28.060> going<00:04:28.540> to<00:04:28.600> be

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660 
gets the nine first is going to be

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:41.690 
gets the nine first is going to be
pretty<00:04:28.930> lucky<00:04:32.669> we're<00:04:33.669> not<00:04:34.090> finding<00:04:34.630> the<00:04:34.780> nine

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
who do you think will find the nine

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:55.560 
who do you think will find the nine
first<00:04:45.980> probably<00:04:46.980> Kanna

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:55.570

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:07.129 

I<00:05:02.909> found<00:05:03.779> a<00:05:03.959> nine<00:05:04.759> so<00:05:05.759> now<00:05:06.449> I'll<00:05:06.569> play<00:05:06.749> the<00:05:06.929> zero

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:07.139 
I found a nine so now I'll play the zero

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:11.899 
I found a nine so now I'll play the zero
plus<00:05:07.349> 9<00:05:07.589> equals<00:05:07.979> 9<00:05:08.969> and<00:05:09.929> now<00:05:10.469> on<00:05:10.709> 9<00:05:10.919> times<00:05:11.249> 7<00:05:11.550> is

00:05:11.899 --> 00:05:11.909 
plus 9 equals 9 and now on 9 times 7 is

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:21.589 
plus 9 equals 9 and now on 9 times 7 is
63<00:05:12.499> Oh<00:05:14.839> 9<00:05:15.839> 9<00:05:16.050> 9<00:05:16.529> times<00:05:16.860> 7<00:05:18.110> 9<00:05:19.110> minus<00:05:19.409> 7<00:05:19.649> is<00:05:19.770> 2<00:05:20.389> but<00:05:21.389> I

00:05:21.589 --> 00:05:21.599 
63 Oh 9 9 9 times 7 9 minus 7 is 2 but I

00:05:21.599 --> 00:05:23.929 
63 Oh 9 9 9 times 7 9 minus 7 is 2 but I
don't<00:05:21.839> have<00:05:21.929> it<00:05:21.990> to<00:05:22.169> I<00:05:22.199> have<00:05:22.439> a<00:05:22.469> 3<00:05:23.039> so<00:05:23.309> 9<00:05:23.459> times<00:05:23.699> 7

00:05:23.929 --> 00:05:23.939 
don't have it to I have a 3 so 9 times 7

00:05:23.939 --> 00:05:29.299 
don't have it to I have a 3 so 9 times 7
is<00:05:24.149> 63<00:05:24.619> now<00:05:25.619> I<00:05:25.649> have<00:05:26.039> a<00:05:26.069> 6<00:05:26.369> and<00:05:26.580> a<00:05:26.639> 3<00:05:26.669> here<00:05:27.209> so<00:05:28.309> I'm

00:05:29.299 --> 00:05:29.309 
is 63 now I have a 6 and a 3 here so I'm

00:05:29.309 --> 00:05:31.999 
is 63 now I have a 6 and a 3 here so I'm
looking<00:05:29.699> for<00:05:29.939> 6<00:05:30.240> plus<00:05:30.419> 3<00:05:30.659> equals<00:05:30.929> 9<00:05:31.110> 6<00:05:31.679> minus<00:05:31.979> 3

00:05:31.999 --> 00:05:32.009 
looking for 6 plus 3 equals 9 6 minus 3

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:34.279 
looking for 6 plus 3 equals 9 6 minus 3
equals<00:05:32.399> 3<00:05:32.459> 6<00:05:32.879> divided<00:05:33.119> by<00:05:33.149> 3<00:05:33.509> equals<00:05:33.539> 2<00:05:34.020> so<00:05:34.229> I

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:34.289 
equals 3 6 divided by 3 equals 2 so I

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:36.399 
equals 3 6 divided by 3 equals 2 so I
have<00:05:34.349> a<00:05:34.469> number<00:05:34.649> of<00:05:34.770> things<00:05:34.919> that<00:05:35.069> I<00:05:35.159> can<00:05:35.339> play

00:05:36.399 --> 00:05:36.409

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:41.359 
have a number of things that I can play
6<00:05:37.409> times<00:05:37.619> 3<00:05:37.849> being<00:05:38.849> 18<00:05:39.509> I<00:05:39.779> drew<00:05:40.469> a<00:05:40.499> 9<00:05:40.769> but<00:05:41.189> now<00:05:41.339> I

00:05:41.359 --> 00:05:41.369 
6 times 3 being 18 I drew a 9 but now I

00:05:41.369 --> 00:05:43.399 
6 times 3 being 18 I drew a 9 but now I
don't<00:05:41.519> have<00:05:41.699> oh<00:05:41.969> I<00:05:41.999> do<00:05:42.119> have<00:05:42.330> a<00:05:42.389> play<00:05:42.569> for<00:05:42.779> a<00:05:42.809> 9<00:05:42.990> 6
