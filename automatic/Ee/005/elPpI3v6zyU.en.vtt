all of which are 101 words along so I

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.090 
all of which are 101 words along so I
just<00:02:54.550> thought<00:02:54.959> if<00:02:55.959> this<00:02:56.140> is<00:02:56.320> done<00:02:56.500> well<00:02:56.800> it

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
just thought if this is done well it

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.680 
just thought if this is done well it
will<00:02:57.280> be<00:02:57.400> really<00:02:57.580> interesting<00:02:57.700> because<00:02:58.180> it's

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
will be really interesting because it's

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.260 
will be really interesting because it's
hard<00:02:58.990> to<00:02:59.230> pack<00:02:59.440> a<00:02:59.740> lot<00:03:00.370> of<00:03:00.520> meaning<00:03:00.910> in<00:03:00.940> such<00:03:01.240> a

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.270 
hard to pack a lot of meaning in such a

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:03.990 
hard to pack a lot of meaning in such a
small<00:03:01.510> space<00:03:01.690> so<00:03:02.380> we'll<00:03:02.709> see<00:03:02.860> how<00:03:03.100> well<00:03:03.700> he's

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
small space so we'll see how well he's

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.910 
small space so we'll see how well he's
done<00:03:04.180> the<00:03:04.450> next<00:03:04.600> book<00:03:04.840> is<00:03:05.050> the<00:03:05.380> breaking<00:03:05.770> of

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.680 
takes years and years because she has to

wait for the wood to dry out and then

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.360 
wait for the wood to dry out and then
obviously<00:04:10.900> the<00:04:11.320> crafting<00:04:11.709> of<00:04:11.799> the<00:04:11.920> instrument

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370
