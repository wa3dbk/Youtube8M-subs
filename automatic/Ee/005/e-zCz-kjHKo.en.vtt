00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
sailing away okay so I have half of the

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.990 
sailing away okay so I have half of the
ceiling<00:01:58.520> sanded<00:02:00.320> it's<00:02:01.320> a<00:02:01.500> lot<00:02:01.799> of<00:02:01.829> work<00:02:02.369> don't

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
ceiling sanded it's a lot of work don't

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.429 
ceiling sanded it's a lot of work don't
ever<00:02:03.680> sand<00:02:04.680> a<00:02:04.979> ceiling<00:02:05.750> it's<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:06.899> dumbest

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
ever sand a ceiling it's the dumbest

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.180 
ever sand a ceiling it's the dumbest
idea<00:02:07.950> ever<00:02:08.009> so<00:02:09.140> the<00:02:10.140> problem<00:02:10.590> is<00:02:10.649> we<00:02:10.890> filled

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190 
idea ever so the problem is we filled

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.290 
idea ever so the problem is we filled
all<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.370> wood<00:02:11.700> hold

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
all the wood hold

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.640 
all the wood hold
all<00:02:12.570> the<00:02:12.780> nail<00:02:12.990> holes<00:02:13.290> wood<00:02:14.070> putty<00:02:14.330> and<00:02:15.650> how

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
all the nail holes wood putty and how

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.580 
all the nail holes wood putty and how
they<00:02:16.950> all<00:02:17.130> look<00:02:17.370> like<00:02:17.400> that<00:02:17.850> so<00:02:18.470> if<00:02:19.470> I<00:02:19.530> don't

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
they all look like that so if I don't

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:22.640 
they all look like that so if I don't
sand<00:02:20.130> them<00:02:20.420> then<00:02:21.420> they're<00:02:21.570> gonna<00:02:21.690> look<00:02:22.470> like

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
sand them then they're gonna look like

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.870 
sand them then they're gonna look like
that<00:02:23.330> so<00:02:24.330> I<00:02:24.870> would<00:02:25.830> suggest<00:02:25.980> not<00:02:26.400> filling<00:02:26.850> the

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:26.880 
that so I would suggest not filling the

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.180 
that so I would suggest not filling the
wood<00:02:27.120> holes

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
wood holes

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.620 
wood holes
I<00:02:29.220> could<00:02:29.640> probably<00:02:29.910> spots<00:02:30.900> and<00:02:31.230> each<00:02:31.590> hole

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
I could probably spots and each hole

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.000 
I could probably spots and each hole
maybe<00:02:33.630> that<00:02:33.870> would<00:02:33.990> be<00:02:34.020> better<00:02:34.140> maybe<00:02:34.710> that's

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
maybe that would be better maybe that's

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.530 
maybe that would be better maybe that's
what<00:02:35.160> I'll<00:02:35.250> do<00:02:35.400> on<00:02:35.430> this<00:02:35.670> side<00:02:36.800> take<00:02:37.800> a<00:02:37.860> hand

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540 
what I'll do on this side take a hand

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.260 
what I'll do on this side take a hand
sander<00:02:39.740> just<00:02:40.740> you<00:02:41.280> know<00:02:41.400> go<00:02:41.640> at<00:02:41.790> each<00:02:41.940> nail

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
sander just you know go at each nail

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.130 
sander just you know go at each nail
hole<00:02:42.540> and<00:02:42.870> call<00:02:43.500> it<00:02:43.650> a<00:02:43.680> day<00:02:43.920> but<00:02:44.960> it<00:02:45.960> almost

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
hole and call it a day but it almost

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.200 
hole and call it a day but it almost
seems<00:02:46.440> easier<00:02:47.040> to<00:02:47.190> just<00:02:47.370> take<00:02:47.580> the<00:02:47.760> orbital

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.210 
seems easier to just take the orbital

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.120 
seems easier to just take the orbital
just<00:02:48.480> go<00:02:48.660> over<00:02:48.840> the<00:02:48.990> whole<00:02:49.140> thing<00:02:49.170> just<00:02:49.830> cuz<00:02:50.010> it

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
just go over the whole thing just cuz it

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.260 
just go over the whole thing just cuz it
knocks<00:02:50.310> down<00:02:50.580> the<00:02:50.640> high<00:02:50.910> spots

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.270 
knocks down the high spots

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.520 
knocks down the high spots
anyway<00:02:54.270> now<00:02:54.660> everything's<00:02:55.050> coming<00:02:55.440> to

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
anyway now everything's coming to

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.550 
anyway now everything's coming to
sawdust<00:02:56.040> my<00:02:57.000> shoulders<00:02:57.510> are<00:02:57.690> killing<00:02:57.720> me<00:02:58.350> and

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
sawdust my shoulders are killing me and

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.150 
sawdust my shoulders are killing me and
I<00:02:59.370> got<00:02:59.520> out<00:02:59.670> more<00:03:00.120> than<00:03:00.330> half<00:03:00.570> of<00:03:00.930> the<00:03:01.800> ceiling

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
I got out more than half of the ceiling

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.450 
I got out more than half of the ceiling
-<00:03:02.430> then<00:03:03.090> when<00:03:03.840> I'm<00:03:03.930> done<00:03:03.960> that<00:03:04.350> I'm<00:03:05.130> gonna<00:03:05.310> do

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:05.460 
- then when I'm done that I'm gonna do

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:09.770 
- then when I'm done that I'm gonna do
the<00:03:05.580> whole<00:03:05.730> thing<00:03:05.760> in<00:03:06.510> Spain<00:03:08.570> that's<00:03:09.570> the

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:09.780 
the whole thing in Spain that's the

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.430 
the whole thing in Spain that's the
surprise<00:03:10.760> and<00:03:11.760> once<00:03:12.030> I<00:03:12.120> do<00:03:12.240> that<00:03:12.270> then<00:03:13.140> I<00:03:13.170> have

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
surprise and once I do that then I have

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.380 
surprise and once I do that then I have
to<00:03:13.620> pull<00:03:13.830> here<00:03:14.040> I<00:03:14.100> think<00:03:14.370> oh<00:03:14.520> wow<00:03:14.790> I<00:03:15.090> have<00:03:15.270> to

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
to pull here I think oh wow I have to

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.000 
to pull here I think oh wow I have to
wipe<00:03:15.570> it<00:03:15.780> all<00:03:15.900> down<00:03:15.930> and<00:03:16.440> then<00:03:16.560> pull<00:03:16.830> your

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
wipe it all down and then pull your

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:22.220 
wipe it all down and then pull your
thing<00:03:17.280> I<00:03:18.290> guess<00:03:19.290> this<00:03:19.500> is<00:03:19.680> the<00:03:19.709> most<00:03:21.230> strength

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
thing I guess this is the most strength

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.500 
thing I guess this is the most strength
intensive<00:03:23.160> part<00:03:23.489> because<00:03:23.910> I<00:03:24.000> have<00:03:24.180> to<00:03:24.300> hold

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
intensive part because I have to hold

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.650 
intensive part because I have to hold
that<00:03:24.660> sander<00:03:25.200> up<00:03:25.680> above<00:03:26.160> my<00:03:26.340> head<00:03:26.550> and<00:03:26.880> push<00:03:27.510> it

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
that sander up above my head and push it

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.229 
that sander up above my head and push it
against<00:03:27.870> the<00:03:28.020> ceiling<00:03:28.260> and<00:03:28.830> it's<00:03:29.760> just<00:03:29.940> really

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
against the ceiling and it's just really

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:33.979 
against the ceiling and it's just really
tiring<00:03:30.630> so<00:03:32.090> anyway<00:03:33.090> I'm<00:03:33.420> going<00:03:33.480> to<00:03:33.690> go<00:03:33.750> get

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
tiring so anyway I'm going to go get

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:40.550 
tiring so anyway I'm going to go get
water<00:03:34.830> and<00:03:35.250> then<00:03:35.790> do<00:03:36.390> this<00:03:38.750> then<00:03:39.750> I<00:03:39.780> can<00:03:40.170> start

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
water and then do this then I can start

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:52.260 
water and then do this then I can start
my<00:03:41.370> cool<00:03:41.700> staining<00:03:42.300> idea<00:03:42.890> you'll<00:03:43.890> see

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:52.270 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:54.330
