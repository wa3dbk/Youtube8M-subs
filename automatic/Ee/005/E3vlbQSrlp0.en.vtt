00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
center is actually an acrylic lens which

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.880 
center is actually an acrylic lens which
distributes<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.110> light<00:00:55.260> pretty<00:00:55.500> evenly

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
distributes the light pretty evenly

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.430 
distributes the light pretty evenly
throughout<00:00:56.219> the<00:00:56.309> fixture<00:00:56.879> what<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:58.260> nice

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
throughout the fixture what the nice

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.139 
throughout the fixture what the nice
thing<00:00:58.469> about<00:00:58.680> this<00:00:59.010> fixture<00:00:59.370> is<00:00:59.760> it<00:00:59.940> really

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
thing about this fixture is it really

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:01.760 
thing about this fixture is it really
kind<00:01:00.329> of<00:01:00.359> gives<00:01:00.539> you<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.750> skylight<00:01:01.379> effect

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
kind of gives you the skylight effect

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.319 
kind of gives you the skylight effect
when<00:01:02.010> you<00:01:02.100> put<00:01:02.309> it<00:01:02.399> into<00:01:02.579> a<00:01:02.730> recessed<00:01:03.210> ceiling

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
when you put it into a recessed ceiling

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.479 
when you put it into a recessed ceiling
so<00:01:04.170> it<00:01:04.260> almost<00:01:04.379> looks<00:01:04.710> like<00:01:04.769> it's<00:01:04.979> being<00:01:05.189> lit

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
so it almost looks like it's being lit

kind of give you guys an idea of what

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:14.520 
kind of give you guys an idea of what
what<00:02:05.549> it<00:02:05.670> looks<00:02:05.850> like<00:02:06.030> turned<00:02:06.329> down

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.220 

it's<00:02:15.530> kind<00:02:15.680> of<00:02:15.739> a<00:02:15.830> softer<00:02:16.340> light<00:02:17.019> this<00:02:18.019> one

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
it's kind of a softer light this one

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.170 
it's kind of a softer light this one
here<00:02:18.500> I<00:02:18.530> think<00:02:18.769> is<00:02:21.489> this<00:02:22.489> one<00:02:22.700> here<00:02:22.940> is<00:02:23.030> the

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
here I think is this one here is the

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:29.140 
here I think is this one here is the
4000<00:02:25.900> so<00:02:26.920> it's<00:02:27.920> the<00:02:28.160> middle<00:02:28.340> of<00:02:28.519> the<00:02:28.580> road<00:02:28.849> one

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
4000 so it's the middle of the road one

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.800 
4000 so it's the middle of the road one
it<00:02:30.140> is<00:02:30.349> dlc<00:02:30.709> rated<00:02:31.340> both<00:02:31.580> the<00:02:31.790> two<00:02:31.970> foot<00:02:32.269> or<00:02:32.569> two

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
it is dlc rated both the two foot or two

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.240 
it is dlc rated both the two foot or two
by<00:02:32.959> two<00:02:33.019> and<00:02:33.200> the<00:02:33.590> two<00:02:33.739> by<00:02:33.860> four<00:02:34.720> it<00:02:36.129> gives<00:02:37.129> a

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:37.250 
by two and the two by four it gives a

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:44.199 
by two and the two by four it gives a
nice<00:02:37.549> soft<00:02:38.000> light<00:02:38.599> also<00:02:41.769> there<00:02:42.769> is<00:02:42.799> a<00:02:43.099> zero<00:02:44.090> to

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:44.209 
nice soft light also there is a zero to

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.559 
nice soft light also there is a zero to
10<00:02:44.510> volt<00:02:44.840> dimming<00:02:45.290> to<00:02:46.069> this<00:02:46.250> fixture<00:02:46.640> so<00:02:47.420> the

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:47.569 
10 volt dimming to this fixture so the

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:49.690 
10 volt dimming to this fixture so the
bout<00:02:47.750> or<00:02:47.989> the<00:02:48.109> driver<00:02:48.650> that<00:02:48.769> it<00:02:49.010> has<00:02:49.160> now<00:02:49.430> will

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
bout or the driver that it has now will

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.280 
bout or the driver that it has now will
do<00:02:49.910> zero<00:02:50.180> to<00:02:50.209> ten<00:02:50.510> you<00:02:50.720> just<00:02:50.900> got<00:02:51.019> to<00:02:51.049> make<00:02:51.260> sure

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
do zero to ten you just got to make sure

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:57.039 
do zero to ten you just got to make sure
that<00:02:51.590> you<00:02:51.680> specify<00:02:52.180> the<00:02:53.379> correct<00:02:55.420> switch<00:02:56.420> for

00:02:57.039 --> 00:02:57.049 
that you specify the correct switch for

00:02:57.049 --> 00:02:59.710 
that you specify the correct switch for
that<00:02:57.290> and<00:02:57.890> you'll<00:02:58.010> find<00:02:58.250> those<00:02:58.459> is<00:02:58.730> 0<00:02:59.359> to<00:02:59.510> 10

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720 
that and you'll find those is 0 to 10

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:06.250 
that and you'll find those is 0 to 10
volt<00:03:00.140> dimming<00:03:01.420> and<00:03:02.440> it<00:03:03.440> does<00:03:03.970> have<00:03:04.970> a<00:03:05.260> 50,000

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
volt dimming and it does have a 50,000

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.599 
volt dimming and it does have a 50,000
hour<00:03:06.470> life<00:03:06.760> on<00:03:07.760> the<00:03:08.480> LEDs<00:03:08.930> and<00:03:09.230> will<00:03:09.920> last<00:03:10.129> well

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:10.609 
hour life on the LEDs and will last well

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:16.379 
hour life on the LEDs and will last well
over<00:03:10.640> 50<00:03:12.160> and<00:03:13.329> great<00:03:14.329> low<00:03:14.780> maintenance<00:03:15.370> costs

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:16.389 
over 50 and great low maintenance costs

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:20.650 
over 50 and great low maintenance costs
so<00:03:17.389> you<00:03:18.079> know<00:03:18.370> 39<00:03:19.370> wats<00:03:19.639> I'm<00:03:20.150> not<00:03:20.329> sure<00:03:20.480> if<00:03:20.569> I

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
so you know 39 wats I'm not sure if I

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:23.259 
so you know 39 wats I'm not sure if I
sent<00:03:20.870> this<00:03:20.959> before<00:03:21.380> but<00:03:21.560> 39<00:03:21.950> watts<00:03:22.190> is<00:03:22.370> 3900

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:23.269 
sent this before but 39 watts is 3900

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:27.300 
sent this before but 39 watts is 3900
lumens<00:03:23.660> that's<00:03:24.319> what<00:03:24.560> this<00:03:24.709> one<00:03:24.919> is<00:03:24.950> here<00:03:25.519> the

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
lumens that's what this one is here the

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:34.240 
lumens that's what this one is here the
the<00:03:28.310> two-by-four<00:03:29.299> is<00:03:30.370> 52<00:03:31.370> wats<00:03:32.269> and<00:03:32.630> it's<00:03:33.319> 5000

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:34.250 
the two-by-four is 52 wats and it's 5000

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:37.629 
the two-by-four is 52 wats and it's 5000
lemons<00:03:34.609> it<00:03:35.150> is<00:03:35.329> also<00:03:35.569> a<00:03:35.780> multi<00:03:36.440> volt<00:03:36.799> driver<00:03:37.220> so

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:37.639 
lemons it is also a multi volt driver so

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:40.890 
lemons it is also a multi volt driver so
it<00:03:37.730> will<00:03:37.819> hit<00:03:38.000> anything<00:03:38.329> from<00:03:38.660> 120<00:03:39.319> to<00:03:39.349> 277

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
it will hit anything from 120 to 277

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.720 
it will hit anything from 120 to 277
they're<00:03:41.900> really<00:03:42.169> competitively<00:03:43.069> priced<00:03:43.340> for

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:43.730 
they're really competitively priced for

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:46.539 
they're really competitively priced for
an<00:03:43.819> LED<00:03:44.239> fixture<00:03:44.859> especially<00:03:45.859> with<00:03:46.099> at<00:03:46.340> this

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:46.549 
an LED fixture especially with at this

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:49.120 
an LED fixture especially with at this
magnitude<00:03:47.230> like<00:03:48.230> I<00:03:48.349> said<00:03:48.410> it's<00:03:48.680> great<00:03:48.859> for

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.130 
magnitude like I said it's great for

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:53.050 
magnitude like I said it's great for
recessed<00:03:49.940> ceilings<00:03:51.400> try<00:03:52.400> them<00:03:52.519> out<00:03:52.609> you<00:03:53.000> know

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:53.060 
recessed ceilings try them out you know

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:54.879 
recessed ceilings try them out you know
they'll<00:03:53.389> look<00:03:53.510> great<00:03:53.690> in<00:03:53.930> your<00:03:53.989> next

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 
application and also you can't really

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:58.569 
application and also you can't really
beat<00:03:57.109> the<00:03:57.260> price<00:03:57.470> on<00:03:57.709> the<00:03:57.859> next<00:03:58.099> application

00:03:58.569 --> 00:03:58.579 
beat the price on the next application

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:02.080 
beat the price on the next application
