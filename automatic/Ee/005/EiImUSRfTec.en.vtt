Yasuo<00:00:20.720> and<00:00:20.960> Malphite<00:00:21.499> so<00:00:22.460> before<00:00:22.909> I<00:00:22.939> start<00:00:23.240> the

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:23.359 
Yasuo and Malphite so before I start the

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:26.079 
Yasuo and Malphite so before I start the
video<00:00:23.509> some<00:00:24.109> might<00:00:24.320> argue<00:00:24.529> that<00:00:24.820> Wukong<00:00:25.820> and

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:26.089 
video some might argue that Wukong and

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:29.159 
video some might argue that Wukong and
Yasuo<00:00:26.570> is<00:00:26.839> a<00:00:26.869> better<00:00:27.140> combo<00:00:27.679> however<00:00:28.669> I<00:00:28.820> think

00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:29.169 
Yasuo is a better combo however I think

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:31.929 
Yasuo is a better combo however I think
the<00:00:30.169> Malphite<00:00:30.589> and<00:00:30.739> Yahshua<00:00:31.039> combo<00:00:31.460> is<00:00:31.640> a<00:00:31.669> lot

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:31.939 
the Malphite and Yahshua combo is a lot

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:34.690 
the Malphite and Yahshua combo is a lot
easier<00:00:32.329> to<00:00:32.509> pull<00:00:32.750> off<00:00:32.930> and<00:00:33.260> it<00:00:33.710> just<00:00:33.950> has<00:00:34.160> a<00:00:34.460> lot

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:34.700 
easier to pull off and it just has a lot

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.240 
easier to pull off and it just has a lot
more<00:00:34.880> options<00:00:35.149> because<00:00:35.720> with<00:00:36.590> the<00:00:36.770> range<00:00:37.010> on

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:37.250 
more options because with the range on

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.460 
more options because with the range on
malphite's<00:00:37.760> ultimate<00:00:38.300> it<00:00:38.570> makes<00:00:38.900> it<00:00:39.080> easier

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:39.470 
malphite's ultimate it makes it easier

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:42.370 
malphite's ultimate it makes it easier
to<00:00:39.680> find<00:00:39.920> picks<00:00:40.310> and<00:00:40.670> it<00:00:41.450> makes<00:00:41.750> it<00:00:41.870> easier<00:00:42.200> to

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:42.380 
to find picks and it makes it easier to

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.560 
to find picks and it makes it easier to
initiate<00:00:42.620> into<00:00:43.520> teamfights<00:00:44.000> rather<00:00:44.330> than

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:44.570 
initiate into teamfights rather than

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.590 
initiate into teamfights rather than
Luke<00:00:44.870> on<00:00:45.080> where<00:00:45.610> the<00:00:46.610> enemy's<00:00:46.970> kind<00:00:47.180> of<00:00:47.300> see<00:00:47.480> it

Luke on where the enemy's kind of see it

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.660

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:05.600 
counters to the combo so there's not a

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.980

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
combo because their Ultimates are so

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.539 
combo because their Ultimates are so
strong<00:01:41.740> they<00:01:42.740> got<00:01:42.920> really<00:01:43.100> good<00:01:43.190> pick

strong they got really good pick

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:45.940 
strong they got really good pick
potential<00:01:44.120> like<00:01:44.420> I<00:01:44.540> said<00:01:44.780> with<00:01:45.049> the<00:01:45.290> long

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950 
potential like I said with the long

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.420 
potential like I said with the long
range<00:01:46.220> on<00:01:46.520> malphite's<00:01:47.210> ultimate<00:01:47.659> and<00:01:48.430> Yasuo

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
range on malphite's ultimate and Yasuo

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.460 
range on malphite's ultimate and Yasuo
does<00:01:49.700> not<00:01:50.060> have<00:01:50.270> to<00:01:50.420> rely<00:01:50.570> on<00:01:50.750> his<00:01:51.020> knock<00:01:51.260> up

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
does not have to rely on his knock up

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.640 
does not have to rely on his knock up
which<00:01:51.710> i<00:01:51.860> think<00:01:51.920> is<00:01:52.190> really<00:01:52.520> key<00:01:52.790> because<00:01:53.690> when

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:54.650 
which i think is really key because when

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:56.080 
which i think is really key because when
you're<00:01:54.770> playing<00:01:54.979> yeah<00:01:55.159> so<00:01:55.369> it's<00:01:55.520> kind<00:01:55.790> of<00:01:55.880> hard

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
you're playing yeah so it's kind of hard

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:58.960 
you're playing yeah so it's kind of hard
to<00:01:56.210> always<00:01:56.630> have<00:01:56.840> your<00:01:57.340> tornado<00:01:58.340> ready<00:01:58.729> for

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
to always have your tornado ready for

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.630 
to always have your tornado ready for
the<00:01:59.030> fight<00:01:59.270> so<00:01:59.689> having<00:02:00.409> a<00:02:00.799> knock<00:02:01.040> up<00:02:01.250> like

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640 
the fight so having a knock up like

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.280 
the fight so having a knock up like
Malphite<00:02:02.119> on<00:02:02.240> your<00:02:02.390> team<00:02:02.570> makes<00:02:02.780> out<00:02:02.960> a<00:02:02.990> lot

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.290 
Malphite on your team makes out a lot

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.679 
Malphite on your team makes out a lot
easier<00:02:03.680> on<00:02:03.740> Yasuo<00:02:04.250> and<00:02:04.549> it's<00:02:05.180> basically<00:02:05.570> a

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:05.689 
easier on Yasuo and it's basically a

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:08.350 
easier on Yasuo and it's basically a
press<00:02:06.020> art<00:02:06.229> to<00:02:06.380> win<00:02:06.560> combo<00:02:07.010> if<00:02:07.220> Malphite<00:02:08.000> finds

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
press art to win combo if Malphite finds

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.080 
press art to win combo if Malphite finds
a<00:02:08.450> pick<00:02:08.689> on<00:02:08.899> a<00:02:08.959> few<00:02:09.259> of<00:02:09.379> the<00:02:09.500> enemy<00:02:09.860> or<00:02:10.099> on<00:02:10.789> a<00:02:10.819> few

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
a pick on a few of the enemy or on a few

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.730 
a pick on a few of the enemy or on a few
of<00:02:11.150> the<00:02:11.239> enemies<00:02:11.630> then<00:02:11.870> you're<00:02:12.349> pretty<00:02:12.590> much

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
of the enemies then you're pretty much

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:17.520 
of the enemies then you're pretty much
gonna<00:02:12.980> win<00:02:13.190> that<00:02:13.220> teamfight<00:02:13.849> if<00:02:14.120> you're<00:02:14.750> fed

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:20.710 

comes<00:02:18.530> to<00:02:18.680> the<00:02:18.800> combo<00:02:19.160> guys<00:02:19.430> I<00:02:19.730> can't<00:02:20.390> really

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
comes to the combo guys I can't really

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.380 
comes to the combo guys I can't really
think<00:02:20.930> of<00:02:21.110> too<00:02:21.320> many<00:02:21.590> but<00:02:21.950> it<00:02:22.550> kind<00:02:22.910> of<00:02:23.030> only

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:23.390 
think of too many but it kind of only

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:25.570 
think of too many but it kind of only
works<00:02:23.660> if<00:02:23.900> your<00:02:24.050> team<00:02:24.260> is<00:02:24.290> ahead<00:02:24.710> because<00:02:25.010> if

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
works if your team is ahead because if

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.940 
works if your team is ahead because if
your<00:02:26.150> team<00:02:26.450> is<00:02:26.630> behind<00:02:26.810> then<00:02:27.500> you're<00:02:27.740> probably

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
your team is behind then you're probably

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.650 
your team is behind then you're probably
not<00:02:28.220> going<00:02:28.370> to<00:02:28.430> be<00:02:28.580> looking<00:02:28.940> to<00:02:28.970> initiate

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
not going to be looking to initiate

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.130 
not going to be looking to initiate
fights<00:02:30.170> and<00:02:30.500> you<00:02:31.280> kind<00:02:31.580> of<00:02:31.790> have<00:02:32.150> to<00:02:32.180> be<00:02:33.050> ahead

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
fights and you kind of have to be ahead

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.960 
fights and you kind of have to be ahead
of<00:02:33.350> your<00:02:33.560> team<00:02:33.800> because<00:02:34.160> you<00:02:34.310> always<00:02:34.520> want<00:02:34.880> to

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
of your team because you always want to

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.970 
of your team because you always want to
be<00:02:35.150> the<00:02:35.300> ones<00:02:35.510> initiating<00:02:36.350> you<00:02:36.500> don't<00:02:36.740> want

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
be the ones initiating you don't want

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.450 
be the ones initiating you don't want
the<00:02:37.430> enemy<00:02:37.790> team<00:02:38.030> to<00:02:38.060> initiate<00:02:38.780> on<00:02:38.990> you<00:02:39.290> so<00:02:40.100> I

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:40.460 
the enemy team to initiate on you so I

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.340 
the enemy team to initiate on you so I
can't<00:02:40.640> really<00:02:40.790> think<00:02:40.880> of<00:02:41.120> many<00:02:41.330> other<00:02:41.630> cons<00:02:41.990> if

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:42.350 
can't really think of many other cons if

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.040 
can't really think of many other cons if
you<00:02:42.830> guys<00:02:42.980> know<00:02:43.850> of<00:02:43.880> any<00:02:44.120> then<00:02:44.450> leave<00:02:44.750> them<00:02:44.930> in

this kha'zix and that ultimately won us

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.949 
this kha'zix and that ultimately won us
the<00:03:44.810> game<00:03:45.110> because<00:03:45.650> it's<00:03:46.340> such<00:03:46.660> it<00:03:47.660> was<00:03:47.780> so
