 some good players certainly but no major elements pointed out and 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:26.320
 However 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.320
 we struggled 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.300
 we have to wait until March for the video games planet to recover 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.460

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.300
 always 3 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.990
 the cane festival of the video game 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.170
 in Los Angeles 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.150
 all the bigger is coming on consoles and pc they are presented but 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.729
 amidst this flood of staggering announcements like the arrival of a michael game 

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:26.840
 jackson this edition and score by the ceo of nyt do not we 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.840

 prestigious troupe of the circus of the sun raising the veil on course physio 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:07.180

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.349
 gilding the pill the release of the new xbox 360 this is nevertheless the event 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:16.969
 lighter but also more reliable this slim model also has more 

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:18.599
 of options like the built-in wifi 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:21.199
 and the emergence of a crisis that is no longer realistic 

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:24.199
 no revolution but a welcome weight loss 

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:29.609
 as a reminder almost 45 million euros 

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:32.480
 x-box 360 have found takers in the world so far 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.259

 Galicia as the biggest european and Ottoman fair in Cologne 

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:55.570
 here no big announcement a slew of 8 and then 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:59.020
 the trend is rather ugly a controller I resume movement 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.830

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.780

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.780
 years 

00:03:14.619 --> 00:03:18.639

 in this huge salons mainly for the Asian market 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:25.879
 we were able to discover 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:28.879
 some pearls like the real or the movie series and traille 

00:03:30.399 --> 00:03:32.929
 or again in a turn a lot here develop 

00:03:32.929 --> 00:03:35.929
 in collaboration with the studio 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:43.129
 disappointment on the other hand with the relative discretion 2 and the guardia even the 

00:03:43.129 --> 00:03:45.999

00:03:49.059 --> 00:03:52.609
 remains a good vintage 2010 for this tokyo game show that the game 

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:55.609
 Japanese video but clearly not dead 

00:03:59.949 --> 00:04:03.249
 but the month of September is also the arrival of playstation move on ps3 

00:04:05.369 --> 00:04:10.399
 combining two props and the ps3 camera the movement and a great 

00:04:10.399 --> 00:04:11.099
 precision

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:15.359
 world 

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:18.359

00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:29.689

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.330
