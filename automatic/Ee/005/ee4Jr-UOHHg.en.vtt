at driver-side comm I'm here today with
the<00:00:13.330> BMW<00:00:13.869> x5m

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:14.770 
the BMW x5m

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:16.859 
the BMW x5m
now<00:00:15.730> this<00:00:15.910> is<00:00:16.029> the<00:00:16.119> M<00:00:16.270> car<00:00:16.480> that<00:00:16.630> was<00:00:16.720> never

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:16.869 
now this is the M car that was never

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:18.540 
now this is the M car that was never
supposed<00:00:17.109> to<00:00:17.289> be<00:00:17.380> and<00:00:17.710> I<00:00:17.770> say<00:00:17.949> that<00:00:18.100> because<00:00:18.220> M

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:18.550 
supposed to be and I say that because M

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:19.769 
supposed to be and I say that because M
division<00:00:19.029> said<00:00:19.210> they'd<00:00:19.359> never<00:00:19.390> do<00:00:19.750> a

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:19.779 
division said they'd never do a

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:22.109 
division said they'd never do a
turbocharged<00:00:20.350> car<00:00:20.619> nor<00:00:21.279> would<00:00:21.460> they<00:00:21.550> build<00:00:21.820> an

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:22.119 
turbocharged car nor would they build an

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:24.480 
turbocharged car nor would they build an
SUV<00:00:22.570> well<00:00:23.560> it<00:00:23.619> turns<00:00:23.800> out<00:00:23.890> they've<00:00:24.070> done<00:00:24.249> both

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:24.490 
SUV well it turns out they've done both

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:25.919 
SUV well it turns out they've done both
at<00:00:24.669> the<00:00:24.789> same<00:00:24.970> time<00:00:25.210> and<00:00:25.509> when<00:00:25.659> you're<00:00:25.839> an

at the same time and when you're an

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:28.230 
at the same time and when you're an
iconic<00:00:26.380> brand<00:00:26.589> like<00:00:27.159> M<00:00:27.369> division<00:00:27.820> it's

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:28.240 
iconic brand like M division it's

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.079 
iconic brand like M division it's
founded<00:00:28.570> on<00:00:28.839> the<00:00:29.679> cores<00:00:29.919> of<00:00:30.039> the<00:00:30.099> e30<00:00:30.519> m3<00:00:30.609> which

biggest question today is it an M car is

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:45.420 
biggest question today is it an M car is
it<00:00:40.150> any<00:00:40.270> good<00:00:40.360> let's<00:00:41.020> go<00:00:41.110> find<00:00:41.320> out<00:00:44.430> now

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:45.430 
it any good let's go find out now

it any good let's go find out now
inevitably<00:00:46.090> you've<00:00:46.420> got<00:00:46.600> to<00:00:46.690> ask<00:00:46.780> yourself<00:00:46.900> is

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:47.710 
inevitably you've got to ask yourself is

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.160 
inevitably you've got to ask yourself is
it<00:00:48.550> necessary<00:00:49.030> to<00:00:49.150> have<00:00:49.240> an<00:00:49.390> SUV<00:00:49.630> that's<00:00:49.960> this

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
it necessary to have an SUV that's this

it necessary to have an SUV that's this
fast<00:00:50.470> of<00:00:51.040> course<00:00:51.400> not<00:00:51.580> but<00:00:51.790> necessity<00:00:52.210> was

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:52.570 
fast of course not but necessity was

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.330 
fast of course not but necessity was
never<00:00:53.080> part<00:00:53.410> of<00:00:53.500> this<00:00:53.590> cars<00:00:53.890> mission

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:54.340

all-out engineering can we engineer

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:00.300 
all-out engineering can we engineer
something<00:00:58.240> this<00:00:58.420> big<00:00:58.690> that's<00:00:59.020> this<00:00:59.260> fast<00:00:59.620> that

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:00.310 
something this big that's this fast that

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:02.340 
something this big that's this fast that
has<00:01:00.670> this<00:01:01.270> kind<00:01:01.480> of<00:01:01.510> performance<00:01:01.990> potential

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
has this kind of performance potential

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.249 
has this kind of performance potential
out<00:01:02.680> of<00:01:02.740> a<00:01:03.280> package<00:01:03.640> that<00:01:03.670> innately<00:01:04.239> does<00:01:05.079> not

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.490 
have on-road performance potential now
that<00:01:08.020> put<00:01:08.259> is<00:01:08.350> 555<00:01:09.310> horsepower<00:01:10.140> 500<00:01:11.140> pounds<00:01:11.440> of

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
that put is 555 horsepower 500 pounds of

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:13.770 
that put is 555 horsepower 500 pounds of
torque<00:01:11.740> which<00:01:12.310> is<00:01:12.490> just<00:01:12.760> staggering<00:01:13.360> because

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
torque which is just staggering because

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.240 
torque which is just staggering because
you've<00:01:14.050> got<00:01:14.200> the<00:01:14.320> turrets<00:01:14.710> turbocharged

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
you've got the turrets turbocharged

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.580 
you've got the turrets turbocharged
torque<00:01:15.520> so<00:01:15.640> you've<00:01:15.760> got<00:01:15.940> it<00:01:15.970> from<00:01:16.300> 1500<00:01:17.200> rpm

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
torque so you've got it from 1500 rpm

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.780 
torque so you've got it from 1500 rpm
and<00:01:18.520> you<00:01:18.640> can<00:01:18.760> do<00:01:18.880> things<00:01:19.060> like<00:01:19.180> this

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:21.790 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.210 

in<00:01:22.240> a<00:01:22.450> car<00:01:22.660> that<00:01:22.690> weighs<00:01:22.930> well<00:01:23.410> over<00:01:23.470> 5,000

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:24.220 
in a car that weighs well over 5,000

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.720 
in a car that weighs well over 5,000
pounds<00:01:24.690> and<00:01:25.690> it<00:01:25.780> just<00:01:25.960> turns<00:01:26.170> in<00:01:26.380> crisp<00:01:26.770> it's

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:27.730 
pounds and it just turns in crisp it's

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:30.060 
pounds and it just turns in crisp it's
great<00:01:28.060> if<00:01:28.570> you<00:01:29.200> want<00:01:29.410> a<00:01:29.440> big<00:01:29.590> car<00:01:29.800> that's<00:01:30.010> fast

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:30.070 
great if you want a big car that's fast

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.080 
great if you want a big car that's fast
now<00:01:31.080> at<00:01:32.080> the<00:01:32.230> same<00:01:32.440> time<00:01:32.940> what<00:01:33.940> they've
