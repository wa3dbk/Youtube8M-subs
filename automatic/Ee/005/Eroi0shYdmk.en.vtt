00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:08.790
 hello dear cities now 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:11.969
 us it's time to harvest the onions I want 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:15.900
 talk a little bit again 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:20.300
 how to remove it correctly so that it 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:25.109
 well then subsequently stored 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:29.910
 Let's start with the fact that the bow should be removed 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:32.640
 then when he mostly his feathers 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:35.760
 laid down here you will see a bed that is already on it 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.980
 Perry almost everybody went to bed 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.940
 neck 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:46.739
 she bent over and as if perry already lie 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:49.649
 and starts to dry if you understand what 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:52.110
 you have such that Perry is still green 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.070
 the bow melts but time is already appropriate 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:55.590
 may begin 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.789
 rainy weather the bow itself well you 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:02.969
 sometimes perry grew up even bending down to 

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:03.960
 the earth themselves to make it just bend 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.330
 this 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:12.750
 place and so perry began to dry and 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:15.030
 what we naturally do next is 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:19.259
 now it is already necessary 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:23.549
 clean up since it can start raining 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:25.860
 he can start already after laying down 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.409
 he can already start already again 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.990
 grow new roots and what's called 

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.000
 Once Tymochka That is, he can repeatedly 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.360
 start growing it is natural to allow 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.150
 it is impossible and it is not evidence at this time 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:42.390
 already remove what we are now and will do 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:48.320
 we remove of course we get very 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:51.210
 be careful here its whole 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:55.070
 can be hands if he is not deep like a 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:58.700
 I am sitting a bunch 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:00.890
 and so on the garden you can 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.990
 fold eat from sunny weather 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:06.650
 preferably and clean course in the sun 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:09.440
 the weather so that he still dried up a little 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:14.810
 so here in the sun here we are and so 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:17.270
 here we will put so I gathered onions 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.310
 laid it out on a preliminary 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:25.910
 a little dry since outside 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:28.220
 now the sun is still a plus for the sun 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:31.670
 good breeze it now also 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:34.790
 air out here after that 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:37.390
 what to do it of course you can 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:41.030
 bust did something that is 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:43.760
 bulbs but where else has survived 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:46.670
 not bad there is a green feather on 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:50.209
 first time to get a good green 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.370
 pen but such a bow is a must in 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:54.440
 the first place 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.989
 if we cut now like this 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.330
 we will use a feather then such a bow and 

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:02.299
 also need to use the first place 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:06.320
 have it somewhere near nowhere 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:10.160
 clean up and used once in food here 

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:13.070
 the main onion is the whole crop is necessary 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:15.620
 Naturally with feathers 

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:17.660
 with roots now nothing with him 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:21.950
 do nothing trim in no way 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:26.510
 case not nuts either pen because 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:30.290
 through these places we just right 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:33.980
 there will be bacteria he come soon 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:37.370
 may then rot away so we dry everything 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:40.760
 together with the pen to dry better in attics 

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:43.340
 in the attics of a bath house any 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:46.700
 sheds of any premises are the best 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:50.450
 drying places it in the attic dries sleep where 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:52.970
 then two three weeks and should dry out what 

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:55.640
 the pen should literally crunch ie 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:58.820
 she crumble in hand should be here 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:01.400
 this place will turn into a general must 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:04.860
 thin in a thin ponytail we have it later 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:11.120
 of course also show 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:14.330
 and already after that we cut already 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:17.489
 this tail leaving here is so long and 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:20.940
 small and pruned slightly roots 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:24.260
 and then he is quite normal with us 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:27.630
 stored at home simple home 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:29.730
 conditions in the apartment house that is when 

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.440
 normal room temperature he 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:33.630
 may already stored is stored very 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.260
 pretty long can be stored and up 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:37.860
 of spring 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:41.880
 if everything is well dried of course after 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:44.430
 how it dried up and at the moment that's when 

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.860
 we collect it more carefully of course 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:51.300
 we look if we see signs somewhere 

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:53.610
 that it is already damaged for example onion 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.620
 a fly then of course such a bow is also necessary 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.250
 sort out 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.710
 use it first 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:03.120
 because how would you not dried it 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:08.000
 it will still rot in you exactly 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:08.000
 in the same way we will clean now 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:15.380
 the onions that we grew in sevok that is 

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:18.479
 we sowed the seeds have grown 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:21.210
 this chick which we will plant 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:23.870
 next year everything is exactly the same 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:27.930
 technology therefore i will not repeat 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:30.270
 simply it will remove and clean to dry and 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:33.600
 then remove for storage 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:36.979
 home here on this until all goodbye 

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:36.979
 see you soon
