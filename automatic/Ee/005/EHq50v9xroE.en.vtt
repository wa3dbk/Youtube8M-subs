00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 so i show the field we milk 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.620
 frothing an espresso machine 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:10.260
 you can lose yourself even higher 

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:13.049
 where the problem that me while hot 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:19.020
 but was not set up correctly 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:20.939
 was so first time you say that 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.850
 it's not that easy after all 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:27.539
 picking up the ground what I once did 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.019
 because that's just the system as 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.060
 whole 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.960
 written down here so that you 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:36.860
 came out differently afterwards 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:39.379
 furthermore you have two screws left 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.760
 which measurements are special 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:46.649
 screwdriver with three sides 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:49.289
 opening up is the whole thing 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:52.280
 and milled down here 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:56.809
 then comes the inner 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:01:00.899
 she now tells the board here 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:03.180
 the motor and inside is then the 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:11.159
 heating coil and here is the white of 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:16.580
 a switch as if now does the 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:18.509
 take off board volt and more 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.130
 wanted to investigate in it 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.189
 or want to see what is broken 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:26.549
 maybe you have to measure by 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:31.100
 First we removed two screws 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:31.100
 out there in time for that 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:40.310
 the ntc is the temperature of one 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:42.689
 platinum or spirals escape and 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:46.920
 would have the whole age for the Radstadt 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:49.950
 the good the plug would have to remove and 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:55.020
 here's the plug for the engine 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:56.640
 then they would have to be removed later and 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.100
 if the whole thing has staked you have to 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.700
 three solder joints of the pins we 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.250
 remove 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.350
 this would have been here off here 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.770
 one more and here is the third 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.450
 solder joint venice 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.060
 you have solved the board 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.800
 Unfortunately, I do not lose weight 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:16.500
 possible because it just soldered again 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:18.519
 there you see here again the 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:22.629
 power button on the board with 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:26.170
 Exceptions the luminous ring and yes with the 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:31.209
 relay which switches the heating coil 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:33.760
 or just switch off if he has everything 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:36.970
 I finished and found a mistake 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.349
 or not just again 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.420
 install and what maybe still too 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:43.500
 say is when the removal is very important 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.269
 here are the two brackets after 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.739
 over here above 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:53.739
 and that would have to raise a bit with it 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:59.110
 ever get out of here 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:03:00.430
 could later during installation then would have 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.900
 would take care that you are the whole 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.900
 correct for a seat 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:10.200
 and then there is the problem that the 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:11.549
 switch inside life way and 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.930
 is pressed 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:16.150
 and if the whole pushes in again 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:23.620
 he will be under the actual switch 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:27.000
 pressed on the board and I have 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.000
 nothing helped with a paper clip 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:35.730
 he just drives underneath and will 

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:40.660
 whole and then sees it when installing 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:43.989
 so that the light up to Munich 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:47.099
 not possible with one hand but me 

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:47.099
 think that this works
