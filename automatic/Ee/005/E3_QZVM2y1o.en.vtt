your favorite part of it well I think
it's<00:04:08.290> a<00:04:08.410> very<00:04:08.620> gradual<00:04:09.750> cut<00:04:10.750> out<00:04:10.870> one

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:11.080 
it's a very gradual cut out one

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.800 
it's a very gradual cut out one
kilometer<00:04:11.590> run<00:04:12.220> up<00:04:12.700> to<00:04:12.849> face<00:04:13.030> a<00:04:13.060> mountain<00:04:13.569> and

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
kilometer run up to face a mountain and

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:16.020 
kilometer run up to face a mountain and
write<00:04:14.290> immediately<00:04:14.530> it<00:04:15.010> goes<00:04:15.220> very<00:04:15.430> steep<00:04:15.790> and

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
write immediately it goes very steep and

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:19.770 
write immediately it goes very steep and
it's<00:04:16.570> steep<00:04:17.440> for<00:04:17.739> about<00:04:17.859> you<00:04:18.280> know<00:04:18.540> one<00:04:19.540> mile

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
it's steep for about you know one mile

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.430 
it's steep for about you know one mile
in<00:04:20.109> to<00:04:20.500> gain<00:04:20.680> about<00:04:21.480> 2,800<00:04:22.480> feet<00:04:22.510> in<00:04:22.930> that<00:04:23.260> one

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:23.440 
in to gain about 2,800 feet in that one

00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:25.620 
in to gain about 2,800 feet in that one
mile<00:04:23.680> you<00:04:24.400> turn<00:04:24.610> right<00:04:24.850> around<00:04:24.970> and<00:04:25.330> it<00:04:25.479> comes

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
mile you turn right around and it comes

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:28.860 
mile you turn right around and it comes
straight<00:04:25.900> down<00:04:25.960> another<00:04:27.060> about<00:04:28.060> exactly<00:04:28.630> one

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
straight down another about exactly one

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.350 
straight down another about exactly one
mile<00:04:29.110> and<00:04:29.470> you<00:04:29.650> lose<00:04:29.800> about<00:04:30.100> 2,800<00:04:30.700> feet<00:04:30.760> and

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
mile and you lose about 2,800 feet and

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.230 
mile and you lose about 2,800 feet and
then<00:04:31.720> when<00:04:31.930> you<00:04:31.990> get<00:04:32.080> to<00:04:32.139> the<00:04:32.290> base<00:04:32.440> there<00:04:33.240> you

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
then when you get to the base there you

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:36.120 
then when you get to the base there you
got<00:04:34.389> another<00:04:34.630> just<00:04:35.020> over<00:04:35.260> a<00:04:35.290> 1<00:04:35.530> kilometer<00:04:35.979> run

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 
got another just over a 1 kilometer run

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:40.460 
got another just over a 1 kilometer run
to<00:04:36.310> the<00:04:36.400> finish<00:04:36.550> and<00:04:38.010> so<00:04:39.010> it's<00:04:39.190> a<00:04:39.250> bit<00:04:39.400> abrupt

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:40.470 
to the finish and so it's a bit abrupt

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:43.800 
to the finish and so it's a bit abrupt
changing<00:04:41.470> you<00:04:41.950> know<00:04:41.979> from<00:04:42.310> the<00:04:42.639> gradual<00:04:43.570> run

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
changing you know from the gradual run

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:46.620 
changing you know from the gradual run
to<00:04:44.200> the<00:04:44.320> steep<00:04:44.590> hike<00:04:44.800> the<00:04:45.310> steep<00:04:45.580> down<00:04:45.880> to<00:04:46.510> the

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:46.630 
to the steep hike the steep down to the

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:49.320 
to the steep hike the steep down to the
ground<00:04:46.840> will<00:04:46.990> run<00:04:47.260> again<00:04:48.090> changing<00:04:49.090> gears

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:49.330 
ground will run again changing gears

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:51.680 
ground will run again changing gears
it's<00:04:49.600> really<00:04:50.290> really<00:04:50.500> tricky<00:04:50.710> and<00:04:50.950> difficult

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:51.690 
it's really really tricky and difficult

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:54.330 
it's really really tricky and difficult
having<00:04:52.690> to<00:04:52.870> adjust<00:04:52.960> if<00:04:53.410> my<00:04:53.500> least<00:04:53.740> favorite

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.659 
having to adjust if my least favorite
part<00:04:54.490> it's<00:04:55.060> so<00:04:55.630> so<00:04:55.930> painful<00:04:56.140> just<00:04:56.560> of<00:04:57.460> course

00:04:57.659 --> 00:04:57.669 
part it's so so painful just of course

00:04:57.669 --> 00:04:59.670 
part it's so so painful just of course
repeat<00:04:58.000> we're<00:04:58.630> very<00:04:58.810> very<00:04:58.870> tired<00:04:59.320> but<00:04:59.440> I<00:04:59.530> feel

00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 
repeat we're very very tired but I feel

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:01.100 
repeat we're very very tired but I feel
like<00:04:59.770> you<00:04:59.890> just<00:04:59.919> get<00:05:00.130> kicked<00:05:00.460> in<00:05:00.550> the<00:05:00.610> guts

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
like you just get kicked in the guts

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.210 
like you just get kicked in the guts
every<00:05:02.110> time<00:05:02.320> it<00:05:02.650> was<00:05:02.830> something<00:05:03.070> like<00:05:03.100> that

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:03.220 
every time it was something like that

every time it was something like that
happens<00:05:03.880> and<00:05:04.890> but<00:05:05.890> I<00:05:05.950> guess<00:05:06.070> my<00:05:06.160> favorite<00:05:06.430> part

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:06.640

guy<00:06:01.770> ran<00:06:02.010> this<00:06:02.130> course<00:06:02.400> in<00:06:02.580> 43<00:06:03.210> 23<00:06:03.870> and<00:06:05.300> it<00:06:06.300> just

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:06.510 
guy ran this course in 43 23 and it just

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:08.510 
guy ran this course in 43 23 and it just
so<00:06:06.750> mind-blowing<00:06:07.410> that<00:06:07.590> that<00:06:07.860> record<00:06:08.250> you

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:08.520 
so mind-blowing that that record you

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:12.140 
so mind-blowing that that record you
know<00:06:08.550> was<00:06:09.240> possible<00:06:09.920> and<00:06:10.920> every<00:06:11.820> year<00:06:12.030> you

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:12.150 
know was possible and every year you

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:14.180 
know was possible and every year you
know<00:06:12.180> no<00:06:12.390> one<00:06:12.510> really<00:06:12.540> came<00:06:13.020> close<00:06:13.290> to<00:06:13.500> it<00:06:13.620> and

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:14.190 
know no one really came close to it and

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:16.850 
know no one really came close to it and
so<00:06:14.610> it's<00:06:14.760> just<00:06:14.910> such<00:06:15.000> a<00:06:15.030> dream<00:06:15.420> that<00:06:15.860> someone

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:16.860 
so it's just such a dream that someone

00:06:16.860 --> 00:06:18.830 
so it's just such a dream that someone
could<00:06:17.340> get<00:06:17.580> it<00:06:17.790> and<00:06:18.000> in<00:06:18.270> the<00:06:18.360> last<00:06:18.540> few<00:06:18.780> years

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:18.840 
could get it and in the last few years

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:22.400 
could get it and in the last few years
it<00:06:19.830> became<00:06:20.220> a<00:06:20.280> reality<00:06:20.640> that<00:06:21.510> the<00:06:21.750> Aspen<00:06:22.230> could

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:22.410 
it became a reality that the Aspen could

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:24.500 
it became a reality that the Aspen could
actually<00:06:22.740> do<00:06:23.070> it<00:06:23.220> and<00:06:23.580> then<00:06:24.090> months<00:06:24.330> leading

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:24.510 
actually do it and then months leading

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:27.860 
actually do it and then months leading
up<00:06:24.720> to<00:06:24.870> that<00:06:24.900> readers<00:06:25.380> race<00:06:26.240> myself<00:06:27.240> and<00:06:27.480> why

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:27.870 
up to that readers race myself and why

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:29.450 
up to that readers race myself and why
the<00:06:27.930> runner<00:06:28.140> like<00:06:28.350> my<00:06:28.500> Nabokov<00:06:28.980> its<00:06:29.100> words

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:29.460 
the runner like my Nabokov its words

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:31.280 
the runner like my Nabokov its words
we're<00:06:29.640> training<00:06:29.940> we<00:06:30.810> think<00:06:31.020> we<00:06:31.110> had<00:06:31.260> that

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:31.290
