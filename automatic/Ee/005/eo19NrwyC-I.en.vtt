00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:06.630 
means I gotta go to look it up in a
cookbook<00:01:04.690> and<00:01:05.199> that<00:01:05.560> just<00:01:05.800> takes<00:01:05.980> time<00:01:06.250> so<00:01:06.610> I

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:06.640 
cookbook and that just takes time so I

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.610 
cookbook and that just takes time so I

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:29.269 
because now we're going to fill that up

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:33.460 
because now we're going to fill that up
with<00:03:29.690> the<00:03:30.590> milk<00:03:31.300> for<00:03:32.300> this<00:03:32.420> recipe<00:03:32.660> so<00:03:33.260> that's

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:33.470 
with the milk for this recipe so that's

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:36.240 
with the milk for this recipe so that's
step<00:03:33.830> two<00:03:34.220> and<00:03:34.519> we'll<00:03:35.150> add<00:03:35.269> that<00:03:35.300> to<00:03:35.810> our<00:03:35.840> Bowl

step two and we'll add that to our Bowl

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:41.560 
step two and we'll add that to our Bowl
now<00:03:37.250> since<00:03:37.670> I'm<00:03:37.940> not<00:03:38.239> using<00:03:40.570> self-rising

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:41.570 
now since I'm not using self-rising

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:45.009 
now since I'm not using self-rising
flour<00:03:42.880> Jamie<00:03:43.880> Oliver<00:03:44.030> did<00:03:44.450> so<00:03:44.690> we<00:03:44.780> didn't<00:03:44.959> have

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:45.019 
flour Jamie Oliver did so we didn't have

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:46.509 
flour Jamie Oliver did so we didn't have
to<00:03:45.140> go<00:03:45.320> this<00:03:45.500> step<00:03:45.769> but<00:03:45.950> since<00:03:46.250> I'm<00:03:46.340> not<00:03:46.370> using

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:46.519 
to go this step but since I'm not using

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:49.750 
to go this step but since I'm not using
it<00:03:47.090> I'm<00:03:47.300> not<00:03:47.420> add<00:03:47.660> a<00:03:47.720> couple<00:03:48.760> regular

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
it I'm not add a couple regular

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.670 
it I'm not add a couple regular
spoonfuls<00:03:50.480> of

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
spoonfuls of

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.140 
spoonfuls of
powder<00:03:52.129> so<00:03:52.609> the<00:03:52.790> one<00:03:53.090> and<00:03:53.950> two<00:03:54.950> it<00:03:55.819> will<00:03:56.030> also

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
powder so the one and two it will also

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:03.550 
powder so the one and two it will also
add<00:03:56.599> a<00:03:56.930> pinch<00:03:57.230> of<00:03:57.909> salt<00:03:59.349> that<00:04:00.349> in<00:04:00.620> and<00:04:02.469> going<00:04:03.469> to

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
add a pinch of salt that in and going to

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.920 
add a pinch of salt that in and going to
need<00:04:03.680> that<00:04:03.829> egg<00:04:04.099> so<00:04:04.340> let's<00:04:04.519> crack<00:04:04.819> that<00:04:05.090> and

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
need that egg so let's crack that and

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.839 
need that egg so let's crack that and
cut<00:04:06.859> it<00:04:07.040> in<00:04:07.219> to<00:04:07.700> our<00:04:07.849> bowl<00:04:08.200> and<00:04:09.459> so<00:04:10.459> they<00:04:10.670> needed

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:10.849 
cut it in to our bowl and so they needed

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:12.869 
cut it in to our bowl and so they needed
at<00:04:11.030> this<00:04:11.150> point<00:04:11.420> you<00:04:11.480> just<00:04:11.540> take<00:04:11.930> a<00:04:11.959> whisk<00:04:12.409> and

00:04:12.869 --> 00:04:12.879 
at this point you just take a whisk and

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:15.759 
at this point you just take a whisk and
start<00:04:13.879> whisking<00:04:14.209> it<00:04:14.569> up<00:04:14.780> and<00:04:15.019> really<00:04:15.650> the
