Anish<00:00:02.610> did<00:00:02.820> anything<00:00:03.090> happen<00:00:03.360> in<00:00:03.570> the<00:00:03.689> game<00:00:03.840> of

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020 
Anish did anything happen in the game of

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.200 
Anish did anything happen in the game of
Resident<00:00:04.470> uneventful<00:00:04.980> draw<00:00:05.339> okay<00:00:05.790> for<00:00:06.029> the

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
Resident uneventful draw okay for the

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:07.280 
Resident uneventful draw okay for the
two<00:00:06.330> of<00:00:06.450> us<00:00:06.569> something<00:00:06.930> and<00:00:07.049> all<00:00:07.109> the<00:00:07.200> things

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
two of us something and all the things

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:08.839 
two of us something and all the things
happen<00:00:07.620> but<00:00:07.740> probably<00:00:08.130> besides<00:00:08.460> not<00:00:08.670> much

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
happen but probably besides not much

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:10.549 
happen but probably besides not much
changed<00:00:09.150> in<00:00:09.269> the<00:00:09.360> world<00:00:09.540> yeah<00:00:09.690> with<00:00:10.230> this<00:00:10.349> game

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:10.559 
changed in the world yeah with this game

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.160 
changed in the world yeah with this game
but<00:00:10.920> basically<00:00:11.280> I<00:00:11.400> it<00:00:11.969> was<00:00:12.150> very<00:00:12.450> sub<00:00:12.870> so<00:00:13.019> what

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
but basically I it was very sub so what

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.140 
but basically I it was very sub so what
was<00:00:13.500> happening<00:00:13.620> in<00:00:13.920> the<00:00:14.099> opening<00:00:14.910> you<00:00:14.940> know<00:00:15.030> I

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
was happening in the opening you know I

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.510 
was happening in the opening you know I
was<00:00:15.330> playing<00:00:15.480> Quincy<00:00:15.900> -<00:00:16.109> then<00:00:16.890> I<00:00:17.010> was<00:00:17.130> starting

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
was playing Quincy - then I was starting

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:18.950 
was playing Quincy - then I was starting
with<00:00:17.730> Knight<00:00:17.850> f3<00:00:18.000> then<00:00:18.359> I<00:00:18.449> went<00:00:18.600> back<00:00:18.779> into

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
with Knight f3 then I went back into

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.450 
with Knight f3 then I went back into
some<00:00:19.199> mainline<00:00:19.770> but<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.100> thing<00:00:20.250> is<00:00:20.369> he

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
some mainline but the thing is he

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.130 
some mainline but the thing is he
doesn't<00:00:20.490> really<00:00:20.820> play<00:00:20.939> so<00:00:21.060> I<00:00:21.449> thought<00:00:21.960> it's

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
doesn't really play so I thought it's

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.960 
doesn't really play so I thought it's
very<00:00:22.320> clever<00:00:22.500> move<00:00:22.710> order<00:00:22.980> from<00:00:23.100> my<00:00:23.250> side<00:00:23.460> but

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
very clever move order from my side but

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.400 
very clever move order from my side but
he<00:00:24.090> looked<00:00:24.269> at<00:00:24.390> it<00:00:24.510> so<00:00:24.660> it<00:00:24.930> was<00:00:25.050> not<00:00:25.230> clever

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
he looked at it so it was not clever

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.950 
he looked at it so it was not clever
after<00:00:25.830> all<00:00:25.920> and<00:00:26.300> okay<00:00:27.300> he<00:00:27.480> played<00:00:27.660> Queen<00:00:27.840> d7

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
after all and okay he played Queen d7

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.830 
after all and okay he played Queen d7
and<00:00:28.320> I<00:00:28.820> either<00:00:29.820> don't<00:00:30.359> remember<00:00:30.660> well

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
and I either don't remember well

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.060 
and I either don't remember well
probably<00:00:31.050> haven't<00:00:31.410> really<00:00:31.590> seen<00:00:31.740> this<00:00:31.859> move

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
probably haven't really seen this move

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.889 
probably haven't really seen this move
in<00:00:32.250> this<00:00:32.460> particular<00:00:33.120> move<00:00:33.360> order<00:00:33.630> because

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
in this particular move order because

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:34.940 
in this particular move order because
the<00:00:33.989> case<00:00:34.140> strictly<00:00:34.500> speaking<00:00:34.559> I'm<00:00:34.829> not

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
the case strictly speaking I'm not

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.150 
the case strictly speaking I'm not
really<00:00:35.070> an<00:00:35.219> expert<00:00:35.489> there<00:00:35.670> at<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:36.600> moment<00:00:37.160> but

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
really an expert there at the moment but

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.030 
really an expert there at the moment but
then<00:00:38.520> okay<00:00:38.760> critical<00:00:39.180> is<00:00:39.270> Queen<00:00:39.420> c2<00:00:39.570> and<00:00:40.040> then

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
then okay critical is Queen c2 and then

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.190 
then okay critical is Queen c2 and then
I<00:00:41.129> was<00:00:41.219> calculating<00:00:41.309> c5<00:00:41.879> but<00:00:42.120> then<00:00:42.300> I<00:00:42.570> realized

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
I was calculating c5 but then I realized

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.680 
I was calculating c5 but then I realized
that<00:00:43.260> okay<00:00:43.649> I<00:00:43.680> can<00:00:43.920> calculate<00:00:44.070> but<00:00:44.730> eventually

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
that okay I can calculate but eventually

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:47.119 
that okay I can calculate but eventually
I<00:00:45.870> will<00:00:45.960> be<00:00:46.140> trying<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.440> make<00:00:46.590> a<00:00:46.620> draw<00:00:46.829> anyway

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
I will be trying to make a draw anyway

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.160 
I will be trying to make a draw anyway
so<00:00:47.700> I<00:00:47.730> thought<00:00:48.059> let's<00:00:48.300> play<00:00:48.480> safe<00:00:48.719> and<00:00:48.960> change

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
so I thought let's play safe and change

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.160 
so I thought let's play safe and change
quince<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.620> then<00:00:49.800> I<00:00:50.219> wasn't<00:00:51.180> really<00:00:51.420> thinking

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
quince and then I wasn't really thinking

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.729 
quince and then I wasn't really thinking
about<00:00:52.440> okay<00:00:52.890> I<00:00:52.920> mean<00:00:53.129> I<00:00:53.870> I<00:00:54.870> was<00:00:55.230> hoping<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.649> get

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
about okay I mean I I was hoping to get

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:56.930 
about okay I mean I I was hoping to get
a<00:00:55.800> chance<00:00:55.860> but<00:00:56.129> I<00:00:56.190> wasn't<00:00:56.399> really<00:00:56.520> thinking<00:00:56.699> I

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
a chance but I wasn't really thinking I

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.689 
a chance but I wasn't really thinking I
would<00:00:57.090> get<00:00:57.239> one<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:58.230> I<00:00:58.289> think<00:00:58.350> he<00:00:58.590> played<00:00:58.710> kind

00:00:59.689 --> 00:00:59.699 
would get one and I think he played kind

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.319 
would get one and I think he played kind
of<00:00:59.789> safe<00:01:00.180> yeah<00:01:00.510> with<00:01:00.750> his<00:01:00.840> moves<00:01:01.219> to<00:01:02.219> 224<00:01:02.789> there

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
of safe yeah with his moves to 224 there

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.030 
of safe yeah with his moves to 224 there
was<00:01:03.420> no<00:01:03.539> need<00:01:03.719> to<00:01:03.930> really<00:01:04.199> clarify<00:01:04.379> situation

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
was no need to really clarify situation

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.969 
was no need to really clarify situation
but<00:01:05.129> he<00:01:05.280> took<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:05.640> g5<00:01:05.909> and<00:01:06.180> change<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.479> bishop

00:01:06.969 --> 00:01:06.979 
but he took and g5 and change the bishop

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:11.120 
but he took and g5 and change the bishop
and<00:01:07.979> then<00:01:08.340> in<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:09.000> end<00:01:09.119> game<00:01:09.210> it<00:01:09.360> was<00:01:10.130> dorsum

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
and then in the end game it was dorsum

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.630 
and then in the end game it was dorsum
suffices<00:01:11.580> to<00:01:11.640> say<00:01:11.939> after<00:01:12.950> before<00:01:13.950> g4<00:01:14.400> he<00:01:14.490> might

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
suffices to say after before g4 he might

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.340 
suffices to say after before g4 he might
play<00:01:14.820> h5<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:15.479> then<00:01:15.570> f/4g<00:01:15.990> for<00:01:16.170> me<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.320> very

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
play h5 and then f/4g for me a very

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.130 
play h5 and then f/4g for me a very
strange<00:01:16.770> structure<00:01:17.009> but<00:01:17.310> he<00:01:18.060> has<00:01:18.180> bought<00:01:18.720> g4

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
strange structure but he has bought g4

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.960 
strange structure but he has bought g4
h5<00:01:19.439> which<00:01:19.470> I<00:01:19.770> think<00:01:19.950> are<00:01:20.040> good<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:20.460> I<00:01:20.580> have<00:01:20.670> one

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
h5 which I think are good and I have one

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.149 
h5 which I think are good and I have one
on<00:01:21.060> g2<00:01:21.330> which<00:01:22.049> could<00:01:22.229> be<00:01:22.320> weak<00:01:22.470> so<00:01:22.500> I<00:01:22.680> think<00:01:22.799> h5

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
on g2 which could be weak so I think h5

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:24.800 
on g2 which could be weak so I think h5
was<00:01:23.369> equalizing<00:01:23.790> but<00:01:23.939> then<00:01:24.060> he<00:01:24.210> allowed<00:01:24.299> g4

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
was equalizing but then he allowed g4

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.990 
was equalizing but then he allowed g4
and<00:01:24.990> then<00:01:25.530> nothing<00:01:25.830> is<00:01:26.369> happening<00:01:26.520> so<00:01:26.880> I<00:01:26.909> think

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
and then nothing is happening so I think

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.730 
and then nothing is happening so I think
I<00:01:27.450> would<00:01:27.720> offer<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.170> drawing<00:01:28.439> couple<00:01:28.650> of

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
I would offer the drawing couple of

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.060 
I would offer the drawing couple of
moves<00:01:28.920> I<00:01:29.130> think<00:01:29.610> he<00:01:29.670> decided<00:01:29.939> to<00:01:30.060> go<00:01:30.750> h5<00:01:31.140> so<00:01:31.979> he

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
moves I think he decided to go h5 so he

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:33.499 
moves I think he decided to go h5 so he
decided<00:01:32.310> to<00:01:32.490> kind<00:01:32.610> of<00:01:32.700> equalize<00:01:32.850> an<00:01:33.299> equal

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
decided to kind of equalize an equal

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.630 
decided to kind of equalize an equal
position<00:01:33.600> and<00:01:34.079> then<00:01:34.650> I<00:01:34.770> got<00:01:35.009> some<00:01:35.280> hoes

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
position and then I got some hoes

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.330 
position and then I got some hoes
because<00:01:35.850> he<00:01:36.060> misplaced<00:01:36.450> his<00:01:36.659> pieces<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:37.340> my

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
because he misplaced his pieces and my

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.600 
because he misplaced his pieces and my
name<00:01:38.490> is<00:01:38.610> getting<00:01:38.759> to<00:01:38.909> c4<00:01:39.299> but<00:01:40.079> he<00:01:40.229> found<00:01:40.610> found

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
name is getting to c4 but he found found

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.039 
name is getting to c4 but he found found
an<00:01:41.850> interesting<00:01:42.210> way<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:42.390> solve<00:01:42.630> his<00:01:42.689> problem

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
an interesting way to solve his problem

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.050 
an interesting way to solve his problem
so<00:01:43.170> I<00:01:43.229> would<00:01:43.409> have<00:01:43.500> six<00:01:43.710> and<00:01:44.040> then<00:01:44.729> actually<00:01:45.030> I

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
so I would have six and then actually I

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.260 
so I would have six and then actually I
did<00:01:45.329> have<00:01:45.479> a<00:01:45.540> chance<00:01:45.810> at<00:01:45.990> some<00:01:46.140> point<00:01:46.549> I<00:01:47.549> could

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
did have a chance at some point I could

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.149 
did have a chance at some point I could
play<00:01:48.420> e5<00:01:48.960> check<00:01:49.470> 85<00:01:50.100> 90<00:01:50.520> for<00:01:50.729> King<00:01:51.030> see<00:01:51.149> 795<00:01:52.159> 94

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
play e5 check 85 90 for King see 795 94

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.399 
play e5 check 85 90 for King see 795 94
and<00:01:53.399> now<00:01:53.490> he<00:01:53.549> turns<00:01:53.939> 92<00:01:54.479> and<00:01:54.600> 95<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.170> I<00:01:55.229> missed

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
and now he turns 92 and 95 and I missed

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.530 
and now he turns 92 and 95 and I missed
King<00:01:55.619> F<00:01:55.710> to<00:01:55.860> move<00:01:56.040> back<00:01:56.280> and<00:01:56.430> then<00:01:57.090> position

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
King F to move back and then position

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.389 
King F to move back and then position
gets<00:01:57.719> very<00:01:57.869> sharp<00:01:58.140> we<00:01:58.590> discussed<00:01:59.159> it<00:01:59.280> in

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
gets very sharp we discussed it in

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.240 
gets very sharp we discussed it in
analysis<00:01:59.790> for<00:01:59.909> a<00:01:59.969> long<00:02:00.090> time<00:02:00.270> because

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250 
analysis for a long time because

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.560 
analysis for a long time because
actually<00:02:02.250> if<00:02:02.610> he<00:02:02.850> doesn't<00:02:03.149> do<00:02:03.360> anything

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
actually if he doesn't do anything

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.450 
actually if he doesn't do anything
concrete<00:02:03.810> I'm<00:02:04.079> just<00:02:04.350> better<00:02:04.500> by<00:02:05.040> because<00:02:05.369> of

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
concrete I'm just better by because of

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.520 
concrete I'm just better by because of
my<00:02:05.549> structure<00:02:05.790> but<00:02:06.600> okay<00:02:06.840> it<00:02:06.930> was<00:02:07.049> it<00:02:07.229> becomes

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
my structure but okay it was it becomes

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.469 
my structure but okay it was it becomes
very<00:02:07.649> sharp<00:02:07.920> and<00:02:08.129> clear<00:02:08.610> but<00:02:09.090> the<00:02:09.149> problem<00:02:09.420> is

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
very sharp and clear but the problem is

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.390 
very sharp and clear but the problem is
I<00:02:09.569> didn't<00:02:09.780> even<00:02:09.899> seeking<00:02:10.140> f2<00:02:10.500> so

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
I didn't even seeking f2 so

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.430 
I didn't even seeking f2 so
so<00:02:12.180> yeah<00:02:12.330> I<00:02:12.360> thought<00:02:12.569> if<00:02:12.720> six<00:02:12.900> was<00:02:13.049> just<00:02:13.260> good

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
so yeah I thought if six was just good

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.059 
so yeah I thought if six was just good
and<00:02:13.650> I<00:02:14.930> mean<00:02:15.930> I<00:02:16.170> was<00:02:16.260> hoping<00:02:16.500> for<00:02:16.560> night<00:02:16.769> of<00:02:16.890> six

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
and I mean I was hoping for night of six

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.430 
and I mean I was hoping for night of six
and<00:02:17.280> then<00:02:17.580> I<00:02:17.610> would<00:02:17.849> idea<00:02:18.060> 97<00:02:18.569> back<00:02:18.720> but<00:02:19.319> then

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
and then I would idea 97 back but then

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:20.990 
and then I would idea 97 back but then
I'm<00:02:19.530> getting<00:02:19.860> some<00:02:20.040> move<00:02:20.190> likely<00:02:20.400> five<00:02:20.730> and

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
I'm getting some move likely five and

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.059 
I'm getting some move likely five and
some<00:02:21.959> chances<00:02:22.260> but<00:02:22.440> you<00:02:22.560> have<00:02:22.680> to<00:02:22.799> have<00:02:22.860> six

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
some chances but you have to have six

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.720 
some chances but you have to have six
okay<00:02:23.340> I<00:02:23.370> I<00:02:23.879> lost<00:02:24.629> that<00:02:25.129> optimism<00:02:26.129> that<00:02:26.310> I<00:02:26.549> had

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
okay I I lost that optimism that I had

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.509 
okay I I lost that optimism that I had
four<00:02:26.940> four<00:02:27.209> one<00:02:27.239> move<00:02:27.769> so<00:02:28.769> a<00:02:28.799> lot<00:02:29.069> more<00:02:29.250> happen

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519 
four four one move so a lot more happen

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:30.500 
four four one move so a lot more happen
than<00:02:29.670> we<00:02:29.819> thought

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510
