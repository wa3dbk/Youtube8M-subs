00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 hello and welcome example 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.330
 with me children's toys I have today 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.639
 an experiment box from the brand 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.639
 cosmos and that is suitable for children 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.080
 from five years and it will be synonymous 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.150
 then the knowledge kick for the 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.760
 School start so nice for preschool children 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.570
 The instructions are also suitable in 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.539
 images 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.960
 and there you can easily 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:27.599
 I get to know natural laws and I see 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.480
 the normal to it are in the set 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.990
 contain 29 experiments that you make 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.710
 can 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.030
 eight models and 48 pages in one 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.230
 described 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.940
 everything in pictures and here you can see 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.190
 already exemplary for that reason 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:47.340
 magnifies a magnifying glass as so iridescent 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:50.280
 So why soap bubbles floating boats 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.860
 a lot of simple things the children 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:55.289
 ask yourself in preschool age and you 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:59.280
 get out with this set 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.690
 or we can experience our set 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.739
 now also look a little closer 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.659
 and I will open it now 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:11.100
 You can do that with the experiment box 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:13.680
 open and up there I show you 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:17.960
 time your experimentation guide 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.960
 you can find below in the box 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:30.200
 Okay, let's see what's going on 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:39.729
 that's the first thing in there 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:43.369
 plastic foil and there are some things 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:47.060
 described I think you can 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:49.310
 so that the team from then on everything 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.860
 flies or sonys again recognizes what 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.140
 but everything is contained so I look 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.420
 I once as cress are 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.729
 contain 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.380
 then here is apparently a small one 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:03.670
 lid or something I know now 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:11.049
 not what it is a small flower pot 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:15.410
 a small styrofoam provided a funnel 

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:22.360
 a little stromer ball still such a 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:22.360
 cover here a great one for a submarine 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:30.889
 Suction cup the blanket might be fine here 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:35.930
 still fit in now what seizes so then 

00:02:30.889 --> 00:02:39.530
 we have such a small plastic yes 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:41.810
 small plastic container thought it would be 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:44.209
 a dose can also be used as 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.130
 but I think you will be the whole 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:53.170
 maybe because it is single 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:53.170
 Can use good fat paper clip 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:03:02.239
 front down here it is such a circle 

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:05.329
 Maybe one could for 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:07.120
 Soap bubbles are also right here 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:11.840
 in this bowl 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:19.909
 then a wool thread is one 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:36.579
 small styrofoam plate so here is one 

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:36.579
 Spinner small measuring cup a magnifying glass the 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:48.650
 what exactly I do not know could do that 

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:51.350
 be a small stand or maybe 

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.090
 you can balance it or something like that 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:57.080
 is made of plastic in any case 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:04:04.160
 also very stable and this is kneading 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:11.260
 I think here we have two more 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:13.910
 pipette some straws once so 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.590
 even straws and straws 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:18.760
 the here such a poke have such a 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:21.799
 knips knew they are actually all 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:23.630
 who are here are red and blue, the 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:28.360
 Christoph such a little house with 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:32.440
 this is very stable plastic yes 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:34.730
 that's all included 

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.530
 now I have the whole time high at 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:39.310
 under it is still the experiment 

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:39.310
 his lawyer 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:45.680
 and there is still a lot there 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:48.620
 among not only the experimental 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.860
 enticement is not everything not come out with 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.860
 one 

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:05.270
 Here I have a paper 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:08.190
 several paper bags press three paper 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:12.600
 a book of natural laws that's right 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:14.100
 A thicker page had 48 pages 

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.530
 I already said and here are 

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:24.630
 really a lot of experiments and all 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:27.030
 with pictures a little brother relative 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:31.970
 big plastic bag after about four 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:31.970
 large will live a clip closure 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:39.690
 here is to the bow there are different 

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:44.160
 pictures and this looks like that 

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:48.810
 frame here that looks like one 

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:57.000
 template for a paper airplane very 

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:58.260
 beautiful is also a template for him 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.650
 hates and on the back is still 

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:08.810
 By the way, something else here as well and 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:16.230
 not here that host paper 

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:20.460
 as of coffee filters are also some 

00:06:16.230 --> 00:06:22.890
 with it and here is such a pipe 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:26.700
 template because you can so different 

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:29.310
 Figures and circles all push out 

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:31.400
 So how do you become for the attempts 

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:34.760
 all need 

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:36.690
 yes that's all included in the set 

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:39.240
 you can even in the comments 

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:41.280
 Write how he finds that if only 

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:43.020
 stooping impression on you and whether 

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:45.390
 her pleasure that I have here a few 

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:48.000
 experiments by lead with you 

00:06:45.390 --> 00:06:49.590
 if so, write that in the comments 

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.660
 and then i will do something nice for you 

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:53.190
 Find out and make some laws 

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:56.850
 few laws of nature with you times 

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:58.430
 check and like the video 

00:06:56.850 --> 00:07:00.990
 gave me a thumbs up 

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:03.330
 Write me in the comments like you 

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:05.930
 that finds and if you like me 

00:07:03.330 --> 00:07:08.449
 to experiment with experiments 

00:07:05.930 --> 00:07:10.759
 and otherwise ours will look 

00:07:08.449 --> 00:07:12.590
 videos subscribe to our channel in case you 

00:07:10.759 --> 00:07:15.490
 have not yet subscribed and we see 

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:15.490
 us again next time
