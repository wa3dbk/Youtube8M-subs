00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:06.770
 hello today we are going to prepare a skewer of 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:09.650
 zucchini with ham and cheese 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:11.990
 ingredients a cooked ham courgette 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.440
 sliced ​​piquillo peppers 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:16.599
 and an egg 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:19.029
 we started cutting the zucchini in 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:22.349
 thin slices and alves to get 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:22.349
 some elongated slices 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.420
 then we beat an egg and 

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.970
 we add the slices we will not use 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.720
 flour to coat only the 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:42.720
 I beaten egg 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.739
 Now we fry them in the pan with a 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:56.030
 little oil we will do it on low heat 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.030
 so that the egg does not burn 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:05.449
 Once fried, drain the oil 

00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:07.759
 placing it on kitchen paper 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:09.619
 the next step is to make the iron 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:12.789
 the ham and the cheese that we have assembled 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:12.789
 with a rectangular shape 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.890
 when the cheese starts to melt 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.890
 we remove 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.200
 finally we cut the bread also to 

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:26.920
 Bios to get the slices 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.920
 elongated 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.150
 and all that remains is to mount the skewer 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:36.659
 place the slices of 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.659

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.050
 ham with cheese 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.640
 and finish with another slice of zucchini 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.490
 decorate with thin strips of 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:56.490
