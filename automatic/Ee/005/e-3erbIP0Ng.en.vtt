I've<00:00:02.970> just<00:00:03.000> got<00:00:03.270> a<00:00:03.300> couple<00:00:03.480> quick<00:00:03.750> tips<00:00:03.810> for

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:04.170 
I've just got a couple quick tips for

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:07.780 
I've just got a couple quick tips for
animation<00:00:04.620> cancelling<00:00:04.859> let's<00:00:05.730> get<00:00:05.879> started

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:07.790 
animation cancelling let's get started

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:09.980 
animation cancelling let's get started
there's<00:00:08.790> a<00:00:08.849> trick<00:00:09.120> you<00:00:09.150> can<00:00:09.420> use<00:00:09.570> with<00:00:09.750> flash

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
there's a trick you can use with flash

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.330 
there's a trick you can use with flash
in<00:00:10.230> order<00:00:10.380> to<00:00:10.590> get<00:00:10.710> your<00:00:10.830> abilities<00:00:11.190> off

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
in order to get your abilities off

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.339 
in order to get your abilities off
faster<00:00:11.910> and<00:00:12.120> it<00:00:12.540> works<00:00:12.719> with<00:00:12.929> a<00:00:12.960> lot<00:00:13.049> more

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
faster and it works with a lot more

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.200 
faster and it works with a lot more
abilities<00:00:13.769> than<00:00:13.860> you<00:00:13.950> might<00:00:14.130> think<00:00:14.490> you<00:00:15.059> can

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
abilities than you might think you can

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.480 
abilities than you might think you can
actually<00:00:15.420> cast<00:00:15.900> an<00:00:16.139> ability<00:00:16.379> before<00:00:16.710> flashing

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
actually cast an ability before flashing

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:20.300 
actually cast an ability before flashing
and<00:00:17.640> flash<00:00:18.150> during<00:00:18.720> the<00:00:18.990> cast<00:00:19.289> time<00:00:19.619> and<00:00:19.890> then

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
and flash during the cast time and then

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.130 
and flash during the cast time and then
your<00:00:20.460> champion<00:00:20.880> will<00:00:21.029> flash<00:00:21.330> and<00:00:21.630> immediately

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
your champion will flash and immediately

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.349 
your champion will flash and immediately
cast<00:00:22.470> the<00:00:22.710> ability<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.910> reason<00:00:24.180> why<00:00:24.300> this

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
cast the ability the reason why this

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.330 
cast the ability the reason why this
works<00:00:24.720> is<00:00:24.869> because<00:00:25.050> flash<00:00:25.500> is<00:00:25.529> an<00:00:25.859> instant

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
works is because flash is an instant

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.250 
works is because flash is an instant
cast<00:00:26.519> ability<00:00:27.060> and<00:00:27.269> so<00:00:27.689> you<00:00:27.779> can<00:00:27.930> use<00:00:28.080> it<00:00:28.109> to

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
cast ability and so you can use it to

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.130 
cast ability and so you can use it to
animation<00:00:28.949> cancel<00:00:29.460> the<00:00:29.939> ability<00:00:30.359> with<00:00:30.660> a<00:00:30.869> cast

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
animation cancel the ability with a cast

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.290 
animation cancel the ability with a cast
time<00:00:31.439> allowing<00:00:32.430> you<00:00:32.520> to<00:00:32.640> input<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.149> command

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
time allowing you to input the command

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.720 
time allowing you to input the command
to<00:00:33.750> use<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:34.079> ability<00:00:34.200> then<00:00:34.710> flash<00:00:35.100> instead<00:00:35.579> of

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
to use the ability then flash instead of

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.610 
to use the ability then flash instead of
having<00:00:35.910> to<00:00:36.120> flash<00:00:36.360> then<00:00:36.750> use<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.170> ability

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
having to flash then use the ability

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.130 
having to flash then use the ability
overall<00:00:38.489> pulling<00:00:38.850> off<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.149> entire<00:00:39.450> combo<00:00:39.960> a

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
overall pulling off the entire combo a

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.979 
overall pulling off the entire combo a
pretty<00:00:40.770> decent<00:00:41.160> amount<00:00:41.219> faster<00:00:41.940> this<00:00:42.540> trick

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
pretty decent amount faster this trick

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.020 
pretty decent amount faster this trick
works<00:00:43.290> on<00:00:43.469> any<00:00:43.739> ability<00:00:44.370> in<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.579> game<00:00:44.610> that

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
works on any ability in the game that

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.600 
works on any ability in the game that
can<00:00:45.180> be<00:00:45.270> cast<00:00:45.539> at<00:00:45.780> max<00:00:46.050> range<00:00:46.440> by<00:00:47.010> placing<00:00:47.520> your

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
can be cast at max range by placing your

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.299 
can be cast at max range by placing your
cursor<00:00:47.670> outside<00:00:48.300> of<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.899> range<00:00:49.170> if<00:00:49.559> you<00:00:50.100> move

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
cursor outside of the range if you move

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:51.860 
cursor outside of the range if you move
your<00:00:50.489> mouse<00:00:50.520> outside<00:00:51.300> of<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.539> range<00:00:51.719> of<00:00:51.809> the

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
your mouse outside of the range of the

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.750 
your mouse outside of the range of the
ability<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:52.559> then<00:00:52.920> your<00:00:53.010> character<00:00:53.370> tries<00:00:53.579> to

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
ability and then your character tries to

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.729 
ability and then your character tries to
walk<00:00:54.030> to<00:00:54.420> the<00:00:54.510> range<00:00:54.750> rather<00:00:55.260> than<00:00:55.500> just

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
walk to the range rather than just

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.590 
walk to the range rather than just
instantly<00:00:56.250> casting<00:00:56.789> the<00:00:56.879> ability<00:00:57.239> at<00:00:57.329> max

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
instantly casting the ability at max

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.720 
instantly casting the ability at max
range<00:00:57.899> this<00:00:58.469> trick<00:00:58.770> will<00:00:58.920> not<00:00:59.100> work<00:00:59.430> with<00:00:59.609> that

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
range this trick will not work with that

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.389 
range this trick will not work with that
ability<00:01:00.260> the<00:01:01.260> trick<00:01:01.530> actually<00:01:01.739> works<00:01:02.160> with

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
ability the trick actually works with

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.399 
ability the trick actually works with
any<00:01:02.640> ability<00:01:03.030> in<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.180> game<00:01:03.210> that<00:01:03.510> has<00:01:03.690> no<00:01:04.080> cast

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
any ability in the game that has no cast

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.620 
any ability in the game that has no cast
time<00:01:04.710> so<00:01:05.220> it<00:01:05.339> doesn't<00:01:05.670> have<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:05.850> only<00:01:06.150> be<00:01:06.360> with

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
time so it doesn't have to only be with

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.870 
time so it doesn't have to only be with
flash<00:01:06.930> it's<00:01:07.530> just<00:01:07.799> that<00:01:07.920> with<00:01:08.130> flash<00:01:08.430> it's<00:01:08.729> the

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
flash it's just that with flash it's the

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.609 
flash it's just that with flash it's the
most<00:01:09.030> useful<00:01:09.600> one<00:01:09.780> since<00:01:10.049> it<00:01:10.140> allows<00:01:10.350> you<00:01:10.530> to

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
most useful one since it allows you to

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.710 
most useful one since it allows you to
make<00:01:10.740> those<00:01:10.950> flash<00:01:11.280> skill<00:01:11.640> shop<00:01:11.880> plays<00:01:12.150> much

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
make those flash skill shop plays much

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.140 
make those flash skill shop plays much
quicker<00:01:13.020> this<00:01:14.010> is<00:01:14.189> why<00:01:14.310> riot<00:01:14.610> is<00:01:14.790> so<00:01:14.970> hesitant

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
quicker this is why riot is so hesitant

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.999 
quicker this is why riot is so hesitant
to<00:01:15.450> make<00:01:15.570> champions<00:01:15.900> have<00:01:16.290> abilities<00:01:16.740> with<00:01:16.890> no

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:17.009 
to make champions have abilities with no

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:18.859 
to make champions have abilities with no
cast<00:01:17.340> times<00:01:17.640> since<00:01:18.240> it<00:01:18.360> allows<00:01:18.570> you<00:01:18.780> to

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
cast times since it allows you to

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.170 
cast times since it allows you to
animation<00:01:19.439> cancel<00:01:19.830> quite<00:01:20.070> easily<00:01:20.369> for

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
animation cancel quite easily for

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.210 
animation cancel quite easily for
example<00:01:21.210> take<00:01:21.750> a<00:01:21.780> look<00:01:21.869> at<00:01:22.110> Riven<00:01:22.439> her<00:01:22.890> shield

example take a look at Riven her shield
has<00:01:23.400> no<00:01:23.640> cast<00:01:23.939> time<00:01:24.180> and<00:01:24.360> because<00:01:25.020> of<00:01:25.140> it<00:01:25.229> there

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
has no cast time and because of it there

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.960 
has no cast time and because of it there
is<00:01:25.439> a<00:01:25.500> huge<00:01:25.770> necessity<00:01:26.400> for<00:01:26.610> you<00:01:26.700> to<00:01:26.850> be

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
is a huge necessity for you to be

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:28.969 
is a huge necessity for you to be

you to get the whole combo off much much

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.740 
you to get the whole combo off much much

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
faster and I guess since we're talking

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.690 
faster and I guess since we're talking
about<00:01:46.020> animation<00:01:46.439> cancelling<00:01:46.770> abilities<00:01:47.340> we

about animation cancelling abilities we

about animation cancelling abilities we

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
might as well go over how to do it with

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.020 
might as well go over how to do it with
auto<00:01:49.350> attacks<00:01:49.680> too<00:01:49.920> even<00:01:50.549> though<00:01:50.640> it<00:01:50.790> is<00:01:50.909> a

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
auto attacks too even though it is a

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.660 
auto attacks too even though it is a
much<00:01:51.240> more<00:01:51.479> known<00:01:51.720> concept<00:01:52.320> anyways<00:01:53.220> just<00:01:53.250> for

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
much more known concept anyways just for

those who don't know the thing to

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.209 
those who don't know the thing to
understand<00:01:55.140> is<00:01:55.259> that<00:01:55.290> auto<00:01:55.590> attacks<00:01:55.979> have<00:01:56.189> a

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
understand is that auto attacks have a

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.100 
understand is that auto attacks have a
cool-down<00:01:56.490> in-between<00:01:57.240> each<00:01:57.270> other<00:01:57.570> that

cool-down in-between each other that

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.749 
cool-down in-between each other that
lasts<00:01:58.469> for<00:01:58.590> about<00:01:58.680> half<00:01:59.009> the<00:01:59.219> time<00:01:59.369> it<00:01:59.549> takes

lasts for about half the time it takes

lasts for about half the time it takes

for you to auto attack during this you

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.859 
for you to auto attack during this you
can<00:02:02.130> use<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.369> time<00:02:02.549> to<00:02:02.579> move<00:02:02.909> around<00:02:03.060> cast<00:02:03.689> an
