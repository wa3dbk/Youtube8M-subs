00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.359
 do you all know so not come out on the island 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.880
 d'olÃ©ron so there are some who had fun 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:12.660
 to write it on the sand bah I think that 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.730
 to make the age of the beginning of the video 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.990
 but if i find something eh ben 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:23.779
 I showed you the frame will veil the 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.779
 beach to the east boillat rck and there 

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:36.270
 that's no, but I understand more so 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:39.180
 not just there a 10 cent coin 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:42.149
 1985 franc 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:47.039

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:48.090

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.379

 I took 10 centimes still francs 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.690
 but right there in the hole I played at 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:00.149
 about five meters I made 5 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.829
 centimes of France so there is a 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:06.030
 little bit of frank had to come down with 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:09.540
