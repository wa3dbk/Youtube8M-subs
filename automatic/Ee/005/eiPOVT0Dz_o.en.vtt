features of this device four da be it's

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.469 
features of this device four da be it's
important<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.259> note<00:01:37.439> that<00:01:37.710> the<00:01:38.189> chip<00:01:38.700> has<00:01:39.090> up

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
important to note that the chip has up

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.160 
important to note that the chip has up
to<00:01:39.750> two<00:01:40.020> tunas<00:01:40.470> on<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:41.520> silicon<00:01:42.479> which<00:01:42.930> means

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
to two tunas on the silicon which means

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.249 
to two tunas on the silicon which means
that<00:01:43.409> you<00:01:43.860> can<00:01:43.979> have<00:01:44.369> one<00:01:45.299> tuna<00:01:45.750> for<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.079> main

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
that you can have one tuna for the main

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.100 
that you can have one tuna for the main
audio<00:01:46.649> service<00:01:47.130> and<00:01:47.310> a<00:01:47.850> second<00:01:48.299> tuna<00:01:48.659> for<00:01:49.079> a

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
audio service and a second tuna for a

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.719 
audio service and a second tuna for a
station<00:01:49.409> list<00:01:49.770> update<00:01:50.100> in<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.250> background

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
station list update in the background

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.380 
station list update in the background
for<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:51.590> data<00:01:52.590> service<00:01:53.070> reception<00:01:53.670> for<00:01:54.000> for

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
for a data service reception for for

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.080 
for a data service reception for for
traffic<00:01:54.810> information<00:01:55.079> that<00:01:55.530> you<00:01:55.649> can<00:01:55.799> receive

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
traffic information that you can receive

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.389 
traffic information that you can receive
so<00:01:57.090> it<00:01:57.390> really<00:01:57.600> scales<00:01:58.259> to<00:01:58.619> also<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:58.979> advance

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
so it really scales to also the advance

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.950 
so it really scales to also the advance
to<00:01:59.729> da<00:01:59.909> be<00:02:00.119> systems<00:02:01.250> for<00:02:02.250> HD<00:02:02.490> radio<00:02:02.790> also<00:02:03.689> it's

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
to da be systems for HD radio also it's

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.959 
to da be systems for HD radio also it's
important<00:02:04.409> to<00:02:04.469> note<00:02:04.649> that<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:05.640> device

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
important to note that the device

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.400 
important to note that the device
supports<00:02:06.600> maximum<00:02:07.380> ratio<00:02:07.590> combining

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:08.410 
supports maximum ratio combining

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:10.710 
supports maximum ratio combining
so<00:02:09.040> you<00:02:09.100> can<00:02:09.370> have<00:02:09.640> two<00:02:09.970> antennae<00:02:10.150> powers

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
so you can have two antennae powers

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.140 
so you can have two antennae powers
combined<00:02:11.230> into<00:02:11.680> one<00:02:11.710> much<00:02:12.460> better<00:02:12.520> reception

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
combined into one much better reception

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:15.270 
combined into one much better reception
