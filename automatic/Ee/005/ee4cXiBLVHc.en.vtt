00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:04.000
 I can only follow a little more 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.100
 I do it for him And I would do it again 

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:15.000
 I do it for him I mean, I'll do it for them Stay strong 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.600
 Keep my mind in focus As I struggle up 

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:29.500
 Love will be my key One day, two days Will more time pass? 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.600
 Quick? And since it fights up Save my chains 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.100
 in it Stay weak weak 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.700
 Keep my mind focused! Pathetic! 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.500
 and how she is fighting above. Do you really think you can win? 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.700
 One day, two days Yes, but you can not take care of me forever! 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:54.700
 Everything that is missing, everything that will not give me on the battlefield 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:02.000
 When everything is chaos and you will find nothing but an empty shell your power to 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.900
 control the mines you just have to think about life WHAT I will take my glory after 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.600
 from the war! And I do it for myself, I know I can win! 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:16.400
 I do it for me, that is, escape from the sea! 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.300
 Deep down they know they were not built for the fight, 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.900
 But that does not mean that I'm not willing to batt 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:38.000
 What they do not know is my real advantage! When it has been abandoned, you are ready to die 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
 Deep down I know, I'm just a weak gem. Exactly! 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
 But I know that I can follow these chains and fight (which can keep these chains in spite) 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 With my short existence (No!) I can make a difference! (You can not!) 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
 I can stay here for him, I can do this right! 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.000
 I can do it for him! And I would do it again (You can not do this to me) I do it for him! 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
 YOU CAN NOT DO THIS PARATE! 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.000
 and now I will say that I will do it for them
