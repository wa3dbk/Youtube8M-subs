00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:02.530 
to have if you're building your own I
can't<00:05:01.160> one<00:05:01.370> by<00:05:01.550> one<00:05:01.820> I<00:05:02.000> don't<00:05:02.060> think<00:05:02.390> you

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:02.540 
can't one by one I don't think you

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:05.710 
can't one by one I don't think you
really<00:05:02.810> need<00:05:02.960> this<00:05:03.170> but<00:05:03.500> I<00:05:04.490> do<00:05:04.970> like<00:05:05.300> the<00:05:05.480> brush

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:05.720

I<00:05:05.990> wouldn't<00:05:06.500> mind<00:05:06.890> having<00:05:07.460> this<00:05:07.760> in<00:05:07.820> the<00:05:08.090> can<00:05:08.330> I

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:08.540 
I wouldn't mind having this in the can I

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:11.140 
I wouldn't mind having this in the can I
think<00:05:08.600> it<00:05:08.990> was<00:05:09.200> kind<00:05:10.010> of<00:05:10.100> with<00:05:10.340> it<00:05:10.550> paying<00:05:11.030> for

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.150 
think it was kind of with it paying for

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:14.500 
think it was kind of with it paying for
it<00:05:11.450> but<00:05:12.020> yeah<00:05:12.470> it's<00:05:13.130> just<00:05:13.490> a<00:05:13.760> whatever<00:05:14.120> brush

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:14.510 
it but yeah it's just a whatever brush

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:19.200 
it but yeah it's just a whatever brush
to<00:05:14.780> me<00:05:15.280> so<00:05:16.280> this<00:05:16.490> is<00:05:16.730> the<00:05:17.000> e30<00:05:17.870> pencil<00:05:18.500> brush

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:19.210 
to me so this is the e30 pencil brush

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:22.900 
to me so this is the e30 pencil brush
it's<00:05:20.210> I<00:05:20.890> don't<00:05:21.890> really<00:05:22.130> think<00:05:22.250> this<00:05:22.700> is<00:05:22.730> a

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:22.910 
it's I don't really think this is a

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:25.840 
it's I don't really think this is a
necessary<00:05:23.210> brush<00:05:23.870> again<00:05:24.530> some<00:05:25.340> other<00:05:25.370> brushes

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:25.850 
necessary brush again some other brushes

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:32.270 
guess you can use this for like shading

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:35.590 
guess you can use this for like shading
the<00:05:32.720> bottom<00:05:33.530> part<00:05:34.100> of<00:05:34.250> your<00:05:34.430> eye<00:05:34.580> like<00:05:35.060> your

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:35.600 
the bottom part of your eye like your

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:38.230 
the bottom part of your eye like your
bottom<00:05:36.500> eyelids<00:05:36.980> I<00:05:37.190> guess<00:05:37.400> and<00:05:37.700> the<00:05:38.000> inner

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:38.240 
bottom eyelids I guess and the inner

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:41.140 
bottom eyelids I guess and the inner
core<00:05:38.480> outer<00:05:38.660> corners<00:05:39.260> I<00:05:39.290> need<00:05:39.620> but<00:05:40.430> I<00:05:40.820> just

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:41.150 
core outer corners I need but I just

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:43.570 
core outer corners I need but I just
don't<00:05:41.450> think<00:05:41.630> it<00:05:41.990> picks<00:05:42.230> up<00:05:42.470> product<00:05:43.160> very

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:43.580 
don't think it picks up product very

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:46.659 
don't think it picks up product very
well<00:05:43.970> you<00:05:44.419> need<00:05:44.660> to<00:05:45.020> apply<00:05:45.950> it<00:05:46.010> multiple<00:05:46.610> times

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:46.669 
well you need to apply it multiple times

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:51.909 
well you need to apply it multiple times
and<00:05:47.860> it's<00:05:48.860> just<00:05:49.010> not<00:05:49.910> that<00:05:50.180> great<00:05:50.840> I<00:05:51.290> gave<00:05:51.710> it<00:05:51.830> a

and it's just not that great I gave it a
6<00:05:52.190> but<00:05:52.400> I'm<00:05:52.550> changed<00:05:53.300> it<00:05:53.419> to<00:05:53.600> a<00:05:53.630> 5<00:05:54.020> because<00:05:54.380> I

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:54.860 
6 but I'm changed it to a 5 because I

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:57.280 
6 but I'm changed it to a 5 because I
don't<00:05:55.640> know<00:05:55.730> I<00:05:55.760> just<00:05:55.850> don't<00:05:56.660> think<00:05:56.990> you<00:05:57.110> need

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:57.290 
don't know I just don't think you need

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:59.680 
don't know I just don't think you need
it<00:05:57.440> and<00:05:57.710> yeah<00:05:58.340> it<00:05:58.520> doesn't<00:05:58.700> pick<00:05:59.000> up<00:05:59.030> my<00:05:59.390> shadow

00:05:59.680 --> 00:05:59.690 
it and yeah it doesn't pick up my shadow

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:03.310 
it and yeah it doesn't pick up my shadow
like<00:06:00.020> it's<00:06:00.350> passed<00:06:00.650> on<00:06:00.830> the<00:06:01.010> Panda<00:06:01.460> paper<00:06:02.320> this

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:03.320 
like it's passed on the Panda paper this

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:08.500 
like it's passed on the Panda paper this
is<00:06:03.560> the<00:06:03.700> e65<00:06:04.700> brush<00:06:05.210> it<00:06:05.630> is<00:06:06.110> an<00:06:06.790> small<00:06:07.790> angled

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:08.510 
is the e65 brush it is an small angled

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:12.460 
is the e65 brush it is an small angled
brush<00:06:08.930> I<00:06:09.290> think<00:06:10.130> this<00:06:10.400> brush<00:06:10.729> is<00:06:11.110> nice<00:06:12.110> to<00:06:12.350> the

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:12.470 
brush I think this brush is nice to the

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:14.530 
brush I think this brush is nice to the
collection<00:06:12.979> because<00:06:13.370> you<00:06:13.400> need<00:06:13.850> an<00:06:14.120> eyeliner

00:06:18.969 --> 00:06:18.979 
brush or you can use this for eyebrows

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:22.659 
brush or you can use this for eyebrows
but<00:06:19.460> it's<00:06:19.880> really<00:06:20.600> nothing<00:06:21.290> that<00:06:21.560> special<00:06:22.340> I

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:22.669 
but it's really nothing that special I

00:06:22.669 --> 00:06:23.820 
but it's really nothing that special I
don't<00:06:22.729> find<00:06:23.150> this

the lines of eyeliner this is really
good<00:06:58.510> for<00:06:58.810> that<00:06:58.930> but<00:06:59.370> for<00:07:00.370> model<00:07:00.640> it's<00:07:00.880> like<00:07:01.240> me

this<00:07:01.870> brush<00:07:02.140> is<00:07:02.350> basically<00:07:02.980> useless<00:07:03.550> that's

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:04.420 
this brush is basically useless that's

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:06.480 
this brush is basically useless that's
why<00:07:04.600> I<00:07:04.630> gave<00:07:04.900> it<00:07:05.140> a<00:07:05.380> 7<00:07:05.650> out<00:07:05.980> of<00:07:06.040> 10

00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:06.490 
why I gave it a 7 out of 10

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:09.060 
why I gave it a 7 out of 10
but<00:07:07.150> um<00:07:07.450> that's<00:07:08.020> just<00:07:08.200> personal<00:07:08.800> preference

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:09.070 
but um that's just personal preference

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:11.580 
but um that's just personal preference
and<00:07:09.700> if<00:07:10.180> I<00:07:10.330> were<00:07:10.480> to<00:07:10.510> use<00:07:10.840> this<00:07:11.020> brush<00:07:11.290> I<00:07:11.530> would

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:11.590 
and if I were to use this brush I would

00:07:11.590 --> 00:07:13.620 
and if I were to use this brush I would
use<00:07:11.920> it<00:07:12.070> with<00:07:12.250> the<00:07:12.400> Bobbi<00:07:12.610> Brown<00:07:12.730> gel<00:07:13.210> eyeliner
