00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.670
 it seems to me that here as in this 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.309
 I'm fifteen minutes it seems clear 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:12.809
 that the culprit is ancelotti 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:14.219
 attitudes and approaches that if 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.139
 the midfield that earned him the 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.600
 departure to cholo simeone that if you do not 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.189
 he found out that felipe filipe luís always 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.560
 he created superiority in his band 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.359
 here what is transferred is that the 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.890
 great culprit is ancelotti and I refuse to 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.880
 entering into that abandonment says that the 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.880
 madrid does not know what he plays 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:37.710
 there is nothing that plays from starting 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.960
 that you see an attitude of a 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.180
 concentration then I'll start to 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.090
 also raise the part of fault that 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.520
 has the coach but I refuse to 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.329
 there is a series of gentlemen that as happened 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.410
 last year 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.239
 come out and play the guitar 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.800
 and do not leave concentrated and with 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:56.360
 intensity if it's the only thing I ask 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.130
 if afterwards we will blame him for 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.020
 ancelotti but that we are in the same 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.610
 situation that last year with the only 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.770
 difference that last year in this 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.840
 same day we were after playing 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.729
 with the ball to eight points and now 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.890
 we are five then I refuse 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:11.600
 could and I deny that I can deny that 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.820
 I had to go exact knight tribuneros that 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.310
 leave or not as what I want bondholders 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.140
 as a Christian with valdés a la pelota 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.330
 and besides, I do not say it, I did it Christian 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.350
 ronaldo that lacked concentration that 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.050
 lack of intensity 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.700
 the coach said on Thursday after 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.100
 of elche party we were almost not going to 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.780
 win the derby and that's the way it is 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.250
 the derby wins because they came out again 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.020
 with the same mentality and with the same 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.670
 attitude that the day that I already know that you 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.410
 you are going to defend one of the places in gold 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.539
 but today seems perfect me that's why I know 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:40.610
 because it's gas but in those stronger 

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:42.320
 last year's story but it was 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.240
 blame everything on that of mourinho and 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.680
 defend the balls this year you have 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.500
 to continue defending but not because 

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.289
 if not, not that theory, that man 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.940
 comes down 

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:54.410
 do not grow up, it's usually domenico 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:55.759
 because precisely because he has done 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:56.530
 Christian that what you have spoken is 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:00.240
 before time 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.240
 I'll give you part of reason man 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.500
 the coach I have ready what I do not 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:07.420
 I can know and be within the 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.950
 footballers what kind of attitude 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.230
 I understand that first of all it is to deliver 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.550
 as it is due to his own people that the 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.170
 problems you may have that should 

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.910
 hang them in the locker room and when it comes out 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.470
 The playground is to focus on what 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.360
 has in what you have to do what 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:21.459
 yes I think it is true what is now 

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.980
 the players but moment to these 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:26.350
 players I think they either do not understand 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:27.400
 to ancelotti or something happens to them and something 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.230
 happens it can be a loss of 

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.260
 concentration but I also have to 

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.120
 say the same about ancelotti hear yourself 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.980
 You are viewing you have put 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.670
 illarramendi instead of xabi alonso who 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.670
 it's okay 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.060
 instead of taking the ball in that 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.160
 team if you have played in the 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.780
 preseason to something else now you come to 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.120
 change the scheme to return to 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.500
 previous regime and thus keep the 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.910
 players logically does not know what 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.769
 it costs the medium I think we've already 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:55.239
 won something we have already won something the year 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:58.450
 past the only culprit 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:03:00.040
 it was mourinho now I see that already for you 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.989
 they are also good players we have already 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.380
 won something already see steps we are taking you 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:04.510
 disgust 

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.880
 es is not to be mourinho as a coach 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.290
 and already steps are being taken and you say today to 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:09.820
 the best in the analysis must be included 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.980
 also that there is a series of footballers 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:13.450
 that are not performing as you would 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.980
 what to expect from such players 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.270
 professionals and as good as those who 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.160
 they have the good madrid we have already won 

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:20.560
 we have already taken a step and it is not only 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.840
 The coach's fault is not only fault 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:27.580
 of the coach I see that he is focusing 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:29.650
 in de jose mourinho 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.420
 it's not soccer that I like but the 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:32.650
 football that José Mourinho has made 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:36.190
 real madrid something has followed a 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.900
 supercopa a cup and a league and should 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.210
 win another supercopa discussing room at 

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:42.610
 barcelona and that same team that plays 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:43.540
 with an intensity one year suddenly it 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:44.860
 comes down 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.480
 I guess part of the fault of the 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.190
 players but a lot of blame 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:49.990
 I said it last year as 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:58.140
 consequence of the tension to which 

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:58.140
 I had submitted those years I do not say that 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:03.130
 I do not discuss the results of jose 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.630
 mourinho nor argue if you want a game 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:06.250
 I discuss the taste about the game I do not 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:09.210
 I like to play more differently 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.210
 It does not have to be
