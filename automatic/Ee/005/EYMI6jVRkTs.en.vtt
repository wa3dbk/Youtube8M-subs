00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:07.710
 today and nice that again 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.570
 I have something today 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:11.690
 sweet prepared for you too 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.250
 Unfortunately, it looks totally delicious 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.289
 Inedible that is not now 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:21.619
 at my totally bad cooking skills 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:25.050
 because I have made small bathing banks 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:27.800
 So they really are the ones to see 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.630
 just super delicious but as I said 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.300
 this not suitable for eating but 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.520
 for the bath and i want for that 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:39.350
 like to give a few and like me 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.350
 I've ever done that to you now 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:47.149
 for the cupcake bath bombs you need 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.820
 A lot of soda citric acid 

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:53.329
 milk powder melted panin 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:56.570
 food starch some cocoa and another 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:58.920
 food coloring and essential oil 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.750
 all quantities I link to you 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.710
 even in the infobox so necessarily 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.930
 drop by 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:06.420
 and then you need it later 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:10.909
 a sachet a little star 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.909
 and some paper boxes for chocolates 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.789
 give her cupcake floors 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.039
 First of all, the cocoa powder in the 

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:21.380
 melted palm trees and do it that way 

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:21.380
 long until it is completely lump free 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.910
 then you need a clean one 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.770
 bowl in which the natron the 

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:30.840
 citric acid and the milk powder 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.580
 come and can you then 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.590
 roughly mix with a spoon 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:40.979
 before then two to three drops that 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:43.260
 essential oil come to that 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.970
 now the fireplace is coming too 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.100
 already roughly stirred with a spoon 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.670
 before everything can be done with the 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.710
 hands must be kneaded really well 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.390
 the consistency is perfect if you are 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.520
 make a small lump in yours 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.930
 Hand molding could stick together 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.450
 stay and not immediately apart 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.130
 falls 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.020
 Now you can have the pralines 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.780
 Prepare the best in you 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.789
 with two spoons something of the mass 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:13.280
 filled in and then firmly fixed 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:15.560
 suppressed when you are all filled ramekins 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.510
 should have the mass for at least 15 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.390
 minutes to dry and in this time 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.310
 we prepare the frosting for it 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.230
 you need melted appointment again 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.840
 in that I am already pinker color 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:31.580
 mixed but s are equally suitable 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:33.410
 gel or paste colors in the palm of him 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:35.780
 now comes a little bit of yours 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.579
 essential oil and then leave 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.650
 Cool the whole thing until you can see 

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:45.040
 that on the edge again a little firmer 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:47.870
 will be able to get some soda again 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:50.360
 citric acid milk powder and now on 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.010
 the food strength and everything has to go with it 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:54.530
 the mixa for about five minutes 

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.239
 be stirred creamy before the frosting 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.140
 then for ten minutes in the fridge 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:59.140
 put 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.300
 after school time each mixed everything 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:06.250
 again through and then could also 

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:08.500
 already fill your pouch with it 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.610
 and you 'll notice how creamy this one is 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.610
 has become mass 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.930
 so you can now great little 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.300
 piled on your cupcakes 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:25.030
 you from the outside up in the middle 

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.470
 pull that also requires something quiet 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:29.140
 more pressure than a normal one 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:30.280
 frosting and if you have done that 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.470
 can you also like something else? 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.360
 glitter on your cupcakes balk 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.730
 I think that looks very nice 

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.800
 and then the cupcakes only have to 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:41.080
 Dry for another day before drying 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:43.709
 they either used themselves or just 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.709
 given away 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.970
 and they really look so cute 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:56.540
 that I certainly everyone about it 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:58.390
 happy if you give it away 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.409
 I wish you much fun while copying 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.299
 Try it if you like the video 

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:04.220
 I would have liked myself 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:06.140
 a thumbs up or over an abo 

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:08.620
 look forward and see you next time 

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:08.620
 again 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:35.300
 what exactly is it in my mind 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.300
 skills area is included
