00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
way around at 1/4 inch and I realize

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.060 
way around at 1/4 inch and I realize
that<00:01:41.729> this<00:01:42.210> is<00:01:42.390> out<00:01:42.570> of<00:01:42.990> camera<00:01:43.470> range<00:01:43.619> so<00:01:44.009> I'm

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
that this is out of camera range so I'm

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.389 
that this is out of camera range so I'm
trying<00:01:44.399> to<00:01:44.430> move<00:01:44.579> this<00:01:44.700> in<00:01:46.070> see<00:01:47.070> if<00:01:47.189> you<00:01:47.280> can

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
trying to move this in see if you can

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.569 
trying to move this in see if you can
see<00:01:47.610> that<00:01:48.079> so<00:01:49.079> go<00:01:49.290> around<00:01:49.409> and<00:01:49.770> score<00:01:50.159> that<00:01:50.399> at

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:41.490 
to cut a notch right out here for the

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:45.380 
to cut a notch right out here for the
paper<00:02:41.670> clip<00:02:42.030> to<00:02:42.209> fit<00:02:42.450> right<00:02:43.350> and<00:02:44.120> I've<00:02:45.120> done

paper clip to fit right and I've done

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.540 
paper clip to fit right and I've done
this<00:02:45.540> enough<00:02:45.810> that<00:02:46.020> I<00:02:46.320> I<00:02:46.560> just<00:02:46.680> like<00:02:47.220> to<00:02:47.340> put<00:02:47.520> a

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
this enough that I I just like to put a

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:48.740 
this enough that I I just like to put a
little<00:02:47.760> snip<00:02:48.060> right<00:02:48.209> in<00:02:48.330> the<00:02:48.390> middle<00:02:48.540> so<00:02:48.630> I

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
little snip right in the middle so I

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:49.699 
little snip right in the middle so I
know<00:02:48.930> where<00:02:49.110> I'm<00:02:49.170> headed

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
know where I'm headed

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.130 
know where I'm headed
and<00:02:49.800> then<00:02:50.520> I<00:02:50.550> cut<00:02:50.850> around<00:02:51.030> that<00:02:51.540> to<00:02:51.780> make<00:02:51.810> room

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
and then I cut around that to make room

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.750 
and then I cut around that to make room
for<00:02:52.170> the<00:02:52.380> paper<00:02:52.560> clip<00:02:52.830> this<00:02:52.980> does<00:02:53.190> not<00:02:53.370> have<00:02:53.640> to

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
for the paper clip this does not have to

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:55.610 
for the paper clip this does not have to
be<00:02:53.850> pretty<00:02:54.060> because<00:02:54.420> it's<00:02:54.959> not<00:02:55.170> going<00:02:55.440> to<00:02:55.500> be

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
be pretty because it's not going to be

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.220 
be pretty because it's not going to be
seen<00:02:55.890> I<00:02:56.220> put<00:02:57.090> it<00:02:57.180> down<00:02:57.330> here<00:02:57.390> and<00:02:57.690> see<00:02:57.930> if<00:02:58.080> that

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
seen I put it down here and see if that

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:59.770 
seen I put it down here and see if that
will<00:02:58.320> fit<00:02:58.560> yes<00:02:58.860> it<00:02:59.040> will

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
will fit yes it will

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.530 
will fit yes it will
so<00:03:00.780> you<00:03:01.260> also<00:03:01.470> need<00:03:01.830> some<00:03:02.130> paper<00:03:02.370> glue<00:03:02.640> this<00:03:03.330> is

so you also need some paper glue this is

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.690 
so you also need some paper glue this is
scotch<00:03:03.959> quick<00:03:04.260> dry<00:03:04.470> adhesive<00:03:04.530> and<00:03:05.070> then<00:03:05.370> also

where the bondage lips come in handy
it's<00:05:31.719> very<00:05:31.960> difficult<00:05:32.379> to<00:05:32.560> get<00:05:32.680> all<00:05:32.740> these

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:33.039 
it's very difficult to get all these

it's very difficult to get all these
edges<00:05:33.490> to<00:05:33.610> stay<00:05:33.849> down<00:05:34.710> so<00:05:35.710> if<00:05:35.860> you<00:05:36.069> will<00:05:36.219> use

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:36.370 
edges to stay down so if you will use

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:37.969 
edges to stay down so if you will use
the<00:05:36.520> binder<00:05:36.879> clip

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:37.979 
the binder clip

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:43.320 
the binder clip
sure<00:05:38.979> it's<00:05:39.099> aligned<00:05:41.340> do<00:05:42.340> the<00:05:42.490> left<00:05:42.729> and<00:05:42.969> right
