00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:22.510
 at this moment please 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.400
 subscribe to my recipe channel 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:26.140
 healthy on youtube because three times 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.360
 a week I have very tasty recipes 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.710
 well nourishing and especially special 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.510
 for people with cholesterol with 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.399
 diabetes by dieting or just 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:35.530
 if you want to eat healthy and what do you 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:37.600
 it seems if we put to work 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.360
 let's decorate our cupcakes with 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.980
 a mash of cauliflower above you can 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.690
 do also with mashed potatoes if you do 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.300
 this recipe for children but remember if 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.129
 are you looking to lose weight the potato not 

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.960
 will help you contain a lot of starch and 

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:52.329
 it's a carbohydrate so we're going to 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:54.790
 substitute why you think cauliflower 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:56.979
 remember that cauliflower has a lot 

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.690
 Vitamin C helps prevent cancer and 

00:00:56.979 --> 00:01:00.460
 also the formation of clots so 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.799
 it is very important to be consuming 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.530
 and all I'm doing is removing 

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:08.020
 twigs and already had rinsed and 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.220
 we are going to put to steam cooking during 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.230
 about 10 minutes 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.970
 I have here a piece of red pepper 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.350
 you can use the pepper that 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.270
 you find they are usually quite 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.940
 expensive so grab the one that is 

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.850
 cheaper and we're going to cut it in 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.290
 I'm going to cut large pieces 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.340
 right now I'm going to integrate all the 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.560
 vegetables 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.850
 now let's use a little celery 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.740
 as well 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:36.510
 let's put the whole twig because the 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.510
 helps a wonderful flavor to the meat 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.250
 also onions of tail or onion 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.380
 of cambrai I will remove the first 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.420
 bits that are half ugly and we're going to 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.590
 cut the tail to integrate it with 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.590
 all the other ingredients 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:54.930
 I'm going to separate half of this for 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:56.909
 use it to decorate the part of 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.670
 up our cupcakes that now 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.770
 I'm going to put a little salt so that 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.960
 help us to integrate the juices and 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.960
 let's thinly cut all this 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.750
 here are my vegetables now very well 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.120
 chopped and now what I'm going to do is 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.500
 integrate them into the meat and let me them 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.660
 I tell you that this recipe lent it to me 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.460

 victory welcome to the recipes of the 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:35.120
 wta 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.850
 cooking 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.980
 life 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.750
 thank you victory and remember that the 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.190
 Victory recipes are in English but 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.930
 I show all the ingredients so 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:09.000
 You can probably understand him 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.910
 well let's continue with this I'm going to 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.060
 add 5 tablespoons of onion I have 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:17.010
 over here to apply 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.739
 we are also adding a bit of 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.840
 pepper let's add a pinch of 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:24.530
 oregano and I have here 2 cloves of garlic 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:28.040
 very very well minced 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:31.630
 let's add salt to taste and now if 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.630
 we mix everything again well 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.630
 around here I have my molds to cage no 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:44.190
 worry, look, I bought the meat that 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:45.930
 comes low in fat which is 97 3% that 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:48.780
 it means that 97 is flesh and only the 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:50.850
 3% fat also exists the 93 7 also 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.110
 it's quite acceptable so do not 

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:53.940
 worry anyway this is going to 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:55.620
 drop some fat and that is going to 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.990
 help so that it does not stick then not 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:02.140
 you have to put nothing to the mold and now 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:05.730
 let's put our cupcakes here 

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.730
 of meat just like that 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:18.120
 I have a chipotle chili here and I have 

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:21.000
 chub sauce is going to put it here on me 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:24.169
 table and I will chop it well finally 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.169
 so that the flavors are integrated 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:36.680
 with this mixture of each subtype we're going 

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:40.430
 to bathe a little bit above our 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:42.500
 cocktails ready to go to the oven 350 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:45.350
 fahrenheit 180 centigrade for 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:47.060
 around 40 minutes 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:48.620
 here they are remember that our 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.180
 vegetable is very very important that 

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.100
 when we take them out of steam 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:54.020
 rinse them with cold water if not 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:56.090
 they keep the heat inside and they follow 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:58.070
 over cooking and you're going to be all 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:00.230
 water and cough and the more they cook 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:02.240
 two vegetables more nutrients lose like this 

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:05.080
 that you have to be careful with that I'm going to 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.080
 rinse them in cold water 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:10.170
 we drain well and we are ready to 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:10.170
 make our cauliflower puree 

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:14.020
 I'm going to use the processor 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:16.030
 food if you do not have what you can 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.770
 make in the blender or you can 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:20.260
 go crushing with the crusher of the 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:23.410
 beans I'm also going to add a pinch 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:27.569
 of salt a pinch of pepper and now 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:30.449
 yes we are going to grind this very very well 

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:31.860
 and how they look like they smell delicious 

00:05:30.449 --> 00:05:33.539
 and here they go a tip miren began to 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.189
 drop a lot of fluid so what I did 

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:37.050
 was to put a tray in the part 

00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:39.749
 lower so that the liquid falls there and 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:41.639

00:05:39.749 --> 00:05:43.409

 and they fascinate me are ideal for 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:54.119
 a piñata when you get the party 

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:56.069
 of children because you already know that always 

00:05:54.119 --> 00:05:58.439
 they leave everything that does not leave them 

00:05:56.069 --> 00:06:00.569
 so it's an exact portion and well 

00:05:58.439 --> 00:06:04.110
 Look, here I am cutting a little 

00:06:00.569 --> 00:06:06.119

 to put as confetti up 

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:20.540
 if you have one of those manga to decorate 

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:22.370
 use it and I have this 

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:24.500
 artifact a little more sophisticated than 

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:26.030
 it is the same or if not 

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:28.190
 you can do them in the form of 

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:30.740
 little ball with one of those with which you put 

00:06:28.190 --> 00:06:33.440

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:37.270

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:41.470
 and ready to decorate 

00:06:42.790 --> 00:06:46.690

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:56.340
 and we add some bits of 

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:56.340
 chives 

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:02.520
