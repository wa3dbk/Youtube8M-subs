twists but i thought i would show you
guys<00:00:57.360> I<00:00:59.359> guess<00:01:00.359> my<00:01:00.539> version<00:01:01.440> of<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.890> three

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
guys I guess my version of the three

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.319 
guys I guess my version of the three
strand<00:01:02.399> twist<00:01:02.640> I<00:01:02.789> mean<00:01:02.910> it's<00:01:03.000> not<00:01:03.059> really<00:01:03.210> a

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
strand twist I mean it's not really a

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:07.340 
strand twist I mean it's not really a
version<00:01:03.840> but<00:01:05.000> the<00:01:06.000> it's<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.720> whole<00:01:06.990> hand

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
version but the it's the whole hand

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.620 
version but the it's the whole hand
positions<00:01:08.040> it<00:01:08.220> wasn't<00:01:08.549> until<00:01:08.790> I<00:01:08.850> saw<00:01:09.180> Chelsea

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
positions it wasn't until I saw Chelsea

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.880 
positions it wasn't until I saw Chelsea
Couture<00:01:10.220> do<00:01:11.220> her<00:01:12.260> tutorial<00:01:13.260> on<00:01:13.439> it<00:01:13.590> is<00:01:13.710> when<00:01:13.860> I

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
Couture do her tutorial on it is when I

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.609 
Couture do her tutorial on it is when I
got<00:01:14.220> it<00:01:14.400> and<00:01:14.520> I<00:01:14.640> actually<00:01:14.820> posted<00:01:15.780> a<00:01:15.840> vid<00:01:16.080> on<00:01:16.380> it

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
got it and I actually posted a vid on it

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.340 
got it and I actually posted a vid on it
but<00:01:16.830> I<00:01:16.979> figured<00:01:17.400> um<00:01:17.759> I<00:01:18.119> like<00:01:18.720> to<00:01:18.840> share<00:01:19.080> again

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
but I figured um I like to share again

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.700 
but I figured um I like to share again
so<00:01:19.560> I<00:01:19.619> think<00:01:19.740> I'll<00:01:20.070> just<00:01:20.420> choose<00:01:21.420> a<00:01:21.509> twist<00:01:22.380> that

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
so I think I'll just choose a twist that

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.240 
so I think I'll just choose a twist that
I've<00:01:22.920> already<00:01:23.159> done<00:01:23.790> and<00:01:24.710> you<00:01:25.710> show<00:01:25.950> you<00:01:26.009> guys
