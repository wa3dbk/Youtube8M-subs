it was rough man there was no trail we

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:49.580 
it was rough man there was no trail we
were<00:01:47.350> straight<00:01:47.770> up<00:01:47.800> bushwhacking<00:01:48.550> not<00:01:49.000> only

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
were straight up bushwhacking not only

steep<00:01:50.590> but<00:01:51.520> really<00:01:51.910> loose<00:01:52.179> I<00:01:52.479> was<00:01:52.720> just

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:52.899 
steep but really loose I was just

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:55.380 
steep but really loose I was just
thinking<00:01:53.200> the<00:01:53.289> whole<00:01:53.380> time<00:01:53.440> this<00:01:53.860> is<00:01:54.270> one<00:01:55.270> of

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.390 
thinking the whole time this is one of

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.050 
thinking the whole time this is one of
the<00:01:55.450> dumbest<00:01:55.869> things<00:01:56.110> I've<00:01:56.320> ever<00:01:56.350> done<00:01:56.590> and<00:01:57.550> so

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
the dumbest things I've ever done and so

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.899 
the dumbest things I've ever done and so
we<00:01:58.210> started<00:01:58.659> exploring<00:01:59.140> around<00:01:59.440> in<00:02:00.250> this<00:02:00.520> area

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:00.909 
we started exploring around in this area

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:05.040 
we started exploring around in this area
and<00:02:01.149> we<00:02:01.360> did<00:02:01.690> find<00:02:02.729> evidence<00:02:03.729> of<00:02:04.050> unauthorized

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.050 
and we did find evidence of unauthorized

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.560 
and we did find evidence of unauthorized
trail<00:02:05.710> construction<00:02:06.280> and<00:02:06.820> that<00:02:07.060> was<00:02:07.210> a<00:02:07.240> huge

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
trail construction and that was a huge

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.780 
trail construction and that was a huge
concern<00:02:07.810> in<00:02:08.530> the<00:02:08.709> beginning<00:02:09.040> it<00:02:09.310> was<00:02:09.429> kind<00:02:09.700> of

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:09.790 
concern in the beginning it was kind of

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:11.789 
concern in the beginning it was kind of
this<00:02:09.880> weird<00:02:10.090> feeling<00:02:10.360> of<00:02:10.660> have<00:02:11.320> to<00:02:11.470> look<00:02:11.620> over
