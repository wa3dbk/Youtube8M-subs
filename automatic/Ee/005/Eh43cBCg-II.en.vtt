00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.059
 m 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.339
 the most om 

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:18.339
 you have to go to the rhythm an idea 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.830
 such he has my queen of his season could be heard by the flames 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.999
 in the quest in collaboration between sega was stationed at the headscarf 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:31.179
 of the game is to create a virtual suite malian son that 

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:32.230
 the second film 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:34.160
 the alien film saga 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.290
 so we will find some of the sets of the film 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.870
 good course will go to paris plebe sport yet enough money to live 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.320
 an adventure 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.270
 but we will play with a squad so 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:45.810
 Space Marines 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.510
 the philo obviously falls face-to-face with the xenomorphs because otherwise 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.160
 it's not funny 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.430
 all we could discover% 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.330
 real certain decorations 

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:57.200
 film in Vienna is held until Friday 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.520
 it's a pretty nervous fight 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.520
 it's also a game 

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:06.460
 button is always accompanied by our colleagues mail even if they are enough 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:07.460
 quick 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.930
 it's also a game that we can play in cooperative 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.640
 it is also a game that is really not beautiful but cold 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.040
 auchan 5 that it is due to the fact 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.040
 while the game was a delayed several times that's it's ugly 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.920
 another who jumped to the German dry eyes xenomorphic animations 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.990
 was really disappointing in this version 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.990
 demonstration of gesca that will be improved by the exit 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
 otherwise the game was the ssii 

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.920
 finally not too surprising but it's still adapted from censorship 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:37.990
 moving averages 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.110
 inevitably false sinuous cinematic joy 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.500
 with the appearance and especially 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.800
 the spitter and chasing the hero 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.330
 in a sort of small hallway by demolishing everything 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:51.790
 the arrival of the queen at the end finally brief 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.160
 all the little winks eur 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.890
 to the franchise elsewhere 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.500
 side you do not understand you 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.600
 for now it's a game that looks 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.410
 rather nice but 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:05.050
 who do not break three legs to a duck and who especially he would really 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:06.210
 very different 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.210
 of its technical part 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:12.450
