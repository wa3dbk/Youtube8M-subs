00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.050 
standard age Japanese RPGs and the

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.050 
standard age Japanese RPGs and the

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.060 
original one while it was all mostly

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.200 
original one while it was all mostly
dialogue<00:03:11.720> there<00:03:12.380> was<00:03:12.530> the<00:03:12.710> voices<00:03:13.310> in<00:03:13.520> battle

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:14.210

style<00:03:29.239> cutscenes<00:03:29.870> that<00:03:29.989> really<00:03:30.739> gave<00:03:30.890> the

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
style cutscenes that really gave the

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:33.640 
style cutscenes that really gave the
game<00:03:31.280> a<00:03:31.640> little<00:03:32.090> bit<00:03:32.209> more<00:03:32.540> personality<00:03:33.140> and

game a little bit more personality and

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.920 
game a little bit more personality and
adds<00:03:33.980> a<00:03:34.250> lot<00:03:34.520> more<00:03:34.790> to<00:03:35.000> its<00:03:35.150> presentation

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
adds a lot more to its presentation

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:37.780
