00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
because he was just shoehorned into this

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.100 
because he was just shoehorned into this
episode<00:03:34.860> and<00:03:35.550> froing<00:03:36.180> on<00:03:36.390> top<00:03:36.630> of<00:03:36.810> us<00:03:36.930> the

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
episode and froing on top of us the

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:38.900 
episode and froing on top of us the
development<00:03:37.830> of<00:03:37.920> this<00:03:38.040> episode<00:03:38.459> should<00:03:38.700> have

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:38.910 
development of this episode should have

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.060 
development of this episode should have
focus<00:03:39.390> on<00:03:39.600> two<00:03:39.810> to<00:03:39.959> three<00:03:40.140> episodes<00:03:40.590> it<00:03:40.709> really

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:41.070 
focus on two to three episodes it really

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:42.830 
focus on two to three episodes it really
should<00:03:41.280> have<00:03:41.489> because<00:03:41.850> it<00:03:42.150> felt<00:03:42.390> way<00:03:42.810> too

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
should have because it felt way too

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.199 
should have because it felt way too
quick<00:03:43.680> paced<00:03:43.980> with<00:03:44.190> this<00:03:44.310> episode<00:03:44.610> like<00:03:44.730> way

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
quick paced with this episode like way

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.150 
quick paced with this episode like way
too<00:03:45.269> much<00:03:45.690> stuff<00:03:45.870> in<00:03:46.230> one<00:03:46.440> episode<00:03:46.920> because

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:47.160 
too much stuff in one episode because

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.190 
too much stuff in one episode because
usually<00:03:47.310> Goro<00:03:47.730> has<00:03:48.000> this<00:03:48.300> you<00:03:48.750> know<00:03:48.810> slow

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
usually Goro has this you know slow

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.160 
usually Goro has this you know slow
pacing<00:03:49.709> gradual<00:03:50.519> build-up<00:03:51.060> but<00:03:51.540> this<00:03:51.780> episode

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
pacing gradual build-up but this episode

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.590 
pacing gradual build-up but this episode
felt<00:03:52.440> like<00:03:52.560> it<00:03:52.739> hit<00:03:52.950> the<00:03:52.980> gas<00:03:53.280> is<00:03:53.580> I<00:03:53.670> need<00:03:53.850> you

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:54.600 
felt like it hit the gas is I need you

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:56.570 
felt like it hit the gas is I need you
know<00:03:54.690> just<00:03:54.930> going<00:03:55.050> straight<00:03:55.230> full<00:03:55.560> force<00:03:55.860> so

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580 
know just going straight full force so

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.550 
know just going straight full force so
hopefully<00:03:57.209> I'm<00:03:57.300> not<00:03:57.360> the<00:03:57.600> only<00:03:57.780> one<00:03:58.110> to<00:03:58.320> feel

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
hopefully I'm not the only one to feel

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.009 
hopefully I'm not the only one to feel
that<00:03:58.890> episode<00:03:59.850> regardless<00:04:00.480> of<00:04:00.600> that<00:04:00.630> it<00:04:00.900> was

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019 
that episode regardless of that it was

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:03.800 
that episode regardless of that it was
