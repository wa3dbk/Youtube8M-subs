00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:05.600 
going to check out PC one and find out

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.270 
going to check out PC one and find out
what<00:00:06.600> kind<00:00:06.810> of<00:00:06.839> design<00:00:07.200> mix<00:00:07.470> we<00:00:07.649> had<00:00:07.830> on<00:00:08.010> PC

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:10.280 
what kind of design mix we had on PC

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.970 
what kind of design mix we had on PC
1.27<00:00:11.280> is<00:00:11.340> just<00:00:11.670> go<00:00:11.849> basil<00:00:12.090> yam<00:00:12.990> so<00:00:13.320> that's<00:00:13.860> a

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:15.980 
1.27 is just go basil yam so that's a

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.040 
1.27 is just go basil yam so that's a
1021<00:00:16.980> that<00:00:17.160> would<00:00:17.310> make<00:00:17.490> that<00:00:17.670> bet<00:00:18.029> that<00:00:18.330> that

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
1021 that would make that bet that that

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.859 
1021 that would make that bet that that
cylinder<00:00:19.680> fought<00:00:20.520> for<00:00:20.939> five<00:00:21.119> days<00:00:21.359> old

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
cylinder fought for five days old

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.560 
cylinder fought for five days old
yeah<00:00:22.050> it's<00:00:22.260> a<00:00:22.320> 3000<00:00:23.070> psi<00:00:23.189> 3000<00:00:24.180> so<00:00:24.300> what<00:00:24.420> do<00:00:24.510> you

yeah it's a 3000 psi 3000 so what do you

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.599 
yeah it's a 3000 psi 3000 so what do you
think<00:00:24.720> are<00:00:24.840> shrinking<00:00:25.619> it<00:00:25.800> five<00:00:26.189> days<00:00:26.460> on

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
think are shrinking it five days on

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.970 
think are shrinking it five days on
3,000<00:00:27.210> we<00:00:27.269> about<00:00:27.480> 8000<00:00:28.260> but<00:00:28.410> do<00:00:28.619> you<00:00:28.710> beat<00:00:28.890> you

strength<00:00:41.489> now<00:00:42.270> what<00:00:42.390> we're<00:00:42.510> doing<00:00:42.540> is<00:00:42.809> we're

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
strength now what we're doing is we're

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.490 
strength now what we're doing is we're
we're<00:00:43.680> loading<00:00:43.890> up<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:45.050> concrete<00:00:46.050> core

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
we're loading up the concrete core

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.650 
we're loading up the concrete core
sampling<00:00:46.950> here<00:00:47.219> going<00:00:48.120> right<00:00:48.390> into<00:00:48.539> the

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
sampling here going right into the

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.350 
sampling here going right into the
machine<00:00:49.340> and<00:00:50.340> then<00:00:50.460> step<00:00:50.670> that<00:00:50.700> right<00:00:51.030> up<00:00:51.180> in

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
machine and then step that right up in

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.229 
machine and then step that right up in
there

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:55.239 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:56.690 

which

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:56.700 
which

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:03.729 
which
got<00:00:57.059> to<00:00:57.149> get<00:00:57.210> it<00:00:57.329> lined<00:00:57.540> up<00:00:57.720> perfectly

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:03.739 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:09.080 

right<00:01:04.330> about<00:01:05.330> this<00:01:05.479> table<00:01:05.720> here<00:01:06.110> right

all right when I want to try to do is
keep<00:01:11.670> it<00:01:11.820> about<00:01:12.030> two

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.400 
keep it about two

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:22.460 
keep it about two
per<00:01:13.940> second<00:01:14.480> right<00:01:15.020> each<00:01:15.230> one<00:01:15.500> is<00:01:15.740> 500<00:01:15.980> pounds

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.250 

where<00:01:23.010> we<00:01:23.160> at<00:01:23.340> right<00:01:23.370> now<00:01:23.760> we're<00:01:24.300> coming<00:01:24.570> up<00:01:24.990> on

right now

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.850 
right now
three<00:02:36.450> we're<00:02:36.720> starting<00:02:37.230> to<00:02:37.290> get<00:02:37.380> Billy<00:02:37.650> or

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
three we're starting to get Billy or

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.880 
three we're starting to get Billy or
3,000<00:02:38.520> psi<00:02:38.700> and<00:02:39.480> this<00:02:39.930> is<00:02:40.110> a<00:02:40.260> this<00:02:40.530> was<00:02:40.770> the

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
3,000 psi and this is a this was the

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.390 
3,000 psi and this is a this was the
3000<00:02:41.520> psi<00:02:41.640> but<00:02:42.150> at<00:02:42.300> five<00:02:42.510> days<00:02:43.400> our

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
3000 psi but at five days our

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.600 
3000 psi but at five days our
technicians<00:02:45.090> guess<00:02:45.360> we<00:02:45.570> had<00:02:45.960> a

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
technicians guess we had a
