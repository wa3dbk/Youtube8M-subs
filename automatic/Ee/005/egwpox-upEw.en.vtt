00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:10.160
 in this chapter we will give you some 

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:13.369
 suggestions that will help you thread 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.869
 your machine properly following the 

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:18.600
 instructions that are in your manual 

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:21.450
 You will see that it is very easy to thread the 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.550
 the coil of the machine is sliced ​​before 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:26.340
 to prepare the machine 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:29.429
 this process varies depending on the 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.410
 sewing machine model check the 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.810
 instructive of your machine to know 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:36.940
 what is the right process for her 

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:39.790
 however the following rules 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:42.010
 apply for all models when 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:43.960
 place the thread on the machine use the 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:46.180
 cover of the spool holder suitable for 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:49.000
 size of the thread spool that is 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:51.550
 using if your spool of thread has a 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.010
 slit on the shore make sure that the 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.320
 Reel tip is on the right for 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.740
 that the thread does not get stuck while you're 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:58.740
 lifting up 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:07.090
 use only the coils recommended by your 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:09.700
 manufacturer does not replace them with styles 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:12.100
 different or your machine will not know 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:15.020
 correctly 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.540
 make sure that the winder shaft is 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:20.180
 completely to the left before 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.890
 of placing the coil be sure to 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:25.190
 place the coil in the machine 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:27.860
 correctly according to your manual if 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:30.520
 misplaces the coil the machine does not sew 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:33.460
 adequately 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:36.390
 We recommend you to download the thread only in 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.390
 empty coils 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.090
 although the machines vary from one model 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.420
 to another there are certain aspects that are 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.770
 common in the threading of the machine 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.659
 follow the manual of your machine for the 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.860
 rest of the process of threading your 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:57.069

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:07.490
 first of all be sure to upload the 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:09.800
 press lever fabrics before 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.530
 start threading this is very 

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:15.680
 important because if you do not do the thread 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.630
 you will not have the proper attention step 1 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.670
 to thread your machine will always be 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:23.220
 lift the press fabrics 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:26.190
 turn the steering wheel to raise the needle to 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:28.440
 your highest position when you place the 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:30.510
 Thread spool on the machine use the 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:32.670
 reel bra with measurements 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.400
 suitable for the spool of thread that 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.530
 is using if the spool of thread has 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.500
 a slit at the tip make sure 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.330
 the tip is on the right so it does not 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.420
 clog at sewing

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.860
 if you are using a spool of thread in 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.930
 Cone shape is recommended to place the 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.569
 thread in the vertical spool holder 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.240
 located behind the machine to 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:03:00.930
 improve results 

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:03.420
 90% of the work you will do will be 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:08.150
 with attention in auto mode or in 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.150

 [Music] 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:14.530
 the result of the position is 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.110
 generally the combination of 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.860
 operation and attention of both 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.590
 origins of 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:24.050
 for straight posture the attention is 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:26.250
 adequate when the points are secured 

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:29.100
 to the center correctly 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:31.740
 If the seam seems irregular, it will be 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.810
 that adjust the attention just do it 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:35.940
 when you are sure that it was placed 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:37.220
 correctly the thread in the machine 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:39.290
 sew 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.780
 if the bobbin thread is being viewed 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:44.450
 in the upper seam or the fabric is 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:47.480
 being bent you will have to lower the level 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:49.820
 of tension if the thread is being seen in 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:53.320
 the bottom of the fabric will have to 

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:53.320
 raise the level of tension 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:59.650
 these tension adjustments will have to 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.160
 always be done with the press fabrics 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.160

 Thread builds up on the bottom of 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:18.889
 the fabric will mean that the machine 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:21.530
 sewing has not been threaded in the way 

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:23.870

 for zig zag or decorative stitches 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:36.860
 the attention must be less than in 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:38.840
 Straight stitching will achieve a better result 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.300
 if the lower thread appears in the 

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.870
 ends of the points for this type of 

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.870
 seams 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:48.960
 the coil attention was adjusted 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:52.370
 from the factory so it does not require 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.370
 that is adjusted by you 

00:04:52.529 --> 00:04:58.169
 when threading the machine lift the needle 

00:04:55.559 --> 00:05:00.299
 to its highest position by turning the 

00:04:58.169 --> 00:05:03.539
 steering wheel in the opposite direction to 

00:05:00.299 --> 00:05:06.689
 clock hands place the needle in 

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:09.029
 the central position in sarthe always the 

00:05:06.689 --> 00:05:12.449
 needle from front to back and pull the 

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:14.879
 Thread back approximately 15 to 18 

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:17.519
 centimeters this will ensure that the 

00:05:14.879 --> 00:05:19.799
 machine does not disarm when it starts to 

00:05:17.519 --> 00:05:23.729
 sew because the thread has been 

00:05:19.799 --> 00:05:25.919
 very short some machines have 

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:27.769
 The function of the automatic splicer 

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:31.619
 to help insert the needle 

00:05:27.769 --> 00:05:34.319
 quickly and effortlessly to use the 

00:05:31.619 --> 00:05:36.479
 automatic skewer press the 

00:05:34.319 --> 00:05:38.729
 skewer lever bringing the 

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:41.099
 skew mechanism to the position in 

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:42.750
 that the hook will go directly into the 

00:05:41.099 --> 00:05:46.740
 needle hole 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:50.000
 the thread goes around the thread and then 

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:50.000
 down the hook 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:57.400
 in some models this process is still 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:59.560
 faster because they have this 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:02.410
 skew system that will do it by 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:06.680
 you check the manual of your machine 

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:09.770
 for more information about your model 

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:12.199
 the ensartador is automatic work 

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:15.530
 better with needles of number 14 or more 

00:06:12.199 --> 00:06:18.620
 large for needles number 11 or more 

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:20.990
 small as well as twin needle or 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:24.610
 Hem needles recommended 

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:24.610
 thread the thread manually 

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:31.639
 taking out the thread from the coil 

00:06:28.340 --> 00:06:34.760
 before you start sewing you need to take out 

00:06:31.639 --> 00:06:37.130
 the thread of the coil to achieve it with 

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:40.669
 your left hand stop the end of the 

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:42.650
 and I threw the steering wheel towards you or in 

00:06:40.669 --> 00:06:45.770
 contrary to the hands of the 

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:47.060
 movement clock that will lower and raise the 

00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:49.820
 needle 

00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:53.180
 when turning the steering wheel pull 

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:55.490
 Gently thread the needle the thread 

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:58.970
 of the coil will come out through the 

00:06:55.490 --> 00:07:00.740
 Needle plate hole slide the 

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:03.740
 threads through the press slots 

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:06.470
 fabrics later with what both threads 

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:09.740
 down the press fabrics and pull them towards 

00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:12.650
 back some machines have a 

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:15.380
 system where the bobbin thread is 

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:18.200
 pulls automatically when you start sewing 

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:20.870
 If your machine has this system of 

00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:23.510
 Threading of coil means that no 

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:26.930
 it will be necessary to extract the thread from the 

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:29.110
 coil before you start sewing the 

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:32.110
 machine make the thread by you 

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:32.110
 automatically
