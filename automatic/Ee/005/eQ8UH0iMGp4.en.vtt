00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:04.250
 Y 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.460
 here 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:18.970
 Y 

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:22.780
 Y 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.190
 Y 

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:31.980
 hello very good we are going to give us a 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:35.450
 back in this incredible and great god and 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.450
 maximum ssangyong rodius 

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.340
 to 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.780
 Y 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.970
 we started 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:03.730
 ready outside art 5 meters and 13 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:06.370
 centimeters then of an authentic seven 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.590
 squares and with storage capacity 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:11.350
 that baggage of those seven people to 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:14.800
 these seven places we are talking about 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:17.230
 ssangyong rodius that fortunately 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.150
 because it has been updated because the 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:19.690
 previous is not that it was ugly is that it was 

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:22.300
 very ugly 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:23.680
 let's say it openly but the 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.680
 truth is that it was the most practical and for 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.600
 that sold a lot has happened to you then 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.369
 It's good that June showed up 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.640
 the press new years rodeos this that 

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:35.229
 you see and we had a desire to do the 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.660
 test as god sends then for 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:40.710
 convey to you yes it had really improved 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:43.229
 and if it really was still 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:46.619
 of reference places and effectively 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:50.490
 this minivan of ssangyong is that 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:52.590
 come on is any parent's dream of 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.240
 large family or if this is an eye 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.810
 backwards 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.579
 you see that there are seven authentic squares 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.649
 be in a configuration of two more 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:04.020
 two plus three I can assure you that 

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:05.670
 almost two meters people can fit back 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.030
 perfectly in terms of height and in 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.649
 how about legs the seats of the two 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.110
 of the second row is that they are 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.690
 super modulable reclined the set was what 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.989
 same the back one is more I suggest you 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:21.120
 please see in the graphic report 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:22.410
 what we have done and accompanies you to this 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.110
 try why 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.850
 it looks like we were humans 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.920
 he said before making love in a simca 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:31.630
 1000 good the truth is that 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.520
 It would be the easiest thing in the world because 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.900
 we have knocked down the two ends of the 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.000
 seat to which you can take a 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.180
 siesta comes accompanied without any 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.910
 problem but let's go what we 're going single 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:46.450
 155 horsepower diesel engine 2 liters 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:48.520
 with a torque of 360 newton-meter the 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.930
 truth is that it recovers phenomenal 

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:52.540
 associated with this manual change of six 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.160
 speeds makes sense in terms of 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.739
 engine even though we're talking about 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.300
 that almost 2,000 kilos company almost 2,000 

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:01.450
 kilos reach us by little at least in 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:04.060
 this version that reduced that is a 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:06.220
 wonder how it accelerates like as 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:08.470
 recovered when overtaking because 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:10.630
 good with these six speeds stick 

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:12.310
 low stomped march despite 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.170
 that the volume is very impressive 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:16.360
 drive almost like with a bus 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.040
 for nothing is much more agile than 

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.720
 seems very comfortable suspensions and 

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.489
 obviously comfortable is not for 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:23.769
 doing careers is not to do the 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:25.360
 90 train test or an elusive plan 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:27.010
 per hour because all those are very expensive 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.540
 at security level greatly improved 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:32.050
 before there were only two weapons available 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:35.560
 now there are already four and a thousand 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:39.340
 of braking in order is very well placed 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:41.050
 the day quality then man half and half 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.190
 because for example all this is plastic 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:46.270
 softly the truth is that we have 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:48.660
 I was amazed at the quality of this 

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:51.010
 surface 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:53.800
 but of course we have talked about this 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:55.840
 car in the premium finish would be one 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.730
 superior the limit consists of 28 thousand 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.340
 four hundred euros and tell me by 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:02.590
 28,400 euros where you put seven 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:05.710
 people with your luggage or do you know what is 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:08.500
 impossible that I tell you can be 

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:11.860
 comment some more data but already of 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.450
 minor importance for example this for 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.980
 this analog dashboard here 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.049
 so big when you have in this 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:18.700
 little digital here that gives you all the 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:22.060
 basic information and that in the end almost 

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:24.100
 you just completely miss this you know 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:26.280
 that is, then it has details of 

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:28.870
 fantastic equipment like for example 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.130
 heated steering wheel right now we're 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.050
 in winter and I can assure you that 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:34.200
 comes from luxury or seats with letters 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:36.220
 great and yet it does not bring a 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:38.909
 cruise speed device by 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:42.610
 example or automatic lights 

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:44.289
 automatic let's say that on the one hand it 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:47.379
 it's too much but on the other hand it has 

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:49.729
 some lack at the level of putting 

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:53.749
 stuff everywhere because you see what 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:56.330
 that is, it can extract things that you are not going to 

00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:57.979
 to be able to fill everything it brings up in 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:59.569
 the hollow of the doors has three 

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:01.129
 different holes or solution before 

00:04:59.569 --> 00:05:04.279
 we also miss for example 

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:06.080
 so the typical taxi driver mirror for 

00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:07.909
 control the back troop not but 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:10.849
 good has a heating system 

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:12.949
 that you can that is independent in front 

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:15.830
 and behind or you can regulate it from 

00:05:12.949 --> 00:05:19.300
 here on dvd for example there is no lack for 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:21.729
 let's say that 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:23.379
 is very well has some lagunilla of 

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:25.690
 Equipment kit I've already 

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:28.629
 said but for this price 155 horses 

00:05:25.690 --> 00:05:31.240
 ten groups one of 85 liters and believe me 

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:34.090
 that there are times that we have tightened well and 

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:36.490
 you put that nobody leaves 150 160 without 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:38.770
 What do you know, I can assure you 

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:41.349
 who is very prepared for the day to day 

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:42.819
 a family kits would move in the 

00:05:41.349 --> 00:05:47.069
 day to day at school or the ends of 

00:05:42.819 --> 00:05:49.389
 week getaway plan and 

00:05:47.069 --> 00:05:52.840
 festival with the children hallucinatingly 

00:05:49.389 --> 00:05:55.349
 there is room for every kid that if he looks 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:58.000
 your seven squares I really know a 

00:05:55.349 --> 00:06:00.250
 leftover site is from sanyo the roller 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.729
 without a doubt it is the reference and as always 

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:05.860
 the little video preview of what it is 

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:07.629
 this car in portal coches.net page 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:09.190
 reference web of the motor world and 

00:06:07.629 --> 00:06:11.020
 as always you already know where we are 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:13.349
 see you when you want to see you soon 

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:13.349
 bye
