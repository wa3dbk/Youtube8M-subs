00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:17.830
 And then everyone's going to be right with you. 

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:21.070
 everything as smooth as possible and 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:23.259
 today we are back for another blog 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.490
 here on the channel with me showing my 

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:26.409
 beautiful features right? 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.929
 where are the beautiful features there I got 

00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:30.779
 nothing beautiful at all but what matters 

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:35.379
 It's the people here, it 's not my beauty. 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:38.770
 frustration that exists is thus the fact 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:40.899
 choose mussak the next pokémon the 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:41.469
 next game I'm going to play here at 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:43.809
 channel 

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:46.780
 I do not know if it will be the next game the next 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:49.120
 series but it's one of the next hours should 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.769
 out in July if all goes well all 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.500
 starts in July I will not promise anything 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:56.199
 No one will guarantee this is not certain. 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.449
 but if all goes well it starts in July to 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:01.269
 next channel series that I want 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:03.699
 to make a fourth-generation pokémon or 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:06.850
 be the death pokémon because he died 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:09.060
 the platinum pokémon but which of the three will 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.710
 be in the game have to choose one of them is 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.900
 true folks but as always I can 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.210
 letting you choose to 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:19.750
 have this legal interaction between me and 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:23.470
 So you in the description of this video will 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:26.140
 the following industrial link is 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:28.750
 a polling site and this link will have 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.000
 the next question which pokémon you 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.829
 Do you want me to call throw something at me? 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
 then sense the meaning will be the same to 

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:35.890
 question but I can vary one 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.680
 a little bit of the words but basically 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.509
 So I went back there three Pokémon options 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.000
 of death because it broke and pokemon 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:45.640
 platinum and you choose which 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.770
 I play in the preference of you 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.210
 you believe to be cooler but 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.880
 fun and tals 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:54.969
 There you go and there you go. 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:57.939
 until comment here but the comment look 

00:01:54.969 --> 00:02:00.039
 only important the comment will not 

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:02.530
 serve as the vote 

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:04.750
 You can comment I'm going to read but not 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:06.909
 I will calculate how the vote will be computed 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.520
 How do you vote go there on this site? 

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:13.780

 choose balance website and VOD and beyond that 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.690
 first question on which game should I 

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.550
 play in the fourth generation will also have 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:32.120
 a question about what initial I 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:34.820
 I should choose either water tire or 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.800
 pinguinzinho there the twitt that is the grass 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:39.680
 and the pea is a little monkey of fugu 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.330
 which one of the three should you choose now? 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:44.150
 and there also according to whether in the description 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.250

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:49.310
 you click one of them choose your 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:51.950
 I'm going to prefer it and from it 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.660
 the videos when you get serious or 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.970
 when to start the series that should be in 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.940
 July as I have already said but no guarantees 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:01.040
 sure then basically this is 

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.390
 basically recapitulating that I 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.739
 I will not complete the round in 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.570

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.360
 The bad girl will be cool 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:16.489
 when we start this series that 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.959
 promises to be quite interesting 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:20.030
 Actually, I do not know if it will be interesting. 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:21.560
 but I think it's going to be going to be cool 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:23.959
 I'm looking forward to it 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.489

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:30.170
 practically then it will be cool to play 

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:31.670

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:35.299
 games are inspired by the fourth 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:38.660
 generation but do not really have everything and 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:41.299
