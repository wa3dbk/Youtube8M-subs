potentially a very good player we have

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.469

about<00:01:49.289> yes<00:01:50.039> but<00:01:50.310> we<00:01:50.430> think<00:01:50.609> he's<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:51.270> guy<00:01:51.450> that

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
about yes but we think he's a guy that

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.510 
about yes but we think he's a guy that
obviously<00:01:52.020> would<00:01:52.229> be<00:01:52.259> in<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.619> mix<00:01:52.829> but<00:01:53.100> we're

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
obviously would be in the mix but we're

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.700 
obviously would be in the mix but we're
gonna<00:01:53.609> look<00:01:53.789> at<00:01:53.939> all<00:01:54.090> of<00:01:54.119> our<00:01:54.270> shoes<00:01:54.689> and<00:01:54.960> good

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.370 

obviously<00:02:02.430> how<00:02:03.299> much<00:02:03.540> the<00:02:03.750> big<00:02:03.990> guys<00:02:04.170> are

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
obviously how much the big guys are

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.469 
obviously how much the big guys are
talking<00:02:04.710> about<00:02:04.799> in<00:02:05.460> the<00:02:05.610> first<00:02:05.790> two<00:02:06.090> maybe

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
talking about in the first two maybe

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.660 
talking about in the first two maybe
three<00:02:06.780> spots<00:02:07.140> does<00:02:07.740> make<00:02:07.979> it<00:02:08.160> highly<00:02:08.640> likely

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
three spots does make it highly likely

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.370 
three spots does make it highly likely
you<00:02:09.090> think<00:02:09.300> that<00:02:09.420> you<00:02:09.539> guys<00:02:09.660> look<00:02:09.929> at<00:02:10.050> a<00:02:10.080> wing

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.450 

the<00:02:12.810> lab<00:02:13.020> will<00:02:13.319> depend<00:02:13.710> on<00:02:13.830> what<00:02:14.100> we<00:02:14.130> think

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:14.460 
the lab will depend on what we think

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:16.640 
the lab will depend on what we think
we're<00:02:15.060> going<00:02:15.630> to<00:02:15.720> end<00:02:15.840> up<00:02:16.050> doing<00:02:16.170> and<00:02:16.380> create

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
we're going to end up doing and create

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:17.870 
we're going to end up doing and create
see<00:02:16.890> what<00:02:17.040> kind<00:02:17.220> of<00:02:17.250> players<00:02:17.459> do<00:02:17.610> you<00:02:17.670> think

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:24.770 

their<00:03:19.080> practice<00:03:22.490> not<00:03:23.490> racking<00:03:23.970> it's<00:03:24.120> more<00:03:24.270> you

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:24.780 
their practice not racking it's more you

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.990

more anxious and anticipating what's
gonna<00:03:27.150> happen<00:03:27.569> and<00:03:27.959> I<00:03:28.050> kinda<00:03:28.350> said<00:03:28.530> of<00:03:29.190> course

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:29.400 
gonna happen and I kinda said of course

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.460

afraid<00:05:01.110> and<00:05:01.710> what<00:05:02.580> we<00:05:02.700> have<00:05:02.820> to<00:05:02.940> look<00:05:03.090> at<00:05:03.300> in

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:03.419 
afraid and what we have to look at in

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:08.409 
afraid and what we have to look at in
terms<00:05:03.600> of<00:05:03.840> trade<00:05:04.140> possible

00:05:08.409 --> 00:05:08.419 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:11.299 

I'm<00:05:09.419> not<00:05:10.169> sure<00:05:10.349> I<00:05:10.379> think<00:05:10.499> we'll<00:05:10.889> be<00:05:11.039> able<00:05:11.129> to

00:05:11.299 --> 00:05:11.309 
I'm not sure I think we'll be able to

00:05:11.309 --> 00:05:14.429 
I'm not sure I think we'll be able to
get<00:05:11.549> a<00:05:11.819> few<00:05:12.539> good<00:05:12.779> players<00:05:13.049> and<00:05:13.169> create<00:05:13.589> create

get a few good players and create create

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:16.049 
get a few good players and create create
and<00:05:14.529> that<00:05:14.679> might<00:05:14.949> be<00:05:14.979> an<00:05:15.249> indicator<00:05:15.909> of

00:05:16.049 --> 00:05:16.059 
and that might be an indicator of

00:05:16.059 --> 00:05:22.210 
and that might be an indicator of
direction<00:05:16.779> we<00:05:16.869> make<00:05:17.019> it<00:05:17.199> I<00:05:17.429> mean<00:05:18.429> I<00:05:18.550> know
