just legs backwards so you can try and

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.670 
just legs backwards so you can try and
form<00:03:04.739> this<00:03:04.890> top<00:03:05.130> and<00:03:06.049> what<00:03:07.049> you<00:03:07.170> have<00:03:07.319> to<00:03:07.440> do<00:03:07.560> is

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
form this top and what you have to do is

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.820 
form this top and what you have to do is
you<00:03:07.860> take<00:03:08.100> the<00:03:08.310> front<00:03:08.580> here<00:03:08.819> and<00:03:09.380> you<00:03:10.380> pretty

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.030 
you take the front here and you pretty
much<00:03:10.950> rotate<00:03:11.459> it<00:03:11.610> to<00:03:12.150> the<00:03:12.239> back<00:03:12.920> and<00:03:13.920> I'll

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
much rotate it to the back and I'll

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.680 
much rotate it to the back and I'll
share<00:03:14.280> it<00:03:14.430> from<00:03:14.609> another<00:03:14.850> angle<00:03:17.570> they<00:03:18.570> have

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690
