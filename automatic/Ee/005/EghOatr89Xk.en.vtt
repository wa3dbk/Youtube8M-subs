00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 hey you tube today I want you guys 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.020
 my new minecraft luxury villa 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.420
 imagine I believed in the meantime 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.059
 but the fifth do not quite bring 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.549
 sure if you look again where 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.289
 suits me all right sounds takes 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.960
 Now I agree with no new one 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:22.710
 bought headset and there I thought 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.630
 namely in a nice case if you 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.710
 you can not like that in the 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.789
 Write comments 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:33.739
 of course, but also pleases 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:36.420
 thing the video is reasonably good 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:40.440
 we are here on the 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:45.300
 terrace with a grill and here one 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:49.110
 Dining table overlooking the lake and here is 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:52.430
 the house of it easily the pending 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.430
 luxury house I built 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:01:00.930
 let's go here ranges is 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:09.870
 Entrance area with two large windows 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:11.330
 even as office talon protesting 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:14.670
 big stairwell 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:18.290
 In total , the house has three floors in 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:23.570
 the upper floor is a living room with 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:30.410
 seascape or how pretty modern 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:33.600
 We are living here with two beach chairs 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:35.250
 television and a new sofa of 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.670
 clearly trying on it does not look 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:37.670
 seems bad 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:44.180
 not only the signs we go 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.250
 to build 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:51.920
 I've set that up, too 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:53.970
 Looking good again with the hockey 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.580
 played there is still a release 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.830
 under 4 at least I know no because 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.580
 you can confess another solution for 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:04.560
 Show her that mega 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:09.799
 Here you can already look over there 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.799
 there afterwards continue as above 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:19.550
 So we go into the second floor 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.550
 a little further down 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.490
 from here you can even quite 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.010
 look down 

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:28.840
 that was a big cave that got me 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:35.090
 just rebuilt a bit 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:37.630
 dining room kitchen office and the manner and her 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:43.510
 it went on into the bedroom 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:43.510
 shelf can look down here again 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:53.170
 until now always large bedroom with 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:53.170
 double bed again wardrobe lounge chairs 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:03.680
 It is natural and you can 

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:04.100
 pretty in the living room again 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.350
 back 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:09.820
 I still have a cold 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:12.590
 that's why I'm so surprised 

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:14.830
 many have not asked what it is on the ground 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:17.240
 should always represent fold 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:19.490
 Actually, the carpet should represent 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:22.610
 because I think that fits very well in the 

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:25.520
 room looks better if nothing so as 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.500
 if there is nothing left a bit 

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.390
 on 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:33.140
 if you have a bit of fantasy looks 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:34.970
 it's in typical what i also quite 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:39.380
 nice dark the new picture frames 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:44.710
 and also flowerpots a bit 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:44.710
 diversified purely let's go further 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:51.620
 Now we are in the lower city 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:56.990
 dining table meter large designer designer 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:04:01.300
 latte the room is very large overall 

00:03:56.990 --> 00:04:01.300
 I know I can o 134 you 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:20.039
 a bit higher her kitchen looks 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:24.380
 As always open for cabinet 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:26.160
 stow and you can also repeat 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:28.620
 second floor look 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.419
 I like that very much because they are 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.440
 maybe that too with my houses 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:33.889
 involve us in 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:37.650
 different floors can look 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:39.479
 then it goes on here in the bathroom 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:41.539
 I have something special with this one 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:44.100
 considered and indeed a mirror 

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:47.190
 I have the complete room again 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:48.840
 mirrored built back a 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:51.030
 glass pane is disconnected and it looks it 

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:55.979
 the mirror is of course I want 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:58.440
 but the room is mirrored one 

00:04:55.979 --> 00:05:01.380
 Toilet a shower and over here 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:04.830
 but still on the shelf such a great little one 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:07.520
 flower a sink missing naturally 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.520
 neither 

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:20.340
 Here we are in the office 

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:23.729
 that could be meant there would like me with 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:26.219
 a large panorama of the 

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:28.530
 great lake the beautiful weather that 

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:34.259
 is what it is just not here with us 

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:37.560
 he sees everything now quite large 

00:05:34.259 --> 00:05:44.430
 kept very modern light flooded 

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:46.050
 and again with his great carpet I 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:47.400
 Hope you enjoyed it now 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:50.460
 we are already here 

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:51.750
 again through and if I continue with 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:55.310
 to record voice 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:55.310
 please write me in the comments 

00:05:55.639 --> 00:06:02.270
 it is easier for me and for you 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:04.590
 because they did not understand me 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:09.360
 I would be very happy if 

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:11.340
 you could do that and then I say 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:13.650
 come times until next time now 

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:14.940
