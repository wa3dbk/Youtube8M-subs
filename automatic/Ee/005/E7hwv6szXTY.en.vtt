00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 hello everyone guys are andrea de rosa 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.180
 place playfish does www.lexbook.it in 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.280
 facebook page indiscretion if not with 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.690
 cell phones more than nose in man of the 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.700
 match the first minus must be 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.330
 released this year since yesterday and is 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.670
 been released because I am in fact 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:20.490
 man playing in the cup final of 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:22.800
 binds against the leeds where the city has 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.840
 Terror won this orange card 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.150
 very beautiful this year however 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.970
 the graphics show an 86 of hoover 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:33.390
 all 83 speed shooting 83 plus 7 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:36.149
 respect his not fit and the more he is 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.460
 also plus 3 respective x86 version of 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.710
 passage and 89 of 320 of the 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.430
 very high characteristics and with this 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.530
 player 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:46.469
 I felt really good in fact the 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.640
 field reflects those very high values 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.079
 towards the card 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.570
 going to watch some sit down and 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.210
 ingame we can notice 92 against balla or 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.160
 34 the next 92 20 retire the 92 in 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:59.760
 dribbling 98 onwards there are conditions 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:02.489
 90 and implementation 88 the launcher 96 in 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:06.330
 past doubts 89 in the past 88 and passes 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:09.180
 sorry I swam importance 98 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.460
 in balance 87 in agility, in short, a 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.710
 really great player in the field 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.720
 as mentioned before it reflects these 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.619
 artists in fact going to talk about tops 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.330
 and flop 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.390
 the first top is certainly the binomial 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.670
 speed and dribbling agility because the 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.950
 dribbling this player is exceptional 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:30.299
 really exceptional I think it 's his 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:33.390
 top top because it is very agile 87 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:36.390
 frosty it seems 95 also even 99 wanting 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.189
 and he wants more if we want little 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.670
 give him another merit even a 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:44.310
 balancing that other because it is free 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.189
 in short, because its balance is 98 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:49.350
 so sometimes it helps in not losing of 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.630
 shoulder shoulder when you are strong 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.270
 physically but still he holds on 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.920
 feet and this therefore also helps for the 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.000
 dribbling because if you fell mine 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.390
 assistant of carandini 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.399
 obviously it would be bad then 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.170
 however we said agility and speed 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:05.570
 dribbling these three things all go 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:10.180
 together and do 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:12.830
 the two exceptions in fact a lot for here and 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:17.120
 and this is the first eye I feel 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:18.170
 to give anna you going ahead with 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.090
 the list of we can certainly 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.620
 talk about past passage i 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.310
 everyone's goals 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:28.040
 84 86 of the long passages and 89 states 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.630
 short so he can do so assists 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.840
 knows how to cross etcetera 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.910
 he can do short passes he can do there 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.950
 12 can also make beautiful fields 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.780
 game made to change several times of 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.430
 serve schurrle on the other band 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:44.900
 and to do it without any problem or 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:47.330
 to make a nice long launch ok now 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:50.030
 let's talk about the feature maybe more 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:54.920
 important in a player I don't know in 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:57.230
 this feature is the healthy the 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:00.650
 shooting 80 hours shooting with 90 in 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:02.600
 finalization then to 92 in rounds 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.760
 98 onwards there are missions of the 

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.050
 punishments with him are 20 exceptional 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.880
 even though I've never been able to care for you 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:09.290
 I turn to assure you that you are 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:13.670
 exceptional 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:15.920
 so we said 88 then the long and 88 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:18.019
 grandeur of wind throws of all kinds 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:21.410
 or this player in areas outside the 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:26.360
 of power per lap and entering because it is 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:28.010
 really a very good excellent shooter 8 

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.870
 at first maybe I thought that drawer 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.750
 of non-fit pressure power 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:36.049
 like me it is really a surprise indeed one 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:40.040
 made some very very beautiful goals then 

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:42.170
 this and this thing for carlos and 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:44.030
 however far sea sacrifices and 67 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:47.739
 because balanced by balance 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:51.440
 sorry the pun but it pikes e 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:53.450
 laughing nor oulx him another step then 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:55.760
 in theory 1 empty to others of e 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:58.549
 should be composition is not so 

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.799
 he sometimes finds himself behind 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:03.110
 midfield while attacking 

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:04.790
 I really don't know why because his 

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:07.010
 attack placement now if any 

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.269
 they will be good 681 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:11.180
 then there are also some good ones 

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:14.150
 features also looks for networks 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:17.030
 and therefore sometimes the twisted sleepers 

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.320
 at 100 sometimes behind midfield 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:21.440
 in short, positioning 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:24.380
 This player's general works is not 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:26.960
 liked maybe it will be that external and of 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:29.690
 usually geraci then the game does it 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:30.260
 I play more c is behind I don't know I don't have 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:32.570
 explanations 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:34.970
 try however sometimes I didn't want to 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:37.820
 find myself in position however I was 

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:38.510
 forgotten 34 seles climate especially 46 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.700
 ve weak 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:42.440
 I have not yet figured out if I were masi and estrus 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:46.220
 left-handed made me left-footed goals 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:47.150
 really exceptional so this 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:50.210
 gesture that you can use 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:55.220
 quietly with both feet e 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:57.170
 finally he he at 53 of crisis and uil in a 

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:00.500
 nice way to enhance feel in the head 

00:04:57.170 --> 00:05:02.210
 and therefore is not a head hitter 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:04.400
 in any case these to the top and 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:05.960
 flop guys I recommend you leave 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.210
 many likes because this is the first one 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:10.100
 world review of one match at a time 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:11.840
 of management of the first north and goods e 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:13.730
 having said that anyway I greet you and 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:16.120
 nothing we hear in the next video 

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:16.120
