crater<00:00:24.600> attack<00:00:24.869> that<00:00:25.050> will<00:00:25.289> increase<00:00:25.650> damage

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
crater attack that will increase damage

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.960 
crater attack that will increase damage
over<00:00:26.430> time<00:00:26.460> it<00:00:26.880> also<00:00:27.090> has<00:00:27.420> a<00:00:28.730> elemental<00:00:29.730> type

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
over time it also has a elemental type

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.780 
over time it also has a elemental type
that<00:00:30.210> kind<00:00:30.599> of<00:00:30.720> gives<00:00:31.289> a<00:00:31.410> wintry<00:00:31.949> feel<00:00:32.250> because

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
that kind of gives a wintry feel because

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.729 
that kind of gives a wintry feel because
it<00:00:33.030> gives<00:00:33.300> you<00:00:33.570> the<00:00:33.719> blizzard<00:00:34.020> weather<00:00:34.320> effect

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
it gives you the blizzard weather effect

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.410 
it gives you the blizzard weather effect
of<00:00:34.860> course<00:00:35.070> and<00:00:35.280> that's<00:00:35.730> some<00:00:35.940> good<00:00:36.090> damage

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
of course and that's some good damage

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.160 
of course and that's some good damage
and<00:00:36.600> he<00:00:37.050> also<00:00:37.320> has<00:00:37.770> his<00:00:38.329> last<00:00:39.329> attack<00:00:39.629> will<00:00:39.930> hit

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
and he also has his last attack will hit

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.860 
and he also has his last attack will hit
him<00:00:40.379> up<00:00:40.530> for<00:00:40.879> 300<00:00:41.879> plus<00:00:42.270> it<00:00:42.480> will<00:00:42.629> also

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
him up for 300 plus it will also

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.000 
him up for 300 plus it will also
increase<00:00:43.440> his<00:00:43.710> damage<00:00:44.129> for<00:00:44.340> free<00:00:44.520> turns<00:00:44.989> for

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 
increase his damage for free turns for

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.450 
increase his damage for free turns for
twenty<00:00:47.010> five<00:00:47.160> percent<00:00:47.190> which<00:00:47.940> is<00:00:48.239> quite<00:00:48.780> nasty

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
twenty five percent which is quite nasty

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.450 
twenty five percent which is quite nasty
so<00:00:50.539> for<00:00:51.539> this<00:00:51.840> I<00:00:52.170> recommend<00:00:53.100> you<00:00:53.280> use<00:00:53.430> a

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
so for this I recommend you use a

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.299 
so for this I recommend you use a
humanoid<00:00:53.910> pet<00:00:54.149> I<00:00:54.360> have<00:00:54.750> my<00:00:55.230> McArdle<00:00:55.829> here<00:00:56.010> but

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
humanoid pet I have my McArdle here but

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.700 
humanoid pet I have my McArdle here but
I<00:00:56.579> kind<00:00:57.239> of<00:00:57.300> figured<00:00:57.420> out<00:00:57.660> Mikado's<00:00:58.079> pretty

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
I kind of figured out Mikado's pretty

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.950 
I kind of figured out Mikado's pretty
damn<00:00:58.920> rare<00:00:59.129> to<00:00:59.250> get<00:00:59.399> so<00:00:59.879> most<00:01:00.510> people<00:01:00.660> might

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
damn rare to get so most people might

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.100 
damn rare to get so most people might
not<00:01:01.109> have<00:01:01.320> him<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.739> use<00:01:02.180> but<00:01:03.180> most<00:01:03.840> humanoids

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110 
not have him to use but most humanoids

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.500 
not have him to use but most humanoids
should<00:01:04.470> be<00:01:04.619> good<00:01:05.070> to<00:01:05.129> use<00:01:05.580> for<00:01:06.030> this<00:01:06.270> fight

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
should be good to use for this fight

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.140 
should be good to use for this fight
because<00:01:06.720> you<00:01:07.290> want<00:01:07.470> to<00:01:07.710> avoid<00:01:08.100> getting<00:01:08.909> as

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
because you want to avoid getting as

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.880 
because you want to avoid getting as
much<00:01:09.299> credit<00:01:09.659> damage<00:01:09.900> as<00:01:09.990> possible<00:01:10.049> that's

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
much credit damage as possible that's

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.550 
much credit damage as possible that's
why<00:01:11.070> I<00:01:11.100> suggest<00:01:11.939> you<00:01:12.030> not<00:01:12.270> using<00:01:12.570> and<00:01:12.960> on<00:01:13.350> their

your own dead pet very very fast so a

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.620 
your own dead pet very very fast so a
humanoid<00:01:22.350> will<00:01:22.650> be<00:01:22.830> good<00:01:23.009> because<00:01:23.360> with<00:01:24.360> his

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
humanoid will be good because with his

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.350 
humanoid will be good because with his
maximum<00:01:25.380> credit<00:01:26.130> attack<00:01:26.520> it<00:01:26.729> will<00:01:26.939> still<00:01:27.240> only

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
maximum credit attack it will still only

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.429 
maximum credit attack it will still only
do<00:01:27.509> about<00:01:27.630> 300<00:01:28.140> damage<00:01:28.439> to<00:01:28.650> your<00:01:28.890> pet<00:01:29.189> which<00:01:29.820> is

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:30.439 
do about 300 damage to your pet which is

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:33.380 
do about 300 damage to your pet which is
manageable<00:01:31.439> so<00:01:32.070> I<00:01:32.100> say<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.909> idle<00:01:33.210> would

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
manageable so I say the idle would

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.630 
manageable so I say the idle would
probably<00:01:33.689> be<00:01:33.810> best<00:01:33.990> for<00:01:34.259> that<00:01:34.409> fight<00:01:34.710> now<00:01:35.100> here

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
probably be best for that fight now here

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.090 
probably be best for that fight now here
