00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:20.800
 this is the green smoothie this liquefied I 

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:25.600
 I take it every morning to burn 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:28.630
 Fat lose weight and lose weight too 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:31.630
 help to regulate digestion and have 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:35.430
 a slender figure now I'm going to tell you 

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.430
 how did you prepare this liquefied 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:42.510
 for this smoothie we will need 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.510
 pineapple 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:50.630
 a leaf of cactus 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:54.340
 an action wand 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:54.340
 four sticks of parsley 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.340
 a grapefruit 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.580
 and an orange first thing we're going to 

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.580
 do 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.000
 The first thing we are going to do is that 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.520
 let's peel the pineapple and we're going to 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.600
 split into small pieces and we're going to 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:16.299
 grab a cup of pineapple 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.670
 What I do as I do is give me a 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:21.369
 little bit of laziness peeling the pineapple 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:24.220
 every day and starting the when 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:27.759
 I bring from the super hair and the whole part 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:30.850
 and I put it in individual packages of a 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:33.759
 cup as well as this 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:36.830
 This is a house that I had already 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:38.690
 party and I put it in the freezer 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:41.660
 when I'm going to occupy the sack of 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:44.750
 freezer and to the abuse here I have a 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:47.840
 cup with pineapple is the same as nopal 

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:49.930
 I'm going to use half prickly pear because it's 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:53.570
 cactus leaf if this large enough 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:55.490
 so when I use a nopal more 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.640
 small that the leaf is smaller 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:01.550
 I put a whole sheet this time 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:05.200
 I'm going to put just over half 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:08.140
 I'm going to put the pineapple on the canvas 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.780
 I'm also going to put the nopal in this 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:14.230
 half case of cactus leaf because it is very 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:16.750
 big the sheet I'm also going to put the 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.780
 washed celery barite of afro I'm going to 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:23.580
 split into much smaller pieces 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.580
 so as not to throw the whole whole bar 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.629
 to the parsley I'm going to cut the sticks 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:39.110
 in the blender 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:41.680
 I'm going to extract the juice from the grapefruit and 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.680
 orange 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.720
 I recommend that if you are going to do this 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:01.950
 liquefied consult with your doctor 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:04.890
 if you can take it how many days should you 

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:08.099
 take it and it's that way when I 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:10.670
 I found out about this smoothie this I am with 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:13.459
 my doctor and I asked him 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:16.400
 I told him if he could drink this smoothie 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:18.099
 my doctor told me yes but that 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.810
 I also had to have breakfast 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:23.500
 perfectly so that the acid of the 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:26.239
 grapefruit does not irritate me will make the stomach 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:29.450
 I know people who drink liquified 

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:32.310
 but he does not eat anything and that's why 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:35.670
 bad I do not know why they do it 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:38.030
 I recommend you check with your 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.030
 doctor 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:44.310
 if you do not have excess weight if you do not 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:47.010
 you have a lot of fat to burn then 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:49.920
 you can substitute grapefruit for another 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:53.569
 orange and instead of grapefruit in orange 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.569
 you would put two oranges 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:04.740
 to me the doctor recommended me 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:07.830
 which will use grapefruit only two or three 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:10.850
 times a week and others well of the 

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:13.650
 week that will use nothing else two oranges 

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:18.829
 since I took out the game of the orange and the 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:18.829
 grapefruit also in the blender 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.310
 and now we go to which 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:40.250
 and so our smoothie is ready to 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:42.590
 enjoy yourself then it has an excellent 

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:45.169
 I like to taste a lot in any 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:47.150
 sacrifice take the smoothie and you 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:49.759
 I invite you to prepare and take 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:52.580
 but first consult your doctor and 

00:04:49.759 --> 00:04:54.469
 ask him if you can take it I hope that 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:58.270
 you liked this video and I you 

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:58.270
