00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
we'll use that I'm also going to use an

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.680 
we'll use that I'm also going to use an
ivy<00:00:40.739> leaf<00:00:40.890> to<00:00:41.070> finish<00:00:41.370> it<00:00:41.489> off<00:00:41.640> I'm<00:00:41.879> also<00:00:42.360> going

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
ivy leaf to finish it off I'm also going

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.779 
ivy leaf to finish it off I'm also going
to<00:00:42.780> wire<00:00:43.110> it<00:00:43.350> so<00:00:43.739> the<00:00:43.890> roses<00:00:44.340> have<00:00:44.370> all<00:00:44.610> been

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
to wire it so the roses have all been

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.810 
to wire it so the roses have all been
wired<00:00:45.059> I<00:00:45.239> think<00:00:45.450> I<00:00:45.570> will<00:00:45.930> show<00:00:46.320> you<00:00:46.379> how<00:00:47.280> to<00:00:47.309> do

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
wired I think I will show you how to do

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.940 
wired I think I will show you how to do
that<00:00:48.000> because<00:00:48.329> some<00:00:48.629> people<00:00:49.079> need<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.649> know

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
that because some people need to know

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.160 
that because some people need to know
how<00:00:50.250> to<00:00:50.309> do<00:00:50.579> that<00:00:50.730> right<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.449> reason<00:00:51.629> you<00:00:51.870> wire

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
how to do that right the reason you wire

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.560 
how to do that right the reason you wire
is<00:00:52.469> so<00:00:52.770> that<00:00:53.010> you<00:00:53.219> can<00:00:53.250> manipulate<00:00:53.640> the

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
is so that you can manipulate the

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.470 
is so that you can manipulate the
placement<00:00:55.140> of<00:00:55.230> the<00:00:55.559> flower<00:00:55.860> and<00:00:56.160> also<00:00:56.969> it

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
placement of the flower and also it

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.330 
placement of the flower and also it
removes<00:00:57.960> a<00:00:58.199> lot<00:00:58.379> of<00:00:58.440> the<00:00:58.649> bulk<00:00:58.920> from<00:00:59.219> the

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
removes a lot of the bulk from the

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.400 
removes a lot of the bulk from the
flowers<00:00:59.789> when<00:01:00.420> you're<00:01:00.570> using<00:01:00.750> fresh<00:01:01.170> or

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
flowers when you're using fresh or

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.380 
flowers when you're using fresh or
artificial<00:01:02.010> or<00:01:02.340> fresh<00:01:02.640> flowers<00:01:02.940> anyway

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
artificial or fresh flowers anyway

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.140 
artificial or fresh flowers anyway
sometimes<00:01:04.129> it's<00:01:05.129> best<00:01:05.430> to<00:01:05.549> get<00:01:05.729> rid<00:01:05.939> of<00:01:06.000> that

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
sometimes it's best to get rid of that

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.170 
sometimes it's best to get rid of that
steam<00:01:06.450> because<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:07.320> bud<00:01:08.070> can<00:01:08.340> snap<00:01:08.820> off<00:01:09.000> at

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
steam because the bud can snap off at

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.880 
steam because the bud can snap off at
the<00:01:09.299> head<00:01:09.570> so<00:01:10.049> it's<00:01:10.200> just<00:01:10.439> a<00:01:10.560> matter<00:01:10.770> of

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
the head so it's just a matter of

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.460 
the head so it's just a matter of
getting<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.820> wire<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:12.750> I'm<00:01:12.869> using<00:01:13.110> about<00:01:13.439> a

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
getting the wire and I'm using about a

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.130 
getting the wire and I'm using about a
22<00:01:13.979> gauge<00:01:14.369> wire<00:01:14.400> put<00:01:15.390> that<00:01:15.570> up<00:01:15.720> there<00:01:15.750> like

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
22 gauge wire put that up there like

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.200 
22 gauge wire put that up there like
that<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.380> then<00:01:16.770> just<00:01:16.979> twist<00:01:17.430> that<00:01:17.880> around

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
that and then just twist that around

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.020 
that and then just twist that around
there<00:01:19.140> like<00:01:19.439> that<00:01:19.920> so<00:01:20.159> that<00:01:20.610> you've<00:01:20.790> got

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
there like that so that you've got

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.700 
there like that so that you've got
instead<00:01:21.509> of<00:01:21.600> having<00:01:21.780> that<00:01:21.960> big<00:01:22.170> fix<00:01:22.439> stem

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710

left hand or the right hand of whichever

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.550 
left hand or the right hand of whichever
way<00:01:53.579> you<00:01:54.020> whether<00:01:55.020> you're<00:01:55.229> left<00:01:55.380> or

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
way you whether you're left or

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.530 
way you whether you're left or
right-handed<00:01:56.189> and<00:01:56.369> then<00:01:56.820> just<00:01:57.060> twist<00:01:57.420> that

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:57.540 
right-handed and then just twist that

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.780 
right-handed and then just twist that
down<00:01:58.049> and<00:01:58.320> around<00:01:58.560> there<00:01:58.740> like<00:01:58.920> there<00:01:59.159> now<00:01:59.729> the

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
down and around there like there now the

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.450 
down and around there like there now the
weight<00:02:00.149> of<00:02:00.360> the<00:02:00.540> wire<00:02:00.750> I<00:02:01.619> know<00:02:01.950> that<00:02:02.280> that's

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
weight of the wire I know that that's

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.249 
weight of the wire I know that that's
the<00:02:02.670> perfect<00:02:02.909> weight<00:02:03.270> for<00:02:03.479> that<00:02:03.509> white<00:02:03.869> for

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
the perfect weight for that white for

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.830 
the perfect weight for that white for
the<00:02:04.380> be<00:02:05.219> reset<00:02:05.549> of<00:02:05.670> white<00:02:05.909> because<00:02:06.329> it's<00:02:06.509> still

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
the be reset of white because it's still

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.320 
the be reset of white because it's still
standing<00:02:07.229> a<00:02:07.680> ripped<00:02:07.950> and<00:02:08.280> isn't<00:02:08.849> tipping<00:02:09.209> over

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
standing a ripped and isn't tipping over

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.600 
standing a ripped and isn't tipping over
so<00:02:09.929> that's<00:02:10.200> how<00:02:10.349> you<00:02:10.410> know<00:02:10.649> now<00:02:10.950> with<00:02:11.160> the<00:02:11.340> leaf

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
so that's how you know now with the leaf

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.309 
so that's how you know now with the leaf
it's<00:02:12.000> just<00:02:12.660> a<00:02:12.870> mess

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
it's just a mess

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.380 
it's just a mess
two<00:02:13.379> of<00:02:13.590> what<00:02:14.280> I<00:02:14.310> do<00:02:14.430> with<00:02:14.700> these<00:02:14.879> is<00:02:15.030> I<00:02:15.150> get<00:02:15.299> the

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
two of what I do with these is I get the

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.270 
two of what I do with these is I get the
wire<00:02:15.569> and<00:02:15.780> I<00:02:15.810> put<00:02:16.349> a<00:02:16.379> little<00:02:16.620> like<00:02:17.129> a<00:02:17.159> little

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
wire and I put a little like a little

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.559 
wire and I put a little like a little
weep<00:02:17.639> slant<00:02:18.359> cap<00:02:18.659> there<00:02:18.959> then<00:02:19.650> take<00:02:20.069> that

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
weep slant cap there then take that

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:24.259 
weep slant cap there then take that
through<00:02:21.569> we<00:02:22.560> your<00:02:22.769> main<00:02:23.069> vein<00:02:23.730> of<00:02:23.999> your

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
through we your main vein of your

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:28.160 
through we your main vein of your
Leafers<00:02:24.810> and<00:02:25.109> then<00:02:25.739> bring<00:02:26.069> that<00:02:26.099> down<00:02:26.760> like<00:02:27.749> so

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
Leafers and then bring that down like so

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.890 
Leafers and then bring that down like so
and<00:02:28.530> then<00:02:29.010> twist<00:02:29.370> that<00:02:29.579> around<00:02:29.639> now<00:02:30.120> I've<00:02:30.719> got

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
and then twist that around now I've got

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.679 
and then twist that around now I've got
another<00:02:31.230> of<00:02:31.469> the<00:02:31.590> Gabourey<00:02:32.040> and<00:02:32.370> I've<00:02:33.150> got<00:02:33.420> the

00:02:33.679 --> 00:02:33.689 
another of the Gabourey and I've got the

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:35.270 
another of the Gabourey and I've got the
rose<00:02:33.900> leaf<00:02:34.230> so<00:02:34.469> that's<00:02:34.650> just<00:02:34.829> going<00:02:35.069> to<00:02:35.129> go

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
rose leaf so that's just going to go

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.759 
rose leaf so that's just going to go
onto<00:02:35.549> there<00:02:35.939> like<00:02:36.150> that<00:02:36.450> and<00:02:36.810> I'll<00:02:37.409> do<00:02:37.620> the

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:37.769 
onto there like that and I'll do the

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:39.649 
onto there like that and I'll do the
same<00:02:38.069> thing<00:02:38.129> just<00:02:38.579> take<00:02:38.819> it<00:02:38.939> up<00:02:39.060> through<00:02:39.359> them

00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:39.659 
same thing just take it up through them

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:42.589 
same thing just take it up through them
see<00:02:40.319> that<00:02:40.560> lift<00:02:40.919> up<00:02:41.069> there<00:02:41.400> and<00:02:41.730> then<00:02:42.299> just

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
see that lift up there and then just

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:45.649 
see that lift up there and then just
bring<00:02:42.840> that<00:02:42.959> down<00:02:43.349> like<00:02:44.189> that<00:02:44.639> and<00:02:44.939> then<00:02:45.450> just

bring that down like that and then just

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:47.390 
bring that down like that and then just
twist<00:02:46.019> that<00:02:46.379> around<00:02:46.590> there<00:02:47.040> like<00:02:47.069> that

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:47.400 
twist that around there like that

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.270 
twist that around there like that
perfect<00:02:47.819> now<00:02:48.569> I<00:02:48.599> can<00:02:49.049> manipulate<00:02:49.379> it<00:02:49.799> right

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
perfect now I can manipulate it right

right<00:03:02.310> there's<00:03:02.639> one<00:03:02.969> tape<00:03:04.189> these<00:03:05.189> are<00:03:05.400> the

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
right there's one tape these are the

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:08.720 
right there's one tape these are the
next<00:03:05.760> one<00:03:06.180> tapes<00:03:06.719> and<00:03:07.169> the<00:03:07.829> least<00:03:08.099> em<00:03:08.549> you've

next one tapes and the least em you've

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.159 
next one tapes and the least em you've
got<00:03:08.939> the<00:03:09.090> beer<00:03:09.299> it<00:03:09.419> is<00:03:09.510> because<00:03:09.750> as<00:03:09.900> I<00:03:10.019> said

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:10.169 
got the beer it is because as I said

00:03:10.169 --> 00:03:11.199 
got the beer it is because as I said
it's<00:03:10.319> going<00:03:10.349> to<00:03:10.500> get<00:03:10.650> rid<00:03:10.799> of<00:03:10.889> all<00:03:10.980> that

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
it's going to get rid of all that

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:13.970 
it's going to get rid of all that
unnecessary<00:03:12.209> bulk<00:03:12.569> and<00:03:12.870> then<00:03:13.439> I'll<00:03:13.560> just<00:03:13.769> do

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
unnecessary bulk and then I'll just do

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:20.530 
unnecessary bulk and then I'll just do
the<00:03:14.099> same<00:03:14.489> with<00:03:14.969> that<00:03:15.389> and<00:03:17.030> with<00:03:18.030> the<00:03:18.840> leaf

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
the same with that and with the leaf

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.420 
the same with that and with the leaf
that<00:03:21.540> doesn't<00:03:21.959> take<00:03:22.139> very<00:03:22.169> long<00:03:22.590> and<00:03:22.889> you<00:03:23.340> know

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
that doesn't take very long and you know

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:25.189 
that doesn't take very long and you know
like<00:03:23.609> if<00:03:23.729> you<00:03:23.909> were<00:03:24.120> using<00:03:24.389> fresh<00:03:24.870> you<00:03:25.049> could

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:25.199 
like if you were using fresh you could

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:27.589 
like if you were using fresh you could
do<00:03:25.349> that<00:03:25.590> tape<00:03:25.919> and<00:03:26.159> why<00:03:26.340> everything<00:03:26.819> the<00:03:27.389> day
