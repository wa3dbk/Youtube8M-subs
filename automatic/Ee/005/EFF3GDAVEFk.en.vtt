00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
compressed air compressor and of course

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:39.819 
compressed air compressor and of course
a<00:00:34.290> Fraser<00:00:34.980> flanger<00:00:35.879> tremolo<00:00:36.450> rotary<00:00:37.610> I<00:00:38.610> got<00:00:39.120> a

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:39.829 
a Fraser flanger tremolo rotary I got a

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:43.040 
a Fraser flanger tremolo rotary I got a
delay<00:00:41.030> zero<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.180> ninety<00:00:42.480> nine<00:00:42.660> milliseconds

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
delay zero to ninety nine milliseconds

delay zero to ninety nine milliseconds
and<00:00:44.149> another<00:00:45.149> lave<00:00:45.480> from<00:00:46.190> 100<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.219> seven

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
and another lave from 100 to seven

and another lave from 100 to seven
hundred<00:00:47.640> milliseconds<00:00:48.449> and<00:00:48.649> also<00:00:49.649> reverb<00:00:50.239> so

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
hundred milliseconds and also reverb so

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.799 
hundred milliseconds and also reverb so
there's<00:00:52.050> also<00:00:52.320> a<00:00:52.500> bypass<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:53.460> tuner<00:00:53.940> I've<00:00:54.539> got

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
there's also a bypass and tuner I've got

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.470 
there's also a bypass and tuner I've got
a<00:00:54.840> memory<00:00:55.079> mode<00:00:55.410> so<00:00:56.070> i<00:00:56.100> can<00:00:56.609> save<00:00:56.969> at<00:00:58.730> 13<00:00:59.730> yeah

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
a memory mode so i can save at 13 yeah

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.959 
a memory mode so i can save at 13 yeah
please<00:01:00.930> 13<00:01:01.410> sounds<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:02.129> i<00:01:02.519> think<00:01:02.760> that's

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
please 13 sounds and i think that's

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.410 
please 13 sounds and i think that's
that's<00:01:03.359> enough<00:01:03.690> I<00:01:03.899> don't<00:01:04.320> mean<00:01:04.700> there<00:01:05.700> is<00:01:06.030> a

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
that's enough I don't mean there is a

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.100 
that's enough I don't mean there is a
parallel<00:01:06.690> which<00:01:07.680> are<00:01:07.799> normally<00:01:07.890> used<00:01:08.159> for

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
parallel which are normally used for

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:14.780 
parallel which are normally used for
controlling<00:01:10.369> my<00:01:11.509> muscle<00:01:12.509> labor<00:01:12.689> level<00:01:13.590> and<00:01:13.830> I

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
controlling my muscle labor level and I

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.690 
controlling my muscle labor level and I
can<00:01:15.479> also<00:01:16.290> change<00:01:16.939> it<00:01:17.939> to<00:01:18.590> wawa<00:01:19.590> power<00:01:19.860> for

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
can also change it to wawa power for

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.480 
can also change it to wawa power for
this<00:01:20.850> hour<00:01:21.090> has<00:01:21.360> to<00:01:21.600> put<00:01:22.229> my<00:01:22.380> feet<00:01:22.650> on<00:01:22.860> it<00:01:23.040> and

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
this hour has to put my feet on it and

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:40.110 
this hour has to put my feet on it and
pressing<00:01:24.000> a<00:01:24.240> bit<00:01:24.420> in<00:01:24.659> front<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:25.500> then<00:01:25.680> I

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:40.120 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:58.460 

oh<00:01:53.880> so<00:01:54.880> maybe<00:01:55.450> sa<00:01:55.870> else<00:01:56.170> is<00:01:56.320> a<00:01:57.060> knocking<00:01:58.060> sound

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
oh so maybe sa else is a knocking sound

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.560 
oh so maybe sa else is a knocking sound
change<00:01:59.470> a<00:01:59.560> bit<00:01:59.710> maybe<00:02:00.640> it<00:02:00.820> sounds<00:02:01.090> all<00:02:01.420> right

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570

about him I just got the basics against
Marshall<00:04:42.230> energy<00:04:42.710> efficiency<00:04:42.860> d<00:04:43.610> got<00:04:44.510> only

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 
Marshall energy efficiency d got only

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:46.990 
Marshall energy efficiency d got only
only<00:04:45.440> other<00:04:45.710> two<00:04:45.950> channels<00:04:46.430> clean<00:04:46.760> and

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:47.000 
only other two channels clean and

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.890 
only other two channels clean and
overdrive<00:04:47.410> unlike<00:04:48.410> gain<00:04:48.680> very<00:04:49.010> much<00:04:49.220> and<00:04:49.900> my

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:50.900 
overdrive unlike gain very much and my

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:54.430 
overdrive unlike gain very much and my
equalizer<00:04:51.410> is<00:04:51.830> most<00:04:52.340> very<00:04:53.300> very<00:04:53.510> warm<00:04:53.750> sound<00:04:54.140> I

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 
equalizer is most very very warm sound I

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:57.490 
equalizer is most very very warm sound I
have<00:04:54.650> to<00:04:54.740> base<00:04:54.920> at<00:04:55.250> about<00:04:55.760> 10<00:04:56.150> to<00:04:56.750> counter<00:04:57.200> or

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.500 
have to base at about 10 to counter or

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:01.960 
have to base at about 10 to counter or
middle<00:04:57.770> at<00:04:57.980> three<00:04:58.850> and<00:04:59.060> travel<00:04:59.690> on<00:04:59.900> for<00:05:00.970> an

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:01.970 
middle at three and travel on for an

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.180 
middle at three and travel on for an
hour<00:05:02.090> setting<00:05:02.390> often<00:05:02.810> use<00:05:03.020> is<00:05:03.410> the<00:05:03.800> base<00:05:03.980> at

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:04.190 
hour setting often use is the base at

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:10.290 
hour setting often use is the base at
six<00:05:04.640> contour<00:05:05.560> them<00:05:06.560> and<00:05:06.860> treble<00:05:07.640> or<00:05:07.940> bass<00:05:08.830> 65

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:10.300 
six contour them and treble or bass 65

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:17.350 
six contour them and treble or bass 65
and<00:05:11.300> again<00:05:11.840> I<00:05:12.490> most<00:05:13.490> set<00:05:14.260> what<00:05:15.260> is<00:05:15.380> it<00:05:15.590> for<00:05:16.360> 4.5

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:17.360 
and again I most set what is it for 4.5

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.719 
and again I most set what is it for 4.5
or<00:05:17.780> even<00:05:18.440> five

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:19.729 
or even five

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:22.089 
or even five
so<00:05:20.360> it's<00:05:20.479> just<00:05:20.599> a<00:05:20.719> good<00:05:20.870> sound<00:05:21.169> as<00:05:21.439> you<00:05:21.770> can<00:05:21.860> see

00:05:22.089 --> 00:05:22.099 
so it's just a good sound as you can see

00:05:22.099 --> 00:05:25.119 
so it's just a good sound as you can see
or<00:05:22.370> not<00:05:22.879> I<00:05:23.120> don't<00:05:23.180> know<00:05:23.330> my<00:05:24.020> bullying<00:05:24.439> has<00:05:24.770> very

00:05:25.119 --> 00:05:25.129 
or not I don't know my bullying has very

00:05:25.129 --> 00:05:29.379

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:29.389 
low down I live in the flat and I can

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:34.379 
low down I live in the flat and I can
put<00:05:30.199> it<00:05:30.349> that<00:05:31.339> way<00:05:31.839> so<00:05:32.919> the<00:05:33.919> neighbors

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:34.389 
put it that way so the neighbors

00:05:34.389 --> 00:05:37.510 
put it that way so the neighbors
wouldn't<00:05:35.389> be<00:05:35.509> happy<00:05:35.779> about<00:05:35.809> it<00:05:36.169> but<00:05:37.159> it's<00:05:37.309> just
