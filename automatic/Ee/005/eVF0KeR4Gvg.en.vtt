00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
keys for the review but this was the

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.610 
keys for the review but this was the
first<00:02:32.100> knife<00:02:32.460> in<00:02:32.730> the<00:02:32.910> Spyderco<00:02:33.630> lineup<00:02:34.500> that

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
first knife in the Spyderco lineup that

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.210 
first knife in the Spyderco lineup that
I<00:02:34.680> own<00:02:34.830> that<00:02:35.070> has<00:02:35.280> that<00:02:35.550> zdp<00:02:35.910> 189<00:02:36.720> and<00:02:37.050> I<00:02:38.010> really

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
I own that has that zdp 189 and I really

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.440 
I own that has that zdp 189 and I really
wanted<00:02:38.460> to<00:02:38.520> give<00:02:38.700> it<00:02:38.730> a<00:02:38.880> test<00:02:39.090> so<00:02:39.360> I'll

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
wanted to give it a test so I'll

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.590 
wanted to give it a test so I'll
probably<00:02:39.570> do<00:02:39.840> some<00:02:39.870> cut<00:02:40.230> test<00:02:40.470> with<00:02:40.650> this<00:02:40.830> and

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:41.600 
probably do some cut test with this and

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.980 
probably do some cut test with this and
some<00:02:42.600> other<00:02:42.780> different<00:02:42.990> types<00:02:43.410> of<00:02:43.650> tests<00:02:44.070> to

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:44.990 
some other different types of tests to

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:48.380 
some other different types of tests to
kind<00:02:45.990> of<00:02:46.110> see<00:02:46.440> how<00:02:46.560> it<00:02:46.590> ranks<00:02:46.890> up<00:02:47.130> against<00:02:47.580> the

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:48.390 
kind of see how it ranks up against the

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:06.719 
you'll notice the lanyard hole here it's
kind<00:06:04.810> of<00:06:04.900> big<00:06:05.110> for<00:06:05.350> the<00:06:05.410> knife<00:06:05.590> there<00:06:06.550> you<00:06:06.610> go

00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:06.729 
kind of big for the knife there you go

00:06:06.729 --> 00:06:10.469 
kind of big for the knife there you go
there's<00:06:06.970> a<00:06:07.030> good<00:06:07.180> picture<00:06:07.360> of<00:06:07.540> it<00:06:08.190> and<00:06:09.330> you<00:06:10.330> can

00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:10.479 
there's a good picture of it and you can

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:12.240 
there's a good picture of it and you can
fit<00:06:10.630> 550<00:06:11.229> paracord<00:06:11.470> right<00:06:11.860> through<00:06:12.039> there<00:06:12.160> if

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:12.250 
fit 550 paracord right through there if

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:13.600 
fit 550 paracord right through there if
you<00:06:12.340> wanted<00:06:12.550> to<00:06:12.700> to<00:06:12.820> add<00:06:12.940> a<00:06:12.970> little

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:13.610 
you wanted to to add a little

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:16.510 
you wanted to to add a little
pull<00:06:13.820> tab<00:06:14.030> on<00:06:14.240> that<00:06:14.300> and<00:06:14.990> I<00:06:15.680> think<00:06:16.160> they<00:06:16.370> put

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:16.520 
pull tab on that and I think they put

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:17.710 
pull tab on that and I think they put
off<00:06:16.700> to<00:06:16.820> the<00:06:16.910> edge<00:06:17.030> right<00:06:17.060> there<00:06:17.240> so<00:06:17.480> you<00:06:17.570> could

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:17.720 
off to the edge right there so you could

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.030 
off to the edge right there so you could
put<00:06:17.930> your<00:06:18.020> split<00:06:18.320> ring<00:06:18.470> on<00:06:18.620> it

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:19.040 
put your split ring on it

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.400 
put your split ring on it
with<00:06:19.520> no<00:06:19.730> problem<00:06:20.180> otherwise<00:06:20.960> it<00:06:21.230> would<00:06:21.320> be

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:21.410 
with no problem otherwise it would be

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:22.659 
with no problem otherwise it would be
kind<00:06:21.620> of<00:06:21.710> bogged<00:06:22.010> down<00:06:22.130> in<00:06:22.310> the<00:06:22.370> middle<00:06:22.580> of

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:22.669 
kind of bogged down in the middle of

00:06:22.669 --> 00:06:24.460 
kind of bogged down in the middle of
your<00:06:22.790> keys<00:06:23.090> and<00:06:23.480> that<00:06:23.990> you'd<00:06:24.169> have<00:06:24.320> a<00:06:24.350> hard
