00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
your rhythm earlier this week you found

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.030 
your rhythm earlier this week you found
your<00:00:42.570> rhythm<00:00:42.870> in<00:00:42.960> the<00:00:43.050> first<00:00:43.290> set<00:00:43.500> right<00:00:43.829> away

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
your rhythm in the first set right away

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.799 
your rhythm in the first set right away
from<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.340> beginning<00:00:44.670> I<00:00:44.850> did<00:00:45.149> really<00:00:45.390> play

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
from the beginning I did really play

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.540 
from the beginning I did really play
well<00:00:46.020> so<00:00:46.170> I<00:00:46.289> definitely<00:00:46.829> think<00:00:46.950> that<00:00:47.160> was<00:00:47.399> due

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
well so I definitely think that was due

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.160 
well so I definitely think that was due
to<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.820> tough<00:00:48.000> match<00:00:48.239> I<00:00:48.390> had<00:00:48.539> was<00:00:48.660> Davydenko

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
to the tough match I had was Davydenko

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.750 
to the tough match I had was Davydenko
you<00:00:49.320> know<00:00:49.410> because<00:00:49.770> he<00:00:49.890> did<00:00:50.039> we<00:00:50.399> did<00:00:50.550> it

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
you know because he did we did it

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.130 
you know because he did we did it
gave<00:00:50.910> you<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.120> rhythm<00:00:51.270> yeah<00:00:51.600> we<00:00:51.780> did<00:00:51.930> play<00:00:52.110> a

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
gave you the rhythm yeah we did play a

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.810 
gave you the rhythm yeah we did play a
lot<00:00:52.350> of<00:00:52.379> tough<00:00:52.949> points<00:00:53.309> from<00:00:53.370> the<00:00:53.520> baseline

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
lot of tough points from the baseline

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.520 
lot of tough points from the baseline
and<00:00:54.090> I<00:00:54.180> had<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.510> move<00:00:54.690> a<00:00:54.809> lot<00:00:54.960> left<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:55.379> right

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
and I had to move a lot left and right

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.740 
and I had to move a lot left and right
much<00:00:56.010> more<00:00:56.250> than<00:00:56.460> against<00:00:56.789> their<00:00:57.270> portrait<00:00:57.660> I

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
much more than against their portrait I

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:58.939 
much more than against their portrait I
thought<00:00:57.899> there's<00:00:58.079> much<00:00:58.230> more<00:00:58.410> power<00:00:58.649> but<00:00:58.890> he

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
thought there's much more power but he

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.319 
thought there's much more power but he
needs<00:00:59.129> more<00:00:59.309> time<00:00:59.489> to<00:00:59.550> set<00:00:59.879> the<00:00:59.969> shot<00:01:00.149> up

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
needs more time to set the shot up

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.029 
needs more time to set the shot up
whereas<00:01:00.690> Debbie<00:01:01.350> Langer<00:01:01.559> could<00:01:01.710> really<00:01:01.859> take

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
whereas Debbie Langer could really take

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.160 
whereas Debbie Langer could really take
your<00:01:02.160> time<00:01:02.219> away<00:01:02.670> so<00:01:02.730> I<00:01:03.000> think<00:01:03.149> for<00:01:03.840> me<00:01:03.899> was<00:01:04.140> a

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
your time away so I think for me was a

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.080 
your time away so I think for me was a
great<00:01:04.650> combination<00:01:04.949> played<00:01:05.400> Avianca<00:01:05.880> first

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
great combination played Avianca first

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.690 
great combination played Avianca first
and<00:01:06.270> then<00:01:06.360> del<00:01:06.570> Potro<00:01:06.990> and<00:01:07.200> I<00:01:08.040> think<00:01:08.400> I<00:01:08.460> played

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
and then del Potro and I think I played

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:09.380 
and then del Potro and I think I played
really<00:01:08.880> well<00:01:08.970> today

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
really well today

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:10.940 
really well today
one<00:01:09.930> more<00:01:10.049> team<00:01:10.200> might<00:01:10.409> have<00:01:10.530> missed<00:01:10.710> a<00:01:10.830> little

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
one more team might have missed a little

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.679 
one more team might have missed a little
bit<00:01:11.100> out<00:01:11.250> in<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.430> first<00:01:11.640> set<00:01:11.880> but<00:01:11.909> ii<00:01:12.450> said<00:01:12.600> he

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
bit out in the first set but ii said he

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.390 
bit out in the first set but ii said he
came<00:01:12.840> tough<00:01:13.140> and<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.740> score<00:01:13.979> doesn't<00:01:14.220> show<00:01:14.369> a

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
came tough and the score doesn't show a

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.920 
came tough and the score doesn't show a
toughy<00:01:14.790> was<00:01:14.939> because<00:01:15.299> he<00:01:15.390> should<00:01:15.540> have<00:01:15.630> broken

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
toughy was because he should have broken

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.320 
toughy was because he should have broken
back<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.259> made<00:01:16.740> it<00:01:16.860> a<00:01:16.979> much<00:01:17.310> tougher<00:01:17.490> match<00:01:17.790> ok
