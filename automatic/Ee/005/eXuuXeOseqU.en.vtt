00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.890 
you what is a grow-op and what are the
different<00:00:24.750> crops<00:00:24.960> but<00:00:25.500> just<00:00:26.070> to<00:00:26.420> have<00:00:27.420> an

introductory slide it'll quickly look at

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.030 
introductory slide it'll quickly look at
the<00:00:30.420> different<00:00:30.900> types<00:00:30.960> of<00:00:31.320> crops<00:00:31.619> which<00:00:31.920> are

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
the different types of crops which are

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.120 
the different types of crops which are
cultivated<00:00:32.219> and<00:00:32.759> which<00:00:32.940> we<00:00:33.469> which<00:00:34.469> we<00:00:34.649> use<00:00:34.890> or

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
cultivated and which we which we use or

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.569 
cultivated and which we which we use or
which<00:00:35.280> we<00:00:35.430> consume<00:00:35.850> in<00:00:36.059> our<00:00:36.149> day-to-day<00:00:36.570> life

00:00:37.569 --> 00:00:37.579 
which we consume in our day-to-day life

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:42.650 
which we consume in our day-to-day life
let<00:00:38.579> us<00:00:38.700> talk<00:00:38.969> about<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.899> pulses<00:00:41.600> when<00:00:42.600> you

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
let us talk about the pulses when you

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.200 
let us talk about the pulses when you
think<00:00:42.870> of<00:00:43.020> pulses<00:00:43.530> in<00:00:43.710> India<00:00:44.250> be<00:00:44.399> mostly<00:00:44.760> call

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:45.210 
think of pulses in India be mostly call

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.319 
think of pulses in India be mostly call
it<00:00:45.360> as<00:00:45.510> dally<00:00:45.989> right<00:00:46.920> we<00:00:47.309> generally<00:00:47.760> have<00:00:48.000> it

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
it as dally right we generally have it

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.889 
it as dally right we generally have it
with<00:00:48.840> either<00:00:49.379> rice<00:00:49.620> or<00:00:50.250> with<00:00:50.789> chapati<00:00:51.390> so<00:00:51.809> it

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
with either rice or with chapati so it

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.560 
with either rice or with chapati so it
is<00:00:52.020> a<00:00:52.050> very<00:00:52.230> common<00:00:52.770> or<00:00:53.760> you<00:00:53.940> can<00:00:54.090> say<00:00:54.239> it<00:00:54.390> is<00:00:54.539> a

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
is a very common or you can say it is a

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.110 
is a very common or you can say it is a
daily<00:00:55.260> food<00:00:55.530> for<00:00:55.800> each<00:00:55.920> of<00:00:56.070> us<00:00:56.219> so<00:00:56.789> in<00:00:56.879> pile

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
daily food for each of us so in pile

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.970 
daily food for each of us so in pile
pulses<00:00:57.600> you<00:00:57.719> have<00:00:57.870> many<00:00:58.109> different<00:00:58.530> kinds<00:00:58.739> of

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
pulses you have many different kinds of

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.260 
pulses you have many different kinds of
pulses<00:00:59.399> like<00:00:59.609> gram<00:01:00.329> pea<00:01:01.309> black<00:01:02.309> gram<00:01:02.699> green

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.120 
types of pulses and the pulses are a
very<00:01:07.979> good<00:01:08.070> source<00:01:08.340> of<00:01:08.909> protein<00:01:09.890> so<00:01:10.890> you<00:01:10.950> will

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
of protein in let's talk about the

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.080 
of protein in let's talk about the
cereals<00:01:20.930> which<00:01:21.930> form<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.490> basic<00:01:23.490> food<00:01:23.729> for<00:01:23.970> us

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.399 
day to day life again these cereals are
a<00:02:04.320> very<00:02:04.530> good<00:02:04.890> source<00:02:05.250> of<00:02:05.960> carbohydrates<00:02:06.960> now

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
a very good source of carbohydrates now

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.140 
a very good source of carbohydrates now
as<00:02:07.530> I<00:02:07.590> mentioned<00:02:08.220> before<00:02:08.399> in<00:02:08.789> order<00:02:09.030> to<00:02:09.149> leave

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:10.150 
as I mentioned before in order to leave

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:13.260 
as I mentioned before in order to leave
being<00:02:10.480> our<00:02:10.690> body<00:02:11.020> needs<00:02:11.440> nutrients<00:02:12.370> so<00:02:13.030> it<00:02:13.120> is

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
being our body needs nutrients so it is

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.120 
being our body needs nutrients so it is
not<00:02:13.450> only<00:02:13.480> just<00:02:13.960> one<00:02:14.230> nutrient<00:02:14.800> which<00:02:14.980> it

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
not only just one nutrient which it

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:17.010 
not only just one nutrient which it
needs<00:02:15.340> it<00:02:15.790> needs<00:02:16.000> everything<00:02:16.780> in<00:02:16.930> a

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
needs it needs everything in a

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:19.350 
needs it needs everything in a
combination<00:02:17.650> it<00:02:17.770> needs<00:02:18.010> vitamins<00:02:18.640> minerals

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
combination it needs vitamins minerals

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.230 
combination it needs vitamins minerals
proteins<00:02:20.230> carbohydrates<00:02:20.830> fats<00:02:21.550> everything

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240 
proteins carbohydrates fats everything

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.480 
proteins carbohydrates fats everything
in<00:02:22.420> a<00:02:22.570> correct<00:02:22.870> proportion<00:02:23.500> right<00:02:23.890> so<00:02:24.370> it<00:02:24.460> is

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
in a correct proportion right so it is

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.490 
in a correct proportion right so it is
not<00:02:24.760> that<00:02:24.940> you<00:02:25.000> keep<00:02:25.330> consuming<00:02:25.870> only<00:02:26.320> rice

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
not that you keep consuming only rice

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:28.290 
not that you keep consuming only rice
and<00:02:26.830> you<00:02:26.920> think<00:02:27.190> that<00:02:27.370> only<00:02:27.640> by<00:02:27.940> consuming

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:28.300 
and you think that only by consuming

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.090 
and you think that only by consuming
carbohydrates<00:02:28.660> anything<00:02:29.410> else<00:02:29.620> that<00:02:29.920> is<00:02:30.070> not

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 
carbohydrates anything else that is not

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.660 
carbohydrates anything else that is not
possible

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
possible

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.630 
possible
so<00:02:31.120> our<00:02:31.300> diet<00:02:32.200> should<00:02:32.530> have<00:02:32.710> a<00:02:32.740> combination<00:02:33.160> of

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
so our diet should have a combination of

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.120 
so our diet should have a combination of
everything<00:02:34.200> next<00:02:35.200> if<00:02:35.320> we<00:02:35.350> talk<00:02:35.680> about<00:02:35.830> the<00:02:36.100> oil

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
everything next if we talk about the oil

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.120 
everything next if we talk about the oil
seeds<00:02:36.760> the<00:02:37.060> seeds<00:02:37.240> which<00:02:37.600> can<00:02:37.930> generate<00:02:38.590> oil

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
seeds the seeds which can generate oil

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.330 
seeds the seeds which can generate oil
for<00:02:39.460> example<00:02:39.550> groundnut<00:02:40.480> castor<00:02:41.230> soya<00:02:41.950> bean

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
for example groundnut castor soya bean

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.450 
for example groundnut castor soya bean
see<00:02:43.030> same<00:02:43.410> linseed<00:02:44.410> so<00:02:44.830> you<00:02:45.040> would<00:02:45.160> have<00:02:45.220> heard

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:45.460 
see same linseed so you would have heard

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.460 
see same linseed so you would have heard
of<00:02:45.640> this<00:02:45.910> oil<00:02:46.120> also<00:02:46.390> the<00:02:46.600> sunflower<00:02:47.080> oils

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
of this oil also the sunflower oils

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:49.200 
of this oil also the sunflower oils
which<00:02:47.620> are<00:02:47.710> available<00:02:47.830> in<00:02:48.250> the<00:02:48.310> market<00:02:48.790> they

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:49.210 
which are available in the market they

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:51.120 
which are available in the market they
are<00:02:49.240> also<00:02:49.540> obtained<00:02:50.020> from<00:02:50.170> these<00:02:50.410> oil<00:02:50.560> seeds

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
are also obtained from these oil seeds

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:52.890 
are also obtained from these oil seeds
similarly<00:02:51.880> you<00:02:52.030> would<00:02:52.150> have<00:02:52.240> heard<00:02:52.540> of<00:02:52.720> this

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:52.900 
similarly you would have heard of this

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:55.680 
similarly you would have heard of this
castor<00:02:53.440> oil<00:02:53.470> castor<00:02:53.950> oil<00:02:54.160> often<00:02:54.490> some<00:02:55.360> people

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
castor oil castor oil often some people

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:57.300 
castor oil castor oil often some people
often<00:02:55.840> put<00:02:56.080> it<00:02:56.260> on<00:02:56.380> here<00:02:56.620> because<00:02:56.800> they<00:02:57.160> say

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
often put it on here because they say

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.060 
often put it on here because they say
that<00:02:57.340> castor<00:02:58.210> oil<00:02:58.270> will<00:02:58.510> help<00:02:58.540> in<00:02:58.810> hair<00:02:59.020> growth

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
that castor oil will help in hair growth

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:02.700 
that castor oil will help in hair growth
right<00:03:00.070> similarly<00:03:00.970> you<00:03:01.330> have<00:03:01.360> soya<00:03:01.780> beans<00:03:02.230> so<00:03:02.680> a

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:02.710 
right similarly you have soya beans so a

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:06.540 
right similarly you have soya beans so a
beans<00:03:03.070> they<00:03:04.110> help<00:03:05.110> in<00:03:05.410> getting<00:03:05.710> Nemec<00:03:06.310> from

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
beans they help in getting Nemec from

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:09.180 
beans they help in getting Nemec from
soya<00:03:06.760> beans<00:03:07.090> you<00:03:07.240> not<00:03:07.540> only<00:03:07.750> get<00:03:07.960> so<00:03:08.380> our<00:03:08.620> oil

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
soya beans you not only get so our oil

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.720 
soya beans you not only get so our oil
but<00:03:09.820> you<00:03:09.940> also<00:03:10.150> get<00:03:10.920> things<00:03:11.920> like<00:03:12.130> soya<00:03:12.370> sauce

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
but you also get things like soya sauce

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.120 
but you also get things like soya sauce
soya<00:03:13.360> chunks<00:03:13.540> there<00:03:14.470> are<00:03:14.590> so<00:03:14.740> many<00:03:14.860> things

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 
soya chunks there are so many things

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:16.890 
soya chunks there are so many things
which<00:03:15.340> you<00:03:15.370> actually<00:03:15.640> obtain<00:03:15.970> from<00:03:16.330> soya<00:03:16.660> bean

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
which you actually obtain from soya bean

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.550 
which you actually obtain from soya bean
and<00:03:17.520> these<00:03:18.520> oil<00:03:18.850> seeds<00:03:19.270> are<00:03:19.600> also<00:03:19.930> a<00:03:20.200> good

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
and these oil seeds are also a good

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.800 
and these oil seeds are also a good
source<00:03:20.830> of<00:03:21.070> fats<00:03:22.020> right<00:03:23.020> okay<00:03:24.150> then<00:03:25.150> we<00:03:25.360> have<00:03:25.570> a

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
source of fats right okay then we have a

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.080 
source of fats right okay then we have a
variety<00:03:25.990> of<00:03:26.440> vegetables<00:03:26.770> you<00:03:27.640> have<00:03:27.670> green

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
variety of vegetables you have green

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.020 
variety of vegetables you have green
vegetables<00:03:28.750> you<00:03:28.870> have<00:03:28.990> colored<00:03:29.320> vegetables

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:30.030 
vegetables you have colored vegetables

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.120 
vegetables you have colored vegetables
like<00:03:31.030> and<00:03:31.300> they<00:03:31.450> are<00:03:31.690> all<00:03:31.959> a<00:03:32.200> very<00:03:32.500> good<00:03:32.830> source

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
like and they are all a very good source

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.030 
like and they are all a very good source
of<00:03:33.310> vitamins<00:03:33.940> and<00:03:34.090> minerals<00:03:34.510> and<00:03:34.959> of<00:03:35.770> course

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
of vitamins and minerals and of course

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.729 
of vitamins and minerals and of course
we<00:03:36.220> have<00:03:36.400> fruits<00:03:36.900> which<00:03:37.900> are<00:03:38.050> again<00:03:38.350> a<00:03:38.530> good

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
we have fruits which are again a good

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:41.910 
we have fruits which are again a good
source<00:03:38.980> of<00:03:39.160> vitamins<00:03:39.910> and<00:03:40.090> minerals<00:03:40.890> so<00:03:41.890> a

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 
source of vitamins and minerals so a

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.340 
source of vitamins and minerals so a
diet<00:03:42.310> which<00:03:42.640> has<00:03:42.670> a<00:03:42.910> combination<00:03:43.570> of<00:03:43.810> all<00:03:44.020> of

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.350 
diet which has a combination of all of

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:46.920 
diet which has a combination of all of
this<00:03:44.590> is<00:03:44.980> said<00:03:45.310> to<00:03:45.489> be<00:03:45.640> a<00:03:45.670> good<00:03:46.030> guide<00:03:46.300> which

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
this is said to be a good guide which

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.590 
this is said to be a good guide which

can keep you healthy right so these are

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:56.510 
can keep you healthy right so these are
the<00:03:52.600> crops<00:03:52.900> which<00:03:53.440> are<00:03:54.000> cultivated<00:03:55.000> in<00:03:55.570> fees

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:56.520 
the crops which are cultivated in fees

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.910 
the crops which are cultivated in fees
right<00:03:57.520> so<00:03:58.330> now<00:03:58.480> what<00:03:58.959> are<00:03:59.110> we<00:03:59.230> going<00:03:59.440> to<00:03:59.680> study

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
right so now what are we going to study

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.750 
right so now what are we going to study
is<00:04:00.280> how<00:04:00.880> can<00:04:01.180> we<00:04:01.209> improve<00:04:01.870> the<00:04:02.590> yield<00:04:03.160> of<00:04:03.489> these

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:03.760 
is how can we improve the yield of these

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.880 
is how can we improve the yield of these
crops<00:04:04.060> how<00:04:04.300> can<00:04:04.570> we<00:04:04.780> improve<00:04:05.200> the<00:04:05.500> production

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:05.890 
crops how can we improve the production

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:12.300 
crops how can we improve the production
of<00:04:06.310> these<00:04:06.820> crops<00:04:07.200> now<00:04:08.310> how<00:04:09.310> is<00:04:10.739> how<00:04:11.739> do<00:04:11.800> we<00:04:12.100> know

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:12.310 
of these crops now how is how do we know

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:16.680 
of these crops now how is how do we know
that<00:04:12.970> I<00:04:13.270> mean<00:04:13.840> what<00:04:14.380> is<00:04:14.530> the<00:04:14.650> basic<00:04:15.690> concept

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 
that I mean what is the basic concept

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:20.430 
that I mean what is the basic concept
behind<00:04:17.560> this<00:04:18.479> improvement<00:04:19.479> in<00:04:19.810> crop<00:04:20.080> yields

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:20.440 
behind this improvement in crop yields

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:22.110 
behind this improvement in crop yields
now<00:04:20.799> since<00:04:21.220> we<00:04:21.400> have<00:04:21.430> aware

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:22.120 
now since we have aware

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.300 
now since we have aware
of<00:04:22.389> crops<00:04:22.690> which<00:04:23.020> are<00:04:23.169> being<00:04:23.380> cultivated<00:04:23.560> and

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
of crops which are being cultivated and

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:26.610 
of crops which are being cultivated and
we<00:04:24.820> it<00:04:25.000> is<00:04:25.120> observed<00:04:25.540> that<00:04:25.720> different<00:04:26.229> crops

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
we it is observed that different crops

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.960 
we it is observed that different crops
need<00:04:27.600> different<00:04:28.600> climatic<00:04:29.290> conditions<00:04:30.040> they

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
need different climatic conditions they

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.969 
need different climatic conditions they
need<00:04:31.000> different<00:04:31.660> temperature<00:04:32.260> they<00:04:32.710> need

00:04:32.969 --> 00:04:32.979 
need different temperature they need

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:35.520 
need different temperature they need
different<00:04:33.639> photo<00:04:33.970> periods<00:04:34.570> for<00:04:35.080> their<00:04:35.260> growth

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
different photo periods for their growth

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:38.129 
different photo periods for their growth
for<00:04:36.400> example<00:04:36.880> this<00:04:37.030> one<00:04:37.330> I<00:04:37.479> talked<00:04:37.720> about<00:04:37.840> so

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:38.139 
for example this one I talked about so

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:40.140 
for example this one I talked about so
many<00:04:38.260> crops<00:04:38.590> right<00:04:38.889> in<00:04:39.070> the<00:04:39.160> last<00:04:39.370> slide<00:04:39.669> but

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
many crops right in the last slide but

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.240 
many crops right in the last slide but
it<00:04:40.389> doesn't<00:04:40.690> mean<00:04:40.870> that<00:04:40.900> all<00:04:41.440> of<00:04:41.470> them<00:04:41.889> needs

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.250 
it doesn't mean that all of them needs

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.400 
it doesn't mean that all of them needs
the<00:04:42.520> similar<00:04:42.910> kind<00:04:43.090> of<00:04:43.330> environment<00:04:43.990> for

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:44.410 
the similar kind of environment for

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:46.950 
the similar kind of environment for
their<00:04:44.620> growth<00:04:44.889> for<00:04:45.790> example<00:04:45.850> if<00:04:46.419> you<00:04:46.780> take

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:46.960 
their growth for example if you take

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.020 
their growth for example if you take
wheat<00:04:47.290> wheat<00:04:48.040> might<00:04:48.310> have<00:04:48.639> its<00:04:48.880> own

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:49.030 
wheat wheat might have its own

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:50.850 
wheat wheat might have its own
requirements<00:04:49.360> it<00:04:49.840> needs<00:04:50.050> a<00:04:50.199> specific<00:04:50.410> type<00:04:50.830> of

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:50.860 
requirements it needs a specific type of

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:53.070 
requirements it needs a specific type of
a<00:04:51.040> climate<00:04:51.310> it<00:04:51.880> needs<00:04:52.180> a<00:04:52.449> specific<00:04:52.900> type<00:04:53.050> of

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:53.080 
a climate it needs a specific type of

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.290 
a climate it needs a specific type of
temperature<00:04:53.680> for<00:04:54.100> its<00:04:54.250> growth<00:04:54.520> whereas<00:04:55.180> if

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:55.300 
temperature for its growth whereas if

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.600 
temperature for its growth whereas if
you<00:04:55.419> take<00:04:55.990> the<00:04:56.139> example<00:04:56.199> of<00:04:56.740> a<00:04:56.979> say<00:04:57.250> cotton

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:57.610 
you take the example of a say cotton

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:59.610 
you take the example of a say cotton
maybe<00:04:58.180> cotton<00:04:58.630> needs<00:04:58.840> a<00:04:59.080> completely

00:04:59.610 --> 00:04:59.620 
maybe cotton needs a completely

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:01.620 
maybe cotton needs a completely
different<00:04:59.770> environment<00:05:00.190> all<00:05:00.669> together<00:05:00.880> so

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:01.630 
different environment all together so

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:04.020 
different environment all together so
each<00:05:01.900> crop<00:05:02.289> will<00:05:02.650> need<00:05:03.070> a<00:05:03.280> different<00:05:03.550> type<00:05:03.850> of

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:04.030 
each crop will need a different type of

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:05.879 
each crop will need a different type of
climate<00:05:04.510> a<00:05:04.630> different<00:05:05.020> type<00:05:05.139> of<00:05:05.169> temperature

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:05.889 
climate a different type of temperature

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:08.340 
climate a different type of temperature
a<00:05:06.070> different<00:05:06.729> type<00:05:06.970> of<00:05:07.000> sunlight<00:05:07.690> duration

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:08.350 
a different type of sunlight duration

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:11.010 
a different type of sunlight duration
sunlight<00:05:09.250> duration<00:05:09.699> means<00:05:09.880> the<00:05:10.330> amount<00:05:10.720> of

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020 
sunlight duration means the amount of

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:14.040 
sunlight duration means the amount of
time<00:05:11.560> or<00:05:11.889> the<00:05:12.820> period<00:05:13.120> of<00:05:13.240> time<00:05:13.419> for<00:05:13.720> which<00:05:13.870> it

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:14.050 
time or the period of time for which it

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:16.170 
time or the period of time for which it
needs<00:05:14.229> exposure<00:05:14.770> to<00:05:15.010> sunlight<00:05:15.220> sunlight<00:05:15.820> is

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:16.180 
needs exposure to sunlight sunlight is

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:17.670 
needs exposure to sunlight sunlight is
very<00:05:16.389> very<00:05:16.570> important<00:05:17.020> for<00:05:17.139> plants<00:05:17.530> right

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 
very very important for plants right

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.560 
very very important for plants right
because<00:05:18.430> it<00:05:18.729> is<00:05:18.910> in<00:05:19.030> the<00:05:19.120> presence<00:05:19.479> of

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:19.570 
because it is in the presence of

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:21.810 
because it is in the presence of
sunlight<00:05:19.810> that<00:05:20.320> plants<00:05:21.190> prepare<00:05:21.580> their<00:05:21.789> food

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:21.820 
sunlight that plants prepare their food

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:24.840 
sunlight that plants prepare their food
by<00:05:22.389> the<00:05:22.449> process<00:05:22.990> called<00:05:23.169> photosynthesis<00:05:24.039> so

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:24.850 
by the process called photosynthesis so

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:27.240 
by the process called photosynthesis so
all<00:05:25.180> these<00:05:25.479> requirements<00:05:25.900> vary<00:05:26.770> with<00:05:27.070> each

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.250 
all these requirements vary with each

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:30.300 
all these requirements vary with each
crop<00:05:27.700> so<00:05:28.539> there<00:05:28.960> are<00:05:29.169> some<00:05:29.440> crops<00:05:29.770> which<00:05:30.039> grow

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:30.310 
crop so there are some crops which grow

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:33.589 
crop so there are some crops which grow
only<00:05:30.520> in<00:05:30.669> rainy<00:05:31.120> season<00:05:31.210> for<00:05:32.169> example<00:05:32.550> maize

00:05:33.589 --> 00:05:33.599 
only in rainy season for example maize

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:36.060 
only in rainy season for example maize
cotton<00:05:34.599> these<00:05:35.020> are<00:05:35.169> some<00:05:35.320> of<00:05:35.380> the<00:05:35.440> examples<00:05:35.979> of

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:36.070 
cotton these are some of the examples of

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:37.740 
cotton these are some of the examples of
crops<00:05:36.340> which<00:05:36.580> grow<00:05:36.820> only<00:05:36.940> in<00:05:37.120> rainy<00:05:37.360> season

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:37.750 
crops which grow only in rainy season

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:40.490 
crops which grow only in rainy season
because<00:05:38.110> these<00:05:38.800> crops<00:05:39.160> wants<00:05:39.669> more<00:05:40.090> water

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:40.500 
because these crops wants more water

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:41.700 
because these crops wants more water
correct

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:41.710 
correct

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:43.800 
correct
similarly<00:05:42.520> there<00:05:42.729> are<00:05:42.760> other<00:05:43.000> crops<00:05:43.570> which

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:43.810 
similarly there are other crops which

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:45.629 
similarly there are other crops which
grow<00:05:44.050> in<00:05:44.080> winter<00:05:44.620> season<00:05:44.770> they<00:05:45.099> don't<00:05:45.430> need

00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:45.639 
grow in winter season they don't need

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:47.460 
grow in winter season they don't need
too<00:05:45.880> much<00:05:46.060> of<00:05:46.120> water<00:05:46.450> but<00:05:46.840> they<00:05:46.990> want<00:05:47.229> the

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:47.470 
too much of water but they want the

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:49.260 
too much of water but they want the
climate<00:05:47.919> to<00:05:48.310> be<00:05:48.400> cold<00:05:48.669> they<00:05:48.910> want<00:05:49.120> the

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:49.270 
climate to be cold they want the

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:52.560 
climate to be cold they want the
temperature<00:05:49.450> to<00:05:49.870> be<00:05:50.139> less<00:05:50.860> so<00:05:51.820> examples<00:05:52.510> of

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:52.570 
temperature to be less so examples of

such<00:05:52.810> crops<00:05:53.110> are<00:05:53.410> wheat<00:05:53.979> gram<00:05:54.669> mustard

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:55.410 
such crops are wheat gram mustard

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:57.960 
such crops are wheat gram mustard
linseed<00:05:56.410> these<00:05:56.949> are<00:05:57.130> some<00:05:57.250> of<00:05:57.370> the<00:05:57.490> examples

linseed these are some of the examples

00:05:57.970 --> 00:05:59.909 
linseed these are some of the examples
of<00:05:58.030> crops<00:05:58.300> which<00:05:58.570> draw<00:05:58.840> only<00:05:59.080> in<00:05:59.380> winter

00:05:59.909 --> 00:05:59.919 
of crops which draw only in winter

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:02.400 
of crops which draw only in winter
season<00:06:00.400> so<00:06:00.520> now<00:06:01.030> because<00:06:01.479> of<00:06:01.690> this<00:06:01.840> different

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:02.410 
season so now because of this different

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:06.089 
season so now because of this different
requirements<00:06:03.280> of<00:06:03.400> the<00:06:04.030> different<00:06:04.720> crops<00:06:05.099> we

requirements of the different crops we

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:08.310 
requirements of the different crops we
have<00:06:06.340> been<00:06:06.580> able<00:06:06.820> to<00:06:07.030> come<00:06:07.240> up<00:06:07.389> with<00:06:07.810> some

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:08.320 
have been able to come up with some

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.469 
have been able to come up with some
techniques<00:06:08.830> which<00:06:09.310> can<00:06:09.340> improve<00:06:09.910> the<00:06:10.240> yield

00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:10.479

techniques which can improve the yield
of<00:06:10.720> the<00:06:10.930> crop<00:06:11.789> so<00:06:12.789> what<00:06:13.000> are<00:06:13.150> those<00:06:13.240> techniques

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:13.690 
of the crop so what are those techniques

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:16.409 
of the crop so what are those techniques
the<00:06:14.440> first<00:06:14.710> one<00:06:14.919> is<00:06:15.070> crop<00:06:15.669> variety

00:06:16.409 --> 00:06:16.419 
the first one is crop variety

00:06:16.419 --> 00:06:20.159 
the first one is crop variety
improvement<00:06:17.400> next<00:06:18.400> is<00:06:18.580> crop<00:06:19.360> production

00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:20.169 
improvement next is crop production

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:23.159 
improvement next is crop production
improvement<00:06:20.770> and<00:06:20.979> the<00:06:21.789> last<00:06:22.000> one<00:06:22.330> is<00:06:22.510> crop

00:06:23.159 --> 00:06:23.169 
improvement and the last one is crop

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:25.710 
improvement and the last one is crop
protection<00:06:23.500> improvement<00:06:24.430> so<00:06:24.910> these<00:06:25.120> are<00:06:25.449> the

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:25.720 
protection improvement so these are the

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:27.990 
protection improvement so these are the
three<00:06:25.990> techniques<00:06:26.590> which<00:06:26.919> we<00:06:27.099> will<00:06:27.280> discuss

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:28.000 
three techniques which we will discuss

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.870 
three techniques which we will discuss
in<00:06:28.180> this<00:06:28.750> lesson<00:06:29.020> and<00:06:29.410> which<00:06:30.130> are<00:06:30.310> helpful<00:06:30.669> in

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:30.880 
in this lesson and which are helpful in

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:34.080 
in this lesson and which are helpful in
improving<00:06:31.570> the<00:06:31.750> yield<00:06:32.050> of<00:06:32.260> crops<00:06:32.700> so<00:06:33.700> we<00:06:33.849> will

00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:34.090 
improving the yield of crops so we will

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:35.420 
improving the yield of crops so we will
talk<00:06:34.300> about<00:06:34.630> each<00:06:34.900> of<00:06:35.110> them

00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:35.430 
talk about each of them

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:37.430 
talk about each of them
in<00:06:35.490> detail<00:06:35.730> one<00:06:36.090> by<00:06:36.270> one<00:06:36.450> but<00:06:36.660> just<00:06:37.020> a<00:06:37.260> quick

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:37.440 
in detail one by one but just a quick

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:39.890 
in detail one by one but just a quick
one<00:06:38.010> liner<00:06:38.040> discretion<00:06:38.850> on<00:06:38.940> each<00:06:39.090> of<00:06:39.270> them<00:06:39.450> so

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:39.900 
one liner discretion on each of them so

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:41.960 
one liner discretion on each of them so
when<00:06:40.050> I<00:06:40.140> talk<00:06:40.290> of<00:06:40.410> crop<00:06:40.800> variety<00:06:41.430> improvement

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:41.970 
when I talk of crop variety improvement

00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:44.180 
when I talk of crop variety improvement
what<00:06:42.540> do<00:06:42.660> we<00:06:42.780> do<00:06:42.930> here<00:06:43.170> we<00:06:43.380> actually<00:06:43.530> improve

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:44.190 
what do we do here we actually improve

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:46.070 
what do we do here we actually improve
the<00:06:44.550> variety<00:06:45.030> of<00:06:45.060> the<00:06:45.330> crop<00:06:45.510> that<00:06:45.540> means<00:06:45.900> we

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:46.080 
the variety of the crop that means we

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.140 
the variety of the crop that means we
actually<00:06:46.260> improve<00:06:46.920> the<00:06:47.130> quality<00:06:47.430> of<00:06:47.820> the<00:06:47.970> crop

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:48.150 
actually improve the quality of the crop

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:52.160 
actually improve the quality of the crop
so<00:06:48.690> that<00:06:49.400> the<00:06:50.400> outcome<00:06:51.240> which<00:06:51.390> we<00:06:51.570> get<00:06:51.750> or<00:06:51.960> so

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:52.170 
so that the outcome which we get or so

00:06:52.170 --> 00:06:54.110 
so that the outcome which we get or so
that<00:06:52.320> the<00:06:52.560> result<00:06:52.890> which<00:06:53.130> we<00:06:53.310> get<00:06:53.490> is<00:06:53.700> of<00:06:53.910> good

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:54.120 
that the result which we get is of good

00:06:54.120 --> 00:06:56.930 
that the result which we get is of good
quality<00:06:54.180> in<00:06:55.020> crop<00:06:55.680> production<00:06:55.940> improvement

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:56.940 
quality in crop production improvement

00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:00.560 
quality in crop production improvement
we<00:06:57.450> focus<00:06:57.900> on<00:06:58.170> the<00:06:58.980> amount<00:06:59.760> of<00:06:59.940> crop<00:07:00.240> which<00:07:00.540> is

00:07:00.560 --> 00:07:00.570 
we focus on the amount of crop which is

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:03.350 
we focus on the amount of crop which is
getting<00:07:00.930> generated<00:07:01.100> so<00:07:02.100> we<00:07:02.310> ensure<00:07:02.790> that<00:07:02.820> more

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:03.360 
getting generated so we ensure that more

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:06.020 
getting generated so we ensure that more
and<00:07:03.600> more<00:07:03.690> crops<00:07:04.230> get<00:07:04.530> produced<00:07:05.280> so<00:07:05.670> for<00:07:05.850> that

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:06.030 
and more crops get produced so for that

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:10.340 
and more crops get produced so for that
we<00:07:07.040> apply<00:07:08.040> some<00:07:08.100> techniques<00:07:08.640> again<00:07:09.060> in<00:07:09.570> crop

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:10.350 
we apply some techniques again in crop

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:12.440 
we apply some techniques again in crop
protection<00:07:10.620> management<00:07:11.550> we<00:07:11.670> ensure<00:07:12.090> that<00:07:12.120> the

00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:12.450 
protection management we ensure that the

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:15.320 
protection management we ensure that the
crops<00:07:12.780> stay<00:07:13.230> protected<00:07:13.530> nobody<00:07:14.520> or<00:07:14.970> no

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:15.330 
crops stay protected nobody or no

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:17.690 
crops stay protected nobody or no
outsiders<00:07:15.960> should<00:07:15.990> come<00:07:16.470> and<00:07:16.740> harm<00:07:17.070> the<00:07:17.280> crops

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:17.700 
outsiders should come and harm the crops

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:19.610 
outsiders should come and harm the crops
because<00:07:18.150> if<00:07:18.450> somebody<00:07:18.780> harms<00:07:19.140> the<00:07:19.290> crop<00:07:19.470> again

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:19.620 
because if somebody harms the crop again

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:22.610 
because if somebody harms the crop again
that<00:07:19.920> will<00:07:20.070> affect<00:07:20.400> them<00:07:20.610> crop<00:07:21.420> yield<00:07:22.110> right

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:22.620 
that will affect them crop yield right

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:24.590 
that will affect them crop yield right
so<00:07:23.160> here<00:07:23.370> we<00:07:23.580> will<00:07:23.700> take<00:07:23.850> care<00:07:24.060> of<00:07:24.180> the<00:07:24.300> crop

00:07:24.590 --> 00:07:24.600 
so here we will take care of the crop

00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:28.000 
so here we will take care of the crop
