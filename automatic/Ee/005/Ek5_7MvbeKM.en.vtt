00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:12.270
 Teacher Dynep 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:18.430
 Do you like What brand is all'm spinner Hello z 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.790
 North 

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:28.240
 Salvation 1 of Gucci Uro 

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:30.160
 No loan loan right brain Bulgaronona Onoji My favorite brand is already Chung 

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:37.720
 carbon 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:39.040
 Hey today, use this carbon cloth to put carbon on the previous carbon card 

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:43.780
 I think that want to go 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:47.769
 By the way is this time the carbon 1m over 1 meter I was prepared 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:50.150
 4 is a student I ne ultra-cheap ultra-cheap 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:54.920
 So this time me immediately or lock 

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:58.720
 Oh This is the carbon sheet that is attached now this gritty Gane 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:01.050
 I don't like Anma, so I will recover the carbon canard at first . 

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:06.800
 Hey hey 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.800
 It will stripped carbon seal so off from the main body 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:23.800
 I 'm going to go to Pain minutes Yes, I'm ready to put the base for frp. 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:27.000
 Primer spray to improve adhesion with this 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.000
 I will blow this 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:37.610
 Once the privateer is dry, I will make the ground with black spray next 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.610
 Is not so beautiful at the base is stretched a bright and carbon 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:44.710
 Next I will prepare this carbon cloth This is using carbon of type 3 knitting 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:50.320
 The size is 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:52.030
 It is such feeling when compared with a finger well It is a rather thin person A hair like this before writing a book 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.860
 In Oh by the letter 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.860
 Let's do your size 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.160
 Let's cut the circumference with masking tape 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:12.300
 Yes, this completes cutting out the carbon cloth 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:17.700
 If you 're done cutting out the carbon, then here's the pc 74 

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:25.160
 And the permec n of this hardener is the mixing ratio is 100 to 1 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:25.160
 This resin is hella good either and when you use the Goi live it is high transparency carbon ne 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:33.920
 So we will mix mix 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.920
 Because it is the first adhesive grade, such a charge is not necessary 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:40.920
 Parekku n 100 was 1 rule of thumb in roughly 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:43.220
 Let's say a little bit I think it's too home 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.990
 We will mix 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.990
 From here you come to the game with time 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.970
 Masu wrong Tei 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:56.910
 2 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:59.430
 The tool you're done you can still reuse Wash clean with this ascent carbon 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:03.350
 Painted when the following was cut earlier 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.350
 I will put on a carbon cloth 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:12.249
 From above 

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:12.249
 I'm putting on Saran rap, this is bullying me 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:21.600
 A good time with a roller that pulls out this air bubble after being wrapped 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:26.880
 Become 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:33.060
 Then use the oil clay in the direction so easy to wear and have pretty Toka curve or 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:37.410
 Gras year half is convenient to use the way is because it can be used again and again i say 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:41.220
 You can push the oil clay where you don't want to go 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:45.030
 Yes this won't make this curve come up 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:51.290
 ok wait in this state exercise one 9-8 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:51.290
 So good was this was solidified will continue to crawl the around here 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:04:02.040
 Now When you have finished remove the firmly fixed and has Saran Wrap is going to wound this inside of 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:06.020
 Fasten with partner pasking tape 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.020
 It would be nice to cut too long 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:20.870
 I was stuck in such a feeling 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:26.240
 Here is the part I can not see 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:28.639
 The surface which I did with saran wrap is debossed, but because it cuts off how it is this way from above 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:33.729
 I will apply clear resin again 

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:33.729
 About surplus I think you kinda put on the amount larger amount from the second time 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:53.180
 There is a trick after painting this clear file such as 100 average carbon that spans this 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:53.180
 Mai Tai case will please And then Truly surface management stretched it 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:02.960
 This This pair of fall I error legislators quite so open gate has become flat is easier later task in 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:08.509
 It will be 

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:16.690
 Next, if the resin cures completely and if you try to apply the resin from above , you will not get along well 

00:05:08.509 --> 00:05:16.690
 Because there is, while painting the surface with the paper 600, it paints the next resin again 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:28.290
 I finished polishing with paper and now the surface is quite flat 

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:28.290
 I think that I want to paint resin about 12 times more 

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:36.589
 Yes this is 

00:05:31.849 --> 00:05:43.219
 It is a type after scraping If you paint and harden the resin 

00:05:36.589 --> 00:05:48.729
 I will finish the paper until the war and finally finally I will not enter this needle 

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:48.729
 Advertising car tax from now on such a place 

00:05:55.409 --> 00:06:04.600
 After taking some burrs and putting on a paper fleet 

00:05:59.219 --> 00:06:08.590
 Let's clean up Holtz's poem using reason bar 

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:14.410
 Because it blows clear from now To make the paint easy to get on 

00:06:08.590 --> 00:06:15.220
 Properly is Mars sleeves What is important to let's take the oil and this is multiplied by the rasp 

00:06:14.410 --> 00:06:19.600
 It is a state 

00:06:15.220 --> 00:06:22.650
 If it is clear that it has been scraped properly, it will be in May , so I'm going to blow clear 

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.650
