only 2 point 5 kilos more just to be

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.740 
only 2 point 5 kilos more just to be
safe<00:01:37.079> and<00:01:38.070> I<00:01:38.280> think<00:01:38.490> I<00:01:38.549> picked<00:01:38.790> exactly<00:01:39.479> right

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.560 
safe and I think I picked exactly right
because<00:01:40.079> this<00:01:40.259> was<00:01:40.470> a<00:01:40.500> big<00:01:40.590> grind<00:01:41.240> at<00:01:42.240> no<00:01:42.420> point

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.450 
because this was a big grind at no point
that<00:01:42.750> I<00:01:42.780> think<00:01:42.869> I<00:01:43.049> was<00:01:43.170> gonna<00:01:43.259> miss<00:01:43.560> but<00:01:44.009> it<00:01:44.369> was

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
that I think I was gonna miss but it was

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.639 
that I think I was gonna miss but it was

command and

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.080 
command and
I<00:04:16.560> feel<00:04:17.040> like<00:04:17.130> this<00:04:17.250> should<00:04:17.400> have<00:04:17.459> counted<00:04:17.880> but

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
I feel like this should have counted but

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.479 
I feel like this should have counted but
that's<00:04:18.450> crap<00:04:18.750> man<00:04:18.780> that<00:04:19.530> first<00:04:19.769> attempt<00:04:20.190> look

00:04:20.479 --> 00:04:20.489 
that's crap man that first attempt look

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:21.890 
that's crap man that first attempt look
like<00:04:20.670> he<00:04:20.790> gave<00:04:20.880> to<00:04:21.030> down<00:04:21.209> command<00:04:21.570> you<00:04:21.660> dropped

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:21.900 
like he gave to down command you dropped

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:22.700 
like he gave to down command you dropped
it<00:04:22.019> looks<00:04:22.170> like<00:04:22.290> it<00:04:22.380> should<00:04:22.410> have<00:04:22.530> counted

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 
it looks like it should have counted

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.600 
it looks like it should have counted
yeah<00:04:23.280> but<00:04:23.520> to<00:04:23.760> be<00:04:23.850> honest<00:04:24.210> like<00:04:25.340> 7:33<00:04:26.340> that's

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
yeah but to be honest like 7:33 that's

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:27.920 
yeah but to be honest like 7:33 that's
not<00:04:26.820> enough<00:04:27.060> anyway

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 
not enough anyway

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:29.720 
not enough anyway

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:29.730 
760 is what I would have needed to break

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:31.730 
760 is what I would have needed to break
two<00:04:29.880> thousand<00:04:30.330> right<00:04:30.750> which<00:04:31.050> I<00:04:31.170> have<00:04:31.350> in<00:04:31.530> me
