if we could make a trailer for the

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.439 
if we could make a trailer for the
Durham<00:00:25.439> boats<00:00:25.680> the<00:00:26.369> Durham<00:00:26.699> boats<00:00:26.910> are<00:00:27.240> the

when Washington crossed the Delaware to

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.510 
when Washington crossed the Delaware to
defeat<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.780> British<00:00:37.110> so<00:00:37.920> we're<00:00:38.070> happy<00:00:38.250> to<00:00:38.430> be

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:38.520 
defeat the British so we're happy to be

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.569 
defeat the British so we're happy to be
involved<00:00:38.760> in<00:00:39.000> that<00:00:39.120> project<00:00:39.860> and<00:00:40.860> do<00:00:41.340> anything

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
involved in that project and do anything

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.639 
involved in that project and do anything
that<00:00:41.730> we<00:00:41.820> can<00:00:42.000> for<00:00:42.300> the<00:00:42.480> for<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:42.899> cause<00:00:43.110> so

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
that we can for the for the cause so

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.590 
that we can for the for the cause so
basically<00:00:44.100> what<00:00:44.309> we<00:00:44.460> did<00:00:44.489> is<00:00:44.670> we<00:00:45.180> went<00:00:45.300> out<00:00:45.450> to

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
basically what we did is we went out to

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.779 
basically what we did is we went out to
the<00:00:45.690> site<00:00:45.960> to<00:00:46.739> watching<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.219> crossing<00:00:47.579> site

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
the site to watching the crossing site

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.940 
the site to watching the crossing site
we<00:00:48.030> looked<00:00:48.539> at<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.780> boats<00:00:49.020> took<00:00:49.649> all<00:00:49.829> the

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
we looked at the boats took all the

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.100 
we looked at the boats took all the
measurements<00:00:50.399> off<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:50.670> boats<00:00:50.879> so<00:00:51.870> that<00:00:51.899> we

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
measurements off the boats so that we

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.470 
measurements off the boats so that we
have<00:00:52.289> all<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.309> pertinent<00:00:53.520> information

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
have all the pertinent information

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.650 
have all the pertinent information
design<00:00:55.070> then<00:00:56.070> we<00:00:56.160> come<00:00:56.309> back<00:00:56.340> and<00:00:56.820> lay<00:00:57.450> this

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
design then we come back and lay this

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.560 
design then we come back and lay this
out<00:00:57.840> in<00:00:57.899> autocad<00:00:59.300> electronic<00:01:00.300> drawing

program<00:01:01.280> to<00:01:02.280> get<00:01:02.430> all<00:01:02.610> the<00:01:02.700> right<00:01:02.879> proportion

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
program to get all the right proportion

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.219 
program to get all the right proportion
the<00:01:03.870> geometry<00:01:04.440> of<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:05.159> trailer<00:01:05.430> then<00:01:06.229> we

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
the geometry of the trailer then we

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:10.609 
the geometry of the trailer then we
detail<00:01:07.590> all<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:07.770> parts<00:01:08.550> up<00:01:08.810> so<00:01:09.810> that<00:01:10.050> we<00:01:10.590> have

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
detail all the parts up so that we have

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.620 
detail all the parts up so that we have
drawings<00:01:11.009> working<00:01:11.729> drawings<00:01:11.940> for<00:01:12.240> everything

drawings working drawings for everything

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.260 
drawings working drawings for everything
we<00:01:13.530> had<00:01:13.680> order<00:01:14.040> special<00:01:14.280> material<00:01:14.970> for<00:01:15.180> this

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
we had order special material for this

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.910 
we had order special material for this
particular<00:01:15.900> job

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
particular job

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.070

the<00:01:17.220> frames<00:01:17.460> themselves<00:01:18.060> are<00:01:18.210> actually<00:01:18.330> 400

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
the frames themselves are actually 400

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.560 
the frames themselves are actually 400
inches<00:01:19.350> long<00:01:19.640> it's<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.820> biggest<00:01:21.150> range<00:01:21.330> we've

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
inches long it's the biggest range we've

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.320 
inches long it's the biggest range we've
ever<00:01:21.720> actually<00:01:21.930> made<00:01:22.290> here<00:01:22.440> at<00:01:22.590> load<00:01:22.740> right

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:23.330 
ever actually made here at load right

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.960 
ever actually made here at load right
and<00:01:24.330> then<00:01:24.479> we<00:01:24.659> process<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.320> frames<00:01:25.729> and<00:01:26.729> then

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:26.970 
and then we process the frames and then

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.740 
and then we process the frames and then
we<00:01:27.440> we<00:01:28.440> send<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:29.330> frames<00:01:30.330> out<00:01:30.509> for

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
we we send the frames out for

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.410 
we we send the frames out for
galvanizing<00:01:31.410> hot<00:01:31.560> dip<00:01:31.770> galvanizing<00:01:32.280> which<00:01:33.270> is

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
galvanizing hot dip galvanizing which is

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.670 
galvanizing hot dip galvanizing which is
a<00:01:33.450> process<00:01:34.080> that<00:01:34.680> protects<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.580> brain<00:01:36.680> region

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
a process that protects the brain region

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.279 
a process that protects the brain region
and<00:01:37.830> rust<00:01:38.070> and<00:01:38.630> that's<00:01:39.630> pretty<00:01:39.869> much<00:01:40.050> how<00:01:40.229> we

00:01:40.279 --> 00:01:40.289 
and rust and that's pretty much how we

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:45.870 
and rust and that's pretty much how we
make<00:01:40.560> most<00:01:40.800> of<00:01:41.009> our<00:01:41.160> of<00:01:41.460> our<00:01:41.580> trailers<00:01:42.060> here

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:45.880 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:47.190 

at<00:01:45.969> that<00:01:46.180> point<00:01:46.390> we<00:01:46.600> received<00:01:46.990> other

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
at that point we received other

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.230 
at that point we received other
materials<00:01:47.619> back<00:01:47.799> from<00:01:48.189> the<00:01:48.369> the<00:01:48.640> galvanizing

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
materials back from the the galvanizing

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.630 
materials back from the the galvanizing
process<00:01:49.869> and<00:01:50.170> what<00:01:50.829> you<00:01:50.950> think<00:01:51.189> today<00:01:51.460> is<00:01:51.610> the

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
process and what you think today is the

00:01:51.640 --> 00:02:08.820 
process and what you think today is the
actual<00:01:52.119> assembly<00:01:52.450> of<00:01:52.780> the<00:01:52.960> trailer<00:01:53.229> so

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.200 

when<00:02:09.830> he<00:02:09.950> flips<00:02:10.250> us<00:02:10.369> over<00:02:10.759> and<00:02:10.880> starts

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:11.210 
when he flips us over and starts

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:14.800 
when he flips us over and starts
building<00:02:11.750> all<00:02:12.140> the<00:02:13.090> appendages<00:02:14.090> on<00:02:14.570> the

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
building all the appendages on the

questions and so forth

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:22.240

probably<00:02:18.950> about<00:02:19.930> this<00:02:20.930> much<00:02:21.200> time<00:02:21.410> again<00:02:21.920> so

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
probably about this much time again so

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.970 
probably about this much time again so
the<00:02:22.400> process<00:02:23.300> that<00:02:23.330> we're<00:02:23.600> at<00:02:23.720> right<00:02:23.750> now<00:02:24.080> the

the process that we're at right now the

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.260 
the process that we're at right now the
stage<00:02:25.220> of<00:02:25.370> the<00:02:25.430> process<00:02:25.790> that<00:02:25.880> we're<00:02:26.030> in<00:02:26.120> right

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
stage of the process that we're in right

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.350 
stage of the process that we're in right
now<00:02:26.330> is<00:02:26.840> about<00:02:27.200> half<00:02:27.440> way<00:02:27.710> of<00:02:28.190> the<00:02:28.430> final<00:02:29.240> up

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
now is about half way of the final up

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:58.230 
now is about half way of the final up
assembly<00:02:29.720> process<00:02:30.380> itself

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:58.240 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.150 

so<00:02:58.570> basically<00:02:58.930> this<00:02:59.140> is<00:02:59.320> a<00:02:59.350> custom<00:02:59.890> trailer

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
so basically this is a custom trailer

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.520 
so basically this is a custom trailer
it's<00:03:00.880> a<00:03:00.970> one-off

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 
it's a one-off

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.120 
it's a one-off
we<00:03:03.070> pretty<00:03:03.850> much<00:03:03.940> designed<00:03:04.360> it<00:03:04.570> from<00:03:04.690> scratch

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.130 
we pretty much designed it from scratch

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.100 
we pretty much designed it from scratch
and<00:03:06.130> it's<00:03:06.310> designed<00:03:06.730> and<00:03:06.940> curtailed<00:03:07.540> to<00:03:07.870> fit

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
and it's designed and curtailed to fit

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:11.340 
and it's designed and curtailed to fit
those<00:03:08.710> boats<00:03:09.070> specifically<00:03:09.990> for<00:03:10.990> local

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
those boats specifically for local

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.140 
those boats specifically for local
