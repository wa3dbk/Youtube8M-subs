airplane to show you this one is called

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:06.829 
airplane to show you this one is called
space<00:00:05.310> shuttle<00:00:05.700> it<00:00:06.240> actually<00:00:06.509> looks<00:00:06.720> like

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
space shuttle it actually looks like

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.230 
space shuttle it actually looks like
Space<00:00:07.319> Shuttle<00:00:07.350> and<00:00:07.799> also<00:00:08.220> flies<00:00:08.519> like<00:00:08.940> space

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
Space Shuttle and also flies like space

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.900 
Space Shuttle and also flies like space
shuttle<00:00:09.710> so<00:00:10.710> all<00:00:10.889> you<00:00:11.010> need<00:00:11.190> is<00:00:11.370> one<00:00:11.639> sheet<00:00:11.880> of

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:11.910 
shuttle so all you need is one sheet of

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.890 
shuttle so all you need is one sheet of
a4<00:00:12.269> or<00:00:12.840> letter<00:00:12.870> size<00:00:13.230> paper<00:00:14.509> you<00:00:15.509> start

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
a4 or letter size paper you start

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.150 
a4 or letter size paper you start
folding<00:00:16.260> it<00:00:16.680> in<00:00:17.160> half<00:00:17.220> just<00:00:18.000> like<00:00:18.539> that<00:00:18.810> as

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:19.160 
folding it in half just like that as

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.609 
folding it in half just like that as
precisely<00:00:20.160> as<00:00:20.400> you<00:00:20.580> can

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:21.619 
precisely as you can

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:26.120 
precisely as you can
meeting<00:00:22.619> those<00:00:22.920> corners<00:00:23.369> nicely<00:00:25.010> can<00:00:26.010> use

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
meeting those corners nicely can use

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.339 
meeting those corners nicely can use
your<00:00:26.279> fingernails<00:00:26.760> or<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.240> crease<00:00:27.480> for<00:00:28.260> the

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
your fingernails or the crease for the

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.380 
your fingernails or the crease for the
fold<00:00:28.590> just<00:00:29.599> like<00:00:30.599> that<00:00:30.810> and<00:00:31.669> you<00:00:32.669> might<00:00:32.820> need<00:00:33.059> a

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
fold just like that and you might need a

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.650 
fold just like that and you might need a
ruler<00:00:34.020> for<00:00:34.640> the<00:00:35.640> measurements<00:00:36.210> it<00:00:36.420> doesn't

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
ruler for the measurements it doesn't

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.209 
ruler for the measurements it doesn't
have<00:00:36.750> to<00:00:36.840> be<00:00:36.930> exactly<00:00:37.290> but<00:00:37.530> it's<00:00:37.680> quite<00:00:37.920> you

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
have to be exactly but it's quite you

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:41.569 
have to be exactly but it's quite you
know<00:00:38.280> if<00:00:38.579> you<00:00:38.700> if<00:00:39.390> you're<00:00:39.540> not<00:00:40.550> good<00:00:41.550> at

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
know if you if you're not good at

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.760 
know if you if you're not good at
estimating<00:00:41.910> so<00:00:42.570> we<00:00:42.690> just<00:00:42.870> do<00:00:43.110> exactly<00:00:43.230> 4

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
estimating so we just do exactly 4

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.590 
estimating so we just do exactly 4
centimeters<00:00:44.340> or<00:00:44.520> 1<00:00:44.730> and<00:00:44.850> a<00:00:44.879> half<00:00:44.969> inch<00:00:45.270> it's

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
centimeters or 1 and a half inch it's

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.779 
centimeters or 1 and a half inch it's
fine<00:00:45.840> just<00:00:46.620> like<00:00:46.800> that<00:00:46.980> you<00:00:47.070> can<00:00:47.190> use<00:00:47.219> marker

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
fine just like that you can use marker

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.260 
fine just like that you can use marker
or<00:00:48.030> and<00:00:48.480> saw<00:00:48.809> something<00:00:49.200> I'll<00:00:49.350> just<00:00:50.030> push<00:00:51.030> into

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
or and saw something I'll just push into

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.319 
or and saw something I'll just push into
the<00:00:51.690> roller<00:00:51.960> and<00:00:52.280> you<00:00:53.280> mark<00:00:53.489> half<00:00:53.940> of<00:00:54.180> this

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
the roller and you mark half of this

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.049 
the roller and you mark half of this
distance<00:00:54.600> too<00:00:55.110> so<00:00:55.860> I<00:00:56.219> do<00:00:56.340> it<00:00:56.550> like<00:00:56.699> that<00:00:56.760> it

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
distance too so I do it like that it

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.150 
distance too so I do it like that it
still<00:00:57.710> half<00:00:58.710> this<00:00:59.070> pattern<00:01:00.320> so<00:01:01.320> again<00:01:01.739> I'll

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
still half this pattern so again I'll

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:10.100 
still half this pattern so again I'll
make<00:01:02.430> Monta<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:03.629> then<00:01:04.199> you<00:01:06.110> make<00:01:07.110> a<00:01:07.140> fold<00:01:09.110> just

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
make Monta and then you make a fold just

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:17.830 
make Monta and then you make a fold just
like<00:01:10.320> that

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:25.639 

again<00:01:19.340> like<00:01:20.340> that<00:01:20.549> and<00:01:20.869> unfold<00:01:22.820> and<00:01:24.470> you<00:01:25.470> do

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:25.649 
again like that and unfold and you do

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:33.139 
again like that and unfold and you do
the<00:01:25.829> same<00:01:26.100> thing<00:01:28.909> on<00:01:29.909> the<00:01:30.030> other<00:01:30.119> side<00:01:32.149> just

00:01:33.139 --> 00:01:33.149 
the same thing on the other side just

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:39.620 
the same thing on the other side just
like<00:01:33.330> that<00:01:33.390> unfold<00:01:34.289> and<00:01:37.189> so<00:01:38.189> you<00:01:38.250> go<00:01:38.460> bad<00:01:38.729> and

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
like that unfold and so you go bad and

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.270 
like that unfold and so you go bad and
then<00:01:40.560> you<00:01:40.970> need<00:01:41.970> to<00:01:42.649> kind<00:01:43.649> of<00:01:43.799> push<00:01:44.070> this

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
then you need to kind of push this

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.690 
then you need to kind of push this
inside<00:01:44.549> do<00:01:44.939> it<00:01:45.060> like<00:01:45.240> that<00:01:45.270> always<00:01:46.429> just<00:01:47.429> do

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
inside do it like that always just do

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.590 
inside do it like that always just do
that<00:01:47.939> this<00:01:48.210> way<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:50.509> just<00:01:51.509> like<00:01:51.810> that<00:01:52.020> and

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
that this way and just like that and

00:01:53.600 --> 00:02:03.109 
that this way and just like that and
that<00:02:01.250> again<00:02:02.250> you<00:02:02.399> can<00:02:02.429> use<00:02:02.700> the<00:02:02.819> roll<00:02:02.970> up

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
that again you can use the roll up

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:06.580 
that again you can use the roll up
getting<00:02:03.659> about<00:02:03.840> 2<00:02:04.289> 2<00:02:04.679> centimeters<00:02:05.250> which<00:02:05.369> is

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:06.590 
getting about 2 2 centimeters which is

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:10.460 
getting about 2 2 centimeters which is
3/4<00:02:07.590> of<00:02:07.679> an<00:02:07.860> inch<00:02:07.979> a<00:02:08.369> distance<00:02:09.269> so<00:02:09.569> roughly

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
3/4 of an inch a distance so roughly

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:18.020 
3/4 of an inch a distance so roughly
that<00:02:11.450> make<00:02:12.450> a<00:02:12.480> crease<00:02:12.840> or<00:02:12.989> mark<00:02:14.569> and<00:02:16.730> fold<00:02:17.730> and

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
that make a crease or mark and fold and

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.570 
that make a crease or mark and fold and
you<00:02:18.239> go<00:02:18.360> all<00:02:18.540> the<00:02:18.690> way<00:02:18.720> to<00:02:19.650> the<00:02:19.769> to<00:02:20.220> the<00:02:20.310> point

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
you go all the way to the to the point

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:30.940 
you go all the way to the to the point
there<00:02:20.760> so<00:02:21.030> that<00:02:25.130> just<00:02:26.130> like<00:02:26.280> that

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.150 

and<00:02:32.120> you<00:02:33.120> turn<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:33.870> other<00:02:34.110> side<00:02:34.200> and<00:02:34.800> do<00:02:35.130> the

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
and you turn the other side and do the

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.890 
and you turn the other side and do the
same<00:02:35.910> thing<00:02:38.180> the<00:02:39.180> other<00:02:39.209> side<00:02:39.600> is<00:02:39.720> always

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
same thing the other side is always

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.410 
same thing the other side is always
slightly<00:02:40.770> easier<00:02:41.220> sooner<00:02:41.700> imagine<00:02:42.180> I<00:02:42.240> can

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
slightly easier sooner imagine I can

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.870 
slightly easier sooner imagine I can
just<00:02:42.600> follow<00:02:42.890> what<00:02:43.890> you<00:02:44.100> did<00:02:44.250> with<00:02:44.520> the<00:02:44.640> first

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
just follow what you did with the first

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.350 
just follow what you did with the first
one

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.090 

okay<00:02:48.360> always<00:02:48.540> is<00:02:49.110> precise<00:02:49.530> did<00:02:49.770> you<00:02:49.890> can

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
okay always is precise did you can

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.540 
okay always is precise did you can
occurs<00:02:50.310> to<00:02:50.489> you<00:02:51.380> if<00:02:52.380> you<00:02:52.530> undo<00:02:52.800> precisely<00:02:53.220> then

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
occurs to you if you undo precisely then

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.760 
occurs to you if you undo precisely then
I<00:02:53.700> can<00:02:54.060> just<00:02:54.330> get<00:02:54.510> just<00:02:54.870> goes<00:02:55.050> all<00:02:55.440> over<00:02:55.500> the

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770 
I can just get just goes all over the

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:05.390 
I can just get just goes all over the
place<00:02:55.980> just<00:02:57.050> like<00:02:58.050> that<00:02:58.670> and<00:03:01.700> go<00:03:02.700> back<00:03:04.400> and

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
place just like that and go back and

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.110 
place just like that and go back and
take<00:03:05.880> this<00:03:06.030> point<00:03:06.330> I<00:03:06.630> did<00:03:06.930> this<00:03:07.500> bit<00:03:08.220> and<00:03:08.489> use

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
take this point I did this bit and use

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:17.920 
take this point I did this bit and use
as<00:03:09.450> a<00:03:09.890> line<00:03:10.890> that<00:03:12.380> you<00:03:13.380> use<00:03:13.700> for<00:03:14.700> this<00:03:14.910> fold

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.270 

then<00:03:18.930> you<00:03:19.110> go<00:03:19.230> all<00:03:19.470> the<00:03:19.650> way<00:03:19.680> to<00:03:19.800> the<00:03:19.980> point

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
then you go all the way to the point

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:26.059 
then you go all the way to the point
there

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:26.069 

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:32.899 

just<00:03:26.939> like<00:03:27.090> that<00:03:27.480> and<00:03:28.700> flip<00:03:31.069> and<00:03:32.069> use<00:03:32.400> same

00:03:32.899 --> 00:03:32.909 
just like that and flip and use same

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:44.490 
just like that and flip and use same
thing<00:03:33.180> the<00:03:33.810> other<00:03:33.959> side

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.170 

just<00:03:45.100> like<00:03:45.310> that<00:03:47.100> then<00:03:48.100> you<00:03:48.340> take<00:03:48.580> a<00:03:48.640> roll

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:49.180 
just like that then you take a roll

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:53.880 
just like that then you take a roll
again<00:03:49.570> and<00:03:50.910> roughly<00:03:52.470> doesn't<00:03:53.470> need<00:03:53.590> to<00:03:53.740> be

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
again and roughly doesn't need to be

00:03:53.890 --> 00:04:01.410 
again and roughly doesn't need to be
exactly<00:03:58.380> always<00:03:59.380> do<00:03:59.590> it<00:03:59.740> this<00:03:59.830> way<00:04:00.150> it's<00:04:01.150> easy

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:01.420 
exactly always do it this way it's easy

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:06.380 
exactly always do it this way it's easy
so<00:04:02.320> four<00:04:03.130> centimeters<00:04:04.170> from<00:04:05.170> this<00:04:05.440> this<00:04:05.830> point

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
so four centimeters from this this point

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:13.200 
so four centimeters from this this point
so<00:04:07.740> they're<00:04:08.740> like<00:04:09.400> a<00:04:09.430> mark<00:04:10.320> and<00:04:11.880> you<00:04:12.880> start

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:13.210 
so they're like a mark and you start

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:17.390 
so they're like a mark and you start
falling<00:04:13.800> here<00:04:14.800> all<00:04:15.070> the<00:04:15.220> way<00:04:15.340> to<00:04:15.370> the<00:04:15.610> edge

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
falling here all the way to the edge

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.750 
falling here all the way to the edge
just<00:04:18.400> like<00:04:18.549> that<00:04:18.880> and<00:04:19.690> make<00:04:20.260> sure<00:04:20.290> those<00:04:20.760> four

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
just like that and make sure those four

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.630 
just like that and make sure those four
centimeters<00:04:22.330> or<00:04:22.570> one<00:04:23.200> 1/2<00:04:23.410> inch<00:04:23.740> again<00:04:24.040> it's

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:24.640 
centimeters or one 1/2 inch again it's

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:31.110 
centimeters or one 1/2 inch again it's
the<00:04:24.910> same<00:04:28.350> just<00:04:29.350> like<00:04:29.410> that<00:04:29.710> and<00:04:30.310> the<00:04:30.820> same

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:31.120 
the same just like that and the same

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:50.250 
the same just like that and the same
thing<00:04:31.980> on<00:04:32.980> the<00:04:33.220> other<00:04:33.250> side

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:50.260 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:54.190 

yeah<00:04:51.280> open<00:04:52.280> done<00:04:52.460> this<00:04:53.150> doesn't<00:04:53.540> matter<00:04:53.630> is

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:54.200 
yeah open done this doesn't matter is

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:58.240 
yeah open done this doesn't matter is
useful<00:04:54.980> it's<00:04:55.250> okay<00:04:55.990> so<00:04:56.990> just<00:04:57.230> like<00:04:57.380> that<00:04:57.410> then

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:58.250 
useful it's okay so just like that then

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:04.810 
useful it's okay so just like that then
I<00:04:58.430> turn<00:04:58.760> again<00:04:59.720> this<00:05:00.260> way<00:05:00.500> and<00:05:01.690> last<00:05:02.690> bit<00:05:03.820> you

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:04.820 
I turn again this way and last bit you

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:08.440 
I turn again this way and last bit you
fold<00:05:05.240> these<00:05:05.570> wings<00:05:06.160> back<00:05:07.160> and<00:05:07.580> you<00:05:08.000> use<00:05:08.240> this

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:08.450 
fold these wings back and you use this

00:05:08.450 --> 00:05:11.650 
fold these wings back and you use this
line<00:05:09.190> for<00:05:10.190> the<00:05:10.310> for<00:05:10.610> the<00:05:10.700> false<00:05:10.940> we<00:05:11.150> just<00:05:11.360> make

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:11.660 
line for the for the false we just make

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:19.260 
line for the for the false we just make
it<00:05:14.470> just<00:05:15.470> follow<00:05:15.770> the<00:05:16.250> line<00:05:16.630> just<00:05:17.630> like<00:05:17.750> that

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:19.270 
it just follow the line just like that

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:27.330 
it just follow the line just like that
and<00:05:22.600> turn<00:05:23.600> it<00:05:23.660> to<00:05:23.930> the<00:05:24.050> other<00:05:24.110> side<00:05:24.410> and<00:05:25.270> you

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:27.340 
and turn it to the other side and you

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:39.600 
and turn it to the other side and you
fold<00:05:30.880> this<00:05:31.880> side<00:05:32.240> again<00:05:32.530> or<00:05:33.530> as<00:05:33.830> well

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:39.610 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:43.329 

okay<00:05:40.610> that's<00:05:41.389> pretty<00:05:41.569> much<00:05:41.719> it<00:05:42.019> now<00:05:42.289> I<00:05:42.860> need<00:05:43.189> to

00:05:43.329 --> 00:05:43.339 
okay that's pretty much it now I need to

00:05:43.339 --> 00:05:47.559 
okay that's pretty much it now I need to
adjust<00:05:43.519> it<00:05:44.739> so<00:05:45.739> you<00:05:45.830> kind<00:05:46.069> of<00:05:46.209> show<00:05:47.209> you<00:05:47.269> how<00:05:47.449> it

00:05:47.559 --> 00:05:47.569 
adjust it so you kind of show you how it

00:05:47.569 --> 00:05:49.929 
adjust it so you kind of show you how it
should<00:05:47.599> look<00:05:47.779> like<00:05:47.929> at<00:05:48.349> the<00:05:48.499> end<00:05:48.649> so<00:05:48.919> when<00:05:49.789> you

00:05:49.929 --> 00:05:49.939 
should look like at the end so when you

00:05:49.939 --> 00:05:56.049 
should look like at the end so when you
actually<00:05:50.360> hold<00:05:50.809> it<00:05:51.789> these<00:05:52.789> wayne's<00:05:54.909> should<00:05:55.909> be

00:05:56.049 --> 00:05:56.059 
actually hold it these wayne's should be

00:05:56.059 --> 00:06:00.219 
actually hold it these wayne's should be
roughly<00:05:56.269> 90<00:05:56.839> degrees<00:05:57.199> so<00:05:58.029> from<00:05:59.029> the<00:05:59.149> back<00:05:59.330> it

00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:00.229 
roughly 90 degrees so from the back it

00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:03.939 
roughly 90 degrees so from the back it
should<00:06:00.439> look<00:06:00.559> like<00:06:02.199> pretty<00:06:03.199> much<00:06:03.319> like<00:06:03.529> this

00:06:03.939 --> 00:06:03.949 
should look like pretty much like this

00:06:03.949 --> 00:06:10.570 
should look like pretty much like this
oh<00:06:05.319> it<00:06:06.319> pretty<00:06:06.589> much<00:06:06.679> looks<00:06:07.009> like<00:06:09.580> Space

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:10.580 
oh it pretty much looks like Space

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:13.899 
oh it pretty much looks like Space
Shuttle<00:06:11.439> exactly<00:06:12.439> also<00:06:12.709> flies<00:06:12.979> as<00:06:13.579> Space

00:06:13.899 --> 00:06:13.909 
Shuttle exactly also flies as Space

00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:16.209 
Shuttle exactly also flies as Space
Shuttle<00:06:13.939> you<00:06:14.809> don't<00:06:15.349> need<00:06:15.469> to<00:06:15.649> throw<00:06:15.889> it<00:06:16.039> too

00:06:16.209 --> 00:06:16.219 
Shuttle you don't need to throw it too

00:06:16.219 --> 00:06:20.529 
Shuttle you don't need to throw it too
hard<00:06:16.459> just<00:06:16.869> just<00:06:17.869> like<00:06:18.349> a<00:06:18.379> medium<00:06:19.239> throw<00:06:20.239> and

00:06:20.529 --> 00:06:20.539 
hard just just like a medium throw and

00:06:20.539 --> 00:06:24.579 
hard just just like a medium throw and
you<00:06:20.979> throw<00:06:21.979> it<00:06:22.159> a<00:06:22.189> bit<00:06:22.969> upwards<00:06:23.389> that<00:06:24.110> way<00:06:24.319> that

00:06:24.579 --> 00:06:24.589 
you throw it a bit upwards that way that

00:06:24.589 --> 00:06:26.469 
you throw it a bit upwards that way that
should<00:06:24.739> actually<00:06:24.860> go<00:06:25.610> slightly<00:06:25.909> upwards<00:06:26.360> and

00:06:26.469 --> 00:06:26.479 
should actually go slightly upwards and

00:06:26.479 --> 00:06:29.529 
should actually go slightly upwards and
then<00:06:26.889> starts<00:06:27.889> to<00:06:27.979> glide<00:06:28.249> down<00:06:28.550> a<00:06:29.059> Space

00:06:29.529 --> 00:06:29.539 
then starts to glide down a Space

00:06:29.539 --> 00:06:34.269 
then starts to glide down a Space
Shuttle<00:06:29.629> when<00:06:30.379> it's<00:06:30.559> landing<00:06:32.559> okay<00:06:33.589> have<00:06:34.249> a

00:06:34.269 --> 00:06:34.279 
Shuttle when it's landing okay have a

00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:42.500 
Shuttle when it's landing okay have a
good<00:06:34.429> one

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:42.510 

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:44.570 

you
