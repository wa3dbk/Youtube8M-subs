00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
to demonstrate the qualities of

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.919 
to demonstrate the qualities of
revolution<00:00:13.349> number<00:00:13.620> three<00:00:14.360> we<00:00:15.360> have<00:00:15.750> been

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
revolution number three we have been

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.960 
revolution number three we have been
testing<00:00:16.440> ratchets<00:00:16.920> without<00:00:17.460> rubbers<00:00:18.770> now<00:00:19.970> we

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
testing ratchets without rubbers now we

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.870 
testing ratchets without rubbers now we
are<00:00:21.090> changing<00:00:21.330> only<00:00:22.289> one<00:00:22.710> rubber<00:00:23.039> from<00:00:23.820> the

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
are changing only one rubber from the

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.029 
are changing only one rubber from the
ratchet<00:00:24.300> and<00:00:24.480> we<00:00:25.019> will<00:00:25.170> compare<00:00:25.560> the<00:00:25.619> sound

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
ratchet and we will compare the sound

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.939 
ratchet and we will compare the sound
and<00:00:26.460> the<00:00:27.180> trajector<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:28.050> trajectory<00:00:28.680> of<00:00:28.740> the

ball all rubbers with new rubbles glued

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.330 
ball all rubbers with new rubbles glued
with<00:00:33.540> the<00:00:33.750> same<00:00:33.989> revolution<00:00:34.559> number<00:00:34.800> three<00:00:35.570> so

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:37.340 
with the same revolution number three so

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.350 
with the same revolution number three so
this<00:00:38.340> is<00:00:38.520> your<00:00:38.700> rubber<00:00:38.879> we<00:00:39.570> just<00:00:39.840> peel<00:00:40.020> it<00:00:40.050> off

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:41.360 
this is your rubber we just peel it off

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:51.049 
this is your rubber we just peel it off
very<00:00:42.360> simple<00:00:43.320> and<00:00:43.469> easy<00:00:48.770> the<00:00:49.770> same<00:00:50.059> we

layers<00:00:56.940> on<00:00:57.239> the<00:00:57.360> rubbers<00:00:57.690> two<00:00:58.620> layers<00:00:58.859> on<00:00:59.129> the

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
layers on the rubbers two layers on the

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:08.850 
layers on the rubbers two layers on the
blade<00:00:59.719> we<00:01:00.719> will<00:01:00.899> do<00:01:01.050> that

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:08.860 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:16.830 

you

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:31.649 

I<00:01:19.799> will<00:01:20.799> let<00:01:20.979> it<00:01:21.130> dry<00:01:21.340> naturally<00:01:25.110> okay<00:01:26.110> so<00:01:30.659> this

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:31.659 
I will let it dry naturally okay so this

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:49.399 
I will let it dry naturally okay so this
is<00:01:31.840> the<00:01:31.960> second<00:01:32.350> layer

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:55.710 

so

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:06.490 

a<00:01:55.810> second<00:01:56.770> layer<00:01:56.950> on<00:01:59.490> the<00:02:00.490> blade

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.710 

second<00:02:07.370> layer<00:02:07.520> is<00:02:08.149> dried<00:02:10.420> that<00:02:11.420> is<00:02:11.600> the

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
second layer is dried that is the

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:19.130 
second layer is dried that is the
quality

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.620 

and<00:02:19.230> the<00:02:19.770> surface<00:02:20.190> is<00:02:20.430> ready<00:02:20.670> for<00:02:21.060> applying

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:21.630 
and the surface is ready for applying

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:23.690 
and the surface is ready for applying
the<00:02:21.840> third<00:02:22.050> layer<00:02:22.290> this<00:02:23.100> one<00:02:23.310> is<00:02:23.460> ready

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
the third layer this one is ready

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.550 
the third layer this one is ready
already<00:02:24.230> this<00:02:25.230> one<00:02:25.470> still<00:02:26.460> has<00:02:26.730> to<00:02:26.970> be<00:02:27.120> dry

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
already this one still has to be dry

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:38.770 
already this one still has to be dry
okay<00:02:28.560> let's<00:02:29.160> go<00:02:29.370> for<00:02:29.610> the<00:02:29.760> third<00:02:29.970> layer

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.520 

you

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.760 

so<00:02:42.160> I<00:02:42.430> don't<00:02:42.850> need<00:02:43.030> anymore<00:02:43.270> to<00:02:43.450> sponge<00:02:43.870> so<00:02:44.500> I

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
so I don't need anymore to sponge so I

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:52.490 
so I don't need anymore to sponge so I
will<00:02:46.620> clean<00:02:47.620> it<00:02:48.390> very<00:02:49.390> simple<00:02:49.810> in<00:02:50.230> the<00:02:50.410> water

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
will clean it very simple in the water

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:59.640 
will clean it very simple in the water
after<00:02:53.670> I<00:02:54.670> use<00:02:54.940> it<00:02:55.180> to<00:02:55.390> apply<00:02:57.330> practically<00:02:58.330> 6<00:02:58.720> 10

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
after I use it to apply practically 6 10

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:05.030 
after I use it to apply practically 6 10
layers<00:02:59.860> of<00:03:00.600> rubber<00:03:01.600> of<00:03:03.390> rubber<00:03:04.390> glue

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.300 
revolution number three on blade and

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:15.540 
revolution number three on blade and
rubbers<00:03:12.270> I'm<00:03:13.270> washing<00:03:13.540> it<00:03:13.810> and<00:03:14.770> I<00:03:14.950> can<00:03:15.190> reuse

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:15.550 
rubbers I'm washing it and I can reuse

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:21.870 
rubbers I'm washing it and I can reuse
it<00:03:15.790> without<00:03:16.600> any<00:03:16.840> pool<00:03:19.920> after<00:03:20.920> its<00:03:21.370> dried<00:03:21.489> I

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
it without any pool after its dried I

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:27.210 
it without any pool after its dried I
can<00:03:22.480> simply<00:03:23.459> clean<00:03:24.459> it<00:03:24.610> very<00:03:24.850> simple<00:03:25.600> so<00:03:26.230> the

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
can simply clean it very simple so the

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.220 
can simply clean it very simple so the
sponge<00:03:27.459> will<00:03:27.910> remain<00:03:28.180> like<00:03:28.360> this<00:03:28.390> and<00:03:28.840> it<00:03:29.050> will
