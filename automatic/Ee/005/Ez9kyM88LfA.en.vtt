 in most indoor plants comes the 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.319
 Community spindle is escaped shot 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.379
 in front 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:10.230
 she is just 0 5 mm tall and 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:12.750
 of green yellow autumn color through 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.460
 environmental influences also red even if they are 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.809
 should be seen with the eye coming 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.020
 Do not call them an important pest 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.580
 disregard to ideas, a 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.500
 Other spiders wilber occur 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.199
 so-called false spider mites with the 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.849
 Names prepaid bus others frequently 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.720
 affected plants are among others 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.480
 oleander 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.730
 margarethen hotel attract many godparents 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.969
 but also tomatoes and cucumbers 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.140
 They usually suck on the underside of leaves 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:38.969
 which is on the plate upper and 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.850
 bottom by white yellowish spots 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.950
 noticeable i'm worried the 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.440
 cells of the plant empty there is no air 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.750
 get into it in the totality 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.700
 this pattern results in very strong 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.530
 infestation is a herbert base and 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.800
 also between the leaves a fine 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.420
 twinned to recognize from 20 degrees upwards 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.910
 the animals feel most comfortable and 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.620
 the development cycle from 1 to 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.110
 adult animal runs within 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.460
 only 14 days off even a dry one 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.729
 Weather contributes to rapid spread 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.220
 especially in winter when dry 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.350
 heating air the lack of light which to 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.170
 Soft leaves are often used 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.240
 The easiest way to contain this is to 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.650
 cut the plant here if 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.520
 all affected plant parts 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.770
 cut out 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.960
 in the chemical fight you have to 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.119
 at least two to three times in between 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.610
 from seven to ten days splash around 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.619
 all strained generations to meet as 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.479
 are well protected in their ghost 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.040
 It is recommended in the spray liquor 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.049
 Add a drop of dishwashing detergent 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.270
 to enter this causes a 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:42.560
 surfaces relaxation of the water and 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.560
 the agent can work better 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.360
 Biologically you can take rausnehmen 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:53.090
 of the salon to end the bustle 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.729
 They suck larvae and adults 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.740
 eggs also a good one 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:00.079
 Fighting methods is the increase of 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:03.079
 humidity and if possible 

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:04.610
 lowing temperature for this easy 

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:07.420
 a transparent plastic bag over the 

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.590
 pull the plant and turn it once in a while 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:11.239
 no matter which method you choose 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.980
 will decide against spider mites 

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:16.660
 nothing was done then within a short time 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.660
 time the complete plants die off
