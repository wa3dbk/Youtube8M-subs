just like a little arcade firing names

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.530 
just like a little arcade firing names
you<00:01:16.320> know<00:01:16.350> and<00:01:17.000> it<00:01:18.000> doesn't<00:01:18.030> worry<00:01:18.450> about

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
you know and it doesn't worry about

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.820 
you know and it doesn't worry about
actressy<00:01:19.110> your<00:01:19.259> time<00:01:19.470> or<00:01:19.770> anything<00:01:20.070> like<00:01:20.100> that

seeing<00:01:22.830> after<00:01:23.070> you<00:01:23.159> finish<00:01:23.930> the<00:01:24.930> counter<00:01:25.259> goes

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
seeing after you finish the counter goes

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.350 
seeing after you finish the counter goes
down<00:01:25.680> it'll<00:01:26.009> open<00:01:26.220> up<00:01:26.520> and<00:01:26.820> you<00:01:27.090> can<00:01:27.210> go

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
down it'll open up and you can go

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:38.170 
down it'll open up and you can go
forward<00:01:30.829> and<00:01:31.829> go<00:01:32.009> on<00:01:32.159> just<00:01:32.400> to<00:01:32.520> the<00:01:32.610> next<00:01:32.880> part

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:44.200 

seems<00:01:39.180> just<00:01:39.329> walk<00:01:39.509> around

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.480 

looks<00:01:45.210> like<00:01:45.360> bender<00:01:45.750> it's<00:01:46.260> not<00:01:46.380> okay<00:01:47.070> so<00:01:47.370> the

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
looks like bender it's not okay so the

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.720 
looks like bender it's not okay so the
next<00:01:47.520> games<00:01:47.940> right<00:01:48.150> here<00:01:49.310> and<00:01:50.310> this<00:01:50.400> one's<00:01:50.640> a

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:50.730 
next games right here and this one's a

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:52.880 
next games right here and this one's a
little<00:01:50.940> bit<00:01:51.210> tougher<00:01:51.420> to<00:01:52.410> get<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.620> moving

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
little bit tougher to get the moving

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.320 
little bit tougher to get the moving
targets<00:01:53.340> but<00:01:53.580> if<00:01:53.700> you<00:01:53.790> shoot<00:01:53.970> them<00:01:54.060> twice

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330 
targets but if you shoot them twice

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:56.240 
targets but if you shoot them twice
they'll<00:01:54.720> flip<00:01:54.900> back<00:01:55.110> around<00:01:55.470> saw<00:01:55.950> on<00:01:56.070> to<00:01:56.160> the

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
they'll flip back around saw on to the

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:02.870 
they'll flip back around saw on to the
next<00:01:56.460> part<00:02:01.190> so<00:02:02.190> you<00:02:02.250> gets<00:02:02.400> a<00:02:02.490> little<00:02:02.640> more

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
next part so you gets a little more

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.560 
next part so you gets a little more
complicated<00:02:03.450> here<00:02:03.990> see<00:02:05.270> see<00:02:06.270> you<00:02:06.330> get<00:02:06.450> the

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
complicated here see see you get the

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.730 
complicated here see see you get the
moving<00:02:06.840> target<00:02:08.840> it's<00:02:09.840> not<00:02:09.930> that<00:02:09.990> hard<00:02:10.350> it's

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:10.740 
moving target it's not that hard it's

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.610 
moving target it's not that hard it's
