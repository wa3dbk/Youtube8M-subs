made marks in the very beginning you

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.160 
made marks in the very beginning you

have to release yourself from any
preconceived<00:00:38.739> notions<00:00:39.250> of<00:00:39.489> it<00:00:40.030> being<00:00:40.210> a

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:40.540 
preconceived notions of it being a

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.360 
preconceived notions of it being a
certain<00:00:40.989> way<00:00:41.140> and<00:00:41.710> you<00:00:41.769> have<00:00:41.890> to<00:00:42.040> be<00:00:42.129> a<00:00:42.160> peace

with<00:00:42.580> what<00:00:42.730> happens<00:00:43.059> okay<00:00:43.420> so<00:00:43.629> we're<00:00:43.840> gonna

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:43.930 
with what happens okay so we're gonna

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:45.180 
with what happens okay so we're gonna
make<00:00:44.110> puddles<00:00:44.500> and<00:00:44.739> then<00:00:44.890> we're<00:00:45.010> gonna<00:00:45.100> throw

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:45.190 
make puddles and then we're gonna throw

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:47.430 
make puddles and then we're gonna throw
because<00:00:45.640> the<00:00:45.940> inks<00:00:46.090> will<00:00:46.239> be<00:00:46.330> mixing<00:00:46.720> we<00:00:47.320> do

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:47.440 
because the inks will be mixing we do

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:48.869 
because the inks will be mixing we do
need<00:00:47.620> to<00:00:47.680> think<00:00:47.769> about<00:00:47.890> color<00:00:48.220> a<00:00:48.460> little<00:00:48.610> bit

00:00:48.869 --> 00:00:48.879 
need to think about color a little bit

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:50.310 
need to think about color a little bit
so<00:00:49.090> make<00:00:49.390> sure<00:00:49.420> you<00:00:49.600> choose<00:00:49.780> colors<00:00:50.110> that<00:00:50.230> are

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:50.320 
so make sure you choose colors that are

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.860 
so make sure you choose colors that are
analogous<00:00:50.620> that<00:00:51.070> won't<00:00:51.430> make<00:00:52.089> brown<00:00:52.420> when

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:52.870 
analogous that won't make brown when

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:54.990 
analogous that won't make brown when
they<00:00:53.019> mix<00:00:53.230> and<00:00:53.650> then<00:00:54.489> we'll<00:00:54.640> just<00:00:54.790> kind<00:00:54.910> of

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.000 
they mix and then we'll just kind of

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.400 
they mix and then we'll just kind of
make<00:00:55.180> a<00:00:55.210> hot<00:00:55.390> mess<00:00:55.600> here<00:00:55.899> and<00:00:55.930> then<00:00:56.170> we'll<00:00:56.290> let

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.410 
make a hot mess here and then we'll let

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.799 
make a hot mess here and then we'll let
all<00:00:56.590> of<00:00:56.620> the<00:00:56.800> pieces<00:00:57.610> dry<00:00:58.030> and<00:00:58.300> then<00:00:58.629> we'll

00:00:58.799 --> 00:00:58.809 
all of the pieces dry and then we'll

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:00.750 
all of the pieces dry and then we'll
make<00:00:59.230> them<00:00:59.410> into<00:00:59.620> heart<00:00:59.800> what<00:01:00.340> kind<00:01:00.489> of<00:01:00.520> paper

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 
make them into heart what kind of paper

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.100 
make them into heart what kind of paper
are<00:01:00.910> we<00:01:01.000> gonna<00:01:01.120> do<00:01:01.270> this<00:01:01.390> is<00:01:01.450> just<00:01:01.690> watercolor

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.110 
are we gonna do this is just watercolor

I do this on my wall by accident I I do
this<00:01:08.140> in<00:01:08.289> my<00:01:08.320> journal<00:01:08.680> all<00:01:08.830> the<00:01:09.009> time<00:01:09.190> and<00:01:10.180> over

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
this in my journal all the time and over

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
this in my journal all the time and over
other<00:01:10.600> backgrounds<00:01:11.050> that<00:01:11.110> I've<00:01:11.229> already

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:11.440 
other backgrounds that I've already

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.680 
other backgrounds that I've already
started<00:01:11.710> sometimes<00:01:12.700> this<00:01:12.940> is<00:01:13.210> not<00:01:13.509> the

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:13.690 
started sometimes this is not the

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:15.150 
started sometimes this is not the
foundation<00:01:13.840> like<00:01:14.470> we're<00:01:14.619> doing<00:01:14.740> now<00:01:14.860> we're

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:15.160 
foundation like we're doing now we're

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.590 
foundation like we're doing now we're
beginning<00:01:15.580> with<00:01:15.700> this<00:01:15.850> but<00:01:16.090> sometimes<00:01:16.390> I<00:01:16.539> do

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
beginning with this but sometimes I do

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.410 
beginning with this but sometimes I do
this<00:01:16.780> in<00:01:16.930> the<00:01:17.020> middle<00:01:17.110> so<00:01:17.830> this<00:01:18.700> can<00:01:19.060> actually

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:19.420 
this in the middle so this can actually

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.150 
this in the middle so this can actually
go<00:01:19.509> at<00:01:19.660> any<00:01:19.840> layer<00:01:20.140> of<00:01:20.500> your<00:01:20.740> mixed-media

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:21.160 
go at any layer of your mixed-media

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.670 
go at any layer of your mixed-media
process<00:01:21.700> so<00:01:22.390> are<00:01:22.570> you<00:01:22.690> ready<00:01:22.780> I<00:01:23.110> think<00:01:23.289> I'm

really<00:01:49.840> why<00:01:49.959> yeah<00:01:50.289> because<00:01:50.770> it<00:01:51.009> doesn't<00:01:51.220> come

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:51.340 
really why yeah because it doesn't come

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.580 
really why yeah because it doesn't come
out<00:01:51.459> okay<00:01:52.479> I<00:01:52.569> mean<00:01:52.690> it<00:01:52.780> will<00:01:52.899> eventually<00:01:53.110> it'll

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
out okay I mean it will eventually it'll

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.010 
out okay I mean it will eventually it'll
it'll<00:01:53.739> grow<00:01:54.069> out<00:01:54.250> but<00:01:54.940> it'll<00:01:55.119> come<00:01:55.330> out<00:01:55.360> so<00:01:55.780> now

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
it'll grow out but it'll come out so now
