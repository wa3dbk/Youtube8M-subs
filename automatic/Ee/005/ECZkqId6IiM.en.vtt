check<00:00:16.080> it<00:00:16.199> out<00:00:16.320> it's<00:00:16.560> all<00:00:17.359> it's<00:00:18.359> ready<00:00:25.400> today

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:38.480 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:45.619 

practice<00:00:39.480> that<00:00:39.660> we<00:00:40.350> do<00:00:41.660> a<00:00:44.480> little<00:00:45.480> bit<00:00:45.600> of

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
practice that we do a little bit of

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.150 
practice that we do a little bit of
short<00:00:46.559> video<00:00:46.770> on<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:46.920> time<00:00:48.469> basically<00:00:49.469> this

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
short video on the time basically this

00:00:50.160 --> 00:01:04.160 
short video on the time basically this
is<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.489> polymer<00:00:50.850> frame<00:01:00.770> millimeter<00:01:03.170> comes

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
is the polymer frame millimeter comes

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.480 
is the polymer frame millimeter comes
with<00:01:04.350> two<00:01:04.589> of<00:01:05.070> these<00:01:05.220> magazines<00:01:06.890> so<00:01:07.890> far<00:01:08.130> the

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
with two of these magazines so far the

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.690 
with two of these magazines so far the
only<00:01:08.520> issues<00:01:09.000> I've<00:01:09.150> had<00:01:09.360> not<00:01:09.960> clean<00:01:10.229> this<00:01:10.700> all

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:11.700 
only issues I've had not clean this all

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.240 
only issues I've had not clean this all
lubed<00:01:11.970> it<00:01:12.150> about<00:01:12.420> four<00:01:12.630> months<00:01:12.780> my<00:01:13.470> bed<00:01:13.680> so<00:01:14.159> it

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
lubed it about four months my bed so it

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.520 
lubed it about four months my bed so it
had<00:01:14.460> some<00:01:14.490> failure<00:01:15.210> to<00:01:15.450> feeds<00:01:15.840> before<00:01:16.320> that

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
had some failure to feeds before that

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.039 
had some failure to feeds before that
had<00:01:16.770> no<00:01:16.950> issues<00:01:17.400> with<00:01:17.850> the<00:01:17.909> same<00:01:18.210> same<00:01:18.689> Emily

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
had no issues with the same same Emily

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.370 
had no issues with the same same Emily
so<00:01:20.000> instead<00:01:21.000> it's<00:01:21.180> basically<00:01:21.840> maintenance

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
so instead it's basically maintenance

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.760 
so instead it's basically maintenance
issue<00:01:22.560> my<00:01:23.310> bed<00:01:23.630> but<00:01:24.630> apart<00:01:24.990> from<00:01:25.049> that<00:01:25.170> look<00:01:25.650> at

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
issue my bed but apart from that look at

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.550 
issue my bed but apart from that look at
the<00:01:25.830> accuracy<00:01:28.189> hottest<00:01:29.189> shoots<00:01:29.549> I<00:01:30.479> found<00:01:31.320> this

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
the accuracy hottest shoots I found this

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:40.670 
the accuracy hottest shoots I found this
to<00:01:31.799> have<00:01:32.009> stocky<00:01:32.310> history<00:01:39.049> and<00:01:40.049> she<00:01:40.259> finds<00:01:40.500> it

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
to have stocky history and she finds it

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.630 
to have stocky history and she finds it
also<00:01:40.920> has<00:01:41.479> lingual<00:01:42.479> now<00:01:43.070> it<00:01:44.070> could<00:01:44.369> be<00:01:44.490> because

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
also has lingual now it could be because

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.800 
also has lingual now it could be because
of<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:44.939> weight<00:01:45.119> it<00:01:45.329> could<00:01:45.479> be<00:01:45.570> a<00:01:45.600> lot<00:01:45.780> of

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
of the weight it could be a lot of

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.429 
of the weight it could be a lot of
things<00:01:47.360> we'll<00:01:48.360> see

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
things we'll see

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:50.749 
things we'll see
so<00:01:49.890> let's<00:01:50.070> have<00:01:50.159> a<00:01:50.220> look<00:01:50.369> at<00:01:50.460> a<00:01:50.490> little

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
so let's have a look at a little

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.289 
so let's have a look at a little
training<00:01:51.799> target<00:01:52.799> basically<00:01:53.549> what<00:01:54.000> we<00:01:54.119> have

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
training target basically what we have

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.480 
training target basically what we have
here<00:01:54.570> put<00:01:55.380> up<00:01:55.470> a<00:01:55.530> whole<00:01:55.710> bunch<00:01:55.950> of<00:01:56.070> these<00:01:56.219> black

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
here put up a whole bunch of these black

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.280 
here put up a whole bunch of these black
squares<00:01:56.670> and<00:01:57.180> you<00:01:57.540> try<00:01:57.719> and<00:01:57.750> get<00:01:57.960> three<00:01:58.259> shots

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
squares and you try and get three shots

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.230 
squares and you try and get three shots
through<00:01:58.920> each<00:01:59.100> one<00:01:59.340> at<00:01:59.579> whatever<00:01:59.850> distance

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
through each one at whatever distance

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.940 
through each one at whatever distance
you<00:02:00.479> want<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:00.719> put<00:02:00.869> it<00:02:00.960> in<00:02:01.079> mine<00:02:01.530> was<00:02:01.680> at<00:02:01.770> about

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
you want to put it in mine was at about

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.389 
you want to put it in mine was at about
seven<00:02:02.280> yards<00:02:03.530> 557<00:02:04.530> yards<00:02:04.759> approximately<00:02:05.759> and

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:07.399 
seven yards 557 yards approximately and

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:11.330 
seven yards 557 yards approximately and
so<00:02:08.399> it<00:02:08.550> was<00:02:08.789> slightly<00:02:09.649> all<00:02:10.649> over<00:02:11.039> the<00:02:11.129> place

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
so it was slightly all over the place

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.680 
so it was slightly all over the place
some<00:02:11.670> wind<00:02:11.879> in

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
some wind in

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.150 
some wind in
somewhere<00:02:13.690> a<00:02:13.959> little<00:02:14.380> bit<00:02:14.530> sporadic<00:02:16.800> so<00:02:17.800> not

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.160 
somewhere a little bit sporadic so not

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.440 
somewhere a little bit sporadic so not
too<00:02:18.400> far<00:02:18.430> off<00:02:18.849> and<00:02:19.060> I'm<00:02:19.150> gonna<00:02:19.270> show<00:02:19.390> you

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
too far off and I'm gonna show you

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:23.550 
too far off and I'm gonna show you
another<00:02:19.690> one<00:02:19.870> just<00:02:20.140> now<00:02:21.150> that<00:02:22.150> I<00:02:22.180> shot<00:02:22.560> which

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
another one just now that I shot which

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.020 
another one just now that I shot which
worked<00:02:23.920> a<00:02:23.980> little<00:02:24.069> better<00:02:24.250> so<00:02:24.790> I<00:02:24.819> was

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
worked a little better so I was

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.670 
worked a little better so I was
basically<00:02:25.239> still<00:02:25.870> getting<00:02:26.140> used<00:02:26.319> to<00:02:26.380> the<00:02:26.500> gun

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
basically still getting used to the gun

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.130 
basically still getting used to the gun
I<00:02:27.250> haven't<00:02:27.880> shot<00:02:28.060> in<00:02:28.180> a<00:02:28.270> while<00:02:28.450> as<00:02:28.630> well<00:02:28.870> so

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
I haven't shot in a while as well so

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:30.720 
I haven't shot in a while as well so
it's<00:02:29.590> bad<00:02:29.770> on<00:02:29.800> me<00:02:30.069> for<00:02:30.220> not<00:02:30.310> getting<00:02:30.430> enough

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
it's bad on me for not getting enough

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.240 
it's bad on me for not getting enough
training<00:02:30.970> and<00:02:31.239> practice<00:02:31.709> because<00:02:32.709> I<00:02:32.920> had<00:02:33.130> to

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
training and practice because I had to

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:34.770 
training and practice because I had to
get<00:02:33.340> rid<00:02:33.459> of<00:02:33.580> some<00:02:33.760> bad<00:02:33.910> habits<00:02:34.120> that<00:02:34.360> I<00:02:34.480> found

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780 
get rid of some bad habits that I found

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:36.780 
get rid of some bad habits that I found
so<00:02:35.260> eventually<00:02:35.620> slow<00:02:35.830> things<00:02:36.100> down<00:02:36.190> again<00:02:36.610> and

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
so eventually slow things down again and

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.729 
so eventually slow things down again and
as<00:02:36.880> soon<00:02:37.000> as<00:02:37.090> I<00:02:37.180> did<00:02:37.360> you<00:02:37.480> see<00:02:37.660> you<00:02:37.840> you<00:02:38.410> you<00:02:38.620> hit

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739 
as soon as I did you see you you you hit

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:40.500 
as soon as I did you see you you you hit
the<00:02:38.890> target<00:02:39.100> so<00:02:39.340> what<00:02:39.459> are<00:02:39.550> those<00:02:39.640> two<00:02:40.269> things

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.510 
the target so what are those two things

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.500 
the target so what are those two things
with<00:02:40.750> this<00:02:40.900> with<00:02:41.410> us<00:02:41.530> I<00:02:41.620> found<00:02:41.920> a<00:02:42.819> few<00:02:43.300> things

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
with this with us I found a few things

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.080 
with this with us I found a few things
was<00:02:43.660> trigger<00:02:43.900> control<00:02:44.310> that<00:02:45.310> was<00:02:45.400> one<00:02:45.580> when

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
was trigger control that was one when

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.789 
was trigger control that was one when
one<00:02:46.390> big<00:02:46.600> thing<00:02:46.800> the<00:02:47.800> other<00:02:47.980> was<00:02:49.590> I'm<00:02:50.590> sorry

00:02:50.789 --> 00:02:50.799 
one big thing the other was I'm sorry

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:53.130 
one big thing the other was I'm sorry
picture<00:02:51.489> focusing<00:02:52.239> on<00:02:52.360> that<00:02:52.510> front<00:02:52.750> sights<00:02:53.019> a

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
picture focusing on that front sights a

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.120 
picture focusing on that front sights a
little<00:02:53.200> bit<00:02:53.410> difficult<00:02:53.590> because<00:02:53.860> I'm<00:02:54.010> not

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
little bit difficult because I'm not

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.160 
little bit difficult because I'm not
used<00:02:54.370> to<00:02:54.430> these<00:02:54.610> sighs<00:02:54.880> I'm<00:02:55.480> used<00:02:55.690> to<00:02:55.780> two

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
used to these sighs I'm used to two

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:05.070 
used to these sighs I'm used to two
differents<00:03:01.769> a<00:03:02.769> training<00:03:03.760> thing<00:03:03.940> you<00:03:04.030> know<00:03:04.840> I

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:05.080 
differents a training thing you know I

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.479 
differents a training thing you know I
shot<00:03:05.920> about<00:03:06.340> 15<00:03:06.959> so<00:03:07.959> I<00:03:08.019> figure<00:03:08.560> out<00:03:08.709> through

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
shot about 15 so I figure out through

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:11.789 
shot about 15 so I figure out through
the<00:03:09.610> middle<00:03:09.850> put<00:03:10.810> a<00:03:10.840> little<00:03:11.080> sway<00:03:11.590> in<00:03:11.709> the

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:11.799 
the middle put a little sway in the

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:13.470 
the middle put a little sway in the
middle<00:03:11.980> and<00:03:12.100> you<00:03:12.160> can<00:03:12.220> see<00:03:12.489> basically<00:03:13.030> where

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
middle and you can see basically where

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.449 
middle and you can see basically where
we're<00:03:14.110> the<00:03:14.290> rounds<00:03:14.590> went<00:03:14.739> and<00:03:14.980> this<00:03:15.069> is<00:03:15.220> also

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:15.459 
we're the rounds went and this is also

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:16.860 
we're the rounds went and this is also
including<00:03:15.850> another<00:03:16.030> 30<00:03:16.360> rounds<00:03:16.660> from<00:03:16.780> the

including another 30 rounds from the
clock<00:03:17.140> there's<00:03:17.709> 30<00:03:17.950> rounds<00:03:18.370> of<00:03:18.519> Glock<00:03:18.850> 19<00:03:19.690> and

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
clock there's 30 rounds of Glock 19 and

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:21.870 
clock there's 30 rounds of Glock 19 and
30<00:03:20.019> rounds<00:03:20.320> these<00:03:20.440> Eagle<00:03:20.859> and<00:03:21.040> these<00:03:21.579> are<00:03:21.760> the

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
30 rounds these Eagle and these are the

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.390 
30 rounds these Eagle and these are the
last<00:03:22.150> after<00:03:23.079> these<00:03:23.230> ones<00:03:23.500> way<00:03:23.920> I<00:03:23.950> started

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:24.400 
last after these ones way I started

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:25.289 
last after these ones way I started
getting<00:03:24.549> a<00:03:24.579> little<00:03:24.640> bit<00:03:24.820> more<00:03:24.970> comfortable

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:25.299 
getting a little bit more comfortable

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:27.720 
getting a little bit more comfortable
getting<00:03:25.989> rid<00:03:26.200> of<00:03:26.230> all<00:03:26.410> those<00:03:26.500> bad<00:03:26.709> habits<00:03:26.769> so

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
getting rid of all those bad habits so

00:03:27.730 --> 00:04:06.050 
getting rid of all those bad habits so
not<00:03:28.090> too<00:03:28.269> not<00:03:28.630> too<00:03:28.690> bad

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:11.130 

so<00:04:07.060> basically<00:04:07.570> overall<00:04:09.540> comfortable<00:04:10.540> I<00:04:10.720> would

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
so basically overall comfortable I would

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.260 
so basically overall comfortable I would
say<00:04:11.440> maybe<00:04:11.680> get<00:04:11.950> a<00:04:12.190> little<00:04:12.250> bit<00:04:12.459> of<00:04:12.550> stippling

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:13.270 
say maybe get a little bit of stippling

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:24.810 
say maybe get a little bit of stippling
done<00:04:18.120> is<00:04:19.120> very<00:04:19.150> comfortable<00:04:23.820> basically

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:24.820 
done is very comfortable basically

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.270 
done is very comfortable basically
that's<00:04:25.510> it<00:04:26.230> on<00:04:26.380> that<00:04:26.560> I<00:04:26.770> don't<00:04:27.040> think<00:04:27.160> I<00:04:27.220> don't

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
that's it on that I don't think I don't

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.970 
that's it on that I don't think I don't
like<00:04:27.580> is<00:04:27.820> this<00:04:28.030> little<00:04:28.360> deep<00:04:29.110> cock<00:04:29.380> safety

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:29.980 
like is this little deep cock safety

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:31.560 
like is this little deep cock safety
mechanism<00:04:30.520> sitting<00:04:30.820> on<00:04:30.970> the<00:04:31.150> slide<00:04:31.390> because

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:31.570 
mechanism sitting on the slide because

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:33.360 
mechanism sitting on the slide because
now<00:04:31.930> what<00:04:32.380> we're<00:04:32.560> used<00:04:32.770> to<00:04:32.860> is<00:04:33.010> basically

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
now what we're used to is basically

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:34.830 
now what we're used to is basically
getting<00:04:33.580> your<00:04:33.760> hand<00:04:33.940> grabbing<00:04:34.419> the<00:04:34.510> top<00:04:34.660> of

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
getting your hand grabbing the top of

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.860 
getting your hand grabbing the top of
the<00:04:34.930> of<00:04:35.080> the<00:04:35.560> of<00:04:35.950> the<00:04:36.250> slot<00:04:36.790> and<00:04:37.000> then<00:04:37.450> racking

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
the of the of the slot and then racking

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.659 
the of the of the slot and then racking
it<00:04:37.960> back<00:04:38.169> now<00:04:38.410> it<00:04:38.860> becomes<00:04:39.250> very<00:04:39.400> difficult

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:39.669 
it back now it becomes very difficult

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:41.550 
it back now it becomes very difficult
with<00:04:40.090> this<00:04:40.270> you'd<00:04:40.600> think<00:04:40.870> that<00:04:41.110> it<00:04:41.230> gives<00:04:41.440> you

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
with this you'd think that it gives you

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:44.120 
with this you'd think that it gives you
more<00:04:41.680> grip<00:04:41.950> but<00:04:42.100> it<00:04:42.190> actually<00:04:42.400> it<00:04:43.090> actually

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.130 
more grip but it actually it actually

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.159 
more grip but it actually it actually
gets<00:04:45.130> in<00:04:45.280> the<00:04:45.400> way<00:04:45.550> in<00:04:45.850> a<00:04:45.940> sense<00:04:46.180> so<00:04:46.390> it's<00:04:46.720> it's

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:47.169 
gets in the way in a sense so it's it's

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:49.080 
gets in the way in a sense so it's it's
not<00:04:47.650> the<00:04:47.830> best<00:04:47.980> thing<00:04:48.250> there<00:04:48.520> what<00:04:49.000> I've

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:49.090 
not the best thing there what I've

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:51.210 
not the best thing there what I've
actually<00:04:49.270> found<00:04:49.660> that<00:04:49.840> up<00:04:49.990> actually<00:04:50.290> what

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:51.220 
actually found that up actually what

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:58.710 
actually found that up actually what
I've<00:04:51.310> found<00:04:55.890> is<00:04:56.890> instead<00:04:57.280> of<00:04:57.370> doing<00:04:57.640> this<00:04:57.910> is<00:04:58.300> I

00:04:58.710 --> 00:04:58.720 
I've found is instead of doing this is I

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.530 
I've found is instead of doing this is I
will<00:04:58.840> come<00:04:59.140> over<00:04:59.440> and<00:05:00.090> grab<00:05:01.090> it<00:05:01.210> with<00:05:01.390> two

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:01.540 
will come over and grab it with two

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:10.110 
will come over and grab it with two
fingers<00:05:07.290> all<00:05:08.290> right<00:05:08.470> but<00:05:08.830> that's<00:05:09.550> not<00:05:09.729> really

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:10.120 
fingers all right but that's not really

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.140 
fingers all right but that's not really
what<00:05:10.270> I<00:05:10.330> want<00:05:10.479> to<00:05:10.540> do<00:05:10.660> with<00:05:10.810> it<00:05:10.840> so<00:05:11.140> I<00:05:11.350> went<00:05:11.680> back

like the block so something to think

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:26.240 
like the block so something to think
about

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.250 
about

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:28.380

you look very closely you got your
you've<00:05:38.710> got<00:05:38.950> the<00:05:39.190> firing<00:05:39.730> pin<00:05:39.940> sitting<00:05:40.240> over

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:40.480 
you've got the firing pin sitting over

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:43.650 
you've got the firing pin sitting over
there<00:05:40.660> and<00:05:41.260> if<00:05:41.800> you<00:05:42.430> d<00:05:42.880> cock<00:05:43.180> and<00:05:43.450> I'm<00:05:43.570> gonna

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:43.660 
there and if you d cock and I'm gonna

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:45.510 
there and if you d cock and I'm gonna
hold<00:05:43.930> the<00:05:44.140> hammer<00:05:44.410> back<00:05:44.680> you<00:05:45.160> can<00:05:45.340> see<00:05:45.490> that

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:45.520 
hold the hammer back you can see that

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.180 
hold the hammer back you can see that
the<00:05:45.760> fire<00:05:45.970> pin<00:05:46.180> is<00:05:46.300> now<00:05:46.420> moved<00:05:46.750> in<00:05:47.020> so<00:05:47.920> that<00:05:48.070> the

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:48.190 
the fire pin is now moved in so that the

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:53.820 
the fire pin is now moved in so that the
hammer<00:05:48.370> cannot<00:05:50.310> cannot<00:05:51.310> hit<00:05:51.610> the<00:05:52.470> the<00:05:53.470> firing

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:53.830 
hammer cannot cannot hit the the firing

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:59.220 
hammer cannot cannot hit the the firing
pin<00:05:54.240> so<00:05:55.240> basically<00:05:57.240> it's<00:05:58.240> again<00:05:58.810> it's<00:05:58.840> not

00:05:59.220 --> 00:05:59.230 
pin so basically it's again it's not

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:01.370 
pin so basically it's again it's not
gonna<00:05:59.380> it's<00:05:59.680> not<00:05:59.740> gonna<00:05:59.860> go<00:06:00.100> off<00:06:00.250> backs<00:06:00.460> off
