about<00:01:29.740> the<00:01:30.130> TX<00:01:30.520> is<00:01:30.820> that<00:01:31.720> it<00:01:31.900> actually<00:01:32.080> shows

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:32.560 
about the TX is that it actually shows

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.220 
about the TX is that it actually shows

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
where the Skyport you just kind of have

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.790 
where the Skyport you just kind of have
to<00:01:39.700> guess<00:01:40.000> or<00:01:40.270> go<00:01:41.050> over<00:01:41.200> to<00:01:41.320> your<00:01:41.440> back<00:01:41.560> and

settings<00:02:50.700> and<00:02:50.910> we'll<00:02:51.030> just<00:02:51.209> do<00:02:51.840> another<00:02:52.049> pop

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
settings and we'll just do another pop

00:02:52.319 --> 00:03:00.250 
settings and we'll just do another pop
test<00:02:52.590> so<00:02:52.739> you<00:02:52.829> can<00:02:52.950> kind<00:02:53.130> of<00:02:53.190> hear<00:02:53.310> the<00:02:53.700> beeps

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.370 

now<00:03:01.260> that<00:03:01.410> we<00:03:01.500> went<00:03:01.709> over<00:03:01.860> the<00:03:02.310> top<00:03:02.519> of<00:03:02.579> the

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:03.380 
now that we went over the top of the

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.460 
now that we went over the top of the
these<00:03:04.380> two<00:03:04.590> units<00:03:04.920> we'll<00:03:05.130> go<00:03:05.310> into<00:03:05.489> the<00:03:05.760> packs

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
these two units we'll go into the packs

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.210 
these two units we'll go into the packs
so<00:03:07.470> I'll<00:03:07.560> be<00:03:07.680> right<00:03:07.860> back<00:03:09.890> okay<00:03:10.890> here<00:03:11.099> we're

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
so I'll be right back okay here we're

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:14.050 
so I'll be right back okay here we're
back<00:03:11.370> now<00:03:11.640> with<00:03:11.880> the<00:03:11.970> packs<00:03:12.180> up<00:03:12.450> on<00:03:12.599> the<00:03:12.720> table

you can see the CL 600 is a little bit

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:25.930 
you can see the CL 600 is a little bit

to come back and I'm going to do some

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:45.260 
to come back and I'm going to do some
test<00:04:41.340> firing<00:04:41.820> with<00:04:42.510> a<00:04:42.540> cl600<00:04:44.060> alright<00:04:45.060> now<00:04:45.210> we

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:45.270 
test firing with a cl600 alright now we

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:48.440 
test firing with a cl600 alright now we
have<00:04:45.360> the<00:04:45.510> flash<00:04:45.750> set<00:04:45.990> up<00:04:46.140> and<00:04:46.740> we<00:04:46.980> have<00:04:47.130> it<00:04:47.450> the

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:48.450 
have the flash set up and we have it the

00:04:48.450 --> 00:04:50.270 
have the flash set up and we have it the

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:27.820 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:30.070 

hopefully<00:05:28.820> that's<00:05:29.000> enough<00:05:29.090> test-firing<00:05:29.870> for

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:30.080 
hopefully that's enough test-firing for

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:34.840 
hopefully that's enough test-firing for
you<00:05:30.230> every<00:05:31.040> single<00:05:31.460> shot<00:05:32.270> the<00:05:33.139> camera<00:05:33.670> kept<00:05:34.670> up

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:34.850 
you every single shot the camera kept up

00:05:34.850 --> 00:05:36.400 
you every single shot the camera kept up
with<00:05:34.880> the<00:05:35.090> flash<00:05:35.330> and<00:05:35.660> the<00:05:35.720> flash<00:05:35.930> kept<00:05:36.230> up

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:36.410 
with the flash and the flash kept up

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:38.650 
with the flash and the flash kept up
with<00:05:36.440> the<00:05:36.650> camera<00:05:37.030> that's<00:05:38.030> a<00:05:38.210> super<00:05:38.510> nice

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:38.660
