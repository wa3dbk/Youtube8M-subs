00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.060 
in your Holly a few people requested
this<00:00:12.450> tutorial<00:00:13.019> and<00:00:13.170> actually<00:00:13.620> a<00:00:13.650> friend<00:00:13.980> of

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
this tutorial and actually a friend of

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.640 
this tutorial and actually a friend of
ours<00:00:14.400> sapphire<00:00:14.969> he<00:00:15.660> wanted<00:00:15.990> to<00:00:16.049> upload<00:00:16.379> this

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
ours sapphire he wanted to upload this

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.470 
ours sapphire he wanted to upload this
tutorial<00:00:17.160> but<00:00:17.369> he<00:00:17.460> asked<00:00:17.820> us<00:00:17.940> whether<00:00:18.180> or<00:00:18.359> not

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
tutorial but he asked us whether or not

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:21.140 
tutorial but he asked us whether or not
we<00:00:18.720> were<00:00:18.869> not<00:00:19.020> interested<00:00:19.340> we<00:00:20.340> said<00:00:20.580> yes<00:00:20.789> so

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
we were not interested we said yes so

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.679 
we were not interested we said yes so
here<00:00:21.539> it<00:00:21.660> is<00:00:22.699> circling<00:00:23.699> makes<00:00:23.939> things<00:00:24.210> a<00:00:24.390> lot

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
here it is circling makes things a lot

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.080 
here it is circling makes things a lot
easier<00:00:24.949> it<00:00:25.949> allows<00:00:26.279> you<00:00:26.430> to<00:00:26.550> kill<00:00:26.760> your<00:00:26.849> target

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
easier it allows you to kill your target

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.109 
easier it allows you to kill your target
accurately<00:00:27.480> so<00:00:28.320> first<00:00:28.769> things<00:00:28.949> first<00:00:29.070> we<00:00:29.910> want

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
accurately so first things first we want

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.089 
accurately so first things first we want
to<00:00:30.269> switch<00:00:30.390> our<00:00:30.689> view<00:00:30.840> to<00:00:31.080> first-person<00:00:32.070> view

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
to switch our view to first-person view

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.790 
to switch our view to first-person view
you<00:00:32.910> can<00:00:33.210> circle<00:00:33.540> and<00:00:33.809> third<00:00:33.960> person<00:00:34.380> view<00:00:34.500> but

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
you can circle and third person view but

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.319 
you can circle and third person view but
first<00:00:35.160> person<00:00:35.579> view<00:00:35.670> gives<00:00:35.910> you<00:00:36.030> a<00:00:36.059> better

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
first person view gives you a better

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.630 
first person view gives you a better
view<00:00:36.450> at<00:00:36.719> your<00:00:36.870> target<00:00:37.380> to<00:00:38.100> switch<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.489> first

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
view at your target to switch the first

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.700 
view at your target to switch the first
person<00:00:39.059> view<00:00:39.180> we<00:00:39.480> are<00:00:39.570> going<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:40.020> hit<00:00:40.200> select<00:00:40.590> a

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
person view we are going to hit select a

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.670 
person view we are going to hit select a
couple<00:00:40.920> of<00:00:41.129> times<00:00:42.770> okay<00:00:43.770> good<00:00:44.250> done<00:00:44.969> now<00:00:45.680> we're

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
couple of times okay good done now we're

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.520 
couple of times okay good done now we're
going<00:00:46.860> to<00:00:46.950> get<00:00:47.100> some<00:00:47.340> altitude<00:00:47.840> hit<00:00:48.840> R<00:00:48.989> to<00:00:49.379> go

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
going to get some altitude hit R to go

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.680 
going to get some altitude hit R to go
up<00:00:49.680> we<00:00:50.399> don't<00:00:50.550> want<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:50.850> be<00:00:50.969> too<00:00:51.180> far<00:00:51.449> away<00:00:51.600> from

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
up we don't want to be too far away from

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.270 
up we don't want to be too far away from
the<00:00:51.899> target<00:00:52.140> so<00:00:52.500> that<00:00:52.530> they're<00:00:52.860> out<00:00:53.010> of<00:00:53.039> range

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
the target so that they're out of range

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.189 
the target so that they're out of range
but<00:00:53.969> we<00:00:54.120> also<00:00:54.390> don't<00:00:54.690> want<00:00:54.719> to<00:00:54.840> be<00:00:54.960> too<00:00:55.170> close

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
but we also don't want to be too close

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.080 
but we also don't want to be too close
to<00:00:55.710> them<00:00:55.829> so<00:00:56.010> that<00:00:56.160> we're<00:00:56.340> going<00:00:56.550> to<00:00:56.670> get<00:00:56.789> shut

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
to them so that we're going to get shut

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.479 
to them so that we're going to get shut
out<00:00:57.120> that'll<00:00:57.750> be<00:00:57.870> bad<00:00:58.190> you'll<00:00:59.190> learn<00:00:59.309> your

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
out that'll be bad you'll learn your

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:02.150 
out that'll be bad you'll learn your
range<00:00:59.730> with<00:00:59.910> practice<00:01:00.590> to<00:01:01.590> keep<00:01:01.739> our<00:01:01.949> height

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
range with practice to keep our height

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.039 
range with practice to keep our height
we'll<00:01:02.489> have<00:01:02.730> to<00:01:02.940> let<00:01:03.059> go<00:01:03.090> of<00:01:03.359> our<00:01:03.510> two<00:01:03.750> and<00:01:03.930> then

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
we'll have to let go of our two and then

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.109 
we'll have to let go of our two and then
hit<00:01:04.260> it<00:01:04.379> again<00:01:04.710> you'll<00:01:05.280> have<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:05.790> keep<00:01:05.970> on

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
hit it again you'll have to keep on

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.679 
hit it again you'll have to keep on
doing<00:01:06.150> that<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.689> keep<00:01:06.930> the<00:01:07.080> height<00:01:08.390> it's<00:01:09.390> going

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
doing that to keep the height it's going

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.600 
doing that to keep the height it's going
to<00:01:09.840> get<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.020> bit<00:01:10.290> tricky<00:01:10.500> now<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:11.100> probably<00:01:11.580> a

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
to get a bit tricky now and probably a

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.060 
to get a bit tricky now and probably a
lot<00:01:11.850> of<00:01:12.000> people<00:01:12.299> would<00:01:12.450> get<00:01:12.659> confused<00:01:13.140> but<00:01:13.890> you

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
lot of people would get confused but you

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.460 
lot of people would get confused but you
could<00:01:14.220> use<00:01:14.430> that<00:01:14.670> so<00:01:14.880> don't<00:01:15.060> worry<00:01:15.229> now<00:01:16.229> we're

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
could use that so don't worry now we're

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.410 
could use that so don't worry now we're
going<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:16.740> start<00:01:17.009> circling<00:01:17.430> and<00:01:17.939> for<00:01:18.119> that<00:01:18.240> to

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
going to start circling and for that to

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.050 
going to start circling and for that to
happen<00:01:18.659> we<00:01:19.080> need<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.770> left<00:01:20.100> analog<00:01:20.310> stick<00:01:20.549> and

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
happen we need the left analog stick and

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.499 
happen we need the left analog stick and
either<00:01:21.659> l1<00:01:22.560> or<00:01:22.740> r1<00:01:23.270> depending<00:01:24.270> on<00:01:24.360> which

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
either l1 or r1 depending on which

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.929 
either l1 or r1 depending on which
button<00:01:24.750> you<00:01:25.020> use<00:01:25.110> you<00:01:25.799> either<00:01:26.040> circle<00:01:26.729> to<00:01:26.820> the

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
button you use you either circle to the

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.600 
button you use you either circle to the
left<00:01:26.970> that's<00:01:27.570> our<00:01:27.810> one<00:01:28.049> also<00:01:28.619> go<00:01:29.159> to<00:01:29.280> the<00:01:29.430> right

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
left that's our one also go to the right

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.749 
left that's our one also go to the right
which<00:01:29.939> is<00:01:29.970> l1<00:01:30.720> I<00:01:30.960> use<00:01:31.799> all<00:01:32.040> one<00:01:32.189> mostly<00:01:32.520> so

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
which is l1 I use all one mostly so

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.460 
which is l1 I use all one mostly so
that's<00:01:32.970> what<00:01:33.090> I'm<00:01:33.180> going<00:01:33.329> to<00:01:33.540> use<00:01:33.689> now<00:01:33.930> as<00:01:34.110> well

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
that's what I'm going to use now as well

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.069 
that's what I'm going to use now as well
and<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:35.490> circle<00:01:35.880> you<00:01:36.030> have<00:01:36.270> to<00:01:36.450> continuously

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
and to circle you have to continuously

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.880 
and to circle you have to continuously
tap<00:01:37.500> l1<00:01:38.159> or<00:01:38.340> r1<00:01:38.990> that<00:01:39.990> alone<00:01:40.350> won't<00:01:40.560> do<00:01:40.740> it

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
tap l1 or r1 that alone won't do it

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.170 
tap l1 or r1 that alone won't do it
though<00:01:41.040> because<00:01:41.280> that<00:01:41.520> will<00:01:41.820> just<00:01:41.970> make<00:01:42.030> it

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
though because that will just make it

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.749 
though because that will just make it
spin<00:01:42.540> in<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.869> air<00:01:42.990> so<00:01:43.740> you<00:01:43.799> will<00:01:44.100> have<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.610> move

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
spin in the air so you will have to move

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.730 
spin in the air so you will have to move
the<00:01:44.939> left<00:01:45.240> analog<00:01:45.540> stick<00:01:45.720> a<00:01:45.990> bit<00:01:46.380> forward

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
the left analog stick a bit forward

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:49.010 
the left analog stick a bit forward
don't<00:01:47.579> tilt<00:01:47.759> it<00:01:47.850> forward<00:01:47.909> too<00:01:48.360> much<00:01:48.390> though<00:01:48.810> or

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
don't tilt it forward too much though or

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.109 
don't tilt it forward too much though or
your<00:01:49.140> heli<00:01:49.380> will<00:01:49.619> move<00:01:49.770> forward<00:01:50.100> just<00:01:50.460> move<00:01:51.000> it

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
your heli will move forward just move it

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.230 
your heli will move forward just move it
enough<00:01:51.390> so<00:01:51.540> that<00:01:51.570> you're<00:01:51.840> still<00:01:52.140> circling

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
enough so that you're still circling

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.940 
enough so that you're still circling
what<00:01:54.240> I'm<00:01:54.360> doing<00:01:54.630> now<00:01:54.840> is<00:01:54.869> I'm<00:01:55.259> holding<00:01:55.680> a

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
what I'm doing now is I'm holding a

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.760 
what I'm doing now is I'm holding a
letting<00:01:56.280> go<00:01:56.399> of<00:01:56.430> r2<00:01:57.030> as<00:01:57.180> needed<00:01:57.689> I<00:01:57.899> am<00:01:58.409> tapping

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
letting go of r2 as needed I am tapping

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.010 
letting go of r2 as needed I am tapping
on<00:01:59.159> one<00:01:59.340> and<00:01:59.610> my<00:01:59.700> analog<00:02:00.090> stick<00:02:00.360> is<00:02:00.390> tilted<00:02:00.930> a

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
on one and my analog stick is tilted a

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.289 
on one and my analog stick is tilted a
bit<00:02:01.320> forward<00:02:01.619> you<00:02:02.369> really<00:02:02.790> have<00:02:03.000> to<00:02:03.149> practice

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
bit forward you really have to practice

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:05.690 
bit forward you really have to practice
to<00:02:03.719> get<00:02:03.869> this<00:02:04.020> down<00:02:04.290> it's<00:02:04.829> quite<00:02:05.100> difficult<00:02:05.369> at

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
to get this down it's quite difficult at

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.310 
to get this down it's quite difficult at
first<00:02:05.729> but<00:02:06.240> once<00:02:06.479> you<00:02:06.570> get<00:02:06.719> the<00:02:06.840> hang<00:02:06.869> of<00:02:07.170> it

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
first but once you get the hang of it

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.910 
first but once you get the hang of it
it'll<00:02:07.590> be<00:02:07.829> super<00:02:08.160> easy<00:02:08.520> trust<00:02:09.090> me<00:02:09.379> so<00:02:10.379> get<00:02:10.770> your

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
it'll be super easy trust me so get your

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.210 
it'll be super easy trust me so get your
circling<00:02:11.459> down<00:02:11.640> first

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
circling down first

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.490 
circling down first
circle<00:02:13.060> around<00:02:13.150> things<00:02:13.660> and<00:02:13.990> try<00:02:14.170> to<00:02:14.200> keep

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
circle around things and try to keep

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.470 
circle around things and try to keep
them<00:02:14.680> in<00:02:14.800> your<00:02:14.830> view<00:02:15.160> and<00:02:15.370> when<00:02:15.910> you<00:02:16.030> think<00:02:16.330> is

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
them in your view and when you think is

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:17.760 
them in your view and when you think is
circling<00:02:16.960> is<00:02:17.080> perfect

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
circling is perfect

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.920 
circling is perfect
you<00:02:17.920> can<00:02:18.100> try<00:02:18.370> and<00:02:18.610> shoot<00:02:18.850> so<00:02:19.420> just<00:02:19.630> hold<00:02:19.840> down

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
you can try and shoot so just hold down

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.500 
you can try and shoot so just hold down
X<00:02:20.370> this<00:02:21.370> might<00:02:21.670> throw<00:02:21.940> you<00:02:21.970> off<00:02:22.150> at<00:02:22.330> first

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:22.510 
X this might throw you off at first

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:24.270 
X this might throw you off at first
because<00:02:22.780> now<00:02:23.110> you're<00:02:23.290> hitting<00:02:23.440> flop<00:02:23.890> buttons

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280 
because now you're hitting flop buttons

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.880 
because now you're hitting flop buttons
at<00:02:24.430> the<00:02:24.460> same<00:02:24.580> time<00:02:25.230> but<00:02:26.230> practice<00:02:26.860> makes

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
at the same time but practice makes

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.130 
at the same time but practice makes
perfect<00:02:27.280> and<00:02:27.760> practice<00:02:28.240> is<00:02:28.360> also<00:02:28.630> going<00:02:28.960> to

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
perfect and practice is also going to

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:31.230 
perfect and practice is also going to
help<00:02:29.410> you<00:02:29.560> to<00:02:29.710> learn<00:02:29.920> to<00:02:30.100> aim<00:02:30.250> properly<00:02:30.700> and

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
help you to learn to aim properly and

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.600 
help you to learn to aim properly and
that's<00:02:31.900> really<00:02:32.320> there<00:02:32.500> is<00:02:32.650> two<00:02:32.890> circling

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
that's really there is two circling

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.520 
that's really there is two circling
so<00:02:34.150> hopefully<00:02:34.540> this<00:02:34.930> tutorial<00:02:35.080> was<00:02:35.500> helpful
