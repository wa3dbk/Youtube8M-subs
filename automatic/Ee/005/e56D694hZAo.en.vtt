00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.520 
personally just flip him back and forth
I<00:01:38.610> like<00:01:38.759> both<00:01:39.000> modes<00:01:41.810> next<00:01:42.810> up<00:01:42.899> is<00:01:43.020> command

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
I like both modes next up is command

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.830 
I like both modes next up is command
wolf<00:01:43.860> now<00:01:44.220> this<00:01:44.399> guy<00:01:44.579> was<00:01:44.850> used<00:01:45.180> quite<00:01:45.540> a<00:01:45.689> bit

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
wolf now this guy was used quite a bit

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.679 
wolf now this guy was used quite a bit
in<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.409> show<00:01:46.619> I<00:01:46.920> believe<00:01:47.610> a<00:01:47.640> curvy<00:01:48.360> line<00:01:48.509> was

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
in the show I believe a curvy line was

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.090 
in the show I believe a curvy line was
at<00:01:48.810> his<00:01:48.960> name<00:01:49.140> I<00:01:49.320> believe<00:01:49.560> this<00:01:49.740> is<00:01:49.799> his

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
at his name I believe this is his

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.280 
at his name I believe this is his
primary<00:01:50.670> unit<00:01:51.030> for<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.780> beginning<00:01:52.020> of<00:01:52.200> the

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
primary unit for the beginning of the

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.230 
primary unit for the beginning of the
show<00:01:52.470> now<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.250> command<00:01:53.520> wolf<00:01:53.729> is<00:01:53.909> one<00:01:54.060> of<00:01:54.180> the

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
show now the command wolf is one of the

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.959 
show now the command wolf is one of the
most<00:01:54.420> versatile<00:01:54.869> II<00:01:54.990> used<00:01:55.380> of<00:01:55.619> Zoids<00:01:56.130> of<00:01:56.490> all

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
most versatile II used of Zoids of all

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:59.179 
most versatile II used of Zoids of all
time<00:01:57.270> I<00:01:57.299> think<00:01:57.659> because<00:01:58.200> it<00:01:58.350> can<00:01:58.500> fit<00:01:58.770> a<00:01:58.799> lot<00:01:58.950> of

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
time I think because it can fit a lot of

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.370 
time I think because it can fit a lot of
different<00:01:59.610> things<00:01:59.820> on<00:02:00.000> its<00:02:00.149> back<00:02:00.360> now<00:02:01.170> this

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
different things on its back now this

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.560 
different things on its back now this
figure<00:02:01.649> does<00:02:01.799> come<00:02:02.430> with<00:02:02.700> not<00:02:02.969> only<00:02:03.030> this

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
figure does come with not only this

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.530 
figure does come with not only this
giant<00:02:04.500> cannon<00:02:04.890> but<00:02:05.040> a<00:02:05.070> smaller<00:02:05.490> cannon<00:02:06.060> that<00:02:06.509> a

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
giant cannon but a smaller cannon that a

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.690 
giant cannon but a smaller cannon that a
little<00:02:06.840> figure<00:02:07.170> can<00:02:07.409> fit<00:02:07.680> in<00:02:07.860> unfortunately<00:02:08.550> I

it's<00:04:18.169> used<00:04:18.650> a<00:04:18.799> couple<00:04:19.070> of<00:04:19.280> different<00:04:19.639> times

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850 
it's used a couple of different times

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:22.690 
it's used a couple of different times
throughout<00:04:20.299> the<00:04:20.570> different<00:04:21.109> series<00:04:21.709> and<00:04:21.950> it

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:22.700 
throughout the different series and it

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:27.879 
throughout the different series and it
was<00:04:22.880> actually<00:04:23.120> used<00:04:23.750> as<00:04:24.250> a<00:04:25.250> space<00:04:26.210> flight<00:04:26.990> unit

00:04:27.879 --> 00:04:27.889 
was actually used as a space flight unit

00:04:27.889 --> 00:04:30.820 
was actually used as a space flight unit
in<00:04:28.210> universal<00:04:29.210> century<00:04:29.600> but<00:04:29.840> those<00:04:30.470> units

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.830 
in universal century but those units

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:37.930 
in universal century but those units
were<00:04:30.979> white<00:04:36.460> unfortunately<00:04:37.460> I<00:04:37.490> don't<00:04:37.610> really

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:37.940 
were white unfortunately I don't really

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:39.670 
were white unfortunately I don't really
care<00:04:38.240> for<00:04:38.300> the<00:04:38.570> flying<00:04:38.960> units<00:04:39.440> or<00:04:39.650> the

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 
care for the flying units or the

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.940 
care for the flying units or the
terrorsaur<00:04:40.610> based<00:04:40.970> units<00:04:41.450> because<00:04:42.200> once<00:04:42.710> you

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:42.950 
terrorsaur based units because once you

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:44.980 
terrorsaur based units because once you
wind<00:04:43.520> them<00:04:43.790> up<00:04:43.910> they're<00:04:44.600> not<00:04:44.810> that

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:44.990 
wind them up they're not that

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:48.090 
wind them up they're not that
interesting<00:04:45.710> it<00:04:45.919> all<00:04:46.070> really<00:04:46.780> unfortunately

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:48.100 
interesting it all really unfortunately

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.610 
interesting it all really unfortunately
you<00:04:49.100> see<00:04:49.310> just<00:04:49.669> barely<00:04:50.180> moves<00:04:50.900> and<00:04:51.200> I<00:04:51.260> have<00:04:51.470> to

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:51.620 
you see just barely moves and I have to

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.560 
you see just barely moves and I have to
push<00:04:51.889> him<00:04:52.160> in<00:04:52.700> order<00:04:52.850> to<00:04:53.030> get<00:04:53.180> him<00:04:53.300> to<00:04:53.360> move

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:53.570 
push him in order to get him to move

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:56.590 
push him in order to get him to move
sometimes<00:04:54.139> especially<00:04:54.440> on<00:04:54.830> my<00:04:55.130> backdrop<00:04:55.850> but

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:56.600 
sometimes especially on my backdrop but

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:58.900 
sometimes especially on my backdrop but
if<00:04:56.690> you<00:04:56.810> have<00:04:56.930> it<00:04:57.050> on<00:04:57.139> a<00:04:57.200> very<00:04:57.830> slick<00:04:58.340> surface

00:04:58.900 --> 00:04:58.910 
if you have it on a very slick surface

00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:02.080 
if you have it on a very slick surface
he's<00:04:59.389> not<00:04:59.780> going<00:05:00.260> anywhere<00:05:00.850> though<00:05:01.850> I<00:05:01.970> think

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.090 
he's not going anywhere though I think

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:03.760 
he's not going anywhere though I think
you<00:05:02.360> could<00:05:02.510> fix<00:05:02.720> that<00:05:02.900> with<00:05:03.110> maybe<00:05:03.320> just<00:05:03.440> some

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:03.770 
you could fix that with maybe just some

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:05.980 
you could fix that with maybe just some
little<00:05:04.070> rubber<00:05:04.310> pieces<00:05:05.150> to<00:05:05.330> plug<00:05:05.540> onto<00:05:05.780> his

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:05.990 
little rubber pieces to plug onto his

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.650 
little rubber pieces to plug onto his
feet<00:05:06.590> and<00:05:06.800> again<00:05:07.430> he's<00:05:07.610> piloted<00:05:08.180> from<00:05:08.510> the

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:08.660 
feet and again he's piloted from the

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:15.660 
feet and again he's piloted from the
head

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:15.670 

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:18.100 

next<00:05:16.670> up<00:05:16.760> is<00:05:16.880> war<00:05:17.150> shark<00:05:17.510> one<00:05:17.780> of<00:05:17.870> the<00:05:17.930> more

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:18.110 
next up is war shark one of the more

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:19.570 
next up is war shark one of the more
interesting<00:05:18.590> units<00:05:19.160> one<00:05:19.310> of<00:05:19.400> the<00:05:19.460> only

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:19.580 
interesting units one of the only

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.570 
interesting units one of the only
aquatic<00:05:20.240> zode<00:05:20.570> units<00:05:21.050> now<00:05:21.620> in<00:05:21.920> the<00:05:22.040> show<00:05:22.280> I

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:22.580 
aquatic zode units now in the show I

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:23.980 
aquatic zode units now in the show I
think<00:05:22.700> it<00:05:22.940> was<00:05:23.030> the<00:05:23.090> universal<00:05:23.540> century<00:05:23.690> you

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:23.990 
think it was the universal century you

00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.140 
think it was the universal century you
actually<00:05:24.350> saw<00:05:24.530> this<00:05:24.680> guy<00:05:24.830> swimming<00:05:25.340> in<00:05:25.610> sand

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:26.150 
actually saw this guy swimming in sand

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:29.440 
actually saw this guy swimming in sand
in<00:05:26.780> the<00:05:26.960> desert<00:05:27.340> which<00:05:28.340> was<00:05:28.550> pretty<00:05:28.820> cool<00:05:29.060> but

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:29.450 
in the desert which was pretty cool but

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:40.210 
in the desert which was pretty cool but
hey<00:05:31.600> it's<00:05:32.600> liquid<00:05:33.200> d<00:05:34.190> ish<00:05:34.639> right<00:05:38.889> sadly<00:05:39.889> he<00:05:40.070> is

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:40.220 
hey it's liquid d ish right sadly he is

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:42.580 
hey it's liquid d ish right sadly he is
the<00:05:40.400> most<00:05:40.580> goofy<00:05:41.150> looking<00:05:41.510> when<00:05:41.720> you<00:05:41.840> do<00:05:42.050> get

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:42.590 
the most goofy looking when you do get

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:53.350 
the most goofy looking when you do get
him<00:05:42.710> wound<00:05:42.919> up<00:05:51.370> it<00:05:52.370> really<00:05:52.640> doesn't<00:05:52.970> move<00:05:53.120> but

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:53.360 
him wound up it really doesn't move but

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.210 
him wound up it really doesn't move but
I<00:05:53.480> loved<00:05:53.750> the<00:05:53.930> fact<00:05:54.140> that<00:05:54.260> his<00:05:54.440> tail<00:05:54.710> swishes

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:55.220 
I loved the fact that his tail swishes

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:58.270 
I loved the fact that his tail swishes
back<00:05:55.400> and<00:05:55.580> forth<00:05:55.820> that<00:05:56.360> that'd<00:05:57.230> alone<00:05:57.620> is<00:05:57.919> very

00:05:58.270 --> 00:05:58.280 
back and forth that that'd alone is very

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.150 
back and forth that that'd alone is very
very<00:05:58.490> cool<00:05:59.110> and<00:06:00.110> actually<00:06:00.440> not<00:06:00.890> really<00:06:01.130> a

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:01.160 
very cool and actually not really a

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.070 
very cool and actually not really a
shark<00:06:01.520> he<00:06:01.669> looks<00:06:01.820> more<00:06:02.000> like<00:06:02.060> a<00:06:02.210> coelacanth

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:03.080 
shark he looks more like a coelacanth

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.010 
shark he looks more like a coelacanth
and<00:06:03.340> of<00:06:04.340> course<00:06:04.550> pilot<00:06:05.270> is<00:06:05.360> in<00:06:05.390> the<00:06:05.600> head<00:06:05.780> or

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:06.020 
and of course pilot is in the head or

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:12.879 
and of course pilot is in the head or
the<00:06:06.680> very<00:06:06.890> front<00:06:07.220> of<00:06:07.370> the<00:06:07.460> head<00:06:07.610> anyway<00:06:11.889> last

00:06:12.879 --> 00:06:12.889 
the very front of the head anyway last

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:15.490 
the very front of the head anyway last
up<00:06:13.190> we<00:06:13.340> are<00:06:13.460> taking<00:06:13.850> it<00:06:14.000> a<00:06:14.270> look<00:06:14.840> at<00:06:15.020> the<00:06:15.320> bat

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:15.500 
up we are taking it a look at the bat

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.159 
up we are taking it a look at the bat
orzo<00:06:16.280> bad<00:06:16.490> as<00:06:16.729> I've<00:06:16.880> also<00:06:17.060> heard<00:06:17.419> what's

00:06:18.159 --> 00:06:18.169 
orzo bad as I've also heard what's

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:19.719 
orzo bad as I've also heard what's
really<00:06:18.410> cool<00:06:18.560> with<00:06:18.710> this<00:06:18.830> figure<00:06:19.130> is<00:06:19.370> that<00:06:19.580> he

00:06:19.719 --> 00:06:19.729 
really cool with this figure is that he

00:06:19.729 --> 00:06:21.580 
really cool with this figure is that he
comes<00:06:19.910> with<00:06:20.210> his<00:06:20.240> own<00:06:20.360> stand<00:06:20.960> that<00:06:21.320> he<00:06:21.410> can

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:21.590 
comes with his own stand that he can

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:25.000 
comes with his own stand that he can
hang<00:06:21.800> off<00:06:22.040> of<00:06:22.070> that<00:06:22.940> I<00:06:23.240> really<00:06:24.050> like<00:06:24.350> I<00:06:24.650> just

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:25.010 
hang off of that I really like I just

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:26.380 
hang off of that I really like I just
like<00:06:25.190> the<00:06:25.340> fact<00:06:25.550> that<00:06:25.640> you<00:06:25.760> can<00:06:25.910> store<00:06:26.210> the

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:26.390 
like the fact that you can store the

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:28.980 
like the fact that you can store the
figure<00:06:26.660> on<00:06:26.840> a<00:06:26.870> stand<00:06:27.320> I<00:06:27.680> appreciate<00:06:28.550> that

00:06:28.980 --> 00:06:28.990 
figure on a stand I appreciate that

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:31.120 
figure on a stand I appreciate that
unfortunately<00:06:29.990> I<00:06:30.140> don't<00:06:30.260> think<00:06:30.440> my<00:06:30.740> figure

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:31.130 
unfortunately I don't think my figure

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:32.680 
unfortunately I don't think my figure
works<00:06:31.580> all<00:06:31.880> that<00:06:32.060> well<00:06:32.240> because<00:06:32.539> he's

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:32.690 
works all that well because he's

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:35.050 
works all that well because he's
supposed<00:06:32.870> to<00:06:33.140> have<00:06:33.350> wing<00:06:34.100> flapping<00:06:34.490> gimmick

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:35.060 
supposed to have wing flapping gimmick

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:38.320 
supposed to have wing flapping gimmick
or<00:06:35.300> a<00:06:35.750> wing<00:06:36.140> flapping<00:06:36.710> gimmick<00:06:37.250> with<00:06:37.850> this

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:38.330 
or a wing flapping gimmick with this

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:39.969 
or a wing flapping gimmick with this
button<00:06:38.600> on<00:06:38.900> the<00:06:39.050> back<00:06:39.229> this<00:06:39.560> big<00:06:39.770> red<00:06:39.950> button

00:06:39.969 --> 00:06:39.979 
button on the back this big red button

00:06:39.979 --> 00:06:43.600 
button on the back this big red button
but<00:06:40.910> it<00:06:41.030> doesn't<00:06:41.390> work<00:06:41.660> so<00:06:42.080> well<00:06:42.220> and<00:06:43.220> I<00:06:43.400> think
