00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:03.559
 clearing throughout this course and if 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:06.229

 improve your channel to improve your blogs 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.890
 make a video company 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.340

 best for film music videos 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:25.070
 independent and good this video and this 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:27.800
 series of videos in this course how 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:30.710
 record with de slr is for you going 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.950
 directed to you and we're going to start by 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.950
 the beginning 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:48.020
 surely you are wondering 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:51.909
 buy a video camera or buy 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.909
 a slr camera 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:01.470
 let's talk about the differences between these 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:04.200
 two main slopes the chamber of 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.120
 video is dedicated precisely to the video 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.520
 but that gives a look maybe a little bit 

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:10.610
 more television if what you want 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.710
 do something type television type 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:16.560
 telenovela because the video camera is 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:18.330
 for you if what you want is then for 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.120
 the opposite is a totally more look 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.640
 filmmaker but you do not want to spend 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:27.150
 obviously the money of a camera 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:29.040
 cinema with an epic network a dragon network by 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:33.470
 what you need is the best one dslr 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:38.430
 and what does it mean for slr because it is digital 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:41.760
 single lens reflex and there are different types 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.740
 of prices different brands the most 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.620
 known obviously are canon and nikon 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:48.870
 who were the pioneers in this kind of 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.350
 cameras and I'm going to tell you a little bit about 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:54.180
 the history of reflex cameras 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:56.070
 it turns out that canon and nikon 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:59.830
 to compete in this market because they 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:03.370
 they had their photo cameras as always 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:05.680
 after incorporating a video at the time 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:09.160
 to incorporate the video and put it then a 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.810
 type of lens like 50 mm the 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.980
 people were fascinated because it was very 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:17.860
 similar the look to the sine look of 35 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.720
 millimeters and obviously people started 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:22.450
 to buy SLR cameras to have 

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:24.520
 that filmmaker aspect but with a camera 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:27.870
 much cheaper than he was 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:30.100
 around 600 or 700 euros 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.530
 then obviously a movie camera 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:35.050
 because he was in the clouds and they got 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:37.480
 quite similar results not with the 

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:39.970
 Same quality for sensor size and 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:43.240
 for the amount of noise that the sensor 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.370
 35 millimeters or one was the front can 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.560
 give 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.629
 Later we will go on distinguishing the 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:53.310
 sensors in which a full difference 

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:55.920
 frame to a sensor to psc a sensor of the 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:58.019
 new ones like the micro four thirds of 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:59.549
 the panasonic cameras we have talking 

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:02.579
 more detail but how is this the course 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:05.400
 introductory talk about then cameras 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:07.200
 to the best low budget and we're going to 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.959
 start with the price of the cameras 

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:13.200
 everything depends on your budget and what 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:15.720
 you want to invest in your video there are 

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:18.150
 very cheap cameras from 5,000 pesos 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:20.669
 up full frame cameras that is things 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:22.440
 up to 80 thousand pesos and if you want to invest 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:26.370
 in a movie camera you can spend 

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:28.229
 above 180 thousand pesos or above 300 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.510
 thousand pesos depending on what you 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:33.690
 want to perform we'll talk in this 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:35.699
 moment of the filmmakers under 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:39.210
 budget that can start at 

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:41.699
 best camera column one of five or of 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:46.470
 canon or one of three of a little bit more more 

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:50.630
 digital or a 60 out of about 70 of a 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:53.450
 with 52 50 and 300 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:55.400
 and everything depends on what you more 

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:57.740
 like it the most important thing is that 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.810
 you choose a brand because 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.910
 surely in the future those glasses 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.890
 they will be able to serve for their future cameras to 

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:05.990
 what do I mean with this if you like 

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:08.120
 canon they mean from the beginning 

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:10.790
 because surely those glasses that 

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:14.840
 will serve to occupy them in your camera 

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:16.790
 future normally the cameras have 

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:19.340
 improvements but the lenses are almost always 

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:21.230
 Same goes with them nor if you 

00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:22.610
 they like or with so they choose and with from here 

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:25.100
 forward 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:25.970
 if you like panasonic, choose here 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:28.700
 forward 

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:30.760
 if you like it, and choose it here to 

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:33.530
 forward it is very important this because 

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:35.840
 after investing in a camera the most 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:38.890
 important is to invest in the objectives 

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:38.890
 or lenses 

00:06:22.139 --> 00:06:26.189
 well this is the number one chapter of 

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:28.409
