00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.320
 Version 8.11 is not large, but many new features have been added. 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.400
 Added a new game mode 

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.880
 Added a new map, and several original maps have also changed a lot. 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.640
 Read this introduction for more details. 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.520
 Version 8.11 adds a new game mode - National War 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.600
 In this game mode, the chariots of different countries compete against each other. 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.800
 For example, German chariots against American chariots, or Soviet chariots against French chariots 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.800
 There is a change in the lineup combination, but there is an exception 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.040
 At present, there will be no Chinese chariots and Japanese chariots in the "national warfare" mode. 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.560
 Because the technology trees in these two countries do not have all types of vehicles. 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:52.080
 Players join the "National Warfare" mode in the same way that they join the "encounter" and "raid" 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.200
 This mode can also be turned off in the Options menu. 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.520
 Version 8.11 adds a new map - Windstorm 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.800
 This is a beautiful snow and ice town full of original buildings. 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.480
 A river divides the town into two 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.040
 The bases of the two sides are located on both sides of the river. 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.560
 There are two main forward paths, players can attack through the town, or take a loop 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.000
 Different tactics can be taken against the winding trails in the town. 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.560
 The river banks on both sides are connected by bridges, and the most intense battle will break out here. 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.680
 You can choose to walk the loop line and quickly reach the enemy base. 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.880
 There are many places in the entire route for concealment 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.240
 The third way to attack is along the river... 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.840
 But this is very dangerous, because then you will be exposed to the open terrain. 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:40.200
 Four maps of Erlenberg, Highway, Redshire and Northwest are also rebalanced 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.480
 These changes are mainly made to make the battle more diversified while improving the imbalance on the map. 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.400
 The biggest change on the map Redshire 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.120
 The position of the base has changed, and now the players are moving in different directions after the battle begins. 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.520
 For example, the battle between the first line and the second line will now take place at the center of the map. 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.440
 The chariot will no longer stay in the battlefield near the south base for a long time. 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.280
 The hills on line 9 and line 0 become flat 

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:08.040
 In addition, a new canyon has been added to this area, so heavy tanks will be more comfortable in this area. 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.720
 This will increase the number of battles that take place on the right wing. 

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:16.600
 The famous hill above the map was divided into three parts, and some bushes were removed. 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.600
 Now, in the middle of the battle, it’s more difficult to stay on the hills and fire from enemy cars behind the bushes. 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:29.200
 However, this hill is still very important, so both sides of the battle will be more brave to take control of it. 

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:33.920
 In the updated Redshire, the "encounter" mode seems to be very worth looking forward to. 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.800
 The base is above the hill 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.040
 This kind of terrain provides a good cover in the flag area. 

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:43.680
 A chariot with a heavy turret and a good pitch angle will perform well here. 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.600
 Map Erlenberg The base position of the two teams above has also changed. 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.200
 Therefore, the battle area in the past will also change. 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.440
 Now, players will be fighting more around the castle near the castle. 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.400
 The map center has also been reworked. 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.840
 Added many buildings 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.040
 These buildings provide a safe cover when players drive from the base while driving the chariot 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:05.840
 Now, the central part of the map is an independent direction, especially suitable for heavy tanks. 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.160
 Now players have more choices when moving from one cover to another. 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:13.080
 New wading points near the North-South Bridge 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.120
 The change on the map Highway is more conducive to the southern base. 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.320
 The terrain on the right half of the map has been lowered overall. 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.200
 The steep mountain near the northern base was removed. 

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.040
 The road from the southern base into the town has become flat. 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:30.400
 Now, players must go closer to find enemy chariots that are driving on this road under cover. 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.120
 A new block has been added to the town, which will provide a good cover for players approaching the base from the south. 

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.440
 The location of the building has also changed somewhat. 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.960
 Now, it’s more difficult to control town streets from the northern base. 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.320
 The medium-sized chariot on the battlefield has a new cover. 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.880
 A large number of bushes were removed from both bases. 

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:54.840
 Now, the shelter can only accommodate 1 to 2 chariots, so players will not stay near the base at the start of the battle. 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:59.840
 Map of Northwest. Some of the bushes were removed from the map, and the terrain near the base was lowered. 

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:03.280
 It is now easier to arrive and occupy enemy bases. 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.920
 Added an offensive route 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.040
 There will be a large-scale battle here, but this may bring some surprises. 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.720
 This area is connected to the road slightly above it. 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:17.040
 Players who control this area will be able to block the enemy's offense and support allies. 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:24.680
 Some other maps have changed slightly. These changes will not affect the gameplay, but will only make these maps more atmospheric. 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.120
 In version 8.11, the BigWorld engine will be updated to version 2.4. 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:39.360
 This will open a new direction for the development of the game, allowing us to use the new technology, you will soon see! 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:45.680
 Please note! Game client functionality may be unstable for some computer configurations 

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:54.040
 At the request of the players, we have added new interface features. 

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.640
 Now, everyone can view the battle chat record. 

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.560
 You can also turn off chat in random battles. 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:06.960
 Occupant management has become more convenient. Now, players can train all occupants with one button and return or send occupants to the barracks with one click. 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.760
 The task interface has also been improved. Now, players can see the tasks they need more easily. 

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:15.600
 There are some other tiny but very useful changes 

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:20.760
 Remind everyone that there will be new events on Sundays and Sundays. 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.720
 At that time, everyone will receive double experience points and more points in each battle. 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:25.880
 Do not miss! 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.120
 So much now! I wish everyone good luck on the battlefield!
