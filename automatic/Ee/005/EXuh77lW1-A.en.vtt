00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:07.700
 iron lovers hello a little with 

00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:10.249
 late but I want to show all the same 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:13.459
 still the result is wrong 

00:00:10.249 --> 00:00:17.409
 installation of the wheel bearing here 

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:17.409
 we have a car in the repair seat 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:24.760
 skoda fabia car today us 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:28.010
 repair skoda fabia here is steeper we change 

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:31.280
 bearing but in this car 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:33.289
 bearings comes complete with hub 

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.929
 together in the collection 

00:00:33.289 --> 00:00:39.379
 he doesn't understand like that 

00:00:35.929 --> 00:00:40.879
 Looks like the one we shot here 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:43.699
 bet we have already set 

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:48.460
 I could not show you the process itself 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:52.039
 there is already a new hub with a bearing 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:56.109
 pressed in but what I wanted today 

00:00:52.039 --> 00:01:00.049
 say that the installation is wrong 

00:00:56.109 --> 00:01:02.600
 masters not or those who think that there is 

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:06.950
 Wizard causes bearing failure in 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:09.860
 principle this still come to work was 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:15.650
 I would be if he had not jumped Look 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:18.400
 here you can see how he came out more 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:24.370
 even than a half - pin drink 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:27.920
 left this bearing causing what 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:30.530
 this is the wrong installation 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.990
 besides this washer box-type washer 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:36.740
 which plays the role of a stopper 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:40.760
 here you can see these cloves here 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.620
 and not to snap into the groove 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:48.040
 when the bearing is pressed here 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:50.660
 thus he snaps Tapu 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:52.430
 usually when the bearing itself changes we 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.140
 used to use retaining rings 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.200
 which with combs in order 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.020
 the bearing did not come out here made 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.909
 Here is a crown washer 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:04.890
 when it didnâ€™t snap into place 

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:06.240
 in the groove needed 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.319
 during car operation 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:15.270
 bearing went more than half 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:16.470
 pulled the whole half shaft along 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.920
 I'll show you seriously now because 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:24.050
 prompts the correct installation here 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:35.060
 You can see the words a little bit 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:43.500
 I want to show the lighting already 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:47.580
 mounted axle bearing this one 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:51.750
 I try to show here 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.500
 this is exactly the puck that goes and 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.709
 she is 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:03:00.300
 pressed in should snap 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:03.030
 in the groove which is selected inside this one 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:06.000
 bearing the condition is correct he 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:09.090
 snap fully around the diameter 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:13.620
 here someone did not set correctly 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:16.350
 bearing left and pulled behind him 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:18.829
 later here I show it in 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:23.010
 inner hinge 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:25.290
 polo sedan we already set back 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:28.079
 put a new tournament because I left 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.600
 bearing tore this hinge here 

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:31.200
 see later it is taken apart even though it is 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.019
 not 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.000
 should not understand at all here this 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:40.910
 inner ring 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:42.829
 just broke the inner ring 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:48.810
 torn 3 part 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:51.200
 although it should be one here 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.200
 you see 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:04:02.170
 what happened both broke along with 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:06.280
 you ruined inner hinge which 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:08.890
 could still ride and ride on 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:11.790
 Vasilievich show how science should 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:15.160
 the balls looked like they spilled out 

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:21.459
 moisture that this hinge is screwed 

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:23.050
 if he went along with the persons from 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:25.800
 boxes in these put oil would still 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:29.910
 suffered gearbox here 

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:34.300
 show how it should look like 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:43.050
 visible crack ripped in half across 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:44.850
 too cracks 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:49.870
 just the wrong installation 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:52.930
 bearing or not enough stalled 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.560
 snap ring bearing can 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:57.070
 to ruin 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:59.470
 and wheel bearing with bearing 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:02.350
 because in the set yes 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:04.690
 you can ditch the inner hinge or 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:07.450
 the outside can ditch the gearbox 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:09.880
 on how the horizon the earring can be ditched and 

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:12.300
 yourself a car and because such 

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:17.410
 car goes easily under ucoz 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:19.840
 all guys learn watch how 

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:22.020
 repair and who dismantles you all 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.020
 until
