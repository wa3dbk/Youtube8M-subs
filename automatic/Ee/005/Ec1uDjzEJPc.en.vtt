top and then camera you see I put the
velcro<00:00:38.519> right<00:00:39.239> there<00:00:40.219> so<00:00:41.219> hooked<00:00:42.149> up<00:00:42.329> the

00:00:42.529 --> 00:00:42.539 
velcro right there so hooked up the

00:00:42.539 --> 00:00:46.759 
velcro right there so hooked up the
short<00:00:42.960> side<00:00:43.969> first<00:00:44.969> it's<00:00:45.929> easier<00:00:46.260> done<00:00:46.469> flat

00:00:46.759 --> 00:00:46.769 
short side first it's easier done flat

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:51.290 
short side first it's easier done flat
on<00:00:47.039> the<00:00:47.190> table<00:00:49.280> and<00:00:50.280> then<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.609> other<00:00:50.730> side<00:00:51.030> so

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
on the table and then the other side so

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.419 
on the table and then the other side so
though<00:00:52.609> the<00:00:53.609> camera<00:00:54.679> cannot<00:00:55.679> slide<00:00:56.010> back<00:00:56.250> and

00:00:56.419 --> 00:00:56.429 
though the camera cannot slide back and

00:00:56.429 --> 00:00:57.590 
though the camera cannot slide back and
forth<00:00:56.489> because<00:00:56.760> of<00:00:56.940> that<00:00:57.000> little<00:00:57.269> piece<00:00:57.420> of

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
forth because of that little piece of

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.349 
forth because of that little piece of
velcro<00:00:58.249> if<00:00:59.249> we<00:01:01.190> get<00:01:02.190> nice<00:01:02.399> and<00:01:02.429> close<00:01:02.760> and<00:01:03.239> we

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
velcro if we get nice and close and we

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.640 
velcro if we get nice and close and we
look<00:01:04.009> hopefully<00:01:05.009> you<00:01:05.159> can<00:01:05.339> see<00:01:05.579> that

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:06.650 
look hopefully you can see that

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:14.719 
look hopefully you can see that
I'll<00:01:07.650> get<00:01:07.860> nice<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.070> close<00:01:08.420> there<00:01:09.420> is<00:01:09.720> gap<00:01:13.729> not

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729

I'll get nice and close there is gap not
a<00:01:14.790> lot<00:01:16.280> but<00:01:17.280> there's<00:01:17.490> a<00:01:17.579> little<00:01:17.909> bit<00:01:18.060> it

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
a lot but there's a little bit it

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.399 
a lot but there's a little bit it
doesn't<00:01:18.689> touch<00:01:18.869> so<00:01:19.380> camera<00:01:20.040> should<00:01:20.159> be<00:01:20.280> safe<00:01:20.490> I

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:21.409

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
wintertime here in Canada so could fly

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.959 
wintertime here in Canada so could fly
outside<00:01:33.869> but<00:01:34.200> we're<00:01:34.350> not<00:01:34.619> going<00:01:34.829> to<00:01:34.950> I'll<00:01:35.759> post

outside but we're not going to I'll post
it<00:01:36.119> up<00:01:36.240> there<00:01:36.450> because<00:01:36.810> I<00:01:36.990> was<00:01:37.079> looking<00:01:37.380> for

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
it up there because I was looking for

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.550 
it up there because I was looking for
this<00:01:37.710> information<00:01:38.009> and<00:01:39.170> nobody<00:01:40.170> else<00:01:40.350> seemed

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
this information and nobody else seemed

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:46.010 
this information and nobody else seemed
to<00:01:40.649> have<00:01:40.829> it<00:01:41.990> actually<00:01:44.509> I'll<00:01:45.509> do<00:01:45.810> a<00:01:45.840> little

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
to have it actually I'll do a little

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.389 
to have it actually I'll do a little
flight

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:49.399 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:02:06.040 

wait<00:01:50.399> for<00:01:50.670> it<00:01:50.790> to

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.050 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.050 

and<00:02:07.050> if<00:02:07.170> he<00:02:07.350> applies<00:02:07.710> no<00:02:08.280> problem

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
and if he applies no problem

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:19.910 
and if he applies no problem
no<00:02:10.509> problem<00:02:10.929> at<00:02:11.080> all

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:27.460 

and<00:02:20.340> you'll<00:02:20.910> see<00:02:21.590> throttles<00:02:22.590> halfway<00:02:23.040> or<00:02:23.190> so

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.800 

works<00:02:28.470> great
