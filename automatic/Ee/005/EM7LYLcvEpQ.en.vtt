that<00:03:35.729> was<00:03:35.819> an<00:03:35.970> own-goal<00:03:36.150> it<00:03:36.569> looks<00:03:36.870> as<00:03:37.109> if<00:03:37.139> we

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
that was an own-goal it looks as if we

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.520 
that was an own-goal it looks as if we
get<00:03:37.620> the<00:03:37.769> head<00:03:37.979> off<00:03:38.159> right<00:03:38.310> here<00:03:38.579> doesn't<00:03:38.970> it
