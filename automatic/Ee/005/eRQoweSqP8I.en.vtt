give her some interaction because we've

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.490 
give her some interaction because we've
been<00:00:48.129> here<00:00:48.400> the<00:00:48.580> whole<00:00:48.610> time<00:00:48.790> for<00:00:49.330> her<00:00:49.540> sure

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:50.500 
been here the whole time for her sure

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.649 
been here the whole time for her sure
plenty<00:00:50.710> of<00:00:50.920> entertainment<00:00:51.269> plenty<00:00:52.269> of<00:00:52.420> sound

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:52.659 
plenty of entertainment plenty of sound

00:00:52.659 --> 00:00:55.049 
plenty of entertainment plenty of sound
plenty<00:00:53.140> of<00:00:53.229> noise<00:00:53.409> to<00:00:54.250> put<00:00:54.489> her<00:00:54.610> on<00:00:54.699> her<00:00:54.879> own

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:55.059

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:57.600 
plenty of noise to put her on her own
would<00:00:55.299> probably<00:00:55.629> be<00:00:56.350> quite<00:00:56.500> well<00:00:57.309> I<00:00:57.339> don't

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:57.610 
would probably be quite well I don't

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:58.740 
would probably be quite well I don't
think<00:00:57.640> it<00:00:57.790> would<00:00:57.879> be<00:00:57.940> the<00:00:58.030> best<00:00:58.150> thing<00:00:58.390> for<00:00:58.449> her

00:00:58.740 --> 00:00:58.750 
think it would be the best thing for her

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.359 
think it would be the best thing for her
so<00:00:59.019> we'd<00:00:59.650> like<00:00:59.739> to<00:00:59.949> give<00:01:00.070> her<00:01:00.159> a<00:01:00.220> bit<00:01:00.339> of

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:00.369

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:02.850 
so we'd like to give her a bit of
