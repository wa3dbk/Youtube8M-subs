 the legendary leader of the Huns, Attila 

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:12.210
 medieval scholastics called not otherwise 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.860
 as a scourge of God seeing in it 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.500
 pay for sins 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.199
 but that is a thief a body game is not only and not 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.699
 so much about the gunas she touches huge 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.859
 the number of political changes on 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.960
 continent shortly before the invasion xii 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.449
 hellish ort European territories began 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.240
 suffer from abrupt climate change 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:33.239
 began the great migration of nations 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.850
 the lunar only aggravated this 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.469
 the situation their tribes started moving in 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.780
 side of the western roman empire 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.510
 which by then already cracked 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.149
 the stitches from the case with his riders became 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.340
 just the personification of the era but not 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.020
 and the creator taking control of one 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.000
 factions you will have faced 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.030
 many problems of which the guns 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.489
 far from the most important thing of course if you 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.800
 don't stand right between them and rome 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:01.289
 many others before the invasion respect 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.300
 department any sassanid empire on 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.790
 the far south never heard of 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.030
 nomad barbarous states of the north 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.610
 Franks and Saxons are engaged only in dismemberment 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:13.110
 Western Roman Empire and the threat from 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.090
 east they don't care 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.549
 eastern roman empire surrounded himself 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.159
 buffer states and if something happens 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.770
 can simply pay off the Huns difficult 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.470
 only to immigrants vandals and estuary 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.000
 Visigoth and from year but their problems 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:29.970
 pale in comparison with problems 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.540
 Latin reima army and virtually no 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.979
 rebellions break out in the provinces 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:38.009
 an ineptly ruled empire falls apart 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:40.619
 under its own weight in the game from only 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:43.670
 a couple of minuses 1 is relative 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.960
 small amount of starting fractions 2 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.430
 monotony of barbarous states 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.250
 apart they begin to differ 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.590
 only at the end of the game is the seemingly creative and 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.799
 saber leaves space to exit 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.580
 a dozen shared with new nations for 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:59.410
 pre-order example already 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.810
 You can get a supplement with the forefathers 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:04.270
 Vikings the first thing that catches the eye 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.740
 body attention to detail in the tree 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.960
 public positions 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.820
 clearly shows the development of society 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:11.890
 to get a chance to take office 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:14.410
 supreme chieftain and get certain 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.990
 bonuses need to serve each 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.900
 subordinate several years of religion in the game 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:22.870
 not simplified to christianity zoroastrianism 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.680
 and paganism year profess the right 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.470
 Arianism 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:28.840
 Ogun and the ethnic groups they assimilated 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.510
 worship tengri great heaven 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.770
 even the empire implemented different 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.050
 Christian denominations 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:37.600
 roman soldiers brilliantly changed their armor 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:40.990
 lorica segment then on scaly armor 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:43.690
 late empire use of arguments but protection 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:45.640
 covered with cow leather key 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.709
 changes have affected the economy 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:50.470
 money in the hotel is needed for almost 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:52.840
 altogether they are spent on the maintenance of troops and 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.580
 Some buildings need money for 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:57.010
 research of certain technologies and 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:59.320
 restructuring of cities of other cultures except 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.940
 Moreover, without them it is impossible to establish new ones. 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:03.580
 cities specially designated for this 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:05.440
 places a balance between the vision of a warrior and 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:08.260
 the construction of the economy in the game is pretty 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.300
 not bad without good planning can 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.910
 stay with a big empire 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.140
 which cannot even support 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.120
 several armies 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.220
 and she will suffer from permanent 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.830
 riots because pay big 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.980
 account will have to create supporting 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:26.410
 order without money even previously hired 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.209
 troops will quickly run to help 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:30.880
 growing state government 

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:33.730
 will governors these are members of your 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:36.070
 tribal union or family which can 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.950
 assign province they can give 

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:40.750
 bonuses to order and productivity 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:43.660
 interesting current creative assembly 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.880
 complicated the process of waging each 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:48.550
 Assad turned into a serious event 

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:51.040
 for which you need to prepare no move 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:52.870
 without much stock to the novels and siege 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.299
 towers losses may turn out 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.730
 catastrophic besieged to whether 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:59.769
 help towers who are much less 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.180
 increased range and damage 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:02.980
 several squads 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:06.250
 under the guise of reinforcement may well be 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:08.769
 withstand the attack of a large army especially 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:10.780
 if it is a Huns basis of which troops 

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:12.689
 makes cavalry besides even 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.920
 cities satellites got towers and 

00:04:12.689 --> 00:04:16.720
 any fortifications 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.789
 now in hold ceased to be 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.220
 almost a losing affair besides 

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:21.340
 commanders have lost the opportunity 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.500
 specialization 

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:26.080
 if in rome 2 you can invest everything in 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:28.570
 the development of zeal tricks or authority 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:31.660
 let's have enough boss provided 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:34.419
 only relatively linear skill trees 

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:37.150
 it is the same for all commanders in 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:38.740
 the game of the army is the same tree but with more 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.110
 specific skills 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:43.150
 but visually total war attila 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:45.490
 looks worse than rome 2 

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:48.430
 even the biggest cities began to resemble 

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:50.759
 to the hammered villages of roman cities and 

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:52.960
 does not differ much from the barbaric 

00:04:50.759 --> 00:04:55.150
 image building troops in the menu 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.349
 cities were replaced by rough 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:59.110
 three-dimensional model 

00:04:56.349 --> 00:05:01.389
 it only complicates the perception but 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.940
 Perhaps the most important concern is 

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:06.010
 the same problem because of which suffered 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:09.550
 rome 2 immediately after release 

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:11.409
 the course goes on too long of course 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:13.930
 up to a few minutes of waiting like this 

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:15.250
 It was the previous part far but in 

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:17.830
 definitely a moment appears on the map 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:20.199
 so many new factions that wait 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:22.479
 accounts prohibitively long on 

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:24.909
 enumeration of all minor changes in 

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:27.520
 the hotel would not have had enough time yes 

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:29.590
 it is not necessary despite certain 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:32.080
 problems creative and whether in another 

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:34.990
 just released a good game of the total series 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:37.180
 war in which everyone should play on 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:40.020
 that's all good luck and see you on 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:40.020
