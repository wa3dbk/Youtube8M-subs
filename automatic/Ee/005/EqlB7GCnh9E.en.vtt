00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.720 
so yeah I usually keep it on the treble
as<00:04:23.330> far<00:04:23.540> as<00:04:23.630> distortion<00:04:24.110> goes<00:04:24.290> but<00:04:24.500> I'm<00:04:24.730> going

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:25.730 
as far as distortion goes but I'm going

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:27.220 
as far as distortion goes but I'm going
between<00:04:25.850> them<00:04:26.120> so<00:04:26.390> you<00:04:26.900> get<00:04:26.990> here<00:04:27.170> to

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:27.230 
between them so you get here to

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:38.350 
between them so you get here to
difference<00:04:27.560> so<00:04:27.710> here's<00:04:27.890> regular<00:04:28.310> that<00:04:28.910> down

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.910 

and<00:04:39.360> here's<00:04:39.600> the<00:04:39.720> middle<00:04:39.900> was<00:04:40.710> both

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:40.920 
and here's the middle was both

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:46.499 
and here's the middle was both
humbuckers

00:04:46.499 --> 00:04:46.509 

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:54.800 

and<00:04:47.509> here's<00:04:47.749> that<00:04:48.169> way

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:54.810 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.490 

and<00:04:55.520> as<00:04:56.520> far<00:04:56.760> as<00:04:56.850> quote<00:04:57.090> the<00:04:57.120> coil<00:04:57.510> tap<00:04:57.750> in

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
and as far as quote the coil tap in

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.830 
and as far as quote the coil tap in
Distortion<00:04:59.430> it's<00:05:00.120> not<00:05:00.300> too<00:05:00.480> much<00:05:00.600> of<00:05:00.660> a

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 
Distortion it's not too much of a

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.070 
Distortion it's not too much of a
difference<00:05:00.990> when<00:05:01.470> you<00:05:01.500> coil<00:05:02.070> it<00:05:02.130> out<00:05:02.340> so<00:05:03.080> let

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:04.080 
difference when you coil it out so let

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:22.820 
difference when you coil it out so let
me<00:05:04.200> show<00:05:04.440> you<00:05:04.470> guys

00:05:24.719 --> 00:05:24.729 
so yeah it's not too much of a

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:28.409 
so yeah it's not too much of a
difference<00:05:24.879> but<00:05:25.469> it's<00:05:26.469> there<00:05:26.770> so<00:05:27.119> yeah<00:05:28.119> this

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:28.419 
difference but it's there so yeah this

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:30.450 
difference but it's there so yeah this
