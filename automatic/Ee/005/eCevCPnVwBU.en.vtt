so I hope to demonstrate to you the

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:10.780 
so I hope to demonstrate to you the
difference<00:00:08.840> between<00:00:09.230> LED<00:00:10.160> bulbs<00:00:10.610> and

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:10.790 
difference between LED bulbs and

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.199 
difference between LED bulbs and

ordinary filament molds strug halogen
bulbs<00:00:14.570> of<00:00:14.690> which<00:00:14.840> we<00:00:15.020> have<00:00:15.170> a<00:00:15.200> mix<00:00:15.530> in<00:00:15.889> this

particular chandelier now it's a really
dull<00:00:20.300> old<00:00:20.480> day<00:00:20.750> outside<00:00:21.250> but<00:00:22.250> it's<00:00:22.370> quite

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:22.640 
dull old day outside but it's quite

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.450 
dull old day outside but it's quite
bright<00:00:22.910> in<00:00:23.180> this<00:00:23.360> room<00:00:23.690> and<00:00:24.070> to<00:00:25.070> give<00:00:25.250> you<00:00:25.340> an

as you can see nothing wrong with that
lights<00:00:34.879> up<00:00:35.059> in<00:00:35.180> the<00:00:35.239> room<00:00:35.420> and<00:00:35.920> gives<00:00:36.920> off<00:00:37.070> an

00:00:37.209 --> 00:00:37.219 
lights up in the room and gives off an

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:41.590 
lights up in the room and gives off an
orange<00:00:37.640> II<00:00:37.760> type<00:00:38.120> of<00:00:38.390> light<00:00:39.940> so<00:00:40.940> I'm<00:00:41.329> gonna

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:41.600 
orange II type of light so I'm gonna

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.279 
orange II type of light so I'm gonna
switch<00:00:42.589> the<00:00:42.739> video<00:00:42.829> off<00:00:43.300> and<00:00:44.300> change<00:00:45.199> the

00:00:45.279 --> 00:00:45.289 
switch the video off and change the

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:47.380 
switch the video off and change the
light<00:00:45.440> bulbs<00:00:45.769> for<00:00:45.800> LED<00:00:46.309> I'll<00:00:46.760> also<00:00:46.999> show<00:00:47.329> you

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
light bulbs for LED I'll also show you

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.989 
light bulbs for LED I'll also show you
how<00:00:47.510> simple<00:00:47.929> buddy's<00:00:48.379> to<00:00:48.589> do<00:00:48.800> and<00:00:49.159> then<00:00:49.670> we<00:00:49.819> can

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:49.999 
how simple buddy's to do and then we can

00:00:49.999 --> 00:00:52.029 
how simple buddy's to do and then we can
run<00:00:50.149> the<00:00:50.329> test<00:00:50.510> again<00:00:50.719> with<00:00:50.899> the<00:00:51.140> LED<00:00:51.530> light

00:00:52.029 --> 00:00:52.039 
run the test again with the LED light

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:54.459 
run the test again with the LED light
bulbs<00:00:52.370> so<00:00:52.579> up<00:00:52.909> on<00:00:53.059> the<00:00:53.149> ladder<00:00:53.300> you<00:00:54.109> begin<00:00:54.379> to

00:00:54.459 --> 00:00:54.469 
bulbs so up on the ladder you begin to

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:55.959 
bulbs so up on the ladder you begin to
realize<00:00:54.649> just<00:00:54.800> how<00:00:55.100> old<00:00:55.339> dusty<00:00:55.760> your

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:55.969 
realize just how old dusty your

00:00:55.969 --> 00:00:57.880 
realize just how old dusty your
chandeliers<00:00:56.629> can<00:00:56.839> get<00:00:57.079> your<00:00:57.289> life<00:00:57.469> is<00:00:57.679> insane

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
chandeliers can get your life is insane

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.399 
chandeliers can get your life is insane
get<00:00:58.309> but<00:00:58.850> these<00:00:59.059> are<00:00:59.269> standard<00:00:59.899> bulbs<00:01:00.260> and

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:00.409 
get but these are standard bulbs and

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:03.250 
get but these are standard bulbs and
this<00:01:01.100> one<00:01:01.280> in<00:01:01.429> particular<00:01:01.640> is<00:01:02.239> a<00:01:02.420> halogen<00:01:02.839> bulb

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260 
this one in particular is a halogen bulb

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:09.480 
this one in particular is a halogen bulb
a<00:01:03.949> 14<00:01:04.850> candle<00:01:05.390> bulb<00:01:05.630> and<00:01:07.810> you<00:01:08.810> can<00:01:08.990> see

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 
a 14 candle bulb and you can see

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.039 
a 14 candle bulb and you can see
relatively<00:01:10.490> clearly<00:01:10.909> there<00:01:11.119> the<00:01:11.299> halogen

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:12.049 
relatively clearly there the halogen

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:14.889 
relatively clearly there the halogen
bulb<00:01:12.640> so<00:01:13.640> I'm<00:01:13.700> going<00:01:13.850> to<00:01:13.909> swap<00:01:14.119> that<00:01:14.329> now<00:01:14.540> with

00:01:14.889 --> 00:01:14.899 
bulb so I'm going to swap that now with

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:18.550 
bulb so I'm going to swap that now with
a<00:01:15.460> LED<00:01:16.460> bulb<00:01:16.969> and<00:01:17.240> it's<00:01:17.750> interesting<00:01:18.020> to<00:01:18.320> note

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
a LED bulb and it's interesting to note

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.709 
a LED bulb and it's interesting to note
that<00:01:18.590> although<00:01:19.100> the<00:01:19.460> light<00:01:19.640> was<00:01:19.880> only<00:01:20.180> on<00:01:20.299> for

00:01:20.709 --> 00:01:20.719 
that although the light was only on for

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:22.359 
that although the light was only on for
a<00:01:20.750> few<00:01:20.960> seconds<00:01:21.560> as<00:01:21.710> you<00:01:21.799> would<00:01:21.950> have<00:01:22.039> seen<00:01:22.250> in

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:22.369 
a few seconds as you would have seen in

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:24.940 
a few seconds as you would have seen in
the<00:01:22.490> previous<00:01:22.759> video<00:01:23.299> that<00:01:23.659> bulb<00:01:24.350> is<00:01:24.590> quite

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
the previous video that bulb is quite

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.770 
the previous video that bulb is quite
warm<00:01:25.159> to<00:01:25.460> touch<00:01:25.490> not<00:01:25.909> so<00:01:26.180> hot<00:01:26.329> I<00:01:26.509> can't

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
warm to touch not so hot I can't

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.749 
warm to touch not so hot I can't
actually<00:01:27.049> touch<00:01:27.350> it<00:01:27.409> but<00:01:28.130> it<00:01:28.219> certainly<00:01:28.460> is

00:01:28.749 --> 00:01:28.759 
actually touch it but it certainly is

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:37.480 
actually touch it but it certainly is
warm<00:01:29.090> so<00:01:31.119> here's<00:01:32.119> a<00:01:32.590> new<00:01:33.590> LED<00:01:34.039> bulb<00:01:35.469> and<00:01:36.469> if<00:01:37.369> I

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
warm so here's a new LED bulb and if I

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:43.490 
warm so here's a new LED bulb and if I
just<00:01:37.700> simply<00:01:38.000> screw<00:01:38.060> that<00:01:38.450> into<00:01:38.659> place

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.700 

it's<00:01:44.010> as<00:01:44.250> simple<00:01:44.400> as<00:01:44.640> that<00:01:45.090> no<00:01:45.710> adaptations

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
it's as simple as that no adaptations

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.560 
it's as simple as that no adaptations
nothing<00:01:47.250> special<00:01:47.550> just<00:01:47.760> like<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.420> like

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
nothing special just like the like

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.330 
nothing special just like the like
replacement<00:01:49.230> though<00:01:49.470> it's<00:01:49.650> taken<00:01:49.920> me<00:01:50.040> all<00:01:50.130> of

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
replacement though it's taken me all of

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.430 
replacement though it's taken me all of
two<00:01:50.520> minutes<00:01:50.670> to<00:01:51.030> just<00:01:51.240> swap<00:01:51.450> those<00:01:51.630> bulbs<00:01:52.050> out

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:52.440 
two minutes to just swap those bulbs out

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.440 
two minutes to just swap those bulbs out
and<00:01:53.310> that's<00:01:53.460> to<00:01:53.520> say<00:01:53.760> it<00:01:53.880> was<00:01:53.970> a<00:01:54.000> simple

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
and that's to say it was a simple

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.800 
and that's to say it was a simple
unscrew<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:55.650> replace<00:01:56.040> with<00:01:56.490> the<00:01:56.790> LED<00:01:57.390> bulbs

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
unscrew and replace with the LED bulbs

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.320 
unscrew and replace with the LED bulbs
so<00:01:58.560> we've<00:01:58.950> got<00:01:59.130> message<00:01:59.490> let's<00:02:00.000> flick<00:02:00.210> the

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330 
so we've got message let's flick the

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.680 
so we've got message let's flick the
switch<00:02:00.540> off<00:02:00.750> I<00:02:01.520> know<00:02:02.520> you<00:02:02.580> can<00:02:02.790> see<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.360> light

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
switch off I know you can see the light

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.620 
switch off I know you can see the light
up<00:02:03.900> is<00:02:04.050> instant<00:02:04.830> and<00:02:05.210> it's<00:02:06.210> still<00:02:06.450> work

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
up is instant and it's still work

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.870 
up is instant and it's still work
because<00:02:07.110> these<00:02:07.380> are<00:02:07.560> warm<00:02:07.800> bolts<00:02:08.430> it's<00:02:08.670> still

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
because these are warm bolts it's still

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.880 
because these are warm bolts it's still
a<00:02:08.910> slight<00:02:09.420> orange<00:02:09.780> hue<00:02:10.290> from<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:10.740> light

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
a slight orange hue from the light

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.020 
a slight orange hue from the light
emitted<00:02:11.490> so<00:02:13.130> apart<00:02:14.130> from<00:02:14.400> that<00:02:14.610> there's

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:15.030 
emitted so apart from that there's

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.810 
emitted so apart from that there's
really<00:02:15.360> no<00:02:15.540> discernible<00:02:16.170> difference<00:02:16.920> between

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
really no discernible difference between

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.990 
really no discernible difference between
these<00:02:17.940> LED<00:02:18.420> bulbs<00:02:18.870> and<00:02:19.110> the<00:02:19.470> old<00:02:20.000> filament

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
these LED bulbs and the old filament

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.320 
these LED bulbs and the old filament
reparative<00:02:21.660> bulbs<00:02:22.170> I<00:02:22.230> had<00:02:22.530> in<00:02:22.710> place

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:23.330 
reparative bulbs I had in place

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:25.610 
reparative bulbs I had in place
fundamentally<00:02:24.330> the<00:02:24.450> difference<00:02:24.840> being<00:02:25.050> these

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
fundamentally the difference being these

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.370 
fundamentally the difference being these
five<00:02:25.980> bulbs<00:02:26.370> are<00:02:26.640> only<00:02:26.760> drawing<00:02:27.060> 20<00:02:27.810> watts<00:02:28.080> of

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
five bulbs are only drawing 20 watts of

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:33.080 
five bulbs are only drawing 20 watts of
energy<00:02:30.260> or<00:02:31.260> 20<00:02:31.710> watts<00:02:31.890> of<00:02:31.980> electricity<00:02:32.400> so

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
energy or 20 watts of electricity so

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.610 
energy or 20 watts of electricity so
it's<00:02:33.570> going<00:02:33.750> to<00:02:33.840> be<00:02:33.930> much<00:02:34.140> better<00:02:34.320> on<00:02:34.590> our

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
it's going to be much better on our

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:36.350 
it's going to be much better on our
pocket<00:02:35.160> and<00:02:35.250> obviously<00:02:35.640> help<00:02:35.910> save<00:02:36.210> the

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
pocket and obviously help save the

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.440 
pocket and obviously help save the
environment<00:02:36.390> as<00:02:36.990> well<00:02:37.020> so<00:02:37.980> that's<00:02:38.490> LED<00:02:39.000> bulbs

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
environment as well so that's LED bulbs

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:49.500 
environment as well so that's LED bulbs
what<00:02:40.110> are<00:02:40.230> you<00:02:40.320> waiting<00:02:40.680> for<00:02:40.710> get<00:02:41.130> yours<00:02:41.340> now

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510
