00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.580
 need 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:23.030
 at least one burner process 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:25.280
 dual layer because also practically for 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:28.610
 playstation 2 games 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:30.650
 most do not weigh as much are 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:34.150
 those the xbox that weigh so much you see 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:37.280
 here for example 2gb 82 bytes 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:42.860
 so there is even if you have a stylized one 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:46.480
 re dual layer we don't need it moves 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:49.150
 also showing the old one displayed 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:57.239
 we wait for that 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:57.239
 sky strangers extract clear extracts 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:08.500

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:20.530
 talk on the phone, then finished 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:23.200
 extract us will sprout nothing 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.510
 let's go again sutor we do again 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.640
 for starry 

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:30.730
 I will answer this let's say about this 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.709
 right button icon forgot to 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:35.500
 say that when you want to be a part 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:36.550
 you can hope for any such 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:41.560
 I already remember I said it 

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:43.239
 how can you stand any for 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:46.090
 in addition to those with these kings those departments 

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:50.470
 with these white sheets you can extract 

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:57.070
 and all these among all these 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:59.290
 you can extract an ok, this will answer 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:04.739
 icon that falls with the right button of the 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:04.739
 mouse on open with damon tools and light 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:09.590
 let's wait 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:18.620
 then ok and let's open knife 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:21.030
 previso light and then these then go 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:26.240
 all burned should be burned 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:26.240
 so let's open ing bourne 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.090
 then 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:35.479
 but some English but it is the same thing 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:41.479
 just click on burn file and 

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:44.620
 folders we take these files and them 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:44.620
 let's drag here 

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:55.100
 ok we can close after we put the 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:05:01.210
 empty disk sells in the burner does not 

00:04:55.100 --> 00:05:05.330
 in the reader attention in the masters 6 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:08.720
 and remove the stand on verification and methods 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:10.820
 test because if verified and for yields 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:14.000
 disc takes so already is a disc a 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:15.129
 disk wasted by head I don't know what's needed 

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.259
 anyway 

00:05:15.129 --> 00:05:20.219
 I do n't see why we haven't tried it 

00:05:17.259 --> 00:05:23.229
 therefore not only of women errors 

00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:25.719
 mercedes this will come out of this 

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:28.360
 but colorful design because you can 

00:05:25.719 --> 00:05:32.909
 note that they are fires first here 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:36.399
 there is no writer of first sorry yes 

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:39.009
 first second here is not colored then 

00:05:36.399 --> 00:05:41.369
 it means that there is no disc when and there is 

00:05:39.009 --> 00:05:46.559
 written which is colored there is disk 

00:05:41.369 --> 00:05:46.559
 we apply do yes ok 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:54.729
 c never steri 0 il 

00:05:52.370 --> 00:05:54.729
 the game 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:06.289
 it's not there anyway 

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:16.220
 close then obviously depends on more 

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:21.710
 countries of the game the more time it takes 

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:30.139
 this strategic 82 will give us a few 20 

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:34.990
 15 minutes can say sorry maybe so 

00:06:30.139 --> 00:06:34.990
 and faster then 

00:06:40.889 --> 00:06:47.440
 much 

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:50.040
 is not a record writing when you are 

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:50.040
 formed 

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:55.710
 all right 

00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:04.270
 in fact we do not remove this 20 minutes 

00:07:00.700 --> 00:07:07.530
 remaining okay then my name is 

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:07.530
 after OK 

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:17.030
 that he loved after then after ok boys 

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:20.360
 when finished burning it will be this 

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:22.730
 fish on complete with chin musi a 

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:26.480

00:07:22.730 --> 00:07:32.570
 pippi a similar one or we can do it 

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:35.060
 ok to close in gb on and go to apple tree 

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:38.600
 start computer to verify that there 

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:40.970
 are the program no need to 

00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:43.760
 automatically check this we do 

00:07:40.970 --> 00:07:47.590
 to keep it to never see and there 

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:47.590
 these files are in fact 

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:53.160
 in the disc is fine 

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:57.729
 fear part 2 is so you have to show 

00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:59.729
 that works hello he saw part 2 

00:07:57.729 --> 00:07:59.729
