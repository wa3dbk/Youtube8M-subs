00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
I think that the game is going to start

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.660 
I think that the game is going to start
in<00:00:50.309> any<00:00:50.489> second<00:00:51.030> now<00:00:51.090> let's<00:00:51.800> see<00:00:52.800> yep<00:00:53.399> 10

in any second now let's see yep 10

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.279 
in any second now let's see yep 10
seconds<00:00:53.969> until<00:00:54.059> the<00:00:54.210> game<00:00:54.360> starts<00:00:54.390> okay<00:00:54.809> guys

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
let's get ready so I haven't really

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.260 
let's get ready so I haven't really
played<00:00:58.680> this<00:00:58.859> too<00:00:59.160> much<00:00:59.370> I<00:00:59.579> played<00:00:59.910> like<00:01:00.059> maybe

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
played this too much I played like maybe

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.500 
played this too much I played like maybe
five<00:01:00.510> or<00:01:00.570> ten<00:01:00.899> games<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.440> I<00:01:02.219> think<00:01:02.670> I<00:01:02.820> won<00:01:03.149> once

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
five or ten games and I think I won once

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.719 
five or ten games and I think I won once
so<00:01:04.110> yeah<00:01:04.530> we're<00:01:04.680> gonna<00:01:04.769> see<00:01:05.040> how<00:01:05.129> it<00:01:05.250> goes<00:01:05.430> and

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
so yeah we're gonna see how it goes and

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.420 
so yeah we're gonna see how it goes and
it<00:01:05.900> might<00:01:06.900> be<00:01:07.110> a<00:01:07.140> little<00:01:07.560> bit<00:01:07.770> laggy<00:01:08.040> that's

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
it might be a little bit laggy that's

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:09.980 
it might be a little bit laggy that's
why<00:01:08.790> you<00:01:08.850> can<00:01:09.060> see<00:01:09.270> that<00:01:09.420> i<00:01:09.479> have<00:01:09.510> my<00:01:09.720> smooth

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
why you can see that i have my smooth

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.649 
why you can see that i have my smooth
lightning<00:01:10.409> and<00:01:10.590> on<00:01:11.310> minimum<00:01:11.760> and<00:01:11.939> also<00:01:12.360> my<00:01:12.479> rep

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
lightning and on minimum and also my rep

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.030 
lightning and on minimum and also my rep
my<00:01:12.810> render<00:01:13.110> distance<00:01:13.140> isn't<00:01:13.740> that<00:01:13.860> high

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
my render distance isn't that high

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.490 
my render distance isn't that high
because<00:01:14.250> for<00:01:15.150> some<00:01:15.330> reason<00:01:15.360> this<00:01:16.049> minigame

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
because for some reason this minigame

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
hopefully you guys can enjoy this with a

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.410 
hopefully you guys can enjoy this with a
tiny<00:01:21.900> bit<00:01:22.110> of<00:01:22.200> lag<00:01:22.350> anyway<00:01:22.740> so<00:01:23.130> we<00:01:24.000> just<00:01:24.150> fell

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
tiny bit of lag anyway so we just fell

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.810 
tiny bit of lag anyway so we just fell
down<00:01:24.450> one<00:01:24.930> layer<00:01:25.170> so<00:01:25.650> it<00:01:25.890> looks<00:01:26.159> like<00:01:26.280> I<00:01:26.549> things

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
down one layer so it looks like I things

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.280 
down one layer so it looks like I things
like<00:01:27.030> five<00:01:27.330> layers<00:01:27.600> or<00:01:27.840> something<00:01:28.110> on<00:01:28.200> this

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.889 
soda in there and it kind of worked out
i<00:02:02.159> mean<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.670> keyboard<00:02:03.090> is<00:02:03.180> still<00:02:03.329> working<00:02:03.719> and

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:03.899 
i mean the keyboard is still working and

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:05.810 
i mean the keyboard is still working and
you<00:02:04.560> know<00:02:04.649> every<00:02:04.979> button<00:02:05.189> is<00:02:05.430> still<00:02:05.610> you<00:02:05.700> know

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
you know every button is still you know

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.300 
you know every button is still you know
functioning<00:02:06.390> so<00:02:06.799> hopefully<00:02:07.799> this<00:02:07.950> sort<00:02:08.220> of

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
functioning so hopefully this sort of

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.619 
functioning so hopefully this sort of
thing<00:02:08.369> will<00:02:08.670> go<00:02:08.819> away<00:02:08.940> really<00:02:09.300> soon<00:02:09.479> because

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
thing will go away really soon because

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.330 
thing will go away really soon because
in<00:02:09.959> this<00:02:10.050> minigame<00:02:10.379> you<00:02:10.649> have<00:02:10.770> to<00:02:10.890> jump<00:02:11.129> pretty

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
in this minigame you have to jump pretty

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.520 
in this minigame you have to jump pretty
much<00:02:11.520> all<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:11.879> time

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
much all the time

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.220 
much all the time
so<00:02:12.860> you<00:02:12.920> won't<00:02:13.040> fall<00:02:13.250> down<00:02:13.310> of<00:02:13.580> course<00:02:13.730> and

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
so you won't fall down of course and

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.660 
so you won't fall down of course and
yeah<00:02:15.230> so<00:02:15.380> hopefully<00:02:15.770> my<00:02:15.800> space<00:02:16.160> but<00:02:16.400> will<00:02:16.550> get

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
yeah so hopefully my space but will get

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.190 
yeah so hopefully my space but will get
fixed<00:02:16.880> soon<00:02:17.030> so<00:02:17.390> I<00:02:17.450> can<00:02:17.480> play<00:02:17.780> some<00:02:17.840> immune

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
fixed soon so I can play some immune

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.809 
fixed soon so I can play some immune
games<00:02:18.410> without<00:02:18.709> having<00:02:19.100> to<00:02:19.220> worry<00:02:19.430> that<00:02:19.670> my

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:19.819 
games without having to worry that my

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:21.940 
games without having to worry that my
spacebar<00:02:20.209> won't<00:02:20.630> work<00:02:20.900> it<00:02:21.200> anyway<00:02:21.440> so<00:02:21.470> far<00:02:21.860> we

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:21.950 
spacebar won't work it anyway so far we

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.620 
spacebar won't work it anyway so far we
doing<00:02:22.160> great<00:02:22.400> I<00:02:22.580> think<00:02:23.090> that<00:02:23.150> we're<00:02:23.420> still<00:02:23.569> on

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630

when I think you have a double jump as

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:02.140 
when I think you have a double jump as
well<00:05:00.530> but<00:05:01.250> you<00:05:01.340> don't<00:05:01.490> have<00:05:01.550> one<00:05:01.789> yeah<00:05:01.970> let's

a<00:05:08.900> little<00:05:08.930> jump<00:05:09.500> boost<00:05:09.770> and<00:05:10.240> like<00:05:11.240> but<00:05:11.509> you<00:05:11.599> can

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:11.630 
a little jump boost and like but you can

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:15.339 
a little jump boost and like but you can
only<00:05:11.750> use<00:05:11.900> it<00:05:12.110> once<00:05:12.229> of<00:05:12.440> course<00:05:13.599> okay<00:05:14.599> oh<00:05:14.630> snap
