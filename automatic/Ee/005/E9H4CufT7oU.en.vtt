gaskets<00:01:57.880> in<00:01:58.030> place<00:01:58.330> and<00:01:58.660> what<00:01:59.110> I've<00:01:59.229> done<00:01:59.410> is

00:01:59.730 --> 00:01:59.740 
gaskets in place and what I've done is

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.430 
gaskets in place and what I've done is
removed<00:02:00.340> that<00:02:00.910> piece<00:02:01.390> of<00:02:01.540> metal<00:02:01.900> it's<00:02:02.110> just

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:02.440 
removed that piece of metal it's just

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.100 
removed that piece of metal it's just
right<00:02:02.620> over<00:02:02.650> here<00:02:03.240> once<00:02:04.240> you<00:02:04.360> get<00:02:04.479> it<00:02:04.600> where

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
right over here once you get it where

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.920 
right over here once you get it where
you<00:02:05.290> think<00:02:05.460> it's<00:02:06.460> supposed<00:02:06.729> to<00:02:06.910> be<00:02:07.120> or<00:02:07.750> it's

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
you think it's supposed to be or it's

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:09.950 
you think it's supposed to be or it's
kind<00:02:08.110> of<00:02:08.229> lined<00:02:08.470> up<00:02:08.679> kind<00:02:08.950> of<00:02:09.010> Center<00:02:09.369> these

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:09.960 
kind of lined up kind of Center these

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:16.410 
kind of lined up kind of Center these
with<00:02:10.960> your<00:02:11.110> hole<00:02:11.350> a<00:02:12.280> little<00:02:12.730> bit<00:02:13.560> overlap<00:02:15.420> now

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
with your hole a little bit overlap now

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.180 
with your hole a little bit overlap now
it's<00:02:16.630> time<00:02:16.840> to<00:02:17.020> actually<00:02:17.140> climb<00:02:17.560> down<00:02:17.830> and

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
it's time to actually climb down and

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.670 
it's time to actually climb down and
then<00:02:18.490> make<00:02:18.670> sure<00:02:18.700> that<00:02:18.910> all<00:02:19.330> these<00:02:19.660> four<00:02:19.990> bolt

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
then make sure that all these four bolt

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.820 
then make sure that all these four bolt
holes<00:02:21.000> line<00:02:22.000> up<00:02:22.030> with<00:02:22.900> the<00:02:23.140> the<00:02:23.500> mounting

plate<00:02:24.070> that<00:02:24.220> goes<00:02:24.400> underneath<00:02:24.780> so<00:02:25.780> what<00:02:25.900> I<00:02:25.930> did

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
plate that goes underneath so what I did

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.770 
plate that goes underneath so what I did
is<00:02:26.500> I<00:02:26.560> held<00:02:27.100> the<00:02:27.310> mounting<00:02:28.180> bracket<00:02:28.540> into

able to still kind of give it a little

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.120 
able to still kind of give it a little
bit<00:02:57.940> of<00:02:58.030> wiggle<00:02:58.300> room<00:02:58.440> but<00:02:59.440> for<00:02:59.620> the<00:02:59.680> most<00:02:59.860> part

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
bit of wiggle room but for the most part

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.070 
bit of wiggle room but for the most part
I<00:03:00.250> got<00:03:00.340> it<00:03:00.459> all<00:03:00.580> lined<00:03:00.880> up<00:03:01.120> this<00:03:01.630> piece<00:03:01.870> right

here<00:03:02.140> is<00:03:02.410> just<00:03:02.739> an<00:03:02.860> extension<00:03:03.250> to<00:03:03.610> where<00:03:03.760> the

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
here is just an extension to where the

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.110 
here is just an extension to where the
cold<00:03:04.630> air<00:03:04.870> comes<00:03:05.260> down<00:03:05.530> and<00:03:05.860> then<00:03:06.070> feeds<00:03:06.760> on

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
cold air comes down and then feeds on

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.390 
cold air comes down and then feeds on
through<00:03:07.540> to<00:03:07.750> the<00:03:07.780> front<00:03:08.110> of<00:03:08.290> the<00:03:08.380> chassis<00:03:09.010> here

I'm going back with this foil tape and

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.090 
I'm going back with this foil tape and
I'm<00:04:29.210> just<00:04:29.419> applying<00:04:29.510> a<00:04:30.200> little<00:04:30.560> bit<00:04:30.680> on<00:04:30.889> each

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:31.100 
I'm just applying a little bit on each

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.610 
I'm just applying a little bit on each
of<00:04:31.340> these<00:04:31.729> scenes<00:04:32.150> is<00:04:32.510> this<00:04:33.139> really<00:04:33.470> necessary

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:33.620 
of these scenes is this really necessary

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:37.060 
of these scenes is this really necessary
I'm<00:04:34.460> not<00:04:34.729> really<00:04:34.910> sure<00:04:35.300> but<00:04:35.960> it<00:04:36.770> gives<00:04:36.979> me

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
I'm not really sure but it gives me

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:40.270 
I'm not really sure but it gives me
peace<00:04:37.220> of<00:04:37.580> mind<00:04:37.820> that<00:04:38.780> my<00:04:39.560> air<00:04:39.740> conditioning

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 
peace of mind that my air conditioning

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.930 
peace of mind that my air conditioning
is<00:04:40.600> sealed<00:04:41.600> I<00:04:41.990> think<00:04:42.440> it<00:04:42.530> can't<00:04:42.740> hurt<00:04:42.919> so<00:04:43.490> if

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
is sealed I think it can't hurt so if

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:46.270 
is sealed I think it can't hurt so if
you<00:04:44.090> have<00:04:44.300> this<00:04:44.570> and<00:04:44.840> I<00:04:45.380> had<00:04:45.590> a<00:04:45.620> whole<00:04:45.830> bunch<00:04:46.070> so
