00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.690
 the universal epistle of santiago 

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:04.730
 chapter 1 

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:08.119
 santiago sierra power god and the lord jesus christ 

00:00:08.119 --> 00:00:11.119
 to the twelve tribes that are in the dispersion 

00:00:12.399 --> 00:00:16.810
 My brothers you have for your brat when you go out in various tests 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.450
 Knowing that the test of your faith produces patience 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:26.300
 But have patience your complete work so that you are perfect and complete without 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.390
 that you lack something 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.999
 and if any of you lacks wisdom, ask God 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.600
 which gives to all abundantly and without reproach and will be nothing to him 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:40.080
 but ask with faith, not doubting anything 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.860
 because the one who doubts is similar to the wave of the sea 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.200
 that is dragged by the wind and thrown from one part to another 

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.440
 do not think then whoever does that will receive anything from the sr 

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.490
 the double-minded man is inconstant in all his ways 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:58.959
 the brother who is of humble condition 

00:00:58.959 --> 00:01:01.050
 there was not in his exaltation 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.370
 but the one who is rich 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.850
 in your mediation 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.850
 because he will pass like the flower of the grass 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.610
 because when the sun rises with scorching heat 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:14.410
 the grass dries its flower falls and perez in its beautiful appearance 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:17.410
 so the rich man will also fade in all his companies 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.430
 Blessed is the man who endures temptation 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:26.100
 because when he has withstood the test he will receive the crown of life that God has 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.230
 promised to those who love him 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:29.900
 when someone is tempted 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.600
 do not say that he is tempted by God because God can not be tempted by the 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.780
 bad or tempt anyone 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.770
 but each one is tempted when of his own concupiscence 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:42.830
 is attracted and seduced 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:48.170
 then concupiscence after he has conceived gives birth to sin 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.540
 and sin being consummated gives birth to death 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:54.039
 beloved brothers of mine 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:55.310
 no de reis 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:58.920
 all good the diva and all perfect gift of 100 from above 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.479
 of the father of the lights in which there is no change or shadow of variation 

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:09.070
 of his will he made us be born by the word of truth so that we are 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.719
 the first fruits of his creatures 

00:02:11.719 --> 00:02:13.679
 for this my beloved brothers 

00:02:13.679 --> 00:02:18.549
 Every man is ready to hear, it took a while to speak, it took a while to air 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:22.069
 because the wrath of man does not work the justice of God 

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:28.139
 Therefore, discarding all filth and abundance of malice, receive with 

00:02:28.139 --> 00:02:30.200
 meekness the implanted word 

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.879
 which can save your souls 

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:34.890
 but it will be doers of the word 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.900
 and not just auditors 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.439
 fooling yourselves 

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:44.189
 because if any of that and d'or of the word but it does not make hard of it this 

00:02:44.189 --> 00:02:47.669
 similar to the man who considers his natural face in a mirror 

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:51.079
 because he considers himself and leaves 

00:02:51.079 --> 00:02:53.179
 and then forget how it was 

00:02:53.179 --> 00:02:56.159
 more the one that looks attentively in the perfect law 

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:57.460
 the one of freedom 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:58.950
 and persevere in it 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:03.500
 not idol being the bid notice if they do not order the work this will be 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.769
 blessed in what he does 

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:08.340
 if anyone thinks he is religious among you 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:10.010
 and does not restrain his tongue 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.620
 but that deceives his heart the religion of such is vain 

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:18.419
 the pure and undefiled religion before God the sixth father 

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:21.840
 visit the orphans and the widows in their crews 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:22.939
 ibor to give without
