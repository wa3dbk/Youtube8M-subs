a<00:00:47.640> box<00:00:48.059> of<00:00:48.420> pizza<00:00:48.930> dough<00:00:49.079> but<00:00:49.530> if<00:00:49.680> you<00:00:49.800> would

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
a box of pizza dough but if you would

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.590 
a box of pizza dough but if you would
like<00:00:50.039> to<00:00:50.070> make<00:00:50.280> your<00:00:50.430> own<00:00:50.520> from<00:00:50.730> scratch<00:00:50.879> by

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
like to make your own from scratch by

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.810 
like to make your own from scratch by
all<00:00:51.840> means<00:00:52.079> it's<00:00:52.350> just<00:00:52.559> I'm<00:00:52.739> using<00:00:53.010> this<00:00:53.280> it

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
all means it's just I'm using this it

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.209 
all means it's just I'm using this it
also<00:00:54.059> comes<00:00:54.420> with<00:00:54.510> sauce<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:55.260> cheese<00:00:55.620> I<00:00:55.860> think

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
also comes with sauce and cheese I think

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.209 
also comes with sauce and cheese I think
so<00:00:56.760> that's<00:00:57.660> why<00:00:57.960> I<00:00:57.989> don't<00:00:58.170> have<00:00:58.320> any<00:00:58.559> pizza

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.660 
sauce but of course if you make it from
scratch<00:01:00.840> you're<00:01:01.199> gonna<00:01:01.289> need<00:01:01.559> to<00:01:01.859> get<00:01:02.039> sauce
