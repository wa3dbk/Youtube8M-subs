00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:06.190
 the buga 2015 is coming in the havel region 

00:00:03.729 --> 00:00:08.469
 noticeably closer everywhere you prepare yourself 

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:10.990
 in front of garden bridges and even vineyards 

00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:13.450
 but it will not just be new 

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.849
 created and built no one also sets 

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:18.010
 on tradition and history and such 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:20.470
 It is not surprising that one is the monk 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:22.780
 an old private garden in havelberg in 

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.740
 the list of the buga attractions 

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:25.740
 has recorded 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:34.969
 a cup of hot coffee last 

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:37.309
 noticeable sunbeams of the year in the 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:39.350
 face ln greet heinz and edeltraud 

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:41.480
 pause for a moment with your old monk 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.559
 garden in havelberg during his walk in the 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.559
 to enjoy autumn 

00:00:50.229 --> 00:00:53.500
 especially the choice 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.280
 but not only the autumn changes the 

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:00.050
 old munich garden here where the gifts of 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.989
 nature colorfully cover the table 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:05.840
 In 2015, guests will be hosted by buga 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:07.100
 2000 square meter private garden of the 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.899
 from a two meter high wall 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.039
 is then enclosed for all 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:12.039
 be open to visitors 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:21.370
 it is very elaborate so I too 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:24.990
 many helpers have so many friends and 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:27.010
 well-known neighbors who support 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.280
 Research on the buga will be nice 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:32.920
 be like the robe of the garden for 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.360
 the buga will be recaptured as well 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.310
 Historic buildings like the old one 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.500
 stone wall of the dome at the wish 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.520
 garden borders then an interesting one 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.740
 be eye catcher 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.140
 it became conscientious and expensive 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:46.240
 rehabilitated we really had many 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.430
 loose parts many stones had extra 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.990
 be fired for the project and 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.190
 Accordingly, also use and when 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.020
 We do not want to look any further 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.220
 make wall but get the charm 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.830
 and that's why we see them too 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.210
 different construction epochs and sections 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.770
 where ever something was done 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.600
 you look in the different stone 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:05.460
 sizes in different colors 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.460
 but as I said that we wanted to receive 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:11.360
 the historic wall apple-cherry and 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.550
 walnut monks garden will be the eye 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.170
 the viewer and the situation 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.530
 next to the cathedral high above the old town 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.930

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.650

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.810
 unobstructed view of the inspired 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.420
 It would be best that you stand down 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:31.090
 with a tripod and start immediately 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:34.030

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.189

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.560
 her crying that is here 

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:40.540

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.989
 midnight picture sequences and and the 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:46.390
 star yet you whether the increased 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:48.340
 gazebo was impressed on the meadow 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.650

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.230

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:59.099
