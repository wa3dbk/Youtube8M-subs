00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
atomic blimp and try to look through

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.619 
atomic blimp and try to look through
some<00:00:43.860> of<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.250> upper<00:00:44.640> story<00:00:45.000> windows<00:00:45.390> because

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
some of the upper story windows because

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.000 
some of the upper story windows because
you<00:00:45.870> can<00:00:45.989> actually<00:00:46.020> see<00:00:46.320> through<00:00:46.649> them<00:00:46.829> of

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
you can actually see through them of

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.680 
you can actually see through them of
course<00:00:47.579> there's<00:00:47.760> nothing<00:00:48.120> in<00:00:48.270> them<00:00:48.420> but<00:00:48.570> it

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
course there's nothing in them but it

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.810 
course there's nothing in them but it
just<00:00:48.840> kind<00:00:49.050> of<00:00:49.110> makes<00:00:49.260> me<00:00:49.500> wonder<00:00:49.710> why<00:00:50.520> would

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
just kind of makes me wonder why would

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.420 
just kind of makes me wonder why would
rock<00:00:51.270> star<00:00:51.629> just<00:00:52.020> have<00:00:52.500> that<00:00:52.829> like<00:00:53.039> that<00:00:53.250> why

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
rock star just have that like that why

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:54.740 
rock star just have that like that why
would<00:00:53.460> you<00:00:53.610> be<00:00:53.760> able<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:53.969> see<00:00:54.180> into<00:00:54.360> it<00:00:54.629> but

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
would you be able to see into it but

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.569 
would you be able to see into it but
there<00:00:54.870> be<00:00:54.960> nothing<00:00:55.140> in<00:00:55.440> there<00:00:55.620> it<00:00:55.890> may<00:00:56.160> be<00:00:56.219> just

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
there be nothing in there it may be just

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.750 
there be nothing in there it may be just
for<00:00:57.140> decorative<00:00:58.140> purposes<00:00:58.410> but<00:00:59.100> I<00:00:59.160> doubt<00:00:59.280> it

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
for decorative purposes but I doubt it

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.750 
for decorative purposes but I doubt it
um<00:01:00.260> the<00:01:01.260> kind<00:01:01.469> of<00:01:01.530> theory<00:01:01.710> that<00:01:01.859> I<00:01:01.980> have<00:01:02.219> and

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
um the kind of theory that I have and

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.149 
um the kind of theory that I have and
this<00:01:03.359> is<00:01:03.510> right<00:01:03.690> next<00:01:03.870> to<00:01:04.049> a<00:01:04.170> horse<00:01:04.619> racing

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
this is right next to a horse racing

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.710 
this is right next to a horse racing
track<00:01:05.189> I<00:01:05.489> hope<00:01:05.790> that's<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.119> correct<00:01:06.390> term<00:01:06.689> for

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
track I hope that's the correct term for

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.929 
track I hope that's the correct term for
that<00:01:07.140> but<00:01:07.380> those<00:01:08.100> two<00:01:08.250> kind<00:01:08.460> of<00:01:08.520> correspond

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
that but those two kind of correspond

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.670 
that but those two kind of correspond
you<00:01:09.060> know<00:01:09.150> horse<00:01:09.390> racing<00:01:09.930> and<00:01:10.080> betting<00:01:10.560> and

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
you know horse racing and betting and

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.130 
you know horse racing and betting and
gambling<00:01:10.830> but<00:01:11.790> it<00:01:11.939> just<00:01:12.090> kind<00:01:12.360> of<00:01:12.450> makes<00:01:12.900> me

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
gambling but it just kind of makes me

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.080 
gambling but it just kind of makes me
wonder<00:01:13.350> well<00:01:13.830> why<00:01:14.040> would<00:01:14.250> rock<00:01:14.460> star<00:01:14.729> put<00:01:14.939> this

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
wonder well why would rock star put this

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.570 
wonder well why would rock star put this
casino<00:01:15.509> here<00:01:15.750> have<00:01:16.020> it<00:01:16.049> be<00:01:17.009> able<00:01:17.220> or<00:01:17.310> have<00:01:17.490> you

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
casino here have it be able or have you

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.399 
casino here have it be able or have you
be<00:01:17.700> able<00:01:17.790> to<00:01:17.939> see<00:01:18.119> through<00:01:18.299> it<00:01:18.420> but<00:01:18.630> not<00:01:19.290> be

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
be able to see through it but not be

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.830 
be able to see through it but not be
able<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:19.619> do<00:01:19.740> anything<00:01:19.979> I<00:01:20.340> think<00:01:21.000> that<00:01:21.330> maybe

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
able to do anything I think that maybe

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.620 
able to do anything I think that maybe
or<00:01:22.049> my<00:01:22.200> theory<00:01:22.619> is<00:01:22.650> that<00:01:22.830> in<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.700> auto<00:01:24.180> maybe<00:01:24.540> a

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
or my theory is that in the auto maybe a

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.200 
or my theory is that in the auto maybe a
few<00:01:24.810> years<00:01:25.170> or<00:01:25.409> in<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.130> next<00:01:26.250> upcoming<00:01:26.520> DLC<00:01:26.850> is

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
few years or in the next upcoming DLC is

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:28.580 
few years or in the next upcoming DLC is
because<00:01:27.570> we<00:01:27.689> already<00:01:27.810> have<00:01:28.049> one<00:01:28.229> DLC

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
because we already have one DLC

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.830

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.420 
appearance in san andreas as well it was
just<00:02:54.959> the<00:02:55.170> third<00:02:55.590> city<00:02:55.860> you<00:02:55.950> know<00:02:56.010> the<00:02:56.160> remake

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430

of<00:02:56.459> Las<00:02:56.760> Vegas<00:02:56.790> but<00:02:57.450> I<00:02:57.690> think<00:02:58.170> if<00:02:58.260> they<00:02:58.349> were<00:02:58.440> at

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
of Las Vegas but I think if they were at

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:01.550 
of Las Vegas but I think if they were at
to<00:02:58.739> add<00:02:58.890> that<00:02:59.099> into<00:02:59.310> GTA<00:03:00.060> 5<00:03:00.420> they<00:03:01.319> can<00:03:01.470> make

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
to add that into GTA 5 they can make
