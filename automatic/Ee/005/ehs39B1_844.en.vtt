your friends if you appreciate what I'm

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.110 
your friends if you appreciate what I'm
doing<00:00:11.910> so<00:00:12.570> example<00:00:13.019> six<00:00:13.290> is<00:00:13.590> we<00:00:14.400> have<00:00:14.610> a<00:00:14.880> ring

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
doing so example six is we have a ring

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.470 
doing so example six is we have a ring
of<00:00:15.240> charge<00:00:16.820> ring<00:00:17.820> of<00:00:17.910> current<00:00:18.240> actually

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
of charge ring of current actually

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.320 
of charge ring of current actually
flowing<00:00:18.750> around<00:00:18.900> a<00:00:19.560> tie<00:00:20.960> radius<00:00:21.960> are<00:00:23.119> okay<00:00:24.119> and

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
flowing around a tie radius are okay and

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.320 
flowing around a tie radius are okay and
then<00:00:25.260> above<00:00:25.500> the<00:00:25.650> center<00:00:25.970> we<00:00:26.970> want<00:00:27.150> to<00:00:27.210> cut

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
then above the center we want to cut

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.290 
then above the center we want to cut
with<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.539> magnetic<00:00:27.779> field<00:00:27.900> peep<00:00:28.410> okay<00:00:29.150> so<00:00:30.150> if

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
with the magnetic field peep okay so if

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.860 
with the magnetic field peep okay so if
we<00:00:30.420> take<00:00:30.630> a<00:00:30.949> tiny<00:00:31.949> slice<00:00:32.399> of<00:00:32.730> this<00:00:33.000> ring<00:00:33.329> DL

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
we take a tiny slice of this ring DL

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:42.520 
we take a tiny slice of this ring DL
vector<00:00:34.280> and<00:00:35.809> we<00:00:36.809> have<00:00:37.050> our<00:00:37.230> R<00:00:37.500> vector<00:00:40.969> okay

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
vector and we have our R vector okay

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.290 
vector and we have our R vector okay
then<00:00:43.530> we<00:00:43.680> can<00:00:43.710> easily<00:00:44.370> calculate<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.879> B

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
then we can easily calculate the B

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.920 
then we can easily calculate the B
vector<00:00:45.450> so<00:00:46.110> DL<00:00:46.820> cross<00:00:47.820> R<00:00:48.120> vector<00:00:48.480> is<00:00:48.660> going<00:00:48.809> to

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
vector so DL cross R vector is going to

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:50.180 
vector so DL cross R vector is going to
be<00:00:49.020> perpendicular<00:00:49.320> both<00:00:49.739> these<00:00:49.829> vector<00:00:50.100> it's

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
be perpendicular both these vector it's

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.299 
be perpendicular both these vector it's
going<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:50.399> point<00:00:50.640> out<00:00:50.789> basically<00:00:51.210> like<00:00:51.420> this

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
going to point out basically like this

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:55.279 
going to point out basically like this
this<00:00:53.309> is<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.640> infinitesimal<00:00:54.300> DB<00:00:54.780> vector<00:00:55.079> and

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
this is the infinitesimal DB vector and

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.260 
this is the infinitesimal DB vector and
this<00:00:55.829> is<00:00:55.890> going<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.190> trace<00:00:56.370> out<00:00:56.489> a<00:00:56.520> cone<00:00:56.850> where

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
this is going to trace out a cone where

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.369 
this is going to trace out a cone where
the<00:00:57.390> horizontal<00:00:57.870> components<00:00:58.230> are<00:00:58.289> gonna

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
the horizontal components are gonna

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.720 
the horizontal components are gonna
cancel<00:00:58.590> and<00:00:58.859> you're<00:00:58.920> gonna<00:00:59.039> get<00:00:59.160> the<00:00:59.280> sum<00:00:59.520> of

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
cancel and you're gonna get the sum of

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.369 
cancel and you're gonna get the sum of
the<00:01:00.390> B<00:01:00.480> vector<00:01:00.629> okay<00:01:01.489> with<00:01:02.489> this<00:01:03.390> angle<00:01:03.899> and

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
the B vector okay with this angle and

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.270 
the B vector okay with this angle and
this<00:01:04.820> angle<00:01:05.820> is<00:01:06.000> Theta<00:01:06.260> okay<00:01:07.260> which<00:01:08.250> means

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
this angle is Theta okay which means

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.149 
this angle is Theta okay which means
that<00:01:08.729> this<00:01:08.850> angle<00:01:09.350> is<00:01:10.350> Theta<00:01:10.650> the<00:01:10.830> reason<00:01:11.070> why

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
that this angle is Theta the reason why

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.980 
that this angle is Theta the reason why
is<00:01:11.220> this<00:01:11.400> is<00:01:11.460> perpendicular<00:01:11.820> this<00:01:12.810> is

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
is this is perpendicular this is

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.310 
is this is perpendicular this is
perpendicular<00:01:14.869> more<00:01:15.869> importantly<00:01:16.170> this<00:01:16.259> is

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
perpendicular more importantly this is

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:20.289 
perpendicular more importantly this is
perpendicular<00:01:16.680> and<00:01:17.400> so<00:01:17.759> we<00:01:17.880> have<00:01:18.090> you<00:01:18.659> know

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:20.299 
perpendicular and so we have you know

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:25.780 
perpendicular and so we have you know
the

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:25.790 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.120 

this<00:01:26.450> is<00:01:26.600> perpendicular<00:01:26.900> so<00:01:27.290> we<00:01:27.380> have<00:01:27.560> this<00:01:27.920> is

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
this is perpendicular so we have this is

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.680 
this is perpendicular so we have this is
a<00:01:29.260> 180<00:01:30.260> minus<00:01:30.980> 90<00:01:31.010> minus<00:01:31.910> theta<00:01:32.090> so<00:01:32.450> this<00:01:32.570> is

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:32.690 
a 180 minus 90 minus theta so this is

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.670 
a 180 minus 90 minus theta so this is
Theta<00:01:33.490> 90<00:01:34.490> minus<00:01:34.730> theta<00:01:34.940> so<00:01:35.630> this<00:01:35.810> is<00:01:35.990> 90<00:01:36.320> plus

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:36.680 
Theta 90 minus theta so this is 90 plus

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.770 
Theta 90 minus theta so this is 90 plus
90<00:01:36.770> minus<00:01:37.250> theta<00:01:37.370> this<00:01:38.330> angle<00:01:38.390> has<00:01:38.660> to<00:01:38.720> be

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
90 minus theta this angle has to be

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.660 
90 minus theta this angle has to be
theta<00:01:38.960> in<00:01:39.290> order<00:01:39.440> to<00:01:39.500> get<00:01:39.620> 180<00:01:40.010> degrees<00:01:40.280> inside

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
theta in order to get 180 degrees inside

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.620 
theta in order to get 180 degrees inside
of<00:01:40.820> that<00:01:40.880> triangle<00:01:41.530> so<00:01:43.180> we<00:01:44.180> can<00:01:44.330> just<00:01:44.510> write

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
of that triangle so we can just write

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.590 
of that triangle so we can just write
out<00:01:44.780> our<00:01:45.070> yellow<00:01:46.070> savart<00:01:46.430> law<00:01:46.460> for<00:01:47.210> this<00:01:47.300> case

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:49.600 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.350 

that's<00:01:50.600> Mia<00:01:50.810> naught<00:01:51.020> over<00:01:51.620> 4<00:01:51.740> pi<00:01:52.130> and<00:01:53.090> we<00:01:53.270> have

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:53.360 
that's Mia naught over 4 pi and we have

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:54.640 
that's Mia naught over 4 pi and we have
a<00:01:53.390> constant<00:01:53.840> current<00:01:53.960> we're<00:01:54.200> integrating

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:54.650 
a constant current we're integrating

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.170 
a constant current we're integrating
across<00:01:54.950> that<00:01:55.130> loop<00:01:55.450> well<00:01:56.450> that's<00:01:56.600> gonna<00:01:56.690> be<00:01:56.780> DL

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180 
across that loop well that's gonna be DL

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:00.880 
across that loop well that's gonna be DL
across<00:01:59.180> our<00:01:59.540> hat<00:01:59.960> but<00:02:00.200> they're<00:02:00.380> perpendicular

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
across our hat but they're perpendicular

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.680 
across our hat but they're perpendicular
so<00:02:01.340> it's<00:02:01.460> just<00:02:01.550> DL<00:02:02.620> over<00:02:03.620> R<00:02:03.800> squared<00:02:04.540> but<00:02:05.540> only

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:05.690 
so it's just DL over R squared but only

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:07.600 
so it's just DL over R squared but only
the<00:02:05.960> cosine<00:02:06.560> theta<00:02:06.800> component<00:02:07.370> of<00:02:07.430> that's

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
the cosine theta component of that's

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:08.980 
the cosine theta component of that's
going<00:02:07.790> to<00:02:07.850> be<00:02:07.970> contributing<00:02:08.240> to<00:02:08.630> the<00:02:08.840> end

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
going to be contributing to the end

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:10.840 
going to be contributing to the end
result<00:02:09.110> because<00:02:09.679> the<00:02:09.920> horizontal<00:02:10.490> components

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
result because the horizontal components

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:12.190 
result because the horizontal components
will<00:02:10.940> cancel<00:02:10.970> out<00:02:11.300> so<00:02:11.480> take<00:02:11.630> cosine<00:02:11.960> theta

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
will cancel out so take cosine theta

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.020 
will cancel out so take cosine theta
there<00:02:12.380> this<00:02:12.770> isn't<00:02:12.950> the<00:02:13.130> cosine<00:02:13.490> theta<00:02:13.730> of<00:02:13.910> the

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
there this isn't the cosine theta of the

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.780 
there this isn't the cosine theta of the
DL

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
DL

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.030 
DL
this<00:02:16.790> isn't<00:02:17.090> theta<00:02:17.300> of<00:02:17.540> the<00:02:17.690> angle<00:02:18.260> DL<00:02:18.620> and<00:02:18.860> our

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
this isn't theta of the angle DL and our

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.699 
this isn't theta of the angle DL and our

00:02:21.699 --> 00:02:21.709 
this is Theta of the vertical component

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:23.230 
this is Theta of the vertical component
there<00:02:21.860> so<00:02:22.130> don't<00:02:22.490> get<00:02:22.580> that<00:02:22.730> confused<00:02:23.000> in<00:02:23.150> your

there so don't get that confused in your

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:24.610 
there so don't get that confused in your
mind<00:02:23.390> so<00:02:23.870> you<00:02:23.930> can<00:02:24.080> pull<00:02:24.200> out<00:02:24.260> all<00:02:24.470> the

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:24.620 
mind so you can pull out all the

mind so you can pull out all the
constant<00:02:25.040> components<00:02:26.800> is<00:02:27.800> constant<00:02:28.310> the<00:02:28.760> arc

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
constant components is constant the arc

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.290

gonna<00:02:32.390> change<00:02:32.690> and<00:02:33.560> it<00:02:33.800> will<00:02:33.920> VL<00:02:34.220> well<00:02:35.209> now<00:02:35.570> we

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
gonna change and it will VL well now we

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:41.800 
gonna change and it will VL well now we
have<00:02:37.450> you<00:02:38.450> know<00:02:38.540> 2<00:02:38.600> 4<00:02:38.900> pi<00:02:39.080> I<00:02:40.180> what<00:02:41.180> is<00:02:41.450> cosine

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
have you know 2 4 pi I what is cosine

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.840 
have you know 2 4 pi I what is cosine
theta<00:02:42.080> cosine<00:02:42.640> theta<00:02:43.640> is<00:02:43.910> just<00:02:44.269> R<00:02:45.110> over<00:02:46.100> the

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
theta cosine theta is just R over the

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.860 
theta cosine theta is just R over the
length<00:02:47.030> of<00:02:47.150> our<00:02:47.239> so<00:02:47.480> we<00:02:47.570> get<00:02:47.720> R<00:02:49.030> over<00:02:50.030> R<00:02:50.060> times<00:02:50.600> 1

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
length of our so we get R over R times 1

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:53.020 
length of our so we get R over R times 1
over<00:02:50.900> R<00:02:51.170> squared<00:02:51.500> so<00:02:52.340> we<00:02:52.400> have<00:02:52.489> R<00:02:52.610> cubed<00:02:52.880> on<00:02:52.940> the

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:53.030 
over R squared so we have R cubed on the

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:54.729 
over R squared so we have R cubed on the
bottom<00:02:53.300> and<00:02:53.480> what's<00:02:54.260> the<00:02:54.380> length<00:02:54.560> of<00:02:54.680> this

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739

circle<00:02:55.100> 2<00:02:55.700> PI<00:02:55.880> R<00:02:56.200> ok<00:02:57.880> our<00:03:01.390> R<00:03:02.390> squared<00:03:02.450> actually

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
circle 2 PI R ok our R squared actually

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.440 
circle 2 PI R ok our R squared actually
is<00:03:03.350> equal<00:03:03.709> to<00:03:03.890> the<00:03:04.280> distance<00:03:04.459> here<00:03:04.820> is<00:03:04.850> Z<00:03:05.180> I

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
is equal to the distance here is Z I

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.140 
is equal to the distance here is Z I
write<00:03:06.230> that<00:03:06.380> down<00:03:06.530> earlier<00:03:06.800> no<00:03:06.920> I<00:03:06.950> did<00:03:07.160> Z

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
write that down earlier no I did Z

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:09.640 
write that down earlier no I did Z
squared<00:03:08.420> plus<00:03:08.450> R<00:03:08.720> squared<00:03:08.780> it's<00:03:09.410> a<00:03:09.500> right

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
squared plus R squared it's a right

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.100 
squared plus R squared it's a right
triangle<00:03:09.890> okay<00:03:10.910> Z<00:03:11.300> and<00:03:11.480> are<00:03:11.600> perpendicular

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
triangle okay Z and are perpendicular

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:16.600 
triangle okay Z and are perpendicular
and<00:03:12.700> so<00:03:13.700> R<00:03:14.030> cubed<00:03:14.450> has<00:03:15.410> to<00:03:15.620> be<00:03:15.739> Z<00:03:15.890> squared<00:03:16.220> plus

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
and so R cubed has to be Z squared plus

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:19.210 
and so R cubed has to be Z squared plus
R<00:03:16.760> squared<00:03:16.840> all<00:03:17.840> of<00:03:18.560> that<00:03:18.709> to<00:03:18.920> the<00:03:19.040> three

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
R squared all of that to the three

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.690 
R squared all of that to the three
halves<00:03:19.570> and<00:03:20.570> so<00:03:20.750> we<00:03:20.900> get<00:03:21.050> u<00:03:21.380> naught<00:03:21.560> over<00:03:21.980> 4<00:03:22.310> pi

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
halves and so we get u naught over 4 pi

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:28.120 
halves and so we get u naught over 4 pi
I<00:03:24.730> R<00:03:25.730> squared<00:03:26.300> I<00:03:26.450> forgot<00:03:27.290> to<00:03:27.440> cross<00:03:27.709> off<00:03:27.890> these

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
I R squared I forgot to cross off these

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:30.270 
I R squared I forgot to cross off these
guys<00:03:28.340> so<00:03:29.209> I<00:03:29.269> have<00:03:29.420> 2<00:03:29.600> on<00:03:29.720> the<00:03:29.810> bottom<00:03:30.080> there

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
guys so I have 2 on the bottom there

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:34.660 
guys so I have 2 on the bottom there
over<00:03:32.140> these<00:03:33.140> squared<00:03:33.380> plus<00:03:33.560> R<00:03:33.680> squared<00:03:34.010> to<00:03:34.639> the

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:34.670 
over these squared plus R squared to the

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:35.890 
over these squared plus R squared to the
three-halves

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
three-halves

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.410 
three-halves
and<00:03:36.049> that's<00:03:36.769> the<00:03:36.950> answer<00:03:37.099> for<00:03:37.580> the<00:03:38.000> magnetic

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:38.420 
and that's the answer for the magnetic

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:43.720 
and that's the answer for the magnetic
field<00:03:39.220> pointing<00:03:40.220> up<00:03:41.260> a<00:03:42.459> distance<00:03:43.459> away<00:03:43.610> from

field pointing up a distance away from
this<00:03:44.090> current<00:03:44.959> now<00:03:45.170> if<00:03:45.290> we<00:03:45.379> flip<00:03:45.830> the<00:03:45.950> current

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
this current now if we flip the current

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.280 
this current now if we flip the current
around<00:03:46.459> this<00:03:47.299> would<00:03:47.480> obviously<00:03:47.510> change<00:03:48.049> signs

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
around this would obviously change signs

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.020 
around this would obviously change signs
to<00:03:48.470> negative<00:03:48.860> that<00:03:49.010> the<00:03:49.190> magnetic<00:03:49.730> field

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
to negative that the magnetic field

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.199 
to negative that the magnetic field
could<00:03:50.150> point<00:03:50.390> down<00:03:51.129> and<00:03:52.129> this<00:03:52.370> is<00:03:52.430> typically

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:53.209 
could point down and this is typically

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:54.280 
could point down and this is typically
you'll<00:03:53.360> find<00:03:53.569> this<00:03:53.810> kind<00:03:54.049> of<00:03:54.079> arrangement

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:54.290 
you'll find this kind of arrangement

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:55.780 
you'll find this kind of arrangement
where<00:03:54.650> you<00:03:54.680> have<00:03:54.890> a<00:03:54.920> circling<00:03:55.310> charged<00:03:55.640> in

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
where you have a circling charged in

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:57.910 
where you have a circling charged in
something<00:03:56.030> like<00:03:56.120> a<00:03:56.180> solenoid<00:03:56.590> which<00:03:57.590> I'm<00:03:57.769> sure

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
something like a solenoid which I'm sure

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.500 
something like a solenoid which I'm sure
we'll<00:03:58.099> cover<00:03:58.250> more<00:03:58.340> later<00:03:58.610> so<00:03:58.879> learner<00:03:59.450> is

00:03:59.500 --> 00:03:59.510 
we'll cover more later so learner is

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:02.800 
we'll cover more later so learner is
basically<00:03:59.750> a<00:03:59.870> wire<00:04:00.079> wrapped<00:04:01.510> tightly<00:04:02.510> like

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
basically a wire wrapped tightly like

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.430 
basically a wire wrapped tightly like
this<00:04:04.150> each<00:04:05.150> time<00:04:05.599> that<00:04:05.840> it's<00:04:06.110> one<00:04:06.230> that<00:04:06.319> I've

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
this each time that it's one that I've

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.250 
this each time that it's one that I've
loops<00:04:06.680> you're<00:04:07.579> adding<00:04:08.060> to<00:04:08.810> that<00:04:08.959> magnetic

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
loops you're adding to that magnetic

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:10.660 
loops you're adding to that magnetic
field<00:04:09.620> you're<00:04:09.799> going<00:04:09.829> to<00:04:09.980> get<00:04:10.160> a<00:04:10.190> distance<00:04:10.579> Z

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:10.670 
field you're going to get a distance Z

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:12.970 
field you're going to get a distance Z
above<00:04:11.060> so<00:04:11.930> if<00:04:12.019> you<00:04:12.109> loop<00:04:12.260> ten<00:04:12.470> times<00:04:12.500> you<00:04:12.890> can

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
above so if you loop ten times you can

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:14.319 
above so if you loop ten times you can
get<00:04:13.099> ten<00:04:13.340> times<00:04:13.579> the<00:04:13.910> strength<00:04:14.150> of<00:04:14.239> that

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:14.329 
get ten times the strength of that

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:15.789 
get ten times the strength of that
magnetic<00:04:14.720> field<00:04:14.900> with<00:04:15.140> the<00:04:15.260> same<00:04:15.440> current

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:16.479 
magnetic field with the same current
okay

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
okay

pretty pretty fun stuff okay wrapping up

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.170 
pretty pretty fun stuff okay wrapping up
conclusion<00:04:20.320> okay<00:04:21.320> so<00:04:22.070> we<00:04:22.280> had<00:04:22.520> biot-savart

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 
conclusion okay so we had biot-savart

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:25.960
