great exercise my favorite exercise to

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:42.540 
great exercise my favorite exercise to
supplement<00:00:40.480> that<00:00:40.629> is<00:00:41.110> weighted<00:00:41.620> dips<00:00:41.860> what

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:42.550 
supplement that is weighted dips what

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.549 
supplement that is weighted dips what
weighted<00:00:42.879> dips<00:00:43.120> are<00:00:43.360> going<00:00:43.600> to<00:00:43.719> do<00:00:43.930> is<00:00:44.379> they're

00:00:44.549 --> 00:00:44.559 
weighted dips are going to do is they're

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:46.680 
weighted dips are going to do is they're
going<00:00:44.590> to<00:00:44.770> make<00:00:44.890> your<00:00:45.039> triceps<00:00:45.610> a<00:00:45.940> lot<00:00:46.480> more

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:46.690 
going to make your triceps a lot more

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:48.869 
going to make your triceps a lot more
explosive<00:00:47.320> make<00:00:47.590> them<00:00:47.739> a<00:00:47.770> lot<00:00:47.890> stronger<00:00:48.219> so

00:00:48.869 --> 00:00:48.879

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:50.710 
when you're benching you get the weight

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.830 
when you're benching you get the weight
off<00:00:50.739> your<00:00:51.100> chest<00:00:51.399> and<00:00:51.670> as<00:00:52.360> soon<00:00:52.539> as<00:00:52.600> you<00:00:52.750> get

off your chest and as soon as you get
that<00:00:52.989> weight<00:00:53.140> off<00:00:53.289> your<00:00:53.440> chest<00:00:53.739> it's<00:00:54.039> going<00:00:54.430> to

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:54.489 
that weight off your chest it's going to

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:56.400 
that weight off your chest it's going to
give<00:00:54.640> you<00:00:54.730> a<00:00:54.760> lot<00:00:55.120> more<00:00:55.149> explosion<00:00:56.079> in<00:00:56.170> order

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.410 
give you a lot more explosion in order

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.069 
give you a lot more explosion in order
to<00:00:56.590> get<00:00:56.890> that<00:00:57.100> weight<00:00:57.309> up<00:00:57.489> and<00:00:57.699> lock<00:00:58.030> it<00:00:58.239> out<00:00:58.329> so

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:29.980 
since we're trying to work weighted dips

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:31.410 
since we're trying to work weighted dips
and<00:01:30.280> we're<00:01:30.400> trying<00:01:30.580> to<00:01:30.640> build<00:01:30.730> explosiveness

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 
and we're trying to build explosiveness

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:32.970 
and we're trying to build explosiveness
if<00:01:31.960> we<00:01:32.080> want<00:01:32.260> to<00:01:32.320> lean<00:01:32.440> a<00:01:32.470> little<00:01:32.680> bit<00:01:32.830> more

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:32.980 
if we want to lean a little bit more

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:34.980 
if we want to lean a little bit more
forward<00:01:33.430> to<00:01:33.790> bring<00:01:34.000> our<00:01:34.120> chest<00:01:34.360> into<00:01:34.690> it<00:01:34.810> but

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:34.990 
forward to bring our chest into it but

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:38.520 
forward to bring our chest into it but
still<00:01:35.290> be<00:01:35.440> working<00:01:35.680> or<00:01:36.250> try<00:01:36.640> something<00:01:37.030> so<00:01:37.900> you

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
still be working or try something so you

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
still be working or try something so you
start<00:01:38.800> out<00:01:38.950> parallel<00:01:40.920> come<00:01:41.920> on<00:01:42.100> explode<00:01:42.520> up

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:42.550 
start out parallel come on explode up

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:47.040 
start out parallel come on explode up
down<00:01:43.590> up<00:01:44.590> down<00:01:45.750> okay

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.050 
down up down okay

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.950 
down up down okay
just<00:01:47.500> like<00:01:47.620> that<00:01:48.180> now<00:01:49.180> I'm<00:01:49.300> not<00:01:49.480> locking<00:01:49.690> out

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:49.960 
just like that now I'm not locking out

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.500 
just like that now I'm not locking out
because<00:01:50.830> I'm<00:01:51.010> not<00:01:51.160> trying<00:01:51.430> to<00:01:51.550> put<00:01:51.790> on<00:01:52.030> any

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:52.510 
because I'm not trying to put on any

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:58.290 
because I'm not trying to put on any
unnecessary<00:01:53.500> stress<00:01:53.890> on<00:01:54.760> my<00:01:55.630> elbows<00:01:56.640> so<00:01:57.640> you

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.300 
unnecessary stress on my elbows so you

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.240 
unnecessary stress on my elbows so you
can<00:01:58.450> lock<00:01:58.660> out<00:01:58.840> if<00:01:58.990> you<00:01:59.080> want<00:01:59.350> but<00:01:59.860> I<00:02:00.190> don't

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
can lock out if you want but I don't

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:01.710 
can lock out if you want but I don't
recommend<00:02:00.700> it<00:02:00.970> because<00:02:01.150> all<00:02:01.450> you're<00:02:01.570> going<00:02:01.660> to

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
recommend it because all you're going to
