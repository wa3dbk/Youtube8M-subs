00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:10.920
 we are in west in cuba 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.420
 here we can see the lion 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.260
 big isc 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:19.470
 he is on the other side north 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:24.680
 He missed a day to recognize ever 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.680
 had come to this side of sbt 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.800
 so far the victim 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.970
 I can not conceive that we have not 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.079
 coming here yet 

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:41.969
 ae 

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:41.969
 when you pacaembu or site 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:07.490
 one thing that we're noticing here 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:09.590
 there are a lot of old people, you do not know if 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.289
 people retire and will move here 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:16.360
 but there is rather a very large concentration 

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:16.360
 Even here is the public garden 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.229
 The girl comes to us and commented that 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.240
 here you have a very beautiful view between 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:27.460
 here for you to see 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.460
 This is the clue the girl recommended to us. 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:41.810
 is a very pleasant place in the attack so 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:44.870
 strong and saw the child cries very nice 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:47.870
 liked the 4 o'clock 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.870
 ae 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:02:31.080
 the first age observes where the 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:34.560
 children tone on this link here we are 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.510
 walking here on the beach in the area but is 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.250
 basically a stone beach so so 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:41.810
 but it's very difficult to walk, I think 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:41.810
 also worth for barefoot 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:53.950
 look erick the first time he 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:03:01.209
 climb the tree 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:03:06.940
 O the tree with the tone rose the sensation touches 

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:07.660
 that the little monkey is very good to me 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.720
 dear ones 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.790
 and look what I just visited will 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.550
 turn into a curve so that we were 

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.800
 slipper or leave the park but nice 

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:19.060
 it's worth coming here yes and it 's 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.400
 awesome how we 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.420
 four years ago to almost 5 we never 

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.340
 came here 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.620
 we are always much younger quiet but 

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:28.180
 I never came very close to kanye west 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.750
 vancouver nÃ© 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:34.150
 has more is cool is well recommended 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:36.880
 That's it, people worth what you have to 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:38.380
 do here folks 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.799
 the staff liked the video have to do 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:45.930
 what's a queen and this is very good is this 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:48.970
 then do what I think I asked her out 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:54.299
 also our channel on facebook etc 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:54.299
