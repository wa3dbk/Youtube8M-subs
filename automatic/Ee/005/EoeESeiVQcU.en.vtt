00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
I was first introduced to games like

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.680 
I was first introduced to games like
this<00:00:52.500> a<00:00:52.829> little<00:00:53.610> monster<00:00:53.789> at<00:00:54.149> the<00:00:54.210> bottom<00:00:54.480> I

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
this a little monster at the bottom I

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.209 
this a little monster at the bottom I
don't<00:00:55.230> know<00:00:55.289> what<00:00:55.410> it's<00:00:55.530> called<00:00:55.770> but<00:00:55.949> I<00:00:56.010> love

that<00:00:56.399> game<00:00:56.930> which<00:00:57.930> is<00:00:58.079> probably<00:00:58.440> why<00:00:58.620> I<00:00:58.649> like

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
that game which is probably why I like

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.590 
that game which is probably why I like
this<00:00:59.190> game<00:00:59.399> too<00:00:59.670> because<00:00:59.969> it<00:01:00.059> reminds<00:01:00.359> me<00:01:00.510> of

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
this game too because it reminds me of

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.250 
this game too because it reminds me of
