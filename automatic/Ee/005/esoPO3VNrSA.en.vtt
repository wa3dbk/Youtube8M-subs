00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:15.389
 the biozone is a company that is 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.430
 specialized in everything that is 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.710
 acquiring the aerial image on the one hand 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:23.369
 classic images but also 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:26.070
 infrared images in thermography and 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:29.009
 especially since two years we work 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.989
 a leader system is a scanner 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:33.270
 laser that can restore the 

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:35.280
 topography and from dr on a 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.670
 developed a small system that makes 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.100
 barely 2 kg and who does what we do 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.740
 usually with very big planes 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.920
 and the huge ways 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:49.140
 this system will emit a laser beam here 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.060
 is scanned constantly it does 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.120
 seventeen thousand measure per second 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:56.520
 it will scan the ground permanently and 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.220
 so we restore ourselves a model 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.470
 three-dimensional 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.990
 the landscape is a system completely 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:05.030
 integrated which includes the battery for 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:09.170
 the power supply the central 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:11.060
 inertial the laser is a small 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.540
 embedded computer that will record 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.170
 the data is the first instrument 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.170
 in this place 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.590
 interest it is higher level 

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:29.320
 technique that if we fix and de 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:31.479
 to be able to have a 3d model a reality 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.040
 it can be vegetation that can 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:35.290
 to be buildings it can be 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.659
 archaeological sites to be able to do 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.759
 measurements on it's on these sites 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:41.380
 in fact we will be able to measure 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:45.960
 volumes measure distances from 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.960
 surfaces thanks to the acquired data 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.799
 we will be able to highlight 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.210
 archaeological remains that are even 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:55.000
 located under the vegetation 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:57.399
 we see that here these compounds of trees 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.590
 actually love the leader comes to him 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:01.750
 get through and that's going to give access 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.369
 to this type of data from people who 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.570
 is currently do not have access for 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:06.039
 reasons of costs since a 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.460
 acquiring me of classical art that can 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:08.460
 very expensive 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.499
