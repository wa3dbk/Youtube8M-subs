00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:08.980
 or not 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:11.430
 no no 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.700
 I 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:13.700
 Y 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:23.680
 we come to October we are about to finish 

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:27.300
 the year and this month is special of the 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:30.009
 children to lorin come and come sweet 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.710
 candy sugar action sugar and more 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:34.480
 sugar is very important that we are 

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:37.059
 pending the nutrition of our 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.040
 children we want some healthy children a 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:41.710
 generation that lives longer than we do 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.600
 today I have a breakfast or a snack 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.960
 super simple for children to 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:48.950
 you only need five minutes what 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.940
 previous 

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.940
 very rich 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:01.440
 a percentage for operation but 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:06.800
 this one is healthy in fats 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.800
 polyisaturated and trans part 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:13.390
 blueberries oats a little milk 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:16.840
 almonds and they 're already for breakfast 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:20.340
 let's make it super simple a table 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:25.290
 of assets for example was a person 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.290
 then everything is doubled 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.420
 now also a milk table of 

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:35.420
 almonds 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.960
 best 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.090
 of almonds 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.910
 almond trees 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.910
 this hour 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:09.190
 the idea is that the consistency of the 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.190
 oatmeal to see here 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.340
 we draw 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:24.920
 now let's put together the lovely breakfast 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:29.470
 in the night is that all the magic happens 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.470
 a spoonful of oats 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.810
 and now a layer of blueberries 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.930
 I like this fruit because it is full of 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.910
 antioxidants but can replace it 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.550
 for any fruit can be used 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.800
 may be cranberries may be 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:54.500
 strawberries 

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:59.020
 studying the preference every time a 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.020
 little bit more organic 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:07.400
 and organic 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.400
 that we throw another layer of sand 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.590
 is an option or an alternative to 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:20.420
 cereal that they eat every day that is 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:22.910
 full of sweets so it 's always a 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:25.990
 perfect option for the second I'm going to 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.990
 throw more blueberries 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.460
 as they may be peanuts almonds 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.530
 important that they do not come salty and 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:38.980
 sweetens 2 

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:41.550
 the idea that the day full of 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:41.550
 God 

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:44.690
 little bit 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.590
 and we finish with another touch of 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.590
 cranberries 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:04.569
 and ready, do not put in the fridge at night 

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:06.370
 is where all the magic happens the good 

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:09.519
 absorb the taste of the milk while 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:12.400
 without sweetening the other day a hotel a 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:14.140
 super easy breakfast can take you to the 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.040
 college to university to work 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.040
 when they have time 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:21.810
 and ready 

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:24.390
 I hope to see you in a next opportunity 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:26.310

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:28.740
