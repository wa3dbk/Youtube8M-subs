go at showing you how to do this today
as<00:00:27.199> a<00:00:27.560> side<00:00:27.829> braid<00:00:28.099> so<00:00:28.669> all<00:00:28.910> you're<00:00:29.029> gonna<00:00:29.150> need

00:00:29.229 --> 00:00:29.239 
as a side braid so all you're gonna need

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:32.979 
as a side braid so all you're gonna need
is<00:00:29.630> um<00:00:30.079> two<00:00:30.679> small<00:00:31.009> hair<00:00:31.189> elastics<00:00:31.640> to<00:00:32.000> tie<00:00:32.870> off

00:00:32.979 --> 00:00:32.989 
is um two small hair elastics to tie off

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:37.180 
is um two small hair elastics to tie off
the<00:00:33.110> hair<00:00:34.780> so<00:00:35.780> to<00:00:36.320> start<00:00:36.500> off<00:00:36.650> with<00:00:36.830> I'm<00:00:37.040> going

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.190 
the hair so to start off with I'm going

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.410 
the hair so to start off with I'm going
to<00:00:37.250> sweep<00:00:37.430> all<00:00:37.640> of<00:00:37.730> my<00:00:37.970> hair<00:00:38.180> to<00:00:38.660> one<00:00:38.930> side<00:00:38.989> and

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:40.420 
to sweep all of my hair to one side and

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.810 
to sweep all of my hair to one side and
I'm<00:00:41.420> gonna<00:00:41.629> split<00:00:41.900> it<00:00:42.170> into<00:00:42.320> three<00:00:42.800> as<00:00:43.280> if<00:00:43.670> I

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820 
I'm gonna split it into three as if I

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.600 
I'm gonna split it into three as if I
was<00:00:43.940> doing<00:00:44.150> a<00:00:44.360> normal<00:00:44.540> three-strand<00:00:45.019> braid

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:45.610 
was doing a normal three-strand braid

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:48.010 
was doing a normal three-strand braid
now<00:00:46.610> the<00:00:46.670> way<00:00:46.910> this<00:00:47.090> is<00:00:47.210> gonna<00:00:47.360> happen<00:00:47.510> is

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.020 
now the way this is gonna happen is

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.049 
now the way this is gonna happen is
you're<00:00:48.260> gonna<00:00:48.350> pass<00:00:48.620> it<00:00:49.190> over<00:00:49.340> to<00:00:49.610> start<00:00:49.910> off

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:50.059 
you're gonna pass it over to start off

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:52.360 
you're gonna pass it over to start off
with<00:00:50.270> just<00:00:50.600> as<00:00:50.840> you<00:00:50.930> would<00:00:51.079> a<00:00:51.110> normal<00:00:51.370> normal

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:52.370 
with just as you would a normal normal

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.049 
with just as you would a normal normal
braid<00:00:53.230> so<00:00:54.230> now<00:00:54.410> each<00:00:54.680> time<00:00:55.100> we<00:00:55.460> pass<00:00:55.699> over<00:00:55.879> a

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
braid so now each time we pass over a

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:58.119 
braid so now each time we pass over a
new<00:00:56.210> section<00:00:56.660> we're<00:00:57.199> going<00:00:57.350> to<00:00:57.440> start<00:00:57.680> off<00:00:57.859> by

00:00:58.119 --> 00:00:58.129 
new section we're going to start off by

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:00.790 
new section we're going to start off by
taking<00:00:59.030> a<00:00:59.180> small<00:00:59.239> section<00:00:59.750> of<00:00:59.989> hair<00:01:00.050> out<00:01:00.469> of

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
taking a small section of hair out of

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.600 
taking a small section of hair out of
the<00:01:00.920> braid<00:01:01.280> out<00:01:02.090> of<00:01:02.149> that<00:01:02.420> section<00:01:03.430> before<00:01:04.430> we

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
the braid out of that section before we

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:12.460 
the braid out of that section before we
pass<00:01:04.789> it<00:01:05.000> over<00:01:10.600> so<00:01:11.600> then<00:01:11.750> the<00:01:12.020> section<00:01:12.380> from

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:12.470 
pass it over so then the section from

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.620 
pass it over so then the section from
the<00:01:12.619> back<00:01:12.770> I'm<00:01:13.070> gonna<00:01:13.250> take<00:01:13.910> a<00:01:14.090> small<00:01:14.240> section

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
the back I'm gonna take a small section

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.880 
the back I'm gonna take a small section
at<00:01:14.929> love<00:01:15.340> just<00:01:16.340> put<00:01:16.460> it<00:01:16.550> behind<00:01:17.350> and<00:01:18.350> then<00:01:18.619> pass

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
at love just put it behind and then pass

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:24.200 
at love just put it behind and then pass
that<00:01:19.130> over

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.809 

so<00:01:25.210> you've<00:01:25.329> just<00:01:25.359> got<00:01:25.600> to<00:01:25.630> remember<00:01:26.399> each<00:01:27.399> time

00:01:27.809 --> 00:01:27.819 
so you've just got to remember each time

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:40.390 
so you've just got to remember each time
to<00:01:28.359> take<00:01:28.600> a<00:01:28.810> small<00:01:29.289> section<00:01:29.770> of<00:01:30.069> hair<00:01:30.130> out

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:02:15.759 

and<00:01:40.910> then<00:01:41.060> pass<00:01:41.300> over

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:15.769 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:18.890 

and<00:02:16.769> then<00:02:17.550> once<00:02:17.910> you<00:02:18.060> feel<00:02:18.239> like<00:02:18.269> the<00:02:18.690> hairs

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
and then once you feel like the hairs

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:20.570 
and then once you feel like the hairs
kind<00:02:19.170> of<00:02:19.260> got<00:02:19.379> too<00:02:19.620> small<00:02:19.800> so<00:02:20.099> you<00:02:20.190> can't<00:02:20.430> be

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
kind of got too small so you can't be

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.430 
kind of got too small so you can't be
taking<00:02:20.879> any<00:02:21.120> more<00:02:21.239> bits<00:02:21.480> out<00:02:21.660> you<00:02:22.140> just<00:02:22.230> want

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
taking any more bits out you just want

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.259 
taking any more bits out you just want
to<00:02:22.560> continue<00:02:22.950> it<00:02:23.160> down<00:02:23.340> just<00:02:23.670> as<00:02:23.819> a<00:02:23.879> normal

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
to continue it down just as a normal

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:31.460 
to continue it down just as a normal
three-strand<00:02:24.450> braid<00:02:29.269> and<00:02:30.269> then<00:02:30.870> once<00:02:31.200> you<00:02:31.349> get

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
three-strand braid and then once you get

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:32.600 
three-strand braid and then once you get
to<00:02:31.590> the<00:02:31.680> end<00:02:31.830> of<00:02:31.950> the<00:02:32.010> hair<00:02:32.130> you<00:02:32.250> just<00:02:32.400> want<00:02:32.550> to

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:32.610 
to the end of the hair you just want to

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.890 
to the end of the hair you just want to
take<00:02:32.819> the<00:02:33.330> small<00:02:33.630> hair<00:02:33.810> elastic<00:02:34.200> and<00:02:34.380> tie<00:02:34.410> off

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
take the small hair elastic and tie off

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.539 
take the small hair elastic and tie off
so<00:02:36.900> if<00:02:37.200> you<00:02:37.349> see<00:02:37.530> now<00:02:37.709> and<00:02:37.739> I<00:02:37.980> hold<00:02:38.220> this<00:02:38.340> out

00:02:38.539 --> 00:02:38.549 
so if you see now and I hold this out

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:40.280 
so if you see now and I hold this out
you<00:02:38.730> can<00:02:38.760> see<00:02:38.910> all<00:02:39.299> these<00:02:39.510> kind<00:02:39.780> of<00:02:39.870> sections

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
you can see all these kind of sections

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.750 
you can see all these kind of sections
of<00:02:40.500> hair<00:02:41.120> that<00:02:42.120> come<00:02:42.599> out<00:02:42.900> of<00:02:43.200> each<00:02:43.610> part<00:02:44.610> of

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
of hair that come out of each part of

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.539 
of hair that come out of each part of
the<00:02:44.940> braid<00:02:45.150> so<00:02:46.110> now<00:02:46.260> we're<00:02:46.620> gonna<00:02:46.709> take<00:02:47.040> these

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:47.549 
the braid so now we're gonna take these

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:50.300 
the braid so now we're gonna take these
sections<00:02:48.150> and<00:02:48.530> we're<00:02:49.530> basically<00:02:49.950> going<00:02:50.220> to

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
sections and we're basically going to

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.289 
sections and we're basically going to
braid<00:02:50.549> them<00:02:50.849> over<00:02:51.690> the<00:02:52.170> top<00:02:52.470> of<00:02:52.530> that<00:02:52.769> braid<00:02:53.299> so

00:02:54.289 --> 00:02:54.299 
braid them over the top of that braid so

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:57.050 
braid them over the top of that braid so
starting<00:02:54.930> at<00:02:55.019> the<00:02:55.049> top<00:02:55.519> I'm<00:02:56.519> gonna<00:02:56.610> pick<00:02:56.880> up

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
starting at the top I'm gonna pick up

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:02.240 
starting at the top I'm gonna pick up
two<00:02:57.630> sections<00:02:57.950> from<00:02:58.950> one<00:02:59.130> side<00:02:59.430> and<00:03:01.250> one

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:02.250 
two sections from one side and one

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.080 
two sections from one side and one
section<00:03:02.730> from<00:03:03.030> the<00:03:03.180> back<00:03:03.329> and<00:03:04.489> I'm<00:03:05.489> gonna<00:03:05.610> do<00:03:05.849> a

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
section from the back and I'm gonna do a

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.110 
section from the back and I'm gonna do a
Dutch<00:03:06.329> braid<00:03:06.360> over<00:03:06.930> the<00:03:07.500> top<00:03:07.709> of<00:03:08.040> that<00:03:08.760> bottom

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
Dutch braid over the top of that bottom

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
and by picking up these sections that we

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:55.890 
and by picking up these sections that we
took<00:03:54.099> out<00:03:54.280> from<00:03:54.430> the<00:03:54.610> original<00:03:55.030> braid<00:03:55.239> kind<00:03:55.810> of

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
took out from the original braid kind of

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.440 
took out from the original braid kind of
joins<00:03:56.170> the<00:03:56.470> two<00:03:56.650> braids<00:03:56.950> together<00:03:57.250> which<00:03:58.060> just

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:58.450 
joins the two braids together which just

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:02.790 
joins the two braids together which just
gives<00:03:58.599> a<00:03:58.720> really<00:03:59.020> cool<00:03:59.050> look<00:04:01.380> and<00:04:02.380> then<00:04:02.530> once

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:02.800 
gives a really cool look and then once

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:04.260 
gives a really cool look and then once
you've<00:04:02.950> incorporated<00:04:03.550> all<00:04:03.700> the<00:04:03.730> sections<00:04:04.120> you
