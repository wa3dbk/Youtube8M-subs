the<00:00:36.329> black<00:00:36.510> pods<00:00:36.809> as<00:00:37.020> you<00:00:37.110> can<00:00:37.260> see<00:00:37.640> is<00:00:38.640> the

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
the black pods as you can see is the

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.530 
the black pods as you can see is the
carbon<00:00:39.120> fiber<00:00:39.620> but<00:00:40.620> the<00:00:40.710> dopest<00:00:41.100> to<00:00:41.250> me<00:00:41.489> is<00:00:41.850> the

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
carbon fiber but the dopest to me is the

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.470 
carbon fiber but the dopest to me is the
sole<00:00:43.190> I<00:00:44.190> don't<00:00:44.760> think<00:00:44.910> you'll<00:00:45.090> see<00:00:45.270> it<00:00:45.360> very

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
sole I don't think you'll see it very

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.080 
sole I don't think you'll see it very
clearly<00:00:45.629> but<00:00:46.320> up<00:00:46.469> maybe<00:00:47.309> it's<00:00:47.550> a<00:00:47.700> bit<00:00:47.820> better

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
clearly but up maybe it's a bit better

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.290 
clearly but up maybe it's a bit better
if<00:00:48.270> I<00:00:48.360> put<00:00:48.660> it<00:00:48.780> underneath<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.379> black<00:00:49.710> table

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
if I put it underneath the black table

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.209 
if I put it underneath the black table
it's<00:00:51.300> a<00:00:51.570> clear<00:00:52.079> soul<00:00:52.350> with<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.129> yellow<00:00:53.760> tin<00:00:54.120> and

00:00:55.209 --> 00:00:55.219 
it's a clear soul with a yellow tin and

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:58.010 
it's a clear soul with a yellow tin and
it<00:00:56.219> of<00:00:56.370> course<00:00:56.579> is<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.820> holographic<00:00:57.270> penny

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.969 
about it I guess you all know the the
model<00:01:10.470> so<00:01:11.750> the<00:01:12.750> material<00:01:13.290> you're<00:01:13.650> probably

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
model so the material you're probably

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.070 
model so the material you're probably
familiar<00:01:14.250> with<00:01:14.549> it<00:01:15.770> the<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:17.280> black<00:01:17.840> nubuck<00:01:18.840> on
