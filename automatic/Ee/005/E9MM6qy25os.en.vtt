00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:18.179
 under the influence of the sun, magnet storms and thunderstorms develop 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:25.559
 The little ones are created by electrical charges in the atmosphere 

00:00:25.559 --> 00:00:28.509
 when rising from hot air form 

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:33.969
 Around the globe 1000 storms produce 100 flashes every second 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:38.050
 The sun also controls our weather 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.980
 why air rising at the equator pulls towards the poles 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.289
 in the middle latitudes it meets cold air 

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:47.830
 which flows in the opposite direction 

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:51.640
 At this border line, the fronts and the pressures of the 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.230
 meteorology 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.920
 however, the air currents do not move directly north-south 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.920
 they are distorted by the rotation of the planet 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:05.610
 the earth is and will shift from the option layer 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.070
 a guest that protects us from the harmful ultraviolet radiation of the sun 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:10.360
 protects 

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.580
 over the Antarctic 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.170
 and now also over some areas of the northern hemisphere 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.690
 a hole is formed in the ozone layer 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.200
 This disruption is mainly due to the CFC emissions of the industry 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.480
 attributable 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:23.899
 a warning for us 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:26.899
 how sensitive our relationship to the sun is 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.910
 a shadow strokes the earth 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.750
 this is the shadow of our moon 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.460
 who pass between Biel and the sun 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.460
 a total solar eclipse is imminent 

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.000
 it is day 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.270
 but only a ghostly twilight on the earth succeeded 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.170
 down 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.549
 All over the world, astronomers are in the starting blocks 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:52.549
 and to record this rare event 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.690
 donated the so-called diamond ring 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.690
 Seconds before the moon completely obscures the sun 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.850
 For some precious minutes, the outer glowing atmosphere of the sun is 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:12.669
 clearly visible 

00:02:12.669 --> 00:02:15.640
 It is surrounded by a ring of hydrogen particles 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.989
 they extend millions of miles into space 

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:34.930
 It is very rare that the moon at a solar eclipse 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.840
 Sun so perfectly covered 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.289
 like in this case 

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:42.629
 usually parts or at least the edge of the central star remain visible 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:50.019
 Nowadays, astronomers no longer have to wait for a total eclipse 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:52.669
 and to study the luminaire atmosphere 

00:02:52.669 --> 00:02:56.879
 In the French Alps they produce their own natural event here 

00:02:58.419 --> 00:03:02.639
 below this dome is a chronograph by solar astronomers 

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:05.409
 was invented in the thirties 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:09.760
 They put a light and translucent disk into the telescope and ran like that 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.309
 makes a total darkness 

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:15.609
 now they can do that over the sun's surface at any time 

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:18.609
 watch and record 

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:28.050
 these time-lapse shots 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:29.950
 created according to the same method 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:32.860
 shows guest Bynum in the glow atmosphere 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.489
 the up and down where Ben 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:37.489
 like the waves on the sea beach 

00:03:40.129 --> 00:03:43.619
 The X-ray shows the sun as an energy consultant 

00:03:43.619 --> 00:03:46.340
 the white spots are huge outbreaks 

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.340
 the filament sphere constantly nourish 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:57.329
 The birth of the sun was possibly due to the shockwaves 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:00.299
 triggered by an exploding star 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:03.339
 that happened about five billion years ago 

00:04:03.339 --> 00:04:08.199
 A swirling gas and dust cloud gradually formed 

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:11.199
 more condensed 

00:04:12.299 --> 00:04:16.739
 within this cloud was all matter from the later the 

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.739
 Sun and the planets originated 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.190
 As the cloud thickened, its gravity grew until it became 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:29.190
 finally collapsed 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.409
 the densest matter in the middle of the host country 

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:37.039
 was extremely hot 

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:40.039
 a nuclear reaction set in 

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:43.969
 one out 

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:47.819
 outside the gas ball 

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:50.819
 Matter vortex formed the planets of the solar system 

00:04:55.199 --> 00:04:57.919
 today this man is middle-aged 

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:01.959
 In 5 billion years, it will gradually run out of hydrogen 

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:07.380
 there will be a slow change ride 

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:10.380
 and the sun will grow 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.169
 Mercury and Venus will be destroyed 

00:05:15.169 --> 00:05:18.169
 the seas of the earth will begin to boil 

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:23.850
 The sun is becoming a red giant 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:26.939
 the who-report his remaining fuel sales 

00:05:26.939 --> 00:05:31.699
 life on earth will be wiped out by that time long ago 

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:34.699
 Elsewhere, a new life could begin 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:38.389
 in orbit of the movie action 

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:40.710
 There is a moon called Titan 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:44.970
 He is frozen at the moment but has a diverse chemistry 

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.110
 could bring forth life 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:50.129
 Titanium warmed by the red giant sun 

00:05:50.129 --> 00:05:52.610
 could be brought to life 

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:54.560
 because all your fuel is consumed 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:57.560
 the sun will slowly collapse 

00:05:58.449 --> 00:06:03.120
 she will become a white dwarf a dead star no bigger 

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:05.599
 as the earth 

00:06:05.599 --> 00:06:08.110
 in the final stages of their collapse 

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:10.599
 there will be a grand finale 

00:06:10.599 --> 00:06:14.520
 With the last guest, the sun will hurl a fog into the galaxy 

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:17.029
 a cosmic smoke wrestling 

00:06:17.029 --> 00:06:18.990
 the monument of a star 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:21.509
 that made our life possible
