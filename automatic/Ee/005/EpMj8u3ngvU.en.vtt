00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:06.830
 want discount to enter college 

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:09.650
 access point 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.870
 the side coming to the table in the last class but 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.280
 we talk about the concept of evolution 

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.430
 biological 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:19.640
 today we will start with the thinkers of 

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.530
 evolution of the first one is a mark and 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:25.220
 then the next rice 

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:28.220
 Let's talk about darwin a lot of attention 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:31.730
 why the ideas of lamarck and darwin 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.870
 always falls proof so let's go there for a 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.510
 Personal Brand 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:39.550
 one thing you should never forget 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:43.220
 is that the medium determines a 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:45.680
 but as you might imagine 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:48.890
 with me an environment that suffered some kind 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:52.010
 what will happen with 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.579
 organisms living in this environment is 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.600
 good 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:59.809
 according to lamarck these organisms 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:02.570
 somehow sought to adapt to 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:06.079
 this new environment and this process 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:08.569
 adaptation can generate the use or from the 

00:01:06.079 --> 00:01:11.299
 use of certain organs 

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:14.090
 then from this idea came the 

00:01:11.299 --> 00:01:16.520
 first law of lamarque which is the law of 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.189
 use and since July 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.889
 You know how this works out fine. 

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:25.029
 the law of July use is very easy to 

00:01:21.889 --> 00:01:29.329
 It is understood the more you use 

00:01:25.029 --> 00:01:33.469
 determined more it will develop 

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:36.170
 and the less you use it it will atrophy 

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:39.259
 the classic example for us to understand 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.869
 this is the example of giraffes 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:44.840
 then I will represent that a giraffe 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:45.619
 for us to understand the law of using 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.049
 July 

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:51.319
 well here's our giraffe of 

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:52.130
 According to markit, the more you use 

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:55.399
 a punch 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:58.969
 but it will then develop in this 

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:01.999
 if at last they have used their neck extensively 

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:04.639
 to get the fruits that 

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:07.099
 were in the highest parts of the 

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:12.000
 trees and how much more did they 

00:02:07.099 --> 00:02:14.460
 course and developing the 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.180
 giraffes another example that we 

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:19.410
 we can put here of use and disuse are 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.320
 the snakes 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:25.380
 according to this same idea the 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:28.050
 ancestors of the snakes did not use much 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:31.800
 legs because they were crawling 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:35.490
 then over time the locomotive members 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:38.190
 were atrophying and currently the snakes 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:40.200
 do not have limbs and it is very 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.840
 important to remember that these changes 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.450
 are not instant 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:49.920
 these transformations are happening 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:51.209
 slowly over several generations and 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.450
 what happens 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:57.540
 generation in good generation or the sea 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:01.680
 also said that these characteristics 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:05.370
 which have been acquired are transmitted 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:08.670
 for descent is the second law of the 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:11.510
 lamarck the law of transmission of 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:15.110
 characters acquired 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:18.330
 so if this turn stretches the neck 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:21.150
 this neck feature more 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:23.519
 will be passed on to your 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.590
 descendants for their offspring 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:28.830
 The same way happens here with the snake 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:31.890
 this characteristic of absence of 

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:33.360
 locomotive members will be passed to 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:36.060
 his descendants 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:39.630
 but now I ask you guys think that 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:43.079
 It's okay, for example, think with me. 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:47.340
 if a person in the gym the very fabric 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:50.040
 your muscles will develop more 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:53.579
 this feature will be passed to 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:56.459
 the children of that person not the children 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:04:00.890
 they will not be born muscular 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:04.650
 because there is no transmission of 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:07.310
 characteristics acquired and this 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:09.739
 personal was one of the errors lamarck 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:13.550
 So close this class, I want it to 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:16.370
 you should keep the law of the use of use and the law 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:20.840
 transmission of characteristics 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:25.310
 acquired and also broke the mark 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:27.590
 medium determines a characteristic 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:30.230
 in the next round we'll talk about 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.070
 the darby and you will see that in the case of 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:35.210
 davi 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:37.580
 the middle selects a characteristic but 

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:41.020
 this is the subject of the next class 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.020
 I'll wait you there, see you later
