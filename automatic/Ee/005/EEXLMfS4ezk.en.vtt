00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:19.970
 hello to all and finished my 

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:22.860
 bullying a knife for ages 628 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:25.140
 I started this customization project on 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.539
 your second channel link will be here 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.629
 if you're interested in everything i do 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.790
 subscribe will be glad to new viewers 

00:00:29.629 --> 00:00:33.420
 so the bottom line was that I 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.420
 ordered 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:40.410
 knife and with China and announced what is 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:43.410
 I will not do well initially 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:46.380
 done so and here file work on butt 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.989
 blade it was in the first step and in 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:51.480
 principle failed, he probably did not 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:53.310
 too well, that is, you can see 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.100
 from the jambs but including these here 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:58.470
 notches on each side slightly curved 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:02.070
 and pretty deeply made that is 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:05.329
 much less profound could have them 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:10.170
 make it possible to say the first pancake 

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:13.229
 then the work file was made on so 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.520
 called backlog rocker and that is 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.179
 where we are actually 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:21.389
 backspacer most often we have here 

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:24.409
 turned out a little better in principle 

00:01:21.389 --> 00:01:26.909
 pretty smooth with almost no jambs 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:29.310
 after which the linings were modified 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:32.069
 the handle I tried to do so 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.189
 called the winding well of course here 

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:36.959
 also without jambs absolutely no cost 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:38.759
 that is, in principle, I kind of 

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:41.069
 positioned this work as 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.939
 such a trial and did not expect from her very much 

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:44.549
 a lot of 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:47.369
 here actually drawing came out pretty 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.709
 interesting i mean i tried to do 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.599
 its symmetrical but since i was following 

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:53.880
 here from this side and from this side he 

00:01:51.599 --> 00:01:56.929
 turned out to be symmetrical as you can see 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:00.270
 these ones 

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:02.429
 bands so to speak they are in 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.779
 principle quite smoothly done with each 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:06.029
 the parties but here they agree on the other 

00:02:03.779 --> 00:02:09.000
 the side is not pretty crooked that is here 

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:10.709
 All the same, there was a slight bias here or 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.370
 less in hand feels pretty good 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:16.700
 and from the shoals that, in principle, as if 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.200
 which did not depend on my will 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.540
 the knife is just pretty shit assembled then 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.550
 is there to disassemble and then assemble 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.370
 this is a very big pain in the ass so 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:26.650
 in general 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.959
 I did not begin to calculate the bolts stick out here 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.790
 you can see but just guys really 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:32.470
 believe it, well, what a nightmare 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.510
 There is to collect this knife need kill 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.030
 we don't know about 20 minutes on your time and 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.159
 every time do it with these screws 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.209
 which side michelin slots that is 

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:44.260
 but it's just ass 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:47.799
 so how could i have done that 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.720
 there did not become super-duper and probably still 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:51.700
 I got one mistake 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:56.010
 here as you can see at the top 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:59.200
 the grip a little bit overdone 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.180
 removes the same 10 did not have a little 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.640
 to prop 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:06.879
 the liner itself that is to such here 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:09.430
 a small joint further from the jambs well into 

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:11.109
 overall i'm actually on for good reason 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.420
 blunted here these here that is 

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:17.489
 initially they were very sharp and I 

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:20.290
 just walked over it with the Dremel 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:21.609
 It turned out so to speak, they turned out 

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:23.890
 more gentle but some of them 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:26.440
 got such a small area 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.950
 on top should it have been done in vain 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.269
 that's how these on feast 2 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.730
 however, despite all these 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:35.530
 small pigtails knife in hand looks 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:38.169
 it feels pretty good too 

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:42.180
 great overall became such an outfit 

00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:44.919
 cute yes by the way here I did too 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:47.079
 small so you on a strainer with each 

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:48.310
 side of the liners she basically does not 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:50.190
 felt but looks pretty 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:55.510
 nice 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:57.160
 and of course the final chord 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:59.370
 portak on this knife this is such from 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:02.620
 engraving done quite crooked 

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:06.310
 well actually it's my own fault here 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:08.079
 no one else to blame him 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:11.139
 no less basically looks pretty 

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:14.530
 so nice here and adds this knife 

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:17.620
 such some individuals that 

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:19.750
 can say well firstly a series of lessons from 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.880
 of this whole affair, I of course extracted and 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.880
 Probably the next knife is not that I 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:27.520
 I'll start working you will be much better 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.690
 I have made the transaction conclusions in 

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.120
 generally not in principle studied on 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:33.569
 own mistakes and did not use 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.429
 Mets tanks manuals and so on 

00:04:33.569 --> 00:04:37.309
 advice, too, in principle, almost no one 

00:04:35.429 --> 00:04:40.080
 didn't ask that is well 

00:04:37.309 --> 00:04:41.399
 elementary here is from my tools 

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.959
 there was only this chinese grammy 

00:04:41.399 --> 00:04:45.509
 who again showed his second 

00:04:42.959 --> 00:04:48.509
 the channel as a whole I can say that well 

00:04:45.509 --> 00:04:50.819
 for such work if you're a little more 

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:55.050
 Accuracy than I am more than 

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:58.589
 enough here is a guy I like honestly 

00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:00.779
 guys that is what he was and how he 

00:04:58.589 --> 00:05:03.779
 Well, it's absolutely two different things. 

00:05:00.779 --> 00:05:04.949
 So I think that the first pancake is still in 

00:05:03.779 --> 00:05:07.830
 I did not get a lump 

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:10.559
 important to make any conclusions extract 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:13.319
 of all this , the lesson is the rest 

00:05:10.559 --> 00:05:15.990
 if only I liked so I turned 

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:18.779
 small customization project and 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:20.939
 being bullied for centuries 628 

00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:24.080
 I hope you were interested thank you all 

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:24.080
 for watching good luck
