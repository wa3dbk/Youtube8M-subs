00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.330
 hello everyone with you andrew andrey 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:13.610
 andreevich my site all-all point ru 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:15.710
 1360 8 challenge round the number 82 thousand 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:20.210
 seven hundred nineteen 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:22.949
 whole, 364 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:27.029
 first under the letter we are asked 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:30.000
 round to units if we round to 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:36.750
 units then all fractional part is simple 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:39.390
 drop 827 19 a fractional part 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.280
 just discard while looking out 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.250
 the part that is discarded by 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.559
 the left figure is this triple triple small 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:52.860
 figure so the testicle next rank is not 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:58.410
 pass it was the letter a letter b number 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:01:02.399
 we remain the same but round in 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:06.830
 this time to hundreds means if we 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:10.979
 round up to a hundred fractional part 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:17.610
 here we throw hundreds of masses if we 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:20.189
 rounds to them that and and units and 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.140
 dozens of turning to zero actually 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:24.570
 we do n't seem to discard we watched 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:33.000
 it turns out we have all the numbers up to hundreds 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:34.860
 replace with zeros 8 2700 , 000, that is, we 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.880
 in the fractional part all the numbers are replaced 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:41.250
 zeros and integer parts up to hundreds of masses 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:45.570
 Nine nine was we replace them too 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:48.420
 with zeros, but we have the number after the comma 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:50.399
 we can not write and the comma can also not 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.159
 write therefore they say that the fractional part 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:55.020
 cast out integers 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:58.079
 cannot be dropped we replace with zeros and 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.180
 we leave them therewith if we 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:03.060
 let's see from those that we replaced 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.560
 zeros the leftmost is a digit unit 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:11.849
 so the little one is still 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:24.900
 the discharge does not pass 82 82 thousand seven hundred 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:29.459
 so then the letter is in the tenth of 827 19, 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:34.900
 364 10 you have this number here 10 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:37.269
 therefore, all up to 10 and leave all 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.430
 the rest is discarded well that is 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:43.300
 we replace with zeros in the end it turns out that 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.590
 we throw therefore we replace with zero 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:48.010
 four is replaced by zeros 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:50.019
 zero six six large digit 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:53.880
 Therefore, the following is passed to one. 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:53.880
 discharge and here here will be four 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:01.480
 827 19, 4 threes replacing fours 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.290
 because the six is ​​the big figure a64 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.630
 replace with zeros 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.630
 but they can be written therefore simply 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:18.359
 discard it was the letter in 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:23.049
 now the letter r to hundredths 827 19, 364 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:27.609
 up to one hundredth under us 10 that's 100 that is 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:30.579
 all up to the hundredth and leave everything else 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:32.320
 replace 0 minutes okapov after comma in 

00:03:30.579 --> 00:03:34.150
 The principle is simple, you can even reject 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.700
 just throw the four you just 

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.329
 we can throw the four digit small 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.820
 so 

00:03:37.329 --> 00:03:41.820
 unit the next digit does not pass 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:50.410
 827 19, 36 four is replaced by zero and 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:58.000
 it is possible and not to write there after a comma 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:04:01.329
 just discard the letter d to 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:08.489
 thousand be careful not to the thousandth 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:11.950
 and up to thousand 827 19, 364 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:16.750
 all that here you have thousands all something 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:18.840
 Thousands are left and everything else is replaced 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:21.970
 zeros 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.620
 463 replace them with zeros even after the comma 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:26.199
 we can just drop them 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.900
 absolutely here the line is not necessary we just 

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:29.650
 cast aside but in the whole part and 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.250
 nine 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:35.560
 and one seven is replaced by zeros at 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:37.690
 this is the leftmost number of those who 

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:40.810
 Replace with zero this seven seven 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:47.979
 a large number therefore the unit is passed in 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:50.710
 the next rank is 83000 83000 while those 

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:53.350
 the numbers that absolute go to a comma we 

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:56.280
 reserve is simply replaced by zeros and then 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:05:01.900
 that after the comma we can not even write 

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:05.190
 Here we have an example of this 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:05.190
 all all bye
