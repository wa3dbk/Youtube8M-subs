00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:11.700

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:13.440

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.430
 French to Fernandez and the Argentine side 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.529

 trial yes no I'm me I have a 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.250
 thing I just learned something 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.710
 luiz but after a trick is that the 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.360
 respect is to scream at a guy at 1 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.950
 cm but making him some cool stuff 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.950
 I know that's the principle of respect 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:43.110
 this is their species so here I am 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.879
 happy some way it's there in 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.170
 his me I condemn especially gilbert 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.969
 bribois from the wharf of a big what is 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.500
 permissive with the two guys guys who 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.910
 have been suing on as 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.620
 that arbiter you made yourself walk on the 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.850
 mouth you do not do that kind 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.710
 were bothering them I condemn you 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.969
 by the way, no, but the problem is 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.199
 that I agree with him on 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.399
 the but who knows this market about 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.140
 tracks and this by anyhow well 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:02.789
 all this will end up in a parking lot and 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.719
 it will be and we will not be surprised 

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.220
 that the coach put me the pressure 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.820
 with in a parking lot after it's at 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.950
 level right from the works there was 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.750
 Teaching work and sequences 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.430
 but butt in waiting is very 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.600
 although it is the hyaric all 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.009
 paths lead to investing at the time one 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.509

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.590

 is an element is an element he 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.380
 had to be accompanied that it was necessary 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.420
 follow all this and after the moment he 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.759
 was going to auteuil or play races all 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.460

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.979
 talked about game 2 to May 20 either that he 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.719
 has been but very strong since marseille has 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.700
 scored a goal but he did that 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.100
 thomas florian thomas he did I 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.210
 finds oil efforts has been enough 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.840
 decisive of the mark and made it a 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.820
 decisive pass 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.560
 there was only one goal but he 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.450
 scored he made a decisive pass in 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.890
 two games with one goal 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:12.540
 it is done 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.940
 and he himself did not make the 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:19.490
 parry it is causing not only 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:23.580
 per year and no one can see it 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:26.970

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.570

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.160
 to see who it was yes so I 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:45.540
 obliged to remove 80% good because I have 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.260
 that a country like abandoned the guy he 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:47.040

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.680
 spelling and conjugation 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:52.110
 of 80% of the rally's efforts the guy he has 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.910
 of humor so gets off 11% plus the 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.100
 guy who's looking back on what he's doing there 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.140
 has a critical meaning salve 5% you have it in 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.790
 plus he played high level all added 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.640
 to all his perfect to the people can not 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.470
 thanks to the books even a book but 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.390

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:07.769
 book in fact nobody but good 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:09.660
 drama alex actually it's not possible 

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:10.500
 I do not think I think I 

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.050
 think that by cons I know 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.910
 the coach hide the stadium in basket 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:17.700
 us and mecelec the psg because we get there 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.170
 do not deceive who the risk pressure is 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.370
 and stood by making a 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.780
 team do not know who it is we know 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.299
 that she will have white who in front of them 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.280
 pass like an idiot it's me who has 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:27.690
 besides should talk about tweaking 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.120
 a supporter of the true cork standard 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.160
 to make a banner completely 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.570
 with ready red or dead dead because 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.190
 the guys are saying and that was to say that 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.690
 be it and red either is dead and there 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.880
 hold a head of one of the players who 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:40.170
 went away that's called 9.9 oven and he 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.730
 had his head in one hand it was 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.959
 like the banner a guy from the dark time 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.040
 had the other's head in one hand 

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:44.610
 as if he had cut out game that's when 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.190
 even very average 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:48.540
 and so it was either red or 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:51.090
 mood to the aria a player of the standard 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:52.600
