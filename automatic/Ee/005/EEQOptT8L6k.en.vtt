builders but this unit was built in the
early<00:00:47.040> 80s<00:00:47.460> I<00:00:47.760> believe<00:00:48.449> on<00:00:48.600> the<00:00:48.629> last<00:00:48.960> year

00:00:49.189 --> 00:00:49.199

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:51.890 
early 80s I believe on the last year
that<00:00:49.530> they<00:00:49.800> were<00:00:49.860> able<00:00:50.040> to<00:00:50.220> use<00:00:50.489> it<00:00:50.690> so<00:00:51.690> this

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:51.900 
that they were able to use it so this

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.509 
that they were able to use it so this

smallest<00:01:37.080> not<00:01:37.230> like<00:01:37.380> a<00:01:37.410> whole<00:01:37.650> lot<00:01:37.920> I<00:01:38.420> could

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
smallest not like a whole lot I could

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.940 
smallest not like a whole lot I could
breathe<00:01:39.750> in<00:01:39.900> here<00:01:40.050> without<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.410> mask<00:01:40.590> I<00:01:40.800> have

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
breathe in here without the mask I have

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.100 
breathe in here without the mask I have
the<00:01:41.040> mask<00:01:41.250> on<00:01:41.460> earlier<00:01:41.790> but<00:01:42.180> it's<00:01:42.690> really<00:01:42.870> not

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
the mask on earlier but it's really not

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.560 
the mask on earlier but it's really not
a<00:01:43.140> whole<00:01:43.320> lot<00:01:43.500> of<00:01:43.620> mold<00:01:43.800> here<00:01:44.010> but<00:01:44.670> certainly<00:01:45.120> I

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
a whole lot of mold here but certainly I

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.070 
a whole lot of mold here but certainly I
would<00:01:45.750> say<00:01:46.820> probably<00:01:47.820> half<00:01:48.210> way<00:01:48.630> up<00:01:48.810> both

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080 
would say probably half way up both

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.250 
would say probably half way up both
walls<00:01:49.410> are<00:01:49.620> going<00:01:49.740> to<00:01:49.830> have<00:01:49.950> to<00:01:50.070> be<00:01:50.220> replaced

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:51.260 
walls are going to have to be replaced

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.350 
walls are going to have to be replaced
and<00:01:52.260> you<00:01:52.620> can<00:01:52.800> see<00:01:53.040> that<00:01:53.700> we<00:01:53.790> have<00:01:53.940> previous

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
and you can see that we have previous

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.410 
and you can see that we have previous
water<00:01:54.600> damage<00:01:55.050> in<00:01:55.170> here<00:01:55.350> on<00:01:55.470> these<00:01:55.590> floors

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
water damage in here on these floors

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.200 
water damage in here on these floors
okay<00:01:57.420> and<00:01:57.870> but<00:01:58.800> now<00:01:58.950> you<00:01:59.010> can<00:01:59.280> see<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.550> mold<00:01:59.760> is

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
okay and but now you can see the mold is

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.720 
okay and but now you can see the mold is
growing<00:02:00.690> that<00:02:01.500> wasn't<00:02:01.830> even<00:02:01.980> here

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:02.730 
growing that wasn't even here

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:11.960 
growing that wasn't even here
to<00:02:02.910> go<00:02:07.790> so<00:02:08.790> there<00:02:09.330> it<00:02:09.480> is<00:02:09.600> salt<00:02:10.790> probably<00:02:11.790> all

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
to go so there it is salt probably all

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.850 
to go so there it is salt probably all
this<00:02:12.180> tubing<00:02:13.050> is<00:02:13.170> gonna<00:02:13.320> have<00:02:13.470> to<00:02:13.530> be<00:02:13.650> pulled

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
this tubing is gonna have to be pulled

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.650 
this tubing is gonna have to be pulled
out<00:02:14.040> of<00:02:14.070> here<00:02:14.250> and<00:02:14.370> replace<00:02:14.580> to<00:02:14.790> a<00:02:14.850> PVC<00:02:15.180> what<00:02:15.510> I

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
out of here and replace to a PVC what I

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:18.020 
out of here and replace to a PVC what I
don't<00:02:15.870> understand<00:02:16.470> is<00:02:16.740> why<00:02:16.980> builders<00:02:17.730> in

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
don't understand is why builders in

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.660 
don't understand is why builders in
their<00:02:18.720> right<00:02:18.930> minds<00:02:19.380> ever<00:02:19.620> use<00:02:20.040> this<00:02:20.250> garbage

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
their right minds ever use this garbage

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.640 
their right minds ever use this garbage
to<00:02:20.850> begin<00:02:21.150> with<00:02:21.300> it's<00:02:21.480> just<00:02:21.660> stupidity

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
to begin with it's just stupidity

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.880 
to begin with it's just stupidity
how<00:02:23.220> much<00:02:23.400> cheaper<00:02:23.850> is<00:02:24.000> this<00:02:24.210> stuff<00:02:24.510> than<00:02:25.350> PVC

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
how much cheaper is this stuff than PVC

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:30.280 
how much cheaper is this stuff than PVC
I<00:02:26.040> mean<00:02:26.190> really<00:02:26.400> folks<00:02:26.990> just<00:02:27.990> to<00:02:28.080> save<00:02:28.290> a<00:02:28.320> buck

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
I mean really folks just to save a buck

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.900 
I mean really folks just to save a buck
okay<00:02:31.290> so<00:02:31.350> we<00:02:31.560> opened<00:02:31.830> up<00:02:31.890> the<00:02:32.010> wall<00:02:32.190> a<00:02:32.220> little

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
okay so we opened up the wall a little

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.790 
okay so we opened up the wall a little
bit<00:02:33.030> more<00:02:33.270> here<00:02:33.510> to<00:02:33.540> see<00:02:33.780> exactly<00:02:34.200> where<00:02:34.650> it's

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
bit more here to see exactly where it's

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.820 
bit more here to see exactly where it's
coming<00:02:34.860> and<00:02:35.370> if<00:02:35.490> you<00:02:35.610> look<00:02:35.880> really<00:02:36.210> closely

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:40.050 
right there see it see how it's it's

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:41.630 
right there see it see how it's it's
like<00:02:40.290> gushing<00:02:40.560> up<00:02:40.800> against<00:02:41.070> the<00:02:41.190> back<00:02:41.370> drive

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
like gushing up against the back drive

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.580 
like gushing up against the back drive
while<00:02:41.910> there<00:02:42.120> we're<00:02:42.840> cutting<00:02:43.110> a<00:02:43.170> hole<00:02:43.350> on<00:02:43.530> the

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:43.590 
while there we're cutting a hole on the

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:44.840 
while there we're cutting a hole on the
other<00:02:43.800> side<00:02:43.980> right<00:02:44.160> now<00:02:44.370> we're<00:02:44.550> gonna<00:02:44.640> walk

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
other side right now we're gonna walk

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.310 
other side right now we're gonna walk
around<00:02:45.150> and<00:02:45.270> take<00:02:45.390> a<00:02:45.420> look<00:02:45.660> at<00:02:45.810> it<00:02:45.930> to<00:02:46.110> see

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
around and take a look at it to see

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.950 
around and take a look at it to see
what's<00:02:46.680> causing<00:02:47.010> that<00:02:47.450> but<00:02:48.450> you<00:02:48.570> can<00:02:48.720> see

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:48.960 
what's causing that but you can see

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.560 
what's causing that but you can see
there's<00:02:49.500> some<00:02:50.040> mold<00:02:50.850> spores<00:02:51.240> that<00:02:51.360> are

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
there's some mold spores that are

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:52.940 
there's some mold spores that are
starting<00:02:51.930> to<00:02:51.960> grow<00:02:52.110> back<00:02:52.200> in<00:02:52.560> the<00:02:52.650> corner

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
starting to grow back in the corner

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.870 
starting to grow back in the corner
there<00:02:53.100> on<00:02:53.370> the<00:02:53.490> stud<00:02:53.810> next<00:02:54.810> to<00:02:54.870> this<00:02:55.020> pipe<00:02:55.880> this

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
there on the stud next to this pipe this

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:59.300 
there on the stud next to this pipe this
is<00:02:57.030> just<00:02:57.240> garbage<00:02:57.450> pipe<00:02:57.980> nobody<00:02:58.980> should<00:02:59.160> ever

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
is just garbage pipe nobody should ever

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:09.230 
is just garbage pipe nobody should ever
use<00:02:59.490> it<00:02:59.850> ever<00:03:06.980> okay<00:03:07.980> so<00:03:08.040> here<00:03:08.370> you<00:03:08.400> can<00:03:08.700> see<00:03:08.940> how

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:09.240 
use it ever okay so here you can see how

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.900 
use it ever okay so here you can see how
it's<00:03:09.420> just<00:03:09.660> spilling<00:03:10.020> right<00:03:10.500> there<00:03:10.910> we'll

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
it's just spilling right there we'll

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.670 
it's just spilling right there we'll
remove<00:03:12.150> the<00:03:12.330> drywall<00:03:12.690> on<00:03:12.990> the<00:03:13.050> back<00:03:13.260> side<00:03:13.500> and

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 
remove the drywall on the back side and

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:15.170 
remove the drywall on the back side and
it's<00:03:13.830> just<00:03:14.010> spraying<00:03:14.310> into<00:03:14.640> the<00:03:14.730> kitchen<00:03:15.060> now

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
it's just spraying into the kitchen now

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.699 
it's just spraying into the kitchen now
so<00:03:15.750> essentially<00:03:16.170> this<00:03:16.290> is<00:03:16.350> what<00:03:16.590> was

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
so essentially this is what was

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.290 
so essentially this is what was
happening<00:03:17.100> it<00:03:17.160> was<00:03:17.220> spraying<00:03:17.610> inside<00:03:18.090> the

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
happening it was spraying inside the

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:24.740 
happening it was spraying inside the
wall<00:03:18.510> the<00:03:18.870> whole<00:03:19.020> time<00:03:23.330> okay<00:03:24.330> so<00:03:24.390> here<00:03:24.630> we

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
wall the whole time okay so here we

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.479 
wall the whole time okay so here we
exposed<00:03:25.200> the<00:03:25.410> wall<00:03:25.560> just<00:03:25.830> a<00:03:25.920> little<00:03:26.160> more<00:03:26.340> to

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:26.489 
exposed the wall just a little more to

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.160 
exposed the wall just a little more to
see<00:03:26.700> all<00:03:26.880> of<00:03:26.910> the<00:03:27.150> piping<00:03:27.510> that's<00:03:27.600> in<00:03:27.810> there<00:03:27.989> we

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
see all of the piping that's in there we

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.350 
see all of the piping that's in there we
cut<00:03:28.680> the<00:03:28.800> water<00:03:29.010> off<00:03:29.100> now<00:03:29.430> so<00:03:29.670> the<00:03:29.850> leaking<00:03:30.209> has

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
cut the water off now so the leaking has

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.120 
cut the water off now so the leaking has
stopped<00:03:30.660> it's<00:03:30.840> not<00:03:31.020> spraying<00:03:31.380> anymore<00:03:31.860> on<00:03:32.010> in

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
stopped it's not spraying anymore on in

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:36.690 
news is is all of this piping is

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.750 
news is is all of this piping is
contained<00:03:37.080> in<00:03:37.260> this<00:03:37.440> wall<00:03:37.739> so<00:03:38.010> the<00:03:38.220> kitchen<00:03:38.670> is

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760

bathroom is right here to the left of it

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:49.130 
bathroom is right here to the left of it
so<00:03:47.640> all<00:03:47.940> they<00:03:48.090> have<00:03:48.239> to<00:03:48.330> do<00:03:48.450> is<00:03:48.600> whip<00:03:48.810> out<00:03:48.959> this

so all they have to do is whip out this

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:52.340 
so all they have to do is whip out this
one<00:03:49.380> wall<00:03:50.060> replace<00:03:51.060> the<00:03:51.209> piping<00:03:51.660> in<00:03:51.750> there<00:03:51.989> and

one wall replace the piping in there and

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:54.710 
one wall replace the piping in there and
put<00:03:52.560> the<00:03:52.650> drywall<00:03:52.830> back<00:03:53.250> and<00:03:53.670> they<00:03:54.450> may<00:03:54.600> have
