multi/sub-object<00:00:20.189> material<00:00:21.260> to<00:00:22.260> Norfolk<00:00:24.410> let

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
multi/sub-object material to Norfolk let

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.870 
multi/sub-object material to Norfolk let
me<00:00:25.590> show<00:00:25.859> you<00:00:25.920> how<00:00:27.769> so<00:00:28.769> as<00:00:29.070> you<00:00:29.310> go<00:00:29.670> I'm

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
me show you how so as you go I'm

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.470 
me show you how so as you go I'm
creating<00:00:30.539> this<00:00:30.869> plane<00:00:31.380> which<00:00:32.279> I<00:00:32.669> don't<00:00:33.149> know

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
creating this plane which I don't know

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:42.410 
creating this plane which I don't know
maybe<00:00:33.750> just<00:00:35.899> create<00:00:36.899> this<00:00:37.170> box<00:00:40.520> as<00:00:41.520> you<00:00:41.790> yes

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
maybe just create this box as you yes

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.860 
maybe just create this box as you yes
you<00:00:42.629> guys<00:00:42.840> have<00:00:43.410> known<00:00:43.770> that<00:00:44.190> box<00:00:44.670> has<00:00:45.090> got<00:00:45.300> six

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
you guys have known that box has got six

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:47.529 
you guys have known that box has got six
sides

00:00:47.529 --> 00:00:47.539 
sides

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:52.430 
sides
so<00:00:48.539> let's<00:00:48.899> tie<00:00:49.850> this<00:00:50.850> six<00:00:51.239> sides<00:00:51.629> with<00:00:51.930> six

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
so let's tie this six sides with six

00:00:52.440 --> 00:01:00.170 
so let's tie this six sides with six
different<00:00:52.680> colors<00:00:54.500> firstly<00:00:55.579> oh<00:00:58.579> my<00:00:59.579> chest<00:00:59.879> go

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
different colors firstly oh my chest go

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.889 
different colors firstly oh my chest go
straight<00:01:00.570> to<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:00.930> material<00:01:01.890> here<00:01:02.250> I'm<00:01:03.239> just

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
straight to the material here I'm just

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.289 
straight to the material here I'm just
using<00:01:04.199> a<00:01:04.500> standard<00:01:04.559> scanner<00:01:05.309> material<00:01:06.150> which

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
using a standard scanner material which

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.190 
using a standard scanner material which
is<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.659> same<00:01:06.930> pretty<00:01:07.229> much<00:01:07.409> as<00:01:07.920> you<00:01:08.310> apply<00:01:09.200> via

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
is the same pretty much as you apply via

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.730 
is the same pretty much as you apply via
net<00:01:10.560> zero<00:01:12.560> so<00:01:14.299> let's<00:01:15.470> use<00:01:16.470> the

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
net zero so let's use the

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.200 
net zero so let's use the
multi/sub-object<00:01:18.979> as<00:01:19.979> you<00:01:20.189> can<00:01:20.430> see<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:21.000> disc

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
multi/sub-object as you can see the disc

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.109 
multi/sub-object as you can see the disc
artist<00:01:21.840> all<00:01:22.080> night<00:01:22.320> zero<00:01:22.590> is<00:01:22.799> actually

00:01:23.109 --> 00:01:23.119 
artist all night zero is actually

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:26.480 
artist all night zero is actually
discarding<00:01:24.119> what<00:01:24.360> already<00:01:25.259> what<00:01:26.100> is<00:01:26.310> the

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
discarding what already what is the

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.640 
discarding what already what is the
material<00:01:26.670> available<00:01:27.450> on<00:01:27.689> the<00:01:27.840> materials<00:01:28.409> lot

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
material available on the materials lot

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.830 
material available on the materials lot
if<00:01:29.490> you<00:01:29.670> want<00:01:29.820> to<00:01:29.880> keep<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.240> material

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
if you want to keep the material

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.749 
if you want to keep the material
estimator<00:01:31.500> we<00:01:32.280> just<00:01:32.909> keep<00:01:33.420> on<00:01:33.750> what<00:01:34.350> is

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:34.759 
estimator we just keep on what is

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:38.090 
estimator we just keep on what is
available<00:01:35.759> on<00:01:36.420> this<00:01:36.540> material<00:01:37.020> so<00:01:37.229> for

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
available on this material so for

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.440 
available on this material so for
example<00:01:38.490> if<00:01:38.549> you<00:01:38.640> have<00:01:38.729> already<00:01:39.060> got<00:01:39.420> a

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
example if you have already got a

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.160 
example if you have already got a
material<00:01:39.960> set<00:01:40.259> on<00:01:40.650> this<00:01:41.070> material<00:01:41.820> slot<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:43.140> a

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
material set on this material slot to a

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.340 
material set on this material slot to a
certain<00:01:43.970> type<00:01:44.970> of<00:01:45.000> material<00:01:45.869> then<00:01:46.049> you<00:01:46.079> can

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
certain type of material then you can

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.370 
certain type of material then you can
keep<00:01:46.619> it<00:01:46.939> or<00:01:47.939> if<00:01:48.180> not<00:01:48.390> you<00:01:48.540> don't<00:01:48.750> want<00:01:48.960> you<00:01:49.140> can

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
keep it or if not you don't want you can

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.609 
keep it or if not you don't want you can
just<00:01:49.530> discard<00:01:49.979> it<00:01:50.899> as<00:01:51.899> you<00:01:52.020> can<00:01:52.170> see<00:01:52.380> if<00:01:52.500> you

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
just discard it as you can see if you

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.539 
just discard it as you can see if you
discard<00:01:53.070> it<00:01:53.280> it<00:01:53.460> will<00:01:53.659> be<00:01:54.659> empty<00:01:55.229> here<00:01:55.470> so<00:01:55.979> let

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
discard it it will be empty here so let

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.410 
discard it it will be empty here so let
me<00:01:56.759> show<00:01:57.060> you<00:01:57.119> another<00:01:57.329> one<00:01:57.890> if<00:01:58.890> I<00:01:59.399> choose<00:02:00.180> to

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
me show you another one if I choose to

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.789 
me show you another one if I choose to
keep<00:02:00.659> the<00:02:00.899> material<00:02:01.560> or<00:02:01.680> self<00:02:01.920> at<00:02:02.100> zero<00:02:03.799> and

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
keep the material or self at zero and

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.399 
keep the material or self at zero and
see<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.700> metal<00:02:06.090> goes<00:02:06.329> straight<00:02:06.960> into<00:02:07.229> the

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
see the metal goes straight into the

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.370 
see the metal goes straight into the
first<00:02:08.000> material<00:02:09.000> slot

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
first material slot

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:17.100 
first material slot
so<00:02:12.970> all<00:02:13.970> right<00:02:14.180> so<00:02:15.050> just<00:02:15.319> delete<00:02:15.680> this<00:02:15.950> one

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
so all right so just delete this one

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
so all right so just delete this one
back<00:02:18.110> to<00:02:18.319> normal

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
back to normal

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:24.809 
back to normal
just<00:02:19.850> use<00:02:20.120> the<00:02:20.390> second<00:02:20.810> one<00:02:21.850> so<00:02:22.850> I<00:02:23.330> need<00:02:24.050> six

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:24.819 
just use the second one so I need six

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:30.670 
just use the second one so I need six
first<00:02:25.819> one<00:02:26.650> site<00:02:27.650> number<00:02:27.920> one<00:02:28.570> just<00:02:29.570> use<00:02:29.990> color

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:17.660 
number one this will be shown is wood

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:21.050 
number one this will be shown is wood
for<00:05:18.660> example<00:05:18.830> stone<00:05:19.830> material<00:05:20.580> it<00:05:20.670> will<00:05:20.850> be

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.060 
for example stone material it will be
