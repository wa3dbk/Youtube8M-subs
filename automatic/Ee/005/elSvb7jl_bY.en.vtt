00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:09.420
 Thank Hello Kobayashi 

00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:11.970
 We will continue to your talk about the control method of the brain that result in achieving the target automatically, today 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:16.190
 It sounds through your story now 

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:23.840
 It is the way of success using brain function 

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:26.039
 How to control your brain function to achieve the shortest possible success using brain functions 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:33.510
 I will talk 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:35.240
 Wind that a large result by continuing this story it is really powerful actually enters the hand 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.300
 It is a thing 

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:42.090
 Really listen carefully to today's story until the end 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:48.740
 In fact it is that I am to continue in the day-to-day level 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:52.010
 Here are some of the benefits that will come to you: 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:57.590
 The merit is that it is one eye first 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:58.370
 It entered the hand that had wanted to you now and I came without much awareness 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.910
 Are 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:08.479
 If you become aware of this situation 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:13.960
 It now because it really actually I get angry really but I like a lie 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:16.000
 I think if you can listen carefully to the story you want to 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:19.270
 And one more point 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.840
 Want it's your negative eyes will generate dilute the natural 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:28.219
 And it means that the plasma surface is stretched naturally 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:33.049
 There are also some, so I would like to go straight ahead 

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:36.049
 It is a talent or talent that you can not understand even if you think with your head 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:41.360
 After that he looks old days Ikoma 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:43.860
 Went forgot a little way in such Well Toka sound relationship between the family Toka school is education 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:48.120
 Really like that he is alive this 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:51.600
 That feeling or something like that has come to life 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:53.940
 = That's right, because it leads to the energy for your station 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:58.800
 And it will also be the ability up 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:02:02.670
 There is also that Rutte also drawn to be able to continue action is many times than motivation previous 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.480
 Hey do so synchronization unlike the me I is motivated to say motivation 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.440
 It is a reason 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:11.310
 Your actions by the fact that the reason to do becomes clear 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:13.930
 Of course I will be able to continue, I don't feel motivated once in a while, or something for today 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:17.650
 Also languid Do Toka say of course I'd think it is that there 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:21.819
 However, people can act by having a motivational motive 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:24.939
 That's why it's the reason it's going to be clear 

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:28.870
 Well for that purpose the purpose is clear a 

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:33.700
 Even though I have a still various It is that doubt is eliminated 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:37.780
 Even though I think that let's roughly kidnapping and see you entered the main part in this kind of feeling 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:41.860
 It's will be asked to some work well It is, however 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:45.670
 Have you write something like the example and get ready for a while 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:50.290
 By the way, please do it because no money will be charged 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:54.420
 Yes you really do because nothing really changes unless you actually do it 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.420
 We will complete the story now believe
