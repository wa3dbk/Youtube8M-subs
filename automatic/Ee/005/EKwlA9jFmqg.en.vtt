I really want to be able to just

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:37.970 
I really want to be able to just
concentrate<00:02:36.450> on<00:02:36.750> the<00:02:37.470> fact<00:02:37.650> that<00:02:37.710> I'm<00:02:37.860> getting

concentrate on the fact that I'm getting
married<00:02:38.280> and<00:02:38.550> it's<00:02:38.700> a<00:02:38.820> really<00:02:38.970> happy<00:02:39.330> day<00:02:39.770> lots

of<00:02:40.920> smiling<00:02:41.220> I<00:02:41.660> don't<00:02:42.660> think<00:02:42.900> he<00:02:43.080> will

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.610 

I<00:02:48.400> don't<00:02:49.030> think<00:02:49.090> it's<00:02:49.540> what<00:02:49.750> she's<00:02:49.930> expecting

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
I don't think it's what she's expecting

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:58.410 
I don't think it's what she's expecting
and<00:02:52.069> where<00:02:52.250> it<00:02:52.340> is<00:02:52.459> getting<00:02:52.670> it<00:02:52.790> all<00:02:52.880> wrong

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.089 

I<00:02:58.480> thought<00:02:59.020> it'd<00:02:59.170> be<00:02:59.349> a<00:02:59.380> lot<00:02:59.530> easier<00:02:59.680> than<00:02:59.920> this

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:00.099 
I thought it'd be a lot easier than this

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:02.790 
I thought it'd be a lot easier than this
I<00:03:00.720> don't<00:03:01.720> want<00:03:01.840> to<00:03:01.900> think<00:03:01.990> about<00:03:02.140> address<00:03:02.620> for

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.330 
I don't want to think about address for
cases<00:03:03.190> her

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
cases her

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:09.730 
cases her
she<00:03:04.970> reacts<00:03:05.209> like<00:03:05.830> these<00:03:06.830> to<00:03:07.069> reacting<00:03:07.580> now
