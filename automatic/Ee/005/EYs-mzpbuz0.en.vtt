00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.540
 hello although this recipe seems to be a lie 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.580
 I still had not prepared it and the other 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.440
 day I found that I still had some 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.809
 beans in the freezer packaged 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.699
 empty, there are only two months left for 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.039
 be season again so it does not have 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:21.779
 it makes a lot of sense to keep them more you know 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.699
 that both abbas and peas 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.580
 It is always better to cook them without 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.380
 thaw the previously well already 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.539
 warned in the title this is going to be a 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.399
 pump recipe is to say that I'm not going to 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.469
 cut with fats you can make a 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.690
 much smoother version simply with 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.059
 olive oil and replacing the bacon 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.040
 for Serrano ham, for example, let's go 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.020
 to it in a saucepan we put a trickle of 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.510
 extra virgin olive oil and a nut 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.989
 of lard after we chop a 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.989
 onion 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:00.900
 and we add it together with the young garlic 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:00.900
 also chopped 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.730
 we pepper 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:20.360
 and we let it sautÃ© while we go to 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:22.220
 cut into cubes the bacon entreverado is 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.630
 say that if you have some meat 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.630
 between the fat so much better 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:56.660
 and we incorporate it when the onion already 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.660
 it is well tender 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:07.110
 when the bacon has been browned 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:09.179
 we incorporated the beans and a couple of leaves 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.800
 of laurel and the best thing is to separate 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.690
 previously but he has already left them 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:16.220
 hooked so you can see it 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.220
 they incorporate frozen 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.870
 we cover it and we will leave it to fire 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.239
 slow half hour past that time 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:26.590
 let's add black sausage for thais 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:26.590
 some rather fat pieces 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:34.280
 the incorporated and let 5 minutes 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.280
 plus 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.940
 and it's ready, I hope you have 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.940
 liked a hug until then
