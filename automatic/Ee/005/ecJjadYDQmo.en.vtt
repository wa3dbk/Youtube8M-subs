00:01:42.559 --> 00:01:42.569 
let it sort of sink in and think how

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:44.089

we're<00:01:42.720> going<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:42.869> approach<00:01:42.990> this<00:01:43.470> before<00:01:43.920> they

00:01:44.089 --> 00:01:44.099 
we're going to approach this before they

00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:46.609 
we're going to approach this before they
actually<00:01:44.539> physically<00:01:45.539> come<00:01:46.140> up<00:01:46.289> with<00:01:46.440> some

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
actually physically come up with some

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.650 
actually physically come up with some
ideas<00:01:46.740> on<00:01:47.039> paper<00:01:47.369> that<00:01:47.670> we<00:01:47.759> could<00:01:47.940> present<00:01:48.270> I

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:48.660 
ideas on paper that we could present I

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.139 
ideas on paper that we could present I
think<00:01:49.289> the<00:01:49.349> speed<00:01:49.649> of<00:01:49.830> business<00:01:50.009> isn't<00:01:50.580> has

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
think the speed of business isn't has

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.809 
think the speed of business isn't has
increased<00:01:52.020> so<00:01:52.380> much<00:01:52.550> certainly<00:01:53.550> over<00:01:53.759> the

00:01:53.809 --> 00:01:53.819 
increased so much certainly over the

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:57.199 
increased so much certainly over the
last<00:01:54.030> decade<00:01:54.509> that<00:01:55.580> being<00:01:56.580> able<00:01:56.819> to<00:01:57.000> be

00:01:57.199 --> 00:01:57.209 
last decade that being able to be

00:01:57.209 --> 00:01:59.300 
last decade that being able to be
totally<00:01:57.569> in<00:01:57.929> touch<00:01:58.200> at<00:01:58.410> all<00:01:58.530> times<00:01:58.920> when

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
totally in touch at all times when

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.620 
totally in touch at all times when
you're<00:01:59.459> actually<00:01:59.610> not<00:01:59.880> physically<00:02:00.390> in<00:02:00.599> the

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
you're actually not physically in the

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.770
