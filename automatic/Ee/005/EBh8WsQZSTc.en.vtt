groundbreaking<00:00:33.570> is<00:00:33.690> it<00:00:33.809> once<00:00:34.020> used<00:00:34.230> to<00:00:34.320> be

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
groundbreaking is it once used to be

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
because iOS 7 has incorporated a lot of

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
to the table to begin with but it still

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.560 
to the table to begin with but it still
does<00:00:40.230> have<00:00:40.440> some<00:00:40.950> cool<00:00:41.160> effects<00:00:41.520> and<00:00:41.760> some

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570

when<00:01:01.829> you<00:01:01.920> open<00:01:02.280> a<00:01:02.370> folder<00:01:02.579> but<00:01:02.820> now<00:01:02.940> you<00:01:03.000> can

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
when you open a folder but now you can

when you open a folder but now you can
turn<00:01:03.390> that<00:01:03.570> off<00:01:03.629> so<00:01:04.320> I<00:01:04.350> have<00:01:04.619> disabled<00:01:05.369> the

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400

turn that off so I have disabled the
zooming<00:01:05.850> animation<00:01:06.659> but<00:01:06.930> I've<00:01:07.049> kept<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:07.710> open

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
zooming animation but I've kept the open

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.590 
zooming animation but I've kept the open
closed<00:01:08.280> animation<00:01:08.850> there<00:01:09.030> and<00:01:09.180> that<00:01:09.270> example

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
closed animation there and that example

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.480 
closed animation there and that example
and<00:01:09.780> that<00:01:09.869> looks<00:01:10.049> good<00:01:10.260> now<00:01:10.530> let's<00:01:11.040> talk<00:01:11.189> about

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
and that looks good now let's talk about

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.149 
and that looks good now let's talk about
close<00:01:11.790> all<00:01:12.090> folders<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:13.020> can<00:01:13.170> actually<00:01:13.380> close

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
close all folders you can actually close

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.240 
close all folders you can actually close
all<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.790> folders<00:01:15.180> when<00:01:15.990> you<00:01:16.500> have<00:01:16.740> an<00:01:17.070> app

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
all the folders when you have an app

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.850 
all the folders when you have an app
launch<00:01:17.580> and<00:01:18.540> this<00:01:18.689> only<00:01:18.900> really<00:01:19.290> works<00:01:19.590> with

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
launch and this only really works with

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.620 
launch and this only really works with
folders<00:01:20.250> within<00:01:20.460> folders<00:01:20.610> so<00:01:21.150> let's<00:01:21.330> go<00:01:21.509> ahead

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
folders within folders so let's go ahead

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.880 
folders within folders so let's go ahead
and<00:01:22.020> create<00:01:22.860> a<00:01:23.100> folder<00:01:23.640> within<00:01:23.790> a<00:01:23.939> folder<00:01:24.030> now

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
and create a folder within a folder now

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.080 
and create a folder within a folder now
all<00:01:25.890> right<00:01:26.100> so<00:01:26.250> we<00:01:26.340> have<00:01:26.460> a<00:01:26.490> folder<00:01:26.820> within<00:01:26.970> a

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
all right so we have a folder within a

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.840 
all right so we have a folder within a
folder<00:01:27.180> now<00:01:27.869> if<00:01:28.080> I<00:01:28.170> hit<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.409> home<00:01:28.560> button

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
folder now if I hit the home button

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.340 
folder now if I hit the home button
notice<00:01:29.850> what<00:01:30.090> happens<00:01:30.420> it<00:01:30.570> goes<00:01:30.720> back<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.200> the

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350 
notice what happens it goes back to the

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.460 
notice what happens it goes back to the
initial<00:01:31.799> folder<00:01:32.369> that<00:01:32.579> it<00:01:32.700> was<00:01:32.820> nested<00:01:33.299> inside

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
initial folder that it was nested inside

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.950 
initial folder that it was nested inside
but<00:01:34.470> if<00:01:34.650> I<00:01:34.799> turn<00:01:34.860> on<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.700> owner<00:01:36.060> home<00:01:36.600> button
