 prime minister not the most 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:28.650
 the worst among you and maybe the rays

 but due to the fact that he was to you by 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.190

 there is no tragedy for man 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:03.989
 but tragedy is for Dagestan because 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:07.520
 that we do not work effectively here 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:10.250

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:42.210
 There is an example of effective work active 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:44.340
 work and indifferent work why ep 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.860

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:52.610
 effectively though I don’t understand why 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.610
 overthrow someone is not pleased 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:04.580
 so I ask you to do yours 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.900
 duties and acting 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:11.520
 prime minister appointed 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:15.710
 karimov and kariby manage assignment 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:18.200

 half year and on the implementation of presidential 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.730
 decrees 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:29.100
 simultaneously the same decrees mean 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:32.730
 formed by the presidency 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:35.550
 Republic of Dagestan on the examination and 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:38.670
 project management is management 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:41.100
 which will be held weekly 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:46.350
 monitoring the implementation of presidential 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:49.050
 decrees and will help glam to areas 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:53.130
 cities adapt this project to their 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:55.560
 no activity experts help every 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:58.020
 support for city ​​heads 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:01.230
 who really want to come from 

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:03.000
 a project that you don’t find 

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:06.030
 the project that you are directly 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.620
 will deal with the city ​​of Makhachkala already 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:13.560
 the group starts developing 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:16.380
 development programs of the city itself because 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:20.000
 that the new world is interested exactly by 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.000
 the city developed effectively 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:33.739
 this is you 1 is not very good news 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:38.130
 for me it is most unpleasant 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:42.019
 because of this, I thought enough 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:46.200
 for a long time I consulted with other people 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:50.880
 but many suggested 

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:51.810
 until September I have patience 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:55.769
 September 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:57.650
 and Dagestan can tolerate a single day 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:00.150
 we must not lose 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.970
 we very fundamentally started 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:07.020
 deal with the tax system is compatible 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:08.870
 zileri can not lose a single day 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:12.900

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:17.940
 so please with understanding to all 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:21.710
 this concern and this is another application 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:24.330
 to be determined 

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:28.410
 complete tasks and goals 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:34.850
 which we proclaimed another exit 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:41.420
