00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.000
 the game gta san andreas so here is either 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.070

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.900
 finally the cracker either you buy it and 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.349
 where to install it once you have it 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.570

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:33.690
 headlights steps the first step 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.000
 download san andreas multiple and 

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.140
 I read in the description if 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.079
 you never come across which one you 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:44.040
 click download and you download 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.489
 smb 0.3 x clients or download it and 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:45.870
 install 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.760
 so I put you a link in the 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.739
 description then you do the same 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.539
 you download us install look 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.860
 average hamachi I have the 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.060
 registrations you install it or to 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.420
 Download 

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:59.100
 then you will launch langmann 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:02.780
 hamachi you will create an account 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:09.870
 you make network join a network 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:14.130
 so here you put servers is holding 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:16.140
 space I was shooting at the wind here 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.060
 then everything is one two three and that's it 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.860
 so I liked you the idea of ​​the network 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.150
 you just have in the description so 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.890
 you just have to copy paste 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.750
 if ever this one the conflicts you 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.640
 add 1 2 if he ever follows a couple 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:31.140
 is made at 3 4 and 5 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:33.630
 So here there and then once 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.360
 you joined the network you go 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.820
 in the description and I put some zips 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.890
 and finally I put two ip of servins 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.410
 so you have the first ipc the 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.780
 roleplay server and you at the second 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.770
 team and that's the test match server in 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.470
 resident evil mode 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:53.009
 so you put that aspect aside 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:56.310
 and then you start you can you 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:58.610
 launch servers facing andreas 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.170
 multiplayer so you 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.430
 just a little precision you 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.300
 install it in the folder you have 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.880
 put the cheeks on the football 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:07.470
 So here click on the small arrow 

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.790
 who is here and you 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:10.740
 you put both zips and you 

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:12.480
 have you next are going to have these two 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:17.190
 waiters here it is once you in 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.510
 add the two ip so here is a 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.740
 once you have added two swords if 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.730
 never this word but happy and delighted them 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.570
 false normal because I would not have 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:27.960
 launch the servers so here is the info 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:30.650
 vaulted skype format you my skype name 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:33.650
 this is the one I'm going to increase 

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:33.650
 here 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:40.110
 so here you add me skype is so 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:42.750
 in fact a conversation if you want 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:44.310
 come and serve again makes a 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:46.110
 conversation like that by sky and then we 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.390
 can do deathmatch or together 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.709
 all this so that's fine 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.299
 add to me what they did to 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:52.019
 conversation and all the other members 

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:54.330
 so for now we are not 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:58.260
 a lot we are three years all infiniti 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:02.819
 sky and me so here is now I 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:05.370
 will go on the on the server and I 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:07.530
 will you see how finally I 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.120
 will let you see how the 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.709
 server so it's going to go first 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:16.950
 on test match and after we will go on the 

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:18.269
 like them so that's yes since it's 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:22.220
 I'm going here 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:24.460
 so we fly on deathmatch 

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:27.010
 So we connect 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:30.280
 yeah the deathmatch deathmatch of 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.970
 zombies so the bass zombie and a mode 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.490
 resident Evil 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:36.460
 so you make your camp either 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:38.440
 it's the survivor either if the zombies 

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:40.300
 is actually the goal is to infect the 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.890
 city ​​are you going to see what are you going to 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.870
 a red square on your map 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.220
 I will show you the goal 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:47.140
 it's to stay in that red square and 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:49.570
 to wait to celebrate recently infected 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:51.640
 the city so lambert we can play 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:53.830
 as many people as you can 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.870
 misses you join the server so 

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:58.390
 so here's the see you know the 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:02.350
 defense has its deathmatch modes you have 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:04.750
 the defense where you have the zombies 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:07.540
 so here for example to learn the 

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:09.580
 Zambia So here you are not on the 

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:12.040
 server like that so I do not know of 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:15.010
 everything if it can sabeg a little bit because 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:16.180
 it was I recorded my words we see 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:19.840
 so you see pretty much start 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:22.210
 you see on the hand pissier card 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.570
 see here you have to go here that's it and 

00:04:22.210 --> 00:04:27.220
 in fact I'll go there if you have 

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:28.960
 infected that point so here you stay 

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:32.160
 you will then understand peace 

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:35.110
 now we will go to the rp server 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:37.240
 so that's not going to be complicated 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.569
 So here we go, we must not add 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:40.669
 both things 

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:45.379
 rp server as you want said and there 

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:48.189
 there's a friend here so bah he's fine 

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:51.070
 he may say hello to you 

00:04:48.189 --> 00:04:52.690
 so here we go 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:54.330
 sorry if you see the cursor ah but 

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:56.770
 yes we know it's my software 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:58.630
 so here is to think they do not know 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:00.730
 I will discover a new software the 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:02.620
 base look like studio but there I 

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:06.760
 fell on bandits cap so that's it 

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:07.860
 I do not know you so we're going to 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:11.210
 log on 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:13.509
 we will take anything 

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:13.509
 here 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:20.200
 excuse me here that's it we were 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:20.200
 safe 

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:29.350
 so here you see that this is the 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:29.350
 waiter waited 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:33.699
 and who falls who did not understand in 

00:05:32.139 --> 00:05:37.500

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:40.330
 here we are 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:44.470

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:46.210
 So here it is, it's one of its members 

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:48.460
