00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:25.200 
as well but lately I've been seeing some
whole<00:05:22.660> cats<00:05:22.930> and<00:05:23.340> for<00:05:24.340> the<00:05:24.520> symbol<00:05:24.910> of<00:05:25.060> hope

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:25.210 
whole cats and for the symbol of hope

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:27.090 
whole cats and for the symbol of hope
they've<00:05:25.480> been<00:05:25.600> using<00:05:25.630> his<00:05:26.020> head<00:05:26.200> just<00:05:27.010> like

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:27.100 
they've been using his head just like

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:29.670 
they've been using his head just like
the<00:05:27.310> Iron<00:05:27.490> Man<00:05:27.700> 1<00:05:27.910> i'm<00:05:28.840> not<00:05:29.110> really<00:05:29.230> sure<00:05:29.350> what

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:29.680 
the Iron Man 1 i'm not really sure what

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.409 
the Iron Man 1 i'm not really sure what
Iron<00:05:29.860> Man<00:05:30.100> symbolism<00:05:30.669> it's<00:05:30.940> probably<00:05:31.300> his

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:31.419 
Iron Man symbolism it's probably his

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:33.780 
Iron Man symbolism it's probably his
head<00:05:31.600> but<00:05:31.780> I<00:05:32.020> always<00:05:32.620> thought<00:05:32.770> that<00:05:32.830> the<00:05:33.610> Hulk

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:33.790 
head but I always thought that the Hulk

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:36.960 
head but I always thought that the Hulk
symbol<00:05:34.240> was<00:05:34.570> a<00:05:34.600> radiation<00:05:35.200> sign<00:05:35.440> so<00:05:36.400> if<00:05:36.820> you

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:36.970 
symbol was a radiation sign so if you

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:40.230 
symbol was a radiation sign so if you
guys<00:05:37.060> are<00:05:37.240> listening<00:05:37.570> at<00:05:37.840> New<00:05:37.960> York<00:05:38.140> cabs<00:05:39.240> make
