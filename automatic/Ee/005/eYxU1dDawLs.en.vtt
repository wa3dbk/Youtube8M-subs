Hi! This video is gonna show you how to make vegan mozzarella

00:00:03.636 --> 00:00:14.151
This kind is delicious served fresh in a salad 
 and also melted in a hot dish.

00:00:14.151 --> 00:00:28.592
Some mozzarella recipes out there are made with starches 
 and are good but only for melting

00:00:28.592 --> 00:00:37.364
They are delicious, but their texture is nothing like a fresh mozzarella.

00:00:38.074 --> 00:00:42.002
But our recipe is good for eating it either fresh or melted!

00:00:42.002 --> 00:00:45.930
So, let's start putting the ingredients in the pot.

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.879
The process is very simple: put the ingredients in the pot, heat and blend.

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.974
INGREDIENTS: 6 tbsp cooking cream

00:00:53.974 --> 00:01:02.789
(You can watch our recipe for homemade cooking 
 cream in the link above :) )

00:01:09.406 --> 00:01:16.788
1 and 1/2 tbsp of margarine

00:01:31.027 --> 00:01:37.693
3/4 (or 1) tsp powdered agar agar 
(depending on the texture you want)

00:01:38.794 --> 00:01:56.720
You can replace the agar for a tbsp of starch, but 
 it will not have the texture of fresh mozzarella.

00:01:56.718 --> 00:02:15.470
And if you are using agar in flakes or strains, adjust the dose :)

00:02:15.418 --> 00:02:23.910
If using powdered agar, watch out not to use more than 
 a tsp or the result may be too rigid/hard.

00:02:23.906 --> 00:02:28.080
And we want it to be solid but creamy.

00:02:29.248 --> 00:02:36.240
So, here we have 3/4 of a tsp. I'm 
 gonna add a tiny bit more, almost 1tsp.

00:02:48.576 --> 00:02:59.580
Now, it is ready to heat. And then 
 we will add the lemon and yogurt.

00:02:59.583 --> 00:03:12.210
(We make homemade yogurt and I will explain how to 
 do it by the end of this video)

00:03:13.253 --> 00:03:24.590
Now stir well so the agar disolves. 

00:03:25.271 --> 00:03:39.800
And now, let's heat it on medium heat till the margarine melts.

00:03:41.338 --> 00:03:44.910
We need to stir constantly, it burns very easily.

00:03:44.914 --> 00:03:48.860
At least with the kind of pot I'm using.

00:04:05.718 --> 00:04:09.070
Now the indredients are all melted. 

00:04:13.095 --> 00:04:20.210
Let's add some lemon juice, just to add tanginess.

00:04:25.695 --> 00:04:28.120
A pinch of salt.

00:04:29.013 --> 00:04:38.450
And now it's time to add the the 4 tbsp of yogurt.

00:04:40.794 --> 00:04:43.400
Mix well :)

00:04:44.143 --> 00:04:48.020
In the meanwhile, I'll tell you about the homemade yogurt!

00:04:48.016 --> 00:04:55.950
I use this yogurt maker which is simply a 
 glass jar that fits into a polyestyrene case.

00:04:54.257 --> 00:04:58.510
In the plyestyrene, it explains the process, 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:07.750
You can do it without the polyestyrene too, covering it with 
 blankets or stuff like that. But I reccomend this.

00:05:07.966 --> 00:05:23.260
You need 1L of soy milk, a thermometer, the yogurt 
 maker, and a store bought yogurt (or starter kit)

00:05:31.892 --> 00:05:46.010
You need to heat the soy milk in the glass 
 jar between 42/45ºC (check with the thermometer), 

00:05:45.097 --> 00:05:54.930
(In the back of my yogurt maker there is the temperatures and the process)

00:05:55.292 --> 00:06:05.620
and add 4 tbsp of store bought yogurt (or equivalent of your starter kit)

00:06:05.625 --> 00:06:15.370
Now just let it sit inside the polyestyrene case from 6 to 
 9 hours. The more time, the more fermented and tangy.

00:06:15.369 --> 00:06:23.840
That's it! Plus you can add flavors, sweeteners, etc. Cheap and easy, right?

00:06:23.844 --> 00:06:34.240
I think it is interesting to make it home, for the price of 1L 
 of soymilk, you have 1L of yogurt. That's not more than $2!

00:06:34.241 --> 00:06:39.390
It is very cheap and easy! :) And much more natural and healthy.

00:06:39.701 --> 00:06:42.380
The mozzarella mix is ready.

00:06:42.861 --> 00:06:48.060
Let's pour it into a bowl or mold.

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:55.800
Now we need to let it cool... And the result is this:

00:06:55.798 --> 00:07:03.040
I hope you liked the recipe and the explanation about the yogurt making process.

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:11.360
