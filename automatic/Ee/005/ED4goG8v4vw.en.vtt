sacred<00:01:00.449> cows<00:01:00.690> in<00:01:00.899> the<00:01:00.960> studio<00:01:01.230> we<00:01:01.379> know<00:01:01.500> that

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
sacred cows in the studio we know that

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.410 
sacred cows in the studio we know that
this<00:01:01.770> is<00:01:01.920> on<00:01:02.010> the<00:01:02.100> next<00:01:02.340> gen<00:01:02.520> we're<00:01:03.090> going<00:01:03.300> for

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
this is on the next gen we're going for

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.149 
this is on the next gen we're going for
an<00:01:03.539> international<00:01:04.049> audience<00:01:04.170> this<00:01:04.860> can't<00:01:05.100> be

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
an international audience this can't be

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.649 
an international audience this can't be
made<00:01:05.369> just<00:01:05.640> for<00:01:05.790> a<00:01:05.850> Japanese<00:01:06.030> audience<00:01:06.540> that's

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
made just for a Japanese audience that's

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.200 
made just for a Japanese audience that's
used<00:01:06.900> to<00:01:07.049> top<00:01:07.409> down<00:01:07.680> bird's-eye<00:01:08.400> view<00:01:08.670> camera

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
used to top down bird's-eye view camera

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.580 
used to top down bird's-eye view camera
angles<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:09.600> things<00:01:09.720> like<00:01:09.840> that<00:01:09.900> so<00:01:10.260> we've<00:01:10.439> got

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
angles and things like that so we've got

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:11.719 
angles and things like that so we've got
were<00:01:10.710> introduced<00:01:11.010> in<00:01:11.130> two<00:01:11.220> different<00:01:11.400> control

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
were introduced in two different control

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.190 
were introduced in two different control
schemes<00:01:11.760> to<00:01:12.060> so<00:01:12.420> one<00:01:12.600> that's<00:01:12.780> more<00:01:12.900> set<00:01:13.170> for

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
schemes to so one that's more set for

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.440 
schemes to so one that's more set for
Japanese<00:01:13.680> like<00:01:14.490> mindset<00:01:14.850> and<00:01:14.939> then<00:01:15.060> more<00:01:15.299> for

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
Japanese like mindset and then more for

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.910 
Japanese like mindset and then more for
Western<00:01:15.720> gamers<00:01:16.020> so<00:01:16.200> I<00:01:16.409> think<00:01:16.770> we're<00:01:16.860> hitting

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
Western gamers so I think we're hitting

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.859 
Western gamers so I think we're hitting
all<00:01:17.100> the<00:01:17.159> bases<00:01:17.460> right<00:01:17.580> now<00:01:17.729> well<00:01:18.689> it<00:01:18.780> all

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
all the bases right now well it all

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:20.539 
all the bases right now well it all
comes<00:01:18.900> down<00:01:19.170> to<00:01:19.320> what<00:01:20.159> we<00:01:20.250> call<00:01:20.369> in<00:01:20.460> an

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
comes down to what we call in an

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:22.310 
comes down to what we call in an
engagement<00:01:21.090> style<00:01:21.479> button<00:01:21.810> it's<00:01:22.110> on<00:01:22.229> the

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
engagement style button it's on the

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
square button you can toggle it on and

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.820 
square button you can toggle it on and
off<00:01:23.820> it's<00:01:24.060> an<00:01:24.180> auto<00:01:24.390> aim<00:01:24.630> so<00:01:25.590> a<00:01:25.619> lot<00:01:25.799> of

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
off it's an auto aim so a lot of

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.109 
off it's an auto aim so a lot of
Japanese<00:01:26.220> players<00:01:26.400> they<00:01:26.549> have<00:01:26.670> a<00:01:26.700> hard<00:01:26.939> time

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
Japanese players they have a hard time

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.609 
Japanese players they have a hard time
using<00:01:27.360> both<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.689> analog<00:01:28.049> sticks<00:01:28.380> and

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
using both the analog sticks and

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.170 
using both the analog sticks and
shooting<00:01:29.130> at<00:01:29.220> the<00:01:29.310> same<00:01:29.490> time<00:01:29.700> so<00:01:29.939> we<00:01:30.090> have

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
shooting at the same time so we have

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.670 
shooting at the same time so we have
this<00:01:30.270> auto<00:01:30.509> aim<00:01:30.750> that's<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:31.049> look<00:01:31.170> kind<00:01:31.650> of

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
this auto aim that's a look kind of

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.020 
this auto aim that's a look kind of
makes<00:01:31.799> it<00:01:31.920> more<00:01:32.040> simplified<00:01:32.460> they<00:01:32.670> can<00:01:32.790> shoot

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
makes it more simplified they can shoot

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.450 
makes it more simplified they can shoot
in<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.780> general<00:01:34.110> direction<00:01:34.140> of<00:01:34.590> a<00:01:34.740> soldier

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
take them out pretty quickly but you

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:38.660 
take them out pretty quickly but you
know<00:01:37.829> when<00:01:37.950> I<00:01:38.009> first<00:01:38.040> started<00:01:38.280> playing<00:01:38.490> the
