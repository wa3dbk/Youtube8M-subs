00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.460

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.900

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:59.240
 [Music] 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:01:02.300
 everything started in 1998 as every day 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:05.090
 the farmer dyn alexander's sheep 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.580
 they were enjoying the pastures of their 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:10.700
 farm on the north island when 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:13.700
 suddenly the sky began to fly over 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.790
 a helicopter with the filmmaker peter 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.400
 jackson 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:21.550
 at that time jackson was touring 

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.590
 every span of new zealand looking for 

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:25.900
 locations for the trilogy of 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.180
 Lord of the Rings' 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.550
 that's when I observe from the 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:33.070
 air that Mr. Alexander's farm 

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:36.940
 It was the perfect place to situate 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:39.700
 hobbiton there was a lot a small field 

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:42.330
 lake and mostly it was quite hidden 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:46.870
 so the secrets of the shoot 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:49.320
 could be safe from leaks 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.320

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:13.490
