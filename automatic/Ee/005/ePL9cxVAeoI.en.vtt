00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.900
 to prepare a seafood pizza that is 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.380
 delicious and it is also very easy to make 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.969
 the ingredients for our pizza are 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:17.540

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:35.910
 we have in previous videos or I'll leave it 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.070
 in the information box and for which 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.070
 I do not know how to do it and with all this said 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.690
 we started 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.970
 The first thing we are going to do is click 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.800
 our entire pizza base and the 

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.470
 we will put with the preheated oven to 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.840
 180 degrees up and down 

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:53.030
 approximately 10 minutes 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.620
 while this is done let's go 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.140
 putting in a pan a little bit of 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.590
 olive oil and let's make our 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:05.300
 prawns 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:05.300
 we will put salt garlic powder and parsley 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.330
 and we are going to fry them until they are 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.330
 rositas or golden 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:19.410
 you can add other spices if you 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.410
 like 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:26.450
 we have them ready and we reserve 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:28.549
 we are cutting the surimi sticks in 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.690
 bits like this roughly this thickness 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:33.910
 we will do it with everything 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:36.930
 and we already have the kiln outlet base 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:41.160
 we 're going to put it all over the tomato base 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.160
 to cover in its entirety 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:47.400
 once covered with tomato we will put 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:47.400
 oregano to taste 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:57.770
 and once we have put all the oregano 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.750
 desired we are going to add also a 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.110
 little bit of ground black pepper 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:06.360
 too 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:06.360
 we will put the cheese to gratinate 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:15.209
 in its entirety of the pizza 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.209
 we will put the surimi wands 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.330
 and finally we will also place the 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.330
 prawns 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:33.110
 we're going to put it in the oven at 180 degrees 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:36.110
 for another 5 or 7 minutes 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:38.060
 just for the gratine cheese 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.920
 and I 'm going to add another bit of cheese 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.100
 more you can do exactly 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.100
 same 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.250
 what we said put it in the oven between 5 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.770
 and 7 minutes and that's how our 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.480
 Pizza is delicious and besides you can see 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:55.849
