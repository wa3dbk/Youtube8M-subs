 sixty-two by 39 by 43 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.729
 considering the part of the lamp 52 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.140
 cents is then it is a capacity 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:38.900
 of 100 liters 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.900
 or the voltage at 110 volts 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:44.520
 At this point you can see a 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:47.790
 modification is a cooler has been installed a 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.680

 mobile module manufactured in mdf with two 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.640
 two shelves doors were removed

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:49.270
 now at the very end here this year you 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:51.070
 does everything by which is the limitation of 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:53.650
 superior but the guy is there 

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:55.660

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:58.660
