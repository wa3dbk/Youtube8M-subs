00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.320
 hello how about friends welcome in this 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.300
 next chapter of the cadastre course 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.040
 Well, today in this chapter we are going to 

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.420
 be seeing what the 10 groups are or 

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.950
 list groups 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.930
 these groups of lists allow us 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:23.849
 order different items and good 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.119
 enclose them let's say a small table 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:29.100
 to give them a better style these groups 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.350
 of the state to notice us serve to show 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:33.930
 content in a more orderly and 

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:35.550
 can order them let's say in a way 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.559
 that could work for the user 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.780
 better to be able to provide you 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.000
 navigation for example then let's 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.480
 see them here I have my document already the 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.920
 book here I have my html document I have 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.050
 all resources added as 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.270
 always and I have our structure the 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.700
 next sink contain flow I have a 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.530
 line break a row and then a 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.360
 column of 4 this is the only thing that 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.910
 I need so well then we are going to 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.200
 start with the most basic lists for 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.059
 what we are going to do is that as 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.949
 any list we will create a smell 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.180
 but this smells you're going to put our 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.010
 list group 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.110
 and inside we are going to put our 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.730
 elements in law that we want in this 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.330
 case is how it does is that good with the 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:17.190
 emt plugin I'm cutting everything I 'm going 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.720
 to add in different ly and can in 

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.450
 this case add about five elements 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.750
 of law everyone is going to have their class list 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.910
 group 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.270
 I was going to have the following text in this 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:30.270
 case it is set by a lord 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:33.240
 5 while there is then there is 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.280
 this is what we want we have 5 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.250
 elements of law and each of them 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.679
 you have your group list it is important that 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:44.159
 you add this this class that in fact 

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:46.350
 here I missed sleep group and aider skiles 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.600
 group haiti and in this way we 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.429
 let's create a very basic list if 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.500
 we check in the browser how you can 

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:54.420
 see here we have a list and this is what 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.520
 that allows us to make lists of 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.319
 groups allow us to order information 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.140
 this way you can do it 

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:03.149
 also for example with elements with 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.069
 links and well you can do it 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.509
 for other things what they are used for 

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:08.369
 also lists good because you 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.619
 information posts and let's say 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.510
 classify this I can because I 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.010
 you can do with colors then to 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.370
 do it with colors we can do what 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.540
 next let's go to our 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.549
 document and what is enough is that this 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.600
 I'm going to copy it and I'm going to paste it 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:24.550
 to have the roe 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.560
 and in the one below we're going to do what 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.720
 next we are going to add to each one 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.790
 of them a class 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.370
 let's make a class called list 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:36.340
 group 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:37.960
 script item and the name of the color that 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.450
 we want as well as the other chapters 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:43.390
 we have different colors in this case 

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:45.550
 we have the success and we only have 4 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:50.680
 forgiveness success we have the deck info 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:52.629
 we have the warning and the danger 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.950
 as here I no longer have good color 

00:02:52.629 --> 00:02:56.829
 I will erase this element of law 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.599
 Well, I have to leave no color to make it 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:03:00.790
 better then good so I can 

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:03.069
 erase the whole class and there 's me 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.379
 would look like this then 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:07.420
 since we update as you can see already 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:09.159
 we have colors in each of our 

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:11.349
 elements and this is good because 

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:13.719
 help you to better classify our 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:16.420
 lists as you want in addition to this 

00:03:13.719 --> 00:03:18.159
 we can add what they are 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.109
 the valleys and remember what were the 

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:22.269
 badges in past chapters 

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:24.849
 Well, we can add them to these 

00:03:22.269 --> 00:03:26.049
 groups of lists to add it by 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:28.120
 example the only thing that needs to be done is 

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:32.410
 add a spam and here I'm going to give it to 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:34.750
 last with a class called batch 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:36.160
 bach and inside the text that you want in 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:38.380
 this case is simply going to put a 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.090
 simple number and there it is if we keep 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.130
 we are going to get what 

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:44.320
 next this little logo that 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:46.120
 We have here and you can add it in 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.540
 each and every one of them and all 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:48.280
 colors 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:51.280
 so if for example this spam I'm going 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:54.940
 copy and stick it at the end of each 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:58.240
 of the previous ones the one that we had to 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:00.190
 it struck him as you can update 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:01.930
 see we already have our badges in 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.840
 each one of them and this good so you 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.640
 we can add what else we have good 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.770
 Well, we can do that and we can 

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.960
 work with links that this is one of 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:12.970
 the parts that I like the most 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:14.680
 groups because if you work with links 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:17.260
 or let's say you can make menus 

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.850
 pretty cool vertical navigation 

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.680
 not very complex but good that they look 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:22.990
 well this for example for a blog 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.550
 then let's do them what there is that 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:27.090
 do is it good I'm going to again 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:30.190
 copy this roo we had at the beginning 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:32.980
 I'm going to stick it to the end after this 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.180
 another and we're going to work on them what 

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:38.020
 only thing that needs to be done is the following 

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:40.650
 here we are going to replace the elements l 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.650
 let's erase 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:44.970
 let's erase it's over I'll start to 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.930
 do it from new to not confuse what 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.960
 what we have to do is that we are going to record 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:52.970
 a link to this link is going to have 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.970
 our class ready 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:57.750
 and we are going to add here the text that 

00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:00.750
 we wanted that in this case it was 

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:02.670
 this one that he had here then he hit it and 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:04.620
 there you can grab the badges 

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:07.440
 also if you want me in this case not what 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:09.060
 I'll do that but I do not want 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:11.130
 you can do or even now what 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:13.950
 we later and thus already 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:15.570
 we would have an element in a link 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:17.340
 sorry then I'm going to copy it and 

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:19.830
 then I'm going to paste it several times in 

00:05:17.340 --> 00:05:21.840
 about 5 times and if we keep updating 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:23.670
 let's get the following as you can 

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.320
 see is a list then similar 

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:27.420
 just change the color now it 's a 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:30.600
 little gray but if we pass the mouse 

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:32.970
 as you can see now are links and how 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:36.120
 are links we can add another class 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:38.080
 as was the active class or the class 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.970
 disabled 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:41.169
 then with the active class which is what 

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:42.939
 that we're going to do well, well, we're going to 

00:05:41.169 --> 00:05:44.590
 indicate that an element is active and 

00:05:42.939 --> 00:05:47.050
 with the class says let's say again that 

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:49.139
 an element is uninhabited and this is 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:51.879
 what we can do with our groups 

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:53.800
 of lists is worth the badges now 

00:05:51.879 --> 00:05:56.500
 if you want to do it in the same way 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:06:00.219
 simply copying the spam and sticking it 

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:02.020
 at the end of your element we made and there 

00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:03.819
 it's there we have it finally 

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:05.560
 demonstrate another structure that they have 

00:06:03.819 --> 00:06:07.270
 you can use with list groups 

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:09.280
 which is the one I still like the most 

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:12.219
 So what we are going to do is that 

00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:14.050
 let's copy again our our 

00:06:12.219 --> 00:06:16.960
 row that we have at the beginning the one that comes 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:18.879
 by default what we did for photo and 

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:20.860
 there it is I'm going to hit it to the end 

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:23.379
 but here we are going to change several things 

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:27.219
 because the elements I'm going to erase 

00:06:23.379 --> 00:06:29.169
 I'm going to create one an element 

00:06:27.219 --> 00:06:31.870
 and inside we're going to apologize 

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:34.300
 class first your class ready 

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:38.199
 the item 

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:40.389
 and we are going to put this case and within 

00:06:38.199 --> 00:06:42.610
 content here is going the interesting thing you 

00:06:40.389 --> 00:06:45.699
 let's put a header in this case 

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:47.139
 14 in the you will put header and 

00:06:45.699 --> 00:06:49.270
 then we are going to put a small 

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:51.039
 paragraph this little good paragraph that 

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:53.830
 is going to put suppose you have and is 

00:06:51.039 --> 00:06:56.139
 words there is and this element of the 

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:59.590
 anp we are going to copy it I am going to paste it 

00:06:56.139 --> 00:07:01.710
 another four times and the first one to 

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:03.030
 put your tactile class 

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:05.310
 to this then if we keep 

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:07.860
 we update we have this structure that 

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:09.450
 are great are let's say a structure in 

00:07:07.860 --> 00:07:12.330
 which we have a header inside 

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:14.700
 we have text inside and each of them 

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:16.290
 they are buttons then with this you can 

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:18.060
 do many things and the truth is that it 

00:07:16.290 --> 00:07:19.920
 see very well you with this you can order 

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:21.420
 the articles of a blog and that the 

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:23.820
 user decides any go or the 

00:07:21.420 --> 00:07:25.890
 categories etcetera and in fact this 

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:28.560
 what we are going to be using 

00:07:25.890 --> 00:07:30.800
 in what is our final exercise that 

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:32.569
 It is the place we had made 

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:35.150
 so it comes to me after that has been 

00:07:32.569 --> 00:07:36.650
 all for this chapter about the groups 

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:38.060
 of list you already know that my name is 

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:39.300
 Carlos Arturo and see you in the 

00:07:38.060 --> 00:07:41.220
 following
