I'll be fine so I should put my tomb a
bulk<00:05:44.590> inside<00:05:44.950> of<00:05:45.100> it<00:05:50.850> i'm<00:05:51.850> using<00:05:52.330> you'll<00:05:52.450> be

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:52.540 
bulk inside of it i'm using you'll be

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:54.000 
bulk inside of it i'm using you'll be
needing<00:05:52.840> a<00:05:52.930> wrench<00:05:53.110> to<00:05:53.200> fix<00:05:53.320> this<00:05:53.620> i<00:05:53.830> could

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:54.010 
needing a wrench to fix this i could

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:56.460 
needing a wrench to fix this i could
turn<00:05:54.160> it<00:05:54.280> over<00:05:54.430> when<00:05:54.940> its<00:05:55.060> time<00:05:55.470> you

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:56.470 
turn it over when its time you

00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:00.290 
turn it over when its time you

plugs<00:06:10.930> out<00:06:11.050> plug<00:06:11.470> wires<00:06:11.680> off<00:06:11.890> so<00:06:12.550> i'll<00:06:12.640> start

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:12.760 
plugs out plug wires off so i'll start

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:23.880 
plugs out plug wires off so i'll start
with<00:06:12.940> the<00:06:13.000> plugs<00:06:18.060> it's<00:06:19.060> a<00:06:19.090> good<00:06:19.240> idea<00:06:19.390> to<00:06:22.890> know

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:23.890 
with the plugs it's a good idea to know

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:25.830 
with the plugs it's a good idea to know
where<00:06:24.550> the<00:06:24.790> plug<00:06:25.030> wires<00:06:25.240> go<00:06:25.480> if<00:06:25.660> you<00:06:25.810> don't

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:25.840 
where the plug wires go if you don't

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:29.220 
where the plug wires go if you don't
know<00:06:26.910> make<00:06:27.910> sure<00:06:27.940> you<00:06:28.390> mark<00:06:28.630> them<00:06:28.810> because<00:06:29.110> it

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:29.230 
know make sure you mark them because it

00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:47.730 
know make sure you mark them because it

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:49.490 
while you're doing this you could check

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:53.260 
while you're doing this you could check
your<00:06:49.639> plugs<00:06:49.879> see<00:06:50.629> how<00:06:50.750> they<00:06:50.900> look<00:06:51.639> I<00:06:52.639> happen<00:06:53.240> to

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:53.270 
your plugs see how they look I happen to

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:55.629 
your plugs see how they look I happen to
know<00:06:53.389> that<00:06:53.479> these<00:06:53.719> ones<00:06:54.310> this<00:06:55.310> one's<00:06:55.490> actually

00:06:55.629 --> 00:06:55.639 
know that these ones this one's actually

00:06:55.639 --> 00:06:59.170 
know that these ones this one's actually
running<00:06:57.159> seems<00:06:58.159> to<00:06:58.310> be<00:06:58.430> running<00:06:58.610> rich<00:06:58.969> cuz

00:06:59.170 --> 00:06:59.180 
running seems to be running rich cuz

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:00.520 
running seems to be running rich cuz
it's<00:06:59.300> black<00:06:59.569> it<00:06:59.750> shouldn't<00:07:00.020> be<00:07:00.080> black<00:07:00.289> like

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:00.530 
it's black it shouldn't be black like

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:06.249 
it's black it shouldn't be black like
that<00:07:02.979> I'm<00:07:03.979> going<00:07:04.370> to<00:07:04.520> track<00:07:05.030> what<00:07:05.659> plugs<00:07:06.020> are

00:07:06.249 --> 00:07:06.259 
that I'm going to track what plugs are

00:07:06.259 --> 00:07:15.969 
that I'm going to track what plugs are
where<00:07:11.710> only<00:07:12.710> because<00:07:13.189> I<00:07:13.340> need<00:07:13.729> to<00:07:14.629> know<00:07:14.979> how

00:07:15.969 --> 00:07:15.979 
where only because I need to know how

00:07:15.979 --> 00:07:22.899 
where only because I need to know how
these<00:07:16.039> colors<00:07:16.729> are<00:07:16.909> performing<00:07:21.789> kind<00:07:22.789> of<00:07:22.849> a

00:07:22.899 --> 00:07:22.909 
these colors are performing kind of a

00:07:22.909 --> 00:07:27.869 
these colors are performing kind of a
tight<00:07:24.819> tight<00:07:25.819> reach<00:07:26.090> but<00:07:26.479> they<00:07:27.259> can<00:07:27.439> be<00:07:27.469> gotten

00:07:27.869 --> 00:07:27.879 
tight tight reach but they can be gotten

00:07:27.879 --> 00:07:36.710 
tight tight reach but they can be gotten
and<00:07:29.379> this<00:07:30.379> one<00:07:30.560> is<00:07:30.680> actually<00:07:30.800> running<00:07:31.069> decent

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:36.720 

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:40.340 

maybe<00:07:37.410> a<00:07:37.590> little<00:07:37.650> bit<00:07:37.980> Lane<00:07:38.190> about<00:07:38.850> bad<00:07:39.350> but

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:40.350 
maybe a little bit Lane about bad but

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:42.080 
maybe a little bit Lane about bad but
what<00:07:40.530> the<00:07:41.190> reason<00:07:41.370> I'm<00:07:41.460> pulling<00:07:41.670> these<00:07:41.730> values

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:42.090 
what the reason I'm pulling these values

00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:43.520 
what the reason I'm pulling these values
when<00:07:42.540> I'm<00:07:42.630> going<00:07:42.810> to<00:07:42.870> turn<00:07:42.990> it<00:07:43.110> over<00:07:43.140> I<00:07:43.320> want

00:07:43.520 --> 00:07:43.530 
when I'm going to turn it over I want

00:07:43.530 --> 00:07:46.130 
when I'm going to turn it over I want
any<00:07:43.680> resistance<00:07:44.510> from<00:07:45.510> the<00:07:45.660> compression<00:07:46.050> of

00:07:46.130 --> 00:07:46.140 
any resistance from the compression of

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:48.230 
any resistance from the compression of
the<00:07:46.200> engine<00:07:46.890> so<00:07:47.220> this<00:07:47.760> will<00:07:47.880> just<00:07:48.030> make<00:07:48.120> it

00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:48.240 
the engine so this will just make it

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:50.750 
the engine so this will just make it
really<00:07:48.330> easy<00:07:48.540> to<00:07:48.840> turn<00:07:48.990> over<00:07:49.610> if<00:07:50.610> you're

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:50.760 
really easy to turn over if you're

00:07:50.760 --> 00:07:51.980 
really easy to turn over if you're
worried<00:07:50.940> about<00:07:50.970> something<00:07:51.240> falling<00:07:51.600> in<00:07:51.810> there

00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:51.990 
worried about something falling in there

00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:54.650 
worried about something falling in there
put<00:07:52.260> a<00:07:52.290> rag<00:07:52.500> over<00:07:52.710> it<00:07:52.950> and<00:07:53.210> fact<00:07:54.210> is<00:07:54.330> probably<00:07:54.600> a

00:07:54.650 --> 00:07:54.660 
put a rag over it and fact is probably a

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:56.600 
put a rag over it and fact is probably a
good<00:07:54.690> idea<00:07:54.840> to<00:07:55.080> stuff<00:07:55.380> a<00:07:55.500> rag<00:07:55.530> over<00:07:55.950> the<00:07:56.160> just

00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:56.610 
good idea to stuff a rag over the just

even just a paper towel or something so
