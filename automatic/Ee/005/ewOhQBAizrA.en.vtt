00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:01.190
Hi.

00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:03.160
Can I cross my arms like this?
It doesn`t look goodâlet`s do this again

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:07.060
I`m Ana, I`m an actress,
I`m 31 years oldâ and I`m single

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.090
you know those weird stories you think
could only happen to you? 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.050
They happen to everybodyâ and to me
they happen all the time.

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:17.100

Ana's Stories
Ep. 01 - The Elevator

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.140
it`s always been said that airplanes
were safer than elevators,

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.230
I never believed that.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.140
Hello

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:35.210
but from now on

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.010
It`s been raining a lot

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.260
Yes it has.
Yeah, two days non stop. It`s crazy.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.240
But it`s good isn`t it?
It is good, we needed that.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:45.240
It`s good for the skin.
Yeah!

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.220
I have bronchitis so it also helps
Yes and the skin gets better.

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:53.130
You have such a beautiful skin
Oh thanks.

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.130
Stop! Just stop! 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:59.250
Pay attention to what this lady
decided to talk to me about.

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.130
You`ve never thought about going on a diet?

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.130
Couldn`t she have stopped on the weather? 

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:10.020
Ow, I had never had this idea, by the way my mirror
doesn`t show that nor my clothes that don`t fit me. Thanks!

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.260
My daughter got a formula for a new diet
it`s really working for her.  I could give you.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:19.000
You could also get your daughter, yourself and
this damn formula and shove it up your...

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
I could leave it for you with the doormanâ€¦

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.060
just check out what the doorman handed meâ€¦

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.170
the recipe for the formula,

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.190
and leaves, so I can make tea.

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.020
There`s a building meeting.

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.260
God why is this elevator
taking this long.

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.260
it`s like time expands when
we are in the elevator. 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.210
Bye, have a good day.
Bye

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.230
No, no, no. Just wait a minute.

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:55.130
You almost don`t believe it right?!
Well it`s not a lie. 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:01.080
I meet her twice, twiceâ€¦ on the same day
inside the same elevator.

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.020
Hi!
Hi.

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.170
Is everything ok?
Yes.

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.140
Soâ€¦here we are again.

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.200
Really?! I can`t believe this!

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.180
And your hand is it better?

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.290
Yes it`s better,
I can already move it.

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.000
you had another accident
the other day hadn`t you?

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.180
No, yeah I broke my foot last year.

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.030
You`ve being breaking many things latelyâ€¦ 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.140
I`ve being breaking many things lately

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:27.190
You need to take care of yourself
Yes I needâ€¦

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:29.090
You know what you need? 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:30.240
You need to find yourself a boyfriendâ€¦

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.270
Find a boyfriend, cause it`s so easy nowadays,
I don`t know if you know it, 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.090
but it`s raining men outside,
it`s just that I don`t want itâ€¦

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.020
Get married and give your mother some grandkidsâ€¦
it`s about time isn`t it.

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.130
Cause it`s very easy to find a boyfriend. Find a boyfriend,
get married and give my mother grandkids,

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.080
She doesn`t even know if I want kids,
she doesn`t even know if I`m sterile.

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:49.280
My daughter started dating just the other day
Good...

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.170
Good for her, is she happy?
Yes. Really happy.

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:53.050
Did you hear what she said?

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.220
Who knows maybe my daughter`s boyfriend has a
friend and he can introduce him to youâ€¦

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.100
Right, coolâ€¦ he could.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.080
Bitch, bitch!

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.250
What`s your profession? You are an actress right?
Yes, I`m an actress.

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:05.190
Right, now I get itâ€¦

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.100
Now you get it?!

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.270
Well it`s nice.

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:11.250
And your mother, what does
she think about it?

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.040
My mother loves it.
Really?
Really.

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:22.200
It`s so good when parents put up with you like that,
in all the waysâ€¦

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.060
Yes. She supports me.

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.080
If I wasn`t a centered human being,

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.010
I would have killed that old lady.

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.210
Hello, good morning.
Can you help me with the body?

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:36.050
You know what? I don`t hate her,
I really don`t. You know why? 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:38.180
Because she is actually helping me,

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.020
I never really liked elevators and nowâ€¦ 

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:43.280
I always take the stairs.
