00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.269
 but 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:23.690
 And now we will consider this 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:27.020
 simple accord 

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:27.740
 denoted by e. the topic is we have a chord 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.430
 re 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:33.580
 as we understood binocular beret as follows 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.580
 way 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:41.570
 Abortions Rome 0 is played the same 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:43.700
 contours major only in 4 countries 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.560
 how is it necessary to pro with 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:48.970
 the first finger and pinches the first string 

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:51.470
 on the first fret by the fourth finger 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:54.890
 I emphasize playing the third fret 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:56.430
 the second string is the second finger on the third 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.560
 string 2 live 

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:05.220
 and the fourth string so that we will have 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:09.930
 open temporary why did I focus 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:12.650
 that it is advisable to take in d minor such 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.990
 the way they use the third finger 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:18.630
 very worn 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:21.090
 learned beginners or self-taught on 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.579
 because when we use the fourth 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.920
 finger the third finger we have not his freedom 

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:29.930
 you can use every screen we want 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.930
 add some or spouse 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.810
 Yes 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.380
 that is, if we took a chord like that 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.509
 way we weigh and we will however 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.100
 when we take the following way there are 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:45.170
 cases when necessary, whether because 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.170
 that this case 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:53.070
 Hope this shtrikhok 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.890
 legs still so convenient to take 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:02.180
 neat 0 because it is easy to navigate 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:12.350
 on the strap just added a finger and 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:13.070
 strino second this one main 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.910
 option 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:19.730
 and we have no alternative in the fifth year 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:22.850
 we clamp the reception of a pair of five strings we clamp 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:27.560
 and put the second finger on the sixth and 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:30.709
 the seventh fret 4 finger on the third string and 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.330
 on the fourth string the third finger by the way 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:36.200
 second groove on our second string 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:43.209
 finger 1 pointer we get the fifth 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:45.920
 and presses another third option 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:48.200
 similarly with the previous reference for 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.510
 major simply by clamping as i can 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.420
 Wali three strings first second and third 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:59.180
 in the tenth year 4 of us are open and begin 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:03:01.810
 from 4 p. 3 options chords rome but 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:05.080
 basic option 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.680
 alternative option and the third option 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.980
 Well 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.980
 here
