00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:48.170 
over so I keep that and we look at it

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:50.289 
over so I keep that and we look at it
some<00:01:48.350> at<00:01:48.500> halftime<00:01:48.650> gives<00:01:49.130> us<00:01:49.280> an<00:01:49.370> idea<00:01:49.430> which

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:50.299 
some at halftime gives us an idea which

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:51.399 
some at halftime gives us an idea which
there<00:01:50.510> things<00:01:50.720> are<00:01:50.870> working<00:01:51.200> and<00:01:51.320> which

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:51.409 
there things are working and which

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:53.530 
there things are working and which
aren't<00:01:51.680> and<00:01:52.159> then<00:01:52.310> I<00:01:52.369> guess<00:01:52.580> the<00:01:52.850> the<00:01:53.390> other

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540 
aren't and then I guess the the other

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.390 
aren't and then I guess the the other
thing<00:01:53.750> is<00:01:53.869> just<00:01:54.049> being<00:01:54.260> a<00:01:54.380> coach<00:01:54.590> and<00:01:54.890> I<00:01:54.979> make

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:55.400 
thing is just being a coach and I make

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.250

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:57.260 
suggestions coach Smith and luckily he

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:58.870

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
now and then some of them to do pan out

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.719 
now and then some of them to do pan out
but<00:02:02.080> watching<00:02:03.080> the<00:02:03.170> flow<00:02:03.350> of<00:02:03.380> the<00:02:03.560> game<00:02:03.770> during

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:04.729 
but watching the flow of the game during

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:06.219 
but watching the flow of the game during
practice<00:02:05.210> I<00:02:05.299> work<00:02:05.479> a<00:02:05.600> lot<00:02:05.750> with<00:02:05.780> the<00:02:05.869> big<00:02:06.080> men
