oh<00:00:02.560> yeah<00:00:03.430> I<00:00:03.460> think<00:00:03.730> science<00:00:03.909> is<00:00:04.180> very<00:00:04.390> sexy<00:00:04.600> I

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:05.350 
oh yeah I think science is very sexy I

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.000 
oh yeah I think science is very sexy I
mean<00:00:06.310> there<00:00:06.490> are<00:00:06.790> a<00:00:07.330> lot<00:00:07.990> of<00:00:08.020> big<00:00:08.500> scientific

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:09.010 
mean there are a lot of big scientific

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:11.400 
mean there are a lot of big scientific
puzzles<00:00:09.490> when<00:00:09.700> it<00:00:09.850> comes<00:00:10.389> to<00:00:10.630> sexual

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:11.410 
puzzles when it comes to sexual

know all the pains and heartache to
actually<00:00:30.400> sexually<00:00:30.789> reproduce<00:00:31.119> so<00:00:31.359> it's<00:00:31.810> a

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:31.840 
actually sexually reproduce so it's a

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.080 
actually sexually reproduce so it's a
big<00:00:32.019> puzzle<00:00:32.199> in<00:00:32.410> evolutionary<00:00:32.920> biology<00:00:33.370> and

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:34.090 
big puzzle in evolutionary biology and

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:35.130 
big puzzle in evolutionary biology and
then<00:00:34.239> when<00:00:34.420> you<00:00:34.480> start<00:00:34.540> looking<00:00:34.809> at<00:00:34.989> the

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:35.140 
then when you start looking at the

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.470 
then when you start looking at the
different<00:00:35.590> ways<00:00:35.710> animals<00:00:36.160> go<00:00:36.489> about<00:00:36.700> sexual

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:37.480 
different ways animals go about sexual

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:38.940 
different ways animals go about sexual
reproduction<00:00:37.840> all<00:00:38.170> the<00:00:38.290> different<00:00:38.590> ways<00:00:38.680> they

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:38.950 
reproduction all the different ways they

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:40.979 
reproduction all the different ways they
go<00:00:39.070> about<00:00:39.250> finding<00:00:39.969> mates<00:00:40.300> and<00:00:40.629> you<00:00:40.899> know

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:40.989 
go about finding mates and you know

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:43.170 
go about finding mates and you know
strategizing<00:00:41.680> to<00:00:41.710> get<00:00:41.950> mates<00:00:42.190> and<00:00:42.579> convincing

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.180 
strategizing to get mates and convincing

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:44.780 
strategizing to get mates and convincing
individuals<00:00:43.840> to<00:00:43.960> mate<00:00:44.079> with<00:00:44.200> them<00:00:44.350> and<00:00:44.500> so<00:00:44.559> on

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:44.790 
individuals to mate with them and so on

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:47.490 
individuals to mate with them and so on
you<00:00:45.790> know<00:00:45.820> it's<00:00:46.629> kind<00:00:46.840> of<00:00:46.870> just<00:00:46.989> fascinating

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:47.500 
you know it's kind of just fascinating

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:48.720 
you know it's kind of just fascinating
to<00:00:47.530> see<00:00:47.710> all<00:00:47.829> the<00:00:47.920> strategies<00:00:48.370> that<00:00:48.399> are<00:00:48.640> out

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:48.730 
to see all the strategies that are out

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:50.880 
to see all the strategies that are out
there<00:00:48.760> and<00:00:49.210> in<00:00:49.870> many<00:00:50.020> ways<00:00:50.110> humans<00:00:50.620> are<00:00:50.739> real

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:50.890 
there and in many ways humans are real

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:52.709 
there and in many ways humans are real
outliers<00:00:51.280> in<00:00:51.550> this<00:00:51.670> so<00:00:51.910> it's<00:00:52.059> it's<00:00:52.300> fun<00:00:52.539> to

00:00:52.709 --> 00:00:52.719 
outliers in this so it's it's fun to

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:53.970 
outliers in this so it's it's fun to
look<00:00:52.840> at<00:00:52.960> the<00:00:53.079> kinds<00:00:53.320> of<00:00:53.379> techniques<00:00:53.739> that<00:00:53.920> we

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:53.980 
look at the kinds of techniques that we

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:58.150 
look at the kinds of techniques that we
see<00:00:54.160> across<00:00:54.250> the<00:00:54.579> animal<00:00:54.730> kingdom

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.170 

well<00:00:58.910> humans<00:00:59.810> are<00:00:59.930> very<00:01:00.290> funny<00:01:01.070> species<00:01:01.820> when

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.180 
well humans are very funny species when

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.030 
well humans are very funny species when
it<00:01:02.480> comes<00:01:02.750> to<00:01:03.050> sexual<00:01:03.350> reproduction<00:01:03.740> we're

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
it comes to sexual reproduction we're

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.670 
it comes to sexual reproduction we're
very<00:01:04.370> weird<00:01:04.760> relative<00:01:05.239> to<00:01:05.449> our<00:01:05.810> closest

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
very weird relative to our closest

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.090 
very weird relative to our closest
living<00:01:06.820> primate<00:01:07.820> relatives<00:01:08.240> the<00:01:08.390> other<00:01:08.510> Apes

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
living primate relatives the other Apes

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.480 
living primate relatives the other Apes
so<00:01:10.100> we<00:01:11.200> for<00:01:12.200> the<00:01:12.290> most<00:01:12.560> part<00:01:12.890> seem<00:01:13.190> to<00:01:13.310> be<00:01:13.460> a

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
so we for the most part seem to be a

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.730 
so we for the most part seem to be a
pair<00:01:13.850> bonded<00:01:14.210> species<00:01:14.600> in<00:01:14.900> other<00:01:15.440> words<00:01:15.590> a

pair bonded species in other words a

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.200 
pair bonded species in other words a
male<00:01:15.950> and<00:01:16.100> a<00:01:16.160> female<00:01:16.190> get<00:01:16.670> together<00:01:16.820> and<00:01:17.120> form

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:17.210 
male and a female get together and form

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:18.970 
male and a female get together and form
this<00:01:17.420> pair<00:01:17.660> bond<00:01:17.840> and<00:01:18.080> kind<00:01:18.230> of<00:01:18.320> cooperatively

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:18.980 
this pair bond and kind of cooperatively

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.610 
this pair bond and kind of cooperatively
rear<00:01:19.490> their<00:01:19.730> young<00:01:20.050> there's<00:01:21.050> nothing<00:01:21.440> really

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:21.620 
rear their young there's nothing really

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.190 
rear their young there's nothing really
like<00:01:21.860> that<00:01:22.070> in<00:01:22.340> the<00:01:22.970> rest<00:01:23.600> of<00:01:23.750> the<00:01:23.840> great<00:01:24.050> ape

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.850 
like that in the rest of the great ape
species<00:01:24.670> in<00:01:25.670> chimpanzees<00:01:26.120> are<00:01:26.390> our<00:01:27.170> closest

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860

species in chimpanzees are our closest
living<00:01:27.979> relative<00:01:28.400> you<00:01:28.490> see<00:01:28.640> lots<00:01:29.060> of

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
living relative you see lots of

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.320 
living relative you see lots of
multi-male<00:01:30.110> multi-female<00:01:31.330> reproductive

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.330 
multi-male multi-female reproductive

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.270 
multi-male multi-female reproductive
behavior<00:01:32.450> meaning<00:01:33.080> females<00:01:33.830> are<00:01:33.979> mating<00:01:34.190> with

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
behavior meaning females are mating with

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.590 
behavior meaning females are mating with
multiple<00:01:34.670> males<00:01:34.760> males<00:01:35.090> are<00:01:35.300> mating<00:01:35.510> with

multiple males males are mating with
multiple<00:01:35.960> females<00:01:36.700> but<00:01:37.700> also<00:01:38.060> in<00:01:38.390> chimpanzees

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:38.690 
multiple females but also in chimpanzees

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:41.440 
multiple females but also in chimpanzees
you<00:01:39.170> also<00:01:39.500> see<00:01:39.890> that<00:01:40.040> males<00:01:40.310> and<00:01:40.640> females<00:01:41.240> just

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
you also see that males and females just

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.240 
you also see that males and females just
aren't<00:01:41.720> interested<00:01:41.869> in<00:01:42.200> sex<00:01:42.440> during<00:01:43.040> the

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
aren't interested in sex during the

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:44.740 
aren't interested in sex during the
period<00:01:43.759> of<00:01:43.820> our<00:01:43.910> females<00:01:44.300> aren't<00:01:44.570> very

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
period of our females aren't very

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.230 
period of our females aren't very
productive<00:01:45.350> so<00:01:46.070> female<00:01:46.700> chimpanzees

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
productive so female chimpanzees

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.990 
productive so female chimpanzees
advertise<00:01:47.930> their<00:01:48.340> receptivity<00:01:49.340> that<00:01:49.700> period

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
advertise their receptivity that period

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.640 
advertise their receptivity that period
where<00:01:50.119> they're<00:01:50.210> fertile<00:01:50.630> by<00:01:51.320> having<00:01:51.560> this

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:51.650

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
know why did we lose this trait just in

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.040 
know why did we lose this trait just in
the<00:02:12.470> last<00:02:12.710> seven<00:02:13.160> million<00:02:13.310> years<00:02:13.960> you<00:02:14.960> know

the last seven million years you know

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:16.360 
the last seven million years you know
these<00:02:15.170> are<00:02:15.380> the<00:02:15.500> kinds<00:02:15.770> of<00:02:15.860> things<00:02:16.040> that<00:02:16.130> hang

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:16.370 
these are the kinds of things that hang

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:17.980 
these are the kinds of things that hang
on<00:02:16.490> for<00:02:16.760> long<00:02:16.880> periods<00:02:17.210> of<00:02:17.300> time<00:02:17.360> in<00:02:17.660> primate

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 
on for long periods of time in primate

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:19.720 
on for long periods of time in primate
evolution<00:02:18.020> so<00:02:18.650> the<00:02:19.040> fact<00:02:19.250> that<00:02:19.280> we<00:02:19.400> got<00:02:19.550> rid<00:02:19.670> of

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
evolution so the fact that we got rid of

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:20.920 
evolution so the fact that we got rid of
this<00:02:19.819> really<00:02:20.060> quickly<00:02:20.240> is<00:02:20.390> a<00:02:20.450> bit<00:02:20.600> of<00:02:20.660> a<00:02:20.750> puzzle

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
this really quickly is a bit of a puzzle

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.080 
this really quickly is a bit of a puzzle
so<00:02:21.260> kind<00:02:21.980> of<00:02:22.069> weird<00:02:22.280> relative<00:02:22.790> to<00:02:22.910> other

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
so kind of weird relative to other

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.090 
so kind of weird relative to other
closely<00:02:23.990> related<00:02:24.260> primates<00:02:24.650> when<00:02:24.800> it<00:02:24.920> comes

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:25.100 
closely related primates when it comes

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.510 
closely related primates when it comes
to<00:02:25.310> sex<00:02:26.000> and<00:02:26.270> our<00:02:26.810> sexual<00:02:27.140> behavior<00:02:27.530> the<00:02:27.980> our

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
to sex and our sexual behavior the our

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:29.380 
to sex and our sexual behavior the our
other

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
other

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:31.360 
other
closest<00:02:29.900> so<00:02:30.140> we<00:02:30.230> have<00:02:30.350> two<00:02:30.530> closest<00:02:31.220> living

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
closest so we have two closest living

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.699 
closest so we have two closest living
primate<00:02:31.940> relatives<00:02:32.270> it's<00:02:32.390> a<00:02:32.480> tie<00:02:32.709> between

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:33.709 
primate relatives it's a tie between

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:35.890 
primate relatives it's a tie between
chimpanzees<00:02:34.550> so<00:02:34.819> common<00:02:35.150> chimpanzees<00:02:35.660> and

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900

chimpanzees and bonobos greatly differ

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.350 
chimpanzees and bonobos greatly differ
in<00:02:41.660> their<00:02:41.870> own<00:02:41.990> sexual<00:02:42.440> behavior<00:02:43.090> bonobos<00:02:44.090> are

in their own sexual behavior bonobos are

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.600 
in their own sexual behavior bonobos are
sort<00:02:44.840> of<00:02:44.900> the<00:02:45.050> make<00:02:45.470> love<00:02:45.680> not<00:02:45.890> war<00:02:45.950> kind<00:02:46.520> of

sort of the make love not war kind of

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.330 
sort of the make love not war kind of
primate<00:02:46.970> they<00:02:47.690> tend<00:02:47.900> to<00:02:47.930> be<00:02:48.080> way<00:02:48.290> less<00:02:48.560> violent

primate they tend to be way less violent

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.760 
primate they tend to be way less violent
and<00:02:49.520> aggressive<00:02:49.610> than<00:02:50.090> chimpanzees<00:02:50.600> and<00:02:50.930> one

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:51.770 
and aggressive than chimpanzees and one

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:53.110 
and aggressive than chimpanzees and one
of<00:02:51.890> the<00:02:52.010> behaviors<00:02:52.400> that<00:02:52.430> allows<00:02:52.790> them<00:02:53.000> to

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
of the behaviors that allows them to

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.490 
of the behaviors that allows them to
overcome<00:02:53.510> that<00:02:53.660> is<00:02:53.720> the<00:02:53.959> fact<00:02:54.170> that<00:02:54.260> they're

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
overcome that is the fact that they're

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.160 
overcome that is the fact that they're
very<00:02:54.849> sexually<00:02:55.849> oriented<00:02:56.060> so<00:02:56.840> in<00:02:56.930> a<00:02:56.990> lot<00:02:57.140> of

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:58.300 
very sexually oriented so in a lot of
the<00:02:57.319> situations<00:02:57.830> that<00:02:57.950> would<00:02:58.099> cause

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 
the situations that would cause

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.040 
the situations that would cause
aggression<00:02:58.550> in<00:02:58.910> chimpanzees<00:02:59.390> bonobos

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
aggression in chimpanzees bonobos

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:03.280 
aggression in chimpanzees bonobos
actually<00:03:00.650> resort<00:03:01.010> to<00:03:01.190> having<00:03:02.090> sex<00:03:02.330> to<00:03:03.080> kind<00:03:03.230> of
