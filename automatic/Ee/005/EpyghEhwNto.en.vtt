little bit now the Flex rating this

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.060 
little bit now the Flex rating this
board<00:00:52.080> is<00:00:52.260> about<00:00:53.690> above<00:00:54.690> before<00:00:54.840> but<00:00:55.590> it<00:00:55.680> seems

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
board is about above before but it seems

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.570 
board is about above before but it seems
like<00:00:56.460> it's<00:00:56.670> just<00:00:56.730> a<00:00:57.000> touch<00:00:57.270> stiffer<00:00:58.580> reason

00:00:59.570 --> 00:00:59.580 
like it's just a touch stiffer reason

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.790 
like it's just a touch stiffer reason
that<00:00:59.700> you<00:01:00.480> actually<00:01:00.720> have<00:01:01.110> no<00:01:01.140> idea<00:01:01.290> why<00:01:01.740> it

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
that you actually have no idea why it

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.920 
that you actually have no idea why it
seems<00:01:02.100> different<00:01:02.400> than<00:01:02.790> that<00:01:03.240> because<00:01:03.510> it<00:01:03.810> has

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
seems different than that because it has

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.020 
seems different than that because it has
it<00:01:04.079> pretty<00:01:04.229> much<00:01:04.379> but<00:01:05.309> tip<00:01:05.430> to<00:01:05.519> toe<00:01:05.700> we<00:01:05.850> have<00:01:05.970> a
