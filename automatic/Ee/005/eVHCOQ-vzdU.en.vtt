00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:06.760
 there is another type of failure in most 

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:10.030
 of car alarms that is 

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:12.400
 pretty repairable but just like in the 

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:14.530
 another case of the siren output is a 

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:17.019
 fails that the technician usually does not 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.279
 is ready to repair but with a 

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:20.109
 little patience and the tool 

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:25.670
 we can do this repair 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:28.850
 it is a failure that is expressed 

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:31.869
 as lack of insurance control 

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.869
 lack of blocking 

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.410
 a fault in him 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:41.699
 good lights is to say the alarm 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:44.649
 practically does not do anything in this case 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:46.449
 what we are going to review is is integrated 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:49.239
 from here that I am going to show it amplified 

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:52.640
 and as in the previous video it is about 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:55.730
 an integrated that is a series d 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.950
 of drivers that are responsible for sending the 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.379
 pulses out of the alarm those of 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:02.870
 insurance insurance courses come out of 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:07.159
 here the motor lock pulse comes out 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:09.410
 here the pulse that triggers the relay 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:12.890
 of lights also leaves here then 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:15.860
 when this integrated circuit fails or 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:18.680
 it burns those functions cease to exist 

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:22.580
 or they mix between them is when 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:25.580
 then the alarm does strange things 

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:27.800
 we would say in colloquial terms that 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.350
 Go crazy that for example insurance 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:34.130
 close and open at the pace of 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:36.740
 lights or that the horn output beeps at 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:39.980
 close the insurance and so on is a flaw 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.890
 pretty common and good there are times 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:44.630
 this integrated circuit is easy to 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.790
 replace here we see the serial number 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:51.330
 It's a pretty commercial circuit but 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:54.150
 the cost around 10 15 pesos 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:56.220
 the difficulty of this case is that it is a 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:58.410
 Surface mounting circuit 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.590
 It takes some skill and 

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:03.180
 tool to change it but it's something 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.850
 what can be done and is quite 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.160
 economic do this repair instead 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:10.520
 of replacing the entire brain of the 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.520
 alarm
