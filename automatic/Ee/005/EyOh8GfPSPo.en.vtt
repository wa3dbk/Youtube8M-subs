00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
talked about the cd-rom attachment we

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.690 
talked about the cd-rom attachment we
discussed<00:01:36.539> that<00:01:36.990> included<00:01:37.800> with<00:01:38.070> the<00:01:38.280> cd-rom

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
discussed that included with the cd-rom

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.350 
discussed that included with the cd-rom
was<00:01:39.479> a<00:01:39.810> CD<00:01:40.380> system<00:01:40.740> card<00:01:41.250> it<00:01:41.700> was<00:01:41.850> basically<00:01:42.240> a

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
was a CD system card it was basically a

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.109 
was a CD system card it was basically a
turbo<00:01:42.869> chip<00:01:43.140> that<00:01:43.320> looked<00:01:43.530> like<00:01:43.619> this<00:01:44.100> and<00:01:44.460> it

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
turbo chip that looked like this and it

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.669 
turbo chip that looked like this and it
fit<00:01:45.450> right<00:01:45.840> into<00:01:46.050> the<00:01:46.289> front<00:01:46.470> of<00:01:46.619> the

00:01:46.669 --> 00:01:46.679 
fit right into the front of the

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:49.219 
fit right into the front of the
turbografx-16<00:01:47.520> base<00:01:48.000> unit<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:48.509> it<00:01:48.990> pretty

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
turbografx-16 base unit and it pretty

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.070 
turbografx-16 base unit and it pretty
much<00:01:49.500> allowed<00:01:50.280> you<00:01:50.550> access<00:01:50.819> to<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.539> cd-rom

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.080 
much allowed you access to the cd-rom

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.070 
much allowed you access to the cd-rom
portion<00:01:53.009> of<00:01:53.160> the<00:01:53.429> system<00:01:53.819> it<00:01:54.270> acted<00:01:54.690> as<00:01:54.810> RAM

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080 
portion of the system it acted as RAM

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.419 
portion of the system it acted as RAM
for<00:01:55.349> the<00:01:55.440> system<00:01:55.770> and<00:01:55.920> a<00:01:55.950> couple<00:01:56.160> of<00:01:56.310> other

00:01:56.419 --> 00:01:56.429 
for the system and a couple of other

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:58.790 
for the system and a couple of other
technical<00:01:56.849> things<00:01:57.240> which<00:01:57.509> forget<00:01:58.380> about<00:01:58.500> it

00:01:58.790 --> 00:01:58.800 
technical things which forget about it

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.219 
technical things which forget about it
but<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.369> point<00:01:59.520> is<00:01:59.789> you<00:02:00.179> needed<00:02:00.509> this<00:02:00.660> card<00:02:00.959> to

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
but the point is you needed this card to

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.699 
but the point is you needed this card to
play<00:02:01.380> CD<00:02:01.920> games<00:02:02.840> so<00:02:03.840> what<00:02:03.990> the<00:02:04.110> super<00:02:04.410> system

00:02:04.699 --> 00:02:04.709 
play CD games so what the super system

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:07.580 
play CD games so what the super system
card<00:02:05.009> is<00:02:05.190> is<00:02:05.459> basically<00:02:05.849> an<00:02:06.119> upgrade<00:02:06.750> to<00:02:07.319> this

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
card is is basically an upgrade to this

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.460 
card is is basically an upgrade to this
chip<00:02:08.539> that<00:02:09.539> was<00:02:09.660> back<00:02:09.840> at<00:02:09.990> a<00:02:10.050> time<00:02:10.229> where<00:02:10.410> they

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
chip that was back at a time where they

look<00:04:09.200> it<00:04:09.320> just<00:04:09.350> comes<00:04:09.890> in<00:04:10.040> a<00:04:10.070> regular<00:04:10.430> CD<00:04:10.940> case

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
look it just comes in a regular CD case

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.170 
look it just comes in a regular CD case
and<00:04:12.080> on<00:04:12.290> the<00:04:12.380> back<00:04:12.560> is<00:04:13.220> some<00:04:13.520> information<00:04:14.060> as

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:14.180 
and on the back is some information as

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:16.210 
and on the back is some information as
well<00:04:14.330> now<00:04:15.110> if<00:04:15.260> you're<00:04:15.380> looking<00:04:15.710> to<00:04:15.830> buy<00:04:16.010> one

yourself<00:04:16.420> they're<00:04:17.420> not<00:04:17.570> that<00:04:17.780> easy<00:04:17.959> to<00:04:18.140> find<00:04:18.350> I

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
yourself they're not that easy to find I

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:19.840 
yourself they're not that easy to find I
guess<00:04:18.769> it's<00:04:18.950> they<00:04:19.070> just<00:04:19.280> really<00:04:19.519> didn't<00:04:19.730> make

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850 
guess it's they just really didn't make

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:21.729 
guess it's they just really didn't make
very<00:04:19.880> many<00:04:20.269> of<00:04:20.420> them<00:04:20.660> especially<00:04:21.440> since<00:04:21.650> it

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:21.739 
very many of them especially since it

00:04:21.739 --> 00:04:24.070 
very many of them especially since it
was<00:04:21.769> mail<00:04:22.130> order<00:04:22.490> only<00:04:22.670> but<00:04:23.630> the<00:04:23.720> other<00:04:23.840> thing

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:24.080 
was mail order only but the other thing

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.650 
was mail order only but the other thing
to<00:04:24.170> keep<00:04:24.290> in<00:04:24.410> mind<00:04:24.590> is<00:04:24.800> the<00:04:24.950> pc<00:04:25.370> engine

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:25.660 
to keep in mind is the pc engine

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 
purchasing the super system card it

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.680 
purchasing the super system card it
pulls<00:05:00.320> out<00:05:00.620> and<00:05:00.890> it's<00:05:01.880> in<00:05:02.030> a<00:05:02.090> couple<00:05:02.419> different

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:02.690 
pulls out and it's in a couple different

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:05.080 
pulls out and it's in a couple different
languages<00:05:03.110> so<00:05:03.440> I<00:05:03.790> don't<00:05:04.790> think<00:05:04.970> I<00:05:05.060> even

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090 
languages so I don't think I even

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:07.540 
languages so I don't think I even
bothered<00:05:05.720> because<00:05:05.870> what<00:05:06.470> for<00:05:06.710> just<00:05:07.280> put<00:05:07.460> the

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.550 
bothered because what for just put the

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.480 
bothered because what for just put the
chip<00:05:07.700> in<00:05:07.850> the<00:05:07.940> system<00:05:08.270> and<00:05:08.390> let's<00:05:08.540> go<00:05:09.310> if<00:05:10.310> we

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:10.490 
chip in the system and let's go if we

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:12.190 
chip in the system and let's go if we
take<00:05:10.640> the<00:05:10.790> chip<00:05:10.970> out<00:05:11.120> of<00:05:11.270> the<00:05:11.330> pouch<00:05:11.540> you'll

00:05:12.190 --> 00:05:12.200 
take the chip out of the pouch you'll

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.860 
take the chip out of the pouch you'll
notice<00:05:12.560> that<00:05:12.820> it's<00:05:13.820> a<00:05:13.970> little<00:05:14.210> thicker<00:05:14.540> than

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:14.870 
notice that it's a little thicker than

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:18.219 
notice that it's a little thicker than
the<00:05:15.260> original<00:05:15.650> car<00:05:15.860> I<00:05:16.479> guess<00:05:17.479> this<00:05:17.720> part<00:05:18.020> here

00:05:18.219 --> 00:05:18.229 
the original car I guess this part here

00:05:18.229 --> 00:05:20.200 
the original car I guess this part here
this<00:05:18.470> little<00:05:18.740> hump<00:05:18.919> is<00:05:19.430> what<00:05:19.669> allows<00:05:19.940> it<00:05:19.970> to

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:20.210 
this little hump is what allows it to

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:24.340 
this little hump is what allows it to
play<00:05:20.570> two<00:05:21.229> mega<00:05:21.740> bit<00:05:22.040> games<00:05:23.110> but<00:05:24.110> otherwise

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:24.350 
play two mega bit games but otherwise

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:26.020 
play two mega bit games but otherwise
really<00:05:24.800> isn't<00:05:24.919> much<00:05:25.160> else<00:05:25.370> to<00:05:25.490> it<00:05:25.729> it<00:05:25.820> slips

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:26.030 
really isn't much else to it it slips

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:27.730 
really isn't much else to it it slips
right<00:05:26.180> into<00:05:26.479> the<00:05:26.660> front<00:05:26.840> of<00:05:26.960> the<00:05:27.050> system<00:05:27.229> and

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:27.740 
right into the front of the system and

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.890 
right into the front of the system and
there<00:05:28.100> you<00:05:28.220> go<00:05:28.340> when<00:05:28.910> you<00:05:29.030> turn<00:05:29.210> the<00:05:29.390> switch<00:05:29.660> on

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:29.900 
there you go when you turn the switch on

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:32.350 
there you go when you turn the switch on
the<00:05:30.560> menu<00:05:30.950> on<00:05:31.070> the<00:05:31.100> inside<00:05:31.580> will<00:05:31.790> actually<00:05:32.120> say

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:32.360 
the menu on the inside will actually say

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:35.920 
the menu on the inside will actually say

something unique and it did not

00:07:31.059 --> 00:07:32.909 
something unique and it did not
disappoint<00:07:31.239> me<00:07:31.749> some<00:07:32.229> games<00:07:32.469> took<00:07:32.679> more

00:07:32.909 --> 00:07:32.919 
disappoint me some games took more

00:07:32.919 --> 00:07:34.949 
disappoint me some games took more
advantage<00:07:33.279> of<00:07:33.399> the<00:07:33.459> super<00:07:33.819> than<00:07:34.209> others<00:07:34.479> but

00:07:34.949 --> 00:07:34.959 
advantage of the super than others but

00:07:34.959 --> 00:07:37.229 
advantage of the super than others but
still<00:07:35.259> it<00:07:35.499> was<00:07:35.649> great<00:07:35.860> to<00:07:36.009> have<00:07:36.159> so<00:07:36.519> now

00:07:37.229 --> 00:07:37.239 
still it was great to have so now

00:07:37.239 --> 00:07:38.789 
still it was great to have so now
eventually<00:07:37.839> all<00:07:38.049> of<00:07:38.379> this<00:07:38.529> would<00:07:38.769> be

00:07:38.789 --> 00:07:38.799 
eventually all of this would be

00:07:38.799 --> 00:07:42.179 
eventually all of this would be
condensed<00:07:39.399> into<00:07:39.459> the<00:07:39.909> turbo<00:07:40.269> duel<00:07:40.979> but<00:07:41.979> we'll

00:07:42.179 --> 00:07:42.189 
condensed into the turbo duel but we'll
