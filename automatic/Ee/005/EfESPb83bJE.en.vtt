00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.340 
ways this argument I think is a very
good<00:02:38.760> one<00:02:38.940> to<00:02:39.030> have<00:02:39.150> for<00:02:39.750> example<00:02:40.140> you<00:02:40.230> can

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
good one to have for example you can

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:41.990 
good one to have for example you can
look<00:02:40.470> at<00:02:40.620> some<00:02:40.980> MMOs<00:02:41.430> that<00:02:41.610> give<00:02:41.730> people

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:42.000 
look at some MMOs that give people

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.820 
look at some MMOs that give people
ridiculous<00:02:42.600> amount<00:02:42.810> of<00:02:42.900> customization<00:02:43.290> let's

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
ridiculous amount of customization let's

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.460 
ridiculous amount of customization let's
look<00:02:43.920> at<00:02:44.100> a<00:02:44.130> ion<00:02:45.000> for<00:02:45.209> example<00:02:45.660> they<00:02:46.080> just<00:02:46.320> let

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
look at a ion for example they just let

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.140 
look at a ion for example they just let
P<00:02:46.620> they<00:02:46.830> just<00:02:47.040> give<00:02:47.190> the<00:02:47.400> the<00:02:47.700> rain<00:02:47.880> to<00:02:48.030> the

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
P they just give the the rain to the

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.220 
P they just give the the rain to the
players<00:02:48.330> as<00:02:48.480> they<00:02:48.510> do<00:02:48.750> whatever<00:02:48.990> the<00:02:49.080> hell<00:02:49.200> you

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
players as they do whatever the hell you

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.320 
players as they do whatever the hell you
want<00:02:49.470> and<00:02:49.620> that's<00:02:50.310> bad<00:02:50.550> in<00:02:50.820> my<00:02:50.970> opinion<00:02:51.180> I

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:51.330 
want and that's bad in my opinion I

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.180 
want and that's bad in my opinion I
don't<00:02:51.360> think<00:02:51.600> that<00:02:51.780> really<00:02:52.530> that<00:02:52.770> is<00:02:52.920> a<00:02:52.950> good

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
don't think that really that is a good

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:55.010 
don't think that really that is a good
thing<00:02:53.400> for<00:02:53.459> mmos<00:02:53.940> because<00:02:54.360> you<00:02:54.720> end<00:02:54.840> up<00:02:54.930> having

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
thing for mmos because you end up having

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.410 
thing for mmos because you end up having
players<00:02:55.350> who<00:02:55.560> make<00:02:55.680> these<00:02:55.890> just<00:02:56.430> ugly<00:02:56.790> ugly

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
players who make these just ugly ugly

players who make these just ugly ugly
looking<00:02:57.900> character<00:02:58.260> not<00:02:58.410> necessarily<00:02:58.920> just

looking character not necessarily just

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.070 
looking character not necessarily just
ugly<00:02:59.250> but<00:02:59.550> completely<00:03:00.080> unrealistic

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
ugly but completely unrealistic

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.040 
ugly but completely unrealistic
immersion<00:03:01.680> breaking<00:03:02.420> horrible<00:03:03.420> things<00:03:03.870> that

immersion breaking horrible things that

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:06.170 
immersion breaking horrible things that

really reduce the overall aesthetic of
the<00:03:06.270> game<00:03:06.450> what<00:03:06.989> you<00:03:07.050> need<00:03:07.170> to<00:03:07.230> remember<00:03:07.410> is

the game what you need to remember is

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
and you can put as much effort as you

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.020 
and you can put as much effort as you

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
landscapes which I reading that clearly

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:20.840 
landscapes which I reading that clearly
have<00:03:19.560> done<00:03:19.830> to<00:03:19.980> make<00:03:20.070> them<00:03:20.250> look<00:03:20.280> absolutely

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
have done to make them look absolutely

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.060 
have done to make them look absolutely
stunning<00:03:21.180> but<00:03:22.170> if<00:03:22.380> you've<00:03:22.560> allowed<00:03:22.769> players

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
stunning but if you've allowed players

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:24.920 
stunning but if you've allowed players
to<00:03:23.250> make<00:03:23.400> characters<00:03:23.850> that<00:03:24.180> look<00:03:24.360> absolutely

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
to make characters that look absolutely

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.530 
to make characters that look absolutely
disgusting<00:03:25.680> and<00:03:25.799> completely<00:03:26.489> out<00:03:27.120> of<00:03:27.180> the

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
disgusting and completely out of the

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.180 
disgusting and completely out of the
picture<00:03:27.570> then<00:03:28.290> really<00:03:28.560> it<00:03:28.709> just<00:03:28.739> distracts

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
picture then really it just distracts

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:30.650 
picture then really it just distracts
from<00:03:29.340> the<00:03:29.489> entire<00:03:29.820> thing<00:03:29.850> and<00:03:30.360> people<00:03:30.450> are

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
from the entire thing and people are

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:31.670 
from the entire thing and people are
going<00:03:30.750> to<00:03:30.840> question<00:03:31.080> that<00:03:31.140> especially<00:03:31.560> when

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
going to question that especially when

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:32.810 
going to question that especially when
the<00:03:31.739> character<00:03:32.340> is<00:03:32.370> the<00:03:32.519> thing<00:03:32.700> you're

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
the character is the thing you're

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.640 
the character is the thing you're
playing<00:03:33.230> obviously<00:03:34.230> you're<00:03:34.350> going<00:03:34.470> to<00:03:34.530> want

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
playing obviously you're going to want

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.740 
playing obviously you're going to want
them<00:03:34.769> to<00:03:34.830> look<00:03:35.100> good<00:03:35.430> to<00:03:35.730> a<00:03:35.760> degree<00:03:35.910> but<00:03:36.239> I

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
them to look good to a degree but I

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.210 
them to look good to a degree but I
would<00:03:37.110> say<00:03:37.290> that<00:03:37.320> they<00:03:37.560> can<00:03:37.709> still<00:03:37.860> look<00:03:37.890> good

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
would say that they can still look good

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.430 
would say that they can still look good
and<00:03:38.459> obviously<00:03:39.090> be<00:03:39.269> ugly<00:03:39.750> characters<00:03:40.200> I<00:03:40.260> think

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
and obviously be ugly characters I think

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:41.199 
and obviously be ugly characters I think
there's<00:03:40.590> a<00:03:40.650> difference<00:03:40.769> there<00:03:41.040> between

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:41.209 
there's a difference there between

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:44.120 
there's a difference there between
having<00:03:42.209> characters<00:03:43.110> that<00:03:43.260> simply<00:03:43.709> just<00:03:43.920> look

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:44.130 
having characters that simply just look

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:45.710 
having characters that simply just look
completely<00:03:44.519> the<00:03:44.670> wrong<00:03:44.700> proportions<00:03:45.420> tiny

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
completely the wrong proportions tiny

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.210 
completely the wrong proportions tiny
little<00:03:45.870> heads<00:03:46.110> on<00:03:46.260> massive<00:03:46.560> bodies<00:03:46.830> or<00:03:46.950> just

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:47.220 
little heads on massive bodies or just

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:48.740 
little heads on massive bodies or just
you<00:03:47.400> know<00:03:47.430> ridiculous<00:03:48.060> things<00:03:48.239> like<00:03:48.390> that<00:03:48.540> and

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:48.750 
you know ridiculous things like that and

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:51.530 
you know ridiculous things like that and
simply<00:03:49.620> having<00:03:49.950> characters<00:03:50.700> that<00:03:50.940> don't<00:03:51.000> look

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
simply having characters that don't look

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:53.300 
simply having characters that don't look
beautiful<00:03:52.290> there's<00:03:52.500> a<00:03:52.560> difference<00:03:52.950> there<00:03:53.040> and

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
beautiful there's a difference there and

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:54.620 
beautiful there's a difference there and
I<00:03:53.370> think<00:03:53.610> that<00:03:53.730> they<00:03:53.850> are<00:03:53.880> missing<00:03:54.330> out<00:03:54.450> by<00:03:54.600> not

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
I think that they are missing out by not

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.449 
I think that they are missing out by not
letting<00:03:54.959> us<00:03:55.140> have<00:03:55.320> ugly<00:03:55.799> character<00:03:56.340> and<00:03:56.430> I

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
letting us have ugly character and I

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:59.030 
letting us have ugly character and I
can't<00:03:56.730> see<00:03:57.120> why<00:03:57.450> they're<00:03:57.840> not<00:03:58.080> adding<00:03:58.709> those

00:03:59.030 --> 00:03:59.040 
can't see why they're not adding those

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:00.800 
can't see why they're not adding those
options<00:03:59.489> in<00:03:59.670> maybe<00:03:59.910> they<00:04:00.120> just<00:04:00.150> wanted<00:04:00.630> to

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
options in maybe they just wanted to

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.050 
options in maybe they just wanted to
focus<00:04:01.019> on<00:04:01.380> that<00:04:01.560> one<00:04:01.830> specific<00:04:02.519> thing<00:04:02.549> for

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
focus on that one specific thing for

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.580 
focus on that one specific thing for
humans<00:04:03.420> and<00:04:03.660> now<00:04:03.989> that<00:04:04.110> they've<00:04:04.200> done<00:04:04.380> it<00:04:04.500> I

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
humans and now that they've done it I

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:05.960 
humans and now that they've done it I
don't<00:04:04.739> want<00:04:04.860> to<00:04:04.920> put<00:04:05.010> send<00:04:05.310> the<00:04:05.400> resources

more people than you'd expect do

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.050

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
obviously I would still say the majority

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.789 
obviously I would still say the majority
of<00:04:18.419> people<00:04:18.720> do<00:04:18.870> just<00:04:19.169> want<00:04:19.320> their<00:04:19.440> characters

look beautiful and don't care about

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:22.520 
look beautiful and don't care about
maybe<00:04:21.150> making<00:04:21.359> a<00:04:21.570> character<00:04:21.959> that<00:04:21.989> looks<00:04:22.169> ugly

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
maybe making a character that looks ugly

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:23.690 
maybe making a character that looks ugly
in<00:04:22.620> some<00:04:22.830> way<00:04:22.979> I<00:04:23.190> would<00:04:23.430> say<00:04:23.550> the<00:04:23.640> majority

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
in some way I would say the majority

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.730 
in some way I would say the majority
still<00:04:24.150> aren't<00:04:24.360> like<00:04:24.479> that<00:04:24.510> but<00:04:24.990> there<00:04:25.410> are<00:04:25.560> an

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
still aren't like that but there are an

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.020 
still aren't like that but there are an
awful<00:04:25.800> lot<00:04:26.010> of<00:04:26.130> us<00:04:26.340> that<00:04:26.490> like<00:04:26.640> to<00:04:26.760> play<00:04:26.940> around

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
awful lot of us that like to play around

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
that

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:28.850 
that
I think<00:04:27.750> especially<00:04:27.900> people<00:04:28.380> who<00:04:28.410> really

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
I think especially people who really

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.140 
I think especially people who really
want<00:04:28.950> to<00:04:29.160> immerse<00:04:29.310> themselves<00:04:29.550> in<00:04:29.880> the<00:04:29.970> world

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
want to immerse themselves in the world

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:31.940 
want to immerse themselves in the world
a<00:04:30.240> little<00:04:30.330> bit<00:04:30.510> ball<00:04:30.690> and<00:04:30.900> on<00:04:31.560> that<00:04:31.710> same

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:31.950 
a little bit ball and on that same

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:34.340 
a little bit ball and on that same
immersion<00:04:32.520> argument<00:04:33.060> as<00:04:33.180> well<00:04:33.390> you<00:04:34.020> can<00:04:34.170> say

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
immersion argument as well you can say

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:35.630 
immersion argument as well you can say
old<00:04:34.560> don't<00:04:34.740> give<00:04:34.860> players<00:04:35.070> too<00:04:35.280> much<00:04:35.430> control

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:35.640 
old don't give players too much control

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.370 
old don't give players too much control
because<00:04:35.970> it<00:04:36.060> will<00:04:36.180> ruin<00:04:36.360> immersion<00:04:37.140> because

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:37.380 
because it will ruin immersion because

00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:38.990 
because it will ruin immersion because
you<00:04:37.470> have<00:04:37.590> these<00:04:37.680> stupid<00:04:38.070> looking<00:04:38.310> things<00:04:38.490> but

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:39.000 
you have these stupid looking things but

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.610 
you have these stupid looking things but
if<00:04:39.150> you<00:04:39.240> don't<00:04:39.420> give<00:04:39.570> players<00:04:39.810> enough<00:04:40.230> control

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
if you don't give players enough control

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.080 
if you don't give players enough control
what<00:04:40.980> arenanet<00:04:41.430> is<00:04:41.520> doing<00:04:41.730> here<00:04:41.880> is<00:04:41.970> actually

what arenanet is doing here is actually

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:43.670 
what arenanet is doing here is actually
the<00:04:42.300> opposite<00:04:42.660> the<00:04:42.960> game's<00:04:43.170> going<00:04:43.260> to<00:04:43.320> be<00:04:43.410> less

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
the opposite the game's going to be less

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:47.570 
immersive in somewhat route guards now
that<00:04:46.320> you<00:04:46.620> can<00:04:46.770> never<00:04:46.890> have<00:04:47.130> a<00:04:47.160> character<00:04:47.550> that

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
that you can never have a character that

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.100 
that you can never have a character that
looks<00:04:47.760> out<00:04:47.940> because<00:04:48.330> it's<00:04:48.600> just<00:04:48.810> all<00:04:48.990> the

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
looks out because it's just all the

humans you're ever really going to meet

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.580 
humans you're ever really going to meet
the<00:04:50.640> players<00:04:51.120> at<00:04:51.480> least<00:04:51.690> I<00:04:51.900> can<00:04:52.050> all<00:04:52.140> look<00:04:52.410> like

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:52.590 
the players at least I can all look like

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.740 
the players at least I can all look like
these<00:04:52.800> beautiful<00:04:53.370> young<00:04:53.400> characters<00:04:54.300> that<00:04:54.480> it

these beautiful young characters that it
just<00:04:54.930> doesn't<00:04:55.170> seem<00:04:55.290> to<00:04:55.320> make<00:04:55.500> too<00:04:55.680> much<00:04:55.800> sense

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:55.860 
just doesn't seem to make too much sense

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.650 
just doesn't seem to make too much sense

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:03.690 
them there won't be that much variety in

why<00:05:06.990> can't<00:05:07.260> we<00:05:07.380> do<00:05:07.470> I<00:05:07.560> can't<00:05:07.770> we<00:05:07.890> just<00:05:08.010> choose

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610 
why can't we do I can't we just choose

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:10.640 
why can't we do I can't we just choose
those<00:05:09.030> and<00:05:09.390> have<00:05:09.690> some<00:05:09.990> of<00:05:10.110> those<00:05:10.200> textures

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:10.650

you<00:05:12.600> know<00:05:12.720> stuff<00:05:12.900> like<00:05:12.990> why<00:05:13.440> can't<00:05:13.620> you<00:05:13.710> just

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860 
you know stuff like why can't you just

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:15.290 
you know stuff like why can't you just
put<00:05:14.040> them<00:05:14.220> over<00:05:14.310> to<00:05:14.520> character<00:05:14.820> creation<00:05:15.150> how

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:15.300 
put them over to character creation how

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.000 
put them over to character creation how
hard<00:05:15.570> could<00:05:15.750> that<00:05:15.810> be<00:05:15.930> even<00:05:16.590> if<00:05:16.680> we<00:05:16.770> don't<00:05:16.860> get

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:17.010 
hard could that be even if we don't get

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:18.890 
hard could that be even if we don't get
much<00:05:17.190> variety<00:05:17.370> having<00:05:17.880> some<00:05:18.150> I<00:05:18.360> would<00:05:18.420> say<00:05:18.690> is

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:18.900 
much variety having some I would say is

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:21.770 
much variety having some I would say is
far<00:05:19.770> better<00:05:19.860> than<00:05:20.010> none<00:05:20.370> at<00:05:20.610> all<00:05:20.790> and<00:05:21.060> yeah

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:21.780 
far better than none at all and yeah

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:23.240 
far better than none at all and yeah
it's<00:05:22.170> something<00:05:22.470> that<00:05:22.590> I'm<00:05:22.680> very<00:05:22.710> curious

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.250 
it's something that I'm very curious

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:24.950

about<00:05:23.460> they've<00:05:23.640> done<00:05:23.790> a<00:05:23.820> lot<00:05:24.150> for<00:05:24.630> character

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:24.960 
about they've done a lot for character

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.000 
about they've done a lot for character
creation<00:05:25.260> but<00:05:25.350> they're<00:05:25.470> not<00:05:25.560> letting<00:05:25.740> us<00:05:25.830> do

you ask me

00:06:41.249 --> 00:06:42.259 
you ask me
and<00:06:41.339> they'll<00:06:41.459> probably<00:06:41.609> have<00:06:41.759> a<00:06:41.849> very<00:06:42.089> high

00:06:42.259 --> 00:06:42.269 
and they'll probably have a very high

00:06:42.269 --> 00:06:43.669 
and they'll probably have a very high
cap<00:06:42.599> on<00:06:42.749> the<00:06:42.809> amount<00:06:42.839> of<00:06:43.049> character<00:06:43.439> slots<00:06:43.619> you

00:06:43.669 --> 00:06:43.679 
cap on the amount of character slots you

00:06:43.679 --> 00:06:45.079 
cap on the amount of character slots you
can<00:06:43.769> have<00:06:43.949> it<00:06:44.069> was<00:06:44.159> very<00:06:44.429> high<00:06:44.639> in<00:06:44.789> guild<00:06:44.999> wars

00:06:45.079 --> 00:06:45.089 
can have it was very high in guild wars

00:06:45.089 --> 00:06:46.759 
can have it was very high in guild wars
one<00:06:45.419> and<00:06:45.869> I'm<00:06:45.959> sure<00:06:46.079> it<00:06:46.139> will<00:06:46.199> be<00:06:46.319> very<00:06:46.439> high<00:06:46.709> in

00:06:46.759 --> 00:06:46.769 
one and I'm sure it will be very high in

00:06:46.769 --> 00:06:48.769 
one and I'm sure it will be very high in
guild<00:06:47.009> wars<00:06:47.069> 2<00:06:47.309> as<00:06:47.549> well<00:06:47.699> there<00:06:48.539> is<00:06:48.659> the

00:06:48.769 --> 00:06:48.779 
guild wars 2 as well there is the

00:06:48.779 --> 00:06:49.999 
guild wars 2 as well there is the
question<00:06:48.869> of<00:06:49.109> when<00:06:49.289> expansions<00:06:49.739> come<00:06:49.889> out

00:06:49.999 --> 00:06:50.009 
question of when expansions come out

00:06:50.009 --> 00:06:51.919 
question of when expansions come out
when<00:06:50.189> we<00:06:50.279> get<00:06:50.369> an<00:06:50.459> extra<00:06:50.549> slot<00:06:50.969> maybe<00:06:51.239> maybe<00:06:51.779> I

00:06:51.919 --> 00:06:51.929 
when we get an extra slot maybe maybe I

00:06:51.929 --> 00:06:53.209 
when we get an extra slot maybe maybe I
think<00:06:52.229> if<00:06:52.319> they<00:06:52.439> had<00:06:52.559> another<00:06:52.769> race<00:06:53.009> with

00:06:53.209 --> 00:06:53.219 
think if they had another race with

00:06:53.219 --> 00:06:54.379 
think if they had another race with
expansions<00:06:53.729> they'll<00:06:53.879> give<00:06:54.029> us<00:06:54.059> another

00:06:54.379 --> 00:06:54.389 
expansions they'll give us another

00:06:54.389 --> 00:06:56.179 
expansions they'll give us another
character<00:06:54.809> slot<00:06:55.049> for<00:06:55.499> that<00:06:55.649> expansion<00:06:55.949> I

00:06:56.179 --> 00:06:56.189 
character slot for that expansion I

00:06:56.189 --> 00:06:57.589 
character slot for that expansion I
could<00:06:56.519> totally<00:06:56.639> see<00:06:56.909> them<00:06:57.059> doing<00:06:57.209> that<00:06:57.299> that

00:06:57.589 --> 00:06:57.599 
could totally see them doing that that

00:06:57.599 --> 00:06:58.789 
could totally see them doing that that
would<00:06:57.689> help<00:06:57.809> with<00:06:57.989> sales<00:06:58.259> for<00:06:58.499> the<00:06:58.559> expansion

00:06:58.789 --> 00:06:58.799 
would help with sales for the expansion

00:06:58.799 --> 00:07:01.729 
would help with sales for the expansion
so<00:06:59.189> I<00:06:59.249> could<00:06:59.429> see<00:06:59.549> that<00:06:59.699> but<00:07:00.269> I<00:07:00.299> am<00:07:01.139> very<00:07:01.529> much

00:07:01.729 --> 00:07:01.739 
so I could see that but I am very much

00:07:01.739 --> 00:07:03.589 
so I could see that but I am very much
expecting<00:07:02.219> 5<00:07:02.459> character<00:07:02.879> slots<00:07:03.089> and<00:07:03.209> as<00:07:03.359> I<00:07:03.479> say

00:07:03.589 --> 00:07:03.599 
expecting 5 character slots and as I say

00:07:03.599 --> 00:07:04.759 
expecting 5 character slots and as I say
that<00:07:03.749> might<00:07:03.899> even<00:07:03.929> be<00:07:04.139> an<00:07:04.289> officially

00:07:04.759 --> 00:07:04.769 
that might even be an officially

00:07:04.769 --> 00:07:06.319 
that might even be an officially
announced<00:07:05.129> at<00:07:05.219> this<00:07:05.339> point<00:07:05.579> and<00:07:05.759> I'm<00:07:06.119> just

00:07:06.319 --> 00:07:06.329 
announced at this point and I'm just

00:07:06.329 --> 00:07:08.179 
announced at this point and I'm just
forgetting<00:07:06.629> exactly<00:07:07.019> where<00:07:07.199> but<00:07:07.439> i<00:07:07.679> wouldn't

00:07:08.179 --> 00:07:08.189 
forgetting exactly where but i wouldn't

00:07:08.189 --> 00:07:10.279 
forgetting exactly where but i wouldn't
expect<00:07:08.309> too<00:07:08.819> many<00:07:08.969> more<00:07:09.239> than<00:07:09.389> five<00:07:09.599> i<00:07:09.839> really

00:07:10.279 --> 00:07:10.289 
expect too many more than five i really

00:07:10.289 --> 00:07:12.199 
expect too many more than five i really
really<00:07:10.499> wouldn't<00:07:10.919> i<00:07:11.039> given<00:07:11.639> us<00:07:11.759> eight<00:07:11.999> would

00:07:12.199 --> 00:07:12.209 
really wouldn't i given us eight would

00:07:12.209 --> 00:07:14.119 
really wouldn't i given us eight would
be<00:07:12.269> nice<00:07:12.689> giving<00:07:13.289> us<00:07:13.379> one<00:07:13.559> for<00:07:13.739> every<00:07:13.949> single

00:07:14.119 --> 00:07:14.129 
be nice giving us one for every single

00:07:14.129 --> 00:07:16.429 
be nice giving us one for every single
profession<00:07:14.639> but<00:07:15.209> i<00:07:15.479> think<00:07:15.749> they'd<00:07:15.959> lose<00:07:16.139> a<00:07:16.169> lot

00:07:16.429 --> 00:07:16.439 
profession but i think they'd lose a lot

00:07:16.439 --> 00:07:19.429 
profession but i think they'd lose a lot
of<00:07:16.469> money<00:07:16.559> on<00:07:17.129> the<00:07:17.639> game<00:07:17.669> really<00:07:18.179> and<00:07:18.629> pretty

00:07:19.429 --> 00:07:19.439 
of money on the game really and pretty

00:07:19.439 --> 00:07:20.929 
of money on the game really and pretty
needlessly<00:07:20.009> as<00:07:20.189> well<00:07:20.339> if<00:07:20.459> they<00:07:20.610> if<00:07:20.789> they<00:07:20.909> were

00:07:20.929 --> 00:07:20.939 
needlessly as well if they if they were

00:07:20.939 --> 00:07:22.399 
needlessly as well if they if they were
that<00:07:21.149> generous<00:07:21.479> with<00:07:21.599> us<00:07:21.779> and<00:07:21.989> I'd<00:07:22.289> be

00:07:22.399 --> 00:07:22.409 
that generous with us and I'd be

00:07:22.409 --> 00:07:24.049 
that generous with us and I'd be
perfectly<00:07:22.769> happy<00:07:22.860> with<00:07:23.159> five<00:07:23.339> slots<00:07:23.610> I<00:07:23.759> really
