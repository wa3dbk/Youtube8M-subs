just<00:01:37.830> know<00:01:38.070> that<00:01:38.280> it's<00:01:38.460> a<00:01:38.550> it's<00:01:38.790> a<00:01:38.880> good<00:01:39.090> base

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:39.300 
just know that it's a it's a good base

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:40.780 
just know that it's a it's a good base
if<00:01:39.720> you're<00:01:39.930> looking<00:01:40.230> for<00:01:40.409> something

if you're looking for something

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.219 
if you're looking for something
equivalent<00:01:41.790> maybe<00:01:42.360> a<00:01:42.560> broadcaster<00:01:43.560> base

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
equivalent maybe a broadcaster base

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:48.140 
equivalent maybe a broadcaster base
would<00:01:46.229> be<00:01:46.350> a<00:01:46.380> good<00:01:46.560> example<00:01:46.760> it<00:01:47.760> comes<00:01:47.970> with

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:48.150 
would be a good example it comes with

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.990 
would be a good example it comes with
two<00:01:48.390> TV<00:01:48.659> John's<00:01:49.020> pickups<00:01:49.880> these<00:01:50.880> are
