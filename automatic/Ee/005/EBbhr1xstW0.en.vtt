comes<00:01:01.109> in<00:01:01.289> a<00:01:01.379> case<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:02.309> remove<00:01:03.210> it<00:01:03.359> from<00:01:03.510> space

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
comes in a case and remove it from space

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.250 
comes in a case and remove it from space
you<00:01:05.990> then<00:01:06.990> need<00:01:07.229> to<00:01:07.290> remove<00:01:08.189> this<00:01:08.610> outer

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
protective and cover and i find that can

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.480 
protective and cover and i find that can
be<00:01:14.250> quite<00:01:14.520> hard<00:01:14.850> to<00:01:14.970> do<00:01:15.210> so<00:01:15.900> i<00:01:15.930> use<00:01:16.439> a<00:01:18.439> cuticle

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:19.490 
be quite hard to do so i use a cuticle

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.039 
be quite hard to do so i use a cuticle
tool<00:01:20.490> that<00:01:20.700> i've<00:01:20.790> got<00:01:20.939> a<00:01:20.970> metal<00:01:21.180> cuticle<00:01:21.750> tool

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
tool that i've got a metal cuticle tool

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:27.520 
tool that i've got a metal cuticle tool
which<00:01:22.650> I<00:01:22.830> can<00:01:23.040> just<00:01:23.280> get<00:01:23.580> underneath<00:01:24.830> the<00:01:26.150> five

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
which I can just get underneath the five

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:32.480 
which I can just get underneath the five
you<00:01:28.530> use<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:29.220> cover<00:01:29.840> to<00:01:30.840> remove<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.920> blade<00:01:32.130> at

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
you use the cover to remove the blade at

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.999 
you use the cover to remove the blade at
the<00:01:32.700> end<00:01:32.880> and<00:01:33.329> we'll<00:01:33.659> come<00:01:33.840> back<00:01:33.869> to<00:01:34.170> that<00:01:35.930> so

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:37.009 
the end and we'll come back to that so

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:40.700 
the end and we'll come back to that so
if<00:01:38.009> you<00:01:38.220> use<00:01:38.369> microplane<00:01:39.030> tools<00:01:39.560> in<00:01:40.560> the
