00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.060 
they can possibly do secondly this is

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.600 
they can possibly do secondly this is
just<00:05:30.480> part<00:05:30.810> of<00:05:31.050> being<00:05:31.110> a<00:05:31.440> competitive<00:05:32.250> son<00:05:32.490> of

here<00:05:57.090> here's<00:05:57.480> a<00:05:57.570> question<00:05:57.990> though<00:05:58.320> do<00:05:58.770> you

00:05:58.820 --> 00:05:58.830 
here here's a question though do you

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:00.410 
here here's a question though do you
think<00:05:59.250> he<00:05:59.400> should<00:05:59.430> be<00:05:59.730> allowed<00:05:59.970> to<00:06:00.030> compete

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:00.420 
think he should be allowed to compete

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:02.300 
think he should be allowed to compete
again<00:06:00.720> I<00:06:00.930> don't<00:06:01.680> think<00:06:01.710> he's<00:06:01.950> ever<00:06:02.040> going<00:06:02.220> to

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:02.310 
again I don't think he's ever going to

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:04.190 
again I don't think he's ever going to
compete<00:06:02.550> again<00:06:02.790> anyway<00:06:03.210> I<00:06:03.240> don't<00:06:03.510> think<00:06:04.020> that

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:04.200 
compete again anyway I don't think that

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:06.830 
compete again anyway I don't think that
was<00:06:04.410> I<00:06:04.650> don't<00:06:04.980> think<00:06:05.130> that<00:06:05.220> was<00:06:05.340> a<00:06:05.370> plan<00:06:05.840> but

00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:06.840 
was I don't think that was a plan but

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:09.620 
was I don't think that was a plan but
the<00:06:07.800> real<00:06:07.980> question<00:06:08.220> is<00:06:08.610> does<00:06:08.970> he<00:06:09.120> get<00:06:09.390> his

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:09.630 
the real question is does he get his

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:11.660 
the real question is does he get his
does<00:06:10.140> he<00:06:10.170> get<00:06:10.380> to<00:06:10.470> keep<00:06:10.620> his<00:06:10.770> jerseys<00:06:11.340> and<00:06:11.580> I

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:11.670 
does he get to keep his jerseys and I

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:13.520 
does he get to keep his jerseys and I
guess<00:06:11.820> the<00:06:11.970> answer<00:06:12.120> is<00:06:12.270> no<00:06:12.600> and<00:06:12.900> then<00:06:13.380> it's

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:13.530 
guess the answer is no and then it's

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:17.300 
guess the answer is no and then it's
this<00:06:13.680> kind<00:06:13.890> of<00:06:14.010> thing<00:06:14.330> where<00:06:15.330> it's<00:06:15.540> like<00:06:16.310> it's

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:17.310 
this kind of thing where it's like it's

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:19.040 
this kind of thing where it's like it's
like<00:06:17.370> oj<00:06:17.880> with<00:06:18.030> the<00:06:18.150> heisman<00:06:18.630> they<00:06:18.750> take<00:06:18.930> the
