3rd fret on the open a string and then

3rd fret on the open a string and then
we're<00:00:43.940> going<00:00:44.030> to<00:00:44.150> use<00:00:44.540> frets<00:00:45.290> four<00:00:45.620> and<00:00:45.770> five

going to give us our great funky sound

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.930 
going to give us our great funky sound
because<00:00:52.100> we're<00:00:52.190> going<00:00:52.280> to<00:00:52.370> pick<00:00:52.670> from<00:00:52.760> the<00:00:52.910> E

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
because we're going to pick from the E

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:58.689 
because we're going to pick from the E
and<00:00:53.480> then<00:00:53.960> we<00:00:54.019> going<00:00:54.140> to<00:00:54.199> use<00:00:54.290> this<00:00:57.160> ok<00:00:58.160> and<00:00:58.610> in

00:00:58.689 --> 00:00:58.699 
and then we going to use this ok and in

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:00.130 
and then we going to use this ok and in
a<00:00:58.760> case<00:00:58.910> we're<00:00:59.059> going<00:00:59.089> to<00:00:59.210> use<00:00:59.269> the<00:00:59.480> octave<00:00:59.930> e

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
a case we're going to use the octave e

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.920 
a case we're going to use the octave e
so<00:01:00.559> although<00:01:01.220> it's<00:01:01.670> a<00:01:01.730> different<00:01:02.030> thread<00:01:02.780> and

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:02.930 
so although it's a different thread and

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:04.509 
so although it's a different thread and
different<00:01:03.170> finger<00:01:03.409> if<00:01:03.470> you<00:01:03.530> like<00:01:03.650> it's<00:01:04.220> still

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:04.519 
different finger if you like it's still

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:07.810 
different finger if you like it's still
the<00:01:04.640> same<00:01:04.670> note<00:01:05.120> v<00:01:06.070> on<00:01:07.070> the<00:01:07.159> 7th<00:01:07.460> fret<00:01:07.550> on<00:01:07.640> the<00:01:07.730> a

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:07.820 
the same note v on the 7th fret on the a

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.690 
the same note v on the 7th fret on the a
string<00:01:07.970> that's<00:01:08.360> the<00:01:08.480> octave<00:01:08.900> of<00:01:09.110> the<00:01:09.170> e<00:01:09.700> and

string that's the octave of the e and

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.430 
string that's the octave of the e and
occasionally<00:01:11.180> rather<00:01:11.840> than<00:01:11.900> using<00:01:12.050> this<00:01:12.200> g

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:12.440 
occasionally rather than using this g

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:15.219 
occasionally rather than using this g
down<00:01:12.620> here<00:01:12.860> we<00:01:13.790> can<00:01:13.940> use<00:01:14.090> this<00:01:14.210> g<00:01:14.479> here<00:01:14.720> on<00:01:14.930> the

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:15.229 
down here we can use this g here on the

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:17.920 
down here we can use this g here on the

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
I'm muting all the strings rather than

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.609 
I'm muting all the strings rather than
let<00:01:57.560> them<00:01:57.680> bring<00:01:57.829> out<00:01:57.979> like<00:01:58.130> this<00:01:59.469> ok<00:02:00.469> this

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
let them bring out like this ok this

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:02.410 
let them bring out like this ok this
funk<00:02:00.950> is<00:02:01.070> very<00:02:01.340> often<00:02:01.490> quite<00:02:01.850> short<00:02:02.329> and

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:02.420 
funk is very often quite short and

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.440 
funk is very often quite short and
choppy<00:02:02.689> and<00:02:02.869> bam<00:02:03.350> bang<00:02:04.130> was<00:02:04.549> very<00:02:04.820> precise<00:02:05.179> if

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
choppy and bam bang was very precise if

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.770 
choppy and bam bang was very precise if
you<00:02:05.539> like<00:02:05.689> so<00:02:06.289> let<00:02:06.409> me<00:02:06.439> do<00:02:06.590> that<00:02:07.330> it's<00:02:08.330> really

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
you like so let me do that it's really

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.260 
you like so let me do that it's really
caught<00:02:09.380> really<00:02:09.890> really<00:02:10.070> really<00:02:10.280> cut<00:02:10.880> short

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
caught really really really cut short

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:12.550 
caught really really really cut short
and<00:02:11.390> it<00:02:11.510> gives<00:02:11.660> us<00:02:11.780> that<00:02:11.900> ultimate<00:02:12.320> sort<00:02:12.500> of

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
and it gives us that ultimate sort of

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.800 
and it gives us that ultimate sort of
funky<00:02:12.860> sound<00:02:13.130> so<00:02:13.820> we're<00:02:13.940> going<00:02:14.030> to<00:02:14.120> open<00:02:14.240> a<00:02:14.510> six

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
funky sound so we're going to open a six

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.130 
funky sound so we're going to open a six
string<00:02:15.790> seventh<00:02:16.790> fret<00:02:16.880> on<00:02:17.060> the<00:02:17.180> a<00:02:17.270> and<00:02:17.960> we're

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:18.140 
string seventh fret on the a and we're

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:20.770 
string seventh fret on the a and we're
gonna<00:02:18.260> go<00:02:18.350> four<00:02:18.620> or<00:02:18.650> five<00:02:18.920> mmm<00:02:19.760> so<00:02:20.420> that<00:02:20.540> rift

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
gonna go four or five mmm so that rift

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.180 
gonna go four or five mmm so that rift
together<00:02:21.050> so<00:02:21.350> is<00:02:23.560> what<00:02:24.560> we<00:02:24.680> can<00:02:24.890> do<00:02:25.040> we<00:02:25.160> can

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
together so is what we can do we can

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.380 
together so is what we can do we can
sneak<00:02:25.550> another<00:02:25.730> open<00:02:26.330> e<00:02:26.540> six<00:02:26.870> string<00:02:27.110> in

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
sneak another open e six string in
