00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:14.250
 and this demand tight since 24 for the 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.660
 71st episode of kraft lab in which 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.550
 we will see a system that is located 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.930
 just below this carpet or 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.449
 carpets as you wish them 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.470
 called then I show you this after 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.699
 I will explain it to you because there is 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.960
 a lot of little things to explain you 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.900
 to have it nice enough this little system 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.670
 a sam pixar system that did 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.800
 to fall in hand of cards we take it in 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.230
 full flight and we access directly 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.579
 subway of the lab who who are 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.899
 logically at home too you 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:39.239
 redo the system a stash or 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.920
 others if this system is something 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.800
 which will allow you to access 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.399
 something secret or not brief 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.079
 how does it work well 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.170
 there are rails when you could the 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.270
 see just below this is this this 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.250
 carpet and the same cards there 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.350
 go down can go through everything 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.989
 just this carpet look even 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:02.160
 if we are not in it goes through when 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.539
 even that's his crossing of the coup I'm going 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.129
 you explain it right away in the 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.400
 experience room then bows stark 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.140
 did not explain the system right at 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.909
 top that makes it possible to bring down the 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.680
 graves and the same because I 'm going to you 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.420
 explain that I'm the one who makes them 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.860
 blow a little all his pocket and not so 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.360
 ap ap the compact i do not know you're going 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.680
 tell me we'll see that together 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.509
 just after I explain to you first 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.770
 how to position a little bit 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.280
 carpet and rails just below 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.619
 So here we go 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.210
 home carpet the size that 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.600
 you want so we need 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:37.710
 just 2.3 long hours to 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:40.500
 gone to see here we admit we 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:44.520
 wish it to be here we break the 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.810
 break it to castanet this and we make a 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.479
 sort of stairs simply for 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.640
 position the rails is the brothel 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.770
 here it's really catacombs 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.070
 ok but still pistons game because 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.610
 that they do 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:59.560
 finally I do a little cleaning brief 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:02.410
 we take the reins in fact goes down 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:05.920
 so very important has betrayed this rail 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:07.390
 must must be downward inclined towards 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.770
 the bottom simply thanks to ear 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.300
 that you like right behind like this 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.590
 otherwise he will be like that and well everything 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.390
 just end of mike hart will fall and 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.780
 Well you are going to go stay there it will not 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.300
 go down 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:19.690
 so we go down like these one we 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:23.220
 break theirs right behind a 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:26.470
 small size is needed 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.700
 ok we close everything is small 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.620
 problem what was going on well 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.120
 when we put carpet here 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.100
 do not want to get to that level 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.810
 so there you have you said you're going 

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.830
 you're telling me eh 

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:37.810
 well just simply the 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.340
 put there but no it does not work this 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:42.790
 who will have to do is put 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:45.640
 signs like this hop we close the 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.800
 just like these and it works 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:52.989
 ok ok so does it work if we 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:54.910
 takes a same card a card gim card 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:57.060
 is a little block rails just above 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:00.400
 and has same map 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:03.130
 is not it work it does work 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.660
 not what happens, it does not work 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.730
 not just because I did not 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.950
 not activate the radios that had small 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.420
 fake excuse me we activate it all 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:13.510
 just like these and we do in 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:16.870
 kind of go where you want there we go 

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.890
 to make them go in the super water that is 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.420
 what I did by a hand is not 

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:24.010
 possible it's not red stone 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:25.600
 is they see there ok we're hiring at 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:31.810
 all and we do the same thing again and there 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:33.070
 normally it works nickel which he 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.760
 goes off the same map and they fall 

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:35.560
 in the water 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.690
 ok now i'm going to explain the 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.700
 system just above ok ok my 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.170
 inventory is operational for you 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:43.269
 explain this small portion of the 

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.510
 system that will allow to do 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:47.829
 drop the same card like these hop 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:50.140
 this is the desired place at the 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:52.780
 system and it's directly sent 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:54.280
 in the secret passage then as you 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.290
 know i guess it comes it takes a 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.519
 rail in front of a dispensary to do 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.880
 to get out of the right cards if you do not 

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:02.080
 do not go out the same cards and the 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.760
 problem is that 

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.650
 have to remove this block so that the same 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.260
 because falls and if we remove this blog is 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.520
 well would be will and breaks and so he 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.140
 will have to make a system that will 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:13.240
 to make sure that this rail 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:15.930
 be safe from here 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:17.680
 while that piston and retract then 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:21.130
 reactionary I explain to you 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.780
 quickly watch if we take that off 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:25.270
 will press the button 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.470
 and what happens is the rail and 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:29.980
 pushed before this blog 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:32.080
 and suddenly the block is still retract 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:33.340
 while the rail is only at its all 

00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:35.590
 simply because there is no longer 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.060
 nothing was more support so this 

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:39.010
 who will have to do is to do 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.590
 so that this piston reactivates very 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:43.780
 quickly so that the rail can 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:46.420
 reposition to its original state of the shot 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.980
 I added this little little boost 

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:49.690
 end of system that I will explain 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:52.090
 finally that I'm going to show you just 

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:53.220
 after romel wright who broke and there 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:56.320
 It works very well 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:58.600
 ok ok so how does it work from 

00:04:56.320 --> 00:05:00.940
 the beginning I explained I you 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:03.220
 explain the end we'll say ok then we 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:04.870
 activate the system here in the first place the 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.570
 red stone will activate the dispatcher so 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:09.550
 will issue the same card 

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:11.919
 then secondly it's going to go here 

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:14.200
 it will retract this rail to put it 

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:17.290
 safe thanks to a peter reee who 

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:19.570
 is placed at the second big and in 3 the 

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:21.010
 third phase of this system it will be this 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:24.040
 repeater goes to the fourth big so 

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:26.230
 which is the most this piston is the last 

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:27.580
 act iv two of his three years end of these 

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:30.580
 three objects say the 10 weeks 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:32.410
 would be the pistons hockey went 

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:34.180
 retracted and then it took them 

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:36.190
 activate it very quickly just 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:39.150
 after thanks to another repeater placed at 

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:41.740
 4th rank which reacts directly 

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:43.180
 to which I think I've explained everything 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:44.169
 so I wonder if this is what 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:45.430
 that I will explain it to you in the 

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:47.470
 experience room is what it is 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:48.820
 useful I think nothing and I you 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:51.250
 so explain it so if I you 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:53.350
 leave that way it's pretty simple to 

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:54.460
 reproduce ok I think it was a 

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:55.570
 little bit of nothing I'm doing it 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:57.820
 in the experiment room knowing that 

00:05:55.570 --> 00:05:59.110
 I explained it directly as 

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:59.560
 that I was not going to explain it as much 

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:01.180
 anyway 

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:03.330
 ok we end up for the next 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:05.039
 episode I leave you this 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:07.590
 this little picture so that you 

00:06:05.039 --> 00:06:09.240
 can reproduce it and me I you 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:12.949
 give an appointment next Saturday at 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:12.949
 dakar has accelerated the season
