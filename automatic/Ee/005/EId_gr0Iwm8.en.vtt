00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.320 
switch here and you just want to verify
that<00:02:38.380> there's<00:02:38.769> no<00:02:38.920> wires<00:02:39.220> in<00:02:39.550> the<00:02:39.670> way<00:02:39.850> this

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
that there's no wires in the way this

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.170 
that there's no wires in the way this
antenna<00:02:40.750> wire<00:02:40.989> is<00:02:41.290> in<00:02:41.560> the<00:02:41.650> way<00:02:41.739> on<00:02:41.769> mine<00:02:42.180> and

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:43.180 
antenna wire is in the way on mine and

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.420 
antenna wire is in the way on mine and
so<00:02:43.660> you<00:02:43.720> want<00:02:43.930> to<00:02:43.989> get<00:02:44.110> that<00:02:44.290> that<00:02:44.920> gray

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
so you want to get that that gray

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.120 
so you want to get that that gray
antenna<00:02:45.970> wire<00:02:46.209> below<00:02:46.989> the<00:02:47.230> switch<00:02:48.090> and<00:02:49.090> now

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
antenna wire below the switch and now

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.720 
antenna wire below the switch and now
you<00:02:51.130> want<00:02:51.310> to<00:02:51.660> also<00:02:52.660> as<00:02:53.260> you<00:02:54.130> start<00:02:54.400> to<00:02:54.519> rotate

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
you want to also as you start to rotate

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.759 
you want to also as you start to rotate
the<00:02:55.090> switch<00:02:55.360> we're<00:02:55.630> going<00:02:55.750> to<00:02:55.810> rotate<00:02:55.959> it<00:02:56.140> 180

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:56.769 
the switch we're going to rotate it 180

00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:59.850 
the switch we're going to rotate it 180
degrees<00:02:56.860> you<00:02:57.660> want<00:02:58.660> to<00:02:58.840> make<00:02:58.989> sure<00:02:59.620> this

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
degrees you want to make sure this

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.590 
degrees you want to make sure this
orange<00:03:00.459> wire<00:03:00.670> that's<00:03:00.910> attached<00:03:01.239> to<00:03:01.269> the

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
orange wire that's attached to the

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.870 
orange wire that's attached to the
switch<00:03:01.900> has<00:03:02.769> enough<00:03:03.070> play<00:03:03.850> in<00:03:04.060> it<00:03:04.209> to<00:03:04.780> rotate

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
switch has enough play in it to rotate

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:07.800 
switch has enough play in it to rotate
with<00:03:06.880> the<00:03:07.060> switch<00:03:07.329> so<00:03:07.570> you're<00:03:07.720> gonna

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:07.810 
with the switch so you're gonna

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:11.550 
with the switch so you're gonna
basically<00:03:08.440> bring<00:03:09.040> up<00:03:09.190> the<00:03:09.310> slack<00:03:10.200> that's<00:03:11.200> all

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
basically bring up the slack that's all

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.710 
basically bring up the slack that's all
down<00:03:11.920> through<00:03:12.310> this<00:03:12.459> case<00:03:12.790> of<00:03:13.120> that<00:03:13.299> orange

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:13.720 
down through this case of that orange

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.380 
down through this case of that orange
cable<00:03:14.049> orange<00:03:14.890> wiring<00:03:15.489> we're<00:03:16.150> basically

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
cable orange wiring we're basically

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:17.910 
cable orange wiring we're basically
going<00:03:16.660> to<00:03:16.780> gather<00:03:16.989> up<00:03:17.260> some<00:03:17.290> of<00:03:17.560> that<00:03:17.590> slack

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:17.920 
going to gather up some of that slack

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.110 
going to gather up some of that slack
and<00:03:18.840> allowing<00:03:19.840> you<00:03:19.959> to<00:03:20.170> rotate<00:03:20.440> the<00:03:20.769> switch

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:21.120 
and allowing you to rotate the switch

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.990 
and allowing you to rotate the switch
without<00:03:22.120> putting<00:03:22.510> any<00:03:22.750> stresses<00:03:23.260> on<00:03:23.799> that<00:03:24.250> on

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
without putting any stresses on that on

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.300 
without putting any stresses on that on
that<00:03:25.060> orange<00:03:25.690> cable<00:03:26.019> so<00:03:26.560> now<00:03:26.739> it's<00:03:26.890> rotated

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.310 
that orange cable so now it's rotated

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:33.600 
that orange cable so now it's rotated
180<00:03:27.760> degrees<00:03:28.350> we're<00:03:29.350> done<00:03:32.250> just<00:03:33.250> got<00:03:33.370> to<00:03:33.459> close

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
180 degrees we're done just got to close

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.039 
180 degrees we're done just got to close
it<00:03:33.670> up<00:03:33.880> now<00:03:34.230> and<00:03:35.230> get<00:03:36.100> that<00:03:36.130> yellow<00:03:36.610> and<00:03:36.760> red

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
it up now and get that yellow and red

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:41.310 
it up now and get that yellow and red
wire<00:03:38.049> slip<00:03:39.040> back<00:03:39.519> into<00:03:40.360> that<00:03:40.540> position<00:03:41.049> it<00:03:41.170> was

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.320 
wire slip back into that position it was

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.190 
wire slip back into that position it was
when<00:03:41.530> I<00:03:41.560> opened<00:03:41.620> it<00:03:42.630> basically<00:03:43.630> so<00:03:43.900> it<00:03:43.989> won't

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
when I opened it basically so it won't

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.900 
when I opened it basically so it won't
get<00:03:44.739> pinched<00:03:45.160> when<00:03:45.340> I<00:03:45.370> close<00:03:45.700> the<00:03:45.730> case

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:48.910 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:04:08.679 

close<00:03:49.910> it<00:03:50.090> up<00:03:55.210> squeeze<00:03:56.210> back<00:03:56.480> in<00:03:56.510> place
