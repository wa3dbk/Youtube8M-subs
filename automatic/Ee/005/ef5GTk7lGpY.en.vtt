00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
so I can also curl it which I think I am

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.810 
so I can also curl it which I think I am
going<00:00:31.500> to<00:00:31.590> curl<00:00:31.830> it<00:00:32.009> back<00:00:32.040> just<00:00:32.369> a<00:00:32.550> little<00:00:32.610> bit

same<00:01:02.550> area<00:01:02.940> on<00:01:03.239> the<00:01:03.690> monofilament<00:01:04.140> clipped<00:01:04.769> it

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
same area on the monofilament clipped it

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.570 
same area on the monofilament clipped it
in<00:01:05.869> then<00:01:06.869> because<00:01:07.409> this<00:01:07.530> was<00:01:07.770> still<00:01:08.100> very<00:01:08.340> very

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.070 
said I am going to curl these sides
where<00:02:54.370> they<00:02:54.550> go<00:02:54.700> back<00:02:55.030> again<00:02:55.480> instead<00:02:55.930> of

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
where they go back again instead of

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.620 
where they go back again instead of
swinging<00:02:56.709> forward<00:02:57.190> because<00:02:57.640> I<00:02:57.760> don't<00:02:58.000> like<00:02:58.420> to

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
swinging forward because I don't like to

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.520

it's brand new so and I've never had a
Henry<00:03:17.020> Margo<00:03:17.560> wigs<00:03:18.040> so<00:03:18.610> maybe<00:03:19.060> that<00:03:19.780> it'll<00:03:20.440> be

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
Henry Margo wigs so maybe that it'll be

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.110 
Henry Margo wigs so maybe that it'll be
fun<00:03:20.830> I<00:03:21.010> don't<00:03:21.190> know<00:03:21.310> let's<00:03:21.519> see<00:03:21.640> what<00:03:21.790> happens

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
fun I don't know let's see what happens

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.479 
fun I don't know let's see what happens
and<00:03:22.300> myself<00:03:22.450> some<00:03:22.870> of<00:03:22.989> my<00:03:23.140> wigs<00:03:23.350> I<00:03:23.650> will<00:03:24.280> always

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
and myself some of my wigs I will always

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:27.150 
and myself some of my wigs I will always
have<00:03:25.060> wigs<00:03:25.420> but<00:03:25.690> I<00:03:25.750> found<00:03:26.290> a<00:03:26.500> reasonably

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.160 
have wigs but I found a reasonably

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:30.930 
have wigs but I found a reasonably
priced<00:03:27.459> topper<00:03:28.170> that<00:03:29.170> I<00:03:29.620> can<00:03:29.980> manipulate<00:03:30.280> it

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
priced topper that I can manipulate it

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.820 
priced topper that I can manipulate it
feels<00:03:31.209> pretty<00:03:31.480> secure<00:03:31.959> and<00:03:32.080> more<00:03:32.170> secure<00:03:32.620> if

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830 
feels pretty secure and more secure if

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.120 
feels pretty secure and more secure if
the<00:03:33.340> base<00:03:33.550> is<00:03:33.820> a<00:03:33.850> little<00:03:33.970> smaller<00:03:34.600> than<00:03:35.130> the

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 
the base is a little smaller than the

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:39.000 
the base is a little smaller than the
one<00:03:36.310> was<00:03:36.790> on<00:03:37.360> how<00:03:37.989> maybe<00:03:38.260> at<00:03:38.440> what<00:03:38.620> maybe<00:03:38.800> it

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
one was on how maybe at what maybe it

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:41.340 
one was on how maybe at what maybe it
didn't<00:03:39.280> maybe<00:03:39.580> it<00:03:39.850> is<00:03:40.120> a<00:03:40.420> little<00:03:40.690> longer<00:03:40.870> but

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:41.350 
didn't maybe it is a little longer but

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.160 
didn't maybe it is a little longer but
it's<00:03:41.560> squared<00:03:42.010> off<00:03:42.390> where<00:03:43.390> this<00:03:43.600> is<00:03:43.840> the<00:03:44.019> old

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:44.170 
it's squared off where this is the old

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:45.720 
it's squared off where this is the old
Raquel<00:03:44.620> Welch<00:03:44.860> from<00:03:45.040> but<00:03:45.190> it's<00:03:45.310> basically

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
Raquel Welch from but it's basically

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.259 
Raquel Welch from but it's basically
looks<00:03:46.060> the<00:03:46.209> same<00:03:46.420> on<00:03:46.660> the<00:03:46.780> inside<00:03:47.790> so<00:03:48.790> anyway<00:03:49.090> I

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:49.269 
looks the same on the inside so anyway I

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:51.080 
looks the same on the inside so anyway I
wanted<00:03:49.780> to<00:03:49.840> show<00:03:49.989> you<00:03:50.200> that<00:03:50.350> tell<00:03:50.920> you<00:03:51.040> that

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
wanted to show you that tell you that

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.580 
wanted to show you that tell you that
tell<00:03:52.090> you<00:03:52.390> that<00:03:52.420> any<00:03:52.900> of<00:03:53.080> you<00:03:53.260> are<00:03:53.290> having<00:03:54.209> the

tell you that any of you are having the
thinning<00:03:56.590> issue<00:03:56.739> on<00:03:57.040> top<00:03:57.310> of<00:03:57.459> it<00:03:57.550> still<00:03:57.820> have

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
thinning issue on top of it still have

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:59.240 
thinning issue on top of it still have
long<00:03:58.120> hair<00:03:58.360> on<00:03:58.450> the<00:03:58.570> bottom

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
long hair on the bottom

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:01.590 
long hair on the bottom
look<00:04:00.250> at<00:04:00.340> these<00:04:00.459> easy<00:04:00.700> parts<00:04:01.120> they're<00:04:01.360> made<00:04:01.570> by

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:01.600 
look at these easy parts they're made by

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.780 
look at these easy parts they're made by
easy<00:04:01.989> hair<00:04:02.410> and<00:04:02.650> they<00:04:03.010> also<00:04:03.190> have<00:04:03.550> them<00:04:03.760> in

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
easy hair and they also have them in

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:05.729 
easy hair and they also have them in
human<00:04:04.269> here<00:04:04.600> I<00:04:04.750> guess<00:04:05.170> it's<00:04:05.410> going<00:04:05.530> to<00:04:05.590> be

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739
