00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.060
 Hello dear spectators welcome to 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:07.560
 another consequence is incredible trains 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.849
 and this time a different mood 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.090
 on the board might otherwise 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.400
 know an endgame 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:17.490
 and you think what can be this 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.350
 incredible train arrived but be 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:24.269
 really a beautiful idea here 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:28.710
 by anatoly karpov in wm match against 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.939
 Kasparov yes many of you will be the 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.360
 maybe already knows trunks 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:36.420
 relatively well-known black just on h4 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:40.350
 beaten and you will probably already 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:45.120
 The cape did not open again 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:46.890
 you if you want you can still here 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:51.449
 take a look inside but I will 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:53.520
 they show yes if white here again 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:57.149
 should beat then the disturbance 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.910
 relatively closed and although so many 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:02.879
 Farmers on white are the black runners 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:05.970
 can keep everything covered and knows 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.260
 no right route for his king 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.270
 year's main problems king has 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.979
 actually only a route over f5 but 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.310
 this field he will be from the runs 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:17.520
 controlled and black becomes one 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:21.090
 got a fortress and therefore played 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:24.479
 here in this position 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:27.060
 karpov springer g2 sacrifices temporarily 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:30.710
 a farmer to create more space 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:34.049
 It can be incredibly strong 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.860
 jaha beats three with the build here 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.250
 pull over 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.079
 that will not help in the long run either 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:42.450
 he jumped four and now would be the 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:45.930
 build on a 5 still get lost and then 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:48.540
 also the construction v 3 was later that is 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.940
 not good for black 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:55.260
 So Herr staeck beats the three king 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:56.640
 the 3 and now he's going to have it 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:01.080
 It was also lost quite fast 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:03.420
 actually also clear and in consequence 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:07.220
 is here now white with the king 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.220
 intrusion has wonderful profit opportunities 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.670
 the four and now we see here now 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.080
 it was just important that there these farmers 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.060
 do not stand in the way because now the king 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:21.150
 can penetrate this route here 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:23.790
 wonderful and what I already here 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.290
 forced to sacrifice farmers and me 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.480
 faith even had my draw 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.630
 opportunity later but it was very 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.430
 hard to defend and capped with 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:35.100
 this farmer's sacrifice we at the beginning 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.470
 have seen great pressure on castorf 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:40.140
 and finally could 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.580
 who won the example 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.770
 Please write us in the comments 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.670
 I would be happy and see you soon 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.670
 again, it's good
