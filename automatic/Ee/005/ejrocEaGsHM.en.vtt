00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:04.680
 they have two walls 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:10.940
 the obstacles all lightness of naming 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:15.789
 sometimes the feeling of being mixed up 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.789
 tracer made famous magazine 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:21.300
 the course 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.060
 with a cac in the image a jean tourangeau 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.789
 grenet 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:29.029
 do not know this precision point of 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:31.369
 As they come out, I will reply that the 

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:34.730
 midfoot a point of several 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:37.280
 novels today still only gives 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.620
 advice but next september he 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.970
 will teach the course more than ten years 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:42.920
 of practice to his credit 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.360
 when we're kids we roll we do 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.280
 save sidewalk we jump on the banks 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.650
 subconsciously then I grew up 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.600
 in the countryside I started to climb 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.620
 in the very young trees I am 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.390
 move from one tree to another in 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.040
 forests so the course we mean 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.809
 I started and 11 in what a 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.269
 dangerous discipline at first glance and 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:02.780
 yet any obstacle any course is 

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:03.739
 spotted in advance we will rub 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:05.269
 shoes to see if they are not 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:06.860
 wet we go side wall province they 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:09.110
 do not say we think before jumping 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.659
 sometimes even a jump it'll take six 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.380
 month a year to prepare and in the head 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:14.390
 and in the body 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.580
 1 it's really a sport 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.350
 who reflects who is not unconscious 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.220
 it's been ten years since I practice 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.560
 know no lower is that a 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.470
 footballer provided to train 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.750
 bodybuilding and endurance are 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.759
 needed this sport is still little 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.039
 practiced in a touraine but his followers 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:33.289
 no one pumping thanks especially to 

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:34.609
 the zero gravity association I can 

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:37.189
 to really do when I want it is not 

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:38.329
 something that is fixed I have not 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:40.219
 need to have a wise and not need 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:43.009
 to have a schedule just one 

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:45.920
 word freedom here is pushed back his 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:48.740
 limits we'll say we're always going 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:52.670
 seek to do more in Ukraine I have 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:54.259
 started moving in 2003 so I believe 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.530
 I came here to move with the 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:02:01.170
 guy with castrated ml with 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:03.090
 with French braiders the course 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.790
 a sport that adapts to all levels 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.950
 we start small and we finish at but 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:11.540
 for this it takes years of practice 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.540
 and a good self-confidence
