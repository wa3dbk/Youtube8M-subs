00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:10.450
 do not 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:25.930
 what room will we enter this day and 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.930
 what kind of music are we going to play today 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.130
 for being such 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.130
 soft 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:37.520
 what are the instruments that touch 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:40.070
 soft sounds and which sound sounds 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:42.850
 strong if the wall of knowing can 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.850
 tell us more 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:01:00.590
 it's a cubes 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.770
 there are many kinds of instruments 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.770
 musicals 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:12.810
 first there are the instruments in the 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.810
 that they have to blow the trumpet 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.120
 or can play a clarinet 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:30.200
 and to play other instruments they use 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.200
 fingers nails and hands 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:41.010
 a weapon has many ropes that make 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.010
 different sounds 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.710
 the guitar has fewer strings 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:55.710
 and they understood each other very well 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:59.960
 Attention 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.960
 there are instruments that hit each other 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:07.659
 two 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.659
 or so or so 

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:12.840
 with them they can make a scandal 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.310
 one Love 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:23.709
 two 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.709
 or touch them without making a lot of noise 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:33.520
 depends on how strong that is, talk about 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.520
 it depends on how hard you hit 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.990
 it depends on how hard they touch 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:48.689
 it depends on how hard you hit 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:52.189
 each other but what matters is that 

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:52.189
 enjoy what all 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:05.780

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:25.640

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:30.849
