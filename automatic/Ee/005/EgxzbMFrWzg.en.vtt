on<00:01:57.369> that<00:01:57.759> way<00:01:57.940> that<00:01:58.180> it<00:01:58.300> takes<00:01:58.509> longer<00:01:58.810> to<00:01:59.020> boot

00:01:59.190 --> 00:01:59.200 
on that way that it takes longer to boot

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.440 
on that way that it takes longer to boot

boots<00:02:01.960> very<00:02:02.229> quickly<00:02:02.560> much<00:02:02.979> like<00:02:03.340> the

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
boots very quickly much like the

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:10.109 
boots very quickly much like the
BlackBerry<00:02:04.150> does<00:02:05.729> so<00:02:08.190> to<00:02:09.190> fully<00:02:09.459> power<00:02:09.789> off

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:16.420 
the other way this won't work so you

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.979 
the other way this won't work so you
have<00:02:16.480> to<00:02:16.630> pull<00:02:16.810> the<00:02:16.930> battery<00:02:18.600> put<00:02:19.600> the<00:02:19.690> battery
