 Hi, how are you today? 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.490
 what is the key to the service of 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:13.490
 werkÃ©n chemistry 

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:21.520
 ever happened to them that they felt that their 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:23.560
 hair needed something and they did not know what 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:25.419
 and when they got to the living room they did not know 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.970
 what to ask for good is why it is so 

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:30.640
 important the diagnosis today I'm going to 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.860
 show a super simple super type 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.870
 fast you can do at home to 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:38.449
 perform that first diagnosis 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.829
 let's take a strand of hair what 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:42.590
 we go down because between the fingers with the 

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:44.960
 We will stretch the thumb and forefinger 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.960
 this way we're going to hold it like this 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.030
 10 seconds and then we 'll release it if 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.879
 when releasing the strand it returns to its shape 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.800
 original the hair is healthy and the 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:56.870
 ideal option would be a service that 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.160
 help keep it that way and give it more 

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.320
 brightness 

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.210
 if the hair is left on the thread 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.250
 with curl it means that you need 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.350
 hydration so the ideal is 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.300
 perform a service that the door 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.310
 humidification that will also leave you 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.940
 much softer hair with shine 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.220
 intense and control of frizz 

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.810
 and if while thinking about lass this one 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.570
 split in two means that you 

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:21.370
 hair is damaged and obviously very 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.470
