it's<00:01:11.200> really<00:01:11.890> important<00:01:12.610> to<00:01:12.869> know<00:01:13.869> that<00:01:14.500> this

00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:15.009 
it's really important to know that this

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:18.210 
it's really important to know that this
procedure<00:01:15.430> this<00:01:16.240> very<00:01:16.479> conflict<00:01:17.050> a<00:01:17.220> complex

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:18.220 
procedure this very conflict a complex

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.969 
procedure this very conflict a complex
and<00:01:18.490> complicated<00:01:18.700> procedure<00:01:19.270> should<00:01:20.110> be<00:01:20.380> done

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:20.979 
and complicated procedure should be done

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:24.060 
and complicated procedure should be done
using<00:01:21.640> local<00:01:22.119> anesthesia<00:01:22.630> only<00:01:23.259> that's<00:01:23.770> the

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 
using local anesthesia only that's the

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.630 
using local anesthesia only that's the
safest<00:01:24.549> approach<00:01:24.790> I<00:01:25.860> there<00:01:26.860> are<00:01:27.100> several

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
safest approach I there are several

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.789 
safest approach I there are several
places<00:01:27.820> that<00:01:28.210> use<00:01:28.390> general<00:01:28.869> anesthesia<00:01:29.200> and

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:29.799 
places that use general anesthesia and

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:33.330 
places that use general anesthesia and
quite<00:01:30.580> frankly<00:01:30.610> the<00:01:31.259> biggest<00:01:32.259> risk<00:01:32.619> that

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
quite frankly the biggest risk that

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.039 
quite frankly the biggest risk that
comes<00:01:33.610> with<00:01:34.270> these<00:01:34.540> types<00:01:34.750> of<00:01:34.900> procedures

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:35.049 
comes with these types of procedures

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:37.830 
comes with these types of procedures
with<00:01:35.890> any<00:01:36.040> kind<00:01:36.250> of<00:01:36.400> invasive<00:01:37.240> procedure<00:01:37.570> is

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
with any kind of invasive procedure is

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.749 
with any kind of invasive procedure is
the<00:01:37.960> anesthesia<00:01:38.439> you<00:01:38.979> know<00:01:39.100> going<00:01:39.400> into

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:39.759 
the anesthesia you know going into

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:41.940 
the anesthesia you know going into
anesthesia<00:01:40.150> coming<00:01:40.780> out<00:01:40.900> of<00:01:40.930> anesthesia<00:01:41.380> so

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
anesthesia coming out of anesthesia so

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.130 
anesthesia coming out of anesthesia so
if<00:01:42.159> something<00:01:43.060> can<00:01:43.180> be<00:01:43.299> done<00:01:43.329> using<00:01:43.659> local

if something can be done using local

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.950 
if something can be done using local
anesthetic<00:01:44.939> successfully<00:01:45.939> that's<00:01:46.600> a<00:01:46.750> real

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
anesthetic successfully that's a real

again<00:02:33.800> I've<00:02:34.010> mentioned<00:02:34.280> previously<00:02:35.240> that<00:02:35.600> if

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
again I've mentioned previously that if

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.700 
again I've mentioned previously that if
you<00:02:36.530> use<00:02:36.890> things<00:02:37.850> such<00:02:38.090> as<00:02:38.200> x-ray<00:02:39.200> you're

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:39.710 
you use things such as x-ray you're

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:41.500 
you use things such as x-ray you're
you're<00:02:40.040> dealing<00:02:40.370> with<00:02:40.400> harmful<00:02:40.790> radiation

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:41.510 
you're dealing with harmful radiation

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.950 
you're dealing with harmful radiation
you<00:02:42.350> also<00:02:42.860> aren't<00:02:43.130> getting<00:02:43.490> a<00:02:43.610> real<00:02:43.910> time<00:02:44.270> look

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:44.960 
you also aren't getting a real time look

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:48.310 
you also aren't getting a real time look
at<00:02:45.290> the<00:02:46.130> area<00:02:46.760> that<00:02:47.030> needs<00:02:47.210> to<00:02:47.420> be<00:02:47.540> treated<00:02:47.810> so
