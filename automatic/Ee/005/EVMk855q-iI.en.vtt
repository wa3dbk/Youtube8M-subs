it's<00:00:01.350> now<00:00:01.560> time<00:00:01.620> to<00:00:02.129> write<00:00:02.429> the<00:00:02.580> discussion

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
it's now time to write the discussion

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.970 
it's now time to write the discussion
and<00:00:04.190> inversely<00:00:05.190> to<00:00:05.580> the<00:00:05.850> introduction<00:00:06.660> the

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:06.980 
and inversely to the introduction the

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.150 
and inversely to the introduction the
discussion<00:00:07.980> starts<00:00:08.429> very<00:00:09.330> specific<00:00:10.019> and<00:00:10.290> just

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:11.160 
discussion starts very specific and just

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.789 
discussion starts very specific and just
like<00:00:11.309> an<00:00:11.429> inverted<00:00:11.820> funnel<00:00:12.300> becomes<00:00:13.290> more<00:00:13.650> and

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
like an inverted funnel becomes more and

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.939 
like an inverted funnel becomes more and
more<00:00:13.860> general<00:00:14.429> as<00:00:15.210> you<00:00:15.269> write<00:00:15.660> it<00:00:15.830> so<00:00:16.830> as<00:00:16.890> you

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
more general as you write it so as you

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.730 
more general as you write it so as you
can<00:00:17.070> see<00:00:17.130> in<00:00:17.340> the<00:00:17.400> diagram<00:00:17.550> here<00:00:18.240> we<00:00:18.750> start<00:00:19.500> our

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
can see in the diagram here we start our

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.480 
can see in the diagram here we start our
discussion<00:00:20.490> by<00:00:20.880> restating<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.720> aim<00:00:21.900> and

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:22.490 
discussion by restating the aim and

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:25.519 
discussion by restating the aim and
suggesting<00:00:23.490> whether<00:00:23.640> our<00:00:23.900> hypothesis<00:00:24.900> were

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
suggesting whether our hypothesis were

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.370 
suggesting whether our hypothesis were
supported<00:00:26.220> or<00:00:26.340> not<00:00:26.660> we<00:00:27.660> will<00:00:27.779> then<00:00:28.019> try<00:00:28.320> to

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
supported or not we will then try to

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.370 
supported or not we will then try to
explain<00:00:29.010> that<00:00:29.279> or<00:00:29.570> link<00:00:30.570> it<00:00:30.720> up<00:00:30.869> with<00:00:31.109> other

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
explain that or link it up with other

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.440 
explain that or link it up with other
research<00:00:32.719> and<00:00:33.719> then<00:00:34.610> try<00:00:35.610> and<00:00:35.790> provide<00:00:36.120> as<00:00:36.329> it

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
research and then try and provide as it

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.060 
research and then try and provide as it
says<00:00:36.630> there<00:00:36.870> are<00:00:37.079> a<00:00:37.110> context<00:00:38.210> any<00:00:39.210> other

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.070 
says there are a context any other

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.549 
says there are a context any other
places<00:00:41.070> it<00:00:41.340> can<00:00:41.399> be<00:00:41.550> taken<00:00:41.940> any<00:00:42.149> other

00:00:42.549 --> 00:00:42.559 
places it can be taken any other

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:46.040 
places it can be taken any other
investigations<00:00:43.559> that<00:00:43.710> can<00:00:43.890> be<00:00:44.010> made<00:00:44.840> so<00:00:45.840> if<00:00:45.930> we

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
investigations that can be made so if we

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.310 
investigations that can be made so if we
have<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:46.260> look<00:00:46.469> at<00:00:47.390> my<00:00:48.390> discussion<00:00:48.930> here<00:00:49.289> I

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
have a look at my discussion here I

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.040 
have a look at my discussion here I
started<00:00:49.950> with<00:00:50.660> restating<00:00:51.660> what<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.899> two

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
started with restating what the two

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.860 
started with restating what the two
hypothesis<00:00:52.770> were<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:53.340> then<00:00:54.239> suggesting

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
hypothesis were and then suggesting

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.770 
hypothesis were and then suggesting
whether<00:00:55.079> they<00:00:55.350> were<00:00:56.309> in<00:00:56.489> fact<00:00:56.730> supported<00:00:57.480> or

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
whether they were in fact supported or

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:05.870 
whether they were in fact supported or
not<00:00:58.079> I<00:00:59.660> try<00:01:00.660> to<00:01:00.719> justify<00:01:01.109> it<00:01:01.379> here<00:01:02.809> and<00:01:04.790> then<00:01:05.790> I

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
not I try to justify it here and then I

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.410 
not I try to justify it here and then I
try<00:01:06.210> to<00:01:07.700> investigate<00:01:08.700> what<00:01:09.090> we've<00:01:09.240> actually

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
try to investigate what we've actually

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.520 
try to investigate what we've actually
found<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.229> thrash<00:01:10.470> it<00:01:10.619> out<00:01:10.740> a<00:01:10.770> bit<00:01:10.890> more<00:01:11.240> so

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
found and thrash it out a bit more so

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.130 
found and thrash it out a bit more so
looking<00:01:13.530> at<00:01:13.830> some<00:01:14.070> of<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.250> data<00:01:14.490> here<00:01:15.140> I've

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
looking at some of the data here I've

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.469 
looking at some of the data here I've
discussed<00:01:16.680> its<00:01:16.950> relevance<00:01:17.729> and<00:01:18.119> any

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
discussed its relevance and any

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.749 
discussed its relevance and any
interesting<00:01:19.049> bits<00:01:19.290> that<00:01:19.560> we<00:01:19.740> found<00:01:20.009> sort<00:01:20.729> of

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
interesting bits that we found sort of

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.320 
interesting bits that we found sort of
conducting<00:01:21.210> an<00:01:21.299> analysis<00:01:21.509> there<00:01:23.330> anything

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
conducting an analysis there anything

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:32.569 
conducting an analysis there anything
that<00:01:25.430> might<00:01:27.049> have<00:01:28.640> corrupted<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.880> results<00:01:31.579> or

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
that might have corrupted the results or

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.080 
that might have corrupted the results or
anything<00:01:32.970> that<00:01:33.180> has<00:01:33.540> been<00:01:33.840> of<00:01:34.049> interest

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
anything that has been of interest

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.609 
anything that has been of interest
should<00:01:36.090> point<00:01:36.479> it<00:01:36.600> out<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:36.780> I've<00:01:37.110> mentioned

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
should point it out and I've mentioned

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.460 
should point it out and I've mentioned
here<00:01:37.950> a<00:01:38.240> suggestion<00:01:39.240> for<00:01:39.600> an<00:01:39.720> extension<00:01:40.140> of

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
here a suggestion for an extension of

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:47.230 
here a suggestion for an extension of
this<00:01:40.950> experiment<00:01:41.670> and<00:01:44.600> again<00:01:45.600> ending<00:01:46.140> here

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
this experiment and again ending here

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.270 
this experiment and again ending here
I've<00:01:48.240> restated<00:01:49.430> the<00:01:50.430> hypothesis<00:01:51.180> and

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
I've restated the hypothesis and

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.760 
I've restated the hypothesis and
suggested<00:01:53.280> whether<00:01:53.670> or<00:01:53.850> not<00:01:53.939> it<00:01:54.149> has<00:01:54.360> been

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
suggested whether or not it has been

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.819 
suggested whether or not it has been
supported<00:01:56.810> what<00:01:57.810> I<00:01:57.840> haven't<00:01:58.380> done<00:01:58.530> in<00:01:58.710> the

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
supported what I haven't done in the

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.260 
supported what I haven't done in the
discussion<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.460> which<00:01:59.579> I<00:01:59.729> should<00:01:59.939> have<00:01:59.969> done

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
discussion and which I should have done

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.230 
discussion and which I should have done
is<00:02:00.619> linked<00:02:01.619> it<00:02:01.710> to<00:02:01.829> other<00:02:01.979> research<00:02:02.430> there

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
is linked it to other research there

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.940 
is linked it to other research there
should<00:02:03.450> be<00:02:03.600> a<00:02:03.630> whole<00:02:03.840> heap<00:02:04.049> of<00:02:04.170> references<00:02:04.770> in
