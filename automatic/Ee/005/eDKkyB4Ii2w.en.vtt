the case now windows seven does indeed I
can<00:00:35.550> testify<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.210> this<00:00:36.510> it<00:00:37.469> boots<00:00:37.739> much

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
can testify to this it boots much

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.069 
can testify to this it boots much
quicker<00:00:38.280> than<00:00:38.489> Windows<00:00:39.359> Vista<00:00:39.539> but<00:00:39.899> look

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
quicker than Windows Vista but look

of times they come shipped with what we

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.970 
of times they come shipped with what we
call<00:01:23.520> trial<00:01:24.030> where<00:01:24.330> I<00:01:24.570> refer<00:01:25.260> to<00:01:25.290> it<00:01:25.560> as<00:01:25.680> crap

we're so does a lot of other people and
again<00:01:29.460> this<00:01:29.700> can<00:01:29.910> be<00:01:30.060> running<00:01:30.390> as<00:01:30.510> a<00:01:30.540> process

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:31.230 
again this can be running as a process

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.080 
again this can be running as a process
in<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.650> background<00:01:32.190> on<00:01:32.400> your<00:01:32.610> computer

there's a free tool called d crap a fire
that<00:01:36.150> you<00:01:36.600> can<00:01:36.780> run<00:01:36.960> that<00:01:37.080> will<00:01:37.260> find<00:01:37.530> this

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
that you can run that will find this

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.010 
that you can run that will find this
trial<00:01:38.130> where<00:01:38.370> and<00:01:38.580> help<00:01:39.090> you<00:01:39.270> get<00:01:39.540> rid<00:01:39.780> of<00:01:39.840> it
