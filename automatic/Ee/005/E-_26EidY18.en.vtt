00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:04.129 
able to rekindle this and hopefully get
the<00:03:01.980> position<00:03:02.159> and<00:03:02.760> Owen<00:03:03.209> the<00:03:03.329> slides<00:03:03.659> off<00:03:03.930> and

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:04.139 
the position and Owen the slides off and

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:06.589 
the position and Owen the slides off and
that<00:03:04.799> gives<00:03:04.980> me<00:03:05.189> the<00:03:05.310> position<00:03:05.489> back<00:03:05.969> there's

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:06.599 
that gives me the position back there's

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:08.240 
that gives me the position back there's
also<00:03:06.750> a<00:03:06.870> battle<00:03:07.230> behind<00:03:07.379> between<00:03:07.859> need<00:03:08.069> for

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
also a battle behind between need for

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:09.920 
also a battle behind between need for
