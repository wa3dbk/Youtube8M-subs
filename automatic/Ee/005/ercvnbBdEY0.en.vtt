00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.560
 I did for you 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:14.260
 I was taking a fish out of the water 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.210
 I had never seen anything like it why 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:19.990

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:22.290

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:25.150
 making friends because he does not motors 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:28.120

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:51.460

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:55.240

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.319
 next to the door if next to the 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.720
 door so that when it comes out I do not see it 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:38.670
 so you do not have to see it at the beginning 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.370
 you will not see it but then when it comes out 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:44.260
 it will take a surprise could it be here 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:46.510
 for days without seeing it 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.150
 It is a beautiful ass who thinks this 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.640
 same final opinion this when next to 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:54.250

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:00.879

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:03.220

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:08.579
