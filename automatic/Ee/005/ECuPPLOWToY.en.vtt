00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
what was so exciting about it is not

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.090 
what was so exciting about it is not
having<00:02:45.990> the<00:02:46.140> confidence<00:02:46.350> to<00:02:46.650> be<00:02:46.800> able<00:02:46.860> to<00:02:47.010> say
