 This is the Panasonic Center Osaka digital first Asia

 Here you can make beautiful 3d figures with 120 lumics 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:33.279
 The latest system has appeared 

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:44.060
 The first feature is the perfect synchronization of 120 cameras in a short time of 1/1000 second. 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.310
 It is one of the great things to do

 like 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:01:00.880
 Calculates 3D information using pixel count information Very low blind spots 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:04.180
 Seen from all directions 

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:09.700
 So you can make a 3d model 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:11.140
 It 's okay to make a scanned figure into a figure. 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.520
 It became a mountain 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:21.200
 In total more than 2 billion 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:26.390
 It's a system with so many numbers, so it's very rich even if you're on color 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:32.299

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:45.260
 After all 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:45.260

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:58.430
 How is it 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:02:00.180
 The moment the 120 lumix cameras shuttered in unison was really now 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:03.210
 It was 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:06.470
 Expression of offensive odor or movement of hair 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:09.619
 I also cut off this movement 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:13.010
 I was totally surprised 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:15.860
