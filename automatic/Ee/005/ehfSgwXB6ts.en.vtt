00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:05.080
 hello how about everyone burn mind and 

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:07.240
 as always I hope they are super mega 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.950
 tricks we got to where we arrived 

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.200
 they will be asking and well we got to 

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:14.769
 where is a good stretch we can 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.590
 find a crucified jesus painted 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:18.700
 on a wall the truth is that I am not very 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.180
 amateur to bring this kind of stress 

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:24.280
 I do not really like to get into the subject of 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.140
 religions and etcetera is not a Jesus 

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:28.450
 crucified as we can see on the wall 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.670
 and well the truth is that this is something 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:32.770
 strange not because to begin with is not a 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.330
 poster as some will think to is a 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.480
 poster to paste or not is a poster is 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:38.950
 an ok painting is the painting who paints 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.650
 out of his house a crucified Jesus 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:43.810
 no one true, they must have been 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:46.150
 we chemos what kind of we are going to 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:47.890
 paint a jesus I do not know how they are 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:50.140
 chemos of society but in my city the 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.810
 chemos pintana and alejandra I love you or 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.160
 pure absurdities here we can see the 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.630
 location on the map for those 

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.130
 what are you asking I put a zoom 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:59.020
 from afar so that you can see 

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.460
 well from what part are we and then a 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.320
 zoom from near 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.629
 here to play with the prospects and 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.400
 it's easier for you to find it and 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:07.210
 as I told them in my city the chemos 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.940
 they do not paint 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:12.460
 visual fight just grafitean and joker 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.740
 three points the fk things well names of 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.900
 bands are not painting Jesus in the 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.850
 walls the truth unless it's a 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.729
 attempt of the catholic church or something not 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.560
 to walk painting and Jesus is but 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:25.360
 Well the truth is that I found it 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.130
 curious because if we look at the others 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.050
 graffiti in the house we can not see 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.270
 no cross we do not see virgins we do not see 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.009
 nothing or this is what he painted someone and 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.020
 honestly there are no traits but good 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:37.270
