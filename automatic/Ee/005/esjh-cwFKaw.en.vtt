00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.120 
screwdriver it's going to insert it
right<00:00:21.970> here<00:00:22.210> you<00:00:22.359> seem<00:00:22.839> to<00:00:22.929> gently<00:00:23.199> pry<00:00:23.589> till

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:24.130 
right here you seem to gently pry till

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.189 
right here you seem to gently pry till
you<00:00:24.220> hear<00:00:24.400> a<00:00:24.460> click<00:00:24.839> then<00:00:25.839> you're<00:00:26.019> going<00:00:26.109> to

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:26.199 
you hear a click then you're going to

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:28.319 
you hear a click then you're going to
just<00:00:26.349> remove<00:00:26.679> this<00:00:26.980> assembly<00:00:27.519> comes<00:00:27.999> out<00:00:28.210> on

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:28.329 
just remove this assembly comes out on

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:30.659 
just remove this assembly comes out on
the<00:00:28.419> navel<00:00:28.779> and<00:00:28.960> you<00:00:29.890> can<00:00:30.039> see<00:00:30.220> here<00:00:30.429> this<00:00:30.609> is

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:30.669 
the navel and you can see here this is

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:33.090 
the navel and you can see here this is
the<00:00:30.820> the<00:00:31.779> wire<00:00:31.960> harness<00:00:32.349> and<00:00:32.500> the<00:00:32.590> bulb<00:00:32.800> holder

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.100 
the the wire harness and the bulb holder

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.010 
the the wire harness and the bulb holder
so<00:00:33.850> you<00:00:33.910> just<00:00:34.030> going<00:00:34.239> to<00:00:34.300> disconnect<00:00:34.780> the

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:35.020 
so you just going to disconnect the

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.889 
so you just going to disconnect the
wiring<00:00:35.230> harness<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:37.120> you<00:00:37.210> can<00:00:37.390> just<00:00:37.570> twist

00:00:37.889 --> 00:00:37.899 
wiring harness and you can just twist

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:41.069 
wiring harness and you can just twist
this<00:00:38.110> and<00:00:39.120> bulb<00:00:40.120> holder<00:00:40.390> will<00:00:40.629> just<00:00:40.840> pull

00:00:41.069 --> 00:00:41.079 
this and bulb holder will just pull

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:42.540 
this and bulb holder will just pull
straight<00:00:41.230> out<00:00:41.440> and<00:00:41.949> then<00:00:42.070> you<00:00:42.160> can<00:00:42.309> replace

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:42.550 
straight out and then you can replace

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.240 
straight out and then you can replace
the<00:00:42.789> bulb<00:00:43.000> now<00:00:43.449> to<00:00:43.539> replace<00:00:43.899> the<00:00:44.020> bulb<00:00:44.350> vmw

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.250 
the bulb now to replace the bulb vmw

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.930 
the bulb now to replace the bulb vmw
specifies<00:00:46.059> an<00:00:46.270> HB<00:00:46.719> 455<00:00:47.590> watt<00:00:47.949> bulb<00:00:48.340> for<00:00:48.910> the

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:48.940 
specifies an HB 455 watt bulb for the

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.450 
specifies an HB 455 watt bulb for the
fog<00:00:49.210> light<00:00:49.449> so<00:00:50.350> replace<00:00:50.800> it<00:00:50.980> it's<00:00:51.129> basically

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:51.460 
fog light so replace it it's basically

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.419 
fog light so replace it it's basically
the<00:00:51.670> opposite<00:00:52.059> of<00:00:52.590> removing<00:00:53.590> it<00:00:53.679> so<00:00:54.309> you

00:00:54.419 --> 00:00:54.429 
the opposite of removing it so you

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:56.580 
the opposite of removing it so you
insert<00:00:54.820> this<00:00:55.000> into<00:00:55.210> the<00:00:55.480> to<00:00:56.230> the<00:00:56.350> wiring

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:56.590 
insert this into the to the wiring

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:58.830 
insert this into the to the wiring
harness<00:00:57.100> here<00:00:57.300> then<00:00:58.300> you're<00:00:58.480> going<00:00:58.570> to<00:00:58.629> take

00:00:58.830 --> 00:00:58.840 
harness here then you're going to take

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.439 
harness here then you're going to take
your<00:00:59.260> fog<00:00:59.469> light<00:00:59.679> assembly<00:01:00.100> insert<00:01:01.059> the<00:01:01.239> bulb

00:01:01.439 --> 00:01:01.449 
your fog light assembly insert the bulb

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:04.680 
your fog light assembly insert the bulb
and<00:01:02.280> just<00:01:03.280> going<00:01:03.370> to<00:01:03.429> twist<00:01:03.640> until<00:01:04.480> it<00:01:04.540> locks

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:04.690 
and just going to twist until it locks

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.340 
and just going to twist until it locks
into<00:01:04.960> place<00:01:05.400> like<00:01:06.400> so<00:01:06.460> then<00:01:07.360> insert<00:01:08.110> the

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
into place like so then insert the

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.270 
into place like so then insert the
assembly<00:01:08.800> on<00:01:08.920> an<00:01:09.010> angle<00:01:09.370> here<00:01:09.550> so<00:01:10.390> it<00:01:10.540> catches

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
assembly on an angle here so it catches

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.760 
assembly on an angle here so it catches
send<00:01:12.280> line<00:01:12.460> this<00:01:12.670> side<00:01:12.940> pop<00:01:13.660> into<00:01:13.960> place<00:01:14.170> and

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:14.770 
send line this side pop into place and

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:16.200 
send line this side pop into place and
that's<00:01:14.950> it<00:01:15.130> I'm<00:01:15.670> going<00:01:15.790> to<00:01:15.880> show<00:01:15.940> you<00:01:15.970> how<00:01:16.120> to

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:16.210 
that's it I'm going to show you how to

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:17.580 
that's it I'm going to show you how to
do<00:01:16.330> the<00:01:16.390> same<00:01:16.570> thing<00:01:16.810> over<00:01:16.930> on<00:01:17.110> the<00:01:17.200> driver's

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
new bulb

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.530 
new bulb
once<00:01:35.350> you<00:01:35.470> have<00:01:35.590> your<00:01:35.680> new<00:01:35.800> pole<00:01:36.120> just<00:01:37.120> insert

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:37.540 
once you have your new pole just insert

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.150 
once you have your new pole just insert
the<00:01:37.690> bulb<00:01:37.900> into<00:01:38.110> the<00:01:38.230> wiring<00:01:38.530> harness<00:01:38.980> here

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:39.160

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.740 
the bulb into the wiring harness here
till<00:01:39.370> it<00:01:39.460> clicks

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
till it clicks

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:45.090 
till it clicks
take<00:01:41.370> the<00:01:42.370> fog<00:01:42.610> light<00:01:42.820> assembly<00:01:43.300> and<00:01:43.680> sir<00:01:44.710> bulb

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:45.100 
take the fog light assembly and sir bulb

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.860 
take the fog light assembly and sir bulb
into<00:01:45.310> here<00:01:45.580> twist<00:01:45.940> it<00:01:46.150> until<00:01:46.330> it's<00:01:46.660> locked

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:46.870 
into here twist it until it's locked

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:48.720 
into here twist it until it's locked
into<00:01:47.080> place<00:01:47.290> then<00:01:48.130> you're<00:01:48.220> going<00:01:48.340> to<00:01:48.430> insert

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:48.730 
into place then you're going to insert

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:54.020 
into place then you're going to insert
it<00:01:48.910> into<00:01:49.030> the<00:01:49.300> vehicle<00:01:49.480> on<00:01:49.840> an<00:01:49.960> angle<00:01:50.790> Joey

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.290 

that's<00:01:55.030> it<00:01:56.580> this<00:01:57.580> is<00:01:57.760> just<00:01:57.790> from<00:01:58.030> another

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.300 
that's it this is just from another

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.350 
that's it this is just from another
angle<00:01:58.620> so<00:01:59.620> you<00:01:59.650> have<00:01:59.920> the<00:02:00.160> assembly<00:02:00.820> comes<00:02:01.120> out

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
angle so you have the assembly comes out
