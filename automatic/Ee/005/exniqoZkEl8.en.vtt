then<00:01:45.510> after<00:01:45.960> a<00:01:45.990> couple<00:01:46.200> of<00:01:46.350> seconds<00:01:46.770> it<00:01:47.070> will

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
then after a couple of seconds it will

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.160 
then after a couple of seconds it will
start<00:01:47.580> going<00:01:47.730> tacky<00:01:48.300> now<00:01:48.510> the<00:01:48.570> idea<00:01:48.930> is<00:01:48.990> this

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
start going tacky now the idea is this

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.500 
start going tacky now the idea is this
is<00:01:49.230> what<00:01:49.380> I<00:01:49.410> do<00:01:49.530> just<00:01:50.370> it's<00:01:50.670> not<00:01:50.790> I<00:01:51.060> mean<00:01:51.330> that's

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:51.510 
is what I do just it's not I mean that's

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:52.730 
is what I do just it's not I mean that's
probably<00:01:51.630> not<00:01:51.870> the<00:01:51.930> best<00:01:52.140> way<00:01:52.290> of<00:01:52.320> doing<00:01:52.530> it

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
probably not the best way of doing it

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.650 
probably not the best way of doing it
but<00:01:52.860> this<00:01:52.980> is<00:01:53.100> how<00:01:53.220> I<00:01:53.250> do<00:01:53.370> it<00:01:53.610> and<00:01:53.850> it<00:01:54.330> works<00:01:54.480> for

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:54.660 
but this is how I do it and it works for

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:57.740 
but this is how I do it and it works for
me<00:01:54.810> so<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.260> I<00:01:56.130> take<00:01:56.550> my<00:01:56.670> spatula<00:01:56.850> and<00:01:57.240> I<00:01:57.360> start

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
me so and I take my spatula and I start

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.070 
me so and I take my spatula and I start
pulling<00:01:58.020> my<00:01:58.350> eyebrow<00:01:58.890> down<00:01:59.640> so<00:02:00.600> all<00:02:00.870> of<00:02:00.990> the

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
pulling my eyebrow down so all of the

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:02.660 
pulling my eyebrow down so all of the
individual<00:02:01.500> hairs<00:02:01.740> start<00:02:02.430> sticking

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
individual hairs start sticking

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.750 
individual hairs start sticking
downwards<00:02:03.620> the<00:02:04.620> reason<00:02:04.920> I<00:02:04.980> do<00:02:05.040> that<00:02:05.220> is<00:02:05.430> just

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:05.760 
downwards the reason I do that is just

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:08.240 
downwards the reason I do that is just
when<00:02:06.450> I<00:02:06.480> apply<00:02:06.810> the<00:02:06.870> wax<00:02:07.110> I<00:02:07.470> don't<00:02:07.710> want<00:02:07.890> it<00:02:07.950> it

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
when I apply the wax I don't want it it

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.770 
when I apply the wax I don't want it it
may<00:02:08.700> cover<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.090> eyebrows<00:02:09.420> but<00:02:09.570> they'll<00:02:09.690> be

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
may cover the eyebrows but they'll be

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.300 
may cover the eyebrows but they'll be
still<00:02:09.929> be<00:02:10.020> a<00:02:10.050> lump<00:02:10.320> so<00:02:10.770> I<00:02:10.800> want<00:02:10.979> to<00:02:11.040> get<00:02:11.100> it<00:02:11.220> as

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
still be a lump so I want to get it as

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.600 
still be a lump so I want to get it as
flat<00:02:11.730> as<00:02:12.120> possible<00:02:12.980> so<00:02:13.980> I'll<00:02:14.070> just<00:02:14.220> keep

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
flat as possible so I'll just keep

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.100 
flat as possible so I'll just keep
pulling<00:02:14.880> it<00:02:14.970> down<00:02:15.120> and<00:02:15.150> I'd<00:02:15.570> rather<00:02:15.780> pull<00:02:16.020> it

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
pulling it down and I'd rather pull it

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.690 
pulling it down and I'd rather pull it
down<00:02:16.350> because<00:02:16.620> if<00:02:16.830> I<00:02:16.890> pull<00:02:17.100> it<00:02:17.220> up<00:02:17.370> they'll

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:17.700 
down because if I pull it up they'll

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.090 
down because if I pull it up they'll
just<00:02:17.850> look<00:02:17.940> a<00:02:18.030> bit<00:02:18.180> weird<00:02:18.330> having<00:02:18.810> this<00:02:19.100> trend

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
just look a bit weird having this trend

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.800 
just look a bit weird having this trend
like<00:02:20.250> smooth<00:02:20.820> very<00:02:21.060> going<00:02:21.390> across<00:02:21.570> the

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
like smooth very going across the

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.360 
like smooth very going across the
forehead<00:02:22.050> I<00:02:22.200> just<00:02:22.350> I<00:02:22.590> prefer<00:02:22.740> it<00:02:23.010> going<00:02:23.220> in<00:02:23.310> the

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
forehead I just I prefer it going in the

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.010 
forehead I just I prefer it going in the
eye<00:02:23.400> socket<00:02:23.850> you<00:02:23.940> can<00:02:24.060> hide<00:02:24.240> easier<00:02:24.570> so<00:02:24.810> just

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:25.020 
eye socket you can hide easier so just

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.199 
eye socket you can hide easier so just
keep<00:02:25.260> working<00:02:25.560> it<00:02:25.980> until<00:02:26.160> it<00:02:26.700> starts<00:02:27.090> going

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
keep working it until it starts going

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:28.580 
keep working it until it starts going
completely<00:02:27.450> tacky<00:02:27.930> you<00:02:28.140> know<00:02:28.230> the<00:02:28.350> hair<00:02:28.530> is

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
completely tacky you know the hair is

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.250 
completely tacky you know the hair is
completely<00:02:28.800> stuck<00:02:29.490> down<00:02:29.820> flat<00:02:30.270> then<00:02:31.050> I'm<00:02:31.140> just

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
completely stuck down flat then I'm just

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.960 
completely stuck down flat then I'm just
going<00:02:31.380> to<00:02:31.410> let<00:02:31.590> that<00:02:31.620> dry<00:02:31.800> probably<00:02:32.459> it's

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
going to let that dry probably it's

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.430 
going to let that dry probably it's
usually<00:02:33.120> about<00:02:33.330> 10<00:02:33.630> minutes<00:02:33.930> or<00:02:34.080> so<00:02:34.110> cause<00:02:34.380> I

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
usually about 10 minutes or so cause I

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.140 
usually about 10 minutes or so cause I
like<00:02:34.560> to<00:02:34.650> be<00:02:34.740> completely<00:02:35.280> completely<00:02:35.700> solid

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
like to be completely completely solid

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.960 
like to be completely completely solid
dry<00:02:36.390> and<00:02:36.690> but<00:02:37.620> yeah<00:02:37.740> as<00:02:37.860> you<00:02:37.950> can<00:02:38.010> see<00:02:38.130> there's

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
dry and but yeah as you can see there's

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.390 
dry and but yeah as you can see there's
it's<00:02:39.300> just<00:02:39.510> a<00:02:39.690> flat<00:02:40.350> edge<00:02:40.680> now<00:02:40.920> so<00:02:41.070> there's<00:02:41.250> no

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
it's just a flat edge now so there's no

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.880 
it's just a flat edge now so there's no
raised<00:02:41.850> area<00:02:42.240> where<00:02:42.330> the<00:02:42.420> eyebrow<00:02:42.750> is

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
raised area where the eyebrow is

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.199 
raised area where the eyebrow is
conceived<00:02:43.890> from<00:02:44.100> the<00:02:44.190> profile<00:02:44.640> bit<00:02:44.790> there<00:02:44.970> but

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
conceived from the profile bit there but

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.479 
conceived from the profile bit there but
yet<00:02:45.390> so<00:02:45.750> then<00:02:46.020> I<00:02:46.110> can<00:02:46.170> move<00:02:46.350> on<00:02:46.500> to<00:02:46.680> the<00:02:46.769> wax<00:02:46.980> so

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
yet so then I can move on to the wax so

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:49.940 
yet so then I can move on to the wax so
I<00:02:47.820> use<00:02:48.269> no<00:02:48.540> more<00:02:48.780> than<00:02:48.840> all<00:02:49.290> about<00:02:49.500> that<00:02:49.739> much

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
I use no more than all about that much

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.910 
I use no more than all about that much
per<00:02:50.280> eyebrow<00:02:50.790> not<00:02:51.660> a<00:02:51.690> huge<00:02:52.019> amount<00:02:52.110> at<00:02:52.410> all<00:02:52.680> if

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
per eyebrow not a huge amount at all if

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.590 
per eyebrow not a huge amount at all if
you<00:02:53.400> need<00:02:53.519> more<00:02:53.700> you<00:02:53.820> can<00:02:53.910> always<00:02:54.000> go<00:02:54.209> in<00:02:54.390> but

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
you need more you can always go in but

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.710 
you need more you can always go in but
so<00:02:55.440> then<00:02:55.920> what<00:02:56.220> I'm<00:02:56.280> going<00:02:56.370> to<00:02:56.459> do<00:02:56.550> is<00:02:56.720> make

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:57.720 
so then what I'm going to do is make

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.120 
so then what I'm going to do is make
sure<00:02:57.750> they<00:02:58.019> don't<00:02:58.170> definitely<00:02:58.800> definitely

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
sure they don't definitely definitely

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.530 
sure they don't definitely definitely
everything<00:02:59.310> is<00:02:59.489> all<00:02:59.580> dry<00:02:59.850> and<00:02:59.880> nothing<00:03:00.269> sticky

or tacky so I'm going to start at the

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.160 
or tacky so I'm going to start at the
base<00:03:02.430> of<00:03:02.670> my<00:03:02.760> eyebrow<00:03:03.150> and<00:03:03.480> just<00:03:03.780> pull<00:03:04.140> it

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170

base of my eyebrow and just pull it
along<00:03:04.980> the<00:03:05.700> shape<00:03:06.000> of<00:03:06.269> my<00:03:06.780> eyebrow<00:03:07.140> doesn't

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:07.620 
along the shape of my eyebrow doesn't

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.070 
along the shape of my eyebrow doesn't
matter<00:03:07.860> if<00:03:07.920> it's<00:03:08.010> all<00:03:08.100> covered<00:03:08.310> at<00:03:08.519> this<00:03:08.640> point

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:09.080 
matter if it's all covered at this point

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:12.410 
matter if it's all covered at this point
okay<00:03:10.110> so<00:03:10.530> then<00:03:11.250> just<00:03:11.550> go<00:03:11.700> back<00:03:11.850> in<00:03:12.060> and<00:03:12.300> just

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
start smoothing it out removing any

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.750 
start smoothing it out removing any
excess<00:03:15.660> that<00:03:16.320> comes<00:03:16.560> off<00:03:16.769> just<00:03:17.070> make<00:03:17.430> sure<00:03:17.610> to

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
excess that comes off just make sure to

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.250 
excess that comes off just make sure to
go<00:03:17.910> in<00:03:18.120> the<00:03:18.209> direction<00:03:18.480> of<00:03:18.690> your<00:03:18.840> eyebrows

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
go in the direction of your eyebrows

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.240 
go in the direction of your eyebrows
because<00:03:19.530> we<00:03:19.620> don't<00:03:19.769> gonna<00:03:19.890> start<00:03:20.070> pulling

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.250 
because we don't gonna start pulling

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.070 
because we don't gonna start pulling
hairs<00:03:20.610> up<00:03:20.820> going<00:03:21.480> that<00:03:21.630> shouldn't<00:03:21.959> happen

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:22.080 
hairs up going that shouldn't happen

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.040 
hairs up going that shouldn't happen
because<00:03:22.350> of<00:03:22.530> spirit<00:03:22.860> gum<00:03:23.040> but<00:03:23.280> yeah<00:03:23.790> okay<00:03:24.630> so

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.050 
because of spirit gum but yeah okay so

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:28.130 
because of spirit gum but yeah okay so
when<00:03:25.470> the<00:03:25.830> entire<00:03:26.280> area<00:03:26.550> is<00:03:26.730> covered<00:03:27.150> we<00:03:27.959> can

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
when the entire area is covered we can

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:29.990 
when the entire area is covered we can
just<00:03:28.320> go<00:03:28.500> in<00:03:28.620> with<00:03:28.769> a<00:03:28.830> clean<00:03:29.100> spatula<00:03:29.400> and<00:03:29.940> just

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
just go in with a clean spatula and just

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.130 
just go in with a clean spatula and just
remove<00:03:30.900> all<00:03:31.200> of<00:03:31.620> the<00:03:31.709> excess<00:03:31.830> around<00:03:33.140> the

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
remove all of the excess around the

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.290 
remove all of the excess around the
eyebrows<00:03:34.500> and<00:03:35.100> the<00:03:35.250> idea<00:03:35.580> is<00:03:35.700> then<00:03:35.940> you<00:03:36.120> can

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
eyebrows and the idea is then you can

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.810 
eyebrows and the idea is then you can
just<00:03:36.450> start<00:03:36.720> typing<00:03:37.050> it<00:03:37.470> out<00:03:37.590> so<00:03:38.400> it<00:03:38.670> just

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
just start typing it out so it just

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.759 
just start typing it out so it just
blends<00:03:39.150> off<00:03:39.390> ever<00:03:39.630> so<00:03:39.840> slightly<00:03:40.200> into<00:03:40.500> the

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
blends off ever so slightly into the

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:46.220 
blends off ever so slightly into the
skin

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:46.230 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:49.460 

and<00:03:46.920> there<00:03:47.129> we<00:03:47.310> are<00:03:47.340> so<00:03:47.879> not<00:03:48.810> you<00:03:48.959> guys<00:03:49.230> can

usually<00:05:04.320> powder<00:05:04.830> my<00:05:05.400> eyebrows<00:05:05.820> when<00:05:06.000> I'm

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.090 
usually powder my eyebrows when I'm

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:07.129 
usually powder my eyebrows when I'm
blocking<00:05:06.330> them<00:05:06.419> out<00:05:06.510> if<00:05:06.690> I'm<00:05:06.870> going<00:05:06.960> to<00:05:07.050> be<00:05:07.110> a

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:07.139 
blocking them out if I'm going to be a

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:09.890 
blocking them out if I'm going to be a
water<00:05:07.440> color<00:05:07.800> over<00:05:08.130> them<00:05:08.280> because<00:05:08.450> it<00:05:09.450> kind<00:05:09.780> of

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:09.900 
water color over them because it kind of

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.560 
water color over them because it kind of
mixes<00:05:10.710> with<00:05:10.950> the<00:05:10.979> water<00:05:11.430> colors<00:05:12.000> and<00:05:12.270> the

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:12.570 
mixes with the water colors and the

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:14.390 
mixes with the water colors and the
creams<00:05:12.870> and<00:05:13.080> it<00:05:13.110> changes<00:05:13.740> the<00:05:13.860> color<00:05:14.039> of<00:05:14.190> us<00:05:14.280> so

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 
creams and it changes the color of us so

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.790 
creams and it changes the color of us so
slightly<00:05:14.669> so<00:05:14.970> I<00:05:15.000> just<00:05:15.750> go<00:05:15.930> over<00:05:16.110> them<00:05:16.350> neatly

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
slightly so I just go over them neatly

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.379 
slightly so I just go over them neatly
it's<00:05:17.160> only<00:05:17.340> if<00:05:17.460> I'm<00:05:17.550> using<00:05:17.700> foundations<00:05:18.270> or

00:05:18.379 --> 00:05:18.389 
it's only if I'm using foundations or

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:20.420 
it's only if I'm using foundations or
concealer<00:05:18.900> that's<00:05:19.410> when<00:05:19.740> I<00:05:19.770> usually<00:05:19.950> powder

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:20.430 
concealer that's when I usually powder

00:05:20.430 --> 00:05:21.800 
concealer that's when I usually powder
them<00:05:20.669> really<00:05:20.910> heavily<00:05:21.090> just<00:05:21.539> so<00:05:21.690> I<00:05:21.750> know

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810 
them really heavily just so I know

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.110 
them really heavily just so I know
they're<00:05:22.050> more<00:05:22.169> secure<00:05:22.530> so<00:05:23.430> the<00:05:23.669> last<00:05:23.820> thing<00:05:24.090> I

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120 
they're more secure so the last thing I

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:25.879 
they're more secure so the last thing I
can<00:05:24.300> recommend<00:05:24.600> really<00:05:25.080> it's<00:05:25.530> fairly

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:25.889 
can recommend really it's fairly

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:27.920 
can recommend really it's fairly
straightforward<00:05:26.280> but<00:05:26.729> just<00:05:27.419> don't<00:05:27.630> rush

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
straightforward but just don't rush

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.620 
straightforward but just don't rush
really<00:05:28.289> just<00:05:28.530> take<00:05:28.740> your<00:05:28.919> time<00:05:29.220> and<00:05:29.490> just<00:05:29.630> make

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:30.630 
really just take your time and just make

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.600 
really just take your time and just make
sure<00:05:30.780> the<00:05:30.900> glue<00:05:31.080> is<00:05:31.139> completely<00:05:31.200> dry<00:05:31.650> and<00:05:32.250> just

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:32.610 
sure the glue is completely dry and just

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:34.010 
sure the glue is completely dry and just
take<00:05:33.000> it<00:05:33.150> slopes<00:05:33.450> it's<00:05:33.660> usually<00:05:33.780> the<00:05:33.990> first
