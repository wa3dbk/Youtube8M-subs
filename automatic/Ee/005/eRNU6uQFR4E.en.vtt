00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.679
 [Music] 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:27.710
 This time something happens when we arrive 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.560
 that is allowed to an old camper actually 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.760
 not happen but it happened 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.160
 Welcome to my parking space 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:37.340
 reportage we got on our navi 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.350
 leave and that leads us right through 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.360
 the small town to the pitch 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.280
 they would only have gone 200 meters further 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.220
 then we would have a flawless 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.140
 but then it had access at the end 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.420
 but everything worked out so we reach 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:55.540
 impeccable the pitch kilometer 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.540
 Pipe near gun year in spain 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.890
 We signed up and were able to 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:02.809
 then one of the free places 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.460
 I absolutely must choose that 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:05.560
 say we want to be very friendly here 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:08.660
 receive 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:11.780
 The place is very centrally located in one 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:13.640
 he is surrounded by a small place 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.580
 year you can say a little 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.799
 commercial area but that does not bother 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:22.659
 From there you even have a view 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:22.659
 the church tower of the small village 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:29.299
 the place is with a good disposal 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:32.530
 equipped which is generous and everything 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:32.530
 there is what we need 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.620
 Washer and dryer are 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:43.070
 A washing-up option is available 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:46.060
 showers and toilets also take a shower 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.060
 are included in the price 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.180
 Now let's take a look 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:52.400
 on top of the whole thing 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:55.790
 So we see that then the building 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:58.400
 with office right next to a terrace where 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:01.640
 you can sit outside and then have it 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:04.940
 We left the access road from the n 3 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:07.729
 32 and very far in the background at 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.500
 horizon is the sea about 1.5 kilometers 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:10.459
 away 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.470
 Now again a look of one 

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:14.540
 other side on the place you can see 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.239
 again the building one sees then also 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:20.480
 the driveway of the place you come here 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:24.020
 directly from the 3 32 on this driveway 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.580
 To be only 200 meters away 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:29.540
 I'll explain exactly 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:31.970
 the journey here again a look up 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.480
 The place there you will find everything we have 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.190
 need 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.610
 There is even a diaper market here 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:40.760
 more cardona too and small restaurants 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:45.320
 So there is everything there what the heart 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:48.820
 desires the place is happening and is 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:52.420
 There is also enough space for electricity 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:55.370
 but must be paid extra 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.290
 If you like to ride a bike, this is good 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:00.190
 possible because you can stay here 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:02.780
 developed bike paths through the 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.260
 Orange plantations go to Gambia or 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:07.700
 even oliver ride the bike 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:08.299
 Here are the bike to the beach 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.980
 hazards 

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:12.320
 I have to say that I have 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:14.390
 spoken at the beginning of 1.5 kilometers 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:18.070
 this is true not quite he three 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:18.070
 up to four kilometers to the beach 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:27.590
 [Music] 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:30.200
 Now I show on the map where in about 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:34.220
 the square of the parking space light and here 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:35.840
 is was the place valencia and then 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.030
 we were in the direction south here 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:41.300
 is yes, it is just behind it oliva 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:45.080
 and between gang yes and I oliva 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:47.390
 this pitch kilometer zero here 

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:51.319
 again on a slightly more detailed map 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:55.280
 here is yes there is oliva and here 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:57.340
 Halfway on the n 332 not 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.569
 the place so directly on this 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:02.150
 Of course, you can also do national road 

00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:05.959
 drive over the highway and down here 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:09.019
 and then there coordinates you will find 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:11.510
 below the text again 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:14.209
 note to approach from south direction 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:18.560
 in front of the raptor petrol station on the left 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:21.500
 turn in from the n 3 3 2 direction 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:25.820
 north it is just behind the rear bench 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:29.450
 There is a place from both directions 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:32.960
 parking sign so you can open 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:34.760
 every case I find the driveway 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:36.620
 that's why I showed it again 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.900
 myself also wrong when driving through 

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:42.470
 the small place so here it is the 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:44.840
 driveway easily we still will give 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:48.789
 times inspired to the boss of the place the 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.789
 paco and he also says a few words 

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:01.970
 The course is a very nice one in the morning 

00:05:00.139 --> 00:05:04.460
 are already grapefruits and 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:06.680
 apples on the table and everything is 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:08.710
 here in the square very well maintained and 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.710
 orderly 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.070
 [Music] 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:16.740
 maybe you have to do that too 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:19.560
 The parking space operator added us 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:21.060
 said the place remains in the summer 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.730
 closed that is in the months 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:26.180
 june july august is the place 

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:26.180
 closed 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:32.669
 that was my report or mine 

00:05:30.450 --> 00:05:35.250
 report on the pitch kilometer 

00:05:32.669 --> 00:05:36.210
 zero near the city can yes 

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:38.100
 in Spain 

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:41.150
 I thank you for the watch, and say in 

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:41.150
 Until next time 

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:51.769
