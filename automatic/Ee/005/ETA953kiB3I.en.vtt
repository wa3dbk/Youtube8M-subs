00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:46.780
 Maybe not. 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:49.590

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:55.649

 I sympathize with this. 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:30.840
 We're okay . I can cut it . I think it's worth it. 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:35.489

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:39.930
 It's closing, but I think my neck will hurt. 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:40.680
 I could not think of that because my shirt was wet. 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.790
 I will. 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:49.709
 I think I need it with my feet, but because men are women

 Because it was not half-deserted, but if I was drifting in the ocean

 I know that is the person that originally supporter supporters cheer 

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:36.930
