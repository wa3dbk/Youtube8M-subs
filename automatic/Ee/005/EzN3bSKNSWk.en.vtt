here's<00:00:05.130> the<00:00:05.399> pookie<00:00:06.000> 50<00:00:06.840> motor<00:00:07.410> as<00:00:07.649> in<00:00:08.130> my<00:00:08.340> part

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
here's the pookie 50 motor as in my part

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.100 
here's the pookie 50 motor as in my part
1<00:00:09.540> video<00:00:10.250> and<00:00:11.250> here's<00:00:11.610> the<00:00:11.910> the<00:00:12.570> flywheel

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
1 video and here's the the flywheel

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.310 
1 video and here's the the flywheel
assembly<00:00:14.180> it<00:00:15.180> took<00:00:15.420> me<00:00:15.570> a<00:00:15.600> couple<00:00:15.810> of<00:00:15.930> days<00:00:16.080> to

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
assembly it took me a couple of days to

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.259 
assembly it took me a couple of days to
get<00:00:16.439> it<00:00:16.590> off<00:00:16.740> I<00:00:16.949> soaked<00:00:17.310> it<00:00:17.460> quite<00:00:17.730> a<00:00:17.760> bit<00:00:18.029> with

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:18.269 
get it off I soaked it quite a bit with

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:22.669 
get it off I soaked it quite a bit with
us<00:00:18.679> with<00:00:19.679> this<00:00:19.999> PV<00:00:20.999> penetrating<00:00:21.839> catalyst<00:00:22.439> and

00:00:22.669 --> 00:00:22.679 
us with this PV penetrating catalyst and

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:26.540 
us with this PV penetrating catalyst and
whatnot<00:00:23.039> and<00:00:23.939> I<00:00:24.089> had<00:00:24.240> to<00:00:24.359> make<00:00:24.539> some<00:00:24.779> tools<00:00:25.550> let

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
whatnot and I had to make some tools let

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.540 
whatnot and I had to make some tools let
me<00:00:26.669> show<00:00:26.849> you<00:00:30.739> when<00:00:31.739> you<00:00:31.890> take<00:00:32.130> the<00:00:32.279> flywheel

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
me show you when you take the flywheel

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:35.810 
me show you when you take the flywheel
off<00:00:33.030> you<00:00:33.239> have<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.590> loosen<00:00:34.590> a<00:00:34.890> nut<00:00:35.130> right<00:00:35.430> here

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
off you have to loosen a nut right here

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.740 
off you have to loosen a nut right here
which<00:00:36.090> I<00:00:36.270> use<00:00:36.450> the<00:00:36.690> breaker<00:00:37.200> bar<00:00:37.560> of<00:00:37.710> course

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.750 
which I use the breaker bar of course

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.120 
which I use the breaker bar of course
with<00:00:39.750> a<00:00:39.780> pipe<00:00:40.020> on<00:00:40.260> it<00:00:40.290> but<00:00:40.560> how<00:00:40.770> do<00:00:40.830> you<00:00:40.920> keep

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:41.130 
with a pipe on it but how do you keep

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:44.390 
with a pipe on it but how do you keep
the<00:00:41.400> thing<00:00:41.610> from<00:00:41.760> turning<00:00:42.240> well<00:00:42.420> I<00:00:43.280> solved<00:00:44.280> the

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:44.400 
the thing from turning well I solved the

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.900 
the thing from turning well I solved the
pooch<00:00:44.880> tool<00:00:45.270> and<00:00:45.720> they<00:00:46.320> locked<00:00:46.650> into<00:00:46.950> here<00:00:47.730> and

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
pooch tool and they locked into here and

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.100 
pooch tool and they locked into here and
here<00:00:48.270> with<00:00:48.450> alayka<00:00:48.840> a<00:00:49.850> v-shape<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:51.210> tool<00:00:51.810> that

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
here with alayka a v-shape the tool that

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
here with alayka a v-shape the tool that
went<00:00:52.320> out<00:00:52.440> had<00:00:53.040> a<00:00:53.070> handle<00:00:53.490> on<00:00:53.610> it<00:00:54.920> that<00:00:55.920> would

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:56.130 
went out had a handle on it that would

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:57.950 
went out had a handle on it that would
work<00:00:56.310> but<00:00:56.580> then<00:00:56.820> you<00:00:56.850> have<00:00:57.150> to<00:00:57.180> make<00:00:57.510> clearance

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
work but then you have to make clearance

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.600 
work but then you have to make clearance
for<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.290> hole<00:00:58.470> to<00:00:58.590> put<00:00:58.770> your<00:00:58.950> wrench<00:00:59.100> once<00:00:59.400> so

00:00:59.600 --> 00:00:59.610 
for the hole to put your wrench once so

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:01.790 
for the hole to put your wrench once so
I<00:00:59.820> came<00:01:00.240> with<00:01:00.630> the<00:01:00.750> idea<00:01:01.110> came<00:01:01.410> up<00:01:01.470> with<00:01:01.710> the

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
I came with the idea came up with the

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.460 
I came with the idea came up with the
idea<00:01:02.100> of<00:01:02.420> putting<00:01:03.470> pins<00:01:04.470> here<00:01:04.890> and<00:01:05.040> here<00:01:05.430> and

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 
idea of putting pins here and here and

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.310 
idea of putting pins here and here and
just<00:01:07.880> holding<00:01:08.880> vaulting<00:01:09.690> them<00:01:09.840> to<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.020> part

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
just holding vaulting them to a part

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.170 
just holding vaulting them to a part
which<00:01:10.470> I<00:01:10.620> did<00:01:11.450> one<00:01:12.450> piece<00:01:12.690> of<00:01:12.900> angle<00:01:13.050> iron<00:01:13.350> and

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
which I did one piece of angle iron and

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.030 
which I did one piece of angle iron and
I<00:01:15.180> measured<00:01:16.050> from<00:01:16.380> here<00:01:16.550> to<00:01:17.550> here<00:01:17.970> and

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
I measured from here to here and

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.420 
I measured from here to here and
subtract<00:01:20.040> it<00:01:20.280> 2<00:01:21.090> times<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.750> radius<00:01:22.229> of<00:01:22.530> the

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
subtract it 2 times the radius of the

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.219 
subtract it 2 times the radius of the
Volt<00:01:23.670> rob<00:01:23.909> is<00:01:24.030> going<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.240> use<00:01:24.420> which<00:01:24.630> is<00:01:24.780> 3/8

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
Volt rob is going to use which is 3/8

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.380 
Volt rob is going to use which is 3/8
and<00:01:25.409> it<00:01:25.560> come<00:01:25.710> out<00:01:25.830> came<00:01:26.400> out<00:01:26.550> pretty<00:01:26.790> close<00:01:27.060> to

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
and it come out came out pretty close to

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.969 
and it come out came out pretty close to
a<00:01:28.490> 1.75<00:01:29.490> or<00:01:30.000> one<00:01:30.180> in<00:01:30.330> three-quarter<00:01:30.900> inches<00:01:31.260> so

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
a 1.75 or one in three-quarter inches so

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.010 
a 1.75 or one in three-quarter inches so
I<00:01:32.010> drilled<00:01:32.340> two<00:01:32.580> holes<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:33.090> tapped<00:01:33.330> them<00:01:33.600> for

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
I drilled two holes and tapped them for

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.550 
I drilled two holes and tapped them for
3/8<00:01:34.440> bolts<00:01:34.920> at<00:01:35.670> 1<00:01:35.940> in<00:01:36.090> 3/4<00:01:36.690> inch<00:01:36.900> apart<00:01:37.020> and

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
3/8 bolts at 1 in 3/4 inch apart and

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.660 
3/8 bolts at 1 in 3/4 inch apart and
they<00:01:37.890> fit<00:01:38.159> very<00:01:38.430> nicely<00:01:38.930> down<00:01:39.930> in<00:01:40.200> there<00:01:40.440> a

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:40.670 
they fit very nicely down in there a

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.430 
they fit very nicely down in there a
little<00:01:41.670> bit<00:01:41.790> of<00:01:41.940> slop<00:01:42.180> but<00:01:43.020> it's<00:01:43.170> enough<00:01:43.409> to

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:43.440 
little bit of slop but it's enough to

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.280 
little bit of slop but it's enough to
hold<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:44.040> hold<00:01:44.580> the<00:01:44.700> flywheel<00:01:44.940> to<00:01:45.780> get<00:01:46.170> the

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
hold the hold the flywheel to get the

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.160 
hold the hold the flywheel to get the
wrench<00:01:46.470> on<00:01:46.710> it<00:01:46.850> and<00:01:47.850> it<00:01:47.970> worked<00:01:48.150> quite<00:01:48.330> well<00:01:48.450> it

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
wrench on it and it worked quite well it

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.020 
wrench on it and it worked quite well it
worked<00:01:49.409> quite<00:01:49.710> well<00:01:49.740> I<00:01:50.159> had<00:01:50.340> to<00:01:50.520> put<00:01:50.670> a<00:01:50.700> little

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
worked quite well I had to put a little

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.700 
worked quite well I had to put a little
extension<00:01:51.450> alarm<00:01:51.869> on<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.140> I<00:01:52.200> made<00:01:52.409> it<00:01:52.530> too

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
extension alarm on and I made it too

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.340 
extension alarm on and I made it too
short<00:01:52.979> and<00:01:53.159> I<00:01:53.220> needed<00:01:53.460> more<00:01:53.700> torque<00:01:54.090> so<00:01:54.390> I<00:01:54.630> put

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
short and I needed more torque so I put

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.440 
short and I needed more torque so I put
a<00:01:55.380> cheater<00:01:55.710> on<00:01:55.799> here<00:01:56.250> and<00:01:56.400> a<00:01:56.580> cheater<00:01:56.880> on<00:01:57.150> the

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
a cheater on here and a cheater on the

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.980 
a cheater on here and a cheater on the
on<00:01:58.080> the<00:01:58.229> breaker<00:01:58.409> bar<00:01:58.710> and<00:01:58.950> it<00:01:59.100> came<00:01:59.250> right<00:01:59.460> off

00:01:59.980 --> 00:01:59.990 
on the breaker bar and it came right off

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.219 
on the breaker bar and it came right off
not<00:02:00.990> without<00:02:01.229> a<00:02:01.290> little<00:02:01.470> fight<00:02:02.090> so<00:02:03.090> you<00:02:03.150> uh<00:02:03.420> you

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
not without a little fight so you uh you

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.500 
not without a little fight so you uh you
get<00:02:04.350> that<00:02:04.619> off<00:02:04.860> and<00:02:05.189> then<00:02:05.400> I<00:02:05.640> had<00:02:05.970> to<00:02:06.090> get<00:02:06.270> the

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:06.510 
get that off and then I had to get the

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:08.690 
get that off and then I had to get the
actual<00:02:07.049> flywheel<00:02:07.619> off<00:02:07.830> and<00:02:08.069> I<00:02:08.250> read<00:02:08.519> on

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
actual flywheel off and I read on

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.960 
actual flywheel off and I read on
various<00:02:09.659> sites<00:02:09.929> that<00:02:10.340> you<00:02:11.340> could<00:02:11.550> do<00:02:11.670> it<00:02:11.790> with

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
various sites that you could do it with

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.449 
various sites that you could do it with
a<00:02:12.000> plastic<00:02:12.630> hammer<00:02:13.140> so<00:02:13.500> I<00:02:13.530> tapped<00:02:14.069> it<00:02:14.280> like

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
a plastic hammer so I tapped it like

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:15.380

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.290 
here
because<00:02:24.209> I've<00:02:24.360> done<00:02:24.390> all<00:02:24.750> this<00:02:24.959> and<00:02:26.300> I'm

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
because I've done all this and I'm

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.510 
because I've done all this and I'm
inspecting<00:02:28.050> that<00:02:28.230> to<00:02:28.470> see<00:02:28.680> how<00:02:28.800> if<00:02:28.950> it's<00:02:29.100> any

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:29.520 
inspecting that to see how if it's any

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.730 
inspecting that to see how if it's any
good<00:02:29.610> looks<00:02:30.030> pretty<00:02:30.300> good<00:02:30.540> here<00:02:31.290> it<00:02:31.410> is<00:02:31.530> over

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
good looks pretty good here it is over

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:40.760 
good looks pretty good here it is over
here<00:02:35.930> these<00:02:36.930> little<00:02:37.770> felt<00:02:38.490> wipers<00:02:39.470> are<00:02:40.470> all

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
here these little felt wipers are all

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.930 
here these little felt wipers are all
completely<00:02:41.250> dried<00:02:41.700> out<00:02:41.730> on<00:02:42.300> the<00:02:43.790> one<00:02:44.790> the

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
completely dried out on the one the

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.570 
completely dried out on the one the
points<00:02:45.360> and<00:02:45.569> whatnot<00:02:45.930> so<00:02:48.350> the<00:02:49.350> cam<00:02:50.130> I<00:02:50.160> was

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580 
points and whatnot so the cam I was

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.100 
points and whatnot so the cam I was
surprised<00:02:50.970> to<00:02:51.180> find<00:02:51.209> that<00:02:51.600> the<00:02:51.870> actual<00:02:52.170> cam<00:02:52.620> is

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
surprised to find that the actual cam is

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.440 
surprised to find that the actual cam is
part<00:02:55.110> of<00:02:55.290> the<00:02:55.620> flywheel<00:02:56.310> which<00:02:56.880> is<00:02:57.090> kind<00:02:57.360> of

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
part of the flywheel which is kind of

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.000 
part of the flywheel which is kind of
neat<00:02:57.630> in<00:02:57.750> a<00:02:57.810> way<00:02:57.959> because<00:02:58.230> if<00:02:58.380> it<00:02:58.500> wears<00:02:58.680> out

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
neat in a way because if it wears out

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.390 
neat in a way because if it wears out
you<00:02:59.570> replace<00:03:00.570> the<00:03:00.810> whole<00:03:00.959> things<00:03:01.320> I'm<00:03:02.220> gonna

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
you replace the whole things I'm gonna

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.220

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
try to get away with just sanding it and

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:05.900 
try to get away with just sanding it and
I've<00:03:04.290> sand<00:03:04.650> it<00:03:04.830> and<00:03:04.950> polished<00:03:05.370> it<00:03:05.550> up<00:03:05.670> see

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
I've sand it and polished it up see

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:11.900 
I've sand it and polished it up see
there's<00:03:06.120> the<00:03:06.269> cam<00:03:07.459> right<00:03:08.459> there<00:03:08.730> is<00:03:08.970> the<00:03:09.150> lobe

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:15.080 

and<00:03:12.770> you<00:03:13.770> could<00:03:13.950> even<00:03:14.130> see<00:03:14.640> I<00:03:14.670> don't<00:03:14.880> know<00:03:15.030> if

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
and you could even see I don't know if

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.840 
and you could even see I don't know if
you<00:03:15.150> can<00:03:15.330> see<00:03:15.480> it<00:03:15.570> on<00:03:15.660> the<00:03:15.780> video<00:03:16.110> here<00:03:16.350> you<00:03:16.500> can

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 
you can see it on the video here you can

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:21.680 
you can see it on the video here you can
you<00:03:17.850> can<00:03:18.060> kind<00:03:18.330> of<00:03:18.450> see<00:03:18.720> the<00:03:20.210> you<00:03:21.210> really<00:03:21.450> can't

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
you can kind of see the you really can't

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.180 
you can kind of see the you really can't
see<00:03:21.870> that<00:03:22.080> with<00:03:22.230> the<00:03:22.320> shadow<00:03:22.590> but<00:03:22.860> you<00:03:23.010> could

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
see that with the shadow but you could

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.750 
see that with the shadow but you could
see<00:03:23.340> the<00:03:23.490> pitting<00:03:24.080> on<00:03:25.080> the<00:03:25.470> on<00:03:25.890> the<00:03:26.100> cam<00:03:26.340> where

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:26.760 
see the pitting on the on the cam where

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:34.220 
see the pitting on the on the cam where
the<00:03:27.660> felt<00:03:28.350> said<00:03:28.710> set<00:03:31.940> these<00:03:32.940> felt<00:03:33.300> sits<00:03:33.570> at<00:03:33.840> one

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
the felt said set these felt sits at one

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.580 
the felt said set these felt sits at one
on<00:03:34.500> the<00:03:34.740> cam<00:03:35.480> you<00:03:36.480> can<00:03:36.630> see<00:03:36.750> where<00:03:36.900> it's<00:03:37.110> at<00:03:37.320> and

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
on the cam you can see where it's at and

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.220 
on the cam you can see where it's at and
then<00:03:37.770> they<00:03:37.950> just<00:03:38.220> did<00:03:38.370> pity<00:03:38.580> so<00:03:38.910> I<00:03:38.940> guess<00:03:39.210> it<00:03:39.390> it

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
then they just did pity so I guess it it

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.580 
then they just did pity so I guess it it
eight<00:03:40.410> in<00:03:40.620> oil<00:03:41.480> sometimes<00:03:42.480> has<00:03:42.840> a<00:03:42.870> little<00:03:43.110> acid

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
eight in oil sometimes has a little acid

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.800 
eight in oil sometimes has a little acid
on<00:03:43.740> it<00:03:43.770> a<00:03:44.040> little<00:03:44.730> pitting<00:03:45.180> in<00:03:45.300> there<00:03:45.480> but<00:03:45.690> it's

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
on it a little pitting in there but it's

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:48.230 
on it a little pitting in there but it's
got<00:03:46.290> a<00:03:46.320> shine<00:03:46.680> on<00:03:46.710> it<00:03:47.070> and<00:03:47.220> I<00:03:47.550> think<00:03:48.090> with<00:03:48.210> a

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:48.240 
got a shine on it and I think with a

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:49.880 
got a shine on it and I think with a
little<00:03:48.330> grease<00:03:48.690> on<00:03:48.900> it<00:03:49.050> it<00:03:49.200> might<00:03:49.440> actually

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
little grease on it it might actually

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.920 
little grease on it it might actually
work<00:03:50.400> we'll<00:03:50.610> give<00:03:50.760> it<00:03:50.790> a<00:03:50.970> try<00:03:51.240> oh<00:03:53.780> by<00:03:54.780> the<00:03:54.810> way

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
work we'll give it a try oh by the way

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.380 
work we'll give it a try oh by the way
these<00:03:55.260> aren't<00:03:55.590> straight<00:03:56.340> bolts<00:03:57.150> that's

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
these aren't straight bolts that's

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.420 
these aren't straight bolts that's
actually<00:03:57.870> all<00:03:58.080> thread<00:03:58.470> and<00:03:58.740> I<00:03:58.800> put<00:03:59.010> a<00:03:59.040> nut<00:03:59.310> on

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
actually all thread and I put a nut on

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.140 
actually all thread and I put a nut on
top<00:04:00.140> you<00:04:01.140> could<00:04:01.320> use<00:04:01.560> bolts<00:04:02.280> there<00:04:02.520> but<00:04:03.000> you

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
top you could use bolts there but you

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.230 
top you could use bolts there but you
make<00:04:03.330> sure<00:04:03.360> I<00:04:03.540> have<00:04:03.660> to<00:04:03.780> make<00:04:03.900> sure<00:04:04.080> they're

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:05.240 
make sure I have to make sure they're

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.960 
make sure I have to make sure they're
there<00:04:06.240> cut<00:04:07.310> so<00:04:08.310> they<00:04:08.430> don't<00:04:08.610> go<00:04:08.760> much<00:04:08.940> deeper

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
there cut so they don't go much deeper

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:12.440 
there cut so they don't go much deeper
than<00:04:09.570> the<00:04:09.750> depth<00:04:09.990> of<00:04:10.290> this<00:04:11.150> flange<00:04:12.150> here

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
than the depth of this flange here

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:16.910 
than the depth of this flange here
because<00:04:12.660> you<00:04:12.780> don't<00:04:13.020> want<00:04:13.230> to<00:04:13.320> chew<00:04:13.560> up<00:04:15.920> all

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:16.920 
because you don't want to chew up all

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.570 
because you don't want to chew up all
this<00:04:17.310> stuff<00:04:17.489> which<00:04:17.910> sits<00:04:18.239> down<00:04:18.480> in<00:04:18.750> here<00:04:19.580> with

this stuff which sits down in here with

this stuff which sits down in here with
this<00:04:20.760> over<00:04:21.150> it<00:04:21.299> you<00:04:21.510> don't<00:04:21.660> want<00:04:21.810> to<00:04:21.870> chew<00:04:22.049> up

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
this over it you don't want to chew up

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.920 
this over it you don't want to chew up
these<00:04:22.380> coils<00:04:22.710> folks<00:04:23.190> I<00:04:23.600> mean<00:04:24.600> they<00:04:24.750> might

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:24.930 
these coils folks I mean they might

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.720 
these coils folks I mean they might
already<00:04:25.110> be<00:04:25.320> bad<00:04:25.650> already<00:04:26.010> but<00:04:26.280> I'm<00:04:26.400> hoping

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:26.730 
already be bad already but I'm hoping

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:33.050 
already be bad already but I'm hoping
I'm<00:04:27.090> hoping<00:04:27.480> they're<00:04:27.690> good<00:04:29.720> that's<00:04:31.820> it<00:04:32.820> for

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
I'm hoping they're good that's it for

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:36.500 
I'm hoping they're good that's it for
this<00:04:33.150> video<00:04:33.390> I'm<00:04:33.780> kind<00:04:34.050> of<00:04:34.760> gaining<00:04:35.760> expertise

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:36.510 
this video I'm kind of gaining expertise

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:40.550
