00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.080 
not it's sort of like it it is but it's

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.920 
not it's sort of like it it is but it's
not<00:03:44.380> because<00:03:44.709> it<00:03:45.160> is<00:03:45.519> in<00:03:45.820> a<00:03:45.880> way<00:03:45.910> but<00:03:46.450> it<00:03:46.600> is<00:03:46.720> not

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
not because it is in a way but it is not

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.080 
not because it is in a way but it is not
in<00:03:47.140> a<00:03:47.230> way<00:03:47.350> revolutionary<00:03:48.280> but<00:03:48.580> the<00:03:48.820> Apple<00:03:49.000> are

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
in a way revolutionary but the Apple are

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:50.759 
in a way revolutionary but the Apple are
pretty<00:03:49.299> much<00:03:49.420> does<00:03:49.690> everything<00:03:50.440> that<00:03:50.590> the

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:50.769 
pretty much does everything that the

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:54.090 
pretty much does everything that the
iphone<00:03:51.310> can<00:03:51.850> do<00:03:52.060> a<00:03:52.360> little<00:03:53.170> bit<00:03:53.320> better<00:03:53.440> but

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.100 
iphone can do a little bit better but

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.710 
iphone can do a little bit better but
the<00:03:54.220> apple<00:03:54.430> can<00:03:54.519> already<00:03:54.640> do<00:03:54.850> it<00:03:54.970> so<00:03:55.420> it's<00:03:55.570> not

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
the apple can already do it so it's not

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.420 
the apple can already do it so it's not
really<00:03:55.780> that<00:03:56.049> much<00:03:56.110> that<00:03:56.470> that<00:03:56.830> revolutionary

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
really that much that that revolutionary

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:59.640 
really that much that that revolutionary
has<00:03:57.850> multitouch<00:03:58.420> the<00:03:58.810> iphone<00:03:59.140> has<00:03:59.230> multitouch

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
has multitouch the iphone has multitouch

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.770 
has multitouch the iphone has multitouch
so<00:04:00.430> i<00:04:00.700> don't<00:04:01.860> think<00:04:02.860> that<00:04:03.070> you<00:04:03.190> guys<00:04:03.220> should

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:09.850
