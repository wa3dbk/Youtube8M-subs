on youtube it's very simple you just go

00:00:32.769 --> 00:00:36.690 
on youtube it's very simple you just go

is<00:00:49.660> a<00:00:49.690> really<00:00:50.020> neat<00:00:50.170> trick<00:00:50.410> but<00:00:50.620> you'll<00:00:50.800> have

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:50.920 
is a really neat trick but you'll have

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.010 
is a really neat trick but you'll have
to<00:00:50.980> have<00:00:51.219> screen<00:00:51.760> demo<00:00:51.940> which<00:00:52.210> is<00:00:52.390> two<00:00:52.629> dollars

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:53.020 
to have screen demo which is two dollars

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.380 
to have screen demo which is two dollars
but<00:00:53.199> this<00:00:53.829> software<00:00:54.610> for<00:00:54.879> the<00:00:54.910> proximity

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:55.390 
but this software for the proximity

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:00.150 
but this software for the proximity
sensor<00:00:56.340> beta<00:00:57.340> so<00:00:57.760> I<00:00:57.789> warn<00:00:58.329> you<00:00:58.449> before<00:00:59.440> you<00:00:59.949> try

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:00.160 
sensor beta so I warn you before you try

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.529 
sensor beta so I warn you before you try
to<00:01:00.219> get<00:01:00.430> it<00:01:00.550> so<00:01:00.730> let<00:01:00.969> me<00:01:01.059> show<00:01:01.149> you<00:01:01.180> what<00:01:01.359> it<00:01:01.449> is

00:01:01.529 --> 00:01:01.539 
to get it so let me show you what it is

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:05.430 
to get it so let me show you what it is
so<00:01:02.160> you<00:01:03.160> see<00:01:03.399> there's<00:01:03.850> a<00:01:03.910> settings<00:01:04.330> panel<00:01:04.479> and

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:05.440 
so you see there's a settings panel and

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.020 
so you see there's a settings panel and
you<00:01:05.530> see<00:01:05.800> my<00:01:05.950> proximity<00:01:06.369> sensor<00:01:06.880> is<00:01:07.440> glowing

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
you see my proximity sensor is glowing

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.540 
you see my proximity sensor is glowing
you<00:01:10.030> can<00:01:10.240> try<00:01:10.360> can't<00:01:10.569> see<00:01:11.050> it<00:01:11.170> well<00:01:11.550> just

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:12.550 
you can try can't see it well just

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:14.130 
you can try can't see it well just
physically<00:01:13.179> back<00:01:13.390> and<00:01:13.420> see<00:01:13.750> it<00:01:13.780> through<00:01:13.899> a

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
physically back and see it through a

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.380 
physically back and see it through a
computer<00:01:14.500> screen<00:01:14.679> but<00:01:15.009> you<00:01:15.580> can<00:01:15.880> see<00:01:16.149> there<00:01:16.360> is

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
computer screen but you can see there is

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.169 
computer screen but you can see there is
um<00:01:16.690> a<00:01:16.899> settings<00:01:17.440> panel<00:01:17.619> and<00:01:17.979> you<00:01:18.550> can<00:01:18.729> enable<00:01:18.970> a

00:01:19.169 --> 00:01:19.179 
um a settings panel and you can enable a

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:20.730 
um a settings panel and you can enable a
disabled<00:01:19.599> it<00:01:19.690> because<00:01:19.929> it's<00:01:20.200> screen<00:01:20.530> dimmer

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:20.740 
disabled it because it's screen dimmer

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.919 
disabled it because it's screen dimmer
and<00:01:21.009> then<00:01:21.190> you<00:01:21.399> see<00:01:21.759> right<00:01:22.030> here<00:01:22.270> proximity

00:01:22.919 --> 00:01:22.929 
and then you see right here proximity

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:25.469 
and then you see right here proximity
sensor<00:01:23.200> only<00:01:23.410> private<00:01:23.860> for<00:01:24.130> now<00:01:24.369> it<00:01:24.970> says<00:01:25.149> will

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:25.479 
sensor only private for now it says will

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:27.660 
sensor only private for now it says will
turn<00:01:25.720> on<00:01:26.020> the<00:01:26.470> display<00:01:26.830> on<00:01:27.069> and<00:01:27.280> on<00:01:27.369> via

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
turn on the display on and on via

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.490 
turn on the display on and on via
proximity<00:01:28.539> sensor<00:01:28.869> this<00:01:29.080> is<00:01:29.200> a<00:01:29.229> bit

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
proximity sensor this is a bit

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.440 
proximity sensor this is a bit
experimental<00:01:29.950> of<00:01:30.220> it<00:01:30.340> and<00:01:30.910> it<00:01:30.970> won't<00:01:31.149> have<00:01:31.270> any

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
experimental of it and it won't have any

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.559 
experimental of it and it won't have any
impact<00:01:31.720> on<00:01:32.200> battery<00:01:32.349> life<00:01:32.740> so<00:01:33.489> this<00:01:34.179> what

00:01:34.559 --> 00:01:34.569 
impact on battery life so this what

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:38.279 
impact on battery life so this what
basically<00:01:34.959> does<00:01:35.259> is<00:01:35.530> do<00:01:36.429> a<00:01:36.810> smart<00:01:37.810> cover<00:01:38.020> for

00:01:38.279 --> 00:01:38.289 
basically does is do a smart cover for

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:42.089 
basically does is do a smart cover for
iphone<00:01:38.679> so<00:01:38.920> I'm<00:01:39.009> gonna<00:01:40.470> you<00:01:41.470> see<00:01:41.739> it

00:01:42.089 --> 00:01:42.099 
iphone so I'm gonna you see it

00:01:42.099 --> 00:01:44.850 
iphone so I'm gonna you see it
disappeared<00:01:42.610> and<00:01:42.759> it<00:01:43.119> came<00:01:43.300> back<00:01:43.360> on<00:01:43.630> now<00:01:44.349> it

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:44.860 
disappeared and it came back on now it

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.449 
disappeared and it came back on now it
works<00:01:45.099> with<00:01:45.250> my<00:01:45.340> finger<00:01:46.679> it<00:01:47.679> works<00:01:48.009> with<00:01:48.250> this

00:01:48.449 --> 00:01:48.459 
works with my finger it works with this

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:54.029 
works with my finger it works with this
napkin<00:01:50.580> and<00:01:51.989> it<00:01:52.989> works<00:01:53.200> with<00:01:53.380> any<00:01:53.470> other<00:01:53.739> cover

00:01:54.029 --> 00:01:54.039 
napkin and it works with any other cover

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:57.540 
napkin and it works with any other cover
you<00:01:54.340> just<00:01:54.700> have<00:01:54.910> to<00:01:55.170> hide<00:01:56.170> that<00:01:56.440> little<00:01:56.950> sensor

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:57.550 
you just have to hide that little sensor

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:02.279 
you just have to hide that little sensor
bar<00:01:57.789> on<00:01:57.940> top<00:01:59.369> and<00:02:00.369> it<00:02:01.239> doesn't<00:02:01.569> do<00:02:01.720> anything<00:02:02.110> it

00:02:02.279 --> 00:02:02.289 
bar on top and it doesn't do anything it

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:04.109 
bar on top and it doesn't do anything it
just<00:02:02.319> closes<00:02:02.739> out<00:02:03.069> it<00:02:03.220> doesn't<00:02:03.369> lock<00:02:03.670> it<00:02:03.879> it's

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:04.119 
just closes out it doesn't lock it it's

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:07.380 
just closes out it doesn't lock it it's
pretty<00:02:04.840> neat<00:02:05.140> but<00:02:05.379> I<00:02:05.800> don't<00:02:06.729> think<00:02:06.910> apple<00:02:07.360> will

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
pretty neat but I don't think apple will

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.250 
pretty neat but I don't think apple will
take<00:02:07.959> this<00:02:08.140> to<00:02:08.550> take<00:02:09.550> this<00:02:09.759> to<00:02:10.119> actual<00:02:10.690> concept
