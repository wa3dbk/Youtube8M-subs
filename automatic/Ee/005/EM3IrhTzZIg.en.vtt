and this is the version that is on my
YouTube<00:00:10.620> already<00:00:10.889> some<00:00:11.460> people<00:00:11.759> have<00:00:11.849> been

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
YouTube already some people have been

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:13.940 
YouTube already some people have been
asking<00:00:12.059> me<00:00:12.360> for<00:00:12.630> the<00:00:12.690> notes<00:00:13.200> for<00:00:13.559> it<00:00:13.740> and

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
asking me for the notes for it and

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.050 
asking me for the notes for it and
basically<00:00:14.639> I<00:00:14.940> use<00:00:15.299> in<00:00:15.770> guitar<00:00:16.770> the<00:00:17.670> guitar

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
basically I use in guitar the guitar

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.480 
basically I use in guitar the guitar
chords<00:00:18.900> will<00:00:19.289> they<00:00:19.439> sell<00:00:19.680> out<00:00:19.710> like<00:00:20.010> guitar

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
chords will they sell out like guitar

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.570 
chords will they sell out like guitar
chords<00:00:20.850> and<00:00:21.650> so<00:00:22.650> it's<00:00:23.130> a<00:00:23.250> little<00:00:23.460> bit

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
chords and so it's a little bit

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.790 
chords and so it's a little bit
difficult<00:00:23.760> to<00:00:24.000> send<00:00:24.750> people<00:00:25.170> the<00:00:25.289> notes<00:00:25.500> and

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
difficult to send people the notes and

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.060 
difficult to send people the notes and
stuff<00:00:26.070> so<00:00:26.310> I'm<00:00:26.519> gonna<00:00:26.670> do<00:00:26.939> this<00:00:27.119> tutorial<00:00:27.660> to

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:28.070 
stuff so I'm gonna do this tutorial to

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.290 
stuff so I'm gonna do this tutorial to
hopefully<00:00:29.070> explain<00:00:29.340> it<00:00:29.550> a<00:00:29.580> bit<00:00:29.640> better<00:00:29.880> I<00:00:30.150> will

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
hopefully explain it a bit better I will

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:37.040 
hopefully explain it a bit better I will
post<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:32.750> the<00:00:33.750> sheet<00:00:34.020> with<00:00:34.260> all<00:00:34.469> the<00:00:36.050> the

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
but I'm just gonna do a quick

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.290 
but I'm just gonna do a quick
explanation<00:00:47.430> of<00:00:48.000> how<00:00:48.680> what<00:00:50.149> chords<00:00:51.149> have

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
explanation of how what chords have

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.700 
explanation of how what chords have
which<00:00:51.510> notes<00:00:51.780> in<00:00:52.140> and<00:00:53.120> have<00:00:54.120> to<00:00:54.300> sort<00:00:54.539> of<00:00:54.710> play

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
which notes in and have to sort of play

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.799 
which notes in and have to sort of play
them<00:00:55.920> I<00:00:56.070> suppose<00:00:56.660> right<00:00:58.100> first<00:00:59.100> of<00:00:59.340> all<00:00:59.489> for<00:00:59.969> b2

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
them I suppose right first of all for b2

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.350 
them I suppose right first of all for b2
which<00:01:01.739> is<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.750> first<00:01:03.750> chord<00:01:04.320> that<00:01:04.500> you<00:01:04.619> need<00:01:04.830> I

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
which is the first chord that you need I

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.740 
which is the first chord that you need I
use<00:01:06.360> these<00:01:06.600> two<00:01:06.869> B's<00:01:07.140> here<00:01:07.500> in<00:01:07.710> my<00:01:07.860> left<00:01:07.979> hand

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
use these two B's here in my left hand

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.210 
use these two B's here in my left hand
and<00:01:09.750> then<00:01:09.900> C<00:01:10.200> sharp<00:01:11.000> d<00:01:12.000> sharp

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
and then C sharp d sharp

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:18.220 
and then C sharp d sharp
and<00:01:13.310> f-sharp<00:01:14.000> and<00:01:16.270> this<00:01:17.270> is<00:01:17.510> the<00:01:17.900> sort<00:01:18.200> of

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:18.230 
and f-sharp and this is the sort of

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:27.760 
and f-sharp and this is the sort of
pattern<00:01:18.470> I<00:01:25.480> just

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
pattern I just

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:41.139 
pattern I just
and<00:01:28.189> then<00:01:28.400> does<00:01:28.880> this<00:01:29.060> be<00:01:29.299> up<00:01:29.479> here

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:41.149 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:45.260 

and<00:01:42.149> then<00:01:42.299> you<00:01:42.659> want<00:01:42.840> to<00:01:42.930> go<00:01:43.080> to<00:01:43.610> the<00:01:44.610> F<00:01:44.850> sharp

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
and then you want to go to the F sharp

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.300 
and then you want to go to the F sharp
which<00:01:45.869> is<00:01:46.259> just<00:01:47.509> these<00:01:48.590> these<00:01:49.590> two<00:01:49.649> F<00:01:49.950> sharps

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
which is just these these two F sharps

00:01:50.310 --> 00:02:00.399 
which is just these these two F sharps
here<00:01:50.369> a<00:01:50.840> sharp<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:52.110> C<00:01:52.350> sharp

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:29.479 

and<00:02:01.409> then<00:02:01.770> for<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.039> D<00:02:02.280> sharp<00:02:03.469> -7<00:02:04.520> you<00:02:05.520> won<00:02:28.489> and

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:29.489 
and then for the D sharp -7 you won and

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:36.770 
and then for the D sharp -7 you won and
then<00:02:30.450> you<00:02:30.930> just<00:02:31.200> go<00:02:34.340> you'll<00:02:35.340> see<00:02:35.640> which<00:02:36.480> notes

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
then you just go you'll see which notes

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.600 
then you just go you'll see which notes
to<00:02:37.049> play<00:02:37.200> this<00:02:37.440> isn't<00:02:37.769> so<00:02:37.920> much<00:02:37.950> explaining

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
to play this isn't so much explaining

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.130 
to play this isn't so much explaining
which<00:02:38.730> notes<00:02:38.970> to<00:02:39.150> play<00:02:39.329> at<00:02:39.420> what<00:02:39.569> time<00:02:39.810> because

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
which notes to play at what time because

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.199 
which notes to play at what time because
that<00:02:40.290> will<00:02:40.470> be<00:02:40.590> in<00:02:40.769> the<00:02:40.890> video<00:02:41.130> description

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
that will be in the video description

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:46.580 
that will be in the video description
this<00:02:42.209> is<00:02:42.390> just<00:02:42.569> explaining<00:02:44.480> the<00:02:45.480> makeup<00:02:46.440> of

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
this is just explaining the makeup of

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.530 
this is just explaining the makeup of
the<00:02:46.739> chords<00:02:47.130> and<00:02:47.340> sort<00:02:48.000> of<00:02:48.090> the<00:02:48.150> pattern<00:02:48.329> that

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
the chords and sort of the pattern that

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.800 
the chords and sort of the pattern that
I<00:02:48.599> play<00:02:48.840> in<00:02:49.079> and<00:02:49.400> so<00:02:50.400> that's<00:02:50.880> all<00:02:51.239> the<00:02:51.450> chords

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:51.810 
I play in and so that's all the chords

00:02:51.810 --> 00:03:22.130 
I play in and so that's all the chords
for<00:02:52.140> the<00:02:52.200> first<00:02:53.239> verse<00:02:54.239> so<00:02:55.400> you<00:02:56.400> have<00:02:56.579> like

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:32.730 

never<00:03:23.280> bridge<00:03:24.280> of<00:03:30.960> and<00:03:31.960> then<00:03:32.140> you've<00:03:32.290> got<00:03:32.500> this

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:32.740 
never bridge of and then you've got this

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:37.170 
never bridge of and then you've got this
see<00:03:33.070> shot<00:03:33.400> which<00:03:33.730> I<00:03:34.060> use<00:03:34.930> these<00:03:35.880> hands<00:03:36.880> and
