how<00:02:16.709> fast<00:02:16.950> we<00:02:17.250> can<00:02:17.519> get<00:02:17.700> this<00:02:17.880> 260<00:02:18.239> can<00:02:18.600> we<00:02:18.690> do

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
how fast we can get this 260 can we do

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.420 
how fast we can get this 260 can we do
it<00:02:18.900> in<00:02:18.989> under<00:02:19.049> five<00:02:19.350> seconds<00:02:19.799> the<00:02:20.220> car

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
it in under five seconds the car

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.430 
it in under five seconds the car
magazine<00:02:20.910> say<00:02:21.120> it's<00:02:21.299> just<00:02:21.600> around<00:02:21.810> four<00:02:22.200> I

magazine say it's just around four I

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:26.030 
magazine say it's just around four I
think<00:02:22.950> we<00:02:23.010> can<00:02:23.130> do<00:02:23.280> it<00:02:23.400> here<00:02:23.700> we<00:02:23.760> go<00:02:23.940> oh<00:02:25.010> ha<00:02:26.010> ha

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
think we can do it here we go oh ha ha

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.480 
think we can do it here we go oh ha ha
ha<00:02:26.519> ha<00:02:26.790> ha<00:02:27.060> so<00:02:27.750> what<00:02:27.989> the<00:02:28.140> oh<00:02:28.170> we're

however<00:04:13.230> it's<00:04:13.500> not<00:04:13.620> supposed<00:04:13.980> to<00:04:14.069> be<00:04:14.190> it's<00:04:14.280> not

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:16.829 
a race car it's a GT and for that I

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:19.039 
a race car it's a GT and for that I
think<00:04:17.280> the<00:04:17.430> balance<00:04:17.609> the<00:04:18.299> steering<00:04:18.720> and<00:04:18.900> even

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
think the balance the steering and even

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:26.520 
think the balance the steering and even
the<00:04:19.139> braking<00:04:19.500> are<00:04:19.709> fine

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530
