 Hello everyone, everything good 

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:15.680
 I came back to you today, it 's not taking away. 

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:19.039
 some doubts about the garden book 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:23.240
 and show the order by painting with 

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:25.010
 The materials of the diamond are my body. 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:28.190

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:30.140

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:31.910

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.920

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:43.550
 designed the first page but I'm 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:45.290
 of course in the middle of truth and I think 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.390
 It is said the day before he is in 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:51.140

 Great you can also find 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:59.000
 and I confess to you that I bought 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.940
 You're painting I could think of 45 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.309
 years of faber castell finally right after 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:07.219
 round the whole river of January I found 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:10.130
 only I had this one had no in 

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:12.979
 Glory that I went but so get 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:21.799
 to know if I also bought this side 

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:24.219
 I draw a color question and it's for 

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:24.219

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:28.310

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:32.270

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:34.670

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:36.619
 look how beautiful people are very beautiful 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.599
 I was crazy about these ones getting a little 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:42.319
 Difficult to find I only found clarity 

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:43.789
 It is also and it was not that big not 

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:47.990
 I could think that there is a need in 

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:51.200
 The good thing about the sammy bakery is that it is 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:54.369
 more so big than it got to do here 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.369

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.909
 solution that left him more than 

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:00.770
 write paper they do not go through 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:02.689
 other side of the sheet that I will too're 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:06.200
 I use it to paint because I thought it was going to work. 

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:08.450
 inspect the book's roses accounts 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.000
 It's in this, I really like 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.830
 rose and hear sing of pink so I 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.660
 I thought it would be cool, I did a test. 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.120
 really does not go through the 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:20.629
 sheet legal agency has people who have 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.280
 the Chinese who watch videos and 

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:23.870
 a tip you are also trying to 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.549

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.860

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:35.150

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:37.400
 Look what I fight and your computer 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.670
 if you are seeing is a mirror on 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.579
 the camera is not a mirror and the editor 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:46.880
 feels so cute 

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:49.190
 oh how cute, very cute, I was very 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:50.930
 order to buy what I found the people 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.180
 I had come here on the internet, but then I 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.500

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.819

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.420
 questioned by him 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:03:01.519

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:11.000

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.269

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:16.880
 You and I have not seen anyone else. 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:18.260
