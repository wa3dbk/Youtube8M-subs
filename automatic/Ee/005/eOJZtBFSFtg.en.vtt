thought it like there was a chance he

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.730 
thought it like there was a chance he
could've<00:00:27.420> but<00:00:27.660> metagross<00:00:28.140> is<00:00:28.349> still<00:00:28.560> pretty

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740

bulky in that full-life it against a
steel-type<00:00:32.099> like<00:00:32.460> and<00:00:32.730> it<00:00:33.120> just<00:00:33.300> didn't<00:00:33.540> feel

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
steel-type like and it just didn't feel

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.810 
steel-type like and it just didn't feel
good<00:00:33.809> but<00:00:34.590> that's<00:00:35.070> what<00:00:35.130> he<00:00:35.250> went<00:00:35.370> for<00:00:35.550> I'm

for<00:03:02.530> no<00:03:02.680> reason<00:03:03.160> cuz<00:03:03.730> that<00:03:04.090> extra<00:03:04.480> life<00:03:04.690> of

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
for no reason cuz that extra life of

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.080 
for no reason cuz that extra life of
recoil<00:03:05.290> or<00:03:05.590> potential<00:03:06.070> close<00:03:06.280> combat<00:03:06.550> defense

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
recoil or potential close combat defense

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.270 
recoil or potential close combat defense
lowering<00:03:07.540> wasn't<00:03:07.870> gonna<00:03:07.959> help<00:03:08.260> me<00:03:08.440> so

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
lowering wasn't gonna help me so

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.240 
lowering wasn't gonna help me so
whatever<00:03:10.090> I<00:03:10.510> go<00:03:11.320> to<00:03:11.410> bliss<00:03:11.650> I<00:03:11.890> still<00:03:12.130> don't

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
whatever I go to bliss I still don't

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:14.759 
whatever I go to bliss I still don't
know<00:03:12.280> what<00:03:12.370> his<00:03:12.519> last<00:03:12.760> is<00:03:13.180> at<00:03:13.330> this<00:03:13.450> point<00:03:13.769> yes

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:14.769 
know what his last is at this point yes

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:16.380 
know what his last is at this point yes
in<00:03:14.980> the<00:03:15.010> little<00:03:15.250> corner<00:03:15.549> that<00:03:15.640> shows<00:03:15.910> melodic

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
in the little corner that shows melodic

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.030 
in the little corner that shows melodic
but<00:03:16.510> at<00:03:16.600> this<00:03:16.750> point<00:03:16.959> in<00:03:17.110> time<00:03:17.140> I<00:03:17.350> did<00:03:17.620> not<00:03:17.769> know

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.040 
but at this point in time I did not know

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:21.990 
but at this point in time I did not know
that<00:03:18.630> so<00:03:19.980> you<00:03:20.980> know<00:03:21.100> whatever<00:03:21.310> bliss<00:03:21.790> he's

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
that so you know whatever bliss he's

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.250 
that so you know whatever bliss he's
just<00:03:22.180> coming<00:03:22.330> in<00:03:22.480> here<00:03:22.630> and<00:03:22.750> shadow<00:03:22.930> balling

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
just coming in here and shadow balling

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.199 
just coming in here and shadow balling
for<00:03:23.290> the<00:03:23.470> win<00:03:23.620> and<00:03:23.890> the<00:03:24.580> fact<00:03:24.820> that<00:03:24.850> he<00:03:24.970> goes<00:03:25.090> to

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
for the win and the fact that he goes to

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:27.630 
for the win and the fact that he goes to
gang<00:03:25.420> gar<00:03:25.660> instead<00:03:26.260> of<00:03:26.410> his<00:03:26.739> sixth<00:03:27.250> makes<00:03:27.519> me

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
gang gar instead of his sixth makes me

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.340 
gang gar instead of his sixth makes me
think<00:03:27.850> oh<00:03:27.940> that<00:03:28.360> means<00:03:28.630> his<00:03:28.840> sixth<00:03:29.260> is

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:29.350 
think oh that means his sixth is

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:30.930 
think oh that means his sixth is
probably<00:03:29.739> beaten<00:03:30.100> by<00:03:30.250> blissey<00:03:30.640> because<00:03:30.820> he

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
probably beaten by blissey because he

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.460 
probably beaten by blissey because he
knows<00:03:31.090> this<00:03:31.299> is<00:03:31.450> not<00:03:31.660> a<00:03:31.690> winning<00:03:31.930> scenario

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
knows this is not a winning scenario

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:35.039 
knows this is not a winning scenario
unless<00:03:33.250> he<00:03:33.400> gets<00:03:33.489> a<00:03:33.640> crit<00:03:33.850> that<00:03:34.720> special

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 
unless he gets a crit that special

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:36.570 
unless he gets a crit that special
defense<00:03:35.260> drop<00:03:35.500> doesn't<00:03:35.799> really<00:03:36.160> matter

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:36.580 
defense drop doesn't really matter

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.690 
defense drop doesn't really matter
because<00:03:37.180> I<00:03:37.360> can't<00:03:37.630> to<00:03:37.780> hit<00:03:37.930> KO<00:03:38.110> anyway<00:03:38.560> I<00:03:38.799> guess

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
because I can't to hit KO anyway I guess

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.729 
because I can't to hit KO anyway I guess
now<00:03:39.970> with<00:03:40.180> a<00:03:40.209> drop<00:03:40.570> i<00:03:40.750> can<00:03:40.930> to<00:03:41.049> hit<00:03:41.230> KO<00:03:41.410> but

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
now with a drop i can to hit KO but

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:43.680 
now with a drop i can to hit KO but
because<00:03:41.980> of<00:03:42.010> pain<00:03:42.310> split<00:03:42.730> and<00:03:42.910> all<00:03:43.180> that<00:03:43.480> jazz

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:43.690 
because of pain split and all that jazz

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:45.930 
because of pain split and all that jazz
you<00:03:44.380> know<00:03:44.500> whatever<00:03:44.709> it<00:03:45.220> doesn't<00:03:45.519> change<00:03:45.760> the

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
you know whatever it doesn't change the

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.060 
you know whatever it doesn't change the
way<00:03:46.090> his<00:03:46.870> sequence<00:03:47.320> needs<00:03:47.560> to<00:03:47.650> get<00:03:47.799> played<00:03:48.040> out

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:48.070 
way his sequence needs to get played out

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:49.890 
way his sequence needs to get played out
so<00:03:48.640> I<00:03:48.940> guess<00:03:49.120> that's<00:03:49.239> really<00:03:49.510> what<00:03:49.630> I'm<00:03:49.720> trying

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
so I guess that's really what I'm trying

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.039 
so I guess that's really what I'm trying
to<00:03:49.930> get<00:03:50.110> to<00:03:50.380> here<00:03:50.769> so<00:03:51.540> I'm<00:03:52.540> just<00:03:52.750> kind<00:03:52.930> of<00:03:52.989> going

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049 
to get to here so I'm just kind of going

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:55.470 
to get to here so I'm just kind of going
along<00:03:53.260> you<00:03:53.650> know<00:03:53.769> healing<00:03:54.160> up<00:03:54.340> trying<00:03:55.330> to<00:03:55.360> make

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:55.480 
along you know healing up trying to make

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:56.910 
along you know healing up trying to make
sure<00:03:55.510> that<00:03:55.780> I<00:03:55.810> can<00:03:55.959> still<00:03:56.230> survive<00:03:56.500> a<00:03:56.560> crit

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:56.920 
sure that I can still survive a crit

00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.340 
sure that I can still survive a crit
which<00:03:57.100> will<00:03:57.250> do<00:03:57.400> approximately<00:03:58.350> eighty

00:03:59.340 --> 00:03:59.350 
which will do approximately eighty

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:00.840 
which will do approximately eighty
percent<00:03:59.620> I<00:04:00.040> mean<00:04:00.160> eighty<00:04:00.340> percent<00:04:00.519> would<00:04:00.730> be

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:00.850 
percent I mean eighty percent would be

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:03.180 
percent I mean eighty percent would be
the<00:04:00.970> high<00:04:01.180> end<00:04:01.420> of<00:04:01.720> you<00:04:01.989> know<00:04:02.110> two<00:04:02.170> hits<00:04:02.530> so

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
the high end of you know two hits so

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.250 
the high end of you know two hits so
happy<00:04:03.430> the<00:04:03.519> high<00:04:03.670> end<00:04:03.790> of<00:04:03.970> a<00:04:04.030> crit<00:04:04.269> but<00:04:04.600> I<00:04:04.810> just

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
happy the high end of a crit but I just

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:06.420 
happy the high end of a crit but I just
wanna<00:04:05.440> you<00:04:05.680> know<00:04:05.799> that's<00:04:06.130> my<00:04:06.250> little

his HP and you know seeing if you can
use<00:04:12.270> a<00:04:12.300> sub<00:04:12.570> or<00:04:12.720> not<00:04:12.840> based<00:04:13.110> on<00:04:13.290> how<00:04:13.440> I<00:04:13.470> want<00:04:13.740> to

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:13.830 
use a sub or not based on how I want to

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:15.710 
use a sub or not based on how I want to
go<00:04:13.920> around<00:04:14.070> through<00:04:14.370> this<00:04:14.460> area<00:04:14.700> just<00:04:15.420> making

go around through this area just making

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.949 
go around through this area just making
sure<00:04:15.810> I<00:04:15.870> don't<00:04:15.960> get<00:04:16.140> credit<00:04:16.320> really<00:04:16.940> so

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:17.959 
sure I don't get credit really so

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:19.970 
sure I don't get credit really so
because<00:04:18.959> I<00:04:19.050> have<00:04:19.170> a<00:04:19.200> good<00:04:19.380> feeling<00:04:19.560> that

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:19.980 
because I have a good feeling that

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.610 
because I have a good feeling that
whatever<00:04:20.790> he<00:04:21.120> is<00:04:21.150> he's<00:04:21.510> going<00:04:21.660> to<00:04:21.720> use<00:04:21.989> is

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
whatever he is he's going to use is

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.170 
whatever he is he's going to use is
going<00:04:22.890> to<00:04:22.950> lose<00:04:23.160> to<00:04:23.430> bliss<00:04:23.610> which<00:04:23.880> is<00:04:24.000> why<00:04:24.120> you

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:24.180 
going to lose to bliss which is why you

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.200 
going to lose to bliss which is why you
didn't<00:04:24.450> go<00:04:24.570> there<00:04:24.600> so<00:04:25.700> if<00:04:26.700> I<00:04:26.790> get<00:04:26.970> one<00:04:27.150> more

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
didn't go there so if I get one more

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.030 
didn't go there so if I get one more
drop<00:04:27.600> I<00:04:27.810> could<00:04:27.960> potentially<00:04:28.500> one<00:04:28.680> hit<00:04:28.860> KO

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:29.040 
drop I could potentially one hit KO

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:31.340 
drop I could potentially one hit KO
especially<00:04:29.700> after<00:04:29.790> a<00:04:29.940> life<00:04:30.180> orb<00:04:30.420> hit<00:04:30.600> so

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
especially after a life orb hit so

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.140 
especially after a life orb hit so
that'd<00:04:31.470> be<00:04:31.560> nice<00:04:31.710> but<00:04:32.280> you<00:04:32.340> know<00:04:32.550> whatever<00:04:32.760> i

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
that'd be nice but you know whatever i

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.990 
that'd be nice but you know whatever i
still<00:04:34.080> have<00:04:34.170> Lucario<00:04:34.740> of<00:04:34.950> my<00:04:35.100> own<00:04:35.340> hanging<00:04:35.910> out

he<00:04:44.370> certainly<00:04:44.640> used<00:04:44.910> a<00:04:45.030> lot<00:04:45.150> i<00:04:45.210> didn't<00:04:45.480> even

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:45.540 
he certainly used a lot i didn't even

he certainly used a lot i didn't even
start<00:04:45.810> counting<00:04:46.320> but<00:04:46.530> eventually<00:04:47.220> I<00:04:47.460> get<00:04:47.700> it

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:47.790 
start counting but eventually I get it

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:49.610 
start counting but eventually I get it
there<00:04:47.970> I<00:04:48.240> kill<00:04:48.780> him<00:04:48.900> off<00:04:48.990> a<00:04:49.020> Miss<00:04:49.320> if<00:04:49.500> you

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:49.620 
there I kill him off a Miss if you

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:50.900 
there I kill him off a Miss if you
didn't<00:04:49.920> miss<00:04:50.100> I<00:04:50.250> would<00:04:50.370> have<00:04:50.460> been<00:04:50.550> in<00:04:50.580> about

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:50.910 
didn't miss I would have been in about

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:54.440 
didn't miss I would have been in about
sixteen<00:04:51.570> percent<00:04:52.640> sweet<00:04:53.640> twelve<00:04:53.910> percent<00:04:54.210> I

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:54.450 
sixteen percent sweet twelve percent I

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:57.530 
sixteen percent sweet twelve percent I
was<00:04:54.750> afraid<00:04:54.900> if<00:04:55.080> this<00:04:55.200> thing<00:04:55.380> had<00:04:55.530> toxic<00:04:56.450> but<00:04:57.450> I

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:57.540 
was afraid if this thing had toxic but I

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:58.880 
was afraid if this thing had toxic but I
didn't<00:04:57.720> want<00:04:57.840> to<00:04:57.900> go<00:04:57.990> to<00:04:58.020> Luke<00:04:58.260> immediately

00:04:58.880 --> 00:04:58.890 
didn't want to go to Luke immediately

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:01.070 
didn't want to go to Luke immediately
just<00:04:59.070> in<00:04:59.220> case<00:04:59.400> he<00:04:59.430> didn't<00:04:59.940> so<00:05:00.630> I'm<00:05:00.690> gonna<00:05:00.810> soft

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.080 
just in case he didn't so I'm gonna soft

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:03.020 
just in case he didn't so I'm gonna soft
boil<00:05:01.350> now<00:05:01.680> in<00:05:01.890> case<00:05:02.040> he<00:05:02.160> does<00:05:02.340> have<00:05:02.520> toxic

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030 
boil now in case he does have toxic

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:04.820 
boil now in case he does have toxic
turns<00:05:03.750> out<00:05:03.870> he<00:05:03.960> doesn't<00:05:04.170> have<00:05:04.260> toxic<00:05:04.620> at<00:05:04.710> all

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:04.830 
turns out he doesn't have toxic at all

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.580 
turns out he doesn't have toxic at all
so<00:05:05.570> he's<00:05:06.570> just<00:05:06.630> gonna<00:05:06.810> end<00:05:07.050> up<00:05:07.140> for<00:05:07.320> fitting

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
so he's just gonna end up for fitting

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.250 
so he's just gonna end up for fitting
because<00:05:07.650> he<00:05:07.800> knows<00:05:07.950> he<00:05:07.980> can't<00:05:08.340> be<00:05:08.490> bliss<00:05:08.820> and

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:09.260 
because he knows he can't be bliss and

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.240 
because he knows he can't be bliss and
eventually<00:05:10.260> I'm<00:05:10.440> gonna<00:05:10.560> get<00:05:10.800> this<00:05:10.950> thing<00:05:11.010> I

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.250 
eventually I'm gonna get this thing I

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:12.710 
eventually I'm gonna get this thing I
don't<00:05:11.370> know<00:05:11.460> if<00:05:11.520> it's<00:05:11.640> recover<00:05:11.970> arrest<00:05:12.390> i<00:05:12.540> also

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:12.720 
don't know if it's recover arrest i also

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.900 
don't know if it's recover arrest i also
want<00:05:12.990> to<00:05:13.050> figure<00:05:13.170> that<00:05:13.440> out<00:05:13.500> if<00:05:14.460> it's<00:05:14.610> rest

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:14.910 
want to figure that out if it's rest

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:16.910 
want to figure that out if it's rest
i'll<00:05:15.510> have<00:05:15.690> a<00:05:15.720> chance<00:05:16.020> to<00:05:16.140> bring<00:05:16.170> in<00:05:16.470> Lucario

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:16.920 
i'll have a chance to bring in Lucario

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:20.600 
i'll have a chance to bring in Lucario
and<00:05:17.070> SD<00:05:17.430> up<00:05:18.050> if<00:05:19.050> it's<00:05:19.200> not<00:05:19.260> rest<00:05:19.740> I<00:05:20.130> wouldn't

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:20.610 
and SD up if it's not rest I wouldn't

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:22.430 
and SD up if it's not rest I wouldn't
even<00:05:20.670> have<00:05:20.880> to<00:05:20.940> SD<00:05:21.330> I<00:05:21.360> probably<00:05:21.750> just<00:05:21.870> I<00:05:21.960> don't

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:22.440 
even have to SD I probably just I don't

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.080 
even have to SD I probably just I don't
know<00:05:22.590> I<00:05:22.860> don't<00:05:22.980> know<00:05:23.100> what<00:05:23.250> I<00:05:23.280> would<00:05:23.400> do<00:05:23.550> but<00:05:23.970> he

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:24.090 
know I don't know what I would do but he

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:25.970 
know I don't know what I would do but he
knows<00:05:24.270> he<00:05:24.510> can't<00:05:24.690> win<00:05:24.810> eventually<00:05:25.140> so<00:05:25.740> he<00:05:25.860> just

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:25.980 
knows he can't win eventually so he just

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:27.350 
knows he can't win eventually so he just
