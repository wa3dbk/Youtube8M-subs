00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.770
 hi his best go to 16 years 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:08.010
 is found on the game tour de france 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:12.179
 2014 on my tour with katusha 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:15.450
 we are in step 15 between them tal ar and 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.980
 nîmes plain stage with some 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.539
 small difficulties in the beginning but nothing 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.140
 to list so that should pass 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:27.599
 for the sprinters and so we suitcase 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:29.910
 is necessarily a good investment with my 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.679
 present-day christopher sprinters 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.750
 green jersey 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:38.100
 romero jekyll already tried to keep 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:40.320
 comfort him this green jersey and it's from 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:41.870
 make a good final sprint if it happens 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.050
 in the massive sprint 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:52.469
 so I'm going to take christ from the beginning 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:54.750
 we will take the recovery for the first time 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:01:00.780
 step part and red for the 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:05.640
 final sprint if the bubble here is the beginning 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:07.470
 from the tallard stage between the Alps and 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.080
 the pyrenees back i this step 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.330
 is in disappointment our life we see 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.439
 our teammate rodriguez yellow before 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.299
 the cadets of the platoon 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:17.100
 it will take others to learn it vigilance 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.950
 especially in the crossing of the valley 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.689
 Rhone 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:23.149
 opportunity may be risks of 

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:25.430
 borders at risk and possibly 

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:26.840
 borders with wind I have not 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:27.200
 looked at but hey it's marked up at 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.479
 left 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.780
 the side wind that comes from the right 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:35.119
 strong for the moment we'll see if 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.520
 we know and because it gives in the 

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:43.759
 final was invited to meet us at 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:46.399
 intermediate sprint again thanks to 5 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:49.369
 km of the intermediate sprint and a 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:51.560
 breakaway in front of five riders with 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:56.810
 the place enghelab and offredo the eternal 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:02:00.289
 voight and millar I will spend the big 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:03.319
 tray with lists via the points of the 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:04.819
 sixth place to recover anyway I 

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:06.619
 hold me well in the trains of 

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:11.269
 sprinters who are preparing their sprint 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:13.010
 intermediary tried as usual to 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:18.410
 take them by surprise attention two 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:20.000
 faces not lose get block is 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.519
 gone for christophe who does his 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.940
 less effort as usual on 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:24.940
 this turn 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:33.590
 took a little bit of progress I could 

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:35.180
 red but have continued to attack this 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:39.340
 idea nothing where they come back strong who 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:41.450
 come back very strong but it will pass 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.260
 for sixth place points 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:48.620
 just before cavendish interested his 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:53.299
 eve shovel kid and kit is surely 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:56.569
 that of argos jag including very well 

00:02:53.299 --> 00:02:59.030
 good operation for my scooter in 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:00.169
 the optics of his green jersey and that 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:03.349
 we will arrive at the zone of 

00:03:00.169 --> 00:03:05.829
 refueling I'm going to take it to 

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:11.030
 the whole team the refueling as well 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:12.650
 at christophe i hope it's ok 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.269
 still ride in the teams of 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.849
 sprinters to catch up with them 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:17.719
 while he is not too bad 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:19.969
 of small arrivals 

00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:21.650
 however, the positions are not 

00:03:19.969 --> 00:03:23.599
 everything already my team that is going to 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:26.409
 the front is not bad we will end up 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:26.409
 in the end of the stage 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.969
 here we are ten kilometers from Nîmes 

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:34.069
 with christophe the escaped to 24 

00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:37.459
 seconds ahead and not to resist 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:40.519
 it's on trains to get on well 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:42.970
 Place not kill why I rodriguez 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:42.970
 at the front 1 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:51.830
 there against me I asked the woman 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:53.570
 elie to come protect me the breakaway does not 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:56.000
 are not going to break up the peloton is 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:58.640
 launched in pursuit and the spirit and I 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.200
 will try to do better than on all 

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.260
 the other costs of the massif besides the 

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.910
 first art gates I had won 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:07.070
 since since always no victory 

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:08.930
 step for christophe she makes 

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:12.850
 beautiful places of honor but who does not 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.850
 did not impose a second time 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:17.900
 there is apparently what I leave them 

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.940
 still in the comments of 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.380

 take the aspiration of the best 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:32.090

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.980
 will try to do well with eating 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.670
 always to take between two and 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:40.220

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:42.590
