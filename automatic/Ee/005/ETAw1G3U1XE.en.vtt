 dark chocolate and we mix it again 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.540
 we already have the mass ready and we have also 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.940
 prepared the tray to make them 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.890
 muffins is a tray for muffins and 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:14.260
 cupcakes in which we have put these 

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:16.570
 capsules if you do not have the tray you can 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.520
 put two capsules together and so we do not know 

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:19.960
 will open if you want to know the model used 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.330
 I'm using it in what I'm going to leave 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:24.190
 down in a link the description we are going 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:26.040
 to fill the capsules with this 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:29.470
 utensil to make balls of the two 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:32.280
 we eat some dough 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:35.480
 and fill the capsule 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.480
 and so with all 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.380
 we have already finished the whole mass so 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.630
 let's put it in the oven we 're going to 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.370
 leave at 180 degrees with heat on top 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:49.230

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.970
 in my case it has been 25 minutes and 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.790
 our rather is already ready so 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.830
 let's take it out of the oven we'll want 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.990
 to cool down a bit to get it out 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:00.180
 of the tray has already passed a few minutes 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:02.610
 and we were able to remove them from the tray 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.680
 I have also cut one in half for 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.940
 that you can see how it is inside and how 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.290

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.290
