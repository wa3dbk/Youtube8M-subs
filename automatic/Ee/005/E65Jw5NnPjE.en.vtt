00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.760 
even in 5.1 surround sound halo 3 is

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.230 
even in 5.1 surround sound halo 3 is
awesome<00:01:04.449> in<00:01:04.629> this<00:01:04.750> room<00:01:04.979> so<00:01:05.979> I<00:01:06.250> thought<00:01:06.939> I

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:07.240 
awesome in this room so I thought I

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.800 
awesome in this room so I thought I
would<00:01:07.270> give<00:01:07.840> you<00:01:07.869> a<00:01:08.020> couple<00:01:08.710> of<00:01:09.570> helpful<00:01:10.570> tips

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810 
would give you a couple of helpful tips

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.340 
would give you a couple of helpful tips
the<00:01:11.770> next<00:01:12.159> time<00:01:12.310> you<00:01:12.429> go<00:01:12.689> to<00:01:13.689> do<00:01:14.020> something

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
the next time you go to do something

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.859 
the next time you go to do something
like<00:01:14.380> this<00:01:15.130> I<00:01:15.429> had<00:01:15.909> to<00:01:16.090> disassemble

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:16.869 
like this I had to disassemble

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:19.679 
like this I had to disassemble
everything<00:01:17.200> that<00:01:17.740> is<00:01:17.890> remove<00:01:18.520> the<00:01:18.579> wires<00:01:18.909> from

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:19.689 
everything that is remove the wires from

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:23.039 
everything that is remove the wires from
the<00:01:19.750> back<00:01:20.079> of<00:01:20.259> that<00:01:20.350> unit<00:01:20.770> and<00:01:21.030> in<00:01:22.030> doing<00:01:22.689> so<00:01:22.840> I

00:01:23.039 --> 00:01:23.049 
the back of that unit and in doing so I

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:27.419 
the back of that unit and in doing so I
realized<00:01:23.469> I<00:01:23.649> better<00:01:24.450> remember<00:01:25.450> where<00:01:26.380> they<00:01:26.890> go

00:01:27.419 --> 00:01:27.429 
realized I better remember where they go

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:30.749 
realized I better remember where they go
back<00:01:27.729> into<00:01:28.060> so<00:01:28.869> I<00:01:29.320> took<00:01:29.770> a<00:01:30.009> multi-pronged

00:01:30.749 --> 00:01:30.759 
back into so I took a multi-pronged

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:37.260 
back into so I took a multi-pronged
approach<00:01:31.350> one<00:01:32.350> I<00:01:33.869> recorded<00:01:34.869> movies<00:01:35.770> of<00:01:36.270> me

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 
approach one I recorded movies of me

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.749 
approach one I recorded movies of me
talking<00:01:37.659> and<00:01:38.229> saying<00:01:38.890> all<00:01:39.159> right<00:01:39.219> I'm<00:01:39.460> pulling

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:39.759 
talking and saying all right I'm pulling

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:42.480 
talking and saying all right I'm pulling
out<00:01:39.850> this<00:01:40.060> cable<00:01:40.539> from<00:01:40.840> this<00:01:41.109> port<00:01:41.679> this<00:01:42.159> cable

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:42.490 
out this cable from this port this cable

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.880 
out this cable from this port this cable
from<00:01:42.579> this<00:01:42.759> port<00:01:42.999> and<00:01:43.499> so<00:01:44.499> hopefully<00:01:44.770> from

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
from this port and so hopefully from

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:46.950 
from this port and so hopefully from
there<00:01:45.069> we'll<00:01:45.249> have<00:01:45.429> audio<00:01:45.939> and<00:01:46.179> visual<00:01:46.600> cues

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
there we'll have audio and visual cues

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.069 
there we'll have audio and visual cues
it<00:01:47.829> was<00:01:47.950> a<00:01:47.979> little<00:01:48.130> tricky<00:01:48.369> to<00:01:48.729> maneuver<00:01:49.479> the

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:50.079 
it was a little tricky to maneuver the

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:52.889 
it was a little tricky to maneuver the
camera<00:01:50.979> in<00:01:51.429> back<00:01:51.759> there<00:01:51.969> but<00:01:52.119> it's<00:01:52.600> nice<00:01:52.719> to

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:52.899 
camera in back there but it's nice to

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:54.859 
camera in back there but it's nice to
have<00:01:53.020> a<00:01:53.079> little<00:01:53.229> light<00:01:53.649> when<00:01:54.100> you<00:01:54.189> need<00:01:54.340> it

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
have a little light when you need it

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.029 
have a little light when you need it
that's<00:01:55.869> again<00:01:56.200> that's<00:01:56.439> the<00:01:56.649> I<00:01:56.770> guess<00:01:56.920> that

00:01:57.029 --> 00:01:57.039 
that's again that's the I guess that

00:01:57.039 --> 00:01:58.260 
that's again that's the I guess that
would<00:01:57.130> be<00:01:57.159> the<00:01:57.219> first<00:01:57.399> tip<00:01:57.639> second<00:01:57.999> tip<00:01:58.119> is<00:01:58.149> the

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
would be the first tip second tip is the

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.739 
would be the first tip second tip is the
camera<00:01:58.600> third<00:01:59.259> tip<00:01:59.590> I<00:01:59.799> took<00:02:00.369> some<00:02:00.759> stickers

00:02:01.739 --> 00:02:01.749 
camera third tip I took some stickers

00:02:01.749 --> 00:02:05.849 
camera third tip I took some stickers
from<00:02:02.350> Ponzi's<00:02:03.039> drawer<00:02:03.729> and<00:02:04.350> color<00:02:05.350> labeled

00:02:05.849 --> 00:02:05.859 
from Ponzi's drawer and color labeled

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:07.649 
from Ponzi's drawer and color labeled
some<00:02:06.429> of<00:02:06.549> the<00:02:06.609> cables<00:02:06.969> because<00:02:07.270> again<00:02:07.539> I've

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
some of the cables because again I've

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:10.529 
some of the cables because again I've
got<00:02:07.780> 7.1<00:02:08.319> surround<00:02:08.470> sound<00:02:08.740> and<00:02:09.069> so<00:02:10.000> knowing

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
got 7.1 surround sound and so knowing

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.280 
got 7.1 surround sound and so knowing
which<00:02:11.080> wires<00:02:11.380> go<00:02:11.709> into<00:02:12.420> which<00:02:13.420> well<00:02:14.020> I<00:02:14.050> guess

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:14.290 
which wires go into which well I guess

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:17.640 
which wires go into which well I guess
knob<00:02:14.740> is<00:02:15.160> the<00:02:15.520> case<00:02:15.700> in<00:02:15.880> the<00:02:16.360> back<00:02:16.510> of<00:02:16.690> this

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
knob is the case in the back of this

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.850 
knob is the case in the back of this
fire<00:02:17.890> or<00:02:18.629> well<00:02:19.629> receiver<00:02:20.590> so<00:02:21.220> I<00:02:22.200> coded<00:02:23.200> it<00:02:23.470> our

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
fire or well receiver so I coded it our

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.170 
fire or well receiver so I coded it our
