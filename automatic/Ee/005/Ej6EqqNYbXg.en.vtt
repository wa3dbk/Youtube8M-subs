this whole video and the hearthfire dlc

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.880 
this whole video and the hearthfire dlc
will<00:01:36.630> probably<00:01:36.990> pretty<00:01:37.259> cheap<00:01:37.560> since<00:01:37.770> it

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
will probably pretty cheap since it

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.160 
will probably pretty cheap since it
looks<00:01:38.159> like<00:01:38.310> it's<00:01:38.490> pretty<00:01:38.840> lacking<00:01:39.840> in<00:01:40.140> the

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
looks like it's pretty lacking in the

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.080 
looks like it's pretty lacking in the
features<00:01:40.530> department<00:01:41.009> it's<00:01:41.340> not<00:01:41.670> adding<00:01:42.030> a

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
features department it's not adding a

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:43.490 
features department it's not adding a
bunch<00:01:42.210> of<00:01:42.360> quests<00:01:42.810> but<00:01:42.899> hopefully<00:01:43.320> it'll

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
bunch of quests but hopefully it'll

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.170 
bunch of quests but hopefully it'll
