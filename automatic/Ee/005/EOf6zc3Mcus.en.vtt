00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:07.200
We won't go to government school. They don't treat us well there.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:11.400
They don't teach us or anything. They don't teach us properly. 

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.500
In 2009 the Indian government inacted a new law, the Right

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.600
to Education Act which guarantees free and compensary education to all children  6-14 years old.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:27.280
India has made significant progress towards literacy but we found that the 

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:31.380
law is failing to keep children from marginalized communities in classrooms. 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:38.000
 The Dilet, tribal, or Muslim child, because of discrimination, because they are made to feel unwelcome.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
We ask the teacher, "Please teach us too!"

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.960
"We want to learn to read and write so you will be proud."

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.120
She responds, "Why should we teach you?"

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.900
We study the whole day on our own. We learn from our own textbooks

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:04.800
Discrimination can take various forms such as Dilet or tribal children are made to sit separately or at the back of the class. 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.620
She used to make us sit in a corner and all the Hindu and Muslim students sat in front.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.500
Children from the other village tell us not to come close to them. 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.800
They spit on us. They spit on our clothes.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
When we tell the teacher, she just hits us.

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:32.500
Our children are made to sit separately for meals and the other children are fed separately.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.800
They don't pay attention to our kids.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.000
When I spoke to the principal and teacher, it was very apparent that they saw these tribal children as a problem.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.840
These children don't interact with other children easily. 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.840
They are a bit different. Their eating habits are a bit different.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.260
We aren't allowed to beat them. We are only allowed to scold them, so they don't listen to us.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.000
The government authorities fail to hold teachers and principals to account when they discriminate or 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.200
 allow discrimination against these children. 

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:12.900
If there is an issue of discrimination, the administration should make it an issue and address it. 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.900
At this point in time, very often we do not see the teachers being ready to address it.

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.600
So I think they have to be told that this is a matter that needs to be changed and their 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.900
compliance in this is very important. 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.560
Instead of paying more attention and integrating these children, teachers neglect these children 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:37.000
 from marginalized communities who fall behind in classes and over time lose interest in coming to school.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.800
 Children who drop out of school face other threats such as being pushed into child labor or early marriage. 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:51.300
I thought I would go to school, get an education and become a doctor. 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:57.500
I didn't finish school. I only stayed through the fifth grade. 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.300
All day I do whatever needs to be done, whatever work I'm told to do.

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:11.800
I do things like cut wheat and pick potatoes. I spend the whole day doing that.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:18.300
 We work in the fields so we hoped our children would get an education.

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.000
and do some other kind of work.

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.500
It would be good if they got a decent job somewhere.

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:29.780
They can't study because of society, because of the teachers.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.580
Right now, these children are still not in school.

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.940
The saddest thing is that despite the fact that these children mustered the courage to speak out

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.760
against the discrimination they faced, which is very tough to do

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.560
they went to school for only a very short period.

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.980
Our children don't understand the point of going to school

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.300
because they are not learning anything there.

00:03:52.920 --> 00:04:02.280
We wish that our children could get an education, so they could become doctors, magistrates, or police superintendents.

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:12.520
This would make us happy but there is no one to help us so how can we move ahead?

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:17.360
Discrimination is unacceptable. 

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:19.520
It has been outlawed for decades

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:25.040
and it is important that schools become a site of zero discrimination.

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:33.900
If they teach us, then we will be like you. If they don't teach us, then I will remain the way I am.
