00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
so the back of the box let's see if we

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:49.100 
so the back of the box let's see if we
have<00:01:47.549> it<00:01:47.670> upside<00:01:47.850> down<00:01:48.060> or<00:01:48.299> the<00:01:48.630> correct<00:01:48.930> way

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
have it upside down or the correct way

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:55.130 
have it upside down or the correct way
this<00:01:50.009> is<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.399> correct<00:01:50.640> way<00:01:52.490> so<00:01:53.930> there<00:01:54.930> we<00:01:55.110> have

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
this is the correct way so there we have

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.959 
this is the correct way so there we have
it<00:01:55.320> this<00:01:56.009> is<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.280> rough<00:01:56.460> design<00:01:56.610> of<00:01:56.880> the

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
it this is the rough design of the

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.100 
control a lock so the cable goes in the

the<00:02:49.770> stick<00:02:50.010> so<00:02:50.430> let's<00:02:50.700> get<00:02:50.880> to<00:02:50.940> the<00:02:51.180> stick

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
the stick so let's get to the stick

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:57.020 
the stick so let's get to the stick
itself<00:02:52.160> let's<00:02:53.160> flip<00:02:53.580> it<00:02:53.730> over<00:02:53.820> again<00:02:54.440> and<00:02:56.030> turn

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
itself let's flip it over again and turn

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.790 
itself let's flip it over again and turn
it<00:02:57.210> a<00:02:57.300> bit<00:02:57.450> so<00:02:58.280> let's<00:02:59.280> pop<00:02:59.580> out<00:02:59.790> the<00:03:00.470> doors<00:03:01.470> and

these are stuck with a magnet that you
can<00:03:03.780> hear<00:03:04.490> this<00:03:05.490> is<00:03:05.760> magnetized<00:03:06.660> over<00:03:07.110> here<00:03:07.290> so

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
can hear this is magnetized over here so

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.190 
can hear this is magnetized over here so
