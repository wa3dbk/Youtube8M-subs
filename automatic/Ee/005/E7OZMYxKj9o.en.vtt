00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:17.270 
we're here at someone am 2015 on the

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:19.269 
we're here at someone am 2015 on the
Salomon<00:00:17.689> mics<00:00:17.869> booth<00:00:18.200> with<00:00:18.470> Henry<00:00:18.800> French<00:00:19.070> the

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:19.279 
Salomon mics booth with Henry French the

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:23.409 
Salomon mics booth with Henry French the
designer<00:00:19.610> of<00:00:19.939> the<00:00:20.119> low<00:00:20.390> freq<00:00:20.720> so<00:00:21.550> Henry<00:00:22.550> this

00:00:23.409 --> 00:00:23.419 
designer of the low freq so Henry this

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:27.790 
designer of the low freq so Henry this
is<00:00:23.660> broadly<00:00:24.500> based<00:00:24.650> on<00:00:24.950> a<00:00:26.259> putting<00:00:27.259> a<00:00:27.349> speaker

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:27.800 
is broadly based on a putting a speaker

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.100 
is broadly based on a putting a speaker
in<00:00:28.070> front<00:00:28.369> of<00:00:28.579> a<00:00:28.880> speaker<00:00:29.329> coney<00:00:29.599> down<00:00:29.750> to<00:00:29.989> the

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:30.110 
in front of a speaker coney down to the

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:32.280 
in front of a speaker coney down to the
kick<00:00:30.259> drum<00:00:30.529> principle<00:00:31.160> like<00:00:31.340> the<00:00:31.430> NS<00:00:31.669> 10

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:32.290 
kick drum principle like the NS 10

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.049 
kick drum principle like the NS 10
technique<00:00:33.290> which<00:00:33.620> is<00:00:33.770> a<00:00:34.100> commonly<00:00:34.460> used<00:00:34.550> kind

00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:35.059 
technique which is a commonly used kind

00:00:35.059 --> 00:00:36.910 
technique which is a commonly used kind
of<00:00:35.120> variation<00:00:35.600> on<00:00:35.690> at<00:00:35.780> the<00:00:35.899> NS<00:00:36.140> 10<00:00:36.380> absolutely

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:36.920 
of variation on at the NS 10 absolutely

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.380 
of variation on at the NS 10 absolutely
and<00:00:37.190> so<00:00:37.610> what's<00:00:37.820> this<00:00:37.969> then

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:38.390 
and so what's this then

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.240 
and so what's this then
well<00:00:38.809> this<00:00:39.020> is<00:00:39.170> the<00:00:39.290> Salman<00:00:39.620> Mike<00:00:39.770> slow<00:00:40.010> free

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:40.250 
well this is the Salman Mike slow free

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.370 
well this is the Salman Mike slow free
currently<00:00:40.910> available<00:00:41.090> right<00:00:41.390> now<00:00:41.450> this<00:00:42.230> is

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:42.380 
currently available right now this is

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.370 
currently available right now this is
kind<00:00:42.590> of<00:00:42.620> our<00:00:42.770> reimagining<00:00:43.520> of<00:00:43.700> the<00:00:43.940> entire

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:44.380 
kind of our reimagining of the entire

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.990 
kind of our reimagining of the entire
you<00:00:45.380> know<00:00:45.410> speaker<00:00:45.920> the<00:00:46.070> low<00:00:46.220> low-frequency

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.000 
you know speaker the low low-frequency

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.610 
you know speaker the low low-frequency
capture<00:00:47.360> micro<00:00:47.660> microphone<00:00:48.260> that's<00:00:48.380> what

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620 
capture micro microphone that's what

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:49.870 
capture micro microphone that's what
this<00:00:48.770> says<00:00:48.950> low-frequency<00:00:49.550> capture

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:49.880 
this says low-frequency capture

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.630 
this says low-frequency capture
microphone<00:00:50.300> okay<00:00:50.770> we've<00:00:51.770> made<00:00:51.800> a<00:00:52.010> couple

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
microphone okay we've made a couple

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.950 
microphone okay we've made a couple
changes<00:00:52.760> that<00:00:53.270> make<00:00:53.420> a<00:00:53.450> little<00:00:53.600> easier<00:00:53.930> for

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:53.960 
changes that make a little easier for

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.780 
changes that make a little easier for
everybody<00:00:54.200> to<00:00:54.410> work<00:00:54.440> with<00:00:54.770> and<00:00:55.340> that's<00:00:55.520> part

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:55.790 
everybody to work with and that's part

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.069 
everybody to work with and that's part
of<00:00:55.880> one<00:00:56.060> of<00:00:56.090> the<00:00:56.210> reasons<00:00:56.360> for<00:00:56.600> this<00:00:56.930> whole

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 
of one of the reasons for this whole

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:58.420 
of one of the reasons for this whole
redesign<00:00:57.500> was<00:00:57.680> to<00:00:57.710> make<00:00:57.920> it<00:00:58.010> a<00:00:58.070> little<00:00:58.190> more<00:00:58.280> of

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:58.430 
redesign was to make it a little more of

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.790 
redesign was to make it a little more of
a<00:00:58.520> plug-and-play<00:00:58.760> thing<00:00:59.360> so<00:00:59.989> the<00:01:00.380> technique

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.800 
a plug-and-play thing so the technique

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.860 
a plug-and-play thing so the technique
has<00:01:00.980> been<00:01:01.130> done<00:01:01.399> for<00:01:01.610> a<00:01:01.670> while<00:01:01.730> but<00:01:02.630> it<00:01:02.720> does

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 
has been done for a while but it does

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.030 
has been done for a while but it does
take<00:01:03.079> a<00:01:03.110> lot<00:01:03.260> of<00:01:03.320> tweaks<00:01:03.649> if<00:01:03.800> you're<00:01:03.920> just

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:04.040 
take a lot of tweaks if you're just

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.649 
take a lot of tweaks if you're just
doing<00:01:04.159> it<00:01:04.339> at<00:01:04.430> home<00:01:04.610> we<00:01:04.729> have<00:01:04.879> a<00:01:04.939> DIY<00:01:05.390> thing

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 
doing it at home we have a DIY thing

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:07.690 
doing it at home we have a DIY thing
it's<00:01:05.869> having<00:01:06.170> quite<00:01:06.200> a<00:01:06.380> bit<00:01:06.590> so<00:01:07.250> this<00:01:07.369> is<00:01:07.520> more

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
it's having quite a bit so this is more

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.969 
it's having quite a bit so this is more
of<00:01:07.729> a<00:01:07.909> plugin<00:01:08.630> in<00:01:08.720> and<00:01:08.840> off<00:01:08.930> you<00:01:08.960> go<00:01:09.140> and<00:01:09.290> get

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979 
of a plugin in and off you go and get

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:11.800 
of a plugin in and off you go and get
right<00:01:10.189> to<00:01:10.340> the<00:01:10.430> to<00:01:10.820> the<00:01:10.909> the<00:01:11.329> cusp<00:01:11.540> of<00:01:11.630> what

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
right to the to the the cusp of what

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.450 
right to the to the the cusp of what
you're<00:01:11.930> doing<00:01:12.020> really<00:01:12.290> quickly<00:01:12.590> so<00:01:13.249> what's

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
you're doing really quickly so what's

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.249 
you're doing really quickly so what's
the<00:01:13.609> driver<00:01:13.880> what<00:01:14.389> size<00:01:14.539> drive<00:01:14.780> are<00:01:14.929> you<00:01:15.020> using

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:15.259 
the driver what size drive are you using

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:17.379 
the driver what size drive are you using
and<00:01:15.619> this<00:01:16.100> is<00:01:16.249> a<00:01:16.310> six<00:01:16.579> and<00:01:16.670> a<00:01:16.759> half<00:01:16.789> inch<00:01:17.119> driver

00:01:17.379 --> 00:01:17.389 
and this is a six and a half inch driver

00:01:17.389 --> 00:01:19.389 
and this is a six and a half inch driver
okay<00:01:17.810> which<00:01:18.139> again<00:01:18.409> kind<00:01:18.710> of<00:01:18.799> a<00:01:18.859> middle<00:01:19.039> middle

00:01:19.389 --> 00:01:19.399 
okay which again kind of a middle middle

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:20.980 
okay which again kind of a middle middle
spot<00:01:19.639> I've<00:01:19.909> seen<00:01:20.090> people<00:01:20.389> using<00:01:20.600> eight<00:01:20.840> inch

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
spot I've seen people using eight inch

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.830 
spot I've seen people using eight inch
drivers<00:01:21.409> some<00:01:22.039> even<00:01:22.280> smaller<00:01:22.639> yeah<00:01:23.270> but<00:01:23.719> this

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
drivers some even smaller yeah but this

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.330 
drivers some even smaller yeah but this
appears<00:01:24.170> to<00:01:24.319> be<00:01:24.409> kind<00:01:24.649> of<00:01:24.740> a<00:01:24.859> sweet<00:01:25.069> spot<00:01:25.310> that

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
appears to be kind of a sweet spot that

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:26.770 
appears to be kind of a sweet spot that
everybody<00:01:25.759> kind<00:01:25.850> of<00:01:25.939> gravitates<00:01:26.450> to<00:01:26.600> in<00:01:26.719> the

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
everybody kind of gravitates to in the

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:27.879 
everybody kind of gravitates to in the
first<00:01:26.899> place<00:01:27.139> yeah

00:01:27.879 --> 00:01:27.889 
first place yeah

00:01:27.889 --> 00:01:29.830 
first place yeah
and<00:01:28.100> so<00:01:28.490> what<00:01:28.999> other<00:01:29.149> features<00:01:29.389> does<00:01:29.689> it<00:01:29.719> have

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
and so what other features does it have

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.389 
and so what other features does it have
that<00:01:29.959> make<00:01:30.289> it<00:01:30.469> more<00:01:30.969> usable<00:01:33.069> the<00:01:34.069> biggest

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:34.399 
that make it more usable the biggest

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:36.429 
that make it more usable the biggest
thing<00:01:34.549> would<00:01:34.670> be<00:01:34.819> this<00:01:35.030> when<00:01:35.359> using<00:01:35.659> a<00:01:36.109> driver

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:36.439 
thing would be this when using a driver

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:37.929 
thing would be this when using a driver
and<00:01:36.709> just<00:01:36.889> kind<00:01:37.039> of<00:01:37.100> reverse<00:01:37.429> wiring<00:01:37.850> it

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:37.939 
and just kind of reverse wiring it

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:39.849 
and just kind of reverse wiring it
plugging<00:01:38.270> it<00:01:38.329> directly<00:01:38.749> in<00:01:38.869> one<00:01:39.529> of<00:01:39.619> the<00:01:39.679> first

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:39.859 
plugging it directly in one of the first

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:41.169 
plugging it directly in one of the first
things<00:01:40.069> you<00:01:40.159> realize<00:01:40.340> is<00:01:40.549> that<00:01:40.700> your<00:01:40.880> gain<00:01:41.149> is

00:01:41.169 --> 00:01:41.179 
things you realize is that your gain is

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:43.239 
things you realize is that your gain is
really<00:01:41.719> hot<00:01:41.929> it's<00:01:42.590> gonna<00:01:42.649> hit<00:01:42.889> your<00:01:43.039> fries

00:01:43.239 --> 00:01:43.249 
really hot it's gonna hit your fries

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:45.099 
really hot it's gonna hit your fries
really<00:01:43.520> hard<00:01:43.880> possibly<00:01:44.779> an<00:01:44.869> impedance

00:01:45.099 --> 00:01:45.109 
really hard possibly an impedance

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:48.249 
really hard possibly an impedance
mismatch<00:01:45.709> this<00:01:46.490> has<00:01:46.700> an<00:01:46.880> inline<00:01:47.209> pad<00:01:47.479> ready<00:01:48.109> to
