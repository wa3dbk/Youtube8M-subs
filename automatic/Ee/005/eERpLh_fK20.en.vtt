this first time to take care of them as

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.880 
this first time to take care of them as
best<00:02:49.380> as<00:02:49.620> I<00:02:49.739> possibly<00:02:49.950> can<00:02:50.430> just<00:02:50.760> to<00:02:51.890> ensure

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
best as I possibly can just to ensure

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.220 
best as I possibly can just to ensure
the<00:02:53.160> quality<00:02:53.310> stays<00:02:54.000> there<00:02:54.269> yeah<00:02:54.660> but

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 
the quality stays there yeah but

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.350 
the quality stays there yeah but
definitely<00:02:55.590> gotta<00:02:55.769> get<00:02:55.980> touch-ups<00:02:56.430> we<00:02:57.269> are

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
definitely gotta get touch-ups we are

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.880 
definitely gotta get touch-ups we are
going<00:02:57.540> to<00:02:57.600> go<00:02:57.690> back<00:02:57.870> and<00:02:58.200> I<00:02:58.380> think<00:02:58.620> the<00:02:58.769> fact

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
going to go back and I think the fact

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:59.990 
going to go back and I think the fact
that<00:02:58.980> you<00:02:59.130> don't<00:02:59.250> you're<00:02:59.489> not<00:02:59.519> even<00:02:59.850> wearing

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
that you don't you're not even wearing

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.250 
that you don't you're not even wearing
eyeliner<00:03:00.329> to<00:03:00.630> that'll<00:03:00.989> make<00:03:01.110> a<00:03:01.170> big

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
eyeliner to that'll make a big

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.840 
eyeliner to that'll make a big
difference<00:03:01.590> in<00:03:01.950> terms<00:03:02.190> of<00:03:02.310> just<00:03:02.459> over<00:03:02.670> all

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
difference in terms of just over all

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:05.210 
difference in terms of just over all
maintenance<00:03:03.269> it'll<00:03:03.750> be<00:03:03.840> easier<00:03:04.230> to<00:03:04.350> just<00:03:04.530> kind

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
maintenance it'll be easier to just kind

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.310
