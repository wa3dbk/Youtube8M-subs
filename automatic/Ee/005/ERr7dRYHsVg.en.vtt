00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:06.990 

Oh

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:07.000 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.810 

so<00:00:07.390> we<00:00:07.509> can<00:00:07.629> all<00:00:07.720> learn<00:00:07.810> how<00:00:08.049> to<00:00:08.080> do<00:00:08.410> a<00:00:08.820> belly

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:09.820 
so we can all learn how to do a belly

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.990 
so we can all learn how to do a belly
wave<00:00:10.120> or<00:00:10.480> a<00:00:10.540> belly<00:00:10.929> roll<00:00:11.320> um<00:00:11.580> the<00:00:12.580> ID<00:00:12.730> of<00:00:12.879> the

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:13.000 
wave or a belly roll um the ID of the

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.539 
wave or a belly roll um the ID of the
Bell<00:00:13.269> rule<00:00:13.570> is<00:00:13.780> pretty<00:00:14.230> much<00:00:14.530> about<00:00:14.889> isolation

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:15.549 
Bell rule is pretty much about isolation

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:18.120 
Bell rule is pretty much about isolation
so<00:00:16.090> we<00:00:16.750> have<00:00:16.900> two<00:00:17.050> sets<00:00:17.260> of<00:00:17.410> muscles<00:00:17.590> here<00:00:17.980> the

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:18.130 
so we have two sets of muscles here the

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:19.920 
so we have two sets of muscles here the
lower<00:00:18.279> abs<00:00:18.580> and<00:00:18.850> then<00:00:19.029> the<00:00:19.119> upper<00:00:19.390> apps<00:00:19.570> and

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:19.930 
lower abs and then the upper apps and

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.080 
lower abs and then the upper apps and
with<00:00:20.050> trying<00:00:20.320> the<00:00:21.039> idea<00:00:21.310> is<00:00:21.400> to<00:00:21.550> be<00:00:21.640> able<00:00:21.670> to

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:22.090 
with trying the idea is to be able to

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.019 
with trying the idea is to be able to
push<00:00:22.420> one<00:00:22.900> if<00:00:23.380> you<00:00:23.470> push<00:00:23.679> your<00:00:23.800> lower<00:00:24.009> abs<00:00:24.279> then

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:25.029 
push one if you push your lower abs then

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:28.349 
push one if you push your lower abs then
you're<00:00:25.210> tucking<00:00:26.039> your<00:00:27.039> upper<00:00:27.429> abs<00:00:27.640> and<00:00:27.939> then

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:28.359 
you're tucking your upper abs and then

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:31.409 
you're tucking your upper abs and then
you're<00:00:28.509> doing<00:00:28.869> the<00:00:29.140> opposite<00:00:29.679> so<00:00:30.609> being<00:00:31.359> able

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:31.419 
you're doing the opposite so being able

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:33.750 
you're doing the opposite so being able
to<00:00:31.599> control<00:00:32.169> your<00:00:32.230> muscles<00:00:32.860> and<00:00:32.980> isolated<00:00:33.700> in

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:33.760 
to control your muscles and isolated in

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.860 
to control your muscles and isolated in
one<00:00:33.970> part<00:00:34.300> at<00:00:34.570> a<00:00:34.630> time<00:00:34.750> is<00:00:35.470> key<00:00:36.310> so<00:00:36.720> that's<00:00:37.720> the

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:37.870 
one part at a time is key so that's the

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:39.600 
one part at a time is key so that's the
first<00:00:38.079> step<00:00:38.320> to<00:00:38.470> start<00:00:38.739> with<00:00:38.980> it<00:00:39.160> just<00:00:39.400> pretty

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:39.610 
first step to start with it just pretty

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.540 
first step to start with it just pretty
much<00:00:39.730> trying<00:00:40.030> to<00:00:40.150> concentrate<00:00:40.690> and<00:00:41.550> isolating

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:42.550 
much trying to concentrate and isolating

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.700 
much trying to concentrate and isolating
so<00:00:42.850> here<00:00:43.240> I'm<00:00:43.450> going<00:00:43.630> to<00:00:43.750> try<00:00:43.990> to<00:00:44.050> push<00:00:44.320> on<00:00:44.530> my

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:44.710 
so here I'm going to try to push on my

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:47.280 
so here I'm going to try to push on my
lower<00:00:44.920> abs<00:00:45.190> out<00:00:45.370> and<00:00:45.760> then<00:00:45.910> tuck<00:00:46.210> in<00:00:46.450> my<00:00:46.960> upper

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:47.290 
lower abs out and then tuck in my upper

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:55.410 
lower abs out and then tuck in my upper
ex<00:00:48.150> that's<00:00:49.150> a<00:00:49.300> lot<00:00:49.450> of<00:00:49.480> fun<00:00:49.750> then<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.910> then<00:00:55.270> try

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:55.420 
ex that's a lot of fun then and then try

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:02.780 
ex that's a lot of fun then and then try
to<00:00:55.450> do<00:00:55.630> the<00:00:55.750> opposite<00:00:56.170> check<00:00:56.860> the<00:00:57.010> lower<00:00:57.160> ass

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:02.790 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:05.730 

push<00:01:03.790> the<00:01:03.970> upper<00:01:04.269> this<00:01:04.689> one<00:01:04.930> is<00:01:05.049> not<00:01:05.199> as<00:01:05.379> easy

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740 
push the upper this one is not as easy

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.530 
push the upper this one is not as easy
so<00:01:06.250> tuck<00:01:06.670> the<00:01:07.180> upper<00:01:07.650> just<00:01:08.650> on<00:01:08.799> the<00:01:08.890> word<00:01:09.540> push

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 
so tuck the upper just on the word push

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.820 
so tuck the upper just on the word push
the<00:01:10.720> lower

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.220 

tuck<00:01:14.830> the<00:01:15.010> lower<00:01:15.159> push<00:01:15.550> the<00:01:15.700> upper<00:01:16.110> once<00:01:17.110> you

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:17.230 
tuck the lower push the upper once you

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:19.680 
tuck the lower push the upper once you
get<00:01:17.440> the<00:01:17.590> idea<00:01:17.980> of<00:01:18.190> isolating<00:01:18.909> the<00:01:19.030> two<00:01:19.240> parts

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:19.690 
get the idea of isolating the two parts

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.649 
get the idea of isolating the two parts
then<00:01:20.110> it's<00:01:20.260> a<00:01:20.350> matter<00:01:20.590> of<00:01:20.680> routine<00:01:21.220> so<00:01:22.180> tuck

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:22.659 
then it's a matter of routine so tuck

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:27.180 
then it's a matter of routine so tuck
push<00:01:23.530> tap<00:01:24.340> push<00:01:25.090> tap<00:01:25.960> push<00:01:26.680> and<00:01:26.979> then<00:01:27.100> it

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:27.190 
push tap push tap push and then it

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.670 
push tap push tap push and then it
caalso<00:01:27.400> lick<00:01:27.640> it<00:01:27.760> go<00:01:27.909> like<00:01:28.150> that<00:01:28.380> to<00:01:29.380> see<00:01:29.560> the

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 
caalso lick it go like that to see the

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:34.080 
caalso lick it go like that to see the
belly<00:01:29.890> wave<00:01:30.130> so<00:01:30.490> we've<00:01:30.880> got<00:01:31.090> tuck<00:01:31.840> upper<00:01:33.090> push

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
belly wave so we've got tuck upper push

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:59.990 
belly wave so we've got tuck upper push
the<00:01:34.240> low<00:01:34.360> one<00:01:35.010> and<00:01:36.010> then<00:01:36.130> open

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.610 

anything<00:02:01.000> could<00:02:01.120> change<00:02:01.150> this<00:02:04.470> little<00:02:05.470> is

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:05.620 
anything could change this little is

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:14.370 
anything could change this little is
better<00:02:10.980> so<00:02:11.980> it<00:02:12.070> takes<00:02:12.250> some<00:02:12.430> practice<00:02:12.580> to<00:02:13.380> get

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
better so it takes some practice to get

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.710 
better so it takes some practice to get
the<00:02:14.530> isolation<00:02:15.160> apart<00:02:15.460> first<00:02:15.790> and<00:02:16.120> then<00:02:16.510> from

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:16.720 
the isolation apart first and then from

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:19.130 
the isolation apart first and then from
there<00:02:16.960> it's<00:02:17.530> just<00:02:17.620> a<00:02:17.860> matter<00:02:18.010> of<00:02:18.160> trying<00:02:18.550> to

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
there it's just a matter of trying to

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.570 
there it's just a matter of trying to
alternate<00:02:20.140> the<00:02:20.560> set<00:02:20.770> of<00:02:20.890> muscle<00:02:21.310> that<00:02:21.430> you're

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
alternate the set of muscle that you're

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.520 
alternate the set of muscle that you're
moving<00:02:21.970> and<00:02:22.120> you<00:02:22.420> could<00:02:22.570> do<00:02:22.690> it<00:02:22.870> you<00:02:23.500> know

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
moving and you could do it you know

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.460 
moving and you could do it you know
going<00:02:24.460> up<00:02:24.730> down<00:02:25.000> down<00:02:25.360> up<00:02:25.660> whatever<00:02:26.020> your

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
going up down down up whatever your

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:37.340 
going up down down up whatever your
preference<00:02:27.010> is

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.410 

you
