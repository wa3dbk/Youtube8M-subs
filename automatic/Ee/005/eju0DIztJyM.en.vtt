00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:06.540
 start this tutorial i will tell you 

00:00:04.439 --> 00:00:08.520
 that I'm sorry at times 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.320
 always did the duty the application 

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.820
 it was in the end of videos do not know 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.070
 why it has bugged so I 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.570
 really sorry I still hope that 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.830
 you will appreciate that it's going too lennon 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:22.020
 the side being studied and a video 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.270
 and he greets everyone comments go 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.000
 me it's going very well today we 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.710
 find for a little tutorial it's going 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
 to be like in trance form and finally not 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.040
 turn your phone into photoshop 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.600
 what to make them one of montages 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.410
 pics 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.489
 in any case I find it so 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.410
 it's the fault of the handsome young people caught in 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.019
 holidays and that 's going to be the rendering that 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.019
 so that will give you why you will 

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:44.280
 need signs applications and a 

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:45.650
 second application after if you 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.850
 want to make a text 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:51.750
 so here I wanted to take cooked 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:54.510
 these boosters for editing purposes 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.820
 photo and melt candy over for the 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.620
 montage of poster texts 89 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.019
 pennies and make great and more I 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.430
 know more I believe that the same good 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:04.320
 that's cheap and it helps 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.850
 to really do the cool stuff so I 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.720
 go for reaching his 38 to go on time 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.659
 Explain 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.369
 people are returning world is ending up 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.880
 in the first application that is 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.610
 author 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.350
 so that's so I selected the 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.479
 bottom left photo normal you will have 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.430
 a little guy and if not you click on 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.409
 the clip stuff pictures a lot of a photo 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.340
 it'll take you to his so early 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.810
 you had filter not useful the curves 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.610
 it can be useful for some photos 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.230
 but then it's not going to be worth it 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.600
 you're going to help him just lembet 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:35.670
 the saturation amat the contrast to max 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.610
 the lawns of a little brightness and 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.410
 go down a little bit explore here already this 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.570
 made a little hot colors killed two 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.940
 vignettes will increase pretty radiantly 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.080
 and a lot of time if you see there for 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.340
 do the facts so according to you can 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.430
 put more or less intensity for 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:54.870
 that we are going more or less the car is 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:58.020
 more or less the radio I think we'll 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:59.730
 actually takes there I'd like but we 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:04.560
 sees the most people around after if that 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:08.000
 take it we're not going to put it to the bottom not that 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.000
 would ruin by table wedge 

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:12.580
 then we will go to temperature on 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.530
 not going to put their voices but in the 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.890
 warm colors but not like that in 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:22.810
 oranges or about that's it's not 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:24.340
 badly like that here after you have 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:27.100
 just click on the top right and 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.470
 do save and so here is your picture is 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:32.110
 saved so we end up all of 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.610
 following to go waiting before going 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.230
 in the software that counts 

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:37.030
 more just go back in the device 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.190
 photo 2 seconds to show you a 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.600
 little trick that in his part so sounded 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.239
 to control more of that has them all 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.430
 then returned we are in 

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:46.269
 the application not of my application by 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.310
 so what do I answer in 

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:49.630
 the camera or in fact you're going 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.220
 need some zooms holding a little with your 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:52.959
 fingers and take a screenshot 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.550
 otherwise, after that, it will have an effect 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:57.940
 grown up like that on the software 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:03:00.069
 how are you going to shoot like that? 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.080
 and you do a screenshot so the 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:04.030
 screenshot reminder you press 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:07.930
 the round button where there is a small 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:14.110
 square on it and you would touch it 

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:16.780
 sorry sorry sorry did that and that's it 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:20.680
 so your photo and you have your 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:22.540
 reduced photo are free and therefore no 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.530
 especially in the second application which 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:25.750
 is founded says more 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.489
 so you see I did not even do the 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.070
 screenshot i'm still doing them too 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:32.340
 finally it was not I do not have is 

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:35.920
 now denounced by we will do with 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:38.920
 you can select 3 81 me I 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.440
 believe so here you select the 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:42.370
 photo mode 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:44.290
 then you press the little 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.239
 arrow at the top right have procreated this 

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:48.430
 is a photo you will have shouted camera 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:50.769
 and bookstore you will discover and and 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.450
 you take your picture so we have all 

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:53.620
 his load 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.209
 so here are ten double taps for 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.489
 edit then already by staying to do that 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:04:00.190
 we go and on the small square so the 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:02.350
 second school and we'll do what there 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.109
 so we'll click where he writes 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:06.880
 she is going to sort now 

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:08.350
 and then we will press the most 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.420
 suffered a double tap as you want 

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:15.220
 you write what you want talking 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:17.070
 that m I do not put for example a 

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:23.190
 text several tips you 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:24.600
 why like that but then 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.640
 you increase your share like that 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.380
 you may not put it to yourself 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:29.580
 leave some water not quoted you 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.290
 select the color of your head 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:34.170
 so I see there I will take a red by 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:35.670
 example to zoom out what you 

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:37.860
 want you to do that you do it there 

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:39.680
 that's the space between the text but there 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:44.790
 we will not see in this case 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:46.500
 so that's about so about so you 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:52.140
 the offbeat in the lead with your finger when 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:54.390
 I want to put here in games 

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:58.760
 maybe put in the colors a little 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:05:01.050
 lighter - in addition left on the road 

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:03.210
 but I say that the offbeat I see there I 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.960
 nod to nancy I'm going to make a 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:05.520
 new text 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:10.550
 I loved not saying it for you 

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:10.550
 I like at 5 o'clock I'm going to reduce 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:18.420
 with the heart there and after we will write 

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:21.080
 ferrari would be a plus so if you 

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:23.910
 relics will be selected by whose 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:25.860
 something so to grow it the 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:27.540
 reduce so for example let's say that I 

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:30.000
 want to grow a little less quite 

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:31.710
 just to follow that is so in addition this 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:37.470
 angle there we will write go I do not know by 

00:05:31.710 --> 00:05:40.200
 ferrari example that's drari have made the 

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:46.010
 little arrow at the bottom of the text 

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:48.450
 Dad sees this and we shall shifted here 

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:50.490
 so that's it's a nice thing after 

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:52.350
 we can make small icons I know 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:56.760
 not and that it moggi we can make 

00:05:52.350 --> 00:06:04.830
 stuff no more stuff for now 

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:07.470
 is expensive but you like that 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:09.240
 it's nice end is nice we wait 

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:10.680
 they pose and then finally done 

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:13.520
 a little funny thing after you can 

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:18.949
 do a serious thing too 

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:21.500
 here it is to laugh it does not 

00:06:18.949 --> 00:06:30.889
 that they will be a little m we can put it 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:32.659
 a little smile here and see you here 

00:06:30.889 --> 00:06:34.879
 reject again who we see him stop 

00:06:32.659 --> 00:06:35.690
 there as it is still a lot there 

00:06:34.879 --> 00:06:36.860
 you do not have to give 

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:40.840
 finally you do what you want 

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:44.330
 it's just an example and we'll put 

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:47.840
 I do not know me they are to be there 

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:51.380
 will put java m of dollars 

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:53.659
 it will be like that and so here we go 

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:55.550
 then you click on the quest this 

00:06:53.659 --> 00:06:58.250
 that they like stuff right down there 

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:59.539
 you see you share them by all the 

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:03.949
 same time on instagram me I just 

00:06:59.539 --> 00:07:04.789
 do save and it will be in your 

00:07:03.949 --> 00:07:07.159
 camera 

00:07:04.789 --> 00:07:09.259
 so here to listen I hope it 

00:07:07.159 --> 00:07:12.259
 you will have liked anyway it has you more 

00:07:09.259 --> 00:07:14.270
 thought to like like commented on for 

00:07:12.259 --> 00:07:16.240
 to say if it was not done well you have 

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:18.550
 misunderstood 

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:21.650
 we can proceed matter of simply 

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:22.849
 we know to like so yes and when I 

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:25.009
 you said and especially to subscribe 

00:07:22.849 --> 00:07:26.300
 while we tutor others if I you 

00:07:25.009 --> 00:07:28.729
 reminds that we will do a lot of stuff 

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:30.139
 finally he says aim videos from 

00:07:28.729 --> 00:07:31.880
 presentation for that so I do not have you 

00:07:30.139 --> 00:07:34.360
 bother on it we'll kill them these 

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:34.360
