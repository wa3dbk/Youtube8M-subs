Master<00:01:35.310> but<00:01:36.270> if<00:01:37.020> you<00:01:37.170> stand<00:01:37.439> up<00:01:37.770> straight<00:01:38.189> I

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
Master but if you stand up straight I

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.730 
Master but if you stand up straight I
mean<00:01:39.650> the<00:01:40.650> way<00:01:40.829> that<00:01:40.860> he<00:01:41.100> looked<00:01:41.340> his<00:01:41.549> skirt<00:01:42.000> is

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
way bigger than his first so i guess

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.030 
way bigger than his first so i guess
it's<00:01:46.829> made<00:01:47.159> him<00:01:47.280> look<00:01:47.490> kind<00:01:47.909> of<00:01:48.000> girly<00:01:48.420> but<00:01:49.229> he

it's made him look kind of girly but he

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.730 
it's made him look kind of girly but he
doesn't<00:01:50.340> look<00:01:50.430> that<00:01:50.460> bad<00:01:50.909> when<00:01:51.210> you<00:01:51.500> pull<00:01:52.500> this

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
doesn't look that bad when you pull this

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.709 
doesn't look that bad when you pull this
guy's<00:01:53.070> and<00:01:54.439> well<00:01:55.439> I<00:01:55.740> mean<00:01:56.100> you<00:01:56.250> 360<00:01:56.939> and<00:01:57.180> his

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.719 
that he gonna look real weird if they if
well<00:02:06.990> if<00:02:07.020> he<00:02:07.290> put<00:02:07.530> it<00:02:07.619> over<00:02:07.770> his<00:02:07.979> head<00:02:08.039> with<00:02:08.280> the

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
well if he put it over his head with the

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.660 
well if he put it over his head with the
way<00:02:08.910> that<00:02:09.119> his<00:02:09.390> head<00:02:10.200> shape

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
way that his head shape

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:16.260 
way that his head shape
yeah<00:02:12.670> well<00:02:13.510> we<00:02:13.660> will<00:02:13.810> be<00:02:13.930> funny<00:02:14.200> to<00:02:14.700> to<00:02:15.700> imagine

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
yeah well we will be funny to to imagine

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:21.720 
yeah well we will be funny to to imagine
but<00:02:17.260> still<00:02:17.590> good<00:02:17.980> figure<00:02:18.340> and<00:02:19.860> his<00:02:20.860> well<00:02:21.610> his

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730

guess<00:02:25.810> the<00:02:26.320> force<00:02:27.810> hand<00:02:28.810> gesture<00:02:29.550> but<00:02:30.550> the<00:02:30.850> way

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:31.000 
guess the force hand gesture but the way

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:32.640 
guess the force hand gesture but the way
he<00:02:31.210> pulled<00:02:31.510> it<00:02:31.630> I<00:02:31.840> mean<00:02:32.260> it's<00:02:32.470> not
