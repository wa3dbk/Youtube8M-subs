00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:13.129
 let's talk a bit about a real animal 

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:15.079
 adorable or the lesser panda said 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:16.670
 also red panda 

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:18.230
 well maybe you didn't know it exists 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.360
 another panda species outside the 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.680
 giant panda that was more famous 

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.200
 also for its image on the emblem 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.500
 of the vv.f well so there is also 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.700
 this other panda live rus fulgens 

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.530
 belongs to the order of the carnivores but 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.210
 over the years it has been included in 

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:33.920
 family always different because of 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.920
 its difficult location from the point of 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.480
 systematic view undecided whether to insert it 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.130
 in the raccoon family in that 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.750
 of the bears for now zoologists 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.790
 they put him in a created family 

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.100
 specifically for him and of which he is 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:49.010
 the only representative of the family of 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.750
 high luridi in fact already this 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:54.710
 make you understand that it is a species 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:57.350
 really special is the red panda 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:59.630
 has two subspecies and is endemic 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.670
 of the temperate zones of the Himalayas ad 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:03.710
 today he lives in southern tibet on 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.380
 highlands of northeastern and neighboring india 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:09.260
 south west inhabits the woods and 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:12.229
 deep-sea forests between 2200 and 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.210
 4,800 meters above sea level from the 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:16.400
 cool temperature and possibly mixed 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.860
 that is, they have both cabri conifers 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.440
 Decide even better if there is a whole lot 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:25.280
 of bamboo has a length that goes 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:27.440
 generally from 50 and 64 cm to which it goes 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:30.650
 added the queue that generally goes by 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:33.799
 28 to 60 centimeters the weight goes 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:35.570
 average of 36 kg with brands that 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:37.159
 appear to be slightly larger 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.330
 and heavy of the females 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:41.860
 but still a question of a few 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.860
 centimeters and the few eto'o g 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:45.650
 the fur of a splendid color 

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:47.990
 orange fawn tending to fiery red 

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:50.810
 with limbs and lower parts that turn 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.610
 on dark brown almost black ears 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.110
 nose are white as well as one 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.960
 characteristic eye mask 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.909
 that resembles that of the raccoon the tail 

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.400
 it is very long and has red rings on 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:03.350
 orange background in short the red panda 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:06.310
 it strikes to be an animal indeed 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.330
 its beautiful, however, is thick and soft 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.399
 perfectly adapted to the harsh winters 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.769
 that this pet must bear 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.930
 the legs are also provided with claws 

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:16.579
 retractable seeds and the front ones are 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.700
 fitted just like those of the panda 

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:21.530
 giant of fake opposable inches in 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.870
 reality elongated modified bones of the 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:27.099
 wrist that serve to grasp the branches of 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:29.390
 bamboo and to eat more comfortably 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:32.060
 in fact even the red panda like his 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.890
 cousin in the most famous has ever bamboo the 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.439
 bamboo is in fact two verses 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.150
 of his diet the red panda consumes 

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:40.849
 generally the leaves but prefer i 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.739
 shoots that are more digestible for the 

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:44.870
 his diet also consists of 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:48.319
 flowers fruit berries leaves of different 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:50.120
 more lichen roots and fungus plants also 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:53.450
 if occasionally integrates this diet with 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:55.189
 eggs nestlings fish micro-mammals the 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.680
 still less panda remains almost 

00:02:55.189 --> 00:03:00.200
 totally vegetarian as you can imagine 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.700
 from genetic bonds dentatura anatomia yes 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.250
 it would still be a carnivore 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.540
 that due to the evolution one is 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.519
 dated over millennia and a diet 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:09.230
 vegetarian and treating yourself 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:11.450
 originally of a carnivore then 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:15.680
 dated and eating plants is not certain 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:17.810
 a sample in digesting the red panda 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.280
 in fact it does not digest cellulose like 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.500
 instead they actually make animals 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.910
 vegetarian and so to get 

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.160
 enough energy from the power supply 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.560
 must spend several hours a day a 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:29.209
 eat continuously 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:31.669
 think that not only panda can devour 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:33.409
 in one day only something like a kilo 

00:03:31.669 --> 00:03:35.079
 and a half of bamboo leaves and four 

00:03:33.409 --> 00:03:36.650
 kilos of bamboo shoots 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:39.379
 awesome when you think about how much 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.760
 they weigh these little animals they succeed in 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:42.260
 eat continuously because food 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.449
 passes quickly into their apparatus 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.669
 digestive and low energy intake 

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:48.319
 of the diet causes the red panda not 

00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:51.590
 is a kind of metabolism then so 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:54.079
 fast, in short, it's not that I don't want to be 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.489
 that the red pandas just can't 

00:03:54.079 --> 00:03:57.260
 spend most of the time a 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:59.389
 eating and sleeping dangling over 

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.609
 trees and often have a listless area 

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:04.340
 and their movements also sleepy 

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:06.500
 they are not generally lightning fast 

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:10.879
 it is after all a strategy for 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:13.220
 saving calories is a shy species 

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:14.959
 solitary and territorial and individuals 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.570
 they are only sought to reproduce 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:19.669
 at the beginning of spring after one 

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:21.409
 gestation of about five months la 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:23.580
 female from light from one to four 

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:25.199
 little ones that will stay with you for 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:28.139
 maria of months often up to 

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:30.150
 next litter a red panda yes 

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:32.370
 can consider sexually mature to a 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:34.680
 year and a half of age and the duration of the 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.360
 life is around ten years on average 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:39.419
 even if in captivity they often come to 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.949
 13 or 14 years in various parks 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:42.780
 wildlife where these animals are 

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:44.310
 hosted scholars could 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.620
 realize how they are 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:48.360
 intelligent and playful puppies 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:53.400
 in particular they are adorable 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:55.949
 sweet rogues for a change 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.030
 unfortunately the red panda is classified 

00:04:55.949 --> 00:05:00.780
 as an endangered species 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:02.669
 eh already we move on to certain painful notes 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.289
 maybe we are not running out as per 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:06.000
 his cousin or who stands out on 

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:07.560
 emblem of vv.f 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.750
 but the population of the red panda in 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:13.020
 nature is estimated to be well under the 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:15.569
 ten thousand units and is in further decline 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:17.279
 there are not many left in short 

00:05:15.569 --> 00:05:18.539
 nature can be preyed upon by martens 

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:20.849
 snow leopards 

00:05:18.539 --> 00:05:22.830
 but we know they are not natural predators a 

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:24.779
 damage the main prey 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:27.569
 he is the enemy of the red panda 

00:05:24.779 --> 00:05:29.069
 man the main cause of his 

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:31.050
 decreased habitat destruction 

00:05:29.069 --> 00:05:32.340
 and the forests where he lives 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:35.190
 but maybe we want to forget the 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:36.690
 several red panda poachers are 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:39.000
 killed illegally each year without 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:40.919
 pity for the beautiful fur or why 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.979
 wonderful queue in china comes 

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:45.779
 considered a lucky charm 

00:05:43.979 --> 00:05:47.430
 but you can be more stupid than that 

00:05:45.779 --> 00:05:49.620
 tell me you kill a poor one 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:51.029
 little creature in defense because you are 

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:52.279
 convinced that a part of his body 

00:05:51.029 --> 00:05:54.569
 bring luck 

00:05:52.279 --> 00:05:57.990
 sure that man can really be 

00:05:54.569 --> 00:05:59.610
 idiot the red panda is one of many 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:01.440
 wonderful species that are at risk of 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:03.599
 disappear in a few years because of man 

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:04.979
 of his arrogance and his 

00:06:03.599 --> 00:06:06.779
 ignorance 

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:08.909
 after all we know when man sees 

00:06:06.779 --> 00:06:11.250
 something beautiful in nature is not 

00:06:08.909 --> 00:06:13.979
 limited to admire must possess or 

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:15.719
 destroy and if we do not change our heads 

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:18.139
 not even this sweet little animal yes 

00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:18.139
 save
