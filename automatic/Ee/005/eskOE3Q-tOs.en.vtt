00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.550
 the past semester that 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:34.070
 The Freedom of Education Act was passed on 26.9 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:36.470
 2015 with the votes of the cdu fdp and the 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:39.350
 npd adopted in the Saxon diet 

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:40.610
 Paragraph 24 of the law allows 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.290
 the exit from the written 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.090
 student body after one semester 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.890
 There is solidarity 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.840
 Finance sub of the student body 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.399

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.500
 all the same, everyone can pay everything 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:53.120
 Benefit brought social benefits 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.040
 this applies, for example, in the form of 

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.510
 Saxony-wide semesterticket in Dresden 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.070
 and chemnitz all pay one 

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.379
 uniform price and receive 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.180
 far-reaching mobility the fixed number 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:04.159
 to studis as a source of income 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.899
 also brings the traffic 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:07.609
 advantages but if the numbers of 

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:09.889
 written student body because of the 

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:11.329
 exit option fluctuate there are none 

00:01:09.889 --> 00:01:13.189
 basis for calculations of 

00:01:11.329 --> 00:01:14.899
 traffic through this missing 

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:17.060
 It became financial security 

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:18.709
 student councils made impossible 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.840
 semesterticket to organize the 

00:01:18.709 --> 00:01:22.639
 parking situation at the university is already 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.229
 long time after the disappearance of the 

00:01:22.639 --> 00:01:28.389
 ticket rose even more studios 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:28.389
 Car or bike around or walked 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.060
 the for guys I have been here before 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.130
 My name is Professor Doctor 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.380
 igel mouth i am the chair owner of 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.910
 Professur Reprocessing of 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.660
 studying for the saxon 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.510
 economy 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:49.460
 yes, she is already behind the first 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:51.830
 actually this should be the question 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.360
 Lecture questions on the problem of the 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.880
 his human his 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.500
 a bookworm and philanthropist 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:02.440
 that was done away with hippies 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:06.229
 you do not deserve anything we will go 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:09.020
 and if not at least 67 percent of 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:12.290
 Write a 1.0 in the exam 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.280
 I pop this cat off that was that 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.560
 because they just want me all 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.980
 are crazy about the state ministry for 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:21.020
 science and art short smwk allowed in 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.090
 single-handedly enacted target agreements 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.500
 about the the complete organizational 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.780
 and content structure of the university 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.730
 be regulated when negotiating with 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.250
 universities are inconclusive 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.030
 the control force by a SMWK 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.040
 example 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.810
 It is regulated where for the universities 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.610
 How many monies get in the worst 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.470
 In this case, the ministry turns the money 

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:41.510
 if not according to their ideas 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.430
 the university planning is being traded 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.800
 happens without the participation of the senate 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.750
 or the faculty councils the rectorate and 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.220
 the university council can decide on its own 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:50.930
 which direction the college take 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.580
 the senate should be the representative of all 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:53.570
 College groups loses in favor 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.850
 economic interests 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:57.769
 For example, the senate does not even have 

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:00.200
 more something in the election proposal of the Rector 

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:02.049
 total commitments is a decrease in the 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.560
 quality of teaching through monetary 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:05.269
 control mechanisms via imap 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:07.340
 Regulation are graduates as well 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:09.290
 Graduates pay to watch the 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:10.940
 quality of teaching says the bottomless 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:13.190
 because everyone is going through with the quote 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.810
 the evaluation is not broken 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:16.730
 has become stricter and will only be all 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.019
 two years ago let's go to 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.920
 Stura maybe we can go 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:20.920
 still help anyway 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:35.060
 Holiday gives the advice of the 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.709
 stuhrer are no longer for everyone 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.349
 accessible but only for the 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:41.269
 not according to § 24 leaked 

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:43.340
 students fall in the worst case 

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:45.290
 entire counseling away this 

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.450
 concerns about the independent bafög 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:49.459
 side job and exam advice for it 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.870
 these offers financially complex 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:52.760
 training for the consultants and 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.019
 Counselors are also necessary here 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.060
 is financial planning security 

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:58.459
 the stura and the fs he that 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.590
 main problems live rehearsal exams 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:02.840
 Students plan counseling mediation 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.700
 at problem with the teaching internship 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.459

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:09.560
 Excursions all this costs money and 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:11.480
 is only with financial security plan 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.010
 wait for michael to know that mine 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.840

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.209

 semester over the regular study period and 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.130
 then not even the coal on the 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:24.410
 instead of sitting down 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:25.280
 the people flutter in the ear for types like 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:29.260

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.260
 long-term study fees introduced 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.580
