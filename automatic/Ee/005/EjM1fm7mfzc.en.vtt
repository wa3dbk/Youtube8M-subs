actually caricature a cartoon that's
that's<00:00:18.110> really<00:00:18.320> how<00:00:18.500> it's<00:00:18.680> done<00:00:18.920> a<00:00:19.280> lot<00:00:19.730> of

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:19.760 
that's really how it's done a lot of

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.220 
that's really how it's done a lot of
people<00:00:20.000> think<00:00:20.210> that<00:00:20.270> you<00:00:20.360> take<00:00:20.570> a<00:00:20.600> real<00:00:20.840> animal

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:21.230 
people think that you take a real animal

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.650 
people think that you take a real animal
if<00:00:21.350> you<00:00:21.440> can<00:00:21.560> draw<00:00:21.740> a<00:00:21.770> cartoon<00:00:22.040> animal<00:00:22.660> and

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:23.660 
if you can draw a cartoon animal and

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.400 
if you can draw a cartoon animal and
that<00:00:24.290> you<00:00:24.970> kind<00:00:25.970> of<00:00:26.060> change<00:00:26.810> it<00:00:26.960> a<00:00:27.020> little<00:00:27.230> bit

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:27.410 
that you kind of change it a little bit

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:28.690 
that you kind of change it a little bit
to<00:00:27.560> make<00:00:27.650> it<00:00:27.770> look<00:00:27.890> like<00:00:27.980> a<00:00:28.040> cartoon<00:00:28.520> but

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:28.700 
to make it look like a cartoon but

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.760 
to make it look like a cartoon but
they're<00:00:28.850> so<00:00:29.030> wildly<00:00:29.570> different<00:00:30.050> from<00:00:30.140> real

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:30.770 
they're so wildly different from real

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:32.829 
they're so wildly different from real
animals<00:00:31.190> the<00:00:31.370> cartoon<00:00:31.700> animals<00:00:32.029> that<00:00:32.570> we<00:00:32.719> are

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:32.839 
animals the cartoon animals that we are

00:00:32.839 --> 00:00:35.529 
animals the cartoon animals that we are
really<00:00:33.079> just<00:00:33.410> basically<00:00:34.120> creating<00:00:35.120> an<00:00:35.179> animal

00:00:35.529 --> 00:00:35.539 
really just basically creating an animal

00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:37.479 
really just basically creating an animal
for<00:00:35.750> what<00:00:36.050> we<00:00:36.170> think<00:00:36.410> a<00:00:36.589> cartoon<00:00:37.100> will<00:00:37.339> look

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:37.489 
for what we think a cartoon will look

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:39.759 
for what we think a cartoon will look
like<00:00:37.749> so<00:00:38.749> let's<00:00:38.780> do<00:00:39.109> that<00:00:39.260> now<00:00:39.440> there's<00:00:39.620> no

00:00:39.759 --> 00:00:39.769 
like so let's do that now there's no

00:00:39.769 --> 00:00:41.349 
like so let's do that now there's no
animal<00:00:40.160> that<00:00:40.249> has<00:00:40.730> that<00:00:40.910> for<00:00:41.179> a<00:00:41.210> head

00:00:41.349 --> 00:00:41.359 
animal that has that for a head

00:00:41.359 --> 00:00:44.500 
animal that has that for a head
construction<00:00:41.899> not<00:00:42.769> even<00:00:42.980> close<00:00:43.190> this<00:00:43.999> animal

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
construction not even close this animal

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.479 
construction not even close this animal
will<00:00:44.749> not<00:00:44.780> look<00:00:45.230> at<00:00:45.440> all<00:00:45.679> like<00:00:45.710> the<00:00:46.010> real<00:00:46.159> thing

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489 
will not look at all like the real thing

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:48.310 
will not look at all like the real thing
and<00:00:46.730> yet<00:00:47.030> we'll<00:00:47.239> know<00:00:47.329> exactly<00:00:47.809> what<00:00:47.989> it<00:00:48.079> is<00:00:48.140> by

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:48.320 
and yet we'll know exactly what it is by

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.680 
and yet we'll know exactly what it is by
the<00:00:48.379> time<00:00:48.530> I<00:00:48.589> finish<00:00:49.239> because<00:00:50.239> we're<00:00:50.480> so<00:00:50.629> used

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:50.690 
the time I finish because we're so used

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:56.169 
the time I finish because we're so used
to<00:00:50.960> seeing<00:00:51.170> cartoons<00:00:53.079> back<00:00:54.079> in<00:00:54.440> the<00:00:55.179> early

00:00:56.169 --> 00:00:56.179 
to seeing cartoons back in the early

00:00:56.179 --> 00:00:58.899 
to seeing cartoons back in the early
days<00:00:56.589> animation<00:00:57.589> they<00:00:58.280> had<00:00:58.429> to<00:00:58.519> be<00:00:58.609> much<00:00:58.729> more

00:00:58.899 --> 00:00:58.909 
days animation they had to be much more

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:03.279 
days animation they had to be much more
realistically<00:00:59.510> drawn<00:01:01.479> because<00:01:02.479> people

00:01:03.279 --> 00:01:03.289 
realistically drawn because people

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:05.020 
realistically drawn because people
weren't<00:01:03.769> quite<00:01:04.220> used<00:01:04.460> to<00:01:04.550> seeing<00:01:04.910> the

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
weren't quite used to seeing the

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:07.480 
weren't quite used to seeing the
cartoons<00:01:05.510> now<00:01:06.110> we<00:01:06.170> can<00:01:06.470> really<00:01:06.890> exaggerate

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:07.490 
cartoons now we can really exaggerate

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.580 
cartoons now we can really exaggerate
them<00:01:07.700> and<00:01:07.970> everyone<00:01:08.720> will<00:01:08.810> know<00:01:08.840> what<00:01:09.050> it<00:01:09.140> is

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.190 

at<00:01:12.590> least<00:01:12.740> I<00:01:12.950> hope<00:01:13.130> so<00:01:13.430> bridge<00:01:14.420> of<00:01:14.540> the<00:01:14.600> nose<00:01:14.630> a

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
at least I hope so bridge of the nose a

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.140 
at least I hope so bridge of the nose a
little<00:01:15.650> bit<00:01:15.980> of<00:01:16.070> shading<00:01:16.310> coming<00:01:16.670> out<00:01:16.760> to<00:01:16.970> make

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.150 
little bit of shading coming out to make

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.690 
little bit of shading coming out to make
it<00:01:17.210> look<00:01:17.330> like<00:01:17.540> it's<00:01:17.630> coming<00:01:17.660> toward<00:01:18.140> us<00:01:18.700> split

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:19.700 
it look like it's coming toward us split

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:26.800 
it look like it's coming toward us split
lip<00:01:21.100> like<00:01:22.100> so<00:01:23.020> pads<00:01:24.020> on<00:01:24.260> the<00:01:24.350> side<00:01:25.450> big<00:01:26.450> chin

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
lip like so pads on the side big chin

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.110 
lip like so pads on the side big chin
let<00:01:27.020> me<00:01:27.080> see<00:01:27.230> you<00:01:27.290> play<00:01:27.470> these<00:01:28.370> don't<00:01:28.610> erase<00:01:28.880> so

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:29.120 
let me see you play these don't erase so

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.420 
let me see you play these don't erase so
well<00:01:29.300> it'll<00:01:29.630> lighten<00:01:29.870> this<00:01:30.080> up<00:01:30.430> the

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 
well it'll lighten this up the

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.840 
well it'll lighten this up the
guidelines<00:01:31.910> they're<00:01:33.220> kind<00:01:34.220> of<00:01:34.280> ruffles<00:01:34.610> under

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
guidelines they're kind of ruffles under

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:42.760 
guidelines they're kind of ruffles under
here<00:01:37.780> and<00:01:38.780> ruffles<00:01:39.530> over<00:01:39.770> here<00:01:40.040> as<00:01:40.130> well<00:01:41.770> nice

needs<00:01:47.030> a<00:01:47.120> few<00:01:47.360> we're<00:01:47.960> just<00:01:48.170> keying<00:01:48.560> the

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 
needs a few we're just keying the

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.190 
needs a few we're just keying the
audience<00:01:49.190> into<00:01:49.670> knowing<00:01:50.450> exactly<00:01:50.570> what<00:01:51.080> this

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:51.200 
audience into knowing exactly what this

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:55.990 
audience into knowing exactly what this
this<00:01:51.830> creature<00:01:52.220> is<00:01:52.840> and<00:01:54.520> finish<00:01:55.520> with<00:01:55.760> some

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
this creature is and finish with some

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.850 
this creature is and finish with some
whiskers<00:01:56.390> like<00:01:56.980> so<00:01:57.980> and<00:01:58.330> as<00:01:59.330> you<00:01:59.450> can<00:01:59.540> see<00:01:59.860> we

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
whiskers like so and as you can see we

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.110 
whiskers like so and as you can see we
don't<00:02:00.950> have<00:02:01.070> much<00:02:01.370> difficulty<00:02:01.760> you<00:02:02.000> know

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:02.120 
don't have much difficulty you know

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.730 
don't have much difficulty you know
exactly<00:02:02.690> what<00:02:02.870> kind<00:02:03.050> of<00:02:03.200> character<00:02:03.560> this<00:02:03.680> is

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 
exactly what kind of character this is

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:04.990 
exactly what kind of character this is
even<00:02:04.220> though<00:02:04.310> it<00:02:04.430> doesn't<00:02:04.580> look<00:02:04.670> at<00:02:04.850> all<00:02:04.880> like

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:05.000 
even though it doesn't look at all like
