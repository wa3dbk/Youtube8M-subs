00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
out of the pan I also use the cooling

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:32.990 
out of the pan I also use the cooling
grid<00:00:30.060> for<00:00:30.419> that<00:00:30.570> now<00:00:31.409> I<00:00:31.650> use<00:00:31.890> cake<00:00:32.220> circles<00:00:32.760> and

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
grid for that now I use cake circles and

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000 
grid for that now I use cake circles and
I<00:00:33.090> cover<00:00:33.330> them<00:00:33.540> with<00:00:33.690> a<00:00:33.750> fancy<00:00:34.110> foil<00:00:34.590> so<00:00:34.860> that

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
I cover them with a fancy foil so that

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.950 
I cover them with a fancy foil so that
they<00:00:35.130> look<00:00:35.280> attractive<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:36.150> I<00:00:36.210> match<00:00:36.450> them<00:00:36.780> to

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
they look attractive and I match them to

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.750 
they look attractive and I match them to
meet<00:00:37.200> the<00:00:37.620> size<00:00:37.890> of<00:00:38.130> the<00:00:38.220> cake<00:00:38.460> that<00:00:38.640> I'm

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
meet the size of the cake that I'm

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.300 
meet the size of the cake that I'm
actually<00:00:38.970> doing<00:00:39.360> for<00:00:40.200> leveling<00:00:40.710> you<00:00:40.980> can<00:00:41.160> use

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:41.310 
actually doing for leveling you can use

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:43.490 
actually doing for leveling you can use
a<00:00:41.340> serrated<00:00:41.760> knife<00:00:41.970> or<00:00:42.420> you<00:00:42.510> can<00:00:42.660> actually<00:00:42.870> use

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
a serrated knife or you can actually use

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.500 
a serrated knife or you can actually use
a<00:00:44.310> leveler

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
a leveler

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.410 
a leveler
I<00:00:45.830> also<00:00:46.830> like<00:00:47.130> a<00:00:47.160> turntable<00:00:47.790> so<00:00:48.090> that<00:00:48.210> when<00:00:48.330> I'm

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
I also like a turntable so that when I'm

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.600 
I also like a turntable so that when I'm
decorating<00:00:48.990> I<00:00:49.110> can<00:00:49.260> spin<00:00:49.530> it<00:00:49.650> around<00:00:49.740> and<00:00:50.430> it's

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
decorating I can spin it around and it's

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.160 
decorating I can spin it around and it's
easier<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:51.150> get<00:00:51.300> to<00:00:51.480> some<00:00:51.690> of<00:00:51.780> the<00:00:51.840> different

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170
