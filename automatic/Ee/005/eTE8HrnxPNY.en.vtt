00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:10.080
 hello the player uncle here 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.570
 I'm not just doing power right now 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.280
 break at my ipad and read newspapers 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.410
 no, it's not about that fractal 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.140
 design also has an app meanwhile 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:22.439
 with the factor design all its 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.869
 digitally archiving products 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.720
 and I want you now briefly 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.119
 So imagine those on the fractal 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.740
 Design app lets you look at the whole 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.770
 asked to look at products 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.840
 so it's digital content that helps 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.360
 Of course, when buying decision one 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.309
 can imagine how the housing 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.050
 It looks like we are looking now 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:45.000
 and that is clear on products then clear 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.000
 show the products so I take 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.950
 now as an example the us series and 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.530
 For example, here's the big one 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.750
 So it's his that the flagship model 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:57.000
 xl so if you have one now 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.160
 here at different paris and indeed 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.500
 Once feature animation is a video 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.049
 that means you can get the housing in 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.299
 all calm in video watch street quite 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.180
 slowly then you can also fast forward like that 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.280
 that makes it all clear details 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.170
 then you can and that is a very complete 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.390
 interesting and great thing when 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:19.140
 also mental reality that means if 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.270
 I click this bank here then 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.710
 you have to go ahead or you can do that 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.810
 even directly on the fractal design 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.829
 This is what we do here in this page 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.890
 on the monitor is namely on 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.880
 the page that is the page in the net 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.970
 under downloads that means 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.130
 augmented reality trigger this image 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.799
 So it 's a picture that you need around the picture 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.970
 to trigger augmented reality and wants 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.220
 what happens then I show you 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.890
 Now here together 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:50.549
 that's nice because you can see that 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.869
 housing in the picture and can be so and that is 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.200
 the beautiful look 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:57.990
 Here you can see all the details like this 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.600
 window when I do it then you see 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.680
 for example, and the fan I go 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.790
 up 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.600
 not at all, for example, the back 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.700
 look at 

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.590
 i can turn that so it is very 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.360
 very funny that makes a lot of fun 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.650
 all things even if you are so 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.670
 wants to buy a housing then you have 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.240
 really good view 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.740
 not only in the outer but 

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.240
 also inside 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:22.100
 So that's an interesting thing 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.760
 says you need this, however 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.980
 screen 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.360
 but you can also print that out 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.960
 Let's put on the table as a note 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:35.390
 and also do and the third thing it does 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:38.270
 Still there is called virtual reality and there 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.820
 then you have the possibility the housing 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:44.720
 not from them but only from 

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:46.580
 to look outside to rotate enlarge 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.820
 but I saw then comes inside 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.470
 purely beautifully located can then at 

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:53.300
 look there is smaller 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.710
 Of course that's a nice thing, too 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.360
 if you want to buy such a device 

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:58.190
 then you can see how it looks 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.780
 because of how it sees like they 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.680
 in the features of how is the 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:04.220
 delivery 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.960
 So this app is very useful there 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.790
 she stops as you see here for ios 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.260
 it also for android which is not yet 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.280
 complete are still videos 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.700
 not all are replenished yet 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.200
 but in it is piece by piece complete 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.030
 Completed and then I think it is 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.950
 That's a good thing when you're at it 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.840
 you virtually buy it virtually 

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.930
 just want to look or virtually 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:26.100
 want what you would like to have 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.110
 yes, if you are so nice with me 

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.450
 want to play virtual cases or 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:32.700
 Turning around and doing that is a good one 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:34.560
 As far as this app is concerned, it too will be important 

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.520
 still extended is not yet final can 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.590
 I only recommend 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.420
 especially this type of virtual shopping 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.370
 I think that's nice, they have that 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:43.320
 well done and that helps 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.510
 every case so as I said try it 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:49.040
 It's easy to find out in the app 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.040
 store or old at the play store
