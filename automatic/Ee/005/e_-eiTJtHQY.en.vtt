automatically<00:02:26.070> on<00:02:26.190> the<00:02:26.220> plane<00:02:26.510> now<00:02:27.510> you<00:02:27.570> use

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
automatically on the plane now you use

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.570 
automatically on the plane now you use

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:35.070 
the actual view of the plane and it's

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:37.010 
the actual view of the plane and it's
it's<00:02:35.490> pretty<00:02:35.910> awesome<00:02:36.150> I<00:02:36.450> have<00:02:36.570> to<00:02:36.690> admit<00:02:36.840> this

meters<00:02:52.050> on<00:02:52.140> the<00:02:52.230> range<00:02:52.440> then<00:02:52.709> you'll<00:02:52.830> lose<00:02:53.010> the

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:53.220 
meters on the range then you'll lose the

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.840 
meters on the range then you'll lose the
ERC<00:02:53.490> entity<00:02:54.060> which<00:02:55.020> kind<00:02:55.320> of<00:02:55.380> sucks<00:02:55.650> so<00:02:55.920> be

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
ERC entity which kind of sucks so be

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:57.890 
ERC entity which kind of sucks so be
careful<00:02:57.209> when<00:02:57.300> you're<00:02:57.390> doing<00:02:57.630> that<00:02:57.750> it's

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
careful when you're doing that it's

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:59.600 
careful when you're doing that it's
really<00:02:58.440> from<00:02:58.650> the<00:02:58.740> player<00:02:58.950> there's<00:02:59.190> no<00:02:59.280> way<00:02:59.459> it

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610
