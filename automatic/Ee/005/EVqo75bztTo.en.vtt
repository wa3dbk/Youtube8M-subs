I<00:00:50.460> simply<00:00:51.239> use<00:00:51.660> a<00:00:52.280> USB<00:00:53.480> memory<00:00:54.480> card<00:00:54.870> reader<00:00:55.070> to

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
I simply use a USB memory card reader to

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.630 
I simply use a USB memory card reader to
manage<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.180> files<00:00:57.390> on<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:57.750> memory<00:00:58.079> card<00:00:58.640> when

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
it this is the actual memory card reader

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.370 
it this is the actual memory card reader
that<00:01:20.939> I<00:01:20.970> had<00:01:21.270> this<00:01:22.159> transcend<00:01:23.159> works<00:01:23.880> great<00:01:24.380> if

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
that I had this transcend works great if
