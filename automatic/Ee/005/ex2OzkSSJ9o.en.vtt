00:00:02.689 --> 00:00:06.990
 hello everyone knows madness the 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.000
 bomb h super happy to be there actually 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.309
 I'm coming back to tell you about a 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.440
 new concept called the glory 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.519
 to the lines so what am I going to do 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.529
 today is that I'm going to you 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.500
 explain what I bought for what 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.720
 where and for what reason so 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.820
 today we start with a gorilla 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.250
 to the lines of a shop I love 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.840
 is uncle of Africa it's not good 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.990
 it's proud because the real frozen sachets 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.369
 cracked in the street so here's uncle 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:38.030
 of Africa c1 stores that are located 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:41.460
 to the 37 rené coty to his outfits by 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:43.520
 minorities what and so that's when 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:48.329
 I bought there I love this morning 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:50.969
 it is then a basic for the summer I 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:53.850
 bought a harem pants 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.160
 because as everyone knows I love it 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.640
 the sarouels this one is very good 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.969
 because he is alas 6 at the level of the 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.579
 cut 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.110
 so I had one that looks like this 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.630
 was not exactly the same but there 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.220
 look like and down there is also 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.409
 closed so if you want to do a 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.320
 shoe detail at it's easier 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.659
 that if it was not closed so that's it 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.540
 then the march shape and a sarouel and 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:21.960
 rather corollary at the level of 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:25.939
 corolla and in addition it has pocket 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.939
 so let's admit if you want to put 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:33.960
 your iphone or your phone 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:39.240
 to the hole or money or and so it's 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:40.110
 it is savored I was paying and I 11090 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.470
 really think it's a good 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.020
 case 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.759
 because I've been to see at zara I 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.920
 did not find I was seeing at mym 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.299
 I did not find I was sick I 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.310
 did not do a brief I could not 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.010
 and there I found 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:57.800
 then j -h 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:02:00.500
 and actually a white tailor for everything 

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.090
 what is maintenance so he is endowed 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.700
 poles is as you can the 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:07.700
 to see but not too big because 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:10.700
 that as if you are like me done in 

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:14.900
 it's complicated here it is endowed 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:17.930
 also stapled and not buttons and 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:20.600
 I think it's a lot saic and 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:24.440
 sexy so that's the jacket 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:26.060
 that's me I took in 36 not what I 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.580
 do 40 but I tell myself that it is 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:31.310
 still more exciting is 36 and 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.210
 it has pants that I have 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.880
 really loved 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:37.640
 I love because in fact the belt 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.790
 it is wide which allows to pass 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:44.480
 a big belt must finish 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:46.640
 to dress up for example red voice and in 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.970
 further down it is somewhat not jeff 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:52.130
 so this also helps if you have 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.320
 for example mules at what we see 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:57.110
 that pointy tip and that if you want 

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:59.030
 to go out to your at your belt france 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:02.030
 love to be pissed off what and for 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:04.820
 finish the tailor I paid 39 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.709
 euros 90 so yes it's expensive but I 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:09.250
 think it's an investment and a 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:13.400
 white tailor jus say it's a basic 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:15.620
 you can put for example in April 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.170
 next in body and next April 

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:21.800
 next etc 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:24.739
 to finish I have an evening tonight 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:28.010
 compared to forgetfulness so I got 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:30.350
 allowed to buy this dress that I love 

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:33.260
 so here is the bone and the 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:38.120
 colors of Belgium because I am 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:40.340
 am told why not and then me what 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:43.280
 I also love it is that he was going to endow 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:46.720
 of that so after you can 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:49.010
 possibly hang it on a hanger 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:53.090
 or 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:54.439
 or at a door finally these practices and the 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.970
 second thing that's practical it's 

00:03:54.439 --> 00:04:01.519
 that so this dress she is padded 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:03.140
 so what makes us believe in 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:08.480
 evening that for example you can do 

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:10.849
 of the 95 b and once you brought back 

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:11.450
 the person at you good you take off 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:13.400
 your dress 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:16.459
 good you do Monday 95th I mean 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:18.380
 she is here she will not go 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:21.229
 do I also like it is that alan 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.910
 empiricist cut that is to say that the 

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:26.389
 size she's directly under the 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:30.430
 breasts so that makes it a silhouette a 

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:34.340
 a little jugular what finally the ngo 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:36.830
 that's it and that's all for my 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:39.169
