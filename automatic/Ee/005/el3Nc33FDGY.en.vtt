00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:07.920
 Oh it is in Japan martial arts tool 

00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:09.820
 For supplying the left electric song when this is referred to in the ground 

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:14.070
 I do not mind 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:18.920
 Is to become to the pilot's happened w of solving that 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:23.210
 This battery can not be used at first to start the engine in expectation 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:27.420
 During flight, the power of the engine generates electricity and the electricity operates the airframe 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:35.730
 I'm greedy in principle because I'm controlling, but he's not 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:36.750
 However, when the generator breaks down , it takes the power to operate the airframe and takes an important role with the supplier. 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:43.610
 Not 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:43.610
 Indeed , high power and reliability are required as a lifeline 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:55.000
 Detailed cause investigation is from now on, but organizes what we understood so far 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:56.800
 Photos I mean aeration This was the trouble that photo that Transportation Safety Board of the country have taken 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.290
 is 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:03.920
 The first four batteries of eight are not lined up in the case of Zen road 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.920
 It is blue 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:14.440
 Than it is outside shape losing streak will remain black and the big star 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:17.920
 You because you've been in an abnormal high temperature 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:23.270
 I wonder if you'll do now why this so in 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:26.479
 24 batteries use flammable electrolytes to make high voltage 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:30.250
 It is easy to be originally this and in the worst case 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:34.360
 Also it has a weak point that there can be a lot 

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:40.400
 Therefore , after controlling the current with the control system, 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:46.190
 There is a safety device that automatically stops charging when it catches 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:48.080
 Become here to voltage for any reason when you are charging or when you are Den 9 schools 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:53.440
 Air pressure becomes very high 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:57.730
 It means that the case where the excessive current flows is considered 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:02:03.790
 The trouble happened because the battery was not used during the flight 

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:06.140
 There is a possibility that charging has been performed because it is designed to be charged automatically according to the remaining amount 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:11.959
 There is 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:12.980
 Power system to control bird experts may have problems with the battery itself 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:16.170
 In error 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:21.890
 I think that it is likely to be the cause 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.890
 We talk about the need to cross are Kuwase the whole 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:28.730
 About the impact of the plug 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:32.380
 In response to the invasion of American aviation overture party of Land, Infrastructure and Transport Ministry 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:35.470
 While stopping the sound while ANA and Japan Airlines 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:39.650
 54 flights will be canceled tomorrow and tomorrow 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:47.140
 It is when you are asked to two passengers of 7500 people more than 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:47.140
 If it takes time to determine the cause, it may be difficult to carry out the equipment and blood circulation may further spread. 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:56.090
 You can also see the influence of Japanese companies 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:03:02.069
 77 enemies, including the new material was lighter 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:04.970
 35% Japanese companies are taped and made by Batterymon 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:09.190
 Jenny has been participating since the development stage 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:13.120
 It is also said that made with Japan 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:15.760
 The bird book bears the prestige of Japanese advanced technology 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:23.980
 There is such a side, too 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:26.140
 Furthermore , it is the same as the Boeing 787 in the middle of the development, including Japan's first domestic z 4 square diameter 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.520
 To the common design 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:33.870
 I think so 

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:33.870
 Development schedule may affect development schedule 

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:45.910
 This series of other chestnuts is concerned with the 194 battery and the entire aircraft power system 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:49.890
 In the art of cutting-edge OnStar only 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:54.650
 Click on the cause of the cause and redistribution 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:54.650
 I'm starting to point out that it may take time 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:03.800
 More and more in addition to the Transportation Safety Commission from the impact from the American father 

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:03.800
 First place 5 points including the investigation heritage of the authorities 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.250
 I did not come here for a moment 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:16.540
 I wonder if it is here in the morning 

00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:23.740
 m 1 part &amp; cafe 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:28.170
 Here 

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:31.340
 If that fan is iphone how to say what you say 

00:04:28.170 --> 00:04:33.460
 Gariko 9 has no more clouds 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:35.850
 Hmmm 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.850
 so 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:40.410
 Rice cracker for Osaka 

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:46.610
 Many times at the venue 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:49.160
 Wait 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:51.850
 An 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:51.850
 I am 

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:59.260
 It is the center of the perfect way 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:59.260
 My life here is amazing 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:04.200
 That's the point 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.200
 Hmm 

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:08.210
 There seems to be more
