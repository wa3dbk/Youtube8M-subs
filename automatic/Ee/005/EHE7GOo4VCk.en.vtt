00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
see how long it takes for the actuators

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:56.620 
see how long it takes for the actuators
to<00:01:25.409> extend<00:01:26.009> back<00:01:26.189> into<00:01:26.579> the<00:01:26.729> wax<00:01:27.390> motor<00:01:27.600> body

00:01:56.620 --> 00:01:56.630 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:16.390

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:19.300 

okay<00:02:17.269> looks<00:02:17.510> like<00:02:17.629> it's<00:02:17.810> starting<00:02:18.739> to<00:02:19.010> move<00:02:19.159> a

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
okay looks like it's starting to move a

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:30.289 
okay looks like it's starting to move a
little<00:02:19.430> bit

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:30.299 

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:32.580 

that's<00:02:31.299> a<00:02:31.390> slow<00:02:31.750> process<00:02:32.230> takes<00:02:32.470> a<00:02:32.560> couple

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:32.590

that's a slow process takes a couple
minutes<00:02:32.830> for<00:02:33.190> to<00:02:33.610> fully<00:02:34.590> retract<00:02:35.590> into<00:02:35.980> the

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
minutes for to fully retract into the

00:02:36.370 --> 00:03:07.339 
minutes for to fully retract into the
wax<00:02:36.940> motor<00:02:37.209> body
