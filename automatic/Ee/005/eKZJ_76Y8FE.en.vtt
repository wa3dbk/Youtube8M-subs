nice right up over the top like so

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:12.980 
nice right up over the top like so
so<00:01:11.310> whether<00:01:11.580> we<00:01:11.729> start<00:01:12.179> with<00:01:12.360> that<00:01:12.569> I<00:01:12.750> need<00:01:12.899> to

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
so whether we start with that I need to

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.660 
so whether we start with that I need to
do<00:01:13.140> the<00:01:13.530> change<00:01:13.800> grip<00:01:13.979> around<00:01:14.069> the<00:01:14.250> head<00:01:14.310> and

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
do the change grip around the head and

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.300 
do the change grip around the head and
then<00:01:15.330> hinge<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.869> tin<00:01:16.080> or<00:01:16.289> I<00:01:16.890> think<00:01:17.190> it's<00:01:17.280> a

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
then hinge the tin or I think it's a

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.010 
then hinge the tin or I think it's a
little<00:01:17.399> more<00:01:17.610> fluid<00:01:17.940> a<00:01:18.030> little<00:01:18.569> more<00:01:18.690> cool<00:01:18.869> if

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
little more fluid a little more cool if

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.719 
little more fluid a little more cool if
we<00:01:19.080> can<00:01:19.229> do<00:01:19.319> them<00:01:19.440> both<00:01:19.530> together<00:01:19.740> although<00:01:20.700> I

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
we can do them both together although I

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.430 
we can do them both together although I
know<00:01:20.880> sometimes<00:01:21.330> if<00:01:21.840> you've<00:01:21.990> got<00:01:22.140> your<00:01:22.259> tin

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:22.440 
know sometimes if you've got your tin

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.290 
know sometimes if you've got your tin
set<00:01:22.740> up<00:01:22.830> upside<00:01:23.100> down<00:01:23.250> on<00:01:23.399> your<00:01:23.520> rail<00:01:23.670> this

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:24.300 
set up upside down on your rail this

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.330 
set up upside down on your rail this
just<00:01:24.569> might<00:01:24.690> be<00:01:24.720> how<00:01:25.020> you<00:01:25.080> start<00:01:25.649> and<00:01:25.890> that's

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
just might be how you start and that's

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.219 
just might be how you start and that's
fine<00:01:26.550> too<00:01:26.580> but<00:01:27.270> I<00:01:27.330> do<00:01:27.420> like<00:01:27.690> to<00:01:27.780> take<00:01:27.929> a<00:01:27.960> tin<00:01:28.200> I

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
fine too but I do like to take a tin I

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.930 
fine too but I do like to take a tin I
think<00:01:28.470> it<00:01:28.530> just<00:01:28.649> adds<00:01:28.799> a<00:01:28.950> nice<00:01:29.039> little<00:01:29.250> extra

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:29.940 
think it just adds a nice little extra

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.279 
think it just adds a nice little extra
element<00:01:30.330> to<00:01:30.420> it<00:01:30.539> here<00:01:30.720> adds<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:31.049> little<00:01:31.170> more

00:01:31.279 --> 00:01:31.289 
element to it here adds a little more

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:33.169 
element to it here adds a little more
flourish<00:01:31.679> a<00:01:31.710> little<00:01:31.950> more<00:01:32.039> flash<00:01:32.190> more<00:01:32.909> Flair

00:01:33.169 --> 00:01:33.179 
flourish a little more flash more Flair

00:01:33.179 --> 00:01:35.120 
flourish a little more flash more Flair
if<00:01:33.390> you<00:01:33.479> will<00:01:33.659> and<00:01:34.590> then<00:01:34.709> we're<00:01:34.830> going<00:01:34.979> to<00:01:35.009> go

we are actually going to put it down

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.620 
we are actually going to put it down
because<00:01:44.070> we<00:01:44.310> are<00:01:44.460> going<00:01:44.610> to<00:01:44.700> start<00:01:44.880> pouring<00:01:45.090> so

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
because we are going to start pouring so

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.600 
because we are going to start pouring so
we<00:01:45.719> can<00:01:45.810> put<00:01:45.960> it<00:01:46.049> down<00:01:46.229> into<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.649> tin<00:01:46.860> and

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
we can put it down into the tin and

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.550 
we can put it down into the tin and
really<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.240> key<00:01:48.479> to<00:01:48.509> this<00:01:48.780> part<00:01:49.079> and<00:01:49.229> getting

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
really the key to this part and getting

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.289 
really the key to this part and getting
this<00:01:49.649> comfortable<00:01:50.310> apart<00:01:50.759> that<00:01:51.000> some<00:01:51.090> people

into the tin get stuck in there and you
don't<00:01:56.340> want<00:01:56.460> it<00:01:56.490> to<00:01:56.579> fall<00:01:56.759> over<00:01:56.939> the<00:01:57.030> back<00:01:57.149> of

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
ring finger here are what grab onto the

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.729 
ring finger here are what grab onto the
bottle<00:02:09.329> I<00:02:09.479> say<00:02:09.810> grab<00:02:10.019> on<00:02:10.200> it's<00:02:10.350> really<00:02:10.560> more<00:02:10.709> of

providing a nice little guidance as it
rolls<00:02:17.700> down<00:02:17.790> my<00:02:17.910> arm<00:02:18.180> so<00:02:18.750> let's<00:02:18.900> go<00:02:19.019> through

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
rolls down my arm so let's go through

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.360 
rolls down my arm so let's go through
that<00:02:19.260> again<00:02:19.440> one<00:02:19.650> more<00:02:19.769> time<00:02:19.829> we've<00:02:20.190> got<00:02:20.280> to

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
that again one more time we've got to

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:23.030 
that again one more time we've got to
change<00:02:20.579> grip<00:02:20.970> I'm<00:02:21.359> hinging<00:02:21.780> the<00:02:21.870> tin<00:02:22.140> we're

here if you can see what I'm doing with
that<00:02:26.850> these<00:02:27.060> two<00:02:27.209> fingers<00:02:27.540> here<00:02:27.590> these<00:02:28.590> two

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:28.829 
that these two fingers here these two

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:31.430 
that these two fingers here these two
fingers<00:02:29.010> there<00:02:29.400> and<00:02:29.579> we<00:02:30.299> are<00:02:30.329> going<00:02:30.570> to<00:02:30.630> roll

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
fingers there and we are going to roll

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.449 
fingers there and we are going to roll
down<00:02:31.739> on<00:02:31.890> the<00:02:31.980> arm

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
down on the arm

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.130 
down on the arm
remember<00:02:32.880> to<00:02:32.970> step<00:02:33.180> into<00:02:33.359> it<00:02:33.569> a<00:02:33.660> little<00:02:33.930> bit

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
remember to step into it a little bit

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.080 
remember to step into it a little bit
once<00:02:34.739> we<00:02:34.859> get<00:02:34.950> to<00:02:35.069> hear<00:02:35.370> the<00:02:35.609> new<00:02:35.760> difference

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
once we get to hear the new difference

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.660 
once we get to hear the new difference
now<00:02:36.269> is<00:02:36.480> instead<00:02:36.840> of<00:02:36.980> popping<00:02:37.980> up<00:02:38.069> grabbing

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
now is instead of popping up grabbing

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.430 
now is instead of popping up grabbing
that<00:02:38.880> bottle<00:02:39.180> what<00:02:39.660> we<00:02:39.750> are<00:02:39.870> going<00:02:39.959> to<00:02:40.019> do<00:02:40.200> is

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:40.440 
that bottle what we are going to do is

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.420 
that bottle what we are going to do is
we're<00:02:40.650> going<00:02:40.680> to<00:02:40.799> go<00:02:40.890> ahead<00:02:40.950> and<00:02:41.130> pull<00:02:41.340> her

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
we're going to go ahead and pull her

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.099 
we're going to go ahead and pull her
hand<00:02:41.670> away<00:02:41.850> and<00:02:42.480> what<00:02:42.569> I<00:02:42.630> like<00:02:42.780> to<00:02:42.870> do<00:02:42.959> is<00:02:43.079> just

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:43.109 
hand away and what I like to do is just

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:44.990 
hand away and what I like to do is just
let<00:02:43.410> the<00:02:43.560> momentum<00:02:44.100> the<00:02:44.250> weight<00:02:44.430> that<00:02:44.699> bottle

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
let the momentum the weight that bottle

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.400 
let the momentum the weight that bottle
is<00:02:45.090> going<00:02:45.150> to<00:02:45.269> cause<00:02:45.419> some<00:02:45.449> momentum<00:02:46.079> to<00:02:46.109> let

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
is going to cause some momentum to let

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:47.810 
is going to cause some momentum to let
you<00:02:46.560> to<00:02:46.680> go<00:02:46.769> ahead<00:02:46.859> and<00:02:47.070> just<00:02:47.160> kind<00:02:47.280> of<00:02:47.370> what<00:02:47.760> I

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:47.820 
you to go ahead and just kind of what I

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.400

call<00:02:47.970> the<00:02:48.000> scoop<00:02:48.389> just<00:02:48.780> this<00:02:48.959> nice<00:02:49.169> kind<00:02:49.320> of

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410
