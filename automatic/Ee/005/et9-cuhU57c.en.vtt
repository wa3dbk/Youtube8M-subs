00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:11.670
 Hello dear friends, today we are in 

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:13.000
 festspielhaus bathing bathing where the 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.400
 Berlin flames 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.860
 Easter Festival invest in this 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:26.619
 opportunity I have the honor with always 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:29.590
 new card in the tent are yes 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:31.210
 very much with 22 then as the youngest 

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.160
 musician ever in berliner 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.420
 Philharmonic can come , then 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.300
 already many years 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.070
 routine now in the concert business and 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.379
 what if it says what has the music at 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:42.760
 all routine dance intense in the 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:47.980
 meaning of life is mainly 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:50.530
 occupation or you can live with this 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:53.020
 in this occupation next to nothing from everyday life 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.329
 so you can not do anything as active 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:59.110
 musician who's about the same as me 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:01.420
 Do where the concerts play in the year 75 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.890
 about berlin philharmonic 75 hearts 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.350
 That is not something you can do with each other 

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.970
 I am on the road every day 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:11.560
 meet people and it always has with the 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:15.369
 I want to do a music job 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:18.939
 I always have something to do with the music 

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:20.350
 That's why it can not be that way 

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:22.960
 to speak correctly of motive because it 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:27.549
 not that mother third concert in 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:30.430
 to announce d-major for the 102 top man 

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:31.960
 a musician other regent of the 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.240
 know daily routine especially we 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:37.750
 that is why the life experience is completely 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:41.740
 it has always been different, too 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:46.600
 but also new types of inspection 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:48.040
 It 's really a day in the life of what 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.570
 develops and knits that way 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.670
 itself helps to stretch 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:53.860
 somehow to knit with that though 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.240
 together with the environment and I believe 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:58.000
 that is very important the relationships to 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.880
 care for the environment as a young 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.829
 Musicians not only on their own 

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.159
 to be dependent on the performance but that 

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:05.159
 together 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:10.600
 the area is a very interesting one 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:12.250
 Above all, I think that instrument 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.960
 one of the oldest instruments ever 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.250
 is 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.600
 and yes today, that still has it 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.090
 many different uses 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:20.820
 actually how important was it for 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.440
 you in your music career 

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.260
 these different areas 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:28.980
 so try not just one 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:32.310
 actually the flute is his 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:37.020
 oldest of the world with the harp about or 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:38.700
 the guitar also has the drum 

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.670
 On the other hand, that's really the ones 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.500
 it is an expression that directly at that time 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.420
 came on the soul of man 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.050
 Practical and it has always been for him 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.670
 neither religious nor spiritual 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:52.890
 matters used at the beginning though 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:58.110
 then it has always become popular too 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:59.640
 that's why Italy's flute has it big 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.610
 in every culture of the rescue 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.440
 permission to build bridges 

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:07.550
 Throughout the travel in Asia 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:09.780
 South America North America with central Europe 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:11.190
 towards the middle east and there 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.220
 unbelievably many different ones 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:16.140
 but all civilizations which is also a 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.020
 have a flute in common or a guitar 

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:21.660
 or hope similar instrument too 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:25.020
 times together you will find that as 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.670
 Constant constant it is metal and 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:28.770
 like what culture of the world otherwise 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:30.260
 Of course, I also have that 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:32.430
 we were lucky too with different ones 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:36.150
 great instrumentalists from these 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:38.430
 cultures had a fantastic opportunity 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.290
 time to play together with him so 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.020
 private or public if it is 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.080
 also found around 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:46.030
 I have made it myself 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:49.360
 great enrichment it something urgent 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:51.580
 his monday after already his pieces in 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:55.330
 his operas are built into his concerts 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:57.010
 has a host of popular music that 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:59.830
 later one was of course still done 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:03.130
 has brands with its organic places 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:04.780
 has also done more often, for example 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:07.960
 or in the violin concert we are 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:10.450
 just wrote and gives in Baden-Baden 

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:12.940
 It also Hungarian action 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:14.620
 last place quite clearly that in 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.120
 things also to franz liszt to 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:22.180
 for example, also to Italy 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:24.310
 Germany has exported this one 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.780
 travel and what you take in luggage with 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:29.290
 I believe that as a composer too 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:33.370
 as an interpretationally important as 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:36.940
 connecting element and last 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:39.010
 question area important is the access 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:40.750
 from children and adolescents to music 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:42.340
 So not only those likely 

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:49.890
 your parents are pre-embossed 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:54.430
 possible further extremely important that we 

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:56.610
 so to speak age without confirmed musician 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:05:00.370
 very close contact together with 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:02.020
 teenagers or with children together 

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:02.730
 not just employees together 

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.530
 music 

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:07.780
 by noticing that we are the same 

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:10.240
 of course, doing things together again 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:11.530
 be to make at various 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:16.710
 become in berlin for example 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:16.710
 Philharmonic started correctly 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:23.200
 but of course I want that 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:25.300
 Names of reliability would be like that 

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.950
 something I also need as a child 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.480
 found that was a concept for me 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:31.900
 I also have the great conductors 

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:34.510
 this world in connection with the name 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:37.030
 also yesterday may need 

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:38.830
 but that belongs as a platform for 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:41.440
 teenagers or four children too 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:44.370
 make music and collaborate with artists 

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:47.560
 I think it really is something 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:49.180
 many curiosity arouses many enthusiasm 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:51.820
 not only with the kids and 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:53.350
 young people but also musicians 

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:57.070
 maybe they should maybe otherwise 

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:59.350
 so in the concert shop a bit too much 

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:01.420
 on reflex or habits of the 

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:03.940
 Burghof's fresh air that's something 

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:06.190
 is very important to finally leads 

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:08.350
 then to speak that to us in the 

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:11.680
 cabin on the akw for example come 

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:13.690
 can and then we still 

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:17.460
 finally be trained so that the 

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:17.460
 then be well prepared 

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:23.250
 Many Thanks
