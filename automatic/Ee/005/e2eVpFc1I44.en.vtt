forward to this match I think that

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.229 
forward to this match I think that
Jericho<00:03:37.680> vs<00:03:37.980> neville<00:03:38.160> really<00:03:38.910> could<00:03:39.090> be<00:03:39.120> a

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
Jericho vs neville really could be a

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:40.610 
Jericho vs neville really could be a
good<00:03:39.420> match<00:03:39.660> and<00:03:39.870> if<00:03:40.019> i<00:03:40.079> had<00:03:40.200> to<00:03:40.290> put<00:03:40.410> money

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
good match and if i had to put money

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:41.930 
good match and if i had to put money
down<00:03:40.709> I'd<00:03:41.010> be<00:03:41.099> putting<00:03:41.220> money<00:03:41.459> on<00:03:41.549> Neville

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
down I'd be putting money on Neville

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.150
