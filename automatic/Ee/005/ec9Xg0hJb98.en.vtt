00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
with a lot of things I think and then we

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.220 
with a lot of things I think and then we
just<00:01:55.490> put<00:01:55.730> one<00:01:55.760> of<00:01:56.030> the<00:01:56.150> white<00:01:56.390> seatbelt<00:01:56.990> bows

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:06.340 
just put one of the white seatbelt bows
on<00:01:57.620> it<00:02:03.640> so<00:02:04.640> they<00:02:04.820> just<00:02:05.090> repel<00:02:05.570> the<00:02:05.660> top<00:02:05.870> face<00:02:06.080> it

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
on it so they just repel the top face it

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.020 
on it so they just repel the top face it
does<00:02:07.450> just<00:02:08.450> like<00:02:08.600> their<00:02:08.810> red<00:02:08.990> velvet<00:02:09.410> bag

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:15.580 
great thing about bags like this as

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:17.370 
great thing about bags like this as
opposed<00:05:15.940> to<00:05:16.090> the<00:05:16.270> bags<00:05:16.449> like<00:05:16.690> this<00:05:16.900> is<00:05:17.169> there<00:05:17.350> a

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:17.380 
opposed to the bags like this is there a

00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:19.230 
opposed to the bags like this is there a
little<00:05:17.530> lighter<00:05:17.860> because<00:05:18.220> they're<00:05:18.490> not<00:05:18.610> woven

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:19.240 
little lighter because they're not woven

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.170 
little lighter because they're not woven
so<00:05:19.750> there's<00:05:19.960> less<00:05:20.740> seat<00:05:21.070> belts<00:05:21.430> because<00:05:21.729> still

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:22.180 
so there's less seat belts because still

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:23.879 
so there's less seat belts because still
out<00:05:22.330> the<00:05:22.449> durability<00:05:22.810> but<00:05:23.350> a<00:05:23.380> little<00:05:23.650> bit

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:23.889 
out the durability but a little bit

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:27.570 
out the durability but a little bit
easier<00:05:24.580> on<00:05:24.729> your<00:05:24.880> arm<00:05:25.030> and<00:05:25.120> shoulder<00:05:25.510> and<00:05:26.580> then

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:27.580 
easier on your arm and shoulder and then

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:31.230 
easier on your arm and shoulder and then
here<00:05:28.030> is<00:05:28.180> the<00:05:28.330> last<00:05:28.660> new<00:05:29.620> color<00:05:29.979> and<00:05:30.760> it's<00:05:30.940> the

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:31.240 
here is the last new color and it's the

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:33.900 
here is the last new color and it's the
copper<00:05:32.080> it's<00:05:32.620> the<00:05:32.830> middle<00:05:33.100> stripe<00:05:33.400> on<00:05:33.699> the

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:33.910 
copper it's the middle stripe on the

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:36.240 
copper it's the middle stripe on the
warm<00:05:34.150> color<00:05:34.449> block<00:05:34.720> so<00:05:35.199> you've<00:05:35.800> got<00:05:36.010> the

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:36.250 
warm color block so you've got the

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:38.610 
warm color block so you've got the
copper<00:05:36.520> with<00:05:36.789> the<00:05:36.910> maroon<00:05:37.210> on<00:05:37.449> that<00:05:37.660> one<00:05:37.930> and

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:38.620 
copper with the maroon on that one and

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:42.000 
copper with the maroon on that one and
we<00:05:38.680> also<00:05:39.130> I<00:05:39.850> think<00:05:40.690> the<00:05:40.960> copper<00:05:41.350> really<00:05:41.680> goes

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:42.010 
we also I think the copper really goes

00:05:42.010 --> 00:05:43.800 
we also I think the copper really goes
