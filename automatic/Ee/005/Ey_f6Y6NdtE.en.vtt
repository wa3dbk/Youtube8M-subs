 the abrasive water jet and the pure water jet 

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:31.469
 they are based on pressurized water 

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:35.529
 the water is pressurized 60 thousand pesos and for four thousand 100 barrels 

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:39.740
 then it is transported to the cutting head 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:44.370
 there the pressure water goes through a tiny hole at the end 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:46.689
 the pressure is transformed into speed 

00:05:46.689 --> 00:05:49.969
 that allows the jet of water to perform the cut 

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:53.999
 the abrasive water jet actually erosion to the material that by 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:02.309
