00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
perfected before they really start

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.560 
perfected before they really start
focusing<00:02:38.769> on<00:02:39.160> this<00:02:39.310> third<00:02:39.610> game<00:02:40.000> mode<00:02:40.239> which<00:02:40.420> i

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
focusing on this third game mode which i

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.630 
focusing on this third game mode which i
guess<00:02:40.810> is<00:02:40.840> sort<00:02:41.320> of<00:02:41.410> true<00:02:41.620> over<00:02:41.830> the<00:02:41.920> past<00:02:42.130> call

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.570 
guess is sort of true over the past call
of<00:02:42.730> duty<00:02:42.760> games<00:02:43.150> but<00:02:43.480> I<00:02:44.380> feel<00:02:44.890> like<00:02:45.040> they<00:02:45.340> would

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:45.580 
of duty games but I feel like they would

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:48.150 
of duty games but I feel like they would
put<00:02:45.880> in<00:02:46.030> more<00:02:46.269> effort<00:02:46.380> to<00:02:47.380> especially<00:02:47.950> knowing

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:48.160

now I still I'm just this is what makes
me<00:03:28.209> skeptical<00:03:28.540> about<00:03:28.840> this<00:03:29.049> this<00:03:29.230> is<00:03:29.410> the

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
me skeptical about this this is the

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.350 
me skeptical about this this is the
biggest<00:03:29.739> cop-out<00:03:30.340> answer<00:03:30.579> that<00:03:30.850> you<00:03:30.940> can<00:03:31.120> give

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
biggest cop-out answer that you can give

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.720 
biggest cop-out answer that you can give
oh<00:03:31.600> yeah<00:03:32.200> it's<00:03:32.380> a<00:03:32.470> survival<00:03:33.100> game<00:03:33.220> with<00:03:33.430> normal

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:34.920 
oh yeah it's a survival game with normal
enemies<00:03:34.000> I<00:03:34.090> don't<00:03:34.269> think<00:03:34.450> they're<00:03:34.570> gonna<00:03:34.720> do

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
enemies I don't think they're gonna do

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:36.810 
enemies I don't think they're gonna do
that<00:03:35.140> everyone<00:03:36.040> they<00:03:36.160> know<00:03:36.280> that<00:03:36.459> we<00:03:36.610> didn't

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:36.820 
that everyone they know that we didn't

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:38.819 
that everyone they know that we didn't
like<00:03:37.000> that<00:03:37.209> hey<00:03:37.870> we<00:03:38.049> know<00:03:38.200> it's<00:03:38.350> four<00:03:38.560> player

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:38.829 
like that hey we know it's four player

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:41.310 
like that hey we know it's four player
so<00:03:39.519> at<00:03:39.730> least<00:03:39.910> as<00:03:40.120> for<00:03:40.329> player<00:03:40.600> unlike<00:03:41.049> modern

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.320 
so at least as for player unlike modern

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.930 
so at least as for player unlike modern
warfare<00:03:41.620> 3<00:03:41.769> survival<00:03:42.690> and<00:03:44.040> I<00:03:45.040> mean<00:03:45.820> that's

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
warfare 3 survival and I mean that's

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:47.400 
warfare 3 survival and I mean that's
just<00:03:46.209> not<00:03:46.329> as<00:03:46.480> fun<00:03:46.660> I<00:03:46.690> think<00:03:47.200> they've<00:03:47.380> learned

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:47.410 
just not as fun I think they've learned

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.800 
just not as fun I think they've learned
that<00:03:47.920> we<00:03:48.100> want<00:03:48.489> a<00:03:48.700> zombie-type

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
that we want a zombie-type

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.130 
that we want a zombie-type
no<00:03:50.170> which<00:03:50.560> has<00:03:51.360> replayability<00:03:52.360> for<00:03:52.900> days

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:53.140 
no which has replayability for days

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.500 
no which has replayability for days
something<00:03:53.770> like<00:03:53.920> that<00:03:54.370> and<00:03:54.670> you're<00:03:55.180> just<00:03:55.360> not

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
something like that and you're just not

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:56.880 
something like that and you're just not
going<00:03:55.630> to<00:03:55.720> get<00:03:55.840> that<00:03:55.870> out<00:03:56.080> of<00:03:56.110> survival<00:03:56.709> so<00:03:56.860> I

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:56.890 
going to get that out of survival so I

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:58.410 
going to get that out of survival so I
think<00:03:57.220> they've<00:03:57.400> I<00:03:57.610> think<00:03:57.700> sledgehammers

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
think they've I think sledgehammers

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:59.250
