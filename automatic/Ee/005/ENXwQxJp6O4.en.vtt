keep evolving ways to defend against
being<00:01:11.159> raped<00:01:11.490> but<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:12.000> male<00:01:12.210> ducks<00:01:12.510> evolve

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
being raped but the male ducks evolve

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.260 
being raped but the male ducks evolve
their<00:01:13.260> penises<00:01:13.799> to<00:01:14.100> make<00:01:14.280> sure<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.850> vagina

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
their penises to make sure the vagina

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.870 
their penises to make sure the vagina
stay<00:01:15.479> properly<00:01:15.990> shaped<00:01:16.380> for<00:01:17.189> their<00:01:17.430> penises

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
stay properly shaped for their penises

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.460 
stay properly shaped for their penises
because<00:01:18.030> the<00:01:18.270> vagina<00:01:18.540> spiraled<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.020> opposite

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
because the vagina spiraled the opposite

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.570 
because the vagina spiraled the opposite
way<00:01:19.590> but<00:01:19.860> then<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:19.979> males<00:01:20.189> have<00:01:20.400> a<00:01:20.430> way<00:01:20.520> to

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
way but then the males have a way to

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.980 
way but then the males have a way to
counteract<00:01:20.970> it<00:01:21.210> because<00:01:21.420> they<00:01:21.509> have<00:01:21.600> a<00:01:21.630> Grove

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
counteract it because they have a Grove

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.330 
counteract it because they have a Grove
and<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.290> sperm<00:01:22.530> goes<00:01:22.680> down<00:01:22.890> them<00:01:23.009> it's<00:01:23.159> really

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
and the sperm goes down them it's really

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.080 
and the sperm goes down them it's really
