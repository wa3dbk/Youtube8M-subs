game rules so that gives them a little
more<00:02:17.640> you<00:02:18.510> know<00:02:18.599> power<00:02:18.959> to<00:02:19.170> use<00:02:19.790> so<00:02:20.790> level

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060 
more you know power to use so level

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.000 
more you know power to use so level
three<00:02:21.299> here<00:02:21.569> what<00:02:21.810> we<00:02:21.900> can<00:02:22.049> do<00:02:22.200> this<00:02:22.409> is<00:02:22.739> it

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
three here what we can do this is it

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.670 
three here what we can do this is it
gives<00:02:23.280> them<00:02:23.430> permission<00:02:23.700> to<00:02:23.909> ban<00:02:24.299> players<00:02:24.680> 2d
