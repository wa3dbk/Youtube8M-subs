00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:06.149
 good high media a new video 

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:09.820
 survey and well we go with the question 

00:00:06.149 --> 00:00:11.680
 you believe that the next generation of 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.420
 consoles treatment dominated by the 

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:15.539
 fps shooter games 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:18.339
 first good person we have already seen that 

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:22.630
 well first let's go with the answers 

00:00:18.339 --> 00:00:24.550
 without like and not dislike if you think so 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:26.410
 that will continue to dominate the fps the 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:29.439
 next generation mouth dislike and if 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:31.359
 you think you do not vote tic like really 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:33.580
 the first person games of super 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:36.040
 in this generation they have basically 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:38.410
 triumphant have not rhon have broken they have already 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:41.260
 marked this generation we have not seen 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:44.020
 caliber games of all kinds not in 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.870
 first person shooting not so much 

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:48.010
 butterfield as good both mattel 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.610
 firmat company 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:54.460
 one more company 2 and battlefield 3 have 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:57.220
 triumphed as much as call of duty have 

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.890
 all triumphed too and have really 

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:01.290
 marked the difference in sales and in 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:03.700
 everything has not been the best-selling games 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:05.409
 the games have been mostly more 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:07.190
 player that what really matters is not 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:10.880
 at the end of each month 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:13.520
 It is usually a call of duty or some game 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:16.100
 in first person the most played in the 

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:18.710
 top 1 few times there has been another game 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.840
 in the top 1 have really been dominated 

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.060
 this generation for that reason it does not seem 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.130
 incredible although it seemed incredible by 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.470
 example in times of play season 2 or 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:30.680
 precision 1 well you have mastered this 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.390
 generation I think it's just a 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.370
 fashion not a fashion that I think has 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:37.070
 started and I do not really know when it's going to 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:39.590
 to finish for which my vote I do not know which goes 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:42.320
 to be the position that I have no idea not 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:44.210
 in playstation 1 the platforms were 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.890
 totally 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.229
 to the order of the day the games of 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:51.830
 platforms like cars bandicoot 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:53.510
 they were were cult game plessis are two 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.430
 maybe 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:58.640
 I would not know right now I'm not playing 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:00.890
 football sport of all kinds there was no 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.230
 so nothing would mark the difference not 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.000
 terror game of all kinds but in this 

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:07.840
 generation action the truth is very 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.840
 breaker very 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.210
 very massacre not even some 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.120
 developers have said famous people 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:18.460
 what he has said has said that is that in this 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.890
 generation can not compete account 

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:23.440
 this type of games and shooter games 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.700
 you have hardly anything to do if your 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.110
 company behind does not have the nickname 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.060
 he has nothing to do either 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.370
 really because maybe in part sometimes 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:33.220
 you are right and other times, you can not 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.840
 we have seen games like skyrim we have 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.280
 seen games like oblivion or have we seen 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.410
 games like it was next we have seen 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.470
 games like minecraft or we have seen 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.280
 games like all kinds that have triumphed 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.350
 basically because its mechanics is 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.930
 fun its mechanics is fun 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:49.630
 some is deep other simple is not 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:52.150
 that there is nothing definite that you like 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.069
 really to the people totally but 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.499
 good 

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:58.170
 this generational euros / pers which believes 

00:02:55.499 --> 00:03:00.569
 will be the next what genre you think 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:02.489
 that will make a difference and good 

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:05.159
 especially the question in question 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:07.170
 that formulated at the beginning that you think 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:09.269
 that the next generation will be 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.799
 marked by shooter is again likes and 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:13.739
 think yes and beasley if you think that 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:19.430
 not equal we go with the results of the 

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:19.430
 previous in surveys so he searched for it 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:25.500
 good front survey we ask if 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:27.810
 believes that gta 5 was going to come out in 2012 that 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:33.959
 it was like and if you thought it was going to be in 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:35.489
 2013 that was dislike 830 likes and thousand 299 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.560
 delays let's go that people think that 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:40.230
 will come out in 2013 I also thought that 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.060
 I would leave in 2013 and I still think 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:43.799
 that will come out in 2013 we will see when 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:45.900
 it ends up coming out but well what we 

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:47.370
 occupy is this subject and nothing else I hope you
