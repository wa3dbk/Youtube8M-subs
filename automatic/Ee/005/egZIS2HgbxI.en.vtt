00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
taking a look at the instruction manual

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.030 
taking a look at the instruction manual
there's<00:01:12.720> also<00:01:12.900> the<00:01:13.080> warranty<00:01:13.500> sheet<00:01:13.799> and

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
legs itself slip that up there and here

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.730 
legs itself slip that up there and here
is<00:01:22.830> life<00:01:23.310> form<00:01:23.729> itself<00:01:24.390> so<00:01:24.840> this<00:01:25.500> is<00:01:25.619> actually

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
is life form itself so this is actually

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.140 
is life form itself so this is actually
a<00:01:25.979> pretty<00:01:26.220> cool<00:01:26.460> device<00:01:26.670> haven't<00:01:27.000> seen

anything but I have seen something like
this<00:01:30.960> such<00:01:31.590> as<00:01:31.740> a<00:01:31.770> gorilla<00:01:32.070> pod<00:01:32.340> but<00:01:32.970> I'm<00:01:33.180> glad

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
this such as a gorilla pod but I'm glad

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.240 
this such as a gorilla pod but I'm glad
to<00:01:33.810> check<00:01:34.020> this<00:01:34.110> out<00:01:34.320> and<00:01:34.530> see<00:01:34.829> what<00:01:34.860> it<00:01:35.070> does

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
to check this out and see what it does

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.920 
to check this out and see what it does
so<00:01:35.880> at<00:01:36.000> first<00:01:36.030> it<00:01:36.360> may<00:01:36.450> be<00:01:36.479> a<00:01:36.600> little<00:01:36.720> bit

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
so at first it may be a little bit

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.719 
so at first it may be a little bit
intimidating<00:01:37.560> it<00:01:37.650> looks<00:01:37.829> kind<00:01:38.100> of<00:01:38.159> confusing

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729

the quarter inch thread so you take off

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.190 
the quarter inch thread so you take off
the<00:02:54.200> plate<00:02:54.410> there<00:02:54.620> and<00:02:54.650> it<00:02:54.950> will<00:02:55.100> work<00:02:55.340> fine<00:02:56.200> so

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
the plate there and it will work fine so

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:36.500 
well to my desk it did take a little bit

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.110 
well to my desk it did take a little bit
while<00:03:36.800> to<00:03:37.130> adjust<00:03:37.310> it<00:03:37.700> but<00:03:37.820> once<00:03:37.970> you're<00:03:38.090> used

00:03:59.920 --> 00:03:59.930 
about this I think this is something

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:01.210 
about this I think this is something
that<00:04:00.050> I<00:04:00.170> wouldn't<00:04:00.500> actually<00:04:00.620> use<00:04:00.890> because<00:04:01.100> it

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:01.220 
that I wouldn't actually use because it

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:02.920 
that I wouldn't actually use because it
does<00:04:01.430> seem<00:04:01.610> a<00:04:01.640> little<00:04:01.730> bit<00:04:02.030> confusing<00:04:02.570> in<00:04:02.780> my

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930
