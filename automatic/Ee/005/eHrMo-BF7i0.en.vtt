oh<00:02:07.360> isn't<00:02:07.869> really<00:02:08.200> a<00:02:08.229> primer<00:02:08.530> I<00:02:08.679> was<00:02:08.890> alarming

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:16.700 

I<00:02:11.680> was<00:02:12.129> in<00:02:12.280> another<00:02:12.489> life

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:21.150 

see<00:02:17.710> on<00:02:17.950> the<00:02:18.190> floor<00:02:18.430> here<00:02:18.700> you<00:02:18.910> have<00:02:19.950> more<00:02:20.950> of

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
see on the floor here you have more of

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.220 
see on the floor here you have more of
these<00:02:21.340> you<00:02:21.850> see<00:02:22.090> all<00:02:22.300> these<00:02:22.480> metal<00:02:23.490> this<00:02:25.200> metal

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
these you see all these metal this metal

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.070 
these you see all these metal this metal
I<00:02:26.440> can't<00:02:27.040> used<00:02:27.250> to<00:02:27.400> love<00:02:27.640> to<00:02:27.820> jump<00:02:28.120> on<00:02:28.270> this

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
I can't used to love to jump on this

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.570 
I can't used to love to jump on this
see<00:02:30.410> the<00:02:30.560> chain<00:02:31.060> and<00:02:32.060> all<00:02:32.360> those<00:02:32.570> paddles<00:02:33.580> goes

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
see the chain and all those paddles goes

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.270 
see the chain and all those paddles goes
all<00:02:34.850> the<00:02:34.910> way<00:02:35.360> up<00:02:35.480> there<00:02:35.690> behind<00:02:35.870> the<00:02:36.200> cows

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
all the way up there behind the cows

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.160 
all the way up there behind the cows
and<00:02:38.400> then<00:02:38.550> it<00:02:38.670> probably<00:02:38.910> crosses<00:02:39.720> over<00:02:40.020> up

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
and then it probably crosses over up

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.570 
and then it probably crosses over up
there<00:02:40.200> and<00:02:40.620> comes<00:02:40.860> all<00:02:41.040> the<00:02:41.130> way<00:02:41.190> down<00:02:41.400> the

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
there and comes all the way down the

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:47.380 
there and comes all the way down the
other<00:02:41.700> side<00:02:42.560> you<00:02:43.560> see

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:47.390 

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.300 

when<00:02:47.930> they<00:02:48.110> clean<00:02:48.410> the<00:02:48.560> barn<00:02:48.770> barn<00:02:49.010> cleaner

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
when they clean the barn barn cleaner

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.870 
when they clean the barn barn cleaner
what<00:02:49.820> is<00:02:49.970> that<00:02:50.120> they<00:02:50.240> called<00:02:50.480> those<00:02:50.720> manure

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
what is that they called those manure

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:55.340 
what is that they called those manure
anyway<00:02:52.880> it<00:02:53.510> would<00:02:53.810> move

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
anyway it would move

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.770 
anyway it would move
move<00:02:55.860> right<00:02:55.890> down<00:02:56.400> see<00:02:57.270> there's<00:02:57.480> none<00:02:57.630> of<00:02:57.660> that

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
move right down see there's none of that

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.620 
move right down see there's none of that
up<00:02:58.080> at<00:02:58.230> the<00:02:58.350> front<00:02:58.590> of<00:02:58.680> them<00:02:59.060> as<00:03:00.060> the<00:03:00.240> front<00:03:00.480> is

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
up at the front of them as the front is

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.640 
up at the front of them as the front is
fine

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
fine

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.860 
fine
I<00:03:02.739> suppose<00:03:03.459> the<00:03:03.610> yellow<00:03:03.790> line<00:03:04.120> is<00:03:04.329> to<00:03:04.510> keep<00:03:04.689> us

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
I suppose the yellow line is to keep us

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:10.230 
I suppose the yellow line is to keep us
from<00:03:05.079> walking<00:03:05.500> too<00:03:05.680> close

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:10.240 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.260 

so<00:03:11.240> now<00:03:11.420> you<00:03:11.480> know

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
so now you know

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.750 
so now you know
barn<00:03:12.510> cleaner
