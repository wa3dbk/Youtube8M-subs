00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:13.750
 Greetings 

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:13.750
 our theme is dance as a method of self-knowledge 

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:22.570
 dance from ancient times was considered 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:27.010
 a kind of disclosure tool 7 

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:27.010
 unlocking your creative potential 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:33.160
 modern psychotherapy 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:38.500
 psychology uses this method as 

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:38.500
 a tool of true knowledge of yourself 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.850
 let's say there is a problem difficult to solve 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:50.480
 which you can even call problems 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:53.150
 I recommend you pick up such music 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:58.640
 whose music really touched 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:59.690
 music you can be heartfelt 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.440
 very rhythmic 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:05.810
 or vice versa, it all depends on 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:09.460
 your state of temperament 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:13.460
 the very task that is difficult to solve 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:16.790
 so pick up the kind of music that 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:19.880
 would help you to open up which 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:22.750
 would help hurt certain 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.750
 internal mechanisms 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:32.330
 inclusive and forget all 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:34.580
 memorized movements can be which 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:38.770
 you watched the dancers and the woods 

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:41.590
 used other dances 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:44.080
 close your eyes 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:49.120
 turn on the music 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:52.110
 and start moving moving as 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.110
 wants body 

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:59.100
 immerse yourself in language immerse yourself in your 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.100
 own movements 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:07.560
 a problem flashed through your head 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:10.599
 trust all that produces 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:14.920
 disable whenever possible all about 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:17.879
 logical reasoning on then 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.879
 a miracle will happen 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:25.390
 come down 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:31.360
 will be revealed 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:38.409
 to all yours I answer your question 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:38.409
 the solution will come in an inexplicable way 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:49.310
 act learn to create and 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:51.220
 yourself to the beat of the music and your own 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:55.609
 by movement 

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:59.950
