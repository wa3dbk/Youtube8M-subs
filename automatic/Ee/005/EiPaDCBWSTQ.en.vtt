00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.599 
where you can spin and jump and do stuff
like<00:04:02.900> that<00:04:03.169> if<00:04:03.409> you<00:04:03.799> play<00:04:03.980> as<00:04:04.040> knuckles<00:04:04.489> you've

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:04.609 
like that if you play as knuckles you've

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:05.890 
like that if you play as knuckles you've
already<00:04:04.760> seen<00:04:05.060> that<00:04:05.150> you<00:04:05.239> can<00:04:05.389> glide<00:04:05.629> and

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
already seen that you can glide and

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.899 
already seen that you can glide and
climb<00:04:06.109> on<00:04:06.139> things<00:04:06.500> and<00:04:06.829> it's<00:04:07.370> probably<00:04:07.669> why<00:04:07.879> I

00:04:07.899 --> 00:04:07.909 
climb on things and it's probably why I

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:10.300 
climb on things and it's probably why I
like<00:04:08.030> knuckles<00:04:08.569> best<00:04:08.810> because<00:04:09.079> I<00:04:09.500> always<00:04:10.159> like

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
like knuckles best because I always like

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:11.830 
like knuckles best because I always like
playing<00:04:10.549> as<00:04:10.790> knuckles<00:04:11.090> on<00:04:11.180> all<00:04:11.269> the<00:04:11.359> games<00:04:11.629> so

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
playing as knuckles on all the games so

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:13.479 
playing as knuckles on all the games so
again<00:04:12.290> that's<00:04:12.530> why<00:04:12.680> I<00:04:12.709> like<00:04:12.979> the<00:04:13.190> lock-on

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:13.489 
again that's why I like the lock-on

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:15.099 
again that's why I like the lock-on
feature<00:04:13.760> because<00:04:14.150> I'd<00:04:14.299> always<00:04:14.449> got<00:04:14.810> to<00:04:14.959> play

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:15.109 
feature because I'd always got to play

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:15.699 
feature because I'd always got to play
as<00:04:15.169> knuckles

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:15.709 
as knuckles

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:18.370 
as knuckles
so<00:04:16.280> anyway<00:04:17.120> I'm<00:04:17.329> gonna<00:04:17.510> shut<00:04:18.019> up<00:04:18.049> for<00:04:18.229> a<00:04:18.260> bit

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:18.380 
so anyway I'm gonna shut up for a bit

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:19.479 
so anyway I'm gonna shut up for a bit
late<00:04:18.620> listen<00:04:18.799> to<00:04:19.070> music

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
late listen to music

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:21.219 
late listen to music
I'll<00:04:19.609> cut<00:04:19.909> into<00:04:20.090> the<00:04:20.180> first<00:04:20.419> boss<00:04:20.750> for<00:04:20.959> Sonic

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:21.229 
I'll cut into the first boss for Sonic

00:04:21.229 --> 00:04:22.360 
I'll cut into the first boss for Sonic
and<00:04:21.380> then<00:04:21.470> cut<00:04:21.680> straight<00:04:21.919> into<00:04:22.099> the<00:04:22.159> first

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
and then cut straight into the first

00:04:22.370 --> 00:05:03.659 
and then cut straight into the first
boss<00:04:22.580> for<00:04:22.760> knuckles

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:03.669 

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:06.610 

so<00:05:04.669> anywhere<00:05:05.389> that<00:05:05.569> was<00:05:05.780> about<00:05:05.960> the<00:05:06.050> music<00:05:06.169> and

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:06.620 
so anywhere that was about the music and

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:08.200 
so anywhere that was about the music and
as<00:05:06.740> you<00:05:06.830> might<00:05:06.979> notice<00:05:07.520> there's<00:05:07.910> pretty<00:05:08.150> much

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.210 
as you might notice there's pretty much

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:09.820 
as you might notice there's pretty much
nothing<00:05:08.479> different<00:05:08.990> other<00:05:09.169> than<00:05:09.319> the<00:05:09.410> picture

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:09.830 
nothing different other than the picture

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:12.159 
nothing different other than the picture
so<00:05:10.099> it's<00:05:10.849> just<00:05:11.000> one<00:05:11.210> of<00:05:11.300> those<00:05:11.419> just<00:05:11.780> a<00:05:11.900> totally

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:12.169 
so it's just one of those just a totally

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:13.749 
so it's just one of those just a totally
different<00:05:12.229> gameplay<00:05:12.770> experience<00:05:13.250> playing<00:05:13.490> as

00:05:13.749 --> 00:05:13.759 
different gameplay experience playing as

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:16.210 
different gameplay experience playing as
knuckles<00:05:14.270> our<00:05:14.449> secret<00:05:14.960> permit<00:05:15.349> it's<00:05:15.889> a<00:05:16.009> shim

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:16.220 
knuckles our secret permit it's a shim

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:17.529 
knuckles our secret permit it's a shim
that<00:05:16.400> he<00:05:16.520> doesn't<00:05:16.759> get<00:05:16.819> the<00:05:16.940> full<00:05:17.090> campaign

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:17.539 
that he doesn't get the full campaign

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:19.869 
that he doesn't get the full campaign
but<00:05:17.990> it<00:05:18.500> still<00:05:18.770> is<00:05:18.889> long<00:05:19.099> enough<00:05:19.340> to<00:05:19.550> play

00:05:19.869 --> 00:05:19.879 
but it still is long enough to play

00:05:19.879 --> 00:05:21.670 
but it still is long enough to play
through<00:05:20.120> he's<00:05:20.330> and<00:05:20.599> considering<00:05:21.319> you<00:05:21.470> getting

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:21.680 
through he's and considering you getting

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.260 
through he's and considering you getting
the<00:05:21.740> two<00:05:21.889> campaigns<00:05:22.280> in<00:05:22.520> one<00:05:22.699> technically

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:23.270 
the two campaigns in one technically

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:24.730 
the two campaigns in one technically
then<00:05:23.479> it's<00:05:23.930> definitely<00:05:24.379> worth<00:05:24.530> the<00:05:24.560> money

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:24.740 
then it's definitely worth the money

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:26.200 
then it's definitely worth the money
especially<00:05:25.129> if<00:05:25.490> you<00:05:25.550> own<00:05:25.669> the<00:05:25.789> other<00:05:25.819> Sonic

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:26.210 
especially if you own the other Sonic

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:27.850 
especially if you own the other Sonic
games<00:05:26.419> and<00:05:26.690> you've<00:05:26.780> never<00:05:26.960> experienced<00:05:27.740> the

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860 
games and you've never experienced the

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.580 
games and you've never experienced the
lock-on<00:05:28.129> feature<00:05:28.370> before<00:05:28.580> so<00:05:29.300> yeah<00:05:29.990> nothing
