00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.529
 hello I'm doing the presentation of the 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.259
 macbook air 2012 I had already posted a 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.670
 video on my youtube account and 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.660
 apparently a lot of people 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.940
 complained that there was no 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.710
 no flaw was no way so 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.740
 you hear me well I hope for 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.230
 some so I want to do this 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.570
 presentation 

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:25.199
 so here's the box with the little 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.689
 foam there to protect the computer the 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.070
 plastics that go with 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:30.859
 you have the notice ans it does not change 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.020
 it is always present and 

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:38.129
 right 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:41.610
 the extension to charge and then fans of 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:45.829
 chargers they changed and a lot 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:49.910
 more efficient and smaller also 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:57.270
 so here is after I'm going to show you the 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:01:03.019
 productive bin so you'll see that there 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:07.290
 is pretty cool enough a basic 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:09.420
 I lean you ready for you so 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.820
 he gets off easily he can 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:17.490
 shoot years he is also holding back this time 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:20.400
 here after I show you the macbook air 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:27.170
 the connectivity so there you have a 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:33.450
 first plug usb 3 tab 2 earphones 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:35.329
 to open the window that's all pretty 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:37.710
 impressive 

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:40.790
 so after I 'm going to show you the other 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:44.060
 side if I get there 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.810
 the card reader the other usb socket 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:50.250
 and then loeb 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:54.570
 and then the door ender bold so here 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:57.770
 all in a computer so hungry 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.770
 frankly I say bravo 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.280
 see 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:05.280
 so we have to open it 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:12.140
 I was already seeing so I was doing 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.370
 mounting 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:18.170
 I was using it final cut 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:23.660
 to do the assembly precisely of the 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:26.720
 presentation about the keyboard so 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.310
 I think he has not changed that's all 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.010
 it's the same you just had the 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.590
 button start it is more on the 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.420
 hull but it is well integrated with 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.060
 keyboard so we tend to look 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:42.230
 those who are owners of old 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:43.489
 versions of macbook air macbook pro is 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.110
 what I think the macbook air it has 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:49.430
 always been as to it if I do not 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:51.410
 not deceive so yes I wanted to come back 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:54.110
 at the keyboard so there are some 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:58.120
 people who have problems with this 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:03:03.650
 world sounds with the keys so there 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:05.959
 it's all the same noise and no 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.769
 problem on that side so after you 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:08.769
 have the camera 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:18.710
 who unfortunately did not know who is improved 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:26.530
 apparently and then I show you my 

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:29.750
 configuration then see 601.8 again 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:33.730
 5.4giguÃ¨re of drama so it's enough 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:35.480
 correct me I think for my part 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:39.230
 my use 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:43.930
 it'll stay ok to reindeer we're going 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:49.040
 talk about the tender bolt edge 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:51.860
 you see if ethernet I stayed for 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:56.680
 able to connect precisely my 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:56.680
 computer an ethernet plug 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:05.500
 I plugged in there he looks too 

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:07.880
 easily 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.740
 on the other hand when you me when you 

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.870
 put back took a usb plug next to it and 

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:14.300
 it bothers a little we have trouble getting in the 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.740
 taken usb because if I leave you 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:18.020
 pretty close up apple has always 

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:20.540
 tendency to approach connectivity at the 

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:22.430
 closer obviously I think he 

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:24.080
 do not think otherwise of the report in 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.720
 fineness 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:29.690
 otherwise I will show you how you 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:32.560
 see also so here I kill him esb 

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:32.560
 and a member 

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:37.520
 so here we go I can not put it 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:43.300
 correctly but against it is 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:45.700
 recognized the voice files on the desktop 

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:50.210
 but the main thing is that she 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:53.170
 can we can usb trade so 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:53.170
 here 

00:04:57.319 --> 00:05:00.780
 about the cover yes I'm going to you 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.460
 put a wheel I showed you the 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:05.039
 road that I bought after some 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:06.990
 people but truncated over 

00:05:05.039 --> 00:05:10.770
 everyone does as he wants I'll go 

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:14.580
 present this so I bought a 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:16.199
 little pouch like that had to 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:21.060
 know the mark someday reach the 

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:25.470
 mark no more for the so here is to 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:29.430
 opening his side I think it's okay 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:31.199
 it still remains quite appreciable I 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:34.530
 put you so I'm going to put you 

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:37.289
 the computer from in the collection you 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:42.110
 go see I shut down my computer I the 

00:05:37.289 --> 00:05:42.110
 put it well inside 

00:05:43.819 --> 00:05:51.449
 there you see me there inside it's 

00:05:49.349 --> 00:05:53.389
 not very thick and carrying had 

00:05:51.449 --> 00:05:56.880
 proven 

00:05:53.389 --> 00:06:02.370
 there's no worries about that it's good 

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:04.020
 gear if ever and shock where it falls 

00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:04.199
 you see that belongs a little when 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:07.380
 even 

00:06:04.199 --> 00:06:10.500
 it's always better, so here we go 

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:13.430
 in the presentation of the macbook air 2012 

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:16.259
