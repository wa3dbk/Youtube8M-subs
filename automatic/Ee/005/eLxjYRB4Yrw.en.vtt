00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:22.310
 which are the most frequent pathologies 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:25.160
 that you treat and what the interventions are 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.560
 that you run with more difficulty than that 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:29.509
 which can create you a problem at the level 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.210
 also aesthetic because clearly the 

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:33.380
 interventions on the bones then yes 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.870
 also affect only one 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:39.320
 on the aesthetics of the face 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:43.760
 then we say that it is a very argument 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:46.399
 vast difficult to eviscerate in 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:49.700
 few words but we will go into this ours 

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:51.980
 Search on a simple way e 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.410
 demonstrative to make people understand 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.390
 such as medical experiences 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.000
 are the diseases that affect the 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.640
 facial district then we begin 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.930
 from the pathologies to the ancient auctore us 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:07.640
 we know that 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:11.580
 our teeth are worn in the bone 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:13.320
 and our teeth once untreated 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.430
 I can also bring diseases 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:20.360
 of the bone or a cavity penetrating the 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:23.520
 Venetian dental leads to an infection 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:26.369
 this infection is transmitted to the level 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.800
 of the tooth apex and can lead to 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.210
 but their granuloma formation 

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.979
 no, but what is it? 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.070
 I don't have but it's not a pathology but it is 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:36.810
 a reaction that the organism has in the 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.270
 against infection 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.450
 keep in mind for example one 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.430
 thorn that we trust in our hand 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.430
 the organism in the capsule and forms one 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:50.340
 granulomatous reaction species for which 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.600
 it prevents such infections from being transmitted 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.270
 also that he was a little thin loma 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:57.320
 initially it started as a reaction 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.610
 of the organism to direction after which 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.590
 being fed by the continuous 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.740
 live infection worth this no 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:07.500
 purcell moments for which increases the 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:11.760
 its bacterial load increases in volume 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:14.700
 the organism reacts and at this point yes 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:17.160
 can pass from the Roman cranes to the cyst or 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.650
 verona cysts of origin all 8 Jan 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.230
 it is nothing but a granuloma itself 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.510
 greatly enlarged and begins to 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:28.709
 to be autonomous so the moment of you 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:31.350
 if it increases its internal capacity of 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:33.360
 pressure and therefore with the pressure that 

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:36.299
 it's inside the alisi terminal 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:39.510
 of the surrounding bone for which we can 

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:42.870
 form huge cysts other types of 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.519
 cysts are not effective cysts but they are 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.350
 cysts of always non- genetic hours 

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:49.019
 derive for example from a sack 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.340
 follicular not now while we first have 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:53.260
 we are in presence 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:56.200
 radicular or that starts from the root 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.150
 of the decisive tooth the castings are 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.610
 warlike that start from the follicle of 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.099
 tooth or a tooth that is not out if 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.860
 the article remains clearly included 

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:08.049
 continues to grow and determines this 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:10.150
 therefore we have already said cysts 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:13.030
 we simply meet cysts 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:15.099
 radicular follicular shiats is 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.049
 this the patient does not have to know how 

00:03:15.099 --> 00:03:20.170
 we discover the presence in this exists 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:22.810
 we can discover it from the point of view 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:24.519
 clinical or a patient in the morning 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.340
 wakes up with pain 

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:30.099
 or with a swelling or a lot 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:33.160
 often making a simple examination a vegetable garden 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:34.930
 overview to treat teeth and yes 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.540
 realizes the presence of these gestures 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:40.150
 what treatment is the treatment is 

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:42.700
 the emulation directors then 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:45.400
 director removal if we are present 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:48.640
 the root canal directors will be removed on 

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:51.190
 tooth that caused the cyst and then 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.709
 will go bring the cyst in this too 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:56.200
 case the surgical acts that used to be 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:58.150
 very weak TV today according to mine 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.160
 experience my nature 

00:03:58.150 --> 00:04:01.569
 we try to preserve red then 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:04.799
 we always do a surgery 

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:07.660
 conservative and possibly also 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:09.069
 total cyst if we lost the 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:12.930
 transverse bone size 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:16.190
 vertical graft of fabrics 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:18.780
 with synthetics that go to reform Russian 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:21.030
 hangs follicular cysts should be removed 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:25.340
 tooth with the cyst 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:25.340
 so we talked about the cis roof
