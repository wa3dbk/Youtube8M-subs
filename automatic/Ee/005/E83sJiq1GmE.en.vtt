00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:19.140
 Hi, I'm going to show you how 

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:21.420
 a good shrimp cocktail here we have 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:26.610
 more or less one kilo 100 grams of 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:28.920
 shrimp is good we remove the skin 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:31.860
 and we opened it butterfly style for 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.060
 take away the society that you have here and in 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:37.570
 medium 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:39.280
 are three or four chilies we close them 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:43.930
 remove the veins so that they do not sting 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:46.150
 both half a cup of cilantro half a cup 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.340
 of onion the onion must be left 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:51.190
 about 5 minutes 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:53.110
 Marinate with a lemon 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.780
 this same lemon is that it is high that 

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:59.950
 you're going to cut a half 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:01.990
 cup of finely chopped cucumber and a 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:05.410
 little more than half a cup of tomato 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:08.830
 well chopped katsu sauce to taste yo 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:11.590
 I'm calculating is a little bit more than 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:15.579
 more or less like a cup 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:17.950
 this vinegar that is witches can 

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:22.289
 get in the supermarket salsa 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:24.190
 chipotle orange soda clamato 

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:27.040
 Pepper 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:30.690
 this one to do 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.690
 what's this called in olive oil 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:38.460
 and chicken consommÃ© also an avocado 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:43.100
 this shrimp is medium size 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:45.979
 then we are not going to cut in 3 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:49.460
 since it 's big since we cut all 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:52.310
 the shrimp are going to accept viruses at 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:55.220
 water I forgot to add in the beginning 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.480
 let's put a spoonful of 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.280
 consume chicken 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:03.410
 let's give it a little 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.410
 little piece of salt 1 2 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:10.369
 and it 's one shrimp the shrimp 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:14.290
 they will be very very fast 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.290
 we're just going to take away the cycles 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.960
 the shrimp have already changed color 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:26.030
 and right now and let drain and 

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.550
 cool them so that to cut the 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.720
 cooking 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.720
 we drain them 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.920
 with your care because 

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.190
 this is very hot 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:52.239
 Y 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:59.590
 pour cold water to cut 

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:02.740
 cut the cooking that are followed 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:04.760
 knowing and become hard 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.980
 ugly that change the taste 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.510
 well we have the shrimps served 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:12.019
 let's start mixing all the 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.720
 ingredients we throw the onion chilli 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:16.710
 serrano 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.710
 the cucumber 

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.549
 the coriander 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.150
 the tomato 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:35.820
 let's take the sauce 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:40.040
 perhaps remember that this is the taste and 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:40.040
 I want them to be nice 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:49.990
 now let's also put 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:49.990
 a half cup of clamato 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:01.900
 half a cup of soda juice 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.470
 orange 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.470
 or not 

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:14.110
 let's throw a teaspoon with a 

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:14.110
 spoonful of olive oil 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:25.750
 let's put him 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:30.060
 buffalo sauce one 

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:30.060
 an approximate one that you will be 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:35.020
 about two teaspoons are going to make 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:43.610
 remember that the shrimp already 

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:46.610
 we put some salt and when the 

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:49.440
 we serve all the salvos in the taste not 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:52.340
 they have to try 

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.340
 pepper 

00:04:57.139 --> 00:05:03.260
 and what gives it a very rich flavor is 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:08.180
 our 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:12.350
 between these to the vinegar 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:12.350
 approximately two tablespoons 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:19.100
 to stir 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:23.770
 If you see that everything is very dry the mixture 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:26.220
 then you can add more sauce cause 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:30.220
 At the end we will integrate the avocado 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:32.910
 because if you can not beat us and be 

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:32.910
 very ugly this 

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:37.610
 good to get to the end we will integrate 

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:39.770
 the avocado 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:44.919
 and we're going to stir it gently so that 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:44.919
 do not debate with enveloping movements 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:51.940
 and I recommend that they go 

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:54.820
 Trying their taste and they will say if they want 

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:57.260
 put more salt 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:59.030
 Pepper 

00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:02.200
 I think he's going to miss a little bit of 

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:02.200
 salt because very little choice 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:09.000
 if you lack salt 

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:11.510
 then go little by little to not 

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.510
 go 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:19.130
 and we're going to pass good 

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:20.900
 friends we have our plate here 

00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:22.580
 finished 

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:25.340
 they can not accompany with some cookies 

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:26.230
 salty and a little star is nothing 

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:29.130
 wrong 

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:29.130
 and I hope you liked it
