cool interior you know the gold accents
which<00:01:59.960> in<00:02:00.140> my<00:02:00.320> opinion<00:02:00.470> didn't<00:02:01.159> look<00:02:01.250> too<00:02:01.460> good

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
which in my opinion didn't look too good

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.600 
which in my opinion didn't look too good
I<00:02:01.939> really<00:02:02.420> loved<00:02:02.990> the<00:02:03.170> casting<00:02:03.740> especially

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
I really loved the casting especially

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.190 
I really loved the casting especially
kisses<00:02:04.939> all<00:02:05.180> metal<00:02:07.660> it's<00:02:08.660> a<00:02:08.720> pretty<00:02:08.989> pretty

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
kisses all metal it's a pretty pretty

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.640 
kisses all metal it's a pretty pretty
heavy<00:02:09.759> vehicle<00:02:10.759> but<00:02:11.750> I<00:02:11.840> think<00:02:12.049> overall<00:02:12.410> looks

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:12.650 
heavy vehicle but I think overall looks

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:15.130 
heavy vehicle but I think overall looks
nicer<00:02:13.190> this<00:02:13.370> way<00:02:13.430> I'm<00:02:14.120> not<00:02:14.360> too<00:02:14.540> fond<00:02:14.840> of<00:02:14.959> these

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
nicer this way I'm not too fond of these

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.949 
nicer this way I'm not too fond of these
dish<00:02:15.560> wheels<00:02:15.920> but<00:02:16.819> I<00:02:16.849> think<00:02:17.150> in<00:02:17.300> this<00:02:17.480> red<00:02:17.780> look

00:02:17.949 --> 00:02:17.959 
dish wheels but I think in this red look

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:19.660 
dish wheels but I think in this red look
they<00:02:18.170> look<00:02:18.349> pretty<00:02:18.590> good

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
they look pretty good

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:25.570 
they look pretty good

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
from the you know garage series which

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.430 
from the you know garage series which
got<00:02:31.030> the<00:02:32.030> gold<00:02:32.300> wheels<00:02:32.540> in<00:02:32.750> a<00:02:32.840> gol<00:02:33.020> interior

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
got the gold wheels in a gol interior

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:38.020 
got the gold wheels in a gol interior
from<00:02:33.710> the<00:02:33.860> chiefly<00:02:34.610> serious<00:02:34.910> one<00:02:36.280> and<00:02:37.280> also<00:02:37.790> I

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.030 
from the chiefly serious one and also I

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.420 
from the chiefly serious one and also I
think<00:02:38.300> this<00:02:38.600> one<00:02:38.810> looks<00:02:39.020> better<00:02:39.380> than<00:02:40.100> the<00:02:40.280> way

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
think this one looks better than the way

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.080 
think this one looks better than the way
it<00:02:40.550> did<00:02:40.760> with<00:02:41.120> the<00:02:41.300> dish<00:02:41.930> wheels<00:02:42.910> think<00:02:43.910> the

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
it did with the dish wheels think the

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.300 
it did with the dish wheels think the
gold<00:02:44.390> wheels<00:02:44.660> match<00:02:45.110> better<00:02:45.470> with<00:02:45.620> a<00:02:45.770> cup<00:02:46.130> or

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:46.310 
gold wheels match better with a cup or

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:51.850 
gold wheels match better with a cup or
and<00:02:46.490> the<00:02:47.030> cream<00:02:47.330> color<00:02:47.630> of<00:02:48.470> this<00:02:48.709> truck<00:02:50.860> but

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
and the cream color of this truck but
