00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.489

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:50.280

 clear in snow then the eight clear 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.350
 Have you noticed yet put in the 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.799
 mixer we'll beat up 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.810
 son point is about a three 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:28.280
 3 to 5 minutes beating 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.280
 high speed on mixer 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.729
 he will be very firm 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:39.399
 It is difficult to get out of the mixer. 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:39.909
 that's the point after the egg whites in 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:43.899
 snow 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:47.289
 We're going to make a eggnog with the eight 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:51.119
 twins who are in your recipe and 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:51.119
 a cup and a half of sugar 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.290
 add walnuts to flour 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:01.910
 and the liquor 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:04.580
 beat for a minute then mix these 

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:07.480
 The ingredients are light in snow but 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.480
 what to be a little 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:23.000
 add the plums mix well and 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:25.910
 place in a greased 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.650
 on the way I'm going to leave an ice cream here 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.240
 we will soften the 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:31.940
 sweet milk to play on top of and then 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:34.570
 to put in the oven soften the dulce de leche 

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:38.740
 mixing with melted butter 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:38.740
 still put a gem 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:50.520
 over the dough and bake 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:54.050

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:02.520
 So we took the forum and left a 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:05.820
 bit out to wait to cool down 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:09.980
 people misinform is just passing a knife 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.980
 around to make it easier to steal 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.829

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.140

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:30.120
