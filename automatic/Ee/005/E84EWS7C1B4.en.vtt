00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.660

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:31.890
 Marcel was a friend and we knew him in 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:35.120
 with a friend in common and we sympathized 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.230

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.670
 so what is the concept you have 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.629

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.390

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.890

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.920
 moving from a chance gently 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:49.920
