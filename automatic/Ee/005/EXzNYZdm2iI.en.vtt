00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:18.859 
having my hand in my crotch is a little

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:25.980 
having my hand in my crotch is a little
uncomfortable<00:00:23.170> again<00:00:24.170> my<00:00:24.320> knees<00:00:24.500> could<00:00:24.920> be<00:00:25.130> a

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:25.990 
uncomfortable again my knees could be a

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.450 
uncomfortable again my knees could be a
little<00:00:26.990> bit<00:00:27.080> lower<00:00:27.289> so<00:00:27.470> foot<00:00:28.039> pegs<00:00:28.250> were

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:28.460 
little bit lower so foot pegs were

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:30.609 
little bit lower so foot pegs were
lowest<00:00:28.910> what<00:00:29.660> I<00:00:29.720> would<00:00:29.869> think<00:00:29.990> of<00:00:30.109> doing<00:00:30.170> is

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:30.619 
lowest what I would think of doing is

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:31.990 
lowest what I would think of doing is
doing<00:00:30.920> the<00:00:31.100> measurements<00:00:31.550> and<00:00:31.640> seeing<00:00:31.850> if

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:32.000 
doing the measurements and seeing if

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.330 
doing the measurements and seeing if
there<00:00:32.149> was<00:00:32.239> time<00:00:32.449> for<00:00:32.689> lowering<00:00:33.440> foot<00:00:33.649> pegs<00:00:33.859> or

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:34.340 
there was time for lowering foot pegs or

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:35.920 
there was time for lowering foot pegs or
just<00:00:34.550> some<00:00:34.699> generic<00:00:35.149> foot<00:00:35.390> peg<00:00:35.539> lowering

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
just some generic foot peg lowering

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:38.059 
brackets would put bolt on so I can

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:39.720 
brackets would put bolt on so I can
worry<00:00:38.270> your<00:00:38.390> foot<00:00:38.540> pegs<00:00:38.720> about<00:00:38.930> two<00:00:39.110> inches

00:01:05.889 --> 00:01:05.899 
strap I'm afraid that this little strap

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:07.929 
strap I'm afraid that this little strap
isn't<00:01:06.409> actually<00:01:06.829> going<00:01:06.979> to<00:01:07.100> do<00:01:07.250> anything<00:01:07.549> in

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:07.939 
isn't actually going to do anything in

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:11.050 
isn't actually going to do anything in
the<00:01:08.029> event<00:01:08.329> that<00:01:08.509> there's<00:01:08.719> a<00:01:08.779> serious<00:01:09.729> saw<00:01:10.729> for

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
the event that there's a serious saw for

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.569 
the event that there's a serious saw for
something<00:01:11.869> yeah<00:01:12.649> that<00:01:12.859> little<00:01:12.920> strap<00:01:13.310> is

00:01:13.569 --> 00:01:13.579 
something yeah that little strap is

00:01:13.579 --> 00:01:15.160 
something yeah that little strap is
there<00:01:13.819> because<00:01:14.060> the<00:01:14.299> law<00:01:14.450> requires<00:01:14.600> this<00:01:15.109> to

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
there because the law requires this to

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.080 
there because the law requires this to
be<00:01:15.350> and<00:01:15.649> it's<00:01:15.770> SP<00:01:16.069> is<00:01:16.189> strong<00:01:16.490> enough<00:01:16.670> for<00:01:16.819> q3

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
be and it's SP is strong enough for q3

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.120 
be and it's SP is strong enough for q3
under<00:01:17.420> pounds<00:01:17.719> of<00:01:17.810> weight<00:01:17.959> but<00:01:18.200> that<00:01:18.439> doesn't

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
under pounds of weight but that doesn't

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.029 
under pounds of weight but that doesn't
mean<00:01:19.219> that<00:01:19.279> it's<00:01:19.579> functional<00:01:20.469> the<00:01:21.469> location

00:01:22.029 --> 00:01:22.039 
mean that it's functional the location

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:23.769 
mean that it's functional the location
of<00:01:22.159> just<00:01:22.310> so<00:01:22.459> far<00:01:22.729> that<00:01:23.029> I<00:01:23.060> don't<00:01:23.509> think<00:01:23.689> it

00:01:23.769 --> 00:01:23.779 
of just so far that I don't think it

00:01:23.779 --> 00:01:26.529 
of just so far that I don't think it
