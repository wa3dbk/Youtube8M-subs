00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:09.370
 Hello my dear friends of 

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:12.039
 youtube what are you waiting for 

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:13.960
 you are all very well in the video of 

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:16.509
 Today I want to show you how I made these 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:18.789
 precious wire pendants we are going to 

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:21.760
 need very few materials and how 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:23.859
 you see the result is incredible I leave you 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:27.039
 with aluminum wire materials 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:29.949
 15 millimeter also known as 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:32.980
 magic thread a marble of 2 centimeters 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:35.830
 in diameter a rule some kind of 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:39.250
 cord or chain cutting pliers and 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:41.290
 round- nose pliers we begin 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:43.240
 We are going to cut pieces of wire from 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:46.150
 about 15 centimeters 

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:48.420
 we are going to need about 8 or 9 pieces in 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.420
 total 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.219
 we are also going to cut two more pieces 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.629
 small as of 15 centimeters 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:58.219
 we group all the wires and one 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:00.500
 Approximate distance of about five 

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:03.140
 centimeters we hold one of the pieces 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:07.479
 smaller with the thumb and we give some 

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.479
 little balls squeezing very very strong 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.869
 with the round-nose pliers we will make 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.869
 a spiral at each end 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.510
 we separated the wires a little to 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:25.610
 work more easily 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.980
 and with the pliers and helping us 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:32.200
 our hands so as not to damage the wire 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:32.200
 let's go forming small spirals 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.299
 we will choose one of the pieces to create 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:43.080
 a loop through which to pass then the 

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:45.090
 cord or chain 

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.700
 already helped me with the pliers and 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:49.470
 I continued with my hands will not forget 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.800
 cut what you have left and try to 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.880
 the jobs are very clean 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.400
 we will continue spiraling until 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:00.590
 finish with all the wires the form 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:02:00.590
 to place them as you like 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:04.860
 now we are going to open the wires by the 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.190
 another side to place the center 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.650
 marble 

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:12.080
 He holds it very well and we pass all the 

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:14.030
 wires up here you have to 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.130
 do a little bit of strength so that 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.720
 marble is as close as possible to the 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:21.790
 downstairs 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:21.790
 It has to be like that 

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.200
 we took the other piece that we had 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:31.550
 reserved and we do the same as before 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.550
 we press as hard as you can 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.360
 we will also make a final in each 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.360
 extreme 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:45.290
 let's open this up a bit to work 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.760
 better and we can cut some wires 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.220
 so that the spirals do not remain 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.260
 all of the same size we will put some 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.920
 larger smaller 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:57.170
 some higher another lower this as 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.710
 each one more we like everyone will know 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:59.710
 give him his touch 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.120
 we put everything a bit 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:28.970
 and look once the jewel so finished 

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.970
 beautiful we have created 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:36.000
 do not you think it's beautiful who would say that 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.000
 It is made with a simple marble 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.720
 we only need to pass the cord that 

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:43.709
 we have chosen to be able to wear this 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.709
 fabulous pendant 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:49.590
 Here I show you another in pink and 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.360
 you know that aluminum wire can you 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:53.780
 find it in a variety of 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.780
 colors 

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:01.900
