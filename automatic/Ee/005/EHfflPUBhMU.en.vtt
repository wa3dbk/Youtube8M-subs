nice feel um I've also taken the misery

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.390 
nice feel um I've also taken the misery
measurements<00:01:23.430> so<00:01:23.970> you<00:01:24.750> had<00:01:25.020> two<00:01:25.619> millimeters

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
measurements so you had two millimeters

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.719 
measurements so you had two millimeters
on<00:01:26.700> all<00:01:27.330> the<00:01:27.869> side<00:01:28.080> which<00:01:28.680> means<00:01:28.710> formula<00:01:29.579> me

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
on all the side which means formula me

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.440 
on all the side which means formula me
two<00:01:29.939> millimeters<00:01:30.930> in<00:01:31.140> total<00:01:31.470> ah<00:01:31.850> it's<00:01:32.850> so<00:01:33.420> a

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
two millimeters in total ah it's so a

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.319 
two millimeters in total ah it's so a
larger<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.200> wider<00:01:34.650> four<00:01:35.430> millimeters<00:01:36.090> and

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
larger and wider four millimeters and

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.950 
larger and wider four millimeters and
it's<00:01:36.560> adding<00:01:37.560> one<00:01:38.430> millimeters<00:01:39.180> on<00:01:39.509> the

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
it's adding one millimeters on the

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.990 
it's adding one millimeters on the
thickness<00:01:40.200> on<00:01:40.530> each<00:01:40.710> side<00:01:40.979> so<00:01:41.189> I<00:01:41.220> two

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
thickness on each side so I two

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.429 
thickness on each side so I two
millimeters<00:01:42.570> overall<00:01:44.240> it's<00:01:45.240> surely<00:01:45.869> lessen

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
millimeters overall it's surely lessen

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.560 
millimeters overall it's surely lessen
the<00:01:46.649> nice<00:01:46.829> and<00:01:47.100> sharp<00:01:47.340> design<00:01:47.520> of<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:47.939> LG

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
the nice and sharp design of the LG

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.080 
the nice and sharp design of the LG
optimus<00:01:48.600> G<00:01:49.170> it<00:01:49.799> makes<00:01:50.070> it<00:01:50.250> thicker<00:01:50.700> and<00:01:51.000> wider

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
optimus G it makes it thicker and wider

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.330 
optimus G it makes it thicker and wider
but<00:01:52.020> if<00:01:52.290> you<00:01:52.409> want<00:01:52.590> to<00:01:52.619> protect<00:01:52.920> your<00:01:53.070> device

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
but if you want to protect your device

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.480 
but if you want to protect your device
from<00:01:53.790> mishandling<00:01:54.329> it's<00:01:54.799> sort<00:01:55.799> of<00:01:55.950> a<00:01:56.070> lesser

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
from mishandling it's sort of a lesser

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.940 
from mishandling it's sort of a lesser
evil<00:01:56.969> um<00:01:57.740> on<00:01:58.790> another<00:01:59.790> flaw<00:02:00.149> I<00:02:00.180> see<00:02:00.360> is<00:02:00.810> a

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
evil um on another flaw I see is a

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.350 
evil um on another flaw I see is a
wealthy<00:02:01.950> opening<00:02:02.430> both<00:02:03.000> for<00:02:03.299> the<00:02:03.479> USB<00:02:04.049> in<00:02:04.290> the

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
wealthy opening both for the USB in the
