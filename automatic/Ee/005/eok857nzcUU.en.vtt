me<00:00:28.650> so<00:00:29.099> we're<00:00:29.849> in<00:00:29.939> an<00:00:30.000> empty<00:00:30.119> map<00:00:30.390> were<00:00:30.539> just

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
me so we're in an empty map were just

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:31.730 
me so we're in an empty map were just
running<00:00:30.750> around<00:00:30.900> let's<00:00:31.140> get<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.439> let's<00:00:31.619> get

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:31.740 
running around let's get the let's get

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.920 
running around let's get the let's get
the<00:00:31.859> lay<00:00:32.009> of<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.189> land<00:00:32.279> here<00:00:32.640> what<00:00:33.030> first<00:00:33.870> of

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
the lay of the land here what first of

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.389 
the lay of the land here what first of
all<00:00:34.050> tell<00:00:34.260> me<00:00:34.380> a<00:00:34.410> little<00:00:34.530> bit<00:00:34.680> about<00:00:34.829> the<00:00:35.010> the

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
all tell me a little bit about the the

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.729 
all tell me a little bit about the the
background<00:00:35.940> on<00:00:36.059> this<00:00:36.210> map<00:00:36.480> as<00:00:36.750> far<00:00:36.989> as<00:00:37.140> the

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
background on this map as far as the

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.299 
background on this map as far as the
theme<00:00:38.370> where<00:00:38.700> we<00:00:38.879> are<00:00:39.090> what<00:00:39.390> we're<00:00:39.570> doing<00:00:39.960> and

00:00:40.299 --> 00:00:40.309 
theme where we are what we're doing and

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:42.200 
theme where we are what we're doing and
then<00:00:41.309> we'll<00:00:41.430> hit<00:00:41.550> some<00:00:41.730> of<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.850> high<00:00:42.000> points

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
then we'll hit some of the high points

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.880 
then we'll hit some of the high points
so<00:00:43.020> so<00:00:43.770> Venus<00:00:44.040> is<00:00:44.430> basically<00:00:44.910> an<00:00:45.239> atlas<00:00:45.890> sort

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
so so Venus is basically an atlas sort

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.639 
so so Venus is basically an atlas sort
of<00:00:47.010> resort<00:00:47.460> out-and-out<00:00:48.270> China<00:00:48.870> so<00:00:49.320> Kevin

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
of resort out-and-out China so Kevin

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.250 
of resort out-and-out China so Kevin
Spacey<00:00:49.920> owns<00:00:50.219> the<00:00:50.399> surface<00:00:50.730> yes<00:00:51.149> certainly<00:00:51.780> he

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
Spacey owns the surface yes certainly he

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.139 
Spacey owns the surface yes certainly he
hangs<00:00:52.469> out<00:00:52.649> somewhere<00:00:53.370> in<00:00:53.579> there<00:00:53.850> probably

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
hangs out somewhere in there probably

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:58.189 
hangs out somewhere in there probably
where<00:00:54.780> you<00:00:54.870> just<00:00:54.989> can't<00:00:55.170> get<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.469> and<00:00:56.370> so<00:00:57.199> it's

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
where you just can't get to and so it's

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.069 
where you just can't get to and so it's
a<00:00:58.289> pretty<00:00:58.469> awesome<00:00:58.770> space<00:00:59.250> out<00:00:59.609> and<00:00:59.930> out<00:01:00.930> in

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
a pretty awesome space out and out in

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.510 
a pretty awesome space out and out in
China<00:01:01.320> you<00:01:01.410> can<00:01:01.500> get<00:01:01.739> a<00:01:01.770> kind<00:01:02.100> of<00:01:02.160> the<00:01:02.250> lay<00:01:02.399> of

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
China you can get a kind of the lay of

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.310 
China you can get a kind of the lay of
the<00:01:02.550> land<00:01:02.760> here<00:01:02.940> it's<00:01:03.629> a<00:01:03.719> traditional<00:01:04.140> three

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
the land here it's a traditional three

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.100 
the land here it's a traditional three
lane<00:01:04.530> map<00:01:04.799> yeah<00:01:05.220> with<00:01:06.150> some<00:01:06.450> with<00:01:07.080> some

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
lane map yeah with some with some

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.780 
lane map yeah with some with some
awesome<00:01:07.650> stuff<00:01:07.740> happening<00:01:07.860> in<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.340> center<00:01:08.640> to

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
awesome stuff happening in the center to

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.460 
awesome stuff happening in the center to
kind<00:01:08.970> of<00:01:09.000> divide<00:01:09.240> those<00:01:09.479> lanes<00:01:09.750> with<00:01:10.049> with

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
kind of divide those lanes with with

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.910 
kind of divide those lanes with with
boost<00:01:10.770> a<00:01:10.950> little<00:01:11.189> more<00:01:11.720> it's<00:01:12.720> great<00:01:13.200> for<00:01:13.650> just

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920 
boost a little more it's great for just

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.700 
boost a little more it's great for just
boosting<00:01:14.549> around<00:01:14.820> lots<00:01:15.810> of<00:01:16.020> elements<00:01:16.290> within

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
boosting around lots of elements within

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.499 
boosting around lots of elements within

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
have these nice kind of clean lanes on

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.370 
have these nice kind of clean lanes on
the<00:01:34.110> side<00:01:34.290> great<00:01:34.590> for<00:01:34.939> assault<00:01:35.939> rifles<00:01:36.380> and

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
the side great for assault rifles and

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.780 
the side great for assault rifles and
then<00:01:37.500> we<00:01:37.590> also<00:01:37.740> kind<00:01:38.040> of<00:01:38.100> mix<00:01:38.250> it<00:01:38.369> up<00:01:38.460> with<00:01:38.520> the

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
then we also kind of mix it up with the

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.670 
then we also kind of mix it up with the

for<00:01:52.380> so<00:01:53.009> CTF<00:01:53.610> is<00:01:53.939> making<00:01:54.899> a<00:01:54.960> welcome<00:01:55.320> return<00:01:55.470> to

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
for so CTF is making a welcome return to

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.620 
for so CTF is making a welcome return to
advanced<00:01:56.189> warfare<00:01:56.640> it<00:01:56.820> seems<00:01:57.000> like<00:01:57.180> with

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
advanced warfare it seems like with

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.510 
advanced warfare it seems like with
these<00:01:57.750> lanes<00:01:58.049> CTF<00:01:58.710> pretty<00:01:59.009> good<00:01:59.159> pretty<00:01:59.399> good

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
these lanes CTF pretty good pretty good

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.490 
these lanes CTF pretty good pretty good
fit<00:01:59.790> for<00:01:59.820> this<00:02:00.000> level<00:02:00.329> oh<00:02:00.450> yeah<00:02:00.780> certainly<00:02:01.049> and

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
fit for this level oh yeah certainly and

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.380 
fit for this level oh yeah certainly and
same<00:02:01.979> with<00:02:02.009> Dom<00:02:02.310> as<00:02:03.299> well<00:02:03.990> CTF<00:02:04.860> is<00:02:05.180> great<00:02:06.180> as

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
same with Dom as well CTF is great as

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.050 
same with Dom as well CTF is great as
you're<00:02:06.509> running<00:02:07.350> across<00:02:07.740> this<00:02:08.039> map<00:02:08.250> there's<00:02:09.000> a

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
you're running across this map there's a

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.430 
you're running across this map there's a
couple<00:02:09.209> cut<00:02:09.479> throughs<00:02:09.720> right<00:02:09.929> through<00:02:10.110> here

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
couple cut throughs right through here

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.050 
couple cut throughs right through here
where<00:02:10.920> you<00:02:11.009> can<00:02:11.099> do<00:02:11.250> to<00:02:11.400> kind<00:02:11.489> of<00:02:11.580> cut<00:02:11.790> off<00:02:11.879> any

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
where you can do to kind of cut off any

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.520 
where you can do to kind of cut off any
flag<00:02:12.330> runners<00:02:12.720> that<00:02:12.900> are<00:02:13.020> better

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
flag runners that are better

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.650 
flag runners that are better
you<00:02:13.680> just<00:02:14.130> kind<00:02:14.220> of<00:02:14.370> control<00:02:15.150> these<00:02:15.330> spaces

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
you just kind of control these spaces

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.210 
you just kind of control these spaces
and<00:02:16.020> then<00:02:16.140> basically<00:02:16.440> move<00:02:16.890> to<00:02:17.069> the<00:02:17.190> other

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
and then basically move to the other

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.190 
and then basically move to the other
side<00:02:17.400> real<00:02:17.790> quick<00:02:17.850> and<00:02:18.150> and<00:02:18.360> you're<00:02:18.600> able<00:02:18.930> to

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
side real quick and and you're able to

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.320 
side real quick and and you're able to
cut<00:02:19.350> off<00:02:19.470> pretty<00:02:19.860> much<00:02:20.010> the<00:02:20.160> entire<00:02:20.280> map<00:02:20.700> by

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
cut off pretty much the entire map by

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.699 
cut off pretty much the entire map by
just<00:02:21.480> kind<00:02:21.600> of<00:02:21.630> holding<00:02:21.959> these<00:02:22.110> areas<00:02:22.530> down

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
just kind of holding these areas down

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:23.840 
just kind of holding these areas down
and<00:02:22.920> just<00:02:23.010> really<00:02:23.250> making<00:02:23.550> sure<00:02:23.700> you're

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
and just really making sure you're

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.480 
and just really making sure you're
managing<00:02:24.300> your<00:02:24.420> lanes<00:02:25.069> but<00:02:26.069> there's<00:02:26.220> always

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
managing your lanes but there's always

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.190 
managing your lanes but there's always
there's<00:02:26.760> always<00:02:26.880> ways<00:02:27.150> to<00:02:27.209> sneak<00:02:27.420> around<00:02:27.690> so

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
there's always ways to sneak around so

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.350 
there's always ways to sneak around so
you<00:02:28.500> can<00:02:28.800> always<00:02:29.100> come<00:02:29.310> up<00:02:29.520> through<00:02:29.880> here<00:02:30.030> take

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
you can always come up through here take

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.120 
you can always come up through here take
the<00:02:30.480> bottom<00:02:30.750> route<00:02:30.930> a<00:02:30.959> little<00:02:31.350> longer<00:02:31.560> but

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
the bottom route a little longer but

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.530 
the bottom route a little longer but
it's<00:02:32.280> a<00:02:32.340> little<00:02:32.580> little<00:02:32.880> safer<00:02:33.209> to<00:02:33.300> run<00:02:33.450> the

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
it's a little little safer to run the

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.900 
it's a little little safer to run the
flag<00:02:34.340> so<00:02:35.390> it's<00:02:36.390> a<00:02:37.400> really<00:02:38.400> fun<00:02:38.670> especially

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
flag so it's a really fun especially

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.030 
flag so it's a really fun especially
it's<00:02:39.239> very<00:02:39.450> fast<00:02:39.750> with<00:02:40.080> with<00:02:40.650> all<00:02:40.770> the<00:02:40.860> boost

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
it's very fast with with all the boost

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.470 
it's very fast with with all the boost
movements<00:02:41.550> and<00:02:41.640> the<00:02:41.670> slides<00:02:41.970> that<00:02:42.180> you<00:02:42.270> can<00:02:42.390> do

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:42.480 
movements and the slides that you can do

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.059 
movements and the slides that you can do
to<00:02:42.510> get<00:02:42.720> across<00:02:42.900> the<00:02:43.080> lane<00:02:43.260> for<00:02:43.530> the<00:02:43.560> that<00:02:43.950> was

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:44.069 
to get across the lane for the that was

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:45.440 
to get across the lane for the that was
actually<00:02:44.220> my<00:02:44.430> next<00:02:44.610> question<00:02:44.910> is<00:02:45.000> what's<00:02:45.239> uh

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
actually my next question is what's uh

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.870 
actually my next question is what's uh
what's<00:02:45.750> or<00:02:46.200> ones<00:02:46.470> or<00:02:46.800> a<00:02:46.830> specific<00:02:47.040> spots<00:02:47.670> are

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
what's or ones or a specific spots are

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:50.030 
what's or ones or a specific spots are
specific<00:02:48.300> mobility<00:02:49.019> tip<00:02:49.260> in<00:02:49.440> this<00:02:49.560> map<00:02:49.800> to

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040 
specific mobility tip in this map to

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:52.250 
specific mobility tip in this map to
really<00:02:50.340> the<00:02:50.430> tourist<00:02:50.730> spot<00:02:51.000> or<00:02:51.269> a<00:02:51.630> tactic<00:02:52.140> to

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
really the tourist spot or a tactic to

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.250 
really the tourist spot or a tactic to
really<00:02:52.290> to<00:02:52.650> make<00:02:52.860> use<00:02:53.100> of<00:02:53.130> the<00:02:53.850> exit<00:02:54.239> yeah<00:02:55.019> the

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
really to make use of the exit yeah the

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.290 
really to make use of the exit yeah the
spots<00:02:56.160> you<00:02:56.250> want<00:02:56.400> to<00:02:56.459> be<00:02:56.580> are<00:02:56.760> up<00:02:57.060> on<00:02:57.180> these

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
spots you want to be are up on these

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.190 
spots you want to be are up on these
edges<00:02:57.810> up<00:02:58.050> on<00:02:58.140> the<00:02:58.260> corners<00:02:59.250> of<00:02:59.280> the<00:02:59.459> map

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
edges up on the corners of the map

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.059 
edges up on the corners of the map
around<00:03:01.200> this<00:03:01.319> area<00:03:01.470> here<00:03:01.709> this<00:03:01.830> is<00:03:01.890> going<00:03:02.010> to

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
around this area here this is going to

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:03.020 
around this area here this is going to
be<00:03:02.130> the<00:03:02.220> center<00:03:02.459> of<00:03:02.489> the<00:03:02.610> math<00:03:02.760> that<00:03:02.910> you're

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
be the center of the math that you're

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.150 
be the center of the math that you're
looking<00:03:03.150> down<00:03:03.390> into<00:03:03.709> this<00:03:04.709> is<00:03:04.860> one<00:03:05.010> of<00:03:05.069> the

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
looking down into this is one of the

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.680 
looking down into this is one of the
spots<00:03:05.340> that<00:03:05.489> you<00:03:05.550> can<00:03:05.730> go<00:03:05.850> to<00:03:05.880> to<00:03:06.180> really<00:03:06.360> can

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
spots that you can go to to really can

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.570 
spots that you can go to to really can
rack<00:03:06.930> up<00:03:06.959> some<00:03:07.140> kills<00:03:07.530> if<00:03:08.100> you<00:03:08.250> want<00:03:08.459> to

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
rack up some kills if you want to

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.970 
rack up some kills if you want to
there's<00:03:09.540> there's<00:03:09.870> just<00:03:10.200> it's<00:03:10.470> your<00:03:10.709> go-to

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:10.980 
there's there's just it's your go-to

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:12.680 
there's there's just it's your go-to
destination<00:03:11.340> to<00:03:11.970> find<00:03:12.180> that<00:03:12.330> but<00:03:12.480> you<00:03:12.569> just

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:12.690 
destination to find that but you just

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.350 
destination to find that but you just
got<00:03:12.840> to<00:03:12.870> be<00:03:12.989> careful<00:03:13.110> of<00:03:13.380> all<00:03:13.470> your<00:03:13.620> counters

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360 
got to be careful of all your counters

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.759 
got to be careful of all your counters
people<00:03:15.360> just<00:03:15.720> getting<00:03:15.900> the<00:03:15.989> getting<00:03:16.380> the<00:03:16.560> jump

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
people just getting the getting the jump

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:18.350 
people just getting the getting the jump
on<00:03:16.830> you<00:03:16.920> from<00:03:17.100> behind<00:03:17.250> and<00:03:17.700> everywhere<00:03:18.329> else

on you from behind and everywhere else

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:19.880 
on you from behind and everywhere else
but<00:03:18.570> if<00:03:18.780> you're<00:03:18.959> if<00:03:19.170> you<00:03:19.260> want<00:03:19.410> that<00:03:19.440> opening

but if you're if you want that opening

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.410 
but if you're if you want that opening
move<00:03:20.100> this<00:03:20.340> is<00:03:20.489> certainly<00:03:20.760> the<00:03:20.940> opening<00:03:21.269> move

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
move this is certainly the opening move

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.410 
move this is certainly the opening move
area<00:03:21.780> to<00:03:21.959> kind<00:03:22.200> of<00:03:22.290> run<00:03:22.980> in<00:03:23.130> here<00:03:23.280> check<00:03:23.579> check
