to live out my dream as a young kid it's
it's<00:00:31.849> pretty<00:00:32.270> hard<00:00:32.509> to<00:00:32.629> imagine<00:00:32.689> at<00:00:32.989> times

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
it's pretty hard to imagine at times

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.819 
it's pretty hard to imagine at times
it<00:00:35.220> definitely<00:00:35.610> means<00:00:36.059> a<00:00:36.390> lot<00:00:36.600> more<00:00:36.829> winning

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
it definitely means a lot more winning

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.400

against<00:00:38.130> Australia<00:00:38.610> than<00:00:38.760> anybody<00:00:39.090> else

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:39.410 
against Australia than anybody else

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.740 
against Australia than anybody else
there's<00:00:40.410> no<00:00:40.559> doubt<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.890> rivalry<00:00:41.400> between

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
there's no doubt the rivalry between

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.910 
there's no doubt the rivalry between
Australian<00:00:42.750> one<00:00:42.899> that's<00:00:43.050> as<00:00:43.200> it's<00:00:43.559> as<00:00:43.680> good<00:00:43.800> as

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
Australian one that's as it's as good as

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.939 
Australian one that's as it's as good as
it<00:00:44.040> gets<00:00:44.070> I<00:00:45.110> think<00:00:46.110> a<00:00:46.170> lot<00:00:46.320> of<00:00:46.350> is<00:00:46.530> to<00:00:46.739> do<00:00:46.829> with

00:00:46.939 --> 00:00:46.949 
it gets I think a lot of is to do with

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:49.400 
it gets I think a lot of is to do with
the<00:00:47.010> history<00:00:47.400> between<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.879> two<00:00:47.910> nations<00:00:48.410> well

from<00:01:08.870> sitting<00:01:09.800> in<00:01:09.890> a<00:01:09.979> position<00:01:10.220> like<00:01:10.400> this<00:01:10.790> to

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
from sitting in a position like this to

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.260 
from sitting in a position like this to
being<00:01:11.660> out<00:01:11.780> in<00:01:11.930> center<00:01:12.830> stage<00:01:13.070> so<00:01:13.940> your<00:01:14.060> heart

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
being out in center stage so your heart

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.530 
being out in center stage so your heart
rate<00:01:14.479> goes<00:01:14.690> from<00:01:14.720> maybe<00:01:15.380> 65<00:01:16.010> to<00:01:16.400> 140<00:01:17.270> in<00:01:17.420> the

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
rate goes from maybe 65 to 140 in the

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.900 
rate goes from maybe 65 to 140 in the
space<00:01:17.750> of<00:01:17.930> 20<00:01:18.440> seconds<00:01:18.890> but<00:01:19.220> that<00:01:19.369> also<00:01:19.520> gets

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:19.910 
space of 20 seconds but that also gets

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:21.280 
space of 20 seconds but that also gets
me<00:01:20.030> going<00:01:20.060> out<00:01:20.420> when<00:01:20.660> I<00:01:20.690> got<00:01:20.900> into<00:01:21.110> the<00:01:21.170> middle

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
me going out when I got into the middle

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:22.480 
me going out when I got into the middle
that's<00:01:21.560> a<00:01:21.650> thing<00:01:21.830> that<00:01:21.950> really<00:01:22.100> gets<00:01:22.340> me

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:22.490
