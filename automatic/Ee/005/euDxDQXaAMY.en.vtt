this week I'm going to teach two steps
I'm<00:00:27.000> going<00:00:27.060> to<00:00:27.240> teach<00:00:27.390> two<00:00:27.689> steps<00:00:28.050> that<00:00:28.260> I've

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
I'm going to teach two steps that I've

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.950 
I'm going to teach two steps that I've
had<00:00:28.590> a<00:00:28.619> few<00:00:28.859> requests<00:00:29.279> for<00:00:29.660> because<00:00:30.660> they<00:00:30.750> look

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
had a few requests for because they look

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.990 
had a few requests for because they look
very<00:00:30.990> similar<00:00:31.470> and<00:00:32.130> right<00:00:32.610> now<00:00:32.759> we'll<00:00:32.910> make

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
very similar and right now we'll make

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.580 
very similar and right now we'll make
the<00:00:33.059> difference<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.840> first<00:00:33.989> step<00:00:34.230> is<00:00:34.350> called

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
the difference the first step is called

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.440 
the difference the first step is called
the<00:00:34.680> Willy<00:00:34.829> bounce<00:00:34.920> and<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:35.730> second<00:00:36.149> step<00:00:36.270> is

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
the Willy bounce and the second step is

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.280 
the Willy bounce and the second step is
called<00:00:36.630> low<00:00:36.870> Wakita

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
called low Wakita

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.840 
called low Wakita
so<00:00:37.710> today<00:00:38.010> we'll<00:00:38.190> learn<00:00:38.309> how<00:00:38.370> to<00:00:38.520> really

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
so today we'll learn how to really

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.060 
so today we'll learn how to really
balance<00:00:39.000> and<00:00:39.239> watch<00:00:39.390> it<00:00:39.540> okay<00:00:40.230> so<00:00:40.290> now<00:00:40.649> the

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
balance and watch it okay so now the

so<00:01:32.450> now<00:01:32.660> the<00:01:32.750> next<00:01:32.930> step<00:01:33.200> we're<00:01:33.350> going<00:01:33.440> to

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
so now the next step we're going to

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.290 
so now the next step we're going to
learn<00:01:33.620> is<00:01:33.800> called<00:01:33.830> a<00:01:34.070> wacky<00:01:34.250> do<00:01:34.490> now<00:01:35.000> the<00:01:35.060> wacky

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:35.300 
learn is called a wacky do now the wacky

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.700 
learn is called a wacky do now the wacky
that<00:01:35.570> looks<00:01:35.780> like<00:01:35.930> the<00:01:36.050> Willy<00:01:36.230> bounce<00:01:36.320> and<00:01:36.650> it

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
that looks like the Willy bounce and it

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.240 
that looks like the Willy bounce and it
starts<00:01:36.980> off<00:01:37.130> one<00:01:38.030> two<00:01:38.660> and<00:01:38.870> then<00:01:39.020> you<00:01:39.200> dip<00:01:39.890> down

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
starts off one two and then you dip down

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.540 
starts off one two and then you dip down
one<00:01:41.030> two<00:01:41.660> and<00:01:41.840> then<00:01:41.960> you<00:01:42.140> dip<00:01:42.740> down<00:01:43.010> so<00:01:43.280> you<00:01:43.340> can

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:43.550 
one two and then you dip down so you can

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:44.050 
one two and then you dip down so you can
do<00:01:43.730> it

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
do it

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.060
