00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.877
 German PT-ACS «Jagdtiger 8.8» - 

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:07.683
 It is the embodiment of the present power. 

00:00:07.988 --> 00:00:09.160
 It is large and ... 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:10.700
 deadly. 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.630
 Strong and ... 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:13.683
 slow! 

00:00:13.922 --> 00:00:14.683
 Although ... 

00:00:14.811 --> 00:00:17.188
 It's all relative ... 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.988
 "German" Dimensions cause a sense of confidence. 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.744
 This is not some kind of bony «Borsig» - 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:29.980
 this greatness! 

00:00:30.833 --> 00:00:31.255
 Of course, 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.070
 such massiveness leaves no chance to be invisible on the field of battle ... 

00:00:35.611 --> 00:00:37.344
 But this is not necessary! 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.144
 Identify «Jagdpanzer» - is one thing, 

00:00:40.344 --> 00:00:42.500
 and quite another - to break it! 

00:00:43.144 --> 00:00:44.190
 frontal armor 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.277
 may drive them into the complex nearly every tank, 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.966
 that "German" can be found in battle. 

00:00:50.811 --> 00:00:55.011
 So loud statement also promotes lightweight level battles: 

00:00:55.344 --> 00:00:56.683
 higher than to the "nines" 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:57.677
 you do not throw. 

00:00:58.730 --> 00:00:59.522
 naturally 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.211
 the presence of an excellent armor in the forehead 

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.944
 balanced by vulnerability in the tanks and stern. 

00:01:04.188 --> 00:01:05.683
 But is this news? 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.683
 Do not expose the weaknesses of their skin - 

00:01:09.683 --> 00:01:11.966
 this is one of the first rules of the game. 

00:01:12.255 --> 00:01:14.683
 The most important is perhaps that the ability to shoot. 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.683
 Speaking of "shoot." 

00:01:17.788 --> 00:01:20.033
 Cannon ACS «Jagdpanzer» - this is not a gun, 

00:01:20.188 --> 00:01:23.430
 and one pure pleasure: 

00:01:24.322 --> 00:01:26.344
 excellent rate of fire, 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.530
 bronepraboynasts, 

00:01:27.877 --> 00:01:29.033
 while aiming. 

00:01:29.683 --> 00:01:30.966
 Spread over 100 meters 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.477
 generally allows to get into the whites of the eyes 

00:01:33.611 --> 00:01:35.588
 or unprotected hatch tower - 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.340
 that's as you like. 

00:01:37.811 --> 00:01:38.830
 And the average damage per minute ... 

00:01:39.033 --> 00:01:39.944
 Uh ... 

00:01:40.322 --> 00:01:44.900
 Damage per minute - nearly 2,700. 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.683
 This is one of the three best results among all classmates! 

00:01:51.366 --> 00:01:52.210
 Thus, 

00:01:52.322 --> 00:01:53.588
 This powerful machine 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:54.680
 with cast-iron muzzle 

00:01:54.683 --> 00:01:57.280
 and beautiful from all angles gun. 

00:01:58.683 --> 00:01:59.683
 And you already know, 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.683
 why in fact it is so seductive ... 

00:02:10.388 --> 00:02:12.380
 Der Jagdtiger 8.8. 

00:02:12.566 --> 00:02:14.166
 "Made in Germany".
