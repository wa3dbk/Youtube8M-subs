00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:12.530
 hello thank you for being with us for 

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:16.000
 follow this game I'm in the company of 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.000
 popular franck sauzÃ©e of course 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.250
 the doses of this stage of his ford moment 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.110
 very tense 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.520
 treasurer nothing like a body band now 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:29.990
 except that inside I can tell you 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.650
 that ultras supporters do not we 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.650
 do not send sweets 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.190
 if keep it close this party 

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:06.989
 - it circulates well to try to him 

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.989
 take the ball 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.850
 to the truth zone 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.880
 what you calm the defense 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:30.040
 I quickly put the greenfinch it was 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:30.040
 spoke troika for the attacker 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.980
 from you 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.980
 but you allow the dough a single word 

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:51.700
 these readings 1-0 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.610
 it's understood 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.620
 taken in his hallway 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.860
 to be the moment that the three people 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.860
 finally 

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.390
 meal tonight this action it is a pity 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.060
 to fish like that in the last gesture 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:45.760
 out of the game the challenge is to leave too early 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.760
 the balloon was given is too late 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.630
 because completely at the street in this 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:12.630
 moment 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.690
 of course the trajectory 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:34.490
 follow 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:49.940
 from 45th Street in this game a little 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:50.950
 just 0 I think we can 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.790
 to say that they have shown themselves 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:55.810
 opportunistic in his comments 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.810
 yeah that's right 

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.530
 we have been able to recharge the batteries 

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:01.530
 another 45 minutes of effort 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:22.660
 he did not have that before 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.660
 I pushed in the east 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:34.660
 it did not go far 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.000
 the cases the game there on this interception 

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.150
 the head he will see that he has support 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:03.259
 fucking but it's in the fire 

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:17.199
 marx orientations and confirms that it does 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:19.389
 must not leave it unattended does 

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:22.800
 knows what would militate action without 

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:22.800
 his experience and his class 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:27.720
 little visit to 

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:29.960
 a stat it goes a little bit more on the 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:29.960
 shoot 

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:47.940
 an evening that allows you to eat 

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:47.940
 there was room 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.330
 oh that pretty complexion 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:06.110
 always going to play 

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:27.069
 the intention was good but that's the 

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:29.879
 defender who took over there is him 

00:06:27.069 --> 00:06:29.879
 steal the ball 

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:43.409
 no center now 

00:06:38.529 --> 00:06:43.409
 Tangier with this center var but its flight 

00:06:44.610 --> 00:06:47.180
 it's the opposite 

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:50.660
 this double corner 

00:06:52.449 --> 00:06:55.310
 it's been a very long time 

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:57.580
 it's pretty good sign for the end of 

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:57.580
 match 

00:06:58.449 --> 00:07:00.779
 it's good 

00:07:00.889 --> 00:07:04.330
 the goalkeeper who pushes attention 

00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:11.000
 the opponent who takes this ball 

00:07:14.569 --> 00:07:17.889
 defenders will be able to clear 

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:24.529
 c 

00:07:22.409 --> 00:07:24.529
 c 

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:34.050
 to basel the heart of the game there on this 

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:34.050
 interception 

00:07:39.470 --> 00:07:42.040
 will not go further 

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:50.720
 it was a moment 

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:56.480
 suspense we learn that a match under control 

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:58.100
 need a great mastery indeed 

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:59.960
 felt the opponent completely 

00:07:58.100 --> 00:08:02.949
 overworked 

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:02.949
 in u15 the caravaneers
