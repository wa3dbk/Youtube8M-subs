when i start the car sometimes it'll be
black<00:02:36.120> like<00:02:36.420> this<00:02:36.690> and<00:02:36.959> then<00:02:37.620> it<00:02:38.100> won't<00:02:38.340> switch

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
black like this and then it won't switch

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.670 
black like this and then it won't switch
over<00:02:39.209> to<00:02:39.239> the<00:02:39.360> Alpine<00:02:39.780> until<00:02:40.110> I<00:02:40.140> go<00:02:40.410> to<00:02:40.440> the

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
over to the Alpine until I go to the

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.770 
over to the Alpine until I go to the
rear<00:02:40.860> camera<00:02:41.190> and<00:02:41.989> then<00:02:42.989> back<00:02:43.230> to<00:02:43.410> the<00:02:43.560> screen

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:44.780 
rear camera and then back to the screen

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.070 
rear camera and then back to the screen
so<00:02:45.780> now<00:02:45.959> the<00:02:46.019> Alpine<00:02:46.590> is<00:02:46.980> coming<00:02:47.640> up<00:02:47.760> again<00:02:48.090> now

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
so now the Alpine is coming up again now

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.890 
so now the Alpine is coming up again now
if<00:02:49.860> I<00:02:50.819> go<00:02:50.850> to<00:02:51.590> to<00:02:52.590> see<00:02:53.030> my<00:02:54.030> understanding<00:02:54.600> is<00:02:54.690> to

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:54.900 
if I go to to see my understanding is to

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.650 
if I go to to see my understanding is to
see<00:02:55.110> 18<00:02:55.860> is<00:02:56.250> the<00:02:56.700> correct<00:02:57.000> setting<00:02:57.390> for<00:02:57.569> the

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:57.660 
see 18 is the correct setting for the

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.780 
see 18 is the correct setting for the
Alpine<00:02:59.720> so<00:03:00.769> those<00:03:01.769> are<00:03:01.920> my<00:03:01.980> settings<00:03:02.489> so<00:03:02.670> I'm

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
Alpine so those are my settings so I'm

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.290 
Alpine so those are my settings so I'm
set<00:03:03.030> the<00:03:03.150> RVC<00:03:03.690> 01<00:03:04.380> right<00:03:04.680> now<00:03:04.920> and<00:03:05.190> then<00:03:05.880> one

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
set the RVC 01 right now and then one

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:15.050 
set the RVC 01 right now and then one
c10<00:03:06.930> and<00:03:07.459> to<00:03:08.459> see<00:03:08.730> 18<00:03:09.299> and<00:03:10.790> um<00:03:11.790> I<00:03:14.060> discussed

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
c10 and to see 18 and um I discussed

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.030 
c10 and to see 18 and um I discussed
that<00:03:15.329> the<00:03:15.600> problems<00:03:16.019> that<00:03:16.079> I'm<00:03:16.620> having<00:03:16.860> with

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
that the problems that I'm having with

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.789 
that the problems that I'm having with
it<00:03:17.370> so<00:03:17.910> I'm<00:03:18.450> going<00:03:18.510> to<00:03:18.959> wrap<00:03:19.140> this<00:03:19.380> video<00:03:19.590> up

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799 
it so I'm going to wrap this video up

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:22.100 
it so I'm going to wrap this video up
next<00:03:20.579> I'm<00:03:20.700> going<00:03:20.880> to<00:03:21.060> pull<00:03:21.329> out<00:03:21.510> the<00:03:21.540> head<00:03:21.900> unit

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
next I'm going to pull out the head unit

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.009 
next I'm going to pull out the head unit
and<00:03:22.440> show<00:03:23.010> you<00:03:23.070> the<00:03:23.459> the<00:03:23.820> wire<00:03:24.060> connections

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
and show you the the wire connections

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:27.650 
and show you the the wire connections
that<00:03:25.170> are<00:03:25.320> made<00:03:25.560> so<00:03:26.100> hopefully<00:03:26.340> we<00:03:26.700> can<00:03:26.970> figure

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:27.660 
that are made so hopefully we can figure

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:29.990 
that are made so hopefully we can figure
out<00:03:27.810> what<00:03:28.380> what's<00:03:28.680> going<00:03:28.980> on<00:03:29.130> the<00:03:29.579> last<00:03:29.820> thing

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
out what what's going on the last thing

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.630 
out what what's going on the last thing
I'll<00:03:30.180> say<00:03:30.209> about<00:03:30.420> the<00:03:30.780> OEM<00:03:31.170> control<00:03:31.680> is<00:03:31.890> the

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
I'll say about the OEM control is the

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.400 
I'll say about the OEM control is the
only<00:03:32.850> wires<00:03:33.209> that<00:03:33.480> I<00:03:33.540> have<00:03:33.780> running<00:03:34.140> from<00:03:34.290> the

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
only wires that I have running from the

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:37.550 
only wires that I have running from the
Alpine<00:03:34.859> to<00:03:35.340> the<00:03:35.640> qufu<00:03:36.030> tech<00:03:36.209> adapter<00:03:36.750> are<00:03:36.989> the

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.560 
Alpine to the qufu tech adapter are the

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.880 
Alpine to the qufu tech adapter are the
three<00:03:37.890> red<00:03:38.370> white<00:03:38.730> and<00:03:39.060> yellow<00:03:39.620> cables<00:03:40.620> the

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
three red white and yellow cables the

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:43.670 
three red white and yellow cables the
RCA<00:03:41.340> cables<00:03:41.940> so<00:03:42.480> I'm<00:03:42.660> at<00:03:43.170> a<00:03:43.200> loss<00:03:43.410> to

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
RCA cables so I'm at a loss to

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.800 
RCA cables so I'm at a loss to
understand<00:03:44.130> how<00:03:44.489> the<00:03:44.519> OEM<00:03:45.150> control<00:03:45.630> would

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
understand how the OEM control would

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.990 
understand how the OEM control would
work<00:03:46.109> given<00:03:46.859> those<00:03:46.980> are<00:03:47.160> the<00:03:47.280> only<00:03:47.400> cables

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
work given those are the only cables

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.630 
work given those are the only cables
that<00:03:48.180> are<00:03:48.209> that<00:03:48.750> are<00:03:48.810> attached<00:03:49.310> but<00:03:50.310> anyway

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
that are that are attached but anyway

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.019 
that are that are attached but anyway
i'll<00:03:50.850> be<00:03:51.090> going<00:03:51.450> into<00:03:51.570> that<00:03:51.750> next
