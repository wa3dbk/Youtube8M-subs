00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:49.390
 Hello, how are you, very welcome? 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.130
 two cars dot net let's give a 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:53.070
 back in this compass accompanies our 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:55.579
 favor 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.579
 ah 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.960
 Y 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:11.549
 we started 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.560
 although you already know that as always 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.479
 We tested an SUV a vehicle with 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.340
 4x4 features not to boot is a 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.039
 say because well then if you see these 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.229
 difficulties we can overcome without 

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:23.820
 no problems in this case 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.729
 concrete of the jeep compass we are 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.280
 testing the 2.2 diesel version 163 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.229
 horses the 4x4 action but the truth is 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.200
 it has not made us need to connect the 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.780
 4x4 system then good because this 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.149
 type of tracks and broken terrain with 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.720
 potholes and other features 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:44.819
 this guy is good because it is not necessary 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.709
 connect it as you can see as you have already 

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:49.140
 seen outside in these 4 meters and 44 

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:50.909
 centimeters as it is typically equipment 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.849
 will be with that fantastic grill that 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:57.720
 we both like chrome and that responds 

00:01:53.849 --> 00:02:00.450
 then to the wings to the genes not that 

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:01.530
 all jeep in this particular case already you 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.289
 I say we're going here with the traction 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.409
 4 x 2 down here the truth is 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:10.080
 located in a little bit regular 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:11.610
 where it connects to the 4x4 drive 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.020
 but I 'm telling you , it's not necessary 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.940
 connect the for this type of land 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.500
 broken with potholes and others because the car 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.940
 well, that's better than the truck 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.340
 wheel profile and a pretty tire 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:22.080
 decent let's go out now to the asphalt 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.650
 no need to connect or disconnect 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.480
 nothing 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:30.610
 and on the asphalt, well, the truth is 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:34.459
 that behaves quite well enough 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:38.000
 remarkable is a car that is very well 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:41.540
 balanced that so much for that guy there 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.930
 it's a car exclusively to put him 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:48.319
 in the field and doing jobs too 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:50.150
 gross with him or it is a 4x4 but good 

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:53.500
 the truth is that the approach then 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.500
 is let's say something 

00:02:53.730 --> 00:03:00.140
 How would I say? 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:02.570
 very liberated and very very very flat by a 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.130
 very balanced approach especially 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:06.200
 that's why you're already seeing the asphalt 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.520
 it does not balance much obviously either 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.650
 the suspensions are plants to be able 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:11.980
 access to all types of land outside 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:15.050
 of asphalt but the truth is that it's going to 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.030
 fulfill meets quite well in 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:19.250
 any terrain 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.480
 personally it is not the best my opinion 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.630
 is that it is not the best in any of 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:26.060
 them why then because there are other 4x4 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.740
 that go better on asphalt and there are others 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:29.630
 more specific cars for example for 

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:31.820
 works off the asphalt what is in 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.380
 ground bumps in typical work 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:35.390
 cinca etc etc but the truth is that 

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.890
 it's pretty pretty good at all 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:38.750
 them in total is a very good car very 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.890
 balanced at the space level then three 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.930
 adults can go back out 

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:44.810
 quietly the reclining seats 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.400
 and above all, well, the trunk that 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:48.080
 a priori not much 

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.750
 when it is a flat surface 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.830
 tilting the second row of seats 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.900
 for the truth that you get a 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:55.430
 huge surface on which to put 

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.870
 any kind of bulk and any 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:00.410
 upset arm so it's fine 

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:02.660
 right now the 4 x 2 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:04.880
 with the least powerful engine is in 19 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:07.130
 thousand 900 euros of offer that you see here 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:10.370
 it is 26 thousand and I have 163 

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:12.830
 4x4 horses and good the possibility of 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.720
 unlock the attraction at 50/50 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.640
 to be able to leave any terrain 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:18.680
 however difficult it may be, in terms of 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:20.680
 equipment you see is a screen 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:23.630
 touch that does not bring a browser but good 

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:24.830
 wear leather wherever you look 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.570
 seats in truth that pick up 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:29.990
 pretty good and is appreciated especially 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:31.430
 in broken lands the consumption then here 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:33.230
 It says it's 7 liters and a half 

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:34.550
 the truth that when filling the 

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:36.260
 deposit disappeared a little bit more 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:38.330
 but good all these are details that 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.880
 I am advancing you already in this in this 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.990
 small preview of the video the portal 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:43.520
 coches.net from the website of 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:44.960
 reference of the motor world and if you want 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:47.060
 really know how all the 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:49.130
 details of this this car because 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.090
 You know the extensive analysis makes 

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:52.100
 means is that what we do as 

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:53.540
 always portal coches.net so there what 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:56.770
 I leave thanks for being there we'll see you in 

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:56.770
 this one or the next one until soon
