00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.430
 hello youtube people like they were 

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:14.990
 I hope everyone is fine as they see 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:19.250
 the image and I know that many have 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:22.320
 passed when they open the fish they leave 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:26.100
 they do not have enough video 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.199
 or that are have little ram or have another 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.789
 problem as you see in the image I 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:33.710
 currently installed to pro evolution 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:37.100
 soccer '2015 on a laptop 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:39.079
 I have problems that I do not recognize 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.690
 video card you have installed and 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:43.940
 nor the number of gigas that the 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.820
 video card not in my case I have 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:49.519
 one of 2 gigs is not recognizing me 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:52.090
 it is recognizing only the graphics 

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:54.640
 integrated that come with 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:57.310
 with the processor and the memory 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.140
 converted into what is videos that are 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:01.059
 32 megs 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:04.150
 with that every time I come into play 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:05.740
 tells me that the game does not make me 

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:08.290
 computer does not have the requirements 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:11.110
 minimum to run the game and not 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:13.780
 I will be able to run it in the any 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.960
 configuration that I want not for this 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:20.200
 there is a solution 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:22.390
 it's not that your computer is bad 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:26.820
 but your computer is not 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.820
 recognizing the video drivers 

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:32.580
 is recognizing by default the 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:35.650
 intel or amd graphics that you have 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.810
 but for that we're going to have to 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:40.210
 activate it manually 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.730
 we are going to close for example this and here in 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:44.950
 the desktop we are going to give you right click 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:49.020
 and depending on the graphics that that 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:51.670
 have ati or nvidia in my case i have 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.490
 n video I will stay here where it says 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:57.130
 control panel in the video we wait 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.000
 a few seconds and this panel will open 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.060
 control 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.510
 let's go here the upper left part 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:09.840
 where the girl we were going to click on 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:09.840
 and be controlling the configuration in 3d 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.950
 and then here as you will see says processor 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.780
 Graphics preferred this means 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.900
 which is the primary one that you take 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:23.350
 computer if we break down this we have 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.390
 three options automatic selection 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:28.270
 n high performance processor and 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:31.280
 integrated graphics as it was before 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:34.610
 let's give processor n life of 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.350
 high performance and as you will see we have 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.500
 several options for us to be able 

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:42.020
 set activate or deactivate as 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.640
 we want, I recommend you 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.020
 leave it like this is the configuration by 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.800
 defect of the video card that 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.910
 you have and we will give to the 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.270
 bottom part that says 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:52.270
 Apply 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:00.930
 with these gentlemen and any game that 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:04.290
 run that we have installed is going to 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:06.180
 recognize the video card and by 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.520
 course the ability that card 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.910
 video not then crashed what can we 

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.850
 close 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:14.830
 and we will open again the settings of 

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:16.950
 soccer provision this serves to 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:20.320
 any game but I'm doing the 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.880
 this the example with the progress in 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:24.570
 software 2015 that I know what I have 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:24.570
 installed not 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:30.330
 we can configure as we 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.940
 let's want 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:35.700
 and we're going to go to specifications and 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.350
 we have everything as it should be good 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.750
 the processor did not have a problem I have 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:42.510
 an i7 in what will they want I did not have 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.130
 problems has 8 gigas of ram and most 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:47.460
 important that is the video card 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:51.630
 where I did gpu and they recognize me in nvidia 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:53.520
 geforce 820 m and says good and the video 

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:56.400
 Ram is already recognizing me in the 2 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:59.010
 complete gigas that has the card 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.690
 video with this when you enter 

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:04.470
 the game is not going to have any kind of 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:07.560
 problem because the 

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:09.990
 minimum and recommended requirements for 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.760
 run this game I repeat that serves no 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:14.730
 only for super fiber production for 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:16.620
 most games and the same 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.870
 procedure or a similar procedure 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.790
 with those who have the video cards 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:24.120
 to you 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:26.700
 well that would be all if you liked the 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:29.040
 video or it served you to leave it a like because 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.720
 supports the channel very much and I invite you to 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.610
 you sign up because you're going to be a day 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.430
 of all the progress activity of 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:37.730
 super 2015 as well as other topics we 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.730
 we see
