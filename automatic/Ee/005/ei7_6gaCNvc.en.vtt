00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:05.559
 and if you were here and I do this 

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:07.950
 question every night and then the 

00:00:05.559 --> 00:00:10.420
 conclusion that everything would be easier 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:13.000
 I would have a fundamental pillar in my life 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:15.430
 by my side I would have someone to whom 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.939
 hug when I need it the most 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:20.230
 a companion of laughter and tears 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:22.240
 I would have a hand that I could always 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.429
 to come would have so many things that 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.980
 I would need a thousand videos like this for 

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:29.019
 say them all that I do even though you're 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.029
 far they mean much more than a 

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:33.730
 person who is less than one meter 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:35.980
 sea â€‹â€‹because honestly you have made me 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.990
 demonstrated a lot of things even if it's 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.600
 through the computer screen or 

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:42.760
 another side of the phone 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.070
 and I will never find a way to 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.440
 to thank 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.540
 I am surprised at the ease that people 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.000
 have to say that he saw you yesterday by the 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.090
 street for example I would give millions for 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.520
 meet you on the street 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.860
 face to face of special that is 

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:59.510
 If fate has been so bastard 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.660
 get each of the tip of 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.810
 Spain different 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.940
 but you know that I'm going to skip the 

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:08.790
 rules I will beat the pulse of destiny 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.830
 and very soon you will have me 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.360
 side will mock me in the face of all 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.490
 kilometers that separate us by very 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.870
 incredible that it seems to rock the 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.050
 distance and everything that is put to 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:21.180
 finding this story many times is 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:23.910
 difficult to see how to get home after 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.950
 a bad day and you realize that the 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.750
 The only person that makes you happy is at 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.119
 another side of the computer is very 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.220
 complicated that it looks like this and the 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:34.649
 major religions when I receive a letter 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.270
 and I feel that some part of you is 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:38.970
 with me in the form of paper is a 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.430
 Indescribable feeling I want to finish 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.990
 this saying that I am aware that 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.360
 I'm going to have to fire you let 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.490
 to have to return and I'm sure of 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.190
 that is going to be one of the worst moments 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:53.070
 of my life but you know what is best 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.930
 who also became unaware that he never 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.780
 it's going to be a goodbye it's always going to be one 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.880
 stable because I'll make fun of fate 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.550
 times until it is necessary to find you 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.860
 I do not care where I go 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.810
 or the miles that I stand up that 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.700
 as the song says if you go with the 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.320
 moon and I with the sun in each eclipse 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.920
 we will see each other again 

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:15.210
 finally tell you that I love you not 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.690
 make the distance make you forget 

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.690
 that
