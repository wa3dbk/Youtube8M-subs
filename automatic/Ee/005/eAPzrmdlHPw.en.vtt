00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:05.150 
experience it was a new experience we

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.479 
experience it was a new experience we
titled<00:03:05.689> like<00:03:06.049> this<00:03:06.319> that<00:03:06.650> took<00:03:07.189> me<00:03:07.340> by

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489 
titled like this that took me by

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:11.140 
titled like this that took me by
surprise<00:03:08.680> no<00:03:09.680> don't<00:03:10.310> think<00:03:10.489> so<00:03:10.639> I<00:03:10.790> mean<00:03:10.909> I

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
surprise no don't think so I mean I

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:12.459 
surprise no don't think so I mean I
would<00:03:11.329> have<00:03:11.420> thought<00:03:11.599> maybe<00:03:11.930> beginning<00:03:12.379> of

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:12.469 
would have thought maybe beginning of

00:03:12.469 --> 00:03:13.929 
would have thought maybe beginning of
the<00:03:12.560> tournament<00:03:13.040> would<00:03:13.189> have<00:03:13.340> been<00:03:13.639> the<00:03:13.760> case

00:03:13.929 --> 00:03:13.939 
the tournament would have been the case

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:17.649 
the tournament would have been the case
but<00:03:14.269> I<00:03:14.920> mean<00:03:15.920> I<00:03:16.010> think<00:03:16.370> that<00:03:16.519> had<00:03:16.639> zero<00:03:17.120> bearing

00:03:17.649 --> 00:03:17.659 
but I mean I think that had zero bearing
