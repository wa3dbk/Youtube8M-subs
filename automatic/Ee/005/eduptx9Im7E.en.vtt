issues<00:00:50.309> some<00:00:51.309> of<00:00:51.399> the<00:00:51.489> bigger<00:00:51.670> problems<00:00:52.089> that

we had again we're related to the
speaker<00:00:54.219> box<00:00:54.430> we<00:00:55.359> didn't<00:00:55.570> want<00:00:55.719> any<00:00:55.869> gaps<00:00:56.170> we

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.530 
speaker box we didn't want any gaps we

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.950 
speaker box we didn't want any gaps we
didn't<00:00:56.710> want<00:00:56.890> anything<00:00:57.129> like<00:00:57.460> that<00:00:57.489> and<00:00:58.000> so<00:00:58.750> we

00:00:58.950 --> 00:00:58.960 
didn't want anything like that and so we

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.660 
didn't want anything like that and so we
really<00:00:59.409> just<00:00:59.530> had<00:00:59.739> to<00:00:59.859> bring<00:01:00.159> it<00:01:00.369> in<00:01:00.460> and<00:01:00.579> out

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:00.670 
really just had to bring it in and out

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.910 
really just had to bring it in and out
of<00:01:00.820> the<00:01:00.879> car<00:01:01.119> you<00:01:01.510> know<00:01:01.659> 10<00:01:01.930> or<00:01:01.960> 12<00:01:02.260> times<00:01:02.500> and

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:02.920 
of the car you know 10 or 12 times and

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.950 
of the car you know 10 or 12 times and
use<00:01:03.339> fiberglass<00:01:03.729> and<00:01:03.909> bondo<00:01:04.539> what<00:01:04.780> not<00:01:04.929> to

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:04.960 
use fiberglass and bondo what not to

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.830 
use fiberglass and bondo what not to
build<00:01:05.319> it<00:01:05.440> out<00:01:05.640> just<00:01:06.640> enough<00:01:06.819> and<00:01:07.330> come<00:01:07.690> up

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
build it out just enough and come up

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.630 
build it out just enough and come up
with<00:01:07.990> a<00:01:08.050> way<00:01:08.229> of<00:01:08.259> positioning<00:01:09.100> it<00:01:09.220> to<00:01:09.250> where<00:01:09.520> it

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
with a way of positioning it to where it

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.380 
with a way of positioning it to where it
goes<00:01:09.789> in<00:01:10.030> the<00:01:10.149> same<00:01:10.360> way<00:01:10.539> every<00:01:10.780> time<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:12.390> that

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
goes in the same way every time and that

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.600 
goes in the same way every time and that
way<00:01:13.600> once<00:01:14.140> it's<00:01:14.350> painted<00:01:14.590> we're<00:01:15.250> less<00:01:15.580> likely

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 
way once it's painted we're less likely

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.999 
way once it's painted we're less likely
to<00:01:16.090> damage<00:01:16.270> it<00:01:16.690> that<00:01:17.409> was<00:01:17.530> a<00:01:17.619> big<00:01:17.770> process

00:01:17.999 --> 00:01:18.009 
to damage it that was a big process

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:19.380 
to damage it that was a big process
against<00:01:18.670> one<00:01:18.819> of<00:01:18.850> those<00:01:18.970> things<00:01:19.119> where<00:01:19.240> you

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:19.390 
against one of those things where you

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.419 
against one of those things where you
just<00:01:19.420> haul<00:01:19.929> in<00:01:20.140> this<00:01:20.289> you<00:01:20.679> know<00:01:20.799> 50<00:01:21.190> pound

00:01:21.419 --> 00:01:21.429 
just haul in this you know 50 pound

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:23.100 
just haul in this you know 50 pound
piece<00:01:21.729> in<00:01:22.000> and<00:01:22.149> out<00:01:22.240> of<00:01:22.270> the<00:01:22.390> car<00:01:22.600> just<00:01:22.869> all

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.110 
piece in and out of the car just all

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.620 
piece in and out of the car just all
night<00:01:25.200> based<00:01:26.200> on<00:01:26.350> our<00:01:26.409> renderings<00:01:26.979> we<00:01:27.159> had

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
night based on our renderings we had

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.630 
night based on our renderings we had
intercooler<00:01:28.630> piping<00:01:29.080> extending<00:01:29.979> out<00:01:30.130> and

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:30.640 
intercooler piping extending out and

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.389 
intercooler piping extending out and
kind<00:01:31.060> of<00:01:31.119> this<00:01:31.240> open<00:01:31.630> front<00:01:31.929> wheel<00:01:32.140> look<00:01:32.799> to

00:01:33.389 --> 00:01:33.399 
kind of this open front wheel look to

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:34.859 
kind of this open front wheel look to
give<00:01:33.549> it<00:01:33.670> too<00:01:33.819> much<00:01:33.940> of<00:01:34.119> an<00:01:34.209> open<00:01:34.509> look<00:01:34.659> you

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:34.869 
give it too much of an open look you

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:36.929 
give it too much of an open look you
have<00:01:35.020> a<00:01:35.049> lot<00:01:35.259> of<00:01:35.289> ugly<00:01:35.679> substructure<00:01:36.369> issues

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:36.939 
have a lot of ugly substructure issues

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:39.090 
have a lot of ugly substructure issues
that<00:01:37.210> you<00:01:37.899> can't<00:01:38.170> really<00:01:38.380> hide<00:01:38.619> them<00:01:38.859> you

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.100 
that you can't really hide them you

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.819 
that you can't really hide them you
can't<00:01:39.399> cover<00:01:39.969> them<00:01:40.240> you<00:01:41.079> can't<00:01:41.320> cut<00:01:41.560> them<00:01:41.710> out

00:01:41.819 --> 00:01:41.829 
can't cover them you can't cut them out

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:43.260 
can't cover them you can't cut them out
because<00:01:42.100> they're<00:01:42.340> part<00:01:42.520> of<00:01:42.640> the<00:01:42.700> subframe<00:01:43.240> and

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:43.270 
because they're part of the subframe and

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.230 
because they're part of the subframe and
stuff<00:01:43.750> so<00:01:44.590> we<00:01:44.979> had<00:01:45.100> to<00:01:45.219> reshape<00:01:45.520> the<00:01:45.759> bumper<00:01:46.119> to

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
stuff so we had to reshape the bumper to

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.789 
stuff so we had to reshape the bumper to
accommodate<00:01:46.750> that<00:01:46.960> once<00:01:47.289> we<00:01:47.469> got<00:01:47.590> to<00:01:47.649> that

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:47.799 
accommodate that once we got to that

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:50.730 
accommodate that once we got to that
point<00:01:48.219> we<00:01:48.520> we<00:01:49.299> realized<00:01:49.630> that<00:01:49.899> now<00:01:50.109> to<00:01:50.590> have

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
point we we realized that now to have

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.580 
point we we realized that now to have
our<00:01:50.890> piping<00:01:51.450> exposed<00:01:52.450> and<00:01:52.750> protrudes<00:01:53.289> from<00:01:53.409> it

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
our piping exposed and protrudes from it

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.779 
our piping exposed and protrudes from it
it<00:01:54.579> was<00:01:54.759> so<00:01:55.000> close<00:01:55.539> to<00:01:55.929> the<00:01:56.200> edge<00:01:56.350> we<00:01:56.789> decided

00:01:57.779 --> 00:01:57.789 
it was so close to the edge we decided

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:59.370 
it was so close to the edge we decided
to<00:01:58.030> go<00:01:58.179> the<00:01:58.210> other<00:01:58.359> way<00:01:58.509> and<00:01:58.840> hide<00:01:59.079> all<00:01:59.289> the

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
to go the other way and hide all the

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.090 
to go the other way and hide all the
piping

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.860 

so<00:02:05.100> it<00:02:05.340> came<00:02:05.520> up<00:02:05.670> with<00:02:05.700> a<00:02:05.850> lot<00:02:06.030> cleaner<00:02:06.300> look<00:02:06.690> in

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:06.870 
so it came up with a lot cleaner look in

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:07.820 
so it came up with a lot cleaner look in
the<00:02:06.960> end<00:02:07.140> and<00:02:07.260> this<00:02:07.350> is<00:02:07.530> one<00:02:07.680> of<00:02:07.710> those

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
the end and this is one of those

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.980 
the end and this is one of those
practical<00:02:08.280> things<00:02:08.610> that<00:02:08.820> you<00:02:09.450> can<00:02:09.630> have<00:02:09.810> an

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:09.990 
practical things that you can have an

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:11.870 
practical things that you can have an
artist<00:02:10.320> draw<00:02:10.590> forever<00:02:11.070> and<00:02:11.520> they're<00:02:11.760> never

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
artist draw forever and they're never

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.910 
artist draw forever and they're never
going<00:02:12.060> to<00:02:12.180> draw<00:02:12.360> reality<00:02:12.960> for<00:02:13.230> you<00:02:13.380> because

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
going to draw reality for you because

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.340 
going to draw reality for you because
once<00:02:14.190> you<00:02:14.280> start<00:02:14.610> to<00:02:14.670> do<00:02:14.850> it<00:02:14.970> on<00:02:15.060> the<00:02:15.180> car<00:02:15.420> you

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:16.350 
once you start to do it on the car you

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:17.720 
once you start to do it on the car you
realize<00:02:16.680> that<00:02:16.710> you<00:02:16.950> have<00:02:17.100> to<00:02:17.250> change<00:02:17.520> many

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
realize that you have to change many

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.640 
realize that you have to change many
things<00:02:17.820> so<00:02:18.270> that<00:02:18.390> was<00:02:18.510> another<00:02:18.650> another

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
things so that was another another

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.860 
things so that was another another
project<00:02:19.980> we<00:02:20.459> had<00:02:20.670> to<00:02:20.760> deal<00:02:20.940> with<00:02:20.970> was<00:02:21.180> actually

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
project we had to deal with was actually

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.100 
project we had to deal with was actually
redo<00:02:22.260> our<00:02:22.290> intercooler<00:02:22.860> piping<00:02:23.660> in<00:02:24.660> order<00:02:24.990> to

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
redo our intercooler piping in order to

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:28.220 
redo our intercooler piping in order to
bend<00:02:25.620> them<00:02:25.740> tighter<00:02:26.040> and<00:02:26.459> to<00:02:27.180> miss<00:02:27.690> the<00:02:27.870> bumper

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
bend them tighter and to miss the bumper

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.250 
bend them tighter and to miss the bumper
returns<00:02:28.730> so<00:02:29.730> but<00:02:30.000> again<00:02:30.360> if<00:02:30.540> we<00:02:30.570> did<00:02:30.870> resolve

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
returns so but again if we did resolve

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.410 
returns so but again if we did resolve
it<00:02:31.470> it<00:02:31.680> looks<00:02:31.860> fantastic<00:02:34.910> over<00:02:35.910> this<00:02:36.030> weekend

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
it it looks fantastic over this weekend

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.699 
it it looks fantastic over this weekend
we<00:02:36.540> realized<00:02:36.930> that<00:02:37.020> we<00:02:37.140> were<00:02:37.290> really<00:02:37.590> behind

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
we realized that we were really behind

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.690 
we realized that we were really behind
on<00:02:38.100> the<00:02:38.250> build<00:02:39.709> the<00:02:40.709> tolerances<00:02:41.220> are<00:02:41.400> all<00:02:41.489> off

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
on the build the tolerances are all off

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.610 
on the build the tolerances are all off
so<00:02:41.940> everything<00:02:42.300> needs<00:02:42.330> to<00:02:42.600> be<00:02:42.660> refitted<00:02:43.230> in

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
so everything needs to be refitted in

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.190 
so everything needs to be refitted in
such<00:02:44.580> a<00:02:44.610> way<00:02:44.910> it's<00:02:45.270> almost<00:02:45.540> like<00:02:45.780> being<00:02:46.050> a

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
such a way it's almost like being a

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.600 
such a way it's almost like being a
surgeon<00:02:46.440> now<00:02:46.800> because<00:02:47.190> you're<00:02:47.370> everything

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
surgeon now because you're everything

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.120 
surgeon now because you're everything
painted<00:02:47.970> you<00:02:48.390> can't<00:02:48.630> scratch<00:02:48.959> it<00:02:48.989> and<00:02:49.560> yet

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
painted you can't scratch it and yet

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.560 
painted you can't scratch it and yet
you're<00:02:50.250> still<00:02:50.370> gonna<00:02:50.580> have<00:02:50.730> to<00:02:50.880> manipulate<00:02:51.120> it

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
you're still gonna have to manipulate it

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.240 
you're still gonna have to manipulate it
in<00:02:51.690> such<00:02:51.930> a<00:02:51.959> way<00:02:52.080> it's<00:02:52.350> all<00:02:52.560> fit<00:02:52.830> together<00:02:52.950> like

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
in such a way it's all fit together like

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.350 
in such a way it's all fit together like
legos<00:02:55.010> accept<00:02:56.010> all<00:02:56.160> the<00:02:56.250> legos<00:02:56.610> have<00:02:56.820> been<00:02:56.970> you

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
legos accept all the legos have been you

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.120 
legos accept all the legos have been you
know<00:02:57.480> sprayed<00:02:57.959> with<00:02:58.140> paint<00:02:58.410> now<00:02:58.709> so<00:02:59.010> they

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
know sprayed with paint now so they

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:00.650 
know sprayed with paint now so they
don't<00:02:59.310> stick<00:02:59.580> together<00:02:59.880> like<00:03:00.420> they<00:03:00.600> were

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
don't stick together like they were

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.890 
don't stick together like they were
intended<00:03:01.260> and<00:03:01.920> so<00:03:02.400> I<00:03:02.430> called<00:03:02.820> in<00:03:03.000> if<00:03:03.480> you<00:03:03.720> guys

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
intended and so I called in if you guys

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:05.449 
intended and so I called in if you guys
would<00:03:04.200> normally<00:03:04.560> don't<00:03:04.739> even<00:03:04.980> work<00:03:05.100> with<00:03:05.280> us

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
would normally don't even work with us

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.560 
would normally don't even work with us
on<00:03:05.760> a<00:03:05.790> regular<00:03:05.940> basis<00:03:06.570> to<00:03:06.600> pitch<00:03:07.410> in<00:03:08.450> we<00:03:09.450> have

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
on a regular basis to pitch in we have

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.890 
on a regular basis to pitch in we have
one<00:03:09.720> panel<00:03:10.140> in<00:03:10.230> the<00:03:10.320> center<00:03:10.650> console<00:03:11.100> that

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
one panel in the center console that

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.840 
one panel in the center console that
once<00:03:12.900> we<00:03:13.080> incorporated<00:03:13.709> this<00:03:13.950> navigation<00:03:14.459> pie

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
once we incorporated this navigation pie

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:17.509 
once we incorporated this navigation pie
what<00:03:15.690> happened<00:03:16.080> is<00:03:16.140> it<00:03:16.290> distorted<00:03:16.860> that<00:03:17.010> panel

00:03:17.509 --> 00:03:17.519 
what happened is it distorted that panel

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:19.370 
what happened is it distorted that panel
nobody<00:03:18.450> could<00:03:18.630> really<00:03:18.780> tell<00:03:19.110> that<00:03:19.140> it<00:03:19.350> was

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
nobody could really tell that it was

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.830 
nobody could really tell that it was
distorted<00:03:20.130> until<00:03:21.120> we<00:03:21.209> want<00:03:21.360> to<00:03:21.450> put<00:03:21.600> it<00:03:21.690> back

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
distorted until we want to put it back

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.690 
distorted until we want to put it back
in<00:03:22.019> the<00:03:22.080> car<00:03:22.350> so<00:03:22.920> it<00:03:23.100> looks<00:03:23.280> like<00:03:23.340> a

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700 
in the car so it looks like a

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.670 
in the car so it looks like a
million-dollar<00:03:24.060> piece<00:03:24.540> until<00:03:25.320> you<00:03:25.440> went<00:03:25.590> and

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
million-dollar piece until you went and

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.259 
million-dollar piece until you went and
stuck<00:03:25.920> it<00:03:26.070> back<00:03:26.100> in<00:03:26.340> the<00:03:26.430> dash<00:03:26.640> and<00:03:26.970> then<00:03:27.150> it

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
stuck it back in the dash and then it

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.080 
stuck it back in the dash and then it
looked<00:03:27.420> like<00:03:27.510> a<00:03:27.570> you<00:03:27.930> know<00:03:27.959> two<00:03:28.530> dollar<00:03:28.709> piece

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
looked like a you know two dollar piece

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.020 
looked like a you know two dollar piece
that's<00:03:30.090> going<00:03:30.360> to<00:03:30.420> end<00:03:30.540> up<00:03:30.600> in<00:03:30.750> the<00:03:30.840> trash

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:33.030 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.550 

so<00:03:34.030> these<00:03:34.390> are<00:03:34.540> all<00:03:34.570> things<00:03:34.660> again<00:03:35.200> you<00:03:35.230> trip

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
so these are all things again you trip

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:37.020 
so these are all things again you trip
across<00:03:35.800> them<00:03:36.160> as<00:03:36.280> you're<00:03:36.430> going<00:03:36.610> through<00:03:36.760> that

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:37.030 
across them as you're going through that

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:40.020 
across them as you're going through that
final<00:03:37.650> bill<00:03:38.650> we<00:03:39.370> have<00:03:39.400> all<00:03:39.640> kinds<00:03:39.970> of

final bill we have all kinds of

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:42.690 
final bill we have all kinds of
contingencies<00:03:40.720> in<00:03:40.750> place<00:03:40.900> to<00:03:41.350> resolve<00:03:41.650> it<00:03:41.920> not

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:42.700 
contingencies in place to resolve it not

contingencies in place to resolve it not
going<00:03:42.850> to<00:03:42.910> be<00:03:42.970> a<00:03:43.000> farm<00:03:43.270> will<00:03:43.420> make<00:03:43.570> new<00:03:43.750> stuff

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.050 
going to be a farm will make new stuff

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.090 
going to be a farm will make new stuff
it's<00:03:45.010> already<00:03:45.340> being<00:03:45.490> done<00:03:45.730> and<00:03:46.680> should<00:03:47.680> time

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:48.100 
it's already being done and should time

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.400 
it's already being done and should time
