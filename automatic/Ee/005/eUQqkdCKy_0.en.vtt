00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.760
 wee 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:20.150
 nice to meet you 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:20.150
 The farmer Yoon Si- hyun who overcame the cancer with dandelion. 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:28.550
 No matter how I think that example, I found others standing in a pair of late that day 30 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:34.400
 And 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:37.370
 There is a metastasis to the lymph nodes, and the thyroid is totally resected. 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:43.790
 I have been treated in the Radiological Clinic. 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:44.870
 Oh yeah, you are right at the rank of each pair of malignant. 

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:50.239
 Yes, 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:55.489
 Nami 2, which is this transition, bounces again according to the type of organization and the exception is wrong. 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:58.339
 So that is largely constant over the size of the cancer grows or like that, or transition 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:05.440
 When you have an advantage, you really have to be actively treated. 

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:08.900
 Oh, by building yet, why is it being the person you like does get better control the arm real 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:13.760
 I felt where my body was going to like it. 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:16.760
 If I was as bad as my body , 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:22.070
 I was not in good health. 

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:25.880
 And my walking foot is so heavy that my feet are heavy 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:31.430
 It looks like Riley weighs heavily 4 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:35.420
 But eating dandelion made my feet lighter, 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:38.220
 Off when you try to farm from dawn until late at night I never strive tap 20% 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:42.960
 By analyzing the line by line, 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:47.700
 Oh, yeah. I 'm going to endure it . Look at radiation therapy for thyroid cancer. Yeah. 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:49.410
 In general, radiation therapy means that in modern medicine, cancer cells 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:54.750
 How to kill it, but it's not easy. 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:02:00.720
 Yes, normal tissue is damaged. Once you get chemo, you're exhausted. 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:02:05.400
 Yes, I do not know. 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:11.640
 And it jyeotneunde Toka tteuni when the transition happened something like this been like inflammation Why 

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:15.300
 Actually inspire me to investigate the radiation on animals 2 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:21.270
 When I saw the dandelion drilling, I was able to reduce this aftereffect again. 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:26.220
 That's Aaa many times I eat I overheard 1l Releases its essence that the transfer 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:30.750
 The body has a little more to be a little sick Analects I always tired 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:35.420
 I'm interested in interesting things. I wonder if it's a dandelion effect . 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.420
 No, gotta be vain consulting wonsik 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:45.340
 You guys are now largely divided into two classes I or yellow flowers, yellow sheep standing Province 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:50.140
 It's a white dandelion with dandelions and white flowers. 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:54.129
 Come spiritual grumbling yellow dandelion white dandelions are compared with vitamins and minerals 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:58.480
 And these minerals are somewhat higher. 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:03:02.530
 So, for example, giwangyimyeon during those two varieties for example, 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:07.840
 How do I get this to work because I want to eat something native to my country? 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:11.980
 Oh really white'm 10 this year before falling again several structures 5 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:17.739
 Further modifications when viewed in good Dandelion very difficult 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:19.810
 I am very sensitive to this, so the rate of growth is higher than that of Western-style dandelions . 

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:25.480
 Four times slower 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:30.060
 And Western yellow dandelions bloom year round, but native white dandelions are one year old 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:30.060
 It 's morning to bloom just once.
