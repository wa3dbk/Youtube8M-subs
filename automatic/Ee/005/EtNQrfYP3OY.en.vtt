00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.780 
then don't look at the viewfinder on the

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.819 
then don't look at the viewfinder on the
camera<00:00:33.230> only<00:00:33.770> look<00:00:34.070> at<00:00:34.250> the<00:00:34.399> tip<00:00:34.640> and<00:00:35.710> pour<00:00:36.710> it

in<00:00:36.979> there<00:00:37.159> I'm<00:00:37.640> getting<00:00:37.850> a<00:00:38.059> generous<00:00:38.569> dose<00:00:38.870> of

00:00:39.069 --> 00:00:39.079 
in there I'm getting a generous dose of

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:42.610 
in there I'm getting a generous dose of
dye<00:00:39.289> because<00:00:40.159> this<00:00:40.489> leaks<00:00:40.729> out<00:00:40.940> in<00:00:41.149> a<00:00:41.239> week<00:00:41.620> and

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
dye because this leaks out in a week and

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.059 
dye because this leaks out in a week and
Isis<00:00:43.129> poke<00:00:43.460> it's<00:00:43.969> just<00:00:44.350> how<00:00:45.350> do<00:00:45.409> you<00:00:45.559> look<00:00:45.800> I

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:46.069 
Isis poke it's just how do you look I

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:48.939 
Isis poke it's just how do you look I
can't<00:00:46.519> decide<00:00:46.879> if<00:00:46.909> I<00:00:47.179> should<00:00:47.210> say<00:00:47.600> suppose<00:00:48.530> or

00:00:48.939 --> 00:00:48.949 
can't decide if I should say suppose or

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:51.789 
can't decide if I should say suppose or
suspect<00:00:49.609> but<00:00:50.479> either<00:00:50.629> way<00:00:50.960> I<00:00:51.260> think<00:00:51.350> this

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:51.799 
suspect but either way I think this

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:53.289 
suspect but either way I think this
thing's<00:00:52.039> got<00:00:52.249> a<00:00:52.280> leak<00:00:52.549> in<00:00:52.699> three<00:00:52.969> or<00:00:53.089> four

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:53.299 
thing's got a leak in three or four

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:55.539 
thing's got a leak in three or four
different<00:00:53.479> places<00:00:53.929> so<00:00:54.709> I<00:00:54.739> want<00:00:55.039> a<00:00:55.100> lot<00:00:55.280> of<00:00:55.399> dye

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:55.549 
different places so I want a lot of dye

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:57.849 
different places so I want a lot of dye
in<00:00:55.850> its<00:00:56.089> that<00:00:56.299> I'll<00:00:56.449> be<00:00:56.569> able<00:00:56.659> to<00:00:56.839> get<00:00:57.559> enough

00:00:57.849 --> 00:00:57.859 
in its that I'll be able to get enough

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:00.430 
in its that I'll be able to get enough
dye<00:00:58.069> to<00:00:58.129> find<00:00:58.489> them<00:00:58.670> so<00:00:59.299> that's<00:00:59.959> how<00:01:00.139> you<00:01:00.199> do<00:01:00.409> it

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.440 
dye to find them so that's how you do it

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.629 
dye to find them so that's how you do it
and<00:01:00.589> then<00:01:00.709> I'm<00:01:00.799> going<00:01:00.920> to<00:01:00.949> clean<00:01:01.159> it<00:01:01.190> up<00:01:01.399> real

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:01.639 
and then I'm going to clean it up real

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
anything that's spilled over and then

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.850

I'm<00:01:05.000> going<00:01:05.089> to<00:01:05.150> put<00:01:05.269> it<00:01:05.360> together<00:01:05.479> and<00:01:05.930> then

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:06.860 
I'm going to put it together and then

I'm going to put it together and then
I'm<00:01:07.010> going<00:01:07.160> to<00:01:07.220> clean<00:01:07.520> it<00:01:07.670> again<00:01:07.760> after<00:01:08.210> it's

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:08.480 
I'm going to clean it again after it's

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.450 
I'm going to clean it again after it's
together<00:01:08.840> I<00:01:09.200> like<00:01:09.650> to<00:01:09.830> use<00:01:09.950> brake<00:01:10.220> parts

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
together I like to use brake parts

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.540 
together I like to use brake parts
cleaner<00:01:10.610> to<00:01:11.030> clean<00:01:11.060> it<00:01:11.390> once<00:01:11.540> it's<00:01:11.750> together

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:12.550 
cleaner to clean it once it's together

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.790 
cleaner to clean it once it's together
that's<00:01:13.550> how<00:01:13.640> I<00:01:13.730> do<00:01:13.850> it<00:01:14.060> so<00:01:14.290> I'm<00:01:15.290> working<00:01:15.530> on<00:01:15.740> a

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:15.800 
that's how I do it so I'm working on a

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.380 
that's how I do it so I'm working on a
little<00:01:16.130> hot<00:01:16.550> dog

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:17.390 
little hot dog

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:20.590 
little hot dog
accord<00:01:18.110> and<00:01:18.580> we<00:01:19.580> got<00:01:19.760> an<00:01:19.880> air<00:01:20.060> conditioning

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
accord and we got an air conditioning

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.780 
accord and we got an air conditioning
system<00:01:20.660> leak<00:01:21.260> where<00:01:22.100> we<00:01:22.220> go<00:01:22.370> into<00:01:22.610> the

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
system leak where we go into the

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.600 
system leak where we go into the
firewall<00:01:23.360> is<00:01:23.720> right<00:01:24.050> back<00:01:24.260> here<00:01:24.680> and<00:01:25.400> that's

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
firewall is right back here and that's

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.040 
firewall is right back here and that's
what<00:01:25.790> I<00:01:25.850> thought<00:01:26.030> the<00:01:26.240> leak<00:01:26.420> was<00:01:26.600> going<00:01:26.840> to<00:01:26.930> be

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.050 
what I thought the leak was going to be

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.320 
what I thought the leak was going to be
if<00:01:27.260> I<00:01:27.410> was<00:01:27.530> going<00:01:27.680> to<00:01:27.710> be<00:01:27.830> there<00:01:28.130> and<00:01:28.430> here

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:29.330 
if I was going to be there and here

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.200 
if I was going to be there and here
based<00:01:29.660> on<00:01:29.930> the<00:01:30.110> guy<00:01:30.260> who<00:01:30.320> would<00:01:31.100> replace<00:01:31.820> the

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
based on the guy who would replace the

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.050 
based on the guy who would replace the
lines<00:01:32.450> and<00:01:32.810> wound<00:01:33.050> up<00:01:33.170> having<00:01:33.380> it<00:01:33.560> leak<00:01:33.740> out<00:01:34.060> so

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
lines and wound up having it leak out so

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.630 
lines and wound up having it leak out so
anyway<00:01:35.300> I<00:01:35.330> put<00:01:35.600> the<00:01:35.720> system<00:01:36.080> full<00:01:36.230> of<00:01:36.350> dye<00:01:36.640> and

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:37.640 
anyway I put the system full of dye and

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.720 
anyway I put the system full of dye and
as<00:01:38.330> you<00:01:38.480> look<00:01:38.630> across<00:01:38.810> here<00:01:39.500> you<00:01:40.340> can<00:01:40.490> see<00:01:40.700> a

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:40.730 
as you look across here you can see a

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:42.820 
as you look across here you can see a
little<00:01:40.970> bit<00:01:41.180> of<00:01:41.330> the<00:01:41.450> dye<00:01:41.660> here<00:01:42.140> and<00:01:42.350> maybe

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
little bit of the dye here and maybe

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:44.620 
little bit of the dye here and maybe
that<00:01:43.070> was<00:01:43.190> from<00:01:43.460> just<00:01:43.640> when<00:01:43.850> I<00:01:43.880> put<00:01:43.970> the<00:01:44.270> dye<00:01:44.420> in

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
that was from just when I put the dye in

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.180 
that was from just when I put the dye in
or<00:01:44.900> not<00:01:45.020> I<00:01:45.320> thought<00:01:45.560> I<00:01:45.590> cleaned<00:01:45.890> it<00:01:45.950> pretty

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:46.190 
or not I thought I cleaned it pretty

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.610 
or not I thought I cleaned it pretty
well<00:01:46.430> but<00:01:46.610> I<00:01:46.670> see<00:01:46.909> something<00:01:47.240> there<00:01:47.390> and<00:01:48.080> then

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:48.620 
well but I see something there and then

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.120 
well but I see something there and then
when<00:01:48.830> you<00:01:48.950> look<00:01:49.100> down<00:01:49.400> through<00:01:49.670> here<00:01:51.130> things

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130 
when you look down through here things

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:53.740 
when you look down through here things
don't<00:01:52.400> look<00:01:52.550> too<00:01:52.610> bad<00:01:52.970> when<00:01:53.150> we<00:01:53.180> grab<00:01:53.420> a<00:01:53.450> light

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
don't look too bad when we grab a light

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.320 
don't look too bad when we grab a light
so<00:01:54.020> you<00:01:54.320> can<00:01:54.350> show<00:01:54.950> it<00:01:55.130> up<00:01:55.250> on<00:01:55.430> camera<00:01:55.820> a<00:01:56.090> little

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
so you can show it up on camera a little

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.530 
so you can show it up on camera a little
better<00:01:56.540> you<00:01:57.409> look<00:01:57.590> through<00:01:57.860> here<00:01:58.070> and<00:01:58.540> things

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540 
better you look through here and things

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.390 
better you look through here and things
are<00:01:59.690> looking<00:01:59.750> okay<00:02:00.409> not<00:02:01.250> too<00:02:01.490> bad<00:02:03.220> you<00:02:04.220> get<00:02:04.370> a

little long here you can see a little

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.460 
little long here you can see a little
bit<00:02:07.040> of<00:02:07.190> wetness<00:02:07.430> not<00:02:08.239> really<00:02:08.539> there's<00:02:09.409> a

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
bit of wetness not really there's a

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:12.399 
bit of wetness not really there's a
little<00:02:09.739> bit<00:02:09.830> of<00:02:09.950> a<00:02:10.039> dye<00:02:10.250> right<00:02:10.579> there<00:02:11.349> let<00:02:12.349> me

00:02:12.399 --> 00:02:12.409 
little bit of a dye right there let me

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:13.809 
little bit of a dye right there let me
show<00:02:12.620> you<00:02:12.680> what<00:02:12.920> it<00:02:13.040> looks<00:02:13.249> like<00:02:13.459> when<00:02:13.730> you

00:02:13.809 --> 00:02:13.819 
show you what it looks like when you

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:14.770 
show you what it looks like when you
turn<00:02:13.999> on<00:02:14.030> the<00:02:14.299> camera

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
turn on the camera

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:24.640

definitely<00:02:42.080> a<00:02:42.110> leaking<00:02:42.500> oh<00:02:42.650> ring<00:02:42.890> on<00:02:43.040> both

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
definitely a leaking oh ring on both

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:44.920 
definitely a leaking oh ring on both
sides<00:02:43.489> of<00:02:43.610> the<00:02:43.760> nut<00:02:43.970> so<00:02:44.180> you<00:02:44.239> can<00:02:44.420> see<00:02:44.630> the<00:02:44.750> die

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:44.930 
sides of the nut so you can see the die

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:48.190 
sides of the nut so you can see the die
and<00:02:45.410> as<00:02:46.340> far<00:02:46.580> as<00:02:46.790> this<00:02:46.970> cap<00:02:47.269> goes<00:02:47.300> this<00:02:47.900> is<00:02:48.050> the

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
and as far as this cap goes this is the

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.680 
and as far as this cap goes this is the
low<00:02:48.380> side<00:02:48.650> cap<00:02:49.000> it's<00:02:50.000> just<00:02:50.209> blowing<00:02:50.600> out

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
low side cap it's just blowing out

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.720 
low side cap it's just blowing out
everywhere<00:02:51.230> this<00:02:51.500> is<00:02:51.709> a<00:02:51.830> conversion<00:02:52.489> but<00:02:52.610> you

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:52.730 
everywhere this is a conversion but you

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.540 
everywhere this is a conversion but you
can<00:02:52.910> see<00:02:53.120> that<00:02:53.330> it's<00:02:53.600> just<00:02:54.130> dumping<00:02:55.130> the<00:02:55.280> stuff

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:55.550 
can see that it's just dumping the stuff

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.479 
can see that it's just dumping the stuff
out<00:02:55.820> I<00:02:55.850> mean<00:02:56.150> it's<00:02:56.330> very<00:02:56.420> apparent<00:02:57.250> you<00:02:58.250> look

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489 
out I mean it's very apparent you look

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:02.199 
out I mean it's very apparent you look
down<00:02:58.700> inside<00:02:58.970> of<00:02:59.209> here<00:02:59.720> I<00:03:00.760> got<00:03:01.760> to<00:03:01.880> do<00:03:02.120> an

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:02.209 
down inside of here I got to do an

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:04.690 
down inside of here I got to do an
adjustment<00:03:02.980> holding<00:03:03.980> these<00:03:04.130> funky<00:03:04.519> glasses

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:04.700 
adjustment holding these funky glasses

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.080 
adjustment holding these funky glasses
over<00:03:05.269> the<00:03:05.390> camera<00:03:05.769> so<00:03:06.769> anyway<00:03:07.160> looking<00:03:07.880> down

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
over the camera so anyway looking down

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.920 
over the camera so anyway looking down
through<00:03:08.269> here<00:03:08.690> nothing<00:03:10.030> across<00:03:11.030> this<00:03:11.480> one<00:03:11.720> you

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
through here nothing across this one you

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.590 
through here nothing across this one you
can<00:03:12.080> see<00:03:12.110> just<00:03:12.470> a<00:03:12.650> little<00:03:13.010> bit<00:03:13.160> of<00:03:13.370> dye<00:03:14.030> sitting

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
can see just a little bit of dye sitting

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.290 
can see just a little bit of dye sitting
on<00:03:14.750> a<00:03:14.780> spiderweb

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.300 
on a spiderweb

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.210 
on a spiderweb
right<00:03:17.300> there<00:03:17.630> even<00:03:18.350> that<00:03:18.500> shows<00:03:18.829> up<00:03:19.040> like

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
right there even that shows up like

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:24.190 
right there even that shows up like
crazy<00:03:19.720> and<00:03:20.720> then<00:03:20.959> you<00:03:20.989> come<00:03:21.380> over<00:03:21.560> here<00:03:22.570> kaboom

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:24.200 
crazy and then you come over here kaboom

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.130 
crazy and then you come over here kaboom
I<00:03:24.230> mean<00:03:24.620> it's<00:03:24.799> just<00:03:24.890> all<00:03:25.250> die<00:03:25.570> you<00:03:26.570> look<00:03:26.780> around

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:27.140 
I mean it's just all die you look around

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:28.660 
I mean it's just all die you look around
from<00:03:27.320> this<00:03:27.500> side<00:03:27.769> you<00:03:27.980> can<00:03:28.130> see<00:03:28.370> it<00:03:28.489> it<00:03:28.579> was

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:28.670 
from this side you can see it it was

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.270 
from this side you can see it it was
just<00:03:28.880> pouring<00:03:29.390> down<00:03:29.420> like<00:03:30.200> the<00:03:30.350> AC<00:03:30.500> oil<00:03:30.980> with

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
just pouring down like the AC oil with

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.880 
just pouring down like the AC oil with
the<00:03:31.430> dye<00:03:31.610> in<00:03:31.820> it<00:03:32.230> becomes<00:03:33.230> very<00:03:33.500> apparent

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:33.890 
the dye in it becomes very apparent

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:36.729 
the dye in it becomes very apparent
where<00:03:34.190> the<00:03:34.310> leaks<00:03:34.549> are<00:03:34.870> we<00:03:35.870> have<00:03:36.049> three<00:03:36.500> leaks

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:36.739 
where the leaks are we have three leaks

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:39.670 
where the leaks are we have three leaks
we<00:03:37.040> have<00:03:37.250> one<00:03:37.549> at<00:03:38.150> the<00:03:38.450> conversion<00:03:38.989> port<00:03:39.290> here

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
we have one at the conversion port here

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.789 
we have one at the conversion port here
we<00:03:40.459> have<00:03:40.579> another<00:03:40.910> leak<00:03:41.239> at<00:03:41.870> this<00:03:42.140> Union<00:03:42.620> at

00:03:42.789 --> 00:03:42.799 
we have another leak at this Union at

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:45.660 
we have another leak at this Union at
the<00:03:42.890> o-ring<00:03:43.250> and<00:03:43.570> then<00:03:44.570> down<00:03:44.810> in<00:03:44.989> here

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 
the o-ring and then down in here

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:48.370 
the o-ring and then down in here
something's<00:03:46.670> failed<00:03:46.970> horribly<00:03:47.329> I<00:03:47.840> got<00:03:48.260> to

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:48.380 
something's failed horribly I got to

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.560 
something's failed horribly I got to
open<00:03:48.530> it<00:03:48.769> up<00:03:48.950> and<00:03:49.160> isolate<00:03:50.030> where<00:03:50.239> it<00:03:50.390> came

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:50.570 
open it up and isolate where it came

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:52.000 
open it up and isolate where it came
from<00:03:50.630> but<00:03:51.140> you<00:03:51.260> can<00:03:51.380> definitely<00:03:51.560> tell<00:03:51.859> that

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
from but you can definitely tell that

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:56.680 
from but you can definitely tell that
there's<00:03:52.340> a<00:03:52.400> significant<00:03:53.090> link<00:03:53.299> there<00:03:53.540> so<00:03:55.690> nice

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:56.690 
there's a significant link there so nice

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.650 
there's a significant link there so nice
to<00:03:56.930> have<00:03:57.109> the<00:03:57.320> dye<00:03:57.579> so<00:03:58.579> that<00:03:58.820> you<00:03:59.030> can<00:03:59.239> get<00:03:59.450> in

00:03:59.650 --> 00:03:59.660 
to have the dye so that you can get in

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:01.990 
to have the dye so that you can get in
there<00:03:59.870> and<00:04:00.079> see<00:04:00.769> specifically<00:04:01.400> where<00:04:01.670> stuff

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:02.000 
there and see specifically where stuff

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.780 
there and see specifically where stuff
is<00:04:02.269> for<00:04:03.049> example<00:04:03.560> we<00:04:03.739> knew<00:04:03.920> that<00:04:04.130> was<00:04:04.310> leaking

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:04.790 
is for example we knew that was leaking

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:07.660 
is for example we knew that was leaking
here<00:04:05.410> you<00:04:06.410> can<00:04:06.530> see<00:04:06.680> the<00:04:06.799> residue<00:04:07.130> everywhere

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 
here you can see the residue everywhere

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:09.550 
here you can see the residue everywhere
you<00:04:07.730> can<00:04:07.850> see<00:04:07.880> a<00:04:08.000> little<00:04:08.180> here<00:04:08.600> when<00:04:09.290> you<00:04:09.410> see

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
you can see a little here when you see

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.170 
you can see a little here when you see

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
it on both sides of the nut you know

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.990 
it on both sides of the nut you know
that<00:04:11.359> o-rings<00:04:11.780> to<00:04:11.840> add<00:04:12.160> so<00:04:13.160> it's<00:04:13.700> just<00:04:13.790> really

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
that o-rings to add so it's just really

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.190 
that o-rings to add so it's just really
nice<00:04:14.329> to<00:04:14.359> be<00:04:14.540> able<00:04:14.660> to<00:04:14.870> have<00:04:15.019> that

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.200 
nice to be able to have that

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.400 
nice to be able to have that
confirmation<00:04:15.980> I<00:04:16.190> put<00:04:17.060> two<00:04:17.390> shots<00:04:17.750> of<00:04:17.959> dye<00:04:18.169> this

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:18.410 
confirmation I put two shots of dye this

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:20.140 
confirmation I put two shots of dye this
as<00:04:18.560> the<00:04:18.709> dye<00:04:18.859> that<00:04:18.890> I<00:04:19.220> use<00:04:19.549> just<00:04:19.820> because<00:04:19.940> I

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
as the dye that I use just because I

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:21.969 
as the dye that I use just because I
like<00:04:20.329> being<00:04:20.570> able<00:04:20.750> to<00:04:20.900> meter<00:04:21.169> it<00:04:21.380> in<00:04:21.530> there<00:04:21.739> I

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:21.979 
like being able to meter it in there I

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:26.320 
like being able to meter it in there I
use<00:04:22.580> the<00:04:23.440> certified<00:04:24.440> AC<00:04:24.650> pro<00:04:25.130> but<00:04:26.000> it's<00:04:26.180> just

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
use the certified AC pro but it's just

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.810 
use the certified AC pro but it's just
like<00:04:26.620> you<00:04:27.620> ever<00:04:27.800> see<00:04:27.890> the<00:04:28.280> prod

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:28.820 
like you ever see the prod

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.600 
like you ever see the prod
feel<00:04:29.300> stabilizer<00:04:29.900> now<00:04:30.860> it's<00:04:31.100> got<00:04:31.310> the<00:04:31.460> little

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
feel stabilizer now it's got the little

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.190 
feel stabilizer now it's got the little
port<00:04:32.000> on<00:04:32.180> it<00:04:32.210> to<00:04:32.510> where<00:04:32.630> you<00:04:32.780> can<00:04:32.810> fill

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:33.200 
port on it to where you can fill

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.350 
port on it to where you can fill
something<00:04:33.650> up<00:04:33.770> and<00:04:33.950> measure<00:04:34.130> it<00:04:34.400> out<00:04:34.580> I<00:04:34.940> mean

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360 
something up and measure it out I mean

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:37.240 
something up and measure it out I mean
that's<00:04:35.540> what<00:04:35.750> this<00:04:35.900> does<00:04:36.230> I<00:04:36.500> really<00:04:36.800> like<00:04:36.980> that

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:37.250 
that's what this does I really like that

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:41.260 
that's what this does I really like that
I<00:04:37.520> used<00:04:38.410> looks<00:04:39.410> like<00:04:39.590> half<00:04:39.860> an<00:04:40.040> ounce<00:04:40.190> which<00:04:41.150> is

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270 
I used looks like half an ounce which is

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.810 
I used looks like half an ounce which is
actually<00:04:41.630> a<00:04:41.660> lot<00:04:41.900> of<00:04:42.050> dye<00:04:42.230> for<00:04:42.530> a<00:04:42.560> system<00:04:43.070> but

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:43.820 
actually a lot of dye for a system but

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:45.490 
actually a lot of dye for a system but
with<00:04:44.000> this<00:04:44.270> where<00:04:44.660> the<00:04:44.780> guy<00:04:44.930> says<00:04:45.170> there's<00:04:45.380> a

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:45.500 
with this where the guy says there's a

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:47.050 
with this where the guy says there's a
few<00:04:45.800> things<00:04:46.070> where<00:04:46.280> I<00:04:46.310> couldn't<00:04:46.700> find<00:04:46.910> the

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
few things where I couldn't find the

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.490 
few things where I couldn't find the
right<00:04:47.090> o-ring<00:04:47.660> and<00:04:47.840> I<00:04:47.900> just<00:04:48.110> put<00:04:48.290> it<00:04:48.380> together

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:48.500 
right o-ring and I just put it together

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.040 
right o-ring and I just put it together
anyway<00:04:49.160> I<00:04:49.400> might<00:04:49.760> dude<00:04:50.000> I<00:04:50.150> want<00:04:50.390> a<00:04:50.510> lot<00:04:50.720> of<00:04:50.900> dye

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.050 
anyway I might dude I want a lot of dye

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:53.440 
anyway I might dude I want a lot of dye
in<00:04:51.290> there<00:04:51.530> so<00:04:51.710> that<00:04:51.770> I<00:04:51.950> can<00:04:52.160> find<00:04:53.030> multiple

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:53.450 
in there so that I can find multiple

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:55.270 
in there so that I can find multiple
leaks<00:04:53.690> at<00:04:53.960> one<00:04:54.110> time<00:04:54.410> and<00:04:54.590> not<00:04:54.710> have<00:04:54.890> to<00:04:55.070> waste

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.280 
leaks at one time and not have to waste

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.290 
leaks at one time and not have to waste
a<00:04:55.610> lot<00:04:56.150> of<00:04:56.420> the<00:04:57.250> r134a<00:04:58.250> because<00:04:58.850> it's<00:04:59.060> getting

00:04:59.290 --> 00:04:59.300 
a lot of the r134a because it's getting

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:00.820 
a lot of the r134a because it's getting
expensive<00:04:59.630> these<00:05:00.140> days<00:05:00.380> because<00:05:00.590> they're

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:00.830 
expensive these days because they're

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:02.740 
expensive these days because they're
phasing<00:05:01.070> it<00:05:01.370> out<00:05:01.520> to<00:05:01.760> go<00:05:01.910> with<00:05:02.060> that<00:05:02.240> propane

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:02.750 
phasing it out to go with that propane

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:05.950 
phasing it out to go with that propane
based<00:05:03.080> one<00:05:04.120> anyway<00:05:05.120> just<00:05:05.480> thought<00:05:05.690> I'd<00:05:05.810> share

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:05.960 
based one anyway just thought I'd share

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:09.310 
based one anyway just thought I'd share
that<00:05:06.020> it's<00:05:06.320> pretty<00:05:06.560> good<00:05:06.770> example<00:05:07.340> of<00:05:07.900> dye<00:05:08.900> and

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:09.320 
that it's pretty good example of dye and

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.970 
that it's pretty good example of dye and
head<00:05:09.710> I<00:05:09.860> can<00:05:10.130> make<00:05:10.280> your<00:05:10.430> job<00:05:10.640> a<00:05:10.670> lot<00:05:10.910> easier
