00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:15.299
 mainz people know each other here with one 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.220
 another gameplay commentary and it is 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.810
 actually should already ewigkeiten ago 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.000
 I last commented before three 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.220
 and I must say I was 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.769
 quite a long time before the adjusted 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.920
 play and I now yesterday 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.390
 played briefly and this is it 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.059
 game player stood a relative 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:35.610
 fast moab on the mat has in the team 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.280
 man 10.6 i believe who from where 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.340
 comes about after three minutes 30 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.450
 that was about to happen and that's why 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.910
 originated yesterday 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.170
 I am here with the specialists 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.750
 killstreaks we can get there 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.489
 first as the first burkhard and culprit 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.100
 pull fast second and as 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.850
 third name looter and then stop 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.510
 After eight teams, everything gets completely 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.850
 nice 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.359
 I'm a bit with the apa me 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:06.299
 got there as essays rapid fire and 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.700
 external textedit max but fast 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:11.880
 still shoot exactly rapid fire and 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.650
 silencer and yes it works 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.330
 as long as I'm off pretty well for that 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:18.000
 People did not do that 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:21.600
 could really have the weapon there 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.549
 play well with these and play 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.960
 Yes, I just wanted to talk about it today 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.200
 Talk about the game now 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:30.329
 meanwhile I improved 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.479
 have to say yes it has improved 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:35.009
 partly fun again 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:36.720
 the right thing in things like that 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.369
 fmg new children and we want to 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.710
 significantly weaker in general 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.780
 that weapon balancing has significantly 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.340
 improved 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.079
 and then you have to say it for the 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.090
 places in the last patch finally everything 

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:49.590
 was done correctly and finally 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:51.570
 The coffee time is still a bit 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.759
 strong and so on clear the weapons 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.219
 jiggle a bit but in big 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.200
 It's okay, but that's all 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:00.210
 play just something in itself 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.880
 I just puke find so easy 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:04.409
 this coincidence yes i do not know me 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.420
 can not really describe it 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.459
 but I like something about the game 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.810
 not at all and I really have it 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.700
 every time I play the game 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.040
 that it makes fun in the beginning and so on 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.840
 but that fits 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.209
 one with the correct time to the rough 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.510
 play and then you are really in trouble 

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:22.010
 and he is really a bit weird 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.799
 hard to describe what that is exactly 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.780
 it 's just these different ones 

00:02:24.799 --> 00:02:28.700
 arms yes if you just can not go and 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.549
 That's what we call a new cinema or one 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:34.430
 new way or if someone is in a cafÃ© 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:36.319
 ten really rough camp with holds kitsch 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.829
 and then you have no chance anymore 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:41.510
 somehow quick on this tip 

00:02:39.829 --> 00:02:43.129
 that he can not have a predator and thus 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.060
 gets and is a combat helicopter 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:45.709
 just too easy a 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.700
 Combat helicopters helicopters and such 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.500
 to get further 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.120
 Well, it is also relatively easy 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.590
 shoot but then I have in 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.239
 the game has got along with it 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.530
 the patches are still improving 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:55.579
 not so now i will say it 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.919
 is a good game 

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:59.540
 So it's okay now 

00:02:57.919 --> 00:03:01.010
 meanwhile you can play this again 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:02.269
 for the people again 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.650
 they can have a little variety 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:05.299
 Definitely again in the morning three 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.569
 lay there has really been the last 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:09.650
 patches big i done it there and 

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:11.000
 play again 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.260
 you can even in the comments 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.349
 Write if you have a few more 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.629
 I want to see gameplays for the game 

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:19.790
 I think I'll play games too 

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:21.470
 get hold of it because it is really very 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.389
 just nice or even to get 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.069
 and you break some of that already 

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:28.040
 so that should not be a problem there 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:29.900
 to play a gameplay and here I am 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.549
 now know more defensive because I am short 

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:33.379
 full moab stand 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:35.690
 I thought so come get the 

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:37.359
 Legs in the hand and off you go and has 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:38.959
 me then also in the beautiful topshot him 

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:41.060
 removed 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:44.229
 yes the gameplay ends then now synonymous 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:48.769
 already here with 1 135 2 I think 

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:50.479
 So I have to say the game anyway 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:52.459
 has improved so yes it is up 

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:54.290
 every case worth trying again 

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:55.609
 put game number 1 for those 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:59.180
 they really do not care about the game 

00:03:55.609 --> 00:04:01.010
 just like me, but still 

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:03.109
 the patches on with too much effect 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.090
 not as blatant as black ops 

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:05.930
 Blackwater really does not do that in the beginning 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.819
 good playability 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.989
 but I have to say after the second 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:12.620
 third petzschner the game actually 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:14.780
 it's perfect and has infected me 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.489
 well done in the end with the patch 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.789
 However, they have a lot too 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:21.979
 long needed for it is good work 

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:23.479
 it is much larger than in finland 

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:25.010
 I do not know what you can do 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:25.600
 write the comments what you think about 

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:28.210
 that 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.250
 It took a fm g9 too long 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.170
 defuse or just hold in general 

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:32.770
 to match weapons so I understand it 

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:34.600
 not really 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:38.310
 but well the game face over me today 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.310
 fall to see you next time
