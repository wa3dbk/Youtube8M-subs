weight<00:01:56.580> on<00:01:56.610> the<00:01:56.850> springs<00:01:57.180> your<00:01:58.140> accurate<00:01:58.590> ride

00:01:59.000 --> 00:01:59.010 
weight on the springs your accurate ride

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:00.050 
weight on the springs your accurate ride
height<00:01:59.190> is<00:01:59.280> not<00:01:59.430> gonna<00:01:59.610> be<00:01:59.700> right<00:01:59.850> because

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
height is not gonna be right because

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.160 
height is not gonna be right because
it's<00:02:00.240> gonna<00:02:00.330> be<00:02:00.420> no<00:02:00.540> weight<00:02:00.720> on<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:00.900> springs

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
it's gonna be no weight on the springs

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.620 
it's gonna be no weight on the springs
so<00:02:01.860> like<00:02:02.010> I<00:02:02.130> said<00:02:02.190> lower<00:02:03.060> the<00:02:03.210> vehicle<00:02:03.300> down

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
so like I said lower the vehicle down

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.840 
so like I said lower the vehicle down
then<00:02:04.140> tighten<00:02:04.470> the<00:02:04.560> bolts<00:02:04.680> now<00:02:05.369> you<00:02:05.430> can<00:02:05.700> see

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
then tighten the bolts now you can see

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.400 
then tighten the bolts now you can see
what<00:02:06.030> a<00:02:06.060> dramatic<00:02:06.240> difference<00:02:06.540> four<00:02:07.140> inches
