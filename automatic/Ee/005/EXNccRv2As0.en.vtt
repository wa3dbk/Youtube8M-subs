arrived<00:03:29.760> the<00:03:29.910> alternators<00:03:30.510> we<00:03:30.690> got<00:03:30.840> a

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:31.020 
arrived the alternators we got a

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:33.350 
arrived the alternators we got a
crescendo<00:03:31.350> audio<00:03:32.040> amplifiers<00:03:32.670> and<00:03:33.060> those<00:03:33.210> are

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:33.360 
crescendo audio amplifiers and those are

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.120 
crescendo audio amplifiers and those are
psi<00:03:33.900> audio<00:03:34.470> subwoofers

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
psi audio subwoofers

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:37.770 
these are crescendo logic ladders the

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:40.400 
these are crescendo logic ladders the
skin<00:03:38.040> right<00:03:38.220> now<00:03:38.280> oh<00:03:38.730> I<00:03:38.970> was<00:03:39.330> up<00:03:39.510> I<00:03:39.750> was<00:03:39.810> testing

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410 
skin right now oh I was up I was testing

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:41.780 
skin right now oh I was up I was testing
the<00:03:40.530> levels<00:03:40.830> of<00:03:40.950> the<00:03:41.040> amplifiers<00:03:41.430> make<00:03:41.640> sure

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
the levels of the amplifiers make sure

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.540 
the levels of the amplifiers make sure
each<00:03:42.030> one<00:03:42.060> of<00:03:42.360> them<00:03:42.480> matches<00:03:43.040> what<00:03:44.040> kind<00:03:44.250> of<00:03:44.340> is

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:44.550 
each one of them matches what kind of is

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:46.400 
each one of them matches what kind of is
the<00:03:44.730> good<00:03:44.910> one<00:03:45.090> oh<00:03:45.270> that's<00:03:45.600> real<00:03:45.930> good<00:03:46.230> that's
