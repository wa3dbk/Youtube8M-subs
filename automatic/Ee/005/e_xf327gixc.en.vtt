00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
couple ways but here's three ways that i

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.310 
couple ways but here's three ways that i
know<00:00:36.719> of<00:00:36.899> i've<00:00:37.829> heard<00:00:38.040> of<00:00:38.870> one<00:00:39.870> of<00:00:39.960> them<00:00:40.079> is<00:00:40.200> an

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
know of i've heard of one of them is an

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.729 
know of i've heard of one of them is an
app<00:00:40.440> called<00:00:40.680> carrier<00:00:41.129> IQ<00:00:41.340> process<00:00:42.059> killer<00:00:42.300> and

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:42.739 
app called carrier IQ process killer and

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:48.040 
app called carrier IQ process killer and
from<00:00:43.739> what<00:00:43.920> i<00:00:43.950> understand<00:00:45.140> this<00:00:46.140> makes<00:00:46.500> it<00:00:46.680> so

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:48.050 
from what i understand this makes it so

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:55.939 
from what i understand this makes it so
you<00:00:49.050> can<00:00:50.030> go<00:00:51.030> ahead<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:53.120> kill<00:00:54.120> carrier<00:00:55.020> IQ<00:00:55.170> or

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949 
you can go ahead and kill carrier IQ or

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:02.900 
you can go ahead and kill carrier IQ or
one<00:00:56.879> time<00:00:57.469> just<00:00:58.469> one<00:00:58.559> time<00:00:58.739> while<00:00:59.250> you<00:01:01.670> at<00:01:02.670> one

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
one time just one time while you at one

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:09.050 
one time just one time while you at one
time<00:01:03.120> i<00:01:03.180> suppose<00:01:03.600> but<00:01:03.650> one<00:01:04.650> time<00:01:07.970> until<00:01:08.970> you

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
time i suppose but one time until you

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.320 
time i suppose but one time until you
reboot<00:01:09.210> i<00:01:09.540> should<00:01:09.750> say<00:01:10.460> so<00:01:11.460> there<00:01:11.670> is<00:01:11.880> carrier

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
reboot i should say so there is carrier

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.999 
reboot i should say so there is carrier

to<00:02:23.850> me<00:02:23.970> yesterday<00:02:24.180> after<00:02:24.870> i<00:02:24.900> talked<00:02:25.200> about

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
to me yesterday after i talked about

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.380 
to me yesterday after i talked about
carrier<00:02:27.330> IQ<00:02:27.480> in<00:02:28.140> the<00:02:28.200> video<00:02:28.590> and<00:02:28.770> posted<00:02:29.070> it

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390 
carrier IQ in the video and posted it

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:35.260 
carrier IQ in the video and posted it
it's<00:02:30.390> called<00:02:30.630> logging<00:02:31.470> test<00:02:31.800> app<00:02:32.040> pro<00:02:32.460> key<00:02:33.110> so

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
it's called logging test app pro key so

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:38.900 
it's called logging test app pro key so
logging<00:02:36.270> test<00:02:36.540> step<00:02:36.780> obviously<00:02:37.490> would<00:02:38.490> be<00:02:38.640> the

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
logging test step obviously would be the

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.730 
logging test step obviously would be the
original<00:02:39.090> app<00:02:39.420> but<00:02:39.690> the<00:02:39.870> pro<00:02:40.110> key<00:02:42.590> you<00:02:43.590> need

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
original app but the pro key you need

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.890 
original app but the pro key you need
route<00:02:43.980> to<00:02:44.130> do<00:02:44.220> it<00:02:44.370> so<00:02:44.760> if<00:02:45.060> you<00:02:45.570> don't<00:02:45.690> have<00:02:45.840> a

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
route to do it so if you don't have a

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.490 
route to do it so if you don't have a
root<00:02:46.110> device<00:02:46.490> you<00:02:47.490> don't<00:02:47.700> want<00:02:47.820> to<00:02:47.910> do<00:02:48.000> it<00:02:48.150> and

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
root device you don't want to do it and

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.960 
root device you don't want to do it and
of<00:02:49.500> course<00:02:49.740> this<00:02:49.830> is<00:02:50.010> only<00:02:50.100> really<00:02:50.520> good<00:02:50.790> if

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
of course this is only really good if

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.480 
of course this is only really good if
you<00:02:51.060> don't<00:02:51.210> have<00:02:51.330> a<00:02:51.360> rom<00:02:52.040> you<00:02:53.040> can<00:02:53.190> destroy

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:53.490 
you don't have a rom you can destroy

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:55.280 
you don't have a rom you can destroy
your<00:02:53.520> phone<00:02:53.880> and<00:02:54.270> then<00:02:54.750> rom<00:02:54.960> it<00:02:55.170> to

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
your phone and then rom it to

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:56.750 
your phone and then rom it to
cyanogenmod<00:02:55.800> and<00:02:56.160> they<00:02:56.310> don't<00:02:56.430> have<00:02:56.550> it

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
cyanogenmod and they don't have it

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.030 
cyanogenmod and they don't have it
