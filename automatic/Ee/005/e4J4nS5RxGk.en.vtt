00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.460
 that moment but I would like us to 

00:00:00.659 --> 00:00:03.929
 go to porto allÃ¨gre to find 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.370
 last of the adjustment and for us 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:14.280
 talk about those Algerians who approached him 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:15.240
 up close these fennecs of amiens good then 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.150

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.580
 link problem with brazil 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.990
 not want not valid ona damien we're going 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.250
 hear it right away and well I'm going 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.600
 give you the floor right behind 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.939
 to tell us about this Algerian damian 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.680
 dubras to porto alegre 

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:30.539
 good ben dilla friends welcome to porto 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.510
 alegre just now at 4 pm 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:36.180
 local will be held the second match of 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.710
 algeria facing south korea after 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.030
 an inaugural defeat against the 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.670
 belgium we could cross some 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.460
 Algerian fans yesterday at the airport 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.379
 from Porto Alegre and all entrusted us 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.270
 that they hoped to see another Algeria 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.710
 other fennecs fennecs a little 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.500
 little more offensive fennecs a little 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.789
 little more Mediterranean listen to me 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.050
 think the reserve team gave his 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.020
 better access than to make a mistake 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.030
 the last pro game and I think I have 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.440
 really 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:02.420
 we will see the Algerian team that is 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.699
 supposed to be last time you play 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.830
 Algerian with the midfield if we lose with 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.720
 what is presented as I do not 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.799
 serious but as we play in Belgium 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.990
 we did not like 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:13.869
 even if we win and we do not like this game 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.760
 will be able to pass to the second round at least 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:17.260
 and 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:21.010
 it's used to go to the second round it's 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.700
 already that there after that is all the bonus the 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.350
 of the bowl 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.620
 I hope we will do like France 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.900
 who carded yesterday there when you're proud 

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:30.460
 of that they played well to continue 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.190
 to dream is what the hope of 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.690
 Algerian fans why not a 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.000
 qualification for the eighths of 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:38.410
 final in time in any case obviously 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.400
 it is their widespread wish and 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.490
 finally when we look at the 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.690
 composition of this group is enough 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.880
 possible why not because this group 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.160
 is extremely tight since this 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.930
 group counts russia belgium the 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.170
 korea and algeria and that for the moment 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:55.900
 only Belgium has won 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.610
 thank you damien I turn to nabil g 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.830
 liter who were with us this team 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:01.120
 ii did not win a match this team 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.490
 from Algeria has not won a match since 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:05.140
 1982 that's it between the chili 3 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.729
 So today it would be 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.350
 history to see Algeria is needed and 

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:09.310
 we are reduced to his voice actually 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:09.940
 it's a bit sad for football 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.130
 Algerian 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.870
 didier i know you know better than me 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.570
 that it's a football that has given birth to 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:17.950
 great artists of dahleb madjer and 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.150
 belloumi in the 80s they 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:19.810
 had their place in the biggest 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.730
 European clubs 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.070
 they came in 2010 he was from 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.850
 back after a difficult phase it's 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:25.720
 sure they did not want to 

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.430
 take two beating they played 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.750
 behind but here today is they going to us 

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.989
 had not necessarily sold a team 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.700
 as defensive as when when 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:35.590
 this match face to face with the Belgians 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:36.580
 the goal is not just to win for 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:37.000
 the Algerians the goal is to get 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.170
 to qualify 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.090
 I mean for observers 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.500
 algeria is the outsider of the 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.880
 group but Algerians understand 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.620
 not it makes they have they have players 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.430
 it's balloon handlers they have 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.750
 want to go ahead they want 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:48.400
 to win so we expect a team 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.110
 of Algeria much more ambitious and 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.459
 then she is back to the wall one of all 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.390
 the ways the program an idea of 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:53.470
 team composition 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.180
 even if it's not the composition 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.350
 official dish broken in the 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.570
 good because I know here only about 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:59.680
 team 21 we rarely get wrong on 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:01.060
 the crew compositions each time 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.160
 that you participated I see you 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.500
 participated with 50.1 I wanted 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.519
 site is excellent on this one there 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.200
 changes anyway 1 compared to 

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:09.459
 match change then mesbah left 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.170
 should be tenured instead of 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:12.880
 ghoulam a priori it keeps the same time 

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:14.170
 the same central hinge with halliche 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.030
 bougherra m'bolhi who was very good 

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.440
 against the Belgians right integration 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.900
 of a true right-hand side of craft 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.519
 beg in place of mehdi mostefa 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.530
 medjani central hinge which is a 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:25.640
 central advocate training for 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.860
 strengthen the central focus that vahid 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:30.350
 invalid a little bit scared bentaleb to 

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:31.940
 left 19 years old tottenham player very 

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.050
 interesting at the top left the little 

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.600
 Algerian pearl that we do not know 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:37.610
 here 27-year-old abdelmoumen djabou nicknamed 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.540
 the Algerian messi ahmed 64 g is still doing 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:40.430
 the little pearl 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:41.450
 she is a little weathered what she is a 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:42.980
 little tired but he had to sign to 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.209
 monaco two or three years ago but it is 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.220
 gone to the African club for a million 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:47.930
 and a half dollars over two years so 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.520
 after we prefer to be king at home 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.140
 sometimes I take risks to readers 

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.540
 yacine brahimi the best dribbler of 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:55.040
 liga that all of Algeria is waiting on who 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:56.450
 well, you have to pay attention to 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.739
 the providential man but good at all 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.700
 case it is a quality player who must 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:03:59.209
 to be a member of this team is 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:00.950
 a certitude 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:03.950
 on the right the technical leader sofiane 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.510
 feghouli is in peak like a dress 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.519
 djilas was preferred to the other scorer 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:08.390
 islam slimani house that should return 

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:10.459
 during the match 

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:12.620
 didier you believe in this Algeria there 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:14.930
 he sold well a clever to know the 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.459
 paper there we see of course I believe 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.590
 but you have to actually get 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:19.880
 free good this first match it's true 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:22.040
 that for there might have been pressure 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.790
 particular expects a lot from them they 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.890
 do not have much experience 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:28.250
 international if any 

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:29.810
 not to the portrait janssen of young people it is 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:33.020
 Belgium is a scarecrow 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:35.240
 you lead to 0 and even the Belgians would have 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:37.340
 could be reduced to ten on the action 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.979
 quite quickly 27th minute of memory 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.690
 it means that after unconsciously you 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:43.700
 what do you want to keep 

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:45.500
 enough this little advantage and they 

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:48.500
 have gone back way too much and it's hard 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:51.500
 still to hold this almost 65 

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:52.610
 minutes in vahid coaching was 

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.320
 questioned on this match because 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:56.150
 it's the 60th we were waiting for it to come back 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:58.070
 an arm ni or a jabou to redo 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.750
 mount the block and blow the 

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:01.370
 defense that did not stop taking 

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.990
 waves since Algeria is not 

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:04.669
 not three passes 3 passes forward 

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:06.290
 since all the players were 30 

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:09.010
 meters of their goal it's not too much in 

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:09.010
 the habit of Khodjali
