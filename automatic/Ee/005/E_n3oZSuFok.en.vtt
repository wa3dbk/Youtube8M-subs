for today's video I'm going to be
talking<00:00:18.400> about<00:00:18.849> protein<00:00:19.630> powder<00:00:20.009> more

00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:21.009 
talking about protein powder more

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:22.350 
talking about protein powder more
specifically<00:00:21.640> some<00:00:21.939> of<00:00:21.970> the<00:00:22.119> myths

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:22.360 
specifically some of the myths

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.480 
specifically some of the myths
associated<00:00:22.779> with<00:00:23.169> protein<00:00:23.650> powder<00:00:23.680> and<00:00:24.250> some

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:24.490 
associated with protein powder and some

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:26.700 
associated with protein powder and some
misconceptions<00:00:25.329> that<00:00:25.689> a<00:00:26.140> lot<00:00:26.289> of<00:00:26.410> people

hopefully the by exposing some of these

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.900 
hopefully the by exposing some of these
myths<00:00:31.509> I<00:00:31.750> can<00:00:32.020> save<00:00:32.200> you<00:00:32.320> some<00:00:32.349> cash<00:00:32.739> and<00:00:33.190> make

myths I can save you some cash and make
you<00:00:34.090> realize<00:00:34.420> that<00:00:34.450> protein<00:00:35.020> powder<00:00:35.290> isn't

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.100 
you realize that protein powder isn't

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.639 
you realize that protein powder isn't
really<00:00:36.340> was<00:00:36.750> rumored<00:00:37.750> to<00:00:37.780> be<00:00:38.020> or<00:00:38.320> what<00:00:38.500> it's

00:00:38.639 --> 00:00:38.649 
really was rumored to be or what it's

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:40.950 
really was rumored to be or what it's
cracked<00:00:38.890> up<00:00:39.040> to<00:00:39.100> be<00:00:39.510> so<00:00:40.510> I'm<00:00:40.660> going<00:00:40.809> to<00:00:40.870> go

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:40.960 
cracked up to be so I'm going to go

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.900 
cracked up to be so I'm going to go
through<00:00:41.230> five<00:00:41.469> five<00:00:42.129> of<00:00:42.309> the<00:00:42.370> most<00:00:42.520> common

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:42.910 
through five five of the most common

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:45.510 
through five five of the most common
myths<00:00:43.120> and<00:00:43.420> yeah<00:00:44.350> let's<00:00:44.680> get<00:00:44.829> started

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:45.520 
myths and yeah let's get started

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.060 
myths and yeah let's get started
so<00:00:46.420> first<00:00:46.870> myth<00:00:47.079> you<00:00:47.230> hear<00:00:47.410> everyone<00:00:47.740> saying

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.070 
so first myth you hear everyone saying

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.490 
so first myth you hear everyone saying
is<00:00:48.400> that<00:00:48.730> you<00:00:49.090> need<00:00:49.300> protein<00:00:49.570> powder<00:00:50.079> to<00:00:50.200> build

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:50.500 
is that you need protein powder to build

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.920 
is that you need protein powder to build
muscle<00:00:50.950> this<00:00:51.910> is<00:00:52.120> not<00:00:52.329> correct

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:52.930 
muscle this is not correct

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:54.960 
muscle this is not correct
you<00:00:53.200> don't<00:00:53.560> need<00:00:53.829> protein<00:00:54.340> powder<00:00:54.579> to<00:00:54.790> build

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:54.970 
you don't need protein powder to build

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.530 
you don't need protein powder to build
muscle<00:00:55.420> you<00:00:56.170> do<00:00:56.470> however<00:00:56.770> need<00:00:57.130> protein<00:00:57.790> now

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:58.540 
muscle you do however need protein now

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.690 
muscle you do however need protein now
you<00:00:58.930> can<00:00:59.079> get<00:00:59.230> protein<00:00:59.470> from<00:00:59.920> various<00:01:00.460> sources

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:00.700 
you can get protein from various sources

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.760 
you can get protein from various sources
such<00:01:01.210> as<00:01:01.239> chicken<00:01:02.370> meat<00:01:03.390> seafood<00:01:04.500> past<00:01:05.500> the

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 
such as chicken meat seafood past the

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:11.700 
such as chicken meat seafood past the
house<00:01:05.950> on<00:01:06.189> protein<00:01:06.700> grains<00:01:08.280> eggs<00:01:09.600> cheese<00:01:10.710> milk

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
house on protein grains eggs cheese milk

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.800 
house on protein grains eggs cheese milk
the<00:01:12.100> list<00:01:12.460> is<00:01:12.640> endless<00:01:12.850> of<00:01:13.210> the<00:01:13.420> various

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
the list is endless of the various

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.890 
the list is endless of the various
protein<00:01:14.229> sources<00:01:14.530> you<00:01:14.740> can<00:01:14.890> get<00:01:15.240> what<00:01:16.240> is<00:01:16.420> more

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:16.900 
protein sources you can get what is more

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.270 
protein sources you can get what is more
important<00:01:17.530> is<00:01:17.820> achieving<00:01:19.200> daily<00:01:20.280> recommend

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
important is achieving daily recommend

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.730 
important is achieving daily recommend
the<00:01:21.400> dosage<00:01:21.820> of<00:01:21.940> protein<00:01:22.510> so<00:01:22.780> most<00:01:23.200> for<00:01:23.560> most

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
the dosage of protein so most for most

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.760 
the dosage of protein so most for most
people<00:01:24.190> it's<00:01:24.430> recommended<00:01:24.970> that<00:01:25.000> you<00:01:25.180> get<00:01:25.770> one

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:26.770 
people it's recommended that you get one

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.890 
people it's recommended that you get one
gram<00:01:27.010> of<00:01:27.040> protein<00:01:27.159> per<00:01:27.850> pound<00:01:28.119> of<00:01:28.479> body<00:01:28.720> weight

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:28.900 
gram of protein per pound of body weight

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.530 
gram of protein per pound of body weight
so<00:01:29.650> you<00:01:30.369> don't<00:01:30.400> need<00:01:30.850> to<00:01:30.940> get<00:01:31.119> this<00:01:31.240> through

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:31.540 
so you don't need to get this through

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.270 
so you don't need to get this through
protein<00:01:31.810> powder<00:01:32.290> you<00:01:32.530> can<00:01:32.710> get<00:01:32.890> this<00:01:33.010> through

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
protein powder you can get this through

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.890 
protein powder you can get this through
any<00:01:33.460> fruit<00:01:33.820> sauce<00:01:34.000> you<00:01:34.210> like<00:01:34.390> whether<00:01:34.600> it<00:01:34.810> be

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:34.900 
any fruit sauce you like whether it be

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.240 
any fruit sauce you like whether it be
the<00:01:35.110> chicken<00:01:35.409> the<00:01:35.830> meat<00:01:36.070> milk<00:01:36.580> eggs<00:01:36.940> whatever

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
the chicken the meat milk eggs whatever

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.830 
the chicken the meat milk eggs whatever
so<00:01:39.250> the<00:01:39.670> point<00:01:39.940> what<00:01:40.119> the<00:01:40.150> protein<00:01:40.659> powder

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
so the point what the protein powder

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.719 
so the point what the protein powder
does<00:01:41.200> is<00:01:41.439> it<00:01:41.560> helps<00:01:41.740> you<00:01:41.920> to<00:01:42.010> achieve<00:01:42.250> this

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:42.729 
does is it helps you to achieve this

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:44.789 
does is it helps you to achieve this
goal<00:01:42.790> it<00:01:43.390> can<00:01:43.600> be<00:01:43.689> pretty<00:01:43.930> hard<00:01:44.200> to<00:01:44.290> do<00:01:44.530> things

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:44.799 
goal it can be pretty hard to do things

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:47.250 
goal it can be pretty hard to do things
like<00:01:45.010> eat<00:01:45.369> a<00:01:45.400> steak<00:01:45.760> for<00:01:46.030> breakfast<00:01:46.570> or<00:01:46.900> you

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:47.260 
like eat a steak for breakfast or you

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:49.679 
like eat a steak for breakfast or you
know<00:01:47.380> cook<00:01:47.710> chicken<00:01:48.010> for<00:01:48.670> breakfast<00:01:49.060> so

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:49.689 
know cook chicken for breakfast so

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:51.620 
know cook chicken for breakfast so
protein<00:01:50.200> powder<00:01:50.439> can<00:01:50.680> make<00:01:50.830> this<00:01:51.010> job<00:01:51.310> easier

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
protein powder can make this job easier

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:54.210 
protein powder can make this job easier
but<00:01:52.630> it's<00:01:52.750> not<00:01:52.960> 100%<00:01:53.110> necessary

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 
but it's not 100% necessary

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.219 
but it's not 100% necessary
you<00:01:54.430> don't<00:01:54.790> need<00:01:55.119> protein<00:01:55.659> powder<00:01:55.900> to<00:01:55.990> build

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:56.229 
you don't need protein powder to build

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:58.260 
you don't need protein powder to build
muscle<00:01:56.590> you<00:01:56.740> can<00:01:56.860> get<00:01:57.189> enough<00:01:57.430> protein<00:01:57.700> from

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
muscle you can get enough protein from

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.960 
muscle you can get enough protein from
various<00:01:58.689> other<00:01:58.930> food<00:01:59.259> sources<00:01:59.680> the<00:02:00.520> second
