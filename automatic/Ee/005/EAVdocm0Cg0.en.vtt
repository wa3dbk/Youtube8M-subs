good<00:01:09.310> idea<00:01:09.490> I<00:01:09.759> think<00:01:09.970> if<00:01:10.360> you're<00:01:10.479> producing

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
good idea I think if you're producing

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.150 
good idea I think if you're producing
yourself<00:01:11.349> to<00:01:12.160> give<00:01:12.459> yourself<00:01:12.880> a<00:01:13.000> deadline<00:01:14.160> you

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:15.160 
yourself to give yourself a deadline you

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.130 
yourself to give yourself a deadline you
can<00:01:15.520> move<00:01:15.819> it<00:01:16.000> if<00:01:16.149> you<00:01:16.330> absolutely<00:01:16.810> have<00:01:17.110> to

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
can move it if you absolutely have to

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.309 
can move it if you absolutely have to
but<00:01:17.920> what<00:01:18.069> I<00:01:18.099> say<00:01:18.369> is<00:01:18.640> you<00:01:18.700> know<00:01:19.000> what<00:01:19.030> book<00:01:19.630> the

yourself<00:03:50.739> on<00:03:50.920> tape<00:03:51.190> if<00:03:51.430> you<00:03:51.459> remember<00:03:52.030> the

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:52.120 
yourself on tape if you remember the

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:54.240 
yourself on tape if you remember the
first<00:03:52.330> time<00:03:52.540> you<00:03:52.660> ever<00:03:52.690> heard<00:03:52.989> yourself<00:03:53.250> you

first time you ever heard yourself you

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:56.400

know coming back off of a device
you<00:03:56.470> know<00:03:56.560> I<00:03:56.590> say<00:03:56.830> tape<00:03:57.070> but<00:03:57.250> these<00:03:57.489> days<00:03:57.640> of

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:57.820 
you know I say tape but these days of

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:00.090 
you know I say tape but these days of
course<00:03:57.970> there's<00:03:58.180> there's<00:03:58.450> no<00:03:58.570> tape<00:03:59.010> you<00:04:00.010> know

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 
course there's there's no tape you know

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.400 
course there's there's no tape you know
it's<00:04:00.310> very<00:04:00.370> it's<00:04:00.820> very<00:04:01.150> hard<00:04:01.480> to<00:04:01.570> judge<00:04:02.140> those

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.410 
it's very it's very hard to judge those

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.040 
it's very it's very hard to judge those
things<00:04:02.739> for<00:04:02.950> yourself<00:04:03.370> so<00:04:03.850> getting<00:04:04.209> some<00:04:04.570> some

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:05.050 
things for yourself so getting some some

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:07.830 
things for yourself so getting some some
unbiased<00:04:05.860> feedback<00:04:06.100> is<00:04:06.520> good<00:04:06.760> it<00:04:07.450> can<00:04:07.720> be

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
unbiased feedback is good it can be

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.990 
unbiased feedback is good it can be
dangerous<00:04:08.080> too<00:04:08.620> because<00:04:09.459> if<00:04:09.640> you're<00:04:09.760> very

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
dangerous too because if you're very

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.449 
dangerous too because if you're very
fragile<00:04:10.600> or<00:04:10.810> you<00:04:11.080> know<00:04:11.200> and<00:04:11.770> that's<00:04:11.920> why<00:04:12.070> it's

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459 
fragile or you know and that's why it's

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:14.160 
fragile or you know and that's why it's
a<00:04:12.520> good<00:04:12.610> idea<00:04:12.670> to<00:04:12.940> cast<00:04:13.270> a<00:04:13.420> pretty<00:04:13.570> wide<00:04:13.690> neck

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:14.170 
a good idea to cast a pretty wide neck

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:15.840 
a good idea to cast a pretty wide neck
because<00:04:14.890> if<00:04:15.010> you<00:04:15.100> only<00:04:15.250> play<00:04:15.519> it<00:04:15.580> for<00:04:15.700> one<00:04:15.820> or

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:15.850 
because if you only play it for one or

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:17.550 
because if you only play it for one or
two<00:04:15.970> people<00:04:16.390> and<00:04:16.570> they<00:04:16.959> give<00:04:17.140> you<00:04:17.230> some<00:04:17.410> really

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
two people and they give you some really

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.920 
two people and they give you some really
bad<00:04:17.799> advice<00:04:18.190> that<00:04:19.000> can<00:04:19.209> be<00:04:19.359> almost<00:04:19.510> worse<00:04:19.900> than

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
bad advice that can be almost worse than

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:22.020 
bad advice that can be almost worse than
not<00:04:20.200> getting<00:04:20.440> any<00:04:20.560> advice<00:04:20.919> at<00:04:21.130> all<00:04:21.250> so<00:04:21.700> I<00:04:21.730> would

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:22.030 
not getting any advice at all so I would

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:23.670 
not getting any advice at all so I would
I<00:04:22.240> would<00:04:22.419> say<00:04:22.630> if<00:04:22.780> you're<00:04:22.870> going<00:04:23.169> to<00:04:23.350> do<00:04:23.500> this

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:23.680 
I would say if you're going to do this

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.230 
I would say if you're going to do this
and<00:04:23.919> it's<00:04:24.070> a<00:04:24.160> it's<00:04:24.370> a<00:04:24.490> it's<00:04:24.520> a<00:04:24.790> good<00:04:24.970> thing<00:04:25.120> to

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
and it's a it's a it's a good thing to

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.670 
and it's a it's a it's a good thing to
do<00:04:25.330> but<00:04:25.480> if<00:04:25.600> you're<00:04:25.720> going<00:04:25.840> to<00:04:25.930> do<00:04:26.080> this<00:04:26.260> you

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
do but if you're going to do this you

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.800 
do but if you're going to do this you
know<00:04:26.800> go<00:04:27.130> ahead<00:04:27.280> and<00:04:27.550> get<00:04:27.700> a<00:04:27.729> half<00:04:28.090> dozen<00:04:28.360> or<00:04:28.780> a

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
know go ahead and get a half dozen or a

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:30.779 
know go ahead and get a half dozen or a
dozen<00:04:28.900> people<00:04:29.620> that<00:04:29.800> you<00:04:29.919> play<00:04:30.130> it<00:04:30.280> for<00:04:30.310> and

dozen people that you play it for and
you<00:04:31.750> know<00:04:31.870> so<00:04:32.200> you<00:04:32.260> can

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:32.860 
you know so you can

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.700 
you know so you can
actually<00:04:33.069> see<00:04:33.490> what<00:04:33.969> the<00:04:34.180> trend<00:04:34.599> is<00:04:34.900> and<00:04:35.229> if

have to finish it's hard to know when

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:00.990 
have to finish it's hard to know when
it's<00:04:59.229> finished<00:04:59.500> sometimes<00:05:00.009> you<00:05:00.250> just<00:05:00.280> know

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:01.000
