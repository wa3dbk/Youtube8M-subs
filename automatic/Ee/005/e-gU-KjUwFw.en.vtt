00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:06.779
 they directly transform a fuel into electricity and heat without passing 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:11.580
 through a combustion process they do not produce pollutants and 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.199
 they have a very high efficiency 

00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:17.869
 we are talking about fuel cells one of the most technologies 

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:22.519
 promising to address the energy and environmental problems of our time 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.640
 are already on the market inside portable generators to charge the 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.010
 mobiles and PCs we will soon find in our homes to produce 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:33.880
 electricity and heat 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.510
 the state of research into the prospects for fuel cells 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.920
 we spoke at juro ki anzio we'll sell technologies dampi kei chan un 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.970
 conference promoted by the University of Perugia 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:49.980
 napoli parthenope it all american society with ingenieros mechanic 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:55.860
 the event attracted major world experts in the sector together with the world 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.340
 national and international industry to outline the scenarios 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.010
 future and market opportunities 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.370
 ceo provided 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.260
 around the universities and research centers to also do business cubase for 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.280
 to realize what comes out today we buy abroad for the abruzzo in 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.980
 society 

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:14.810
 in the hi-tech sector, today we import almost all the technology 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.850
 from abroad good in his if we have it so it is instead still played with 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:21.430
 important because the Italian core technology 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.430
 but we need this. ita not be wasted pd tone may be in you 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.530
 me the cupation of the twins balance of payments elisa for once 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.520
 exposed removal of Italian technology Alessandro certainly does not 

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.400
 therefore Italian technology resulting from the synergy between the industry of around 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.730
 to compete successfully in the green economy 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:46.380
 I have always had this role of ecological transfer, I believe in the 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.500
 fuel cell could actually have watches 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.120
 of great importance 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.810
 not surprisingly we have 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.900
 projects of great national importance that are their own support 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.880
 internal takeover of the linda del poggio of the 2015 industrial program are a 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.890
 support of the Italian industry I am afraid because Ansaldo CSL for it 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.419
 development of systems for stationary application 

00:02:11.419 --> 00:02:16.489
 in homes and 8 iron energy production 

00:02:17.029 --> 00:02:19.729
 who heat then cogeneration systems
