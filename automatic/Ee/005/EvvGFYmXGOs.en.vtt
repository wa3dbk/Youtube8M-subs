00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
collapsing to just one Universal kind of

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:18.769 
collapsing to just one Universal kind of
company<00:00:17.910> I<00:00:18.060> mean<00:00:18.300> they<00:00:18.359> might<00:00:18.510> keep<00:00:18.660> the

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779

company I mean they might keep the
Interscope<00:00:19.109> name<00:00:19.289> but<00:00:20.060> the<00:00:21.060> one<00:00:21.210> thing<00:00:21.390> I've

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
Interscope name but the one thing I've

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.189 
Interscope name but the one thing I've
learned<00:00:21.810> is<00:00:22.109> that<00:00:23.119> like<00:00:24.119> any<00:00:24.449> other<00:00:24.810> type<00:00:25.170> of

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
learned is that like any other type of

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.529 
learned is that like any other type of
art<00:00:25.590> it<00:00:26.160> evolves<00:00:26.730> and<00:00:26.880> so<00:00:27.240> if<00:00:27.359> you're<00:00:27.510> a

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
art it evolves and so if you're a

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.929 
art it evolves and so if you're a
business<00:00:27.810> that<00:00:28.140> supports<00:00:28.320> a<00:00:28.859> type<00:00:29.070> of<00:00:29.099> art<00:00:29.490> you

business that supports a type of art you
have<00:00:29.970> to<00:00:30.150> be<00:00:30.269> evolved<00:00:30.510> with<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.779> art<00:00:32.600> now<00:00:33.600> a

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
have to be evolved with the art now a

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.299 
have to be evolved with the art now a
lot<00:00:34.200> of<00:00:34.350> things<00:00:34.530> have<00:00:34.710> happened<00:00:34.739> that<00:00:35.160> have

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
lot of things have happened that have

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.350 
lot of things have happened that have
made<00:00:35.870> creating<00:00:36.870> art<00:00:37.200> a<00:00:37.700> lot<00:00:38.700> easier<00:00:39.149> with<00:00:39.270> the

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
made creating art a lot easier with the

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.290 
made creating art a lot easier with the
computer<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:39.930> it's<00:00:40.800> also<00:00:41.040> made<00:00:41.460> you<00:00:41.879> know<00:00:42.000> the

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
computer and it's also made you know the

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.690 
computer and it's also made you know the
distribution<00:00:42.629> of<00:00:43.020> art<00:00:43.170> a<00:00:43.290> lot<00:00:43.440> easier<00:00:43.860> so<00:00:44.129> at

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
distribution of art a lot easier so at

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.160 
distribution of art a lot easier so at
the<00:00:44.789> same<00:00:44.940> time<00:00:45.000> a<00:00:45.239> kid<00:00:45.629> can<00:00:45.780> go<00:00:45.899> out<00:00:46.020> and

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
the same time a kid can go out and

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.750 
the same time a kid can go out and
record<00:00:46.440> a<00:00:46.530> record<00:00:46.680> with<00:00:46.980> little<00:00:47.280> or<00:00:47.399> no<00:00:47.430> money

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
record a record with little or no money

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.090 
record a record with little or no money
on<00:00:48.090> their<00:00:48.390> laptop<00:00:48.840> but<00:00:49.530> then<00:00:49.710> someone<00:00:50.010> could

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
on their laptop but then someone could

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.000 
on their laptop but then someone could
steal<00:00:50.309> that<00:00:50.579> record<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.030> pass<00:00:51.210> it<00:00:51.390> around

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
steal that record and pass it around

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.420 
steal that record and pass it around
what<00:00:53.010> I<00:00:53.039> have<00:00:53.250> chosen<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:53.760> believe<00:00:53.910> is<00:00:54.420> that<00:00:55.430> if

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
what I have chosen to believe is that if

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.990 
what I have chosen to believe is that if
you<00:00:56.670> if<00:00:57.000> you<00:00:57.180> look<00:00:57.420> at<00:00:57.539> your<00:00:57.690> band<00:00:58.760> and<00:00:59.760> a

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.940 
all these elements and you can and I
always<00:01:24.600> believed<00:01:24.960> that<00:01:24.990> if<00:01:25.350> the<00:01:25.500> tools<00:01:25.740> are

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
always believed that if the tools are

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.460 
always believed that if the tools are
available<00:01:26.070> you<00:01:26.610> can<00:01:26.759> monetize<00:01:27.240> these<00:01:28.229> other

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
available you can monetize these other

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.080 
available you can monetize these other
elements<00:01:28.680> and<00:01:29.070> not<00:01:29.189> really<00:01:29.520> worry<00:01:29.790> about

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
elements and not really worry about

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.850 
elements and not really worry about
selling<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.570> record<00:01:30.900> itself<00:01:31.200> in<00:01:31.439> fact<00:01:31.680> I

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
selling the record itself in fact I

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.319 
selling the record itself in fact I
believe<00:01:32.070> that<00:01:32.220> you<00:01:32.610> should<00:01:32.759> take<00:01:32.909> down<00:01:33.119> every

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
believe that you should take down every

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.390 
believe that you should take down every
barrier<00:01:33.689> and<00:01:33.960> put<00:01:34.650> as<00:01:34.740> much<00:01:34.860> music<00:01:35.040> out<00:01:35.369> there

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
barrier and put as much music out there

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.080 
barrier and put as much music out there
for<00:01:35.729> free

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
for free

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.190 
for free
and<00:01:36.180> I<00:01:36.360> guess<00:01:36.509> in<00:01:36.659> a<00:01:36.720> way<00:01:36.750> it's<00:01:36.990> kind<00:01:37.020> of<00:01:37.140> like

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
and I guess in a way it's kind of like

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.660 
and I guess in a way it's kind of like
television<00:01:37.770> you<00:01:37.860> can<00:01:37.979> watch<00:01:38.130> television<00:01:38.460> for

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:21.540 
or what I just think it might take a

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:22.730 
or what I just think it might take a
little<00:04:21.630> bit<00:04:21.750> more<00:04:21.930> time<00:04:22.140> for<00:04:22.170> some<00:04:22.560> than

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740 
little bit more time for some than

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.540 
little bit more time for some than
others<00:04:23.480> so<00:04:24.480> I<00:04:24.510> think<00:04:24.630> that<00:04:24.990> a<00:04:25.020> band<00:04:25.440> to<00:04:26.130> try<00:04:26.400> and

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
others so I think that a band to try and

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:27.980 
others so I think that a band to try and
really<00:04:26.790> make<00:04:26.970> a<00:04:27.000> presence<00:04:27.450> known<00:04:27.660> as<00:04:27.840> you<00:04:27.960> have

to<00:04:28.350> really<00:04:28.620> think<00:04:28.800> about<00:04:28.920> how<00:04:29.160> to<00:04:29.190> captivate

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.640 
to really think about how to captivate
people<00:04:29.820> online<00:04:30.330> first<00:04:30.900> no<00:04:31.110> matter<00:04:31.290> what

00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:00.440 
phenomenon it's like Andy Warhol you
know<00:04:56.900> where<00:04:57.900> you<00:04:58.590> try<00:04:58.860> and<00:04:59.090> do<00:05:00.090> different

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:00.450 
know where you try and do different

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:02.090 
know where you try and do different
things<00:05:00.480> and<00:05:00.840> I<00:05:00.870> think<00:05:00.930> kids<00:05:01.230> that<00:05:01.440> study<00:05:01.800> art

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:02.100 
things and I think kids that study art

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.760 
things and I think kids that study art
projects<00:05:02.700> that<00:05:03.300> have<00:05:03.420> done<00:05:03.710> weird<00:05:04.710> things

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:04.770 
projects that have done weird things

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:07.310 
projects that have done weird things
that<00:05:05.400> really<00:05:05.670> become<00:05:06.090> these<00:05:06.300> phenomenons<00:05:06.990> is

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.320 
that really become these phenomenons is

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.110 
that really become these phenomenons is
I<00:05:07.560> think<00:05:07.770> how<00:05:07.830> you<00:05:07.860> apply<00:05:08.310> that<00:05:08.520> to<00:05:08.580> yourself

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:09.120 
I think how you apply that to yourself

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.580 
I think how you apply that to yourself
this<00:05:09.300> is<00:05:09.540> how<00:05:09.930> you<00:05:09.990> cut<00:05:10.230> through<00:05:10.350> the<00:05:10.410> noise

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:10.590 
this is how you cut through the noise

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:13.670 
this is how you cut through the noise
well<00:05:11.550> I<00:05:11.580> mean<00:05:12.050> obviously<00:05:13.050> good<00:05:13.200> songwriting

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 
well I mean obviously good songwriting

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.700 
well I mean obviously good songwriting
is<00:05:13.950> objective<00:05:14.490> um<00:05:15.200> but<00:05:16.200> if<00:05:16.350> you're<00:05:16.470> still

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:16.710 
is objective um but if you're still

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:18.710 
is objective um but if you're still
hearing<00:05:16.950> about<00:05:17.130> this<00:05:17.610> band<00:05:17.850> now<00:05:18.150> after<00:05:18.540> years

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:19.909 
hearing about this band now after years
years<00:05:19.020> and<00:05:19.200> years<00:05:19.320> chances<00:05:19.530> are<00:05:19.800> they're

00:05:19.909 --> 00:05:19.919 
years and years chances are they're

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:21.470 
years and years chances are they're
running<00:05:20.130> good<00:05:20.220> songs<00:05:20.520> you<00:05:21.090> don't<00:05:21.210> hear<00:05:21.450> about

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.409 
know but I always thought the true art
was<00:06:13.770> was<00:06:14.220> trying<00:06:14.700> to<00:06:14.790> break<00:06:15.060> through<00:06:15.240> the

was was trying to break through the
noise<00:06:15.600> and<00:06:15.660> getting<00:06:16.550> millions<00:06:17.550> of<00:06:17.700> people<00:06:18.000> to

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:18.150 
noise and getting millions of people to

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:21.440 
noise and getting millions of people to
notice<00:06:18.530> what<00:06:19.530> you<00:06:19.650> created<00:06:19.979> and<00:06:20.220> if<00:06:21.180> you<00:06:21.270> think

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:21.450 
notice what you created and if you think

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:23.330 
notice what you created and if you think
about<00:06:21.540> it<00:06:21.750> that<00:06:21.870> way<00:06:22.080> it<00:06:22.770> brings<00:06:23.010> a<00:06:23.100> different

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:23.340 
about it that way it brings a different

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:07.400 
that's probably what it's like being a

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:10.360 
that's probably what it's like being a
band<00:07:07.640> and<00:07:07.910> someone<00:07:08.420> tells<00:07:08.630> you<00:07:09.370> something

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:16.610 
and you should wonder why and then later

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:17.920 
and you should wonder why and then later
on<00:07:16.700> uh<00:07:16.820> someone<00:07:17.210> else<00:07:17.330> tells<00:07:17.570> you<00:07:17.660> the<00:07:17.780> same

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:19.940 
thing then you kind of start to know but

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:22.540 
thing then you kind of start to know but
you<00:07:20.060> should<00:07:20.270> constantly<00:07:20.660> look<00:07:21.140> to<00:07:21.410> see<00:07:22.280> what

00:07:22.540 --> 00:07:22.550 
you should constantly look to see what
