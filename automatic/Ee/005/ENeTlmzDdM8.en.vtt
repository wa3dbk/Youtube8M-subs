00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:13.639
 now I will ask you some questions that 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:16.529
 even a 4 year old could answer 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:19.670
 four simple questions about the 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:23.130
 take care of your teeth after this 

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:27.500
 we will understand all the errors that 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.500
 we commit with the care of our mouth 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.599
 what is going to stick to the teeth 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.220
 like bacterial plaque and that plate 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:36.980
 bacterial is what is going to injure the 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:39.410
 gums exactly while we've been 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.360
 sleeping that are 8 hours we have 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.640
 been sleeping the bacteria have 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.910
 been working hard hard hard 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:49.040
 producing acids those acids are going to 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.650
 be in our mouth and they will damage the 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:54.739
 enamel will erode it will 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:57.080
 become sensitive to the wind then it is 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:59.449
 very important that you when you 

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.160
 lift that perfect feeling we're 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:03.320
 all agree but you also have to 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.500
 do it immediately after eating 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.270
 and when we go to bed, let's say that the most 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.070
 important would be the first 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.410
 washed teeth in the day and then 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:15.369
 after each meal and at bedtime 

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:15.369
 very good perfect 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:21.710
 alicia like others we are going to see this 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.830
 Question 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:28.549
 which of the two actions is more 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:31.460
 important the washing of the mouth or the use 

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:34.700
 of good dental floss doctor this more 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:37.070
 important is brushing your teeth already 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.470
 that's what 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.000
 make that bacteria and that all the 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.340
 bacterial plaque that is between our 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.320
 teeth can be removed more easily 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:48.290
 The brushing technique is very 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:50.750
 important roughly 90% bar 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:53.630
 what is the use of dental floss is a 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:56.090
 brushing complement very well 

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:58.580
 perfect let's see what it says 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:01.580
 our screen the mouthwash or the 

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.840
 use of dental floss to see ahead the 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.450
 use of dental floss 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.429
 look at you and this is let's see the 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:11.940
 why the mouth wash is very 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:14.430
 important but nothing is going to replace the 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.750
 Flossing all has happened to us that 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.060
 that piece of meat has been left 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.760
 appointment and between the teeth and that not what 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.790
 we can get that out, it's just going to take away the 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:26.069
 floss or toothbrush or the 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.319
 mouth rinse so we should all 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:30.629
 use dental floss 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:34.290
 for patients who use bridges 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:36.720
 There is a special dental floss 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:40.190
 for bridges so no excuse all 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.180
 to use the perfect dental floss 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:45.299
 thank you very much everyone for our 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.670
 third question ready zacatecas hello 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:50.069
 how are you how about Friday what is your 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:53.760
 name Aaron Carol that such a carol we are going to 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:58.799
 see how much pasta should be put in the 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:03:02.280
 ajÃ¡ brush the size of a coin 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:06.269
 50 cents let's say the size of a 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.380
 pool or cover all the sows of the 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:10.560
 brush 

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:13.320
 good doctor really good I cover 

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.390
 all because I think that if I miss him 

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:18.300
 like a shelter is if you think that no 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:20.280
 I'm washing well that I loved your 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.950
 he asks because besides there we see ourselves 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:25.620
 involved a little in the 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:29.569
 television commercials that teach us 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:32.989
 to gender and toothpaste so happy 

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:35.269
 All the doctor please tell us what is 

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:39.109
 the answer has to be the size of 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:42.769
 a lentil and because this is very 

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:45.010
 important not to fill all the brush 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:47.120
 dental with all the toothpaste is 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:49.189
 only necessary to place the size 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.769
 from an ear three things 

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:54.170
 very important doctor when one places 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:57.319
 a lot of toothpaste what will produce 

00:03:54.170 --> 00:04:00.590
 is a lot of foam is going to fill with foam 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:02.629
 then if the mouth is filled with foam 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:06.439
 one is going to have the false sensation of 

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:08.989
 cleaning that is a 12 the pasta 

00:04:06.439 --> 00:04:12.319
 teeth have an abrasive component 

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:14.870
 to remove stains if you place 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:17.030
 a lot of toothpaste then what is going to 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:19.489
 do is scratch the teeth is going to 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:22.250
 publish a google book 

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:24.830
 and the third thing is that if you place a lot 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:27.070
 toothpaste will see a lot of fluoride but 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:29.830
 being able to produce a 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:31.630
 a flower we have a picture of you this 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.730
 it could be considered as a fluorosis 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:37.150
 because in reality also the more 

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:39.130
 soap there is more slips the brush and less 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.200
 clean there is another of the little things 

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:41.920
 then if we here brush 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.500
 teeth 

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:46.180
 what we do is place here a little 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:51.060
 of toothpaste and we're going to have 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:51.060
 exactly the amount we need 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:56.790
 thank you very much let's see our 

00:04:53.949 --> 00:04:56.790
 last question 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:05.270
 patrick for you how are you? 

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:09.199
 see how much you should change the 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:10.480
 toothbrush is very important a 

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:14.150
 month 

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:19.010
 three months nine months 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:20.540
 well I have my brush one year but it is 

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:24.650
 more frequent than we 

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:26.930
 we imagine but well I think three 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:28.700
 months that in three months we will see the 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:30.920
 correct answer doctor we have a month 

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:33.760
 three months or nine months nine months in 

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:33.760
 the correct answer 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:38.450
 in this study should last 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:40.370
 about three months as we 

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:42.080
 we realize that the brush should 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:44.389
 change it because the bristles are started 

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:46.370
 to open if the sows start to 

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:48.320
 open a month means that we 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:50.000
 we are using very strong the 

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:53.150
 patients for wanting to have teeth 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.950
 clean they pick up the brush and they do it 

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:57.710
 strong that what they are doing is 

00:05:54.950 --> 00:06:00.980
 sand your teeth so you know brush 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:04.340

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:07.820
 what are your teeth but also all 

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:10.010
 We have learned a little bit more 

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:11.570
 mistakes we have had in during our 

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:13.940
 answers but I'm sure with 

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:16.520
 these indications everyone will take care 

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:20.560
 much better your denture and prevent 

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:20.560
 other diseases thank you very much
