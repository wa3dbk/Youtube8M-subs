00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
large tree in the middle it appears to

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.380 
large tree in the middle it appears to
be<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.350> Christmas<00:01:22.650> tree<00:01:23.009> with<00:01:23.490> blue<00:01:23.790> light<00:01:24.060> and

be a Christmas tree with blue light and

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:25.880 
be a Christmas tree with blue light and
I<00:01:24.810> guess<00:01:24.990> you<00:01:25.110> could<00:01:25.140> say<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.530> blue<00:01:25.680> lights

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
I guess you could say the blue lights

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.530 
I guess you could say the blue lights
actually<00:01:26.130> referred<00:01:26.580> to<00:01:26.729> the<00:01:26.820> zombies<00:01:27.150> eyes<00:01:27.299> or

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
actually referred to the zombies eyes or

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.090 
actually referred to the zombies eyes or
maybe<00:01:27.780> it<00:01:27.900> could<00:01:28.080> link<00:01:28.290> up<00:01:28.380> to<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.650> Easter<00:01:29.009> Egg

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
maybe it could link up to the Easter Egg

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.590 
maybe it could link up to the Easter Egg
you<00:01:29.130> know<00:01:29.369> it<00:01:29.490> goes<00:01:29.670> blue<00:01:29.970> for<00:01:30.420> doing

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
you know it goes blue for doing

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.450 
you know it goes blue for doing
Richthofen<00:01:31.229> side<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:31.710> then<00:01:31.829> maybe<00:01:32.040> orange

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
Richthofen side and then maybe orange

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.160 
Richthofen side and then maybe orange
for<00:01:32.670> Max's<00:01:33.030> side<00:01:33.329> or<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:33.869> other<00:01:33.930> way<00:01:34.140> around

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
for Max's side or the other way around

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:36.260 
for Max's side or the other way around
again<00:01:34.710> I'm<00:01:34.890> not<00:01:34.950> really<00:01:35.430> too<00:01:35.729> sure<00:01:35.759> but<00:01:36.090> there
