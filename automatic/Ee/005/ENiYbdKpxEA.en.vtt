00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:06.029
 personal speech is starting one more tone 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.910
 right in the kitchen and today we will 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.550
 to teach you how to make this fish 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.490
 It's very tasty and it's very 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.590
 rewarding and crispy because it's made 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.380
 with this special flour called 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.080
 Panco taught us how to do the bank. 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.710
 our previous episode 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.869
 it's easy to do, just click on the link or 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:30.210
 the link I left in the description of the 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:33.480
 video and that is why this fish gets 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:36.450
 so crunchy then let's get this one 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.700
 This is the tilapia we are 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.489
 using tilapia is to do this 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:45.239
 fish breaded just get only tilapia 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:47.940
 unfreeze it and dry very well and 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:50.460
 people are going to start tempering each side 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.949
 with a little salt with a 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:56.160
 little pepper and also with lemon 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:59.129
 next to it at the time we are not tempering 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.949
 So much because we're going to have them all 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.239
 the layers of our fish soon 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.610
 you will understand 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.799
 so just temper a little bit each 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.240
 side because there are still people going to put 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:11.240
 more seasoning in this recipe 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.660
 Now we're going to start preparing the 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.000
 hit nothing of our fish then in a 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:22.100
 bowl you will put an egg 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.220
 You're going to mess this egg a little. 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:28.220
 fork is you can add a little 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:31.430
 milk keeps stirring a little more 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.920
 and now we're going to set up our line 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:36.140
 assembly here we will need 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.520
 a plate of a little wheat in 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.920
 who will need the egg that people 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.650
 just prepared and flour panko 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.960
 that we taught to do in the episode 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:46.880
 and now we will temper the 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.110
 each of these ingredients 

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.840
 so we'll put a little 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.970
 of salt in the three ingredients one 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.160
 a little bit of pepper and a little bit of 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:58.160
 lemon peel is why people 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.930
 It's not putting so much seasoning on our 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.900
 fish and that is why we are 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:06.140
 a little bit each part so that the 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:08.750
 people have taste in every single 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:12.020
 all parts of our fish and then 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:14.480
 temperature is fine just move 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:18.080
 each of these ingredients because now 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:20.769
 We are already prepared to deceive the 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.769
 our fish 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:28.220
 then you will get each fillet of the swat 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:31.010
 and will start to pass in the wheat is 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:34.970
 just go from both sides 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:38.310
 [Music] 

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:42.660
 you take some of the excess from your 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:45.420
 wheat now you go to egg dips 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.100
 your new fish the way you do. 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:53.160
 is seeing 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:53.160
 [Music] 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:02.720
 and after the egg just take it to the flour 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.530
 panko and cheat everything very well of the two 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.810
 sides 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.990
 you can then shake hands with 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:13.270
 few to be very well bred not 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:13.270
 need to save can put enough 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:25.110
 You will do this whole process with 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:29.220
 every filet you have and then again 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:33.300
 just start with the flour and then the egg 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:37.190
 and then the bank and its believers already 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:37.190
 are ready to fry 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.959
 now in a frying pan you will put the 

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:46.099
 your oil does not need to put oil 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:47.959
 very high 

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:50.420
 You see, it 's a little oil. 

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:53.269
 When you're hot, you can 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:56.720
 put your fish and attention to 

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:59.209
 this tip now the bank fries much more 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:03.170
 faster than standard thread flour 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:06.379
 so it's important that you use an oil 

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:08.900
 average a medium fire there for that recipe 

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:11.450
 because otherwise you will burn your 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:14.720
 bank very fast and your fish will 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:17.539
 become raw then puts on the medium heat 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:20.000
 so there is no mistake for you to have notion 

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:22.880
 we stayed and each side for more or 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.460
 one minute and a half less then much more 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:28.580
 faster than the flour 

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:31.460
 so on average fire it's just leave more or 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:36.110
 one minute and a minute and a half of each 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:40.070
 side and your empanada tilapia is already 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:43.010
 ready now just take your fish 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:46.160
 put a paper towel on a plate 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:50.740
 so you pull out very well and he and you 

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:53.660
 You can already serve your there pint nava 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:56.570
 Like I said, this recipe gets very 

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:58.789
 delicious this is super crispy 

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:00.349
 You can put a lemon teaching 

00:04:58.789 --> 00:05:02.810
 to make it even better 

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:05.960
 I think the people there will like it. 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:08.289
 quite is quite different from the odd 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:12.770
 common that you are accustomed to 

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:14.350
 if you liked favorite short video and 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:19.449
 until the next episode 

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:19.449
