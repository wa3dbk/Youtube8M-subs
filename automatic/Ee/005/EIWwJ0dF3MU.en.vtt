00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 hello everyone as usual 

00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:05.640
 This video follows the 59 seconds 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.980
 who are here so to first see 

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.210
 the 59 seconds and then come back here I 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.759
 I will not repeat everything that is said 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.500
 in the 59 seconds and especially the video 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.849
 who lives who is now that I that I 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.710
 would be for now going to be with 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.600
 spoilers while the 59 seconds and 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.960
 always without spoiler finally almost 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.820
 always then very simply I was 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.840
 not even have to do one and the rest 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.090
 because there are not so many 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:28.140
 things to say more than what I knew 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.910
 to say in 59 seconds 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.610
 there are even moments to writing I 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.750
 felt it was difficult to fill 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.309
 the second sacres 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:38.129
 not because there is little to 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.960
 say in the film is true is the 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:41.910
 pretty generic enough themes very 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.870
 interesting very well done but it's 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.300
 wide enough 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.559
 so let's see again a little bit already 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.750
 little note is that before inside out 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:54.449
 there was down there so that's a short 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.010
 footage of pixar that was nice 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:59.219
 no more I have not much to say 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:02.190
 who the music is serene not really 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:05.189
 it's great to think about the music of 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.930
 over the rainbow done by the big there 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.510
 I do not know what his name is 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.729
 finally that obviously resumed 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.220
 magician back to back and well do not need 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:17.130
 to put myself in the comments but 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:19.680
 here is the music and youtube it was 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.030
 nice I saw some people for 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:24.090
 which it worked well this little 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.650
 love story of two volcanoes but 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.799
 Here there is not much we say that 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.299
 nice insider the title i'm coming back 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.119
 on it even if I say no it's 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.400
 when a second I find that vice and 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.740
 again this is a title that 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.750
 looses all the subtlety of the title 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.799
 original there was already the case 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.649
 with people among others or flat to him 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.880
 is in there high is a lot less of 

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:51.210
 interpretation of similar subtlety 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.399
 inside out that's where many of you 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.049
 can take it in many ways 

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:56.460
 while vice versa not too much 

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.899
 even if she got a little bit a little 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.420
 detail but I think that's why 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.430
 pity that French titles spoil a 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.439
 little bit the subtlety of the title of this 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.640
 kind of movie the trailer of inside of 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.020
 tea the trailer or 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.429
 see what's going on in the heads of 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.840
 parents should be aware that it is some 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.440
 something that almost never happens 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.810
 in the film that's it happens two 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.300
 times in all that's pretty much everything and 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.640
 introspective to settle everything goes 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.800
 in riley's head has very very little of 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.720
 things close in a sense it may be 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.310
 the funniest scene but when I 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.570
 see the movie angels when I arrived 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:29.700
 to this fucking lordship it's a shame 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:32.340
 that happened to more often because 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.410
 that it was super funny this moment 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:35.730
 there but when we reach the end I get 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.000
 realized that no would be removed 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:41.130
 really personification 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.480
 the attachment that had been told to to 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.700
 character to settle is what happens 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:46.440
 at the top she is very very funny 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.900
 and honestly I will pass very quickly 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.280
 in the end because that's the stuff I 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.260
 want to talk most all 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.630
 environments discovered in the film 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.280
 are super imaginative 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.150
 luckily for something that's going on 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.560
 in the head of someone who is 

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.420
 a lot of imagination 

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.120
 it's very very well fucked I wanted 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.170
 that graphically I always have 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.890
 bad to hang I already said 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.180
 previously 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.100
 I still have trouble hanging on 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.959
 images synthesis is well done it's 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:11.700
 just that it does not 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:14.040
 it does not bluff me because I know 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.269
 no I have a detachment with always 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.380
 the movies in ten interesting matches I 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:17.579
 prefers the nieste much better 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.230
 traditional animation 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:20.790
 I already said them and I repeat it good 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.769
 it's a matter of personal taste 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.110
 but it's still well done 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:26.489
 environments are very very cool 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:27.870
 so here I go in the 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:30.660
 spoilers not heard that this video is 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.940
 with spoiler the death of big bang 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:37.160
 I must confess that moman it has me a little 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:39.510
 little touched the fold of dead bank 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.450
 so yes the death of big man but I 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.489
 find it works well and it's mega 

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:48.360
 important it's really the first step 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:50.070
 abandonment of abandoned childhood his 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:53.610
 imaginary friend of when we were kids 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:55.560
 that disappears so that for that 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.390
 emotions evolved good there on the course 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.040
 laid out basically nothing to say because 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:02.430
 that it is not critical 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:04.890
 the end is not critical but you have to 

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:07.360
 take things truck 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:10.720
 the end is not critical but you have to 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.980
 take things a little bit 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.030
 still be a subtle minimum he 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.900
 do not take things first 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:19.780
 degree but how emotions 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.970
 evolving we realize that it takes 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.910
 have a little bit of sadness in her 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:26.350
 life to have joy 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.690
 things are more complicated in 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:31.389
 growing up continues child did not you 

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:33.760
 have only extreme emotions is that 

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:36.370
 of joy or that of sadness and and 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:38.500
 indeed comes at the end of two soldiers 

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:41.380
 August we realize that in fact there 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:45.729
 needs a mix of emotions to create the 

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:49.419
 complexity of the adult human being it's 

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:52.000
 really that the theme and the inside 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:53.380
 who evolve crises that brings 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.389
 obviously an evolution of the characters 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:58.300
 in his cell the b to ba of the scenario 

00:04:55.389 --> 00:04:59.919
 it's really well done because 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:02.380
 it's a movie that kids can 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:03.580
 love for what they see but it's 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:06.940
 a film that adults can love 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:08.289
 for what it is, because there is 

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.070
 several levels of reading there are two 

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:10.300
 three levels of reading 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:12.130
 in this movie and I find that it was 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.870
 very very well done already you're bored 

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:16.180
 you're not bored it's a movie 

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:17.650
 annoying at all you remained that the 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.270
 time in the stuff you are and evolve and 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:22.389
 it's an inner adventure as I 

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:23.440
 did the gag with the with the movie that 

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:25.210
 is called a future internally that 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:26.260
 absolutely nothing to do but it's a 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:29.650
 inner adventure 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:32.050
 it's one is taking emotions to the 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:35.229
 the strictest sense of the term c here 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:38.050
 it's the evolution of emotions across 

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:39.370
 here in this case an adventure in 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:42.280
 character an adventure of emotions 

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:43.599
 finally here it is beautiful game in fact I am 

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.830
 sense a little stupid to explain that 

00:05:43.599 --> 00:05:46.690
 because everyone has understood 

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:48.580
 after seeing it except maybe the very 

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:52.090
 young but it's I'm I was 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:54.610
 I was really pleasantly surprised 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:56.409
 surprised because 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:59.800
 I was not expecting much 

00:05:56.409 --> 00:06:02.020
 thing of this movie but I found gimat 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:04.990
 touched me a lot I found he 

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:07.120
 was very interesting these islands and he 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:09.159
 Here it is beautiful there generally 

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:11.979
 that's what I want to say it's 

00:06:09.159 --> 00:06:14.620
 he is he is beautiful that's good it was 

00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:18.789
 not much more to say like I 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:22.469
 was saying in this dancer is this video 

00:06:18.789 --> 00:06:25.030
 and the rest but good added running 

00:06:22.469 --> 00:06:26.319
 I almost hesitated to make a UFO 

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:27.819
 cinema because he would go much more 

00:06:26.319 --> 00:06:30.639
 fast you do not count but king kong 

00:06:27.819 --> 00:06:32.319
 evolved I specify besides I am 

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:35.340
 let's clarify as long as I speak the 

00:06:32.319 --> 00:06:38.349
 from the back of the king kong fitting that 

00:06:35.340 --> 00:06:40.029
 I'm waiting for a new green fund because 

00:06:38.349 --> 00:06:42.370
 that I need to shoot scenes 

00:06:40.029 --> 00:06:45.039
 on green background or the intro is the one that 

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:46.270
 I'm really rotten so I have 

00:06:45.039 --> 00:06:48.580
 ordered a new one but I have not them 

00:06:46.270 --> 00:06:50.319
 before at least two weeks or more 

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:52.120
 so do not expect them to 

00:06:50.319 --> 00:06:53.830
 come out before that even though obviously I 

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:56.379
 already going forward on the rest I'm going 

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:57.939
 try to turn the rest I have a 

00:06:56.379 --> 00:07:00.159
 little more time this week and 

00:06:57.939 --> 00:07:01.629
 bronze to eat job work job 

00:07:00.159 --> 00:07:03.940
 I have a lot of work and I have 

00:07:01.629 --> 00:07:05.819
 really no time to devote myself 

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:08.229
 to videos like game I'd like to do it 

00:07:05.819 --> 00:07:10.870
 but anyway whatever it is 

00:07:08.229 --> 00:07:12.639
 so went to see despite I was hoping 

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:14.469
 even if you watch this video you have 

00:07:12.639 --> 00:07:16.719
 been robbed we do not care we do not care 

00:07:14.469 --> 00:07:19.620
 does not really have a story to 

00:07:16.719 --> 00:07:21.729
 spoiled from yesteryears inside out 

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:23.919
 cc this is a very beautiful movie I you 

00:07:21.729 --> 00:07:25.029
 advise to go and see with them it's 

00:07:23.919 --> 00:07:27.550
 really a movie for everyone 

00:07:25.029 --> 00:07:28.180
 it's for the whole family the big ones
