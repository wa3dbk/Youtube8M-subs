in this exercise in the exercise there

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.080 
in this exercise in the exercise there
are<00:01:15.990> a<00:01:16.049> lot<00:01:16.229> of<00:01:16.259> singles<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:17.100> doubles<00:01:17.729> that<00:01:17.939> go

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
are a lot of singles and doubles that go

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.719 
are a lot of singles and doubles that go
back<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:18.540> forth<00:01:18.840> between<00:01:19.020> them<00:01:19.560> and<00:01:19.950> it's<00:01:20.580> up

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
back and forth between them and it's up

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.999 
back and forth between them and it's up
to<00:01:20.759> you<00:01:21.030> as<00:01:21.210> a<00:01:21.509> player<00:01:21.780> to<00:01:22.290> figure<00:01:22.560> out<00:01:22.740> how

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
to you as a player to figure out how

to you as a player to figure out how
you're<00:01:23.280> going<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.670> transition<00:01:24.210> your

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
you're going to transition your

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.320 
you're going to transition your
technique<00:01:25.320> between<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:25.979> two<00:01:26.159> some<00:01:27.060> people

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
technique between the two some people

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.399 
technique between the two some people
think<00:01:27.570> that<00:01:27.630> there<00:01:27.869> shouldn't<00:01:28.140> be<00:01:28.290> a

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
think that there shouldn't be a

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.100 
think that there shouldn't be a
transition<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:29.340> others<00:01:30.240> do<00:01:30.630> different

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
transition and others do different

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.929 
transition and others do different
things<00:01:31.140> with<00:01:31.409> their<00:01:31.650> Faulk<00:01:31.920> room<00:01:32.100> between<00:01:32.490> the

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
things with their Faulk room between the

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.120 
things with their Faulk room between the
singles<00:01:33.270> and<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:33.479> doubles<00:01:34.009> something<00:01:35.009> that

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
singles and the doubles something that

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.149 
singles and the doubles something that
we<00:01:35.250> can<00:01:35.400> all<00:01:35.610> agree<00:01:35.790> on<00:01:36.030> I<00:01:36.509> think<00:01:36.570> is<00:01:37.049> that<00:01:37.159> your

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
we can all agree on I think is that your

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.999 
we can all agree on I think is that your
finger<00:01:38.579> shouldn't<00:01:39.030> fly<00:01:39.329> off<00:01:39.630> in<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.560> major<00:01:40.799> way

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
finger shouldn't fly off in a major way

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.730 
finger shouldn't fly off in a major way
in<00:01:41.220> any<00:01:41.640> one<00:01:41.970> point<00:01:42.270> in<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.689> exercise<00:01:43.170> because

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
in any one point in the exercise because

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.920 
in any one point in the exercise because
it<00:01:43.890> makes<00:01:44.100> it<00:01:44.280> very<00:01:44.399> difficult<00:01:44.579> to<00:01:45.149> transition

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
it makes it very difficult to transition

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.469 
it makes it very difficult to transition
so<00:01:46.799> if<00:01:46.920> you<00:01:47.040> do<00:01:47.189> shift<00:01:47.460> your<00:01:47.670> fulcrum<00:01:48.090> make

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
so if you do shift your fulcrum make

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:49.969 
so if you do shift your fulcrum make
sure<00:01:48.659> that<00:01:48.869> your<00:01:48.990> fingers<00:01:49.200> aren't<00:01:49.649> doing

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
sure that your fingers aren't doing

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:52.039 
sure that your fingers aren't doing
weird<00:01:50.220> things<00:01:50.610> back<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:51.240> forth<00:01:51.509> between<00:01:51.689> the

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
weird things back and forth between the

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.319 
weird things back and forth between the
two<00:01:52.229> that<00:01:53.009> will<00:01:53.220> make<00:01:53.369> it<00:01:53.520> more<00:01:53.729> difficult<00:01:53.939> for

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
two that will make it more difficult for

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.899 
two that will make it more difficult for
you<00:01:54.659> to<00:01:54.960> achieve<00:01:55.079> it<00:01:55.530> at<00:01:55.710> different<00:01:56.159> dynamics

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
you to achieve it at different dynamics

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.310 
you to achieve it at different dynamics
and<00:01:57.149> different<00:01:57.420> speeds<00:01:59.479> hi<00:02:00.479> I'm<00:02:00.780> Danny<00:02:01.049> wells

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
and different speeds hi I'm Danny wells

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.590 
and different speeds hi I'm Danny wells
one<00:02:02.159> concept<00:02:02.520> that<00:02:02.670> we<00:02:02.820> use<00:02:02.850> in<00:02:03.119> this<00:02:03.270> exercise

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
one concept that we use in this exercise

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.780 
one concept that we use in this exercise
is<00:02:04.049> to<00:02:04.229> play<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.469> transition<00:02:05.100> between<00:02:05.280> Devils

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
is to play the transition between Devils

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.130 
is to play the transition between Devils
and<00:02:05.909> singles<00:02:06.210> as<00:02:06.360> seamlessly<00:02:06.899> as<00:02:06.990> possible

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
and singles as seamlessly as possible

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.240 
and singles as seamlessly as possible
and<00:02:07.799> sound<00:02:08.009> and<00:02:08.129> velocity

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
and sound and velocity

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:11.280 
and sound and velocity
it<00:02:09.789> is<00:02:09.970> very<00:02:10.149> typical<00:02:10.360> for<00:02:10.810> singles<00:02:11.140> and

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:11.290 
it is very typical for singles and

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:12.630 
it is very typical for singles and
doubles<00:02:11.560> to<00:02:11.710> sound<00:02:11.950> different<00:02:12.130> as<00:02:12.430> they<00:02:12.550> are

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:12.640 
doubles to sound different as they are

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.060 
doubles to sound different as they are
two<00:02:12.850> different<00:02:13.060> rhythms<00:02:13.530> the<00:02:14.530> challenge<00:02:14.920> here

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
two different rhythms the challenge here

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:16.800 
two different rhythms the challenge here
is<00:02:15.100> to<00:02:15.340> learn<00:02:15.520> the<00:02:15.730> ability<00:02:16.090> to<00:02:16.120> control<00:02:16.630> the

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
is to learn the ability to control the

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.330 
is to learn the ability to control the
sound<00:02:17.050> of<00:02:17.230> the<00:02:17.320> point<00:02:17.560> where<00:02:17.860> the<00:02:18.010> difference

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
sound of the point where the difference

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.160 
sound of the point where the difference
between<00:02:18.490> doubles<00:02:18.970> and<00:02:19.090> singles<00:02:19.150> is<00:02:19.600> virtually

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
between doubles and singles is virtually

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.310 
between doubles and singles is virtually
unheard<00:02:20.940> by<00:02:21.940> doing<00:02:22.240> this<00:02:22.390> you<00:02:22.660> are<00:02:22.690> elevating

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
unheard by doing this you are elevating

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.050 
unheard by doing this you are elevating
your<00:02:23.440> ability<00:02:23.830> to<00:02:23.860> control<00:02:24.340> your<00:02:24.520> sound<00:02:24.700> a

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
your ability to control your sound a

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.540 
your ability to control your sound a
good<00:02:25.810> way<00:02:25.959> to<00:02:26.020> test<00:02:26.290> your<00:02:26.410> progress<00:02:26.740> is<00:02:27.310> to

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
good way to test your progress is to

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:28.980 
good way to test your progress is to
have<00:02:27.670> a<00:02:27.700> friend<00:02:28.000> listen<00:02:28.180> to<00:02:28.390> you<00:02:28.480> play<00:02:28.510> doubles
