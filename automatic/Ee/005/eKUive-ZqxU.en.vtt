one<00:04:47.140> what's<00:04:48.140> great<00:04:48.320> about<00:04:48.350> the<00:04:48.590> Dragonfly<00:04:49.130> is

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370 
one what's great about the Dragonfly is

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:50.890 
one what's great about the Dragonfly is
that<00:04:49.610> you<00:04:49.730> can<00:04:49.880> use<00:04:50.000> several<00:04:50.270> different<00:04:50.690> types

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:50.900 
that you can use several different types

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.480 
that you can use several different types
of<00:04:51.140> fuel<00:04:51.350> and<00:04:53.380> when<00:04:54.380> you're<00:04:54.530> backpacking<00:04:54.770> and

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:55.490 
of fuel and when you're backpacking and

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:57.250 
of fuel and when you're backpacking and
you're<00:04:55.730> going<00:04:56.030> for<00:04:56.240> multiple<00:04:56.600> days<00:04:56.780> if<00:04:57.110> you

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:57.260 
you're going for multiple days if you

00:04:57.260 --> 00:05:00.430 
you're going for multiple days if you
have<00:04:57.500> to<00:04:57.710> you<00:04:58.520> know<00:04:58.610> siphon<00:04:59.060> gasoline<00:04:59.660> or

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:00.440 
have to you know siphon gasoline or

diesel or kerosene or you know whatever
it<00:05:03.980> can<00:05:04.160> handle<00:05:04.340> it<00:05:05.590> the<00:05:06.590> Dragonfly<00:05:06.950> is<00:05:07.720> also

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:08.720 
it can handle it the Dragonfly is also

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.740 
it can handle it the Dragonfly is also
great<00:05:09.020> because<00:05:09.410> it<00:05:09.770> has<00:05:09.860> a<00:05:09.919> look<00:05:10.250> nice<00:05:10.660> in<00:05:11.660> a

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:11.750 
great because it has a look nice in a

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:17.170 
great because it has a look nice in a
wide<00:05:12.020> base<00:05:12.640> where<00:05:13.640> is<00:05:13.850> the<00:05:14.780> smaller<00:05:15.229> one<00:05:16.180> you

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:17.180 
wide base where is the smaller one you

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.420 
wide base where is the smaller one you
know<00:05:17.300> having<00:05:17.630> a<00:05:17.720> whole<00:05:18.560> pan<00:05:18.800> on<00:05:18.950> there<00:05:19.070> it'll

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:19.430 
know having a whole pan on there it'll

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:21.130 
know having a whole pan on there it'll
hold<00:05:19.669> but<00:05:20.300> you<00:05:20.390> have<00:05:20.479> to<00:05:20.600> just<00:05:20.780> make<00:05:20.840> sure<00:05:21.110> that

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:21.140 
hold but you have to just make sure that

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:24.730 
hold but you have to just make sure that
it's<00:05:21.410> on<00:05:21.530> a<00:05:21.560> solid<00:05:21.919> surface<00:05:23.560> any<00:05:24.560> other

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:24.740 
it's on a solid surface any other

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.040 
it's on a solid surface any other
downside<00:05:25.220> to<00:05:25.460> the<00:05:25.660> dragonfly<00:05:26.660> is<00:05:26.720> that

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:27.050 
downside to the dragonfly is that

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:28.350 
downside to the dragonfly is that
there's<00:05:27.410> no<00:05:27.560> igniter

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:28.360 
there's no igniter

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.260 
there's no igniter
have<00:05:28.509> to<00:05:28.659> have<00:05:28.810> some<00:05:28.990> matches<00:05:29.939> you<00:05:30.939> know<00:05:30.969> with

you to get that guy going this thing can
get<00:05:34.479> pretty<00:05:34.750> dirty<00:05:34.990> and<00:05:35.639> honestly<00:05:36.639> it's<00:05:36.789> not

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:37.060 
get pretty dirty and honestly it's not

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:42.600

as<00:05:37.330> easy<00:05:37.900> to<00:05:38.020> get<00:05:38.379> going<00:05:38.650> as<00:05:40.379> as<00:05:41.580> these<00:05:42.580> a

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:42.610 
as easy to get going as as these a

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:50.680 
as easy to get going as as these a
little<00:05:43.180> isobutane<00:05:43.780> stoves

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:50.690 

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:53.950 

so<00:05:51.260> right<00:05:51.410> now<00:05:51.590> we're<00:05:51.740> at<00:05:51.800> two<00:05:52.040> minutes<00:05:52.960> now

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:53.960 
so right now we're at two minutes now

so right now we're at two minutes now
the<00:05:54.020> website<00:05:54.290> says<00:05:54.770> that<00:05:54.800> it<00:05:55.040> takes

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:55.250 
the website says that it takes

00:05:55.250 --> 00:06:00.160 
the website says that it takes
approximately<00:05:57.340> what<00:05:58.340> three<00:05:58.670> minutes<00:05:59.050> to<00:06:00.050> get

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:00.170 
approximately what three minutes to get

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:05.640 
approximately what three minutes to get
boiling

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:05.650 

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:07.800 

and<00:06:05.889> already<00:06:06.639> I'm<00:06:06.880> starting<00:06:07.270> to<00:06:07.300> see<00:06:07.510> just<00:06:07.540> the

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:07.810 
and already I'm starting to see just the

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:14.100 
and already I'm starting to see just the
world<00:06:08.020> none<00:06:08.260> of<00:06:08.380> heat<00:06:08.560> coming<00:06:08.889> off<00:06:08.979> that

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:14.110 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:17.060 

steam

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:17.070

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:33.180 
it would probably worth the wait and the

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:35.540 
it would probably worth the wait and the
hassle<00:06:33.360> of<00:06:33.510> taking<00:06:33.900> this<00:06:34.400> especially<00:06:35.400> if<00:06:35.460> it

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:35.550 
hassle of taking this especially if it

00:06:35.550 --> 00:06:38.680 
hassle of taking this especially if it
was<00:06:35.670> a<00:06:35.700> bigger<00:06:35.940> group

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:38.690
