in<00:00:04.120> an<00:00:04.210> earlier<00:00:04.630> video<00:00:04.779> we<00:00:05.229> talked<00:00:05.529> about

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:05.680 
in an earlier video we talked about

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.470 
in an earlier video we talked about
putting<00:00:06.160> deep<00:00:06.609> joists<00:00:07.559> in<00:00:08.559> for<00:00:09.099> yours

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:10.480 
putting deep joists in for yours

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:13.620 
putting deep joists in for yours
for<00:00:10.900> the<00:00:10.990> floor<00:00:11.230> for<00:00:11.590> a<00:00:11.650> second<00:00:12.010> story<00:00:12.280> and<00:00:12.630> a

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:13.630 
for the floor for a second story and a

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:15.210 
for the floor for a second story and a
briefly<00:00:13.900> talked<00:00:14.170> about<00:00:14.260> using<00:00:14.559> herringbone

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:15.220 
briefly talked about using herringbone

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:17.910 
briefly talked about using herringbone
strutting<00:00:15.760> to<00:00:16.689> stop<00:00:17.260> the<00:00:17.439> joists<00:00:17.650> from

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:17.920 
strutting to stop the joists from

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.090 
strutting to stop the joists from
twisting<00:00:18.910> or<00:00:19.030> rolling<00:00:19.270> over<00:00:19.619> so<00:00:20.619> in<00:00:21.010> this

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:21.100 
twisting or rolling over so in this

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.859 
twisting or rolling over so in this
video<00:00:21.280> I<00:00:21.699> just<00:00:22.000> want<00:00:22.180> to<00:00:22.240> show<00:00:22.510> you<00:00:22.570> how<00:00:22.810> you

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:22.869 
video I just want to show you how you

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:26.189 
video I just want to show you how you
can<00:00:23.230> quickly<00:00:24.150> work<00:00:25.150> out<00:00:25.330> what<00:00:25.539> lengths<00:00:25.930> they

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:26.199 
can quickly work out what lengths they

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:29.040 
can quickly work out what lengths they
need<00:00:26.410> to<00:00:26.529> be<00:00:26.710> and<00:00:27.070> work<00:00:27.310> out<00:00:27.490> the<00:00:27.670> angle<00:00:28.050> that

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:29.050 
need to be and work out the angle that

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.950 
need to be and work out the angle that
you<00:00:29.199> actually<00:00:29.320> need<00:00:29.619> to<00:00:29.830> cut<00:00:30.010> them<00:00:30.220> so<00:00:30.960> that

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:31.960 
you actually need to cut them so that

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.840 
you actually need to cut them so that
it's<00:00:32.710> a<00:00:32.980> little<00:00:33.100> bit<00:00:33.190> quicker<00:00:33.489> than<00:00:33.579> just

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:33.850 
it's a little bit quicker than just

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.840 
it's a little bit quicker than just
trying<00:00:34.030> to<00:00:34.120> measure<00:00:34.300> it<00:00:34.510> and<00:00:34.720> sort<00:00:35.140> of<00:00:35.230> guess

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
trying to measure it and sort of guess

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.049 
trying to measure it and sort of guess
so<00:00:36.850> obviously<00:00:38.430> hopefully<00:00:39.430> when<00:00:39.640> you<00:00:39.670> set<00:00:40.030> your

00:00:40.049 --> 00:00:40.059 
so obviously hopefully when you set your

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:41.670 
so obviously hopefully when you set your
joists<00:00:40.360> out<00:00:40.630> you've<00:00:40.809> got<00:00:40.960> them<00:00:41.140> on<00:00:41.410> the

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:41.680 
joists out you've got them on the

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.819 
joists out you've got them on the
majority<00:00:42.219> of<00:00:42.340> them<00:00:42.550> the<00:00:43.300> same<00:00:43.630> spacing<00:00:44.469> apart

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:44.829 
majority of them the same spacing apart

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:47.490 
majority of them the same spacing apart
but<00:00:45.670> inevitably<00:00:46.480> you'll<00:00:46.780> end<00:00:46.960> up<00:00:47.079> with<00:00:47.260> some

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:47.500 
but inevitably you'll end up with some

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.889 
but inevitably you'll end up with some
different<00:00:48.329> spacings<00:00:49.329> for<00:00:49.390> your<00:00:49.629> joists<00:00:49.870> so

00:00:49.889 --> 00:00:49.899 
different spacings for your joists so

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:52.709 
different spacings for your joists so
this<00:00:50.379> process<00:00:50.850> would<00:00:51.850> need<00:00:52.120> to<00:00:52.239> be<00:00:52.360> repeated

00:00:52.709 --> 00:00:52.719 
this process would need to be repeated

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:57.479 
this process would need to be repeated
for<00:00:53.079> every<00:00:53.309> spacing<00:00:54.309> that<00:00:55.239> you<00:00:55.300> have<00:00:56.340> so<00:00:57.340> what

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:57.489 
for every spacing that you have so what

00:00:57.489 --> 00:00:59.160 
for every spacing that you have so what
you<00:00:57.610> do<00:00:57.789> is<00:00:57.969> take<00:00:58.239> a<00:00:58.270> piece<00:00:58.660> of<00:00:58.719> your<00:00:58.930> joist

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
you do is take a piece of your joist

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.040 
you do is take a piece of your joist
material<00:00:59.800> well<00:01:00.039> you<00:01:00.129> can<00:01:00.250> just<00:01:00.399> measure<00:01:00.670> it

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
material well you can just measure it

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:05.940 
material well you can just measure it
mark<00:01:02.050> that<00:01:02.260> onto<00:01:02.620> joists<00:01:04.500> like<00:01:05.500> that's<00:01:05.710> such

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:05.950 
mark that onto joists like that's such

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:11.219 
mark that onto joists like that's such
and<00:01:06.280> then<00:01:07.289> we<00:01:08.289> need<00:01:08.469> to<00:01:08.619> deduct<00:01:10.229> generally

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:11.229 
and then we need to deduct generally

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:14.580 
and then we need to deduct generally
about<00:01:11.409> 12<00:01:11.889> mil<00:01:12.100> on<00:01:12.130> each<00:01:12.369> edge<00:01:12.810> just<00:01:13.810> so<00:01:14.469> we

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
about 12 mil on each edge just so we

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.949 
about 12 mil on each edge just so we
don't<00:01:14.799> have<00:01:14.979> any<00:01:15.369> chance<00:01:15.729> of<00:01:16.090> the<00:01:16.420> struts

00:01:16.949 --> 00:01:16.959 
don't have any chance of the struts

00:01:16.959 --> 00:01:20.309 
don't have any chance of the struts
sticking<00:01:17.619> up<00:01:17.740> above<00:01:17.889> our<00:01:18.479> joists<00:01:19.479> so<00:01:19.749> we'll

00:01:20.309 --> 00:01:20.319 
sticking up above our joists so we'll

00:01:20.319 --> 00:01:24.059 
sticking up above our joists so we'll
put<00:01:20.799> a<00:01:20.829> reduction<00:01:21.369> in<00:01:21.569> 12<00:01:22.569> min<00:01:22.719> H<00:01:22.959> 24<00:01:23.529> 4<00:01:23.859> mil

00:01:24.059 --> 00:01:24.069 
put a reduction in 12 min H 24 4 mil

00:01:24.069 --> 00:01:27.779 
put a reduction in 12 min H 24 4 mil
overall<00:01:24.719> so<00:01:25.719> that<00:01:26.020> becomes<00:01:26.319> the<00:01:26.770> new<00:01:27.130> width<00:01:27.549> of

00:01:27.779 --> 00:01:27.789 
overall so that becomes the new width of

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:30.660 
overall so that becomes the new width of
al<00:01:28.649> or<00:01:29.649> the<00:01:29.829> width<00:01:30.009> of<00:01:30.130> our<00:01:30.219> herringbone

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
al or the width of our herringbone

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.059 
al or the width of our herringbone
strutting<00:01:31.060> you<00:01:31.149> for<00:01:31.299> life<00:01:31.799> once<00:01:32.799> we<00:01:32.919> know<00:01:33.039> that

00:01:33.059 --> 00:01:33.069 
strutting you for life once we know that

00:01:33.069 --> 00:01:35.669 
strutting you for life once we know that
then<00:01:33.579> it's<00:01:33.999> a<00:01:34.149> really<00:01:34.539> simple<00:01:34.719> process<00:01:35.109> all<00:01:35.560> we

00:01:35.669 --> 00:01:35.679 
then it's a really simple process all we

00:01:35.679 --> 00:01:38.429 
then it's a really simple process all we
do<00:01:35.859> is<00:01:35.979> just<00:01:36.219> sit<00:01:36.579> the<00:01:37.569> piece<00:01:38.049> of<00:01:38.200> herringbone

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:38.439 
do is just sit the piece of herringbone

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:41.429 
do is just sit the piece of herringbone
shredding<00:01:39.039> so<00:01:39.999> that<00:01:40.240> this<00:01:40.389> side<00:01:40.719> is<00:01:41.020> on<00:01:41.229> the

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:41.439 
shredding so that this side is on the

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:44.879 
shredding so that this side is on the
bottom<00:01:41.740> and<00:01:42.719> the<00:01:43.719> other<00:01:43.749> side<00:01:44.380> is<00:01:44.859> just

00:01:44.879 --> 00:01:44.889 
bottom and the other side is just

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:48.149 
bottom and the other side is just
touching<00:01:45.779> the<00:01:46.779> top<00:01:47.020> of<00:01:47.169> the<00:01:47.259> other<00:01:47.619> sides<00:01:47.919> just

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:48.159 
touching the top of the other sides just

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:50.580 
touching the top of the other sides just
touching<00:01:48.520> the<00:01:48.639> line<00:01:48.819> there<00:01:49.209> and<00:01:49.989> then<00:01:50.049> we<00:01:50.560> can

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:50.590 
touching the line there and then we can

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.699 
touching the line there and then we can
just<00:01:50.889> draw<00:01:51.459> two<00:01:51.700> lines<00:01:52.029> up<00:01:52.270> underneath<00:01:52.709> line

00:01:53.699 --> 00:01:53.709 
just draw two lines up underneath line

00:01:53.709 --> 00:01:58.919 
just draw two lines up underneath line
their<00:01:54.099> line<00:01:54.639> there<00:01:55.679> take<00:01:56.679> that<00:01:56.859> down<00:01:57.779> so<00:01:58.779> get

00:01:58.919 --> 00:01:58.929 
their line there take that down so get

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:04.019 
their line there take that down so get
our<00:01:59.049> two<00:01:59.259> marks<00:02:00.270> cut<00:02:01.270> those<00:02:02.279> and<00:02:03.279> that<00:02:03.999> will

00:02:04.019 --> 00:02:04.029 
our two marks cut those and that will

00:02:04.029 --> 00:02:09.540 
our two marks cut those and that will
give<00:02:04.389> us<00:02:04.539> our<00:02:05.880> bevel<00:02:06.880> and<00:02:07.270> their<00:02:07.899> length<00:02:08.550> for

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
give us our bevel and their length for

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.110 
give us our bevel and their length for
our<00:02:09.970> herringbone<00:02:10.689> strut<00:02:11.079> and<00:02:11.260> then<00:02:11.469> obviously

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
our herringbone strut and then obviously

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.420 
our herringbone strut and then obviously
we<00:02:13.120> repeat<00:02:13.540> that<00:02:13.569> or<00:02:14.079> cut<00:02:14.829> the<00:02:14.950> same<00:02:15.159> length

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
we repeat that or cut the same length

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:16.550 
we repeat that or cut the same length
again

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
again

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.080 
again
and<00:02:17.560> that'll<00:02:17.800> give<00:02:17.950> us<00:02:17.980> a<00:02:18.160> one<00:02:18.340> the<00:02:18.670> opposite

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
and that'll give us a one the opposite

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.260 
and that'll give us a one the opposite
way<00:02:19.319> as<00:02:20.319> I<00:02:20.500> said<00:02:20.739> that<00:02:21.040> exercise<00:02:21.550> needs<00:02:21.849> to<00:02:22.090> be

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:22.270 
way as I said that exercise needs to be

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.500 
way as I said that exercise needs to be
repeated<00:02:23.400> wherever<00:02:24.400> you<00:02:24.640> have<00:02:24.849> a<00:02:24.880> different

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
repeated wherever you have a different

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:29.790 
repeated wherever you have a different
width<00:02:26.290> of<00:02:26.770> spacing<00:02:27.720> but<00:02:28.720> that<00:02:29.080> will<00:02:29.349> be<00:02:29.380> a<00:02:29.530> lot

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:29.800 
width of spacing but that will be a lot

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.559 
width of spacing but that will be a lot
quicker<00:02:30.010> than<00:02:30.160> trying<00:02:30.520> to<00:02:30.610> measure<00:02:30.849> it<00:02:31.090> in<00:02:31.209> and

00:02:31.559 --> 00:02:31.569 
quicker than trying to measure it in and

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:34.140 
quicker than trying to measure it in and
guess<00:02:32.100> what<00:02:33.100> the<00:02:33.220> actual<00:02:33.489> bevel<00:02:33.880> and<00:02:34.090> the

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
guess what the actual bevel and the

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.380 
guess what the actual bevel and the
length<00:02:34.330> is<00:02:34.540> so<00:02:34.959> that'll<00:02:35.200> make<00:02:35.380> cutting<00:02:35.920> your

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:36.390 
length is so that'll make cutting your

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:38.760 
length is so that'll make cutting your
herringbone<00:02:37.390> struts<00:02:37.780> in<00:02:37.989> a<00:02:38.200> little<00:02:38.650> bit

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
herringbone struts in a little bit

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:40.950 
herringbone struts in a little bit
quicker
