those other knives Steel's which I found

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.160 
those other knives Steel's which I found
to<00:01:20.400> be<00:01:20.430> pretty<00:01:20.549> adequate<00:01:21.090> and<00:01:21.420> a<00:01:21.479> lot<00:01:21.659> of<00:01:21.810> uses

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
to be pretty adequate and a lot of uses

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.399 
to be pretty adequate and a lot of uses
not<00:01:22.950> super<00:01:23.430> great<00:01:23.640> for<00:01:23.670> edge<00:01:23.909> retention<00:01:24.119> but<00:01:25.110> I

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
not super great for edge retention but I

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.499 
not super great for edge retention but I
would<00:01:25.619> probably<00:01:25.799> put<00:01:26.130> them<00:01:26.369> somewhere<00:01:27.119> in<00:01:27.330> the

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
would probably put them somewhere in the

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.420 
would probably put them somewhere in the
category<00:01:27.990> of<00:01:28.049> or<00:01:28.619> in<00:01:28.710> the<00:01:28.770> neighborhood<00:01:28.920> of<00:01:29.189> us

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
category of or in the neighborhood of us

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.850 
category of or in the neighborhood of us
8<00:01:29.700> as<00:01:29.909> far<00:01:30.119> as<00:01:30.210> quality<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:31.229> edge<00:01:31.350> retention

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
8 as far as quality and edge retention

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.280 
8 as far as quality and edge retention
maybe<00:01:32.820> you've<00:01:33.090> slightly<00:01:33.570> below<00:01:33.689> that<00:01:33.810> not

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
maybe you've slightly below that not

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.590 
maybe you've slightly below that not
really<00:01:34.500> sure<00:01:35.060> don't<00:01:36.060> know<00:01:36.180> how<00:01:36.329> extensive

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
really sure don't know how extensive

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.480 
really sure don't know how extensive
I'll<00:01:36.930> get<00:01:37.079> with<00:01:37.229> testing<00:01:37.590> either<00:01:37.799> on<00:01:38.070> this<00:01:38.310> in

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
I'll get with testing either on this in

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.539 
I'll get with testing either on this in
that<00:01:39.450> reverse<00:01:39.990> grip<00:01:40.320> I<00:01:40.500> definitely<00:01:41.100> feel<00:01:41.310> some

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
that reverse grip I definitely feel some

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.719 
that reverse grip I definitely feel some
pressure<00:01:42.110> from<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.229> spine<00:01:43.500> right<00:01:43.740> there<00:01:43.979> and

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
pressure from the spine right there and

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.670 
pressure from the spine right there and
that<00:01:44.850> becomes<00:01:45.119> quite<00:01:45.509> painful<00:01:46.020> to<00:01:46.049> hold<00:01:46.290> on<00:01:46.439> to

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
that becomes quite painful to hold on to

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.730 
that becomes quite painful to hold on to
that<00:01:47.220> weren't<00:01:47.430> wearing<00:01:47.579> gloves<00:01:47.880> I<00:01:48.409> would<00:01:49.409> stop

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
that weren't wearing gloves I would stop

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.670 
that weren't wearing gloves I would stop
immediately

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.930 

you<00:01:56.680> can<00:01:56.800> tell<00:01:57.010> that<00:01:57.160> that<00:01:57.220> has<00:01:57.490> got<00:01:57.640> a<00:01:57.670> little

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:57.940 
you can tell that that has got a little

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:59.460 
you can tell that that has got a little
pair<00:01:58.150> cord<00:01:58.420> wrapped<00:01:58.630> handle<00:01:59.050> but<00:01:59.170> it's<00:01:59.290> done

00:01:59.460 --> 00:01:59.470 
pair cord wrapped handle but it's done

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.350 
pair cord wrapped handle but it's done
in<00:01:59.500> the<00:01:59.650> kind<00:01:59.830> of<00:01:59.860> an<00:01:59.980> interesting<00:02:00.190> way<00:02:00.550> you

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
in the kind of an interesting way you

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.230 
in the kind of an interesting way you
see<00:02:01.570> that<00:02:01.750> the<00:02:02.170> frame<00:02:02.470> of<00:02:02.710> the<00:02:02.830> knife<00:02:03.040> is<00:02:03.340> such

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:04.240 
see that the frame of the knife is such

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:05.820 
see that the frame of the knife is such
that<00:02:04.540> it<00:02:04.780> kind<00:02:04.960> of<00:02:05.020> flows<00:02:05.320> through<00:02:05.650> right

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:05.830 
that it kind of flows through right

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:07.560 
that it kind of flows through right
there<00:02:06.070> and<00:02:06.220> on<00:02:06.280> the<00:02:06.400> bottom<00:02:06.760> and<00:02:06.940> then<00:02:07.450> the

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
there and on the bottom and then the

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.930 
there and on the bottom and then the
cord<00:02:07.900> wraps<00:02:08.560> around<00:02:08.770> on<00:02:09.160> that<00:02:09.310> inner<00:02:09.550> core<00:02:09.910> of

Steel<00:02:10.480> that<00:02:10.780> is<00:02:11.260> a<00:02:11.290> pretty<00:02:11.650> cool<00:02:11.950> feature<00:02:12.010> I

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
Steel that is a pretty cool feature I

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.190 
Steel that is a pretty cool feature I
like<00:02:12.760> the<00:02:12.940> way<00:02:13.060> that<00:02:13.240> works<00:02:13.450> it<00:02:13.600> does<00:02:13.780> not<00:02:13.930> add

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:14.200 
like the way that works it does not add

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.890 
like the way that works it does not add
anything<00:02:14.560> to<00:02:14.740> the<00:02:15.100> profile<00:02:15.730> of<00:02:16.030> the<00:02:16.690> knife

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
anything to the profile of the knife

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.650 
anything to the profile of the knife
while<00:02:17.860> giving<00:02:18.310> you<00:02:18.460> a<00:02:18.640> little<00:02:19.120> bit<00:02:19.240> of<00:02:19.360> girth

extra survival feature of some paracord

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.210 
extra survival feature of some paracord
right<00:02:28.270> with<00:02:28.450> a<00:02:28.480> little<00:02:28.750> bit<00:02:28.840> of<00:02:29.050> paracord<00:02:29.920> tied

right with a little bit of paracord tied
on<00:02:30.370> is<00:02:30.520> lanyard<00:02:31.030> as<00:02:31.180> well<00:02:31.360> I<00:02:31.570> don't<00:02:31.960> know<00:02:32.110> quite

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:32.350 
on is lanyard as well I don't know quite

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:34.170 
on is lanyard as well I don't know quite
how<00:02:32.650> much<00:02:32.680> is<00:02:33.040> on<00:02:33.250> here<00:02:33.520> I<00:02:33.550> would<00:02:33.820> say<00:02:33.850> it's

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:34.180 
how much is on here I would say it's

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:37.470 
how much is on here I would say it's
probably<00:02:34.440> less<00:02:35.440> than<00:02:35.650> six<00:02:35.920> feet<00:02:36.130> in<00:02:36.340> total

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
probably less than six feet in total

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.870 
probably less than six feet in total
however<00:02:38.170> I'll<00:02:38.410> take<00:02:38.650> that<00:02:38.830> over<00:02:39.130> nothing<00:02:39.430> what

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:39.880 
however I'll take that over nothing what

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:41.970 
however I'll take that over nothing what
I'm<00:02:39.970> doing<00:02:40.210> here<00:02:40.480> is<00:02:40.570> drilling<00:02:41.440> in<00:02:41.620> kind<00:02:41.830> of<00:02:41.890> a

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
I'm doing here is drilling in kind of a

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.700 
I'm doing here is drilling in kind of a
rotating<00:02:42.520> slice<00:02:42.910> and<00:02:43.300> kind<00:02:44.200> of<00:02:44.290> putting<00:02:44.590> all

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:44.710 
rotating slice and kind of putting all

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:47.520 
rotating slice and kind of putting all
the<00:02:44.800> pressure<00:02:44.950> on<00:02:45.160> the<00:02:45.400> edge<00:02:45.660> all<00:02:46.660> the<00:02:47.110> cutting

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
the pressure on the edge all the cutting

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.490 
the pressure on the edge all the cutting
opportunity<00:02:48.250> is<00:02:48.580> given<00:02:48.940> to<00:02:49.060> the<00:02:49.180> edge<00:02:49.500> given

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
opportunity is given to the edge given

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.170 
opportunity is given to the edge given
to<00:02:50.590> that<00:02:50.680> tip<00:02:50.920> in<00:02:51.070> that<00:02:51.190> edge<00:02:51.370> rather<00:02:52.030> than

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
to that tip in that edge rather than

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.730 
to that tip in that edge rather than
putting<00:02:52.360> a<00:02:52.480> lot<00:02:52.600> of<00:02:52.630> torsional<00:02:53.170> pressure<00:02:53.470> on

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:53.740 
putting a lot of torsional pressure on

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.130 
putting a lot of torsional pressure on
that<00:02:53.950> tip<00:02:54.250> and<00:02:54.630> pushing<00:02:55.630> it<00:02:55.720> to<00:02:55.810> the<00:02:55.840> point

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
that tip and pushing it to the point

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:03.479 
that tip and pushing it to the point
that<00:02:56.260> I<00:02:56.320> think<00:02:56.410> it's<00:02:56.650> going<00:02:56.800> to<00:02:56.860> break<00:03:02.310> it<00:03:03.310> does

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
that I think it's going to break it does

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:05.040 
that I think it's going to break it does
have<00:03:03.700> some<00:03:03.850> nice<00:03:03.970> jimping<00:03:04.480> here<00:03:04.660> at<00:03:04.750> the<00:03:04.840> top

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 
have some nice jimping here at the top

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.940 
have some nice jimping here at the top
and<00:03:05.709> also<00:03:06.040> in<00:03:06.489> the<00:03:06.670> finger<00:03:07.239> guard<00:03:07.420> right<00:03:07.690> there

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
and also in the finger guard right there

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.350 
and also in the finger guard right there
which<00:03:08.950> is<00:03:08.980> quite<00:03:09.489> aggressive<00:03:10.000> and<00:03:10.150> will

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:10.360 
which is quite aggressive and will

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.660 
which is quite aggressive and will
definitely<00:03:10.959> hold<00:03:11.200> a<00:03:11.320> bear<00:03:11.650> finger<00:03:12.280> into<00:03:12.520> that

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
definitely hold a bear finger into that

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.150 
definitely hold a bear finger into that
and<00:03:13.030> a<00:03:13.720> gloved<00:03:14.230> finger<00:03:14.560> I<00:03:14.590> think<00:03:14.890> will<00:03:15.010> do

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:15.160 
and a gloved finger I think will do

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.400 
and a gloved finger I think will do
quite<00:03:15.400> well<00:03:15.520> in<00:03:15.970> there<00:03:16.150> as<00:03:16.270> well<00:03:16.450> I<00:03:16.720> was<00:03:17.380> a

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:17.410 
quite well in there as well I was a

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:19.380 
quite well in there as well I was a
little<00:03:17.830> leery<00:03:18.040> at<00:03:18.280> first<00:03:18.580> about<00:03:18.910> these<00:03:19.090> points

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
little leery at first about these points

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.020 
little leery at first about these points
right<00:03:19.690> here<00:03:20.110> and<00:03:20.260> here<00:03:21.220> I<00:03:21.370> thought<00:03:21.820> those

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
right here and here I thought those

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:23.970 
right here and here I thought those
would<00:03:22.180> get<00:03:22.360> my<00:03:22.480> finger<00:03:22.900> and<00:03:23.110> I<00:03:23.200> would<00:03:23.350> not<00:03:23.650> feel

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
would get my finger and I would not feel

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.040 
would get my finger and I would not feel
comfortable<00:03:24.209> holding<00:03:25.209> on<00:03:25.300> to<00:03:25.450> this<00:03:25.570> knife<00:03:25.780> but

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.050 
comfortable holding on to this knife but

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:27.270 
comfortable holding on to this knife but
that<00:03:26.170> actually<00:03:26.560> is<00:03:26.680> just<00:03:26.980> the<00:03:27.100> right<00:03:27.250> amount

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:27.280 
that actually is just the right amount

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.900 
that actually is just the right amount
of<00:03:27.580> space<00:03:27.820> and<00:03:28.920> it's<00:03:29.920> it<00:03:30.310> does<00:03:30.459> a<00:03:30.489> pretty<00:03:30.700> nice

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
of space and it's it does a pretty nice

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.030 
of space and it's it does a pretty nice
job<00:03:31.180> of<00:03:31.239> kind<00:03:31.570> of<00:03:31.660> locking<00:03:32.140> my<00:03:32.290> finger<00:03:32.650> in<00:03:32.860> I

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
job of kind of locking my finger in I

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.710 
job of kind of locking my finger in I
actually<00:03:33.400> like<00:03:33.760> the<00:03:33.940> design<00:03:34.180> of<00:03:34.300> this<00:03:34.360> handle

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
actually like the design of this handle

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:37.650 
actually like the design of this handle
quite<00:03:35.410> a<00:03:35.440> lot<00:03:35.890> you<00:03:36.190> can<00:03:36.730> see<00:03:36.970> that<00:03:37.150> the<00:03:37.239> tip<00:03:37.450> on

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
quite a lot you can see that the tip on

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:41.460 
quite a lot you can see that the tip on
it<00:03:37.690> is<00:03:37.989> quite<00:03:38.590> delicate<00:03:39.870> really<00:03:40.870> really<00:03:41.200> fine

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
it is quite delicate really really fine

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.560 
it is quite delicate really really fine
that's<00:03:42.430> going<00:03:42.670> to<00:03:42.730> give<00:03:42.910> you<00:03:43.000> some<00:03:43.270> great

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.570 
that's going to give you some great

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:46.920 
that's going to give you some great
piercing<00:03:44.290> as<00:03:44.860> far<00:03:45.220> as<00:03:45.459> the<00:03:45.880> initial<00:03:46.209> stab<00:03:46.540> goes

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
piercing as far as the initial stab goes

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.920 
piercing as far as the initial stab goes
but<00:03:47.620> as<00:03:47.739> far<00:03:47.950> as<00:03:47.980> prying<00:03:48.489> or<00:03:49.060> any<00:03:49.540> kind<00:03:49.840> of

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
but as far as prying or any kind of

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.890 
but as far as prying or any kind of
accidental<00:03:50.620> chips<00:03:51.310> or<00:03:51.519> nicks<00:03:51.850> or<00:03:51.970> whatever<00:03:52.269> it

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:52.900 
accidental chips or nicks or whatever it

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:54.570 
accidental chips or nicks or whatever it
you<00:03:53.290> could<00:03:53.470> lose<00:03:53.620> that<00:03:53.650> tip<00:03:54.040> quite<00:03:54.280> quickly

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:54.580 
you could lose that tip quite quickly

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.750 
you could lose that tip quite quickly
and<00:03:55.120> I<00:03:55.720> also<00:03:56.019> notice<00:03:56.500> that<00:03:56.530> the<00:03:56.890> shape<00:03:57.430> of<00:03:57.610> that

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
and I also notice that the shape of that

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.630 
and I also notice that the shape of that
tanto<00:03:58.300> is<00:03:58.540> kind<00:03:59.500> of<00:03:59.560> a<00:03:59.739> would<00:04:00.160> you<00:04:00.280> call<00:04:00.460> that

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:00.640 
tanto is kind of a would you call that

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:02.790 
tanto is kind of a would you call that
concave<00:04:01.390> yeah<00:04:01.930> it's<00:04:02.080> kind<00:04:02.260> of<00:04:02.290> a<00:04:02.380> concave

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:02.800 
concave yeah it's kind of a concave

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.670 
concave yeah it's kind of a concave
shape<00:04:02.860> kind<00:04:03.730> of<00:04:03.820> curves<00:04:04.150> inward

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:05.680 
shape kind of curves inward

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.619 
shape kind of curves inward
which<00:04:05.950> means<00:04:06.190> that<00:04:06.430> you've<00:04:06.549> got<00:04:06.760> some<00:04:07.090> very

00:04:07.619 --> 00:04:07.629 
which means that you've got some very

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:10.619 
which means that you've got some very
aggressive<00:04:07.930> points<00:04:08.500> here<00:04:08.799> and<00:04:08.920> there<00:04:09.480> for<00:04:10.480> any

00:04:10.619 --> 00:04:10.629 
aggressive points here and there for any

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:12.449 
aggressive points here and there for any
of<00:04:10.720> those<00:04:10.780> sort<00:04:11.110> of<00:04:11.140> tactical<00:04:11.560> situations<00:04:12.220> in

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459 
of those sort of tactical situations in

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:14.729 
of those sort of tactical situations in
which<00:04:12.519> you<00:04:12.760> need<00:04:12.879> to<00:04:12.940> employ<00:04:13.209> those<00:04:13.540> I<00:04:13.810> bet<00:04:14.650> you

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:14.739 
which you need to employ those I bet you

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:16.439 
which you need to employ those I bet you
they<00:04:14.860> carve<00:04:15.159> up<00:04:15.340> some<00:04:15.519> wood<00:04:15.700> pretty<00:04:15.940> well<00:04:16.209> to

00:04:16.439 --> 00:04:16.449 
they carve up some wood pretty well to

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:18.930 
they carve up some wood pretty well to
that<00:04:17.410> secondary<00:04:17.859> tip<00:04:18.160> could<00:04:18.310> potentially

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:18.940 
that secondary tip could potentially

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.819 
that secondary tip could potentially
help<00:04:19.120> you<00:04:19.329> to<00:04:19.510> drill<00:04:19.750> a<00:04:19.780> hole<00:04:19.870> in<00:04:20.320> some<00:04:20.620> wood

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:20.829 
help you to drill a hole in some wood

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:23.219 
help you to drill a hole in some wood
however<00:04:21.760> it's<00:04:22.000> not<00:04:22.120> really<00:04:22.180> doesn<00:04:23.080> really

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:23.229 
however it's not really doesn really

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:25.620 
however it's not really doesn really
have<00:04:23.380> the<00:04:23.790> doesn't<00:04:24.790> protrude<00:04:25.090> enough<00:04:25.479> to

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
have the doesn't protrude enough to

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.120 
have the doesn't protrude enough to
really<00:04:25.810> get<00:04:25.930> the<00:04:26.020> job<00:04:26.229> done<00:04:26.440> so<00:04:26.770> you<00:04:26.830> kind<00:04:27.070> of

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.130 
really get the job done so you kind of

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.159 
really get the job done so you kind of
do<00:04:27.280> need<00:04:27.490> that<00:04:27.520> main<00:04:27.940> tip<00:04:28.210> which<00:04:28.810> again<00:04:29.020> is

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:29.169 
do need that main tip which again is

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:31.409 
do need that main tip which again is
quite<00:04:29.260> delicate<00:04:29.560> and<00:04:30.070> so<00:04:30.580> I<00:04:30.610> would<00:04:30.850> be<00:04:31.030> very

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:31.419 
quite delicate and so I would be very

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:32.640 
quite delicate and so I would be very
careful<00:04:31.630> with<00:04:31.960> it<00:04:31.990> if<00:04:32.199> you're<00:04:32.290> doing<00:04:32.410> any<00:04:32.590> sort

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:32.650 
careful with it if you're doing any sort

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.650 
careful with it if you're doing any sort
of<00:04:32.830> drilling<00:04:33.160> and<00:04:33.280> it<00:04:33.340> sort<00:04:33.490> of<00:04:33.520> prying<00:04:33.820> any

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
of drilling and it sort of prying any

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.350 
of drilling and it sort of prying any
sort<00:04:34.930> of<00:04:35.020> really<00:04:35.410> tight<00:04:36.220> kind<00:04:36.580> of<00:04:36.729> fine

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
sort of really tight kind of fine

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:41.189 
sort of really tight kind of fine
cutting<00:04:37.810> with<00:04:38.350> that<00:04:38.500> tip<00:04:39.180> go<00:04:40.180> easy<00:04:40.389> on<00:04:40.539> it<00:04:40.660> it's

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:41.199 
cutting with that tip go easy on it it's

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:43.080 
cutting with that tip go easy on it it's
not<00:04:41.860> designed<00:04:42.310> to<00:04:42.430> take<00:04:42.490> a<00:04:42.669> whole<00:04:42.880> lot<00:04:42.910> of

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.420 
not designed to take a whole lot of
pressure<00:04:43.389> I'm<00:04:44.320> quite<00:04:44.650> certain<00:04:45.070> that<00:04:45.100> it<00:04:45.340> would

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
pressure I'm quite certain that it would

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.840 
pressure I'm quite certain that it would
bust<00:04:45.760> off<00:04:45.970> in<00:04:46.300> a<00:04:47.050> heartbeat<00:04:47.410> if<00:04:47.740> I<00:04:48.490> gave<00:04:48.669> it<00:04:48.789> the

bust off in a heartbeat if I gave it the

bust off in a heartbeat if I gave it the
opportunity<00:04:49.389> to<00:04:49.539> however<00:04:50.229> it<00:04:50.530> seems<00:04:50.740> clear<00:04:50.949> to

opportunity to however it seems clear to

00:04:50.979 --> 00:04:52.560 
opportunity to however it seems clear to
me<00:04:51.100> that<00:04:51.310> if<00:04:51.400> you<00:04:51.490> use<00:04:51.639> the<00:04:51.760> tool<00:04:51.970> within<00:04:52.210> its

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.570 
me that if you use the tool within its

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:57.060 
me that if you use the tool within its
capacity<00:04:53.220> then<00:04:54.220> it's<00:04:54.550> clear<00:04:55.479> capability<00:04:56.260> it

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.070 
capacity then it's clear capability it

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:59.640 
capacity then it's clear capability it

still the tip looks fine I'm kind of

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:22.950 
still the tip looks fine I'm kind of
banging<00:05:20.050> that<00:05:20.200> tip<00:05:20.440> are<00:05:21.450> doing<00:05:22.450> fine<00:05:22.660> the<00:05:22.840> edge

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:22.960 
banging that tip are doing fine the edge

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:47.950 
banging that tip are doing fine the edge
is<00:05:23.139> also<00:05:23.320> perfect<00:05:24.190> still

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:47.960

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:50.970 
and the see for this browning opmod was

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:53.420 
and the see for this browning opmod was
priority<00:05:51.180> knife<00:05:51.660> he<00:05:52.440> is<00:05:52.590> made<00:05:52.770> by<00:05:52.920> blade<00:05:53.160> tech

priority knife he is made by blade tech

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:55.460 
priority knife he is made by blade tech
it<00:05:53.610> feels<00:05:53.820> like<00:05:54.060> a<00:05:54.090> type<00:05:54.330> of<00:05:54.360> Kydex<00:05:54.720> or<00:05:55.140> some

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:55.470 
it feels like a type of Kydex or some

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:57.560 
it feels like a type of Kydex or some

blade<00:05:57.990> Tech's<00:05:58.320> tech<00:05:58.830> lock<00:05:59.100> now<00:06:00.000> if<00:06:00.360> there's

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:00.630 
blade Tech's tech lock now if there's

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:02.960 
blade Tech's tech lock now if there's
one<00:06:00.690> downside<00:06:01.530> to<00:06:01.590> this<00:06:02.190> knife<00:06:02.370> carrying<00:06:02.850> this

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:02.970 
one downside to this knife carrying this

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:05.210 
one downside to this knife carrying this
system<00:06:03.420> it's<00:06:04.020> that<00:06:04.260> this<00:06:04.440> is<00:06:04.590> a<00:06:04.620> very<00:06:04.950> small

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:05.220 
system it's that this is a very small

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:07.870 
system it's that this is a very small
knife<00:06:05.430> and<00:06:05.640> this<00:06:06.180> is<00:06:06.360> a<00:06:06.390> very<00:06:06.810> big<00:06:07.170> clip<00:06:07.590> system

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:07.880 
knife and this is a very big clip system

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.730 
knife and this is a very big clip system
so<00:06:08.880> it<00:06:09.030> adds<00:06:09.240> a<00:06:09.420> lot<00:06:09.570> of<00:06:09.630> weight<00:06:09.870> a<00:06:09.930> lot<00:06:10.320> of<00:06:10.470> bulk

00:06:10.730 --> 00:06:10.740 
so it adds a lot of weight a lot of bulk

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:13.640 
so it adds a lot of weight a lot of bulk
to<00:06:11.280> what<00:06:11.430> would<00:06:11.550> otherwise<00:06:11.850> be<00:06:12.000> a<00:06:12.360> very<00:06:12.650> small

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:13.650 
to what would otherwise be a very small

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:16.820 
to what would otherwise be a very small
neck<00:06:14.460> knife<00:06:14.670> package<00:06:15.240> or<00:06:15.600> belt<00:06:16.080> knife<00:06:16.260> package

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:16.830 
neck knife package or belt knife package

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:19.280 
neck knife package or belt knife package
or<00:06:16.980> something<00:06:17.310> like<00:06:17.430> that<00:06:17.720> not<00:06:18.720> minimal

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:19.290 
or something like that not minimal

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:22.700 
or something like that not minimal
really<00:06:19.800> at<00:06:19.950> all<00:06:19.980> in<00:06:20.430> the<00:06:20.520> clip<00:06:20.990> Department<00:06:21.990> so

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:22.710 
really at all in the clip Department so

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:24.800 
really at all in the clip Department so
it's<00:06:23.070> really<00:06:23.430> really<00:06:23.670> versatile<00:06:24.180> system<00:06:24.450> but

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:24.810 
it's really really versatile system but

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:26.450 
it's really really versatile system but
like<00:06:24.960> I<00:06:25.080> said<00:06:25.140> for<00:06:25.440> a<00:06:25.500> small<00:06:25.770> knife<00:06:25.980> like<00:06:26.220> this

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:26.460 
like I said for a small knife like this

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:29.030 
like I said for a small knife like this
maybe<00:06:26.760> a<00:06:27.060> little<00:06:27.330> bit<00:06:27.450> of<00:06:27.540> overkill<00:06:27.890> guys<00:06:28.890> I

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:29.040 
maybe a little bit of overkill guys I

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:30.560 
maybe a little bit of overkill guys I
love<00:06:29.250> it<00:06:29.370> when<00:06:29.460> a<00:06:29.520> tool<00:06:29.760> exceeds<00:06:30.300> its

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:30.570 
love it when a tool exceeds its

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:32.150 
love it when a tool exceeds its
supposedly<00:06:30.960> Matei<00:06:31.440> shion's<00:06:31.650> and<00:06:31.830> i<00:06:31.860> would<00:06:31.980> say

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:32.160 
supposedly Matei shion's and i would say
