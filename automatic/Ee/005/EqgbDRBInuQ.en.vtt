00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:06.470
 Welcome 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:10.619
 today we will discuss measures of variability 

00:00:10.619 --> 00:00:11.699
 remember 

00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:15.189
 It is important to take into account that the measures of variability are 

00:00:15.189 --> 00:00:18.529
 find within the descriptive statistical area 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:22.060
 also within the descriptive statistics were the measures 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.529
 of tendencies enter that are the average the median call 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.140
 However, today we are going to concentrate on the measures of 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:30.289
 variability 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:32.690
 you can see the stands 

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:37.590
 in this graph you can see three curves that represent three groups of 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:38.880
 age 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:39.950
 group A 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.150
 group by group c 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:46.910
 as we would detect here the variability 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.679
 let's imagine that within these three groups 

00:00:49.679 --> 00:00:52.380
 they have the same average the same currency 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:53.550
 and the same 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:54.910
 median 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.960
 However, West can see that even though they have the same average 

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.930
 same fashion and the same median 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.560
 they do not have the same data distribution 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.799
 then that is what we are going to try to calculate 

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:09.850
 by these measurements you can see 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.960
 that the measures of 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.080
 of the data 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.460
 from group a 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.159
 they are different from distributions 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.910
 of group b 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:23.280
 you can even see that those in group a are better known 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.580
 to those of group b 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.370
 then with the measures of variability what is sought 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:34.730
 is to determine the dispersion that exists between two groups of data for example the 

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:35.570
 group A 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:36.890
 with group b 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.130
 is going to determine 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.170
 the dispersion that exists in the distribution 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.340
 it's from the graphics we can see 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.400
 what in 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.090
 there is less distribution 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.510
 since we have almost one last entity 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:56.990
 while we have a web more applauded hand more this square have it 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:58.610
 the figure of g 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.789
 then it means that there is a greater distribution 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:05.669
 but to determine what is the variability of this graph in the 

00:02:05.669 --> 00:02:06.549
 graphic see 

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:10.189
 we're going to do it by measuring variability 

00:02:10.189 --> 00:02:14.409
 Within the measurements of variability are found the average deviation 

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:17.639
 the variance and the standard deviation 

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:21.119
 however, the most used in statistics ine the statistical way 

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:23.789
 are the variance and the deviation are 

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:27.889
 then today we are going to concentrate on analyzing a little more the 

00:02:27.889 --> 00:02:31.289
 variance batteries from that moment 

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:33.039
 we can see here 

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:36.419
 the formulas of these measures of variability 

00:02:36.419 --> 00:02:40.059
 it says that the standard deviation in the square root of the variance 

00:02:40.059 --> 00:02:41.969
 Then its can we check 

00:02:41.969 --> 00:02:46.239
 is effectively met with this theory you can see the formula 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:51.090
 of the ancestry that the summation of the data with larissa today the forgiveness 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.239
 the data the mean i the age number is a very simple formula 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:59.930
 but the standard deviation would just be as you can 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.509
 observe here the square root of the several 

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:07.849
 for a better understanding let's review an example 

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:12.839
 you already know here no na for bad relationship from ciu estÃ¡ 

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:15.259
 too easy 

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:19.280
 we have a group of data equally let's assume that it is a group of ten data 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.360
 then what we should do immediately to determine the 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.709
 standard deviation that apply to fort 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:26.979
 as I mentioned earlier 

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:31.249
 what you need to know is an average 

00:03:31.249 --> 00:03:35.649
 squared and a summation then the initial data we're going 

00:03:35.649 --> 00:03:37.989
 apply to each of the fort 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:42.499
 we have to first have x square 

00:03:42.499 --> 00:03:43.490
 nothing else 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:46.039
 we raise the initial data 

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:47.439
 then we have 

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:48.969
 what to get 

00:03:48.969 --> 00:03:51.999
 in the initial data less than average 

00:03:51.999 --> 00:03:53.599
 now the average 

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:57.159
 it would come to be 44 divided for 10 

00:03:57.159 --> 00:04:00.140
 as I already clarified how we had already indicated 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:05.080
 the average is the sum of the data divided for the total that in this case 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:08.629
 would be 10 this way we have the average 

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:13.889
 we can make the commune 3 dairy x- the militia 

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:18.989
 and so later as you can see it is an easy application a 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:24.559
 once developed this way we protect it the data of 0 points 77 

00:04:24.559 --> 00:04:28.870
 then I invite you that greater detail you develop it 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.610
 apply the formula do the calculations were going to be able to verify that the 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.419
 results on 0 points 77 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:40.520
 also how the coefficient of variation is determined as a percentage 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.520
 the next variation vara coefficient is already very sensitive 

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.370
 apply it and you can analyze it in percentages 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:51.410
 it allows to compare as a percentage the dispersions of the distributions this 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:54.960
 remember earlier Burmese French graphics in percentage allows 

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.740
 determine the ive delivery distribution 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:59.789
 what is the formula is very simple 

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:04.149
 and the standard deviation we saw earlier as calculating it once 

00:05:04.149 --> 00:05:08.749
 that gets it divided for the mean multiplied by seven that would be 

00:05:08.749 --> 00:05:13.270
 the formula so that you can get a coefficient of variation and 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:17.339
 can determine for example that the variation between air is 80 

00:05:17.339 --> 00:05:18.620
 One hundred is an example 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.400
 then it is very simple but previously to this 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.720
 you must calculate with the formula 

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:28.070
 the standard deviation and the mean and here and nothing else apply the data 

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:29.499
 final 

00:05:29.499 --> 00:05:30.430
 Thank you 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:32.530
 we will see in a next explanation
