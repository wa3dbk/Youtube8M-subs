places like that that haven't seen a
tornado<00:02:07.840> table<00:02:08.500> per<00:02:08.679> se<00:02:08.890> I<00:02:09.220> think<00:02:09.910> they<00:02:10.060> would

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.210 
tornado table per se I think they would

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:11.850 
tornado table per se I think they would
play<00:02:10.420> on<00:02:10.630> this<00:02:10.840> and<00:02:11.110> we<00:02:11.200> might<00:02:11.410> have<00:02:11.590> a<00:02:11.620> whole

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
play on this and we might have a whole

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.480 
play on this and we might have a whole
new<00:02:12.010> group<00:02:12.250> coming<00:02:13.120> in<00:02:13.330> of<00:02:13.720> teenagers<00:02:14.320> I<00:02:14.560> don't

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
new group coming in of teenagers I don't

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.520 
new group coming in of teenagers I don't
think<00:02:15.700> this<00:02:15.880> is<00:02:16.150> the<00:02:16.570> type<00:02:16.810> of<00:02:16.840> table<00:02:17.200> that

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
think this is the type of table that

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.830 
think this is the type of table that
will<00:02:17.860> compete<00:02:18.520> in<00:02:18.760> the<00:02:18.880> market<00:02:19.300> tornado

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
will compete in the market tornado

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.080 
will compete in the market tornado
