00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
a battery in this is a not sure what

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.199 
a battery in this is a not sure what
that<00:02:49.160> is<00:02:49.280> but<00:02:50.050> maybe<00:02:51.050> a<00:02:51.230> 3G<00:02:51.740> card<00:02:51.950> I<00:02:52.160> don't<00:02:52.940> know

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:53.209 
that is but maybe a 3G card I don't know

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:58.449 
that is but maybe a 3G card I don't know
ok<00:02:53.780> so<00:02:53.840> that<00:02:54.080> a<00:02:55.720> headphone<00:02:56.720> microphone<00:02:57.459> USB

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:58.459 
ok so that a headphone microphone USB

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:01.980 
ok so that a headphone microphone USB
Ethernet<00:02:59.860> cousin<00:03:00.860> hemlock<00:03:01.190> pull<00:03:01.430> right<00:03:01.520> here

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:01.990 
Ethernet cousin hemlock pull right here

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:03.699 
Ethernet cousin hemlock pull right here
that's<00:03:02.990> really<00:03:03.319> smart

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
that's really smart

Lenovo they put the clock in the in the

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.270 
Lenovo they put the clock in the in the
hinge<00:03:07.970> so<00:03:08.420> the<00:03:08.569> safe<00:03:08.720> space<00:03:09.099> this<00:03:10.099> is<00:03:10.190> a

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
hinge so the safe space this is a

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.390 
hinge so the safe space this is a
battery<00:03:10.490> I'll<00:03:10.790> put<00:03:10.970> it<00:03:11.060> in<00:03:11.150> right<00:03:11.300> now

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
oh the audible other side ports this is

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.680 
oh the audible other side ports this is
a<00:03:43.600> fan<00:03:43.870> the<00:03:44.500> VGA<00:03:44.920> I<00:03:45.370> think<00:03:46.240> this<00:03:46.360> is<00:03:46.510> this

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
a fan the VGA I think this is this

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:51.270 
a fan the VGA I think this is this
little<00:03:46.959> hole<00:03:47.110> is<00:03:47.350> the<00:03:47.850> adapter<00:03:48.850> the<00:03:49.090> USB<00:03:50.280> slot

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
little hole is the adapter the USB slot

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.040 
little hole is the adapter the USB slot
card<00:03:51.730> reader<00:03:51.880> and<00:03:52.090> the<00:03:52.270> other<00:03:52.450> USB<00:03:52.840> port

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:53.050 
card reader and the other USB port

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:54.990 
card reader and the other USB port
there's<00:03:53.170> only<00:03:53.260> two<00:03:53.500> on<00:03:53.650> this<00:03:53.770> model<00:03:53.950> but<00:03:54.880> it's

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
while it's started booting up it has a

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:54.570 
while it's started booting up it has a
little<00:04:51.500> set<00:04:51.770> that<00:04:52.099> was<00:04:52.660> 512<00:04:53.660> megabytes<00:04:54.139> of<00:04:54.259> RAM

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:52.909 

yeah<00:05:45.689> it's<00:05:46.080> mainly<00:05:46.439> battery<00:05:48.319> power<00:05:51.050> and<00:05:52.050> Wi-Fi

00:05:52.909 --> 00:05:52.919

I<00:05:53.839> think<00:05:54.839> here<00:05:54.960> from<00:05:55.110> the<00:05:55.199> sound<00:05:55.409> I<00:05:55.649> don't<00:05:56.099> know

00:05:56.149 --> 00:05:56.159 
I think here from the sound I don't know

00:05:56.159 --> 00:05:59.920 
I think here from the sound I don't know
sound<00:05:56.909> from<00:05:57.539> here<00:05:57.749> to<00:05:57.990> the<00:05:58.139> my<00:05:58.649> cameras

00:05:59.920 --> 00:05:59.930 
sound from here to the my cameras

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:02.149 
sound from here to the my cameras
translates<00:06:00.930> that<00:06:01.199> well<00:06:01.379> but<00:06:01.589> if<00:06:01.800> the<00:06:01.919> sound

00:06:02.149 --> 00:06:02.159 
translates that well but if the sound

00:06:02.159 --> 00:06:03.529 
translates that well but if the sound
quality<00:06:02.460> from<00:06:02.550> my<00:06:02.699> people<00:06:02.969> here<00:06:03.149> is<00:06:03.240> pretty

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:03.539 
quality from my people here is pretty
