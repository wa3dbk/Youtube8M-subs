I'm using play cloth for and see if

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.010 
I'm using play cloth for and see if
wraps<00:01:47.140> fraps<00:01:47.740> was<00:01:48.159> being<00:01:48.429> really<00:01:48.640> stupid<00:01:49.119> with

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
wraps fraps was being really stupid with

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.950 
wraps fraps was being really stupid with
my<00:01:50.229> GPU<00:01:51.039> and<00:01:51.189> processor<00:01:51.729> so<00:01:52.359> I'll<00:01:52.539> play<00:01:52.719> cloth

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:52.960 
my GPU and processor so I'll play cloth

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.889 
my GPU and processor so I'll play cloth
for<00:01:53.200> and<00:01:53.499> it<00:01:53.770> runs<00:01:54.100> much<00:01:54.939> better<00:01:54.969> and<00:01:55.509> has<00:01:55.869> a

00:01:55.889 --> 00:01:55.899 
for and it runs much better and has a

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:57.270 
for and it runs much better and has a
lot<00:01:56.109> more<00:01:56.140> better<00:01:56.469> features<00:01:56.710> like<00:01:57.130> for

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.280 
lot more better features like for

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.529 
lot more better features like for
example<00:01:57.369> it<00:01:57.729> right<00:01:57.880> now<00:01:58.030> it<00:01:58.119> shows<00:01:58.240> me<00:01:58.450> how

00:01:58.529 --> 00:01:58.539 
example it right now it shows me how

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:00.419 
example it right now it shows me how
long<00:01:58.689> my<00:01:58.749> recording<00:01:59.319> is<00:01:59.409> and<00:01:59.619> how<00:01:59.710> memory<00:02:00.249> is

00:02:00.419 --> 00:02:00.429 
long my recording is and how memory is

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:03.209 
long my recording is and how memory is
taking<00:02:01.210> up<00:02:01.329> as<00:02:01.479> I<00:02:02.020> record<00:02:02.350> so<00:02:03.009> that's<00:02:03.159> very

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:03.219 
taking up as I record so that's very

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:06.840 
taking up as I record so that's very
cool<00:02:03.520> and<00:02:03.819> there's<00:02:04.780> no<00:02:05.049> set<00:02:05.740> limit<00:02:05.950> to<00:02:06.429> record

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
cool and there's no set limit to record

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:09.840 
cool and there's no set limit to record
at<00:02:06.999> like<00:02:07.240> theirs<00:02:07.479> theirs<00:02:07.659> what<00:02:08.350> the<00:02:08.560> video<00:02:09.009> fit

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:09.850 
at like theirs theirs what the video fit

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:11.850 
at like theirs theirs what the video fit
finalized<00:02:10.420> that<00:02:10.660> so<00:02:10.869> I<00:02:10.929> have<00:02:11.500> to<00:02:11.620> finalize

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
finalized that so I have to finalize

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.740 
finalized that so I have to finalize
that's<00:02:12.340> 30<00:02:12.550> frames<00:02:12.850> per<00:02:12.940> second<00:02:13.390> but<00:02:13.569> when

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
that's 30 frames per second but when

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.420 
that's 30 frames per second but when
you're<00:02:13.870> recording<00:02:14.170> in<00:02:14.440> game<00:02:14.650> it<00:02:14.860> just<00:02:14.890> records

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
you're recording in game it just records

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:16.740 
you're recording in game it just records
out<00:02:15.580> whatever<00:02:15.730> your<00:02:16.030> computer<00:02:16.330> is<00:02:16.390> running<00:02:16.540> it

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
out whatever your computer is running it

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.140 
out whatever your computer is running it
as<00:02:16.870> so<00:02:17.500> right<00:02:17.650> now<00:02:17.680> for<00:02:17.980> example<00:02:18.090> recording<00:02:19.090> I

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
as so right now for example recording I

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.370 
as so right now for example recording I

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:02.869 

they're<00:04:01.799> really<00:04:01.920> spread<00:04:02.370> out<00:04:02.400> I<00:04:02.519> don't<00:04:02.730> think

00:04:02.869 --> 00:04:02.879 
they're really spread out I don't think

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:04.640

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
they don't think they thought this

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:07.970

through

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.130 

over<00:04:08.159> the<00:04:08.250> place<00:04:08.720> yeah<00:04:09.720> I<00:04:09.870> don't<00:04:10.019> think

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.140 
over the place yeah I don't think

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.839 
over the place yeah I don't think
they're<00:04:10.260> going<00:04:10.349> to<00:04:10.440> win<00:04:10.500> this<00:04:10.650> one<00:04:13.610> now<00:04:14.610> this

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:14.849 
they're going to win this one now this

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:17.840 
they're going to win this one now this
can't<00:04:15.150> aim<00:04:15.330> very<00:04:15.360> high<00:04:15.989> like<00:04:16.549> well<00:04:17.549> I<00:04:17.579> guess

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 
can't aim very high like well I guess

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.509 
can't aim very high like well I guess
again<00:04:18.120> but<00:04:18.359> it<00:04:18.419> can<00:04:18.540> aim<00:04:18.750> really<00:04:19.590> low<00:04:19.799> which

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:20.519 
again but it can aim really low which

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:24.040 
again but it can aim really low which
the<00:04:20.880> age<00:04:21.479> 15<00:04:21.989> they<00:04:22.079> could<00:04:22.260> do<00:04:22.490> the<00:04:23.490> horizontal

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
the age 15 they could do the horizontal

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:29.559 
the age 15 they could do the horizontal
Traverse<00:04:25.050> on<00:04:25.320> this<00:04:25.470> thing<00:04:25.680> is<00:04:25.860> really<00:04:26.340> nice

00:04:29.559 --> 00:04:29.569 

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:31.629 

I<00:04:29.689> could<00:04:30.319> just<00:04:30.469> show<00:04:30.619> the<00:04:30.740> damage<00:04:31.129> off<00:04:31.309> at<00:04:31.520> the

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:31.639 
I could just show the damage off at the

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:33.760 
I could just show the damage off at the
minutes<00:04:31.939> but<00:04:32.089> we're<00:04:32.210> kind<00:04:32.360> of<00:04:32.529> kicking<00:04:33.529> their

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
minutes but we're kind of kicking their

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:35.690 
minutes but we're kind of kicking their
ass<00:04:33.949> too<00:04:34.219> fast

ass too fast

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.850 
ass too fast
that<00:04:36.240> I<00:04:36.450> was<00:04:36.600> saying<00:04:36.870> that<00:04:37.050> we're<00:04:37.320> winning<00:04:37.590> too
