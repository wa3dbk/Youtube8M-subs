00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.180 
also get Goofy and Donald into the mix
as<00:02:06.990> it's<00:02:07.229> pretty<00:02:07.560> much<00:02:07.799> just<00:02:07.860> the

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
as it's pretty much just the

that's<00:02:12.750> the<00:02:12.810> only<00:02:12.989> thing<00:02:13.079> that<00:02:13.290> really<00:02:13.379> stands

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
that's the only thing that really stands

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.679

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
this enjoyable doofus and they added

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:19.759 
this enjoyable doofus and they added
this<00:02:17.939> really<00:02:18.329> weird<00:02:18.629> plot<00:02:18.989> device<00:02:19.379> where<00:02:19.590> he

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:19.769 
this really weird plot device where he

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:22.039 
this really weird plot device where he
could<00:02:19.950> change<00:02:20.280> into<00:02:20.640> anything<00:02:21.120> isn't<00:02:21.959> that

could change into anything isn't that

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:22.729 
could change into anything isn't that
strange

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
strange

he's<00:02:22.920> already<00:02:23.310> a<00:02:23.459> giant<00:02:24.030> why<00:02:24.180> do<00:02:24.239> you<00:02:24.329> have<00:02:24.450> to

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
he's already a giant why do you have to

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:26.509 
he's already a giant why do you have to
give<00:02:24.719> him<00:02:24.810> more<00:02:24.959> magical<00:02:25.439> stuff<00:02:25.709> being<00:02:26.400> a

giant's enough on top of it that don't
really<00:02:28.620> do<00:02:28.980> anything<00:02:29.250> with<00:02:29.459> it<00:02:29.639> there's<00:02:30.000> a

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
really do anything with it there's a

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.459 
really do anything with it there's a
whole<00:02:30.209> chasing<00:02:30.750> at<00:02:30.930> the<00:02:31.049> end<00:02:31.200> where<00:02:31.379> he's

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:31.469 
whole chasing at the end where he's

00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:32.809 
whole chasing at the end where he's
trying<00:02:31.709> to<00:02:31.799> get<00:02:31.980> them<00:02:32.159> but<00:02:32.310> wouldn't<00:02:32.670> just

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 
trying to get them but wouldn't just

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:34.309 
trying to get them but wouldn't just
make<00:02:32.879> more<00:02:33.120> sense<00:02:33.359> if<00:02:33.510> you<00:02:33.569> turn<00:02:33.750> to<00:02:33.930> a<00:02:33.959> cheetah

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
make more sense if you turn to a cheetah

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.080 
make more sense if you turn to a cheetah
or<00:02:34.500> something<00:02:34.560> the<00:02:35.280> film<00:02:35.489> doesn't<00:02:35.790> quite<00:02:35.909> have

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
or something the film doesn't quite have

music head and to be honest I don't know
what<00:02:40.139> the<00:02:40.260> connection<00:02:40.829> is<00:02:40.950> with<00:02:41.159> all<00:02:41.310> these

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:41.489 
what the connection is with all these

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:43.699 
what the connection is with all these
things<00:02:41.819> you<00:02:42.030> have<00:02:42.060> Jiminy<00:02:42.719> Cricket<00:02:42.750> then<00:02:43.680> a

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
things you have Jiminy Cricket then a

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.520 
things you have Jiminy Cricket then a
bear<00:02:44.129> from<00:02:44.340> a<00:02:44.459> circus<00:02:45.030> into<00:02:45.450> the<00:02:45.629> wild<00:02:46.200> then<00:02:46.500> a

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
bear from a circus into the wild then a

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.250 
bear from a circus into the wild then a
creepy<00:02:47.280> man<00:02:47.519> with<00:02:47.760> puppets<00:02:48.299> and<00:02:48.569> then<00:02:48.959> Jack

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
creepy man with puppets and then Jack

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.960 
creepy man with puppets and then Jack
and<00:02:49.439> the<00:02:49.500> Beanstalk<00:02:49.530> how's<00:02:50.489> it<00:02:50.639> all<00:02:50.760> tied

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
and the Beanstalk how's it all tied

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.809 
and the Beanstalk how's it all tied
together<00:02:51.590> individually<00:02:52.590> we<00:02:52.950> work<00:02:53.159> okay

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
together individually we work okay

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:55.759 
together individually we work okay
as<00:02:53.939> cartoons<00:02:54.510> but<00:02:54.959> I<00:02:55.139> don't<00:02:55.409> think<00:02:55.590> there's

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
as cartoons but I don't think there's

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:57.440 
as cartoons but I don't think there's
enough<00:02:56.099> of<00:02:56.189> them<00:02:56.340> to<00:02:56.459> really<00:02:56.639> warrant<00:02:56.909> a<00:02:57.090> film

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
enough of them to really warrant a film

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.300 
enough of them to really warrant a film
or<00:02:57.959> if<00:02:58.109> they<00:02:58.230> did<00:02:58.439> pick<00:02:58.650> two<00:02:58.859> they'd<00:02:59.069> have<00:02:59.189> to

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
or if they did pick two they'd have to

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:00.830 
or if they did pick two they'd have to
do<00:02:59.430> ones<00:02:59.639> that<00:02:59.790> are<00:02:59.849> particularly<00:03:00.209> unique<00:03:00.510> or

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
do ones that are particularly unique or

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.659 
do ones that are particularly unique or
particularly<00:03:01.230> cinematic<00:03:02.010> and<00:03:02.219> the<00:03:02.370> are<00:03:02.489> these

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:02.669 
particularly cinematic and the are these

00:03:02.669 --> 00:03:04.819 
particularly cinematic and the are these
really<00:03:02.939> are<00:03:03.269> again<00:03:04.079> they're<00:03:04.349> not<00:03:04.530> bad<00:03:04.799> they're

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:04.829 
really are again they're not bad they're

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:06.860 
really are again they're not bad they're
just<00:03:05.129> not<00:03:05.400> anything<00:03:05.669> that<00:03:05.819> special<00:03:06.389> but<00:03:06.750> they

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
just not anything that special but they

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.539 
just not anything that special but they
have<00:03:07.049> their<00:03:07.169> own<00:03:07.200> charm<00:03:07.590> and<00:03:07.829> likeability<00:03:08.370> to

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
have their own charm and likeability to

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:10.759 
have their own charm and likeability to
them<00:03:08.700> so<00:03:08.939> I<00:03:08.969> guess<00:03:09.480> they<00:03:09.599> work<00:03:09.780> out<00:03:09.959> I'd<00:03:10.590> say

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
them so I guess they work out I'd say

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:12.170 
them so I guess they work out I'd say
it's<00:03:10.919> probably<00:03:11.099> better<00:03:11.489> just<00:03:11.760> to<00:03:11.849> rent<00:03:12.060> them

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
it's probably better just to rent them

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.000 
it's probably better just to rent them
individually<00:03:12.870> and<00:03:13.049> skip<00:03:13.290> the<00:03:13.439> middle<00:03:13.709> parts

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
individually and skip the middle parts

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.229 
individually and skip the middle parts
but<00:03:14.280> that's<00:03:14.609> just<00:03:14.790> me

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 
but that's just me

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:16.520 
but that's just me
you<00:03:15.540> know<00:03:15.659> what's<00:03:15.840> good<00:03:16.019> to<00:03:16.169> you<00:03:16.290> you'll

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
you know what's good to you you'll

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:24.640 
you know what's good to you you'll
probably<00:03:16.560> like<00:03:17.159> it

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.709
