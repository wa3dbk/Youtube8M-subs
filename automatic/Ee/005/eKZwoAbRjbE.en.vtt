00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
Souls and this was the mod I was using

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.610 
Souls and this was the mod I was using
back<00:00:58.500> in<00:00:58.890> 1.5<00:00:59.730> of<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.059> game<00:01:00.270> however<00:01:00.809> as<00:01:01.230> a<00:01:01.260> lot

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
back in 1.5 of the game however as a lot

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.950 
back in 1.5 of the game however as a lot
of<00:01:01.739> people<00:01:02.010> pointed<00:01:02.399> out<00:01:02.579> it<00:01:03.300> is<00:01:03.449> no<00:01:03.629> longer

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.859 
working at this time it is not working
and<00:01:06.299> so<00:01:07.200> there<00:01:07.740> is<00:01:07.920> another<00:01:08.310> mod<00:01:08.580> called

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869 
and so there is another mod called

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:11.060 
and so there is another mod called
acquisitive<00:01:09.869> soul<00:01:10.140> gems<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:10.740> I<00:01:10.830> have

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
acquisitive soul gems and I have

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.770 
acquisitive soul gems and I have
actually<00:01:11.250> switched<00:01:11.760> to<00:01:11.970> that<00:01:12.000> so<00:01:12.330> I<00:01:12.360> should

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
actually switched to that so I should

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.440 
actually switched to that so I should
have<00:01:12.930> been<00:01:13.189> showing<00:01:14.189> you<00:01:14.310> that<00:01:14.790> mod<00:01:15.000> instead

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
have been showing you that mod instead

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.499 
have been showing you that mod instead
it<00:01:15.689> does<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.229> same<00:01:16.530> thing<00:01:17.280> except<00:01:18.180> it<00:01:18.299> works

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
it does the same thing except it works

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:21.760 
it does the same thing except it works
for<00:01:18.869> the<00:01:19.140> 1.6<00:01:19.830> patch<00:01:20.100> and<00:01:20.369> it<00:01:20.909> doesn't<00:01:21.270> require

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:21.770 
for the 1.6 patch and it doesn't require

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.490 
for the 1.6 patch and it doesn't require
skse<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:23.369> so<00:01:23.549> that's<00:01:23.729> another<00:01:24.000> advantage<00:01:24.500> and

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
skse and so that's another advantage and

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.630 
skse and so that's another advantage and
I<00:01:25.710> do<00:01:25.830> apologize<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:27.060> the<00:01:27.270> mod<00:01:27.540> author<00:01:27.750> of
