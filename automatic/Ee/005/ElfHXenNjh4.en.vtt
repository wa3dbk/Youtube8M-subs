00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
rich Chinese I think it's be genius of

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.440 
rich Chinese I think it's be genius of
him<00:04:13.250> now<00:04:13.459> right<00:04:13.670> now<00:04:13.790> there<00:04:13.940> are<00:04:13.970> having<00:04:14.359> a

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
him now right now there are having a

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:16.270 
him now right now there are having a
little<00:04:14.660> issue<00:04:14.840> with<00:04:15.049> them<00:04:15.350> bringing<00:04:15.620> Tesla<00:04:16.130> in

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 
little issue with them bringing Tesla in

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:17.740 
little issue with them bringing Tesla in
there<00:04:16.850> saying<00:04:17.209> that<00:04:17.329> there's<00:04:17.510> another

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
there saying that there's another

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.990 
there saying that there's another
company<00:04:18.260> in<00:04:18.440> China<00:04:18.829> that<00:04:19.039> owns<00:04:19.280> that<00:04:19.549> name<00:04:19.789> I

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
company in China that owns that name I

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.789 
company in China that owns that name I
think<00:04:20.419> it's<00:04:20.510> a<00:04:20.570> very<00:04:20.720> small<00:04:21.079> hurdle<00:04:21.380> for<00:04:21.650> him

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:21.799 
think it's a very small hurdle for him

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:24.100 
think it's a very small hurdle for him
to<00:04:21.919> clear<00:04:22.190> they're<00:04:22.909> very<00:04:23.270> smart<00:04:23.659> over<00:04:23.990> at

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
to clear they're very smart over at

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.110 
to clear they're very smart over at
Tesla<00:04:24.590> and<00:04:24.770> if<00:04:25.099> they<00:04:25.250> can<00:04:25.400> work<00:04:25.580> around<00:04:25.760> our

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
Tesla and if they can work around our

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.450 
Tesla and if they can work around our
