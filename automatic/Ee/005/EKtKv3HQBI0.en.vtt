00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
foundation that a lot of people wear but

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.830 
foundation that a lot of people wear but
especially<00:00:22.560> it's<00:00:23.100> used<00:00:23.369> in<00:00:23.580> television<00:00:24.420> and

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
especially it's used in television and

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.560 
especially it's used in television and
theater<00:00:25.230> because<00:00:25.410> of<00:00:25.650> its<00:00:25.769> high<00:00:25.830> coverage<00:00:26.570> and

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
theater because of its high coverage and

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.109 
theater because of its high coverage and
I<00:00:27.660> absolutely<00:00:28.289> love<00:00:28.830> it<00:00:28.859> some<00:00:29.609> people<00:00:29.910> break

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
I absolutely love it some people break

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.790 
I absolutely love it some people break
out<00:00:30.330> from<00:00:30.539> it<00:00:30.660> so<00:00:30.840> you<00:00:30.900> probably<00:00:31.170> want<00:00:31.380> to<00:00:31.560> try

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
out from it so you probably want to try

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.350 
out from it so you probably want to try
it<00:00:31.830> before<00:00:32.099> you<00:00:32.340> go<00:00:32.730> and<00:00:32.850> purchase<00:00:33.030> it

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
it before you go and purchase it

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.479 
it before you go and purchase it
yourself<00:00:33.840> but<00:00:34.590> I<00:00:34.620> think<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:34.920> best<00:00:35.100> thing<00:00:35.250> with

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
yourself but I think the best thing with

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.010 
yourself but I think the best thing with
this<00:00:35.640> is<00:00:35.850> it<00:00:35.969> actually<00:00:36.090> matches<00:00:36.450> my<00:00:36.719> skin<00:00:36.780> tone

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
this is it actually matches my skin tone

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.680 
this is it actually matches my skin tone
really<00:00:37.620> well<00:00:37.860> which<00:00:38.129> is<00:00:38.340> unusual<00:00:38.520> because<00:00:39.239> a

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
really well which is unusual because a

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.959 
really well which is unusual because a
lot<00:00:40.290> of<00:00:40.320> foundations<00:00:41.040> are<00:00:41.190> either<00:00:41.399> too<00:00:41.700> dark

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
lot of foundations are either too dark

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.410 
lot of foundations are either too dark
or<00:00:42.210> too<00:00:42.300> yellow<00:00:43.110> toned<00:00:43.379> for<00:00:43.649> me<00:00:43.829> so<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:45.180> shade

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
or too yellow toned for me so the shade

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.350 
or too yellow toned for me so the shade
range<00:00:45.719> does<00:00:46.110> seem<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.379> be<00:00:46.559> quite<00:00:46.739> good<00:00:47.149> you<00:00:48.149> can

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
range does seem to be quite good you can

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.060 
range does seem to be quite good you can
wear<00:00:48.539> this<00:00:48.629> foundation<00:00:49.230> every<00:00:49.649> day<00:00:49.829> but<00:00:49.890> I

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
wear this foundation every day but I

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.920 
wear this foundation every day but I
only<00:00:50.309> wear<00:00:50.579> it<00:00:50.610> on<00:00:50.820> a<00:00:50.879> night<00:00:51.149> out<00:00:51.329> or<00:00:51.600> a<00:00:51.629> special

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
only wear it on a night out or a special

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.950 
only wear it on a night out or a special

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
that that's almost exactly the same is

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:55.379

00:02:58.359 --> 00:02:59.909 
and this is with the new noobs line
they've<00:02:58.659> added<00:02:59.049> but<00:02:59.230> if<00:02:59.319> I<00:02:59.439> just<00:02:59.650> put<00:02:59.799> those

00:02:59.909 --> 00:02:59.919 
they've added but if I just put those

00:02:59.919 --> 00:03:02.729 
they've added but if I just put those
together<00:03:00.159> for<00:03:00.549> you<00:03:00.730> they<00:03:01.569> are<00:03:01.900> pretty<00:03:02.500> much

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:02.739 
together for you they are pretty much

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:06.089 
together for you they are pretty much
identical<00:03:02.980> so<00:03:03.959> I'd<00:03:04.959> say<00:03:05.349> if<00:03:05.620> you<00:03:05.680> don't<00:03:05.980> want

I'm<00:03:17.709> sure<00:03:18.370> you've<00:03:18.669> heard<00:03:18.699> a<00:03:19.030> lot<00:03:19.209> about<00:03:19.239> this

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
I'm sure you've heard a lot about this

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:22.289 
I'm sure you've heard a lot about this
one<00:03:19.900> already<00:03:20.319> but<00:03:20.650> I<00:03:21.310> wear<00:03:21.609> this<00:03:21.790> every<00:03:22.269> day

00:03:22.289 --> 00:03:22.299 
one already but I wear this every day

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:24.330 
one already but I wear this every day
and<00:03:22.750> one<00:03:23.169> thing<00:03:23.199> I<00:03:23.409> do<00:03:23.470> like<00:03:23.709> to<00:03:23.739> do<00:03:23.979> with<00:03:24.099> it<00:03:24.220> is

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
and one thing I do like to do with it is

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.069 
and one thing I do like to do with it is
if<00:03:24.489> you<00:03:24.609> just<00:03:24.639> put<00:03:24.970> it<00:03:25.120> all<00:03:25.299> over<00:03:25.329> the<00:03:25.659> lid<00:03:25.690> and

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:26.079 
if you just put it all over the lid and

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:29.399 
if you just put it all over the lid and
then<00:03:26.139> use<00:03:26.470> a<00:03:26.500> 217<00:03:27.159> blending<00:03:27.430> brush<00:03:28.120> and<00:03:28.409> it

00:03:29.399 --> 00:03:29.409 
then use a 217 blending brush and it

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:31.649 
then use a 217 blending brush and it
actually<00:03:29.590> kind<00:03:30.069> of<00:03:30.189> gives<00:03:30.879> a<00:03:31.030> different<00:03:31.209> tone

00:03:31.649 --> 00:03:31.659 
actually kind of gives a different tone

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:33.240 
actually kind of gives a different tone
within<00:03:32.049> the<00:03:32.169> crease<00:03:32.439> which<00:03:32.650> is<00:03:32.799> really<00:03:33.010> cool

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
within the crease which is really cool

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:34.649 
within the crease which is really cool
because<00:03:33.430> it<00:03:33.669> looks<00:03:33.879> like<00:03:34.000> you're<00:03:34.120> wearing<00:03:34.359> two

00:03:34.649 --> 00:03:34.659 
because it looks like you're wearing two

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:35.879 
because it looks like you're wearing two
eye<00:03:34.689> shadows<00:03:35.169> and<00:03:35.290> you've<00:03:35.409> put<00:03:35.620> a<00:03:35.650> lot<00:03:35.739> of

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:35.889 
eye shadows and you've put a lot of

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:39.119 
eye shadows and you've put a lot of
