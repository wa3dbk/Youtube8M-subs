inch group steel horses have been in 4h

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.369 
inch group steel horses have been in 4h
for<00:00:05.640> nine<00:00:05.819> years<00:00:05.850> now<00:00:06.299> this<00:00:06.690> will<00:00:06.839> be<00:00:06.930> my<00:00:07.080> 10th

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
for nine years now this will be my 10th

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:15.220 
for nine years now this will be my 10th
this<00:00:08.069> is<00:00:08.280> my<00:00:08.400> Morgan<00:00:08.790> rusty<00:00:13.790> use<00:00:14.790> for

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:15.230 
this is my Morgan rusty use for

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:17.630 
this is my Morgan rusty use for
maintaining<00:00:16.230> light<00:00:16.590> contact<00:00:17.070> on<00:00:17.340> the<00:00:17.430> bit

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
maintaining light contact on the bit

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.820 
maintaining light contact on the bit
while<00:00:17.970> moving<00:00:18.270> freely<00:00:18.630> it<00:00:19.380> helps<00:00:19.650> them<00:00:19.800> learn

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
while moving freely it helps them learn

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.769 
while moving freely it helps them learn
how<00:00:20.039> to<00:00:20.189> balance<00:00:20.490> and<00:00:20.910> move<00:00:21.060> straight<00:00:21.300> forward

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
how to balance and move straight forward

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.070 
how to balance and move straight forward
so<00:00:22.710> what<00:00:22.890> I<00:00:22.920> do<00:00:23.100> is<00:00:23.640> I<00:00:24.210> take<00:00:24.390> the<00:00:24.600> lunge<00:00:24.840> line

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
so what I do is I take the lunge line

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.470 
so what I do is I take the lunge line
and<00:00:25.380> go<00:00:25.500> through<00:00:25.800> a<00:00:26.160> snaffle<00:00:26.760> bit<00:00:27.090> you<00:00:27.269> only

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
and go through a snaffle bit you only

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.019 
and go through a snaffle bit you only
want<00:00:27.750> to<00:00:27.810> use<00:00:27.869> a<00:00:27.960> snaffle<00:00:28.410> I<00:00:28.830> go<00:00:29.609> through<00:00:29.910> the

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
want to use a snaffle I go through the

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:32.389 
want to use a snaffle I go through the
bit<00:00:30.210> over<00:00:30.660> his<00:00:30.810> pool<00:00:31.109> and<00:00:31.470> connect<00:00:32.160> on<00:00:32.279> the

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
bit over his pool and connect on the

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.830 
bit over his pool and connect on the
other<00:00:32.550> side<00:00:32.820> right<00:00:34.340> here<00:00:35.480> you<00:00:36.480> want<00:00:36.660> to<00:00:36.690> have

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
other side right here you want to have

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.810 
other side right here you want to have
the<00:00:37.020> clip<00:00:37.469> facing<00:00:37.920> outwards<00:00:38.280> so<00:00:38.399> it<00:00:38.550> doesn't

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
the clip facing outwards so it doesn't

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.900 
the clip facing outwards so it doesn't
poke<00:00:38.940> them<00:00:39.120> in<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.239> face<00:00:40.309> and<00:00:41.309> then<00:00:41.489> you<00:00:41.670> want

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
poke them in the face and then you want

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.479 
poke them in the face and then you want
to<00:00:42.030> connect<00:00:42.629> your<00:00:43.020> side<00:00:43.320> reins<00:00:43.559> they<00:00:44.040> can<00:00:44.250> be

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
to connect your side reins they can be

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.529 
to connect your side reins they can be
leather<00:00:45.420> or<00:00:46.110> elastic<00:00:46.770> I<00:00:47.390> recommend<00:00:48.390> using

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
leather or elastic I recommend using

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:50.810 
leather or elastic I recommend using
elastic<00:00:48.930> for<00:00:49.440> new<00:00:49.620> horses<00:00:49.980> so<00:00:50.399> that<00:00:50.550> it<00:00:50.670> gives

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
elastic for new horses so that it gives

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.340 
elastic for new horses so that it gives
a<00:00:50.940> little<00:00:51.149> gift<00:00:51.360> when<00:00:51.629> they're<00:00:51.750> just<00:00:51.899> learning

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
a little gift when they're just learning

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.920 
a little gift when they're just learning
