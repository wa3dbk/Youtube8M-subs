Brian the called the cat of the air

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.810 
Brian the called the cat of the air
because<00:01:06.390> they're<00:01:06.570> not<00:01:06.810> cats<00:01:07.409> the<00:01:08.189> owls<00:01:08.400> they

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
because they're not cats the owls they

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.000 
because they're not cats the owls they
