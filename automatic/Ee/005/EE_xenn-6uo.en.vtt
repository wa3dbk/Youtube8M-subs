here's<00:00:11.849> the<00:00:12.090> thing<00:00:12.360> that<00:00:12.389> makes<00:00:12.780> life<00:00:13.080> so

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
here's the thing that makes life so

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.160 
here's the thing that makes life so
interesting<00:00:14.299> the<00:00:15.299> theory<00:00:15.750> of<00:00:15.780> evolution

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
interesting the theory of evolution

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.179 
interesting the theory of evolution
claims<00:00:16.949> only<00:00:17.430> the<00:00:17.580> strong<00:00:17.640> shall<00:00:18.300> survive

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:19.189 
claims only the strong shall survive

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:24.769 
claims only the strong shall survive
maybe<00:00:20.189> so<00:00:20.520> maybe<00:00:21.050> so<00:00:23.119> but<00:00:24.119> the<00:00:24.269> theory<00:00:24.750> of

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
maybe so maybe so but the theory of

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.529 
maybe so maybe so but the theory of
competition<00:00:25.680> says<00:00:25.949> just<00:00:26.820> because<00:00:26.880> they're

competition says just because they're

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.419 
competition says just because they're
the<00:00:27.570> strong<00:00:28.050> doesn't<00:00:28.439> mean<00:00:28.650> they<00:00:28.920> can't<00:00:29.220> get

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
the strong doesn't mean they can't get

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.620 
the strong doesn't mean they can't get
their<00:00:29.609> asses<00:00:29.880> kicked<00:00:30.650> that's<00:00:31.650> right<00:00:32.329> see<00:00:33.329> what

may<00:00:42.300> be<00:00:42.329> stacked<00:00:42.480> against<00:00:43.230> you<00:00:43.379> fair<00:00:43.710> enough

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.280 
may be stacked against you fair enough

but<00:00:45.699> what<00:00:45.820> the<00:00:45.940> odds<00:00:46.059> don't<00:00:46.510> know<00:00:46.860> is<00:00:47.860> this

00:00:48.209 --> 00:00:48.219 
but what the odds don't know is this

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:52.020 
but what the odds don't know is this
isn't<00:00:48.940> a<00:00:49.000> math<00:00:49.210> test<00:00:50.129> this<00:00:51.129> is<00:00:51.460> a<00:00:51.519> completely

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 
isn't a math test this is a completely

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:55.829 
isn't a math test this is a completely
different<00:00:52.690> kind<00:00:52.989> of<00:00:53.199> test<00:00:53.879> one<00:00:54.879> where<00:00:55.180> passion

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:55.839 
different kind of test one where passion

00:00:55.839 --> 00:01:00.350 
different kind of test one where passion
has<00:00:56.440> a<00:00:57.100> funny<00:00:57.489> way<00:00:57.610> of<00:00:57.760> trumping<00:00:58.360> logic

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:00.360 
has a funny way of trumping logic

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.600 
has a funny way of trumping logic
so<00:01:00.930> before<00:01:01.080> you<00:01:01.380> step<00:01:01.680> up<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:01.950> the<00:01:02.100> starting

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:02.610 
so before you step up to the starting

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.230 
so before you step up to the starting
line<00:01:03.559> before<00:01:04.559> the<00:01:04.890> whistle<00:01:05.070> blows<00:01:05.520> and<00:01:05.790> the

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
line before the whistle blows and the

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.110 
line before the whistle blows and the
clock<00:01:06.480> starts<00:01:06.510> ticking<00:01:07.400> just<00:01:08.400> remember<00:01:08.910> out

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:09.120 
clock starts ticking just remember out

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:15.860 
clock starts ticking just remember out
here<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:10.560> results<00:01:11.010> don't<00:01:11.220> always<00:01:11.550> add<00:01:11.760> up

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:15.870

may have predicted when the race is on
all<00:01:23.550> bets<00:01:24.120> are<00:01:24.390> off<00:01:25.310> don't<00:01:26.310> be<00:01:26.430> surprised<00:01:26.940> if

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
all bets are off don't be surprised if

all bets are off don't be surprised if
somebody<00:01:27.510> decides<00:01:27.870> to<00:01:28.200> flip<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.980> script<00:01:29.280> and

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
somebody decides to flip the script and

somebody decides to flip the script and
take<00:01:30.150> a<00:01:30.180> pass<00:01:30.600> on<00:01:30.990> yelling<00:01:31.650> uncle

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
take a pass on yelling uncle

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.469
