00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.910
 first time 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:41.899
 so how could we do it 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.899
 could say m 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.809
 t 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.410
 we put helmets that if we put our 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:58.010
 three of the barbarians 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.890
 m arche france she named him 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.520
 the archers to describe these markets there 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.520
 it's a format 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.650
 should do it all surely furious 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.600
 It will be ok 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.670
 little limb there are some bends that have 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.400
 look hard and there we actually look 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.100
 I use and rep find I was using a 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.000
 dozens of archers during a score 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.100
 archers 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.380
 twelve giants and 4 breaks bricks and one 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.470
 could have thought except it's a lot 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.510
 harder stop so who realized this 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:32.360
 village that finally you are not very 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:34.940
 difficult we even nap and 

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:37.370
 get worse in just flagship game but 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.770
