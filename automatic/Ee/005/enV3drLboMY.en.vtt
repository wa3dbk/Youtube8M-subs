Google's<00:01:56.040> developer<00:01:56.430> site<00:01:56.880> I<00:01:57.149> have<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.719> link

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
Google's developer site I have the link

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.660 
Google's developer site I have the link
for<00:01:58.020> that<00:01:58.140> in<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.350> tutorial<00:01:58.920> as<00:01:59.009> well<00:01:59.040> but<00:01:59.549> one

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
for that in the tutorial as well but one

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:00.709 
for that in the tutorial as well but one
thing<00:01:59.820> you<00:01:59.850> can<00:02:00.000> do<00:02:00.090> is<00:02:00.210> you<00:02:00.270> can<00:02:00.329> adjust<00:02:00.450> the

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
thing you can do is you can adjust the

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:04.780 
thing you can do is you can adjust the
time<00:02:00.899> limit<00:02:01.259> so<00:02:01.740> you<00:02:02.189> can<00:02:02.399> type<00:02:02.610> in<00:02:02.820> a<00:02:03.090> DB<00:02:03.450> space

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:04.790 
time limit so you can type in a DB space

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.270 
time limit so you can type in a DB space
shells<00:02:05.790> screen<00:02:06.659> record

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
shells screen record

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.660 
shells screen record
well<00:02:08.520> one<00:02:08.700> word<00:02:08.880> again<00:02:09.149> and<00:02:09.690> then<00:02:10.290> space<00:02:10.740> to

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
well one word again and then space to

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.760 
well one word again and then space to
dashes<00:02:12.120> and<00:02:12.360> we<00:02:12.630> can<00:02:12.780> set<00:02:12.960> the<00:02:13.050> time<00:02:13.260> limit<00:02:13.290> in

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
dashes and we can set the time limit in

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:18.610 
dashes and we can set the time limit in
seconds<00:02:14.490> so<00:02:14.580> I'll<00:02:14.670> type<00:02:14.820> in<00:02:15.000> time<00:02:15.380> -<00:02:16.380> limit<00:02:17.390> and

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
seconds so I'll type in time - limit and

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.230 
seconds so I'll type in time - limit and
then<00:02:19.620> you<00:02:20.160> type<00:02:20.370> in<00:02:20.490> however<00:02:20.640> many<00:02:20.760> seconds

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
then you type in however many seconds

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:22.940 
then you type in however many seconds
you<00:02:21.390> want<00:02:21.480> to<00:02:21.630> be<00:02:21.750> so<00:02:22.020> 60<00:02:22.440> seconds<00:02:22.740> would<00:02:22.800> be<00:02:22.920> a

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
you want to be so 60 seconds would be a

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:31.210 
you want to be so 60 seconds would be a
minute<00:02:24.080> 60<00:02:25.080> and<00:02:25.320> then<00:02:26.390> space<00:02:27.390> slash<00:02:28.520> sdcard

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
minute 60 and then space slash sdcard

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:33.440 
minute 60 and then space slash sdcard
slash<00:02:32.220> and<00:02:32.520> then<00:02:32.610> whatever<00:02:32.940> file<00:02:33.180> name<00:02:33.360> you

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
slash and then whatever file name you

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.720 
slash and then whatever file name you
want<00:02:33.630> it<00:02:33.690> to<00:02:33.780> be<00:02:34.130> again<00:02:35.130> I'm<00:02:35.250> just<00:02:35.340> gonna<00:02:35.580> say

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
want it to be again I'm just gonna say

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.820 
want it to be again I'm just gonna say
demo<00:02:36.000> dot<00:02:36.360> mp4<00:02:36.690> but<00:02:37.080> you<00:02:37.530> want<00:02:37.650> to<00:02:37.710> make<00:02:37.800> sure

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:37.830 
demo dot mp4 but you want to make sure

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:40.550 
demo dot mp4 but you want to make sure
that<00:02:38.100> you<00:02:38.280> name<00:02:38.550> it<00:02:38.760> different<00:02:39.480> file<00:02:39.600> names<00:02:39.810> so

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
that you name it different file names so

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.500 
that you name it different file names so
that<00:02:40.590> you<00:02:40.830> don't<00:02:41.040> delete<00:02:41.400> the<00:02:42.180> file<00:02:42.360> that

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:42.510 
that you don't delete the file that

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:44.530 
that you don't delete the file that
you've<00:02:42.660> already<00:02:42.780> made<00:02:43.020> and<00:02:43.650> then<00:02:43.770> hit<00:02:43.950> enter

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
you've already made and then hit enter

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.970 
you've already made and then hit enter
so<00:02:45.540> now<00:02:45.690> it's<00:02:45.840> recording<00:02:46.200> it<00:02:46.260> for<00:02:46.290> 60<00:02:46.650> seconds

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
so now it's recording it for 60 seconds

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:47.449 
so now it's recording it for 60 seconds
again

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
again

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.730

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
just it's a little clunky because you

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.440 
just it's a little clunky because you
have<00:03:01.770> to<00:03:01.860> make<00:03:01.980> sure<00:03:02.130> your<00:03:02.280> microUSB<00:03:03.090> cables

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
have to make sure your microUSB cables

have to make sure your microUSB cables
connected<00:03:03.840> to<00:03:03.870> your<00:03:04.050> phone<00:03:04.260> at<00:03:04.410> all<00:03:04.500> times<00:03:04.740> but

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
connected to your phone at all times but

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:06.740 
connected to your phone at all times but
