lighter which is why I like it to be on

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.590 
lighter which is why I like it to be on
with<00:00:36.670> a<00:00:36.699> little<00:00:36.879> too<00:00:36.970> dark<00:00:37.150> for<00:00:37.210> me<00:00:37.360> so<00:00:37.540> I

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:37.600 
with a little too dark for me so I

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.149 
with a little too dark for me so I
strained<00:00:37.900> it<00:00:38.049> so<00:00:38.229> i<00:00:38.260> would<00:00:38.409> have<00:00:38.589> curls<00:00:38.920> like

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:39.159 
strained it so i would have curls like

00:00:39.159 --> 00:00:41.460 
strained it so i would have curls like
all<00:00:39.400> on<00:00:39.850> my<00:00:40.030> face<00:00:40.239> but<00:00:40.900> this<00:00:41.019> one's<00:00:41.290> a<00:00:41.379> little

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:41.470 
all on my face but this one's a little

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:42.810 
all on my face but this one's a little
bit<00:00:41.650> later<00:00:41.830> that's<00:00:42.159> why<00:00:42.220> i<00:00:42.309> like<00:00:42.519> it<00:00:42.670> better

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:42.820 
bit later that's why i like it better

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.060 
bit later that's why i like it better
and<00:00:43.150> i<00:00:43.870> think<00:00:44.049> i'll<00:00:44.350> leave<00:00:44.440> the<00:00:44.530> curls<00:00:44.769> in<00:00:44.949> will

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.070 
and i think i'll leave the curls in will

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.009 
and i think i'll leave the curls in will
have<00:00:45.370> to<00:00:45.640> because<00:00:45.970> it's<00:00:46.120> not<00:00:46.269> really<00:00:46.510> keep

00:00:47.009 --> 00:00:47.019 
have to because it's not really keep

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:49.609 
have to because it's not really keep
safe<00:00:47.320> there<00:00:47.949> is<00:00:48.040> a<00:00:48.070> way<00:00:48.280> you<00:00:48.309> can<00:00:48.430> style<00:00:48.909> um

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:51.840

synthetic<00:00:50.619> ones<00:00:50.739> that<00:00:50.949> aren't<00:00:51.159> heat<00:00:51.309> safe<00:00:51.549> um

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.400 
maybe even a little less so I pulled up
a<00:01:21.520> little<00:01:21.880> bit<00:01:22.000> of<00:01:22.060> my<00:01:22.150> own<00:01:22.300> hair<00:01:22.630> and<00:01:22.810> then

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:23.410 
a little bit of my own hair and then

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:25.710 
a little bit of my own hair and then
parted<00:01:23.890> it<00:01:24.040> line<00:01:24.820> the<00:01:25.030> part<00:01:25.240> up<00:01:25.360> you<00:01:25.540> don't

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:25.720 
parted it line the part up you don't

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.920 
parted it line the part up you don't
have<00:01:25.870> to<00:01:26.020> do<00:01:26.110> that<00:01:26.140> um<00:01:26.940> understood<00:01:27.940> why<00:01:28.720> not

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:28.930 
have to do that um understood why not

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.770 
have to do that um understood why not
right<00:01:29.200> so<00:01:30.070> that's<00:01:31.030> the<00:01:31.360> way<00:01:31.480> through<00:01:31.750> the

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
right so that's the way through the

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:37.290 
right so that's the way through the
front<00:01:33.270> I'll<00:01:34.270> show<00:01:34.480> you<00:01:34.540> the<00:01:34.659> side<00:01:36.060> and<00:01:37.060> I'll

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:37.300

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:39.970 
talk to the back so you can give it a

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:43.340

favorite but I really do like it's got a
very<00:01:49.990> good<00:01:50.260> texture<00:01:50.880> very<00:01:51.880> soft<00:01:52.330> um<00:01:53.490> it<00:01:54.490> feels

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:54.760 
very good texture very soft um it feels

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.560 
very good texture very soft um it feels
pretty<00:01:55.470> natural<00:01:56.470> almost<00:01:56.770> like<00:01:56.890> human<00:01:57.220> hair<00:01:57.570> as

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:58.570 
pretty natural almost like human hair as

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.620 
pretty natural almost like human hair as
far<00:01:58.810> as<00:01:59.050> the<00:01:59.320> streaks<00:01:59.560> of<00:01:59.680> 27<00:02:00.340> there<00:02:01.120> um

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:01.630 
far as the streaks of 27 there um

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:03.930 
far as the streaks of 27 there um
depends<00:02:02.590> where<00:02:02.710> you<00:02:02.800> parted<00:02:03.220> I<00:02:03.400> had<00:02:03.670> to<00:02:03.790> kind

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 
depends where you parted I had to kind

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.340 
depends where you parted I had to kind
of<00:02:04.060> find<00:02:04.270> that<00:02:04.480> it's<00:02:04.600> about<00:02:04.720> the<00:02:04.840> part<00:02:05.080> where

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
of find that it's about the part where

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.530 
of find that it's about the part where
they<00:02:05.440> were<00:02:05.500> more<00:02:05.740> dispersed<00:02:06.360> because<00:02:07.360> they're

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:07.540 
they were more dispersed because they're

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.480 
they were more dispersed because they're
in<00:02:07.690> kind<00:02:07.930> of<00:02:08.050> bigger<00:02:08.260> streaks<00:02:08.860> so<00:02:09.310> it<00:02:09.460> really

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:09.490 
in kind of bigger streaks so it really

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:12.300 
in kind of bigger streaks so it really
depends<00:02:10.090> how<00:02:10.270> you<00:02:10.300> like<00:02:10.660> it<00:02:10.690> um<00:02:11.530> and<00:02:11.800> where<00:02:12.190> you

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
depends how you like it um and where you

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.640 
depends how you like it um and where you
part<00:02:12.640> it<00:02:12.730> on<00:02:12.940> how<00:02:13.180> much<00:02:13.420> 27<00:02:14.140> will<00:02:14.290> be<00:02:14.410> showing

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
part it on how much 27 will be showing

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.430 
part it on how much 27 will be showing
so<00:02:15.190> I<00:02:15.220> did<00:02:15.430> it<00:02:15.550> so<00:02:15.760> um<00:02:16.180> had<00:02:16.750> less<00:02:16.990> of<00:02:17.230> an<00:02:17.320> impact

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440 
so I did it so um had less of an impact

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.650 
so I did it so um had less of an impact
but<00:02:18.010> you<00:02:18.160> can<00:02:18.310> part<00:02:18.580> it<00:02:18.640> you<00:02:19.150> know<00:02:19.270> and<00:02:19.300> another

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
but you can part it you know and another

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.570 
but you can part it you know and another
spot<00:02:20.020> and<00:02:20.230> they'll<00:02:20.380> just<00:02:20.710> be<00:02:20.890> like<00:02:20.920> pretty

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
spot and they'll just be like pretty

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.880 
spot and they'll just be like pretty
streaks<00:02:22.060> so<00:02:22.360> depends<00:02:22.780> how<00:02:22.870> you<00:02:22.900> like<00:02:23.170> it<00:02:23.200> in

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:23.890 
streaks so depends how you like it in

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.280 
streaks so depends how you like it in
your<00:02:24.070> skin<00:02:24.340> tone<00:02:24.580> you<00:02:24.850> know<00:02:24.910> how<00:02:25.150> much<00:02:25.390> 27-year

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
your skin tone you know how much 27-year

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.430 
your skin tone you know how much 27-year
skin<00:02:26.530> tone<00:02:26.770> can<00:02:27.010> handle<00:02:27.430> so<00:02:27.730> um<00:02:28.450> this<00:02:29.140> is<00:02:29.290> how<00:02:29.410> I

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
skin tone can handle so um this is how I

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.550 
skin tone can handle so um this is how I
parted<00:02:29.830> it<00:02:29.980> and<00:02:30.880> I<00:02:31.570> think<00:02:31.810> if<00:02:31.930> I<00:02:32.020> had<00:02:32.050> a<00:02:32.230> flash

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
parted it and I think if I had a flash

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.890 
parted it and I think if I had a flash
cap<00:02:32.890> underneath<00:02:33.400> like<00:02:33.610> a<00:02:33.670> flash<00:02:33.970> color<00:02:34.570> one

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
cap underneath like a flash color one

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:36.930 
cap underneath like a flash color one
that's<00:02:35.200> getting<00:02:35.320> tone<00:02:35.590> colored<00:02:35.890> one<00:02:36.040> it<00:02:36.250> might

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:36.940 
that's getting tone colored one it might

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.880 
that's getting tone colored one it might
even<00:02:36.970> stand<00:02:37.720> out<00:02:37.900> more<00:02:37.930> I<00:02:38.350> haven't<00:02:38.620> tried<00:02:38.860> it

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
even stand out more I haven't tried it

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.640 
even stand out more I haven't tried it
yet<00:02:39.010> I<00:02:39.430> just<00:02:40.270> have<00:02:40.420> a<00:02:40.450> net<00:02:40.660> one<00:02:40.900> underneath<00:02:41.410> it

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
yet I just have a net one underneath it

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.520 
yet I just have a net one underneath it

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
say it has two side columns and one in

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.740 
say it has two side columns and one in
the<00:02:49.570> back<00:02:49.660> and<00:02:50.140> then<00:02:50.260> the<00:02:50.380> adjustable<00:02:50.830> strap
