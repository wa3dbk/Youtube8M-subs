00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:08.080
 Yes, let's go negative Here we will study in detail about negative 

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:12.160
 You do it once at the meeting 

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:15.820
 The designation of t means that it is not d 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:19.740
 As we did in the group, we will use a bar to indicate denial 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:27.450
 I expressed to like p bar such Fu 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:29.190
 Let's take a look at it right now x = 0-4 Periodic x is not zero so why not x 

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:34.080
 not = 0 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:38.340
 That is not because it is not zero or as such writing how to buy 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:40.510
 There is also this and it becomes very easy to understand if it thinks with the number straight line 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:45.850
 x is 0 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:46.870
 The negation of this is that x is not zero or anything other than zero. 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.170
 In other words 

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:55.180
 x less than 0 or x less than 0 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:59.920
 Even though it is written, it is ok. It means that it is the number of earnings with grass . 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:01.000
 In the x Dinah Lee call City of I Tsugiko'm easy to understand and also think about the number line 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:05.830
 is not it 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:09.670
 It is a common mistake to say that Shibata Linaly city is not 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:14.560
 x It's less than 1 answer 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:18.910
 This is wrong and why there is = here 

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:22.300
 Also denied that the first made as x can be seen If you think in the number line because 

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:25.820
 Since x is Ya negation of it a number greater than 1 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:32.720
 Temporary that'm not a number greater than 1 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:34.990
 You will also include yourself in the position or within a small number of negatives x 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.610
 Become smaller than 1 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:40.790
 This is amazing 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:45.920
 The beginning is where say please by all means by all means take care of amateur depreciation 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:51.470
 The next was well coming out of and comes out may be attached to the denial of or if this win 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:52.400
 Specifying and say conclusion also and want fun in the hole if Morgan on this basis with'm win 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.460
 But it was law 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:58.490
 Say whether was doing what I law of Morgan 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:03.840
 p Katsukyu of this 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:05.710
 Well it's a denial It 's a p-bar or something to say 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:11.490
 9th 

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:13.870
 It's now p also or p or grade leaves became sucker 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:17.379
 The specification of p Maa and Accu is 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:21.459
 p Bar katsu It became a Cubar. 

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:26.680
 But please review the how of Morgan law moving people say that this Nan Kotcha 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:32.200
 Here we doing in light of it in the fact that anymore master sleep it 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:33.890
 Katsuno denial or cheap cheap people will win, so this is also an important place 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.330
 See you later in a small respect issue 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:39.110
 To go 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:44.870
 Next, this is also a small application problem that comes out a bit 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:50.690
 Selling Toka What happens if all of x and of expression that say all there Toka representation I 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:55.319
 Denial of words that say said to Once there Moshiku It is what rx is to it x is 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:58.980
 All x 's use this self - proclaimed idea though 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:03.359
 Because I kinda To explain that in detail a rear inn Nante in that 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:05.730
 People of avia cr is in all of but it is such not difficult for all of the other This 

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:08.760
 I think that it is easier to remember 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:14.110
 Let's look at specific problems based on the above 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:17.420
 If the states deny the past one of the following conditions where xi is the eye is an integer to real 

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:22.910
 First of all, x is the number of women 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:28.220
 When the well town and of this is the number that is ne star would answer me be of x support students 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:29.959
 But that's different or zero as it is necessary, as I said earlier 

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:34.400
 It is easy to understand if you think 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:37.410
 It is a good small number to say that x is the number of women is zero 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:42.810
 When it is specified , 0 itself is included 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:47.940
 rc 0 Both p numbers are naturally included, that is, x goal goal zero 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:50.490
 If this is written, it will become like x number of stars or zero. 

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:54.810
 It is a place to say 

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:59.460
 Next is a call January b This is the denial of the cast massa that I went to earlier 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:02.190
 I and also to also first and later of 1 This designation from the meeting that's capital since the position of a 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:05.230
 And designation of Cars or 

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:09.159
 Debbie efficiency people are not equal 1 

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:12.489
 It is easy Once Why familiar anymore What ok I'm made in this kind of wind 

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:18.070
 The third is also together forever becoming 0 and becoming a beader 0 

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:22.479
 If it comes to specification of this, it will be ai first and negation of zero will be cast = 0 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:24.740
 If the negation of the other wins b then the zero person will be b = 0 = 0 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:30.050
 So the answer is this 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:33.680
 ok it's the next 4 bars it's too easy to think of this with a number line 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:37.520
 -2 庄 庄 x and re-to 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:41.120
 It is such a situation, this is xl and this specification 

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:47.900
 x is or more tiny to minus 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:53.670
 X time because it also included Mr. larger than the number of acid answer Egg Small becomes -2 or Nari Chapter 3 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:57.660
 This This -2 Chapter no When you have to write a sentence in it if I'm made to wind Boy Tteyuu 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:05:03.840
 Selfish say comes to what kind of representation of 30 days without test 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:07.980
 -2 Chapter Nari time x and I from this negative Ya is x Sho哉's 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:12.670
 - Chapter 2 Nari around x- and it is x next to minus I do and say what happens is 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:17.260
 A person of life or later in the ward Matsuya 's person or Yamazaki = x 

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:18.840
 It 's ok that's the way it's just I'm alone I know this is a number straight highway 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:23.220
 I think it is easy 

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:26.880
 Next multiple of 13 and not multiple of 4 

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:32.910
 It's a little king this is what it means after all 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:38.460
 It means that a certain number is a multiple of 3 and not a multiple of 4 

00:05:32.910 --> 00:05:38.860
 Not that after all multiples of 3 and multiples of 3 when considering the wind Tteyuu this is win Nde 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:45.060
 Cutlet 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:47.520
 And or not a multiple of 3 or a multiple of 4 is a multiple of 4 from the house 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:53.270
 Is it ok ? 

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:55.160
 Also No. 6 say kiss Tomo It is together that is m is an odd number cutlet 

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:58.460
 n is also odd 

00:05:55.160 --> 00:06:02.270
 It is said that this specification is m is even 

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:07.040
 Or n is even 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:11.449
 In this same meaning Ya that it and also win after all the Tteyuu roots Re be at Toka both 

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:16.370
 Boatlow Please train well to give such an answer 

00:06:11.449 --> 00:06:19.639
 It 's OK. It's an application problem that uses Sankei and all and n's denial at the airport . 

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:24.680
 Rise to zero for all real numbers x 

00:06:19.639 --> 00:06:29.060
 The negation of this first becomes r from all negations about some real number x 

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:33.410
 If you rise to x and then go to zero, this person will be x2 female general = 0 

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:36.360
 It is easy once you get used = I just say I would beware not to forget 

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:42.810
 Agree to x for No. 2 is also with r real number x 

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:48.120
 Lexus looks good There's no real There's all the sound about all real x 

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:49.080
 x2 square welfare I'm made to wind Tteyuu If it is not = x + brother from the house Te ok 

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:53.550
 Is not it 

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:56.380
 So I learned about denial here, meaning I am not denial Tina 

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:57.569
 I guess this is p patty 

00:06:56.380 --> 00:07:03.089
 Hmm 

00:06:57.569 --> 00:07:07.709
 Oaza Nakatsu and the negation of the matter is do not you of the law enabled with Morgan also also § of people and and 

00:07:03.089 --> 00:07:08.550
 It is said that as an applied problem all people will be used to a certain day or all 

00:07:07.709 --> 00:07:12.179
 It was 

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:14.449
 Find your leader and practice well as you can in the delivery zone by yourself 

00:07:12.179 --> 00:07:14.449
 Let's go
