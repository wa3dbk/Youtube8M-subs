00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
was so super duper pretty it's kind of

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.139 
was so super duper pretty it's kind of
like<00:00:45.329> a<00:00:45.450> sky<00:00:45.840> blue<00:00:46.489> with<00:00:47.489> more<00:00:47.700> like<00:00:47.879> cool

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
like a sky blue with more like cool

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.760 
like a sky blue with more like cool
undertones<00:00:48.750> than<00:00:49.020> normal<00:00:49.320> which<00:00:49.469> is<00:00:49.500> why<00:00:49.739> i

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
undertones than normal which is why i

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:50.930 
undertones than normal which is why i
liked<00:00:50.039> it<00:00:50.129> i<00:00:50.250> thought<00:00:50.430> it<00:00:50.520> was<00:00:50.610> a<00:00:50.670> little<00:00:50.789> bit

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
liked it i thought it was a little bit

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.910 
liked it i thought it was a little bit
more<00:00:51.120> unique<00:00:51.600> than<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:52.110> typical<00:00:52.230> like<00:00:52.710> light

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
more unique than the typical like light

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.119 
more unique than the typical like light
blue<00:00:53.600> so<00:00:54.600> i<00:00:54.629> really<00:00:55.020> really<00:00:55.230> like<00:00:55.500> that<00:00:55.739> and

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
blue so i really really like that and

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.760 
blue so i really really like that and
then<00:00:57.030> another<00:00:57.270> blue<00:00:57.570> color<00:00:57.840> that<00:00:58.079> I<00:00:58.109> got<00:00:58.379> was

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
then another blue color that I got was

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.029 
then another blue color that I got was
why<00:00:59.190> not<00:00:59.489> and<00:01:00.350> it<00:01:01.350> made<00:01:01.469> me<00:01:01.500> think<00:01:01.770> of<00:01:01.800> hilary

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039
