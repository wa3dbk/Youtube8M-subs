00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.570
 and said 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.700
 one of the worst moments of his 

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.920
 history suffered colo colo with the 

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:20.380
 elimination of the South American cup 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.419
 hand of sporty grass the 2 to 0 in 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.849
 against in the monumental against 15000 

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:27.130
 disappointed spectators unleashed another 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:29.050
 time the complaints and the chants against 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.930
 of black and white that this year have been 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.700
 usual in the 'monumental' stadium and 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:36.040
 the alba crisis so far is always 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.200
 everything for the routine of comedian yerko 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.070
 puchento in the channel vertigo program 

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.559
 13 

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:45.320
 today I want to talk about the 1000 days 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:48.370
 most terrible of this story 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:51.290
 but not from the program of chava case no 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.950
 but of the last three years of colo 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.580
 colo 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:57.860
 in my days they turned the club into a 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:59.750
 charitable foundation that will dress the 

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:02.120
 footballer and brought more bad of the 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:05.030
 history of mankind 9 colo colo 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.500
 do not be chile but if it is the refuge of 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.020
 thousands and thousands of Chileans who carry a 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.270
 work sacrifice life of 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.070
 effort that the transantiago suck 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.840
 every day that they suck the meter like 

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.300
 sardines that suck a salary 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.890
 shit and a retirement for laughter that 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.560
 you take in the club what they do and what 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.479
 match all the chicken véliz and that by 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.520
 I respect the children of Valdés who 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:28.369
 they made the club great to return the 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.800
 dignity to the people something just president 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:33.890
 with the blue heart as is the never 

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:35.320
 But do not divide it by charges no more 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.030
 dispute for shares in the stock market 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.610
 we want actions but actions within 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:43.530
 of the soccer field 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.690
 the actor who plays that comedian 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.270
 is Daniel Alcaíno recognized fanatic 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:51.270
 of the cacique and he has never hidden his 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.890
 uneasiness about the fall of colo colo 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.840
 I hope the moment is going colo 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.240
 what they do to colo colo 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.910
 they make chile the colo colo is chile chile 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.890
 that this reflects that when the 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:04.530
 money by mafias 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.910
 sports people forget the town looked 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.729
 the people who come to the stadium that suffers 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:11.580
 with the team and I would also say that the 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.800
 footballers has seen the result jog 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:16.260
 on the court they are treating that then 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.210
 I think colo colo from the town 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.090
 black and white of them that leave 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:23.100
 them those words reflect the feeling 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.020
 widespread of fans albos 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.630
 who are not champions from the 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.690
 closing 2009 and on its return to the field 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.740
 international ended up giving pity 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:34.380
 we even lack the fans that 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:36.690
 they maintain that it is being attempted from 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.030
 within the same club against the cacique 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.650
 we suspect as a fan that 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.060
 the people in the classroom are the forests 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.080
 they infiltrate black and white because it is a 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.239
 too much mistakes 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.069
 too much fails more the approaches 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.900
 Bad players standing on the court 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:50.370
 from there black and white part we have 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.769
 next to infiltrators we have the suspicion 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.659
 one thing a bad directive management and 

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:56.010
 another thing is that there are people who can 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:57.889
 be attempting against colo colo are 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.689
 paddling against with achievement from within 

00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:02.430
 these suspicions are not new and arise 

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:04.680
 because of the friendship that the relationship 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:07.310
 business that links road leonidas 

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:10.379
 maximum shareholder albo ya josé yuraszeck 

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:12.659
 president of blue blue the certain thing is that 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:14.969
 money the power and the search for 

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:17.579
 influence have always been ingredients 

00:03:14.969 --> 00:03:20.000
 in colo coloration as reflected in 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:22.799
 documentary an object of desire ' 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.750
 premiered in 2004 by the journalist 

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:29.000
 Andrew Sanz but I would not have to 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:33.240
 colo is today and it was since he was born in 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:39.290
 1925 an object of desire 

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:41.880
 I wish you power of desire for figuration 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.190
 possibly from financial ambitions 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.610
 as well 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:49.070
 and we are missing those who look to the future 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:51.920
 fear that the future is being mortgaged 

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:52.250
 of the most important sports club in 

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:54.680
 Chile 

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:57.080
 I think that with the passing of time as 

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:58.340
 he's going to lose the privilege of being the 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.420
 most popular team of chile but 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:00.650
 mainly product of the 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.970
 decisions that are being taken in this 

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.710
 moment but that is not going to see 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:06.130
 immediately open thirty and fifty 

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:06.130
 More years 

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:18.760
 it's so acid you think this is a 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:21.459
 I think that this is the worst 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:23.020
 crisis of its history if we remember the 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:26.560
 moment of bankruptcy the bankruptcy becomes 

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:30.350
 for 40 60 million pesos that back and 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:32.360
 I have seen finished prisoner expressed 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:34.100
 for things much less serious than now 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:36.020
 the difference is that now there are two themes 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.610
 that they were like with the first the 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:39.710
 soccer channel delivers resources 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:42.590
 unlimited compared to what 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:45.500
 generates television in 2001 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:47.270
 2 - 2002 and second that within all 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.200
 is the silver of the shareholders that you 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:52.670
 they can hold a structure 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:55.790
 financially that that did not exist before but 

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:58.460
 that has been decreasing but good 

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:59.300
 now with which but as soon as 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.280
 organization 

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:03.230
 colo colo is worse than before because 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.840
 because it's not good decisions 

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:08.240
 inferiors and the team the first team 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:10.280
 it plays very badly but it is also 

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:13.010
 black and white administration does not have 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:14.930
 to carry all the branches 

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:17.330
 sports or all the social work that 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:19.760
 had with the pendants that is to say has 

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:21.410
 a simpler task no longer has its headquarters 

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:24.080
 the headquarters sold it they sold the 

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:25.580
 caupolicán and only he wants stadium and in 

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.470
 true colo colo now it's easier to 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:30.320
 administer why because it does not have no 

00:05:27.470 --> 00:05:33.650
 has subsidiaries you have paid subsidiaries 

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:36.290
 does not have sports branches had he reached 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:38.600
 37 branches negotiates in order has no labor 

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:40.490
 social is another thing like a company 

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:43.010
 in the concept of social club is 

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:44.780
 there would be exactly one table and still not 

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:47.180
 he manages not even to be a good team 

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:48.890
 it's more to graph the incidents of 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:51.110
 yesterday the monumental that outside were a 

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:53.720
 true protest with cars launches water 

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:55.190
 with tear gas finally we are going to 

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.990
 remember some instants of what 

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:58.070
 happened yesterday in the match with the union 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:05:59.630
 Spanish 

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:01.400
 look at this is not what it would be outside the 

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:03.620
 stadium for example serious incidents 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:06.530
 clearly serious because this is all 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:07.130
 there's Canton Canton a protest in 

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:08.720
 next one 

00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:10.760
 this was clear 

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:13.190
 then this is obviously going to undermine 

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:14.960
 the image of the club and there comes the 

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:17.230
 fundamental concern that the 

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:19.160
 patients during black and those who are 

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:20.810
 administering the sports social club 

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:23.600
 that is something else there is a fight and 

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:26.940
 pretty big if strong the subject of 

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:29.940
 what I believe and if it comes out 

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:31.710
 in lights or open the club to partners to 

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:35.370
 the participation of the fans falls 

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:38.169
 from meats responsibly 

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:40.629
 it seems to me that they are boats of the world 

00:06:38.169 --> 00:06:42.400
 good all this leads back xunta 

00:06:40.629 --> 00:06:44.050
 also someone sizing the 

00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:46.240
 past the note but we want to graph it 

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:49.779
 there was an internal altercation in it 

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:52.870
 team between toledo the argentinian and bull 

00:06:49.779 --> 00:06:54.460
 the holy defense and the reasons are good 

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:57.189
 fundamental have to do with the 

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:59.199
 fact that he was looking at the mood of the 

00:06:57.189 --> 00:07:02.229
 players threatened when to concentrate 

00:06:59.199 --> 00:07:04.419
 remember the long trip to Colombia and 

00:07:02.229 --> 00:07:06.849
 the bad results we can have here 

00:07:04.419 --> 00:07:09.580
 the underlying problem 

00:07:06.849 --> 00:07:11.979
 the trip was inevitable because it was the 

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:14.919
 programming the cost of playing a tournament 

00:07:11.979 --> 00:07:16.659
 international but the underlying theme is 

00:07:14.919 --> 00:07:18.550
 that the team plays badly and I think that 

00:07:16.659 --> 00:07:20.169
 it's a campus that does not have too much 

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:22.330
 hierarchy and it's the truth because I do not see 

00:07:20.169 --> 00:07:23.919
 answers now what is the difference 

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:26.020
 from other bad times the story 

00:07:23.919 --> 00:07:28.740
 soccer colo colo for example the one of 

00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:31.149
 bankruptcy than in the era of bankruptcy 

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:33.909
 I could get four or five good 

00:07:31.149 --> 00:07:35.469
 played but playing unbalanced 

00:07:33.909 --> 00:07:37.599
 the lower divisions times that 

00:07:35.469 --> 00:07:39.610
 They could give you a lot and right now 

00:07:37.599 --> 00:07:41.709
 at least at first sight there are not 

00:07:39.610 --> 00:07:43.569
 and there are those who potentially 

00:07:41.709 --> 00:07:46.319
 they can be contagious of the bad moment 

00:07:43.569 --> 00:07:46.319
 we 

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:49.480
 to
