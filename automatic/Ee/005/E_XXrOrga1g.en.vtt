00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:15.780
 under android galley welcome to our 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.029
 channel play andrade to stay personal today 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:20.580
 I will teach you how to calibrate 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:24.029
 battery of any android phone 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.070
 good what it is to calibrate the battery will tell 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.720
 here is the brief description for you 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.939
 the android operating system has a 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.830
 file called a backbone state that 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.290
 indicates the capacity of our 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.460
 when the battery is full or when 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.190
 was unloaded 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.680
 the problem is that this file sometimes 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.660
 is common and begins to show data that 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.460
 are not real what makes the 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.219
 cell phone to be erased even before 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.469
 complete 10 percent or once 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.230
 charged to 100 percent if you like 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.600
 quickly the quality process of the 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.510
 battery implies the correction of the 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.609
 referred to this file 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.250
 Good guys, let's go to the 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:05.010
 requirements of this tutorial of today we will 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.799
 need android 2.1 or higher 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:10.680
 the application is there on your device if 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.570
 call meter and calibration and let's go 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.270
 need that your device also has 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.100
 russians right 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.680
 so come on, I'll go in here in the pre 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:22.290
 story 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.909
 the application is this stark booklet 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.250
 let the link in the video description 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.799
 the app you'll lowering 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:33.270
 also leave a version to apply if 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:35.340
 need and let's go there before opening the 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.670
 personal application let's start the 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.049
 tutorial is always good to see doing 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.600
 a research that previously on the 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.530
 application will you be on your 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.180
 appliance 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.189
 I took a look here and saw that 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.110
 application and it has a very good 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:54.180
 right note 4.1 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:56.009
 notes there popular of 4.1 and the comments 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.799
 they are very good have a look here in 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:00.210
 comments saying that the application is 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.740
 good is useful 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.719
 look only explanatory choose your 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.990
 comment here the app I believe 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:09.330
 yielding 20% but was finally the 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.129
 comments are all cool it's hard 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.680
 you find a comment here that 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:16.439
 Disliked this app 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:20.430
 the tutorial in a good tone to the people 

00:02:16.439 --> 00:02:22.319
 will install the application is installed 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:26.700
 on your device the application you go 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:29.010
 connect is your cell phone your taxi in 

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:32.569
 right power outlet like I did here 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:37.530
 connected loads the unit up to 100% 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:39.840
 connected and will open the application is to have 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.750
 balance and open the beta application 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.540
 calibration you will come across this 

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:47.900
 wonderful screen and look how beautiful you are 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:50.760
 You will come across this screen there. 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:53.189
 You will see there a percentage is 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.099
 a current percentage of 

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:59.159
 and how you can observe the 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:01.620
 100% I 'm connected here in the 

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:05.430
 power outlet is 100% 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.269
 hence it has a life and is numbered 43 15 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.700
 mv 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:11.430
 that depends on the numbering that goes 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.909
 relying on mobile to mobile series 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:18.090
 brand to brand battery per battery 

00:03:13.909 --> 00:03:21.239
 beauty and numbering if you notice that 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:24.419
 that number and see me here 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:26.609
 my case that has been increasing 

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:29.280
 you expect to stabilize that numbering 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:32.310
 for you to continue the right tutorial 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.889
 wait a minute and you see it has increased 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:38.340
 you wait another minute to guarding 

00:03:34.889 --> 00:03:41.879
 stabilize with the number therein 4315 or 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:44.040
 can be 42 have depended each gear is 

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:46.470
 a maximum battery charge number 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:49.109
 certain and will depend on the battery brand 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:53.909
 the type of your device's battery 

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:56.430
 beauty is good to be 100% stabilize 

00:03:53.909 --> 00:03:59.819
 I'm going to take a hit and hit Caliberi. 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:01.670
 this button right here gives a pike there and 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:03.860
 it turned yellow 

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:06.680
 and the worst performance of 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:09.709
 successful calibration as you can 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:12.709
 watch callee break 17 very well you go 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:15.709
 give an ok now and you can leave now 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:18.950
 right application she passed the screen 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:21.139
 and will do what will restart 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:23.030
 your handset now beauty 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:28.700
 so I 'm going to restart the device here 

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:31.250
 now starting my cell phone ready 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:35.000
 just started here including taking 

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:38.320
 that the sp cable and the power outlet 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.460
 removing the beauty cable here 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.020
 Well, we did all that procedure. 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.840
 there ne 

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:47.690
 this way the device will 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:49.400
 to record the battery level that connects 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:51.800
 that number is the percentage that 

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:55.970
 was there in the app there in vectra 

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:56.990
 black 100% aquino bm see what 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:00.200
 happens 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:02.270
 the device will register that 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:04.760
 numbering as capacity point 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:07.640
 Battery maximum now erasing 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:10.039
 old file of beto state and generating 

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:11.660
 a new one with the data updated to 

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:13.370
 from now 

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:16.550
 good people then this was the procedure 

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:18.050
 battery calibration and your cell phone 

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:20.810
 your pictures 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:22.970
 I'm going to stay here I hope you 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:25.640
 I liked this video and I hope 

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:28.610
 helped if I helped if you liked 

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:31.400
 let your liquid video is share 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:34.460
 favorite is show for your friends anyway 

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:36.680
 and I count on you and on the next video there 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:37.220
 beauty then be in God and even 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:40.390
 next 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:40.390
 I was galley thank you 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.789
 the focus
