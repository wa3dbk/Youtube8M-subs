um probably about a foot you know it

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.300 
um probably about a foot you know it
grows<00:01:24.030> that<00:01:24.390> fast<00:01:24.420> that's<00:01:25.020> why<00:01:25.229> I<00:01:25.560> can<00:01:26.040> abuse

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
grows that fast that's why I can abuse

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.580 
grows that fast that's why I can abuse
it<00:01:26.490> as<00:01:26.610> much<00:01:26.790> as<00:01:26.909> I<00:01:27.030> do<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.689> it<00:01:28.259> still<00:01:28.560> looks

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
it as much as I do and it still looks

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.069 
it as much as I do and it still looks
halfway<00:01:29.100> decent<00:01:29.280> because<00:01:30.240> you<00:01:30.600> know<00:01:30.689> to<00:01:30.750> go<00:01:30.930> on

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
halfway decent because you know to go on

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.830 
halfway decent because you know to go on
stage<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.799> wind<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.130> rain<00:01:32.420> outside<00:01:33.420> show<00:01:33.630> is

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
stage the wind the rain outside show is

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:36.740 
stage the wind the rain outside show is
just<00:01:34.049> the<00:01:34.259> constant<00:01:34.740> washing<00:01:35.210> that<00:01:36.210> because

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
just the constant washing that because

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.080 
just the constant washing that because
of<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.890> way<00:01:37.920> it<00:01:38.130> grows<00:01:38.250> so<00:01:38.579> fast<00:01:38.610> it's

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
of the the way it grows so fast it's

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.359 
of the the way it grows so fast it's
it's<00:01:39.450> okay<00:01:39.780> but<00:01:40.530> what<00:01:40.710> if<00:01:40.829> it<00:01:40.979> were<00:01:41.100> really

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
it's okay but what if it were really

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.670 
it's okay but what if it were really
short<00:01:41.850> I<00:01:42.150> wouldn't<00:01:42.780> be<00:01:42.899> getting<00:01:43.049> it<00:01:43.320> caught<00:01:43.530> in

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
short I wouldn't be getting it caught in

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.420 
short I wouldn't be getting it caught in
all<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:43.950> doorways<00:01:44.600> you're<00:01:45.600> shorter<00:01:46.140> um<00:01:46.430> it

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
all the doorways you're shorter um it

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.639 
all the doorways you're shorter um it
definitely<00:01:47.790> wouldn't<00:01:47.939> be<00:01:48.090> as<00:01:48.180> heavy<00:01:48.649> there's

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
definitely wouldn't be as heavy there's

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.480 
definitely wouldn't be as heavy there's
a<00:01:49.770> lot<00:01:50.009> of<00:01:50.159> things<00:01:50.399> that<00:01:50.579> would<00:01:50.729> be<00:01:50.909> great<00:01:51.630> to

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
a lot of things that would be great to

00:01:52.490 --> 00:02:00.020 
a lot of things that would be great to
break<00:01:53.490> for<00:01:53.640> me<00:01:53.820> if<00:01:54.090> I<00:01:54.299> had<00:01:54.509> shorter<00:01:54.840> hair

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.319 

now

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:02.329 
now

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:04.950 
now
could<00:02:02.899> she<00:02:03.049> cut<00:02:03.259> it<00:02:03.409> all<00:02:03.590> at<00:02:03.859> once<00:02:04.070> I<00:02:04.369> know<00:02:04.609> that

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
could she cut it all at once I know that

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.480 
could she cut it all at once I know that
my<00:02:05.960> husband<00:02:06.350> wants<00:02:06.560> me<00:02:06.590> to<00:02:06.679> make<00:02:06.859> it<00:02:06.920> gradual

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
my husband wants me to make it gradual

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.029 
my husband wants me to make it gradual
because<00:02:07.759> he<00:02:07.909> has<00:02:08.060> to<00:02:08.209> live<00:02:08.360> with<00:02:08.599> me<00:02:08.899> so<00:02:09.110> I

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
because he has to live with me so I

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.520 
because he has to live with me so I
think<00:02:10.640> he<00:02:10.729> thinks<00:02:10.940> if<00:02:11.060> I<00:02:11.180> cut<00:02:11.510> it<00:02:11.660> all<00:02:12.140> the<00:02:12.200> way

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
think he thinks if I cut it all the way

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:14.800 
think he thinks if I cut it all the way
off<00:02:12.769> I<00:02:12.980> would<00:02:13.160> be<00:02:13.370> really<00:02:14.060> hard<00:02:14.300> to<00:02:14.360> live<00:02:14.599> with

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:14.810 
off I would be really hard to live with

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.680 
off I would be really hard to live with
he's<00:02:15.200> probably<00:02:15.410> right<00:02:15.950> so<00:02:16.280> I<00:02:16.310> it's<00:02:16.910> probably

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
he's probably right so I it's probably

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:19.390 
he's probably right so I it's probably
gonna<00:02:17.780> be<00:02:17.870> gradual<00:02:18.440> look<00:02:18.980> into<00:02:19.190> your<00:02:19.280> crystal

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:19.400 
gonna be gradual look into your crystal

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.960 
gonna be gradual look into your crystal
ball<00:02:19.819> and<00:02:20.120> no<00:02:20.480> pun<00:02:20.720> intended<00:02:21.340> and<00:02:22.340> tell<00:02:22.640> us<00:02:22.760> me

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
ball and no pun intended and tell us me

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:25.449 
ball and no pun intended and tell us me
do<00:02:23.690> you<00:02:23.780> think<00:02:23.959> it'll<00:02:24.080> be<00:02:24.260> this<00:02:24.860> year

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
do you think it'll be this year

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:31.360 
do you think it'll be this year
oh<00:02:26.470> no<00:02:27.470> that's<00:02:27.650> very<00:02:27.890> hard<00:02:28.099> because<00:02:30.370> I've

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
oh no that's very hard because I've

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.229 
oh no that's very hard because I've
always<00:02:31.640> been<00:02:31.970> hard<00:02:32.150> to<00:02:32.390> make<00:02:32.720> up<00:02:32.870> my<00:02:33.019> mind

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
always been hard to make up my mind

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:37.900 
always been hard to make up my mind
possibly<00:02:35.239> possibly<00:02:36.190> well<00:02:37.190> a<00:02:37.220> crystal<00:02:37.730> said

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
possibly possibly well a crystal said

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.190 
possibly possibly well a crystal said
the<00:02:38.030> reason<00:02:38.180> she<00:02:38.329> grew<00:02:38.569> hair<00:02:38.810> along<00:02:38.989> in<00:02:39.140> the

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
the reason she grew hair along in the

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.509 
the reason she grew hair along in the
first<00:02:39.380> place<00:02:39.590> is<00:02:39.769> because<00:02:40.040> she<00:02:40.190> never<00:02:40.340> knew

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:40.519 
first place is because she never knew

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:42.490 
first place is because she never knew
how<00:02:40.670> to<00:02:40.700> fix<00:02:41.000> it<00:02:41.209> so<00:02:41.480> just<00:02:41.599> let<00:02:41.810> it<00:02:41.930> grow<00:02:42.049> all

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
how to fix it so just let it grow all

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:43.750 
how to fix it so just let it grow all
she<00:02:42.739> has<00:02:42.829> to<00:02:42.860> do<00:02:43.040> now<00:02:43.190> is<00:02:43.310> pile<00:02:43.519> it<00:02:43.670> up

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
she has to do now is pile it up

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.370 
she has to do now is pile it up
somewhere<00:02:44.150> in<00:02:44.239> a<00:02:44.299> section<00:02:44.840> I<00:02:44.900> guess<00:02:45.110> you've

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:45.380 
somewhere in a section I guess you've

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:46.120 
somewhere in a section I guess you've
got<00:02:45.410> a<00:02:45.590> point<00:02:45.680> there

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
got a point there

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:47.410 
got a point there
never<00:02:46.700> they<00:02:46.819> ought<00:02:46.910> to<00:02:47.000> make<00:02:47.120> a<00:02:47.150> movie<00:02:47.390> about

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
never they ought to make a movie about

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.720 
never they ought to make a movie about
it
