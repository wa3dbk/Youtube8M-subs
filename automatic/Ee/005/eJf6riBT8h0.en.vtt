that I call the Johnny Chan play I
frankly<00:00:05.410> I<00:00:05.470> can't<00:00:05.770> think<00:00:05.980> of<00:00:06.040> a<00:00:06.130> better<00:00:06.220> name

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:06.490 
frankly I can't think of a better name

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:08.400 
frankly I can't think of a better name
to<00:00:06.670> call<00:00:06.880> it<00:00:07.060> so<00:00:07.390> since<00:00:07.600> Johnny<00:00:07.900> Chan<00:00:08.170> is<00:00:08.290> the

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:08.410 
to call it so since Johnny Chan is the

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:10.110 
to call it so since Johnny Chan is the
master<00:00:08.830> of<00:00:08.890> the<00:00:08.980> check<00:00:09.190> call<00:00:09.460> and<00:00:09.730> lead<00:00:10.000> the

master of the check call and lead the
turn<00:00:10.300> play<00:00:10.540> I<00:00:10.750> thought<00:00:11.110> it<00:00:11.200> would<00:00:11.290> only<00:00:11.380> be

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:11.590
