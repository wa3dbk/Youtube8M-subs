where<00:00:40.079> this<00:00:40.260> idea<00:00:40.440> came<00:00:40.770> from<00:00:41.030> well<00:00:42.030> a<00:00:42.059> couple

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
where this idea came from well a couple

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.569 
where this idea came from well a couple
of<00:00:42.450> years<00:00:42.660> ago<00:00:42.809> we<00:00:43.350> got<00:00:43.559> the<00:00:43.770> book<00:00:43.980> backyard

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
of years ago we got the book backyard

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.790 
of years ago we got the book backyard
ballistics<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.899> there's<00:00:46.079> a<00:00:46.140> potato<00:00:46.500> cannon

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
ballistics and there's a potato cannon

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.729 
ballistics and there's a potato cannon
design<00:00:47.280> in<00:00:47.489> there<00:00:47.640> that<00:00:47.850> we<00:00:47.969> built<00:00:48.440> we<00:00:49.440> had<00:00:49.559> so

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
design in there that we built we had so

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.229 
design in there that we built we had so
much<00:00:49.860> fun<00:00:49.920> with<00:00:50.280> that<00:00:50.520> we<00:00:50.760> were<00:00:50.879> sitting

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
much fun with that we were sitting

much fun with that we were sitting
around<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.719> dinner<00:00:51.840> table<00:00:52.110> around<00:00:52.800> Christmas

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
around the dinner table around Christmas

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.729 
around the dinner table around Christmas
and<00:00:53.520> thought<00:00:54.449> well<00:00:54.780> I<00:00:55.050> wonder<00:00:55.500> if<00:00:55.559> we<00:00:55.620> could

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
and thought well I wonder if we could

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.819 
and thought well I wonder if we could
build<00:00:55.890> a<00:00:56.010> Gatling<00:00:56.370> gun<00:00:56.399> version<00:00:56.910> and<00:00:57.559> we<00:00:58.559> have

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
build a Gatling gun version and we have

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.760 
build a Gatling gun version and we have
kind<00:00:59.219> of<00:00:59.280> a<00:00:59.370> tradition<00:00:59.850> in<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.030> family<00:01:00.059> to

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:00.770 
kind of a tradition in the family to

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.799 
kind of a tradition in the family to
create<00:01:01.770> a<00:01:01.800> design<00:01:02.129> challenge<00:01:02.399> each<00:01:02.879> holiday

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
create a design challenge each holiday

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.660 
create a design challenge each holiday
and<00:01:04.080> this<00:01:04.589> is<00:01:04.769> our<00:01:04.890> design<00:01:05.159> challenge<00:01:05.549> this

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
and this is our design challenge this

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:06.740 
and this is our design challenge this
year<00:01:05.729> we<00:01:05.909> had<00:01:06.030> no<00:01:06.150> idea<00:01:06.390> how<00:01:06.479> we're<00:01:06.600> going<00:01:06.689> to

at the Valentine you decide the basic
frame<00:01:43.530> on<00:01:43.920> your<00:01:44.159> own<00:01:44.280> and

00:01:45.349 --> 00:01:45.359 
frame on your own and

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:46.940 
frame on your own and
and<00:01:45.750> then<00:01:45.930> together<00:01:46.079> we<00:01:46.409> worked<00:01:46.649> out<00:01:46.799> the

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
and then together we worked out the

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.340 
and then together we worked out the
ignition<00:01:47.310> system<00:01:47.750> all<00:01:48.750> right<00:01:48.780> well<00:01:49.049> let's<00:01:49.259> uh

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
ignition system all right well let's uh

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.109 
ignition system all right well let's uh
let's<00:01:49.740> hear<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:50.009> little<00:01:50.189> bit<00:01:50.369> about<00:01:50.429> this<00:01:50.820> thing

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
let's hear a little bit about this thing

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.060 
let's hear a little bit about this thing
so<00:01:51.960> we've<00:01:52.079> got<00:01:52.259> right<00:01:52.409> here<00:01:52.439> is<00:01:52.649> we've<00:01:52.950> got

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
so we've got right here is we've got

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.340 
so we've got right here is we've got
spark<00:01:53.520> plugs<00:01:53.759> in<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.090> back<00:01:54.240> of<00:01:54.479> each<00:01:54.750> end<00:01:55.140> cap

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
spark plugs in the back of each end cap

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.789 
spark plugs in the back of each end cap
each<00:01:55.829> barrel<00:01:56.509> and<00:01:57.509> we've<00:01:57.659> got<00:01:57.810> this<00:01:57.990> step-up

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
each barrel and we've got this step-up

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.059 
each barrel and we've got this step-up
transformer<00:01:59.549> to<00:02:00.140> 7,500<00:02:01.140> volts<00:02:01.560> right<00:02:01.770> and

00:02:02.059 --> 00:02:02.069 
transformer to 7,500 volts right and

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:04.160 
transformer to 7,500 volts right and
it's<00:02:02.759> just<00:02:03.119> converting<00:02:03.539> regular<00:02:03.840> you<00:02:04.140> know

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
it's just converting regular you know

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.440 
it's just converting regular you know
120<00:02:04.829> volt<00:02:05.159> house<00:02:05.340> power<00:02:05.869> to<00:02:06.950> 7500<00:02:07.950> volts

120 volt house power to 7500 volts

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.580 
120 volt house power to 7500 volts
underneath<00:02:09.450> here<00:02:09.720> you<00:02:09.750> can<00:02:09.959> kind<00:02:10.140> of<00:02:10.200> see<00:02:10.379> on

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
underneath here you can kind of see on

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.660 
underneath here you can kind of see on
each<00:02:11.489> barrel<00:02:11.879> there<00:02:12.090> are<00:02:12.299> a<00:02:12.330> couple<00:02:12.480> contacts

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
each barrel there are a couple contacts

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.119 
each barrel there are a couple contacts
and<00:02:14.959> these<00:02:15.959> two<00:02:16.200> long<00:02:16.410> contacts<00:02:16.920> are

00:02:17.119 --> 00:02:17.129 
and these two long contacts are

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:18.830 
and these two long contacts are
connected<00:02:17.519> to<00:02:17.670> the<00:02:18.090> positive<00:02:18.480> and<00:02:18.569> negative

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
connected to the positive and negative

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:19.819 
connected to the positive and negative
ends<00:02:19.019> of<00:02:19.079> the<00:02:19.170> spark<00:02:19.440> plug

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:19.829 
ends of the spark plug

00:02:19.829 --> 00:02:23.650 
ends of the spark plug
and<00:02:19.920> the<00:02:20.700> middle<00:02:20.880> contact<00:02:21.630> is<00:02:22.230> um<00:02:22.680> no<00:02:23.610> a

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
and the middle contact is um no a

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.240 
and the middle contact is um no a
momentary<00:02:24.660> switch<00:02:24.959> pretty<00:02:25.440> much<00:02:25.650> for<00:02:26.010> the

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:26.250 
momentary switch pretty much for the

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.520 
momentary switch pretty much for the
house<00:02:26.430> power<00:02:26.760> so<00:02:27.510> as<00:02:27.660> the<00:02:28.250> barrels<00:02:29.250> spin<00:02:29.610> by

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
house power so as the barrels spin by

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:35.390 
house power so as the barrels spin by
these<00:02:31.530> contacts<00:02:32.040> hanging<00:02:32.400> down<00:02:33.470> the<00:02:34.470> long

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
these contacts hanging down the long

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.210 
these contacts hanging down the long
contacts<00:02:36.030> engage<00:02:36.630> and<00:02:37.019> it<00:02:37.680> connects<00:02:38.069> the

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
contacts engage and it connects the

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.100 
contacts engage and it connects the
circuit<00:02:38.430> from<00:02:39.120> the<00:02:39.269> high<00:02:39.480> end<00:02:39.690> of<00:02:39.959> the

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
circuit from the high end of the

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.920 
circuit from the high end of the
transformer<00:02:40.680> to<00:02:41.430> the<00:02:41.459> spark<00:02:41.790> plugs<00:02:42.030> and<00:02:42.269> then

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
transformer to the spark plugs and then

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.619 
transformer to the spark plugs and then
once<00:02:43.620> it<00:02:43.769> spins<00:02:43.950> a<00:02:44.040> little<00:02:44.129> bit<00:02:44.370> farther<00:02:44.640> the<00:02:45.599> a

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:45.629 
once it spins a little bit farther the a

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:48.259 
once it spins a little bit farther the a
shorter<00:02:46.079> contact<00:02:46.470> you<00:02:47.190> know<00:02:47.310> connects<00:02:48.030> and

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
shorter contact you know connects and

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:49.970 
shorter contact you know connects and
then<00:02:48.540> that<00:02:48.690> actually<00:02:48.900> energizes<00:02:49.889> the

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
then that actually energizes the

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.340 
then that actually energizes the
transformer<00:02:50.579> so<00:02:50.700> the<00:02:50.790> transformer<00:02:51.420> is<00:02:51.600> only

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
transformer so the transformer is only

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.640 
transformer so the transformer is only
on<00:02:52.769> for<00:02:53.519> a<00:02:53.549> fraction<00:02:54.120> of<00:02:54.209> a<00:02:54.299> second<00:02:54.660> as<00:02:54.780> the

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
on for a fraction of a second as the

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.770 
on for a fraction of a second as the
barrels<00:02:55.950> spin<00:02:56.250> by<00:02:56.400> the<00:02:56.819> very<00:02:57.030> top<00:02:57.329> position

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
barrels spin by the very top position

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.590 
barrels spin by the very top position
and<00:02:57.959> that<00:02:58.680> creates<00:02:59.370> a<00:02:59.430> spark<00:02:59.760> inside<00:02:59.970> the<00:03:00.450> end

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600 
and that creates a spark inside the end

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:03.289 
and that creates a spark inside the end
cap<00:03:00.750> and<00:03:00.780> that<00:03:01.109> fires<00:03:01.620> the<00:03:01.709> hairspray<00:03:02.100> on<00:03:02.579> the

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299 
cap and that fires the hairspray on the

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:05.300 
cap and that fires the hairspray on the
single<00:03:03.600> barrel<00:03:03.840> version<00:03:04.019> we<00:03:04.530> just<00:03:04.769> spray<00:03:05.160> the

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
single barrel version we just spray the

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.599 
single barrel version we just spray the
hairspray<00:03:05.489> in<00:03:06.030> the<00:03:06.510> back<00:03:06.690> here<00:03:06.959> but<00:03:07.829> we<00:03:08.280> can't

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:08.609 
hairspray in the back here but we can't

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:11.479 
hairspray in the back here but we can't
do<00:03:08.880> that<00:03:09.060> on<00:03:09.269> this<00:03:09.510> version<00:03:09.739> because<00:03:10.739> if<00:03:11.130> we

00:03:11.479 --> 00:03:11.489 
do that on this version because if we

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:12.949 
do that on this version because if we
were<00:03:11.639> unscrewing<00:03:12.150> that<00:03:12.389> end<00:03:12.630> cap<00:03:12.930> and

00:03:12.949 --> 00:03:12.959 
were unscrewing that end cap and

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:14.509 
were unscrewing that end cap and
screwing<00:03:13.500> it<00:03:13.590> back<00:03:13.620> on<00:03:13.889> it<00:03:14.160> would<00:03:14.280> be<00:03:14.370> very

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
screwing it back on it would be very

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:17.180 
screwing it back on it would be very
hectic<00:03:14.819> with<00:03:15.150> all<00:03:15.299> the<00:03:15.389> wires<00:03:15.569> so<00:03:16.560> what<00:03:17.069> we've

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
hectic with all the wires so what we've

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.819 
hectic with all the wires so what we've
done<00:03:17.370> here<00:03:17.430> is<00:03:17.670> um<00:03:18.590> we<00:03:19.590> just<00:03:19.799> put<00:03:20.639> holes

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:21.829 
done here is um we just put holes

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:24.710 
done here is um we just put holes
drilled<00:03:22.829> holes<00:03:23.069> in<00:03:23.400> there<00:03:23.579> and<00:03:23.849> put<00:03:24.329> sliding

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
drilled holes in there and put sliding

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.789 
drilled holes in there and put sliding
doors<00:03:24.930> so<00:03:25.709> we<00:03:25.739> unlight<00:03:26.340> it

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:29.799 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:37.899 

Spray<00:03:30.799> it<00:03:30.860> in<00:03:32.980> and<00:03:33.980> then<00:03:34.340> slide<00:03:34.640> it<00:03:34.760> back<00:03:34.909> up<00:03:36.909> so

00:03:37.899 --> 00:03:37.909 
Spray it in and then slide it back up so

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:39.729 
Spray it in and then slide it back up so
we<00:03:37.939> started<00:03:38.450> the<00:03:38.540> project<00:03:38.750> over<00:03:39.349> Christmas

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:39.739 
we started the project over Christmas

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:42.520 
we started the project over Christmas
break<00:03:39.769> this<00:03:40.250> past<00:03:40.549> year<00:03:40.939> the<00:03:41.900> basic<00:03:42.290> frame

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
break this past year the basic frame

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.490 
break this past year the basic frame
came<00:03:42.829> together<00:03:43.010> in<00:03:43.370> just<00:03:43.489> a<00:03:43.670> couple<00:03:43.819> of<00:03:44.090> days

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
came together in just a couple of days

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.130 
came together in just a couple of days
during<00:03:45.500> Christmas<00:03:45.920> break<00:03:46.329> the<00:03:47.329> rest<00:03:47.540> of<00:03:47.780> the

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:48.140 
during Christmas break the rest of the

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:53.080 
during Christmas break the rest of the
the<00:03:49.129> design<00:03:49.489> has<00:03:49.849> taken<00:03:50.299> most<00:03:51.170> weekends<00:03:52.090> since

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
the design has taken most weekends since

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:56.110 
the design has taken most weekends since
March<00:03:54.069> most<00:03:55.069> of<00:03:55.159> the<00:03:55.220> time<00:03:55.430> we<00:03:55.609> spent<00:03:55.939> working

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
March most of the time we spent working

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.289 
March most of the time we spent working
out<00:03:56.450> the<00:03:56.629> ignition<00:03:57.290> system<00:03:57.730> the<00:03:58.730> fuel<00:03:58.939> loading

00:03:59.289 --> 00:03:59.299 
out the ignition system the fuel loading

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:02.259 
out the ignition system the fuel loading
and<00:03:59.750> the<00:04:00.230> barrel<00:04:00.560> spinning<00:04:01.040> but<00:04:01.940> it's<00:04:02.090> been<00:04:02.239> a

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:02.269 
and the barrel spinning but it's been a

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:04.240 
and the barrel spinning but it's been a
great<00:04:02.450> project<00:04:02.870> we've<00:04:03.560> learned<00:04:03.769> a<00:04:03.889> lot<00:04:03.920> we've

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
great project we've learned a lot we've

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:05.379 
great project we've learned a lot we've
had<00:04:04.400> to<00:04:04.489> solve<00:04:04.700> a<00:04:04.790> lot<00:04:04.909> of<00:04:05.030> engineering

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:05.389 
had to solve a lot of engineering

00:04:05.389 --> 00:04:07.720 
had to solve a lot of engineering
problems<00:04:05.930> there<00:04:06.920> was<00:04:07.040> also<00:04:07.280> even<00:04:07.519> a<00:04:07.579> little

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730 
problems there was also even a little

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:09.250 
problems there was also even a little
bit<00:04:07.909> of<00:04:08.000> math<00:04:08.239> and<00:04:08.569> how<00:04:08.659> to<00:04:08.720> layout<00:04:08.959> the

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
bit of math and how to layout the

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:10.509 
bit of math and how to layout the
barrels

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:10.519 
barrels

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:12.520 
barrels
so<00:04:10.940> that's<00:04:11.269> how<00:04:11.389> we<00:04:11.450> built<00:04:11.750> the<00:04:11.930> potato

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.530 
so that's how we built the potato

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:24.640 
so that's how we built the potato
Gatling<00:04:12.920> gun

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.710
