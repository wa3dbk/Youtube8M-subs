these came out and i believe 2010 i'm
not<00:03:54.400> really<00:03:54.549> sure<00:03:54.670> if<00:03:54.880> that<00:03:55.120> date<00:03:55.359> is<00:03:55.600> the

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
not really sure if that date is the

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.400 
not really sure if that date is the
right<00:03:57.010> date<00:03:57.310> but<00:03:57.730> so<00:03:58.420> far<00:03:58.660> the<00:03:58.810> condition<00:03:59.290> of

00:03:59.400 --> 00:03:59.410 
right date but so far the condition of

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.069 
right date but so far the condition of
these<00:03:59.590> are<00:04:00.070> pretty<00:04:00.400> nice<00:04:00.700> the<00:04:01.180> shoe<00:04:01.450> the

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:02.079 
these are pretty nice the shoe the

00:04:02.079 --> 00:04:04.110 
these are pretty nice the shoe the
detail<00:04:02.500> of<00:04:02.530> it<00:04:02.739> is<00:04:02.980> pretty<00:04:03.280> nice<00:04:03.579> there<00:04:03.940> was

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
detail of it is pretty nice there was

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.360 
detail of it is pretty nice there was
the<00:04:04.810> only<00:04:04.930> problem<00:04:05.410> that<00:04:05.440> I<00:04:05.620> can<00:04:05.799> see<00:04:06.010> is<00:04:06.160> that

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370 
the only problem that I can see is that

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.310 
the only problem that I can see is that
the<00:04:06.579> bottom<00:04:06.970> has<00:04:07.120> minor<00:04:07.510> yellow<00:04:07.810> in<00:04:08.049> but

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:08.320 
the bottom has minor yellow in but

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.740 
the bottom has minor yellow in but
that's<00:04:08.890> okay<00:04:09.310> because<00:04:09.420> that's<00:04:10.420> eventually

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
that's okay because that's eventually

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.900 
that's okay because that's eventually
going<00:04:11.049> to<00:04:11.230> happen<00:04:11.650> so<00:04:12.040> as<00:04:12.310> long<00:04:12.489> as<00:04:12.549> it<00:04:12.760> wasn't

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:12.910 
going to happen so as long as it wasn't

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.020 
going to happen so as long as it wasn't

shoes<00:04:27.139> pretty<00:04:27.470> nice<00:04:28.180> so<00:04:29.180> I'm<00:04:29.330> going<00:04:29.510> to<00:04:29.540> do<00:04:29.630> the

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:29.750 
shoes pretty nice so I'm going to do the

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.490 
shoes pretty nice so I'm going to do the
comparison<00:04:30.139> with<00:04:30.650> this<00:04:31.160> six<00:04:31.550> and<00:04:32.080> the<00:04:33.080> Olympic

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:33.500 
comparison with this six and the Olympic

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.480 
comparison with this six and the Olympic
success<00:04:33.770> from<00:04:34.460> the<00:04:34.610> 2012<00:04:35.210> release<00:04:35.770> so<00:04:36.770> these

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:37.490 
success from the 2012 release so these

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:39.070 
success from the 2012 release so these
are<00:04:37.550> only<00:04:37.850> so<00:04:38.270> let's<00:04:38.540> do<00:04:38.690> a<00:04:38.720> little<00:04:38.930> comparison

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
are only so let's do a little comparison

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.189 
are only so let's do a little comparison
with<00:04:39.560> the<00:04:39.650> toe<00:04:39.889> on<00:04:40.400> the<00:04:40.460> olympic<00:04:41.270> 6s<00:04:41.510> the<00:04:41.900> toes

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:42.199 
with the toe on the olympic 6s the toes

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:44.320 
with the toe on the olympic 6s the toes
are<00:04:42.530> much<00:04:42.740> the<00:04:42.770> toe<00:04:43.160> is<00:04:43.340> much<00:04:43.610> harder<00:04:43.940> than

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:44.330 
are much the toe is much harder than

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.560 
are much the toe is much harder than
what<00:04:45.110> it<00:04:45.260> was<00:04:45.290> back<00:04:45.830> then<00:04:45.889> in<00:04:46.220> 2010<00:04:46.970> these<00:04:47.240> toes

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:47.570 
what it was back then in 2010 these toes

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:50.469 
what it was back then in 2010 these toes
are<00:04:48.169> little<00:04:48.500> bit<00:04:48.699> softer<00:04:49.699> as<00:04:50.060> you<00:04:50.180> can<00:04:50.330> see

00:04:50.469 --> 00:04:50.479 
are little bit softer as you can see

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:52.689 
are little bit softer as you can see
that<00:04:50.510> I'm<00:04:50.690> pushing<00:04:50.900> it<00:04:51.139> you<00:04:51.169> can<00:04:51.410> see<00:04:51.680> it<00:04:51.710> going

00:04:52.689 --> 00:04:52.699 
that I'm pushing it you can see it going

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:55.120 
that I'm pushing it you can see it going
in<00:04:52.850> on<00:04:53.090> the<00:04:53.210> sixes<00:04:53.750> the<00:04:54.260> Olympic<00:04:54.620> six<00:04:54.860> is<00:04:55.010> not

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.130 
in on the sixes the Olympic six is not

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:57.400 
in on the sixes the Olympic six is not
pushing<00:04:55.430> it's<00:04:55.760> pretty<00:04:55.970> hard<00:04:56.180> to<00:04:56.300> go<00:04:56.510> in<00:04:56.720> so<00:04:57.320> you

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:57.410 
pushing it's pretty hard to go in so you

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:59.140 
pushing it's pretty hard to go in so you
guys<00:04:57.530> didn't<00:04:58.100> see<00:04:58.220> that<00:04:58.250> they<00:04:58.490> did<00:04:58.729> change<00:04:59.000> the

00:04:59.140 --> 00:04:59.150 
guys didn't see that they did change the

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:01.150 
guys didn't see that they did change the
material<00:04:59.360> of<00:04:59.930> it<00:05:00.110> and<00:05:00.710> then<00:05:00.800> when<00:05:00.919> you<00:05:00.979> go<00:05:01.100> to

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:01.160 
material of it and then when you go to

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.540 
material of it and then when you go to
the<00:05:01.400> side<00:05:01.700> there's<00:05:02.479> not<00:05:02.750> much<00:05:03.050> difference

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:03.550 
the side there's not much difference

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.070

the right of lace locks on the bull six
is<00:05:50.270> so<00:05:50.479> that<00:05:50.660> you<00:05:51.229> know<00:05:51.380> it<00:05:51.620> shows<00:05:52.130> a<00:05:52.160> lot<00:05:52.220> more

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:52.490 
is so that you know it shows a lot more

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:54.460 
is so that you know it shows a lot more
because<00:05:52.639> you<00:05:53.450> know<00:05:53.539> the<00:05:53.750> black<00:05:53.960> lace<00:05:54.200> is<00:05:54.380> I

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:15.220 
point of view that's how it looks um

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:18.130

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:18.140 
basically everything looks on the same

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:22.030 
basically everything looks on the same
except<00:07:18.890> the<00:07:19.010> jumpman<00:07:19.490> and<00:07:20.380> you<00:07:21.380> know<00:07:21.530> the<00:07:21.710> toe
