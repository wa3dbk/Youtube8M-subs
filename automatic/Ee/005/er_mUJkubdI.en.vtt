twenty dollars or 20 euro in Europe not

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.889 
twenty dollars or 20 euro in Europe not
sure<00:01:09.899> what<00:01:10.049> that's<00:01:10.200> for<00:01:11.299> some<00:01:12.299> sort<00:01:12.539> of<00:01:12.600> shield

00:01:12.889 --> 00:01:12.899 
sure what that's for some sort of shield

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:16.010 
sure what that's for some sort of shield
maybe<00:01:13.140> and<00:01:13.640> the<00:01:14.640> back<00:01:14.820> is<00:01:15.119> just<00:01:15.390> like<00:01:15.539> that<00:01:15.869> as

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
maybe and the back is just like that as

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.620 
maybe and the back is just like that as
well<00:01:16.049> so<00:01:16.499> pretty<00:01:17.399> much<00:01:17.520> identical<00:01:17.729> texture<00:01:18.539> on

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
well so pretty much identical texture on

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.300 
well so pretty much identical texture on
the<00:01:18.719> front<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.200> back<00:01:19.350> whoever<00:01:19.590> front<00:01:20.039> has

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
the front and back whoever front has

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.200 
the front and back whoever front has
somewhat<00:01:21.289> maybe<00:01:22.289> more<00:01:22.740> rubbery<00:01:23.700> feel<00:01:23.729> to<00:01:24.179> it

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
somewhat maybe more rubbery feel to it

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.959 
somewhat maybe more rubbery feel to it
in<00:01:24.600> the<00:01:24.749> back<00:01:24.960> not<00:01:25.950> sure<00:01:26.009> exactly<00:01:26.640> what<00:01:26.850> is

00:01:26.959 --> 00:01:26.969 
in the back not sure exactly what is

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:29.300 
in the back not sure exactly what is
made<00:01:27.149> for<00:01:27.390> but<00:01:27.539> it<00:01:27.630> seems<00:01:27.810> like<00:01:28.049> a<00:01:28.079> some<00:01:29.069> sort

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
made for but it seems like a some sort

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.090 
made for but it seems like a some sort
of<00:01:29.369> rubberized<00:01:29.729> plastic<00:01:30.319> so<00:01:31.319> to<00:01:31.380> put<00:01:31.770> the<00:01:31.920> case

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100

guys<00:01:59.999> for<00:02:00.209> the<00:02:00.270> color<00:02:00.539> by<00:02:00.779> the<00:02:00.810> way<00:02:00.959> this<00:02:01.259> case

00:02:01.699 --> 00:02:01.709 
guys for the color by the way this case

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:05.029 
guys for the color by the way this case
is<00:02:01.740> not<00:02:02.009> for<00:02:02.279> me<00:02:02.310> it's<00:02:02.520> for<00:02:02.549> my<00:02:02.729> wife<00:02:02.909> so<00:02:04.039> hence

00:02:05.029 --> 00:02:05.039 
is not for me it's for my wife so hence

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:08.539 
is not for me it's for my wife so hence
the<00:02:05.279> collar<00:02:05.520> but<00:02:06.509> I<00:02:06.799> suppose<00:02:07.799> it's<00:02:08.009> easier<00:02:08.310> to

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:08.549 
the collar but I suppose it's easier to

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:12.500 
the collar but I suppose it's easier to
see<00:02:08.819> on<00:02:09.379> the<00:02:10.379> phone<00:02:10.590> then<00:02:11.489> if<00:02:11.760> it<00:02:11.939> was<00:02:12.180> black

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
see on the phone then if it was black

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:13.020 
see on the phone then if it was black
which<00:02:12.750> I

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
which I

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.720 
which I
probably<00:02:13.540> get<00:02:13.720> fits<00:02:14.650> very<00:02:15.010> nicely<00:02:15.250> on<00:02:15.610> the

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
probably get fits very nicely on the

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.990 
probably get fits very nicely on the
phone<00:02:15.940> and<00:02:16.150> looks<00:02:16.420> very<00:02:16.870> nice<00:02:17.640> wish<00:02:18.640> there<00:02:18.880> was

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
phone and looks very nice wish there was

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.790 
phone and looks very nice wish there was
a<00:02:19.030> different<00:02:19.540> color<00:02:19.750> so<00:02:19.990> I<00:02:20.020> could<00:02:20.290> use<00:02:20.319> it<00:02:20.500> but

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:20.800 
a different color so I could use it but

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.760 
a different color so I could use it but
either<00:02:20.950> way<00:02:21.220> and<00:02:21.459> it's<00:02:22.180> so<00:02:22.480> much<00:02:22.720> yeah<00:02:23.650> it

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:23.770 
either way and it's so much yeah it

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.400 
either way and it's so much yeah it
seems<00:02:23.980> like<00:02:24.130> it's<00:02:24.310> a<00:02:24.400> magnetic<00:02:24.880> cover<00:02:25.120> as<00:02:25.410> you

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:26.410 
seems like it's a magnetic cover as you

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
seems like it's a magnetic cover as you
see<00:02:26.650> it<00:02:26.890> holds<00:02:27.990> you<00:02:28.990> have<00:02:29.140> to<00:02:29.319> really<00:02:29.440> open<00:02:30.100> it

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
see it holds you have to really open it

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.940 
see it holds you have to really open it
up<00:02:30.520> yeah<00:02:30.970> so<00:02:31.600> it's<00:02:31.720> a<00:02:31.780> magnetic<00:02:32.200> cover<00:02:32.410> holds

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950
