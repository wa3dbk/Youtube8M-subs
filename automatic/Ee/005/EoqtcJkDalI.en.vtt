00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:08.550
 are the primary screens to navigate 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.860
 this tells you this horizon and your 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.200
 speed your height 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.290
 this is a rose that you can change that 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.750
 It has different formats 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:20.600
 [Applause] 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.160
 this screen here we can put letters 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.510
 of 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.820
 [Applause] 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:26.410
 for example from the airport or we can 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.850
 change with a letter from a 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.850
 approximation for example 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:36.640
 then when you go flying you appear 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.640
 the plane where you are all 

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:43.110
 and we have the machines 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.110
 we can see a 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.970
 representation of the whole country where 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.380
 you are on the plane gives you weather you get 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:56.000
 all 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:01:00.980
 these here are our systems of 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.930
 secondary navigation we have 3 gps and 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.200
 this is the main one this is the 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:05.200
 principal 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:11.380
 that is the main one they call it fm is the 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.630
 emanation system we have its 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.870
 own gps but also this has its 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:19.540
 own gps and this one too 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:21.310
 this because it's like older is not 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.620
 older what happens is that it 's another 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.390
 type of format 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.610
 this is the format that has the most 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.260
 of airplanes this is one more system 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:33.410
 new but it's more simply 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:37.890
 less complex and less complex this 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:40.040
 brings infinity of information all 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:44.140
 with this 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:46.440
 you put your initial provision not 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.740
 true that the oil 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:52.170
 and then you go to flight plan and mind 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.630
 is your flight plan where do you want to go and 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:58.680
 in these king kong screens in this 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:00.450
 age the children that you say let's say 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:06.219
 leave here from sector 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:06.219
