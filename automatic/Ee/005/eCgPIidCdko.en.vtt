just<00:01:50.740> simple<00:01:51.190> tap<00:01:51.460> water<00:01:51.510> coming<00:01:52.510> from<00:01:52.780> my

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:53.020 
just simple tap water coming from my

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.220 
just simple tap water coming from my
faucet<00:01:53.320> and<00:01:53.890> then<00:01:54.220> I<00:01:54.250> add<00:01:54.550> a<00:01:54.580> capful<00:01:55.060> of<00:01:55.510> the

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:56.230 
faucet and then I add a capful of the

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:58.470 
faucet and then I add a capful of the
the<00:01:56.890> flavor<00:01:57.100> in<00:01:57.280> this<00:01:57.400> case<00:01:57.610> this<00:01:57.850> is<00:01:57.910> root

00:01:58.470 --> 00:01:58.480 
the flavor in this case this is root

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.830 
the flavor in this case this is root
beer<00:01:58.690> which<00:01:59.440> I<00:01:59.860> enjoy<00:02:00.400> a<00:02:00.430> lot<00:02:00.580> now<00:02:01.150> if<00:02:01.390> you<00:02:01.540> need

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
beer which I enjoy a lot now if you need

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.170 
beer which I enjoy a lot now if you need
a<00:02:01.870> little<00:02:02.200> bit<00:02:02.350> more<00:02:02.590> sugar<00:02:02.909> here's<00:02:03.909> a<00:02:04.000> good

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
a little bit more sugar here's a good

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.070 
a little bit more sugar here's a good
tip<00:02:04.650> add<00:02:05.650> just<00:02:06.490> one<00:02:07.019> packet

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
tip add just one packet

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.300 
tip add just one packet
of<00:02:08.170> sugar<00:02:08.560> to<00:02:09.550> yield<00:02:10.150> to<00:02:10.630> the<00:02:10.660> mix<00:02:11.020> and<00:02:11.320> it

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
of sugar to yield to the mix and it

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.010 
of sugar to yield to the mix and it
helps<00:02:12.610> a<00:02:12.760> little<00:02:12.910> bit<00:02:13.060> with<00:02:13.120> the<00:02:13.450> carbonation

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
helps a little bit with the carbonation

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.740 
helps a little bit with the carbonation
it<00:02:14.170> also<00:02:14.320> helps<00:02:14.800> with<00:02:15.490> with<00:02:16.120> the<00:02:16.270> flavor<00:02:16.510> the

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
it also helps with with the flavor the

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.420 
it also helps with with the flavor the
taste<00:02:16.960> especially<00:02:17.560> if<00:02:17.950> you<00:02:18.040> get<00:02:18.160> I<00:02:18.220> want<00:02:18.370> to

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
taste especially if you get I want to

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:19.590 
taste especially if you get I want to
get<00:02:18.520> used<00:02:18.700> to<00:02:18.850> these<00:02:19.030> taste<00:02:19.300> because<00:02:19.480> you're

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
get used to these taste because you're

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.240 
get used to these taste because you're
going<00:02:19.720> to<00:02:19.810> taste<00:02:20.020> different<00:02:20.500> because<00:02:20.950> they

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
going to taste different because they

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.130 
going to taste different because they
don't<00:02:21.490> have<00:02:21.760> the<00:02:21.940> high<00:02:22.120> fructose<00:02:22.480> corn<00:02:22.750> syrup

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
don't have the high fructose corn syrup

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.670 
don't have the high fructose corn syrup
that<00:02:23.980> you're<00:02:24.130> so<00:02:24.400> used<00:02:24.430> to<00:02:25.030> so<00:02:25.870> I<00:02:26.290> don't<00:02:26.500> think

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
that you're so used to so I don't think

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:27.990 
that you're so used to so I don't think
I<00:02:26.740> got<00:02:26.890> nothing<00:02:27.070> and<00:02:27.340> getting<00:02:27.460> out<00:02:27.670> the<00:02:27.820> side

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
I got nothing and getting out the side

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.940 
I got nothing and getting out the side
here<00:02:28.180> so<00:02:28.330> basically<00:02:29.020> I<00:02:29.140> just<00:02:29.410> poured<00:02:29.650> a<00:02:29.710> capful

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
here so basically I just poured a capful

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.730 
here so basically I just poured a capful
in<00:02:30.310> here<00:02:30.550> and<00:02:30.870> sometimes<00:02:31.870> they<00:02:32.050> say<00:02:32.230> well<00:02:32.500> put

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:32.740 
in here and sometimes they say well put

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.350 
in here and sometimes they say well put
the<00:02:32.830> capital<00:02:33.220> after<00:02:33.700> you<00:02:33.790> carbonate<00:02:34.240> the

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
the capital after you carbonate the

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.090 
the capital after you carbonate the
water<00:02:34.510> I<00:02:34.600> like<00:02:34.810> to<00:02:34.960> do<00:02:35.050> it<00:02:35.170> before<00:02:35.260> because

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
water I like to do it before because

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.100 
water I like to do it before because
then<00:02:36.280> it<00:02:36.370> kind<00:02:36.610> of<00:02:36.670> shakes<00:02:36.910> up<00:02:37.180> the<00:02:37.210> the<00:02:37.900> rub

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.110 
then it kind of shakes up the the rub

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.010 
then it kind of shakes up the the rub
your<00:02:38.230> flavor<00:02:38.500> so<00:02:39.190> here<00:02:39.460> I<00:02:39.700> have<00:02:39.790> the<00:02:40.630> root<00:02:40.840> beer

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:41.020 
your flavor so here I have the root beer

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.990 
your flavor so here I have the root beer
it's<00:02:41.140> kind<00:02:41.500> of<00:02:41.590> flat<00:02:41.920> so<00:02:42.280> I'm<00:02:42.640> going<00:02:42.820> to<00:02:42.850> need

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
it's kind of flat so I'm going to need

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.760 
it's kind of flat so I'm going to need
to<00:02:43.090> carbon<00:02:43.420> in<00:02:43.540> it<00:02:43.630> so<00:02:43.720> I<00:02:43.780> can<00:02:43.930> put<00:02:44.200> it<00:02:44.290> into<00:02:44.650> the

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
to carbon in it so I can put it into the

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:48.660 
to carbon in it so I can put it into the
carbonation<00:02:45.400> device<00:02:45.700> here<00:02:46.030> the<00:02:46.150> Primo<00:02:47.670> just

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
carbonation device here the Primo just

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.670 
carbonation device here the Primo just
like<00:02:48.820> that<00:02:49.090> and<00:02:49.330> what<00:02:50.170> I'm<00:02:50.260> going<00:02:50.350> to<00:02:50.410> do<00:02:50.530> is

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
like that and what I'm going to do is

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.350 
like that and what I'm going to do is
I'm<00:02:50.830> gonna<00:02:50.890> press<00:02:51.280> the<00:02:51.430> button<00:02:51.700> I'm<00:02:52.180> going<00:02:52.270> to

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:52.360 
I'm gonna press the button I'm going to

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.780 
I'm gonna press the button I'm going to
count<00:02:52.600> one<00:02:52.840> Mississippi<00:02:52.990> and<00:02:53.650> then<00:02:54.130> three

is<00:03:17.470> completely<00:03:18.340> carbonated<00:03:18.880> now<00:03:19.030> there's<00:03:19.209> a

00:03:19.259 --> 00:03:19.269 
is completely carbonated now there's a

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:21.210 
is completely carbonated now there's a
button<00:03:19.570> in<00:03:19.690> back<00:03:19.900> here<00:03:20.170> and<00:03:20.350> what<00:03:20.769> you<00:03:20.890> do<00:03:21.040> is

you press that button and it's going to

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:26.460 
you press that button and it's going to
let<00:03:23.260> the<00:03:23.380> carbonation<00:03:23.980> go

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:26.470 

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:27.810 

as<00:03:26.530> you<00:03:26.620> can<00:03:26.740> see<00:03:26.980> it's<00:03:27.100> starting<00:03:27.340> to<00:03:27.520> foam

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:27.820 
as you can see it's starting to foam

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:29.850 
as you can see it's starting to foam
foam<00:03:28.210> up<00:03:28.420> and<00:03:28.660> if<00:03:29.080> you<00:03:29.170> don't<00:03:29.350> like<00:03:29.500> the<00:03:29.650> way<00:03:29.740> it

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
foams you can always just do one more
