00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760
 and what's up and gamers are deepening and 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:05.100
 that if today we find ourselves for 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.049
 a video talking about the new call dlc 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.670
 of duty black ops the indeed the dlc 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.070
 insurgents these little ones just a 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.090
 fat fake or so is it a real dlc 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.389
 that's what we're going to try to 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.389
 discover 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.320
 first of all we end up on call of 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.030
 black duty ops for the gameplay you 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.130
 have in front of you simply on 

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:33.540
 the jacket app I am equipped with the mp 7 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.820
 and we're going to tackle this 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.080
 famous dlc insurge years then for my 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.120
 insurgents share would simply 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:40.559
 a big fake and that's it and I have a lot of 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.030
 evidence we'll just see and 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:43.620
 although this picture that you have under 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.239
 the eyes and very professional it's 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.320
 true that we could all have fallen into the 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.680
 panel but I still have some 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.430
 pictures and some small and well 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.660
 impurities I want to say well 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.160
 that they will prove to us what 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.750
 it's a fake actually what made me 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.460
 smart to the ear already to prove that 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.920
 it was a fake it's already the man 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.320
 the soldier and jediat on the cimade map 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.850
 ged and well and simply and well 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.350
 a happiness a character I had 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.460
 already in my pnj so I found that 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:06.990
 weird enough that reuses a 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.280
 character and here I can show you 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.050
 under the eyes as I had already 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.340
 but in addition what is a little more 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.530
 amazing is that we are going to 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.540
 attack now at the map volts he has 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.680
 watched the character him too and white 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.970
 I had it simply is this 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.800
 character i drew from call of duty 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:21.510
 modern warfare 3 us what is a little 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:23.100
 pulled by the ears why a 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.080
 beach character club 2 is a 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.400
 character mw3 what makes me who 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.710
 seems pretty weird but you're going 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.509
 see possible on the map museum so 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.460
 finally the map so-called museum and well 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.079
 the character is a character from 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.079
 modern warfare 3 the one on the right 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.670
 and well is a character of mw3 so what 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.740
 which is pretty weird I do not understand 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.420
 not why lake the modern warfare series 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.219
 and well would like to put characters 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.840
 black ops in the series must can 

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:47.219
 understand that it's not too much 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.390
 war between them two but that trillard 

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:49.740
 I want all the time to do better the 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.270
 blocks affinity wardenski nature a 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.829
 always want to do better and well 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.359
 that treyarch which I do not see why 

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.829
 would use the same characters 

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:57.119
 what seems to me pretty big fake is 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.109
 also and that's what really 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.600
 put the chip in your ear 

00:01:58.109 --> 00:02:02.219
 the character of the swype map is good 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.500
 is simply a fired person 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:06.600
 the map is drawn by the game so 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.130
 call of duty black ops first of the name in 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.630
 effect is the character with the 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.520
 red cap and one that holds a 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.260
 m16 here is the evidence before your eyes 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.820
 but what gets me even more is 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.980
 give back the chip to the ear is already 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:17.610
 the background image that I had already seen on 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.200
 Internet 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.880
 indeed this background image is well 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.470
 to be is this simply rediscoverable the 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.760
 play the watch now you see that 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.650
 I just have him is the 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.030
 same picture but empty but hey there you 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.520
 can you say ok ok the 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.080
 characters and all and not too much but 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.640
 well maybe it's true but it's 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.450
 not too much I'm a bit hesitant but 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.620
 here is 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.360
 I want to say the teacher who put me 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.739
 actually the chip to the ear for 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.180
 prove well that these were false 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:40.769
 first of all I do not see why he 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.290
 would announce a dlc two months later 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:44.160
 with such a perfect image and his own 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.650
 saying that would be a bit of a picture 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.390
 stolen and this is an image to strip 

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.709
 net like the ultra net so this is a 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.120
 little fishy but what is really 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:53.160
 big fake and well it's on the map 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.349
 zombie she strawberry indeed the map 

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.510
 el fire are already doing this crysis 3 that 

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:59.040
 I'm sure but in addition to staps if 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.370
 we play a little and well we can see that 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.629
 the zombie comes out of the frame well yes 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.880
 it's still pretty funny you're good 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:07.650
 the guy has really all worked well and 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.720
 he just forgot we did not have to see him 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.579
 he just forgot to erase and well the 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.230
 zombie leg in his png that very 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:14.010
 simply also findable on 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.510
 Internet 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.530
 and then that's just so what 

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:18.180
 who proves to us well and well that this 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.349
 death is a big fake at the same time 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.140
 the back image is simply 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:24.150
 a paste copy of amap turbine I 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.739
 show you the screenshot here and then 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.450
 this is on top of that the call of duty 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:29.099
 black ops what we hardly see with the 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.299
 white background et cetera I think it a little 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:31.590
 pulled by the ears I do not see 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:33.060
 why would I do that and then 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.519
 plus it's very simple has found a 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.110
 call of duty black ops of 1.6 and then 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:38.700
 that's what I want to do 

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:40.769
 tell you it's careful about everything 

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.000
 who can and turned on the internet says 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:43.620
 me now in the comments if 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.600
 you think that laugh non- insurgent 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.040
 go out done thanks to my video in all 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.630
 case for me I'm pretty sure 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.639
 this is a big fake because it shows 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.829
 what is there a lot of evidence and 

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:54.420
 especially people who are good 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:56.639
 people who are developing 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.410
 the images of the dlc and it's in call of 

00:03:56.639 --> 00:03:59.880
 duty black ops 2 and well in all our 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:01.170
 doors that the game is well should 

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:03.329
 to be professional it's true that a 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:03.660
 such mistake there the zombie coming out of the 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:05.310
 frame 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.590
 I do not think it would have happened to 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.209
 of activity and infinity ward I think 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.190
 that he would have quickly or triage pardon 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:12.359
 you will quickly erase this 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.769
 picture and then two months before the release 

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:14.790
 of the dlc I think it's a little fired 

00:04:13.769 --> 00:04:16.470
 by the hair 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.430
 and then here is anyway I hope that 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.200
 this video will have made you happy 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.609

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:24.030
 would answer a maximum and then that's it 

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.320
 track to all and I hope that 

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.970
 in any case would have believed me and you 

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.979
 believe now insurgent this info 

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.599
 dlc it's a big fake and then that's it 

00:04:28.979 --> 00:04:32.160
 but that made all these texts 6

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:36.120
