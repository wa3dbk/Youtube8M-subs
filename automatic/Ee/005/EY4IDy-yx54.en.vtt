cannon to its knees and then i can take
it<00:01:45.509> over<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:46.050> use<00:01:46.380> it<00:01:46.530> against<00:01:47.009> its<00:01:47.130> own<00:01:47.250> base

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 
it over and use it against its own base

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:50.690 
it over and use it against its own base
now<00:01:49.259> it's<00:01:49.410> not<00:01:49.500> all<00:01:49.710> about<00:01:49.740> offense<00:01:50.520> and

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
now it's not all about offense and

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.249 
now it's not all about offense and
ground<00:01:50.940> battles<00:01:51.360> it's<00:01:51.600> also<00:01:51.780> how<00:01:51.990> you<00:01:52.020> protect

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
ground battles it's also how you protect

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.440 
ground battles it's also how you protect
yourself<00:01:52.590> here<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.700> enemies<00:01:53.970> have<00:01:54.090> put<00:01:54.270> up<00:01:54.360> a

yourself here the enemies have put up a
giant<00:01:54.780> energy<00:01:55.140> shield<00:01:55.410> and<00:01:55.650> you<00:01:55.770> can't<00:01:55.979> get

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.190 
giant energy shield and you can't get

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:57.800 
giant energy shield and you can't get
through<00:01:56.490> using<00:01:56.790> vehicle<00:01:57.360> so<00:01:57.509> we're<00:01:57.630> going<00:01:57.720> to

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810
