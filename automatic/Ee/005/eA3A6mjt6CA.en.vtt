00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:13.500
 Welcome to another video! 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.570
 of today plus a boxing profile of my new 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.820
 pc we will talk about the keyboard or I 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.189
 I chose the strong technical keyboard is 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.260
 Of course, let's go for the features. 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.080
 of the box and has nine shortcut keys 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.580
 up minions are laser printed what 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.590
 it is not what happens with formally 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.230
 microsoft keyboard and other brands are 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.000
 and know how to use it there and 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.460
 simply leto skirts gets sometimes 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.640
 confused with which leet is 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.219
 wst is so fps has a color 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.230
 differentiated green and is very 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.719
 beautiful and has a special box too 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.570
 for noise reduction 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.579
 You did not get it right, there was nothing at all. 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.539
 it is very quiet because it is 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.270
 compatible with any system 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.350
 it is usb the cable law is not 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.360
 locked 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.030
 He really is that plastic on the outside. 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.800
 however he is well resistant is a record 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.750
 it's a grosser car than that 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.210
 traditional good talking a little about 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.549
 he is really dedicated lovers of 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.490
 games by having these keys differentiated 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.560
 to be very soft up on the side he 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.799
 has details in black piano that 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:20.610
 continues with the multimedia shortcuts 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.720
 it has 19 easy-to-use keys 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.150
 access 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.130
 I paid r 25 reais, it's a great 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.659
 cost benefit because in the same system 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.759
 I did the mouse for those who did not see the 

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.490
 link is in the description that not only 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.049
 spend 150 pips on a keyboard because 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.990
 Like I said, there are people playing with a 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:39.390
 mouse strips and wins the people who lived and 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.090
 that buying more than 500 gave in but I know 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.409
 that is not a pause year is knowing how to play 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.320
 more people like the mouse more 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.270
 comfortable that keyboard it was 25 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.340
 real each and he is very good he is 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.280
 beautiful it is silent design is very 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.730
 elegant then the price of it will want 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:58.040
 buy a keyboard of 300 reais 

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:00.260
 they can sell it then it's worth 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.750
 Worth it if you also have enough keyboard 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.800
 with and there do research direct 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.380
 because sometimes it's better to save a 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.480
 Always keep money aside. 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.790
 mouse to ask but without a pilot and a 

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:12.980
 keyboard that you find and invest another 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:15.320
 video card that will do much better 

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.720
 Then for your maqbool I'll stay here with 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.370
 this is boxing per view i hope 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.100
 have liked to check other videos there 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.600
 the channel register if it was not written 

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.330
 and short the page in the face if any day 

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.840
 This is all good, I'm here. 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.840
