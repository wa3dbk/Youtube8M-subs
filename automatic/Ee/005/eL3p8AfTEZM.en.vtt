the eight ball six step which is a six

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.189 
the eight ball six step which is a six
step<00:00:29.160> but<00:00:29.610> in<00:00:29.699> this<00:00:29.820> case<00:00:30.060> both<00:00:30.510> directions<00:00:30.900> in

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
step but in this case both directions in

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.919 
step but in this case both directions in
an<00:00:31.350> eight<00:00:31.470> ball<00:00:31.619> shape<00:00:31.949> check<00:00:32.640> it<00:00:32.759> out<00:00:32.879> what<00:00:33.839> it

00:00:33.919 --> 00:00:33.929 
an eight ball shape check it out what it

00:00:33.929 --> 00:00:39.160 
an eight ball shape check it out what it
is

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:39.170 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.920 

once<00:00:39.770> you<00:00:39.890> got<00:00:40.010> that<00:00:40.420> we're<00:00:41.420> gonna<00:00:41.510> move<00:00:41.780> with

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:41.930 
once you got that we're gonna move with

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.610 
once you got that we're gonna move with
it<00:00:41.989> you're<00:00:42.710> gonna<00:00:42.800> extend<00:00:43.040> your<00:00:43.879> right<00:00:44.090> leg<00:00:44.149> up

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:44.620 
it you're gonna extend your right leg up

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.100 
it you're gonna extend your right leg up
you<00:00:45.620> get<00:00:45.739> a<00:00:45.800> pretty<00:00:45.980> left<00:00:46.309> leg<00:00:46.489> in<00:00:46.730> do<00:00:47.720> a<00:00:47.750> six

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.110 
you get a pretty left leg in do a six

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.590 
you get a pretty left leg in do a six
step<00:00:48.280> and<00:00:49.280> then<00:00:49.850> from<00:00:50.030> here<00:00:50.059> the<00:00:50.449> original

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
step and then from here the original

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.310 
step and then from here the original
position

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:51.320 
position

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.790 
position
you<00:00:51.710> send<00:00:51.949> the<00:00:52.010> left<00:00:52.190> leg<00:00:52.280> up<00:00:52.550> and<00:00:52.940> go<00:00:53.120> that<00:00:53.300> way

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:53.800 
you send the left leg up and go that way

00:00:53.800 --> 00:01:00.189 
you send the left leg up and go that way
same<00:00:54.800> step<00:00:55.629> then<00:00:56.629> you<00:00:56.690> continue<00:00:58.960> and<00:00:59.960> so<00:01:00.110> you

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:00.199 
same step then you continue and so you

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:07.800 
same step then you continue and so you
make<00:01:00.350> an<00:01:00.470> Eightball<00:01:00.620> shape

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.960 

so<00:01:08.650> hopefully<00:01:09.040> you<00:01:09.159> got<00:01:09.280> that<00:01:09.549> now<00:01:09.700> we<00:01:09.760> can

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:09.970 
so hopefully you got that now we can

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.640 
so hopefully you got that now we can

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
the advance forward techniques now we

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.990 
the advance forward techniques now we
can<00:01:50.320> move<00:01:50.409> on<00:01:50.590> to<00:01:50.680> advanced<00:01:51.100> transitions

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:52.000 
can move on to advanced transitions

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.450 
can move on to advanced transitions
remember<00:01:52.720> transitions<00:01:53.649> are<00:01:53.979> the<00:01:54.130> key<00:01:54.340> to

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
remember transitions are the key to

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.460 
remember transitions are the key to
b-boying<00:01:54.820> and<00:01:55.060> the<00:01:55.330> key<00:01:55.509> to<00:01:55.600> footwork<00:01:55.990> check

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:56.470 
b-boying and the key to footwork check

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:56.940 
b-boying and the key to footwork check
it<00:01:56.590> out

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
it out

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.100 
it out
so<00:01:57.189> first<00:01:57.430> your<00:01:57.610> startup<00:01:57.939> up<00:01:58.090> top<00:01:58.360> you're

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
so first your startup up top you're

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:01.560 
so first your startup up top you're
gonna<00:01:59.170> bring<00:01:59.409> your<00:01:59.470> left<00:01:59.710> leg<00:01:59.830> down<00:02:00.570> you're

your right foot and push and spin
directly<00:02:09.459> back<00:02:09.670> into<00:02:09.700> this<00:02:10.030> position<00:02:12.690> that's

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
directly back into this position that's

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.940 
directly back into this position that's
a<00:02:13.810> no<00:02:13.900> hand<00:02:14.110> transition<00:02:14.620> check<00:02:14.800> it<00:02:14.890> out<00:02:15.450> again

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
a no hand transition check it out again

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:20.100 
a no hand transition check it out again
that's<00:02:17.950> like<00:02:18.160> down<00:02:18.450> right<00:02:19.450> leg<00:02:19.660> connected

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
that's like down right leg connected

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:30.090 
that's like down right leg connected
push<00:02:20.319> off<00:02:20.500> of<00:02:20.530> both

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.100 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.500 

there<00:02:31.100> you<00:02:31.220> go<00:02:31.370> you<00:02:31.580> learn<00:02:31.730> some<00:02:31.910> advance<00:02:32.210> for

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
there you go you learn some advance for
