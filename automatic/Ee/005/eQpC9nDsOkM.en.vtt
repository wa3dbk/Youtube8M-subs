00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.440 
from and then it looks like we made them
that<00:00:32.579> way<00:00:32.700> huh<00:00:32.880> he<00:00:33.870> has<00:00:34.110> to<00:00:34.320> iron<00:00:34.760> it<00:00:35.760> holds<00:00:36.270> him

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
that way huh he has to iron it holds him

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.869 
that way huh he has to iron it holds him
it<00:00:36.780> holds<00:00:37.050> heat<00:00:37.320> well<00:00:37.559> takes<00:00:37.980> a<00:00:38.100> while<00:00:38.430> to<00:00:38.460> get

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
it holds heat well takes a while to get

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.270 
it holds heat well takes a while to get
it<00:00:39.030> hot<00:00:39.239> it's<00:00:39.989> not<00:00:40.140> real<00:00:40.500> uniform<00:00:41.040> so<00:00:41.190> you're

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
it hot it's not real uniform so you're

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.500

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
going to be hotter here and hotter there

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.350 
going to be hotter here and hotter there
especially<00:00:42.899> where<00:00:43.230> your<00:00:43.350> your<00:00:43.879> your<00:00:44.879> gas<00:00:45.090> is

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360

cast<00:00:46.289> iron<00:00:46.440> holds<00:00:46.860> heat<00:00:47.039> well<00:00:47.250> but<00:00:48.149> also<00:00:48.360> we

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
cast iron holds heat well but also we

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.420 
cast iron holds heat well but also we
keeps<00:00:49.110> your<00:00:49.289> grill<00:00:49.590> from<00:00:49.920> being<00:00:50.129> very

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:52.770 
flexible going up and down so when you

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:55.580 
flexible going up and down so when you

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
take this out of the equation now you

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.819 
take this out of the equation now you
have<00:00:56.039> the<00:00:56.879> grill<00:00:57.149> grates<00:00:57.500> handling<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.620> heat

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
have the grill grates handling the heat

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.970 
have the grill grates handling the heat
this<00:00:59.609> girl<00:00:59.879> gets<00:01:00.059> hotter<00:01:00.300> twice<00:01:00.690> as<00:01:00.870> fast<00:01:01.140> on<00:01:01.920> a
