00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
also this fourth quarter this is this is

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.210 
also this fourth quarter this is this is
prime<00:04:26.020> time<00:04:26.050> right<00:04:26.590> here<00:04:26.770> this<00:04:26.949> is<00:04:27.010> where

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
prime time right here this is where

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.760

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
everything counts he was getting huge

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.490 
everything counts he was getting huge
yardage<00:04:30.250> on<00:04:30.400> the<00:04:30.550> ground<00:04:31.110> he's<00:04:32.110> looking

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
yardage on the ground he's looking

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:35.610 
yardage on the ground he's looking
around<00:04:32.590> getting<00:04:33.370> huge<00:04:33.639> yard<00:04:34.000> in<00:04:34.300> the<00:04:34.330> air<00:04:34.690> I'm

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
around getting huge yard in the air I'm

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.920 
around getting huge yard in the air I'm
in<00:04:36.250> this<00:04:36.400> is<00:04:36.580> fourth<00:04:36.820> quarters<00:04:37.180> only<00:04:37.360> three

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
in this is fourth quarters only three

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.050 
in this is fourth quarters only three
minutes<00:04:38.080> left<00:04:38.550> this<00:04:39.550> was<00:04:39.699> before<00:04:39.820> the

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060 
minutes left this was before the

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:41.520 
minutes left this was before the
2-minute<00:04:40.540> warning<00:04:40.690> but<00:04:41.020> he<00:04:41.139> looks<00:04:41.320> and

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:41.530 
2-minute warning but he looks and

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:44.100 
2-minute warning but he looks and
guessing<00:04:41.830> right<00:04:41.949> in<00:04:42.130> there<00:04:42.720> so<00:04:43.720> that<00:04:43.750> was<00:04:44.080> a

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 
guessing right in there so that was a

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:47.640 
guessing right in there so that was a
huge<00:04:44.460> huge<00:04:45.460> plate<00:04:45.970> we<00:04:46.660> end<00:04:46.930> up<00:04:47.050> stopping<00:04:47.320> right

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:47.650 
huge huge plate we end up stopping right

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:48.780 
huge huge plate we end up stopping right
here<00:04:47.710> when<00:04:47.979> he<00:04:48.040> goes<00:04:48.220> for<00:04:48.370> the<00:04:48.430> two-point

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:48.790 
here when he goes for the two-point

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:51.540 
here when he goes for the two-point
conversion<00:04:49.389> so<00:04:49.479> he<00:04:49.600> can<00:04:49.750> be<00:04:49.870> about<00:04:50.139> seven<00:04:50.620> so

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
conversion so he can be about seven so

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.060 
conversion so he can be about seven so
now<00:04:51.699> we<00:04:51.760> got<00:04:52.000> two<00:04:52.300> minutes<00:04:52.570> to<00:04:52.720> score<00:04:53.080> two

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:54.070 
now we got two minutes to score two

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:55.740 
now we got two minutes to score two
minutes<00:04:54.430> and<00:04:54.610> 6<00:04:54.850> seconds<00:04:55.330> so<00:04:55.479> right<00:04:55.630> here

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750 
minutes and 6 seconds so right here

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:57.180 
minutes and 6 seconds so right here
twice<00:04:55.990> maybe<00:04:56.350> you're<00:04:56.560> gonna<00:04:56.710> go<00:04:56.919> for<00:04:57.130> the

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.190 
twice maybe you're gonna go for the

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:01.140 
twice maybe you're gonna go for the
touchdown<00:04:57.490> and<00:04:58.270> no<00:04:59.310> he<00:05:00.310> took<00:05:00.520> a<00:05:00.580> really<00:05:00.880> good

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:01.150

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:03.850 
angle on defense all right there we go

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:07.050 
angle on defense all right there we go
