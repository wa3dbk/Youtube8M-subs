00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:07.060 
some really simple not expensive
organizing<00:01:04.129> solution<00:01:05.260> two-tiered<00:01:06.260> so<00:01:06.950> we

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:07.070 
organizing solution two-tiered so we

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.100 
organizing solution two-tiered so we
made<00:01:07.850> use<00:01:08.030> of<00:01:08.060> the<00:01:08.330> vertical<00:01:08.660> space<00:01:08.900> within
