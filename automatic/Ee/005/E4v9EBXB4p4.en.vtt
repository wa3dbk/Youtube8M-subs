this<00:03:39.970> could<00:03:40.239> equal<00:03:40.630> something<00:03:41.019> even<00:03:41.319> bigger<00:03:41.680> I

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
this could equal something even bigger I

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.879 
this could equal something even bigger I
don't<00:03:43.120> even<00:03:43.239> know<00:03:43.480> what<00:03:43.660> th<00:03:44.109> gonna<00:03:44.350> do<00:03:44.590> after

don't even know what th gonna do after

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:46.500 
don't even know what th gonna do after
they<00:03:45.010> come<00:03:45.190> back<00:03:45.370> from<00:03:45.400> this<00:03:45.700> one<00:03:45.760> impulse<00:03:46.359> is

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
they come back from this one impulse is

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:47.819 
they come back from this one impulse is
already<00:03:46.840> going<00:03:46.900> to<00:03:47.019> have<00:03:47.139> control<00:03:47.470> the<00:03:47.650> map

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:47.829 
already going to have control the map

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:49.650 
already going to have control the map
they<00:03:48.130> have<00:03:48.340> control<00:03:48.639> of<00:03:48.880> this<00:03:49.090> fight<00:03:49.450> and

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
they have control of this fight and

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:52.800 
they have control of this fight and
teammate<00:03:50.620> overstayed<00:03:51.549> their<00:03:51.579> welcome<00:03:51.819> okay

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
teammate overstayed their welcome okay

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.319 
teammate overstayed their welcome okay
so<00:03:53.410> teammate<00:03:53.709> just<00:03:54.010> needs<00:03:54.190> to<00:03:54.340> force<00:03:54.730> impulse

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:55.329 
so teammate just needs to force impulse

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:57.569 
so teammate just needs to force impulse
to<00:03:55.510> check<00:03:55.900> bear<00:03:56.170> and<00:03:56.530> then<00:03:57.250> they<00:03:57.340> can<00:03:57.459> get<00:03:57.549> a

00:03:57.569 --> 00:03:57.579 
to check bear and then they can get a

00:03:57.579 --> 00:03:58.430 
to check bear and then they can get a
fight

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
fight

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:00.080
