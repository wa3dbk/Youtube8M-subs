I do love the artwork in this series the
only<00:01:37.890> thing<00:01:38.070> I<00:01:38.189> might<00:01:38.400> have<00:01:38.670> is<00:01:39.119> at<00:01:39.329> times<00:01:39.630> it

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
only thing I might have is at times it

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.260 
only thing I might have is at times it
seemed<00:01:40.170> like<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:41.220> inks<00:01:41.670> were<00:01:41.820> a<00:01:41.850> little

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
seemed like the the inks were a little

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.149 
seemed like the the inks were a little
light<00:01:42.479> and<00:01:42.689> you<00:01:42.840> see<00:01:43.049> a<00:01:43.079> lot<00:01:43.320> of<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.649> pencils

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
light and you see a lot of the pencils

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:44.780 
light and you see a lot of the pencils
in<00:01:44.340> here

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
in here

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.420 
in here

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
but that's okay because I felt like that

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.130 
but that's okay because I felt like that
it<00:01:47.790> really<00:01:48.420> had<00:01:48.689> that<00:01:48.899> natural<00:01:49.740> feel<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:51.140> it

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
it really had that natural feel to it

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.289 
it really had that natural feel to it
when<00:01:52.380> you<00:01:52.500> see<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:53.070> pencils<00:01:53.549> in<00:01:53.729> here<00:01:53.970> so<00:01:54.149> it

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
when you see the pencils in here so it

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.990

that it provided here was really nice to
look<00:02:25.170> at<00:02:25.379> and<00:02:25.440> I<00:02:25.680> really<00:02:26.069> found<00:02:26.250> myself<00:02:26.519> just

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:26.879 
look at and I really found myself just

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:29.420

going oh my god this is really cool
so<00:02:29.819> what<00:02:29.970> would<00:02:30.060> I<00:02:30.209> think<00:02:30.239> of<00:02:30.569> this<00:02:30.660> particular

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
so what would I think of this particular

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.009 
so what would I think of this particular
story<00:02:32.000> it<00:02:33.000> was<00:02:33.150> pretty<00:02:33.360> interesting<00:02:33.690> because

00:02:34.009 --> 00:02:34.019 
story it was pretty interesting because

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:36.850 
story it was pretty interesting because
it<00:02:34.349> really<00:02:34.650> gives<00:02:34.830> you<00:02:35.010> a<00:02:35.040> sum<00:02:35.430> up<00:02:35.610> of<00:02:35.819> you<00:02:36.420> know

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
it really gives you a sum up of you know

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.160 
it really gives you a sum up of you know
what<00:02:37.860> the<00:02:38.430> tarragon<00:02:38.910> mist<00:02:39.269> is<00:02:39.540> how<00:02:39.959> it's

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
what the tarragon mist is how it's

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.020 
what the tarragon mist is how it's
making<00:02:40.560> its<00:02:40.799> approach<00:02:41.160> it's<00:02:41.670> going<00:02:41.940> to

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
making its approach it's going to

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.509 
making its approach it's going to
different<00:02:42.420> parts<00:02:42.660> of<00:02:42.780> the<00:02:42.930> country<00:02:43.590> it's

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
different parts of the country it's

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:47.120 
different parts of the country it's
hitting<00:02:44.849> some<00:02:45.090> random<00:02:45.660> people<00:02:45.930> and<00:02:46.470> it<00:02:46.950> goes

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.130 
hitting some random people and it goes

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.729 
hitting some random people and it goes
into<00:02:47.370> this<00:02:47.670> random<00:02:48.330> character<00:02:49.049> this<00:02:49.260> random

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
into this random character this random

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:52.580 
into this random character this random
villain<00:02:50.390> that<00:02:51.390> kind<00:02:51.720> of<00:02:51.840> looks<00:02:52.019> like<00:02:52.110> beast

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:52.590 
villain that kind of looks like beast

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:55.550 
villain that kind of looks like beast
and<00:02:52.890> I<00:02:52.950> thought<00:02:53.160> it<00:02:53.340> was<00:02:53.519> him<00:02:53.880> at<00:02:54.090> first<00:02:54.560> when

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
and I thought it was him at first when

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.190 
and I thought it was him at first when
this<00:02:55.890> mist<00:02:56.400> actually<00:02:57.060> takes<00:02:57.329> over<00:02:57.690> this<00:02:57.900> guy

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
this mist actually takes over this guy

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.880 
this mist actually takes over this guy
this<00:02:58.560> this<00:02:59.160> guy<00:02:59.400> in<00:02:59.640> the<00:02:59.819> bar<00:03:00.030> here<00:03:00.450> and<00:03:00.739> he<00:03:01.739> was

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
this this guy in the bar here and he was

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:05.390 
this this guy in the bar here and he was
actually<00:03:02.310> becoming<00:03:02.670> an<00:03:02.910> inhuman<00:03:03.860> and<00:03:04.860> you

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.400 
actually becoming an inhuman and you

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.039 
actually becoming an inhuman and you
know<00:03:05.519> we<00:03:05.880> have<00:03:06.090> a<00:03:06.299> flashback<00:03:06.630> here<00:03:07.380> of<00:03:09.019> Medusa

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:10.049 
know we have a flashback here of Medusa

00:03:10.049 --> 00:03:12.860 
know we have a flashback here of Medusa
