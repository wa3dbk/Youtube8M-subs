00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 It's not that I've always had a child 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.400
 like that connection with the goal 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:11.099
 then I do not remember the player in another 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.730
 position that does not go ahead and talks more 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.500
 already as now with two years old you were talking 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.940
 with a fluency that is here we hallucinate 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.769
 when we saw it we remember a moment 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:26.519
 moment a moment moment I feel 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:28.650
 at home because if with God they have 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.349
 to help us and we do not inculcate 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.809
 always the written before the parents 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.170
 the teachers the referees of all that 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.589
 the essential thing to form people 

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:42.679
 it's like famous football players was someone 

00:00:39.589 --> 00:00:44.210

00:00:42.679 --> 00:00:46.640
 colombian football and alan and that's when 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.070
 this big and well the fame is that 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:52.329

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:55.360
 do not leave stable and radamel falcao no 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:58.629
 I was Brazilian because he placed it like that because 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:01.070
 back then there was a player called 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:05.690
 for the real he took the ko 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:10.030

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:12.280
