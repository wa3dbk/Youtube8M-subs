assault<00:01:55.829> rifle<00:01:56.280> but<00:01:56.820> do<00:01:56.909> I<00:01:56.969> think<00:01:57.210> it's

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
assault rifle but do I think it's

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.300 
assault rifle but do I think it's
overpowered<00:01:57.869> you<00:01:58.020> know<00:01:58.140> maybe<00:01:58.619> the<00:01:59.070> only

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
overpowered you know maybe the only

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.280 
overpowered you know maybe the only
thing<00:01:59.490> that<00:01:59.610> I<00:01:59.700> found<00:01:59.969> that<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.360> gun<00:02:00.540> oh<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:01.259> i

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
thing that I found that the gun oh and i

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.230 
thing that I found that the gun oh and i
just<00:02:01.469> bought<00:02:01.649> myself<00:02:01.799> oh<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.850> only<00:02:02.969> thing<00:02:03.149> i

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
just bought myself oh the only thing i

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.690 
just bought myself oh the only thing i
found<00:02:03.479> that<00:02:03.689> the<00:02:03.780> gun<00:02:03.960> kind<00:02:04.350> of<00:02:04.530> has<00:02:05.189> a<00:02:05.460> little

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
found that the gun kind of has a little

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.700 
found that the gun kind of has a little
bit<00:02:06.090> too<00:02:06.329> strong<00:02:06.630> on<00:02:06.840> is<00:02:07.079> the<00:02:07.290> fact<00:02:07.320> that<00:02:07.619> it

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
bit too strong on is the fact that it

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.210 
bit too strong on is the fact that it
has<00:02:07.950> extremely<00:02:08.640> tight<00:02:09.599> hip<00:02:09.869> fire<00:02:10.140> and<00:02:10.440> see

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
has extremely tight hip fire and see

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.339 
has extremely tight hip fire and see
it's<00:02:11.610> a<00:02:11.730> two<00:02:11.879> bullet<00:02:12.120> kill<00:02:12.300> it<00:02:12.450> does<00:02:12.569> 52<00:02:12.989> damage

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
it's a two bullet kill it does 52 damage

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:13.800 
it's a two bullet kill it does 52 damage
per<00:02:13.500> bowl

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
per bowl

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.699 
per bowl
at<00:02:13.959> it<00:02:14.290> within<00:02:14.770> range<00:02:15.900> but<00:02:16.900> it's<00:02:17.050> balanced<00:02:17.560> by

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
at it within range but it's balanced by

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:19.470 
at it within range but it's balanced by
the<00:02:17.770> fact<00:02:18.099> that<00:02:18.220> it<00:02:18.430> has<00:02:18.520> a<00:02:18.550> really<00:02:18.849> quick<00:02:19.150> drop

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
the fact that it has a really quick drop

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:22.410 
the fact that it has a really quick drop
off<00:02:19.690> where<00:02:20.020> it<00:02:20.110> becomes<00:02:20.349> a<00:02:20.530> 223<00:02:21.489> bur<00:02:21.670> skill<00:02:22.060> at

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
off where it becomes a 223 bur skill at

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.500 
off where it becomes a 223 bur skill at
range<00:02:22.720> so<00:02:23.550> it<00:02:24.550> really<00:02:24.730> drops<00:02:25.090> off<00:02:25.270> really

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
range so it really drops off really

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.330 
range so it really drops off really
quickly<00:02:25.810> to<00:02:26.050> the<00:02:26.140> point<00:02:26.380> where<00:02:26.620> you<00:02:27.040> got<00:02:27.250> to

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340 
quickly to the point where you got to

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:28.949 
quickly to the point where you got to
think<00:02:27.520> about<00:02:27.700> getting<00:02:27.880> that<00:02:28.270> second<00:02:28.720> you<00:02:28.870> know

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
think about getting that second you know

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.110 
think about getting that second you know
second<00:02:29.470> burst<00:02:29.680> into<00:02:29.950> a<00:02:29.980> guy<00:02:30.190> and<00:02:30.670> that's<00:02:30.940> where

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
second burst into a guy and that's where

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.670 
second burst into a guy and that's where
the<00:02:31.209> rapid<00:02:31.630> fire<00:02:31.810> attachment<00:02:32.349> comes<00:02:32.500> in

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
the rapid fire attachment comes in

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.140 
the rapid fire attachment comes in
because<00:02:32.830> the<00:02:33.160> rapid<00:02:33.459> fire<00:02:33.610> attachment

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.150 
because the rapid fire attachment

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:36.780 
because the rapid fire attachment
actually<00:02:34.569> allows<00:02:35.019> you<00:02:35.319> to<00:02:35.530> have<00:02:36.250> less<00:02:36.550> time

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
actually allows you to have less time

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.160 
actually allows you to have less time
between<00:02:36.970> bursts<00:02:37.540> and<00:02:37.599> that<00:02:37.720> becomes<00:02:37.959> pretty

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
between bursts and that becomes pretty

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:39.660 
between bursts and that becomes pretty
important<00:02:38.650> in<00:02:38.739> my<00:02:38.890> opinion<00:02:38.920> I<00:02:39.370> think<00:02:39.400> that

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
important in my opinion I think that

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.940 
important in my opinion I think that
it's<00:02:39.790> it's<00:02:40.060> nice<00:02:40.239> to<00:02:40.480> have<00:02:40.690> the<00:02:41.050> ability<00:02:41.410> to<00:02:41.440> to

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
it's it's nice to have the ability to to

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:43.860 
it's it's nice to have the ability to to
change<00:02:42.220> the<00:02:42.459> thus<00:02:42.819> firing<00:02:43.239> speeds<00:02:43.480> on<00:02:43.690> your

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
change the thus firing speeds on your

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.240 
change the thus firing speeds on your
weapons<00:02:44.230> I<00:02:44.349> think<00:02:44.530> that's<00:02:44.650> pretty<00:02:44.800> cool<00:02:45.069> if

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
weapons I think that's pretty cool if

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.600 
weapons I think that's pretty cool if
you<00:02:45.310> ask<00:02:45.400> me<00:02:46.080> normally<00:02:47.080> it<00:02:47.170> was<00:02:47.319> just<00:02:47.530> for<00:02:48.190> SMD

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:48.610 
you ask me normally it was just for SMD

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.340 
you ask me normally it was just for SMD
is<00:02:48.760> now<00:02:49.060> you<00:02:49.120> can<00:02:49.360> put<00:02:49.510> it<00:02:49.600> on<00:02:49.720> you<00:02:49.930> know<00:02:50.049> a<00:02:50.080> lot

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
is now you can put it on you know a lot

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.470 
is now you can put it on you know a lot
of<00:02:50.380> weapons<00:02:50.590> so<00:02:51.040> that's<00:02:51.580> cool<00:02:51.819> i<00:02:52.000> like<00:02:52.239> having

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:52.480 
of weapons so that's cool i like having

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.270 
of weapons so that's cool i like having
it<00:02:52.660> on<00:02:52.750> the<00:02:52.930> three<00:02:53.080> bursts<00:02:53.290> weapons<00:02:53.650> the<00:02:53.739> m16

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
it on the three bursts weapons the m16

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.220 
it on the three bursts weapons the m16
almost<00:02:54.640> needs<00:02:54.880> it<00:02:55.090> no<00:02:55.390> matter<00:02:55.600> what<00:02:55.930> just

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
almost needs it no matter what just

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.320 
almost needs it no matter what just
because<00:02:56.260> it<00:02:56.560> shoots<00:02:56.799> so<00:02:57.010> slowly<00:02:57.400> so<00:02:58.180> if<00:02:58.239> you're

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
because it shoots so slowly so if you're

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.300 
because it shoots so slowly so if you're
going<00:02:58.450> to<00:02:58.510> use<00:02:58.630> the<00:02:58.780> SMG<00:02:59.260> or<00:02:59.500> the<00:02:59.680> fsm<00:03:00.099> cheese

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
going to use the SMG or the fsm cheese

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.270 
going to use the SMG or the fsm cheese
the<00:03:00.519> m16<00:03:01.030> definitely<00:03:01.510> suggest<00:03:01.870> that<00:03:02.130> the<00:03:03.130> like

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280

the m16 definitely suggest that the like
i<00:03:03.370> said<00:03:03.519> this<00:03:03.640> is<00:03:03.819> a<00:03:03.849> two<00:03:04.090> bullet<00:03:04.360> kill<00:03:04.569> it<00:03:04.900> does

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
i said this is a two bullet kill it does

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.170 
i said this is a two bullet kill it does
52<00:03:05.680> damage<00:03:06.040> which<00:03:06.220> is<00:03:06.370> more<00:03:06.519> than<00:03:06.549> any<00:03:06.760> weapon

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
52 damage which is more than any weapon

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.940 
52 damage which is more than any weapon
you<00:03:07.330> know<00:03:07.690> we've<00:03:07.870> seen<00:03:08.140> in<00:03:08.290> a<00:03:08.349> call<00:03:08.530> of<00:03:08.620> duty<00:03:08.860> it

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
you know we've seen in a call of duty it

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.850 
you know we've seen in a call of duty it
actually<00:03:09.250> does<00:03:09.430> more<00:03:09.670> damage<00:03:09.700> than<00:03:10.390> the<00:03:10.860> I

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
actually does more damage than the I

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.610 
actually does more damage than the I
think<00:03:12.430> the<00:03:12.489> m14<00:03:13.090> in<00:03:13.269> past<00:03:13.450> games<00:03:13.660> on<00:03:13.989> the<00:03:14.170> m14

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
think the m14 in past games on the m14

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.770 
think the m14 in past games on the m14
in<00:03:14.739> this<00:03:14.890> game<00:03:15.099> no<00:03:15.340> does<00:03:15.670> 70<00:03:16.150> damage<00:03:16.510> and<00:03:16.690> it's

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
in this game no does 70 damage and it's

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.509 
in this game no does 70 damage and it's
a<00:03:16.840> one-shot<00:03:17.140> headshot<00:03:17.769> so<00:03:17.950> it's<00:03:18.070> always<00:03:18.190> a<00:03:18.310> two

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
a one-shot headshot so it's always a two

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:21.509 
a one-shot headshot so it's always a two
bullet<00:03:18.790> kill<00:03:19.200> minimum<00:03:20.200> I<00:03:21.010> think<00:03:21.310> it<00:03:21.400> might

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 
bullet kill minimum I think it might

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:23.819 
bullet kill minimum I think it might
become<00:03:21.700> a<00:03:21.880> three<00:03:22.299> at<00:03:22.480> really<00:03:23.049> extreme<00:03:23.440> ranges

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:23.829 
become a three at really extreme ranges

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:25.800 
become a three at really extreme ranges
but<00:03:24.010> the<00:03:24.190> m14<00:03:24.760> is<00:03:24.940> a<00:03:24.970> beast<00:03:25.299> if<00:03:25.540> you<00:03:25.630> haven't

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
but the m14 is a beast if you haven't

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.479 
but the m14 is a beast if you haven't
tried<00:03:25.900> that<00:03:26.109> out<00:03:26.170> it's<00:03:26.440> also<00:03:26.739> a<00:03:26.920> monster<00:03:27.459> I

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:27.489 
tried that out it's also a monster I

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:29.430 
tried that out it's also a monster I
think<00:03:27.790> I<00:03:28.000> think<00:03:28.480> we<00:03:28.600> were<00:03:28.690> blessed<00:03:28.870> with<00:03:29.109> a<00:03:29.200> lot

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
think I think we were blessed with a lot

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:30.750 
think I think we were blessed with a lot
of<00:03:29.500> cool<00:03:29.739> weapons<00:03:30.100> in<00:03:30.190> this<00:03:30.280> game<00:03:30.489> and<00:03:30.609> what

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:30.760 
of cool weapons in this game and what

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.160 
of cool weapons in this game and what
the<00:03:30.880> heck<00:03:31.060> why<00:03:31.269> didn't<00:03:31.480> they<00:03:31.540> go<00:03:31.720> off<00:03:31.930> I<00:03:32.109> guess

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
the heck why didn't they go off I guess

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:35.729 
the heck why didn't they go off I guess
this<00:03:32.500> guy<00:03:32.709> has<00:03:32.920> on<00:03:33.069> stalker<00:03:33.549> and<00:03:34.560> stalker<00:03:35.560> is

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
this guy has on stalker and stalker is

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:36.990 
this guy has on stalker and stalker is
actually<00:03:35.980> a<00:03:36.040> pretty<00:03:36.160> good<00:03:36.250> perk<00:03:36.549> for<00:03:36.700> the<00:03:36.819> riot

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
actually a pretty good perk for the riot

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.460 
actually a pretty good perk for the riot
shield<00:03:37.090> because<00:03:37.450> I<00:03:37.600> think<00:03:37.720> they<00:03:37.930> consider<00:03:38.319> it

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
shield because I think they consider it

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:39.690 
shield because I think they consider it
aimed<00:03:38.620> down<00:03:38.799> sights<00:03:39.100> when<00:03:39.310> you're<00:03:39.430> holding

aimed down sights when you're holding

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.599 
aimed down sights when you're holding
the<00:03:39.790> riot<00:03:40.000> shield<00:03:40.090> up<00:03:40.420> so<00:03:41.109> you<00:03:42.040> actually<00:03:42.250> get

the<00:04:29.530> fact<00:04:29.740> that<00:04:29.830> the<00:04:30.010> rapid-fire<00:04:30.400> lot<00:04:30.850> makes

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
the fact that the rapid-fire lot makes

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.090 
the fact that the rapid-fire lot makes
it<00:04:31.449> a<00:04:31.510> much<00:04:31.720> more<00:04:31.930> powerful<00:04:32.139> weapon<00:04:32.710> or

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.100 
it a much more powerful weapon or

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.100 
it a much more powerful weapon or
perhaps<00:04:33.400> even<00:04:33.729> making<00:04:34.389> it<00:04:34.630> so<00:04:34.870> that<00:04:34.900> the

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
perhaps even making it so that the

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:39.000 
perhaps even making it so that the
hipfire<00:04:36.100> spread<00:04:36.310> isn't<00:04:36.850> as<00:04:36.940> tight<00:04:37.650> either<00:04:38.650> one

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.010 
hipfire spread isn't as tight either one

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:40.770 
hipfire spread isn't as tight either one
would<00:04:39.460> be<00:04:39.520> fine<00:04:39.850> with<00:04:39.880> me<00:04:40.120> i<00:04:40.240> think<00:04:40.449> that<00:04:40.690> it

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:40.780 
would be fine with me i think that it

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:42.030 
would be fine with me i think that it
would<00:04:40.840> still<00:04:41.110> keep<00:04:41.290> the<00:04:41.470> integrity<00:04:41.740> of<00:04:41.949> the

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:42.040 
would still keep the integrity of the

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:44.070 
would still keep the integrity of the
weapon<00:04:42.430> without<00:04:42.910> you<00:04:43.360> know<00:04:43.449> hindering<00:04:43.840> it<00:04:43.930> too

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
weapon without you know hindering it too

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
weapon without you know hindering it too
much<00:04:44.229> because<00:04:44.350> i<00:04:44.500> don't<00:04:44.680> really<00:04:44.800> think<00:04:45.010> that

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:45.100 
much because i don't really think that

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:46.230 
much because i don't really think that
this<00:04:45.250> is<00:04:45.310> a<00:04:45.430> weapon<00:04:45.669> that<00:04:45.820> needs<00:04:46.030> to<00:04:46.120> be

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
this is a weapon that needs to be

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.730 
this is a weapon that needs to be
patched<00:04:46.449> i<00:04:46.660> don't<00:04:46.810> think<00:04:46.990> any<00:04:47.139> weapons<00:04:47.530> in<00:04:47.650> the

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
patched i don't think any weapons in the

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.620 
patched i don't think any weapons in the
game<00:04:47.770> right<00:04:48.550> now<00:04:48.610> need<00:04:48.940> to<00:04:49.030> be<00:04:49.150> patched<00:04:49.389> i

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:49.630 
game right now need to be patched i

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:50.790 
game right now need to be patched i
think<00:04:49.810> that<00:04:49.930> the<00:04:50.020> type<00:04:50.169> maybe<00:04:50.320> five<00:04:50.530> is<00:04:50.650> going

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
think that the type maybe five is going

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.250 
think that the type maybe five is going
to<00:04:50.860> annoy<00:04:51.100> a<00:04:51.130> lot<00:04:51.430> of<00:04:51.550> people<00:04:51.870> but<00:04:52.870> in<00:04:53.110> my

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:53.260 
to annoy a lot of people but in my

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:55.170 
to annoy a lot of people but in my
opinion<00:04:53.350> riot<00:04:53.889> shield<00:04:54.190> annoy<00:04:54.490> me<00:04:54.729> a<00:04:54.760> lot<00:04:54.970> more

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180 
opinion riot shield annoy me a lot more

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:56.790 
opinion riot shield annoy me a lot more
and<00:04:55.510> I<00:04:55.600> don't<00:04:55.780> know<00:04:55.900> how<00:04:56.050> that<00:04:56.080> guy<00:04:56.380> killed<00:04:56.440> me

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:56.800 
and I don't know how that guy killed me

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.439 
and I don't know how that guy killed me
right<00:04:56.979> there<00:04:57.220> I<00:04:57.400> think<00:04:57.910> that<00:04:58.060> his<00:04:58.150> buddy

00:04:58.439 --> 00:04:58.449 
right there I think that his buddy

00:04:58.449 --> 00:05:00.180 
right there I think that his buddy
somehow<00:04:58.930> magically<00:04:59.139> shot<00:04:59.650> through<00:04:59.860> his<00:04:59.949> right

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
somehow magically shot through his right

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:01.590 
somehow magically shot through his right
shields<00:05:00.610> and<00:05:00.760> now<00:05:00.850> they've<00:05:01.030> made<00:05:01.240> me<00:05:01.360> mad

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:01.600 
shields and now they've made me mad

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:02.840 
shields and now they've made me mad

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:02.850 
where I'm just going to start shooting

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:05.670 
where I'm just going to start shooting
some<00:05:03.850> rockets<00:05:04.750> at<00:05:04.900> them<00:05:05.110> and<00:05:05.410> throwing

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:05.680 
some rockets at them and throwing

some rockets at them and throwing
bouncing<00:05:06.340> Betties<00:05:06.639> at<00:05:06.820> them<00:05:07.080> because<00:05:08.080> they've

bouncing Betties at them because they've

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:11.010 
bouncing Betties at them because they've

made me mad but Kill Confirmed is a

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:12.600 
made me mad but Kill Confirmed is a

I mean that guy came at me with his

I mean that guy came at me with his
secondary<00:05:30.820> out<00:05:31.030> obviously<00:05:31.479> I<00:05:31.570> was<00:05:31.960> going<00:05:32.229> to

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:32.320 
secondary out obviously I was going to

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.200 
secondary out obviously I was going to
win<00:05:32.440> that<00:05:32.500> battle<00:05:32.940> but<00:05:33.940> there's<00:05:34.090> the

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:34.210 
win that battle but there's the

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:36.029 
win that battle but there's the
occasional<00:05:34.300> time<00:05:34.900> where<00:05:35.169> a<00:05:35.200> guy<00:05:35.380> with<00:05:35.590> an<00:05:35.710> SMG

00:05:36.029 --> 00:05:36.039 
occasional time where a guy with an SMG

00:05:36.039 --> 00:05:38.129 
occasional time where a guy with an SMG
you<00:05:36.400> know<00:05:36.520> and<00:05:36.729> um<00:05:36.880> p<00:05:37.090> runs<00:05:37.419> up<00:05:37.599> on<00:05:37.720> somebody

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:38.139 
you know and um p runs up on somebody

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:40.230 
you know and um p runs up on somebody
with<00:05:38.410> a<00:05:38.440> tight<00:05:38.770> 95<00:05:38.950> and<00:05:39.460> the<00:05:39.910> guy<00:05:40.060> with<00:05:40.210> the

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240 
with a tight 95 and the guy with the

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.320 
with a tight 95 and the guy with the
tight<00:05:40.479> 95<00:05:40.660> gets<00:05:41.080> lucky<00:05:41.289> and<00:05:41.440> gets<00:05:41.650> it<00:05:41.770> you<00:05:41.800> know

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:42.330 
tight 95 gets lucky and gets it you know

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:44.610 
tight 95 gets lucky and gets it you know
hipfire<00:05:43.330> burst<00:05:43.630> and<00:05:43.840> kills<00:05:44.020> them<00:05:44.110> but<00:05:44.349> I<00:05:44.380> think

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:44.620 
hipfire burst and kills them but I think

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:46.620 
hipfire burst and kills them but I think
eighty<00:05:44.740> percent<00:05:44.950> of<00:05:45.160> a<00:05:45.280> ton<00:05:45.460> of<00:05:45.490> the<00:05:45.820> time<00:05:46.030> an

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:46.630 
eighty percent of a ton of the time an

00:05:46.630 --> 00:05:49.440 
eighty percent of a ton of the time an
SMG<00:05:46.990> is<00:05:47.229> going<00:05:47.560> to<00:05:47.680> beat<00:05:47.889> the<00:05:48.400> tight<00:05:48.580> 95<00:05:48.760> within

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:49.450 
SMG is going to beat the tight 95 within

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:51.150 
SMG is going to beat the tight 95 within
range<00:05:49.690> like<00:05:49.960> it<00:05:50.110> just<00:05:50.470> fires<00:05:50.650> much<00:05:50.919> quicker

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:51.160 
range like it just fires much quicker

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.940 
range like it just fires much quicker
and<00:05:51.310> does<00:05:51.490> a<00:05:51.520> lot<00:05:51.729> more<00:05:51.910> damage<00:05:52.560> it<00:05:53.560> just<00:05:53.800> has

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:53.950 
and does a lot more damage it just has

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:55.080 
and does a lot more damage it just has
the<00:05:54.099> advantage<00:05:54.520> I<00:05:54.610> think<00:05:54.820> that<00:05:54.970> the

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:55.090 
the advantage I think that the

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:57.150 
the advantage I think that the
occasional<00:05:55.599> times<00:05:55.810> that<00:05:55.990> the<00:05:56.289> tight<00:05:56.470> 95<00:05:56.650> does

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:57.160 
occasional times that the tight 95 does

00:05:57.160 --> 00:05:59.490 
occasional times that the tight 95 does
succeed<00:05:57.610> is<00:05:57.910> just<00:05:58.150> you<00:05:58.330> know<00:05:58.449> variance<00:05:59.229> that's

00:05:59.490 --> 00:05:59.500 
succeed is just you know variance that's

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:01.050 
succeed is just you know variance that's
just<00:05:59.710> how<00:05:59.919> the<00:05:59.979> game<00:06:00.310> is<00:06:00.460> played<00:06:00.490> I<00:06:00.729> mean

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:01.060 
just how the game is played I mean

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:03.510 
just how the game is played I mean
steady<00:06:01.720> aim<00:06:01.900> itself<00:06:02.349> is<00:06:02.500> a<00:06:02.530> luck<00:06:02.889> based<00:06:03.190> perk

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:03.520 
steady aim itself is a luck based perk

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:05.370 
steady aim itself is a luck based perk
it<00:06:03.789> changes<00:06:04.300> the<00:06:04.419> way<00:06:04.570> your<00:06:04.780> spread<00:06:05.080> as<00:06:05.229> and

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:05.380 
it changes the way your spread as and

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:06.810 
it changes the way your spread as and
your<00:06:05.470> spread<00:06:05.740> is<00:06:05.860> completely<00:06:06.310> completely

your spread is completely completely

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:09.450 
your spread is completely completely
random<00:06:07.330> so<00:06:07.840> it's<00:06:08.139> going<00:06:08.320> to<00:06:08.380> be<00:06:08.440> you<00:06:08.800> know<00:06:08.889> it's

going<00:06:09.610> to<00:06:09.669> be<00:06:09.760> pretty<00:06:09.880> obvious<00:06:10.120> that<00:06:10.510> it's

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:10.630 
going to be pretty obvious that it's

all balanced I guess you could say so
honestly<00:06:47.170> I<00:06:47.230> think<00:06:47.350> this<00:06:47.590> is<00:06:47.740> probably<00:06:48.040> by

gun<00:07:40.750> in<00:07:40.870> the<00:07:40.960> game<00:07:41.110> and<00:07:41.320> what<00:07:41.500> I<00:07:41.530> think<00:07:41.770> is<00:07:41.860> the

00:07:41.940 --> 00:07:41.950 
gun in the game and what I think is the

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:43.740 
gun in the game and what I think is the
best<00:07:42.100> SMG<00:07:42.490> in<00:07:42.700> the<00:07:42.790> game<00:07:42.970> they<00:07:43.270> might<00:07:43.450> surprise
