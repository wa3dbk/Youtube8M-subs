00:00:03.839 --> 00:00:07.689
 Hello everyone welcome to ixtem motorcycle 

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:11.650
 for the video presentation of the headphones 

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:13.690
 hot and gt r so this headset is a 

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:14.110
 2013 news from the manufacturer 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:17.020
 Japanese 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:19.240
 so it's a road crash helmet 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.850
 rather upscale and big 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:24.070
 novelties you can see here it's 

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:25.420
 we finally had a double sunscreen 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:26.830
 on a warm full face helmet and so 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.810
 for all the fans of the brand it was 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:30.850
 something that was very much expected 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:32.430
 finally arrives for those also who 

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:34.660
 know a little bit about the brand 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:39.640
 it's a product that's going to be a little 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:41.260
 a little condensed neotec 2 x spirit and 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.640
 2x feels so it's really a beautiful 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.380
 product that brings together a little bit of everything 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.420
 what I want is to do well and 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.550
 especially here we are really happy finally 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.760
 they made us the little double screen 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.989
 solar then apart from this novelty it 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.010
 there are lots of cool little things on it 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:57.640
 what are we going to the details and 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:59.050
 together right now so at the level 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.130
 of this headset so we will start with 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:01.450
 the screen since it's still there 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:03.670
 that they go to the main novelty 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:05.199
 so already at the screen level so 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.020
 it's a screen that comes with a 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:12.130
 pinlock lens we have here a little ergo 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:14.380
 lock that's here hop there you 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:17.049
 have a quick disassembly system without 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.430
 tools you can do his 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:20.740
 experience very quickly since you 

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.440
 will need to disassemble to mount the 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.760
 pin-up lens that provides with on to the 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.770
 famous sunscreen control that 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.120
 is here so left side that's good 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.260
 these practices to use is true that the 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.890
 race is very short so it's 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:35.049
 really easy to use while driving 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.580
 that's at the visor level 

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:38.290
 of the hull so we are on a hull in 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:39.040
 very light fiber so there this model 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.409
 it's a size m 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.970
 it's 1500 g exactly with the 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:44.320
 pinlock lens goes up so have to count 

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.850
 more or less 50 grams depending on whether you 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.960
 have the cap bigger or bigger 

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:52.409
 little we have 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.900
 so yes 3 3 sizes of cap you 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.159
 see that she was well worked in 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.659
 blower this cap we find this 

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:59.010
 who gives him a little side a little bit 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.630
 sports a little spoiler that is 

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:03.180
 integrated in the shape of the shell so 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:06.300
 that's nice for well stabilized the 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.440
 high-speed headphones at the 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.729
 breakdowns so we'll do it in 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.739
 the opposite way we have a small 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.640
 rear extractors here that's up that's getting 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:14.790
 order like that we can even do it 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.709
 but the rear extractor we have on the 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.330
 front of the front air intake such 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:18.750
 that can be opened or closed there are two 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.540
 positions 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:24.060
 and then classically at the level of the 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.510
 chin rest here for the outside 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.930
 breakage 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.220
 then at the level of the interior then 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.450
 what you see right now is 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:32.160
 that this is a case which is very very 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.390
 enveloping we see that it is well closed 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.540
 here we have a good mother and a good 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:38.220
 bibs the safex and a helmet that goes 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.830
 to be very good at sounding you are 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.780
 well well insulated at the neck you 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.709
 see also we have a small 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:49.110
 micrometric loop 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:51.060
 here and then as usual we 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.040
 found the quality of the mousseaux and 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.780
 it is well I know it comfort and 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.459
 when is positioned on the head we have 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:58.110
 really good a good support 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.060
 the head has come from everywhere without 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:04.980
 excessive pressure it's show it's 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:07.680
