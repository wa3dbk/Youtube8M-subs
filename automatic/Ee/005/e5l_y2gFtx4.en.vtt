00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
that big just half in we don't want this

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.660 
that big just half in we don't want this
really<00:01:43.140> means<00:01:43.619> to<00:01:43.740> do<00:01:43.920> pay<00:01:44.220> suppose<00:01:44.549> it'd<00:01:44.640> be

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
really means to do pay suppose it'd be

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.639 
really means to do pay suppose it'd be
like<00:01:44.850> sawdust<00:01:45.450> and<00:01:45.689> this<00:01:46.020> machine<00:01:46.350> is<00:01:46.470> capable

like sawdust and this machine is capable

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.010 
like sawdust and this machine is capable
of<00:01:46.950> doing<00:01:47.220> that<00:01:47.369> and<00:01:47.579> that's<00:01:47.790> not<00:01:48.000> ideal<00:01:48.149> okay

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
of doing that and that's not ideal okay

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.230 
of doing that and that's not ideal okay
have<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.259> speed<00:01:49.560> 510<00:01:50.280> seconds<00:01:50.729> this<00:01:50.880> is<00:01:51.060> what

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
have to speed 510 seconds this is what

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.700 
have to speed 510 seconds this is what
you<00:01:51.390> should<00:01:51.450> have<00:01:51.659> you've<00:01:52.170> got<00:01:52.320> some<00:01:52.500> bigger

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
you should have you've got some bigger

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.350 
you should have you've got some bigger
chunks<00:01:53.100> in<00:01:53.220> there<00:01:53.369> and<00:01:53.640> you<00:01:53.729> got<00:01:53.880> some<00:01:54.060> paste

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
chunks in there and you got some paste

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.940 
chunks in there and you got some paste
in<00:01:54.600> there<00:01:54.750> that<00:01:54.930> will<00:01:55.020> help<00:01:55.200> it<00:01:55.350> all<00:01:55.530> to<00:01:55.710> bind

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
in there that will help it all to bind

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.830 
in there that will help it all to bind
together<00:01:56.250> put<00:01:56.790> that<00:01:56.939> into<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.329> bowl<00:01:57.540> as<00:01:57.810> well
