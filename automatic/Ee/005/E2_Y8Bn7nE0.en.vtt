look like you have brows all you need to
do<00:00:57.030> are<00:00:57.329> short<00:00:57.750> shot<00:00:58.289> lines<00:00:58.559> that<00:00:58.829> resemble

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
do are short shot lines that resemble

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.490 
do are short shot lines that resemble
hairs<00:00:59.550> and<00:00:59.850> just<00:01:00.510> follow<00:01:00.780> the<00:01:00.989> shape<00:01:01.230> of<00:01:01.440> your

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.170 
hairs and just follow the shape of your
natural<00:01:02.129> brow<00:01:03.199> as<00:01:04.199> spoolie<00:01:04.860> is<00:01:05.070> great<00:01:05.700> to<00:01:05.970> just

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
natural brow as spoolie is great to just

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.170 
natural brow as spoolie is great to just
blend<00:01:06.930> that<00:01:07.110> all<00:01:07.380> out<00:01:07.470> brush<00:01:08.310> any<00:01:08.610> hairs<00:01:08.970> that

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
blend that all out brush any hairs that

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.600 
blend that all out brush any hairs that
are<00:01:09.240> bit<00:01:09.540> out<00:01:09.810> of<00:01:09.840> place<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:10.680> just<00:01:10.740> smooth<00:01:11.490> it

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
are bit out of place and just smooth it

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.230 
are bit out of place and just smooth it
all<00:01:11.790> down

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.080 

so<00:01:14.930> the<00:01:15.080> next<00:01:15.290> step<00:01:15.500> is<00:01:15.650> basically<00:01:16.090> imperative

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:17.090 
so the next step is basically imperative

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:18.940 
so the next step is basically imperative
if<00:01:17.330> you've<00:01:17.540> not<00:01:17.720> been<00:01:17.930> to<00:01:18.110> the<00:01:18.229> selim<00:01:18.650> for<00:01:18.920> a

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950 
if you've not been to the selim for a

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.430 
if you've not been to the selim for a
while<00:01:19.250> and<00:01:19.580> your<00:01:20.450> eyebrows<00:01:20.810> are<00:01:21.080> looking<00:01:21.380> a

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
opinion so I basically just do it with a

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.280 
opinion so I basically just do it with a
concealer<00:01:37.490> probably<00:01:38.090> about<00:01:38.360> you<00:01:38.780> know<00:01:38.899> my

shade<00:01:39.649> or<00:01:39.890> a<00:01:39.950> little<00:01:40.340> bit<00:01:40.490> lighter<00:01:40.729> and<00:01:42.190> I

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.190 
shade or a little bit lighter and I

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.969 
shade or a little bit lighter and I
simply<00:01:43.670> blend<00:01:44.119> it<00:01:44.360> out<00:01:44.540> with<00:01:45.080> my<00:01:45.259> fingers<00:01:45.800> and

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:45.979 
simply blend it out with my fingers and

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:51.820 
simply blend it out with my fingers and
I<00:01:46.250> hope<00:01:46.580> there<00:01:46.940> aren't<00:01:47.179> any<00:01:47.390> harsh<00:01:48.200> lines<00:01:50.830> so
