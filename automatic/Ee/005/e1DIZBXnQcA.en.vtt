00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
thing about this they have like a ridged

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.199

heel<00:02:57.860> which<00:02:58.459> is<00:02:58.610> really<00:02:58.910> really<00:02:59.000> great

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
heel which is really really great

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:02.080 
heel which is really really great
because<00:02:59.720> I<00:03:00.250> find<00:03:01.250> it<00:03:01.400> really<00:03:01.579> hard<00:03:01.730> to<00:03:01.849> find

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:02.090 
because I find it really hard to find

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:03.610 
because I find it really hard to find
shoes<00:03:02.360> that<00:03:02.420> don't<00:03:02.810> wear<00:03:03.019> away<00:03:03.260> at<00:03:03.410> the<00:03:03.470> bottom

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:07.660 
and I think these were like 10 pounds I
