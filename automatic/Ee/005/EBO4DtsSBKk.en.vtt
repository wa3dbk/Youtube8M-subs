now having tested it on having tested

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.260 
now having tested it on having tested
this<00:01:54.060> on<00:01:54.300> Microsoft<00:01:55.729> computers<00:01:56.729> and<00:01:57.060> their

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.570 
windows computers so I'm not sure if
this<00:02:00.119> will<00:02:00.270> work<00:02:00.330> but<00:02:00.780> this<00:02:01.229> would<00:02:01.979> work<00:02:02.160> this

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:02.580 
this will work but this would work this

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:04.940 
this will work but this would work this
will<00:02:02.759> definitely<00:02:02.970> work<00:02:03.270> on<00:02:03.720> Mac<00:02:04.170> users<00:02:04.650> for

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950
