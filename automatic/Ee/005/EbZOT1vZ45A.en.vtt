00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
 consuming too much salt is bad for the 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.980
 health must be used moderately in the 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.650
 a strategy to reduce the use of 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.840
 is to make a jump seasoned with herbs 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:15.179
 in addition to being healthier to mix and 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.100
 combination of flavors makes the food 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.960
 more pleasant 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.400
 now you will see how the 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.400
 seasoned jump to the barbecue 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.980
 cooking is a great pleasure to make 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.439
 this moment is even more pleasant 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.719
 we are going to prepare a salt today that can 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.640
 be used for red meats 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:37.890
 barbecues and season it with several 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.800
 plants that we can grow 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:44.160
 Our house imagines that it is delicious to cultivate. 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.320
 in your garden or in vases the herbs 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.760
 that we will use to prepare 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.050
 dishes with those people that we 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.420
 so much like 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:52.230
 around our table to prepare 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.410
 this salt 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:58.530
 We are going to use marjoram is a 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:59.820
 very easy to cultivate there and that 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.930
 It fits very well with meats. 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.300
 reds 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.850
 we will also use thyme one 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.479
 similar plant but will help to give 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.740
 more emphasis on the flavor of marjoram and 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:14.189
 own sado 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:17.130
 let's use parsley and chives 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:19.439
 onion and garlic that are like the jokers 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.380
 of our seasoning they will give body and 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.259
 further enhance the taste of this 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.810
 little sauce that we'll prepare now 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:29.159
 and then to finalize we'll put 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.890
 a little pepper to give that 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.110
 special touch and add the salt 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.409
 all these plants we have to have 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:39.689
 a good care in the free cultivation of 

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:41.790
 agrochemicals of polluting agents of 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.270
 contact with small animals that may 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.920
 contaminate our little plants 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.799
 bringing them inside the house later 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.840
 to always choose fill out 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:54.240

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.759
 then goes there in drinking water taking 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.759
 all care taking away spoiled leaves 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.619
 taking care not to come to the insect or 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.229
 anything that comes by the garden 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:07.259
 that we do not want our salt in the 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:09.899
 our dish then prepare these plants 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:12.810
 It's very easy we will be for all 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:15.630
 and in quantities where 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:18.060
 stronger plants such as marjoram and 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.020
 thyme we will vote in quantity 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:22.080
 smaller 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:25.230
 other similar charges 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:27.630
 let's cut about three to four 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.940
 tablespoons of each of these 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:32.580
 plants pranks and that Pepper 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.680
 It will whistled just giving okay 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:37.980
 we'll add the 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:40.860
 salt this salt can be the coarse salt to 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:44.760
 barbecue or fine salt to use in 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:46.860
 prepared for the oven or in sauces 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.850
 pan and other options that you 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.209
 to prefer 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:53.250
 giving everything is ready just mix and 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:55.680
 put in pots and wait at least 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:58.349
 one week before consuming to give 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.900
 flavor time to harmonize this 

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:01.799
 salt has many advantages over 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.650
 bought 

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:07.170
 first of all to taste nÃ© todo plant 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.640
 newly grown fresh harvested has a 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.580
 much better flavor 

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:14.190
 besides being free of preservatives 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:17.519
 free from other dyes and materials 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.989
 than in seasonings purchased 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:20.940
 will be there present 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:23.670
 so we will have a salt 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:26.280
 prepared by you and that we can 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.810
 use in multiple dishes suiting it 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.760
 is what we can cultivate and the 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.160
 So, our preferences are good here. 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.440

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.410
 It was really cool and you can prepare the 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.640
 barbecue also roasted meats and 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.280
 we just have to be careful 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.769
 because as we use fresh herbs and 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.230
 saves getting a little damp concentrate 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:48.660
 do not use a slightly smaller amount 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:51.000
 there is also the option of doing 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:53.790
 dried herbs dehydrated 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.150
 our salt is ready, good appetite 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.150
 all
