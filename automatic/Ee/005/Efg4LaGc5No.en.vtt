essentially what it allows it to do is

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.730 
essentially what it allows it to do is
have<00:01:20.460> like<00:01:20.759> a<00:01:20.880> built-in<00:01:21.210> built-in<00:01:21.840> drivers

obviously<00:01:33.420> worked<00:01:33.659> on<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.110> jacks<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:34.710> they

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
obviously worked on the jacks and they

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.100 
obviously worked on the jacks and they
totally<00:01:35.430> rely<00:01:35.670> on<00:01:35.700> a<00:01:36.000> sound<00:01:36.450> card<00:01:36.689> within<00:01:37.049> the

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
totally rely on a sound card within the

totally rely on a sound card within the
PC<00:01:37.530> or<00:01:38.070> if<00:01:38.100> I'm<00:01:38.400> see<00:01:38.700> from<00:01:38.880> my<00:01:38.970> mobile<00:01:39.119> then<00:01:39.329> you

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
PC or if I'm see from my mobile then you

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.940 
PC or if I'm see from my mobile then you
get<00:01:39.659> those<00:01:39.810> sound<00:01:40.110> card<00:01:40.380> or<00:01:40.500> drivers

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
get those sound card or drivers

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.830 
get those sound card or drivers
whatsoever<00:01:41.430> so<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.790> sound<00:01:42.030> is<00:01:42.210> very<00:01:42.360> kind<00:01:42.720> of

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
whatsoever so the sound is very kind of

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.870 
whatsoever so the sound is very kind of
average<00:01:43.619> but<00:01:43.860> we're<00:01:44.009> obviously<00:01:44.189> it's<00:01:44.520> USB

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
average but we're obviously it's USB

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.240 
average but we're obviously it's USB
head<00:01:45.149> so<00:01:45.360> you<00:01:45.420> do<00:01:45.720> have<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.049> option<00:01:46.439> of<00:01:46.590> that

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
head so you do have the option of that

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.889

amplify the audio and obviously make it

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.149 
amplify the audio and obviously make it
higher<00:01:51.000> quality<00:01:51.540> the<00:01:52.079> actual<00:01:52.439> ear<00:01:52.649> cups<00:01:52.950> have

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:45.060 
actually change the pulsation of the

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:46.670 
actually change the pulsation of the
lights<00:02:45.299> whether<00:02:45.629> that<00:02:45.840> be<00:02:46.019> like<00:02:46.230> a<00:02:46.319> solid

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
light a fast flashing light but then you

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.289 
light a fast flashing light but then you
can<00:02:49.650> also<00:02:49.799> set<00:02:50.220> it<00:02:50.250> to<00:02:50.549> when<00:02:50.700> you<00:02:50.819> actually<00:02:51.150> if

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
can also set it to when you actually if

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:53.659 
can also set it to when you actually if
you're<00:02:51.450> playing<00:02:51.659> like<00:02:51.840> an<00:02:51.959> FPS<00:02:52.319> game<00:02:52.349> or<00:02:52.859> any

there's a trigger button on the keyboard
on<00:02:57.900> the<00:02:58.019> mouse<00:02:58.200> or<00:02:58.530> on<00:02:59.250> the<00:03:00.319> like<00:03:01.319> any<00:03:01.500> kind<00:03:01.739> of

can set it to that so basically it can
they<00:03:06.389> can<00:03:06.599> flash<00:03:06.900> or<00:03:07.439> pulsate<00:03:08.159> every<00:03:08.459> time

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:08.669 
they can flash or pulsate every time

00:03:08.669 --> 00:03:10.369 
they can flash or pulsate every time
that<00:03:08.849> your<00:03:09.060> triggers<00:03:09.419> press<00:03:09.719> which<00:03:10.019> is<00:03:10.169> really

that in a minute
and<00:03:13.500> the<00:03:13.889> actual<00:03:14.159> hits<00:03:14.400> is<00:03:14.639> very<00:03:14.849> very

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
and the actual hits is very very

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:16.789 
and the actual hits is very very
comfortable<00:03:15.269> it's<00:03:15.629> also<00:03:15.719> very<00:03:15.989> light<00:03:16.290> but<00:03:16.620> my

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
comfortable it's also very light but my

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:19.309 
comfortable it's also very light but my
downsides<00:03:17.400> of<00:03:17.549> the<00:03:17.609> headset<00:03:18.060> is<00:03:18.359> that<00:03:19.139> it's<00:03:19.260> a

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319 
downsides of the headset is that it's a

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:20.809 
downsides of the headset is that it's a
little<00:03:19.590> bit<00:03:19.680> loose<00:03:19.979> on<00:03:20.190> your<00:03:20.370> head<00:03:20.489> it<00:03:20.609> doesn't

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:20.819 
little bit loose on your head it doesn't

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:22.219 
little bit loose on your head it doesn't
seem<00:03:21.030> to<00:03:21.150> want<00:03:21.299> to<00:03:21.389> grip<00:03:21.629> you<00:03:21.810> and<00:03:21.959> it<00:03:22.049> doesn't

00:03:22.219 --> 00:03:22.229 
seem to want to grip you and it doesn't

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:24.740 
seem to want to grip you and it doesn't
seem<00:03:22.440> to<00:03:22.560> want<00:03:22.680> to<00:03:22.709> immerse<00:03:23.069> you<00:03:23.430> in<00:03:23.790> in<00:03:24.690> the

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
seem to want to immerse you in in the

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.170 
seem to want to immerse you in in the
game<00:03:25.079> it's<00:03:25.709> kind<00:03:26.010> of<00:03:26.220> just<00:03:26.579> a<00:03:26.729> little<00:03:26.970> bit<00:03:27.090> on

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
game it's kind of just a little bit on

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.759 
game it's kind of just a little bit on
the<00:03:27.329> loose<00:03:27.479> side<00:03:27.780> and<00:03:28.079> that<00:03:28.199> is<00:03:28.319> really<00:03:28.650> my

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
the loose side and that is really my

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:31.250 
the loose side and that is really my
point<00:03:29.280> of<00:03:29.549> this<00:03:30.150> headset<00:03:30.599> that<00:03:30.629> i<00:03:30.840> think<00:03:30.959> could

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
point of this headset that i think could

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.800 
point of this headset that i think could
ever<00:03:31.409> be<00:03:31.680> improved<00:03:32.099> in<00:03:32.340> future<00:03:32.370> models<00:03:33.120> of<00:03:33.329> the

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
ever be improved in future models of the

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.210 
ever be improved in future models of the
siberia<00:03:34.349> but<00:03:34.470> i'll<00:03:34.560> talk<00:03:34.739> a<00:03:34.769> little<00:03:35.010> bit<00:03:35.189> about

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
siberia but i'll talk a little bit about

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.449 
siberia but i'll talk a little bit about
that<00:03:35.519> in<00:03:36.049> in<00:03:37.049> more<00:03:37.470> obviously<00:03:37.829> later<00:03:38.159> on<00:03:38.340> in

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
that in in more obviously later on in

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.550 
that in in more obviously later on in
the<00:03:38.549> video<00:03:38.750> yeah<00:03:39.750> because<00:03:40.109> it's<00:03:40.319> obviously

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 
the video yeah because it's obviously

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:42.469 
the video yeah because it's obviously
got<00:03:40.650> a<00:03:40.709> built-in<00:03:41.040> sound<00:03:41.310> card<00:03:41.669> and<00:03:41.849> drivers

00:03:42.469 --> 00:03:42.479 
got a built-in sound card and drivers

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:44.749 
got a built-in sound card and drivers
the<00:03:43.229> microphone<00:03:43.590> also<00:03:43.829> has<00:03:44.129> built-in<00:03:44.519> noise

00:03:44.749 --> 00:03:44.759 
the microphone also has built-in noise

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:47.569 
the microphone also has built-in noise
cancellation<00:03:45.629> so<00:03:46.349> it<00:03:46.680> allows<00:03:46.979> you<00:03:47.189> obviously

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:47.579 
cancellation so it allows you obviously

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:48.530 
cancellation so it allows you obviously
that<00:03:47.729> you<00:03:47.790> don't<00:03:47.970> have<00:03:48.150> to<00:03:48.239> go<00:03:48.329> and<00:03:48.419> play

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
that you don't have to go and play

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:49.789 
that you don't have to go and play
around<00:03:48.629> with<00:03:49.019> any<00:03:49.139> settings<00:03:49.620> it<00:03:49.769> will

00:03:49.789 --> 00:03:49.799 
around with any settings it will

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:52.339 
around with any settings it will
automatically<00:03:50.430> detect<00:03:51.269> noise<00:03:51.629> and<00:03:52.019> obviously

00:03:52.339 --> 00:03:52.349 
automatically detect noise and obviously

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:54.979 
automatically detect noise and obviously
cut<00:03:52.590> it<00:03:52.709> straight<00:03:52.889> out<00:03:53.069> for<00:03:53.340> you<00:03:53.489> guys<00:03:53.810> you<00:03:54.810> do

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
cut it straight out for you guys you do

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:56.780 
cut it straight out for you guys you do
get<00:03:55.139> a<00:03:55.169> USB<00:03:55.530> extension<00:03:56.069> cable<00:03:56.370> because<00:03:56.699> the

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
get a USB extension cable because the

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.960 
get a USB extension cable because the
actual<00:03:57.060> original<00:03:57.599> cable<00:03:58.109> is<00:03:58.290> only<00:03:59.129> around<00:03:59.549> a

00:03:59.960 --> 00:03:59.970 
actual original cable is only around a

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:02.300 
actual original cable is only around a
meter<00:04:00.180> long<00:04:00.299> you<00:04:00.959> do<00:04:01.139> get<00:04:01.290> an<00:04:01.379> inline<00:04:01.799> control

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
meter long you do get an inline control

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:03.979 
meter long you do get an inline control
as<00:04:02.430> well<00:04:02.579> but<00:04:02.729> it's<00:04:02.849> only<00:04:03.000> to<00:04:03.180> control<00:04:03.449> volume

00:04:03.979 --> 00:04:03.989 
as well but it's only to control volume

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:05.839 
as well but it's only to control volume
and<00:04:04.229> miu<00:04:04.470> there's<00:04:04.680> no<00:04:04.829> like<00:04:05.040> game<00:04:05.310> sound<00:04:05.639> and

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:05.849 
and miu there's no like game sound and

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:08.330 
and miu there's no like game sound and
flute<00:04:06.060> sound<00:04:06.359> to<00:04:06.689> change<00:04:07.229> but<00:04:08.099> you<00:04:08.159> do

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
flute sound to change but you do

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.670 
flute sound to change but you do
obviously<00:04:08.459> get<00:04:08.849> a<00:04:08.879> USB<00:04:09.299> extinct<00:04:10.109> and<00:04:10.319> cable

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
obviously get a USB extinct and cable

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.409 
obviously get a USB extinct and cable
included<00:04:10.829> and<00:04:11.669> this<00:04:11.819> will<00:04:11.970> take<00:04:12.090> the<00:04:12.150> headset

00:04:12.409 --> 00:04:12.419 
included and this will take the headset

included and this will take the headset
cable<00:04:13.049> range<00:04:13.259> to<00:04:13.530> around<00:04:13.709> 2.5<00:04:14.370> meters<00:04:14.879> that<00:04:15.150> is

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:15.269 
cable range to around 2.5 meters that is

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:17.870 
cable range to around 2.5 meters that is
absolutely<00:04:15.689> fine<00:04:16.049> I<00:04:16.709> think<00:04:17.250> the<00:04:17.310> hits<00:04:17.489> app<00:04:17.729> so

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
absolutely fine I think the hits app so

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.879 
absolutely fine I think the hits app so
it<00:04:18.000> looks<00:04:18.209> great<00:04:18.479> I<00:04:18.690> really<00:04:19.349> do<00:04:19.500> like<00:04:19.680> the

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:19.889 
it looks great I really do like the

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:22.069 
it looks great I really do like the
designs<00:04:20.220> as<00:04:20.459> far<00:04:20.669> bit<00:04:20.849> Siberia's<00:04:21.450> but<00:04:21.630> kind<00:04:21.900> of

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:22.079 
designs as far bit Siberia's but kind of

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:23.360 
designs as far bit Siberia's but kind of
where<00:04:22.229> they've<00:04:22.409> gone<00:04:22.590> for<00:04:22.770> like<00:04:22.889> a<00:04:23.039> unique

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370
