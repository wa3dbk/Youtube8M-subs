the Morgan Mill battery tray for the
carbon<00:00:18.270> Z<00:00:18.540> cub<00:00:18.869> we'll<00:00:19.529> talk<00:00:19.740> about<00:00:19.890> how<00:00:20.189> to

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
carbon Z cub we'll talk about how to

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.000 
carbon Z cub we'll talk about how to
install<00:00:20.460> it<00:00:20.790> how<00:00:21.420> it<00:00:21.600> works<00:00:21.840> and<00:00:22.170> why<00:00:22.800> it's

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
install it how it works and why it's

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.320 
install it how it works and why it's
something<00:00:23.220> you<00:00:23.430> should<00:00:23.610> probably<00:00:23.849> get<00:00:24.210> your

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
something you should probably get your

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.550 
something you should probably get your
hands<00:00:24.689> off<00:00:26.180> so<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.450> stock<00:00:27.660> battery<00:00:27.869> mount<00:00:28.320> is

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
hands off so the stock battery mount is

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.190 
hands off so the stock battery mount is
pre-installed<00:00:29.460> at<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.210> carbon<00:00:30.509> syke<00:00:30.900> but

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:31.200 
pre-installed at the carbon syke but

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:34.069 
pre-installed at the carbon syke but
it's<00:00:31.380> held<00:00:31.650> in<00:00:32.009> with<00:00:32.550> a<00:00:32.579> series<00:00:33.150> of<00:00:33.180> screws<00:00:33.720> I

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
it's held in with a series of screws I

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.560 
it's held in with a series of screws I
believe<00:00:34.350> there's<00:00:34.560> six<00:00:34.970> there<00:00:35.970> allen<00:00:36.390> head

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
believe there's six there allen head

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.940 
believe there's six there allen head
screws<00:00:37.020> so<00:00:37.649> you're<00:00:37.829> gonna<00:00:37.980> want<00:00:38.340> to<00:00:38.489> find

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:39.950 
screws so you're gonna want to find

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.229 
screws so you're gonna want to find
whatever<00:00:40.950> you<00:00:41.130> have<00:00:41.370> that<00:00:41.640> will<00:00:41.820> allow<00:00:42.060> you<00:00:42.120> to

take<00:00:42.510> them<00:00:42.690> out<00:00:42.840> I<00:00:42.870> use<00:00:43.199> my<00:00:43.440> MIP

00:00:44.529 --> 00:00:44.539 
take them out I use my MIP

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:48.979 
take them out I use my MIP
allen<00:00:45.539> head<00:00:46.100> driver<00:00:47.100> and<00:00:47.519> remove<00:00:48.449> the<00:00:48.750> plate

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
allen head driver and remove the plate

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.439 
allen head driver and remove the plate
very<00:00:49.019> simple<00:00:49.739> the<00:00:50.460> front<00:00:50.820> two<00:00:51.059> are<00:00:51.329> a<00:00:51.359> little

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
very simple the front two are a little

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.509 
very simple the front two are a little
tricky<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:52.079> get<00:00:52.199> out<00:00:52.379> and<00:00:52.590> get<00:00:52.679> in<00:00:52.890> but<00:00:53.190> I<00:00:53.219> was

00:00:53.509 --> 00:00:53.519 
tricky to get out and get in but I was

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:55.660 
tricky to get out and get in but I was
able<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:53.820> do<00:00:54.030> it<00:00:54.179> without<00:00:54.269> much<00:00:54.629> trouble<00:00:54.929> so

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:55.670 
able to do it without much trouble so

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.000 
able to do it without much trouble so
then<00:00:56.670> when<00:00:56.879> you<00:00:57.089> pull<00:00:57.660> out<00:00:57.690> your<00:00:58.320> stock<00:00:58.679> plate

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
then when you pull out your stock plate

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.950 
then when you pull out your stock plate
it's<00:00:59.280> simply<00:00:59.699> a<00:00:59.730> piece<00:00:59.940> of<00:01:00.120> plastic<00:01:00.629> I<00:01:00.780> would

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
it's simply a piece of plastic I would

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.110 
it's simply a piece of plastic I would
go<00:01:01.109> ahead<00:01:01.469> and<00:01:01.769> remove<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.280> velcro<00:01:02.519> because

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
go ahead and remove the velcro because

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.310 
go ahead and remove the velcro because
you<00:01:03.420> can<00:01:03.600> use<00:01:03.839> that<00:01:04.140> on<00:01:04.350> your<00:01:05.100> Morgan<00:01:05.970> mill

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
you can use that on your Morgan mill

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.470 
you can use that on your Morgan mill
battery<00:01:07.320> tray<00:01:07.740> or<00:01:08.160> cartridge<00:01:08.790> as<00:01:09.030> they<00:01:09.270> call

the holes line up where the plastic tray

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.220 
the holes line up where the plastic tray
holes<00:01:18.360> were<00:01:18.630> simply<00:01:19.620> replace<00:01:20.010> the<00:01:20.040> screws<00:01:20.670> and

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:21.230 
holes were simply replace the screws and

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.930 
holes were simply replace the screws and
you're<00:01:22.230> in<00:01:22.410> business<00:01:22.680> it's<00:01:23.130> very<00:01:23.190> simple<00:01:23.790> it's

you're in business it's very simple it's
very<00:01:23.970> straightforward<00:01:24.420> I<00:01:24.990> started<00:01:25.350> from<00:01:25.440> the

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
very straightforward I started from the

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.230 
very straightforward I started from the
back<00:01:25.830> because<00:01:26.370> they<00:01:26.550> were<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.820> trickiest

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
back because they were the trickiest

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.210 
back because they were the trickiest
ones<00:01:27.570> to<00:01:27.810> get<00:01:27.900> in<00:01:28.140> and<00:01:28.410> move<00:01:28.560> my<00:01:28.740> way<00:01:28.920> forward

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
ones to get in and move my way forward

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.480 
ones to get in and move my way forward
and<00:01:29.850> got<00:01:30.360> it<00:01:30.480> all<00:01:30.600> set<00:01:30.840> up<00:01:30.990> so<00:01:31.920> here<00:01:32.100> it<00:01:32.190> is<00:01:32.310> in

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
and got it all set up so here it is in

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.850 
and got it all set up so here it is in
the<00:01:32.550> plane<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:33.180> you<00:01:33.540> will<00:01:33.570> see<00:01:33.990> some<00:01:34.590> numbers

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
the plane and you will see some numbers

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.620 
the plane and you will see some numbers
you<00:01:35.070> can't<00:01:35.430> see<00:01:35.610> it<00:01:35.700> yet<00:01:35.910> but<00:01:35.970> right<00:01:36.450> in<00:01:36.570> the

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
you can't see it yet but right in the

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.390 
you can't see it yet but right in the
middle<00:01:36.690> or<00:01:36.990> slots<00:01:37.350> these<00:01:37.830> numbers<00:01:38.160> are<00:01:38.310> gonna

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
middle or slots these numbers are gonna

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.530 
middle or slots these numbers are gonna
tell<00:01:38.730> you<00:01:40.040> where<00:01:41.040> you<00:01:41.310> can<00:01:41.340> move<00:01:41.760> your<00:01:42.030> battery

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:45.120 
cartridge for the best CG location I

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:47.210 
cartridge for the best CG location I
have<00:01:45.450> multiple<00:01:45.960> packs<00:01:46.260> I<00:01:46.500> run<00:01:46.710> in<00:01:46.830> this<00:01:46.950> flame

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
have multiple packs I run in this flame

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.010 
have multiple packs I run in this flame
from<00:01:47.580> five<00:01:47.790> thousand<00:01:48.300> to<00:01:48.390> thirty<00:01:48.630> six<00:01:48.870> hundred

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
from five thousand to thirty six hundred

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.860 
from five thousand to thirty six hundred
so<00:01:49.980> the<00:01:50.550> numbers<00:01:50.820> come<00:01:50.970> in<00:01:51.000> handy<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:51.480> let<00:01:51.720> me

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:51.870 
so the numbers come in handy to let me

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.110 
so the numbers come in handy to let me
know<00:01:52.050> where<00:01:52.470> certain<00:01:52.860> packs<00:01:53.160> would<00:01:53.520> go<00:01:53.760> in

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:54.120 
know where certain packs would go in

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.720 
know where certain packs would go in

securely and has slots so it stays on

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.280 
securely and has slots so it stays on
really<00:02:05.640> well<00:02:05.760> and<00:02:05.820> then<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.390> hooks<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:07.080> hooks

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
really well and then the hooks the hooks

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.059 
really well and then the hooks the hooks
are<00:02:07.470> the<00:02:07.560> key<00:02:07.800> the<00:02:08.550> hooks<00:02:08.819> go<00:02:09.149> in<00:02:09.330> these<00:02:09.569> side

00:02:10.059 --> 00:02:10.069 
are the key the hooks go in these side

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:13.309 
are the key the hooks go in these side
cutouts<00:02:11.069> and<00:02:11.540> then<00:02:12.540> there's<00:02:12.870> a<00:02:12.959> locking

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
cutouts and then there's a locking

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.559 
cutouts and then there's a locking
mechanism<00:02:13.530> you<00:02:14.340> just<00:02:14.489> pop<00:02:14.760> it<00:02:14.790> in<00:02:15.060> and<00:02:15.390> then

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
mechanism you just pop it in and then

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.839 
mechanism you just pop it in and then
you<00:02:15.599> lock<00:02:15.900> it<00:02:16.110> down<00:02:16.379> and<00:02:17.250> then<00:02:17.519> once<00:02:17.730> again

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
you lock it down and then once again

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:20.420 
you lock it down and then once again
here<00:02:18.599> are<00:02:18.780> your<00:02:19.050> numbers<00:02:19.530> to<00:02:19.770> tell<00:02:20.040> you<00:02:20.220> which

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
here are your numbers to tell you which

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:22.320 
here are your numbers to tell you which
CG<00:02:21.000> point<00:02:21.240> you<00:02:21.510> want<00:02:21.720> to<00:02:21.840> pick

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
CG point you want to pick

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.720 
CG point you want to pick
so<00:02:23.290> now<00:02:23.440> let's<00:02:23.710> look<00:02:23.800> at<00:02:24.010> putting<00:02:24.310> the<00:02:24.430> battery

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
so now let's look at putting the battery

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.450 
so now let's look at putting the battery
in<00:02:25.000> the<00:02:25.030> tray<00:02:25.510> once<00:02:25.930> again<00:02:26.230> you<00:02:26.380> want<00:02:26.500> to<00:02:26.680> get

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:27.460 
in the tray once again you want to get

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.030 
in the tray once again you want to get
your<00:02:27.700> hooks<00:02:27.940> into<00:02:28.300> the<00:02:28.630> little<00:02:28.960> side<00:02:29.470> cutouts

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
your hooks into the little side cutouts

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.230 
your hooks into the little side cutouts
and<00:02:30.810> lock<00:02:31.810> them<00:02:32.140> in<00:02:32.320> push<00:02:32.590> it<00:02:32.740> back<00:02:32.980> and<00:02:33.370> then

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:34.240 
and lock them in push it back and then

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.510 
and lock them in push it back and then
your<00:02:34.660> front<00:02:35.050> mechanism<00:02:35.710> it's<00:02:36.010> gonna<00:02:36.190> slide

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:36.520 
your front mechanism it's gonna slide

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.880 
your front mechanism it's gonna slide
down<00:02:36.550> it'll<00:02:37.300> be<00:02:37.420> slightly<00:02:37.930> tight<00:02:38.260> that's<00:02:38.620> good

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890
