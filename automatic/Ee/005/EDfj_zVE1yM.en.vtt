so<00:00:41.210> I'm<00:00:42.210> going<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.510> change<00:00:42.750> this<00:00:43.020> because<00:00:43.350> it's

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
so I'm going to change this because it's

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.250 
so I'm going to change this because it's
really<00:00:44.340> irritating<00:00:44.750> ain't<00:00:45.750> that<00:00:45.960> kind<00:00:46.200> of

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
really irritating ain't that kind of

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.560 
really irritating ain't that kind of
thing<00:00:46.469> I<00:00:46.739> want<00:00:47.640> to<00:00:47.700> be<00:00:47.789> in<00:00:47.850> fourth<00:00:48.120> gear<00:00:48.360> I'll

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
thing I want to be in fourth gear I'll

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.790 
thing I want to be in fourth gear I'll
be<00:00:48.690> in<00:00:48.750> fourth<00:00:49.050> gear<00:00:51.199> it<00:00:52.199> was<00:00:52.320> relatively

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
be in fourth gear it was relatively

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.740 
be in fourth gear it was relatively
inexpensive<00:00:53.699> kind<00:00:53.940> of<00:00:54.000> expensive<00:00:54.449> for<00:00:54.600> what

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
inexpensive kind of expensive for what

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.080 
inexpensive kind of expensive for what
you<00:00:54.870> get<00:00:55.050> but<00:00:58.100> anyway<00:00:59.100> looks<00:00:59.430> like<00:00:59.609> just<00:00:59.789> a<00:00:59.879> 10

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
you get but anyway looks like just a 10

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.840 
you get but anyway looks like just a 10
mil<00:01:00.300> wrench<00:01:00.539> and<00:01:00.809> then<00:01:01.199> I<00:01:01.800> don't<00:01:02.699> know<00:01:02.789> if

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
mil wrench and then I don't know if

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.219 
mil wrench and then I don't know if
there's<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.090> pin<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.480> Clippers<00:01:03.780> might<00:01:04.049> be<00:01:04.199> a

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
there's a pin the Clippers might be a

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.480 
there's a pin the Clippers might be a
roll<00:01:04.439> and<00:01:04.710> hold<00:01:04.949> that<00:01:05.040> in<00:01:05.189> too<00:01:06.860> no<00:01:07.860> big<00:01:08.189> deal

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
roll and hold that in too no big deal

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:09.859 
roll and hold that in too no big deal
and<00:01:08.640> then<00:01:08.790> this<00:01:08.939> transmission<00:01:09.479> will<00:01:09.570> be<00:01:09.630> ready

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
and then this transmission will be ready

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.410 
and then this transmission will be ready
to<00:01:10.020> go<00:01:10.170> are<00:01:10.290> just<00:01:10.439> going<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.619> rewire<00:01:11.040> my<00:01:11.420> torque

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
to go are just going to rewire my torque

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.090 
to go are just going to rewire my torque
converter<00:01:13.350> lockup<00:01:14.340> solenoid<00:01:15.240> plug<00:01:16.100> we're

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
converter lockup solenoid plug we're

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.560 
converter lockup solenoid plug we're
going<00:01:17.220> to<00:01:17.369> leave<00:01:17.520> rewire<00:01:17.850> that<00:01:18.090> so<00:01:18.330> I<00:01:18.360> got

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
going to leave rewire that so I got

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.170 
going to leave rewire that so I got
switches<00:01:19.439> and<00:01:19.590> I<00:01:19.680> can<00:01:19.860> tell<00:01:20.250> it<00:01:20.400> what<00:01:20.640> to<00:01:20.820> do

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
switches and I can tell it what to do

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.840 
switches and I can tell it what to do
I<00:01:21.560> can<00:01:22.560> want<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:22.799> locked<00:01:23.040> up<00:01:23.250> or<00:01:23.430> I<00:01:23.460> don't<00:01:23.520> want

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
I can want to locked up or I don't want

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:28.039 
I can want to locked up or I don't want
to<00:01:23.939> locked<00:01:24.119> up<00:01:24.360> that's<00:01:25.049> how<00:01:25.229> it<00:01:25.350> is<00:01:26.930> so<00:01:27.930> it

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
to locked up that's how it is so it

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:29.590 
to locked up that's how it is so it
looks<00:01:28.200> like<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.470> difference<00:01:28.890> is<00:01:29.040> in<00:01:29.220> the

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
looks like the difference is in the

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.170 
looks like the difference is in the
sleeves<00:01:30.600> are<00:01:30.930> a<00:01:30.960> whole<00:01:31.229> lot<00:01:31.259> of<00:01:31.710> up<00:01:32.640> your<00:01:33.000> ass

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
sleeves are a whole lot of up your ass

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.230 
sleeves are a whole lot of up your ass
nothing<00:01:33.869> maybe<00:01:34.200> this<00:01:34.560> maybe<00:01:35.460> this<00:01:35.670> passageway

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
nothing maybe this maybe this passageway

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.050 
nothing maybe this maybe this passageway
right<00:01:36.659> here<00:01:37.700> maybe<00:01:38.700> that's<00:01:38.939> a<00:01:39.030> little

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
right here maybe that's a little

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.730 
right here maybe that's a little
different<00:01:39.390> because<00:01:39.659> it's<00:01:39.930> like<00:01:40.200> all<00:01:40.380> around

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
different because it's like all around

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.499 
different because it's like all around
this<00:01:40.950> one<00:01:41.189> I<00:01:41.220> don't<00:01:41.400> know<00:01:41.610> but<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:41.970> diameters

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
this one I don't know but the diameters

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.630 
this one I don't know but the diameters
look<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.869> same<00:01:43.670> plungers<00:01:44.670> look<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.090> same<00:01:46.640> the

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
look the same plungers look the same the

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.260 
look the same plungers look the same the
old

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
old

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.020 
old
I<00:01:48.299> mean<00:01:49.049> maybe<00:01:49.470> we're<00:01:49.710> paying<00:01:49.950> $50<00:01:50.700> for<00:01:51.000> a

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
I mean maybe we're paying $50 for a

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:57.190 
I mean maybe we're paying $50 for a
spring<00:01:51.450> that's<00:01:54.619> 3/16<00:01:55.619> of<00:01:55.710> an<00:01:55.829> inch<00:01:55.979> longer<00:01:56.399> I

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
spring that's 3/16 of an inch longer I

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.569 
spring that's 3/16 of an inch longer I
don't<00:01:58.200> know<00:01:58.350> but<00:01:58.560> it's<00:01:58.710> going<00:01:58.920> in<00:01:59.130> and<00:01:59.340> I'm

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
don't know but it's going in and I'm

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.060 
don't know but it's going in and I'm
happy<00:01:59.969> about<00:02:00.000> it<00:02:00.299> I<00:02:00.570> will<00:02:01.350> be<00:02:01.469> very<00:02:01.710> happy<00:02:02.040> I

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
happy about it I will be very happy I

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.830 
happy about it I will be very happy I
will<00:02:02.250> buy<00:02:02.549> another<00:02:02.850> one<00:02:03.030> from<00:02:03.270> my<00:02:03.329> backup

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
will buy another one from my backup

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.630 
will buy another one from my backup
