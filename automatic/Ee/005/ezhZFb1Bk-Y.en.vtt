 process of food production is 

00:00:55.979 --> 00:00:59.339
 sustainable 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.589
 in the space the students of all the series 

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:04.649
 put into practice the concepts 

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:07.440
 learned in the classroom and it takes 

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:08.429
 taking into account social and environmental 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.250
 economic 

00:01:08.429 --> 00:01:14.610
 the sustainable garden project has as 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.530
 objective of sustainability actions since 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.830
 the preparation of the beds until the 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.119
 preparation of these foods in the kitchen 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:24.179
 schoolyard composting 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.429
 start all the stages of our project 

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:28.770
 from composting we will get 

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:32.039
 This best quality to the earth catches 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.959
 all these seedlings from the cement factory and 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:39.000
 do the planting now I'll have the 

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:41.489
 care with the garden watering and cleaning 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.840
 they receive the guidelines of the techniques 

00:01:41.489 --> 00:01:45.450
 for harvesting 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.129
 I'll take you to the 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.800
 interdisciplinary work 

00:01:47.129 --> 00:01:52.050
 teachers began to develop 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:54.899
 diversified activities with the aim of 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:57.300
 to promote student reflection and a 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:00.959
 participation as volunteers 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:03.569
 Portuguese where we do newsrooms 

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:05.110
 about what we experienced in the garden 

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:07.450
 on the day we went 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:10.360
 in the discipline of geography we only 1 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.220
 on the ground the stones and also the river already 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.650
 in mathematics discipline 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.700
 we learned how to calculate the footage of 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.010
 flower beds 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.920
 practice was so incorporated that many 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.540
 young people took the idea of 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.610
 sustainable development for their home 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.250
 we can take this home making 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.710
 routes the house consume what we 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.740
 we design ourselves as well as being 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:35.410
 socially just and environmentally 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:37.300
 correct is economically viable because 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.180
 contributes to the formation of individuals 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:42.430
 aware of this cause damage observe the 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.800
 students' behavior change them 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.410
 have been able to understand the importance 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.810
 volunteer and make a difference in 

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:52.480
 make the world better 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:55.330
 today we can say that the sartori we have 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:57.100
 true citizens are seeking to do 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.150
 the difference for the construction of a 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.000
 better world 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.320
 It's better that we can only perform 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.330
 work for our good and not 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:08.050
 We receive anything in return for the one 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:10.360
 we received the victory of seeing everyone 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:13.739
 feeding with the duty that 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:13.739
 we always use always
