which I'm focusing in on now is our

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.850 
which I'm focusing in on now is our
overflow<00:00:35.579> now<00:00:35.880> that<00:00:36.030> should<00:00:36.210> always<00:00:36.450> be<00:00:36.860> run

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
overflow now that should always be run

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.160 
overflow now that should always be run
downwards<00:00:38.730> now<00:00:39.390> normally<00:00:39.750> if<00:00:39.809> we<00:00:39.870> were<00:00:39.989> doing

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
downwards now normally if we were doing

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.720 
downwards now normally if we were doing
the<00:00:40.290> installation<00:00:40.559> we'd<00:00:40.980> run<00:00:41.129> that<00:00:41.250> downwards

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
the installation we'd run that downwards

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.049 
the installation we'd run that downwards
and<00:00:41.940> through<00:00:42.780> an<00:00:43.079> outside<00:00:43.320> wall<00:00:43.969> then<00:00:44.969> the

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
and through an outside wall then the

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.490 
and through an outside wall then the
number<00:00:45.270> of<00:00:45.329> times<00:00:45.480> we<00:00:45.600> go<00:00:45.719> to<00:00:45.750> installations

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
number of times we go to installations

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.360 
number of times we go to installations
that<00:00:46.680> have<00:00:46.739> been<00:00:47.010> done<00:00:47.219> by<00:00:48.059> supposedly

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
that have been done by supposedly

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.709 
that have been done by supposedly
reputable<00:00:50.370> water<00:00:50.879> software<00:00:51.270> installed<00:00:51.600> and

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
reputable water software installed and

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.319 
reputable water software installed and
even<00:00:51.989> plumbers<00:00:52.350> and<00:00:52.710> we<00:00:53.190> see<00:00:53.430> this<00:00:53.640> elbow

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
even plumbers and we see this elbow

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.750 
even plumbers and we see this elbow
facing<00:00:54.989> upwards<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:56.309> pipe<00:00:56.520> going

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
facing upwards and the pipe going

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.700 
facing upwards and the pipe going
upwards<00:00:57.210> and<00:00:57.449> you've<00:00:57.840> got<00:00:57.960> water<00:00:58.140> them<00:00:58.410> trying

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
upwards and you've got water them trying

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.310 
upwards and you've got water them trying
to<00:00:58.859> run<00:00:59.010> under<00:00:59.280> gravity<00:00:59.579> uphill<00:01:00.539> it<00:01:00.960> just

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
to run under gravity uphill it just

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.110 
to run under gravity uphill it just
doesn't<00:01:01.559> happen

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:02.120 
doesn't happen

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.609 
doesn't happen
so<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:03.690> situation<00:01:03.899> we<00:01:04.170> have<00:01:04.260> in<00:01:04.350> the<00:01:04.409> shop

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
so the situation we have in the shop

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.969 
so the situation we have in the shop
here<00:01:04.860> which<00:01:05.040> is<00:01:05.220> our<00:01:05.400> kitchen<00:01:05.820> shop<00:01:06.270> is<00:01:06.979> one

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
here which is our kitchen shop is one

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.800 
here which is our kitchen shop is one
where<00:01:08.250> we<00:01:08.280> have<00:01:08.490> no<00:01:08.820> outside<00:01:09.210> wall<00:01:09.479> so<00:01:09.720> the

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
where we have no outside wall so the

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.240 
where we have no outside wall so the
green<00:01:10.020> wall<00:01:10.200> behind<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.619> softener<00:01:11.010> you<00:01:11.100> can

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
green wall behind the softener you can

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.340 
green wall behind the softener you can
see<00:01:11.460> it's<00:01:12.150> actually<00:01:12.270> not<00:01:12.630> an<00:01:12.750> outside<00:01:13.110> wall

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
see it's actually not an outside wall

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.649 
see it's actually not an outside wall
that<00:01:14.130> goes<00:01:14.340> through<00:01:14.670> to<00:01:14.880> the<00:01:15.060> Chinese

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659

your way through or to get to the food

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.630 
your way through or to get to the food
we<00:01:21.900> can't<00:01:22.650> actually<00:01:22.830> run<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.280> overflow

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
we can't actually run the overflow

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.359 
we can't actually run the overflow
through<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:24.000> wall<00:01:24.180> so<00:01:25.110> what<00:01:25.259> we<00:01:25.380> use<00:01:25.650> is<00:01:26.009> this

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
through the wall so what we use is this

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.210 
through the wall so what we use is this
little<00:01:26.759> receiver<00:01:27.570> device<00:01:28.560> here<00:01:28.890> this<00:01:29.040> is<00:01:29.189> a

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
little receiver device here this is a

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.840 
little receiver device here this is a
pump<00:01:30.030> with<00:01:30.329> a<00:01:30.360> float<00:01:31.079> controller<00:01:31.320> in<00:01:32.310> it<00:01:32.460> so<00:01:32.700> if

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
pump with a float controller in it so if

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.060 
pump with a float controller in it so if
the<00:01:33.150> system<00:01:33.450> were<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:33.780> overflow<00:01:34.350> at<00:01:34.530> any<00:01:34.829> point

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
the system were to overflow at any point

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.620 
the system were to overflow at any point
and<00:01:35.250> please<00:01:35.430> remember<00:01:35.640> this<00:01:35.850> is<00:01:36.030> only<00:01:36.180> in<00:01:36.420> an

and please remember this is only in an
emergency<00:01:37.490> this<00:01:38.490> the<00:01:39.210> water<00:01:39.420> flows<00:01:40.380> through

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
emergency this the water flows through

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.370 
emergency this the water flows through
the<00:01:41.040> elbow<00:01:41.280> into<00:01:41.670> this<00:01:42.030> receiver<00:01:42.810> and<00:01:43.079> then

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
the elbow into this receiver and then

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:44.870 
the elbow into this receiver and then
when<00:01:43.500> it<00:01:43.590> gets<00:01:43.860> to<00:01:44.100> a<00:01:44.159> certain<00:01:44.189> level<00:01:44.610> the

when it gets to a certain level the

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.060 
when it gets to a certain level the
float<00:01:45.270> kicks<00:01:45.540> in<00:01:45.750> and<00:01:45.960> then<00:01:46.470> through<00:01:46.829> this

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
float kicks in and then through this

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.770 
float kicks in and then through this
white<00:01:47.399> pipe<00:01:47.700> here<00:01:47.970> which<00:01:48.180> you<00:01:48.270> can<00:01:48.390> see<00:01:48.570> going

from the softener this comes out of

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.170 
from the softener this comes out of
mains<00:01:58.649> pressure<00:01:58.979> so<00:01:59.219> it<00:01:59.280> can<00:01:59.460> go<00:01:59.610> up<00:01:59.759> and<00:01:59.880> over

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180

mains pressure so it can go up and over
because<00:02:00.299> you've<00:02:00.659> got<00:02:00.810> plenty<00:02:01.439> of<00:02:01.680> pressure

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920
