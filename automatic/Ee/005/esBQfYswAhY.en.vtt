00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
stories a while back ago that if they

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.450 
stories a while back ago that if they
had<00:00:24.930> time<00:00:25.260> that<00:00:25.560> they<00:00:25.650> were<00:00:25.710> going<00:00:25.949> to<00:00:26.160> try<00:00:26.430> to

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:26.460 
had time that they were going to try to

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.240 
had time that they were going to try to
implement<00:00:26.910> some<00:00:27.269> Kinect<00:00:28.019> features<00:00:28.410> now<00:00:28.920> I

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
implement some Kinect features now I

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.420 
implement some Kinect features now I
have<00:00:29.550> reached<00:00:29.939> out<00:00:30.179> to<00:00:30.539> EA<00:00:31.199> to<00:00:31.380> try<00:00:31.800> to<00:00:31.859> see<00:00:32.130> if

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
have reached out to EA to try to see if

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.180 
have reached out to EA to try to see if
this<00:00:32.880> would<00:00:33.090> be<00:00:33.239> also<00:00:33.510> on<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.590> PlayStation<00:00:34.800> 4

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
this would be also on the PlayStation 4

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.700 
this would be also on the PlayStation 4
camera<00:00:35.940> since<00:00:36.270> you<00:00:36.630> know<00:00:36.750> they<00:00:36.989> basically<00:00:37.410> do

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
camera since you know they basically do

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.889 
camera since you know they basically do
the<00:00:37.890> same<00:00:37.920> things<00:00:38.489> to<00:00:38.760> see<00:00:39.390> if<00:00:39.480> this<00:00:39.629> could<00:00:39.780> be

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
the same things to see if this could be

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.930 
the same things to see if this could be
implemented<00:00:40.379> but<00:00:40.890> I<00:00:40.950> haven't<00:00:41.340> heard<00:00:41.640> anything

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
implemented but I haven't heard anything

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.060 
implemented but I haven't heard anything
yet<00:00:42.149> so<00:00:42.480> as<00:00:42.660> of<00:00:42.899> now<00:00:42.930> these<00:00:43.350> are<00:00:43.530> just<00:00:43.559> Kinect

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
yet so as of now these are just Kinect

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.889 
yet so as of now these are just Kinect
features<00:00:44.399> that<00:00:44.550> I'm<00:00:44.670> talking<00:00:45.000> about<00:00:45.059> but<00:00:45.840> of

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
features that I'm talking about but of

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.240 
features that I'm talking about but of
course<00:00:46.110> if<00:00:46.289> we<00:00:46.440> hear<00:00:46.620> anything<00:00:46.800> else<00:00:47.070> then

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
course if we hear anything else then

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.340 
course if we hear anything else then
I'll<00:00:47.370> let<00:00:47.520> you<00:00:47.640> know<00:00:47.670> so<00:00:48.270> let's<00:00:48.510> go<00:00:48.629> over<00:00:48.780> what

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
I'll let you know so let's go over what

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.310 
I'll let you know so let's go over what
it<00:00:49.590> will<00:00:49.800> do<00:00:50.010> with<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.210> Kinect<00:00:51.570> we'll<00:00:52.170> first

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
it will do with the Kinect we'll first

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.040 
it will do with the Kinect we'll first
go<00:00:52.440> over<00:00:52.530> voice<00:00:53.250> commands<00:00:53.820> now<00:00:54.239> this<00:00:54.539> all<00:00:54.750> came

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
go over voice commands now this all came

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.869 
go over voice commands now this all came
from<00:00:55.320> an<00:00:55.500> image<00:00:55.860> that<00:00:56.010> just<00:00:56.070> popped<00:00:56.460> up<00:00:56.640> online

00:00:56.869 --> 00:00:56.879 
from an image that just popped up online

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.990 
from an image that just popped up online
in<00:00:57.390> it<00:00:57.510> I<00:00:57.660> mean<00:00:57.690> it<00:00:57.930> looks<00:00:58.140> legit<00:00:58.829> but<00:00:59.489> I<00:00:59.699> guess

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
in it I mean it looks legit but I guess

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.209 
in it I mean it looks legit but I guess
until<00:01:00.480> you<00:01:00.750> officially<00:01:01.289> see<00:01:01.500> it<00:01:01.649> actually

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
until you officially see it actually

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.240 
until you officially see it actually
being<00:01:02.730> used<00:01:02.969> I<00:01:03.180> guess<00:01:03.210> keep<00:01:03.870> it<00:01:04.019> as<00:01:04.140> rumor<00:01:04.739> but

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
being used I guess keep it as rumor but

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.280 
being used I guess keep it as rumor but
I<00:01:05.280> think<00:01:05.729> it's<00:01:05.970> it's<00:01:06.330> close<00:01:06.689> enough<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.140> where

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
I think it's it's close enough to where

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.140 
I think it's it's close enough to where
I'm<00:01:07.439> I<00:01:07.979> feel<00:01:08.310> comfortable<00:01:08.700> telling<00:01:08.880> you<00:01:09.060> about

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
I'm I feel comfortable telling you about

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.510 
I'm I feel comfortable telling you about
so<00:01:09.810> here's<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.260> voice<00:01:10.409> commands<00:01:10.920> you've<00:01:11.310> got

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
so here's the voice commands you've got

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.859 
so here's the voice commands you've got
medic<00:01:12.150> need<00:01:12.900> medic<00:01:13.380> need<00:01:13.830> healing<00:01:14.100> go<00:01:14.970> go<00:01:15.210> go

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
medic need medic need healing go go go

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.580 
medic need medic need healing go go go
affirmative<00:01:16.650> Roger<00:01:17.400> thank<00:01:18.299> you<00:01:18.570> need<00:01:19.049> ammo

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
affirmative Roger thank you need ammo

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.060 
affirmative Roger thank you need ammo
need<00:01:20.070> ammunition<00:01:20.479> need<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.509> ride<00:01:21.869> need<00:01:22.740> pickup

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
need ammunition need a ride need pickup

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.850 
need ammunition need a ride need pickup
so<00:01:23.729> basically<00:01:24.330> all<00:01:24.479> of<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.229> commands<00:01:25.619> that

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
so basically all of the commands that

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.800 
so basically all of the commands that
you<00:01:25.950> could<00:01:26.100> pull<00:01:26.310> up<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.790> do<00:01:26.970> on<00:01:27.240> the<00:01:27.390> radial

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
you could pull up and do on the radial

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.560 
you could pull up and do on the radial
dial<00:01:28.140> then<00:01:29.040> you<00:01:29.189> could<00:01:29.340> actually<00:01:29.490> go<00:01:30.329> ahead

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
dial then you could actually go ahead

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:31.969 
dial then you could actually go ahead
and<00:01:30.750> say<00:01:30.930> with<00:01:31.110> your<00:01:31.200> voice<00:01:31.350> commands<00:01:31.829> and

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
and say with your voice commands and

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.800 
and say with your voice commands and
it'll<00:01:32.280> go<00:01:32.400> ahead<00:01:32.549> and<00:01:32.820> initiate<00:01:33.000> that<00:01:33.509> and<00:01:33.750> I

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
it'll go ahead and initiate that and I

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.870 
it'll go ahead and initiate that and I
think<00:01:34.049> it<00:01:34.170> pops<00:01:34.439> up<00:01:34.619> something<00:01:34.979> on<00:01:35.670> the

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
think it pops up something on the

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.429 
think it pops up something on the
mini-map<00:01:36.150> to<00:01:36.479> tell<00:01:36.659> that<00:01:36.840> player<00:01:37.079> you<00:01:37.320> know

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
mini-map to tell that player you know

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.620 
mini-map to tell that player you know
this<00:01:37.619> player<00:01:37.860> wants<00:01:38.729> pickup<00:01:39.119> or<00:01:39.299> ammunition

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
this player wants pickup or ammunition

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.990 
this player wants pickup or ammunition
or<00:01:40.049> whatever<00:01:40.380> else<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:41.340> other<00:01:41.369> features

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
or whatever else the other features

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.520 
or whatever else the other features
though<00:01:42.210> that<00:01:42.420> look<00:01:42.600> really<00:01:42.899> interesting

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
though that look really interesting

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.530 
though that look really interesting
which<00:01:44.100> even<00:01:44.460> set<00:01:44.670> would<00:01:44.909> sound<00:01:45.119> a<00:01:45.210> lot<00:01:45.299> cooler

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
which even set would sound a lot cooler

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.080 
which even set would sound a lot cooler
honestly<00:01:46.170> then<00:01:46.799> the<00:01:46.920> voice<00:01:47.070> commands<00:01:47.640> are

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
honestly then the voice commands are

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.639 
honestly then the voice commands are
these<00:01:48.540> other<00:01:48.780> features<00:01:49.020> that<00:01:49.200> you<00:01:49.380> can

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
these other features that you can

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.740 
these other features that you can
initiate<00:01:50.250> so<00:01:50.700> one<00:01:51.030> you<00:01:51.180> can<00:01:51.329> pick<00:01:51.630> your

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
initiate so one you can pick your

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.359 
initiate so one you can pick your
dialect<00:01:52.259> so<00:01:52.590> if<00:01:52.740> you<00:01:52.860> live<00:01:53.040> somewhere<00:01:53.250> else

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
dialect so if you live somewhere else

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.520 
dialect so if you live somewhere else
then<00:01:53.729> of<00:01:53.820> course<00:01:54.030> you<00:01:54.720> can<00:01:54.869> set<00:01:55.110> that<00:01:55.290> up<00:01:55.350> so

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
then of course you can set that up so

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.910 
then of course you can set that up so
it'll<00:01:55.799> easily<00:01:56.479> understand<00:01:57.479> you<00:01:57.630> but<00:01:58.469> there<00:01:58.740> is

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
it'll easily understand you but there is

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.550 
it'll easily understand you but there is
a<00:01:58.950> feature<00:01:59.310> called<00:01:59.460> leaning<00:02:00.270> and<00:02:00.509> abled<00:02:01.049> that

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
a feature called leaning and abled that

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.520 
a feature called leaning and abled that
you<00:02:01.740> can<00:02:02.009> turn<00:02:02.310> on<00:02:02.640> and<00:02:03.000> you<00:02:03.540> can<00:02:03.659> also<00:02:03.840> set<00:02:04.320> the

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
you can turn on and you can also set the

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.980 
you can turn on and you can also set the
leaning<00:02:04.920> sensitivity<00:02:05.670> now<00:02:06.119> whenever<00:02:06.390> leaning

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
leaning sensitivity now whenever leaning

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.139 
leaning sensitivity now whenever leaning
enabled<00:02:07.560> is<00:02:07.680> on<00:02:07.950> there's<00:02:08.849> apparently

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
enabled is on there's apparently

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.809 
enabled is on there's apparently
different<00:02:09.750> options<00:02:10.200> one<00:02:10.440> of<00:02:10.500> them<00:02:10.800> being<00:02:11.099> when

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
different options one of them being when

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.760 
different options one of them being when
zoomed<00:02:12.180> in<00:02:12.450> so<00:02:12.989> the<00:02:13.260> question

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
zoomed in so the question

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.160 
zoomed in so the question
you<00:02:13.980> know<00:02:14.100> how<00:02:14.280> does<00:02:14.340> this<00:02:14.700> work<00:02:15.060> and<00:02:15.510> I<00:02:15.900> would

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
you know how does this work and I would

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:18.020 
you know how does this work and I would
assume<00:02:16.320> that<00:02:16.620> if<00:02:17.130> you<00:02:17.280> are<00:02:17.460> a<00:02:17.490> sniper<00:02:17.880> or

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
assume that if you are a sniper or

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.000 
assume that if you are a sniper or
something<00:02:18.450> or<00:02:18.570> or<00:02:18.690> anybody<00:02:19.260> you<00:02:19.500> could<00:02:19.800> just

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
something or or anybody you could just

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.950 
something or or anybody you could just
you<00:02:20.430> know<00:02:20.460> kind<00:02:20.850> of<00:02:20.910> lean<00:02:21.510> over

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:21.960 
you know kind of lean over

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.500 
you know kind of lean over
and<00:02:22.140> peek<00:02:23.070> out<00:02:23.280> behind<00:02:23.670> a<00:02:23.790> wall<00:02:23.970> if<00:02:24.150> you<00:02:24.270> wanted

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
and peek out behind a wall if you wanted

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.150 
and peek out behind a wall if you wanted
to<00:02:24.660> to<00:02:24.780> kind<00:02:24.930> of<00:02:24.990> see<00:02:25.140> if<00:02:25.230> anybody's<00:02:25.710> there<00:02:25.740> and

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
to to kind of see if anybody's there and

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.610 
to to kind of see if anybody's there and
so<00:02:26.820> you<00:02:27.570> can<00:02:27.720> set<00:02:27.930> the<00:02:28.050> sensitivity<00:02:28.290> to

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
so you can set the sensitivity to

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.860 
so you can set the sensitivity to
determine<00:02:29.310> you<00:02:29.400> know<00:02:29.430> how<00:02:29.550> how<00:02:30.330> much<00:02:30.540> you<00:02:30.720> want

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
determine you know how how much you want

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:32.630 
determine you know how how much you want
to<00:02:30.930> lean<00:02:31.110> and<00:02:31.380> maybe<00:02:31.860> you<00:02:32.010> already<00:02:32.190> have<00:02:32.370> that

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
to lean and maybe you already have that

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:33.860 
to lean and maybe you already have that
move<00:02:32.820> down<00:02:33.030> if<00:02:33.240> you've<00:02:33.360> been<00:02:33.450> playing<00:02:33.690> some<00:02:33.810> of

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
move down if you've been playing some of

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.990 
move down if you've been playing some of
them<00:02:33.990> dancing<00:02:34.410> games<00:02:34.590> or<00:02:34.800> something<00:02:35.160> with<00:02:35.910> the

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
them dancing games or something with the

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.210 
them dancing games or something with the
Kinect<00:02:36.300> the<00:02:36.690> other<00:02:36.900> feature<00:02:37.200> is<00:02:37.350> head

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
Kinect the other feature is head

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.760 
Kinect the other feature is head
tracking<00:02:38.760> and<00:02:38.940> this<00:02:39.600> is<00:02:39.780> the<00:02:39.900> one<00:02:40.110> that<00:02:40.350> really

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:40.770 
tracking and this is the one that really

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.450 
tracking and this is the one that really
I<00:02:41.130> think<00:02:41.700> sounds<00:02:42.600> interesting<00:02:42.980> so<00:02:43.980> the<00:02:44.280> way

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.460 
I think sounds interesting so the way

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:46.670 
I think sounds interesting so the way
that<00:02:44.760> it<00:02:44.970> has<00:02:45.150> worked<00:02:45.480> before<00:02:45.810> so<00:02:46.080> I'm<00:02:46.470> just

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
that it has worked before so I'm just

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.000 
that it has worked before so I'm just
going<00:02:46.980> off<00:02:47.250> this<00:02:47.520> is<00:02:47.900> on<00:02:48.900> the<00:02:49.110> PC<00:02:49.500> there<00:02:49.740> is<00:02:49.860> the

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
going off this is on the PC there is the

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.850 
going off this is on the PC there is the
device<00:02:50.340> called<00:02:50.820> the<00:02:51.420> track<00:02:51.810> IR<00:02:52.350> that<00:02:52.620> you<00:02:52.680> can

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
device called the track IR that you can

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.580 
device called the track IR that you can
buy<00:02:53.010> and<00:02:53.310> basically<00:02:54.090> it<00:02:54.390> watches<00:02:55.230> your<00:02:55.380> head

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:55.590 
buy and basically it watches your head

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.800 
buy and basically it watches your head
movement<00:02:56.040> and<00:02:56.190> so<00:02:56.730> you<00:02:56.790> could<00:02:57.090> barely<00:02:57.360> turn

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
movement and so you could barely turn

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:00.320 
movement and so you could barely turn
your<00:02:58.080> head<00:02:58.320> and<00:02:58.800> you<00:02:59.670> can<00:02:59.820> adjust<00:02:59.940> the

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:00.330 
your head and you can adjust the

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.750 
your head and you can adjust the
sensitivity<00:03:00.480> so<00:03:01.470> that<00:03:01.740> as<00:03:02.280> you<00:03:02.520> turn<00:03:02.730> your

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
sensitivity so that as you turn your

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.800 
sensitivity so that as you turn your
head<00:03:03.200> the<00:03:04.200> camera<00:03:04.650> moves<00:03:04.890> your<00:03:05.790> player<00:03:06.090> camera

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
head the camera moves your player camera

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.570 
head the camera moves your player camera
moves<00:03:07.170> and<00:03:07.470> like<00:03:07.650> looks<00:03:07.920> around<00:03:08.220> so<00:03:08.460> this

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
moves and like looks around so this

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.760 
moves and like looks around so this
would<00:03:08.760> be<00:03:08.850> a<00:03:08.880> really<00:03:09.270> useful<00:03:09.780> like<00:03:10.200> in<00:03:10.380> a<00:03:10.410> jet

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:10.770 
would be a really useful like in a jet

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:12.920 
would be a really useful like in a jet
or<00:03:10.980> a<00:03:11.010> aircraft<00:03:11.850> so<00:03:12.300> you<00:03:12.360> could<00:03:12.600> continue

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
or a aircraft so you could continue

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.200 
or a aircraft so you could continue
flying<00:03:13.440> straight<00:03:13.800> or<00:03:14.280> even<00:03:14.730> running<00:03:14.970> you

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:15.210 
flying straight or even running you

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:17.660 
flying straight or even running you
could<00:03:15.360> be<00:03:15.690> running<00:03:15.990> at<00:03:16.680> least<00:03:16.920> in<00:03:17.070> Arma<00:03:17.490> you

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
could be running at least in Arma you

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.760 
could be running at least in Arma you
could<00:03:17.910> and<00:03:18.120> be<00:03:18.840> able<00:03:18.900> to<00:03:19.140> turn<00:03:19.350> around<00:03:19.380> and

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:19.770 
could and be able to turn around and

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:21.290 
could and be able to turn around and
look<00:03:19.950> around<00:03:20.100> and<00:03:20.460> so<00:03:20.610> you<00:03:20.670> could<00:03:20.880> set<00:03:21.090> up<00:03:21.180> the

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:21.300 
look around and so you could set up the

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:24.350 
look around and so you could set up the
sensitivity<00:03:21.900> to<00:03:22.050> where<00:03:22.850> what<00:03:23.850> I<00:03:23.880> think<00:03:24.210> would

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
sensitivity to where what I think would

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.910 
sensitivity to where what I think would
be<00:03:24.390> really<00:03:24.480> useful<00:03:24.840> is<00:03:25.320> like<00:03:25.530> if<00:03:25.680> you're

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
be really useful is like if you're

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.370 
be really useful is like if you're
trying<00:03:26.910> to<00:03:27.060> watch<00:03:27.240> a<00:03:27.390> flag<00:03:27.690> maybe<00:03:27.990> you're<00:03:28.200> in<00:03:28.290> a

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:28.380 
trying to watch a flag maybe you're in a

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:30.380 
trying to watch a flag maybe you're in a
room<00:03:28.620> and<00:03:28.830> there's<00:03:29.250> like<00:03:29.400> two<00:03:29.730> doors<00:03:29.910> on<00:03:30.210> each

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.390 
room and there's like two doors on each

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.270 
room and there's like two doors on each
side<00:03:30.690> then<00:03:31.170> you<00:03:31.290> could<00:03:31.470> you<00:03:31.680> know<00:03:31.800> swing<00:03:32.100> back

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
side then you could you know swing back

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:34.160 
side then you could you know swing back
and<00:03:32.310> forth<00:03:32.550> real<00:03:32.970> quick<00:03:33.210> and<00:03:33.420> be<00:03:33.720> able<00:03:33.840> to<00:03:33.990> look

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
and forth real quick and be able to look

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:36.140 
and forth real quick and be able to look
back<00:03:34.380> and<00:03:34.590> forth<00:03:34.800> without<00:03:35.370> moving<00:03:35.790> your<00:03:35.940> gun

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
back and forth without moving your gun

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.670 
back and forth without moving your gun
and<00:03:36.360> your<00:03:36.480> whole<00:03:36.690> body<00:03:36.930> and<00:03:37.170> leaving<00:03:37.500> yourself

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
and your whole body and leaving yourself

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.330 
and your whole body and leaving yourself
exposed<00:03:38.450> so<00:03:39.450> if<00:03:39.720> that<00:03:40.320> works<00:03:40.620> out<00:03:40.920> like<00:03:41.190> it

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
exposed so if that works out like it

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:45.170 
exposed so if that works out like it
does<00:03:41.580> on<00:03:41.610> ARMA<00:03:42.540> and<00:03:42.780> the<00:03:43.200> track<00:03:43.470> IR<00:03:44.010> then<00:03:44.850> that

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
does on ARMA and the track IR then that

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:46.610 
does on ARMA and the track IR then that
is<00:03:45.360> something<00:03:45.510> that<00:03:45.690> would<00:03:45.930> be<00:03:46.020> really<00:03:46.590> I

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
is something that would be really I

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.710 
is something that would be really I
think<00:03:47.040> interesting<00:03:47.340> and<00:03:48.090> a<00:03:48.240> pretty<00:03:48.480> cool

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
think interesting and a pretty cool

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.860 
think interesting and a pretty cool
feature<00:03:48.990> and<00:03:49.260> I<00:03:50.130> don't<00:03:50.400> think<00:03:50.760> the<00:03:51.030> track<00:03:51.330> IR

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:51.870 
feature and I don't think the track IR

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.680 
feature and I don't think the track IR
is<00:03:52.170> considered<00:03:52.950> gimmicky<00:03:53.430> at<00:03:53.640> all<00:03:53.910> in<00:03:54.180> the

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
is considered gimmicky at all in the

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.840 
is considered gimmicky at all in the
arma<00:03:55.050> community<00:03:55.160> so<00:03:56.160> I've<00:03:56.460> heard<00:03:56.640> a<00:03:56.700> lot<00:03:56.820> of

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850

the<00:04:19.040> the<00:04:20.040> head<00:04:20.280> tracking<00:04:20.750> ability<00:04:21.750> if<00:04:21.960> you<00:04:22.229> are

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
the the head tracking ability if you are

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:24.530 
the the head tracking ability if you are
picking<00:04:23.340> up<00:04:23.460> the<00:04:23.580> Kinect<00:04:23.880> is<00:04:24.060> that<00:04:24.210> something

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:24.540 
picking up the Kinect is that something

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:26.630 
picking up the Kinect is that something
you're<00:04:24.660> going<00:04:24.810> to<00:04:24.930> enable<00:04:25.470> and<00:04:25.650> also<00:04:26.370> do<00:04:26.610> you

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:26.640 
you're going to enable and also do you

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:27.010 
you're going to enable and also do you
think

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
think

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:28.890 
think
is<00:04:27.080> something<00:04:27.590> that<00:04:27.770> will<00:04:27.949> also<00:04:28.370> be<00:04:28.580> on<00:04:28.819> the

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
is something that will also be on the

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.480 
is something that will also be on the
PlayStation<00:04:29.900> camera<00:04:30.080> you<00:04:30.530> know<00:04:30.650> it<00:04:31.160> seems

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 
PlayStation camera you know it seems

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:33.969 
PlayStation camera you know it seems
like<00:04:31.759> it<00:04:32.210> wouldn't<00:04:32.509> be<00:04:32.569> difficult<00:04:32.840> for<00:04:33.830> them

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:33.979 
like it wouldn't be difficult for them

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:36.640 
like it wouldn't be difficult for them
to<00:04:34.190> turn<00:04:34.699> that<00:04:34.910> on<00:04:35.120> either<00:04:35.720> suppose<00:04:36.409> below

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
to turn that on either suppose below
