oh<00:00:00.500> hi<00:00:01.500> I'd<00:00:01.620> like<00:00:01.680> to<00:00:01.800> show<00:00:02.100> you<00:00:02.159> a<00:00:02.340> little

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:02.520 
oh hi I'd like to show you a little

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.909 
oh hi I'd like to show you a little
trinket<00:00:02.940> involving<00:00:03.389> polymers<00:00:03.989> the<00:00:04.439> polymer

00:00:04.909 --> 00:00:04.919 
trinket involving polymers the polymer

00:00:04.919 --> 00:00:08.710 
trinket involving polymers the polymer
in<00:00:04.979> here<00:00:05.220> is<00:00:05.339> Pinal<00:00:06.229> polyvinyl<00:00:07.340> propylene<00:00:08.340> and

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:08.720 
in here is Pinal polyvinyl propylene and

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.930 
in here is Pinal polyvinyl propylene and
polyvinyl<00:00:09.720> propylene<00:00:10.200> is<00:00:10.520> sometimes<00:00:11.520> used<00:00:11.730> as

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
polyvinyl propylene is sometimes used as

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.880 
polyvinyl propylene is sometimes used as
like<00:00:12.120> a<00:00:12.150> light<00:00:12.450> adhesive<00:00:13.050> so<00:00:13.230> there's<00:00:13.440> there's

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:13.890 
like a light adhesive so there's there's

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:16.189 
like a light adhesive so there's there's
gluing<00:00:14.280> agents<00:00:14.700> inside<00:00:15.030> of<00:00:15.240> hair<00:00:15.480> gel<00:00:15.720> now

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
gluing agents inside of hair gel now

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.279 
gluing agents inside of hair gel now
hair<00:00:16.470> gel<00:00:16.800> is<00:00:17.369> water<00:00:17.789> and<00:00:18.119> this<00:00:18.359> polymer<00:00:18.990> so<00:00:19.169> we

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
hair gel is water and this polymer so we

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.230 
hair gel is water and this polymer so we
have<00:00:19.529> here<00:00:19.890> a<00:00:19.980> little<00:00:20.490> picture<00:00:20.699> up<00:00:20.939> on<00:00:21.060> the

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
have here a little picture up on the

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.419 
have here a little picture up on the
board<00:00:21.480> showing<00:00:21.810> polymer<00:00:22.679> strands<00:00:23.039> that<00:00:23.369> are

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:23.429 
board showing polymer strands that are

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:25.339 
board showing polymer strands that are
interlocked<00:00:24.060> you<00:00:24.720> can<00:00:24.869> think<00:00:25.079> of<00:00:25.199> this<00:00:25.289> as

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:25.349 
interlocked you can think of this as

00:00:25.349 --> 00:00:28.040 
interlocked you can think of this as
being<00:00:25.740> some<00:00:25.919> type<00:00:26.130> of<00:00:26.159> a<00:00:26.400> matrix<00:00:26.759> here<00:00:27.329> and<00:00:27.539> so

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
being some type of a matrix here and so

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.659 
being some type of a matrix here and so
when<00:00:28.259> somebody<00:00:28.499> takes<00:00:28.859> them<00:00:29.099> and<00:00:29.279> puts<00:00:29.489> on

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:29.669 
when somebody takes them and puts on

00:00:29.669 --> 00:00:31.790 
when somebody takes them and puts on
their<00:00:29.849> hair<00:00:30.150> these<00:00:30.810> strands<00:00:31.140> are<00:00:31.380> coating<00:00:31.710> the

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
their hair these strands are coating the

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.950 
their hair these strands are coating the
hairs<00:00:32.040> locking<00:00:32.879> them<00:00:33.000> into<00:00:33.239> shape<00:00:33.480> and<00:00:33.780> so

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
hairs locking them into shape and so

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.740 
hairs locking them into shape and so
your<00:00:34.920> hair<00:00:35.100> has<00:00:35.309> this<00:00:35.550> shape<00:00:35.789> for<00:00:36.120> several

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
your hair has this shape for several

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.630 
your hair has this shape for several
hours<00:00:36.840> maybe<00:00:37.199> all<00:00:37.379> day<00:00:37.590> now<00:00:38.070> I'm<00:00:38.219> gonna<00:00:38.340> take<00:00:38.579> a

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
hours maybe all day now I'm gonna take a

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.910 
hours maybe all day now I'm gonna take a
little<00:00:38.879> bit<00:00:39.059> of<00:00:39.120> this<00:00:39.359> and<00:00:39.719> some<00:00:40.440> people<00:00:40.739> do

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
little bit of this and some people do

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.520 
little bit of this and some people do
and<00:00:41.160> put<00:00:41.940> it<00:00:42.000> inside<00:00:42.210> of<00:00:42.269> a<00:00:42.420> beaker<00:00:42.600> I<00:00:43.019> guess

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
and put it inside of a beaker I guess

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.319 
and put it inside of a beaker I guess
some<00:00:43.739> people<00:00:43.769> put<00:00:44.190> it<00:00:44.280> on<00:00:44.340> their<00:00:44.519> hair<00:00:44.730> let's

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
some people put it on their hair let's

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.630 
some people put it on their hair let's
say<00:00:45.449> you<00:00:45.539> have<00:00:45.690> a<00:00:45.719> friend<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:46.620> they<00:00:47.250> wear<00:00:47.429> some

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
say you have a friend and they wear some

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.459 
say you have a friend and they wear some
hair<00:00:47.820> gel<00:00:48.059> in<00:00:48.090> their<00:00:48.359> hair<00:00:48.390> you<00:00:48.750> might<00:00:49.260> have

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
hair gel in their hair you might have

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:50.779 
hair gel in their hair you might have
like<00:00:49.679> a<00:00:49.710> little<00:00:49.949> falling<00:00:50.340> out<00:00:50.460> or<00:00:50.670> be

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
like a little falling out or be

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.310 
like a little falling out or be
irritated<00:00:51.329> because<00:00:51.600> they've<00:00:51.780> said<00:00:51.989> something

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
irritated because they've said something

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.529 
irritated because they've said something
rude<00:00:52.530> you<00:00:53.160> can<00:00:53.460> destroy<00:00:53.879> their<00:00:54.089> hair<00:00:54.269> for<00:00:54.449> the

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
rude you can destroy their hair for the

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.139 
rude you can destroy their hair for the
day<00:00:54.690> they<00:00:55.289> have<00:00:55.500> their<00:00:55.710> hair<00:00:55.920> all<00:00:56.100> gelled<00:00:56.399> and

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
day they have their hair all gelled and

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.459 
day they have their hair all gelled and
we're<00:00:57.359> going<00:00:57.510> to<00:00:57.570> put<00:00:57.750> some<00:00:57.960> salt<00:00:58.230> just

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
we're going to put some salt just

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.950 
we're going to put some salt just
regular<00:00:59.160> table<00:00:59.579> salt<00:00:59.609> sodium<00:01:00.300> chlorine<00:01:00.690> just

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
regular table salt sodium chlorine just

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.410 
regular table salt sodium chlorine just
a<00:01:01.050> little<00:01:01.260> bit<00:01:01.640> just<00:01:02.640> a<00:01:02.820> little<00:01:02.850> bit<00:01:03.179> in<00:01:03.269> there

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
a little bit just a little bit in there

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.999 
a little bit just a little bit in there
now<00:01:03.899> you<00:01:03.960> can<00:01:04.199> go<00:01:04.350> ahead<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:04.680> just<00:01:04.769> take<00:01:04.979> some

00:01:04.999 --> 00:01:05.009 
now you can go ahead and just take some

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:07.280 
now you can go ahead and just take some
sprinkle<00:01:05.670> it<00:01:05.759> on<00:01:05.939> their<00:01:06.090> hair<00:01:06.240> now<00:01:06.720> the<00:01:06.780> sodium

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
sprinkle it on their hair now the sodium

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.649 
sprinkle it on their hair now the sodium
chloride<00:01:07.860> is<00:01:08.009> going<00:01:08.070> to<00:01:08.220> dissolve<00:01:08.360> it's<00:01:09.360> going

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
chloride is going to dissolve it's going

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:12.620 
chloride is going to dissolve it's going
to<00:01:09.840> break<00:01:10.110> up<00:01:10.380> this<00:01:10.710> matrix<00:01:11.369> the<00:01:11.850> sodium<00:01:12.270> plus

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
to break up this matrix the sodium plus

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.020 
to break up this matrix the sodium plus
the<00:01:13.439> CL<00:01:13.770> minus<00:01:13.799> are<00:01:14.369> going<00:01:14.490> to<00:01:14.579> interfere<00:01:14.970> with

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
the CL minus are going to interfere with

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.819 
the CL minus are going to interfere with
these<00:01:15.299> strands<00:01:15.659> and<00:01:15.960> we're<00:01:16.290> going<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:16.470> end<00:01:16.649> up

00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:16.829 
these strands and we're going to end up

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:20.929 
these strands and we're going to end up
with<00:01:16.950> strands<00:01:17.460> that<00:01:17.610> are<00:01:17.670> no<00:01:17.909> longer<00:01:18.119> in<00:01:19.939> or

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
with strands that are no longer in or

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.030 
with strands that are no longer in or
linked<00:01:21.299> and<00:01:21.450> so<00:01:21.930> what<00:01:22.140> we're<00:01:22.259> going<00:01:22.409> to<00:01:22.530> get<00:01:22.799> is

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
linked and so what we're going to get is

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.609 
linked and so what we're going to get is
we're<00:01:23.520> gonna<00:01:23.700> get<00:01:23.939> something<00:01:24.329> this<00:01:24.509> lot<00:01:25.200> far

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
we're gonna get something this lot far

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:27.410 
we're gonna get something this lot far
more<00:01:25.890> a<00:01:25.950> liquid<00:01:26.430> like<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:26.850> so<00:01:27.210> they'll<00:01:27.390> have

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
more a liquid like and so they'll have

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.690 
more a liquid like and so they'll have
droopy<00:01:28.049> hair<00:01:28.320> for<00:01:28.560> the<00:01:28.649> day<00:01:28.860> so<00:01:29.340> we've<00:01:29.490> broken

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
droopy hair for the day so we've broken

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.450 
droopy hair for the day so we've broken
up<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.119> polymer<00:01:30.570> matrix<00:01:30.719> many<00:01:31.710> times<00:01:32.009> this<00:01:32.250> is

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
up the polymer matrix many times this is

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.639 
up the polymer matrix many times this is
not<00:01:32.700> desirable<00:01:33.090> usually<00:01:33.780> we'd<00:01:34.020> like<00:01:34.259> to<00:01:34.409> make

00:01:34.639 --> 00:01:34.649 
not desirable usually we'd like to make

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:36.200 
not desirable usually we'd like to make
polymers<00:01:35.219> and<00:01:35.369> make<00:01:35.520> something<00:01:35.729> instead<00:01:36.149> of

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
polymers and make something instead of

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.600 
polymers and make something instead of
be<00:01:36.899> destructive<00:01:37.500> there's<00:01:38.159> something<00:01:38.430> else

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
be destructive there's something else

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.639 
be destructive there's something else
going<00:01:38.939> on<00:01:39.060> you<00:01:39.299> have<00:01:39.689> no<00:01:39.899> opportunity<00:01:40.170> to

00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:40.649 
going on you have no opportunity to

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:42.950 
going on you have no opportunity to
experience<00:01:41.159> this<00:01:41.399> on<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.700> video<00:01:41.850> but<00:01:42.060> many<00:01:42.840> of

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
experience this on the video but many of

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.410 
experience this on the video but many of
these<00:01:43.110> hair<00:01:43.320> products<00:01:43.740> have<00:01:44.280> perfumed<00:01:44.939> large

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
these hair products have perfumed large

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.080 
these hair products have perfumed large
perfume<00:01:46.079> or<00:01:46.259> cologne<00:01:46.439> molecules<00:01:47.250> inside<00:01:47.909> of

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
perfume or cologne molecules inside of

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.429 
perfume or cologne molecules inside of
there<00:01:48.210> so<00:01:48.600> think<00:01:48.780> of<00:01:48.840> these<00:01:48.960> Cologne

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
there so think of these Cologne

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.260 
there so think of these Cologne
molecules<00:01:50.009> as<00:01:50.159> being<00:01:50.369> trapped<00:01:50.610> inside<00:01:50.880> the

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
molecules as being trapped inside the

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.209 
molecules as being trapped inside the
polymer<00:01:51.719> strands<00:01:52.020> the<00:01:52.259> matrix<00:01:52.649> well<00:01:53.130> I<00:01:53.159> just

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:53.219 
polymer strands the matrix well I just

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:54.950 
polymer strands the matrix well I just
went<00:01:53.610> ahead<00:01:53.700> and<00:01:53.820> busted<00:01:54.299> up<00:01:54.450> and<00:01:54.659> can<00:01:54.780> tell

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
went ahead and busted up and can tell

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.039 
went ahead and busted up and can tell
you<00:01:55.170> that<00:01:55.409> the<00:01:55.890> the<00:01:56.609> smell<00:01:56.909> is<00:01:57.180> really<00:01:57.780> great

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
you that the the smell is really great

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.840 
you that the the smell is really great
now<00:01:58.229> because<00:01:58.649> these<00:01:59.159> have<00:01:59.310> been<00:01:59.399> released

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
now because these have been released

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.940 
now because these have been released
when<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.570> polymer<00:02:00.930> strands<00:02:01.289> went<00:02:01.590> straight

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
when the polymer strands went straight

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.420 
when the polymer strands went straight
for<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:03.329> perfumes<00:02:03.960> and<00:02:04.229> so<00:02:04.680> there's<00:02:05.039> quite

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
for the perfumes and so there's quite

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.069 
for the perfumes and so there's quite
quite<00:02:06.060> an<00:02:06.180> order<00:02:06.450> here<00:02:06.630> that's<00:02:06.899> not

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
quite an order here that's not

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:08.630 
quite an order here that's not
unpleasant<00:02:07.710> but<00:02:07.890> just<00:02:08.070> in<00:02:08.340> high

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640 
unpleasant but just in high

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.420
