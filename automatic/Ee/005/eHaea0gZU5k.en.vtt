off the groove tube if you notice

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:12.010 
off the groove tube if you notice
anything<00:01:11.060> interesting<00:01:11.149> about<00:01:11.539> the<00:01:11.810> groove

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
anything interesting about the groove

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.289 
anything interesting about the groove
tube<00:01:12.259> it's<00:01:12.950> exactly<00:01:13.399> what<00:01:13.670> it's<00:01:13.819> called<00:01:13.880> it

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:14.299 
tube it's exactly what it's called it

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:18.249 
tube it's exactly what it's called it
has<00:01:14.450> no<00:01:14.780> holes<00:01:15.729> nothing<00:01:16.729> to<00:01:17.179> decrease<00:01:18.109> the

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:18.259 
has no holes nothing to decrease the

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:20.249 
has no holes nothing to decrease the
integrity<00:01:18.740> of<00:01:18.979> the<00:01:19.340> strength<00:01:19.579> of<00:01:19.729> the<00:01:19.819> hoop

00:01:20.249 --> 00:01:20.259 
integrity of the strength of the hoop

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:23.760 
integrity of the strength of the hoop
the<00:01:21.259> inner<00:01:21.590> portion<00:01:21.950> of<00:01:22.310> the<00:01:22.789> groove<00:01:22.969> who

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
the inner portion of the groove who

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.069 
the inner portion of the groove who
bends<00:01:24.770> inwards<00:01:25.520> so<00:01:25.789> it<00:01:26.359> brings<00:01:26.539> a<00:01:26.780> lot<00:01:27.020> of

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:27.079 
bends inwards so it brings a lot of

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:29.919 
bends inwards so it brings a lot of
vibration<00:01:27.399> back<00:01:28.399> to<00:01:28.729> the<00:01:28.880> central<00:01:29.209> snare<00:01:29.630> drum

00:01:29.919 --> 00:01:29.929 
vibration back to the central snare drum

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:33.879 
vibration back to the central snare drum
it<00:01:30.139> increases<00:01:31.039> sensitivity<00:01:32.590> so<00:01:33.590> let's<00:01:33.740> take<00:01:33.859> a

00:01:33.879 --> 00:01:33.889 
it increases sensitivity so let's take a

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:36.309 
it increases sensitivity so let's take a
closer<00:01:34.159> look<00:01:34.279> again<00:01:34.689> very<00:01:35.689> easy<00:01:35.869> to<00:01:36.049> give<00:01:36.170> your

00:01:36.309 --> 00:01:36.319 
closer look again very easy to give your

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:38.910 
closer look again very easy to give your
snare<00:01:36.770> drum<00:01:36.829> just<00:01:37.249> a<00:01:37.310> couple<00:01:37.520> turns<00:01:37.759> back

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
snare drum just a couple turns back

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.120 
snare drum just a couple turns back
decrease<00:01:39.920> the<00:01:40.039> tuning<00:01:40.340> a<00:01:40.399> little<00:01:40.609> bit<00:01:42.130> you

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
decrease the tuning a little bit you

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:44.830 
decrease the tuning a little bit you
don't<00:01:43.159> have<00:01:43.609> to<00:01:43.759> take<00:01:43.939> the<00:01:44.090> tension<00:01:44.450> rods<00:01:44.630> out

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
don't have to take the tension rods out

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:50.559 
don't have to take the tension rods out
of<00:01:44.959> the<00:01:45.590> drum<00:01:45.829> entirely<00:01:49.270> everything<00:01:50.270> flips

00:01:50.559 --> 00:01:50.569 
of the drum entirely everything flips

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:55.750 
of the drum entirely everything flips
back

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:55.760 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.680 

nothing<00:01:56.270> gets<00:01:56.480> lost<00:01:58.150> nothing<00:01:59.150> falls<00:01:59.420> on<00:01:59.660> a

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:15.470 
spot it was because drummers know that

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:19.300 
spot it was because drummers know that
when<00:05:15.620> you<00:05:15.740> do<00:05:15.919> change<00:05:16.570> if<00:05:17.650> the<00:05:18.650> string<00:05:18.979> is<00:05:19.009> at<00:05:19.280> a

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:19.310 
when you do change if the string is at a

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:22.300 
when you do change if the string is at a
different<00:05:19.550> length<00:05:20.509> or<00:05:20.780> strap<00:05:21.740> whatever<00:05:22.220> you

different length or strap whatever you

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:25.510 
different length or strap whatever you
use<00:05:22.520> plastic<00:05:23.180> strip<00:05:23.650> it<00:05:24.650> takes<00:05:24.949> forever<00:05:25.220> to

use plastic strip it takes forever to

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:27.550 
use plastic strip it takes forever to
dial<00:05:25.849> it<00:05:26.000> back<00:05:26.030> in<00:05:26.449> takes<00:05:26.810> forever<00:05:27.020> to<00:05:27.259> get<00:05:27.470> it

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:27.560 
dial it back in takes forever to get it

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:28.670 
dial it back in takes forever to get it
back<00:05:27.710> in<00:05:27.889> place

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
back in place

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.890 
back in place
if<00:05:29.009> you<00:05:29.130> tighten<00:05:29.340> the<00:05:29.490> screws<00:05:29.820> your<00:05:30.660> snare

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:30.900 
if you tighten the screws your snare

00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.860 
if you tighten the screws your snare
wires<00:05:31.139> are<00:05:31.470> back<00:05:31.800> to<00:05:31.979> their<00:05:32.130> original

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:32.870 
wires are back to their original

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:38.360 
wires are back to their original
position<00:05:33.870> so<00:05:36.229> let's<00:05:37.229> talk<00:05:37.560> about<00:05:37.620> what

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:38.370 
position so let's talk about what

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:42.920 
position so let's talk about what
happens<00:05:38.699> on<00:05:38.850> the<00:05:38.940> top<00:05:41.360> we<00:05:42.360> call<00:05:42.570> this<00:05:42.750> the

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:42.930 
happens on the top we call this the

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:48.560 
happens on the top we call this the
linear<00:05:44.449> throw<00:05:45.449> up<00:05:45.690> and<00:05:46.580> basically<00:05:47.580> it<00:05:47.940> pulls

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:48.570 
linear throw up and basically it pulls

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:51.020 
linear throw up and basically it pulls
the<00:05:48.810> wires<00:05:49.080> evenly<00:05:49.860> at<00:05:50.070> the<00:05:50.220> same<00:05:50.490> rate<00:05:50.759> it's

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:51.030 
the wires evenly at the same rate it's
